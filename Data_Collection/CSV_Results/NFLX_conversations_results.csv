Recent headlines and conversations for NFLX
"Bought in today, twice. I will average it out."
"Markets look like they will correct after the opening bell, the negative isnt deep"
"going green in 20 days, same story after Q3, 2018"
Am I the only one that thinks Netflix’s - interactive movies- is the greatest thing ever
Will will see next quarter with all the people opting out of the service due to the Rice hiring.
"If it's not a day to sell, I don't knock what it is"
"House of Cards, the sequel!!"
Netflix now has a market cap larger than the total wealth of 111 of the world's 166 countries. Makes perfect sense....
"Invest 10 000 in netflix a year ago, the ceo is a very intelligent and wise man, hes able to adapt netflix, netflix will win im sure, more and more people getting netflix account day after day in canada, europe and Africa."
Why is Yahoo pushing this dam Walmart story?
probably 95percent of all u have netflix in your homes. if they did not get the extra million subscribers they will get it next quarter and a lot more.
This market is getting so easy to predict. Let's get prepared for another 200 point down day.
This will drop back below $500 in a week
Was priced about 3 years ahead of itself
Still have time for $370.00
"Ascending triangle then aroon, stocastics and mac indicators looking really good"
NFLX IS HOT HOT 30 POINTS UP SIDE AFTER HOURS 10 TO 15 POINTS ON THE UP SIDE
Can this be why this is down today?https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-hires-key-netflix-engineer-in-bid-to-boost-subscription-services-11580324237
Netflix was pretty cool until disney started up. Ever notice almost all of netflix original movies are rated MA.. adam sandler is in like 90% of the movies too.. he's played out imo
just bought more at 418. this momentum isn't ending any time soon
Bought 60 extra yesturday. Looking good.
accumulate and cover is the news here today.
Stocks typically drop on day 2 after a selloff like today. Let's see if NFLX holds true to that. My guess is it will be off 2-3% tomorrow then resume the run to $450.
Do the Carlton!
"revenue growth yoy 30%FPE (maybe hype) 91so it looks to be worth about a third of what it is trading at, based on that420/3 = $140now look at a long term chart, 5 years, 130 sticks out as supportgive it time, it may go there"
"NFLX moves into the S&P 100.I'm new to this stock, is this known prior to today..?"
PE ratio of 224. Very healthy
can someone use logic to tell me why this is 50% up?
Hopefully to see another 2-3% up today!
So the price increase sounds like a response to an earnings miss.
"It is perfectly fine for NFLX to sign Obama up. It will not be perfectly fine if NFLX becomes a propaganda machine for the progressive movement. This is what ABC, NBC, CBS, and all of their affiliates have become. What a disaster that has become for them. And you have no idea how many people are turned off by, and never watch those channels. Another example is the Hollywood elites. Oscar ratings were historically low by a wide margin because many simply refuse to listen to the political garbage that is spewed as well as the ridicule they are subject to because they don't share the views of liberal elites.Mark my words. If NFLX gets into bed with one side of the political spectrum, they will lose massive numbers of customers. Reed Hastings made it known how much he hates Trump as he threatened to resign from FB board because Peter Thiel was on the FB board and Thiel supported Trump. So while signing Obama is fine (it's a free country where diversity of opinion is supposed to be welcomed - unless you are not a progressive of course), if NFLX starts this march towards becoming a liberal propaganda machine, it is going to get cut down to size."
will drop 30% from here
40 more minutes....
"This will definetly beat earnings. But those who actually insist to belive that the stock will be worth 400, 500, 600 within a week or two are just delusional. The big investors will cash out after earnings. They want their quick and easy money."
Good luck NFLX longs. What time earnings going to be released?
"I mentioned a couple of days ago the problem was coming from China, not the fed chairman. Today they blame Trump with his tariff statement. Not a wise thing for Trump to say, but today was once again China. China catched a cold, and the rest of the world will be impacted, especially given the champagne and caviar parties the world has had that has caused excessive valuations NFLX is the poster child for such excess.It will be a pretty steep ride. After the dust has settled. all will be well again, and NFLX will do fine. But hold on to your hats tomorrow and next week."
With all the suspense over subscriber growth heading into the ER we know it's by far the most important thing for Netflix. Then it also has to be the most important thing for Netflix's competitors. Netflix competitors don't have that much subscriber growth. So if Netflix adds 1 or 2 million more subscribers than expected then it makes sense the stock can gap up 10-20% and trade at a new all time high price to sales ratio because there are no competitors that are doing the same.
Once again RIP to whoever bought at 580
Moment of silence for the dude who bought at $380 yesterday morning.
i have to now eat crow and tell my boss i was kidding about retiring.
Finally this morning hopefully we shed these barnacles that have weighed us down. There is a tone of desperation amongst some here today.
Time to break this one up too. Half of the stock value in America is tied up in such a few over-priced stocks.
Netflix needs to cut prices or lose subscribers to Disney. Either option is terrible for stock.
Went short first time on Nflx yest. Thought the rebound was shakey on low volume. Gonna bleed lower for a few weeks in my opinion. $320 is my target and my out
"Wow upgrade to 420, already been there, done that!"
"Wow NFLX over $400 , Time to Buy IQ rocket"
"Ok, time to bounce back to where it was before."
This could easily hit 300 today
"Earnings were better than expected. Additional subscriber numbers faltered when people got Spring fever and came out of hibernation after an extended long, long winter. Analysts #$%$ their pants. Selling ensued. Panic reigned high. Stock tanked. Incidentally, Netflix is still the same fortified leader in streaming content it was before the 2Q earnings report. Disney will take some time to properly compete---even then, humans are not quick to change habits"
Covered 253.15. I’m taking a break from this casino. Bonds are looking nice to deposit 500k in.
Morning folks looks very promising today. Love netflix no problems with me have fun
"Apple streaming , alibaba streaming Disney streaming , amazon prime streaming, google streaming, att streaming........."
I dont hold any apple shares but I really hope they do good on earnings so market goes green tomorrow as well. Keep the streak going for NFLX
"As I wrote yesterday, we are due for a little counter-rally into the high $350s, then back down again. Nothing goes straight up or down. Smart moneywill be selling into rallies. Watch the volume because volume always speaks volumes. There is o justifying these valuations and as Morgan Stanley recently wrote, the party is over"
hawaii is going through a major growth spurt. Island to grow 15% larger from this eruption.
NFLX might trade lower 5% in the morning but I expect it to pop back up and close green... NFLX never fails!!!
"NFLX is one of the world’s greatest companies. The stock won’t stay down for long. It’ll soon be back to its highs, and go up from there.It’s a great time to buy. I’m a long term holder, bought at $423 and holding for $5000."
Cramer saying BUY BUY BUY right now
going to 300 tommorow

"""In the last 3 months, 34 ranked analysts set 12-month price targets for NFLX. The average price target among the analysts is $412.59.

"Call me old fashioned, but at some point a business needs to have a plan for making money where this company is devoid of any such plan"
what do you think it will be by the end of the week
"There is no stopping this company, the arrival of 5G this year will spur innovation and growth not just in mobile but across all product spectrum from cars to washing machine retooling to accommodate 5G. This is good for millennials who are now starting to graduate as jobs will be abundant which will allow these young folks to afford a house and in turn a Netflix subscription which will push Netflix market penetration to 80 million domestically and I can only guess what that would translate to for international subscriber. The picture is very rosy and all this talk of recession is not going to happen for a while lol."
NFLX will start the April earnings season off with a bang next week!!!!!
"Content providing is becoming me too! NFLX will be forced to switch to an ad revenue sharing model, or suffer a slow painful decline..."
I am selling some of my shares at $500
12 point straight up days always follows with straight down. Let's see if the trend is bucked tomorrow.
it will drop back below 500 in a few weeks. no longer growing much and eps dropping. only sustained by jacking up monthly sub.
Pretty funny that folks bought this after market above 400
Welcome 400 Friday morning
"Cramer says FANG still have room to run...That the signal to his Wall Street buddies? Suddenly, positive news appears."
this is really shaking out the shorts today! I hope everybody with options have it out at least through December because it's going to soar right back up over 300 even before then I think. just look at the charts! nice little :-) for me on the daily.

"Disney is buy here, will have 200million subscribers in 1month, Netflix took years"
NFLX 400 - coming soon to your local brokerage account
should we buy more?
Got a trial month with Amazon prime. NFLX is much better. After little dips along the way due to short sighted analysts this thing should keep going and going. I think right now we're seeing weak hands scrambling for the door.
"Netflix LeadsNetflix Inc. led all studios with five wins, including prizes for “Roma,” about the maid in a well-to-do Mexican family, and the comedy “The Kominsky Method.” Alfonso Cuaron won best director for “Roma,” which also grabbed the prize for best foreign language film. “The Kominsky Method” won Golden Globes for best comedy and best actor for its star Michael Douglas.The wins for “Roma” gave “that film the push it needed,” said Erik Davis, managing editor of Fandango.com “I think ‘Roma’ is your new best picture Oscar frontrunner starting now.”To help win awards, Netflix is giving some releases more theatrical exposure than ever before. Cuaron said “Roma” may have gotten more exposure than if he had chosen a traditional distributor."
Should’ve bought another 312.50 put! Stock dropping a lot in the after hour
"Ok, it has consolidated, now it is time to bust through 600....it is about to move and move fast."
Netflix says The Queen’s Gambit is 1 of its most viewed shows ever. The unexpected big hit has always resulted in a subscriber beat. With a subscriber beat and the recent price increase investors will see pricing power and bid the stock to new highs.
It seems to me if I were a big biz owner facing a rapidly competitive market it would make more sense as i feel they have no choice BUT to raise prices I'm sure that was the last thing they wanted to do to their subscribers but necessary I'm afraid HUGE gamble on their part. Desperate measure but gl
I ignored netflix when it was 50 dollars but now reckon this could do 100pc in the next few months. Few percent each day grinding up slowly same way tesla did. There is no reason to stocks like this anymore.
"I applaud those who bought calls and/or stock ahead of earnings. I played it somewhat safe and deployed a $525/$540 call spread. So my upside is capped at $540. Still, it was minimal risk for what will be a nice return tomorrow."
360 let’s go baby

"Good friend of mine from high school works at TD Ameritrade. I called him over the weekend. He said when the markets have been so bad and many have lost 10-30% equity in their positions, a small 1% drop pre-market causes tons of margin calls to go out. Most end up selling to cover the margin calls when market opens adding to the sell off and driving price down more. viscous cycle. You'd be surprised how many people are trading on margin...give someone credit and they will take it. Most houses bought on credit, cars, and most of the stocks as well."

"Wow!! I am so glad I walked away from buying puts on this stock since the last earnings - just looked again this morning. What A GIFT above 400... for put options - And the guy with the new 500 price target saying that NFLX was the Lebron James of Content (as part of his 500 price target justification).. spoke to me that the END is near for both NFLX and AMZN... You know what I'm talking about if you paid attention in ""how to value a company"" class..."

Double top.

"MANIPULATEDI guess you just go long when they turn on the BOTSRIMM was manipulated like this. Went to 148 or whatever, then down to $3 or whatever it was. You get my point.They turned on BOTS and the excuse is, the market sold off, so it was a buying opportunity. They make shorts cover, they get retail to buy, ....It's manipulated. It just went from 283 to 301. That's 8.3 Billion dollars in market cap with no news, nothing. They made 0.58 billion in one year. 14.3 ratio. Wall Street made 14.3 times as much today off trading NFLX than NFLX made in a year. That's how I see it. I think the folks at the SEC needs to be thrown in a dumpster and replaced by someone that wants to act like the Securities Exchange Commission. The big trading firms get to see your bids and asks before they are posted. Why? I emailed them. ""It's not their responsibility"". I know they get to see the bids and asks before the exchange posts them. I was told by a programmer about that. And I see it when I put in a bid or ask. ""Someone"" jumps in front of my trade. Bullsheet, let them get in line. They can jump behind my bid or ask. They call it ""high frequency trading"". I would like to see a $100 billion lawsuit, taking back some of the money they stole, which is probably a lot more than that. It's like the Government is helping them steal. It has been going on since 1999 at least. That's a lot of money to stolen.just my opinion, check the data yourself"
bird box cost a lot to make. How much money did it even make NFLX? what a few more people signed up? people who want NFLX already have it. They made zero off everyone who already has it... think

"For the last six days, we have gone back and forth between green and red.only problem being the RED days have been bigger.. In total we are down 19.05 Since Nov. 30.We did nave a nice comeback from being down 4.53.Now let's just see if we can go green back to back for the 1st time this month."
why would they announce a price increase right before earnings? maybe to soften the miss ?
The day before Netflix releases its quarterlies Deutsche Bank - fined over $600 million for laundering billions for the Russians stated that Netflix has a great chance of missing its numbers. Great. Thanks Deutsche Bank - where international mob cartels go to launder money and where Donald Trump has gotten his projects financed for the past 20 years. A name to trust.
Why the big drop?
guys is not just Netflix the whole market is down so relaxed no need to panic
tipping over again.
we could see 100 point swing if earnings and subscriber numbers are met.
Interest in new NFLX content is falling short of projections reducing sub. growth.https://secure.marketwatch.com/story/netflix-stock-slammed-after-second-quarter-subscriber-numbers-and-revenue-fall-short-2018-07-16
Deutsche Bank is the most heavily sanctioned and penalized global bank. Record fines for manipulating and distorting markets.
"NFLX is about to rally, if , and it is a big if, FB, AMZN and Google post great numbers. Tech rally gets last leg. NFL gets back to $400 but makes a lower high. That will be the real sign. Definitely has another counter rally. Whether or not it breaks new highs will be the huge key.My plan is to wait until monday and if no big move, take a half position. Add to it if the other FANG stocks post great numbers. Short it if it doesn't break a new high.Reminds me of NTAP from Mar until October of 2000."
"There was talk of people dropping their Netflix subscriptions when it was announced they signed a contract with President Obama, etc. I wonder if that had an effect on the loss in subscriptions?"
yup weak stomach's selling BaaàaaHaa Dems going to shut down again. this going to the moon.

This feels like a big reversal coming. I’m betting airlines and cruise ships selloff during the day and money returns to tech. I just bought some nvidia. When trash companies are leading a rally I’d be careful.
"$585 baby. Yes, fly baby fly."
"Netflix borrows big to produce original content which was feasible until now with low interest rates. With rising interest rates and its rising Debt/Equity ratio, big investors know the problem and will be ready to sell.

Classic pump of an overpriced stock! Who knows when it will stop.
"Don't be fooled by the game Netflix plays by ""beating"" international subscriber estimates. Nearly all of the upside to international subscriber adds is generated from low GDP per capita countries like India, Indonesia, Malaysia, etc. Per member per month pricing in these regions is a fraction of what NFLX charges in the US and Europe."
Max pain for weekly options is $370. Dont be surprised if the market makers push the price their.

F it. I'm keeping my long term long position for another 5 years and shorting with house money under 319. I wish I knew how to do options.
Why?
"Today I sold me Netflix shares with minor losses. I’m afraid this company is done. There will be more and more pressure from other streaming services (incl $AMZN, $DIS, $AAPL, $HULU, $GOOGL and other service). $NFLX is burning a lot of cash and the only strength they have is the number of subscribers which will decrease with the increase of competition/alternatives. More, today (the next day after Disney released their new streaming cheap service with great library!), Netflix announced increase of price [face palm]- I got an email. Last but not least, mostly, Netflix’s library of content is garbage - I have nothing to watch there. So, I do not see bright future for this company, but good luck to all those who are long here"

"Goldman Sachs note to clients:“Netflix’s incremental net subscriber additions have grown continuously despite significant competitive pressure,” Goldman Sachs analyst Heath Terry said in a note to clients. “We continue to believe that the relative value (price divided by content consumed) of Netflix far exceeds any of the current or planned competitive offerings, making it unlikely that any of them will replace Netflix as consumers’ primary streaming choice.”They also posted this very informative charthttps://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106174642-1570719002226preview.jpg?v=1570719085&w=1910"

During last half hour share volume has dropped dramatically. Sometimes this means a bear trap is being set for after Europe close.

Goldman Sachs always tell the truth. Very honest bank. Trust them!
What happened to those people that paid +$2 over yesterday's close in the pre-market? Plenty available now.

I laugh at this stock price every time I see it. I like Netflicks but ATT and Disney are going to crush them! Netflicks is borrowing more money than the y make to produce quality shows which makes them technically unprofitable. They will never turn a profit until that can significantly raise their monthly fee. I suspect the6 are going to soon see a significant drop off of there new subscribers which will be the end of there stock valuation. Tic toc remember AOL etc

500 after earning?
CRAMER / DAVID ! 
market major correction on trade wars and White House turmoil no stock is safe especially Netflix the ultimate momentum stock
How do you know if your a SHORT Johnson?? You bet against World Class Companies!! Congrats SHORTS!! Wrong Again!!!
"Market will pop tomorrow on good earnings, led by google"
"Why would there EVER be more subscribers during the April-July quarter? Who buys a Netflix subscription so they can sit at home all summer? With that being said, buying opp right here."
"This company will rebound a bit in the next few months, but with the uncertainty in the market as a whole it might take longer, but i am still long"
"Here's another one for Tim's comment earlier:@tim said:$FB $AAPL $AMZN $NFLX $GOOG $GOOGLTalk about inflation? FAANG along with the rest of the stock market is inflated. If I wanted to get involved in FAANG as of today's closing prices, it would cost me $4k total to buy just 1 share in each company. Here's my acronym. GEB=Grossly Extended Bubble$FB-$177.46$AAPL-$217.94$AMZN-$1927.68$NFLX-$364.58$GOOGL-$1256.27Here's my take:Tim, you probably thought that on Jan 2, 2018 as well. Let's do the IRA contribution again, but with just FANG stocks. (This example could also be a college fund).$6500 to spend on FANG stocks on Jan. 2, 2018AMZN $1209.59 x 1 share = $1209.59 (18.6% of investment)GOOGL $1095.76 x 1 share = $1095.76 (16.7% of investment)FB $184.33 x 7 shares = $1290.31 (19.8% of investment)NFLX $205.63 x 7 shares = $1439.41 (22.1%) = $1464.93 leftAAPL 173.03 x 8.46 shares = $1463.83 (22.5% of investment), this is an AAPL board, right?So you spent $6500 and ended up with 5 companies and a total of 24.46 shares. Here's where you are as of close 8/27/18, using your numbers verbatim copied:$FB-$177.46 x 7 shares = $1242.22, -3.7%$AAPL-$217.94 x 8.46 shares = $1843.77, +26.0%$AMZN-$1927.68 x 1 share = $1927.68, +59.4%$NFLX-$364.58 x 7 shares = $2552.06, +77.3%$GOOGL-$1256.27 x 1 share = $1256.27, +14.6%Overall, for your $6500 investment, your total is now $8820.00, increase of $2320, and gain of 35.7%. Not bad for owning ""only"" 24.46 shares of good, quality stocks that are leaders in their fields."
CIDM the next runner. Could see $2++. The stock way undervalued in contrast to $FUBO $NFLX
time to buy this back. Oversold. Down 20%.Way too much when most people will buy both netflix and disney. Super cheap for both comparing them to cable bills.
"What are the odds these guys say they will launch AVOD? Man, my Roku would love that"
Always a week behind in my options.. 360 call expired last week... Why....
i bought a few 550 call options to day at 3.75 strike is 1-22-2021 any idea what they might be tomorrow if it can hold after hours gains
Anyone bought at 420 ?
Back to $600
Yesterday CNBC focussed on Needham?s downgrade. There are all kinds of views but what I find disingenuous is that cnbc only published the negative one. There are four other updates from analyst. Bernstein at 422 yesterday. JP Morgan at 425 yesterday and stifel at 400 day before. piper jaffray today at 400. No mention of those at all. It also falls pre mkt because a network knows CNBc is going to focus on the negative one and starts shorting. Easy money. The flaw in Needham?s analysis is that she is treating the mkt as finite ie people will leave Netflix to go to Disney. But Disney and Apple did not get into this business to take customers from Netflix. They got in because they see a massive #$%$ in future years to streaming. So the point is all will win. The second flaw in Needham?s view is that she wants Netflix to introduce an ad model other wise they r in trouble. So now Laura from Needham wants to teach Reed Hastings the pioneer of streaming how to run his business when he does not see a problem.. just yesterday Sarantos at the UBS conference said business is intact. If he were losing subs he could easily do that. Short term because of these fears price can fall over next one year but don?t bank on it staying down. Too big a mkt and the suggestion they Netflix will lose 4 mn subs is complete nonsense with the pipeline of programmes.
I'm totally going to have my trade pages up at the announcement.....buy or sell 100 shares cause this is going at least $10 one way or the other.....
"@Benjamin and Josh, You both made your point. Buy a few Netflix stocks now and shake hands before this gets uggly."
The one thing that the NFLX shorts seem to have in common is no personal responsibility of any kind. Their losses are all somebody else's fault.
This will run up at end of day... start to pre earnings run up!
Does someone know the most recent short percentage?
"I think from here onward we will be rangebound between $360-$385, until next earnings. If 3Q is good, then $410-$440. If 3Q is bad, $310 will be tested."
Looks like someone wanted out so they Bid it up and dumped... hmmm. Not a lot of volume so not a big deal yet. $NFLX $WIMI
"14 billion in debt and 4 billion in cash, not a good sign when you keep going back for more cash"
the fact that the market is going down and Netflix maintains that 13% proves how strong the buying is..
It will take years to grown into this valuation.....wake up.
35% revenue growth. Unprecedented for a major TV and film company.
Netflix new hollywood. See you at 550.
Not a good sign people when the market is up 66 pts and nflx is red. That means if the market turns red this will really drop.
By order of the PEaky Blinders!!
NFLX is up 12.13% to 255.19
"I wonder should I get into this play - it's already a 110 bn dollar company. How far can it go? What do ye think, mates?"
Thankful the markets are closed. Happy Thanksgiving everyone :)
This is accumulation time! anything below 2c is a gift. Another great news and sustainable business model now in place.. next will be partnerships and share buybacks. Its all coming together folks! Buy buy buy! Next Netflix $NFLX in the making!
Getting ready to pop 5%
$500.00 is coming to a movie near you
Inside sources say that Netflix is going to release news imminently that’ll result in a huge increase in stock price. I am betting this hits 550.00 by Wednesday. You heard it hear first!
Sold mine took profit before it crashes down
Go go go I love Netflix not selling till 2022
shorts won the earnings guessing game. congrats.
"This has to be setting up for some unloading tomorrow, be careful"
"Buying opportunity! I picked up some Netflix on today's dip, and suggest that you buy some also, or buy some more to lower your cost basis per share. Good luck all!"
"you guys have to understand that wall street controls the media sentiment and hype for companies. The""analysts"" that set price targets work for Wall street. How many do you believe are actually telling the whole storyconcerning stocks. It is no different than a politician commenting on a topic of public interest. It is slanted towardtheir side. wall street creates bubbles in stocks on purpose and for one reason. To take your money."
Waiting until the closing bell for NFLX earnings report makes me feel like I’m back in 1995 awaiting the OJ verdict.
"It's not a bad idea to add more shares at deep discount prices here, Imperial Capital just reiterated an outperform rating a couple of days ago with 12-month price target of 494. JMHO"
we might see 340 today. stretch but maybe
Pfizer just heard FDA approved vaccine
What's a good entry point back in? 530? Or a potential drop to even 500?
Drops like a rock despite being more popular in the UK. Even families that have no money to go on vacation due to the market crash are likely to keep their Netflix subscription than even cable...
"Have a nice day you all. Dinner time here in the Netherlands.Let hope it goes green again. Going to watch Tabula Rasa. Belgium show. Very nice, can you watch it in the States?"

Hi again. Where’s that “$600” everyone was hyping just a couple of months ago? Hahah
Did you guys find odd that Eric Sheridan was the only analyst asking questions during the EQ after his staged upgrade a week ago?
I'm selling as soon as it reaches $1500 a share.
320 before closing 
robinhooders know what will follow tomorrow and they all rush to catch the traintomorrow will open 600
"Totally surprise that This stock didn't even loss today's gain. Just Unbelievable how many over investing here even after disaster result from $NFLX and now totally unexpected $FB.is 2000 crash in play. 2000 crashed because too much people investing without mind.Current trend is way extreme than 2000 on few selected stock. (2000 was balance across market).This is going to make it worst out come because those 10% - 20% drop on such large cap drop is just start. When People realize that growth is not sustainable when everyone exiting, no one willing buy even at 50% discount.I think market got way too much greedy and this will result wipe out of wealth eventually as people only investing in few selected name thinking sky is limit."
Tariff and inflation immune...some say a flight to safety stock...
The premium plans price is increasing to £13.99 starting from the 25th February 2021 !! This is going to make netlfix stocks go even higher
There is no comparison between Netflix and Disney.. nflx content is unbeatable and stock going up all green tomorrow..$290.
any predictions as to what will be the opening next week? I want to get in to but at right price.
"Opportunity is to have prepared people, in others look pale when you hold $GOOG $WIMI $NFLX"

Climbing up fast
I got those $420 and $430 calls for super cheap... TY SHORTS 
netflix will hit $500 by EOY this is so easy
I left with 400 short as my 295 put not exercised (lucky $600 gift) I cover 100 at 289 and now shorted 2 282.5 put for $5 premium.Still have 100 open and plan to cover and then short higher until this go below 270.Overall I am making solid profit on this run and Overall Loss YTD is now <$10K ( This was one point $60K+)
"Earnings call Jul 16, 2018 3:00 PM PDT, I predict a nice recovery from today and a little run up above the 52 week prior to the call."
"Amazing stock, but I don't see how the ER isn't priced in. Run up too high so far. The results would have to crush by an unrealistic amount."
Wow up over 30% in a little over a week.
the only dudes selling now are protecting their short term gains. cause even if earnings is flat this still has a pretty good chance of going much much higher long term.
Stock split ??
has nflx doubled their earnings over the last year? no.. in fact they make so much money they need to keep issuing debt to keep their business alive.
Bidens plans and policies won't work here in the U.S. maybe in Venezuela they will work or China.
Susan Rice now with Netflix. How could that possibly be positive for them?
Disney (DIS) will raise the monthly price of its Disney+ streaming service to $7.99 per month in March 2021.This price hike is a very good news for the leader Netflix...
"I truly believed big investment companies are paying these analysts to upgrade or downgrade a stock. In this case, NFLX is being downgraded 2 days before earnings so they can buy in for cheap to make a quick cash."
I am happy with this trade today. It recoveries all my lost from TSLA and NKLA last year.
By the time Netflix reports...another 1.5M+ subscribers will have been added for the next quarter. Z
keep it up ( day 2)
"Short sell 100 shares at 357, let see what happens"
"""We're losing money for every subscriber we add, but it doesn't matter since we'll make it up on volume."" I think I saw this movie in Yr 1999-2000"
February 2021 subscription increase could cause a increase in cancellation.
"Just think, this stock was down $14 today and a stock like TSLA was unchanged. There's no justice."
there is no bottom to this free fall until this thing is properly corrected.210.
8% options implied. So plus or minus $30
Markets are behaving irrationally.
does anyone know about netflix's long term debt paying ability? like

For the full year 2021, we currentlyanticipate free cash flow will be around break even (vs. our prior expectation for -$1 billion to breakeven). Combined with our $8.2 billion cash balance and our $750m undrawn credit facility, we believew eno longer have a need to raise external financing for our day-to-day operations."""
I hope it drops so I can buy more NFLX!
Jackin up the price I see
you know the market will eventually hit bear market territory....nothing goes up forever
This valuation assumes 1 billion subscribers.
To be promoted is also a matter of the next step $WIMI $NFLX
Will NFLX hit 600 or 650 next stop?
Excellent!
Here we go again. Up before 9:45 and down it goes. Market is green and this one barely move. Sleeping again.
"Tomorrow the options traders are gonna cage this thing into a round number. Any bets? 320, 330?"
Could it be 4% friday again like so many others before?
345-347 Before lunch
We will see $350 today mark my words
"""No good deed goes unpunished."" NFLX asks dormant accounts if they still want to subscribe and stock takes a haircut. Of course at current valuations, it doesn't take much to spark a drop in price."
All aboard next stop 350
You cannot beat super growth story!NFLX is No1. of such story as secular super growth!
"NFLX is finished - at least for the time being. All analysts have upgraded and pumped to the max, the stock is up 40% YTD, they will sing the same old story about international growth blah blah blah - but the facts are that NFLX is burning cash at an alarming rate, the stock is way overvalued and it has $10 billion of debt with no end in sight to the cash bleed, which means more debt issuance is unavoidable, which makes the stock more risky and the interest rate paid higher."
what happen if amazon miss the ER... tomorrow just wonder...
"Hilarious that the most expensive stock in the most expensive market ever soared 10% after announcing cash flow projections for the year of NEGATIVE $3-4 BILLION. When this stock rolls over, it's going to roll over HARD."
has NFLX missed 2 earnings in a row in recent memory? serious question.
"I predict, NFLX will go down to $315 then it may turn around."
Insider are saying Netflix is acquiring Hulu should be announced this week.
I would like it to close up at least around $595.00 This will bold well for another up day for tomorrow!!
yes it will
it will be in the 450s in July dont worry.
"I'm very confident that NFLX will give increasingly bullish guidance for 2019. Great stock, great product, excellent low price for the service, great 123 point rise (51%) since Dec 24th. I love everything about this stock and I'll be considerably richer this weekend. I'm going to buy more before earnings."
After hours is going positive. Be worried shorties
"Tell me if my logic is wrong. If a recession occurs and the economy is soured, NFLX has a product that is affordable by most, even in hard times. We always love to be cheaply entertained."
Tomorrow whole sector will be up because of Msft .. nflx will jump 3% tomorrow
What is wrong with our President?
Go green
Yes it’s all about the numbers reported but there does appear to be a negative psychology and sentiment
I expected NFLX to immediately plunge 10+ points after FCC net neutrality ruling and Disney/Fox announcement. Boy I was wrong.
"Not much $$$ , I know but, I did buy another 25 shares to bring my position up to 60 shares. Wish me luck !"
what did i say 5-6% by close of day
This is going up for sure
The P/E ratio is over 200 where in reality it should be n/a. The free cash flow bologna is an accounting trick that Netflix uses. They are hemorrhaging cash. If they put content spend above the bottom line like every other company who has ongoing operating expenses an investor would get a much clearer picture that this company is losing TONS of money and will continue to lose tons of money as long as they employ this business model. It’s really a catch 22. Continue content spending hemorrhage cash. stock eventually goes down. Pair down content spending. Subscribers bail stock tanks. It’s a lose-lose scenario. It’s a broken business plan
"The market cap of this company is now 2X that of TWX which owns HBO, cable networks, studios, etc. and had BILLIONS of dollars a year in free cash flow. The NFLX ""valuation"" is beyond ridiculous. Some people never learn....."
wonder if it will drop next week
Whoever buys this stock at these prices needs their head examined
Why doesn't someone take NFLX private at $420
Wow... Can this go even up tomorrow? Any thoughts.
Can’t believe what am seeing..in fact they are giving it away at these price.
A billion $ of market cap. found overnight!
"Anybody knows of a site where we can read and post serious messages on stocks? Most people on the yahoo boards sound like 15 years old. I am looking where we can exchange with people interested in sharing ideas, news, data.... Not sure a site like this even exists....."
This is a repeat of year 2000 dot com bubble
Everybody should stop talking. No one knows what's going on until the new guys sort themselves out. A lot of mess was left everywhere.
"Double down on my short at 319 premarket. 1200 short which is limit. Plan to cover 2/3 around $302. and will also sell remaining cover put. Not sure when this will go to 302 but if remain strong, I will see out of money puts again. (Should have sold put on Friday but didn't thought $300 milestone consider so strong + greedy Analyst will jump to add fuel as much as they can)I am down $12K now in this run with this unexpected raise but I am not worry as all those Buyout talk is just to find more fool.Only problem is if I get uncomfortable with losses so I have to keep selling put to keep loss in control. Which I will do that."
Been a long day....
Buy Truck Load now
Earnings is now back in focus as trade will be placed on the back burner after the posturings by US and China.

4 quarters in a row missed EPS. Overly inflated subscriber growth due to pandemic. Competition from everywhere! Even Tmobil now has a 5G TV service to cut your cable and its fantastic. Once this virus is beat this stock will head back to reality and i will be waiting with my 12 month PUTs that im buying today if this gets anywhere near 600
"Growth story far from over...""Netflix (NFLX) is showing that it is far from exhausting its overseas growth opportunities as it sets up its first production hub in Europe. The company is setting up its first European production facility in Madrid, which is happening at a time when Netflix has a team working on nearly two dozen original productions across Spain this year with other original projects underway in other markets. Netflix spent $6.0 billion on content acquisitions, including original productions, last year."""
Good entry point for nflx??
Netflix is so far ahead of the curve I am doubting that Disney’s position and current business model and capabilities can effectively compete with the new landscape of competitors. Great to have your thoughts.
Big guys manipulate NFLX today to scroop shares: hold it tight;don't let these big guys get your cheap NFLX shares:NFLX hit $1000 in three months!
Definitely selling tomorrow 9:30am sharp.

Relax...markets red today so it will dampen the rise but when markets go green...BAM!!
Looks like Netflix is gonna get an influx of Apple stock money parked its way.
Do you think this will continue going into the week
It'll be below $300 before end of year.
ROKU AH NEWS WITH HBO MAX!

"I've changed my position on NFLX. I bought calls after realizing today that the stock is climbing higher into earnings. I intend to take my profits the day before they release their earnings. As I'm still unconvinced that their subscriptions have improved this quarter. The only problem is what Powell does next week. I'm not sure how the market will react to only a quarter point. After earnings I'll again accumulate puts just in time for the Apple, and Disney launches."
Decent recovery at the end

For the first time this month, we have back to back Green days.I do have to say, that I did not think we would finish green.The 1.14 is the lowest on a GREEN day since 0.33 on 11/13.The 0.41% is also the lowest on GREEN since 0.11% that same day.Opened GREEN for the 3rd day in a row for 1st time since Oct 30 to Nov.2To have 3 green days in a row, we are going to have to beat the Friday Slump.8 RED Fridays in a row, 12 of the last 13, 23 of 28 since 1st one in JUNEWe are now down 10.11 for the month.Need to get to 286.14 to be GREEN for the month.Last Friday, December 7, 2018 —a date which will live in infamy—, it was down 17.74"
Everyone saying this jump is to sudden i just got the mail from ark invest. They bought heavy bags on netflix ah
"to shorts, I think in short term , NFLX is still being pumped. trade prudently. Just my opinion."
276 in the next hour ! ho hum
"I am fairly new to options trading. Bought $340 Jul 20 puts yesterday. How can I get a rough estimate of where the puts will be trading post market open? Options follow the black scholes model, which I am familiar with but not too knowledgeable about (I know about delta, gamma, theta, and vega just not the mathematical calculations behind them). How would I go about mathematically getting a rough estimate of where the options should theoretically trade at market open, assuming they will open at the pre-market price (which will of course change as soon as the market opens)."
this could be the last trip ever on the peak of the moutain...but ...you know....this is the frockin nflx.So ...do your best - I have a lot of puts
There is no other place to go for investing. So buy and hold on tight. It's only going to go up more!
"buy here and you will be happy . I told you at 250, 280 and 300 . This is will be best short term gain you will have . This stock will be above 400 tomorrow"
I purchase October 2014. Today my gains reached 1000%. I remember the narrative back then was it was over priced. I bit the bullet and purchased. I’m ready for the next 1000% of this “overpriced” stock.
Sell and come over to ROKU
"“But Netflix’s management has already shown that it is willing and able to deal with potential pitfalls in a proactive way. The company reports its second-quarter results on July 16, and is likely to show another big increase in sales.When that happens, the momentum could carry the stock all the way to $500.”https://investorplace.com/2018/06/can-netflix-hit-500/"
If Netflix has taught me anything. That is how to stomach seeing your stock go down 30% knowing no one is near this company’s current market. Going to keep holding.
if it was going to 360 it would be half the way there. obviously being bought. up ..500 by labor day
time to take profit on long trades and prepare to go short.
whoa what just happened?!
"Almost 15% seems to be a ridiculous drop, but markets don't always act rationally so will let it settle out before buying."
#NFLX still remains my #1 Gainer YTD!! Back to $400 by Friday! 
This is why you don't ever listen to the Haters who frequent message boards.
this will start to slowly bleed I to next two days
Subscriber growth will exceed 10 million. Company guidance was ultra cautious and it set an extremely low bar that will be handily exceeded
Insider sales reported recently
"Why, even in good price movement days, does NFLX volume remain 50-60% of average from just a few months ago? Looks like the investers are leaving this stock, signal of a top?"
Will Netflix beat earning today?
Everyone talking about how Deuts bank downgraded it but everyone forgetting that they raised its price target? If you trust the bank so much then get in to get that sweet $450 price target.
"As a last resort to stop cord cutting Comcast has added Netflix to it's video bundles. It will work, but unlike with cable networks Netflix will take in most of the money not Comcast."
Picking up nicely
"sorry bulls but this is going under 300 by end of the monthbeat earnings by 0.06 but estimates were a very low bar. down 0.11 from last year despite subscriber growthmissed revenueinternational subscriber growth was light and their contribution to the bottom line was down by 0.80 /subscriber(very important given that is where all the new growth is)finally; most important, guidance for Q1 is way down 0.83 estimate to -> ~0.60 new guidance despite subscription fee increasescash burn also to increase slightly in 2019yeah...i don't see this continue to rise next few months"
Highest day since July 27 (366.85)
this stock will double within 12 months - easy - This part of the FANG is back - probaly 650 to 700 by end of week - seen this so many times
Buy and hold. Moon bound.
Rising today like the White Walkers
"They said on the radio that the loss of some 700,000 subscriptions was shockingly due to people quitting Netflix after the following announcement:""Former President Barack Obama formally announced on Monday a multiyear production deal with Netflix in which he and the former first lady, Michelle Obama, will produce television shows and films for the streaming service.""""The deal will give Mr. Obama an international television platform during his post-presidency, allowing him to reach millions of people in the United States and internationally. The couple has created “Higher Ground Productions,” a company to produce content for Netflix, the streaming service announced.""He might have won the presidency, but I can see why people might be bothered and even angered by this. Obama can be a very polarizing guy who comes across as a partisan know-it-all, always preaching about what Americans should do and not do, say and not say, while he laughs from his ivory tower at all our little problems which he says we cause and he doesn't have.Sorry I really like Netflix so I wish I had better news."
"strong up move toda, up 2"
Unbelievable Microsoft just secured a 10 billion contract from the government and Netflix is up 20.00 for Tiger queen! Go figure!
NFLX is breaking out!!! Very bullish today!!!
50 bucks
Feb is increasing interest rates to two times more. ..... SELL
"With Netflix releasing original series and movies on what appears to be a daily basis the fear of competitors, who can’t release 10% of that amount of content, is a way overdone. I would even go as far to say it’s all hype driven by news outlets owned by the media companies."
It’s holding pretty well there at 2% down. That kind of says it’s not gonna go down tomorrow and waiting for something positive in press release to go up .
"10+ million subscribers this quarter, but hey... That's just me. Glta... I expect great beat either way"
I called it 360 but went higher. The banks are really opening there wallets. Big blocks buys. Tomorrow another beautiful day. 380.00 easy
"Reality is there’s only a handful of super market caps growth stocks that the biggest institutional investors can buy. NFLX has crossed that threshold at 200bn mkt cap - after a pause, it will move to 300bn cap (particularly with CV lurking around) simply bc there’s no competitor in this space except AMZN which everyone owns. Trade on mkt cap not on daily price."
All that AH action because of one analysts upgrade. Absolutely proof the market is manipulated and valuations are not realistic. Nothing against Netflix...just sayin. An upgrade shouldn't make a stock instantly shoot up. A good ER that proves a company has done well is more of a catalyst you can hang your hat on.Just my 2c
Good day for NFLX....Didn't see anything specific to the company.
"Three times in the last six months, NFLX has topped out at about $550. 1) Do we think it will get back to that level again?2) Do we think there is any reason to see it punch through that level?Thanks."
"I don't know if its true. Someone in India, a higher up public official? seems to have said the 50 million subscribers is max for India, not 200 million.If so, NFLX seems likely to sell off. Another article seemed to point to Google's Youtube, Apple streaming, Amazon, and others having had time to become a force of resistance. Add in the high debt and it seems to me the odds are NFLX has seen its high for quite some time. jmhoI like to back out and look at longer time periods. Seems to have a message. The 4 year chart has $130 for support. If it goes to the 313-315 range again (I forgot the low), it will be the third time, I'm thinking it breaks through to the downside then. 385 to 316 or so was a nice shortdoesn't mean it is necessarily even going down from here or bouncing and then going down. I just think it is likely. ................To me, they are losing money. Someone pointed out that they went more in debtt for new content, then they made in revenue. That's scrary, but they do have the potential to bring in revenue for years on the content. It seems to me they jumped in very heavily into massive debt trying to fend off the competition, before the competition made them irrelevant.You know one serious issue is that Apple and Amazon and maybe others are willing to basically give away their streaming service just to get the subscribers to help them sell product in their stores. That's a touch one for NFLX to work against. They have been quite creative though. Maybe they will bring on the education thing or something else. They could start selling things, compete agains Amazon and Apple, fight fire with fire. It's possible they could come up with some ingenious ideas to keep growing.I think they won't or it will be too little to late. Could be wrong.I'm thinking it tanks to $130 and soon.just a hunch based on information I have explained here"
I’m shorting my shares at this point. It has increased too high too fast.
310 by end of week?
"If you are a shareholder, you can sell covered calls at any strike price for any time frame depending on your cash flow needs, risk tolerance and time horizon.If stock is taken; so what!You made 20%. At close, NFLX Jan 20 $400 calls sold for $88 tax deferred cash per share This is a stres free way of investing."

"I am short and bear of Netflix, but appreciate all the bulls for their courage to hold it through earnings . Good luck"
"The stock sold off all day today on profit taking, setting up for a great run in the holiday season when it reports explosive subscriber growth. JMHO"
Dumping cable for Netflix... makes sense !Why would anyone pay like almost $100.00 for cable television ?? ... and your monthly bills keep going up too/.Netflix have a bright future..
"Drama, drama, drama"
buy niw or wait??
"The stock can easily surge 20 points on another positive subscriber survey, do not miss out. JMHO"
$383 close today
Don’t worry this will keep going up up up. Trust me!
"When FB dropped to $150, I panicked and sold...didn't do that with NFLX. Not making that mistake twice."
SHORTED 5000 SHARES I THINK IT WILL GO DOWN WHEN REPORT EARNING TODAY.. I HOPE I M RIGHT..ANYONE ELSE SHORTING.
"Bulls, please get financially real and stop the BS, hype, and cheerleading.NFLX is simply priced too high, based on the one metric that all companies eventually are judged by, especially after they have ""grownup"". P/E. At 94 P/E/ it is well over 4 times its comparative value to the main competition, huge companies all in the 20's P/E, except Amazon, and NFLX is no Amazon; no AWS dominance, no product line A-Z delivery in a day network, etc. NFLX is a media play w/ no significant reason to be so bloated P/E wise other than it was the first with the most, a laudable accomplishment. Now it is the one of the many, and not close to the most any longer.yep, I'm short, based on logic of P/E ruling and the hoped for foreign dominance a non starter to fill the gaps NFLX is experiencing. The longs in this conversation know this danger. That's why they are afraid to buy more given the unknowns. The lack of needed significant foreign income impact on the P/E multiple, (which multiple is over 400% higher than the rest of the competition), simply will drag the stock down in due course."
This stock should be $50 a share. Insane valuation bubble right in front of us here
In buy territory. Hmm... Might try buying some today.
"movement in the market, we are off"
"wow cash flow positive, what an accomplishment. is that hard to do?"
Tsunami is this
"Be honest, who bought NFLX @ $593?"
we gonna copy Amazon tomorrow.
1000 by year end
In God we trust
"To those who say Disney+ is an equivalent alternative to Netflix, and people will drop Netflix for Disney+, yes nothing beats a romantic evening for couples to choose between Mickey Mouse and Star Wars while the guy explains how he could only afford one streaming service "
"I see this hitting all time highs soon. Netflix is a family known brand and will be for the foreseeable future. No hardware needed , strong brand loyalty , great shows and great pricing does it for them. My price target is set to $500 going into 2021."
Going to sell 3 min into the open... (and then short)
Remember those stone age days when you ordered Netflix DVDs over the mail. And you could only order so many at once I believe it was like 2 or 3 before Redbox. Well I still have one of those DVD's I never returned. I'm getting it framed this weekend. That's how long I've been in this baby.
$NFLX BUBBLE is the BIGGEST JOKE and a SCAM in history!
Up $9 on a down day... WOW!!

It’s not a loss until you sell
200 million subscribers wow
I’m saving 15 bucks a month right now￼
close $382 still on
Good job NFLX. Worst market fall and you closed green. Hope markets recover tomorrow. 285 easy this week.
The Queen’s Gambit is an unexpected big hit. It should help Netflix beat subscriber expectations and show pricing power.
to the moon and back
What a joke Two pieces of good news and a market up day and we are down almost 2% testing resistance levels. Normally we’d get a pop on either good news.
"I anticipate bankers selling 3 days before the next earning but NFLX went up so much in last 2 weeks, bankers will take profit. The selling will probably happen this week then another round of going up and selling before earning in July."
NFLX priced to perfection. Any miss or even not beating expectations is going to be a huge drop.
panicking ... in AH
Buyers are back.
"Cover all my short. Overall it's just break even since I cover 30% by selling 225 put last week (I thought it wont go below that but I was wrong just like I was wrong about won't go above 220.My intent was as hedge but I will stick to stock that really overvalue like $AMZN, $NFLX. No reason to short quality stock that only slightly overpriced compare to overall market. Risk/Benefit does not justify."
"Very few real shares were sold. These were shorts who are trying to get people to sell AH and in the AM. It's going to go back up some tomorrow when people realize it's a bargain. I'm thinking 365 minimum. I'm buying more on a dip in the AM, if there is one."
Vs explaining his shorting logic to his wife after losing everything...
just waiting for earnings
Will turn green buy buy buy
What are your price predictions for the next 4 weeks?
450 year end
"Don't recommend shorting when trading thins out, easier for them to push around. Shares need to be sold by golly and the price needs to be higher. All should give you pause, step gingerly."
never fear netflix rules
"Falling Revenues, TANKING Earnings and yet $NFLX BUBBLE is getting PUMPED again!What a PONZI SCHEME!"
netflix will have steller quarters until vaccine is deployed which will be 6-12 months.
Lots of short covering today after GS positive notes on NFLX: Pre-Market 285 plus
DNC is now broke. Six more years of trump. The republic roles on!!! Long live trump
$$600 End of week!!
Big up day tomorrow to 330-334. Then up all next week into earnings. Then great earnings and great guidance for 2019. What a great time the next 2 weeks will be. Happy Happy Joy Joy ! ! ! ! 400 in a month. then question will be: WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?
Looks like blowout subscriber numbers coming. We see a big ramp in the number of Netflix originals on the most popular TV series lists starting in the beginning of December.
Easy tomorrow another 20.00 upward from after earnings. 420.00 better try to buy tomorrow before the open.
"sitting, waiting for the next leg up.......shorts have to be close to having all their holiday cash covered! LOL"
I was long for the earnings pop but if it doesn't make new high I'm short.
"well there is good and bad news. The good news is NFLX wasn't down today. The bad news is the downside pain isn't over. We know this based on how people on here reacted to ok news. A truce is not a deal. People calling for a $40 one day pop (just silly), $350 by EOY (even more silly) and the always funny death to the short cries. You must reach pessimism before you start climbing back up. I am not sure we are even close to that yet."
wait til it reaches the 50 day moving average around 348 before buying. It always bounces off from there when it pulls back.
Lol. UBS.
before earning in jan .. 300 after to 400.
"Very little competition, market far from saturated and a very low P/E. What's not to like here? Easy double next 12 months."
$370/ share coming fast
I got this at 247 and about to add.
Volume is much higher than yesterday. Going to be an accumulation or distribution day. Can it stay green?
If you don’t have guts stay out of the market
Nflx will be over 400 after earnings. As expected evil analyst wants Cheatham shares
"Can the option manipulators hold $uvxy under 10 going to Wed?Will look to add more if ONLY above 10, BIG bubble $nflx is going to report after the bell today"
Congrats to everyone that played earnings :)
The best for Apple is to buy Netflix. What do you think?
now we’re negative for the year 
Never sell on weakness of the people trying to scare you out of your money.
"So at 1:10 it was $313, now $15 lower. Does that look like normal market volatility?"
this will close green today. reckon around 310 close. after 9 red days i had to happen one day...
"If you were to go back and look at charts, Netflix has a very long track record of pumps like this happening and sell offs a couple weeks behind it. You’ll be able to pick this up at least at a $20 dollar discount. Just be patient"
Why wouldn’t Netflix create new highs? What are they chop liver?
nflx must has a lot of customers and a lot profit these times because almost all europe has quarantined last weeks. So i think earnings will beat the expectations.
And keep in mind that ALMOST EVERY subscriber account is shared with 2 or even 4 families. This means that the netflix has an unknown but huge fanbase and they didn't even start with selling Official Stanger Things shirts and backpacks and games to all those people.
"I think Netflix will be fine for a long time.Disney+ is available now for a year in the Netherlands and a movie site made a round up of that year. Seems like Disney produced more originals than I tought (tought they only released Hamilton, Mandalorian and Mulan). But of course it's only a fraction of what netflix produced. They also asked ""is Disney+ worth the money. There where 18 reactions. Two people said it's Great or pretty good. Everybody else allready canceled or will not renew (but eventualy take a month now and then) Article is in dutch. Google translate might help. https://www.filmtotaal.nl/nieuws/76532"
"If raising subscription prices was such an easy panacea, all companies would have done so. This is a competitive market and there's no telling what the effect will be. I consider it a negative as they cited rising costs, which means margins are being squeezed. Don't short because of the insane volatility in this stock but if you are long, I'd consider selling some, especially after this huge run-up on no news, which smells like a short squeeze."
Haha overreaction. This company is extremely profitable pandemic or not (don’t even own a single share)
Jim Cramer says he's not fond of NFLX - I'm buying a bunch more.
I added 25% to my short
wake up netflix
That's it. I'm cancelling my NFLX account. I should recover my short losses by year 2080
i'm usually sympathetic but not the way folks piled into this one.

I think this is a great time to buy
MKM sees 390 million subscribers by 2025. I'v been following Netflix for many years and since 2013 every analyst with long term subscriber estimates has had to increase them.
I’m rich. net worth $402.52. + I have a tube tv.
$375 after closing!! #NFLX
There’s absolutely no reason why you’d sell unless you’re using your margin. And people who use their margin should not trade at all for so many reasons one of them being they don’t hold over a few days and they cause the market to fluctuate badly and when they get fought in the a rainstorm like this they get hurt. But I find it so entertaining to see how people can criticize a massive company’s finances from their basement desk about debts and “bad” financial strategies as if Netflix itself doesn’t have the intelligence to manage its company with such global presence and worth billions. This hit is not targeted to Netflix. And I’m sure in couple years the prices will recover and in 10 years you will retire with more money
Shorts today
Parabolic Movement. Remember bitcoin ?Netflix Boeing AMZN NVDA Just to name a few 
"ACRX climbing quickly on volume? ACRX why the move, might want to put on your watch list!$SPY getting hit with the DOW....long $nflx $tsla $ge"
Disney plus is advertising all over NFL games this weekend. This is really going to be a major subscription loss for Netflix.
Looks like Conservatives Boycotts of Netflix because of the OBAMA original content is working. Not good to mix Politics with business. We saw that with Starbucks.
"Disneys streaming growth is impressive, but many can play this game as theres such a huge market for it. NFLX Still the clear leader in a growing industry, and i dont see this changing any time in the next decade. Easy buy and hold"
300 coming theMeme is doa
"NFLX maintainted Overweight rating on the shares with a $634 price target.Netflix's 2021 film slate ""marks a more pronounced shift toward quality,"" as its 70 films have increased star power from the likes of Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, Leonardo DiCaprio, Meryl Streep and Denzel Washington, KeyBanc analyst Justin Patterson tells investors in a research note. The analyst believe Netflix's scale has made direct-to-streaming a more compelling distribution option for actors and directors, particularly as COVID-19 weighs on global box office revenue. If Netflix can succeed in film, its lifetime subscriber value can increase due to improved retention and pricing power, predicts Patterson. The analyst keeps an Overweight rating on the shares with a $634 price target."
"If media, analyst or regulator like FBI discover that millions of account paid mysteriously other than real user, what will happen to stock? Just wondering?"
For all of you shorting it... I think you are a little late to the party.
Eric Sheridan hosted their last earnings webcast and his questions were all softball and demonstrated no real insight into the company. UBS is obviously angling for a co-manager role in the next financing round for the company. I call FOUL!
Something to be happy about. Yipee!!
Susan Rice leaving should make the price go up.
"Netflix up 10% market down 7% since ER, a watershed moment which showed by adding Netflix originals they can raise subscription fees and still grow subscriptions."
Big money today!!! I called this perfect!!!
"Netfl;ix ability to create contents for markets like India, will see it reach 500 soon."
Am I the only one who thinks it will be back up next week?
$532.90 close.
1/3 if the average volume in the 1st hour of trade with +2.5% - and counting!300 till the end of day!
why do big companies announce earnings after hours?
Let’s get to 525 tomorrow!
I'm enjoying this quite a bit
WOOHOO! Most of my loses from the past 3 years made up in a week of NFLX calls.
How high NFLX can go?My best guess is 325-350 range near term long term may be 490
"i was long and i sold today at 359, i lost 4k . and i hate to see netflix go down to 330 again because i was down a lots at 330. this stock market now is shaky. and iam out on the side line now . iam going to buy again and hold for a long time. but i want to get in the right price. so many swings from 372 to 330 then 386 to 356, and lets dont talk about the 340 and 318. stay strong if u can. good luck to all."
"Just returned from Ireland , everyone even in the small villages watching Nflx—the whole world soon. Great company "
"NFLX will rally in to their earnings today!!! NFLX guidance will also be much higher because their projected increase in gross sales, gross profit, and net profit for 2019 will increase by approximately $ 276 million (138 million total subscribers x $ 2 increase in monthly subscriber fees) less any increase in contractual fees and any decline in the number of subscribers due to the higher fees. I doubt that NFLX will lose many subscribers due to the rate increase!NFLX will up-gap after their earnings and they will rock this year!!!BUY NFLX before you are too late. Hastings announced the $ 2 increase in monthly subscriber fees prior to their quarterly earnings"
NFLX is grossly hammered by media and overall market: unfairly mistreated like no tomorrow: given its huge subscription growth rate in international market and potential service pricing rise: its free cash flow and EPS will be in accelerating track in 2019!
Subscriber growth will blow past the most exuberant estimates!
Wow wow wow that all I got to say happy weekend
$320. I’m telling ya
"I am beginning to wonder if Netflix is paying too much to get “original contents”. AOL comes to mind, I was paying through the nose when it first offered “you got mail” and now I get too much mail and for free. Any thoughts on its future prospects?"
"the GDP is around $31 trillion. That's money changing hands. Wmt used to have an income of 5% of their revenue, maybe it is less now. Point is, the most the country income is is likely $3 trillion.The interest on the national debt is $600 billion and likely to climb, even without the debt moving north. That's 20% of the national total income.That's a serious issue and the entire country is in denial.So, QE4 or QE5, whatever you might imagine is likely to be muted out of necessity. Costs need to be cut, which will likely put serious downside on the economy, like it or not. A recession is upon us."
"DIS up but NFLX down, if you really understand the world of streaming services it doesn’t really make logical sense. The streaming universe and cut the cord disruptive technology will continue to grow exponentially world wide. If you get Disney+, you also have Netflix."
Tomorrow futures green this will rally big
looks like a technical bearish double top.
Were too many people in weekly calls? Is that why this dumped the past two days?
Down $32 a share. People will NOT want to pay more money for a Netflix subscription if the stock doesn't hold up.
Great $3.00 gain.
"I sold to early, but I was thinking that they missed earnings and was down by 10+ cents from last year... Oh well!"
"Here is consumer reports provide high level review on services.Look at Netflix. They call it best but when you read, Disney and Marvel deal list out as major reason. What will happen when Disney content disappear and Marvel deal get expensive on renewal. Daredevil remain most popular drama ever on Netflix.https://www.consumerreports.org/streaming-media-devices/guide-to-subscription-streaming-video-services/"
Those so called original content provide very poor return on investment. US subscriber growth has no more room and international subscribers are not profitable. Get out now.
I'm going to watch bird box again now
why didnt i buy this instead of Intel...
Cohn is an American hero for what's about to happen Trump behind bars where he belongs. I hear Hillary is going to visit him!
Can even get to $490 never mind $500. Definitely tough to hold a ton of shares right now.
330 tomorrow! Higher and higher as positive word comes from US-China trade talks!
NFLX is best of FANGS growth is huge BUY.
"Added chipotle and snap and roku to my short list, good with Netflix and tesla so far"
Second coming of winter to boost share of NFLX come Tuesday. New highs lie directly ahead.
NFLX will lose the streaming war in US. Disney already dominates in India. China does not need low tech Netflix.Africa? get real.40% overvalued.
Told you this would tank at the open! It was a short squeeze that caused the huge spike yesterday. Failed short squeeze means massive downside!
"Goodbye Netflix, you never had the movie I wanted to watch anyway"
I got a 5 feb 530 call! Sell Tomorrow or still hold? Thanks in advance
"Oh boy, shorts are dazed and confused now, they missed subscribers numbers but stock is still up."
Good lord why did I sell when it dropped to $280? FML
Earning next week Monday. Prepare for big gain
OMG hope China US trade news comes out tomorrow morning. Any news showing progress in negotiations. You can expect Dow shooting up another 1000+ points.
"Matthew Harrigan reiterated sell rating, he has sell rating on NFLX since it was 300, his client would have made lot of money if he went long at 300."
Last chance to buy in folks ...it’s going to rain after hours 
would netflix share skyrocket as well after amazon and google beat earning?
all hype endsthis is the top for Netflix back to 80
"Netflix engagement is growing around 30% a year. Disney engagement is not growing that much as it shifts from cable, broadcast, Netflix, and theaters over to Disney Plus. In the long run I think Amazon and Disney continue to fight for the #2 spot far behind Netflix with both losing money."
If this baby closed under 278 then we are good for at least another 30-35 points on the down side.imo
It looks like It is finally starting..
"Closed all my position on NFLX. bye, everybody. Good luck."
"Being a momentum stock, she keeps declining until she reverses her course. Currently the momentum is DOWN."
NFLX will be 200 next year...the poor cant afford it anymore
What a surprise. Back to where it opened.
What good is holding any tech thru earnings? it just gives it back over the next few days.
"If you compare $NFLX and $AMZN against $GOOGL, $NVDA, $FB then you will realize how smart move this is.$GOOGL, $NVDA and $FB all about same growth rate. Only thing different is those generate lot of profit v/s $AMZN and $NFLX actually have negative cash flow. $FB and $GOOGL actually trading discounted Forward PE just 2 year out than S&P 500 overall.So why NFLX keep going all time high vs other not.two reason.1.> NFLX and AMZN ceo/management active pumping stock price. Other are not. Something that fan club love.2.> Big player know it's way inflated. They love it. They pushing trend follower to these two and other such stocks. While reduce them from quality companies. They are very successful I think.So what might happen next.We don't know when this happen, it all depend on how strong retail interest remain and how much further Margin /debt used by retail investors, What is limit before big player exit long position and what is limit when they dump everything & go actually short. But my prediction this will happen. AMZN and GOOGL right now have $425 difference. I think in year or so this likely <$200, Could be negative.Same with NFLX, it likely trade lower than $NVDA (Also might $FB) in year out. If you can handle temporary paper loss.I recomend go long on $GOOGL & $FB, $NVDAGo short on $AMZN and $NFLX. I think you will not regret strategy year out. You likely profit limited to 10%-15% but again risk is limited."
When higher interest rates collide with netflix
Shorts hahahahahaha
50 DMA broken hope can hold out the trend
"shorts having been saying this stock is a bubble or it will crash and burn since June 11, 2011 when I purchased at split adjusted price of 37.27 and I did not believe them then nor now."
there will be definately a huge dip before going to 600
Love to see near 400 to short again and make $
"Sympathies to all those who sold. Likewise, congratulations to all those visionaries who bought and continue to hold. Onwards and upwards."
"this will easily go to 500 and possibly 1000Netflix is the future guys, profits and such mean nothing when there is no competition. Once they control the market they can raise sub fees to $50-$100 and people will pay it because they don't know anything else"
"Investing in new content is not the same as investing in infrastructure. A long term asset like property plant and equipment that has a useful life of 30 years and will produce cash flow during that span of time is not the same as borrowing to finance content.

Since when does an investment analyst serve as a moderator at a quarterly earnings call? And questions are submitted in advance? Does anyone other than me understand how inappropriate this is?
"So far, the best HIGH sinceJuly 18 2018 (383.13)The day after earnings were announced....."
"NFLX tries to maintain the current price level if it can to the end of June, but the market down trend can pull it down. Bankers will sell 3 days to 1 weeks prior next earning (7/16/18). The selling will drive down price so they can buy low. The retail investors should take profit now before bankers selling. NFLX was around $295 prior the last earning because of heavy selling from bankers couple day before the last earning."
That’s what a short squeeze looks like
Full Disclosure: Hulu only reduced the cost of their ad supported package. Charge less per month but increase the amount of ads. Great strategy until customers figure it out!
Here we guys the buying starts now. 380.00

MY retirement just become whole from loss in ENRON. Thanks NFLX
"The Same lying Analysts at $230 told you to SELL it was headed to $150, the very same People are tell you you must Buy way up here"
Nice pullback to buy back . 300 next week
"So what I saw today from watching the tape. Retail buying and chasing up(small lots)...meanwhile, the market maker was picking up those orders and then eventually sliding them over to large block sells (plus 7000) . Still don't know what to make of all this but be on guard."
"My 265 stop got triggered and I am all out. It is sad since I have held this since the price was at 92 but couldn't resist taking a nice, nice profit. Will buy in again once it gives back a lot of this month's gain."
Congrats!
One side of the mind says it is too good to be true and the other side says it is too good to miss out. This is how all scams and bubbles flourish. But ultimately this fake market will tank even more sharply than the last month..
balloon is going to pop tomorrow. It just started to leak a little.
What happens at the Bell today? Will this stock finally get its much deserved reversal
Too many catalyst this week. Time to take some profits.
When Netflix does nothing but win.
What will happen if Apple bids on Netflix??
What's wrong with a little debt if it is well invested in becoming the content king?
just thinking about - what if they had beat on subscriber count? It would have been over 450 today. Cord-cutting is real..Netflix will be the big player no matter what
This might be the greatest come back ever
Be careful with what Wall St is selling us. Tidepods & IBMs old legacy systems are not going to jump start the world economy.
With in next week $600 least
"remember, a stronger apple is not that great for Netflix. It means a stronger competition with more money to spend."
Advanced technical analysis shows that this will go to 310
Consumer confidence remains very strong !
Maybe this Netflix should have been a buy. I don't know what I'm doing with stocks anymore.
I was down 156K at the open today. Bought 60 calls ($340 strike) at the open and came out with a 16K loss.
Tomorrow Vs. will spend all day and night posting about a mutant race of half humans/half iguanas who hack into the Nasdaq terminals and rig the price of NFLX.

nflx and IQ are not affected by global market..... people watch TV through good and bad times.... Just like drinking alcohol.
Boys Netflix is going green tomorrow!!!! Great company with a lot of potential....
Shorties be like
Do you people realize that in the 1.9 trillion stimulus package 400 -500 billion dollars of it goes to bail out the democrat run cities with all of their rioting and illegal immigrant safe havens and misuse of funds ??? See what you have elected? The recession will be coming and soon.
You bears are hilarious.
Will be up $8.00 at the close. 
Whip saw!
If I buy more this will drop tomorrow. If I sell out today it'll skyrocket tomorrow morning. This one is tricky.
NFLX stock is pretty resilient today. Lets see how the final 30 minutes goes.
440 coming.
"Netflix will have a blowout earnings report, should be around 440 after that."
"In my opinion, as a consumer, Netflix is significantly better than its rivals. They have the best offering of movies, original content, and platform. Netflix also has the largest customer base. It is a question of valuation. This stock will rise again once the short sellers have run out of opportunity and exit all of their positions. The long-term strengths are too positive here. I have 300 shares and I am down 20% right now. But there is an ancient Chinese proverb that applies here: ""The ox moves slow, but the earth is patient."""
"It will amazing 50% drop, buckle up for next weeks, All puts loaded"
keep feeding the bubble
Just bought calls. She may resume her ascent.
"Today bought 3000 TVIX at 8.444, sold at 10.40. Thought I was a genius. AH it's up to 17!!!!! Oh well, no complaints. Very dangerous investment,but wow, can it run"
Could see 375 before earnings... buy buy buy run it up...
"Buying on the way down, earnings will be huge. Great setup for a quick profit"
If it goes over 357.30 it will be a new high for the month and highest since July 27.
Time to buy more
citron research warns on NFLX
"Buy as much as you can premarket, it will be down like today. It is like walking into equity. Apple's misfortunes are temporary/product cycle and has nothing to do with economy. A lot of people who bought IPhone X last year (2017) did not upgrade. Netflix's monthly fee is very reasonable and can withstand economic downturn. Disney+ and Time Warner streaming is not a threat to Netflix, I for one will subscribe to Disney+, the other service will complement Netflix and it will take 8-12 year for Disney+ and Time Warner catch up."
I think its safe to say that this has been totally oversold - market got ahead of itself on the miracle vaccine news!!
How low can it go today? Zero? How about zero? Value of NFLX to Zero.
Total joke this market is

"Netflix could report as many as 12 million new subscriber adds last quarter but they will focus on payed subscriber adds from now on, a lower number, because they don't want to show so much how they are crushing the competition. I love how this company chooses to keep a low profile while it slowly takes over TV."
All I have to say is WOW and thank God I didn’t sell!
"If there is trade deal on Monday, we will see 320."
Added only 670K new subscriber. But how many of them are one of those free ones that received membership through mobile phone companies and other partners. They don't pay. This company never tells the truth.

When did everybody get in? April '14 for me at about $44. Just keep holding on!

"Netflix price target raised to $650 from $640 at Morgan Stanley, OverweightMorgan Stanley analyst Benjamin Swinburne raised the firm's price target on Netflix to $650 from $640 and keeps an Overweight rating on the shares. Media remains ""very cyclical"" and he expects 2021 to be a year of top-line strength, said Swinburne. While he thinks Netflix has been ""perhaps the most positively affected by COVID tailwinds"" given the long-term benefits from shifting streaming behaviors, the stock has not seen any multiple expansion, said Swinburne, who sees the potential for Netflix's margin expansion to ""break out"" beyond the 300 basis points per year level to which the company has guided."
It's only down 11% from the $400 it was before the ER. That's in a fairly robust market. Tells me it has a lot farther to fall if the market weakens at all. Today's tech spike couldn't save it from falling some more. Look for $320 soon.

This countries in TROUBLE?????????????
350 today?
Tomorrow will be green...
Buying 100 more
have you seen how much NFLX drops after it surges? Almost equally. Great to swing trade or if you are seriously long then we all know you got in wayyy before these price points. Point is I can't say it's a bad company but anyone buying in now or pretty much above 500s is taking huge risk IMHO. Then again a lot of the market is the same but NFLX surged way too high wayy too fast so it will correct before anything else does. And then on a big market correction day it will not be good for NFLX but great time to buy in
Down over 30% from high

Netflix's United States and Canada price hikes coupled with an ""improved pipeline"" can drive upside to estimates in 2021, Giaimo tells investors in a research note. ""Surprise hits"" like The Queen's Gambit and ""tentpole hits"" like The Crown reinforce the company's ""outsized consumer value proposition, says the analyst.

Bought some big calls today . Expecting big things next few weeks
Does it ever pay to be long on earnings? All gains wiped out.
NFLX/ZM vs. MRNA/BNTX ( top 2 vaccine stocks) - Interesting the see they start to go opposite direction lately!

Traders rotating out of growth stocks and long term Netflix investors at the other end of the trade saying thank you very much.
Another Fantastic week
Was a fake pump premarket and that squeezed shorts. No one is buying at these levels. Need to go to 500 to make it attractive.
If you believe in streaming invest in Disney as well. I am long $DIS and short $NFLX (Although for netflix my exit point on short is near (I would not remain short below $230-240. I will exit 260 actually but may continue sell out of money calls for premium until it reach below 250 and buy if this goes below 150 (Which seem unlikely but in this market nothing impossible.)
A question to the longs. What is a “fair” price for this stock? Serious answers only.
very nice faanmg are doing great in a down day. No nflx on hand but very glad to see you guys got profit.
Will Netflix or HBO ($T) get more subscribers next quarter? Thumbs UP for Net Flix and Thumbs down for HBO......While I like NetFlix I actually believe that HBO will outperform on basis of their direct to streaming content strategy........
"EVs are already a superior technology with rapidly declining prices. As a bonus, they are also being mandated by governments around the world. Check out (http://Globaltech.today)"
"NFLX mailed DVD’s 15 years ago. Their business model died, but they reinvented themselves as a deliverer of content online. Then, content providers started to play hardball and limit access to some content. NFLX completely reinvented itself and became a producer of content. It seems now that premium 3rd party content is the next leap forward. Perhaps, NFLX will need to again completely reinvent itself and sell premium 3rd party content; like, selling new releases at a per movie price, and not only doing subscription for unlimited video. If any company has been near death and figures out how to come roaring back...NFLX is that company."

These sharp rises in global trends have typically corresponded with substantial subscriber growth numbers in previous quarters. For example, the chart shows significant increases in the trends at the end of December, which corresponds to Netflix's fourth quarter subscriber additions of 8.84 million. We also can see in the chart the surge in the trends for July of 2018, which corresponded to additions of 6.96 million in the third quarter.The chart also shows that subscriber trends appear to have picked up again as the third quarter comes to a close. https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&q=netflix%20subscription"

It really makes no sense that this stock is under $500 when you look at nflx growth and strength and overall stock market. Lots of companies with lessor prospects are close to 52 week highs. Look at roku for example. It’s just a matter of time before this is back above $500 and more likely closer to $550.

"Netflix's earnings per share (EPS) growth is expected to accelerate to over 63% annually during the next half decade, driven by margin-expanding original content, soaring international growth, and the potential for future price increases. For its part, Facebook's EPS growth is expected to slow to just 26% per year, as advertising saturation of its flagship Facebook platform gives way to slower ad growth on its Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger services."

"I watched a few things on Netflix over the weekend. They offered subtitles in at least 15 different languages. They had a good movie subtitled in Korean, I watched a standup comic from Morocco, the one that followed was another stand-up comedian from another country and the entire standup was subtitled (I only watched the trailer, but the translation wasn't lost in the comedy), watched a biopic and a streaming series. In short, Netflix is blowing up internationally."

Analyst would be revising their price targets upwards with the huge subscriber growth. Nextflix global market still has much room to grow. I myself subcribed to Netfix in March last year when the pandemic striked and continue to see myself as a subcriber even after the pandemic.

230 to 270 in a week just as sharp as the fall a week before. Congrats to those who were able to get into when it was down. Sorry for those who got scared and sold out cheap. Last week every story in financial media was about market's demise. Those stories disappeared quickly.
FAANG trade is alive and well. How many more doubles will these stocks get before they explode? Wall Street can be wrong longer than any of us can be solvent.
This stock should have made up some ground Wednesday and today. This one is getting difficult to figure out.
to all u negative Nancy's out there. Moody's released a report saying Netflix will be cash positive by 2022 wit a projected 20 point margin. this stock will continue to go up it's still very young
I bought some nflx for the first time. You have to buy something that goes up everyday. This is the simpleness strategy and therefore most beautiful strategy. people watch it shaking their head and some even go short it. But this is the contrarian method of investing. You trust the action only and not the opinion.
any news?
2 mil more subs than expectations for 14% up ???
Ladies and gentlemen - it's magic how this stock continues to defy financial gravity.
"More/higher PTs after earnings. This is a stock you hold not trade. Same thing happened with Amazon 4yrs ago. Missed out at 270, now it’s 1750."
"I'll have my money in GOOGL and Disney and netflix. Why? Because, if disney loses out to Comcast, which is hated, then I see Disney doing a deal with Netflix or Googl. Disney has worked with Netflix in the past. Not to buy then out but to work together once again. Googl could also work with netflix and has the money to buy them out. Oh yea, lets not forget about apple. They have the money to purchase Netflix as well."
"Just remember - tomorrow is 'window dressing day"" for money managers. Last day of the month trading. You can expect the unexpected as managers either flee stocks or do what they can to prop them up. Trade at your own peril"
"If you are sitting on 1,000 shares. What do you do at the open1. SELL them all, wait for the dip2. Sell a few, see how it goes3. Let it ride"
Everyone stops in to kick a stock when it takes a hit. Netflix will likely gain half of this loss back tomorrow. Possibly be back to $400 by Friday.
"Whoever buys $NFLX BUBBLE at that ABSURD Valuation, DESERVES to LOSE EVERYTHING and WILL LOSE EVERYTHING!KEEP GAMBLING!"
Nothing to watch worth a #$%$ on Netflix. Everyone is getting into the streaming business. This stock will be in the 200 in 3 years.
The stock market is broken.
"Remember when FB dipped during the privacy saga? It bounced back within weeks. I expect the same with $NFLX. Also, $IQ has enough positive news to help continue the momentum. Might cool off a bit tomorrow, then continue upwards by midweek."
come on 500. This is the next hollywood.
I would say the final hour of trading will be volatile. Where it finishes is anyone’s guess
"Why is this going down? after reporting, will this be at 330 or 280?"
cmon RBC defend your $440 price target.
$NFLX is going below $300 in a week or two.
do they put how many subscribers canceled?
"Incase anyone is uncertain, yes, the selling is way overdone from both a technical and fundamental level. Technically, the MFI is below 20, way oversold. On the fundamentals, keep in mind that Q2 earnings, margins, and revenue were all in-line with forecast despite the fact that the subscriber forecast was missed by a million. That is a staggering achievement totally overlooked by the media. I expect Q3 to be a blowout so the next couplle months will likely be very choppy and should be viewed as a chance to add to positions rather than waiting for a sell point. The largest number of shares this year were purchased between 320 - 330 so look for resistance at or slightly above that level."
This. Cant. Be. Real.
go NFLX keep growing
Long
People have said this stock is all about subs and they are right But it’s also the reason I won’t buy here. The first half of 2021 is a tough compare.
"Netflix will recover, don’t sell!"
NFLX up 10% tomorrow guarantee.
"It is so easy to prove garolou to be a liar and over-the-top lemming who hypes at all times. Faber, from CNBC, interviewed John Malone in Nov of 18. Interview below. Faber asked Malone a direct question of ""will DIS be the third significant entrant and successful entrant ovetime with NFLX and AMZN, he said yes. He din't say they can't compete. He didn't say the party is over. John Malone, who garolou worships, believes DIS will be a significant competitor in stream overtime. Garolou is such a loserhttps://www.valuewalk.com/2018/11/liberty-media-chairman-john-malone-cnbc/"
Logical that the higher the stock goes the more it becomes a buy.Fast subscriber growth not only leads to higher stock prices but also higher chances Disney Time Warner and Fox will lose their grip on the TV and movie industry.
Rally is just starting
Vaccine shots in UK starts today and approved end of week for US.
"Breaking: Loop Capital raises Netflix price target to $650 (from $600) Loop Capital analyst Alan Gould raised the firm's price target on Netflix to $650 from $600 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares. The company is becoming ""the master of its own domain"" with enough self-funded content available and in production so as not to be dependent on any specific titles produced by others, the analyst tells investors in a research note. Gould adds that Netflix has continued to grow subs and content sourcing despite the launches of Disney+, HBO Max and Peacock as well as navigating more limited content available from three of the major media conglomerates."
MM won't let it go higher today because of calls sold. Next week it goes higher again and calls will be sold for end of week. 520-530 possible next week.
"To increase growth, you need better content. I was upset that one of my favorite shows was taken off. More content investment equals more cost. Which may or may not payoff."
"Why No One Can Catch NetflixBY MarketWatch— 6:44 PM ET 08/26/2018Knocking Netflix ( NFLX Loading...Loading...) is easy. Critics say the streaming company can't grow without big spending, making it impossible to turn a profit. But that assessment misses the key insight driving Netflix's ( NFLX Loading...Loading...) success, and why the stock is likely to climb again after last month's tumble.What Netflix ( NFLX Loading...Loading...) understands is that getting subscribers and, just as important, keeping them, is everything in the new media environment. The definition of success has shifted from how many eyeballs a channel can grab on a given night to how effectively a piece of content helps retain subscribers month after month. That insight has propelled Netflix ( NFLX Loading...Loading...) far ahead of Hulu and prompted the costly takeover battle between Comcast(CMCSA) and Walt Disney(DIS) for 21st Century Fox(FOXA) assets.It is also why Netflix ( NFLX Loading...Loading...) is sweeping up Hollywood talent. Earlier this month Netflix ( NFLX Loading...Loading...) wooed Kenya Barris, the creator of ""Black-ish,"" away from Disney, signing him to an exclusive, multiyear deal. Netflix ( NFLX Loading...Loading...) has also nabbed producers Ryan Murphyfrom 21st Century Fox (https://www.wsj.com/articles/netflix-signs-producer-ryan-murphy-to-multimillion-dollar- deal-1518588414) and Shonda Rhimesfrom Disney (https://www.wsj.com/articles/netflix-signs-scandal-creator-shonda-rhimes- away-from-abc-as-battle-for-talent-escalates-1502683261). It is expected to book $8 billion in expenses this year, though it will likely spend closer to $12 billion, according to Michael Morris, a media analyst at Guggenheim Securities. To some, those numbers seem excessive, but by spending to have the best content, Netflix ( NFLX Loading...Loading...) is locking in its subscribers and locking out its competitors.Netflix's ( NFLX Loading...Loading...) great advantage over its rivals is it doesn't need to show profits, as long as the subscriber numbers keep climbing. Profits can come at Netflix ( NFLX Loading...Loading...) when it has locked in enough subscribers who keep paying for content at higher prices.The major risk for Netflix ( NFLX Loading...Loading...) is that it somehow miscalculates what its subscribers want and doesn't draw in as many as expected. That happened last quarter (https://www.wsj.com/articles/netflix-reports-weaker-than-expected-number-of-new- subscribers-1531771717), when the stock tumbled 14%. But Netflix ( NFLX Loading...Loading...) has had many tumbles over the years, and strong growth has resumed. Thanks to its algorithm, Netflix ( NFLX Loading...Loading...) knows better than anyone else what kind of content it needs and when to launch it to keep subscribers happy.Disney's streaming services, set to launch next year, are the only possible threat to Netflix ( NFLX Loading...Loading...). But Netflix ( NFLX Loading...Loading...) has a giant lead; it will take Disney years to catch up, in part because lots of Disney content is still licensed to Netflix ( NFLX Loading...Loading...).Admittedly, the bar for Netflix ( NFLX Loading...Loading...) shares is higher now, and investors are nervous about whether it can keep growing at the same levels. But Netflix ( NFLX Loading...Loading...) has plenty of eyeballs still to sweep up--not only in international markets such as India and South America, but also at home, where cord-cutting continues apace.Netflix's ( NFLX Loading...Loading...) big lead may be its most important strength. It can keep bringing in talent, which will bring in new subscribers and keep existing ones happy. It will take a powerful competitor to break that cycle."
"sorry guys, but how sane should u be to buy something with pe ratio over 260? no, really? exponential growth? are you sure?"
"There's still 21,904,200 short shares. The shorts will have to buy back in the next few days. More room to go up!Stay long, easy money. Another 10% easy when shorts cover."

"A bunch of rapists got onto netflix in the last few months.Culture and media has been sexualizing everything under the sun, enabling these perverse sickos for year"
CMCSA and DIS are creating a lot of wealth for us. These 2 nutty companies are bidding so much for FOXA that whoever WINS this crazy 'war' will be in such debt that neither company will be able to make the necessary investments to compete. The Street realizes this and just look how NFLX has appreciated during these crazy negotiations of CMCSA and DIS. One thing for sure: IF I OWNED ONE OF THESE CRAZY COMPANIES (CMCSA OR DIS) I WOULD BE SELLING MY ENTIRE POSITION. NFLX is the one to play here.
finally
Looks like I missed out on buying .. should have bought last week.
wow was up 7 bucks next second down 7
..short covering started.. Next stop 350..
"As of January 18, 2018, China held $1.7 trillion of our debt. In fact, China is our largest creditor and will make a fortune with interest rates rising here. IQ is largely known as the Netflix of China and they report earnings in just over a week. We already know they will do very well because they beat expectations last time and raised guidance. Other oversold Chinese companies that are a must buy before earnings, for the same reasons are BIDU and MOMO. Like I said earlier, don't worry about Netflix here. They'll pop again before you know it. China has been in a bear market because of the trade war; however, the selloff in many of these companies is too extreme to last. Take advantage of it and happy investing."
I bet Nflx will rocket to $550 the moment I sell!
if chipotle can recover so can netflix. this is a small dent for longs to hold for a while. I meann 3 years ago it was 700 a share and split 7 ways to 100 a share now it's back up again to 400. when facebook dipped in from of Congress we all thought it was over no it games 50 points since then. this is just a slowdown if your a day trader trying to make quick cash.

"Assuming Netflix makes a whopping $10 per share in earnings when it reaches its growth plateau in 5 years and at that time trades at a PE which is close to that of Apple's PE which is at 19. Then it will be only worth $190 per share. So, I ask myself, do I buy a stock at $330 today when it will be worth $190 in 5 years, or do I short it at $330 and buy it back at $190??

"Unbelievable it holds over $330, honestly it should of drop to bellow $200 by now."
I wonder how many people are still holding from 400+.
So does NFLX interest continue to rise to fund their negative free cash flow?
378-380 today.
Should I hold my puts through earnings or should I close out with decent profit?
I just went short 200 shares at $337. This one is bloated folks.
Get Some BABA too
WE NEED A HEDGE FUND TO START MOVING IT UP!
Easy 320 today
593 to 526 . Awesome . Rather not even bother w/ Netflix stock. What a disappointment. Headed right back to sub 5.
"Could go red...Should go red..It will likely drift down for weeks as big players buy bad news and then sell to bagholders.. just my opinion after seeing the numbers.,,Be careful 308 was probably the high of the day..Click on my icon to see the artcle from zerohedge that support my words.."
SOLD all Shares today and went SHORT
"Earnings per share (EPS): $1.19 vs $1.39 expected, according to Refinitiv survey of analysts Revenue: $6.64 billion vs $6.626 billion expected, according to Refinitiv Global paid net subscriber additions: 8.5 million vs 6.47 million expected, according to StreetAccount"
aaaannnnnnddddd... it couldn't even hold @ 580 or above. TYPICAL NFLX.
comcast to offer netflix to all customers... High def 4k for 100.00/yr. if contract is agreed. Netflix will hit 450+ easily.
Just wait for couple of analysts holding their price targets tomorrow - and it will be back to 400
They have so many tools to pumps these stocks. They can make it go wherever they want.
Funds are buying.
380 in a week. same ole story
You would have thought nflx has reported bad news since earnings or even no news. Well since earnings they have announced us price increase received many analysts upgrades have major independent surveys indicating high viewer ratings. We are going into a seasonally high sub add period combined with covid surge. Yet stock is roughly $100 off its recent highs. More shocking is that it is lower today with all the subsequent good news than it was after earnings selloff. Normally i would say but here but in this market who knows.
"At the current rate, NFLX will soon be buying AT&T so they have their own telecomm co to distribute their product."
Golden sacks puts a 470 upgarde
Watch for a major drop. Price is getting way ahead of the financials. Soon there will be a correction and watch the frothy stocks get a 40-50% cut.
"everyone should check out zom it’s about to skyrocket, it’s cheap to get on board but it’s about to jump"
And...... Green!
"Analyst just adding fuel to fire. I guess they don't care valuation and Why they should there are enough out there buy at any price. I just don't understand why raise price target to 345, Just raise to 1000 or 2000 or something."
Netflix will turn green before market makes it
Bought $50k worth in Netflix @ 309.36. I guess it was worth it.
"Very nice, actually. Compared to where it was"
Can we just have one solid day where it sits in the green entire time for god sakes?
Why the raise 2 days before earnings ?Fishy ?
NFLX WILL BE BULLISH THROUGH THEIR EARNINGS ON TUESDAY!!!
I wonder how many of the subs #'s were freeloaders.
305 support this will turn around end of next week. Its Friday long weekend taking money off the table will be back no worries here.
Will this push past $385 by 7/27?
Here is my attempt to interpret CEO message saying next 100M from India. Is he trying to say Development phase countries like India? If so does that mean all developed market not much growth left and so Next 100M subscriber will mostly come from developing country. If so Netflix sure headed for temporary slowdown on subscriber growth for sure. There is no way developing countries can afford $10/year subscriptions and so no way those 100M can come in next 4-5 year. it will take way longer like 15 year.

Gotta love that electron Hollywood.

No question...the volatility in this equity is ENORMOUS
Two weeks before earnings. Nasdaq is up 300 plus points. This go up 9 dollars?? What happened?
Up $77.00 from $500.00
"NFLX is the only FANG stock you can buy at big discount at this price level.You will see $400 soon.Similarly it happened in July,2010 after missing est and then back to uptrend in one week or so!"
Shotr NFLX now.
NFLX may hit $450 next Friday!
"can someone give me some advice if I should purchase a stock of this rn, I am very very new but can see that this is a good price to buy and sell by the end of the week for a quick 50 bucks but if I'm wrong or anyone has advice id love to hear"
Netflix is trading high just because of buying back news. Otherwise they are losing ground big time. They will face real competition from Disney!
Set your stop losses good luck
Netflix is banned by many countries accusing it of promoting disgraceful & immoral values. Netflix also is heading to troubles as Disney and many others are going independent with their own new movie networks. NFLX could be a single digit stock before end of 2020
Short now thanks
"NFLX might sell off before earnings out of fear that their results may be less than stellar. It was $0.77 just 16 years ago. It was $8 June 2010, so about 8 years ago. It is up a factor of 44 since June 2010. It seems like the competition has gotten their act together and NFLX has grown their debt a huge amount, which puts their earnings in question; I mean do they really have an earnings? $130 might be in its future. growth 40%, PE 283Often you see a company with 40% growth and a PE of 80. 283/80 = 3.5353/ 3.5 = $100 per share"
Below 500 by years end
Cash burn and bad content will sink this stock
"Good night guy, hope everyone is happy not sad till tomorrow"
I'm thinking they will beat estimates come Monday!I'm thinking we will see $415.00 by Monday close / Tuesday Open
"Controlled selling going on folks before the downgrades....mark this post. NFLX will be in the $300's, $200's soon."
"Apple is projected to launch a streaming TV service to challenge Netflix NFLX, also Amazon AMZN, Disney DIS, and AT&T."
"UPDATE: so much for 450 hitting by Friday, you long-term guys still dont get it, nothing goes straight up...not even AMZN....AMZN still got 100-300 pullbacks once above 400. You gotta know when to exit, then back in at much lower levels. We like NFLX long again between 350-370. Told you guys this way back when nflx was hitting 420. We got our SHORT covers, and now we are waiting PATIENTLY for lower levels to hit. Between general market pullback here and pure technicals on NFLX daily chart, this is practically certain for more drop....350-370 range."
Seems Like $FB $TWTR and streaming stocks went down in AH in sympathy with $NFLX
"This week, “three fitty”"
What happens to our shares if Apple buys Netflix???
"Since the beginning of the year, NFLX 2019 EPS estimates have been tumbling from 4.06 to 3.42 while cash burn estimates has shot up to $3 billion/year. Large media companies with tons of content and much better capitalized have announced entering the streaming business and pulling their content from NFLX. Netflix's business model seems as shaky as it ever was, and loaded with debt with spiraling costs and interest rates makes it financial situation highly risky. Yet despite all this, the stock is up 42% YTD, trading at 120 P/E and $160 billion market cap! This is very much a disaster waiting to happen, just like the dotcom crash of the early 2000's."
"Its on the way up, Im going to say 400.00 with the earnings report"

"indeed , shaking the tree real hard this time and its always the very impatient and weak hands that drop the ball straight into the lion's den. Netflix has a habit of not necessarily following the major indices if you've noticed. Anyway, Happy Thanksgiving . I believe today's dip was a buying opportunity and the one thing for sure is that nobody knows anything for certain. Except that Netflix will have its turbo boost kick in once the MM's finish accumulating their lots, happy trading."
"Netflix is into producing and distributing hindi movies , worlds second largest after hollywood."
PT 460+ from 3 analysts.

good luck tomorrow hope up 10
"Cool lol everyone is talking about too much competition coming etc blah blah - There currently is ZERO competition on Netflix level. Zero. You say Disney has a streaming service? I don't even know the name of it, if they do? This are all things in the future to worry about. Yes in the future it MIGHT effect earnings, but they dont even have a foot in the game yet. The ER is on last quarter not 5 years from now."
recover soon

If you’re not buying NFLX at these prices then go get a job at McDonalds.
Me before the earnings
Netflix is recession proof. In fact it will do very well during a recession. The value proposition is unbeatable. Netflix will take remaining market shar from cable companies during a recession.
Back to 270 tomorrow
There is a definite seasonal trend - in 9 of the past 10 years Netflix has closed higher over the upcoming 35 days with an average gain of 26.9%
Walmart’s entry into streaming will crush NFLX as it will under cut prices and quickly gain the middle to lower end of users who are price sensitive. NFLX is built on house of cards with negative cash flow and loaded with debt and burning what cash it has.
"what is happening, looks like some people have the er report"

Will it reach $510 tomorrow?

"MSFT much safer, little competition, next high flyer, the cloud will increase this business and stock over 50%. Little or no downside. FB still getting high growth. GOOG and AAPL also safe . Tesla, I would not touch."
1 year 1k value per share <3
I watch great FREE movies on YouTube TV they have streaming new releases as well video quality is excellent! YouTube is not just home made videos anymore blows away the rip off NFLX any day without costing you a penny!
"Uh oh.... late day buying, insiders know something :)"
It's always nflx drops after the earnings! So I guess I'll buy just after the earnings!
HBO Max is better than Netflix in my honest opinion.
Hahahahahaha
"Seriously does this stock go up everyday how about a multiple of 1000 or 2000 hey maybe a pe of 10,000 would work"
$400 by end of the day
So quiet this morning. I bet the shorts are busy covering :-)
The world is suffering from NFLX addiction STRONG BUY
tomorrow high... 410
"Up on low volume, about 1/2 average rate."
And there she goes
My calls just got in the money
Such irresponsible upgrades they gave on this beloved stock.
disney is eating netflix lunch
Seems like healthy pullback
Hold my 380 calls for a bit or sell tomorrow at open?
I must say.. you shorts are very creative. #indubitably
450 is coming
Down to 230 and I'm in
"This is the start of Netflix. Netflix will become so cash flow positive and can fund almost any new content. That is the key. Do not forget the buybacks.Whoever is selling, thank you. Whoever is buying, good job."
I am happy that stock is up..but something doesn’t make sense..so they beat huge on the subscriber growth but revenue came in line..shouldn’t they have beaten big on the revenue too? what’s missing?
Hear me out... shouldn’t Netflix Buy Game of Thrones... milk it for more money on Netflix with spin-offs. After some time when Netflix makes a bit load more money they can open up a theme park and they have really good stuff in their portfolio... in this case (GOT). Stranger things... and other Netflix hits could be rides and experiences in the parks. Netflix Food originals? Boom restaurants and shops.... the amount of money they could make on parks is huge in the future. Thoughts
may be a rough day. hold on.
just sadness ........
SOFTBANK INVESTS IN NETFLIX THIS IS BIG
$593 or $560? Which one? Was $575 like a year ago. Nice “investment”.
Im i buyer at 240 next week
Tesla tanking. All the robinhood stocks are dropping off. Maybe they figured how to sell on valuation.
"Don't underestimate NFLX growth power.Historically copycats seldom succeed through merger/acquisition.I don't think DISNEY's buyout of FOX can beat NFLX, a media disruptor!"
THERE ARE SO SO OS MANY SHORTS WATCH TOMORROW HUGE SQUEEZE
gaining momentum. $425 by Friday afternoon
Still expecting the big drop soon. But will sure as hell enjoy this rollercoaster
"One thing I learned. Never listen to the bad comments here. If the stocks are at low price, buy them and you will be rewarded. Thanks Netflix. 600$ Soon. It was a great news today."
Huge sell coming AH
toward $360 close!
When will the earnings be announced?
Green DAY arrived
I got in when stock was up $4 so you can thank me for the drop....happens to me every time!
Thanks All. NFLX has no exposure in China....collateral damage
If you are an investor you should know the answer.
"CEO claim that he will have 100M from India is laughable claim.India sure has 1300M people but when you count house hold, They are around 300M ( Joint family common in India still).In other word to reach 100M subscriber it need 1 in 3. Now even USA it hardly reach there.Now look at Income.In India 85% household don't even earn $1000/Month. In other word they can't afford $10/Month. Cable service does not even cost $10/month with 100's channel.So At best I give chance to reach 10M.Same article estimate 0.5M paid subscriber in India.This is how insane claims people make. When it come from CEO this look seriously fishy.I wonder if he inflating subscriber count using robot just to create hype and stock price raise. If Secondary Stock offer announced soon, It will just confirm my theory that They need money and using Stock as Money and fooling people."
I’m still hopeful that we will see 600+ this week
how long before we're back north of 400?
I predicted this stock goes to $1000 and I will hold till it does.
This stock is so over priced. The selection that you get from Netflix is terrible. They hardly ever update any of their movies. Their selection is up with Red Box and they sold their company to a private firm. You can just look up on internet for free tv. I stumble accross www.tubitv.com. Things are changing before our very eyes. Hold on tight.
Can someone give me good reasons as to why this will rise on earnings?
Monday should recover?
Russell 2000 (^RUT) and all US Stock indexes are out of control! The Valuations are ABSURD! The US Stock Market is in the TULIP MANIA BUBBLE!

Who is buying these worthless shares to PUMP the Stock BUBBLE???$NFLX $TSLA
I got out just in time TY Netflix for my new 2018 Jeep
It is a fine share and it is a joke if u sell this
I can't imagine Disney+ will be good news for Netflix. Strange that they aren't launching until late 2019 though. I suppose that is good news at least?
"Yes, it's not as high as most would have liked, but it's still going to be up on a ""down"" day. If tomorrow is an ""up"" day, Netflix should be pulled up further."
623 close then end of year 1000 Since Netflix is the best out there. Long holder here
Tomorrow will green again.
Piper sander upgrades Netflix to 643
Anyone see Hillary’s tent dress? Yikes
"The whole market was down today, like Monday."
It has lost 37.06 in the past four days. That is the 2nd worst four day total ever.It dropped 39.43 from July 17 to the 20.That was the four days after the July earnings were announced
All gains erased in after hours trading! Sad...something weird is going on!
Then next quarter Netflix will announce that they lost 8 of the 8.5 million subscribers which they added this quarter and the stock will take a 20% nose dive. I'm so sick of this stock going up & down like a Yo-Yo. That's why I took it out of all of my clients' portfolios.
Wow...why down so much today?
What needs to happen within the next 3 months for NFLX to reach $420? Is that a realistic goal? I lost some money on the big dip after the last earnings report and wondering if I should stay long or sell and put that money in other stocks that have more upward momentum.
"CFRA Outlook for NFLX-2018-2019---Total revenues are projected to increase about35% in 2018, with continued strong subscriber growth and the benefit of recent priceincreases. By the end of Q3 2017, the company had surpassed 110 million paid membersworldwide, with rising viewership fueled byexpanded content offerings through a recent round of global expansion. With increasedcollaboration with service providers, we seefurther upside to U.S. subscriber growth and a much stronger international growth trajectory,with rising penetration of global online/mobilehouseholds. We see 2019 revenues up almost 20%.Despite escalated content costs (projected at$7.5 billion to $8.0 billion per year) and increased marketing spending, as well astechnology and G&A expenses, the companysees its operating margin expanding about 300 basis points in 2018, reaching about 10%(versus 7.2% in 2017). In large part, overallresults should benefit from rising profits from the international division, which should drive afurther margin improvement in the next fewyears against intensifying pressures from content and marketing spending.**After interest expense and taxes, we forecast EPS of $2.38 in 2018 and $3.82 in 2019."
"got, you make a good point. Piggybacking off that, the 10 largest Nasdaq companies (NFLX is like #8) are now worth much more than the entire German economy and closing in on Japan, the 4th and 3rd largest economies in the WORLD. Really? Day of reckoning is coming for sure."
bloodbath for all the shorts lol
Amazon and apple are next.
Looks good
Can't wait for Monday when earnings are announced and all the BS is put to rest. Options predicting a 20 point move.
Zero catalysts for rest of yearHahahaha
15 min til Bull run to eod!!
This has been my issue with tech stocks for a long time. What may take months or years to gain can be lost in days or a week.
anyone else need advice on what to do?
Hi. Overpriced. Bye.
"total international streaming memberships at 91.5 million in the second quarter. ""Netflix ( NFLX ) 2Q Total International Streaming Memberships 151.6M,"" published at 1602 ET July 17, misstated the number. (July 25, 2019)So reported 151 actual number 91 how is this good? Am I reading this wrong"
Don't make the mistake of looking at Netflix separate from the emerging streaming market. With it and being the clear leader they have outstanding growth visibility.
"Just binged ""The Kominsky Method"" after it's Golden Globe success. Excellent!"
WHO IN THE HELL IS STILL CHASING THAT $NFLX Netflix TULIP MANIA BUBBLE????
NFLX 600 by end of year.
Slap that ask let's punish the shorts this afternoon
Netflix was and always be he king of the jungle
Netflix might become the next Hollywood for actors and actresses.
"Tomorrow will be big upside for all stocks, Microsoft & Tesla beat big. Netflix will rebound."
what are the technical indicators for NFLX? more downside?
a stock that missed top and bottom is buy or selllll?
The markets were rough / oversold and took down the stock among other tech / financial stocks. I think $NFLX will have a better quarter than last. Hoping the markets are on the mend.
Andrew Left has that much influence over Netflix share price???
Obvious...weather is nice out...why watch Netflix
"Cover 200 more , now only 400 short. I will start selling out of money put as soon this goes to 262 for those. Look like I thought I can't exit for few month and in 3 day I am almost out of my 2200 short stock that has 60K loss now less than $30K loss."
"Hmmm, well #NFLX does report tonight. Should be interesting!"
LOWER LOWS MEANS WHAT?
"All good tech stocks go to $1000. GOOG, AAPL, AMZN, etc. NVDA and Tesla will join that club. Watch out for trash like $FB, $NFLX, and $PTON. Those have an unsustainable revenue stream."
I paid $15 a share before 7:1 split. Trust me this goes higher.
Monday Biden’s possible covid lockdown will be in the air. Stocks like Netflix and Amazon will soar
sell at 420
I am use to Netflix having the most popular shows. However what is new is now having the top rated movies! Hvaing two of the most popular 10.#1(Bird Box) and #9(black mirror: bandersnatch) in top rated list on IMDB.https://www.imdb.com/chart/moviemeter?ref_=nv_mv_mpm
"Netflix is value for money. They have so much valuable data, great AI and negotiating power."
Earnings today. NFLX ROCKETS BACK ABOVE $351.00
Woohoo stock buy backs coming!!! $575 tonight
Short will burn big time - congratulations
"Re: spending a lot of money on Obama content, save your money!"
"Today it's a buy, tomorrow it's a buy, next week it's a buy, next month it's buy, next year it's a buy, next decade it will still be a buy, in a century - you guessed it! still a buy!"
Looking At $400
going to beat earnings..but a market selloff is a market selloff
Vaccine delay is apparently bad news for nflx stock. Vaccine progress is bad news for nflx too. Lol
Can someone on this board please tell me why NFLX stock price will still rise after earnings release even though its valuation is in another stratosphere? Profit taking will be significant regardless of earnings/guidance.
This market has become brutal.
Shorts during NFLX’s rise...
it'll get US$390 today
One Term President!!
"Netflix 375 tomorrow, rug pull incoming."
SIGNIFICANT..... multiple compression is coming to town...Sell extremely high multiple stocks and replace them with fast growers that are currently trading at single digit forward multiples....Common sense is not commonT X M D 
"All the bashing after hour, Netflix dropped ony 3%. What a defeat for Shorts. Netflix will close $380 tomorrow. More pain for shorts."
Just bought more. This is about to go to $370 easy by close.
Are we going to rock it out tomorrow afternoon?
Looks like someone wanted out so they Bid it up and dumped... hmmm. Not a lot of volume so not a big deal yet. $PDD $WIMI $NFLX
Upgrade!GBH Insights raises its price target to $500 from $400 for Netflix shares.
Selling at this moment will just loss more.
This baby has me green today overall with my AAPL and FB getting hit. Nice.
Profit taking will occur today
Game over for Netflix!
My luck we’ll lose the entire gain by week’s end.
"Hulu, Disney+; Showtime, CBS; AppleTV. Case closed."

400 by April. That’s all.
yee haw!
"all of you shorts are going to be annihilated when Netflix passes 400 and then 500keep with your doom and gloom, see how it works out for you"
Anyone worried NFLX is not in the sports realm?Disney got espn comcast got sky (premier league is bigger than all NBA NFL and MLB combined)
Might be a great opportunity to add on overreaction. Nflx and amazon are going to do great after covid.
Its going lower.... why
400 tonite would be nice. :-)
Long and strong!
355 coming.
Up to $530 we go
down because of downgrade from buy to neutral price target raise to 425 though.
There is bound to be a 3-5% pull back on this
Enjoy the ride boys and girls. Wish I were on it...Congrats!!
Subscribers down because they have mostly international subs 72/130 million and the international community was busy with World Cup which is once every 4 years. Take a chill pill and buy it if it drops. I did.
NFLX will hit new high in one week or so: lot of catalysts will drive NFLX much higher!$450 is my target in two years!
"Disney , apple and amazon big competitors for Netflix this year"
Watch for that pop tomorrow off the pull back today
There is NO reason why NFLX traded higher on Friday It obvious that once it’s start falling it will go way down who is behind this
"I don't understand. If you want to buy a company, don't you want to purchase it at a cheaper price?"
"Who all are not getting sleep tonight,please raise your hand."
They need to keep the stock price up so they can keep those super pac donations coming to the dnc
"All Netflix and IQ holders, report to the nearest bridge to escape the disaster. It will be quick and painless."
Banjo has proven my point about the knowledge level of the longs on this stock. Somehow he thinks it makes sense to compare the valuation of this stock to a burrito joint.
The negative ripple effects from NFLX to my healthy tech positions Rob Arnott is predicting seems unfair to us real investors
"When major media companies need to buy other major media companies to better compete with Netflix, then Netflix should have the highest market cap of them all."
look at the VOLUME on ACRX. someone know something on ACRX ?long also $amzn $pton $nflx $aprn
"I told you folks a few weeks ago to sell NFLX when it was in the low 400's, high 300's, mid 300's and now low 300's. This stock got way ahead of itself. The current P/E ratio is still way too high by all means. I have never said that NFLX doesn't have a good product, it just that the market cap is twice as to what it should be. They have grown by given its product at prices that doesn't sustain their business bottom line. When they increase the price to become profitable the customer base will decrease. So they are in a very tough position. In addition, competition by Disney, Apple, Google and others will only intensified down the road. If you still have profits sell and run for the hills and if you have losses sell now to minimize further loses. We will if not already enter a period of a serious stock market correction as it's currently way over priced. I strongly recommend that you consult your CPA/CFA and ask him/her on holding stocks of companies with P/E of over 100 and see what they tell you."
"This stock is awesome. It’s gold, like brady to Gronk."
let's get back to US$400!
Any suggestions on an entry price? Thanks in advance
Oh look. Everything is Ok now.
"Great article. The important point in it is how NFLX has to keep borrowing at high costs to compete with AMZN, APPL, and DIS, with the first two sitting on piles of cash and can outspend NFLX. NFLX cannot and will not outspend AMZN without borrowing. That is an unsustainable model. https://www.forbes.com/sites/stephenmcbride1/2018/12/10/netflixs-worst-nightmare-is-coming-true/#d9788f86efce"
"NFLX is really volatile!!! I've owned it since @ $100 and took profits and have been looking for an entry point. But where is the next entry point? Thought $330 might have been a good point but it fell to @ $250 and then spiked to $290 where it is now. Just can't tell where this stock is going. Analysts have been pretty negative about debt, competition, P/E, etc. Current rally may just be short covering but it is holding up pretty well. Any thoughts?"
It going down to test the 328 low guys. Then it's gonna straddle 330 for options expiration on Friday. Might as well get comfortable...
Upgrades. Goes down. Upgrades. Goes down. Upgrades again. Goes down. Big subscriber gains leak. Goes down. Surveys show dominance in America. Goes down.
Netflix is growing in leaps and bounds around the world in new countries like China and Australia ... so many more subscribers yet to come aboard. eh
4 straight down days and NFLX up 0 dollars this week Wait for the market to bounce when the trade BS eases next week. 310 coming
market is rigged. They try to pump this stock up even after $2B debt notes. Unbelievable sheet.
"Be very cautious, pre and after-market trading don’t mean squat. Hopefully it holds, but I’ve experienced way too many times where it did the complete opposite when it started trading in regular hours."
NFLX greatest asset is its shareholder community. Stay strong!
"Once again, pesky NFLX shorties learn the hard way why you don't bet against this juggernaut. If you want a decent short return go bet against a stock that isn't working like NKLA. In the past 5 days the stock has fallen from 65 to 20. A lot more than the pocket change NFLX shorts have made. Those that are still here like SonnyBlack will find themselves squeezed out eventually. $600 is coming. And I'll be making money while the shorts file for bankruptcy."
Closing at 385.00 on my the dot
Buy as much as you can
300 today let’s go
"Opened at the high, closed near the lows, engulfing bearish candlestick on slightly higher volume."
AAPL vs Earningshow much of todays 6 points have to do with earnings release after market close or APPL buying NFLX?
"My concern is that the big money firms are going to walk the price down slowly over the next few weeks as they sell, so that the small investor's continue to hang in there. Kind of like the analogy of slowly raising the heat in the pot the lobster is in (lobster doesn't realize it till it's too late!). As opposed to throwing the lobster in the boiling water and have it jump out. The next few weeks will be interesting to watch."
Apple up 3 Barry
Shorts leaving it seems.
"Is it me, or has NFLX given back that huge earnings call?"
LOL to amateur sellers
"Subscribes count not everything, subscribers need money to there valet to continue membership. Think  about coming economic situation of US and world."
This is all shorts now
Reed Hastings sold $300 million of NFLX stock in 2018. He did not buy any stock on the decline down to $230. He just sold more stock. Reed thanks you for a wonderful 2018 and wishes you a Happy New Year.
200 dollars at most!
"Houston, We are ready for takeoff "
Netflix does NOT self-produce that much orignal content: 87% of their current content was *licensed* according to their SEC filings.
same pattern as yesterday....load up early.....should see 400 today
Way to go longs. I don't own.
So cheap now should jump $25 today at least

"its risky, but its hard to resist dip.buying at this level. the reward will be big."
"earnings report soon: July 16, 2018!"
Netflix sell-off will never happen because 80% of the 435 million shares of netflix or 348 million shares worth $145 Billion are owned by institutions. These institutions are not affected by individual emotions to trigger sell-off but governed by groups of fund advisors who decide to hold or sell the funds.
Is this going to be a 500+ stock before end of year?
Sentiment from two weeks ago has not changed on this stock when it was at $385. It was the computer algos that sold it off in addition to the weak hands that took quick profits on that latest run-up. ZERO direct exposure to China. Stay strong longs and buy any weakness.
Wait after lunch going green again start buying. You be happy closing around 366.00. It’s Friday baby
Big reversal pre market...from up 3 to down 1. Yikes
PT increased to 420$ ! That’s real !
600$ is a reasonable price target
"Man, when will people start listening to me. We all have a thing called ""The world wide web"" And people want good things at a good price. Now, I have been researching this sector for years and I am a subscriber to Netflix but I don't use it. Now the reason why will shock you? They have the same shows on their since I started service. Now, let me give you an anology. If you have a starting five such as the golden state warriors and for years you are close to making the playoffs but then you lose in the first round if you do make it. Now, you trade some players or aquire all stars such as adding super all star Kevin Durant. You win the championship. Now, going back to Netflix is that they are not staying competitive and when Walmart which is way bigger than netflix will ever be starting their streaming service or how google is buying up the Virtual Reality sector you will see why Netflix will not compete. They need to clean up their business or they will get squished by its competitors."

"If you are selling NFLX due to old kangaroo called DIS entering the show then you are short sighted.

Nobody will cancel NFLX to have Disney, families will have it as an add on for the kids and that’s about it."
May see 356 again......?
wow! nice buying opportunity!
"seems to be a trend. high of the day around 10am, then lower highs and lower lows."
Great day! I always regretted not purchasing Netflix and today was my chance. I will keep these for the longer term :-)
"I don’t think there’s too much to worry about Disney service In my opinion. Most folks have both as I do. Some don’t even have cable tv anymore. So having both is an advantage to the customer. It would be another issue if it was illegal to own both. At the current subscription price, most can afford both. Now I would start to worry if these services were to increase to $40-$50 monthly subscription. That’s a price point where most would start to pick one or the other. I wish both success as it has rocketed competition for better content."
A big misconception is Netflix got big because they never had serious competition. Hulu (Disney Comcast) along with Amazon had to be serious competition for tiny Netflix back when. It only makes sense being the major media company it is today Netflix competition has to be weaker than ever. It will be confirmed when the stock rises to 1000 next year.
92pe!!
$500 this time next year
subs all that matters Netflix so cheap they can keep raising prices as long as content is getting better

What's the expectations of Netflix earnings?? Going to beat expectations?
boom goes the dynamite!
I've noticed fewer people watching Netflix shows lately. Their offerings of shows has gone downhill IMHO.
Im bullish.. Netflix is the benchmark in the streaming market and too big to fail. There are still high growth possibilities plus profits will rise exponentially

So NFLX has the same Market Cap as ATT. So if HBO Max gets 100M subscribers in one year it should be worth $1T. So how do these valuations work?
"I planned to buy the stock this morning but then turned to be hesitant after receiving and reading the lower target price updates by 4 analysts from GS, JPM, DT, and Raymond James. My point is that these analysts must know more about the company’s current state of business than most of us and their actions must speak of some facts. Am I right? Any advice is appreciated."

It needs to consolidate some of these moves and this is very healthy price action.Shares are gearing up for another big move, that much is clear. The only thing we need to figure out is which direction. If the past is any indication, that direction will be higher.Watch for a move up to $405 to $410. Should we get it, it could spur a rally back to its previous highs near $420 and possibly even new all-time highs above that.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-top-stock-trades-friday-195312774.html"
Why this is down?
"@Alen- Glad to hear common sense prevailing. At this point NFLX is totally immersed in people's lives. Even the bears can't argue that point. And the pleasure that people get from watching what this company puts out literally costs them less then 50 cents a day. If people want to add Hulu or Disney+ along the way then they'll simply pay $10 to add a second streaming service. That's under $25 a month for multiple streaming services. People spend that at Starbucks during the course of a week or the first 2 hours at a bar on a Saturday night. Like you said... no one is cancelling their NFLX subscription to redirect 15 freaking dollars elsewhere for a different streaming platform. Bottom line: Stay long, ride the subscription wave to 200 million worldwide, ride the 800 pound gorilla that will start printing money within 3 years which every analyst under the sun has been saying. Sometimes the easiest money can be made in the simplest of stories. The NFLX story is as simple as they come. In a short time there will be almost a quarter of a billion people paying $15 a month to watch content that they are obsessed with. A story doesn't get any more beautiful than that."
"Sell offs like this is way more than a 3B revenue miss. If you believe in Netflix and believe it’s not going anywhere, therefore will continue to grow and make money, but doesn’t perform on a quarter the way analyst say it should, then why do people sell? It just hurts your stock, if patience and relaxation would take place even on a miss, your stock would stay solid and be closer to 400 a share again. Really, think about it, the share will drop low again when it was up 50%, but people will still invest and not go anywhere, so why sell? Seems to me people hurt their own finances by tanking there own stock."
At least NFLX is unaffected by that tariffs thing.
selling off again. man this may be bad. I'm stuck in $409. I hope this is not a sign of bad news. I said if they hit numbers this would just go back to about 420.
Elvis has left the building
Could Netflix split again??
I need gains! Let’s go AH!
Earning is up 32% from last quarter. How come nobody mentioned here.
"CC Bad, oh no."
netflix is looking into buying steam for gaming interface.
"the guy has a massive short on $SHOP since 2 qtrs ago that drove the stock down below its 200D SMA and below $90. now that it was over $140 and he still hasn't covered, he needs to do something to help drive the stock down - and this is it. Left is a hack - a broken clock is right twice a day (he got Valeant right). oh, and how is his $NFLX short doing?"
"one thing I have learned from this company, it always comes back and sooner rather than later. Hold onto your Shares!!!"
Same story..... Zzzzzzzzzzzz.. Opened high... Close red..
I'm holding...
"Here is three very negative news that impacting dow to drop 700+ point and one of most impacted stock for each is Amazon and yet it's stock drop only 2.34% after recovering quickly.1.> Tariffs:- China tariffs going to hurt Amazon most. Trade war will hurt Amazon as well because Amazon has lot of global seller and lot of Amazon brand created by putting their label on top of Chinese manufactured stuff. So This should drop as much as $CAT drop.2.> Internet Regulation:- This again impact most to Amazon. Amazon is E-commerce giant and regulation means it will not able to do lot of thing it currently doing.3.> Internet Privacy:- This is third item:- When people think about Privacy most matter is their blogging/personal post (FB), Their Shopping ($AMZN) , Listening their home conversation ($AMZN/$GOOGL), Ability to let anyone one ($AMZN recent doorbell idea to let package deliver inside),Their TV Watching Pattern ($AMZN, $NFLX, $GOOGL).So each item has major negative impact for $AMZN and yet Amazon is least impact stock even after so much run up.This is call way over optimism. This stock should below 1500, may be even near 1400. Only thing going great is technical but it going to break down at 1525. So I guess after that only it will drop like rock. After all entire rally build on top of technical."
Buy now and thank me later.
Be ready for 345$ tomorrow
"Wow , stays green.."
not 1 green day since earnings. this stock and company is done for.
Markets getting crushed in after hour... no news
"I bet a lot of NFLX shorts think that because of Disney’s projected 200 plus million subscribers over the next few years that they will eat NFLX’s lunch. That’s simply not the case. DIS and NFLX make very different shows and target different markets. There is a way the two can coexist without cutting each other’s throats. As long as NFLX continues to make shows like The Queen’s Gambit their subscriber numbers won’t shrink. Long term I am bullish on both DIS and NFLX and believe the two can coexist in the same way Coke and Pepsi, Square and PayPal, Domino’s and Papa John’s, all can. Competition doesn’t have to erode business when there are only a few players. Own both. I see so many people bashing DIS in this discussion and vice versa in the DIS discussion it makes no sense. Two money makers are better than one. GLTA."
Let’s take NETFLIX to the moon today. Come on bulls we can do it 380.00 easy.
"Very high PE, additional 1.5 billion debt. NFLX to go down quickly"
Beef Stew!
At this rate NFLX will buy Mickey
230 this week
"looks like the analysts can't keep up with the price increases. Wildly inappropriate, but it seems the norm for mega caps to go up 10 percent a week these days."
NFLX is a streaming channel among many. Production companies are creating their own streaming channels to stream their own productions. The writing was always on the wall. Why else would NFLX invest so much in producing their own shows?! $150 billion is much too generous that's why NFLX has a lot of downside ahead of it.
You all going to wish you bought yesterday when it was low. 10% up today. Green Day. Positive into the end of the year
Grats to anyone who sold this stock. You will regret it after this month...
Does anyone think this stock will do a 2 for 1 split soon?
"short and loose, 2008 was over in 1 year"
"The long-standing assumption for Netflix's optimistic growth trajectory was the potential pricing power and hyper growth of subscriptions. However, recent market trends show that its core pricing power may be limited asnew subscriptions slow.https://seekingalpha.com/article/4186627-netflixs-perceived-pricing-power-may-soon-hit-reality"
so are they posting at 12:05 or after the bell? Yahoo says 12:05 and an article on e trade says after the bell.
"Anyone notice a quarterly trend here? Right before earnings and # of subscribers release, the stock dips to sub 500. Right after the market closes and the company reports, the stock shoots right up. It appears it happen the last 3 quarters."
NFLX is a strong stock it will go up
Honestly speaking i am impressed by Netflix contents lately. They are becoming very innovative and the contents are top notch
I'm guessing NFLX will find some support in the 260 to 270 range.
"Some day the entire market will just consist of NFLX as it never goes down. And that makes perfect sense. Perfect. Who else will be able to stream content but NFLX? And that $12 Billion in debt which isn't listed on the balance sheet won't ever matter, even after DIS takes all of its content off NFLX and starts its own streaming service. NFLX RULES!!!!!"
"Words around that there's boycott for NFLX since Rice become board of director, follows by Obamas multi year's deal. Is that true? If this continue I think NFLX may go down further. Overseas subscribers maynot follow through, there maybe more competition for domestic overseas that we don't know but NFLX and some may now."
Expected it!!
split?
No retail investor with substantial NFLX exposure is stomaching these moves.
"Competition in the space is only INCREASING.... going forward which makes the current nosebleed valuation for NFLX extremely difficult (impossible ?) to support.... Again, based on current NASDAQ analyst consensus estimates, TXMD-by far-has SIGNIFICANTLY.....more upside potential than NFLX going forward....The NFLX party is about to end while the TXMD party has not even started....Good luck to all "
THIS BUBBLE IS BETTER THAN THE BITCOIN ONE HAHAHAHA. CHEERS TO ALL THE LONGS AND TO MANY MORE FANTASTIC QUARTERS SUCH AS THIS ONE
"They are going to throw a good day in there every now and then to get the public to think everything is ok but the market is tanking lower and lower. The dow will be under 23k soon. The good days will go up just a tad to trick people to put their money in so they can trap you the following day. One day up 100 points, the next day down 300-500 points."
"Hopefully we will see buyers come back here today. At least Amazon is up a little bit. That stock should be at least $3,500."
"NFLX funding new content with debt. Interest rates go up, NFLX stock price goes..."
"once the virus scare is over, millions will dump netflix and other streaming video services. time to get out and see the real world and enjoy life.not sit in a room and live pretend life."
So here's the deal fellas... this puppy is flying to 400 come Friday! Buy while it's cheap!
"If there was a ""13 reasons why"" for the adult world. IQ and Netflix would be all of those reasons. Annnnnnd being a democrat too."
Question for you Netflix fanboys. Do you even acknowledge HBO Max as a dangerous competitor at this point?
there is no doubt that nflx will go up in the future. But not now..... It will be bearish for 3 months until next quarter when analysts will pump the stock again before earning. Same story
Earning in 4 weeks... This time earning expectation are so low that nflx can easily beat expectation.
Where are the bashers? 
Netflix will fly come earnings and new subscriptions
Let's go OPEN 340$ and close 290$. You can do it
400 sooner than later
440 close ? LOL
Disney’s strategy only cements and validates Netflix dominance and sound business strategy. Disney only shouted to the world that Netflix is doing exactly what it should have been doing the past 5 years.....
So much for $600 NFLX..... another terribly overvalued tock stock.... one of the best shorts in the market...
@Faith E
Netflix closes the week at 2001 not including 7 to 1 split.
Netflix price target raised to $650 from $625 at CowenCowen analyst John Blackledge raised the firm's price target on Netflix to $650 from $625 and keeps an Outperform rating on the shares. The analyst said his survey suggests its US pricing power continues to rise and he expects paid net additions to come in above guidance.
Netflix = Netscape
Michelle Obama's new NFLX series will explain how to short NFLX and profit like Hillary did with uranium one. Lots of money to be made.
"As the share price deteriorates and the PE drops, so will the quality of new NFLX investors., adding to the difficulty of regaining recent highs.Many new investors will be more short term and PE conscious, cutting short future rallies. I will be surprised to see bounces like we had from 344 to 380 after earnings were announced.The high PE was a moat that kept out brittle investors."
well well wellllllllll
First time this will go hard !!! 10%
Shorts LAST desperate attempt
"Great company that’s showing competition fears were overblown. Disney is the only one remotely competing, I would not be surprised if more than one new entrants leave the industry entirely"
netflix has a stockpile of cash in hand they cannot lose. if they see a decrease in income they can reduce the number of shows they produce and save millions. the big funds manipulate this stock with news but long run it's gonna be a great stock. if there's no minus in front if eps it's a winner
"if the same chart pattern as yesterday holds, it will close near the low of the day which is $360"
Euphoria returning to market...
Good growth but on market down days buy it in low 500s. wait for it to get in.
NFLX could close green...
NFLX now has 6 PT upgrades today ranging from 585 - 700
I’m picking up 5 shares long at the open Monday. Maybe 6.
Why this slow bleeding again?
$NFLX PONZI SCHEME will COLLAPSE by 65% soon!
It’s really green now and of course tomorrow too
Great job Netflix kneel. To the king
"Netflix Inc (NFLX) CEO Reed Hastings Sold $14.8 million of SharesGuruFocus.com GuruFocus.comNovember 22, 20171 Comment- By insiderCEO of Netflix Inc (NFLX) Reed Hastings sold 75,243 shares of NFLX on 11/21/2017 at an average price of $196.25 a share. The total sale was $14.8 million."
"Oh boy, margin calls kick in on Monday."
NFLX to split 3-1!!!!! Load up@!
"I'm a long term holder of NFLX with an over 300% gain. I continue to believe that streaming is the future. If you are a long term holder, I want to know your thoughts."
You all knew I predicted below 500 for the end of the week lol
"NFLX earnings date: July 16, three weeks away!"
Man. All FANG have been a big zero for six months. If nothing moves this ER round it’s certainly time to move on.
"So much negative missinformation before earnings, Yahoo Finance peddled some of these boiler room lies. They worked the retail investors HARD on this one."
337+ by close of day.
$350 by Tuesday next week.
Just watch the stock and watch the sell-off an hour from now Weekly target is $250
Was a good day. Now i go watch another episode of El Chapo on Netflix. That guy made almost as much money as the people that go long on Netflix :)! Cheers and hope tomorrow will be as good as today.
The moment of truth is here! We either go up 15-20 points tomorrow or it goes down 20-30. It seens that every analyst out there is predicting great numbers so we'll see. I got in at 355 last week during the big dropoff and I'm hoping to get out at 375 tomorrow afternoon. 200 shares so a quick 4k in my pocket. Good luck everyone! #KingNetflix
Taking profit today would be very wise
"If the last run ups to earnings are of any indication, NFLX will be trading around 417 by earnings call, with nice bump afterwards. The longs are in a great position right now."
Neflix golden Globe Nominations: 34 is the same as HBO (15) + Amazon (8) + Disney (6) + Hulu (5) combined. Think about that. Really think about that.
Going up due to more lockdowns being initiated around the world. Netflix is the King.
Only the MM can keep NFLX under 295 today
NFLX Q3 result on 16th will move the stock price up a lot. I was able to buy it cheap at $320 as it went down last weak. I predict it will go up to $400 this week as more than 7 million International users have joined NFLX.
This beast is going right back to $400 isn’t it?
SO MANY SHORTS
looks like it held up strong
Just wait and see where volume goes today. We’ll know the truth about a hour before close.
So great. Added more 2 days ago.
amazon is next!
100 dollars for NFLX is too much ?
FANG stocks are in a correction process.
So what’s the word on today’s actionI think it will be a replay of yesterday dropping to 560 and then closing around low 570sWould love to see it bottom out at 530s early so I could cash in on my puts and call it a day
who would worry for a 1% drop after 15%+ gain yesterday.. haha
think of it as a slingshot
"India penetration and growth for NFLX can be a powerful driver. NFLX is a powerful distribution channel for the hugely popular Bollywood movies that are watched in numerous countries. Rather than struggle and share profit with distributors in individual countries, Bollywood movies and shows can reach almost 200 million viewers instantly"
it will possibly be green by tomorrow lol
Get me to $380 and I’m out.
bottomed??
"NFLX 12 month earnings $1.4B, market cap $143B. By this it's extremely overpriced but sometimes that doesn't matter...until it does."
400$ after ER or higher possible
"trade ""war"" can hurt them in that they may not get entry into countries they might have a fee for viewing, a tariffthe cash flow isn't so hot, that would mess them upthe trade stuff is important and a good idea, but it will hurt in the beginningTrump is rightthose that complain are wrong"
Nothing that anyone says here today matters until AAPL reports.
"Great sell by by, plus I'm canceling my subscription ..hello Amazon Prime......"
"Just sold, it should scream upwards now. You’re all welcome"
Lunch is done now the buying starts again.
More Netflix subscriptions as the world seeks to lockdown again... Netflix to the moon! Vaccinations are not going to have any effect for at least 5 to 6 months...
Two reason: Disney is coming into the streaming field; NFLX US subscription growth is slowing down
Fundamentals don’t matter......Until you offer 1.5 billion in Junk bonds.

"$TSLA $NVDA $FB $NFLX , these are heavy volumes on the downside. Pretty scary."
"let me guess. not enough new subscribers, but positive earnings. and boom -5%"
I'm only up 110% now instead of 125%...oh well.
$600 what ?? This stock has passed $500 on its way to $1000. Take a picture and check back !!!!! :)
There is no way we dont make a new high tomorrow

"The last I posted about Pi, it was trading unofficially at $0.2x per coin and that is now all the way up to $0.8x and there are over 10 million miners/pioneers mining coins on their phones.Before you skip the post thinking it's useless for you, check out where BitCoin is trading today. It's over $24,000 per coin. I am not saying that pi will be that successful, but what if it even reaches $100 per coin in the future? Even if you can mine 1000 coins by the mainnet launch the next year, those coins can be worth a significant amount of money.In any way, you NEVER have to pay anything to anyone to mine pi, it's open for anyone to mine on their phone as BitCoin was in earlier days. Just download the app on your phone, use invitation code ""celebration26"" when registering (it's by invitation only), and make sure to use your legal name as when they assign the coins to your wallet in the future, they will verify that if you are the person who you said you are.As far as my progress, I have mined so far about 10k coins which unofficially are worth about $8k and possibly can be worth much more when the mainnet is officially launched and the pi starts trading on crypto exchanges officially."
It’s gonna flush at 3:50pm. Watch.
EXPECT EXCELLENT 3RD QUARTER EARNINGS WITH ADDITION OF NEW CLIENTS FROM INDIA!!!
425 today
Booming
Will close at $367
$NFLX now I want you to go down baby! you were beautiful today! But that's enough!No greed - no sorrow!
"""SMASHES EARNINGS"""
This should gap up and shoot out tomorrow. Time to test $600.
A little push here and 300 is in play
Dead cat bounce.
Netflix profit now 1030% and counting. Starting to think this could be another Amazon.
?????? Good to know that there is some sanity in the market. FB has nothing to do with NFLX period. I am keeping the faith especially that one tiny positive announcement from NFLX will turn things around and if AMZN beats then it will even be better.
So the weekend action on the board tells me that the shorts had a nervous weekend. Just got back from a relaxing weekend and pumped for another awesome week for NFLX. Lets get this to $360 guys. It helps keep the shorts crying under their pillows and it is fun to see them hiding all day. Can I hear the longs give me a hell yeah? And any shorts who gave up are welcome to join and give me a hell yeah too :)? Lets keep the rally going guys and keep the shorts running.
everything is netflix now

"Green pre-market, that’s what I like!"
That was great! I managed to turn a profit and Im happy with that.Good luck everyone.i'm out of here.
"Wow! Almost everything to the upside in my portfolio today....except NFLX....what a bummer! I put in a stop-loss order a few weeks ago at $300. Originally bought my small time 40 shares at $115 so if I have to get out at $300 that's perfectly OK. i would rather it start its upward climb again. Stay tuned. I still have a cushion of $22. I have a feeling that the week to come will either give me a $7,400 short term gain or we will be off to the races again. Thoughts????"

Easy short here. Watch this break 300 handle tomorrow.
"NFLX will be green tomorrow no matter the outcome in Georgia.. Republicans win and the market stays stable, democratics win and the markets slides but outlook on NFLX will be good due to more lockdowns and stimulus packages! Green tomorrow"
Very good news. Netflix is hiring Colin Kaepernick .He will be paid 25 mln and will be a member of the board with Susan Rice..I am buying in the morning
"Next quarter earning outlook $2.97,looks impressive."
I’m buying more tomorrow I believe in the company.
Shorts how does it feel?
https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/19/market-beating-investor-bill-nygren-says-facebook-and-netflix-are-real.html
So shorts....show me the $220.00 bottom....Hmmmmm! Buy to cover your short which will propel this stock to $310.00 in March and $350.00 in April after earnings. NFLX may be acquired either by AAPL or DIS.
Is it quite possible for this to sink to 230 this week?
another buy opportunity!! loading up!
I've got the idea that Walmart needs to get ahead. Put in streaming lounges in their stores! I bet you can't wait to lounge with all your favorite Walmart Shoppers!
"Peaking stock price of NFLX is a thing of the past. It has very very limited scope of rising from above this level. It has lost its monopoly. Original content can be produced by other competitors as well.With surplus cash, Apple can be a winner in the race. Disney content going away from Netflix can prove expensive to Netflix. Stock price will remain in this level or will drift down when Market correction happens."
Nah the buying starts again soon. It’s going to move up again stay tuned
I still contend several biggies knew about the 2B note...waited until earnings sent it higher and imediately sold before the announcement of the 2B was made. Classic insider trading. Too many knew about securing the 2B and the stock reacted VERY funny from AH’s to close the next day.
Would be very nice if Netflix continues this momentum today. If it continues to outpace the market it will hit green quicker
Netflix getting near the bottom... the rebound rally will go up at least $40.00-$50.00don't miss it
"short have been accumulating in names like fb,nfln,twtr,snap and others for the past 6 weeks. one problem for influx shorts is that the price momentum stalled and it isn't dropping. pain is to the upside and its not about mkt cap its about where traders can separate the most amount of money from investors. nflx is going to trade back to $380-390 in the next 6 weeks and come earnings they could pull a tsla and be back over $400."
$520 looks like a good entry point. I don't think you would lose money if you bought in the last couple days. But you would have to hold it for a while.
"Apple and Google and Disney and .... are spending and will spend billions to create streaming video.Do you suppose that will affect Netflix's bottome line?The forward PE is probably pie in the sky.PE more than likely to go up significantly, which will cause the stock price to dive."
option expiration day ; traders and hedgefund guys driving it down to close out their accounts ; what do you expect
I say again: $450 in two years.
Got in with the hype at 513.00. Next Tuesday is the earnings report. Anyone who think it will break 540?
You're lucky this market has momentum otherwise this would be down at least 40.00 bucks NFLX misses revenue and poor guidance with growing competition is serious
Dead money
"If a stock has had a huge run up before earnings, sell it before the announcement!"
"plz, go above 380"
NFLX party under Trump is over. This will be under $100 next year. Too much debt.
$400 in no time. Buy buy
Below 460 by Friday
"I won't voice my opinion on the abortion issue.

Like this stock but decided to sell and take a nice profit. Hoping to buy back at lower price. Good luck to all.
"Consumer inflation is rising much slower than expected, so there is no good reason for the Fed to raise interest rates too quickly. JMHO"
Once profit takers gone...this Will skyroket to 350$ tomorrow by END of the Day. Chek the previous charts...after earnings people take profit..but the 3 following Days it only goes Up. History Will repeat itself and to 375$we go
selling at 662
Strong
"Shorts are in big trouble tomorrow, 52 week high by Friday. $537 now."
"This market is totally #$%$. I see more and more evidence that Single stock targeted with unthinkable. This slight beat in subscribe, meet EPS and list of underlying problem including large negative cashflow, competition, There is no way this stock should move $50+ (almost 25%) in 4 days. Some large and powerful group increasingly target stock that move higher and do unthinkable.Spike to 250 make sense given lot of excited momentum player but they don't bid up stock like this after such spike. This is not something that suddenly become favorite among investor.This is main reason I will exit this market. This market totally manipulated and I wonder if Some very serious crime going behind scene."
"If the stock did not crash with a poor earnings report, can you imagine where it would be with a excellent Q3 earnings! My guess is 600."
"For those who haven’t seen a bubble burst, take a front row seat."
shorts take profits today before option expiration tomorrow. after shorts covering Nflx will tank Monday next week
If your trading account looks anything like mine months ago you should do something about it. Since I joined (http://Thetraderguide.com) my account has been sizzling. Join them today…
"Not complaining, but what's with the sharp increase?"
shorts never learn
"If you think last quarter was bad (they just added 600K new subscriptions that too probably through tmobile, etc. free ones) when schools were closed, just watch this quarter. They might lose customers. This biggest manipulation in recent history will go under 100. Just look at the debt. Remember NFLX bonds are called junk bond for a reason."
Crazy how I can go from optimistic at 4am at $520 and now it’s down to $485. I was going to take some more off the table in my stocks today. This news totally screwed up my day. I’m glad there is hope for a vaccine but the timing is horrible for me naturally. Welcome to life. Hopefully today presents profitable trading opportunities to offset loses.
"why is the ""Top Reaction"" still ""Cold weather mean indoor movies."" Hahahah LMAO. Please, let's get new reactions.Netflix is hot right now. The upgrades are coming for a reason. They are very well positioned. If Netflix needed to raise cash, they are easily able to do so. These are smart people on the board, this is an investment, not a cash cow. I think they should raise our pricing 2-$3.00 per account. They have produced a product people love and yearn for more of. It makes sense, while still keeping the cost of subscriptions relatively low. Me personally, would rather pay a couple dollars more, than see ad pop-up's everywhere. Thoughts?"
are we seriously about to hit an ATH AFTER EARNINGS 
Run Forrest run. Shorties better run for cover cause 600 here we come.
"I read that just before the earnings, there is always a sell off. Any thoughts on this. I have not had the stock for long."
Netflix has 42 of the top 100 shows (TV series and movies). When they get past 75 of the top 100 shows they will start raising prices by 20% every year.
Will be in the red by end of day
With its Oscar nomination Netflix demonstrated their films can garner awards. This will in turn entice producers and directors to make movies for Netflix who crave recognition. This is big deal....what we are seeing folks is the beginning of Netflix taking over hollywood
Like NFLX a lot and IQ rocket still very undervalued 500% Upside possibles to match valuations
Shorts are spamming and lying because they know they will be lemon squeezed real hard soon
I told you shorts a few days ago nflx was forming a base for the next leg up
this will reach $350 tomorrow
"If you're destin to own this stock through earnings with a target price of 365.00 check out the buying the jan 25th calls for 7.75 one contract will cost u 780,00 includes the commision. 1 contract equals 1,000 shares of NFLX stock. Much less risk if your objective is a great earnings call since you can only lose your 780.00 original buy price if out of the money however, if it doesn't crash you still have a time value. My point is don't end up paying 33k on 100 shares of stock you will lose way more than 800.00 if it turns against you. I tried to explain as simple as I could that trading options is fun with much less risk and NOT hard as long as you have a plan. GL"
Who ever is not buying Netflix at these prices should go get a job at McDonalds!
"Netflix since inception gave a great product with exceptional value to its customers. They have not strayed from that mission and that mission worked very well for them in the form of customer loyalty to the brand. Consumer knows that there are not that many companies out there that are customer centric, to name a few like Costco. Netflix could have made a boatload more of money but instead focus on delivering quality product at reasonable cost."
"A community organizer has a show on NFLX, how ?"
Cramer was arrested 10 minutes ago. Booyah !
"Last 15 mins to get in, opens $390's tomorrow"
Next step is to raise the sub fees. Need more free cash flow without relying on debt!!
"I knew it will turn green soon so I can ad shorts its just 6,2% from my adding point."
Congrats longs!! Take profit at some point today my friends. @Anonymous... I won!
"just sold 1/3 at 331, hope I don't regret"
"Nice jump today. Let's keep it up! Streaming will grow, albeit slower in this country, and faster overseas."
Green today
When this reaches 300 and 25% down I will buy.
long run with this. hoping it will be 500 end of year
Green is coming
Thanks for the cheap shares in nflx and amzn. Glad I had 1/3 in cash after taking recent profits. Remember this was $360-$380 before covid and now they are much stronger. Could stock go lower tomorrow? Of course but I’m confident this will be $550-$600 by end of year or early 2021. Amazon should be $3500-$4000. You make money when you buy. Today was a money making opportunity if you’re smart and patient.
"Its a Solid Good Holding, NOW THAT the drama is gone, its on its way back up"
Netflix removing Apple app means subscriber growth is strong baby.
"MUST READ:::: Food for thought on NFLX (and all other high flyers)....each time price targets got lifted (on nflx) when it was at all time highs, it dropped over 20% every time, BEFORE going higher. Take early Jan 2018, target went to 350 (price was at 287), then dumped to 236. Then again in March, target was 400 (price was at 334), then dumped to 271. Now we are at 400 all time high and 500 is new target. Price will dump at least 10% BEFORE going higher...350-360 range will hit again soon. Don't read the hype on this stock...its being swing traded by big-cap on and off wall street. So, NFLX will dump soon BEFORE GOING MUCH HIGHER then 400...watch an learn....we swing traders make way more in long-run. We lock in profits on each run. Mostly we go LONG till new highs break, take profits, then capitalize on pullbacks with shorts... then hop right back in LONG at lower levels. PLUS, we dont risk losing large portions of our gains if something really bad happens. Much safer to swing trade...just need a good coach and trading group."
Market going green. New news out 
There is a lot of money to make here. Possible $340 by Tuesday next week.
$400 by Friday
Where is the momentum? Has NFLX lost its mojo?
$580+ tomorrow?
Roku guided lower...should help NFLX who already guided much higher.
These bears that have been predicting total destruction each quarter have been saying this since Netflix was 50 bucks. Now its 600% higher in a few years and on the cusp of hitting a new gear in growth with India and with a lower tax rate. What credible evidence is out there that all of the sudden this is going to reverse course? It's not happening gents. $400 by end of year easily.
this stock is worth $50 buckstrading places will verify that
I wish i had bought this stock back in jan
it's absolutely shocking to see so many of you baffled by the drop today. smh
NFLX once again saving my portfolio. <3
Below 500 by Friday
Netflix will close between $435-$450 after earnings report.
Netflix has corrected more in the past. It will recover.
Netflix pre-market up good. Will break 370 today at open. Train headed to 450!
"The last 2 or 3 times this stock has climbed to 299 to 300, that's normally the high for the day. After 2 pm the stock starts to tumble. They must be day trading nflx big time."
A lot of time I feel like I am all powerful and only I can save the market.How? I simply sell my shares. And stock is guaranteed to instantly go up after that.
"Ignore the goofs below, NFLX will be 400 in no time at all. DIS, AMZN, HBO, none of them will ever do anything to the great NFLX, that you can be sure of."
In B4 the $NFLX run 
This is probably going over 600. Very strong earning reaction. Usually this stock will find any reason to fade and sell off after earnings pop.
"400 soon !! All shorties, thanks for your purchase to push share price much higher."
tomorrow will jump up. let see. 427+
"Q1 Earning, Beat expectation, raise guidance => Stock was trading 330 and in couple day drop to 310.Now Q2 Earning:- Miss Q2 est by big margin, reduce future guidance => Stock still trade 380.What a great market. Stock is overvalue at 310 even after rosy picture, it's now way overvalue with downtrending picture as well but no long care here."
No real buyers here other than the bots that keep this from falling precipitously.
"Almost made back the loss from yesterday. Only opened .02 in the red. Then dropped 3.44 from there. Bit spike from there at 10. High for the day was 360.45. Still the highest since October.Up 11.50 for the week, 19.59 for the month and 91.41 for the year.Should have a big surge next weeks because of the Oscars."
Believe it or not: NFLX may try to hit $300 mark next week!
Im out
How many ppl here use cable tv in here?.. Just wonder.... How much for a month you have to pay?..
Always remember if your short what your looking at 126 P/E 10 billion in debt after a keep the lights on junk bond sale of 2 billion. Its pump and dump manipulation there is no value here long term only endless hype with a massive debt reality topped with aging technology that every tech entertainment co is now throwing their hat in mix.
all eyes on it! I’m positioned for a breakout but have already reduced some! $PDD $NFLX $WIMI
290 by Friday.
340 calls up 500%
"I dont understand how an 11b in debt with junk bonds with 3b in cash and equivalents that year after year burns through cash can justify a 129 pe. Now even their product is being attacked with Apple, Disney etc..Honestly Im not being sarcastic I really want to know what are Longs thinking long term? Maybe its me and Im missing something?"
up up up
Lots of folks still stuck in using old models to think about new companies. TSLA is a good example of why old models don't work. AMZN took years to turn profitable. NFLX is no exception. Can't use what worked for GE on the new economy. Plus GE is half dead in case you are not following the news.
Don’t short just buy getting ready to sky 
Why do you guys come on here every single day to say this thing is crashing to (insert dollar amount) by (insert date)? It’s only gone up. It goes up every single time you guys say it’s crashing.
Netflix feels like the titanic:<[
what about NFLX tomorrow?
Warner Bros. will launch every 2021 movie on streaming services
Congratulations. I just pushed up the premarket price by $2/share. You're welcome.
The Queen Gambit series added in my opinion a billion dollar value to the company
Looks near to breakout $GOOG $NFLX $WIMI
Looks like we are headed to 50 day moving average around 350
SHORT WILL GET SQUEEZED SO HARD
"Just follow the analysts who pump NFLX - they were never wrong... ever. They have it all figured out in their spreadsheets so while Netflix is burning $2 billion per year, the spreadsheets guarantee a huge return!"
First 4-day losing streak since going 6 days in the read from April 18-25
here come the climb XD
$370.00 on the HORIZON !!
April Calls on NFLX are through the roof.
It’s starts like this and thing BOOM 
370 let’s do this boom
Below 500 by end of day
Netflix site traffic drop 13% from Jan to feb.https://www.similarweb.com/website/netflix.com#overview
Hearing that $AMC is possibly coming out with streaming service to compete with $NFLX
Time to shine don't bother with amc gme koss they are all going to crash hard .....Buy netflix a legitimate solid company
it looks to have finally broken through that resistance! let's see tomorrow
Netflix alone is saving my portfolio from all my other stinkers today!
"Subs and Revenue are up, just didnt hit what people thought it would by small margins. Now down 13% and all the nflx bashers are rejoicing? NFLX still strong, sowwwwwyyyyy."
what a comeback
220 Monday
"Sold at $395, will buy back around $375-$380"
"I think this election today could def affect NFLX. If the lefties get in, watch for strict lockdowns (which will be good for NFLX). I used to laugh at the conspiracies when both sides in the past would scream about election stealing and fraud, but with what I saw the DNC do in the primaries in 2016, and from what came out in my own state a few short years ago (and there were prosecutions) I don't laugh anymore. The DEMS really could steal this thing...."
let me se 100 usd down and meaby just meaby the give me a clip abot overlent portfolios on retailer traders on my lokal tv tomorrow.
"My friend has 2,000 shares of NFLX when NFLX = $411 in 6/22 value =$822,000. He bought NFLX at $364. In 6/25 he panicked and sold all his 2,000 shares at $392 and cashed out $784,000. Now NFLX closed at $401.40 after hours and if he buys NFLX at $401.40 he will recoup only 1,953 shares. Should he buy immediately when the stock market opens or wait til the price drops to at least $395 if ever it will, Or you think it will? What's your advice?"
This is the growth / momentum stock King of Kings
will it turn green today I bet you it will
"Yep, reach my estimated $335 today..Hope reach $350 by the end of the week... thumb up for this"
Any buying is met and overwhelmed with quick selling.
"I should know this, but for tax purposes is a stock transaction based on initiation date or settlement date? If it's settlement date wouldn't a transaction initiated today settle next week?"
Netflix is expanding foreign language original programming that will drive subscriber growth beyond expectations.Company has unappreciated and unexploited pricing power.
Netflix competition just got stronger
I predict a near identical daily chart today as compared to yesterday. Flat to down by EOD.
"it will reach $390 today, Lot of ppl bought $400 calls"
"So I have 1,015 NFLX shares which I bought at $380. When it spiralled down to $382, I sold my shares at $392. Then when it is rising, I was only able to buy 983 shares. So I lost 32 shares. Now NFLX is $418.97, that means I lost 32 shares x $418.97 = $13,407.04. I have forever lost 32 shares. I realized not to be so greedy. I also realized to trust the fundamentals which convinced me to invest in NFLX from the very start. My move is against the advise of my fund counselor who also managed the rest of my funds. I have to learn from Buffett to choose a stock wisely, buy and hold it for the longest time."
better cover now shorts...more pain to come.
Hundreds of thousands canceled over the weekend and states now looking into criminal activity on this. Bad time to be in on this stock. Short field day at the open.
I got my shares (few) at $188. I'm not selling anytime soon!
"Lovely discount - panic sell, back up tomorrow :) thanks guys"
Futures are up
"new shows are horrible...whats up with all these yuppie soap operas & depressing sci fi shows....even their documentaries about crime & serial killers are boring, you can watch better stuff on youtube...their big budget standup comedy is atrocious, that #$%$ died 20 years ago.....FUBO is the future.....smart team that really understands enertainment & what people want out of streaming...."
NFLX==the lest likely FANG stocks==
Gonna make a run to 315-320
Time for NFLX to go...
am I seeing +5% after hours?
"Told you. These kinds of run ups into Earnings are not good. MM trickery more often than not.Probably hit the 50dema ~373.97 tomorrow and if you are long, you better hope it holds."
Do you like to watch the lion king 50 times in a row and star wars cartoons with a banal plot and poor graphics paying $ 7 for this or the original diverse content of Netflix? Disney is growing due to crazy investor support and when the week passes we will look at the situation objectively
Back to 330's by end week..
"50% miss on domestic and 25% miss on international. Stock should be down $100, not $50"
"Are his calls worth paying attention to? I don't know. Maybe. He was against GPRO. That worked. ""Citron stayed away but finally time to short $NFLX.

"People realizing it was an over-reaction to a decent earnings, load up before it touches 500$"
Oh the humanity...!
The market will do its best to separate you from your shares but if fails to do so and you pick the right stock you will do very well. Long term shareholders in Netflix have done very well.
"market is coming back today, its going to go past 360 again"
This is the best place for stock market news. Everyone is always correct about everything.
$160 tomorrow
Grab if before earnings if you can. I trust Netflix. They never overstate their subscribers growth im expecting a subscription growth on 6.7mil in total this Quarter.
-20% drop correction territory
High today should be at least $351....
80% chance Apple and Amzn will buy all companies in the world in 2020 and our world will be renamed as Amazon Apple from Earth.
"Will be green before the market closes. Nothing is allowed to go down, comrades."
Imagine how bad the selling will be if it loses that post earnings 344 level.
Dis will be the new streaming king IMO!
Greed obviously takes over your value for liberty! Shame
"At Netflix old subscription pricing I did not really care if I watch it or not, but now it is so expensive I have to think if I really need it?"
"The company burned through about $3 billion last year and is expecting to do so again this year. To offset the negative cash flow, Netflix has been borrowing heavily to pay for programming. The Los Gatos, California, company had accumulated nearly $12 billion in debt before borrowing another $2 billion in an October bond offering."
pre-earnings run is starting
Not only is it nice to see nflx and amzn having good days but garbage stocks are continuing to tank. Nio and friends jumia etc. a little bit of sanity is nice once in a while.
"I hope to see $350 ---- Earnings, Earnings, Earnings :)"
Chart looks like Bitcoin
295 is the first support ..
I've been saying it for months. This had to happen. 800 is next stop.
$550 coming up
"Great short term, but long term is difficult with original content when DIS and Warner leaves Netflix to start their own Netflix. "
Almost bought the $297.50 calls for $0.01. Missed opportunity. NFLX has been itching for a breakout. No stopping this now.
everybody take a deep breath and relax; add a few shares down here
Shorts will have to cover their positions next week and NFLX will go even higher!
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/netflix-inc-nflx-ceo-reed-001516755.htmlReed Hastings sells shares on 2/19/2019
I shorted 300 again at 322. Again 1200 short and My Average is $308 for short. Plan to cover 300 at 317.I decide to trade instead selling put because stock moving very fast and once I sell cover put can't do trading. I also hold couple $320 Calls with $1K premium. I am hoping it expire out of money. But May sell couple of put for those soon in order to limit my looses.
Under Trump MAGA this stock will see 800/share
My call contracts are up 58% I Love Netflix!!
Netflix just announced a massive number of movies & Tv shows coming in December.!! 
"Netflix is the stock version of the crypto craze. Everybody is just buying Netflix due to the name recognition, and because they see it always going up and they have the fear of missing out on the seemingly never ending gains. It worked for Bitcoin...until it didn't. I wonder how long this will keep adding billions to the market cap every day with no fundamentals to back it up?"
Mark my word too. Going higher
I think it will come back to 400 tomorrow
back to 400 by the end of this week
I have only 500 short. out of that there is 1 315 put and one 295 put I sold yesterday. So only 300 short. Considering to sell 290 put for those. I think market will recover at least once before enter into bear market trend line.Let me know your opinion. Show I sell 290 put for rest or not.
Hahahaha told ya! will be green today!
Lazarus rising from the dead?
1 yr Price Target: $79.00
We must be near a market top when Netflix rises $84/sh for a mediocre earnings performance. WOW!
Way way overpriced.
"I watch real TV, not Netflix"
"I made a mistake and went long too early with this, expecting a bounce back when it dropped below $300. Market seems to want to take this down more, and I remember several rides this year on the way up when it would go up for 6 or 8 days in a row. I now fear it could do that on the way down. The one piece of good news with this is the sub growth, which is going to beat expectations once again, but that is 3 weeks off. Cant hang on that long if this keeps grinding down. I will likely bail tomorrow if another red day. Good luck to longs."
Like I said yesterday...expect more selling.
"longs are here to bask in their success, shorts are here to brag about losing money and share conspiracy theories"
"El Camino, The Irishman, The Witcher this Q vs BM Bandersnatch, The Birdbox, Haunting of Hill House in the same Q last year. Last year they added 8.8 million subscribers in Q4. They should add more than that this Q with a stronger slate of new shows."
$370 coming
I SHORTED 2000 SHARES
so what disney is doing is saying they are offering PBS kids shows 24 hours a day for $7....when PBS kids is free on public TV.
Can we at least close above 380???
And my feeling was right. Been waiting for this all quarter. NFLX a huge thanks.
"If NFLX announces a stock split, $600 will be taken out."
350$ by April 30th
"NFLX or TSLA, which one is better potential in the short term?"
Whatever this ER this should close at 470 this week
"Nflx always runs pre earnings. Held that $500 nicely, here we go boys get ready. $550+ coming soon!!"
The old Netflix stock that I know usually ends the day like this up 8%. This one is just about half way..
Will this hold 580 today? Or will it PLUMMET?
"Yea right Joe blow , this is still a growth stock ."
What a day....:-)
Where is larry who predicted oil price will fall and NFLX has nothing to do with Iran Deal?
This one's gonna keep going up. like tesla. still not too late to buy some.
I sold my remaining shares around $520. My take is we all know Netflix is doing great and will likely post a great quarter. The problem is their outlook will be compared against 2020. While I think 2021 will be a strong year for nflx I think people will focus on comparisons to 2020 sub adds. I’m guessing it probably sells off on earnings. If it does so I will look to get back In.
"450 by Friday, going up"
"We are looking at our 3rd RED Friday in a row.If it says RED for the day, it will be the 10th in the last 12 weeks that Friday ends in the red, and 14th of the last 17."
I only own 10 at 332.00 USA I'm Canadian love Netflix
"She looks weak now, but she always surprises you.I bought calls about 30 minutes ago. I'm expecting a surge soon."
"It’s either a buyout or killer subscriber growth , it moving up rapid well in advance of earnings"
"I think Netflix marketing cost is key to watchout. Their growth likely good but if marketing cost ballooned, it's serious problem. This is even before Disney and Apple Launch. So you can imagine what would happen when they launched.Netflix trying to get as many subscriber as they can before probably but again that's very risky strategy."
"Shame. Everyone and their friends move all the $$ to TSLA. No one else has a chance. 350 points later, Nflx up less than 9 points."
"Impressive volume all week in a narrow trading range, excellent base!"
Trust me Netflix gonna rocket up as same like TESLA did after hours. Hold long. A good news will likely move NETFLIX over 500$. Have patience.
This sell off is the biggest lol today:DDD
"On DIS balance sheet find where they value ""content,"" then compare it with NFLX ""content."" DIS has prixar, disney children's movies, stat wars, marvel, lions gate?, etc. Whose ""content' looks overvalued? This ""content"" cost is amortized over time and makes up nflx's largest expense. So by slow walking the amortization you make the company look more profitable. What does nflx have in content that would total $9B in value?"

Congrats to all the shareholders! This is a great start for the FAANG+M group.
"btw, Longs...don't fret. NFLX is fine..."
365.64 High just got taken out This is on the Roll. Go ahead shorts short it now if you got what it takes
I’m looking for 391 today!
If we clear 370 watch out. Accumulating is over time to take this baby higher.
Just stopped in to point and laugh at the numerous shorts that claimed it was dropping to $250
"Todd Gordon was on CNBC after whiffing badly on his short trade. He tried desperately to say it won’t break out to new highs. After slamming earnings/subs and guiding next quarter for more than expected subs! His take is nothing more than arrogant and self serving. Like most of these other so called “experts” who lowered their estimate into earnings, some people never learn. I trust RH! Congrats to all longs...see ya’ll at 500!"
How many trump tweets will it take this weekend to allow his buddies to buy Netflix stock for under 200 per share?
"CRISPR editing is a work in progress. New versions of the technique are being developed, with the intention of improving its accuracy and efficiency. Problems with one particular approach will doubtless act as a spur to innovation in others. $CRSP to me is nothing more than a Baby $TSLA, $NFLX or $AMZN in the stock world! I missed the Amazon run but was able to get $TSLA at $30 $NFLX at $75 and there was plenty of negative press on all of these companies. Bottom line CRISPR editing is part of the Future and when the Stock dips all I see is “Another Buying Opportunity” -"
if they can run up tesla and bitcoin are they going to run up netflix?
"HAHAHA this will crash, they dont keep enough new shows and movies to sustain increases"
Ozark is coming
Any opinions on how high this can go? I only own 100 shares but a lot for me. Thanks
"OMG the effects of the UBS downgrade could last 2-3 hrs, those analysts are so influential, LOL"
Looking at 600 tomorrow
The only explanation I can have for this morning’s action is trading in sympathy with stay at home stocks. But that’s not really a fair explanation because this didn’t jump last week with these stay at home stocks. I guess best to ignore the noise and focus on the big picture. Another upgrade and positive news. Should see results soon.
up 27 today.
"$4.99 from Apple, cancelling my netflix..."
Netflix is on stoppable jump on the train
I understand the knee jerk reaction but this is great news for humanity and not bad for nflx in the least. Take advantage of overshoots.
"This is EXACTLY why Netflix remains the BEST OF THE FANGS! Fact is they REMAIN...The ONLY FANG to Beat Top, Bottom and Guidance! In addition where apple is starting to realize there may only be SO MUCH consumers are willing to pay for an I Phone(Now 1000-1500?) Netflix 1 Dollar increases here& there to improve content are barely perceptible!"
NFLX could give away free subs and burn cash for the next 10 years and this market would still reward it.
Their foreign growth potential is through the roof and that is where the real future growth lies. India is just now is now just in the first inning and NFLX is well positioned there. A market much larger than USA. Ditto for Southeast Asia. The next two ER’s will be blockbusters (no pun intended) as Q3 and Q4 normally are and this current price will look dirt cheap. Amateur hour selling this morning and that’s why I bought in at the open and made $30/share. I am not a trader I buy and hold. This baby had a long way to go. IMHO
"If we open between 369 and 370, look for the high to be at least 372. If it goes above that, it's a bonus."
will reach the 420 or better level before they report earnings on 7/16
Are you shmucks that were posting $280 still out there?
Eddy Cue just said Apple is not in the business of making big acquisitions like NFLX. But still all-in on media content.
$503.33 critical today.
"Amazon almost caught Netflix several years ago and then Netflix pulled away. Now Disney will try it. They have no choice, streaming is the only thing the stock market is willing to reward them for."
"Okay everyone I have something to admit. The reason I'm trying to warn everyone on this is that God came to me in a dream and told me my position would fall. It was the night of the 5th I had this dream. I dreamt that I woke up the morning of November 8th (3 days later), looked at my phone as I routinely do, and saw a sudden drop down to $266.61 per share. It was between a $57 and $60 per share drop. I did my same drive routinely into the office having to pretend everything was okay, when it really wasn't. The dream felt so real, but I still thought it was a bunch of garbage until I saw this go near $328. I'm heeding God's warning to me now. I sold my position around 10:30 this morning. I know most of you on here won't believe me, but I had to get this off my chest. I don't want to see my brothers and sisters suffer tomorrow."
"UBS takes a breather on Netflix, ""We view the stock as a less compelling risk/reward at current levels..""https://seekingalpha.com/news/3369611-ubs-takes-breather-netflix"
Bought a few shares in AH yesterday at 345 and change. Just sold for 379 and change. Not a bad percentage gain for an 18 hour hold (I'm here to tell ya)!!!
52 week high on Monday. Good luck NFLX long.
"""These stocks have handily benefited from an economy flooded with subscription models, said Boris Schlossberg, managing director of foreign exchange strategy at BK Asset Management. The growing popularity of subscription services, particularly across media, has been key to these names’ success.“They are essentially trading on the fact that they are growing their subscriptions. It really doesn’t matter how profitable they are; it almost doesn’t even matter how much revenue they have. It’s the subscription growth that really attracts them, because then it makes them a candidate for M&A for, probably, old media,” he said Thursday on CNBC’s “Trading Nation.”“Until and unless their subscription growth rate slows down, I think it’s very dangerous to short them at this point. That’s the dynamic that’s really driving them, and that’s the dynamic that could push them even higher as we go from this point,” he added.https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/06/streaming-stocks-are-on-a-tear-and-its-not-just-netflix.html?__source=yahoo%7Cfinance%7Cheadline%7Cstory%7C&par=yahoo&yptr=yahoo"
Could this go green? Very bullish to only be down $1.50 when the CFO steps down. This is one beast of a stock and I have tried to short in the past and been crushed. I am long and expecting a return to $400 this year.
it will be at pre earnings by the end of the week.
"NFLX has plenty for covering, until last support of US$420 and still price target of US$450"
"Any company would jump on the chance to spend on Netflix like growth, however 99.9% of them never get that chance."
"Stopped out, thank goodness. What has happened. Will wait until price stabilization and a slight and consistence upswing."
"*Warning to shareholders* There is a huge boycott campaign starting against Netflix, thousands have already cancelled today, check evidence on Twitter, FacebookLong term prospects are not good, the subscription base is cratering and this company is burning cash.You've been warned"
"CIDM has released content on ROKU and VIZIO and has 1,000s of movies and TV show's and it also has acquired another streaming company way undervalued even at it's current price!!!"
This was totally unexpected! Let's got NETFLIX!
"Goldman and their VIP accts have been buying NFLX right after Chrstimas and even Jan 3rd when all.stocks were.tanking with AAPL warning. they already got 20% less than 1 1/2 wk, probably they will start selling right after it hits 300"
$450 here we come
It’s hard to be positive right now about this stock. Hopefully we see a rotation into names like nflx and amzn next. The market ran big across the board and is at all time highs. Yet nflx needs to go up about 20% to reach it’s all time highs. Ideally right now you’d be taking profits after the big market run. Not only has nflx declined almost $100 in a couple of months. It’s done it during a time of a very strong market. Most of us have cost basis much lower than $575 obviously but you’ve not only been in the red the last couple months here but you’ve incurred a steep opportunity cost. My reason I continue to hold is because the company is doing as well as ever and so many bullish signs with analysts price increases and subs. The disconnect between stock and company has fooled me. Hopefully the road ahead is brighter than today.
boy I hope you didn't short nflx
Netflix revenue growth was 31% last quarter. That is unprecedented growth for a major TV and film company. As they grow content prices as a % of revenue drop which allows them to add more content solidifying their position as the price leader.
up and green like always
"Everyone is afraid that tomorrow will be a down day and selling it AF hours, it is going to be an up day tomorrow."
"The Dow and Nasdaq have been carpet bombing us with numerous large dive bombs on too many days. Dow up 150, up 110, bam!--down 700, etc. Same with Nasdaq. This is not the actions of a bull market. Maybe we are in a new type of market---""Wild Boar Market""?"
getting close to green let's do this!
"For those that missed it:LOS GATOS, CA – June 14, 2018 -- Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX) today announced it will post its second-quarter 2018 financial results and business outlook on its investor relations website at http://ir.netflix.com on Monday, July 16, 2018, at approximately 1:05 p.m. Pacific Time. At that time, the company will issue a brief advisory release via newswire containing a link to the second-quarter 2018 financial results and letter to shareholders on its website."
"Some time back, I bought Amazon, just before earnings report, at $400.00 a share. After they reported, it went down significantly, so out of fear, I sold. I think now, what it would be if I had just held on. Now over $1800.00. Hardest thing to do when investing in the stock market is to have patience. Don't look back some day and wish you had just held on to NFLX."
I just broke my TV
They signed up to pay 100 million to air Friends for another year. To me this is flashing red. This shows you that most of the inhouse productions are not doing much to sustain members.

So AMZN had a great quarter nut weak guidance and NFLX had a great quarter and Great guidance and the stock went down. Does not make sense.
now is time to sell short
"short and hold to 292but do so in piecesa stimulus could take it upI think the PE is out off whack with the competition and should correct. I really needs to correct in a serious way, like get cut in half. Consider the US national debt and crumby job market and conflicts with Iran, China, Russia, Venezuela, ...... . And consider how high bloated the stock market is."
$500 tomorrow. #Conditioner predicted this!
Anyone think this is going straight to 400 from here still?

Bottom line I've had Netflix forFREE 2.5 years. No revs from me.Used to be outstanding. Nowpretty boring. Actually PAIDfor a HBO MAX membership. 100% Satisfaction. If I owned this. I would be cautious ofpumping. Can't go up forever.
$NFLX partnership should sky rocket this to multi pennies
It's all political over reaction filtering over to other parts of our culture. At some point demonizing anyone will be in bad taste. White folks will be just fine. Everyone needs to just calm down and not let media tear up our nation for ratings.
Spoiler alert Netflix has strong earnings beating all the estimates
"To put the $500 price target into perspective, that would be a gain in market cap. equal to the entire TWTR market cap. All at a time of losing DIS content."
"Netflix isnt going anywhere,seems to be dropping less and less every day. Just a matter of time before it goes back up"
"I'm long on Netflix, bought at the beginning of the recession in 2008. Ok to buy on the dip, had several dips/corrections in the last several weeks. But Netflix has a lot of headroom, even with new competition, with more content creation and new markets in China and India, and more shows in Spanish. So buy and hold, even if it is a bit over valued now. Price doubled over last year so some correction is expected."
we just need to get into earning season....this is just weird....still not even average volume trading today.a lot of positive news for Netflix last few weeks...nobody's wrapping their arms around it yet.

Disney report shows subscribers to streaming services are on the rise. Disney and Netflix offer different content. They both benefit from ramping up subscriptions.
"Honestly, Netflix deserves a big thank you from Disney for showing them the path to getting the market excited. If Disney now gets to be valued like Netflix and Roku, the sky is the limit. Netflix was the teacher, Disney was the pupil. The question now is, will the pupil surpass the teacher?"
Most valuable media company. LOL LOL
This is one of biggest market caps in the world that barely makes EPS. This stock always amazes
This happens all the time. It goes down and then right back up up up up. It’s not end of the world
Don't bet against NFLX: it is going to much higher when overall market settles down!
Next stop is 400 they gonna keep raising the price on this stock . Best stock in wall street.

They likely worth $250B valuation in 3 year as it become clear that it's wining market share. (WIth so much superhits kids content, Sports It sure going to take over market share).Apple is disruptor and can take huge pile of money to take over market.

I decide not to sell any put until tuesday next week. And i will stop watching this stock (Except once in two hour) I know this not even worth $300. So I should not worry regardless what happen. Anything go up too fast normally come down. Stock price growing with result is healthy. When it get out of sync it's very risky.
"Do not be deluded by the bounce from 350 to 380 yesterday. When large holders are surprised by bad news, they buy into it and sell their shares to the shorts. Then they exit at their leisure, as they were doing today. No one wants a growth stock which has stopped growing. This should be walked down to 350 again eventually."

"Netflix price target raised to $550 from $420 at Barclays Netflix price target raised to $550 from $420 at Barclays 06:30 NFLX Barclays analyst Kannan Venkateshwar raised the firm's price target on Netflix to $550 from $420 and keeps an Overweight rating on the shares. While Q2 expectations have ""run up significantly ahead of already high guidance,"" the key driver is likely to be Q3 guidance where expectations are ""relatively subdued"" due to company commentary earlier in the year and a tough comp versus Stranger Things last year, Venkateshwar tells investors in a pre-earnings research note. Netflix is one of the few content services with a full content slate which, combined with sports uncertainty, could continue to be a tailwind, says the analyst."

"FYI, to all LONG-term investors that plan to hold NFLX no matter what....take AMZN for instance, even tho it shot up from 100 to 1700+..it still had several 10-35% pullbacks (100 to 350 pullbacks). For example, the first big pullbacks happened after 400 broke back in early 2014 and a few months later it was at 284, every big breakout was followed by a 10-35% pullback. Just look at AMZN chart. So, if you guys plan to just hold, great....no need to be on here. but SWING TRADERS, deff licking our chops here and are practically guaranteed big pay day on this next pullback. Come join us and get access to Day Trader Josh's setups. He goes both LONG&SHORT at key levels on NFLX (more points on LONGS, but at least 20 points on shorts)....locked in profits. male way more in long-run when you short the pullbacks, then ride it back up to new highs. This is the time to swing NFLX."
"Netflix price target raised to $750 from $660 at Pivotal ResearchPivotal Research analyst Jeffrey Wlodarczak raised the firm's price target on Netflix to $750 from $660 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares.

Further, management officially confirmed they no longer need outside capital to fund their business, and raised their 2021 free cash flow forecast to flat from negative $1B, adds the analyst. He expects Netflix will continue to demonstrate pricing power ""as the service remains a relative entertainment value for best in class entertainment."""

"After rising 24% for the week it closes right on the high. Year over year subscriber growth remains unchanged at 25% after raising prices and investors continue to figure out what it means. For instance, Netflix could double it's subscription fees and settle for only 5% subscriber growth. In a year revenue would be 30B/yr, profit before tax would be 16B/yr and PE 7. Adjust for a normal PE of 20 and the stock would be 785. We could see the stock continue to spike next week."

"Just my opinion, but this decline is way overdone. Yes the PE ration is high; no doubt! But it isn't much higher than Amazon. They did predict that they wouldn't do so well in the immediate future; but as I said, it's a prediction, which at this time amounts to no more than speculation. As such, it doesn't merit a 20% decline in a little over 2 weeks."
"Netflix price target raised to $628 from $615 at JPMorgan, OverweightJPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth raised the firm's price target on Netflix to $628 from $615 and reiterates an Overweight rating on the shares.

Wells Fargo & Company MN now owns 1,934,754 shares of the Internet television network’s stock worth $371,396,000 after purchasing an additional 354,801 shares during the period."
Every penny gained off the earnings report...gone.
Netflix will be worth buying when they start offering more movies and content I want to see rather than just their own stuff...Its not all bad but come on...
"So all the cheer leading over the weekend might have created this artificial move higher. And the cheer leading includes the white house. Its really hard to trust at this point. What to do here is the question? I feel like this should be much higher as well , perhaps fund managers are dumping into strength. We will see, meanwhile finger on the trigger to sell. If we are in a bear market then share prices will be brought lower during earnings for many techs, regardless of the numbers. Just my 2 cents."
NFLX is a buy at any price. The NFLX rocket defies financial gravity. Traditional valuation metrics do not apply to this company because the the story is so overwhelmingly compelling.
"Buying opportunity for sure. Look at your history here...every sell off has turned into a chance to buy and make money. The sub model they have blew it this quarter, but they set the bar low for next quarter and they’ll beat it handily. This is always the weakest quarter with little new content. Add to that the fact that they’re just in their infancy in Asia. Short term pain down to 320 in the near term, but up up and away is the long term destination."
Well now we all know why $NFLX was up yesterday. People in the know were front running the upgrade this morning. Kind of blatant but we know nothing will happen.
Investigation needed
"This is setting up just like yesterday, looking for a close 315-318."
reaching heights
I think that direction is below $358...
The Michelle Wolf effect.
Cash flow positive in 2021 and 8.5 million adds. Wow !
May be buying at@t not a bad idea after all. 6% plus yield is tempting.
Money looks for places to grow...the ten year gives you below 3...Apple missing 10B in sales....margins decline...Amazon lowered its outlook(not growing as fast). Netflix is the beauty of them....Simple. Z
Netflix stock price target raised to $480 from $435 at Pivotal Research
And to think this was 140 at one time last year I guess we wait till next year
congrats to all the longs today. Even Apple went up.
"Let me get this straight. NETFLIX now has more than double the market cap of Ford. Just think about that for a moment. How is this ever going to be justified unless they hike rates to like $50+ per month, or add another 500M subs?"
Woo hoo! It's a great day to be in Netflix land.
people hate to see success when they have no idea how to obtain it.
Excited and scared at the same time ahahahh
After earnings report yesterday they already got around 40.000 new paying members!
"The hits just keep on coming, Amy Adams Thriller ‘The Woman in the Window’ Heading to Netflix from Disney-Foxhttps://collider.com/amy-adams-the-woman-in-the-window-netflix/"
Netflix is the Tesla of movies streaming
"Runs up into the close. We finish at 212.45. Tomorrow sells off a little but ends up 1.25 (213.60). Wednesday up 2.40 (216), Thursday up 2.80 (218.80), then Friday runs to finish at 220. There's the week. Very simple. Next week up another $10. Big move will come on Wednesday 1/23. I'm expecting a $20 move up to $250. All on subscriber growth. That's the only things that powers this. Not EPS (usually comes in a few cents over or under). Not cash flow (always big negative). Just subscribers relative to estimate, which is always sandbagged low (cant believe if analysts actually wanted to hit it they would just add 2-3 million to whatever the consensus guess is). They will easily beat this quarter."
"I was holding 5- 320 contracts @ 28.00 - Guess how much I'm cashing tomorrow. 60.00 x 500 shares - Well that will be a direct deposit of 30K in the morning - I'm going drinking, my nerves are shot."
Anyone else think $NFLX is expected to have huge earnings and great new subscriber growth but is probably priced in already so once numbers are released it could go down?
For every negative that comes out for Netflix it’s much worse for other streaming services by comparison. Estimates are for Hulu to lose 2.5 billion this year. It has been competing against Netflix for 12 years! It has lasted that long because of support from all the big media companies. Can any other streaming service do that much better than Hulu? You can’t achieve proper increased spending needed for sustained subscriber growth if you’re losing that much money.
"can NFLX climb to $1,000 a share"
Congrats longs. Very few predicted $400+ ever again. Considering the current circumstances....HUGE win.
"Buy, Hold, or Sell?* Tomorrow is the 31st, End of month re-balance could get re-balanced heavier bonds. * Overbought Technicals* Recent sharp run up following multi-year climb* Lack of Healthy Corrections* Unpredictable earnings (valuations need to be blow out)* Interest rate concerns with Fed Meeting on Friday* Potential bottom in Dollar* High VIXCould be beginning of a small pause before higher or if VIX sky rockets could be rush for the door. First ones out are the Richer ones."
Hulu has over 27 million subscribers compared to 139 million paid subscribers for Netflix. So Netflix has slightly more than 5x the subscribers of Hulu. Yet Netflix is valued at 11x the value of Hulu.

Call your friends, family, banks, your senators, the government, the president, and any other person you to start buying because it’s going all time high very soon. Don’t let the short try to take you down. BULLS ARE STRONG AND READY TO FIGHT TO THE FINISH."
Many subscribers have dropped the service because they became to political in their programming. Annie 's first season was delightful but second season was unwatchable. Political correctness overwhelmed the script. I cancelled and will not return.Programming with Obama and Letterman tipped the scales. Many othe good options available.
Obama and Susan Rice frantically working the phones. Need upgrades ASAP. Funds drop more money into the stock.
"This stock is way over valued with so little actual profit that it could bring to the investors. A company with promising good future is totally different than how much investor can take away from it. After all, these fancy companies are bubbles and will never achieve profitable for investor. This stock should be valued at 100 per share, maximum."
"Guys, do you think AT&T report tomorrow will affect us?"
No other FAANG stock went down as much as Netflix. 7%. I bought more today. Anxious to hear what the shorts say.
This always sells off on earnings
Anyone think I should short Netflix?
Sell now. This is going to tank!! You will thank me for the advice
"I have posted a few times on this board and yahoo does not show them, wonder why? Anyone know?"
Wow...and to think Blockbuster could've bought them for 2 million way back when. Imagine that.

So to recap the general sentiment on every board on yahoo...if a stock moves in the direction you want “yeah! I was right! I’m a genius!” If it moves against you “market manipulation!!!!!!” What a sad mindset has befallen this nation.

"Cable TV is in decline because subscribers pay mostly for distribution vs Netflix subscribers who pay mostly for content. Cable TV is still holding on to 90% of the market so Netflix has a long, long way to go before the ride is over."
"What do you guys think? Is it time to sell and cash in? It is a way overextended rally in no time! I'm up $50M since December 2018. I'm going to cash in EOD anyway but, Your sincere thoughts are welcomed. $NFLX $AMZN $AAPL $AMD $NVDA $CSCO $SQ $SHOP"

I'd like to see 350 but might not get there.
Good luck to all holders. Cramer hasn't done you any favors tonite on his show (personally i find the guy a blowhard... but people seem to listen)
"For all the shorties out there saying the P/E of NFLX is too high, keep in mind that Amazon's (AMZN) is 213, and we all know how that story ended up. Don't listen to the shorties on this, they have money to lose and are trying to get people to panic. They just want a few bucks in the short term, while us longs are making money hand over fist. Everyone knows that NFLX is the entertainment platform of the future and a solid company."

$NVDA $MU $NFLX $AMD $AMZN $FB $AAPL Buyers will get rewarded soon. Prepare to gain massive amount of $$$.
Open 380 and should be already 400. All I’m hearing is very positive news about NETFLIX. Close 380 already
Analysts expect a 40% growth comparing to last year. Wich means we gonna see a new 52 high next week and at least 350$ monday
"you better start accumulating folks..once this train departs, theres no coming back..."
Yes!! Green
Market correction on NFLX was nothing. Very impressive because NFLX will outperform for the next 10 years. Buy and hold and wait for a merger or acquisition. Buy out would be massive by AAPL or Disney.

"Netflix's second-quarter revenue came in at $4.9 billion, in line with both management's guidance for the metric and analysts' average forecast. This represented a 26% year-over-year increase in the company's top line -- an acceleration from 22% revenue growth in Q1."
"Faang bubble, 420 Neflix or 500 Netflix, big holders have hollyday so the bubble is not a problem."
"At least we outpaced Amazon, Disney, Apple with more then 3 times today. Says enough about what investors think about streaming."
I think NFLX is going to blow away both estimates and future guidance. It will be phenomenal. Jmho. Glta longs.
14 min to get in
Last chance to buy under 420!!!!
EVERYONE I talk to about NETFLIX says the same thing. There is nothing good to watch on Netflix AND they were getting tired of the shift to more foreign content.
380+ in 2 weeks. Mark my words!!
I've never had a Netflix subscription. Probably the only one left in the US without a subscription.

"The people who sell today will be the new bears in the coming days talking about what a ""scam"" $ZM is.

Also loading up on $NFLX. $ZM...I'm so up that it can crash to $100, and it is still a non-factor. My portfolio is about 98% up from last year...lol! Invest...not trade!"
I didn’t buy those options but I can see why someone did. This has no business under $520. Even on that good news and stay at home run up this couldn’t hold $490. Roku up another 3%. Zoom and peloton 5-6%. It’s like that across the board. This should have popped at least 2-3%.
The analysts will come out Monday and Tuesday to upgrade this stock. Of course after they and their friends/families bought lots of stock at this level. The price will swing up this week.
they tested a pice increase in Canada and it was a success.
Anybody guess a good entry price for Netflix after the massacre tomorrow? Thanks
"Up 14 of 16 trading days this year. Up $34, which is a 36.1% increase. Market cap has increased $30 billion in those 16 days. Really the only significant news in that time was that they beat on subs by just 1.93 million (they met on rev and EPS). That's a $15.5 million market cap increase for each new subscriber. Wow!!! This is just amazing."
"I LOVE the NEGATIVITY!!! Blood in the water BUY!!! FACTS(Inconsistent with this forum!) They are the only FANG NOT in the cross hairs of Congress, The ONLY Stock to BEAT on TOP/BOTTOM Lines and GROW Subscriber Growth! The only company that can Comfortably RAISE PRICES! N E X T!"
Icahn sold his at around $50/share. If Buffet was lucky enough to buy when Icahn did he would still be holding. He said his favorite holding time is forever. Buy and hold is the best strategy my friends.
"NFLX may not have a good spike tomorrow. We may have to wait 2 or 3 more days for that.With NFLX, though, surprising spikes come unexpectedly, so we may have one tomorrow."

Maybe this is where MSFT begins to see an entry point for an acquisition of NFLX while the stock is depressed and Porter Bibb's prediction becomes reality.
it wasn't a movie that killed our Embassador it is Susan Rice that will chill 50% off the value of NFLX. Sell this poison now

"Netflix (NFLX) has cut a deal with Sirius XM (SIRI) to create a comedy channel for the radio broadcaster. The channel will feature new material from comedians such as Chris Rock, Dave Chappelle, and Jerry Seinfeld, who are featured in Netflix original content."
Hope they announce a dividend soon!

"People can easily cancel (as they advertise) their account if no new contents/shows. Besides 1 in 6 of the people in U.S. had signed up (300 mil population vs. 55mil member) which means market is saturated (family with kids a/c, friends sharing...). I see this would collapse (again) if their contents budget is down or member not meet target. 1 Million missed last quarter says EVERYTHING."

let me be clear... The competition is not going to take away from the current nflx users.They are going to slow new growth and make charging more almost impossible. When people blast Disney's content as old and washed up... you must not know that NFLX is banking on their library holding massive....the cash burn will never end unless NFLX library proves to be desired so much people will pay for it once they slow down the new content that keeps everyone talking
Disney has gained a whopping 1% since april 2015. Investors must have a lot of convidence in Disneys streaming service to make the stock grow that much.
"Is this some kinda joke???? Under 500$..,, Why??????"

Why is she down
Will this realistically hit $430 by the end of week ?

Is is still worth buying in right now ? Or wait for a dip?!
Is this just a short squeeze? Don’t see any news.
Almost to 280! Thanks shorts for your advise!
"I can assume this has to do with the general market, not Netflix, all indexes took a pounding"

I will get back to my old profits if this goes above 310. Hopefully that happens by Tuesday!
Good entry point will be below $300
Mouse is old news. Netflix rules content. Watch for $300+ by end of this month. $350 after earning.
"Upcoming split, solid day 700$ TP"
I can’t even blame people for selling here. Yes it should be over $520 but it doesn’t pay to wait and hold while so much money is being made. I’m still trading a bit but having lots of funds tied up here is definitely a limitation. Just can’t justify selling at these prices. Not in a market near highs. So much speculation is rewarded. Can’t see this not running back towards $600 soon.

NFLX is light years ahead of any competition and it simply needs to execute - in Reed Hasting’s astute leadership, NFLX will continue to flourish."

The downgrade was just a plant by The Boyz so they can gobble it up from weak hands and resell it. Total BS manipulation. NFLX has huge upside. What about the upgrades to 450 -500 and 550. I guess one analyst's downgrade is smarter than the other 3-5 calling for huge gains. 'm not biting on that hook. NFLX 500 plus.

"I cancelled my membership. Why subsidize a network that produced programs hosted my ""Obama"" and ""Letterman"" and other left wing extremest. There are so many other streaming services that stay away from politics. Anne with an E was one Netflix program that was excellent the first season. The second season became so political correct it was unwatchable."
The whole lot of the market is red. This is holding up fine. It will pop 10% in one day. You will see. I seen it done before with a lot of other stocks.
"Of any option out here, I feel more comfortable shorting nflx. Even Cramer said it was overbought. Brake downs past few days signal something real bad is gonna happen soon. In fact the pump news cycle confirms this. They are desperate to get some room to get out above 260"
If most of Hollywood is against the same people that pay their salaries. This is not going to end well when the liberals are trying to burn the constitution.
"I'm sick of this board, what's on Netflix? "
Forward PE 46. This is low for the large growth Netflix will have.
TECH IS DONE! going to 300 by friday
I think the stock is about to really tank. Netflix took on Susan Rice to their board.
"there is no surprise factor for stock to shoot on earnings. everyone knows subscribers added will be high. real question is ,how it will cope-up in 2018 once Disney pull out."
I told you it was a buy at $500.00Now look it's up over $59.00
"These guys sent me a message that my month charge was going up, cancelled it on the spot!"
They predicted beating last quarter up 143% from last year
This is the place to be but one more price increase after this one to subscribers and they will start cutting. People already walked away from cable.
All we have is a prayer for tommorrow.
Should be green by EOD
"Usually there are number out before earning, no such preview this time. very likely a subscriber miss."
Are we going to have a bounce tomorrow or was today just a precursor to what's to come?
Set the alarm at $280 please
"I do not own this stock, but I am sorry to the people that have bought calls. you are now broke"
"Disney should buy Netflix. Realistically, Disney is way bigger than Netflix will ever be."
So many better places to 'park' your money than this...
Here u go again. A minute ago was just 509.60. Now already 508. Nasdaq is up almost 300 points and this one can’t even go back to 530 before earnings. I can’t imagine if the market is down. Where will that be?
"the hits just keep on coming. Netflix dropped a first teaser for its blockbuster ""The Irishman"" during a commercial for the Oscars. Epic.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfr44G1KJmc"
"If this doesnt fall more then 3.5% in AH, chances are it will be green tommorow"
"I got ""thumbs down"" yesterday for my comment after-hours that Netflix would finish today between $360 and $370 today. I still stand by my comment. A lot of ""big money"" investors are using the pull back as an opportunity to buy more and average down the cost of their position. Others are using this as an opportunity to enter this stock. How many people do you think are willing to take the the bet that Netflix won't hit at least $400/share by next earnings release?"
"This company is one of the best in the market. Just buy it, and chill"
"NFLX is late in taking its second trip to $310 and $306, thanks to the plunge protection operation by some entities.shall we work together tomorrow and drop it down to $306?NFLX is overvalued."
when something takes this type of hit in a single day something is wrong. SELL SELL SELL!
"It was only a couple weeks ago when the shorts were posting that they shorted at $180, $190, $200. Hahaha"
It will be down 75 in the morning
"I bought 1,000 NFLX shares at $370. I enjoyed the ride to $420. But with Q3 Earning forecast lowering down subscriptions and revenues I sold my shares at $358, a loss of $12,000. With upcoming competitions of streamlining by Disney, Amazon, Hulu; NFLX will be hammered down. So I bought 187 shares of Amazon. Amazon has no known competitor to challenge it. Amazon takes 60% of all US online purchases. It’s sad that NFLX is losing its steam. Good luck to those who decide to hold."
LMAO....I bet NFLX bought back much of their stock when everyone else panic and sold.
"Netflix is using Amazon web services to host their content. Time for a change of providers. Amazon can't be trusted. Move the content away, or build your own servers."
The reason Netflix has been stalling out the last few days might be because of the massive inflows into $IQ . Just buy both and you will be very rich!
Come on move like $NFLX is moving now
Well looks like my buy at 384 yesterday looks pretty good today.
Nothing more than a casino. That's all the market is. $50 swings in this stock over the course of weeks and none of it having to do with the company itself.
Are we gone see $650 soon?
netflix to hit 625 this time around.
Looking good so far.
"And that’s why you never sell,never know when takeoff is"
Anyone got any stock tickers that are low in price but a great company with monthly dividends to drip? And go.
is it going to 350 before the gain date
"Still not over $300 this morning, come on NFLX, my newest stock, let's go."
I have a great feeling about today!!!!!
"AXXA, check out market cap vs revs. It's a diamond of a stock"
"Funny how everybody here creates support levels. Seems like every time it goes lower, someone comes up with some kind of support level it has to hold."
"I don't know what to say, but nflx stock price is so weak these days."
"If you call your broker at lunch and he tells you to buy this dip, ask him how many shares of nflx he's bought today."
If it goes up today. It would be an Ascending Triangle breakout. Time to cover short and go long.
2% subscription growthPE 130AMZN PE 83Dis PE 16AApL PE 17CMCSA PE 17NBCHBODirect TVHulushould correct to $130 per sharecommon sense
it is heading to $560 at today's closing
So Disney + has 85+ M subscribers in year and has several new titles coming out this year. Netflix seems outmatched added 30M in the same year with a 6 year head start. They could catch Netflix next year in total subscribers.
What was the revenue amount this quarter compared to this expectations?
What you guys think will be the price after today’s earnings?
Disney plus up to 73m from 60m. Streaming is the future.
in a swift move of a hand we have recovered..... up only 199% now....
"RED LIGHT HOLLAND CSE.TRIP, thank me later"
maybe netflix will hit 280
Good luck Longs. Hopefully we see amazing numbers 
I am just going to walk away from my screen. Getting eye strains looking at all this red.
"some techinicals suggest a sell off50 dma 313100 dma 290 rsi over 70if it sells off, it might be 20 points or morethere is a gap at 325, maybe it will go there to fill the gapconsider the growing debt and PE of 283, would be nice to see it go to the 100 dma at $290. That's a 63 point drop from here. If the earnings isn't so hot, or subs, the price might drop below the 100 dma and that will become resistance for a while. Imagine all the stops below. There may be 10's of millions of shares that were purchased below a dollar or not purchased, maybe handed out to management."
"Not what we Longs wanted but OK...Good enough to keep most of the gains from the December lows and that's what counts....If it was as bad as the Haters claim, we'd see the stock price trading down $30 - $50 ...Simple fact...So ...you can ignore the Blow Hards...."
They keep touting the low price of Disney vs Netflix. But that is the basic plan. So who knows what the full price plan is? Anyone?
"I set to sell short $420, but it is struggling to get up $420. It went up 2 days, I expect going down the third day, then will go back up again the 4th day. I anticipate a large drop after ER. If DIS has 50 million subscribers, at least 5 million came from NFLX"
"At Thanksgiving everyone wants to say ""I sold my nflx at $420. Who would admit to missing that window?"
"When would this recover? 1-2 years? I am long since it’s peak around 390 and wonder if it’s time to limit loses and move on or let it be. If good earnings and subscription growth did not move this stock up, what will?"
"With tariffs now in place on most other goods, a Netflix subscription looks relatively cheap, maybe the company should consider raising subscription fees next year. JMHO"
"Overvalued by any measure, projections are just that, projections, 20 times earnings get this to the real value of 50 per share."
This happened when I bought at $114 and it dropped to $85. Glad I didn't sell :)
I bet we’ll be surprised how well it holds up today even with the big cut and debt worries this board will push.
That's it. I'm buying WMT for its streaming business
so buying 1 share of netflix gets u $2.80(no dividend) and that 1 share costs u $319.96. So right now you are giving someone $319.96 dollars for the right to get $2.80 in a year. Ya that makes sense.
NFLX $550 BEFORE EARNINGS!!! Look at the yearly chart and you'll see 
Streaming BUY
NFLX setting up for a massive short squeeze.
"From just over 2 USD in 2008 to 586,34 USD in 2021.Quite impressive."
OH BABY ITS SHOWTIME
Charts show NFLX breaking out over $500 this year. Market cap is still very low relative to earnings and potential. This stock is still in the first or second inning of a great game still to come. There are few stories as exciting as NFLX. Perhaps TSLA is the other rare one.
370 TODAY COME BIG BALLERS START BUYING WE GOT THIS
Streaming is the next wave and Netflix is leading the way.
"BOOM!!! just logged a 100 point SWING gain on NFLX, now BE CAREFUL here my novice traders, NFLX does NOT go straight up, it will get a pullback soon to lower levels (key levels we know), then go long again for another 30 to 50 points. Also, if you know our system there is an easy 20 point SHORT coming up here soon (at key level). Come join us and start logging gains in 2019."
looks like a double top to me.
Great day 300 the first green day
340 today ?
citigroup upgrade to buy
"I'm a data analyst at a Fortune 500 company. I live on Zero Hedge and post here when I'm not busy. I have sifted through the earning report for the past 24 hours (I live in Australia so I am a day ahead of the US). In order to ensure proper vigilance and attention to detail I consumed 200 mg of Adderall spaced out in a bi-hourly schedule. I also have been microdosing LSD for the past three years. I can unequivocally say that there is absolutely nothing profound within this earnings report. It is insubstantial at best, and outright exaggerations bordering on slander at worst. It would likely be in everyone's best interest to focus on more pertinent issues as opposed to getting lost in a web of obfuscation. Given the intense mental output of thorough investigation it is essential that one rest to rejuvenate neural productivity. I suggest going to sleep and completing at least 3 REM cycles before reassessing any further information."
"Disney’s appeal is that it has content for everyone. It’s library will go back more than 75 years. Add to that all the Fox content including 20th century and 21st century fox. Netflix has tons of debt on it’s balance sheet and is still borrowing to this day. Disney owns a massive amount of content, numerous studios to make content at, television networks and doesn’t borrow money to make content. Disney’s biggest deficit is ESPN. If Disney would put the hammer down and stop ESPN from bidding over priced professional sports contracts and return it to a sports news network they could sell or dump it."
The stock is great but all the negative attention is just a drag to wait it out. The Netflix train is slow to climb in price followed by a long long slow bleed
bought more at 332
Oh boy
And the castle in the sky comes crashing down
This is what happen when company pressured from Investor. This is reason I say all along that Raising stock price is not good for company like Netflix. It just push company to make short term decisions that only hurt long term potential.https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2018/06/06/despite-season-2-issues-netflix-greenlights-13-reasons-why-season-3/?utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=partner&utm_campaign=yahootix&partner=yahootix&yptr=yahoo#2c33473b79ae
"Quarter end coming up, no hedgie wants to answer "" you're still in nflx, why didn't you sell at $330?"""
Huge short squeeze
280 PE lul
So happy I bought more Netflix! Very good discount. Wish I had more cash to buy more.
425$ tomorrow 
"Worry not, I predict it recovers at least half of this drop tomorrow. And continues upward. Triple by next July and it's going to have this kind of transient dip again. Predictable every year."
FB money will move to NFLX no other place to go.
"the options market signals a move of 8 to 10% in either direction, at this stage anyone buying is gambling"
Why nobody mentions the fact that $NFLX Earnings are TANKING BIG TIME????
"why is this stock going down? Yes, there is Positive Vaccine news, but it will get worse before its better. A vaccine won't be readily available en masse until Spring. We still have the winter to get through as cases get worse day by day."
Slowly but surely this becomes a mature stock that follows its own path. Not so much up and down with the faang stock or the market anymore. Nice to see.
"What a great buying opportunity here, will be well above 400 by Christmas, IMHO."
'Yo bro...cancelled my Netflix. They raised the price a dollar's. Cool msn...you showed them lol. Z
We need another upgrade from any banks!
NFLX is among the best games in town right now!
love my $zm $pton $nflx :'-)eyes on ACRX climbing on buyout chatter
I'm ready for more juice this morning keep squeezing shorts
"Merry Christmas George, you’re the only normal guy left in this board lol"
Will you agree AAPL offer $345 if having one??
295 today?
Why Netflix is going down? They reported very good earning report. Does not have any impact of trade war. Still down!! Can’t believe this. Any bad news that I am not aware of?
wasn't this at $600 after earnings?? That sure didnt last long.... im a buyer at $250. wont be long now.
I have order in for 100 more at 329. So if it doesn't drop to that I'm making money. If it drops to 329 before it goes back up I'll make even more.
this is a strong stock
up 10 bucks today .imho
We are closing to $360 today!
Add today! NFLX is No.1 stay-at-home stocks! People who quarantined at home have to watch NFLX to kill the time!
"Netflix is not only streaming service, it is international movie studio. So much content coming."
Normal 2-3 day drop then $50-100 surge after good earnings call. Look at past blow outs
selling half at 664 which means i doubled and holding the rest for 5 more years cheers
"Who sold at $200, $195, $190?"
Rate of fall will accelerate
costant growth till monday
NFLX==target lowered to $250 from $480'Strong sell issued today!
it's only 15% after 100%+run-up..........
by any chance of investing Moviepass?
NFLX oversold.....Guess what.....It will rebound because sentiment is negative....Contrarian typical scenario
"I keep avoiding netflix because I don't live the product, but I guess it's time to find a dip to get in."
NFLX will see $350 before $400
Buying!
"obama in and I am out of netflix,"
"Why red,,,,"
No sense in watching it continue to bleed. I’ll give it one more day to stabilize. Portfolio poison right now.
earning next week... Up up up
nflx 438 by end of april.
markets will close red
William Blair loves NFLX
"There are 300 million broadband subscribers in India and Netflix currently has 2 popular original TV series there, Sacred Games and Ghoul. Q3 subscriber adds could be very big."
If we stay above $400 we a definitely going higher
This is worth at least $345
"Looks like the 'cuties' controversy has passed. Americans are so over-reactionary. I only saw clips, and if anything, I'd say it did a public service by making parents aware of what some of their innocent little tweens are actually doing online."
unbelieveable come back. i still believe 500 end of year
time to buy when others run hard and fast.lets wait for the big buying but nibbling can be done.
I think investors are panicking without even looking into what Disney+ is. It's not the same service at all. Not even close to be. It's kids content. I'll keep my Netflix subscription.
and here we go!
"It looks like this baby could rebound back to $400 by market close! :)I guess investors are finally reading the full earnings report and realize the company's fundamentals are still there and the story hasn't changed, and its growth potential remains high. As I've said in previous posts - those of us who have been in this stock for five-plus years have seen big pullbacks before, and each time we watched Reed Hastings hang tough, ignore the doom-and-gloom naysayers, and map out an incredible growth story. This is a buy-and-hold stock, folks."
"briefing.com29-Jan-18 12:58 ETHMNYHelios & Matheson ( $HMNY ) up 11%: Hearing vague, unconfirmed chatter that Netflix ( $NFLX ) is interested in taking a stake (9.58 +1.00)The MoviePass CEO was an early executive at Netflix."
let's b real people! how many more subscribers can this company get!? saturated market
"No reason for this stock to underperform with this headline: Markets soar, Dow futures add more than 1,400 points after upbeat vaccine data, Biden victory. Investors will be hesitant about purchasing this stock in the future."
I don’t why people would buy this stock.... LMAO
Netflix now has a higher market cap then Disney!
making base for another push up
I went short at the close
"So many trolls angry at Netflix bc of the Obama’s producing a few shows. Hey snowflakes, ever heard of the concept of not watching those shows? I’m sure there are conservative talk show hosts on SiriusXM radio. You don’t see me cancelling my subscription. I just....repeat after me....don’t listen to those channels."
HUGE buys at the close.

If you?re not buying Netflix at these prices then go get a job at McDonalds. I?m so happy to have invested in this #$%$ while watching other stocks on my list reach new heights...
Mind blowing subscribes data
Massive short squeeze in the afterhours. Missed on EPS but apparently the street was pleased...subscriber numbers must've been good. Shorties are bleeding from the rectum right now.
Good perspective coming into earnings: https://techstockobserver.com/netflix-inc-nasdaqnflx-gets-ready-to-rock-or-be-rocked/
good luck to all regardless of what happens. play safely.
Feels like groundhogs day. Traders are so silly sometimes. Hopefully these vaccines work but that doesn’t mean I’m selling amzn or nflx lol. Being on the opposite side of the long airlines cruise ships etc makes me feel even better. Those companies are largely in financial ruin. By the time covid is under control it will take them time to recover. We will see bankruptcies before this is over.
"I'm in. Small position, but I'm in."
"Stock market is pretty much unstoppable at the moment. Doesn't look good for earnings season if they take out all the cream ahead of the announcements. Goldman called for $400 on NFLX by the end of the year, not the end of the month."
Netflix will be 350 by end of day tmr and 400 by august
I hate to say it but back to 400 it goes
Holding since $100 wheeeee
"EPS misses , read ER"
this is getting interesting!
can't wait for more upgrades this week. Shorts are going to get called :/
Today’s note from Goldman Sachs should provide a boost today. Would be nice to finally see $390+
Wake Up!
Is the company going bankrupt?
I will start a short position soon..
How far do we think this is dropping?
400.00 stock by Halloween
360 today ?
Sell some Netflix and buy American Express going up today earnings
"Buying or holding the bubble right now is just like buying and holding any stock in Jan 2000. History repeats itself, always."
Why doesn't NFLX take advantage of its current stock price and float a secondary offer? Just think how much money it could raise and how rockin' content it could produce.
Triple top
"I'm sure Buffett is looking at loading up on NFLX, it's P/E is only around 254! He knows a good deal when he sees one. And has said he likes to buy at a reasonable price. Not for the wide moat too! Bars open, drinks are on the house."
Time to buy
9% drop over past few days without any news and without major volume... analysts and fans/foes all over the place with price targets. Q3 results one week away. Looks like a trade setup to me... sell the rumor and buy the news! NFLX should fall a bit more and then recover back to 380+ post earnings... nice opportunity!!
There are no salary caps in the TV and film business. Sports leagues have salary caps to enhance competition. Netflix with 20 billion in streaming revenue (181 billion over the next 5 years at current growth rate) is buying the streaming championship.
"Analysts never get it right, NFLX will beat the number and guide higher."
"Here is yet another reason I think large scale paid by investor operation going.Last week when I search Netflix cookies on Youtube for last 1 week, I find lot of videos that have large no of views & up vote.Now today I find near 0 for India specific and only some Latin america targeted (I don't know spanish and portuguese so can't really understand fully on method unless I watch them closely. no point to spend that much time.).Now we all know Quarter ended last week and I consider such coincident is proof on this entire activity driven by investor groups."
"This stock is like bitcoin at close to 20,000. Netflix is a great company. But the only thing it has is first-mover advantage in the streaming area. With more players and more competition, it will only lose its market share in US. Internationally? keep burning cash while facing more local competition as well."
$380 by Friday!
"When is Hilaryy getting a show on nflx?It’ll be called, “Get Ready for Another Failed Candidacy!”"
who sees $400 by next week
"If the stock goes up $5 - $6 this week from today's level, I will short it again. It doesn't belong with 385 level."
"there's a 10% chance, and a 50% chance, and a 35% chance lol"
"73.3 million international and 57.9 million domestic subscribers bringing its total to 131.2 millions.I’m going to laugh all the way to the bank! All naysayers, will be vaporized. Huge wave of covering will ensue. Watch. 500 easily next week."
"Happy, Happy, Happy!!!!!"
Watch AMZN. AMZN goes so does NFLX.
"This Hike, is a Hail Mary, as they are out of CASH, burning through it for CONTENT, They wavered between this and a Debt Offering"
"Hey, where are all the longs at? Just the beginning. Remember, higher interest rate for heavy debt companies=No good!"
I lost 95K
No better stock out there.
Growth Growth Growth
"alot of angry shorts here, this is a long play"
"How anyone would give even the smallest amount of credence to anything Citron says, is way beyond me. Some of the outrageous calls they have made in the past, speak for themselves. In my opinion...they are not an investment factor."
"MarketWatch 21 JanuaryGoldman Sachs expects strong results and steeper gains in paid global subscription additions. On Tuesday, it hiked its Netflix ) price target to $450 per share from $400 per share, implying 32% upside for Netflix ( NFLX) , which closed at $339.67 per share on Friday.Netflix's ( NFLX ) deep roster of movies and shows in the fourth quarter should propel its fourth-quarter subscription additions to 9.7 million -- well above guidance of 7.6 million -- Goldman Sachs senior equity analyst Heath Terry predicted in a note to clients."
Please buy more shares as the analysts are worried that their firms will lose big time on this stock. The short term higher price point will give way to a shorts dream.
"Scale is very, very powerful in the media industry. Henry Ford could only sell a car to one customer. Reed Hastings can sell a movie to 1 billion customers."
Perfect! 20.00 decrease. Makes sense. #$%$
"PE 200+ in an inflated stock market, nowhere to go but down"
"Down days are good after run ups. Trust me. Let the stock consolidate and find a new support level. Patience will reward you. In fact expect a few more dips as we head into earnings announcement. Bulk up before the earnings call, then the combination of the report and short covering will take us to the next level...probably north of 500. The company is still in hyper sub growth mode. DAW"
Anyone else ever check out (http://Pick-stocks.com)? They just sent a tip about NFLX
"If youre the type waiting for this to go below $300 to buy, youre gonna be kicking yourself real hard when it does the polar opposite. i wanted to buy in at the 90s and ended up buying in at the 170s."
First Netflix Oscar is a fact!
"I think Nflx is a sell/shortbut carefullyprobably runs up on Monday and starts to sell offshort a little with a stopadd as it falls, only if it fallsI think Apple mattersI think Amazon mattersI think their HUGE debt mattersI think the recession has started and we have just experienced a bear market bounce (rally)and things soon start to head southwe had three major peaks on the all time indices charts: the internet bubble, the financial bubble, the just now bubbleeach show extreme obvious peaks and we have started down againwe could see some upside, due to the China negotiations etcthe debt celiings discussions start in Marchjust my honest opinion"
Hey! I'm holding some stocks that I bought two weeks ago when the price was way better! Are you selling or holding? Or buying new?
So wen this thing was trading around 250 less than a month ago there was no buyer now it’s almost $100 more and people are all over it because a so-called analyst said u should buy? Seriously? What has fundamentally changed about the company from a month ago?
Too the moon!

Can we break resistance tomorrow? Decided to enter a short term trade based of bullish in engulfing on one day charts

"Needham analyst Laura Martin called short Netflix, long Roku the firm's top pairs trade for 2021. While Netflix's growth story could slow next year, the analyst believes that Roku's powerful advertising growth engine could pay dividends on its larger installed base. The analyst maintained its Buy rating on Roku and an Underperform rating on Netflix."
"we seem to all be hoping for a great earnings report, I have some worry but I hope it will be great. 26 more hours till earnings report good luck."

They can't afford a 110 dollar total fee for netflix for a year...but they want you to know they know something about something trading for 1 share at 3X that price. if it wasnt so sad..be funny. Z
NFLX--among the worst stocks you should hold: upside is thin;while downside is huge'Sell any rally!
I believe Netflix is a long term buy over time....but as a now Hulu customer as well...have to say it's pretty good too. Z
wow going around appl to keep 30% if the did sign up through iTunes
NFLX is finding resistance near the 6 month MA. It the market can pull us over 370 today look for big moves to the upside on Thursday and Friday.

"Success for a thirty year old is when they have their very own Netflix account with their own user name and password. As a measure of their success, they graciously allow their parents to use their password in order to watch a few #$%$ shows on Netflix.The problem with subscriber growth in the US is the whole shared password situation. The 50 million US subscribers probably represents 75 to 100 million households. If you're only watching one or two shows on Netflix, you're better off just borrowing someone else's password."

Disney earnings next week
Back to $400+ today
NFLX should buy snapchat? The growth potential will be huge
FB is up and NFLX to follow! We just need 1%to break technical resistance
NFLX going to 180
"A little over 1 million shares traded but market cap. is up $1.4B, that how you know you're in a bubble."
only 2 dollars increase. a starbuks basic cofee is more expensive than that. i am more than willing to pay that for all the original content plus amazing documentaries they have.
"LOL @ Netflix. When your biggest competitor is Amazon.com, should your stock trade at 300 times earnings? Nope! You should have a bankruptcy lawyer on speed dial. It's hilarious that Netflix trades like a world-beating monopoly. When in fact they compete against the deadliest and richest competitors on the planet: Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon. Will Netflix survive? Sure, quite possibly. But should Netflix trade at the most expensive valuation of any company in the market? LOL. Just ask Excite, MySpace, Nokia, and Barnes and Noble! Competing against any ONE of Google, Facebook, Apple, or Amazon tends not to be fun or fruitful. Competing against all of them at once is REALLY not fun! I wonder if Netflix could possibly revisit its 2017 levels? In 2017 the stock traded in the 100s all year. Now, just 15 weeks later, it's trading in the 300s! Is this a permanent change? To revisit the levels of just a few months ago, NFLX stock price would get cut in half. Gulp."
Cramer said it would be down more than 50 today
$CSCO $NFLX $WIMI tomorrow morning would be a chase between buy & sell....
Congratulations!
"Nice prop job, but no one is fooled. We will wait."
"Let’s make May 22nd, “National Cancel Netflix Day!”"
Today’s action is really unbelievable
"Was in @ 220, but Over 70% gain in 3month. Really? It might be just undervalued or just too fast. This need to slow down a bit for the long run"
I have not lost confidence in companies delivering good and great ER but i have definitely lost confidence in a market behaving rationally.
I may buy calls now. [11:23 am ET]
If nothing else they will have to run out of buyers eventually LOL
What a golden opportunity to buy it at a discount!
"I guess all the good news is mixed in the market, so not a good sign."
BMO upgrade to 580$
it will soar after it touches $300 next week
Do you think Netflix will have guidance or suspend guidance? Vote thumbs up or thumbs down.
Thursday is the next Catalyst when $NFLX reports...
Who’s buying tomorrow!
"Down grade the day before ER, that sound familiar. Oh wait, isn’t that is exactly what they did to Apple before the ER jumped the stock by 12%. I smell some fishes"
"NFLX earning better be really good on Monday. If not, this could hit 350 or lower fast."
Way To EASY To SHORT HERE ! thanks Keep loading up I will wait for the crash
Lets see if $248 Holds?Hmmm....
I knew it all ....It's a beat!!!!!Wine for everyone!!!
"It’s actually holding up better than the others. Surprising! I thought it would have it 290 by now, but not so"
bought some puts
400 today!
"Think for a second. Cord cutting is real. Nobody’s is going to replace Netflix with Disney. What will happen though is people that never cut the cord , who never had Netflix, will say “look at our options now” they can cut the cord and have both!!! That’s what they will do. The combination of multiple high quality streams will be a high tide that lifts allBoats"
May be time for that epic thing.
"Swear this stock will be up 2% by the end of the day, lol."
Told you guys during the last miss in July not to panic and that things will be back on track on again by October. I can smell new all-time highs soon.
Bring on the upgrades!
At minimum NFLX will reach the $330....mark on April 16th....Bet on it..$$$$$$...I love it.$$$$$$
This stock is an algo trading delight. People running these algos are making tons of money since they control the movement. This is no free market.
"It is trading in a very tight range $326.25 - $328.50. Strange, as if a tug of war going on, like a coil, if it breaks thru on the up side we can see short term $345."

going to 450
The gift that keeps on giving

NFLX will control the world financial system
"Our research team shows inverted bell shape, triple knuckle, cavernous double tip, hyper loop rectangle, triple bump pattern with super double dips, quadruple padded isosceles triangle and single hump for NFLX with predicted range between 336 - 367. Wow, I became a Wall Street chart analyst!"
"Still believers, Wall Street analysts stand behind Netflix despite shortfall - https://on.mktw.net/2uO1RO3"
Gap up and drift sideways. I would say that is what happens 99% of all days.
It’s early but the fact that this isn’t up significantly premarket indicates another day of selling pressure is very likely. We will likely retest $470 and $460 or even $450 is on the table if the trend out of faang continues beyond today. I’m in a watch and see mode today. Same with Apple and Amazon. Hopefully I’m wrong and this can rebound today but I’m just being realistic.
Bubble has formed in the market again. Some stocks have gone up substantially due to short covering. Time to short now.
Do you guys ever read (http://Multistockalerts.com)? They just wrote about NFLX
In the red tomorrow. Will be back below 500 shortly. Dream on holders. Cash in tomorrow. Your days are over. You will thank me for the advice!!!
Let’s go 500 this week bull
"As usual, the pop is fading..."
I guess the big buyer is gone. And DEBT will be a topic when we see tomorrows FED statement. I sold with this week 8% up :))))
"i hope leason learned for margin traders and shorts. tomorrow morning go cover the losses.its a killer for sure.for a long investor its a disappointment, nothing else. probably a matter or month or even a year.... but will come back.netflix is not going anywhere because of a bad qtr report"
"WSJ survey30% of netflix users will cancel to try the new streaming companiesweekend paper, check page 1 (or B1) and B6"
Hulu was just valued at $15 billion. Thats a problem for Netflix's valuation which stands at a staggering $165 billion including net debt. That is roughly 11x the valuation of Hulu.
Ok - pre earnings this moon soon
"People investing based on wrong matrix called Growth. Given high penetration in many developed market, Growth isn't great matrix but how many Subscriber left who might subscribe.Here is NFLX Subscriber peak analysis and it's scary.For No. purpose I am using 30% more household due to Common netflix account sharing. Which likely conservative.Current Subscriber count:- 125MWith Sharing About 165MTotal World house hold (Ex- China which clearly not going to launch anytime soon except licensing deal with limited extra income.):- 600M80% world population live on <$10/day, most of them can't even afford. Normally those household much bigger and so I assume 40% house hold can't afford Netflix like service more than month or two/year So Let's Reduce 35% house hold = 390 left.Now let's assume on average 50% of that 390 subscriber (Which actually mean 65%-70% penetration with sharing. This is very very high number because even USA they can't reach there and their marketing cost already balloon in USA just to keep current growth rate) = 185M.My prediction, Peak around 160-170M , after reach 150M, Growth will stall or even go negative. Growth likely slowdown in quarter or two as well.If price raised within 2 month, we might see 2-3 Quarter of growth Stall and peak reduce by 10% at least.If you are retail long, this is best time to take profit (Atleast some profit) peak is not far from here on growth. Normally stock react few month advance. So recent quick raise is due to expected growth near peak which almost always certain for popular services like Netflix, HBO ,DIS (HBO experience peak even in 2014 and so Disney on their current business Line).Only difference between HBO , DIS and Netflix is, unlike DIS and HBO who generate real profit, Netflix still spend $2B-$3B /year and add debt. Also not other businesses to balanced out."
"If I ever shorted a stock, I still wouldn't get on a message board to frighten other people in an effort to hurt the stock price and the people who own shares in it. Period."
looks like its going to hit 280 today
"Wow, I am rich"
shorts are going to scramble to buy under 600. SQUEEEEEEZE!
Netflix rules the world never selling only 5to10 years to go
"Read my previous update. Compare this with Goldman just put out. Goldman Sachs added Netflix to its ""conviction buy"" list, calling it ""one of the best risk/reward propositions in the Internet sector."" Goldman also said, ""We continue to believe Netflix's investment in content, technology and distribution will continue to drive subscriber growth well above consensus expectations both in the U.S. and internationally."""
It's so great to be invested in a stock that market makers and fund managers want to see over $400 regardless on what's going on in the world or all Wall Street. Congrats to the rest of you longs that got in over the last 3 months. Sometimes making money in stocks is really this easy. And remember shorts... NEVER bet against momentum or the desire of what fund managers want the outcome to be for a stock. $400+ next month my friends!
Netflix shining again
"NFLX just keeps pumping out BETTER higher QUALITY originals with top superstar actors. NFLX has MUCH more to grow from here on. Once they reach a point their products (subscription) becomes a MUST/STAPLE in EVERY household, they will be able to raise subscription fees and generate a huge income. They are also expanding into international market. Take a look at their expansion into South Korea for example. HUGE!"
"430 today, easily."
surprised this hasn't dropped more. wait until the big boys sell. then she will fall fast like fb.
"NASDAQ Composite (^IXIC) current average P/E=80NASDAQ Composite (^IXIC) historical average P/E=12NASDAQ Composite (^IXIC) is up by 150% in the Last 9 months, Despite TANKING Corporate Revenues, Collapsing Economy, Record High INFLATION, Record High Debt, Record Stock Dilutions and Deteriorating fundamentals! $TSLA $NFLX"
Surprised that Netflix didn’t take a huge hit today because of Disney and is actually green why?? More competition the better? Someone please explain.....
Wiped out 24B in a matter of minutes. The casino stocks FANG have been over pumped!
more buyers are pouring with FOMO :) Should see 380 today...wow
"Historically, NFLX doesn't miss in consecutive quarters and they've been quiet leading up to this earnings report, not trying to hold the stock up. Big beat and back to the $400 Level post-earnings and upgrades. Toasted shorties."
The seculars are losing.
Global domination continues. Netflix opens production hub in New Mexico.https://www.bizjournals.com/albuquerque/news/2018/10/08/netflix-to-invest-1-billion-in-new-mexico-plans-to.html?ana=yahoo&yptr=yahoo
Tomorrow it’s looking really good. I’m telling you all it’s going to get better from here on out. There is no reason to be back 400.00 plus by the end of the month. I love Netflix and loves me back
I hope this guy who lost 60k did not sell at 340 ;D
One day we'll be saying NFLX was 408/share! Best advice is too buy long and hold for a couple years when it's well over 1000
"I bought 350 calls and 300 puts for May with a $ ratio of about 5:1, so I'm playing for a big move up here. This is contrary to my views the past few weeks. Mostly because we fell into 340s here the expectations are a bit lower now. Furthermore, the puts will limit losses and possibly be profitable in the event this drops big tomorrow. If this doesn't move at all, I'm fine with that too, I cut my losses from expensive options going into earnings and get into something else."
Does anyone else think it's time for Netflix to do a stock split.
Netflix losing lots of the big name shows at the end of the month. Will this reflect on their stock?
Netflix saves Fox show Lucifer from being canceled after an outpouring of requests. A clear win for them to take some market share of all those fox customers who want to keep watching the series. Also the first time they have a show based on DC comics. Perhaps more to come.https://tvline.com/2018/06/15/lucifer-netflix-season-4-renewed-returning/
"As I have been saying...lower highs, lower lows..."

"Up 10 , 15, or 20 after the bell?"
thumbs up if you think it will increase at least 5% after earnings.
Nice movie bird box
"Feels like it’s going to move quickly on opening today. Looking for a ride, I bought my ticket ..."
Wow
Massive short covering can be expected coming next Monday and Tuesday. IMHO
Well all I know is I listen to a bunch analyst this weekend on the financial shows and just about every single one of them said that Netflix at $300 a share you should back up the truck and load up as much is you can these guys work these numbers out to a science we here on this message board don’t know nothing about numbers when it comes to those guys because they live in a breathe publicly traded companies numbers
TIME TO TANK.............. APPLE IS BACK DOWN. THIS STOCK IS DOOMED.
Will be green tomorrow. lot of shorts will be covering
What do you guys think this will be at open?
"Crypto UP stock market down.. Buy yourself some Bitcoin today.,"
Sell
Bring it back to 200
After this crash i wonder if my Netflix account will still be active when i comehome from vacation in a week
This stock is amazing. Going up everyday forever.
free money
Grab the bargain before the stock heads back above 400.
Everytime I want to watch a movie that I have in mind...Not on NFLX.Canceling tomorrow.Buy puts on this pig
Nflx needs to produce something like GOT. Amzn is making Lotr. Quality is more important than quantity.
Come on baby
350 by eow
"I can't believe with all this market volatility and where nflx started this morning at -$12.00 in reds, now no one is commenting how it's holding its own. Everyone i'm sure was expecting worse!"
"If everyone pulls their content from Netflix and you were left with only Netflix originals, they would only have 37% of the streaming time they have now. How can investors think that Netflix originals will keep this stock afloat? It makes absolutely no sense. Netflix needs borrowed content to survive, and the best borrowed content is leaving. Period."
I figure this is a sell and buy it back next week.
Can we close at $375 today :) . Let's do this!!!
$227 before close
Hit 510 today and around 550 this month
"While good Quarter, I am sure everyone going to ignore but marketing cost is keep going higher.it raise from 271,270 to 479,222. that's 76% raise. This clearly mean company is spending lot more just to keep stock price inflated. I think company need to finance negative cash flow so those marketing cost is justified because that way they can keep getting better rating and more interest in debt."
kiss green
Just got more shares!
It’s a great buy here! This should be around $516 or more easy. I believe that where it’s headed to soon. Good luck all!
"As they always say, it’s UP to you..."
"back over 500 before earnings, thank you to anyone who sold shares. greatly appreciated!"
AM pop for sure! easy $520+ tomorrow. I wouldn't be surprised if we see an article on price increase ;)
Going green soon
my loss is now $28K so sure getting into uncomfortable level but some reason I am not feeling concern. Not good thing because I keep thinking to short more and use my buying power which now lowest of last 2 month. Need to keep writing - follow principle to control my mind.
"I said this on Monday. We would get about 4 negative days this week and 1 positive day. This is not the type of market to hold your money in over night. 2018 is much harder to make money. If you make a 5% or 10% gain in a day, you better sale in order to keep your money"
This ALWAYS ends the same way! higher it goes the bigger the drop! looking like the next AMD. Prefect earnings priced in shorts tapped out for the most part. ITS GOING TO SINK. just a matter of time
amc gme koss all tanked ..AGAIN NETFLIX IS THE KING
"Hold long, hold strong"
Buying here at a 24% discount. Invest now while the stock is on sale. Opportunities like this don’t come often. Blue Light Special Folks.
Get on up!
Thumbs up if you love Netflix and Chill!!
"Broke 524 resistance, tomorrow up past 530!"
Netflix bubbleheads still in denial. NFLX’s grossly overvalued shares will lose 90% of their value.
What is wrong with this thing. Netflix has been so lifeless for the last few weeks. ￼￼
From what...590ish to 530ish. Quite a drop...
"Check out the newly added movies on Netflix, most of the time they are from different language, either India or Spanish. a strong indication that NetFlix will go down soon."
"It seems like NFLX is starting to correct. 202 to 189 189 to 196now down againwe'll seethe market finds its excuses to sell off after things get to bubble territorythe entire market is in that situation, except some have already corrrectednflx is 7% or so shortmoney is in at $2, $4, $10 a share, will like get out at this leveltoo much debt with an average of 6%interest rates are heading uptomorrow is another day, the sellers will likely come outno sense of selling so much when they have the bots on, let them take it upwhat a day for GE"
Realistically this stock will see $375.00 before it sees $330.00. When this wakes up it’s going to crush shorties beyond recognition. A stock like this one doesn’t get a $70.00 haircut on the sole basis of missing subscriber growth.
"no news, market smashed, this will come back 375+ soon"
"Everyone do their part this weekend and watch ""Peppermint"" on Netflix #1 trending movie on the platform. Then phone a friend and recommend they watch it. Now let's sit back and watch the stock price explode these coming weeks for an early XMAS Gift to investors."
"Back to back RED days for the 1st time since going 6 in a row from Nov. 16 to 23.First RED Monday this month.Now down 23.33 for the month.High reached 6.14, 132nd time since Jan. 2013 that the HIGH reaches 6+ and only the 12th time it finishes in the red.Third time since Nov. 14260.61 is the lowest point since hitting 256.14 on 11/27.Lowest close since 11/26, 261.43Have now gone 24 days without closing 300+ and 21 since we last hit 300."
When Apple announce iphone prices that keep going up. Everyone celebrate. But what is outcome? Apple lose 50% sale in India and 30%+ sell in China. Two most important market for growth that also very price sensitive.
$430 after ER. That's all you need to know.
Of all the stocks I hold NFLX worries me the most of all.
10% ´wow
buy buy buy... cover cover cover
"Big expectations for earnings means there will be a high chance of them not meeting those expectations. Limited upside, big downside, good luck to all."
Increased holding 1000 shrs.
NFLX planning to buy Microsoft as they lack cloud services.
beating the resistance..370
Nflx is a great company but I’ve learned not the greatest stock lately. I’ve been trading around a core position since right before earnings and because of some good trading I’ve managed to be roughly breakeven. I’ve reduced my position since above $500 and glad I so some more this morning. This stock should be at least around $520 and keeps lagging. Can’t keep treading water while so much money to be made. Hopefully we pop soon. It’s hard to believe we haven’t in this market.
"Disney will rule and be a 1T Market Cap in a few. NFLX has some good competition in Disney,too big IMO."
Let the buying begin. Stop the with the 1% or 2% let’s rock n roll to 10% today. Let’s show the stock market who we are and have them talk about how NETFLIX is coming back strong. Green Green Green. I counting on everyone today. Prove me wrong.
$600 coming
"Netflix is going to have to lower prices for *US* custoemrs as well. Here is waht Disney owns:Disney (Mickey Mouse, Snow White, The Jungle Book, Bambi, Peter Pan, Frozen, etc.), Marvel (The Avengers, The X-Men, etc.), Pixar (Toy Story, The Incredibles, Finding Nemo, etc.), LucasFIlms(Star Wars, Indiana Jones, etc.), 20th Century Fox (Titanic, Avatar, etc.),Miramax (Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill, etc.)Withot access to that library, NFLX is going to lose subscribers. The Star Wars and Marvel movies will drive away a lot of Millenails, and then familes will go to Disney to entertain their kids. NFLX will not recover.Also, Disney now owns 2/3s of Hulu, so they have Disney+ for familes and Hulu for those that adults that aren't intereested in aniamted flicks."
"If Netflix eventually reaches 1 billion subscribers, and I don't see anyone impeding them from doing that, then 195 or 325 or 425, they're all very cheap."
I believe it will close above 260
So they reported an in-line revenue # but blew away subscriber estimates. This makes no sense. If analysts got the revenue # correct how did they under estimate the sub #? One answer: all the excess subs are promotional and non-paying. If they convert to paying then next quarter it is fine.
NFLX added 6 million NEW SUBSCRIBERS in Q2!!! Highest new subscription quarter EVER!!!
$NFLX the TULIP MANIA BUBBLE is COMPLETE OUT OF CONTROL!
I am staying long
"Netflix current technicals. OBV good across all time frames from 5-minute thru the dailies. RSI not overcooked. Oh yeah, my buy stop hit a few minutes ago @ 533.70"
"Analyst Actions: Canaccord Genuity Lifts Netflix's Price Target to $550 From $500, Keeps at BuyBY MT Newswires— 11:03 AM ET 07/01/2020"
"Where's Cramer to tell us how awesome FAANG is? Oh yeah, he's recovering from a weekend in the Hamptons with his hedge fund buddies who sold last week."
"I first bought NFLX when it’s $130, sold when it’s $180, bought it again when it’s $240, sold again at 350, and bought it again at $280 when it suddenly dropped a lot earlier this year. I paid lots of extra tax for the gains. Lesson learned: Don’t bother to sell this ever again."
"You know what it means, this company is not able to add expected number of subcribers. It knows growth is slowing. This is not Amazon's model. Amazon never raised prices."
"If my friend sells all his NFLX shares for $394, he would walk away with $32K. But the prospect of NFLX rising to $500 is very tempting. Should my friend sell? or Not? Whats your opinion?"
don't worry it's headed for 250 just after the split
This thing is ripping it in aftermarkets. Congrats to the longs.
"David Einhorn Is Short Netflix, he also shorted Tesla at 200 a share..."
"Every Friday before earnings has upgrades. If you bet your net worth on $330 calls at the open yesterday, you'd have a 1,000% gain in 24 hours"
The stock trades independent of facts and reality. Another upgrade today and we are down. Where as roku is up another 4% on similar upgrade and trading past 52 week high. Major disconnect
"Resistance at 575, if crossed then 670-680."
Raymond James has downgraded NFLX.
Oh....up some more....time to take some profits before giving it all back or even worse....become negative
"today confirm 330. breakout watch above 329.44, no resistance in area just above."
"After hours manipulation by options and shorts, real ER effect will expose tomorrow "
buying more ... way way way oversold.
This is only the beginning. Price targets all over this green earth at around $750 and higher. I will give it about a month before we hit that target. The analyst aren't giving us a 1 week target...realistically it's a 1 month target.
220 calls expiring. Bust through that and it will climb.
Take the time to read netflix financial statements. Pay attention to how much the company earns per year and what debts they have. How many years to work only to cover the debt.
"Huge amounts of money lost today to big buyers. Billions on all types on companies. Create panic for longs to sell and short to step in. Then buy back so short get scared and buy back with a loss. To green again, people buying. Now shorting again. Hahaha. And many people keep going for it. If you have a stock of a good company. Stick to it for a year at least."
"If you believe the DOW will hit 33,000, you can realistically expect NFLX to be hovering around $670 when the DOW approaches 33,000 (from below). I'll post my reason later."
$325 this week!
"I read most bullish article about Netflix in seeking alpha. Who thinkin 2021 - Netflix will have 143M international paying customer, 75M usa paying, Subscriber cost raise 20% , and expect interest cost will go lower than current, margin will double, will trade at 48 pe.All combine he still value company at $408 in 2021. then he argue trade $300 based on 10% discount model.Now Risk reward analysis of his way optimistic number still make this stock work $200 in my opinion. Sure if it continue grow even after $DIS entry and without disney content, could worth $400 in 2021 But that 3 year out. Why pay so much premium now."
"This is crazy, I mean at least Amazon can somewhat justify their market cap. This though? There's no way they'll ever make enough money going off $11 per month subscription fees."
What time are they reporting earnings?
"At some point, the stock will take a dive, or the market might crash. Until then, I'm staying on this race horse.This stock would have to drop $100 a share for me to lose money.I like it when ""shorts"" lose money, because they are negative people hoping for a company to fail and to profit from someone else's demise."
"EPS met, subscribers was missed... so"
580 SHORT SQUEEZE COMING TOMORROW MORNING HUGE
You know it’s going green today right
lol most of you people have no idea how big of a bubble this stock is... nflx can drop 50% and it still will be expensive... I say this not to scare you but just stating facts. Most people in the dot com bubble didn't think about the downside either.. most were completely wiped out. Would you pay 100M for your local gas station that earned 200k a year? No is the obvious answer. That's how much your paying for NFLX...
See you guys at $406 in hour
"Hi, I bought 5 contracts calls at strike of 600 expired on 22 Jan. Price is 0.61 . If the stock open at 560, how much could I earn."
Collapse is the new future.
Is this a bubble? I'm thinking it's heyday is past.
"out Netflix at $63 a share few years back. Sold it at $410, wish I would have waited to $423, but made a nice profit. Bought again today. I think its going up. With the stock market in the toilet people will not have money tgo out with. They will stay home to save money, and watch Netflix. I also bought a lot of Walmart too. If we do head into a recession, people won't stop shopping, but just adjust to a discount store. Made a lot of money last recession with Walmart."
should I short ntfx or wait till tomorrow
"Friday slum continues. Worst Friday this year.Nov 9, was only 14.45 in the red.8th RED Friday in row and 4th 13+.9th worst day ever. 5 of the have come since September 5.Did have a cup of cup in the green for 1.33Worst close since Nov. 27.Better luck next week.Every time I think we are out of the slump, we get pulled right back into it....."
I'm buying at some point.
"""Limit my gains"" ??? That doesn't sound like a winning market strategy."
what - insiders not loading up on a good deal?
So let me see? he shorts then bashes on CNBC or tweeter. Isn't that what they do when they tell you to buy stocks that they already own on CNBC/ I see it as activity that should be illegal in all cases - if you mention a stock sell or buy on public network like CNBC - you can't close that position for 30 days/ Perod

"This is normal I suppose when you are the leader of the pack, everyone is gunning against you.

Here come the momentum crowd who buy stocks with upward earnings revisions. Analysts are hiking Netflix earnings estimates across the board.
Good day!
"Netflix purchased the entire billboard advertising agency, not just advertising space:Netflix, already a heavy advertiser on billboards in the area, was offering $300 million in April to acquire Los Angeles-based Regency Outdoor Advertising, Reuters previously reported."
beginner long term investor here. with the high PE I don't know if i should buy at high price. any suggestions????Im not a day trader. thanks everyone!
from a chart point of view Netflix is at the bottom completely washed out and oversold. its a great entry point imho
Based off of Benjamin Graham’s growth formula this stock should be trading around $97
Not rich but I bought only 10 shares at 332 2 years ago. I’m selling 5 when I double and leave the rest for my sons he’s 11. Going to surprise him when he’s goi g to college or university
450 after earnings call
Do I see 500 in July????oh yes.
This stock is a joke. Everyone knows that everyone uses someone else password. That is not a paying subscriber. I know i wouldnt pay for nflx.
I bailed. Not good trading action for me. Need nerves of steel and ain’t got’m anymore.
Tremendous growth. Hundreds of millions of more subscribers to come. This stock is just getting started.
"I don't know what is a better investment, Nflx or a checking account "
It’s going green today after 10am start buying it’s going to start looking good.
should see 290 tomorrow
what's happening?
down 20% tomorrow
NFLX HAS DROPPED FROM$449.52 TO $413.00THE PROFIT TAKERS THAT SOLD AT $449.40 ON UP HAVE SINCE RETURNED. THIS STOCK IS A BUY IN THE $420'SI'ts gonna return to the $440's
How is $NFLX related to Nvidia?
Super duper 600$ stock!
Netflix international is growing at amazing rate... Obama internationally is very popular. You Are Looking At The Next General.. if you leave politics aside this is a great move..mho
Netflix will always win with high unemployment until they run out of money to pay the monthly fee.
Netflix is still a great stock in my opinion. Should be worth 3 times the amount or more.
"The bleed may continue into tomorrow, but I think this company is still worth investing in the long term."
Bird box I was awesome. Unfortunately NFLX is going bankrupt creating such content
nothing like a buying discount
"If the movie The Silence is the best content that Netflix can produce, then this stock is going well below $200. Their original programming is a farce and a colossal waste of capital."
"Do you think that $NFLX earnings will shift the market focus to good fundamentals rather than geo-political nonsense, and create a buy storm for Nvidia?"

Why does the Head Case always yap about NFLX being lib? Who cares? I'm a Republican and I don't care. I just want NFLX to grow.
"Some big name, well respected analyst from a reputable firm is probably getting his SELL recommendation ready as we speak. Maybe tomorrow?"
"2 tricks Meet flick my be using g, can't say they are1. they can have people sign up for free amd say they are subdcribers. 2. long term debt is up $4B in one year. Income listed as $1.2 B in 2018."
this should be up
"The bad news is I have a 389 shares of Netflix and this is a painful time. The good news is I have a 1000% profit in this terrific company. Don't lose faith, this selling will blow over and the march will be on to $500."
Even at 50 it will be a risky investment.one more miss and PE will be down to 20 Which would still be higher than Apple's PE of 17..
"You know the old sayin when something seems to good to be true it probably is. The fantastic content that NFLX creates comes at a very large price. $20b to be precise. Not including the $1.5b they recently borrowed. It’s Interesting that they go to the debt markets rather than dilute the stock. Further evidence of stock manipulation IMHO. Unfortunately for Netflix. There will be no way for them to reduce content spending while growing or even maintaining current subscribers, so soon enough the alarms will toll, the bow will break and NFLX will fall."
Don’t open a position in NFLX until you hear what (http://Rightpicker.com) has to say about it. These guys give amazing insights like no other service.
"More likely trading on the technicals today. It overshot the 50 day on the way up, it failed and it came back down under the upper Bollinger band on the 1 year chart (roughly $364). Give this another day or two for the bollinger bands to start heading higher and it should be fine."
650 today
"I sold after hours yesterday at $395 when it spiked. I had paid $381 for 100 shares before last quarter's earnings and was really under water. Just lucky to get out, and I'm through trading with NFLX."
Tacked on another billion today and now up 8.5% in 4 days. Hard to know how much further this can go. I started a short when it went over 206 and have averaged up to 207 but the train is pulling away. This could hit 210 today and 220 next week.
There you go ... Brexit vote turmoil hitting stock market
Setting up nicely for mid-week rally after big tech earning announcements AH on Wed.
Going up.... We will close at 375
Hastings retirement announcement soon? Co-ceos? That doesn't last long.
Today we fly
Barely makes targets and stock goes up 10%. Talk about delusions!Next qtr's numbers are being goosed by the increased prices but for how long!
"I know I missed the great run up in the stock the last few years, but I couldn’t resist any longer and bought in at $318. Hopefully Netflix will double by this time next year!Congrats to all the longs who have been in this stock the last few years!"
$17 Billion more in market cap in a week. Wow

Buy now for $390+ open. Easy 10 points while you sleep!
"during earning season, an ultra short term trading is still the best profiting strategy. after majority reporting done and evaluating all risk, holding for long term will make a safer bet. too much noise right now. I don't even know who to believe, including myself."
"hold tight till noise cleared in first 30 min, will turn green"
resume the pump
Dam trying hard to stay red everyday but eventually it’s going to give in and turn green for days. I love Netflix 400 soon
Some dolt just compared FB to NFLX. lmao Can someone tell me how they are related at all? Shows you how stupid these boards can be. How much debt does FB have on its book. How much does FB charge the end user? Two completely different business models but some dolt used FB to defend NFLX. Best laugh I have had in a while
Early this morning Goldman Sachs increased price target to 490 from 390 but you have to dig real hard to find the news. If it was a downgrade it would be all over the place. I've always found sentiment indicators to be the most reliable. Netflix is buy until it becomes obvious sentiment is bullish across the board.
is this the beginning of our run into earnings?
"Building a strong film and streaming video series library, room to grow."
"Spending 8 billion in content this year, unbelievable. This company's going to be the largest studio in the world passing Disney soon."
Here we boys and girls the buying stared back up Green Day coming. 375 today big buying
"Weak hands, profit taking are perfect today, on way to $610 next week. Easy money."
is over. vaccine is here. no more staying at home and netflix
"Would be nice to see NFLX punch pass the 52 week high. I’m liking my ‘NAN’ stocks (NVDA, AMZN, NFLX) a lot. Long term buy and hold, true legacy stocks."
"Netflix fundamentals hard to beat with y/y accelerating revenue growth: 13%, 21%, 26%, 23%, 30%, 32%. Netflix forecast 41% revenue growth for the first half of 2018."
"got in at $124 will get out at $2,124...."
I am raising target from 650 to 780 on this.
money rotation out of FAANG stocks into EV stocks.
Let's go back to 423
"If it opens tomorrow above 327.10 tomorrow, look for a GREEN DAY with a high hitting at least 336."

"20,000 in puts"
What will be the $360 puts worth tomorrow?
All these shorts bad mouthing NFLX is hilarious!! All they say is how this will be down big tomorrow or go to $500 lol. Don’t forget people this was at $545 a week and a half ago without earnings!!! This will hit all time high tomorrow no worries lmao!
"How do you justify a 135 P/E ratio with Disney, Apple, Roku and Amazon are coming next year? Netflix is a hosting site for other brands and this year they will start to pull them out. All the good shows gone and nobody pays for Netflix cringey originals. Who is going to stay with Netflix when real Titans with strong brands will start to pop up?"
"Yes, Friday's trading results make me a bit nervous but, like the elite companies out there, NFLX has a great track record of hitting and beating the quarterly estimates....the mark of a leader or, super athlete...."
$204 or $235 AH tomorrow. Will be a 7% move.
"Some group must own a ton Of Disney stock for a push to be on like this. More manipulation at its finest! I don't care what they say, a miss on earnings and revenue is still a miss, and shouldn't be promoted as just a small residual side effect. NFLX on the other hand misses something trivial in my way of thinking a(subscription metric); made earnings and revenue and still got slammed. Manipulation at its finest!!https://www.barrons.com/articles/disney-stock-was-upgraded-after-bad-earnings-51565284026"

Hold!
"Wow I just watched CNBC interview ( I was out this afternoon). Look Andrew must upset some big players.Wow they refuse to recognize fundamental of Investment:- ValueWhen Andrew said Netflix gone ahead of itself (Which mean overvalued) they all coming after that's not fundamental reason to make call. If Their growth slowing or something like that then it understandable.So Stock being overvalued is not issue and All those analyst and media pumping people into over inflated stock like nflx and $AMZN is god gift but When someone speak with sense, it's nonsense. What a great Wall street and how good they are adjusting to new Internet reality and still find way to control market (By Controling Sentiment)"
"I own 100 AMZN and it's almost all my money but, I took $10,000 out of my checking account and bought NFLX yesterday. Wish me lluck!!!!"
No Netflix is not facing competition overseas. Yes Netflix is winning original content award. Yes people know it. Yes people want entertainment. No people don’t mind 10$ a month. No none of the above is a factor in the stock market. Yes this is fall is market wide. Buy and forget
Will finish in Green today. New highs by Friday.
"can't be going up all the time.a 30% correction is in order, and overdue.for NFLX, a 50% drop would still be too small in view of the unreasonably high p/e ratio."
"Price Target is US$420 by the end of the month, when the ""disappointed"" feeling pass this week, everybody will jump again and realize that NFLX is growing in content and production (112 Emmy nominations) - Netflix plans to spend between $12 and $13 billion this year on original programming while HBO’s budget was a thrifty $2.5 billion by comparison!"
Congrats to all who bought in at 340's at open - that was a Prime day gift
370 maybe the target for today close and tomorrow will be another record
TOLD YOU Last week was a FIRE Sale
"NFLX $210. Target announced: By Trey Williams, MarketWatchNetflix's valuation is the elephant in the roomInvestors shouldn't worry about Netflix's rapacious spending -- but should be concerned about its ability to grow overseas, say analysts who started coverage of the streaming company on Tuesday.Analysts at Evercore initiated their coverage of Netflix Inc. with an in-line rating and a $210 12-month price target, which represents a roughly 14% premium to current trading levels.Lead analysts Vijay Jayant and Anthony DiClemente wrote in a note to investors that there are a lot of aspects of Netflix's story that are no longer debated. Internet TV is here to stay and the growth runway is massive. Within that, they wrote, Netflix (NFLX) has a huge head start.""The platform has reached near ubiquity with the help of an effective original content strategy, and a global mass market has emerged with streaming becoming the consumer's preferred way to consume video content,"" Jayant and DiClemente wrote"
Who here thinks Netflix is going to 420 tomorrow?...
up to 380 tomorrow...watch
"Do the math. It's a mathematical impossibility for NFLX to make money ever if they have to keep spending $7,9 billion or more a year for shows. (Well, they have to keep spending money every year, don't they? Otherwise, they won't be able to show anything interesting.)"
A couple years ago I bought some shares of NFLX at the $82 range and sold at the $92 range. I locked in a good $10/ share of gains and was very happy with my trade. Following my gains I saw the stock climb to $350 range. I was heartbroken and disappointed that I wasn't strong enough to hold on for the ride. However a couple years later ( Tuesday before the bell) I decided to participate and open a good position on NFLX. I'm very happy I did and I don't think a quick $10 - $20 bump up is enough to get out and lock in gains this time. Same thing happened to me with TSLA- I saw a $100 gain / per share and got out. Way too early now that I look back. After I got out of TSLA the stock rallied another $200+ a share.
Like I said we going to $400 in less than 2 weeks.
just finished watching season 2 of Ozark. Great series. if NFLX continues to make content like this no reason why the stock can't rise to 400.
"Moving back up in premarket, good volume"
just bought more. i like buying on sale.....when others panic.
A lot of people are switching to Amazon Prime and note they have a lot more content than they used to have..
Not much of a drop after earnings?
Done....new 52 week high guys
are free subscriptions considered subscribers
"12mil new subscriptions, price goes to $440"
"360 yet? Oh okay, it is fine it will close above 360"
Stock being hyped because of the Oscars. We'll see what happens on Monday.
Netflix and chill slogan really pushed this stock to mars. I'm loving it :)
Netflix is on fire. Outperforms the market.
Some positive results today!
"time for a sell off, 10 points, 20 pointsneeds to drop to $140 eventuallyno dividend, no earnings, PE 200 or so"
THey should revise their guidance down due to Disney +.
$360 opening tom morning
if you want to have a real good laugh go back to the oldest reactions and see how people were saying Netflix will never get past $90 hahaha hahaha hahaha hahaha hahaha all the way to the bank
380 today
"Those craving to buy, this is your chance.. Start buying dips in small portion from here"
"People! Understand this: 268 PE ratio. Don’t fight the fundamentals, euforia is contageous. DYOD. Good luck!"
I was thinking simple way to prove that you can create fake paid account and share to other.You don't need to try those unsafe sites (I was going to do that first but then thought those are one doing fraud so using their site to prove it fraud not good way to do it)Step 1:- Login in ChromeStep 2:- Derived your CookiesStep 3:- go to different computer where you are not logged in.Step 4:- Step Cookies same method that all this You tube video showing.Step 5:- Check if you can access Netflix on Chrome..If you can means this sites are distributing fake paid accounts. I may try myself when find time and share result.
Predicted movement of 12 percent. Will anybody be doing a straddle on this horse for earnings???
"What luck. Haven't bought any NFLX since my initial purchase years ago, and then bought a few shares to round out my speculative stock exposure yesterday. Next day 4% up. Not selling for decades, but still nice to see."
$330 by end of March....
"History tells us that every stock's big run comes to an end. the question is who can understand the writing on the wall, and who will be holding the bag?"
this market will turn green and close 375 today.
can we add the after-hour increase to my portfolio? Haha
"Bullish crossover in MACD and Stochastic oscillator, according to foxchart. Looking for breakout at 355."
I made tons of money shorting stocks. Shorting in this market is a lot safer and easier than going long
My 5Million Long position took a big hit tonight but i know this is a long play. They keep adding subs. do you know how hard is to add 10M subs? this will gradually go up long term. I see market cap of 1 trillion in 5 year.s
"%^&* - Maybe its just me, but it seemed there were a large number of 480 Puts and 485 calls closing today so managing the price to close at 482 .84 on low volume makes it seem that this stock is completly controlled at the moment - then again maybe that's just my perception after a beer!!Bon weekend to all !!"
"I don’t see any correlation-ship between FB disappointing revenue and NTFX, two different business models. I guess it must be the FANG thing!"
The USD will show further collapse and inflate the market further. just ride the wave $GOOG $WIMI $NFLX
So many stocks bled out today... I think market is heading for a major correction. Market is extremely top heavy and over valued right now and will correct itself IMO. Not looking forward to September...
With faster cord cutting the big problem for content companies is distribution. It's a problem Netflix doesn't have.
Short squeeze will come from margin calls tomorrow morning .
Late afternoon is when we see a rally in the stock as people will want to have NFLX in their portfolio prior to start of a breakout week (especially big boys and hedge funds). A little Profit taking so far today is very understandable.
"nfkx will be $250 Dec, 2019. We have same #subcribers and more streaming providers, price will drop. The providers share same pool of subscribers"
"Look at the 5 day chart, can you see where the ceiling is on this thing? ;-)"
"NFLX is half the market cap of Boeing, welcome to casino street !"
This will be back to over 510 tomorrow. Major selloff because of Capitol!
"swingtrade, it looks like 385 is getting further away. glad I didn't listen to you"
Will it ever reach 400$ I am in at 405$. Now getting little worried.
"323 looks like a good level to get back in if you wanna hold overnight. pre market, Netflix has gonna up the past 5 or so sessions."
"Netflix has highest content in global market to attract all customers from different countries . Netflix has become the part of comcast ,Verizon and other carriers as bundle key inclusion . All new Smart TV has netflix as part of smart gui . Kids are hooked to netflix versus regular TV . Guys this is bargin and buy here ...Look at my previous post and stock has done great versus any ohter FANG stocks .........."
im so glad I sold this thing when it was in the mid 560's. It was such a drag on my porfolio between earnings. I will prob buy into it again when it dips to 470's...
"Oh my! On this great news, The Cutied part 2&3 announced!"
Listen closely...Price targets are meaningless. Determining fair value on a price tag via retail investors and traders are just based on what everyone is willing to pay for that equity. Cult following here WILL weaken soon. That’s a guarantee! This IS extremely overvalued at these price tags. Take it fwiw...VA
"Hold on to your shares , $20 plus move up is coming tomorrow."
so if nflx has 700 million users at $10/month...that would equate to $84 billion in 2018 revenues. How in the world are they projected to get $16 bill in revs versus $12 ill in revs last year while this goes up in market cap y around $15 bill/day. Irrational exuberance with a capital I

buy the dips?
Discovery is now going to streaming because they realize it’s the future. Discovery is a niche service which is going to charge $4.99 plus have ads. One thing nflx has figured out is people hate ads. When I see all the things nflx does right it’s no surprise they are the dominant player here. These companies moving to streaming are so far behind and imo making big mistakes like bombarding people with ads.

Good day to have 70% of your portfolio NFLX
You knew that when this stock was holding strong on down market days that it could explode higher with up markets. Such is the case. Love that NLFX hanged tough on down markets.
Mid 2012 $NFLX was at $7 a share. That is mind-boggling!!
why up ah?
Who is keen to buy some netflix shares today???
NFLX real advantage in the streaming wars is a ultra wide genre spectrum. No other platform will have content from and for so many countries
Im raising my price target to $455 per share. strong buy.
"Anyone betting against THE GREAT NETFLIX will get destroyed, simple as that."
Earning
I'm in for 5 years
Beast of a stock. Never imagined this would rally about 45-50% in a few weeks. Wow!!!!
$340 tomorrow since Apple beat and will carry Nasdaq
Ok. whats the story today??
"What analysts said:-> Monness Crespt price target raised to $400 from $350-> BMO Capital Markets: reiterates Outperform, price target $440-> Oppenheimer price target raised to $400 from $385-> Morgan Stanley reiterates Overweight, price target $400-> Piper Sandler Overweight rating on Netflix with a $400 price target"
"Holding up OK. Still quite buoyant. Rise NFLX, rise."
In at 332 2 years ago ty selling half at double
NFLX short thought DIS's subscriber numbers meant the end of NFLX. Today is proving to be a rude awakening. Love the smell of freshly squeezed shorts. Delicious.
I’m glad I sold a chunk of my position above $510. Still hold a small position but much more easier to tolerate these selloffs. If it drops closer to $480 I might add some more.

Mark Cuban (Dallas Mavericks owner) owns a ton of NFLX and AMZN stock.I don't think he is selling either of them this week.
Right after lunch the buying begin again.
hahatake off baby!!!!
"This is being pumped with quick analyst upgrades today so the big money can have time to offload their positions, don't be ignorant. Netflix is growing, but their negative cash flow is growing at an even faster rate and is expected to continue into 2019...that's a HUGE investment risk. This could easily make Netflix go bankrupt if their growth slows for whatever reason."
Same bubble mentality has arrived to town again. Just a day or two when we see a 700 point decline. Enocomy worldwide is sinking. Financial media is hiding it.
"$0.24 I think it is easily beat I think it will at least be $0.35, last year same quarter was $0.44 it does not make sense to be trade at such high level if it can’t product earning higher than the last years same quarter earnings"
"Called it after earnings it would drop between 310-315. It did that and more. I hope those who sold after earnings (me) reinvested the last two days (me). If the markets are good this week and into next week with other big names reporting strong earnings, NFLX will be back to 320 range."
Over priced. No profits ever. Only losses. Will have to spend more on content when Disney and WarnerMedia begin to pull content from them. Share price is way overinflated only due to hype. Analyst are not evaluating this correctly. They promote and when price does up they dump. Sell Netflix.
can't stay on the green. not enough buyers
Gonna go up another 10-15 points today. Half way thru 3rd quarter and overseas subscribers are piling on.
"Already down 8% from the high.....With this stock, always be ready for an implied volatility of 9%....Also, the 50 day MA is about $370"
Thumbs up if you're up over 100% on the most awesome stock ever!!! :). I'm thumbs upping this post myself as I eclipsed 100% a few weeks ago...
most businesses start off in debt and NFLX is young..by 2020 it will be profitable..scare story doesn't cut it.
Next stop 350
lower highs and lower lows...
300+ looks likely today

"Barron's article says Netflix is paying 6.375% interest rate. ""Since 2017, the cost of debt has risen 275 basis point to 6.375%. Should debt investors grow more weary of Netflix’s massive cash burn, the liquidity they’ve provided could dry up quickly. See Appendix II for more details."":::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::Try buying something at 6.375% interest rates.It is burdensome. Soon they will paying interest on the interest. I think this is a major issue. Why can't they sell some bonds fro 2% or whatever? Maybe because their company is too risky. That one point is making me lean toward the Barron's article. https://www.barrons.com/articles/why-netflix-shares-will-plummet-fund-manager-51556731141"
This is going to come crashing down I sold it if you don’t believe nothing you can do about it ....

After earning we take off hopefully a split
"NFLX becoming cash flow positive is a major blow to the shorts’ thesis. This is despite coming competition from DIS. This tells me that not only will the two coexist without cutting each other’s throats, they will be like Coke and Pepsi. They target different markets so there is no bear case to be made here. $600 a share will be here soon."
"netflix debt is way to high, earnings will be a disaster"
370$ today 415$ Friday

Insurmountable debt. Decreasing revenue growth. Rising interest rates. A stock market bubble based on 8 year of 0% interest rates. Analysts raising price targets to unload shares on retail. What’s not to love about Netflix?

I love Netflix I’m watching right now. Never ever had a problem. Not even with price to rent.
A close above 530 at the end of the month would clear the way for a multi month run up.
"When times are financially good, people/families celebrate with Pizza ; when times are financially bad, people/families celebrate with pizza  because that’s all they can afford. People/families can afford Pizza  no matter what their financial stability is. So! Therefore!!!! People/Families can afford Netflix no matter what and it’s less than the price of a pizza ! Netflix is here to stay and the new subscribers will continue to join world wide. When you buy Netflix you hold on to it..."
"from 231 to 384 in that short time.. Thanks guys, I am leaving to IQ"

Going to be an Oscar winning Monday
"Amazing that the funds are still buying this stock despite the massive run up over the past 5 years. One thing is for sure though, NFLX pioneered the OTT concept and has a strong lead over it's rivals, but cash burn needs to go down at some point. Else people who bought in at today's prices will need to keep waiting forever to get back their investment. JMTC"
ABQQ BUY THE DIP! DOLLAR LAND FORTHCOMING.$NFLX $MSFT
+62% this year....about 1% per day every day!
"When there's enough content for everyone to watch and no need to cancel, Netflix will cap content spending and every new subscriber after will cost very little. They will make 15B in profits every year with 100 million new subscribers, 75B a year in profits with 500 million new subscribers."
warm up your engines Boys! get ready to fly
"Haven’t been this high in two and half months. Let’s rally into the earnings. Not making a prediction, but the momentum that this stock is capable of, wouldn’t be surprised if it’s over $400 again going into the report"
They needed to lose 2b to cover notes-now it's down 2.9b so time to buy.
Sold this looks like a sell the news especially next week after MLK holiday
Netflix is the only streaming service that is making a profit. They have cornered the market.

"Trading at 13 x revenue. Water always finds it's own level. Great that everyone is making $$$$ dollars now but at some time in the future, it will trade like CBS, Viacom and Disney and watch out below."
huge earnings in 7 days! 550+ coming
Expected a better day for NFLX
just went short big
"OK, my two best shows in 2019 is as follows: ROMA and Sex Education. Of course ROMA is not in english but it is a fabulous movie. I do hope they dub it in the future. Please Netflix!!The reason I say this is because many viewers are missing out on a fabulous movie because you need closed caption to watch it. I'm used to CC but I do miss some of the great reactions from the great cast."
"Hey Tesla the PONZI Scheme ....... Haven't taken your meds yet, I see."
"NFLX is going no where. I sold after the pop in price do to the news of the ""monthly price hike"" and so far am right to do so. The markets are very strong and I'll wait for a good sized pull back until buying back in."
will be at 450 after earnings.
This cannot fall as almost all funds in the world owns this.
3Q numbers for NETFLIX are gonna be LIT! 1.) Will exceed estimated gain in subscribers 2.) Will exceed estimated earnings per share3.) Will blow past $450Remember you heard it hear 1st
"Wow, it broke just through the 345 pretty easy. I did not expect that. Was expecting much more fluctuation."
He’s a billionaire and sleeps on a futon?
"LOL NFLX is on a roll- first Susan Rice, then the Obamas, now... ""A documentary chronicling the life and times of controversial Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan will appear on Netflix in August."""
"Markets went up 30% from Dec lows only due to ""china deal is making good progress"" tweets from Trump. Now that the deal never happened, it is time for a 30% correction. Trade carefully. Markets may cave big time soon."
"Suntrupgrades Netflix, buy on the dip because of India opportunity"
"That movie Bird Box that everyone is talking about? What station is it on? Netflix.....that's right. They can add five more TV streaming services, NFLX is going nowhere. It's the best."
Expecting blockbuster earnings....Just fake action here.. This will hit 550 easily today!
Here it comes!
So sell or hold? Verdict please less than an hour remaining
Was this just Plastic Surgery?
Jump in.
NFLX is projected to more than double its EPS this year'; up from 1.25 to 2.85. That's huge!
"Three massive gaps since the beginning of the year. This is extremely unusual with a stock that had no earning news. It indicates probably a short squeeze, even though there is not much short interest on NFLX. But it also tells me those gaps will close sooner rather than later."
Waiting for Disney streaming service to cancel Netflix
What’s going on?
Went long at 392.5
"BO OY, oh bo y, you LOVED THIS AT $420"
What just happened? Why the sharp drop right at the close?
I'll take +$6.00 for the day in a heartbeat.
A small bump rather!
Netflix gift cards are sold out nearly everywhere in VT/NH
"netflix needs to chill on their liberal agenda. Big mistake for content provider to lean left or right because they are just shrinking their customer base. I live in netflix's home, silicon valley and its one of the most liberal areas in the nation and believe me...netflix's newest original content is an exaggeration of reality. Tone it down netflix."
TIMBER!
I'm looking for 545-560 strike ahead of earnings. not a huge move 5-7% by the 19th.
The hits keep on coming! The best value in entertainment by a mile.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo3yRLLrXQA
So tempted to get more here.

RBC says NFLX will double and the stock takes a tumble. OMG hahahaha

why is it going up all of a sudden?
"The share appreciation these last eighteen months or so has been unbelievable. Not complaining, but really wish I had purchased more than just the IRA yearly limit years ago."
Still think I'm crazy when I said this is heading to 310?
"For the sake of it's future technical health, I'd like to see NFLX fill this earnings gap before crushing the $260-65 area. Yes, they had an amazing quarter in terms of new subscriptions, but, the stock is expensive as heck... The chart looks like bitcoin. careful!"
"Watching a show on Netflix called The Queen’s Gambit. Have watched Stranger Things, the Marvel comics, etc. Shorts who say NFLX shows aren’t good and that Disney is going to own them need to get a clue. Shorts will get destroyed by this stock. It may not have moved much lately but that’s highly abnormal. Go ahead dislike this but you know I speak the truth. I’ve gotten filthy rich as a long predating multiple stock splits. All you shorts have by comparison is pocket change. Give me more of your money so I can get richer."
"If it closes above 355.20, it will be the first +16 day since June 13"
$NFLX $WIMI traders in these stocks are missing the nice run in $NVDA which had another 52 week high.$NVDA is the darling of wall street.
"In a day when it opens at least +6 and the high reaches at least +14, NFLX has never ended the day at less than +5.75"
"who is buying nflx at this price? shorts are, thanks"
Who is in at $593? Whoa 
I bought them at 369 and I am long term holder. This is going down every single day. Any thoughts why?
nflx was at $138.66 low this year. Now it is $315. This is roughly a increase in value or price of $180 or 150% in one year or 5 years. Can anyone complain about this appreciation in shareholder wealth?
Anybody else heard rumor that Netflix is planning on bundling MoviePass into their subscription?
Gonna hit $300 today? About time right?
Fast Money told the NFLX story perfect Up we go
Bad move by Netflix to relate anyway to politics. I like netflix but I just cancelled by subscription.
"What can happen to stock in weeks, look at $TSLA. It traded 365 on Monday and now 300. Only difference between Tesla and Netflix is, it pumped by CEO v/s Analyst. 5000/month which consider impossible 3 month Ago, Elon make it happen (Even while temporary) yet stock gone down 20% with sell on News.If anyone think this stock can't go 350, They will soon learn very expensive lessons."
put all your money in Netflix and just wait. u will be rich!
We jumped to $520 after price increases and election only to sell off 9% on vaccine news. Now when stay at home stocks are rallying this doesn’t recover even though it was punished with them. Roku 52 week high yesterday and today. Streaming is looking great. So naturally sell Netflix. Well I don’t want to argue with the market but how can you understand the market with such major disconnects.
Blowout earnings and $359?????
Anytime now 380.00

"Up 90+ in a month, shorts sure are getting crushed"
Beyond comprehension
This is not the beginning of some sort of recovery. This is an opportunity to eject and save losing a fortune
Just cancelled Netflix
I sold and took my profit .
El Camino was good and the Irishman coming up .... NFLX going back to 300s
"What's the feeling for next week? How do you guys think they did on net addition subscribers and eps? Will they beat? And if they beat, what will the future forecast look like? It would be nice if Cramer jumped on board, but I believe he is switching his footing on this a little bit based on an article published today by the street."
EASY MONEY!!!!
"quick question for you all, what is a more popular brand name? Netflix or Disney?? give it a thumbs up if you think it's Disney..."
up after hours! 53 cents!
Netflix is a favorite stock amongst millennials.
nasdaq up almost 50 pts and nflx falling. Not a good sign for today. That means when the nasdaq falls down we are just going down even more. May not be our day today people. Looks like were going red.
THE BULLS ARE COMING 375 soon start getting your saddle ready because it’s going to be a real ride. NETFLIX FOR LIFE
Netflix will be 150 per share at the end of 2019.
My calls paid off 
Netflix is raising monthly subsc by another $1 and the stock will jump another $40
"The market is controlled by people who are not YOU. Logic matters none. People are pulling their money out of tech (Nasdaq) and chasing money in the Dow...except the players have already made theirs, and the ones jumping in are going to get crumbs...then it will fall. Then the new people will panic, and move their money back into tech stocks."
"Netflix (NFLX) has 2 splits in our Netflix stock split history database. The first split for NFLX took place on February 12, 2004. This was a 2 for 1 split, meaning for each share of NFLX owned pre-split, the shareholder now owned 2 shares. For example, a 1000 share position pre-split, became a 2000 share position following the split. NFLX's second split took place on July 15, 2015. This was a 7 for 1 split, meaning for each share of NFLX owned pre-split, the shareholder now owned 7 shares. For example, a 2000 share position pre-split, became a 14000 share position following the split."
73.3 million international and 57.9 million domestic subscribers bringing its total to 131.2 millions. 
I am very curious about all this hype that Netflix did not reach subscriber growth numbers. This is true domestically but internationally they met the expected growth. One thing to note is Netflix market saturation domestically. They have already reached a HUGE amount that any more growth domestically will be expensive to maintain and grow. This is why I think that international growth should be the focus of Netflix in the coming years. Thoughts?
should get out now before they look again at the numbers and dump at the opening bell
In ten minutes Boom 350.00. Something is going to happen after 2:pm. Better buy now
why down ? did we get another downgrade ?
"I think today I have been convinced that we are going back to 350. This is just a slow drip at this point. All of us in above 400 will have the problem of people selling when they make a good profit. This have us locked in for while. I don't think I will hold through another ER report again, not worth the risk."
SWEET CHRISTMAS!! LOL
the green pattern was broken yesterday red is the new Netflix

"So all those calls I bought yesterday are in the money now, HAHAHA"
Analysts will be raising earnings and revenue estimates. Momentum investors will take this to 1000 by years end.
look out below!! here it goes tanking !!
Zm tanking and nflx another one to fall. Darlings are fading
Someone are donating $ to the brokerage banks by buying $581
Why dock you think ?
So buy netflix and hold to 1000?
If they are talking about buying back their own stock they must think it’s cheap. This increases the chances for another 7 to 1 stock split.
If you were long you could afford to have your own.
"Dear investors out there, talk to your CPA/CFA and ask them for advice on owning a stock with a current P/E ratio of over 200 and see what they tell you. I don't care if you sell or not, I'm just providing you with useful information (I swear that I'm not short....wish I was). It's 1999-2000 all over again, we all know how that ended!! Back in 1999-2000 I had a stock that I purchased for $5 and saw it go up to $100 and missed the opportunity on selling thinking that it would go up more.....needless to say I lost on making a bundle of money."

Tomorrow should open at $390’s
"Netflix price target raised to $700 from $650 at Morgan Stanley, OverweightMorgan Stanley analyst Benjamin Swinburne raised the firm's price target on Netflix to $700 from $650 and keeps an Overweight rating on the shares, stating that the ""moment has arrived"" that he has long believed would come when the company moves to ""sustained and substantial"" annual free cash flow. His new forecast for Netflix to begin share repurchases later this year, and assumption for $2B in share repurchases during the second half of 2021, compares to his prior estimate of buybacks coming in 2023, Swinburne noted."
Ha to 600 she goes !!!
Single biggest indicator that Netflix will hit it out of the park on Monday is their Q2 guidance for 6.2 million subscriber adds. The previous high for a Q2 guide was 3.2 million. They really didn't need to guide that high unless subscriber adds were going through the roof.
good price to buy now?
5-1 split would be nice
What are the predictions for Netflix this year. Netflix will go back to $400+ as streaming numbers overseas ramps up exponentially and foreign investment tapers down while investment in movies remain the same. Profit will start to rise by end of year
Haven't heard any genius analyst upgrades lately. What happened?
"The longs laughed two years ago when I said that it is a mathematical certainty that this company will be bankrupt in five years. The voices agreeing with me are growing louder and louder as the debt continues to grow with still no path for stopping the hemorrhaging. Reed Hastings is Bernie Madoff, but much much better"
I've waited too long to buy in and I did 2 weeks ago. I'm going nowhere. for 2 years I thought it would fizzle due to competition and it just keeps on chugging.
unbelievable 450 coming
The fun has just begun. Bloodbath continuing AH and will likely follow through tomorrow big time.
Why down? Earnings leaks? Anyone?
riot qs nndm dtea riot mara trxc zi
NFLX is a big embarrassing for market due to its founder's lacking of innovation ability!

"You all can buy now. I sold my shares, which is a market indicator that it will rise."
"Netflix is licensing its movies to China's iQiyi on a movie by movie basis, that's the way for the company to enter China."
You should never sell on fear. Always stay positive closing 325.00 today. More green to come to a movie near you
I sold my shares showing profit. Still holding some leaders in red. Fortunately I raised cash to buy cheap good leaders stocks. Anyhow market still overpriced reason I was cautious
I say this pops near $360
Isn't it amazing how buyers show up all at once?
"anybody who wants to sell, ask yourself.... who will dominate television in ten years and command any price they want? they have an impenetrable moat and they have tons of growth opportunity in raising prices and limiting users per account. they can double revenue if they wanted. its a no brainer stock and it'll be 1000 in two years max."
going up now
"Geez, what a run!Time for a pullback"
"Take over the world, Netflix"
Earnings not just important for Netflix but for all of tech.. Not a holder but fingers crossed for a strong earnings beat.. Hope it goes well.
"Volume is low, it is just manipulation. Hold on!"

What's the easiest way to buy downside protection with options?
Funny thing about next bear market / correction / recession for $NFLX $AAPL $FB $GOOG $AMZN $NVDA $TSLA etc ... is that we won’t even see it coming.
Notice how pre-market NASDAQ up but then fades after open? They need retail to buy their shares.
After hours UP 15 points
Desperation in the NFLX bashers’ posts—-
Call sellers got to be crying.
"Here is cost of 4 person family with all subscription1.> Cable Internet only:- $60/month2.> Wireless :- $45/line = $180/month3.> Netflix :- $16/month4.> Amazon prime :- $10/month5.> Music subscription $20/month6.> Live tv channel :- $30/month.7.> $25/line Phone monthly installment;_ $100 (Assume upgrade every 3 year)total:- $400-$450/month just for internet/entertainment.This does not count any other game services subscripiton, Software subscription like Office, Cloud... Game Software cost, On demand rental and so on.Overall I think average is $500+ per family of 4.So while $2 increase is small, it can cause low user look for alternative like Amazon Prime and Hulu and cut Netflix or start rotating service to save money."
"Debtflix's junk bond addction:""When Netflix (NFLX) priced a $1.9B junk bond deal early last week, it got me pondering the companies with the largest equity market capitalizations in the high-yield corporate debt space. After all, you do not often see companies with a $135B market cap issuing high-yield debt. While the equity market is painting a rosy outlook for the internet entertainment and digital content company, the outlook from the rating agencies and bond market is less optimistic. Netflix's new ten-year debt carried a 5.875% coupon, a 291bp spread over Treasuries at issuance. The interest cost on Netflix's debt is roughly 2% higher than where high-quality, low-levered, A-rated companies issue debt in today's market.When we look at the companies in the high-yield corporate bond market (HYG, JNK) with the largest equity market caps, Netflix certainly stands out. It is nearly twice as large from a capitalization perspective as the next largest junk-rated company, Charter Communications (CHTR)."""
not buying into this sell off...still holding
I'm curious to know the thoughts people have on the evaluation. give a thumbs up if its undervalued and thumbs down if it's over valued
In and out already - made $6k in 5 minutes.
1700 shares long
Let’s go!!!
My average cost 245
Nice close.
Hard to believe this worth $1350 per subscriber
"it’s hard to believe that even after that massive breakout, we’re only up 6% for 2021"
It needs to break 310 resistance.
why going down now...can someone explain?
i am hoping Monday is good day for NFLx . but need to wait until 12.05pm . you will see big change at 12.50pm. and stock will hit atleast $ 433
OVERSOLD as usual - BUY Opportunity
Who bought in a few days ago at 315 or less? How wonderful. I love myself.
stock market will hit new highs so stay long. don't overthink and trade this market.
This ain't stopping till 250
Oh my god I love Netflix
NFLX 375 tomorrow
"This will hit $550 by friday! No worries, have you seen the charts, option charts, and expected earnings! this is going to the moon finally."
"God, I love this stock. Been holding it for years. I've ignored all the naysayers dismiss it countless times over the years because it always defies the skeptics and critics. And I credit Reed Hastings for much of the stock's resilience and growth: He never hesitates to admit when he's messed up, and always offers a solution to fix it - and he's always been right so far. Even earlier today when the stock was getting sold off, some were speculating on this board that ""smart money"" must have known something ahead of the earnings release - when, clearly, they didn't."
We’re up PM when most stocks are falling... this might run within the next few days
What is there left to watch on Netflix? All the goodies got delayed or cancelled. Give me your top 3 or 5 or whatever
Why this is red again?????????????????
Next week!
If they beat next quarter then the tone on this board will change instantly.
Wow the market is very red today. What is going on today. A lot of other companies are down 6 to 10%. It will go back up. It’s following the market right now. It’s a trend
oh yea...everyone is an expert.
385 before earnings. Easy.
Let's face it. HBO Max is going to have better content next year.
The stock chart is telling us loud and clear that TV watchers will always choose the service that gives them more for their money.
"Good ride today short at 402, now long at 392.5."
Should Amazon buy Netflix?
"bought at 362, good luck to me and all"
Nearly 300 PE...Seems legit.
It’s jumped 30-40% within the last 15 days. I guess that’s enough for small investors like us. I’ll probably take out my profit before closing and I wish a GL to those who stay
DONT MISS THE EARNINGS RUN UP! THIS DIP IS SHAKING OFF PEOPLE
"I think Apple parked all that cash , buy Netflix "
"As a die-hard long, I live for days like this!"
"Raising prices now? Not committed to growth anymore? Investors are looking at this the wrong way lmao. In my view, this actually hints at sub growth not meeting expectations come earnings. Why else would you stunt your growth right now just as more competitors are ramping up their offerings?"
the will try to close 350 but the market and buffet push to 370
"Good luck tomorrow Netflix price target raised to $440 at RBC Capital MarketsMARKETWATCH — 09/06/2018 3:01 PM ETAnalysts at RBC Capital Markets raised their price target for Netflix (NFLX.NaE) to $440 from $360 on Thursday, citing survey results showing high satisfaction and an increase in usage among U.S. and U.K. consumers. In a survey of over 1,500 U.S. consumers, 57% of respondents said they used Netflix (NFLX.NaE), up from 55% in May 2018 and 53% in September 2017. The survey also showed that 68% of Netflix (NFLX.NaE) subscribers were ""extremely"" or ""very satisfied"" with their experience. A hefty 84% percent of subscribers said they were ""not at all likely"" or ""slightly likely"" to cancel in the next three months, though that figure was below the 87% average of the last five quarters. In the U.K., 56% of respondents said they used Netflix (NFLX.NaE), up from 49% last year. Eight percent of subscribers in the U.K. said they were ""extremely"" or ""very"" satisfied with the service, and churn levels in the U.K. were at a record low; a record 71% said they were ""not at all"" or ""slightly likely"" to cancel in the next 3 months. ""We believe that Netflix (NFLX.NaE) has achieved a level of sustainable scale, growth, and profitability that isn't currently reflected in its stock price,"" wrote RBC analysts, led by Mark Mahaney, in a note to investors. He said he also sees potential in Netflix's (NFLX.NaE) push into India. ""India could well be a source of millions of new Netflix (NFLX.NaE) subscribers over the next few years,"" he wrote, ""but the company has a lot of work to do."" An RBC review of local Indian news sources suggested Netflix (NFLX.NaE) was off to a good start; its original series ""Sacred Games"" has become highly popular in the region. Mahaney also reiterated the company's outperform rating. Netflix (NFLX.NaE) shares have gained 80% so far this year, while the S&P 500 has gained 7.6%."
More subscribers than expected makes competitors less willing to compete with Netflix on price.
"185-275 old record jan 2018, new record in bull market 235 to 330 or 335. The politcal give 100% support of stockbubble the hardest bubble to pop ever."
I’m buying more more MORE I LOVE NETFLIX
"IMO NFLX would not be increasing prices if they are losing Subs. This increase is going to add ~$1B domestically and another ~$1B from international Subs. Their model is working and Sub must be increasing, otherwise they would not be raising prices, esp in light of competition from DIS/T. I think 4Q earnings are going to be good.Good luck to all."
"I'm betting around 4PM, it could touch 416-417...."
Really an upgrade of whole $10 at level $400 that’s an upgrade of 2% makes all sense to buy it now
Has anyone actually looked at the company's balance sheet and cash flow statement. This is a $20 company based on future growth! Talk about a bubble waiting to burst...dot.com all over again.
"WOW, so happy after s triple weeks it comes green yeeeeeey..."
Recently sold all my Netflix shares because this stock can correct all the way to 150; this period reminds me of 1999 where stocks like Cisco and sun Microsystems disappeared and investors lost 90 percent of their money
"After seeing the combo of a bullish engulfing pattern along with a sharp move off the 50% retracement yesterday, today is no surprise at all. This stock has shown it can go up with frightening momentum. Shorts cover while you can."
Good earnings call. I recommend you all listen. They have sufficient new content for the rest of this year and next year. Good guidance. In addition they are in contact with many offers to buy content. Netflix will rule for several quarters to come. IMHO
What percentage of people on here making negative comments also subscribe to Netflix??
"It's clear now, it was Netflix that opted not to renew the Disney movie deal. At the MoffetMathanson media and communication conference Sarandos pointed to new, big budget titles as 1 area where it no longer makes sense for Netflix to spend a ton of money - because if you really want to catch the latest blockbuster, you probably already saw it in theaters.""We said, maybe we can put the billion dollars we'd put in an output deal into original films"" he said."

Nasdaq way over-valued. NFLX at the extreme end of the universe. (like the star that's 40 billion light years away). At some point the Universe will collapse or the star will die. Your choice! The inverse Bang is in the making.
Q4 quarantines worldwide will skyrocket this earnings....will hit 575 next week

No way it doesn't go test the 328 low at this point.

How did a $30 dollar stock get to $300....
"I'll be shocked, shocked I tell ya, if Netflix holds positive. A lot of people are waiting for this high tide to jump ship."
"Unprecedented? No, I think not. Anyone recall March 10th, 2000? I think we are headed to repeat that scenario very soon."
Stop talking about earnings/EPS. Everyone knows this stock only trades on subs. Needs to break 5 mil int'l subs to keep soaring
If it hit's 595 I'm topping off my short for some serious gains tomorrow so I can cover at 550's I mean who the heck is buying still at this range? I know true investors will dislike but us who day trade and swing trade follow if you want to make easy fast money. I'm sure it will come back to this price range later this year but man way too high to try to maintain short term
sucker's rally in the opening hour?slowly drifting down ... distribution continues?closing below open.
Pps bloated beyond belief.HBO Max far superior!!After Queens Gambit nothingreally great added.Mediocrity at best!!!
Will close green
I told u to sell yesterday
about $40 Billion of annual reveue
What you all think will it best earnings? And stock will jump?
"If you're still long NFLX by the close then, my hat's off to you. I just sold my 100 shares. I made 31% in under 4 months."

There is a reason Netflix is shooting up guys . I’ll leave it to you to find out . But I’m very bullish for earnings and think this should see 400.
"Netflix can quickly propel much much higher from where we are... it just dawned on me that the price increases that will come will greatly improve profitability. Think about it, 1 dollar more a month and double its current profit of .79c a share... ie: close to 2 bucks a quarter, 8 bucks a year. Suddenly, this doesn't look pricey. Does Netflix have the pricing power? Reed is going to be pumping out the best content and believes that will command a higher price. I agree. Netflix is growing a huge moat, and it will continue to get bigger and bigger.... greatly fortifying its position. PS: That was only for 1 price hike... what if they pump out the content its users woud be willing to pay $2 extra, $3 extra... etc. Big money in Netflix."
HBO Max is so much betterthan Netflix. No comparison whatsoever. Every title downloadable. I have had Netflix forFREE for at least 2.5 years.Why is the stock SO BLOATED?
Another possible high flyer ? Check out LX. Stock is projecting huge earnings in 2018 and up on huge volume. Go LX and NFLX
$132B Market Cap. PE 200+ and they have to finance $1.5B debt? Red flags all over the place. When a company like this is operating a light speed and cannot pay off debt from over inflated stock valuation - run and run fast.
i just cannot stop smiling and laighing  hit loke if u feeling the same 60 share at 500
"Goldman Sachs is out bullish on NFLX just 2 weeks ahead of its earnings report, reiterating buy rating and a 12-month price target of 470 (reduced from 490 but still highest on Street). They must know something, hmm..."
$19/sh rise on this stock in one day is totally absurd. Market deserved a recovery today but NFLX's rise is insane.
450 next week plz
I only have 20 shares of NFLX but sold it all at $294 and change. That's how you lock in profit. I'll buy it all back somewhere in the low to mid 280's.
"somebody just bought 95,000 shares.. wow"
Dis going to take NFLX spot in line lol
"Can't find any news on it, why is it popping on heavy volume? Thx"
This stock typically wakes up late. Just watch later today and tomorrow
They raise their prices $1.00 a month and stock goes up $84???? What a world we live in
3.6 million shares traded generates $2B of added market cap on no news. Right.
downgrade nation tomorrow
michael jordan exclusive netflix documentary coming. Cool.
What is this about AMZN ER having effect on Netflix stock prices? Do you watch Netflix while ordering online on Amazon? Or do you put Netflix on hold while rush out to front door to pick up amazon delivery? If you do any of these activities multitasking then there is nothing to worry about either one!
"Unless Reed Hasting can do better quarterly projection numbers and slow down the spend, NFLX will eventually be bought out IMHO (especially if the stock price continues to fall). But by who and why?Why - NFLX has 150M+ subs and gets the acquirer (with deep pockets), immediately into the market.Who:0) FB - yes Facebook, deep pockets and they have already signaled more of a video offering play in their services roadmap.1) AT&T - deep pockets (but already carrying a lot of debt) still trying to figure how they get their OTT offering off the ground DirecTV now had mixed success. UVerse and DirecTV are legacy products, that are losing subs2) AMZN - deep pockets and their video platform hasn't really taken off (bundled with Prime). NFLX acquisition could give them another paid offering which also runs on AWS.3) Comcast - deep pockets, unlikely unless they want to jump start their OTT offering.4) AAPL - deep pockets, but unlikely due to the positioning of their upcoming OTT platform, unless they want immediate market share5) DIS - deep pockets and most unlikely, unless they want to offer a differentiated content offering platform vs DIS+.Just my 2c. GTLA (except the trolls on this board)"
CNBC just reviewed the Ican and Ackman brawl. I remem ber Ican said he sold nflx year and half ago citing competition. Boiy he sold too early. All the shorts who took his selling as a sign to short were wiped out. LOL
"SWING SWING SWING...I warned you guys...and I offered my levels. but no one listens on hear, i only get bashed EVEN WHEN IM RIGHT 100% of the time.....FYI, 90% of swing trading is knowing the stock market.

AAPL is going to determine a Dead cat bounce or not.
Support on Netflix looking good.

I like NFLX but the price needs to drop. I need an entry point bad :)
"NFLX was up 40,000% since 2002.IQ is up 100% since it’s IPO March 29, 2018 as a spin-off of the Internet search engine Baidu.Move to IQ."
HBO still bigger than Netflix on Pay TV and Hulu catching up quickly on Domestic.Hulu added 3 million in just 3 month and reach 20M+ compare to Netflix 55M.With recent partnership with Spot they going to get even more subscriber this 3 month.Now People can sure keep multiple subscription but when they paying for multiple they will think about rotating soon and when that start Netflix will have hard time keep 55M subscriber even.
their Q3 Projection to add 5.00 millions. i really think they will beat it. they didnt say 5.15 or 5.05 like before. they picked 5 millions because they know they will beat it .
THE BEST SHORT STOCK IN THE BUSINESS!

Does anyone think this will go beyond 250 tommorrow?
Why always going down .. I bought for 423 .. losses a lots of money ..hahayyyy
People are investing in Netflix like their Subscriber growth not slowing ever. It's own history is not consistent. But at least until now it keep growing so far.But if you look into HBO history. Incredible growth between 2010 to 2014 ( from 81 million to 138 million ) subscriber. It then dip next year to 132 Million subscriber. What will happen to Netflix price specially if remain inflated like this.https://www.statista.com/statistics/329277/number-hbo-subscribers/

How many shorties are hurt today ?
350 today
"strap in, here we go again!!!!!"
I’m out
Nflx is no longer a one trick pony streaming service. It's also a movies producer aka pocket Hollywood.
Priced for perfection and this report was not perfect. Means it goes down big tomorrow.
but will be 430+ before ER??? who with me??
REALLY need an earnings beat!
Streaming services are losing a lot of money. Licensing to Netflix pays more than streaming. We have seen a shift from cable TV to streaming and now we will see a shift from content producers streaming their own content to content producers licensing their content to Netflix.
"Once AO was the 'first mover and leader' of the internet... once Yahoo was the 'first mover and leader' of email and search.Netflix does not have a huge selection of content, many Netflix investors are going to learn very quickly when Disney, Marvel, Star Wars, Pixar, Fox, etc. is pulled from Netflix just how sparse their content is. It will be worse when Warner/HBO follows suit."
tomorrow 348 and friday 360 should be tested.
There was a famous investor...I don't recall his name...way back when...he was asked how he achieved superior returns in the market. He said he wouldn't invest in something unless it could move wildly in either direction. That if it couldn't go down 20 percent just as easily as up 60...he wouldn't touch it. Nflx is one of those. High risk high reward. Z
go green tomorrow
All the hype is on acm and nkla and gme
"My objective two cents on earnings:Content spend will be outrageously highSubs will be ,Price increase announcement was an attempt to neutralize content spend.Will it work? Who knows. We will find out Thursday but any stock that has increased 50% in a month is primed for a correction"
"Something I just noticed. We last hit 300 a month ago today. First time NFLX hit 300 was back on March 2.From March 2 to Nov. 14, it was 300+ in 170 of 180.The the longest it went not in 300 during the stretch was 9 days March 28 to April 10. And then ONE day in Oct. 30.Dec. 3, we got to 298.72 and then closed the day 290.30Next day, 295.74 and closed 275.30We are going to need a good run to hit 300 again this year."
Up 44 percent since December 24th. Up 103 points. And still room to run up to the all time high 423. Earnings report and guidance will blast NFLX up. Award winning product. Superior subscriber growth. A+++++++
NFLX should try to buy rights on James Bond 007 to produce series.....Holly graal!!!!!!!!!
If we get 4.5% up today we may catch another 5% shortly and settle $333.
Nice time to buy.
"Bought another 100 on dip, can’t lose."
whats a better buy Apple or NFLX i am confused
Won't go green today..... Just hope can stay around 407-409
If a big buyer steps in tomorrow shorts might lose 10% in 2 days :O
"APPL, FB and other fangs could pull back this week from sell the news. WYNN setting up for nice long"
Stiiiiiiilll going higher.....
"Goldman reiterates 400$ buy and adds nflx to conviction list, GM shorts"
it the same trading pattern every quarter which usually take a few days to truly pop. should be over 600 by mid week next week. just watch.
"I like to get everyone opinion.Who ever investing thinking this company can raise their price to infinite, Question:- Company announce raise at start of october. Overall that workout about 9% of value.Is All Subscriber cost raised already? Does any one has any clue where they stand on price raise.I will put my answer in reply. Please provide your opinion as well."
"STILL a SOLID BUY, can we see 360 today NOW that the Drama is over and the dust has stopped,"
$NIO $GOOG $NFLX $WIMI this market is definitely a sight to see. It baffles me that people are short right now
Options writers win again.
Left my position in NFLX at $379 - best decision I’ve made recently and invested in Roku - do your dd.
"Do most of you hold through earnings, got in at 250, im a nflx vitgian"
"Having gotten back into NFLX for the first time in almost three months, it is good to see the stellar quality of the shorts posting on the Netflix thread. It bodes well for a long trade."
Who is buying this - same business model as Tesla - wait another 3-6 months
NFLX putting in a bid to buy DIS soon.
Entire market was down today. Every day is not going to be green. Not worried at all. Full steam ahead to 500
I think the country and Trumps base has had about enough of this. You want a country divided you got it!!!
433$ tomorrow hold tha stock.
the party is about to begin!
All stocks are in green.. only this one is showing weakness
Don't buy into GS's bs. It is so funny to read that the street is trying to 'decouple' NFLX from the FANG and this stock is running purely on the new 'Brick box' release.
"Another Boeing debacle... Netflix ends year strong, but questions surface about 2020https://www.marketwatch.com/story/netflix-stock-falls-on-soft-forecast-heightened-competition-2020-01-21"
"Didn't like the afternoon selloff, but ending up $3 on a day when all of the major averages were noticeably down is still pretty good. I agree with some of the other posts - tomorrow we'll probably drop a few dollars early, then slowly rise throughout the day to finish somewhere in the mid-370s."
"It looks everyone is bashing Netflix, Just like they used to say, Tesla."
Wait till next year double
"so some analyst pumped price target by $100, and that's worth company entire 2017 revenue. hmmm it all makes sense."
"I guess the high PE is scaring some investors due to what they say is nose bleed. Well I guess my AMZN was that way too at one time. But look what happened.Just #$%$ a major investor said years ago, buy what you like and others do as well, and invest in it. Well for me that meets the requirements for investing in Netflix. If I had to pay $15 a month I'd still use it.No politics, If I care not to watch them, and the greatest thing! No f,,,,ng commercials!!We do have cable for my wife by the way since she likes to watch her stuff. For me, I haven't watch nothing but Netflix for two years.I'll give a prediction. I think there is a good chance that Netflix will double their subscription base in 2-3 yearsWhy? because everyone I know has it and loves it>"
Thumbs up if you think this is going up after earnings or thumbs down if you think it’ll dip. Vote now!
"Everyone knows about Netflix. Netflix is the biggest streaming site in the world. The confidence and the trust for Netflix is really high. The stock value is about 80 times more than the revenue, we feel confident in that, price target higher than todays value.I wanna give you a tips. a streaming site, Mavshack, that has been active as long as the Netflix was active until 2011 had a stock value not even three times more then the revenue until a few days ago. In 2011 Netflix was worth as most 48 dollars, only a year later in 2012 it went down to $7, even though Netflix had 26 million subscribers, it was increasing in subscribers. Netflix was worth in its bottom only $7.00. Today 2020 Netflix is worth around $500. That means that Netflix increased its stock value with more than 7000% since its bottom in 2012. Mavshack have had a similar road until now as Netflix had its first 10 year on the market until 2012. Mavshack is increasing alot in the amount of subscribers. But the stock value have not shown its true value. The stock value has been very volatile and also has been on a down side for a long time. many investors been sceptical an pessimism have been around the stock for a while.But now its going to be a change, December 3rd 2020 it was announced that Mavshack will start Europe's largest shopping studio in collaboration with the NEP the world's leading technical production company for live productions and events. together with an EP marshak Salma has created the market's most elegant and cost effective VR studio. the market cap of Mavshack is only around 12 million American dollars. the stock is around its bottom. I can't see it getting much lower than it is now.. Now many feel like it's abiously that the stock is going to increase. With more good news about the streaming, live-sport coming up after realease of corona-restrictions and also the live shopping studio this stock can increase very rapidly and high in stock value. My own price target for this stock is around 400% for the upcoming year. I have been following this company for a long time and now I see a bright future for the company, its been an annoying ride until now. Please do your own anilyses and look this up. I feel very sure about that this stock is going to increase a lot upcoming years even though nothing in this world is totally sure. Maybe you would like to invest little in mavshack to get a big opportunity to get a big return out of it . I would still say Netflix is a more safe option but Mavshack is a great spice to it. Have a lot more potential to grow away higher in percentage. Have a pleasant day"
"Said $335 closing price, pretty close, anyways congrats to all alongs. $400 is soon to come, huge rally coming up and solid earnings are boosting all sectors. Financial leading with solid revenue and earnings especially Goldman Sachs beating EPS by more than a $1, economy strong and forward outlook of 4% GDP by mid 2019."
Just like they depressed the price this morning so that they could buy more at a lower entry point.
"Up $4.60 already in the premarket, nice upward pressure, we’re gonna see $410+ today."
"S&P volume is very low, and it's up like crazy, so I expect a deep deep drop next week"
"FAKE ACCOUNTS are being added to $NFLX to PUMP its stock price, as its earnings are tanking!"
something is burning ....
Only question now is does this run into the close. Why not. Finish 210.75. Next week hits 220 and 230 before ER. If that is good it's 250 by end of January.
No question in today’s environment...you HAVE to take advantage of days like today. This would be down $12-$18 if the Nasdaq was down 1%. Can’t be on the dock watching as the speed boats race by.
"I’m no expert, but isn’t 380 in the opposite direction? Goldman ?"
It will stop at $373 today!!!
370 coming big block buys
14m people dropped cable tv last year. Next year it is expected to boom to 47m. Those cutting the cord will be buying both Disney and netflix-both will be winners. A lot cheaper than that 100.00/mo cable bill.
Could be a 100 point drop tomorrow
Careful fellow shorts. NFLX went on a subscriber gain blitz giving away 3 month trials. Subscriber count will jump artificially.
418. At the open today.
Recommend pulling up Tillys past posts...see how accurate he's been. A 'genius. Z
When is Ozarks 4 being releases
shorts are scraping up their holiday shopping funds here today.......smh
BUY NOW! Thank me next week.
I love the fact the media is playing Netflix like it's the whole market.
Bulls always fall for bull traps. That’s why cows often get eaten by bears 
Any green better than any red.
"You truly are hurting if you think DISNEY is going to do anything. DIS, the company with NEGATIVE earnings. You realize last quarter earnings were the same as the ones from EIGHT years ago. AMZN, DIS, Apple, have had a decade to do something, they are going to do nothing. Netflix will be 400 first quarter next year easily....get on board or get left behind."
Serious question. Anyone think this could sink to 230-240 by next week? or is 250 its baseline?
Looks like 320 is the resistance line
Futures up. Let's see if we see 280 tomorrow
all in and not going to fold.
What’s everyone thinking how this could go

"And there ladies and Gentlemen is the ""Option Boy Spike"" I talked about earlier. They have had to work very hard today to keep this above 285 with absolutely zero institutional interest in this stock in a big up day. but things must be done and it simply is not allowed that retail put buyers make money so they must be destroyed,"

"Its hilarious how Netflix is down 1.5% on a red market day, and shorts try to act like the sky is falling. This could be green by days end."
Recession is imminent. Dow all the way to 17000 range. NFLX will be a good buy at 120-130 range
The results were so good googl and amzn went up 5%

Netflix has reached escape velocity. 1 billion subscribers is in the cards.
soemoen on my FB posted sometihng saying that netflix is oversold and he doesn't recommend buying right now. He said it has a high P-R ratio or something (which I don't know what he means) and he said when the market correciton comes this stock will be tumble to $280-$300. this has me worried and I just want to know what others think. He said the $500 price targets don't matter to him because he stil won't buy. is he just saying this to make people sell so he can buy? Please advise.
This thing could go up to 360 tomorrow. Shortsville is boiling over now.
Everything is getting slaughtered today. The way this is holding up is impressive. But if market continues to selloff I doubt how long this can hold up. Hopefully we get a market reversal soon.
HP coming to netflix in Sept!
"25000 call options expiring this Friday, $600 strike. Someone knows !"
Going to $1000
"I just thoroughly reviewed their last quarter and it's worse than I thought. Liquid cash is about 3.3B and liabilities are 21B. Note that doesnt count off balance sheet items. Net operating income only increased 2.8% over prior year. There is a 141M net addition in the interest and other income line vs prior year first quarter. That's a non recurring event and cant be looked at in valuation. If they earn $3 a share in 2019 that's a 120 PE. Couple that with very moderate Operating income, leveraged balance sheet and increased competition, this stock could, and should, take a material hit. Do your own DD, but the results just dont justify this 158B valuation!! Wow."
Could be 100 bucks streaming is slow sometimes.
NFLX barely has a presence in China which is the primary reason for AAPL's revenue issues. Robots are trading this. Will snap back tomorrow when actual people are trading.

afternoon turnaround anyone?
Netflix will post good results i have a feeling.
"This stock will lose an average of two points everyday heading into next earnings. The decline just got ahead of itself. It’s right back on the linear regression line now. Look back at my post from earlier. I said it will got to $230 and then decline again. Guess what? Here we are. May go up a bit more, but just remember am average of two points for each trading day heading into earnings"
"10,000 calls, $550 strike expiring this Friday. Let's go !"
Does IBD amateur writers ever watch NFLX for possible breakout? Answer is : no;These IBD writers should get more experience in stock market; Jim Cramer is far superior than those IBD writers!
"Good bye Netflix, you just lost 1 subscriber"
first down day this is going to get shorted big time
Two more PT upgrades today. Total of 6 since yesterday
looks like 50 plus tommomrow?
Buying opportunity
WIN. WIN. WIN.
No news why down?
More 225 Puts bought then 225 Calls
last earnings it was hovering 400 albeit it dropped after the good earnings. now it's at 20 percent or so less.
I bet Amazon or Apple is buying it
This should be exploding with GOOG news. I was hoping for $366. Cmon NFLX. Momo coming back here.
Market hoping NFLX earnings will reverse the market correction. God help us all.
I am from Europe so we don't have Disney+ nor Apple stream here yet. But i read a lot of people talking about on this board. Do they have many subscribers in the US or the rest of the world compared to Netflix 150 million? How close are they in terms of catching up? Can't find it anywhere. They must be around 100 million subscribers each orso already since everyone is boasting about them... Help?
"told you so: market up, NFLX down; market down, NFLX also down;Classic laggard stock==strong sell=see ya at 150!"
"be alert: July 16, NFLX will report earnings: blowout!"
Analysts lost so much money they gotta upgrade stocks to make back their loses 
Still trading at 265 p/e. P/E = 50 is more appropriate and thats where this wall street scam stock will be. Just look at how much money this company is burning each quarter. Debt is going up big time. Yea keep funding free users with debt and let wall street manipulators keep upgrading because number of users are increasing but nobody talks about billions of new debt being added every year. This Dot Com II bubble will go bonker big time anytime soon now.
We saw $375 last week. Hoping to see to $380 this week.
signed up disney package and cancelled netflix. loving the content and quality
This is beginning to look like its being wslked down slowly. Time will tell. In the mean time GLTA.
"Netflix has huge upside, I won't be surprised if it closes over 450 by the end of next week."
BREAKING: Trump ordered another 200 billions worth of tariff against chinese goods... China said they will retaliate. Chinese stock market index fell more than 1.7%... Now trade war begins.
$20 is my threshold before I would cancel Netflix. Quick survey on others threshold
"in a previous post I took the revenue growth rate quarter to quarter and compounded it and got 18% growth ratethat's the most up to date picture of what is going on and things got worse with Coronavirusfor example Nedham sees Coronavirus a risk to Netflix's global growth content cost went up abut 30% as wellso why does Netflix deserve a PE of 94, when Google has a PE of 25, Disney at 17.6, Apple at 21 all yesterday's numbers (but close to today, today is higher)And as you know Netflix has a negative cash flow of around 3.2 BillionI think Netflix's price should be cut in half at least. I see half as happening quick and more later, it should be on par with the competition."
Netflix has more subscribers than US cable TV subscribers https://twitter.com/_AlphaStreet/status/985988462519107587
"thats all???? all the cries for 30 bucks under a share? if you look any farther than a day, week and even a month... nothing to worry. to big of a company to fold after a bad qtr. and u know what, not as bad of a report than many talk about. invest.... and go live your life. do not check any stock on hourly basis. not healty down the road"
Subscriber beat with positive guidance and stock flies
NFLX SHORTS! Lol
Should be fairly big gains today. Not good.
Shorts after hours seeing the upgrade
Netflix Releases First-Quarter 2018 Financial Resultshttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/netflix-releases-first-quarter-2018-200500046.html
"Netflix will be 1600 in 3 years easy. The vix is high right now but this puppy grows 40% and up every year. This company has many more years of growth. Pricing can still increase not just domestic but many of its international market many times over. The market can absorb more price increases for years to come and that alone is enough to buy and hold this stock for many years. But wait there is more to this story, by next year Netflix will have more original movies than all of Hollywood combine and that will also equate to 250 million subs by end of next year. With those numbers this company goes back to the green and all those analyst that complains about debt will have nothing else to write."
At this pace we will reach 400 today Mark these words
should buy more now?
Below 525 by Friday
NFLX has never ever missed 2 earnings in a row in the company history..... Easy money this evening.
"The nasdaq will bust through 14,000 very, very soon!!"
"Throughout this month, a huge amount of money has entered the market. Popular stocks like NFLX are bought big time causing the parabola we are seeing in the price. Once the gotta buy syndrome ends, NFLX pulls back. Maybe to $230, where the breakout occurred."
"37 million new subscribers to end the year. Shares up by 48% over the past 12 months, that led to its revenue rising to $25 billion. The No. 1 streaming service company definitely not slowing down.And because of the pandemic, we saw a big shift to streaming, making an opportunity for growth and a more healthy and intensified competition between other streaming giants. https://zyne.com/stock/NFLX"
This will double from here
Doctors in stocks try to organize competition between NFLX and DIS....But in facts both companies are complementary.....Content is not the same and most of subscribers will have both......Still cheaper than a movie theater per month.....For thousands of top series and films.....
340$ is within the reach.
So Time warner is doing what Netflix was saying for years now. Very smart. How will you recoup your money????
What is happening? Is AAPL buying NFLX?
easy 380 friday and 400 14 day 21 days easy 420 follow nasdaq that garanti is going to make new high.
Large buy block.
its over :(
I told all of you that mutual funds would buy more today. Did you listen ?
Ok guys.. 300 is very near.. we should break it and move past that by the end of the week!
"So judging by how much $AMZN, $GOOG, $FB and some others have dropped after hours due to the miss of $NFLX, $NVDA should wear the loss like a badge of honor as the company has arrived?"
learn each and every time on how to trade options and get slowly better at entering and exiting a trade! $NFLX $WIMI
Good late day buying signals!
It’s gonna reach 355-360 tomorrow and 400 before earnings
Buy buy buy it will go up today
At last the stock didnt justify its $80+ move in 3 months and was all HYPE.
Hoping 392 by Friday
NFLX was trading around 278$ yesterday then it ran to 285 due to news that Altice intergrades it to it top box set.The stop losses will kick in til 271.5 where I will cover my shares .imo
"Love, Love, Love $SPOT. Started with disrupting the music streaming industry, now moving onto podcasts, which are huge among younger people. I would love if they added audiobooks and competed with Audible, Scribd, etc. but we will see. For younger investors, if you want exposure to the future of entertainment, buy $SPOT and $NFLX. Both the music and movie/show entertainment will be covered."
345 Target for today/this week
"Ok with the fervor dying down a bit I’d like to re-ask my question from yesterday. Netflix has a massive debt load. Interest rates are going up. Has anyone looked into how this will impact their profits?Not trying to attack, just wondering.(And to head off the one response I got yesterday, I know they are saying they will not need to borrow new money. But they still have to deal with the debt they already have, and interest rates will not remain constant as debt is refinanced or as bond values go down.)"
Golden Cross??GB?? speak my language.
Good thing I didn't sell.
"Last week every news headline everywhere was how we were in a recession and manufacutering index tanking, china index tanking. A few days later, now we are in a boom cycle. All those news disappear from the Internet. Very nice how quickly we came out of the recession"
300 soon
$NFLX BUBBLE Chasers will BURN TERRIBLY!KEEP GAMBLING in that BUBBLE!
Will open at $410 tomorrow morning and will run up to $420
"Netflix said they already surpassed the amount of subscribers of the entire year of 2019, finally gonna be cash flow positive in 2020 and this still ranked? Wall Street is never satisfied but this will keep going up"
It's all in the GUIDANCE.
"If Netflix has a fantastic report, how much upsides we see after hour."
way too sudden of a jump IMHO. wish I bought the dip but just shorted 600 shares for a quick gain tomorrow sell off it will most likely hit at the very least 540 easily hopefully 515 is the target though and then 500 buy into it if it hits that low. this thing always drops hard after such huge pop always.....
"I can't stop laughing. I am looking at $NFLX (This is stock I started actually shorting market and have bad days and good days more balance than since then) Now it getting clear that market potential is near peak.Yesterday evening I was hearing one comment after another. Here is how funny they are1.> It's buy because look they can hardly break even while having years of growth, it's such difficult to make profit in streaming that other who just entering will learn and exit or fail. I have seen many analyst convert bad news as good news but this is beyond anything I seen in past..2.> While they might peaking growth, They finally don't need to tap market as they are in positive cash flow. It's more material then subscriber growth. Do they care it's $300B market cap company3.> This is great buy, When new service enter, people just add subscription, they dont cancel.4.> This is time they should raise subscription prices. They have signficant pricing power ( Netflix on other end running free week end trials in India)List go on. Sure they are best Streaming business out there next to Disney when you add content in picture.But it's great service that developing world can't afford and developed world have so much choices that they have to rotate.They have so many subscriber that They can't add even if Investor putting their own money to make it free for some in developing world."
Interesting thought!https://www.barrons.com/articles/the-other-faang-stocks-could-be-holding-netflix-down-1542382004
This may be good time to buy NFLX. I added
Surprised it’s up so much given the revenue and eps. I guess subscriber numbers are good enough to offset. Congrats to those who had the nerve to hold through earnings. Given the last couple of quarters it was risky
570 HERE WE COME ABOUT COVER SHORT POSITION 3000 SHARES
$NFLX Valuation is ABSURD....
The Citron #$%$ did the same thing with Roku dropping the stock over 10 points
"And here’s the sell off, yet again. Biggest regret of my life buying this before earnings"
This sell off is ridiculous
Reed Hasting will be the richest man on earth Wall Street will make sure of it.
See ya!!!
if we get to 650 then 700 is around corner and they should split 7-1. I don't believe this has ever split correct?
bubble has burst so aggressive sell off is over. Buy with confidence across the whole market.
"This stock is more fun to watch than AAPL. I expect a short rebound tomorrow...but again, who knows? Goodluck all"
tomorrow's call is going to be epic lol 2000% up?
Wow. Just wow. Knew this was good when it hung tough on down markets. Now it's just lit a fire.
It is not a trap it is a bubble that will come down hard.
"I am no longer going to watch CNBC, especially when there is market turmoil . They always make it worse."
Pedo stock. Profit takers tomorrow haha
I’m not a short and I want it to dip. I’m buying more at about 390. Setting up for another major move higher.
"If NFLX cannot make money in low-tax humming economy, how can it survive in bad economy?"
"Folks, who fuss about OBAMA, Reid, Pelosi, Clintons,etc having content on nflx etc, do you really think people are that politically motivated in their spending habits. Do u think they won't for example, not eat at a restaurant because it is ""run by Democrats"" or something like that?"
Very rich valuation
"If NFLX goes below $300.00Opportunity to Buy, Buy, Buy"
Bought 275 sold 302
"Going to be an interesting open tomorrow as some big named stocks are getting hit after hours. FB, you get treated with kid gloves. A Tale of Two Cities. 313 tomorrow for NFLX? Approaching the end of the week. Follow the bouncing CASINO ball."
Yep! Smashed numbers
Take profits till it lasts
NFLX please sustain this gain and dont give it up
will continue break new high
"Earnings 7/16 after close, expect to break above 419 shortly and exceed 423 ytd high. 428 goal."
277 then it can go higher.
guys. Any ideas? I should have sell it on 388 yesterday i guess. Hold or what?
"TO ALL SHORTIES, I DOUBLED MY NFLX PURCHASE. ANY QUESTION?"
180B market cap ??
The truth hurts. But it's the truth. $250 soon.
buy now or wait for a re entry point???? experts??
Hey guys dnt ever sell ur shares after reading this chat board...people who are saying nflx will down are either shorting it or are regretting not getting on the train early on.. it will go past 615 next week without any doubt. Dnt forget nflx is buying back their shares. Goddluck!
What's your price average on Netflix mines $296 anyone going to but Airbnb stock on Thursday?
$600 next
after hours will be interesting and determinade the future of the stock
"I think that Netflix's behavior implies that there are good financial reports on the way. Every sale brings a drop, but buyers immediately enter and raise the share price."
I'm out. Pretty much lost it all. you might as well sit on the sideline for now
Underestimating the size of the streaming market is the biggest mistake people make with Netflix.
Here it comes up up up don’t be scared and stay positive. We can do it 380.00
cramer would call nflx a buy once it reaches the moon. buy now at bargain
It pays to be patient go netflix
If you could afford an Apple iPhone that cost 1200 you can afford Netflix for the next 12 years at 14.99 a month. This should be 429.00 already. Now tomorrow 380.00
The chart looks good. It it breaks 370 then its going straight to 380$

Man.... Up too early...
I'm working an MOC after shorting. I expect that break into close. Profit taking into a large gap on chart. GL Yahoos
Chart is literally doing the exact same thing as yesterday if so looks like we should be hitting 564 ish
Netflix should ban Trump ahead of time.Twitter and Facebook going up !
Netflix expected to quit burning cash. Cash flow positive going forward.
"One of the few stocks that does well in good times and bad. In bad times, people look to save money which accelerates cord cutting (because of the price gauging by cable companies) and simply going with netflix."
Democratic landslide is happening on east coast. Make your vote count. Let your voice be heard no matter who you vote for.
Movement this morning is identical to how it was in the first 3 minutes of trading yesterday. We all know how that ended by the end of the day. Don't get too excited.
Guess what? If you don’t have a Netflix subscription then you won’t be able to see its original content. End of story.
Shorts
"NETFLIX CEO: ""WE ARE LOSING IN THE COMPETITION AGAINST DISNEY+"""
Honestly if I watch an hour or two of television a day it is on Netflix. I get to watch whatever I want when I want it is that simple. My kids go crazy if I turn on Direct TV Now because they don't get why there are only certain shows on at any given time. Netflix could double its rates tomorrow and I would still keep the subscription and I'm probably not the only one.
"Six days up in a row, top of bollinger band, time to short again"
"Been in NFLX stock for the long haul, excellent content coupled with mg'mt being mostly ahead of its various peers. I bought some AMC with some recent proceeds with talk that Netflix could have some interest in this beaten down theatre/entertainment Co. What better way to get your original films on BIG screen across the USA and promote all your other content."
"High volume this morning as NFLX is dumped. 1.4M shares sold in the first half-hour. Looks like a few large holders are rotating out to take advantage of the risk-on with the beaten down stocks. NFLX is clearly oversold, but it's not clear when the selling will be done, so lower prices may still be ahead of us today. Once the selling is over, it should climb back up steadily, if not rapidly, to the 450+ levels - the lock-down has lasted almost two months into Q2, and given the conservative guidance of NFLX management (they didn't have any idea on how to project Q2 subscriber adds), they almost certainly will have another big beat when they report in July. The anticipation of that beat should cause a significant run-up in advance of those July earnings. Not a bad time to load up, if you've got the stomach."
$1000 in three months or so:Long base of NFLX price consolidation means huge upside!
announce a stock split that will fix it :)
How about split 1:5?
Correction is over for FANG stocks. They are going to set new high very soon!!
"The robust earnings on April 16, in particular, surging international growth, should propel NFLX beyond 400. Look around you, and speak to your friends around the world, all seem to be addicted to NFLX original content. Hours of high quality streaming content, when and where you want it, commercial-free, and intelligently catered to your taste - coming at a price of watching a single flick - NFLX is a game changer. I predict consumers will ungrudgingly pay an extra buck or two for its service, adding hundreds of millions to the bottom line. Is competition increasing - sure, but we still have 200 million Americans still subscribing to network TV. I predict blue skies for NFLX, for the next earnings, and beyond."
Increased volatility into earnings. Exciting!
Sell now
"Brutal beating for NFLX longs over the last couple of trading sessions. Those who use Bollinger Bands will now see it's trading more than 3 standard deviations below the 20 day moving average, which almost never happens. I'd say we'll get a bounce here before the selling resumes, but the smart money will be shorting the bounce."
Don't do it...don't buy a single share. You've been warned.
Soon down to $20.00.
This stock kind of reminds me of netscape during the browser wars.... it's just a matter of time before the big guns get it together and grab the majority of market share. The win is that netflix would be a great acquisition for either apple or disney. IMHO
If market down on Monday that support will get blown out easy.
the Market looking good. DJ SP500 NASDAQ still green...
netflix signs rob reiner for new movie.
Shorted at 237
So if credit markets seize up where does that leave a company with negative cash flow and negative equity if you include off balance sheet obligations
I thought everybody sold this when they Learned the Company was controlled by the Obamas and Soros.
Impeccable timing. https://youtu.be/RPU_u3TWvbk

Hoping the green holds this time but...
Traders unwinding but will close up nicely.
We'll get a 4-10% pop very soon. It's been trying to break to the upside last couple sessions only to break down midday. Maybe Tesla and AAPL beating will bring forth such a pop in the coming days.
 bears
How you going to bring up Netflix to all time highs when it didn’t even hit earnings estimates
buy buy buy
I think it's going to turn green for good soon. They can't keep it down for long. Back to $375 by Friday.
"Anyone looking for new investment opportunity, look into FuboTV. Great growth opportunity and product. Do your own dd"
They wanna add emergency alerts to Netflix? Wow that is a sign that Netflix is becoming fully assimilated with American culture. Mic drop boom. We’re going to $800. Bulls win!
"this stock reminds me of amazon - the talking heads say that the valuation makes no sense, and they would never invest in it - but the stock continues to climb for years. I'm sorry I didn't invest when I saw the writing on the wall 8 years ago."
"Based on option 300 strike 12/13 expiration Calls open interest (6739) and big volume (10307) against Puts open interest (1928) and small volume (1686), tomorrow the stock should be hovering between 300 and 303."
sitting on house money now sold half when was up 136% a while back....... and it wont stop....
TRY and DO what you want shorters...but i guarantee you new 52 week high by 1 hour from now.
Not getting out
$562.00 & Higher !!!!
"I cut my position in 1/2 but still long. I am not understanding why this keeps rocketing when it has negative cash flow, and, as I understand it, no plan to become cash-flow positive in the near future. What am I missing?"
"Years ago I heard friends and relatives talk about the shows they were watching on Netflix. They were so enthusiastic and more importantly they were hooked on the content of the shows. I considered Netflix as an investment and I bought. Never did I think in my wildest dreams they would be so successful. I added to my position along the way by buying on the dips. I has worked well and now Netflix is my third largest holding. FYI: I took awhile but, I'm now a subscriber."
strong finish.700 by friday
Apple beats and NFLX barely moves. Hmmm. up .10% at the time of my post. So much for hoping Apple would help a lot.
board cashing in
A great way to end any day. Thumbs down.
"When old media come out with a steaming service they say won't compete with Netflix, or a service that reduces the time of a TV show or movie to 10 minutes, or a service that pays you to stream video you know the streaming wars are over and Netflix has won."

"Sure, the momentum has been strong, but this stock is so ripe for a pullback."
"It was a nice run from being a bag holder to making a profit and exiting too early! Was not sure what the fed was doing and thought it prudent to exit with a sort of decent profit! I admire you longs who held in there, especially with the nice pop AH! Go long, stay strong! Good luck!"
Good news leaking out. People want IN!
Shorts should have covered yesterday.. and where is the $300 they were talking about ? $450 EOW

close around 400 hopefully
Will it be below 300 Tuesday
380 coming.
"Looking for a $250 entry, when will it happen?"
my opinion. No installation. No receiver box. No special changer. No dish on top of my house. No contract. No 100$+ monthly bill. Most Emmies won because of good original content. Bottom line is they have successfully leveraged the Internet to deliver entertainment cheaper and evey day more people are signing up.
"If you are going to wait, why not pocket tax deferred cash and pre-pocket a profit"
$400 by mid day tomorrow
"Hulu reduced their monthly fee, should Netflix be scared? After all Hulu is competing from that space. We can also look at this from another angle, The only business that I saw reduce prices in th past are companies in desperation like block buster when they reduced their prices to compete with Netflix, Movie houses when they rolled out $10 a month unlimited movies and many more to list. Reducing prices on already established price point is a move from a position of weakness folks."
This will never be below $300 again. Ever.

"Another thing I found and I am sure market going to ignore.First time company also mention about Churn rate and how partnership great to reduce it. That also really bad news. This mean they have to keep finding replacement in order to keep growing. Partnership likely reason for recent growth but that also mean lower revenue per subscriber and Also when more player out there, they likely pushed further on margin."
"All of their content is available through the backdoor, aka Torrent."
"So Many bankruptcy comments here. I dont think Netflix is that bad. Overpriced, yes. All they have to do is change and modify their business case and they will be alright."
I'm buying 100 shares tomorrow morning
What a week! From a low of 310.82 to a high of 359.15.From 6 red days in a row to 4 of 5 n the green.Let's do that again next week!
Winners don’t come often when you are out there in the wild world of the markets. But all that can change if you join the right program. I joined up with these guys (http://Fairstox.com). Now I am having solid picks every week.
"Jeez, who bought this after hours on earnings day??? Much sympathy."
Why the sudden decline? Any news out making the stock tumble?
The future is more streaming.
I'm not worried about Netflix until Disney get their streaming act together. Until then it is a traders stock.
will break 400 next week. easily.
I would say it’s a safe argument to suggest there was massive insider trading going on last week with knowledge of the debt offering. I’m not blaming NFLX but have little doubt many involved in this issuance warned others. Criminal Wall Street at work.
Netflix on sale down more than $2. BUY! BUY! BUY!
Crossed $370 today - we have resistance -- we hope:)The next time you see a $50.00 drop - remember BUY BUY and smile
When is this going to 405 so i can unload..?
Shorts making things worse for themselves
I think Netflix has given my family the best deal ever. We are never going to cancel it and still use it all the time.
Maybe 400 today.
"Queens Gambit, Paranormal, The Crown S4. Content is king but distribution makes it happen. 200 million subscribers and 20% a year subscriber growth."
Charts pointing to 780 on this.
"Read an article today stating that the intrinsic value based on 10 year outlook is $290. That assumes 50% penetration worldwide in 10 years. To me, that seems like a lofty projection, and even with this expectation, the current intrinsic value is less than where it's trading today. No idea what to do with this one."
If you’re passing up this buying opportunity go get a job at McDonalds!
On Fiirrrreee
"Sell now and buy Roku, AAPL and DIS coming for this "
I feel like this is going to be a 45.00 run today. Buy buy buy. Apple don’t have anything on Netflix. THE KING IS BACK I LOVE NETFLIX
love Netflix but this growth is not sustainable. pullback soon before new highs
looks like they beat nicely...
"this ""crash"" was a blessing, I'm making a fortune today :D"
beginning multiple. sell days
Humm why up 12 after hour?
If you guys had to choose between roku or NFLX you’d choose?
quiet over here today....
"NFLX Share price showed some strength with higher volume on Tuesday vs other Tech stocks, and had some reasonable follow through yesterday.... If Disney results on subscriber numbers dissapoint then it maybe its time for NFLX to take another leg up ...There is a huge Gap on DIS chart going into earnings tonight ... if there's any dissapointment, these gaps quickly get filled... either way my guess is what is good for one will be bad for the other and visa versa ...GLTA ... I'm currently long NFLX here ..."
Does anyone know for sure if under the Historical Data tab in Yahoo Finance and the last column labeled as Volume for daily volume is expressed in Shares or Dollars?
Lets keep going NFLX dont give up those gains!!!! Yesss!!
I like netflix as a service and investor. But swing trading this thing I shorted it all the way up to 593. What people don't realize is it surged way too high and fast for the short term..... the potential buybacks are not for sure and won't be for a long while. They are also in a catch 22 with covid since the subscribers have surged due to covid but they are also running much behind on new content also due to covid = catch 22. I have already watched everything I can possibly find on there and I'm cancelling after the second price increase for the service taking place only a few months apart until they have a ton of the new anticipated releases which all have no actual dates on them. I think many will follow like myself and no way this price keep sup this high until it dips way lower. Though I do think it will come back up but maybe not until end of year.
Should be under $300 tomorrow and under $270 by Friday. Shorts pouring back in.

Bought some levered call options for 1000$ premarket; alrdy worth 1400$ now ;DLooks like was a smart move and we can go ahead to 700$ fast :)
"Markets are going to close very, very strong today. Looks to end at highs of the day and of course highs of the week, month, year, and decades!!!"
Just went trough the upcomming netflix programming. And alltough I won't watch half of it I'm amazed about the variation...
Netflix has to be undervalued. It continues to make new highs while the market has been in a correction for most of 2018.
I like Roku very much but seems like buying it @ $95 is like buying $NFLX @ $420... I'll just sit on the sidelines and wait.
It should be 380 this week can’t believe it’s still 360....SAD
tsla flying should of sold and put there but ...I love netflix
"Longs still strong, up 120%"
"When Disney takes away content from NFLX in 2019, NFLX memberships will go down. Pixar, Lucasfilms, Marvel, Disney shows and movies. Disney has the largest library for kids. Also Apple will start to make content. NFLX will have to raise price because of competition and debt. This going down"
$495 soon
I can’t figure out why this stock is so hated. With stay at home stocks doing well today and roku up another 6% you’d think this would at least be back over $500.
Everything has dropped the last 3 hours today. It's been a bad 2 weeks for almost everything. Why would you expect Netflix to NOT following the same downward trajectory. Almost every stock has now given back it's previous daily gain.
any single ladies with 1000 shares? need a guy with lots of love to give? looks not important?
Last time to sell and preserve your gain yesterday. This will be a round trip.
let's hope it won't drop below 540 before the bell
This will send the shorts running for the hills. Maybe we can use the interactive analytics to make sure they have a sad ending. Nah not necessary that will happen on it's own!https://www.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/netflix-birdbox-success-14824559?puc=yahoo&cm_ven=YAHOO&yptr=yahoo
It was a good run but the bubble has finally popped!
"Contemplating who said it best. The Bernstein analyst who said ""Buy Netflix because it can't be stopped"" or the guy from the Kominsky Method series at the Golden Globes who said ""Netflix Netflix Netflix Netflix""."
Seems like an awful lot of bulls in here going into earnings for a stock down $100 from its highs
The greatest stock comeback in history right here. Unshortable.

Why are people selling at these prices to take a loss. Hold on wait for higher prices new year will explode over asking you'll see
Nice upgrade today and great news on queen gambit. How much did we pop on the good news 
"Yusko: This is Exactly like 2000, 2001, Internet Bubble. Netflix Burned through 1.5 Billion in Cash in the quarter, Hardly can call that a Profit"
Wow what a miss
"continued growing revenue with massive saving on productions since no new content is produced due to lockdown. double, triple WIN"
Are subscribtions not growing as fast because they signed o bama? Would it crater to $5 if they signed Hillary?
Bernstein says Netflix should easily get to 90M US subscribers and John Malone says scale going from US to global is 10x which means Netflix should easily get to 900M subscribers.
Always the EPS misses.
"This is how it works folks. Cable companies used to charge from $100 to $300 for cable packages in the US and American consumers used to pay for that. Netflix change that game by charging $6.99. And now $13.99 a month. Consumer switch to Netflix in droves and dumped cable. Regardless if Disney came in or any other players there is room for more players in this field without cannibalizing from existing players like Netflix....remember consumer used to pay $100 for cable every month. So the argument that Disney coming in will compete with Netflix is false, they can Coexist together. The advantage of Netflix is the international market where right now they are first player and will capture the market like they did in America, Canada etc. This is why Netflix command the stock price that they did. How big is the world market....there are 3+ billion of middle class in the world who can afford Netflix subscription....Netflix currently only captured 130+ million of it.......Do the math"
This HOUSE OF CARDS is about to collapse
And the shorts are all crying
I bought more at 185. Hope the drop is done.
just I cover 100 more now 1500 short.
Shorts have been obliterated. Cash on the sidelines ready to buy any dip. Shorting NFLX is literally throwing away money.
Why is this still dropping?!
There is no reason the stock should recover. This should be down 15% (actually it should be down 80%) but I’ll humor the believers. Just opened up another short position
In the red all day
how someone will not buy this under 500?the whole world on quarantine sitting home watching Netflix while earnings report are on the way
"Nflx won one award last night on the Globes? I watched to see how lovely Halle berry would look, but got tired of all the political stuff and lectures from broads like Meryl Streep"
some d-bag keeps pushing the stock down the moment it gains life
"380, 390, 400 and so on don´t get trapped in bears"
Pre-market 307$
"Took my 40k in gains on my $397.5 , $400 and $405 Puts today and bought $5000 of calls expiring Friday for $390-400. Feel like it’ll rip back up very fast... if not, great week overall..."
Disney has reached over 10M subscriptions since yesterday. That's why the drop.
"remember today is a huge down day for tech, we would normally be up 3-4% if it wasn't for this correction"
$500 by year end?
my favourite stock and also the best in my portfolio
"we will break 425 this week, next week is 450!!"
CFO stepping down for a company like NFLX is usually good for a a 2-3% decline. Hanging in there pretty good.
GREEDY SHORTS GOING TO RIDE NFLX UP TO THE $500s
Green on steep red markets. Not bad.
"How come Netflix is down? Their earnings will be great due CV situation. Every family on the planet is now Netflix & chillin. Millions of kids watching Netflix becouse their school is closed. Companies like Tesla will loose, there is literally nobody buying Tesla car. Market is losing due panic, but after CV panic end forever there will be great earnings for Netflix and really bad for Tesla. I took them only as example. Don’t invest in stocks that will crash after their earnings.$TSLA$NFLX"
Whats tomorrow is this going up or down
All the NAYSAYERS on this great stock and yet it soars in the past few weeks. Everyone on CNBC was calling for the end of this successful company. They know NOTHING! Just look at what it has done. Anyone who bought way under $300 a share has made a fortune in a very short time. CONGRATS!
This price increase just confirms that this quarter was good. Why would nflx raise rates on a miss? To loose even more subscribers because lets face it there will be cheap ones who will btch about the $2 increase. I expect a 1 million sub loss due to increase but that will clear the path for future.
Last earnings report NFLX blew it out of the park. Anyone remembered what happened?
In the neighborhood of Disney’s market cap. Hilarious
target: 570 before ER; 700 in march
Will be in the RED AFTER HOURS... look at this drop! Wow!
Ok sold at 352. I'll wait and see what happens on Monday. I'll buy back in at 340 on the dip next week
Wait till the real selling begins tomorrow.
"There you have it , the world biggest media stock. Congrats to longs "
setting up for a nice start tomorrow!
Who would have thought that Netflix would lose subscribers aftter paying $$ millions to the Obama's with the following special documentaries coming out: 1) How to become President from only being a community organizer 2) How I learned to hate America and the military and love Fidel Castro 3) Just give socialism a chance 4) How to keep your present medical plan 5) How to double or triple the U.S. deficit 6) How to keep your present doctor 7) Why Michelle and I don't care about BLM (because we're filthy rich now and wouldn't live in Chicago if you paid millions more to us). These are just some of the upcoming special documentaries coming up on Netflix. Join up now to make sure can stream these fascinating insights into the Obama legacy.
We ditched NFLX in big numbers!Just check out your nextdoor Conversation
"Deustche Bank can’t make up its mind, this in April:“ •Deutsche Bank raises its rating for Netflix shares to buy from hold, predicting the company will generate strong international subscriber growth this year. •""Netflix has changed the industry in a profound way and in doing so has given itself a significant lead, making it very difficult for the traditional media companies, or even other big tech companies, to catch up,"" the firm says.”https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/13/netflix-shares-rise-after-deutsche-bank-upgrades-to-buy.html"
"Are you saying Netflix can make big profits from Disney production? Apparently, it won’t be for long."
"As I said earlier, $550.. we are there now....."
If you don’t bought today you will chase tomorrow
i feel bullish here....it may reach 550 soon
Buy buy buy
glad I bought nsome more yesterday
"Why Netflix could surprise to the upsideThere are number of reasons why Netflix could deliver better-than-expected results next Tuesday. The COVID-19 pandemic was a key driver of the surge in the first half of the year when it added 25.9 million subscribers. In October, when the company offered that guidance, the pandemic was much more controlled than it is today. In the U.S., daily new cases went from about 60,000 to more than 200,000 today, while new infections similarly spiked in Europe, prompting lockdowns in countries like France and the U.K., as well as incremental measures in parts of the U.S., like Southern California and New York.That rise in cases is likely to have driven similar growth in subscriptions the way the initial outbreak in the spring did.The company also said it would�raise prices�in the U.S. at the end of October from $12.99/month to $13.99/month on its most popular membership option. While that move was widely expected, it shows management's confidence in both its long-term growth trajectory and the performance in the fourth quarter. A 2019 price increase caused Netflix to report a slight decline in subscribers in the second quarter, but that was during a seasonally slow quarter. Also, it was a larger price hike, as prices went up by $2 then compared to just a $1 hike last year. It also proved to be a temporary speed bump as it returned to steady growth in the following quarter.Additionally, there's evidence of a streaming boom across the industry in the fourth quarter.�Disney�reported that it added 13 million subscribers in the two months leading up to the beginning of December, while streaming aggregator�Reelgood�noted ""massive growth across the board,"" though it did say Netflix's leading market share declined from 25% to 22% among Reelgood's 2 million users.Finally, Netflix rolled out another strong slate of content in Q4.�The Queen's Gambit�was a surprise hit globally, sparking a surge in chess interest around the world, and the company also seems to have scored victories with the first season of�Emily in Paris, which was already renewed for its second season, and Season 4 of�The Crown, one of its strongest franchises. Towards the end of the quarter on Dec. 25, the company also released the first season of�Bridgerton, Shonda Rhimes' first production for the service, which has also received critical acclaim.Data from Reelgood shows that five of the top 10 streaming movies in the fourth quarter were released on Netflix, including�The Haunting,�Hubie Halloween,�Mank,�The Trial of The Chicago 7, and#$%$ Elegy."
Perfect! Thanks guys!
"I would be interested in the subscribers added that are not part of the Sprint / T mobile merger. Anybody have those numbers, because the growth for next quarter is the issue if they are a result of Sprint."
...pretty amazing...50% in just a few weeks....I'm tempted to sell with the idea of buying it back at a better price. Stocks just don't move up this much without correcting...
remember the promise monitory mask first hundred days. shut down soon grab a blanket watch a movie.
hey where all the longs at?
A glimpse of Netflix's pricing power.Year/subscriber growth/revenue growth:2015/30%/23% 2016/26%/30%2017/24%/33%2018/26%/35%
"Sweet, just picked up more shares at 299!"
Can’t even close at 525 when the market up 300 plus points. Very disappointing move today.
"I really can't understand why this stock is falling. It has a large, expanding customer base. It is also consistently profitable and has surpassed the analyst's expectations on a quarterly basis. I am beginning to think I should just stay out of the market as there are forces going on here that I simply do not understand. My $100K investment here is now worth about $77K... Nice! I guess I can't roll with the big boys"
Price target raised to 475
We are looking at a decisively higher gain in subscribers during 3Q earnings announcement on 10/16! $450 here we come!!!
"Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha....Sad to say, but I think our overall market bear run is coming to it's finality. All good things must end eventually. Better bull days await when the bear runs its course."
Market waiting for Fed speech guys. Netflix will either go 255 or 275 today
"NETFLIX PROVE THE HATERS WRONG, RISE TO 400"
We watch friends and office because it’s on Netflix. Not gonna join other services only for these shows..but the dip
Should I hold my 550 strike 1/29 calls or sell them tomorrow?
What about this warrants a PE 10x higher than DIS? This company is so overvalued it would need to double earnings every year for several years to even start justifying this valuation.
THIS THE BEST TIME TO BUY 30 POINTS ON THE UP SIDE
see you at 290 this week
How does this go up 3% and then lose it all back the next day.
"haven't seen SonnyBlack around here in a while. I kind of miss his daily forecast of ""back to pre-covid level"" that he's being saying since April... perhaps he just gave up, covered his position and moved on"
Stock is going to crash after earnings!
Hold on it will rebound
"tomorrow a higher low and higher high, as we just put a inside day in today! Then watch to see if it takes off in next 3 candles"
BEATTTT
Can anyone explain why this is down after hours
"Folks the PE is still up around 170, down from around 250. It needs to fall by a factor of 10 for this to be fairly valued!"
What do you guys think about this new player $SEGI ?
$1000 target in 3 months//
"Netflix would be unbeatable if they acquired a broadband company. If you want people to completely cut the cord, offer Internet + Neflix outside of any cable or dish program. I would jump on that in a minute. I hate having to pay my cable provider for Internet just so I can use Netflix."
happy birthday Netflix. show us some love
short it... you might get lucky. but more likely you gonna lose money!
I took my profits from $185 at $385 in after hours and shorted. I'm covering NOW.
"If you guys are looking to put your money elsewhere, look out for Rapture Tech IPO. They have developed a prosthetic arm that has the crushing power of 1,000,000,000,000 lbs/sq inch. CEO name Gil Hanscomb$mnkd $hmny $arna $vrx"
of course you bulls are in charge
I just signed up for Hulu because my family finds it better than NFLX. I think people may be underestimating the competition
"Netflix Users Have Fewest Technical Problems of Any Streaming Service, Study Finds https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/netflix-technical-problems-study-hulu-disney-plus-amazon-1234614951/""With its high rates of content engagement and low technical problems, Netflix is the No. 1 service consumers said they would keep in response to the hypothetical question of which service they would pick if they could keep only one. About 54% of respondent said they would choose Netflix, followed by Amazon Prime Video (17%), Hulu (13%) and Disney Plus (4%), per the J.D. Power study."""
Here we go!
Has Netflix ever split ?
This will fall at least to 290 during the conference call.And settle down somewhere at 285.Netflix has run up too high too fast.Time for correction!
I think earnings will be good

435 is the next resistance.
"Dis is NOT good news for NFLX,Not good news at all!"
NFLX will be up over 400 in the after market.
If the market is up tmrw $20+ if not $10+ easily
Big buys are coming in now hold on to your seat people
Boom tomorrow 360.00 easy looking to go green all week
Everyone feeling better now. Have the calls for the public hanging of Mr. Left subsided.
"Wow, congrats longs"
maybe people here should be looking at VIAC.... their streaming is waking up... and they make more $ than Netflix.. it would be the perfect purchase for Netflix.
It will reach to 500$ each share so soon
"Short are covering today, by next week sell mode."
"People, if you are still short nflx, you should be really scared. When the Dows fell 400, and nflx is up 1.4% , it speaks volume."
If you guys think it's over priced now. Price is all relative to supply. NFLX leader again.
Look for an open around 400 LOL
HeyOn what platform can I trade this stock??
They popped it higher for option expiration then couldn't hold it. Resume the decline.
"Reed Hastings is smiling all day today, I wonder why ?"
It's just FOMO there will be plenty of profit taking tomorrow. It's near all time high. Literally no sellers after hours so they're all waiting until the opening bell when the spread is lower. 1000 share bids on the ask and 5 shares on the sell says it all. It will test VWAP then carry on tomorrow.
Many short-term longs will be shaken off when she dips below $520 today.
hello 200 hello 210
Right at the 50 day moving average now and the top of the bollinger bands. My guess is a pullback from here but will wait and see. May grab some puts today if this gets up to $285 or higher.
Close today. Break over 280 or below 276 today?
"Three reasons for today's move:1) An analyst who was negative raised the target to $270 and made NFLX a hold (primary reason)2) NFLX signed DIS creative director - they are spending 300MM more of other people's money (debt) to do this.3) Market moved up (very irrationally as inflation reared its ugly head)I added to my latest short position (already made $ on the last one) an hour before the close. It was clear that the bulls were trying to squeeze the shorts big time, but then a very big seller came in, and unloaded 1MM shares in the last 20 minutes. Why would someone do that? Because the wheels are coming off. NFLX has come back from its $233 low (not unexpected). There are many bulls, but they can't hold this tulip bulb up much longer. Enjoy your paper profits"
This was below $200 9 months ago...What makes you think it can't go back to that level again??
Push this over 295 by lunch and we hit 300 today
"Almost everything is in the RED, is it the Pompeo news?"
I am not kind of worry about my 342.5 put. Yesterday I can't avoid thought and so decide to buy just 1. glad it's just 1 not 10.
Sell when others buy. Buy when other sell. Take profit before losing it
Harry your right long term this is a great company but are you speaking to those who are in Netflix at $300 or higher? Come on man if you are in Netflix at $200 or better congrads and I would hold as well. $400 by the end of year yes possible but in the near term highly unlikely IMO.
...should pop even more tomorrow(?)
"I dont know how people can be so confidant that NFLX will give better guidance going forward, clearly there has been FOMO buying and the price has skyrocketed, then a price increase announcement 2 days before earnings report? this screams short if you ask me..."
"Guys GOOD NEWS! The Netflix selloff is officially over and price climb is on all cylinders on fire, they say it may go up $400+!!!"
"Have 700+ shares, a lil down but strongly believe in this. Standing firm like an oak tree!"
yes! I wait to 385 to short
Green by 4 cent . Hooray . Short sellers are not pleased . The guidance just a forecast . This record new subs I doubt they will unsubscribe and go to Disney or apple or amazon that quickly . Disney offer different products . Their Disney movies . Netflix is world wide . It’s a buy
"The sharks are circling, PE and P/B are screaming 2000, I give this market 3 months and all the fresh marks will go down like they did back then. just a matter of time."
Did it beat
going to 350 monday
DRIP DRIP DRIP
Again I’ll say it long and strong love Netflix
Don't worry peepsbig gains great shows no movie theater sDon't listen to haters. Booooooo Ya
Subscriber growth missed for second quarter in a row........stock will come down tomorrow!!
"Reed Hastings : ""fundamentals have never been stronger"""
VIX back to 14.5. Are we going to correct? VIX has not stayed up this high for this many days. If it goes back to 15 lookout.
And next week good news will be?
We are up to .04% in after market. Should be back to 420 by tomorrow
Guys After 2 hours we will start buy 40k share Just follow me This week up to 380$

"To all of you that said it would pull back today and suggested going short, so glad you were WRONG!"
The last time they hike price in 2011 and next quarter they lowered the guidance and stock dropped 10%
"“As we generate excess cash we will explore returning cash to shareholders through ongoing stock buybacks”. Terrific, but my shares aren’t for sale Netflix."
"Congrats to all longs who bought in December in the $230's. For anyone who bought in the $380's, my condolences."
$350 has become strong support now. Upside is unlimited. It’s an open-sky chart.
"I suspect that one day in the not too far future, Disney may make a movie about the rise and fall of the one trick pony Netflix. LOL"
The price of natiral gas will double by 2025
Shorts haha
Not alot of movement in the market today. where are the Big buyers?
I didn't realise that this stock goes down
Stock futures up big. NFLX to 530 by end of week!
"Sprint Subscribers were a huge part of the 4th quarter, so some analyst is going to ask them that question. Organic growth or just a one time rise?"
Wow...
Bought @ 343 AH. Very Happy as this will recover*
"I was thinking, with NFLX trading @ ~$335/share, why doesn't NFLX finance new content with equity instead of debt? Seems like a better long term financing strategy. At least at these valuations."
Gonna start seeing a runup to earnings
$AAPL should just buy $NFLX and $TSLA and call it a day
"Netflix's 'Bright' reached 11M viewers in its first three days, according to Nielsen"
fund managers will say anything to manipulate on this board. just stay long look at history before split and multiply ×7. splits make us forget previous movement. longs are fine.
This is going to break green today

There is no reason for this to be higher based on this.. if i owned it i would sell it on the hyoe. Read it all bad news save for one small metric..https://www.zerohedge.com/health/facebook-surges-despite-missing-total-subs-huge-guidance-miss
Goes to $400 soon
Maybe Disney is weighing on this otherwise today’s price action is hard to understand. Hopefully they have positives to say about streaming. Amazon is another one that is down over 1%. That one makes even less sense.
CIDM stock is a better streaming play right now!! they just aquired the indian version of NETFLIX and have annouced a new streaming app
"Today's action should be a warning and constant reminder to shorts that with nflx, they operate at a severe disadvantage and often are fuel for spikes higher. Even at $192, while there isn't a fundamental case that supports share price, there looks to be only 1 thing that can drive it lower; heavy, sustained selling."
feels like earnings never happened

Cannot wait for netflix movie about fed manipulating the stock market
"If Netflix want real growth they need to do something about the level of account sharing going on. My mom, dad, sister, brother and myself all share ONE netflix acct at 4 different houses."
"Most meaningless, unnecessary drop ever. The only FAANG which has no problems with it’s audience. Rock solid company, great technology, perfect numbers. 0 concerns and this is tumbles. WHY????"
"It will tell us a lot with how the market closes today. If we get a little bump up that is a good sign, but a bump down (what I expect) will be a pretty bad sign."
"WMT streaming, HPQ streaming, Dis streaming..NFLX growth rate in USA probably is over. Overseas, margin is even lower..I think NFLX will hit 100 in January..."
Seems like days before dot com 2000 crash
"What is that popping sound? The shortie's financial future. Eh, the world needs ditch-diggers, too."
Buy buy buy 330 is coming
Two pieces of good news today Analyst upgrade. Queens gambit setting record views. The result we are down to $480. I give up.
IBased on today and yesterday price action I can easily can see a 20% shave after q2
There is so much risk in this market which is now at all time highs
Dis will dominate this IMO!

100 day MA 341.34
The end. Apple smell blood in the water. More competitions ahead for Netflix.
finally breaking it
Trade war to accelerate market correction.....take your profits while you can. NFLX trading at irrational levels not seeing since 1999-2000 (P/E ratios at almost 300).
Doesn't anyone care that NFLX is selling at a P.E. of over 250? That certainly doesn't leave much margin of error. I hope people are only using play money for this.
"I do not post often, first of all. anyone posting Netflix is not a buy, has obviously shorted the stock. Netflix is a Buy, unless you woke up and thought the sky is falling."
Great buying opportunity. Optimism always prevails.
may up to 430
"Nasdaq down, NFLX down, Nasdaq up, NFLX down. Sells every early morning pop. Sells into the close. See a pattern?"
Institutional investors buying more NFLXhttps://newsfilter.io/articles/financial-counselors-inc-purchases-3103-shares-of-netflix-inc-nasdaqnflx-574adc33ecc24af4c5747126618401c1
375 by next week
"People look into past growth and think growth will just continue.Business like Subscription normally had sudden stop or even negative growth. I think Netflix is candidate in year or so. Netflix has bigger problem because it allow to share accounts and so very hard to tell how many unique household using it. Sure those free with Cable and T-Mobile going to help for time being.AOL is prime example where it taking millions of subscriber ever month and then suddenly go to pause. While Market value crash more to do hype it was into market, Subscriber pause and decline has nothing to do with Market, It's just it monetize most of subscriber.HBO is another example:- 2010 to 2014 it grown to 80M to 142M then suddenly drop next year. Since then its stable around 145M.I think Netflix is next. We just don't know when that going to hit but market cost raise concerning for sure. And those Cable offering free netflix going to delay that problem as well but it's trojan horse and they will use it when Netflix at worst position."
"one of the few stocks that had a great earnings and guidance, and has zero risk trade exposure."
"so let me get this right, a $2 price hike is too much for everyone to bear, lol . This service is the bargain of the year. It is the cost of a sandwich. All these competitors are so far behind and people love many of the shows on Netflix. This is only their 4th hike in their history. Eventually this had to happen, how else do you make money? Look what Amazon prime has done, way more hikes, way more expensive and nobody blinked yet. This model like COST AMZN, subscription is what's happeneing"
$325 is coming before lunch stat your buying. You should of bought yesterday it was your last chance to get it at a hell of a discount. It was a early trick or treat
My wife said once it gets to 400 you can have some of this LOL
Who bought a $480 call for Friday?
I’m not sensing the irrational exuberance on the stock this time around. I predict the price fades dramatically tomorrow
Do people think that Netflix has basically saturated its market and that we are going to see little growth over the next few years?
DID YOU NOTICE THE GREEN MACHINE BROUGHT IT UP 4 POINTS. THEY WILL BRING IT TO 420 SOON!
we see 320 again tomorrow.
Just covered my NFLX short at $339 after shorting it at $405...still think its going sub $300 but took the profit
Glad to see I was correct to add 100 shares at the open. Already up over $20/share. That was too easy. Like Buffett says. Hehe. :))
Going to test 350$ tomorrow for sure!
Any insights on the coming up earnings?
Netflix will break $400 by Friday!
I can't believe anyone would own this stock.......I hope they run a show with images of your granddaughter twerking
"I always get nervous for this stock as well as entire market when Jamie Dimon speaks as he is doing today. The guy is flat wrong over half the time, yet people cling to his words like he is some kind of oracle."
AND we still have another week before earnings!
"If you want to earn $30 per share by Tuesday, then you have the opportunity NOW."
Rest in pieces shorts....
After loosing earning this is up $40. Just imagine what would have happened if it had met the earning expectations.
Going to be a great day 360.00 closing GREEN
"After Thursday, on a positive earnings report that meets or exceeds expectations, expect $400.00+"
"So funny (again ! ) The typical...the subscriber numbers are awful, the burning of cash continues, so someone creates another false rumour so the ''pros'' can get out of the overbloaded stock and that the dumb money will be chasing '''the'' rumour....happens all the time, as a matter of fact, this company will most probably go into bankruptcy within 3 years....anyone that knows to read a balance sheet and knowing that there is no barrier to entry knows this."
Netflix is 10 years ahead in internet video distribution. There is nothing impeding them from reaching 1 billion subscribers.
One day soon you will wake up and see the price 100 points lower. Then you will ask What Papen? What Papen?. Then on another day soon after you will wake and see this down another 75 points. Then you will ask your mom What Papen What Papen?
Will come back stronger Monday and hit 600 next week. That options thing is over.
Thats gona be green in the end of the day lol
Patience pays!
I was thinking it will hold $345 end of the day today but went down with the market. As per chart it will touch 358 by the end of next week.
What you get for the price you pay for a Netflix subscription keeps hitting new all time industry highs after factoring inflation. 1 billion around the world pay for a TV service and eventually will have a Netflix subscription. Expect good news on subscriptions for many years to come.

What you guys think where Nflx would b by Friday
Here is one analyst history of price target.GBH:-1/17:- Raise from 235 to 2552/15:- Raise to 3153/8:- Raise to $375 5/17:- Raised again to $4006/18:- Raised to $500.First does yearly price target change so much???? 5 time in 5 month.So what common theme about this Analyst???? price reach with in $10-$15 of previous target. Can you believe this?I guess we should start 20 firm with different price target on stock we love and hot in market and put computer who keep announce price target increase when last price target reach with in $10.

We have volume. Now we need the break above 383.
"This comes down to a simple question. Did you wanna buy nflx at $400 or $340 and possibly lower. People these are opportunities to get in and they come around once a year if that, so take advantage."

I wrote two weeks ego and predicted NFLX $280.00. It is time to buy it.
Netflix has little competition which always comes from lower prices. Their main competitors cable TV are raising prices.

Search on google, ""pi network coin value"" and you will be able to see current unofficial quote.Before you skip the post thinking it's useless for you, check out where BitCoin is trading today. It's over $34,000 per coin. I am not saying that pi will be that successful, but what if it even reaches $100 per coin in the future? Even if you can mine 1000 coins by the mainnet launch the next year, those coins can be worth a significant amount of money.In any way, you NEVER have to pay anything to anyone to mine pi, it's open for anyone to mine on their phone as BitCoin was in earlier days. Just download the Pi network app on your phone, use invitation code ""celebration26"" when registering (it's by invitation only), and make sure to use your legal name as when they assign the coins to your wallet in the future, they will verify that if you are the person who you said you are.As far as my progress, I have mined so far about 10k coins which unofficially are worth about $10k and possibly can be worth much more when the mainnet is officially launched and the pi starts trading on crypto exchanges officially."

Goldman Sachs is angling for the lead underwriting role in the next capital raise by Netflix. Cash on the balance sheet will drop below $2 billion when NFLX reports on Jan 17. NFLX will need to raise more capital to fund another $3 billion in cash losses in 2019.

Netflix will return to $525.00 and then onwards to $550.00
I sold couple 340 call yesterday (I have order at 2.5 and gone out and find out later yesterday that it was executed).I think this is inflated stock and clearly used by manipulator. Yesterday move is proof. sudden 4% gain for no reason. I think eventually this will go very bad way as no fundamental justify such valuation.
Disney uses it's own contents. NFLX has to pay for contents. Disney can charge lower price for this reason

Morgan Stanley's Benjamin Swinburne.Swinburne upped his price target to $255 from $235 and maintained his overweight rating. He also raised his estimate for international subscribers additions in 2018 to 16.9 million. Even that may be conservative, Swinburne acknowledged."

"I left with 1600 short. Feel covering too fast (1100 so far , 700 at 393, 400 at 384) so stop for today."
I advise any long to book some profit today. Even after analyst pumping so much end of last week. It fail to hold 315+ that clearly mean big player selling before earning. This prove my theory that it's help that Analyst provide so Big player can exit with profit.Now slight only beat or slight miss can bring this stock to 250 easily. They have to beat big time in order to justify such inflated prices. Analyst and big player know that. There is very limited up side incase they beat big time but downside risk start even with slight beat.

I believe Nflx can easily increase their monthly rate to at least $20 a month. The cost to see 1 movie in the theaters like Mudbound far exceeds what one pays for Nflx service. In fact I pay $50 a month for Hbo and I get practically nothing.
Great volume. Keep this baby going to at least 5% increase at closing.

Piper Jaffray sees strong international subscriber growth this Q. Raises PT to 420 up from 367.
"As more online streaming available. It's no brainer People will use Online streaming and take internet from Cable or who ever provide.Reason is simple. Main advantage is on demand nature without worrying about DVR, Timing and many other thing. Only live stream, Cable make sense. (Cable likely go that route as Internet still yet to figure out pipe size issue but getting closer. Live streaming is reality but still behind by min or two compare to Cable).Subscriber also like to see all different content and use multiple streaming.Now biggest question is:- What keep those subscriber subscribe year round same service:-I find no reason to subscriber year round right now. Month or two more than enough to see all new content I like to see in 1 year.With Online, you can cancel anytime and subscribe again.Very soon people will figureout and stop keeping year round. This going cause limit on how many subscriber you can have.given how quickly $NFLX marketing budget going up per new Subscriber, this might happen already. Netflix able to find new subscriber to replace those and still able to show growth but coming at increasingly more cost. When Netflix realize it's not financially sustain it will stop spending more on marketing."

Trying to break through 2000 (without 7 to 1 split)
Netflix needs to spend massive money to ensure content rich programming. How will they ever be able to slow the content spending down to make a profit and pay down debt. I have no problem with a company spending big money to build out its infrastructure (Amazon) but where is the light at the end of the tunnel for this company? Are there really enough possible subscribers in the world to overcome this problem?
Who’s buying at these prices ?
I am holding on for $395. Willing to wait until year end if I have to. All we need is for the old NFLX to regain form.
Not much high not much lowSo institutions will sell firstThen fall
I really do not like holding a position in a company when earnings hit but I may just try a short position on Netflix. I think the numbers would have to be great to move the needle higher and I expect them to be no better than good and maybe a little negative .
"This past week I sold, fully knowing that NFLX is going up. Tuition is due for my child and I cashed in at $520. 33 months ago I jumped on board at $320. Not a bad profit, just ignore Sonny Black and wait or the next upward move.Frustration did set in with the endless liberal decisions by Netflix management. Signing the Obama's, Cuties and praising Kaepernick are just a few of the ideas that I desired to step away from.So long, sorry Sonny black isn't here to share my winnings with or he could carry home his share IN A BAG of course LOL."
Better sell at the open!!! Will slide all day

"Netflix is light years ahead of the competition in terms of producing contents not only for the US, but internationally as well.They have started getting good traction in the Indian market and can add a lot of subscribers there.I think Netflix is heading to 500 in a few years."
you can't honestly look at nflx with everything that is is facing and expect it to keep going up. i think that both longs and shorts can agree that nflx is a solid company. the question is multiple compression. it is normal for a company to retract 20-30% after such a huge run and particularly when its prospects are slowing slightly. Where would a -20% to -30% adjustment bring us? think about that.
"Feels like NFLX price action trying to grab some traction here, once it does we will see green."
At one time AOL metrics and market cap were eerily similar to NFLX.As subs started declining AOL went from 300 a share to 2$ in a matter of a year!Hilarious fact!
what is current multiple on NFLX??????????????????????
"Netflix will post good net gains on subscribers next week. There are a lot of scared, weak-minded people who have sold and that is a good thing. It only serves to fortify the fountain, which will be stronger as we get back on the tracks and full steam ahead to new highs!"
"congrats to all shorts, it just broke to a new low below $328. $290 is the next stop."
"How does it feel, shorties?"
27 million shorts to cover tomorrow. Look for $340-$345
Options action suggests a 8% move...up or down. That’s about a $30 move.
Solid management and execution
I open a Fortune cookie and it said Netflix $500.00 soon
The prodigious market cap is making me believe the stock market as a whole currently has a specious valuation
Chainlink price hits new all-time high target at $23.7 and aims for $30
If it could not go positive when market zoomed up for 30 minutes????? expect it under 260 this week
"Even though I sold at $338.23, I think this will run more, just not today. I expect a retrenchment to around $335 very soon and will buy back if/when it hits $332. This is a strong long term play. Concerns about negative cash flow are crazy. Worried about a couple billion negative CF when the market cap zooms $14B in one day and is up $63B so far this year! Hats off to anyone who put a lot into this at year end. Quite a ride."
"I have owned netflix for quite a while, and it has been the biggest DUD in my portfolio. Ive sold others that had a great run, and take profits, and kept others that are growing nicely. But this one: neither. Ugh..."
"An early Christmas gift in November, give thanks to that, cheers!!!"
No Bama...!!!! Is what the market is saying.
The markets used to drive me crazy with losses. I almost left the trading game for good until a friend shared a little secret with me. He gets his best picks (one a week) from (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Join them.
Like I said 400 + SOON
This is absurd. Stock price was higher than this weeks prior to earnings.
"They are on fast track going from licensing content to producing their own which has high upfront costs and returns coming only 1 to 2 years later. So how can they still keep a 25% subscriber growth rate!?? They must be saving a ton producing their own content. This company is in a sweet spot. When they reach the production/ licensing balance they're looking for higher cash flows will kick in, subscriber growth rate will be at a high, and profits will soar. 500 by years end and 1000 in 3 to 5 years."
"deep recession maybe a depression coming why national debtinterest is $600B or doGDP is $30 trillionincome off GDP , ntations income is $3 trillion$600B / 3000 B = 20 percenttwenty percent of the countries income goes to the national debt and the total debt goes up up upthey don't even talk about it, let deal with it"

"NFLX WILL DROP BIG BY THE END OF DAY. Quiet selling going on, high volume is telling it, but No ""anals"" want to discusing about it.NFLX is falling today because comcast just conform that they are dropping bidding for Fox asset. https://finance.yahoo.com/m/ac951e65-52bf-39be-a7b9-c2f642c5035d/%5B%24%24%5D-comcast-drops-bid-for.html"
I praying for a 10-1 split go Netflix
To 380$ Are you ready guys?
Back to $310 where it was last Monday. No big deal.
business will be as usual folks
bought 20k @$350
How come this sheet is barely green while market is up big and most tech stocks are up.
Netflix is a real deal after Theater purchase ideas and Comcast partnering. This is going $400 PPS; This will burn shorts badly.
Time to short...?
Some say Overpriced---I say we are looking at a 300 billion market cap in only 18 months.
Going bullish due to international expansion which Netflix virtually has no meaningful competition
When Cramer takes out netflix from FAANG expect a 5% instant drop.

"After conquering the emmy's, Netflix has its sights on the Oscarshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-G1BME8FKw"
"Dis+ just announced $1/month increase, effective around March. Expect nflx to continue the trend with more monthly increases on top of the recent one."
Upgrades before earnings are scary as always
Disney will now have the opportunity to pull all of the content that belong to Fox from Netflix in addition to its own content
here we go!
Stay clear of netflix until it settles down. Some more downside seems to be coming up.
325 today?
"Here is another aspect to look at NFLX subscriber raise.If you compare NFLX is favorite among teenagers/young people. Which other app has similar user group. SnapChat.SnapChat quickly raise their subscriber (Faster than any other Social Media) but now hardly have any growth. Reason unlike Adult/Old who take time to use new things, Teneger /Young people will immediately jump on trend.In other word, Netflix might growth 200M very quickly but I think it will have very very hard time to grow beyond that. There are lot of challenges.And any one think they can raise price to justify valuation. Look how cautious they are with small price increase. They yet to realize raise after 3 month for most of subscriber. They will only realize after next 3 month. This mean price increase is not easy."
"Overall good earning but I am not impressed with Earning. While It's nice they beating subscriber number, it come at much higher cost. Balance sheet isn't in great shape.Here is thing I like.1.> Subscriber grow by another 7.2M while I like, everyone expected this.2.> revenue per Subscriber raise little bit.Thing I don't like1.> Marketing cost raising much faster nearly 71% year over year. Even higher than Q4 last year. 2.> Revenue per subscriber raise is lower when you compare history and recent price hike. Without hike it was going 1.5%-2% up as people subscriber higher quality plans. With Raise last Quarter with most not raised until near end of year, it's up only 4.8%.3.> Content spend is getting crazy. I think If they hit unexpected peak for subscriber, Those content cost very hard to pay for. I think level of sharing is unknown but if it's higher than 50%, I think it might even paused early next year. 4.> With Disney and Apple going to enter, Risk of subscriber growth stall is even higher."
Is TechStrategy still around ? He was shorting since 2011.
Should I short or buy?

"apple could set up a NFLX streaming company in one day, using one good technicianwhat is it? a server, a good server, parallel servers?duhwhy would Apple buy what they can build with their eyes closedthey have the financial interfaces already"
"Article today someplace (appears authentic but frivolous, not bothering with the link) stating traders are positioning ahead of earnings for the inevitable decline after earnings. I'm counter positioned with short term calls and shares. After 3 quarters of misses, time for a beat."
"Guys, i need your honest opinion. WHY would you choose NFLX at this current market with super high P/E ratio?"
There is no reason for this to happen. If I had more money I would have bought more. Can someone tell me if they will cancel their NFLX submission if it is increased a buck or two?
This is worth a quarter trillion dollars about as much as my house is!
terribly low volume
Let's be real if you are going to post about the price movements. There is only a 3% short interest with about a day to cover on a heavy volume day. That means they are essentially irrelevant regarding price movement. That means if the stock goes down it is because bulls are not buying at whatever level.
"If after earning this go 400+ I will start shorting again for sure. Today I sold 345 calls expiring today just for premium. I am 99% certain it not going there just based on bogus analyst reports. Entire 2018 all they done is inflate and result their master make huge amount of money manipulating stock price based on report and retail who jump after seeing excitement, most lost lot of money. They going to keep repeating until retail get smarter and they can't benefit. I think this time retail going to smarter than last year and not going to get trap on every raising price promise."
"If raising subscription prices was a panacea, then all companies would do it. The impact of Netflix price hike is not only in the short term when people call to cancel their subscription (that number is likely low) but mostly long term: when new consumers are faced with choices, they will always go for the lowest priced, even if it's by a couple of bucks per month, as they view it a commodity.Also NFLX sounded the alarm on rising costs which bodes ill. In short, yesterday's pop was pure momentum, it should have been a negative."
Up 12 dollars pre market!! Happy hunting today fellow longs. A moment of silence for shorts please..
picked up more shares today to cover my first buy ins at 295. Funny to me how people think all streaming services cant do well with each other. I believe netflix will be just fine!!!!

Days high. $580 coming soon.
Sometimes you got to be a BO$$ aka Netflix
"The most logical reason I’ve seen for this fall $DIS has taken today is that the AT&T ER is also bringing down $DIS. That makes some sense seeing that $DIS, $T, and $NFLX are all down substantially. Having said that... what does Time Warner do in the realm of streaming?Besides that, if this down move in $DIS is due to $T, I can’t imagine $DIS not snapping back. People have to see the difference there... but... anything is possible... we’ll just have to see..."
"Goal, holding NFLX now till it's over $400.00."

At an avg growth of 30% a yr over the next 10 yrs revenue will reach 186B a yr. With 100B a yr in profit Netflix will be worth 2 trillion."

The only one green stock out of 47 yahoo watch list is NFLX
"When it comes to Netflix and Disney, Disney has 5 times the revenue, 6 Tims the profit, but a lower market-cap. Think about that for a minute. If Netflix manages to continue beating estimates it will still take years to live up to it's ridiculous valuation. Even then there would have to be an absence of competition and a strong bull market just to keep this share price flat."

As stated. You need an iron gut to hold a lot of shares in this stock. The moves are TREMENDOUS...both ways.
who would've ever thunk that $325 would be a buy price.
The shorts are missing the main Reason for the run.It is their pricing power.They can bump up their Revenue by raising their monthly fee by 25-50 % without losing any sub .It's the cheapest form of entertainment out there.Costco and Amazon are in the same boat.
Shorts gonna have a bad day tomorrow

I can assume this Ganlin spammer is a short. Surprised he’s still allowed to post
"NFLX is still undervalued. Could go to $1000 this year, and $5000 next year."
This is exactly why I never could justify buying netflix. Anyone can copy what they are doing. I knew it was just a matter if time before the bottom fell out.
Keep your arms and legs inside until the ride comes to a complete stop......
I'm sure by the end of the year it will be 500 I'm not worried.
I remember somebody on this board saying the price would retest the 240s hit last week. I should’ve listened to that guy.
was hoping for a retracement but flew away..

Way overpriced stock. The fall will be hard on this stock.
"Well, the 370 mark has been broken.For the 1st time in 8 tries, it closed over 370 when the open was over 370. Could not close over 380, but close. Best close since the day after earning, July 17, 379.48.... Next few weeks should be interesting. Does it go back to 400 or down to 350?"
DJ dropped -209 points in 30 minutes after opening. It will probably -400 point at closing today
long term short on this stock. too much competition and the content is slipping.
Turned green but then quickly reversed course. This has no support at all. I can't believe this is the invincible NFLX. Literally the most powerful stock of the last 5 years. Dying right here. Even AH is down. Maybe this is truly the end and we head all the way down below $300? If this remains weak next week I'm out and will go short. Good luck to anyone trying to trade this. It had a furious rebound from the big drop Tuesday but then has turned around and just faded down 20+ points. Too much pain..
450 by Friday
$350 Friday. Guaranteed
"By history and quarterly trends, NFLX has always increased stock price after a good earning. Believe me!"

So many free sights you don't need Netfux.
Could be wrong but it seems the after hours selling based on Apple was overdone. Afterhours usually is not indicative of much. This was up $40+ after hours on earnings day. Ended up...what...$12?

I honestly wouldn’t be surprised if this hit $600 mid morning
Would be nice to see hedge funds reallocating from apple to NFLX a few billion can go long way for netflix.

"How about the sales $ per domestic subscriber metric? Looks hinky, jumps to $33.03 per domestic subscriber, last quarter was $30.87, before that $30.13. How about that cost per domestic subscriber, down to $16.24, last quarter $16.53, more hinkiness. And now CONTENT; $2,986M spent in the quarter but content costs only increased $35M. At that rate it would take 85 quarters or 21 years to amortize."

"Arora Report showing ""Positive Momentum"" & ""Positive Squeeze"" rankings. Next week should be good. GLTA"
"You can’t talk about the entertainment industry without bringing up streaming service Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX).Historically NFLX stock has been an expensive play, but a worthwhile investment because the firm’s position at the top of the streaming space looked very solid. However, recently Netflix has seen a major pullback as investors started to worry about rising competition.In just two months, NFLX stock has seen its share price fall nearly 20% after the company’s second-quarter results underwhelmed the market. To be sure, Netflix isn’t flying as high as it once was, but the firm’s commitment to creating quality content is likely to keep the service from succumbing to the increasing competition in the streaming space. Plus, although NFLX is nearing saturation in the U.S., the firm still has a huge growth opportunity in India, where its content has been well-received so far. So, while the Q2 results were admittedly disappointing, this pullback in NFLX stock makes for a buying opportunity."
Best stock in the market!
2:30pm is what look for.

Average volume is 8.48million. Today volume was 12.33million. It tells me the banks sold long shares. Retail investors don't have this kind of high volume.
Today Netflix will be above 564$ probably 580$ or even more. Lots of good news. It is considered a safe play after it beat the estimates.
This closes tomorrow at $375 or over...too many buyers on the sidelines waiting to get in.

"Lot of people here betting we will have 8m/9m or even 10m new subscriber. They miss very important thing one of bull analyst point out. He use it as bull case that still market can bigger. I am using as bear case. I think stock will go down if around or below 6M (Meet or slight miss/beat company projection). Many think growth only go hyper based on history but problem is it already 119M. Some analyst even point out that only 600M in world (X china) have broadband and So that is 20% of overall world market share. If you add account sharing (50% likely) that's 30% of entire world. I think growth will slow regardless of Disney and Apple streaming success. If they are very successful, We may have negative growth even.Growth get harder as it go higher. Sure Recent T-Mobile and cable provider free with order reduced sharing and bring some growth in USA and rest of world market , could be reason for 4Q beat and even 1Q. (I call it trojan horse because once subs custom for free Netflix, When they discontinue result going to be mix of discontinue netflix v/s service who provide free netflix. They will use weapon at worst time then Other have more hit than netflix.)"
"$600 coming, hold on to your seatbelt"
Zolly what are your price targets
"NFLX isnt just gunna go straight up, need a really solid SWING trading system that locks in points, going both long&short"
"Reed selling more shares, I shorted more at 255"
"Futures are way up, so much for predictions of WW3 and a big drop in the market, Nflx will open up +10 tomorrow and climb from there. Congratulations to all you Longs that bought on Friday!!"
I am unsubscribing now.
Fake rumor on China tariffs from WSJ to pump the market ahead of horrific news from NFLX earnings release to provide a cushion for the market before the drop. That's how the game works now. Please trade accordingly.
Headed to $140 Billion Market Cap.
Stock will rebound soon. Keep holding. It happened before with Amazon and Google. Fundamentally speaking the company stands on solid ground and the game now is waiting time
I wish I had more money to buy more more more Netflix. This is going to explode $360.00 today easy
7 points in 30 minutes not bad if you bought at 343
Up 25% in last ten trading days.
nice solid consolidation before breakout next week
we will continue to see lower highs and lower lows until earnings...
Just picked up 900 shares at 283 and will be dumping soon. Easy money. Thank you
NFLX will reach $ 360 by the close today!!!!
Sell it folks
no one is safe anymore
Based on 5 year earnings estimates Netflix and Disney PE are around the same. Netflix earnings growth is around 50% while Disney earning growth is flat. If the trend continues Netflix is extremely cheap compared to Disney based on earnings 10 years out.
50 first support
$433 tomarrow . yes
Just got a message from NFLX my monthly charge now is $17.95 by january 5th.. Not smart doing that when the us economy is imploding..
The market makers added the 1/22/21 option chain today. NFLX earnings will be that week. Looking for that earnings pullback then diving in.
"So the squid is in on the debt offering, what a surprise. How long would an analyst last at the squid if they didn't have a high price target a buy recommendation?"
I just sold. Out until tomorrow. Not enough in the numbers. good luck longs.
"once it breaks $340, $280 is the next stop and a good price for loading up."
"Vs gets you facts straight. per CNBC “Sheridan still raised his price target to $425 from $375 for Netflix shares, representing 2 percent upside to Wednesday’s close”."
Disney is 2 months from pulling content from NFLX. Walmart will take a chunk of subscribers of middle and lower incomes from NFLX when service is announced. The hot air balloon  is about to pop!
Could an educated intelligent long tell me why this is up and how it deserves the valuation the market is giving it?
"Small portion in @$398.45, too boring if just watching"
"NBC Universal, which owns the rights to The Office, is pulling the popular sitcom from Netflix in favor of its own SVOD service, Peacock, due to launch next year. AT&T (T) - Get Report WarnerMedia-owned Friends is also leaving Netflix soon, and will instead run on HBO Max. Both programs will disappear from Netflix at the end of next year."
"@zoe India is a poor country? Yes but not for all. India has the richest people in the world. Also a great deal of India's population is moving upwards to what they would consider middle class.I know, I've been to India many times.They love movies, TV and their cell phones."
This is like watching a volcano to irrupt it keeps going down and it’s getting ready to explode
this was what I felt and stated before market open today: investment banks co-plot to upgrade stocks so as to push DOW up and break through 24000 points.
WOW Subscribers must be falling because everyone in Turkey can't pay for Netflix subscription.
NFLX hold up strong let's go NFLX
Just wait until Reed opens NetflixWorld
This is going to split
"I will continue to say this is a dead cat bounce. Some funds are caught with the surprise and even though NFLX had quarters like this, it is different this time. A few years ago the cable guys and network were asleep at the wheel and there was no AMZN, HULU and APPL. The competition is definitely different this round and the results in the past quarter are reflective of this. People are lured to other providers besides NFLX. They may have some original content but others can also put money on creating something even better. As for international subscribers in Asia, there are not many paying customers as people are used to free content and there are lots of those TV top boxes now that are floating around. No one is willing to pay for content there. And China will be a big joke. Just wait til trade war extends to content and the Chinese will ban all partnerships to show content that they define as immorale western values."
"FANG have one thing in common, they are the fastest growing large cap companies. That’s why Jim Cramer chose them when he created FANG. Netflix is the fastest growing FANG and its stock has outperformed the others over the years, yet it is the only FANG that hasn’t made a new all time high this year. Look for Netflix to zoom past 423 its all time sooner than later, on its way to 500 this year."
Now is the time to buy people!
This has been the most rewarding turnaround I've experience this year. Up $40 in a couple hours. Go go go NFLX and thank you!
"Although I don't like to see red at closing for the last few days, I am, however not concerning at this moment. Like all Fangs, I know it will rebound sooner than later. High PE or not, I am holding long."
Nothing that a strong slate of content can't fix. Netflix waiting for people to get back from vacation to put out it's best content. We could see a 10 million subscriber add Q before years end.
Why the drop?????
Fun facts - number of movie tickets sold in India is 2x the number of movie tickets sold in US. The total box office revenue in Asia Pacific is 1.5x the box office revenue in US & Canada. Those markets are huge and streaming services are in nascent stages. Huge upside potential for NFLX if they play their cards right. They do have one advantage - they are a leader in US and investments they make in creating international content helps them grow internationally and helps strengthen their base in US even further.
"NFLX shorts didn’t get all they asked for this quarter, but they got all they deserved."
another price hike already gonna lose tens of millions of subs
"When this stock move into positive even when market was going down, I thought to cover my short and only short around 280+. I think I need to start writing and using robo algorithms. Without it I have too much emotions to deal with."
349 tomorrow
I love Netflix never had a problem with them.
"Shorts are active again. Love that sooo much. Means they get scared and know what is going to happen, Buy back with a big loss."
"dont you think beating estimate Q4 already baked into NFLX stock price already? Since some brokerage firms are sure NFLX will beat the number, and gap up 20-30 pts, then what?"
"Raymond James' Justin Patterson upgraded the stock to strong buy from outperform. He also hiked his price target on Netflix to $450 per share from $435, implying a 38 percent surge from Thursday's close."
This is what you get if you buy tulips
"All I hear is about content,..well with the new players in the bidding pool content cost may go up...Apple and Disney have the cash to buy the best programs out there...leaving Netflix the crumbs..unless they go deeper in debt...IMO"
Netflix never misses two quarters in a row. Congrats longs!
The stock ran ahead of growth. Now growth has caught up and the stock is getting ready to run ahead again.
NFLX may hit $285 this Friday....Don't short NFLX before its momentum stops. It can move much higher...I have been seen this thing happened tons of times before:
"I'm not short or long NFLX, I really just want to know how a company that does $100-150MM/quarter can be valued at $110billion..."
India number 2 million new subscribers to date
Netflix announced Integration with VR chip brain implants that can stream directly to your consciousness.
"NBA season canceled!! Once it’s officially announced, $450!!!"
green soon
"Is it harder to do technical analysis when stocks are manipulated? Maybe not. I think the prejudice of looking at the fundamentals clouds ones vision at times, though.Technically, I'm undecided. Fundamentally, it seems obvious from the PE comparisons with the competition that NFLX is extremely overpriced. Will it go up before it goes down? It could. The 15 minute chart turned down and dropped 4 points. AAPL PE 21Disney PE 16.8AMZN 78.57NFLX PE 91.27 as posted on yahoo Finance; is it correct?All the new competition. The higher content costs (30% in one year according to the CFO).Time for a normalization of the PE'sYou wouldn't think they would have Amazon beat, would you?78.57/91.27 * 284.35 at the moment => $244.56compared to Disney17/91 * 284.3 => $53 per sharehow can they have Apple beat21/91 * 284.25 = $65.56 per sharesomething is wrongtime for a normalization of the pe's"
Nice to finish Friday in an up note. On to next week. Let’s get $370.
I'm using my ( SOLD & SHORTED @ $380 )Profits to go Long on NIO. The Chinese Tesla
On the news after hours yesterday NFLX was down 3 points. After the day traders were done and the news analyzed this WINNER soars nearly 20 points into today's action. This stock's share appreciation is far from over.
Needham sell NFLX and buy ROKU
what hapened? why the big drop?
When you see NFLX profits
It’s up 2$ after hrs
NFLX always recovers and goes to new highs. Billions of Indians and Chinese still need to sign up for their service! Their growth story is just getting started. I bought at $420 but I’m not worried - am in for the long term.
what we looking at for an open tomorrow?
Get in now why red... this will be green eod and fly 5% by eod tomorrow
How do you buy after close?
Good riddance to one-term grifter Donnie!

"find me a better company than netflix. no don't waste your time, watch a movie online instead. staying long."
did you know before the July 2015 split netflix lost 140 points a few months before. made a fast recovery though. 25 points x7 before spit is 140. no one really analyzes charts they just panic sell. longs are good!
that was an absolute gift
REMEMBER AMOUNT OF SHORT IN THIS STOCK ALSO
One way or the other this company is a pioneer with no actual competition at the moment.Netflix set the new rules to everyone in Hollywood and the whole movie/series industry worldwide. 500 by year end.Good luck longs
Wow.. good thing i only own 10 shares
loaded tesla
$1000 a subscriber - I remember Cable Stocks trading at $3-4K a sub in the 90’s and Netflix has the world - vs just the US for CableCo - oh and Cable Companies back then lost money too !
After lunch going up closing green.
"3 More weeks untill next earnings. Very curious what it will be, can't wait."
got in at 415 last month im going to hold i think it will be at 500 by q3 earnings
Like Amazon but movies. Cinema dead.
Netflix cannot continue to lose billions each year while claiming to have wonderful content. When are they required to writedown the value of all the cancelled series and movies that no one viewed?
COVERED CALL LADY - BOT 100 SHARES at 305 + change. Sold call expires Fri. Got in 1400 + change right into my account. Love it! Don'care if it goes up or down - that's the nature of momentum stocks. Take money when u can
"This reminds me of the early days of $NFLX.Yes I got into $NFLX, after it’s IPO.While reflecting back I got in at $8 per share- about a 10point drop, after its IPO.It’s EPS we’re still in the RED, but it’s CHURN RATE (money a Co. spends to attract new customers) was going lower and it was expanding and everyone in Boston was talking about its convenience.By the next QTRLY EPS, and following QTR EPS, -trading up and sideways - it kept revealing lower QTRLY EPS losses, lowered Churn rate, increased sales, and Quarterly EPS, improved and well once $NFLX, began to receive more and more upgrades and beat Analysts EPS, it shot up and up.Unfortunately, My broker had put a sell order in to sell 1/2 my position at $125. My shares were sold and within a week or 2 it was nearly $200+ and announced a split and again skyrocketed. My remaining shares were sold at $201."
"The ratio of the Dow over NFLX increased today, back over 60 on a closing-price basis. This means that relative to the DOW, NFLX got weaker."
Headed to 400.0 after the earning report
Told the shorts earlier this week to cover after the $327 close. Tech analysis is a beautiful thing. Read a book shorties.
A lot of people's are unemployed and stock market is climbing. The bubble is forming for real estate when unemployed peoples can't pay mortgages
"Obama jinxed NFLX earnings, just like he did for the country for 8 years."
Two things I know about the short game:1) you have to absolutely unequivocally believe in what you are doing and stick with it2) have the resources to weather the storm.I’m short this stock and I’m going nowhere
"A nice little after hours recovery, I hope this is indicative of things to come leading up to the earnings call."
Thanks for playing option buyers. No movement at all this week. Maybe next week after earnings. Of course everyone's expecting a huge swing but I wouldn't be surprised if it only moved 4 to 5%.
"Get ready for a powerful rebound rally which could take NFLX to new highs within days! The subscriber miss was a little blip, that is all"
https://variety.com/2020/digital/asia/netflix-india-projects-anil-kapoor-anurag-kashyap-1203469057/
"With competition so high, how come analysts still think the subscriber numbers gonna stay the same. The will go down for sure. There’s not point in this stock going high. Longs gonna get burnt soon"
80% of put contracts have been filled at 297. We see reversal shortly after that.-Rainbow financial services.
If Netflix adds an avg of 5m new subscribers the next 20 quarters (low estimate)....thats another 100m subscribers....no brainer. Z
"Bubble os busting. With the financial condition is tightening, companies that rely on debt like Netflix wi have difficulty to raise cash. If they increase subscription fee, then reduce the user growth. It's a difficult time ahead."
Wait until lunch more big buying. Banks are loading up heavy
"The vaccine is the light at the end of the tunnel for most companies, but an oncoming train for NFLX. I don’t know where the stock price will go in the next couple months, but longer term it is headed down. NFLX buyers/holders just naively celebrating with the rest of market...for now."
Cramer said buy NFLX last night.
"Get ready for profit taking the next two days, down we go, testing $300 level."
"Trevor Milton, is now appearing on Kobra Kia!"
"Netflix down because subscriber growth has stalled and now they are reverting to raising prices. Disney+ will offer competition to their raising of their prices, and stall out Netflix's international growth opportunities.NFLX $350 Feb 2021"

You hire Susan Rice and Obama and look what happens.
"SO nice to have jumped in NFLX, FB and AMZN last week.... Seeing $$$$$$$$$$"
370 let's go!!
Look at Bitcoin
Netflix valuation is elusive. For example: after reporting q4 2016 earnings the stock gapped up to 140. It was only 87 five months earlier. At PE 325 people were saying it was extremely overvalued. 140 looks very cheap now at PE 34 on this years est earnings and PE 22 on next years est earnings and the company still growing faster than ever. In a few years 350 will look very cheap.
And just bought 10 more $520 call options for tomorrow dirt cheap! bam!
Buy below $500.00
"The analysts will say ""BUY"".... In truth they are shorting the stock. Notice they talk a lot about their options plays."
"Of the 12 most popular TV series released in 2017 and 2018 Netflix has 9, HBO has 1, Hulu has 1, and FX has 1. That pretty well says it all."
anyone know what is really going on with Nflx lately?
"Takin out the stops above and below, $502, after 12:50."
"On a percentage to price basis, with AMZN causing most of the grief today, this thing is down only 2% less than AMZN."
Let me see now....cash flow losses in 2019 go to $3.5 billion from $3.0 billion previously. US subscriber guidance of 0.3 million net additions in Q2 is way below consensus. It would appear US subscriber growth has reached a plateau and is about to flatline due to the churn from the massive price hike. US subscriber base may actually decline by 4Q when Disney+ launches. Netflix has no growth remaining in the US.
Will Netflix lose gains today? That would be predictable. I want a surprise! Another 3 % gain today please...
Can we go 4 in row?
"American TV shows do not dominate the TV screens of Asia so why should NFLX be any different especially since the majority of their offerings are of questionable quality. Be realistic about the growth prospects of NFLX and realize that it is still way toooo overpriced at USD 120 billion. When the market realizes NFLX's income and revenue cannot keep up with the debt, much more pain will come."
I just took out a second mortgage to BUY MORE!
real Netflix up 4.3 percent
How do you Buy a short position. I have never shorted but it's time to learn this looks prime for it. Pretty sure this is going to tank...
there was no reason for it to be 415 in first place. 250 soonnnn..
It might close the week at $265 or around.
uf nflx raises pricesagain expect huge sub losses
Big big earnings coming for Dropbox
"as warren buffet says, buy when the opportunity arises to buy a good stock on sale."
Should see $345 today easy
Looking worse for shorts by the minutes .....
If Germany throws a tariff on Netflix then it goes down another $50. It is only a matter of time before some foreign government figures out that they can make 10 to 20% off Netflix.
come on shortie-0--- short it again and again and again-PLEASE!
Short squeeze soon
"Loop raises Netflix target to $500, expecting sub growth for yearshttps://seekingalpha.com/news/3566135-loop-raises-netflix-target-expecting-sub-growth-for-years"
I use to have Netflix but switched to HBO Max and glad I did.
Streaming with the use of AI is a more productive way of distributing video. Netflix is the runaway leader. When it is finished claiming its market share in global TV Netflix will be one of the most profitable companies of all time.
$NFLX $FB $WIMI hopefully we go strong in the morning...

"Sell the news , buy the rumor.. Minutes didn mention anything about holding off on rate increases besides being data driven. As always WS tends to over react anytime Powel opens his mouth."
Honestly what’s so great about Netflix? Most of there content you can find online for free or on demand. And they haven’t really had many new reuses of late. I only keep it due to Stranger Things and 2 other titles.
Better get in before its to late.
"Bankers sell then pause and wait for retail investors to buy then bankers sell again. Greedy retail investors will hold the bags, but they deserve holding the bags and learn"

"RBC predicts 30% upside, source CNBC"
"up til 10am EST, then the sell off. yesterday's more than 6% drop with a volume of 22M shares was no joke."
Check out (http://Pick-stocks.com). They just mentioned NFLX in the daily newsletter.
"HAVE 100 SHARES, WILL LOAD MORE TOMORROW"
I called it: NFLX will close at -5 to -6%. It closed at -5.7%. Tomorrow this will open from -1% to +1%
nobody disputes the fact that Netflix is a great company with great service globally. The problem is that it needs to be trading at a reasonable value of 25 to 30 times eaenings which is about $100 per share. Apple is a great global company and it trades at a PE of 19. That's all..
"Amzn all time high , Netflix should follow suit . Come on 405 pm"
There are not enough questions being asked on the profitability of streaming services competing with Netflix.
220 after Friday. This stock is going down the toilet. Sold at 310 made me some money :).
"With that Comcast alliance announced today, I would expect the guidance to be pushed up well beyond current expectations."

No one wants to sell. I see only buyers. The price is going to go up!

am hoping that nflx will beat ER bcz targets are lower this time
"I am a current subscriber of Netflix. However, once Disney rolls out their own streaming platform, I will take my business to them. Unless Netflix provides Live TV, I am not leaving SlingTV.

This is still concerning. This just may open up in the 350's on Monday. There is nothing to be excited about over the weekend.
"they'll do whatever it takes to look good, and not out right lie....Netflix changes its view on ‘views,’ which will boost its numbers by 35%"
Everytime i want to jump in it goes up more and more and more
"Buy , Buy ,FANGS"
of course drop of 1-2 usd in the morning tomorrow then up to 380 the same on monday.
Very good opportunity to buy now. Just added 2000 shares .
"This pop is irrational, I am a long holder, don't ge me wrong I love it but there's no way it can be justified. Much better earnings reports of Netflix have yielded much smaller gains. This is part of the insane market right now. I wish it wasn't but it will correct."
Excellent +$16 AH trading. +$36 by tomorrow. Congratulations my long friends!
Under water since it was $555 at last Sep. Finally I have it dumped. Good luck everyone !

"The momentum reversal is confirmed. Technical support is breaking down. Filling the gap back to 163.22. Bot algos will start to trigger more selling. Then moving down to low 140s. MMs are working hard to keep things orderly and preventing a pps collapse. The only reason that they can is because 90% of the float is held by institutions, hedgies, and insiders, They do not want to #$%$ the market by aggressive selling instead have been slowly decreasing their nflx holdings, booking profits and positioning to profit from the downward momentum. While Goldman and their ilk continue to pump, blow smoke, mislead, and deceive. But the cat is out of the bag now. The constant reiterations of the shills, hawkers, and pumpers are not very convincing anymore. They benefit of the doubt is gone. The growing closer scrutiny, evaluation, analysis, number crunching, realistic projections from numerous diverse unbiased credible sources all agree that nflx pps present absurd extreme over valuation is unjustifiable . The hand writing is on the wall and the wall is crumbling. Greed is turning into fear. Short interest remains low but congregating on the sidelines cautiously waiting to pounce. Technical support eroding. Momentum reversing. The zealots who remain blind to these facts are putting any paper profits or real principle investment at great risk. There are so many less risky good investment opportunities for the individual investor."
"I do declare $550 as the turning point.I said the same thing at $500, but when I'm finally right, its a gut thing.GS is full of it and always have been. Who cares what they say, what are they doing? They are pumping and dumping. How do I know that. They are smart, and Netflix is a $150 stock in value. The PE is over 100 and growth (revenue) is 15% looking backwards and less looking forward. Check out the debt, which won't look so great when the price hits $150 per share. Then don't forget the train coming at Netflix, the recession is going to be tough. What are we experiencing? Huge government spending (stimulus). They are panicking as the money is drying up, states are going under, no revenue. Look at how many stores and businesses that are closed or almost closed, they are going under.The want to force people to go back to work, where? what jobs? If there were jobs, they would be back to work. Netflix needs to correct to have its PE normalized with its competiton, and don't forget the competition is way way too high as well."

I don't know if anyone noticing but I do notice that retail buying is not as much as those manipulator expected even after so much push by their media friends and Analyst friends. I really hope they end up very badly because such manipulation is never healthy for stock market.
"Come Tuesday, longs will get a fresh lemon squeeze"

Great earnings!! And stock is down!! Why it’s going down?
Riskseems extremely risky to be long Netflix at this priceeven the moving averages are considerably lower and they are skewed by Netflix's good days
"Internet moves very fast along with AI. If your a company and it takes you 3 years to ramp up....u are essentially late in the game. By the time Disney Ramos up, Netflix will have 300 million subscribers and will be producing most of the 4K content out there. It will also secure the top contracts for producers and talent out there for the next 5 years.....Disney will find out soon enough what is the point of ramping up if they can’t find talent"

"For all the longs here who bought years ago in the single or double digits, why didn’t u sell when it was above 400? Did u do ur dd and come to a conclusion that the stock was worth more and will keep going up? Just curious"
Moving back to $400? Why the big moves over the past few days?
"If we open over 275, good chance we hit 280. Hope we can hold the lead..Good luck to everyone!"
This could go UP 25 pts. after fed announcement today!
Obama is now running the show. Not doing so well.

NDConceptz $400.00 will be past up .Then we will see $430.00 - $480.00
I think a rumored takeover by Apple is driving this stock higher every day. I really do.
NFLX cooking books ! how do we know that this is not all made up on the subscriptions ?
NFLX $560 coming soon! just look at the past 2 earnings and the channel that this stock has been trading!
Disappointing to see this before earnings.
"If NFLX Adds 3 to 5 dollars today, I am keeping the faith"
Hollywood going nowhere. Hollywood also anti-Trump. This stock will tank. Mentioned this when it was 420. And God Bless Donald John Trump!.
down 3% and everyone thinks this is crash?? amateurs.
Final melt up before the big correction!
Green is a much better color than red; heading back to $400.
NFLX has a long road ahead to correct how Disney just leap over them.
Disney will have high subscriber churn which will slow subscriber growth if they don’t add more new content.
"Debtflix is a bull market phenomenon. When the credit cycle turns, Debtflix will no longer be able to finance itself with junk bonds. Buyer beware. Debtflix has no cash relative to its deep-pocketed competitors like Disney, Comcast, Apple, Amazon, Google/YouTube, etc. Frantic borrowing just to stay in the game is an unsustainable strategy."

Is NFLX down because DIS up and is presumably is taking market share from NFLX.
Wfh stocks will rally this coming quarter. This is where you want to be! This things a beast even when corona is not a thing
I only have 10 shares at 332 I'm not rich or well off but holding

Monday after close NFLX will be up $50.
Nice pickup on dip in premarket. Easy $340 today. Thanks Citigroup.
Next week 390$
"This was there strongest quarter from seasonality perspective. They also tend to always do well and FCF is to be expected in light of stay at home environment. That said, this stock isn't a value play, its supposed to be growth play. Will new subscribers be sustainable even if they pull out great content? I think netflix's best days are behind it and absent diversifying their business model, probably is range bound at best."

maybe I did a mistake and sold everything at once.. looks like it will grow moreanyways that was the easiest 45k I have ever made
easy money just bought 530 shares. earnings will be great and up. Ty for the discount.
CFO is Out! Good move. Direction of company can now move into a positive direction. David Wells was engaged in asshatery of epic proportions. Joy to the World!
"so with a P/E of 106, it will take only 106 years for the company to earn it's current market cap? is that a good deal?

"I know many of you think of shorting Netflix, because it is obviously overvalued. But I wouldn´t do it right now, the stock market can stay for too long irrational than most of us have money! We haven´t seen a proper blow-off top yet, so the highest probability is that these stocks are rocketing higher and higher before they crash and burn. Check out my latest analysis on the US markets in youtube (name: investmenabc). I go over some charts which you most likely haven´t seen anywhere else."
This is OK....Everything else is down.
NFLX momentum==1. ER2. FANGS stock in uptrend now!
This cant hold down here logically. I’m guessing we see a strong reversal to $500 today if market stays strong.
"Bought 50 extra @313,54. Lets see where they are at in 1,5 year."
What’s a better buy? Fb or Nflx?
50% chance this opens above 600 the next day after ER.
I dont often get to brag so let me have this one...played my $AMZN and $NFLX call options purchased yesterday perfectly today...top price for Netflix and near top for Amazon. rarely nail it like that.
I’m going to wait and see how this trades. I might regret not adding under $490 but it could dip more because market tends to overreact. I’d advise waiting until market opens and settles.
"Ask yourself, ""What would Frank Underwood do?"" Who is Frank Underwood?"

The move of NFLX seems some are confirmed that APPLE will buy it at $300.
"Another historic day....Greatest comeback ever! The low today was -13.57. For the 39th time ever it got down at least 13 and only TWICE, did it ever end in the GREEN.

"14% jump in a 200b company, yep, bull market is almost over"
hoping for 350 this week
440 by Tuesday
What’s your trading strategy for today? Do i buy now or kick myself later?
A total sell here wake up
Nflx can't seem to stay above 290. It looks like that is where they are going to suppress it.
What a frustrating period with this stock
This continues tomorrow. Double digit losses.
The market is not even down that much. PURE MANIPULATION
Coming back
it's truly stunning that anyone still thinks shorting Netflix is a good idea
"1. Let's pretend NFLX triumphs over Amazon, Disney, Apple, and Google in streaming and doubles its revenue to $23B.2. Let's pretend they do that without spending a single dollar more in cash flow than 2018.3. $12B in incremental cash flow to the projected -$3.5B FCF burn in 2018 is $8.5B4. $8.5B versus current Enterprise Value of $137B is just a 6.25% ROIC yield after achieving unprecedented success.5. That being said, would you like to buy $NFLX at $280?"
Shorts panic and covering now...... Yay...
this will hit 600 tomorrow hopefully split 10-1and we buy lower.........
328 here we come.
"I love when Goldman Sachs comes out and say buy Netflix, I see another Nvidia in the making."
Bank of America gets even more bullish on Netflix: 'Still more upside for the new king of all media'
Anyone think Netflix is good buy going to burn. Avoid your instinct and avoid this stock as much as possible.This is way overvalued stock because it assume growth will accelerate but in reality not many possible customer left to support growth and also Netflix become star because of cheap service (At Least in developed market where cable cost much higher)and so it not 0 pricing power. This is reason it take 3 month to implement $1-$2 raise in plan.
Bought 400sh in 2009. NFLX is putting my son through school. Little to complain about with this company.
Is this going higher? Good time to enter for long? Or is there a potential for correction to say 500-550?
Susan Rice. Non-starter for half of America. Just sayin'.
"Some people says there are 1.9B house hold and so Netflix can grow much further.Now this exact point I think netflix will never able to grow above 200M level even while growing so fast currently.Here is reason:-out of those 1.9B house hold, 80% people don't make more than $10/day. This mean possible house holds who can afford Netflix service or Netflix like service is <400MNow in market like USA where most make more than $10/day, They have hard time achieving 40% penetration and marketing cost already ballooning. So I don't think Netflix able to achieve 50% overall (Even when you count 2-3% of those poor subscribe & include here.) You reach <200M max. With Service from Disney , Apple, HBO, HULU, Youtube, Facebook and 100's of other countries local, I think 50% penetration is great achievement and that put to 200M max at current price. If they reduce subscriber price than it's different deal but will market allow that. It will cause 30% haircut in no time."
"How many people on this board not only invest but consume Netflix? I just finished streaming ""Collateral,"" a British Crime thriller and it was amazing! An immediate trailer that followed was another original Netflix series, only this one is a Japanese Anime. This puts into perspective for me why their subscribers and stocks are soaring. I'm a LT investor (invested when it was $88/share)."
"Let's see, beats earnings estimate by 30%, Nasdaq up 21 points, and NFLX goes red, AGAIN. Stocks with similar PE's up. What's wrong with this picture?"
"funny thing is, the price action shows this is only down because the current tech sell off.. hmm"
3 months ago NFLX was trading at $329. What is the big deal if drops to $350
This move is all about pricing power. The last time they blew away subscriber estimates after raising prices the stock ran from 185 to 423.
When yahoo deletes a post it just means that they believe in socialist ideals and no longer believe in freedom of speech￼
This is never going back down.subscriptions will Increase and price of subs will rise. Everyone loves netflix
"They know avg joe cant stomach buying here...it will keep rising...until avg joe feels comfortbale down the road when the stock is double because of what could have been easily predicted today. Just the facts. No reason for Netflix to stay under 200B. until something sends it off the rails...and so far rates are low, competition still a year away."
Sell NFLX and buy ROKU!!!It's gonna rock on ER!!!
The stock would have rallied regardless of Goldman sachs comment today. So why keep giving them credit?

"Take advantage of the artificially low volume pump stock price today and sell before the dump. As I have said in the past, ask your CPA for their opinion on holding a stock of a company that has a current P/E ratios of over 200 and see what they tell you.

Citigroup raised PT from $450 to $580
Bought 200 shares in 2002 at $25 sold at $12 because Walmart and Blockbuster were getting into dvd mail rental. These 200 shares woukl be worth $620000 today. Sigh.
"Everyone predicting the death of Netflix because of Disney plus, not sure if y’all have actually seen Disney’s + but for the most part it has extremely entertaining shows if you are under the age of 7. Also this 10 million subscriber number doesn’t take into account all the free one year trials. If something is free everyone will go for it."
Disney owns FOX and ABC. Go do your homework on all their content then come and tell me NFLX has a moat on original content
shorts must have just seen The Haunting of Hill House
"Was -4 earlier today and now +6, nothing is going to stop this stock until we hit earnings and it will pop more. Got in at $160 last year still holding 3k shares"
Holding my calls overnight.There's a good chance she will explode tomorrow. She's had enough rest.It's about time for NFLX to catch up with the DOW. $530 tomorrow is a distinct possibility.
"NFLX closed above that infamous resistance point, $486.50, two days in a row. $521 this week is back in sight. If the DOW finished above 30,k000, NFLX can reach $5545."
"buying started, early !"

"Is netflix business model recession proof in your opinion, when things are not as good, consumers retreat to there televisions and movie and series content, to save cost of other activities that are much more expensive?? Opinions are welcome thanks!!"
This is a $50 stock at best
I am getting flashbacks to 2011 with $NFLX and look what happened
They up the price because they have to do something. Otherwise they’d look bad for being so far from the price and short term trend.
"the 10 year is 3%rates are moving upretail sales low, this monthinterest rates uptime for nflx to correct?"
I don't have gut to buy NFLX at $391. I may get in at $325. My experience tells me loss/win ratio is 80/20 at current price. I will wait for the bubble bursting this week. At the current price I would rather buy Fb with much better valuation.
Netflix is producing much more movies than everyone combined with a very high degree of success.....that is what Disney or anyone else has to be in order to compete with Netflix. All that money and old movies is not going to change that.
Bought at 494$  Expecting to hit 530$ next week
Never bet against NFLX!!! Exceptional company and visionary management!!!
I thought yesterday was horrific but seeing the market fly today including Nasdaq I can’t believe we are not running after the deep selloff yesterday. I’ve chosen to hold but it sure is painful right now.
NFLX next 3 month revenue per subscriber = $31.1 (8% higher). Reason Most of subscriber yet to see price increase.They somehow hide this detail and market celebrating too fast I think.
Another $1 trillion market cap company in the next 5 years. Yes !
Any predictions for tomorrow?
Short squeeze. Going over 300 by next week before retreating...
"Bought 375 yesterday, 100 395@0.16 today - waiting for the big squeeze tomorrow !"

"Does anyone not find it suspicious that a ""vaccine"" release immediately follows days after dems steal the Presidency? Or do we all just not care?"
Cord cutting continues and nflx will do just fine. The drop is an opportunity to buy some shares because it will be $400 but the end of the year.

Good bye longs! You’re going home early but see ya next week
$360-$364 today close
my guess is that this stock moves higher next week with the rest of the market
Have a good weekend you all. Our stock went up quite a bit. Cheers and untill monday!

still over priced!
"“Over the next 5 years subscription growth will accelerate once 5G becomes available. Anyone within range of a cell tower signal will have access to affordable broadband Internet, which is what's needed for NFLX. That will make NFLX the most ""affordable luxury"" in virtually every corner of the planet, especially in areas where local TV choices have been traditionally very limited. The result will be an explosion in non-US subscriptions, which we're already starting to see evidence for in the most recent couple of quarters.This growth will, in turn, further accelerate the decline in traditional TV viability as ""cord cutting"" becomes pervasive. Expect continued upside ""surprises"" as this industry transformation continues. All good news for NFLX shareholders.”"
350$ by few minutes...amazing résultat...new Price Target 400$
"Everyone think Netflix susbcription will raise as they make more netflix orignal and so their lead increase.Simple question:-How many total Episode on Netflix Orignal Drama they produced in last 5 years:- Answer will surprise you. It's only 400. (There are B Grade Movies and Commedy shows and Marvel Orignal exclusive (Likely pulled out in 2019) l which I am not counting).In other word, if I start watNow how many shows Disney already have:- Probably 4000+. How much content Disney/Fox will generate $15B orignal.Disney also have 1000's movies. So if you have to choose between Disney or Netflix service which one will you go with? I think answer is very obvious.Netflix will continue license external content but that also mean it limit it's own and number above may not improve much.2019 coming fast and smart likely going to run before that. All this analyst pumping may be way to exit without stock price crash."
Under the hood this is still a rental shop for out-of-season used DVDs. They are so out of the FAANG league.

I wouldn’t short Netflix. It will go up $100 per share if Microsoft announced it’s interested in Netflix.
This is the time in the market where I stop paying attention to stocks. A bunch of institutional traders are following each other like sheep in order to boost their bottom line for Christmas bonuses. No reality is involved here. So I just wait them out and maybe scope out some buying opportunities.

With all their debt and now rising interest rates and completion you have to wonder why they are screaming for HELP by raising fees this is a big gamble on their part if you ask me since they had a bad experience in the past by doing the exact same thing only this one on a much larger scale.
"From seeking alpha: ""all this cr*p about the prior product from a start-up, not the commercialized product - the outcome of that spending - $EOSE currently has.Did you know that the initial products from many start-ups aren't perfect? I mean, $nflx used to MAIL DVDs. Crazy, right?This short report is laughable . And this ice berg #$%$ firm will get sued to pieces."""
This weakness is only temporary. Within a week NFLX will return to 380 level. Keeping rates unchanged for a long time will keep it strong for a long time
"Heard every opinion out there on earnings. I’m leaning towards the price hike is cause earnings report is huge. Supposedly 2019 is going to be tougher on everyone and the competition coming out, they can raise prices because numbers are BIG. Raise prices on a miss with earnings? No"
22 trading days before earning. If their is no disaster like worldwar or simular this terribly stock will climb meaby 80% of the trading days of them.
"For the naysayers (and the longs who know a good company and investment when they see one):Netflix is a positive cash flow company, they are making money hand over fist. They currently owe more than they make, but as they gain subscribers (projected 200+ million by 2020) and pay the debt down NFLX will become one of the wealthiest companies on the planet. Companies borrow money all the time, even blue chip companies, to invest in growth and infrastructure. FB borrowed a ton of money before they were net positive, so did Sirius XM and AMZN. The math is there, and it's simple, that's why the stock price is what it is, with 79%+ institutional investment. The institutional investment wouldn't be so high if the banks didn't see a golden goose. Shorties just want to try and drive the price down with nonsense so they can make a 4-5% gain here or there, while us longs are already up over 100% on the year. I know what side I'd rather be on with this stock. The shorts are going to get burned and then cry that it's manipulation or some other nonsense. It's hilarious how no matter how well a stock is doing, there is always the ""sky is falling"" types that cry doom and gloom. If they'd care to take a look at numbers, NFLX only has a 4.5% short interest on its share float. That's literally like saying 4.5 out of 100 people think the stock is going to go down in the short term. That's extremely low. Most shorters don't have the stomach to watch a 5-10% rise above their short price, and they close with a loss; that is going to happen with the short float leading up to earnings, and we might get a nice little 2-3% squeeze on top of the next rally. If you shorties were confident in your position you wouldn't be on here day after day, hour after hour, posting non-stop ""armageddon is coming"" nonsense. But hey, good luck."
I predict earnings of $1.58 and 6.8 million new subscribers. 52 week high on Wednesday. Buy now.
"what do you think a reasonable PE will be when Netflix reaches saturation. it's not a matter of IF, but when it reaches saturation when sub and revenue growth reaches 10-15% annually. I think at that time, PE will be closer to 20 (Disney is trading at a PE of 15 right now). If EPS is $9 at that time, NFLX won't be worth more than $200. and that's at saturation in a out 5 years."
"Toss a coin to the Witcher, he will make you richer......."
"Citi reiterated its Buy rating on Roku and raised its price target from $220 to $375 per share. Analyst Jason Bazinet believes that the company's Discovery+ streaming distribution agreement and likely deal with HBO Max creates room for further upside. In addition, Bazinet sees further upside potential in Roku's international expansion efforts.So I guess NFLX is out of favor"
in the absence of net neutrality I see 500 as a real possibility

$385 easily today
Is a entry point people or still a little more down to go!!
Have a hard time to hold it..... Sell or hold......
"The reason for the big jump: According to The Verge, Netflix $NFLX will be introducing price hikes for US subscribers today,The basic plan will remain at $9 per monthThe standard plan will be increased by $1 to $14 per monthThe premium plan will be increased by $2 to $18"
"We were set up by the market to buy into what ""they"" already knew. When Warner, Disney and the rest of them pull content and launch there own streaming service Netflix will pull back further unless we improve profit margins. imho"
Content is king.Needham is wrong.Huge upside potential for NFLX with adds.And it will come....
"There is no stopping this. Analysts are embarrassed because they keep having to make up an excuse to up their models big time. This is up 68% or $57 billion in 2 months on no news other than a 1.9M subscriber beat. This is pure euphoria. No way to trade this except go long and hope it keeps going. No telling how high this will get before earnings release next month. Their sub guidance was very low (same as last quarter, which they beat), so any fool can figure they will beat again by the same amount. Does stock go up another 68%? At some point, the market cap is so high that it would imply they capture all entertainment dollars in the world. Guess that would be a trillion dollar cap? We could hit that by 2020 at this rate."
Happy for Netflix investors! Congratulations!
Breakout coming ...?
NFLX is ripe to take off after today’s action. Load up on the call option for some real money.
100 shares now from 55. Wish I would have had the funds free to buy more on last dip. Ready for $450!
this will be green by lunchtime
Monday we should see 10% gains AT least wich means 350$ by EOD. Then if markets are good we should see 375$ by friday
oops there goes the dow
"I'm new to investing, yesterday I learned a very important lesson about setting a stop loss"
"Maybe Microsoft will buy it , who knows"
Here we go! :)
just picked up 1500 shrs. shutdown 2 coming.

You would think people would be buying at this price
Looks like Zachary sold his position on Friday and is now blaming others.
Just watched Jingle Jangle on Netflix.I'm not into Christmas movies. I don't like musicals but this is a stunning movie. Love or hate Netflix; After Klaus they just prove again they don't have to fear Disney.
hopefully a big day to close out the week tomorrow
LOVE FAKE $NFLX ACCOUNTS TO PUMP the STOCK PRICE!
Second lockdown coming. Expect nflx to skyrocket 50-100
the other faangs has some modest drop. This one fall hard. Why?
"small reason big stocks are down a little bit today is because two new ipos are coming out doordash tomorrow and airbnb on thursday but a nice run up to $521 is not to be overlooked this thing is going to fly once news of Netflix releasing gaming, live t.v, Broadway musicals and other huge news hits the mainstream. Today I am taking the day off."
what is happening!??!!?!? should I buy yet
Momentum shift to the upside is coming. Shorts began to exit positions pre-market and again after The Fed's comments. Positive sentiment and any good news in this stock leads to multiple gap up days.
Unbelievable!!!!! You guys are just printing money over here. Congrats longs.
"Going to $750,,, easy money"
$525 is still possible today.
JP Morgan analyst Douglas Anmuth / buy on Netflix. Raising target to 535 USG for 480 USD before.
"The best explanation of what the problem with NFLX is articulated in the article below. The price action is beginning to show that the market is finally realizing that NFLX is overvalued. One could argue that the action is simply in line with the market move, but if one reviews the price action closely, you can see the initial stages of facing reality has begun.The likelihood that NFLX will breach its high of ~286 is very small for a very long time. Instead, watch it bounce around a bit with a bias towards a steady decline that will bring it to the 186 area. Could go down much further than that.NFLX is a great company that, quoting the article, is ""incomprehensibly overvalued"".https://investorplace.com/2018/02/nflx-stock-uncertain-future/#.Wn8QJainHIU"
Netflix rules I’m soooo hooked on then. From the beginning never cared about lower costs cuz all the other streamers Can’t compete against the king of the jungle.

Disney gross rev $69B and Netflix is $6B Market Cap is $323B for Disney and Netflix $222BThey have about 1/2 the subscribers in 1 year.Which is a better valuation?
345 350 380 today and tomorrow
Even piracy is dropping like a rock because the new programming and music is such dreck that folks won't even bother to steal it.
Do we hit $423 by Options Ex on Friday?
To the north we go!
The number at 830 had 0 to do with Netflix we trade to 270 this week easy
Netflix and everyone on board the ship happy New Years true leader of them all
"So if they give away a billion free subscriptions and show 1000% “subscription growth” (lol) at the expense of zero margin and losses then the stock will shoot up 100x fold in one day, correct? Is this what people are chasing??? They missed eps by a mile because of that (just gave free or cheap subs) yet showed a “subscriber beat” so called and now added 20 BILLION to their market cap based on that?? Makes total sense in this incredible market bubble of course...keep on buying!!!"
OTT platforms watch time has been increased largely due to COVID. This quarter is going to really interesting for Netflix.
Nice 3 day run comes to an end....Nice comeback. Let's start a new one tomorrow.What stopped the rally when it hit $350?
"funny , 3 comments about heavy overvaluation and this stock recover emidatly."
Why are we crashing
When you sell a covered call your giveaway is the strike price you sell the covered call + premium ( $100).I think the Jan 20 $400 calls sell for $65.Just google aapl options and look but make sure time frame and strike price is correct.The Nasdaq option chain is the easiest to read
this is the most meaningless drop ever.
You will see $320 very soon. This is solid business with $400 target price for 2018.
"NFLX subs are up, earnings are up, missing projections was taken way out of context by bias articles. NFLX 4 EVER."
"Even if The Nasdaq is down, if a company does well there is no reason to justify a 9% swing in price from its high yesterday to what it is today. Hell, on a price to percentage loss basis, neither FB or AMZN came anywhere near to losing what this did, and this company just beat earnings forecast by 30%."
if it breaks 550 prior resistance it is done.
"Why is this still down doesn’t make any sense NFLX beat ER all FANGS are up, whoever that selling or shorting this will regret it badly come after hours."
Best NASDAQ Stocks Under One Dollar. Go to (http://1dollar-stox.online)
It's early but futures Sky high
Every FANG stock up significantly today except the one the crushed earnings. Something seriously wrong with that picture.
Another upgrade from sun trust bank from hold to buy baby.
"Some nut on CNBC said 'sold half my shares, I'm still in the game"". Sounds good but how does this NUT feel now that this WINNER is up almost 9% after hours. 9% is a great gain for the YEAR let along for a few minutes!"
This is going to be us boys in a few weeks. 500 coming
Let's hope it closes green today
Should see 35 - 50 shr increase.
after 280 little pull back then 315.
Lmao at shorts
Lots of volume after hours. Over 1.5 million shares just with blocks over 10k in 35 minutes.
HBO Max is better in my opinion.
"So the squid has an opinion, funny how they announce after a quarter close but prior to earnings. Then we find out there was a change to capital structure like bonds issued. What does the squid have in store this quarter? Around 12/24 it was $243, vs pre-market of $279, that's a 14% increase in 6 trading days. What was the news?"
this is gonna drop imo
Now people are beginning to get concerned.
what's the price target for today 420?
I placed $2500 on PUTS and $2500 on $600CALLS. Best way to play earnings. 1000% profit here I come.
This really is too easy. I had 220 last week nd 230 this week and looks like we will exceed that. I am wondering if my call for 250 post ER is too conservative. This just keeps running and may pop well over 10% when the subscriber growth comes in.
Don’t worry guys  Will back again 370$
High today of $350. Love my NFLX long position and the services it provides. It will soon be providing programs to more countries and the revenues will continue to grow. I also do not mind paying a dollar more every few years they increase prices since it adds so much money to the bottom line and helps my portfolio many times over. GLTAL and GO NFLX!!!
going ro 200
NFLX is one of a few oversold elite stocks which are over due to rebound hugely soon!Target $450!
What will happen to the shorts tomorrow?
BUY:. .. MU.. JD... GE.. DESPThank me later
This thing always seems to give up its gains in the afternoon. At least the market closes at 1 today.
Look at the 6 month chart. Similar drop offs from March 9th thru April 2nd and April 17th thru April 25th. Bounced back with a vengeance.
I'm hoping for a pop to $435-$440 after earnings.
yesssssssssssssssss
NFLX OPEN $245 TOMORROW
if it closes over 380. you better ADD
"This dip is actually good for long-term holders in my opinion, calls will be bought"
It is always good to see them shorts running for cover
"Pre-earnings options volume in Netflix is 1.9x normal with calls leading puts 9:5. Implied volatility suggests the market is anticipating a move near 9.5%, or $47.71, after results are released. Median move over the past eight quarters is 3.8%."
I got out before earnings but I’m glad for those who held on. So many nflx haters eating their crow tonight. I love the company. I just was worried stock might sell off on earnings but looking back you knew sub number would be good based on what they said about queens gambit.
phenomenal growth.
"One year ago NFLX was trading at $140. Today it closes over $300. Very impressive. But has the company and its prospects really changed that much? What am I missing? This is madness, right?"
CONTROLLED!
With all the price target increases to 650+ this'll be 600 tomorrow.
"RBC Capital has a 12-month price target of 440 on the stock, that's a lot of upside from here."
"Television is the best babysitter I know. I put Netflix on for my 2 year old, my 4 year old and my 9 year old. They watch it 5 hours a day."
With subscription prices coming analysts need to raise their revenue and earnings estimates.

Anyone need Netflix to plummet? I sure do.
Load up while you can.
This time next week All time high
Is it just me but I don’t feel comfortable investing any money in this market for long term investing.
And it don’t stop...and it won’t stop.

"Netflix seems to have large investment fraud going. I posted yesterday and have 0 response. I will keep try to educate people.Here is How this work.There are 100's sites that provide free Netflix access. 1.> First creating fake paid accounts. (Given how much stock price appreciating without down days, it's likely at peak.)2.> They then generate cookies and access links for account and database.3.> They have 100's sites where they distribute them. Mainly using three method -> Cookies, Access Links and Apps like Last Pass, near 0 balance Credi card account on your name (Kite App)It's look like targeted to various different country. Unless you have VPN to that specific country it won't work. Searching Free Netflix, Free Netflix for life, free Netflix for year, Netflix cookies ...... You see result yourself. Youtube have 100's video showing step by step guide as well.Now my question is who spending so much time to create fake paid account, generate cookies, access links or store password in crowd wallets?Why they doing it? Who pay bills?Given how much websites and you tube videos you find, This is very large scale fraud done very openly."

Man I loaded up this is going 330.00 closing green. Kevin O’Leary said loves Netflix and buying more more. Watch this turn up trend. CNBC loves to scare people out of there money and have people panic.
Every stock has gone up. Only Netflix is not doing well. There will be a day when it will fly too. Just hold this stock. Do not sell.
"Value of 450.00 at this price its a buy and hold, Dust and Drama has settled, its on its way back up"
"What a run, congratulations to the winners"
Someone is buying a lot. I see it going to $350.00. Could be tomorrow or Thursday. I’ve seen this pop 5 to 10% in 1 day. Love Netflix
I would imagine it is difficult to manipulate a stock substantially higher when the manipulators are the only ones doing the buying.
patience is key.. Netflix will reach $500. No one else has a brand like them and content like them . Overall great company and is very profitable and is expanding rapidly internationally. Long Netflix.
I’m new to this stock. Bought around $260 and then more around $263. Made $4500. What do I do? Keep it till Jan 16th and sell half of it before earnings. I hear 50/50 news for the earnings. Any advise here?
"Taking a poll. Tomorrow when I wake up I will do one of two things. Thumbs up if I should go in the backyard and set a pile of cash on fire, thumbs down if I should log into my computer and buy NFLX?"
I guess I should sell my nflx and put it into quality high flyers like jumia fcel or nio . I liked jumia as a spec in the teens but $30 give me a break. That company is years away at best. And sell my amazon for quality company like fcel that has mastered the art of dilution and still not going bankrupt. I really give up lol.
Goldman Sachs raised its price target on Netflix to $450 per share from $400 per sharehttps://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/14/goldman-raises-netflix-price-target-predicts-subscriber-growth-will-top-the-street-next-week.html
NFLX will see 195 by xmas.
Well its up again in premarket. We need this to start ramping up as earnings are coming. Can we keep it Green today?
I think it’s a small pullback back to 300 this week or next sure . Wait for a new upgrade . Don’t sell now
Solid as ROCK. 350 by Friday ?
"Call and Put trading lately weird. I do lot of trading. I have this exprience since last few weeks specially with $CAT and $NFLX.Here is what I learn.When I try to sell put and if it don't sell even it's near bid, I think that mean stock likely going up.If try to sell put and able to sell near ask, stock likley going downSame with Calls.In other word, They are lately controling entire market. If you want to find biggest AI Usage, you will find in Stock market. Those AI software know exactly where market going because they are making market.Dangerous world. Small Computer mistake can cause unreasonable losses and when it work, it design to do unthinkable."
Low rate forever and ever! NFLX loves low rates. Spend away!
Have any have you seen the worldwide market share of all the other media companies? Prime is the only one that even comes close! It’s all about quality original content!
Will go lower
Netflix should be doing well
why is this going down?
Look at NFLX chart over time ... it’s a winner baby
Netflix is the best
"So far!Netflix Q1 EPS, Revenue Surge Boosted by COVID-19 Stay-at-Home Orders; Shares Down After HoursBY MT Newswires— 4:25 PM ET 04/21/202004:25 PM EDT, 04/21/2020 (MT Newswires) -- Netflix reported Q1 EPS of $1.57 compared with $0.76 a year earlier as the streaming entertainment company's business was boosted by people staying at home because of the COVID-19 pandemic.The company reported revenue of $5.8 billion compared with $4.5 billion a year earlier. The consensus estimate called for EPS of $1.64 and revenue of $5.75 billion, according to Capital IQ.The company expects 190 million global paid memberships in Q2 compared with 152 million a year earlier. It expects revenue of $6 billion and EPS of $1.81 in Q2. The consensus estimate is for EPS of $1.54 and revenue of $5.95 billion for Q2, according to Capital IQ.""Our membership growth has temporarily accelerated due to home confinement"" but as stay-at-home orders are lifted the company expects growth and viewing to slump, the company said in a letter to shareholders. Netflix expects 7.5 million global paid net additions in Q2, however ""this is mostly guesswork"" because of uncertainty around the end of home confinements."
Wow selling tomorrow
they try to keep it down for options?
$400 after earning...next Tuesday.... buy
Up then consolidates..Up again then consolidates..Up again the consolidates. This baby is going higher then higher then higher than high!!!
Tomorrow morning will breach 400 easily.
"Goldman gets more bullish on NFLX, after hours"
You all should have listened to my advice! Sold before earnings and made a fortune. Sell this now it will continue to go down. No reason to hold on to it. Take my advice longs. LOL
markets getting pummeled tomm5
Final trade yesterday on CNBC - sell NFLX. How's that working for you?
313 yesterday 340 middle of today. Is this still one bullmarket!
Down in after hours of course
"I think anyone investing big on NFLX should balance out between NFLX and $DIS. I exit all my short on NFLX last week. Should have waiting until Thursday but I decided to exit completely and didn't stop.I do went long on $DIS on Friday (Also $FB).Here are reason why.1.> Disney Launch of ESPN stream will likely huge success. Lot of people waiting for that. This should known in 6 month.2.> This might help Netflix somewhat (Not whole lot of as most in USA at least already have netflix, With sharing, I think 80-90% penetrated which is incredible but also mean not much left to gain. ) and Most International market specially development country, Cable is still much cheaper than Streaming service.3.> ESPN pricing means Netflix lost pricing power. Now it will compared with ESPN. Also Most of local channel either easily available through Antenna or Free with Advertisement on most of TV Streaming box apps (Like ABC, NBC, FOX....)3.> As Disney launch full streaming service, Their offering will appealing and remove any remaining pricing power Netflix has. It might forced to lower price (Depend on how aggressive Disney is)"

Looks like first REAL resistance is around 320!!
"Just cancelled my subscription. Just so everyone knows Netflix is taking calls regarding Obama's and are documenting every call. Netflix is being bombarded with calls and if they get enough they will cease interaction with Obamas. Please take a moment to call Netflix, it will make a difference..."
Just shorted NFLX again at $329.70.
After hours on a Thursday is an options favor bump for a mega client. Someone needed this over $125 in a big way.
sweet Goldman Sachs raise price Target for Netflix to 490$ by next year .....start buying guys
"Everytime market caves in the morning, it ends up closing green"
NFLX has not corrected at all today. The market has but not NFLX.
"Same price now, as SUMMER 2020. what a JOKE."
I wonder if this could recover to 370 today
375 by closing
Jefferies Boosts Netflix Target To $610 With 'Bull Case' Of $700
500 steady in few weeks
Netflix beat the last 3 earnings. I hope next one will also beat.
Options trading priced in 10% volatility. Call buyers need NFLX to move 10% up to begin making money. Right now only 6% gain so both call and put buyers lose money if they bet on the earnings using options.
after earnings released
"If you want the best content, then you have to have Netflix along with HBO. Netflix knows that which is why they can raise rates and continue to gain in subscribers. Will new entrants like Disney prove to be competitive? Maybe someday in the future when they can provide comparable content. No one will drop Netflix for Disney. But, people might add Disney for the kids. That's the truth!"
Stock split in the horizon?
They increased $2 monthly on 80-100 million subs. Thats 2.4 billion off 3 billion yearly debt. Numbers still dont add up. They need minimum $5 price increase to offset cost/debt to start to have positive cash flow. But at that price they wont be competitive anymore and will need to spend more to retain customers. And at this point Its not a growth stock anymore and it shouldnt be trading at 100+ PE.
Why did all the stocks across the board go down at 11:08 today?
-------------> nflxs will be OBSOLETE <----------------https://youtu.be/pzz6-BOmbM4
Should of bought it at a bargain. 380.00
410 close today.
"Shorted 100 shares at 309, will hold through earnings,"
"Well technically today was NOT a good day for short term bears, myself included!! Two intradays in a roll of higher lows and today a higher high. RSIs improved slightly to mid higher lower 40s to mid 40s so the buyers are coming in. The 9 and 14 day stochastic got better but still in oversold territory! With 3 weeks left on my Nov 170 puts, I may have to pull the ripcord tomorrow as my time premium is slowly rotting away. I'm still a believer that the technicals indicate a downtrend with near term support at $252. The fundamentals for NFLX remain the same which are NOT GOOD ... burning thru cash, issuing more debt to pay for content and operational costs (aka, crazy salaries, $500M for Seinfeld! Seriously??!!), competition is coming from AAPL and DIS which are cash rich and can outlast NFLX, negative cash flow cannot continue at this pace, NFLX may win the awards BUT cash is the name of the game here in the long run, US subs supporting foreign subs, how much longer can that go on. Good luck to all the shorts out there but in the short run, as myself, I may have to eat the loss and roll into further out dated puts to make up for this loss!!"
Wonderful deal !!!!
could apple buy netflix?or do you think apple will go on their own on the streaming market?
Don’t get left out on the way up this week...
$500 Stock now
Im hoping to get back at my buy in so I can sell out of this market. 2018 is not looking good and Trump doesn't make it any better. They may trap us for quite a while down here.
Been waiting for Goldman Sachs upgrade and here it is. For some reason theirs has the biggest impact on the stock. Let’s see what happens.
"like I said before, if this were to crash below $305 it would've done it already."
when does the earning report come out Thur Pre or market close?
selling? why...LOL
"This wants to really take off, but markets are a joke today."
"Ok, thats where NFLX was at 1 1/2 months ago... Good opportunity to buy."
Bought at 352!!
Netflix is also starting to become the new Bollywood of India! 3Q and 4Q growth is going to be lit!
"Spike at open was clearly manipulation. Open market order does that quickly. Good side is there is no selling pressure at least from retail and As usaual all big player working togather to take control. I think we will have slow selling all day just like Friday. Again no one know what those manipulator thinking but one thing sure, these stock is way overvalue and most manipulator know limit at which they should stop. I think that limit closer than it look."
When everyone is selling.. I buy 
"Believe it or not: NFLX is the next internet-related $1000 stock after AMZN, GOOGL, BKNG..."

If you compare to mcaps of other big stocks and earnings ratio no reason this cannot be 400b. Will just go up almost continuously like Tesla. Everyone starting to question the value of everything nowadays
time to buy some putsthis way too high already
"People paying nearly 50% of current market value (About $60B) just to some recent Netflix Exclusive Hits. I put those hits value just around $10B ( This is how much Very long list of Super Hit HBO shows ever worth to HBO valuation)Here is How I would divide value of Current Netflix Enterprise valueCurrent Subscriber:-About $40B ( $330/Subscriber) :- Reason:- Very high penetration to many market give higher value ($360 =3 year fee), Raising Marketing cost mean likely high chrun rate cut some ($30-$40 negative)Growth:- $25B (Given high value but please note this limit based on Raising Marketing cost- make risky and Growth will find some trouble in couple year, Competition also factor here. )Orignal Content:- $10B ( They have spend about $6-7B on orignal content with some hit)Up Coming Content :- $5B (This is value they creating after paying for content, This assume continue success in shows.)License Content:- $5B (Many limited time, Old content has not much value either)Other :- $5BTotal:-$90B Enterprise value =$75B market value ( About $15B for debt and Content value reduction which already accounted above)I am very generous on give This company valuation and still that = 30-40% hair cut to current market value."
Hahaha the low today was $346 so this is a normal intraday move for this stock
pre market just moving wow great for people like me under 332
Almost green again. Not bad.
Terrible situation with tech. Looks like 2000 or 2008 all over. I see no bottom. Sorry. Wish I did because I hold tech.
Sell ASAP at open $355 or less
5 more percent today :)
"A hugely over-priced stock...and the fact that they're considering share buy-backs is insane!....they're barely cash flow positive as it is....they should be doing the exact opposite, SELLING shares at these lofty prices and using the money to fight off increasing competition.....the outdated ""maximizing shareholder value"" mantra comes a cropper eventually, just look at GE and Boeing."
My order for 350 shrs is in.
"$INTC $NFLX $WIMI $BA most of the tech stocks sitting on strong support level and they have strong earnings coming up. Chart is also setting up very nicely, wouldn't be surprise to see strong price action upwards for the next few weeks."
Does this mean that Betamax tapes will be poplar again.
It is clear to me that NFLX will rise past $400 in a few days...Asian growth not even factored in the numbers yet...wow
500 go go
480 tomorrow EPS missed earning missed
BUY BUY BUY BUY

people that keep talking about option volume clearly don't understand the highest volume will always point to current price...look at the open interest that is your actual clue of what is to come which points to 550 dip and upper range of 570
"Another historic BAD day....17th time it opens +7 in the green and 2nd time time it ends in the red..First time was June 27, +8.17 ended -9 for the day.Red for the 4th day in a row. 10 out of the last 12What else can you ask for when you start the day +7.44??6th day in a row that the previous day's high was not reachedWhat does it take to HOLD A LEAD??And, the next trade day is FRIDAY.. We have not had a green Friday since Oct. 12, 4 red in a row.8 of the last 9, 19 of last 23......Hard to get to 350 if we can't get back to 280....."
Looks like another up day. Glad I'm still in the game. Impressive.

"Netflix took a good series ""The Designated Survivor"" and ruined it. They added two gay black guys, and a transgender sister brother. They also made it filled with democrat propaganda."
"Is $NFLX BUBBLE a FREE MONEY ATM????The stock price is getting PUMPED Parabolically without a single break, while the Earnings are TANKING!!!"
Upgrades are very good. 350 in no time

"Still a long way to fall, best to take profits if you have them. This stock more than doubled over a year, and things like that just don't last. Disney will be big competition, and they'll start pulling their programming for their own streaming service."
Wow beat by 2 million+ subscribers. To 700+ by end of week!

"Just see the trend, Netflix always break upon earnings.. and always catches up after a week or 2.. I suggest have some patience, this stock will be 550 in a month."
they just posted their BIGGEST quarter EVER. It's worth $550 as of today.
Wells lowers price target to 268 from 308 Ouch!
The revenue generation and acceleration pushing competitors further behind...if netflix feels this is the time to raise the prices(which were inevitable to anyway with a brain0...competition il have no other recourse..the competition will have 0 edge. Z
in 2015 shares were 700 before the 7 to 1 split. I noticed news media is not meeting this. so technically the stock is higher than amazon around well over $2800 a share since 2015. I'm still skeptical as to why everyone is downing the stock is there a catch....
Wow! NFLX is moving higher. Yeah!!
buying these stocks right now is like buying in 2000 or 2008 $AMZN $NFLX $AAPL $FB $TSLA $NVDA $BABA $GOOGL $QQQ
I bought 1000 stocks at 405 with margin and paying interest daily. What should I do?
content sources getting more and more fragmented. The providers with the best exclusive content win
Relax people over reacting for no reason. Stop looking at it everyday it’s going to give a to much emotion just stop it. It’s going back up soon
"Do your own research of $IQ and $huya and you'll see, way more upside there than Netflix. Netflix had a great run this year, don't get me wrong but look elsewhere for better upside"
"People don't look into but it increasingly costly for Netflix to get subscriber. This include Domestic being more difficult but Overseas this is slowly becoming problem as well.They spending whole lot to get growth but cost to get new Subscriber is not sustainable.Domestic it already reaching near $100 and overseas it's near $50.Domestic is worst it double over last couple year. That mean it's increasingly difficult for new customer which expected given most already have it. Overeas given 150 country launch, it's hard to determine but I think last Quater it's clear, cost is raising very quickly.Now why they keep spending more on advertisement in domestic.simple:- They have to replace all customer who they losing. Otherwise it will look they start losing subscriber instead gaining and stock will tank. If stock tank, it will much harder to finance spending & also retain talent. They likely offering stock as part of their content deal as well.In otherword, This is how you can hide serious problem with either Churn Rate or harder to get new customer.It's also possible that many are keep cancelling and resigning. Again that's actually best hope. Otherwise some point it will hard to replace leaving customer and stock will tank very badly."
volume is shot. largest open contracts again point to 550 strike for friday. VIX is poking it's head out. Exit now and enter back in 1-2 weeks later and catch the bounce look for as close to 500 but 520's might also be decent entry
"The current five most popular series on rotten tomatoes (#1, #2, #3, #4, and #5), are all Netflix. This is what you call complete domination.

"Buy ...300 by Wednesday, next week"
Sell or hold until Monday? I'm down big. I bought at 347. Please advise
Do you honestly think those that are buying the monthly description to Disney for their kids are going to cancel Netflix? Come on!!! What are they going to watch !?!
Why in the hell they have Just PUMPED $NFLX BUBBLE by $10 Per share in 7 seconds???How the hell is that possible????
$550 calls look beautiful. Told you to buy them cheap this morning.
385-390 is so close. Don’t worry about it.

Closing at 370.00 for the long weekend see you next week Tuesday. Let’s thanks ours troops for there hard work and dedication for there service. May God bless them all Thank you
Bulls what do you think about disney entering the streaming service game? Will netflix take a decent hit in the short term because they will lose at least 10% of the movies and shows.
"Gregory, where did you get the valuation of 200 Billion buyout. I agree something is up, just wondering about the buyout bid. Would that make the stock worth $460."
any predictions on earnings
Im new to options.I purchased NFLX call spreadCall Buy 227 and call sell 237. Feb.Was playing safe.Are these call spread orders connected?Is it possible to close only the sell and go long with the buy?Is it possible to book some profit or do I need to wait till Friday expiration date.
What a close ¡¡¡¡¡
"I am seeing some really great relative strength. Netflix looks like it wants to take off, a coiled spring ready to fly."
The went to the left and alienated half their subscribers. When will companies learn and keep politics out of their business models? Free fall to below $200 in just a few weeks folks and below $75 by 2019.
"Sadly, more downside to come. US subscribers' continue to fall into Q3 2018.https://seekingalpha.com/article/4187641-netflixs-sell-starts"
WHERE ARE ALL THOSE NAYSAYERS PLEASE COME SAY HELLO
Apple to go with 4:1 split. What do you think about the possibility of a Netflix stock split?
"should have stay on my market, manipulation big is obsiuly big par of US since regan quit, bouth dem and rep. best time to trade in history is in internet young age, nowdays is not small savers thing to be profitable.Manipulation big time in my country also but not gaint like in this stock."

"9 day unbeaten streak keeps going! Back to back all green days come to an end.Got down 7.33. Current run is now 86.39. But, it started that day at 231.23.Best day since Dec. 6 when the low reaches at lest 7 in the red.That day it got down 8.19 and finished 7.55 in the green.107th time it gets below 7 and 12th time it ends in the green.Best close since Nov. 7, 327.50.Have opened in the green 4 days in a row."
No 370 today... If still green... I'm very thankful.
"Going higher, much higher."
"In a few years, this will be trading in the 100s. Loading up on cheap puts now"
Why is $486.50 so hard to break through? What's there?
"Funny, We subscribe to Netflix but we hardly ever watch it anymore. Wonder if there are others like us out there??"
"I just wanna say, now and the coming hard times in the market are not the time to be panicking, stressing and selling. view this as an opportunity to work hard at your jobs and earn as much money as possible to invest in every company you believe in at heavily discounted prices. you will be thankful down the road, you will be much wealthier than selling now. try not to take this on negatively, this is a chance that doesn't come often. yes I'm down 30% off my high point, and in time I hope to look back to this time and realize that the real money was made working hard and investing in this bear market"
Looking perfect for a gap up tomorrow
Very positive price action for longs
Upgrade is coming
"Tomorrow, barring any poor market conditions, I think this tests 376. If it finds support there, next stop is 390, and probably in a hurry. If I am right or wrong, I still love how she moves"
Look at max and 5 year chart... Last 2 years market almost flat yet Netflix up over 200%. Sorry but odds are dropping to around 220.
It’s going to be good if it breaks 515$
Nobody is going to cancel there Netflix. Only source of entertainment at home. It will be the LAST thing people drop. Skip 1-2 meals over the whole month or cancel my Netflix? Hmmmm. And who could afford to sign up for Disney and keep their Netflix account. Wow a while $16 a month. Those people must be rich LOL GO NFLX
NFLX's loudest detractors continue to be the ones who fear owning it. They will fear buying it at 300 and 200 because the valuation will still be too high for them.Every great company that has ever irreversibly changed the world has stumbled along the way. NFLX will have another stellar quarter eventually and to those burying it today will watch from the sidelines again.
Gravy train is over on reduced expenses. When is the dilution to pay for massive production costs coming?
Will recover after lunch
the only people that made money overnight are option sellers by selling covered calls lol
This just in... Biden thinks he is running for Senate again???
"This will go over $400 , now a days DISH is not doing good due to that everyone is streaming"
"In the early morning, institutional investors started taking profit and selling slowly. They keep retail investors holding so they can sell high. The selling will accelerate near closing today and continue tomorrow early morning"
"If we open between 3 and 4 in green, good chance we reach 10+ today"
There is no other branded streaming service like Netflix. They are so ahead than others in this field.
And then 390 coming
"Congrats to all longs for your patience and strong belief. You won, at least for today. And kudos to NFLX! Hopefully tomorrow will continue to be a Green Day for all tech stocks!"
Will bottom around $370...
Stay well away....
Why now?
"get out , NOW......charts say 174 by Dev 15"
You get 10 twtr shares for 1 share of nflx. Nflx seems to have run it's course.
After lunch boom boom green
"Wall Street can get all excited about a substantial price increase, but as a user I'm not paying anymore than I'm currently paying for the service. This means I will stop using Netflix, and sign up with Amazon or others. There's a lot of competition. I'm not the only one quitting Netflix, I spoke with about 25 people in our company who agree with me. I don't own Netflix as a stock."
Might we see 580 tomorrow?
Yesterday's sugar high wearing off. As expected.
Lots of immature folks on here. You can make money either way on this one depending on how good you trade. I'm out. Good luck to everyone.
"we called for 50% drop in last earning season,Expect another 50% drop with this earning quarter to target of $175."
Canceled it today. I’m a light user of Netflix and it’s just not worth it anymore. There’s a handful of DVDs that I wouldn’t mind watching and a handful of streams that I wouldn’t mind watching. But there’s not enough of either to justify the price increase. It's enough for me to use https://torrentsites.com/
"BUY BUY @307 and below! Otherwise, HOLD HOLD"
This is a joke after a stellar ER! Disgustin! :/
No one has commented on Netflix raising their rates and “adding” subscribers van losing them. Money straight to the bottom line!
Will this be over 329 tomorrow in pre-market ? Or just a 1 day technical bounce ?
"Correction typically means 10% down. Both Nasdaq and Dow were down more than that. So the correction cycle is over. Its rally time. My heart goes out to people who sold on Monday and this morning. Millions of people sold out cheap. Now they will be jumping back in due to ""being left out"" factor."
"Netflix just said in call that in 2020, the plan is to take over the earth.."
How is the one-year target still $400?
"Interesting, with the company hiring Susan rice, many will cancel their service, many don't like her from the Obama administration.Enjoy this ride for now next month will be different!"
"Uh, stock did not blow up like a stock ALWAYS does if it’s as bad as our sleazy board bashers claim. It traded down but, did not collapse further from the open.Netflix lives. Prepare for Son of Netflix, Haters—-"
200 likely to be tested !https://finance.yahoo.com/news/netflix-subscriber-addition-beats-expectations-210531986.html
surprised its not up 10% with earning rep coming on Tues
EPS $1.9 shame
Bears  are sleeping 
I wish I have gut to short more but I don't and against my principle as well. I think I am exiting too fast twice now. Last time I exit fast and sell off bring this down to 240. It was sad as I exit with lot of loss. This time I am again exiting very fast but this time making solid profit atleast.Moving average Trend line seems broken or all most broken and that only going to bring technical sell off now.Start of month and End of month complete contrasting. At start of month it was back by solid technical buy and now complete opposite.
"Netflix(5 year, GAAP) VS. INDUSTRY 58.20%Revenue Growth (TTM) 26.74%Disney only wishes :-)"
They play with there earnings. they write there costs as assets.
DOJ is appealing ATT-Warner Bros merjer! T is down 1% in AH. This should be a good sign for NFLX tomorrow. Thoughts?
"If i were running apple i would have bought Netflix in March 2009.. but then again, whoever is running their original content division is masterful and might not have been as successful under Apple control."
"Look at the future trend of social development, find the right to hold firmly $AMZN $WIMI $NFLX"
MKM upgrades
Should land around $370 after earnings today.
"$380 by day end, $405 week end"
Get on board before the train leaves the station again.
Netflix is the best of the streaming services. I have all three and Netflix is the easiest to navigate and use. Amazon seems to rent everything and Hulu has commercials. They will do well. But those unbelievers can always put a stop loss in the account just in case the worst happens.
You guys noticed all pro-NFLX articles these past 72 hours on Yahoo Finance's front page?
if things are so great why isn’t it up more
"Just had to buy some Dec 11 495 Puts....NFLX floundering, no longer a FOMO stock."
This is a 600$ stock! Go!
buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy
Yes we got one oscar
I can't add enough. Technicals are BULLISH TIMES 100
Down just a percent; got to see the open tomorrow
"Analyst Actions: Morgan Stanley Adjusts Netflix PT to $650 From $640, Maintains Overweight RatingBY MT Newswires— 10:49 AM ET 12/21/2020"
Guys how u will trade Nflx tmr if earning positive tonight !
"Started to accumulate this baby since it was $75. It's been a fabulous ride ~ . It's a great company with great products, having seen how it evolved over the years. Will continue to accumulate as NFLX expands its global business with new regional contents."
so much for a run up at closing
7 min to open.... Let the game start.
"same story after Q3 2018, Netflix stock immediately plunged 20% in 2 weekshttps://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/17/netflix-surges-in-premarket-trade-amid-price-target-increases.html"
They need to report 7.2M subscriber adds for Q2 and guide for 6.5M adds in Q3 for the rally to continue.
Fundamentals and technicals lining up. First target 700 early next year and then 1000 by year end. After disrupting film and TV industry they won’t wallow in their glory. They will finish the job and take over. Perfect rounding bottom on the 6 month chart.
An amazon prime membership which includes prime video is cheaper and provides superior value. I dropped Netflix for this reason.
My company just reimbursed me 5k for my tuition. I’m thinking of putting it all in 400 September calls. Just worried that the stock has next earnings baked in.
$440 this week!
where all the shortys?!? Early Weekend???
275 soon enough Keep shorting
"Michael Pachter, Wedbush analyst on CNBC just now -- OUCH!Said ""Netflix has competition coming that they have NEVER dreamed of""OH SNAP ... just wait until those two pull their content also, lol"
holiday profit taking this week to go holiday shopping???? It could be that simple.
Nflx is a well- managed company that has a single focus that is its expertise and dominance. Long term investors win with a company like this.
"If Nasdaq goes back to green today, we are going to see 275 easily on this.."
NETFLIX IS COMING TO RADIO!!! WOW GREAT NEWS!
waiting to load up at 300
"I still do not understand. Netflix owns nothing. Its original contents are not that ""valuable"". It is just a streaming service!!! Soon (most likely now) the other company will start gang up on Netflix. Once they will stop feeding contents to Netflix, it is the end of Netflix!!!"
"As a top analyst I rate this stock overweight, strong buy, with a bullish outlook. — Goldman Snacks"
"Just out of curiosity, if someone upgrades does that mean people tend to buy on their thoughts? What if someone else downgrade the same stock, would y’all all sell? Wouldn’t you want to do some research for yourself on if it’s valued or not before investing on your own then someone else’s word? Just trying to figure this crazy market thing out. Thanks. Good luck to all with whatever positions you have."
$275.00 fair value...Fiona
I've bought and sold Netflix for years; still have some shares at $29. Now this stock moves like a spinning top and it's liable to go in any direction on good or bad earnings.
All in
i need insight. should i hold i got in at 415? or cut my losses early? i feep it will be 500s by end of year.
200 M subscribers vs. project 201M....is NFLX going to get punished?
Getting ready to buy calls again.There will be one more dips.
black friday sale
The only hypothetical you should be wrestling with right now is “is NFLX” worth 300+ a share?”
"Netflix leads SAG award, with 15 total nods — that’s almost twice as many than the next leading TV platform.https://www.thewrap.com/sag-awards-netflix-ozark-star-is-born-maisel/"
"Up almost 20% in on day on mediocre report and forecast! Unbelievable. When everybody's buying, must be time to sell."
At least we closed above 375.
Even Jim Cramer is calling this a bubble now
Going to braekout 390$ by friday
Im happy i loaded a bit more shares again in the morning.
Begged you to buy this before ER. Said they would beat on subs and stock would rally 5%. This is predictable. Cant understand why everyone didn't do.
"All NFLX movies showing in China through partnership with IQ, IQiyi is the next giant"
"What kind of rigged #$%$ is this They Missed and just have Free subscriptions Latest Earnings Missed Consensus (Q4 ending 12/2020) Next Earnings AnnouncementQ4 Non-GAAP earningsAnnounced January 19, 2021 $1.19 Q4 Consensusof 39 analysts $1.39 Difference fromconsensus -16.64% Q1 Earningswill announce (Unconfirmed) April 19, 2021"
going up of course
"There are a few real bad pumpers on thhis site that people need to be aware of. They will tell you that NFLX has no competition and will rule the streaming world. APPLE has recently announced deals with some powerful hollywood types like Oprah Winfrey, Octavia Spencer, Reese Witherspoon, Jennifer Aniston, Steven Spielberg, Francis Lawrence, Damien Chazelle, M. Night Shyamalan and Kristen Wiig. They will be a major competitor. So will AMZN and DIS. Beware of the paid pumpers on here."
"I can't believe how NFLX is performing this week. Looks like it's trying to get to Goldman Sachs new PT of $490 this month, lol!"
LOOK AT NFLX GO!!!
Apple bails out the markets again! Up we go!
Why so many shorts come out here every time this goes up lol
remember the short sellers and haters at 325. Lol it went back up to 386. I see a recovery before earnings next week and if they meet earnings and subscriber numbers it will hit new highs
$76 tomorrow morning.This stock is rigged.
Last minute buying on all stocks except NFLX. A lot of people believe that the trade deal will be announced over this weekend.
NFLX will not miss. Expect a big numbers. Sorry shorties.
So is subscribers really going to be this good to justify 120x earnings?
Extraction movie amazing. Simultaneously hits USA and Indian market. Genius CEO Hastings. Original content cannot be beaten.
Netflix makes 1 billion in 1 year and stock go up 16billion in day
"A company with 3 billion in cash 5 billion in current liabilities and 10 billion iin long term debt, Will be bankrupt"
"An open farce, content up $1.2B to over $13.3B and amortization. exp up $100M. Try to sell some of that $13.3B content and see what you get. Auditors went along with it when it was small and now they can't backtrack."
EPS $1.19 per share from the $1.38 expected. Revenues of $6.64 billion in the quarter was only modestly better than the $6.62 billionBoth short
be ready for filling the GAP tomorrow! :D
Wow TSLA down 17.58
I told you yesterday. When this is red with string markets...the next day will be a beat down
i do like netflix but it's too expensive...fair value is at 280
"Since March 2020, the US Companies that report earnings, see at least 10% Jump in their stock price, no matter how terrible Earning/Loss report. $NFLX is getting PUMPED again, DESPITE Falling Earnings!"

"Netflix maintain overweight and $643 price target at piper sandlerPiper Sandler analyst Yung Kim says the firm's December quarter ""Netflix Navigator"" search index points to Q4 subscriber growth in-line with consensus for both U.S. and Canada as well as international. The search index analysis suggests Q4 U.S. and Canada subscriber growth of 8.5% year-over-year, versus the consensus at 8.3%, and international growth of 29.1%, versus the consensus at 28.7%. Kim remains comfortable with estimates of 8.7% and 28.7%, respectively, driven by the ongoing stay-at-home environment. Despite increasing competition, Netflix continues to capture a significant share of content consumption dollars, Kim tells investors in a research note. The analyst keeps an Overweight rating on the shares with a $643 price target."
Netflix was going up too much now its time to come down
"I covered now so buy, lol."
5 for 1 Split coming soon
Hmmm... so new subscriptions will not be added in the winter season with Corona spiking?
Could Netflix actually end on a high note today!! No 3pm decline!?! Woohoo!
"Today, Netflix held a long term support zone at $360. This is very bullish sign. Looks like we’re going up this week boys!"
is it too late to join the party?
"Growth intact...""Netflix (NFLX) is showing that it is far from exhausting its overseas growth opportunities as it sets up its first production hub in Europe. The company is setting up its first European production facility in Madrid, which is happening at a time when Netflix has a team working on nearly two dozen original productions across Spain this year with other original projects underway in other markets. Netflix spent $6.0 billion on content acquisitions, including original productions, last year."""
"Buy puts its so easy. It doesn’t even matter what NFLX reports for earnings, we are in a bear market. It WILL go down"
can someone please tell me where the future growth will be coming from. is this an international play? Why would anyone own Netflix over other high growth tech companies? Netflix seems to have much more competition than others and they don't make money.
so glad i didn’t risk $2000 and buy 7 shares lol
We warned u streaming is a classic parabolic bubble and a low margin utility like cable in end $roku
bought a couple 400 sept 21 calls hope it keeps going upany prediction I feel 400 next weekthe big players want this over 400
"Subscribed ESPN+ and it's great. Work very well. Navigation is good.you can watch live games, Some great documentary movies, NFL Draft series and more. ( I think they going to limit 1 game /day but you don't watch more than that)I think this may be helpful to Streaming service like Netflix, it prove there is no technology advantage Netflix has. And Content clearly Disney is still king and with Fox deal going to remain that way.So I am not sure how people think Netflix can handle competition from Disney and Apple and list of other. At Best case scenario, people rotate service. Worst case, people subscriber on Service like ESPN and very limited money left for Service Like Netflix.Think if you have 200M subscriber but only for 3 month out of year that's just 50M subscriber. Netflix might get custom to service rotation as quality streaming service grow."
Shorted 150 at 571
bring the squeeze
Tsla is up 100 points since announcing inclusion in sp500. Nflx is up 0 since announcing us price increase which will be a nice boost to earnings. This was news that stock was waiting for. Yup this market makes perfect sense.
Stating the obvious but this valuation seems very rich. 75 forward PE with Disney entering the market a year out (+ who knows when Amazon will get serious about this space). Seems very risky!
LETS BREAK 400 BY JULY!!!
reading all these people saying it will pop crash and drop means it will sky rocket
"one word: STCN, next 1000%"
Why is this down. No more upgrades ??
an upgrade for Goldman who has been down trending for the last 16 months isnt a great thing...Just saying
Today Netflix had the lowest volume of the past 10 trading sessions. what does that mean?
"This move up, makes zero sense. Need to test $305"
"well well, that looks green"
Netflix valuation is always too low because it is compared to companies with much less growth potential.
"“Apptopia said Disney+ competitors, including Netflix and Amazon.com Inc's Prime Video, remain largely unaffected in terms of their performance during the same period”"
"If we open above 295, look for the high to reach between 303 and 306.....Should not have much of a pull back from there.Good luck to everyone!"
Head & Shoulders pattern just formed in the three months chart.
I don't think I've every been so pleased to be down 5%.
Time to short.
"In 2017 it was up 68.16 for the year.Coming into the day, it was up 75.88 so far this year.Now it's up 70.84....On Jun 20. it was +224.80"
"What happened to 400 few days in AFH? Man, this stock is rigged to crash below 250 in a week"
next stop is 425. on the road to 500!
Shorty Shorts getting toasted. Better cover soon.
hits just keep on cominghttps://variety.com/2019/tv/news/chinatown-prequel-series-netflix-david-fincher-robert-towne-1203408719/
Time to buy?
"There are hundreds of channels to choose from soon to be 1000s. On internet tv. NFLX is just one of those thousands. They are absolutely a doomed company, they don’t have a sustainable pricing model."
"Just bought more at 396, should be easy profit"
Here is goes! Shorties are sweating it.... but we warned them plenty.
570 BY TOMORROW PROMISE U SHORT SQUEEZE
I predict -$10 on early Monday (6/25/18). It went up on speculations and will go down because of lacking fundamental reasons to support current price.
"To quote Chic Anderson, race announcer of the 1973 Belmont Stakes and Triple Crown. Secretariat (Netflix) is ""running like a tremendous machine"". This stock could down in history in a similar way as Big Red."
Who is buying?
The rest of the FANG stock earnings will continue to drive NFLX UP as well as the markets.
is it time to add more shares?
Hey guys. Netflix earnings on Thursday. Supposed to be tough 4Q is Netflix going to best earnings?
Everyone should have bought the dip that went to 490 - this is a guarantee smash after earnings - it will hit 575 easy
I guess NFLX likes higher interest rates. Shows what I know. I thought higher interest rates would put downward pressure on the stock price.
I invested in T. It provides a 7% dividend owns both the pipe and premium content with HBO max and its price is a fraction of Netflix with a p/e of 8 versus Netflix's 56. Sooner or later the market will understand this.
all the $nflx investors are coming for msft
"sold my nflx calls , made nice profit, good luck"
Manafort guilty? Cohen plea deal?Where was this prosecutorial zeal when it came to Hillary Clinton and her illegal bathroom email server or all the obvious global pay-to-play shakedowns by the Clinton Foundation?
Held sideways all day. Wonder how many start the selloff in 10 minutes to lock in profits since it's not going any higher/
"As I said, wait on market down days to get in low 500s. Market in general is going crazy. be careful."
Netflix is priced at a premium to other offerings and investors are concerned that this will inhibit growth as lower costs services gain market share. Netflix needs to ensure it continues to produce quality content to remain a streaming necessity.
"Just think, this thing is climbing and we still have more than a week before earnings."
Above 265 is possible tomorrow and above 270 on Friday.
"don´t short netflix, think many new people in stock casino hobby just have this and apple, same kind of people and they gone get what they want from the market not deserve."
"Midday lull like it always does, rally toward 400+ will begin around 2-2:30."
"Since 2004, Netflix went down but went up higher. Valuation and debts have been the noisy issue but Netflix reached over $700 in 2015 and split 7:1. Guys, trust Netflix and Netflix will not fail."
"Just bought 1,200 Shares at $354.20 let’s go"
look at that trailing PE....114. Ridiculous. So people are buying at these prices hoping that nflx will generate 10x the eps they have right now. Netfflix will make 10x the earnings its making now to bring the pe down to a reasonable 14. Odds are way stacked against that. Just not going to happen

Below 520 by Friday
"The thing about AAPL streaming, they just copied NFLX, but you have to pay more for less. Disney has a 71 billion dollar debt, but I don't know how much is stock transfer, but still it will take years paying that bill off, NFLX looking pretty right now."
"wow.... Goldman just manipulated this stock . They cut the price so that they can buy back with cheap prices..But everybody knows NFLX earning will be huge tomorrow. So, stock will go up again...."
"I just wish, I'd bought more calls towards close."
NFLX has a smaller market cap than TSLA. Does that seem right?
Susan Rice = cancel your Netflix (i just did) and consider shorting now.

Price target just lifted to US$440 :Ohttps://www.zacks.com/stock/news/322785/why-is-netflix-nflx-stock-up-again
"Nflx is a day trade stock; It is not for long term investment. It pays no dividend, high P/e, a lot of competitors and debts. If you want to short, then wait after ER. If you are long, then sell and take profit before ER. A lot of unemployed people, they need to cut back expenses, not adding more expenses on unnecessary as Nflx, DIS. Plenty of free movies on YouTube. Why pay?"
Nice to see this finally having a decent day. Hopefully Amazon will be next. I did sell some more nflx because I just don’t trust the market right now. Will keep a core position.
Agree with GS. This is a $500 stock and way too cheap at this price point.
Barron's has a $118 price targethttps://www.barrons.com/articles/why-netflix-shares-will-plummet-fund-manager-51556731141

Earnings run up starts today. $310 after 4/16.
Nflx having much tougher time over seas ... domestic streaming companies way ahead in China and India.
"Netflix should tank back to the 250-300 range, buying range. It shouldn’t have climbed so high."

I will be Netflix and Chilling all week. :)
quite an over reaction don't ya think......? i'm thinking a very good short play for $10 up tomorrow?
nice recovery. closes virtually unchanged.
"IMO Netflix will not lose eyeball share to anyone new including Disney. Amazon Prime is arguably the closest competitor, Netflix was / is first and everyone else is just me too."
"Someone is working hard to keep our Netflix down . Alas , she will rise today . Too many subs to ignore ."
300 after earnings
There IS NO CONTROLLED selling going on folks... No crash coming... No sell off coming... NFLX is one of the top 3 most widely held securities in 100's of millions of peoples 401k's... Everyone just chill!
Pick your time in a long holder 3 years now at 332 waiting for stock spills and my son to become older then a surprise for him he is 11 now. Lol
Censor and Chief ??? Who said that??
By Friday this will be around 260
Nice run for a second day!

Big news coming heading up up up 500

What is going on with this stock? Great earnings announcement and just keeps going down?
It will be 400 very soon .
Mmm. Thank you longs.
Netflix rules.
"Mark Cuban phoned into CNBC today to give his support to fellow $NFLX shareholders. The billionaire shared that he is still very bullish on the company and has yet to sell any shares despite the slowing domestic growth. Don’t worry, $NFLX longs,"
Tomorrow 325 - 310
"Lot of people says dot com and this rally is different. I agree with them. Back in Dot-com rally was broad cover lot of different companies in bubble territory. This rally focus on few hot names. Now is that good or bad. Very hard to tell but here is my thought.Because people only invest in hot names, Money concentrated into top 50 company in this market mainly. Now let's say $AMZN or $NFLX or $TSLA suddenly find hard to handle. With limited balance sheet they will have hard time meeting obligation and stock can crash big time. If one of such company fail, fear to exit will run. Given most invested in 50 company, Those all exiting into same names as well and what will happen when everyone thinking to exit same time?"
I knew it was going down today.
why would this crash with double average daily volume already sold at 565?
320 next is 330
"On a day of reds, this is green lol. I kinda regret selling half my NFLX shares to buy more Apple and some SQ, or maybe not lol"
"2/7/18- ING BUYS NFLX SHARES-Can there be much more upside in Netflix after a 55% gain in 2017? Apparently yes, as, stranger things have certainly happened. ING has made a tentative investment in the streaming service by buying 4,200 shares in the fourth quarter. Shares have already soared nearly 40% so far in 2018, given a boost by reporting earnings that topped even heightened expectations."
ok looks like it's making a comeback.
Bridgerton.........Top of the top.........Netflix is a hit producer........Be patient with stock price.....Should do well in 2021.......Bullish.
"nflx p/e is still 238 and forward p/e 77....there is still a lot of room to go down. be realistic about this folks, no buying on the dip please, this i way overvalued"
575 WILL COME
"""If everyone is thinking alike, then somebody isn't thinking."" ~George S. Patton"
Wonder if signing pacts with Michelle Wolf and Obama has turned off a segment of viewers that normally would have signed up/stayed with Netflix. Saw the latest promo clip on ICE by Wolf and could see where her political controversies could hurt Netflix subscriber growth with Middle America.
TIMBERRRR the Shorts.
Vaccine is out and now the valuations mean something
WOW!
This stock is like Cisco circa March 2000
"Oh boy, 25 more hours till the beating continues. So excited!! Are there people here still who don’t think this is going back to pre-covid levels?? HahahaShort $NFLX"
"Invest in a company doing the best they’ve ever done with massive growth, at a discount?Or... a company doing the worst they’ve done in decades, at a premium?Hmmm. This ones easy"
New cfo n its huge
Bought Jan 560s call option at $72 and now $30. Do I hold out or is there a better move to get away from investment?
Here comes green 300
CLASSIC shakedown
How many of you here believe that NFLX will go right back to $400 as if the miss means nothing?How many of you believe NFLX will go back down to below $360?
Not enough content worth watching. I get 1 month year. Watch what is necessary then cancel.
I loaded up to my last cent when it was 355 today this morning. Then went down to 354 but there were no money left to buy more. And most of the comment here were like it will go below 300 and like that ... but now I am happy I ignored them all (ALWAYS TRUST YOURSELF)
"When interest payments are only 5% a year and you can grow borrowed money 35% a year it would be a big mistake not to borrow, especially in an emerging streaming market where advantages of scale prevail."
"We've got back $84 from Dec 26.....another $80 and, we're back at $400.00 per share"
The shorts had their day in the sandbox yesterday and had fun. I am so happy for them. Now it will be time for them to start losing money again. With earning season to begin soon and with NFLX reporting in 3 weeks methinks NFLX will be closer to $450 than $350. Let is be said and watch it get done.
"Ive got a good percentage of my portfolio in NFLX. Its been the main stock that has drug it down since last October. If this happens to shoot up even close to my net cost, im dumping it. Ughhh.. My luck though, it will tank after earnings... hope not, we'll see..."
I think people are shifting money from $fb $amzn $aapl $nflx $goog to airlines and entertainment industry like $aal $ual $wynn and etc. this might continue for the rest of the week
Target $1000 !
any positive feedback on this thread?
10am 385.00 here we come
Chances are 75% that NFLX has blow out numbers.
Any thoughts on a split??????? Price way to high for people to buy in
"ATDS could soon be the security software , protecting user information this and many other tech companies... Just saying."
The drama created by NFLX trading before earnings is more entertaining than anything streaming on NFLX.
"if the shorts believed in what they were doing they would short in the morning and walk away from the computer and not look at it all day ,,, but they cant because they just don't know .. get on the right side the long side"
Ha I called this last night when nflx was down 6 bucks.I even called the shrugged off article the day before it was printed..Party  is NOT Over YetParty  is NOT Over Yet16 hours ago$NFLX conversationThey are writing  the Old “Investors shrugged  off the Netflix warning  and it went higher haha Reply31
"The battle to win over viewers online may be reaching new levels of intensity. Comcast’s NBCUniversal is considering the launch of a streaming service that would pay people to watch it.The tentative name for the service is Watch Back and it would feature episodes of TV shows and web series from NBCUniversal’s own TV networks—like NBC, USA and Bravo—as well as those from outside web sites. To entice people to watch, Watch Back viewers would earn points that could be redeemed for gift certificates, according to several people with knowledge of the plans."
"I saw $20 billion in upward gaps within a short period, check it out. Then you see these huge ram it ups. Then you see high speed trading tricks, market orders fills maybe above the ask and bid, hundreds of times. In my honest opinion, it's part of the Ponzi scheme. CMG trades at well over PE = 100, a Mexican restaurant. Doesn't appear to have much growth at all. Dangerous short."
Sold at $248. Great move but this is as good as it gets.
IM NOT COVERING they sold their share holders out could of announced price hike at earnings insider sold 900k worth of shares 2 days ago!!!! look it up!!
"Approaching the infamous critical point, $486.50, again.Obviously she needs to cross that point to reach $511.22."
NBC just announced streaming initiative. Space getting more crowded.
"President Trump should request China to open up its video streaming industry when the US resume trade talks with China. If China agrees, we see 450."
just remember people netflix can swing 40 points easily in one day it can be down 40. next day up 40. easy profits if you buy now.
time to bail
are we finally breaking out?
$498.68 at the moment
Looks like nobody wants to hold it. All good things...

Made a big mistake of buying 1800 shares of this stock at 278 earlier today. Now negative 14k! Hope it gives me a chance to break even tomorrow!
Thank god! Didn't sell my 550 calls.
It is hard to believe that someone is still buying WORTHLESS $NFLX Netflix shares in this MEGA BUBBLE!

WOW .. just one earning ... made a huge difference
Lets do this baby!!!
$500 by year end
God please help the longs
The main reason NFLX growth was down last qtr was because of world cup soccer. time to buy...
Buying opportunity of a lifetime
"NFLX is expanding rapidly in India, whose population is 1.2 billion."
Easy go down easy will go up. If you know about trading it’s all a game
what's the bottom? $350? or this is it?
Netflix reached an all time high at 581.22
Is NFLX being pumped by analysts so their big clients can get out at a decent price?It doesn’t make any sense to upgrade a stock facing negative cash flow + huge debt + rising interest rates + rising competition from other content owners launching their own streaming service
Why nflx is down?
Disney in talks to buy Netflix
Today easy $40.00 pop. This going to run so fast up that the banks aren’t going to have time to get in at a low price. Buy early I LOVE NETFLIX
"Six month base. Analysts missed badly last 3 quarters, nonGAAP was 5% below estimates, then 12, 19%. Why couldn't eps be over $2 Q4 2020?"

The beginning of the fall to sub $100? Me thinks so.
Predictions for tomorrow?I'm thinking close of $395.00
Shorts closing
NFLX still has a little loft left. Up she goes!
Those who bet against NFLX over last 10 years all failed! Period!
I sure wouldn't hold this short or long going into weekly options expire.
"IF YOU MISSED GETTING SEPTEMBER CALLS CHEAPER ON THE LAST DIP, TAKE ADVANTAGE OF TODAY’S PULLBACK. SEPTEMBER CALLS expire 2 months after the next earnings report. Massive upgrades for NFLX! Don’t miss the opportunity "

I'm ashamed to say I'm a democrat."
Curious do people still buy NFLX at these prices? I was going to buy some put options but it is extremely expensive so I guess I am not the only one thinking this is going to drop hard in the next couple of years?
407 for tomorrow sure

wow NFLX decides to stabilize after i buy a 600c
The gains nflx has had this year are great but when you look at where the market and what this has done the last 3 months it’s hard to be pleased. You want your stocks close to their 52 week highs when market is setting new records daily. It appears that large cap tech is suffering the most. It is strange because you see companies like roku crowdstrike google snowflake etc hitting new highs. Then you have companies like amzn nflx zoom which seem to be stuck despite great earnings. Zoom I understand more because of valuation. But then how can you explain snowflake. If snowflake is this high then zoom should be higher. If roku has run 30% in a few weeks then nflx should have seen some reaction along with that. So I just see a lot of disconnects which makes it harder to invest. Definitely been trading more this week. It’s basically a traders market right now and I guess just follow the momentum.
Going over 300 easy tomorrow
LEAKED.... 6 millions subs....
"All,State how many shares you are long or short now ! Don't brag later without disclosure."
"380 is another resistance level, does not beat 380, hope it does it today."
"Netflix will report earnings after close on Monday. Estimates are $0.80. There is concern for the stock price because: 1) P/E is very high 2) it's up over 108% in a year 3) if a competitor like HULU were to be bought by say Direct TV, Netflix would take a big hit 4) nothing goes straight up forever. Even a slight ER miss would sent the stock price tumbling. GLTA"
Great day.
Barclays says going to 245 soon. Nice
Make life simple by GEVO it will be the stock of the year for 2021 should hit 15 after hours tonight!
Why this is going down
why up so much AH?

Looks like we'll see 400+ in the after hours.
Everyday low price... Attention MartMart shoppers.
"Personally , I resigned from Netflix when they announced their deal w the Obama’s family. That family will not get another one of my $ if I can help if."
And as I said heading back to the stratosphere
340 by the eod
"Just because I finally bought Netflix streaming, doesn't mean the price should be up 12%"
interesting. ysterday had the lowest volume since Jan 10.
Up up and away. Nothing can stop the rise of NFLX! If NFLX is unable to borrow they can always float a secondary offering. Think how much content they could create selling shares for more than $400. That would make NFLX worth at least $500!
"This quarter is after price hike, it is going to be blow out! Netflix India is growing faster than analyst imagine."
"Anyone have a clue (news story, etc.) why NFLX has dropped nearly a percent in the few opening minutes of after hours trading?"
Will Netflix beat the earnings??
Here is a good reasonablee article regarding Raymond James belief on the sector. This is a real “expert” and knowledgeable person than the paid pumping by garolou on here. It’s dangerous to listen to paid pumpers. This article is not anti NFLX. It’s positive on NFLX.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-strong-subscriber-growth-hulu-221203720.html
"The ironic thing is that all the Netflix bulls like Rich Greenfield who have been calling on major studios to start showing big films on streaming rather than in theaters means Netflix content will look less attractive up against movies like Wonder Woman which will be on HBO Max or all the movies Disney is now considering putting on Disney plus. I've been saying this for years: Name brand content matters. Netflix needs a bunch of shows and movies that have widespread/breakout appeal like Stranger Things, and finding those shows is not easy. It's also very expensive to create name brand content from scratch when properties like Marvel, DC, Star Wars, etc, have already had decades to gain fans."
Grandpa...why didn't you buy walmart....dad...why didn't you buy Amazon....you son asks yiu...why didn't you buy Netflix. Z
break-out soon
im a buyer at 150
Seeing how Disney has run since it announced streaming focus what do you guys think about att for a trade as it switches over to streaming with times Warner. I know att is kind of a dinosaur but I could see it moving up maybe 15-25% on hype related to this news.
I wonder if Netflix is cooking their books?
You know who's not buying; management!
A $2 across the board increase would result in almost $5B a year in more revenue which could be used to add more content. $5B is more than the content budgets of competitors. That’s the power of scale.
It usually rips higher about 12$ from here...”stocks” & “the Market”. Whatever people
Through normal trading this stock goes to $250. Major correction $125
This stock is looking good for a buy. I will take a small bite tomorrow. I have made good this year so I am going to bet that the FANG stocks will rebound
"Two price target increases already, buyback coming, NFLX to $1000!"
ALL.... bubbles eventually popTXMD 
"trade very high volume, institutional investors are taking profit"
Roku confirmed how much streaming is dominating. And we all know the current King of Streaming. SimilarWeb just updated their data and december was a very big jump with 2.09 Billion web traffic that month. its not the apps just the netflix.com webpage. So if you are going to short this going into earnings its your funeral.
"Very informative piece on CNBC about Netflux and all the competition coming in. They were stating Netflix was always overvalued, however, they had no competition so that helped. Now with all the competition, the valyationncan no longer be justified, their monthly price will probably need to decrease, content costs will now increase and this valuation just isnt sustainable."
"I just sold my 35 shares at $411. I made a profit of about $8,000. Too bad I didn't buy 100 shares or more"
Bear market done straight to new highs
anyone else notice highest open interest PUT contracts expiring tomorrow $550 strike
4 out of 5 shares owned by institutions. They won't be selling. Demand for shares today will far exceed supply. Add to that it has been stuck in channel for 6 months and seems like easy buy. 600 by end of week seems realistic.
"if the world is at war, even more of a reason for people to stay home and watch Netflix."
What's that popping noise?
The ticker looks like it’s gonna explode lol
"Just curious, with Netflix being so heavy with debt, what is the hit to earnings if interest rates start going up (they are already going up)? Not trying to be a shortie here, wondering if anyone has done the math."
Still a bargain
"David Airhorn burnt on Tesla and AMd. Betting against Elon musk, Lisa SU and Reed Hastings is gutsy. Netflix replicating their US success around the world by local content now in 17 languages. yesterday results shows that people around the world spending more on Netflix. Mkt will squeeze aihorn"
NFLX has to close above 330 as shorties fighting hard to keep below

"NFLX puts the ""P"" in parabolic. This stock has not taken a breath since $185. I think it is funds who are buying to fill out positions. They know the stock will drop but are long term. This has got to be a short here."
Why was NFLX up 4% today - great storyhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-netflix-stock-popped-4-233500531.html
Thinking this report is going to be similar to ROKU's announcement 2 weeks of more subscribers. It's Winter/Christmas season and Smart TV's sales were excellent. NFLX will announce more subscriber growth in this report.
So today's plan is to PUMP $NFLX and Nasdaq BUBBLE to new record ABSURD Highs every minute with Falling Earnings...
"People on this board are greedy. NFLX is up 20% on the month. The gains are in. Despite what is likely to be a beat, stock is not ""rocketing"" to $500. May even go down. Increased subs does not address the longer term challenges of increasing competition and capital structure issues. Increased competition may not take subscribers away from NFLX, but it will make it harder to raise subscription prices, and it commits NFLX to massive debt funded content spending. A rise in interest rates will cut the current stock price in half. At these prices the downside risk is getting larger than the upside potential."
Who let the bulls out.
The current decline is just a warning shot to what's coming......this will end up like 1999-2000. NFLX P/E ratio is at almost 300 (very irrational).
Hey @BD it's a green day for Netflix and I still think it's a bad investment due to competition growth and over inflated PE. My opinion has nothing to do with Netflix having a red or green day. I won't touch the stock either way. https://www.forbes.com/sites/ianmorris/2018/05/04/hulus-incredible-growth-is-bad-news-for-netflix/

"Keep the faith longs! The bar to entry for over-the-top streaming is very high. DIS and T are trying to compete late 2019, but will take time to get any momentum going. T has not been able to monetize the assets they already have. DIS will initially be a niche player for a certain demographic, unless they start to produce their own content. Youtube premium maybe showing signs of trouble (placing ads on original content).NFLX is already anticipating the competition in 2019 and is already ahead of the game. They are arguably the best platform for the widest range of multi-screen devices. GLA"
Wow exciting
"Have been in Netflix for over 2 years. There most certainly is no reason to panic, no company can hit expectations 100% o0f the time. I noticed with the quarterly report a drop in revenue, I smell another Netflix price increase this year, 2019 at the latest, as the company tries to increase revenue. They might want to consider reducing spending."

Today we got another upgrade and great news on queen gambit. Now if anything I’d be more likely to want to add shares on this news. Additionally we had unusual options activity on dec 520 calls.

"Another funny thing about the NFLX shorts (we've already covered how whiny they are) is how born-yesterday they are. They don't seem to have the slightest idea that when AMZN was 300 then 400 then 600 their message board was full of posts about ""High PE"" this and ""no business model"" that and ""can't justify"" and ""bubble"" and...anyway, it's 1750 now. NFLX may or may not do the same- obviously it has so far- but you can tell that the shorts have no idea the different ways something can go. It's like they all started trading the day they shorted NFLX."

"Netflix Inc.'s (NFLX) 12-month price target was increased to $245 from $230 at MKM Partners on Thursday. MKM analyst Rob Sanderson raised his subscriber outlook for Netflix for 2018, saying the company has yet to reach its peak year for total subscriber additions. ""We continue to view Netflix as the large cap with the most potential for market cap appreciation over the next three to four years,"" Sanderson wrote in a note to investors. Sanderson said he expects Netflix to add 20.6 million subscribers next year, which is roughly in line with FactSet consensus of 20.9 million, but would be down from 2017 consensus of 22.0 million subscriber additions. This year was expected to be the streaming service's peak for subscriber additions, but Sanderson said it's more likely to come in 2019 or 2020. ""We think Netflix has a large first mover advantage, expecting to spend $7 billion to $8 billion next year, far more than any other programmer,"" Sanderson wrote."

"The companies being the hardest hit these days are those with lots of debt. NFLX is a DEBT LADEN company with negative free cash flow of over $3.0 billion. Stated debt on balance sheet is $15.0 BILLION. There is an additional $5.0 BILLION disclosed in the debt footnote in their filings. And there is an additional $10+ billion in debt like contingencies which didn't qualify to be consolidated on he balance sheet. So we have $30 Billion in debt just there for a company which stays alive each year by borrowing but credit markets are now closed. Netflix does not make any more money just because people watch more. In fact, they make loss as it increases their streaming costs to serve up the content. Maybe facts don't matter with a cult stock-but everything I said is a fact which is in their most recent 10K."

"DO YOU HAVE YOUR {GSAT} 5 g satellite calls yet? I certainly hope so rookies, CIIC CCIV calls and shares!NKLA 2022 leaps! HYLN calls. FUTURE WORLD FWDG just .0003 but not for long!"
Shorties are sweating it now with this upward pressure.
"Think of google+ trying to topple Facebook, orkut vs Facebook. Bing vs google. Just because a strong competitor is stepping into the streaming space doesn’t mean bad news for the top players. Netflix will keep growing and eventually get far too high than any other streaming service."
"NFLX is among top 3 growth stocks: you cannot get better stock than NFLX.Go with it, not like novice ...!"
"We are going much higher than ""three fifty"" this week."
"Let me tell you all something. NFLX is a good company. you want to buy it by all mean buy it. by the next year this time, it could be $600 a share or could be $100 a share. A company that gains or losses 30 billion $ in market cap in one week, is not an investment, is more of a gambling. Up until now, not much competitions for Netflix, but other companies now getting more serious or increase their exposures in this area, such as Amazon, Apple, Disney, AT&T, Hulu. With the current evaluations that Netflix has, it better be no competitions around. There is no room for errors. Don't just think because it dropped from $400+ to $360, now is a burgain. Once the trend breaks, the down fall is fast and furious"
Buy any weakness:Target $1000!
Netflix rocks good job
Just imagine how many funds have NFLX in their current holdings. And you think they will allow it to fall??? Come on guys! Let’s get real here.
"Plenty of studies on it, too....Mathematically, one has a far better chance to make money in stocks by taking long positions....Shorting stocks has a far less success rate...And, I have seen very little in terms of acumen and ability on stock message boards by people who claim that they are short a stock...."
sorry after hours $488
I am disappointed that Netflix has decided to base its business decisions on political issues. I did not join Netflix to have my position on Abortion either challenged or confirmed.
Wall Street sticking it to small investor Again.
"Okay, so Disney and Apple are out with their streaming game plan, let the streaming game begin. If it was a 100 yard dash, NFLX is waiting at 50 yard for Apple and Disney to catch up!!"
will open green
What a come back 
"There's really no reason or logic to be found concerning this stock valuation. It's basically an alternate version of the crypto bubble where people just keep on based based on the fear of missing out. As long as they do, it keeps going up, which leads to others trying to catch the train while it's still going up the hill. There's really no way to analyze how far this irrational investing can take this stock. It could go to 400+ by the end of the month because ""reasons"" or it could crash and burn back down to $150. My verdict: Don't go long OR short. Stay away."
"IMDb, the film and TV website owned by Amazon, is launching a free streaming video channel that will be available in the U.S. on its website and Amazon Fire TV devices, the company announced Thursday. Unlike streaming services like Netflix and Prime Video, IMDb Freedive does not require a subscription, and is instead supported by ads, according to a press release.The streaming space is getting increasingly crowded as even legacy media players like Disney have announced plans to create their own services. Apple, AT&T and others are also planning to launch streaming video services this year. But IMDb's ad-based model could make it attractive to consumers"
4M new sub from China is very dubious. I came from the country and I never knew Nflx is hot there. And not so many people can watch English streaming program if there is no subtitle
"Sorry guys, I was one of the people who canceled my subscription. Better luck next quarter."
End of day run coming...

pop after earning
"nasdaq bull take it higher, take it higer"
GREEN!
Hello there. The markets are shaky right now and a crash could be imminent. Do you know where to put your cash? go to (http://Pick-stocks.com).
Don't try to find a bottom as it is much lower than this. Keeps making a new low...
"Potential for earnings per share in 5 years at subscription maturity is about $10 per share. At that time market will value Netflix like Apple around 20 times earnings. So, in 5 years your investment in Netflix will mature to about $200 per share. GREAT INVESTMENT in you are buying at $340!"
@MR What strike price on April 18 calls would you take?
Another over priced turd to short into the dirt.
"After the bell: Indiewire ""In 2020, Netflix reported its biggest viewing figures ever for a December, and, during this past year’s holiday season, the biggest Christmas week — December 25 through December 31 — ever. These latest stats, as shared by the streamer with IndieWire, are measured both by total viewing hours and average viewing hours per subscriber across each period."""
Its GONNA pop after earnings and i'm pretty sure we GONNA see 350 by next friday
I think we'll see $405 in the after hours.
The best in the world
"Hedgies want you to buy, they need someone to sell too."
420 todayalso Netflix will hit $420
GS price target 495-announced this evening.
The future is in free streaming with advertising. How well will NFLX make the transformation? People talk about them risings price... things get cheaper in todays tech era. Apple showed us increasing the price of the same product can be the kiss of death. Then you hear about the overseas growth and growth in general. All growth is priced in at this point. Also many weak retail investors buying what they know....the type the that run when they see shares sinking
"I like Netflix and Roku and $WIMI, they always do well, more and more people are using their products."
Selloff likely related to options expiration on Friday. I bet we see 52-week highs this week.
its about original content and Netflix better keep pumping compelling must see stuff which will cost a lot of money
netflix beat the street by 73 cents a share. Way cool. Subscriptions up 1.7m.
Why is it still above $340 if the report was that bad???
"This is ridiculous. Price targets well past the $600's. Netflix stock should be going much higher, virus or not."
I need to celebrate tonight
"The very definition of a BUBBLE, is a Disconnect of a Stock trading with correlation to it's P/E Ratio, but of course We don't value Stocks that way anymore, nor by Book Value or Debt to Cash, or Revenue, or any other Traditional Metric."
Delete your app and don’t look at it until next year.
Now price target hikes will come in next 2 weeks. it is going 650+. Hold it.
"Don't frequent this board much. I'm only 21. I do have 100 shares of AMZN my dad put in my UGMA account. Not bad for someone my age. At least I won't be working at Hooters. I don't know Tilly but, I know he's arrogant. I also know that NFLX is about ready to close above its 200 day moving average which could be very good."
I just traded some FB for NFLX yesterday. Not too sure I'm making the right move...thoughts?
Netflix will take a hit for hiring Obama....Why did they do that? I just cancelled my subscription.
"Five day losing streak ends! Only the 6th green day in 17 this month.The way it was going, I was sure it was going to end red.For the 1st time in 8 days, the previous high is surpassed.We have now gone 12 days without the high reaching 10. Still can not hold a lead. High was +7.43 today. I guess any green day, is a good day.See how it goes tomorrow...."
"FB will take the market with it tomorrow. Bubble has peaked, only down from here. First slowly then a steep slide. Margin debt is all time high at $600B. Margin calls will doom this market once we have even 3-4% slide."
"Susan Rice appointed a member of the board? Not surprised as NFLX is just another left-leaning company. In fact, I could care less if it wasn't for Benghazi. But I now care, and I am cancelling."
"Appointing Rice and signing the Obamas was for one reason - international subscriber growth. In order to realize its heady targets, NFLX must penetrate and be the top one or two streaming services in a large percentage of countries. IMO, Hastings apparently feels Trump damages American prestige, and in turn, NFLX prospects. So he is using the dynamic duo (Obama/Rice) to assuage the world and ensure NFLX can succeed in these countries.The fact that NFLX would be willing to take the risk of angering 1/2 of the USA in order to build int'l bridges for NFLX tells me that Hastings and co. are desperate for the subscriber growth that will only happen if the world embraces NFLX. This is not a good sign.So, my thoughts have evolved on this. Sure, Hastings is a Lib, has a vehicle for spreading the message, and can use the dynamic duo to do so. But he did this for business, not political reasons. I believe his reasoning is not sound, and demonstrates the challenges the company faces."
mid 200s by late March
RED and more RED
"Relax, the whole market is green today, it will fall back to $350 this week"
to the moon we go
Party is OVER.
What? Did you think it would just keep going back up. Market wants to see 330 before we see ath again so get ready.
Some gains will be taken next week (new tax year) and this should push price lower.
if it didn't drop at the last half hour before the bell it will not drop at all today... road to 600
Obama not happy with this actionHe will have zombie Joe sign an executive order to boost the stock price
I will have 800 short as my 3 360 call will exercised (Assuming it get exercised). My average now stand 353 for those. Loved this rally. Going to help me make thousands more eventually.
fantastic results
"Wow, that Barron's piece spells doom for Debflix. Need to track down the full report from that fund manager."
Buy this is the real deal buy it now
"Again, good buy in low 500s in market down days"
"Folks boycotted Nflx, there are too many better choices out there without the crazy politics tied to it"
yay 1st month free means user count LOL
I apologize for buying nflx. I'm pretty sure that's why it went down.
350+ tomorrow
"if market goes up tomorrow. 11,202 open contract at 600 and 5,193 at 620..... should pop and then drop"
"A lot of air under this one, drops could get dramatic."
"Well, only a big tech is able to show this kinda growth during a crisis...it is time to stop bashing faangs!"
