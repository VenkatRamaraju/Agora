Recent headlines and conversations for NFLX
"Who bought Netflix last summer didn’t earn anything .. Tesla, Moderna, Banks, Cruises, Riteil, Air, everything has grown by 100-200-300% ... everything you need to know about this dump"
Looks strong.May explode tomorrow.Worth a shot: buy calls.
Got in at $287 and I’m not getting out. Netflix is gold; it will bounce right back up.
I carry a 50% open % gain on Netflix! Why would I panic over a -2.25% one day drop! Let's have this same discussion in 3 years!
New movie Staring the Kap and directed by Susan Rice and the Obamas....
LETSSS GOOO GREEN
seems like this should be a great trade for tomorrows swings based off financials..
shorts must have just seen The Haunting of Hill House
"I love a good sale, got more at $490 AHAnd another bid in at $485 if I’m lucky.I know a guy who has ten family members using his account around the world, it’s ridiculous; when Netflix tackles that problem we will see subscriber numbers rise globally, pps will follow."
Not more than 300. SLOWING BIG TIME !! HULU killing
I didn’t buy those options but I can see why someone did. This has no business under $520. Even on that good news and stay at home run up this couldn’t hold $490. Roku up another 3%. Zoom and peloton 5-6%. It’s like that across the board. This should have popped at least 2-3%.
320 next is 330
NFLX rejoins IBD 50 again today==Bullish!!See you $450!
WHY DOES IT FALL APART FOR KNOW REASON!
I still don't get it.....people will over-pay for the hye....
"just waiting, I know it will rise!"
"HEY SHORTS, YOU SHOULD COVER before $650-$700. And IF NFLX WAS TO ANNOUNCE A STOCK SPLIT, THE PRICE WILL GO A LOT HIGHER. CAREFUL."

"2/7/18- ING BUYS NFLX SHARES-Can there be much more upside in Netflix after a 55% gain in 2017? Apparently yes, as, stranger things have certainly happened. ING has made a tentative investment in the streaming service by buying 4,200 shares in the fourth quarter. Shares have already soared nearly 40% so far in 2018, given a boost by reporting earnings that topped even heightened expectations."
I'm sure this dip had nothing to do with investors being worried that Disney will dominate the streaming market. I'm sure yesterday was just a coincidence. Right.
"UBS , I LOVE IT !! EXACTLY LIKE LAST WEEK!! WE WILL OPEN AT 335 AND CLOSE AT 349!!"
Congrats to everyone that played earnings :)
How much are they going to spend next year?Negative cash flow again?
netflix will have steller quarters until vaccine is deployed which will be 6-12 months.

I dumped Netflix after the kiddie porn series. Haven't regretted since.
"If I have prime, Hulu, Disney, Netflix, att, Apple. One of em gots to go."
"The thing is everyone is out with streaming services HBO, NBC, CBS, Disney with Marvel, ABC, ESPN, Amazon, Apple, and YouTube. This is bound to happen. As people will leave one service for few months watch show on platform and move to another. I do that, it saves money, and I get to watch all my shows"
"give it a rest shorts, going up with good volume, today close 406-410. Friday 450. ws loves nflx"
"Watching a show on Netflix called The Queen’s Gambit. Have watched Stranger Things, the Marvel comics, etc. Shorts who say NFLX shows aren’t good and that Disney is going to own them need to get a clue. Shorts will get destroyed by this stock. It may not have moved much lately but that’s highly abnormal. Go ahead dislike this but you know I speak the truth. I’ve gotten filthy rich as a long predating multiple stock splits. All you shorts have by comparison is pocket change. Give me more of your money so I can get richer."
Up in pre-market. 
Thinking of getting back into NFLX I have been out for a while now but seems like a good time to average back in over the next few months.
350 today?
i think this stock will go beyond $500.00
sry nflx longs but disney+ is better choice
This thing can climb unless Trump speaks or puts out a tweet. If we can that buffoon's mouth shut NFLX may do ok today
"Hits keep on coming: ""Netflix Takes Worldwide Rights To Cannes Winners ‘Atlantics’ & ‘I Lost My Body’ ""https://deadline.com/2019/05/netflix-cannes-film-festival-winners-atlantics-i-lost-my-body-1202622388/"
Netflix market cap passes Disney again. Could be for good this time.
So wonderful see you on the moon after earnings.
Yahoo Finance Live has an analyst on now discussing NFLX results and raised his target price to 480
A heavy Correction is imminent!US Stocks are INSANELY OVERVALUED and OVERBOUGHT!The Valuations are impossible to justify! The US Stock indexes must fall by 65-70% to come down reasonable valuations.$TSLA $NFLX
If you guys think it's over priced now. Price is all relative to supply. NFLX leader again.
I'm cancelling my NFLX sub to offset my short losses. I should be back to even by year 3020.
If they can grow to 200m subscribers they can spend more money on shows and movies then all the cable channels combined.
"As people shelter at home, our hope is that we can help make that experience more bearable byproviding a diverse range of high quality content for our members. While our productions are largelypaused around the world, we benefit from a large pipeline of content that was either complete andready for launch or in post-production when filming stopped."
"every year this happens - everybody hates NFLX and then when it drops to below 260; people back up to truck to a run to 360+. it is all gibberish about the other streaming stuff; NFLX thrives on its own content and competition from other services will have no impact on the growth of NFLX. people are not going to give up or take dis, hulu, etc. over NFLX. they will simply be additions to NFLX. This stock is about to be a screaming buy opportunity very very soon."
Disney is a way too confidant to think it's content is so good that they will be able to grow streaming subscribers without having to spend like Netflix. They have another thing coming to them. Time will reveal they had it all as a Netflix partner but greed got the better of them.
"I think this will go back up, prob a good opportunity to buy at the dip."
Stimulus cheques will influence this stock. The gloom and doom sentiment due the the coronavirus will spur many to indulge in escapism. The increased global roll out will be a factor in earnings potential. A good stock to buy and hold for the long haul.
"Nflx is a single product, very high P/E Ratio, overpriced, lots of competitors. I don't understand why someone bought at $440"
is it time to add more shares?
I should have so at 385 and took some of what I lost back in because this does not look like a good sign falling back under 370. Now it will probably struggle to stay above that.
"Wells Fargo-- makes ""SMART"" investment in NETFLIX--Wells Fargo & Company MN grew its position in Netflix by 22.5% during the 4th quarter. Wells Fargo & Company MN now owns 1,934,754 shares of the Internet television network’s stock worth $371,396,000 after purchasing an additional 354,801 shares during the period."
$345 after earnings next Monday.
Hahaha
Green again. Even captain James T Kirk has a hard time keeping up with this speed.
A big misconception is Netflix got big because they never had serious competition. Hulu (Disney Comcast) along with Amazon had to be serious competition for tiny Netflix back when. It only makes sense being the major media company it is today Netflix competition has to be weaker than ever. It will be confirmed when the stock rises to 1000 next year.
This is the best place for stock market news. Everyone is always correct about everything.

FB & NFLX both do business in worldwide markets. FB has 2.3 billion users and NFLX has 130 million.NFLX has lots more opportunity to grow from here. It's up to MGMT to get back on track and resume executing.
"I will also predict NFLX will be $110 or less in 6 months time no Free Memberships means nobody to get suckered into giving up their credit card info and then forgetting about it just auto pay never looking at all the charges , well that will mean a lot less money coming into NFLX with all the played out material ."

"take your profits and put them into ROKU, ROKU is the wave of the future.Reed Hastings did not have the same vision for NFLX that Anthony Wood had so they parted waves and Anthony started ROKU and ROKU is about to explode.But do your own due diligence but do it quick ROKU reports earnings on Thursday."

"This stock has been a total dud for me. Ive owned it for a while now, and even picked up more recently. The market cap IMO is a little too low. Im not sure whats keeping it down, but Ill wait..."
So tell me who’s earnings came out FB or NFLX yesterday?

It's expensive now. I see a buy around 350
"Over 5 million subscribers added....the world is not ending for Netflix. Next best company with content, subscriber count, and streaming contracts is 10 years behind. Sell now and regret it later....long and strong."
On a recession people watch more movies at home. This stock will eventually go up
Zero upside to the stock market. At least 30% overvalued

HBO Max > Netflix. Netflix has kinda been bad for awhile now.

Shorts need to cover ASAP...you got 15 minutes and the countdown starts.
funny. all the people on this board who say they know what is going to happen. they dont't.
we should see $16 upside tomorrow.
I thought Netflix was all about original content because that's what people watch the most and that's what gives them the most bang for the buck? Didn't they supposedly let Disney content go willingly and Friends and The Office and everything else because they know that original content is a better investment for them and is far superior to any licensed content? Why would they spend hundreds of millions of dollars on an old sitcom like Seinfeld that won't even start streaming on Netflix for another two years?
Netflix stock is a washing machine
here we go!
"If you are a shareholder, you can sell covered calls at any strike price for any time frame depending on your cash flow needs, risk tolerance and time horizon.If stock is taken; so what!You made 20%. At close, NFLX Jan 20 $400 calls sold for $88 tax deferred cash per share This is a stres free way of investing."

"Unlike Prime, Netflix started charging $3 more for 4K service several months ago along with other increases. It hasn't affected user numbers. When coupled with international numbers, this quarter should be a bonanza. It will be years before Disney and Apple make any inroads into this still growing industry. Netflix has the infrastructure in place."
patience is key.. Netflix will reach $500. No one else has a brand like them and content like them . Overall great company and is very profitable and is expanding rapidly internationally. Long Netflix.

Many people actually subscribed to every platform
Hmmm... so new subscriptions will not be added in the winter season with Corona spiking?
All time high erning is it going to 430
Huge gap @ 508
So I️ need honest opinions will Netflix rise in the after hours? Experts only
If they beat next quarter then the tone on this board will change instantly.

Why such a huge drop today? Do people really not like the new netflix films?
"run up to earnings is pretty neutral, and we've been consolidating for a long time. could see a big swing up or down.long term I'll be bullish until something huge changes"
"I was thinking, since NFLX offers one month free, Q1 Revenue wouldn't be affected?"
Chart looking bad.....not even a dead cat bounce over the last 3 trading days.
"Be careful, shorts. This has fallen too far, too fast, coming off positive 3Q results and 4Q guidance. I've seen it too many times with this stock. When everybody thinks the run is over, the upward momentum comes back with a vengeance. Don't get greedy. Enjoy the gains you made on your short trades over the last week and get out."

"Let's go ahead and split this thing now, 4:1"
I want to see $508 being tested today.
"BUT, how about the incoming competition from original content provider, such as Disney+, the monopoly time of NFLX is near end. furthermore, last year's subscription growth has maxed out 90% of subscribers. It will be almost no growth or recessed growth for next two years! I am SHORTING until it approve itself"
"subscribers in India are paying 200 rupees per, so about $3 USD per month"
"Netflix will not be able to continue a $13 subscription at this point. A Disney and Apple combo will be favored in my opinion. I wonder what the first cut will be.. $10, $8, or a match at $6."
this is getting interesting!
"Not too late , get in"
Should be green today unless expectations were way out of whack. The subscription numbers were fantastic.
"ROKU looks like the better long term investment, so much more content on with ROKU, both subs and ad supported. ROKU has been working like a beast day and night to measure, predict and place ads. ROKU also doesn't have the burden on 10 billion dollars on content creation, which NFLX has proved time and time again they are not very good at creating content, except for Stranger Things which is AMAZING. The ROKU platform proposition gets more amazing everyday as ad revenue drive down the cost of streamer and ROKU tvs. Hope NFLX hits the 7 million subs next quarter and then some."
free Disney for a year on Verizon for Verizon customers
"You guys know, this isn't about Netflix not having good content, It's about not growing like expected. They missed q2 numbers, for the first time they lost subs in the US. This is before even competition, Netflix just reached their plateau. The people that want it already have it. Those people will stick with it even through competition. The issue is it will be tough to grow from here now with competition and the US market pretty much covered. Think, how much really improved since q2?"
Disney stock nearing all-time highs while Netflix is floundering. A market correction reveals which media companies have passed the test of time and are the real deal; not some flash in the pan.
I laugh at this stock price every time I see it. I like Netflicks but ATT and Disney are going to crush them! Netflicks is borrowing more money than the y make to produce quality shows which makes them technically unprofitable. They will never turn a profit until that can significantly raise their monthly fee. I suspect the6 are going to soon see a significant drop off of there new subscribers which will be the end of there stock valuation. Tic toc remember AOL etc
"I begged you longs to sell last week, saying this was headed to $320. I hope a few listened. My short is doing great. Still more pain to come. If you have a massive gain still on your long and are comfortable holding long term and able to ride this down another $20 or so, then hold on, otherwise get out."
"Sell in this small fake rally......markets are going through a controlled correction. Before you know it the air will come out of NFLX.....$350 and below coming. Current stock price is unsustainable.....P/E ratio of 270 is toxic. Yes, AMZN has a P/E of 200 and that's also not good. Look at AAPL P/E ratio 18....ideal P/E ratio."
The thing I can never understand is why people who make HUGE gains over a year keep holding a stock. You simply buy it back when it takes a dump LIKE ALL STOCKS. even apple
Disney has reached over 10M subscriptions since yesterday. That's why the drop.
"$NFLX $WIMI $ZM $NVDA Fade out style, adhere to the configuration, play to the advantages of active management and fade out some kind of simple style selection, comprehensive judgment enterprise the present relationship between value and price, the relationship between the future growth and value, choose good enough good long-term investment of enterprise, is to be able to get beyond a certain style of ""single"" returns, and create excess returns in the long run."
"Seriously does this stock go up everyday how about a multiple of 1000 or 2000 hey maybe a pe of 10,000 would work"
"If the streets are paved with gold at Netflix, they shouldn't need to dilute the stock to raise cash for the creation of new content."
Honestly if I watch an hour or two of television a day it is on Netflix. I get to watch whatever I want when I want it is that simple. My kids go crazy if I turn on Direct TV Now because they don't get why there are only certain shows on at any given time. Netflix could double its rates tomorrow and I would still keep the subscription and I'm probably not the only one.
‘Netflix earns most Academy Award nominations in a year where diversity shines !”
only 2 dollars increase. a starbuks basic cofee is more expensive than that. i am more than willing to pay that for all the original content plus amazing documentaries they have.

Netflix will be a 1600 stock in 3 years. All Netflix has to show is it can grow subs to 200 mil.

Low today was $346.41....and it’s trading at $340 right now??? What happened??? I thought shorts said below $300 after hours???
This has been pretty firmly stuck in a range since July of last year. I thought it was gonna test $600 before ER but at this point it seems to be a coin flip. It could go past $550 again or it could go to $470-$480 and make you prove how much you believe in the stock before heading into ER in a month. The market is such a mind #$%$
360 today.
fund managers will say anything to manipulate on this board. just stay long look at history before split and multiply ×7. splits make us forget previous movement. longs are fine.

I can't add enough. Technicals are BULLISH TIMES 100
Will be shorting soon with options NFLX because of T's new unlimited cell plan with free HBO MAX because customers that switch to T's new cell service can drop NFLX and save even more money. we will see how big a hit NFLX takes after 3 months and the next earnings report.
Those $500 puts are going to pay a lot of premium

"Year Of Birth: 1994Year Of Demise: 2007Ceo: Jim BarksdaleFounded By: Jim Clark & Marc AndreessenIt's not hyperbole to say Netscape was one of the most important companies in the history of the Internet. The computer services company is credited with developing JavaScript and had an incredibly rewarding IPO as its stock soared from $28 to more than $75 on the first day of trading. At its peak, Netscape Navigator's market share was over 90-percent. November 24, 1998 would prove to be the turning point in the company's history as AOL announced it would acquire Netscape for over $4 billion. Some saw it simply as a play by AOL to unshackle itself from Microsoft (AOL's browser was based on Internet Explorer). Updates began to slow and the browser began to shed users. By 2003, Time Warner had disbanded Netscape, laid-off the programmers, and removed the logo from its building."
Switch over and buy IQ on its dip
Netflix Sellers should abandon the stock market!
The FANG stocks will continue to thrive in this economic environment
"Daybreak looks like a Netflix hit, maybe better than Stranger Things. Looks like a new revenue stream with all the Product Placements. Who needs commercials. Forgot a commercial so people never see because they go to get a snack. Netflix visionary product placement will always be seen. In reruns also. Colgate, Gatorade, etc. NEW REVENUE STREAM"
"When NFLX didn’t meet expectations in Jan, the stock went sky rocket. This time it met expectations best revenue, it went down. Any thoughts why? Holding 50 shares @ 525 in my bag."
"Today seemed to be a very coordinated assault on Netflix and pumping Disney. To the more experience investors, this was a yawn. So I hope you took full advantage to add to shares into the weakness earlier."
All gains gone. Downgrades coming! Strong sell point charts is showing
"BOA JUST RAISED TO 460$ AND MAINTAINS A BUY RATING, WE HITTING 420$ TODAY BOYS!"
This stock will pull back a few dollars. Why wouldn't it? Many people will take profit. HOWEVER one of the best stock to own. Re-entry $310-$315
"Disney+ at $6.99 is a shocker price they hope no one will actually take, we don't know what it is for, restricted content, only 1 screen, low quality... what will the cost of higher memberships? will they have off-line access? ... I think it is a positive for NFLX Disney is saying ""we're cheap"" people don't equate that with quality..."
Going to 50 - 70
Very strong earning and stock drop? This stock will fly like a rocket in a week.
I bet Amazon or Apple is buying it

What’s everyone thinking how this could go
"Streaming is the future for a long time. The pie/market share will continue to expand and isn’t limited at all. Competitors welcome, won’t matter. Should be $400 as of today."
I find it funny that people are posting on here as if today’s price action indicates something regarding Netflix. Most of the market is getting hit today. This stock isn’t immune. But it’s a great buying opportunity.
"All dust settled down, going up from here , good luck"
"wow, this is unbearable"
"To all of you who think NFLX is gonna be “cut in half by end of year”, could you please short the stock? Thank you!"
Volume is much higher than yesterday. Going to be an accumulation or distribution day. Can it stay green?

Buying in around 300. Let’s go!
It will achieve $580 today.

"Let me see if i can get lucky at the end again. Bought 40 @ 336,57."

buy now. friend told me they beat earnings report.
"Volume is only average. This is the attempt to get that last squeeze out of shorts. FAANG is going the way of another high flier (TLSA), and this is a last gasp pump before the hedge funds exit the long and begin going short. Note that NFLX is still $40 short of last May's high."
"If you want to buy the dip, here’s your chance. This stock is still a long term winner. Who cares about estimates.....they still ADDED 5Mill + subs and beat on earnings. The stock settles at 340 and slowly makes it way back to 400 in a few weeks."
Everyone should have bought the dip that went to 490 - this is a guarantee smash after earnings - it will hit 575 easy
"Another classic comment by investment guru ""Presifdsdsf""4 days ago$NFLX conversation""Guys I'm trying to not be emotional and be objective. I am holding onto a 60k loss. What should I do?"""
Get in before next week.
I would say it’s a safe argument to suggest there was massive insider trading going on last week with knowledge of the debt offering. I’m not blaming NFLX but have little doubt many involved in this issuance warned others. Criminal Wall Street at work.
"So they guided lower when they increase 13% of the monthly sub cost? It makes no sense! Except the growth is slow down! Also, study shows people are canceling their membership when Netflix increases prices."
475 by Friday
"For the big boys and girls every $ matters. Why do you think analysts went ""bearish"" 2 day before the company's (clearly anticipated) best quarter, yet. This will be at least 15-20% up by closing bell on Friday, you don't need a PhD to see this coming."

Price target still $500
NFLX to 500+ before next earnings complimented by Covid-19 and Dave Chappelle's viral mini NETFLIX show.

Mind blowing subscribes data
Buy as much as you can
They probably added 9 million subscribers.
I’ve never been so proud to see this stock crash and burn. Yes it will recover but I absolutely hate their agenda and their lack of innovation this is a good wake up call for the company
Going to test 350$ tomorrow for sure!
this could be the last trip ever on the peak of the moutain...but ...you know....this is the frockin nflx.So ...do your best - I have a lot of puts

Congrats
Down another 15percent by end of week
i’m very confident that earnings will surprise us in a positive way as demand from imposed lockdowns has been steadily increasing over the past 3-4 months.
Will hit $550 next week I’ll guarantee it
Cash flow positive in 2021 and 8.5 million adds. Wow !
whats a better buy Apple or NFLX i am confused
NFLX priced to perfection. Any miss or even not beating expectations is going to be a huge drop.
wouldnt buy puts. this will run next few weeks ATH incoming
will be 270 by end of tomorrow
"NFLX funding new content with debt. Interest rates go up, NFLX stock price goes..."
Missing guidance from 5 million to 2.7 million subscribers. I’m actually surprised it’s not down a lot more. That’s a 45% miss.

I been up all night shaking and sweating. I own 10 shares of this. What do I do now?
Fair Value $20
"My two centsnet neutrality will matter eventually and matter in a big way, because as someone said on Bloomberg, 1/2 of the bandwidth on the internet is Netflix. That may or may not be true, if it is even half true, its a big deal, prices go up to NFLX, margins get squeezedand even before this change NFLX was 3 times too high at least, I'm seeing 130 for nowhowever, manipulation might take it higher due to the tax thing, though they don't make money, so it shouldn't, but it mightbe careful shorting, use pieces and stops and eventually you will make a killing, I thinktrade the chart, though, instead of gambling, because of the potential for manipulation. Ive seen that a lot of times. The effect isn't here yet, they are still messing with it. They can use it to kill shorts, the hedge funds I mean.But eventually, and obviously, the cost comes to NFLX that is already heavily debt burdened. And the fox disney thing is a big negative as well as disney doing streaming along with google with youtube and others, competition in that market doesn't sit stillnow go look at the PE. I trades so thin that big money needs to get out, while they can, so it could crash. There is a recession coming as well."
Why doesn't Netflix just buy out all the competition once and for all and dominate as one we don't need all these other guys just one
There is a reason Netflix is shooting up guys . I’ll leave it to you to find out . But I’m very bullish for earnings and think this should see 400.
Netflix should charge only $10.95 a year.
Afternoon recovery
just bought more. i like buying on sale.....when others panic.
Thank you Netflix for dragging down everyone else 
What’s the reason for fall? Is it related with the company? Or broader sell off in the market?
"An overhyped ""growth"" stock going DOWN??? Obviously the Fed can't have this. I'm sure it will start buying shares of NFLX first thing in the morning."

"Another nice little after hours bump. This is good a good upward trend leading into tomorrow.For all those who bought yesterday, good news:Best Day of the Week to Buy Stock: MondayIt's called the Monday Effect. For decades, the stock market has had a tendency to drop on Mondays, on average. Some studies, as in ""A Survey of the Monday Effect Literature"" by Glenn N. Pettengill in the Quarterly Journal of Business and Economics (2003), have attributed this to a large amount of bad news that is often released over the weekend. Others point to investors' gloomy mood at having to go back to work, which is especially evident during the early hours of Monday trading. July is traditional one of the best months of the year for S&P returns..... so with the momentum moving forward and earnings looking solid, I think all us longs are in for a real treat the next few weeks."

Netflix movie contents are superb compared to kid stuff from other streamers
El Camino was good and the Irishman coming up .... NFLX going back to 300s
Netflix has the best content hands down. I think they should find growth in the new movie experience post COVID. Whether it’s some type of hardware or what not. But I believe in the long term prospects of the company. They have the most experience in streaming and will survive the war.
"Netflix rumored to buy Viacom/cbs with its 27 nillion revenue. Netflix market cap /revenue is 11 compared to 0.48 for Viacom/CBS. PE netflix is 70 while Viac/cbs is 5. Netflix doubles revenue in first year, and highly accretive to eps. Netflix gets huge 77 year old tv and movie library plus live network CBS for a bargain."

TIME TO SWITCH TO A REAL EARNER LIKE NVIDIA
The $nflx shares are like a spring the more you push it down the more it will pop. I am 100% bullish about this security good for all investors who loaded this in discount.
"Stocks to watch tomorrow NFLX, YY, SQ and PANW"
You can see how the shorts are shivering on this board by reading their messages
Shorts burning
Rev. $6.64 billion versus $6.63 billion and expected Earnings per share: $1.19 versus $1.36 expected
They had some interesting insights about NFLX on (http://Multistockalerts.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
I took my profits from $185 at $385 in after hours and shorted. I'm covering NOW.

High today should be at least $351....
$10.50 green tomorrow
added to my short
Analysts will be raising earnings and revenue estimates. Momentum investors will take this to 1000 by years end.
These numbers prove they are executing their strategy effectively.
Regardless what u feel about apples showtime it can't be good for netflix
CIDM is a way better streaming play
I love Netflix. Covered my shorts yesterday. just short again today
Nothing's changed since yesterday...scared money still don't make no money. Z
Looking At $400
This is absurd. Stock price was higher than this weeks prior to earnings.
Shorts hahahahahaha
A $2 across the board increase would result in almost $5B a year in more revenue which could be used to add more content. $5B is more than the content budgets of competitors. That’s the power of scale.
"Total after hour transactions were just 7117 (https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/nflx/after-hours). Some people were panicking at the news of 22 million Disney+ mobile app download (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-walt-disney-streaming/disney-mobile-app-records-22-million-downloads-since-launch-apptopia-idUSKBN1YF25I).In the same article it also mentioned that Disney+ competitors, including Netflix and Amazon.com Inc’s Prime Video, remain largely unaffected in terms of their performance during the same period. It backs up the unaffected statement by adding data as:While users in the United States spent about 200 million hours on the Disney+ app during the first four weeks of its launch, Netflix users have spent about 1 billion hours during the same period, according to Apptopia."
It’s coming. Hopefully they split 10-1 like they did July 2015 7-1
"No password sharing, licensing revenue. Hastings will find a way to keep growing 25%."
Who’s buying tomorrow!
Wow. Keep breaking new low of the day. I am speechless. People are still selling despite the facts with upgrade and new target price. What can u do. I can only sit and wait now.
one question.... where were these experts when it was jumping up 70%?.... experts have hind sight.... no foresight...
"Did anyone notice what happened Afterhours? Some money managers dropped the stock based on subscriber growth, which is funny plot in the letter to shareholders. Then smart money kicked in at 488, and didn’t stop until 502 with more or less constant slope. I sold 10 calls at 510, to hedge downside for about 7%. Have good cash for morning market open."
$285 end of week

"Most the shares are held by institutions, funds, ....If the MM's want to take it up before earnings they probably can and those not directly involved in the manipulation can stay back and watch it go up. It can go up a huge amount fast. Watch their upgrades and postings. They might say something to the effect that NFLX doubled their subscriptions etc., or say it in a way it can't be refuted, like ""NFLX COULD double their US subscriptions"" . It's their tactic and free ride to jump the price up in the premarket and to turn on the BOTS. Retail shorts are right to think it deserves to go lower, but it might not.I was short and covered. I'm playing it very careful. No body knows what its going to do, except maybe the MM's. The price appears to be set for 4 years from now. I read an article that said the same thing. But don't get fixated on value before an earnings report when most of the shares are owned and controlled by the MMs.Just my two cents. Mondays can be crazy. The MM""s can put together a plan to take it to the moon to sell it off before earnings."
NFLX will soon be deflated......P/E ~270 and negative cash flow (not a good recipe during markets correction).
"support at $265.75 soa intra day sell off will happen soon, netflix at $273"
hey where all the longs at?
"A historic day! The high of 26.60 was the highest on a non-earnings day and the 4th highest ever. The close of 26.37 was the 2nd highest ever on a non-earnings day. April 17 of last year it was closed 28.28 in the green.Good way to end the Friday slump.7 day unbeaten streak. +63.69 during it. On Dec. 26, it reached a low of 231.23 and has bee running since then.Highest point since 298.72 on Dec. 3, Best close since 303.47 on Nov. 9The 10.68 open was the 10th best ever and highest since Oct. 31Dec. 26 it closed +19.79. Next day it, closed up 1.90, but it got down 13.57 before it started the comeback.Good luck to everyone next week!"
Should I hold or sell this stock? Shouldn't have jump in with the new movie news. I let my emotion took control of my trade.
This is going up for sure
"Just remember a couple of things. Netflix has hired the best people to make their own owned content.A lot of people feel that Netflix will be beholden to others content. Maybe their prices will go up, or maybe these content holders will see the audience (subscribers) increase so much they want their content on Netflix and the prices for these content holders and may not try to push their weight on Netflix and lose a large viewing public around the world. Just a thought. By the way, there are other companies that would love to have a Netflix of their own but it would cost billions to do it.Maybe Netflix could be a target if the price is right. If it happens then Disney is the one I'd bet on. They already have a great relationship with Netflix. To me that would be a marriage from heaven."
"100 dollar stock pumped with Fed printing money, simple. If the fed take the training wheels off, this stock will be in 90s at the best. #$%$"

"Subliminal ads should drive future of NFLX........If I was part of management,I would deeply dig in that area....If it is not already the case...."
Guy that shorted 300 at 520 is definitely gonna regret it 
Well I was WRONG. It popped nicely on the announcement but gave back all of it as I type. I was in for a fairly large position from $323 and sold all at $440 here in after hours. Obviously happy but not as much as I would have been if they didn't miss EPS (as new subscribers doubled expectations). I'll look to trade NFLX again before Q2 earnings as I still believe this stock will go above $500 but will probably base in the low $400s first.Wishing everyone the best as NFLX will be a WINNER while the pandemic remains and probably even afterwards as they're leaders in the streaming business (by far)!!!
"Lot of people here betting we will have 8m/9m or even 10m new subscriber. They miss very important thing one of bull analyst point out. He use it as bull case that still market can bigger. I am using as bear case. I think stock will go down if around or below 6M (Meet or slight miss/beat company projection). Many think growth only go hyper based on history but problem is it already 119M. Some analyst even point out that only 600M in world (X china) have broadband and So that is 20% of overall world market share. If you add account sharing (50% likely) that's 30% of entire world. I think growth will slow regardless of Disney and Apple streaming success. If they are very successful, We may have negative growth even.Growth get harder as it go higher. Sure Recent T-Mobile and cable provider free with order reduced sharing and bring some growth in USA and rest of world market , could be reason for 4Q beat and even 1Q. (I call it trojan horse because once subs custom for free Netflix, When they discontinue result going to be mix of discontinue netflix v/s service who provide free netflix. They will use weapon at worst time then Other have more hit than netflix.)"
I cant wait for earnings! these next few weeks are going to be great... new ATH soon!
"You can safely predict NFLX will need to raise another $2-$4 billion in the second half of the year, perhaps even more. Whether it's going to be through debt offering (most likely) or a secondary stock issuance, neither is going to be good for the stock price. It looks like NFLX is going to top $20 billion in debt in a couple of years and they won't be able to sell the pie in the sky anymore without showing positive cash flow. It's just an accounting trick that allows them to amortize the cost of creating content that shows an accounting profit, which can be manipulated to make analysts happy. The cash flow on the other hand does not lie and tells a very different story. Watch out, NFLX is an extremely risky stock and has all the pie-in-the-sky expectations priced in and none of the risk."
"Not a big fan of ""Cuties,"" but I like the buying opportunity. The cancellations aren't a threat per Yahoo Finance: ""Still, ...the cancellations should not have much of a lasting impact on Netflix’s overall subscriber base. The platform has well over 182 million users worldwide and is the clear leader in the competitive streaming space—regardless of its recent controversies."" https://finance.yahoo.com/news/netflix-cancellations-surge-following-cuties-controversy-data-shows-114312558.html"
mid 200s by late March
"NETFLIX & APPLE RAISING PRICE ON ITS PRODUCTS & SERVICES. Netflix is raising its U.S. prices by 13 percent to 18 percent, its biggest increase since the company launched its video streaming service 12 years ago.Its most popular plan will see the largest hike, to $13 per month from $11. That option offers high-definition streaming on up to two different internet-connected devices simultaneously. Even at the higher price, that plan is still a few dollars cheaper than HBO, whose streaming service charges $15 per month.The extra cash will help to pay for Netflix's huge investment in original shows and films and finance the heavy debt it has assumed to ward off rivals such as Amazon, Disney and AT&T.While subscribers may bemoan a bigger monthly bill Wall Street cheered, sending shares up more than 6 percent in midday trading.This marks the fourth time that Netflix has raised its U.S. prices; the last hike came in late 2017 . But this is the first time that higher prices will hit all 58 million U.S. subscribers, the number Netflix reported at the end of September."
but will be 430+ before ER??? who with me??
"Bought AH yesterday, and rewarded today as I expected."
"The Los Gatos, California-based company posted revenue of $4.19 billion, falling short of estimates of $4.21 billion for the quarter. The company reported diluted earnings of 30 cents per share; however, it is not immediately clear whether this is directly comparable to the 24 cents expected by analysts.The company also said it foresees fiscal first quarter revenue of $4.49 billion, lower than the expected $4.6 billion."
"PE 200+ in an inflated stock market, nowhere to go but down"
Netflix new hollywood. See you at 550.
"The Warnermedia and Discovery merger is definitely a disturbance but IMO NFLX will still do well regardless. Betting against streaming stocks for the long haul is akin to those who bet back in the late 1800s that light bulbs wouldn't replace oil lamps. NFLX will be a force to be reckoned with even with competition. Despite the subscriber miss last quarter, DIS had the same problem. New subscribers may have been light this quarter, but what nobody pays attention to was that the retention rate was over 90 percent. That's why I'm not dumping any of my NFLX or DIS shares. These stocks will be much higher in a few years than the current prices unless of course there are stock splits."
"Read my previous update. Compare this with Goldman just put out. Goldman Sachs added Netflix to its ""conviction buy"" list, calling it ""one of the best risk/reward propositions in the Internet sector."" Goldman also said, ""We continue to believe Netflix's investment in content, technology and distribution will continue to drive subscriber growth well above consensus expectations both in the U.S. and internationally."""

load up on puts tomorrow morning. 305 will be the high
"It seems the stock has hit a wall bcoz obviosly the next phase of subscriber growth is clearly not coming from US. I dont see how it appreciates significantly from here unless they go for a bold acquisition, buy a movie studio maybe ?"
"I think a forward P/E of 40 is reasonable for a growth stock like $NFLX. That would put the stock at about $230, but I will be generous and say it should be around $250"
no moat netflix
This market is making the Dot.com boom look sane...
"All the wailing about negative cash flow. I think it's going to be just over $2B this year and that's double last year. Who cares? This thing goes up $5B in market cap in one day on no news at all. It's up $36B just in the first few weeks of the year. If they need a bil or two, they could issue a tiny number of share and never even notice it."

The whole market is about to crash. You have already been seeing it in the small and mid caps.
"about competi""In our view, the likely outcome from the launch of these new services will be to accelerate the shift from linear TV to on demand consumption of entertainment.

"This is all bs, someone big or some big people needed Netflix to go down. I’m surprised that user growth is even still talked about when it comes to their earnings, they do not need more users anymore, there are hardly any left in the world who want it, everyone who’s gonna get it has it, it’s a true dynasty and it’s not going anywhere. Growth at this point comes from profit, and idk how the heck they are doing it but they are growing year over year. No ones talking about their money, just the users, when the moneys there, very very there. Netflix could give a hoot what everyone’s doing about what the news is making their stock become. It doesn’t matter. It’s manipulation at its finest. They’ve gotten a bunch of people to be scared of Netflix decline so it has declined."
Hopefully yesterday proved to be a good BUY opportunity.
just thinking about - what if they had beat on subscriber count? It would have been over 450 today. Cord-cutting is real..Netflix will be the big player no matter what
"this company is corrupt. the way they make money is by raising rates on continuous basis. Folks would start cutting soon. I started with a subscription at $4, and it is now over $20."
"Suntrupgrades Netflix, buy on the dip because of India opportunity"
Feels gut
"When stock drops this much, whose continuing to buy the stock? NFLX is overvalued at this multiples, fair value is $180 because there are not too much subscribers left to sign up for it. Sorry to say this, but"
will close above 500 todaysuffered long enough
"Tom switched up, papes hands i guess... he is a shareholder of the pump and dump stock viacomcbs... Tragic!"
"NFLX is unstoppable, will be 400 within a month....get on board, there is still time."
Netflix has an extremely high P/E for a mature company. And with all the competition. They are having to spend more for their originals to keep the interest.
Those who bet against NFLX over last 10 years all failed! Period!

Netflix shares are trading lower despite the company reporting strong Q1 results. Analysts at multiple firms also downgraded the stock. The company said it expects membership growth to decelerate as home confinement ends.

"NFLX is still WAY too high, Per Jim Cramer. needs to come down to be a buy, closer to 200 dollars. Nobody in there right mind is touching it here with this market performing the way it is. I WOULD SELL HERE take some profits and buy it back at 200"
"Netflix maintain Buy with $700 price target at Wells FargoWells says investors should take advantage of any pullback in Netflix sharesCommenting on Netflix's quarterly results, Wells Fargo analyst Steven Cahall argues that while net adds are softer in the first half of the year, ""this is truly no longer just a net add story."" He sees any negative earnings reaction as exactly the sort of pullback that long-term investors can take advantage of. Cahall has an Overweight rating and a price target of $700 on the shares."

"$200 ? No, thanks  ... I can buy much better stock...Netflix will crash very soon... Be happy "
Wait till the market settles and see this fly.
Netflix should learn not to give highly optimistic guidance. It comes back to bite.
Looks like Netflix is gonna get an influx of Apple stock money parked its way.
"what would you suggest, I bought 225 shares at 325, after 20 shares at 307, after 55 at 297, so I have 300 shares at average price 318.

eventually. there won’t be enough people subscribing every quarter and more people will be unsubscribing. so this stock can’t keep going higher based off subscriptions every quarter. and they can’t keep radish from prices. this stock is doomed for failure. great company though.

"Well technically today was NOT a good day for short term bears, myself included!! Two intradays in a roll of higher lows and today a higher high. RSIs improved slightly to mid higher lower 40s to mid 40s so the buyers are coming in. The 9 and 14 day stochastic got better but still in oversold territory! With 3 weeks left on my Nov 170 puts, I may have to pull the ripcord tomorrow as my time premium is slowly rotting away. I'm still a believer that the technicals indicate a downtrend with near term support at $252. The fundamentals for NFLX remain the same which are NOT GOOD ... burning thru cash, issuing more debt to pay for content and operational costs (aka, crazy salaries, $500M for Seinfeld! Seriously??!!), competition is coming from AAPL and DIS which are cash rich and can outlast NFLX, negative cash flow cannot continue at this pace, NFLX may win the awards BUT cash is the name of the game here in the long run, US subs supporting foreign subs, how much longer can that go on. Good luck to all the shorts out there but in the short run, as myself, I may have to eat the loss and roll into further out dated puts to make up for this loss!!"
Should I buy net shares before earnings come out? first thing in morning? or wait for earnings.

"What luck. Haven't bought any NFLX since my initial purchase years ago, and then bought a few shares to round out my speculative stock exposure yesterday. Next day 4% up. Not selling for decades, but still nice to see."
netflix to launch dozens of african american films and eight more african american sitcoms this year. This will surely bring the stock back up.
US growth has stopped. India subscription price is peanuts and you can count on 50 people or more sharing the same account. Non-stop and accelerating cash burn by borrowing. Strong competitions are on the horizon. Losing popular contents. Nose bleed valuation priced for perfection and high growth. SHORT IT!!!!
Raising price will resulyt in a massive loss of customers. This is also a political outit
"NFLX just signed with Nickelodeon. Great strategy to fight back against Disney. 10 million subs on day one is impressive, but they are giving the service away for free to VZ customers & others. So that data isn't all it's cracked up to be."
"After NFLX reported multiple analysts upgraded NFLX from a hold to buy, no additional sell ratings were added. 1 additional strong buy was added. While the yahoo shorts open up positions here analysts have only gotten more bullish. I wonder who knows more, the professional analysts or these clueless yahoo bears. You all are stepping in front of a moving train. Good luck you’re going to need it. I have never made money listening to yahoo users."
"I don't understand why some people think that it's easy to build a stable streaming service in scale, with cutting edge UX, and interesting content.I'm not saying that Disney and Apple won't do it, just that it takes time to be good at something new, and it's not reasonable to underestimate Netflix's experience. Till now Disney & Apple showed us only high level plans in the streaming area. Let's check again the stocks once they release their first buggy versions, or update their pricing after dealing with real costs.Keep your Netflix stocks. The bad sentiment will be turned once the real products reach to the market with their challenges."
"Why Netflix was sold -12% on a very good report. And for the time being it is below. Whereas Disney + recently showed a very bad report! A huge shortfall according to the forecasts of subscribers and fell by only -3%. Disney has grown by 50% in the last six months, they have closed parks and huge losses .. But investors have bought from. And Netflix only sells .. This is idiocy .."
Fair value $450
"How many times people have seen it in the past AH may just be the way to steal your shares. People who holds NFLX should know it’s a trick. By opening, this stock will turn Green. The company did not lose $$. It’s a matter of fact, they are doing better than the last quarter. Street expectations are too high. Nflx yet reported billions in revenue."

The problem with NFLX is they are no longer a trend setter. Streaming has caught up with them They do not own the secret sauce and others such as Disney will rapidly fill the entertainment void with a vast library of rich content. None of the media giants can deliver new content like Disney. The only thing slowing Disney is their leadership as they slowly embrace streaming.
Listen closely...Price targets are meaningless. Determining fair value on a price tag via retail investors and traders are just based on what everyone is willing to pay for that equity. Cult following here WILL weaken soon. That’s a guarantee! This IS extremely overvalued at these price tags. Take it fwiw...VA
So tempted to get more here.
Weird. Rarely do I feel so good about a stock that loses 21 points in a day.
"The bottom line is this company is losing lots of money, growth is slowing, competition from big boys and insiders selling. This stock could be cut in half quickly. Look at the Balance Sheet. They are going to need to raise capital or issue more debt. Do your own DD but based on metrics I look at, this is ready for freefall!!"
"If NFLX announces a stock split, $600 will be taken out."
will be at 450 after earnings.
"$400 coming up next few weeks, look at a chart"
"Between the huge cash burn, 20B of unamortized content cost on the Balance sheet, competition brewing from so many areas, slowing growth in US and now taking a hard political stand in GA related to Abortion, this company is all over the place and just doesnt bode well for the future. The company is way overvalued and so many other better opportunities out there. Just think, when people are talking about FAANG lately, Netflix is really not getting mentioned as much. Once analysts start to come out and question valuation, this could fall very fast!"
"I suppose NFLX is a bubble:1. The company has strong negative operating cash flow2. Its revenue on subscriptions is questionable - my private yahoo address is rarely used, but the whole February I received proposal to continue its subscription with fake name and 4 numbers of credit card, I never used for my address. 1&2 could explain the difference between operating cash flow and revenue, am I right?P.S. I'm slightly short in NFLX"
Can’t wait to buy some cheap puts today
Poll. Will NFLX Break over high by weeks end?
The reality in this country is starting to set in on what was voted in. The markets will start collapsing and correcting very soon. According to my charts I'm looking for a 5000 point drop in the Dow and a 2500 point drop in the NASDAQ within the next six months.
hope it keeps going up. waited too long to get in and did at 400. need to recoup

How can they miss revenue guidance with increased prices and increased sub growth. Makes no sense. Something fishy here. It’s a sell.
Lots of folks still stuck in using old models to think about new companies. TSLA is a good example of why old models don't work. AMZN took years to turn profitable. NFLX is no exception. Can't use what worked for GE on the new economy. Plus GE is half dead in case you are not following the news.
Never underestimate the best

THEY SOLD THEIR SHARE HOLDERS OUT WITH GOOD NEWS BEFORE EARNINGS. SO DIRTY I WOULD NEVER TRUST THEM AGAIN
"The ‘Streaming wars’ is actually going to be a ‘Streaming coexistence’. The supposedly war is really not going to happen until many years from now when pricing becomes a factor when people make streaming choices. Right now the price point for all the streaming service combine is still 1/4 the price of basic cable in not so distant past and people are still getting multiple streaming services. What investors should watch for is who is the top 2 streaming services as those will be the decisions people will make when pricing becomes a factor in the future. I don’t see Amazon as one of them as they have a completely unique business model where people sign up for prime not for the movies but for the free shipping. The top 3 I see will be Netflix followed by Disney/Hulu and maybe Apple but I still have my doubts with Apple. Netflix is unique among all streaming service because they are the only one who is international. Over time due to their international push, Netflix content will be unique on its own compared to the rest and that unique ecosystem will benefit Netflix. In the meantime the rest of the competition is still building their subscriber base at a loss until they hit critical mass for profitability and investors will stay away until that engine starts running. The double whammy for Netflix competitors are many, they will have to operate at a loss for years until they reach a certain subscriber numbers. They will have to cannibalize from their other profitable business to fund their streaming ambitions and this will go on for years. They will have downward pressure from stocks for years to come until they reach profitability (so they are really losing a lot more money than realize). Once they get there now they have to think of international expansion, so we will not see this for at least 5 years and in the meantime starting in 2019 Netflix will concentrate on tweaking their infrastructure for efficiency further capturing market as we are seeing now with pushing for $4.99 fee for India. We will see many more of these ‘tweaks’ all over the world which will translate to more subscribers for Netflix"
"Serious question for both long and short. The earnings metrics are showing a significant slowdown across multiple sectors. With the local and global economy cooling, what's a reasonable P/E to give to companies like NFLX? When we figure that out, we'll be able to see where the stock will go."
pretty soon $400
nflx announcing 1 to 3 split at earnings.
"Disney starting streaming service by end of this year, Good competition to prime and netflix with even lower subscription prices"
NFLX is down because nothing is ever good ever NOFLX
"OK, my two best shows in 2019 is as follows: ROMA and Sex Education. Of course ROMA is not in english but it is a fabulous movie. I do hope they dub it in the future. Please Netflix!!The reason I say this is because many viewers are missing out on a fabulous movie because you need closed caption to watch it. I'm used to CC but I do miss some of the great reactions from the great cast."
"With Netflix releasing original series and movies on what appears to be a daily basis the fear of competitors, who can’t release 10% of that amount of content, is a way overdone. I would even go as far to say it’s all hype driven by news outlets owned by the media companies."
has anyone heard of. livx. provides live videos of events. Bought some because stock pick service I use recommended.
Recently sold all my Netflix shares because this stock can correct all the way to 150; this period reminds me of 1999 where stocks like Cisco and sun Microsystems disappeared and investors lost 90 percent of their money
"Up 14 of 16 trading days this year. Up $34, which is a 36.1% increase. Market cap has increased $30 billion in those 16 days. Really the only significant news in that time was that they beat on subs by just 1.93 million (they met on rev and EPS). That's a $15.5 million market cap increase for each new subscriber. Wow!!! This is just amazing."
Like I said yesterday...expect more selling.

so nflx cant grow much now so they are asking users to sign up for more accounts they don't need...gg nflx.
Bullish on Netflix again. All streaming platforms have been launched and accepted by the consumer market which is still unwaveringly loyal to the Netflix platform and content. They still have the pricing power and pretty soon can bump sub another dollar without losing anyone
NFLX reached a new All Time High at 366.64
15.77 million new subscribers. that's the key.
Investors worried Disney streaming will slow Netflix's subscriber growth. It won't have any impact. The extra profit they make by not paying Disney licensing fees will be reinvested to produce original content which is what's driving subscriber growth.
"When companies like Bloom Energy with negative earnings and negative revenue growth has 4X the YTD stock price growth as Netflix, you know someone's cooking bubbles."
NFLX down to earth soon! Back to $100 when recession hits. NFLX first to go from household expenses.
I just sold and shorted at 395. Seems to want to go lower.
Bounce back could be severe !

Gleefully adding to my short position on the S&P 500 with every bogus market rally. Zero upside to the overall market.
"How is a single ""TV channel"" with 1/5 of the revenue and 1/20 of the profit be worth 90% of Disney? Is al this hype really about content? That is absurd, and while Netflix is a fine company, it is way overvalued. If it is all about content then Disney should be 5X the market cap of Netflix. Disney has a TV channel, plus they produce blockbuster films, they own Marvel, Star Wars (Lucas Films), Pixar, ABC and ESPN (additional channels that produce their own content); plus Disney has real assets - namely two theme parks that throw off billions in profits annually and the real estate itself is valued at $3-4 billion. But business is not all about content. That is just moronic hype. Business is about making money, period. Disney has multiple streams of income and much of it is all integrated. Make a princess movie that makes $100-300 million in profit, sell gobs of profitable toys and costumes of said princess along with other profitable royalties, then charge families $400 so their daughter can dress up like the princess and eat chicken tenders with her in a castle in Orlando. Netflix has none of those highly profitable additional income streams. Any media company could easily start competing with Netflix just by streaming their content. Netflix doesn't own the pipe to its customers like Comcast who sells content and high-speed internet over the same cable, two income streams. Amazon does what Netflix does but its service costs less and you get free 2-day shipping on just about anything you order. Netflix is absolutely overvalued and I think will trade below $100 within 2-3 years. It may have peaked recently and the options market definitely is bearish on this stock. CBO market is not always right in the short-term, but often has a pretty good read on the overall prospects for a companies future stock price."
So Let me get the bears argument straight- if we remain closed with recession people will drop Netflix subscriptions to save money for 1 meal..but if we reopen they still drop the Netflix subscription because of competition..they want it both ways can’t happen and never worked for them
Has anyone noticed HULU is slowly adding a lot of original content? My guess is they are going to only ramp this up further. Pair that with on demand network broadcast series. Yes NFLX has more original content at the moment. I wouldn't count out more converters over to HULU.
"There are a few real bad pumpers on thhis site that people need to be aware of. They will tell you that NFLX has no competition and will rule the streaming world. APPLE has recently announced deals with some powerful hollywood types like Oprah Winfrey, Octavia Spencer, Reese Witherspoon, Jennifer Aniston, Steven Spielberg, Francis Lawrence, Damien Chazelle, M. Night Shyamalan and Kristen Wiig. They will be a major competitor. So will AMZN and DIS. Beware of the paid pumpers on here."

What percentage of people on here making negative comments also subscribe to Netflix??
"There we go. Now we get a glimpse into the power of scale in streaming. Because of production delays Netflix says it will spend $17 billion on content this year, about the same as last year. Revenue est. for this year is $30 billion up 19% as a result of subscriber adds and a price increase. Earnings est. are $10.40 up a whopping 71%. At some point in the future Netflix content costs will become fixed because there is a limit to how much they can increase viewer engagement by increasing content spending. Then profits and profit growth will be enormous as they continue scaling up by adding subscribers and raising prices."

Netflix spending 17 billion on content this year while others will spend 2 billion on average. When competing streaming services start dropping like flies Netflix will not tap the brake on spending and it remains to be seen if any can survive.

"I do declare $550 as the turning point.I said the same thing at $500, but when I'm finally right, its a gut thing.GS is full of it and always have been. Who cares what they say, what are they doing? They are pumping and dumping. How do I know that. They are smart, and Netflix is a $150 stock in value. The PE is over 100 and growth (revenue) is 15% looking backwards and less looking forward. Check out the debt, which won't look so great when the price hits $150 per share. Then don't forget the train coming at Netflix, the recession is going to be tough. What are we experiencing? Huge government spending (stimulus). They are panicking as the money is drying up, states are going under, no revenue. Look at how many stores and businesses that are closed or almost closed, they are going under.The want to force people to go back to work, where? what jobs? If there were jobs, they would be back to work. Netflix needs to correct to have its PE normalized with its competiton, and don't forget the competition is way way too high as well."

The first player in Chess doesn't always win.
the fact that the market is going down and Netflix maintains that 13% proves how strong the buying is..
A split or a new plan to have some advertising. That's the rocket fuel.
People are going to ramp down their nflx usage its obvious
"Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). Citi hikes the target to $420 from $400 and maintains ""buy"" following earnings results. See below. Canaccord Genuity raises the target to $415 from $400 and maintains ""buy""."
"Minus $15 billion in Tangible Net Worth. Added $3 billion to LT Debt last year. Negative $441 million cash flow in 1st qtr., '19. They are losing a lot of content from upstart deep pocket competitors. Approaching double top from last August's 419. I don't think they make it and start long slide down. Their $11 billion in LT debt is approaching their revenue. If they were healthy, the LTD wouldn't be more than $5 billion."
It’s ok.. if it sinks tomorrow I’ll buy another 100
"I dont understand how an 11b in debt with junk bonds with 3b in cash and equivalents that year after year burns through cash can justify a 129 pe. Now even their product is being attacked with Apple, Disney etc..Honestly Im not being sarcastic I really want to know what are Longs thinking long term? Maybe its me and Im missing something?"
bumber......feel for you guys......its netflix own doing......they do nothing to mix it up for a better experience
This stock is amazing. Going up everyday forever.

"I expect a blowout quarter from NFLX next week, if it’s a big selloff I’m buying the dip. Been in this stock through several splits over the last 8 years...those who want to tell me competition from Disney+ will cause this company to crater need to realize the total addressable market is too large for just NFLX and that there is room for more than one player. I own both DIS and NFLX and believe both can compete and still thrive. The short case on NFLX disappeared when NFLX turned free cash flow positive last quarter. So this company is both profitable and it is now generating cash. Shorts are going to continue to get murdered over the next 8 years just as much as the prior 8."
what's the sudden pop in the end?
"A fact:After the last earnings debacle, NFLX has NOT finished below $500.Act accordingly."
net tangible assets = -14 billion.... but your market cap is 240 billion. come on now. your money is a lot safer elsewhere
You guys were right! 280! 
I don't think I've every been so pleased to be down 5%.
I just sold. Out until tomorrow. Not enough in the numbers. good luck longs.
"For Q2, Netflix forecasts 7.5M paid streaming adds, well above a consensus of 4.14M."
"Shorts have taken this stock to 410+ last year, this year the pattern is repeating"

"back over 500 before earnings, thank you to anyone who sold shares. greatly appreciated!"
"I will continue to say this is a dead cat bounce. Some funds are caught with the surprise and even though NFLX had quarters like this, it is different this time. A few years ago the cable guys and network were asleep at the wheel and there was no AMZN, HULU and APPL. The competition is definitely different this round and the results in the past quarter are reflective of this. People are lured to other providers besides NFLX. They may have some original content but others can also put money on creating something even better. As for international subscribers in Asia, there are not many paying customers as people are used to free content and there are lots of those TV top boxes now that are floating around. No one is willing to pay for content there. And China will be a big joke. Just wait til trade war extends to content and the Chinese will ban all partnerships to show content that they define as immorale western values."
A NFLX holder's greatest fear.....
"What's going with Nflx is so similar to what happened to the dot com industry in 2000. They were all bid up just like NFLX based solely one one factor and that is GROWTH. Now that NFLX has competition entering into the market and even more important now that we are actually seeing declines in their most important market, the United States, investors can no longer count of massive future growth. Does anyone even know how to read a financial report, more importantly a balance sheet? How can a company that has share holder equity of $5.2 billion and net tangible assets of $-9.7 billion be valued at $115 billion dollars? While NFLX may have some great content, the facts are the vast majority of their content is licensed from other producers, Timer Warner, Disney to name just two. Once both of them start their own streaming services and pulling their content from NFLX, where are they going to get content to fill all of those hours or are they just going to constantly repeat their own programs?How can any company have a stock valuation that is almost 25 times their share holder equity? How can any company have a stock valuation that negative net tangible assets?"
I love Netflix
Another reason to sell Netflix from speculators is the merger of AT & T and Discovery. Let's see what will happen in the day trading..

Cathy WOOD on CNBCNFLX has HUGE UPSIDE here she says !
"There was an article few days back where a trader advices to ""ride with the winners."" Netflix is a big winner during these times. Is Netflix stock a bubble as some say? Not sure, maybe, but hack I love their business model and I'm riding with it all the way. Q2 earnings will be great and with Covid cases going up and cinemas remaining close for most probably entire year, next quarters earning will be very good too. So, why jump out of a winner now? Give me a reason to sell this stock now! Seriously!"
Do any of you know that Netflix burnt $1 Billion in the prior quarter just for content? Do any of you know that Netflix could possibly file for bankruptcy if the credit markets froze up like in September 2009?
All those gift cards got cashed in this quarter. It's going to be great quarter.

The only question is .. how long will Netflix on buybacks be able to maintain the value of a share if Nasdaq on inflationary risks will greatly decline ..
I repeat $300 or lower on this. No more subscription.
"There's apps way better than Netflix, plus there's online streaming sites and cable boxes. I still don't get it why people subscribe for this "
still $289 too high.
Investors may be pleasantly surprised with earnings - new subscription pricing is included in this reporting quarter - which is approximately 10% higher subscription pricing

"Invest in something that can be replicated and applied. You don't need to find all the good opportunities, you just need to find the opportunities that you can understand, the so-called competency circle. $WIMI $NFLX $NIO"
Tariffs are bullish. The removal of tariffs is bullish.
"People investing based on wrong matrix called Growth. Given high penetration in many developed market, Growth isn't great matrix but how many Subscriber left who might subscribe.Here is NFLX Subscriber peak analysis and it's scary.For No. purpose I am using 30% more household due to Common netflix account sharing. Which likely conservative.Current Subscriber count:- 125MWith Sharing About 165MTotal World house hold (Ex- China which clearly not going to launch anytime soon except licensing deal with limited extra income.):- 600M80% world population live on <$10/day, most of them can't even afford. Normally those household much bigger and so I assume 40% house hold can't afford Netflix like service more than month or two/year So Let's Reduce 35% house hold = 390 left.Now let's assume on average 50% of that 390 subscriber (Which actually mean 65%-70% penetration with sharing. This is very very high number because even USA they can't reach there and their marketing cost already balloon in USA just to keep current growth rate) = 185M.My prediction, Peak around 160-170M , after reach 150M, Growth will stall or even go negative. Growth likely slowdown in quarter or two as well.If price raised within 2 month, we might see 2-3 Quarter of growth Stall and peak reduce by 10% at least.If you are retail long, this is best time to take profit (Atleast some profit) peak is not far from here on growth. Normally stock react few month advance. So recent quick raise is due to expected growth near peak which almost always certain for popular services like Netflix, HBO ,DIS (HBO experience peak even in 2014 and so Disney on their current business Line).Only difference between HBO , DIS and Netflix is, unlike DIS and HBO who generate real profit, Netflix still spend $2B-$3B /year and add debt. Also not other businesses to balanced out."

Guys take all you profits from Netflix again remember what happened to nvidia when GS did the same
Sweet! Was waiting for the dip under $500 to buy.
"NFLX price to sales 5 year average is around 6. Right now it is around 13. So 200 is not out of the question. But with 8 billion in streaming obligations and 9 billion in debt they need to do something. They are playing a tightrope game before the competition picks up. Really, a 160B dollar company and they dont even have a good browser. I have to use an app just to figure out whatthey have on streaming. Come on."
two negative days. 2 more to go. We will get 1 positive day. The best position is to stand on the sideline.
Panic selling is an understatement for whats happening in the market right now.
Netflix sell-off will never happen because 80% of the 435 million shares of netflix or 348 million shares worth $145 Billion are owned by institutions. These institutions are not affected by individual emotions to trigger sell-off but governed by groups of fund advisors who decide to hold or sell the funds.
Needs to split to attract new investors
This stock is easy just start the day to trapp bears
"Goldman Sachs — conviction buy rating, target price to $420 from $460“As Netﬂix’s content investments, distribution partnerships and marketing spend drive subscriber growth signiﬁcantly above consensus expectations and the company approaches an inﬂection point in cash proﬁtability, we continue to believe shares of NFLX will signiﬁcantly outperform. We remain Buy rated (on CL), though we lower our 12-month price target to $420 from $460 to reﬂect our revised estimates.”"

Definitely sat on the sidelines... The guidance was terrible so I am shocked by the huge move upwards in the afterhours.
This is exactly why I never could justify buying netflix. Anyone can copy what they are doing. I knew it was just a matter if time before the bottom fell out.
"Takeover Joe ""announcement"" was just a retweet of an article about netflix and he $NFLX tagged. No one invests in this . It's a crummy daytrader. All the hodlers are wondering why they aren't making money but it seems like everyone else is."

Priced for perfection and this report was not perfect. Means it goes down big tomorrow.
Expecting earnings to blow out of the waters from the stay at home families and getting new smart tvs and televisions equipped with Netflix their counts must have rise I think over sold and will increase after earnings I’m holding
"I have given enough thought on what to do. Here is how my holding look2200 short Average price just below $260I just short 2 285 calls I had 15 265 cover put for (that I just cover. $260 average price including that profit).Now I have open 2200 short. I know just today I lost $20K, Total is $50K+ loss.I thought to give various option including start selling put aggressively But $CAT I end up long side while doing that which Company like CAT is fine. But not with NFLX where if Crash come, this can go to $100's easily. So I only left with 2 options.1.> Sell in money cover put but if sell off start this can easily below 260 and I regret it.2.> Sell out money Cover put which I will do it again if this go near 270.3.> Trade Stock, Given large number stock, this I think I can do with little risk. Read market sentiment and trade accordingly.4.> Forget and keep all open. (Which mean I wait for payday). Only problem is if this keep going up very soon I will get margin call."
"Citi (Mark May)International subscriber additions were “meaningfully above” expectations, while the weaker-than-expected revenue in the quarter “appears to largely be FX driven.”May lifted his target on the company to $420 and affirmed his buy rating. In October, when May upgraded the stock to buy, he had a $375 target on Netflix.Nomura Instinet (Mark Kelley)“The quarter was fairly clean; management’s language on cash burn was consistent with prior commentary, indicating that investment in content is still top of mind.”There was “broad-based geographic strength” in net subscriber additions, along with a “solid 4Q18 content slate.”Lifts price target to $320 from $300, and boosts Ebitda forecasts for both 2019 and 2020. Keeps neutral rating.Goldman Sachs (Heath Terry)“Netflix has outperformed the best-fit-line in each of the last four quarters suggesting that the company is getting incremental leverage on its content investments.”Because subscriber additions continue to exceed expectations and the company is approaching “an inflection point in cash profitability, we believe shares of NFLX will continue to significantly outperform.”Raises price target to $450 from $420 “to reflect faster subscriber growth, particularly in international markets.” The firm maintained its buy rating and kept Netflix on its conviction list.RBC Capital Markets (Mark Mahaney)Global paid subscriber growth continues to accelerate, and the “pulling of pricing lever should be successful,” which “means accelerating revenue growth & operating margin expansion.”Raises price target to $480 from $450, not far below the Street-high target of $500. Also raises 2019 and 2020 revenue expectations."

Is this going higher? Good time to enter for long? Or is there a potential for correction to say 500-550?
Netflix already won the streaming wars. Rest are playing for #2.Amazon won online war.Tesla won the EV war.Apple the smartphone war.etc.
The hedge funds and banks aren’t done offloading their assets before the incoming crash. Not telling you guys what to do but you should look into the incoming crash that will pull the price back a lot. Media is pumping nflx now and what I’ve learned recently is you go against the media as they are pumping for the banks and HF so they can get out.
"A very well reasoned article, how Disney is very speculative at this level (not netflix).https://finance.yahoo.com/news/piling-disney-stock-anything-happens-112548269.html"
This is sick. NFLX still made billions from last report. Company did not go bankrupt. Because of a bit so satisfy quarter to loose 8 percent?
So basically everyone was wrong. There was no bloodbath and it was in the green. Anyone want to apologize?
Lets cover now before it's too late :)
"Toss a coin to your Witcher and say so long baby Yoda. Because a new is global hit is sweeping the globe. And just like that, Netflix has their Game of Thrones.

"This is a $50 stock, at best.It will see that price level within 12 months.Disney, Apple, even the over-the-air networks are getting into streaming. Netflix has no special advantage over those newcomers and the cost of switching is zero.Look for the cable companies to get in on the action, too, to help stem the losses for their bloated cable offerings.The major media companies will eventually dive in, too. Either by partnering with someone like Disney or by launching their own services.Netflix destroyed Blockbuster because the latter was slow to adjust to changing times. We'll see if Netflix changes in time to save itself."
"Awesome price action on Netflix. Past $170B market capitalization. Continues to be amazing for the longs. Guess it will keep going given the increased audience. Wish Netflix uses the current strength in stock price to make some strategic acquisitions to maintain lead over Amazon Prime video, Disney+ and Apple TV (using stock based purchases only taking advantage of higher stock price) in the media and broadcasting. Few names come to mind which are trading far below their intrinsic values.. Viacom CBS (Solid content library+strong television base including sports and brands such as Showtime, BET+, CBS Access, MTV, Comedy central besides providing entry to AVOD market space via Pluto TV already counting 22 million plus and growing users), Discovery (Some of the popular TV channels including Discovery, Food network, HG TV, TLC and Lions gate (helps add to movie content library). I hope they don't spend money on expensive movie making instead acquire content from established studios and excel where NFLX is good at which is content distribution IMO. GLTA."

Hahaha the low today was $346 so this is a normal intraday move for this stock
When you realize that Disney and Apple both threw their biggest punches(Free subscriptions) and it didn't affect Netflix at all....they literally have nothing else in their bag of tricks bigger than giving it away free. Wait until first quarter next year when all those free subscriptions go away and their first real churn takes place(minus 30-50% of their subscribers). Play the long game and don't be so short sighted.
Just wait until Reed opens NetflixWorld
"nflx still the #1 streaming service, and consensus will be top 2 long run (most ppl will subscribe to multiple services).the TAM is still huge, globally, but also domestically, if you consider the number of cable TV customers still paying absurd monthly costs, like 3-5 times the cost of a netflix subscription (in my region). as streaming becomes further saturated with content and becomes the dominant media, prices can be raised further.netflix needs to get into the live entertainment market, and to promote and establish original franchises for licensing and expansion into other markets, they could also expand through acquisitions. they will have plenty of cash to do this, so it's not a matter of if...just where they will expand and when."
Creative content has nearly doubled in price as movie companies can ask for the moon since so many competitors get into streaming.

"The usual. Driven up during after and pre hours and then sold off after those who can't trade during those hours buy in thinking the stock is moving up. Why are people allowed to manipulate stocks like this? This is a pattern especially with Netflix that should be regulated somehow.Stock closed at 309, opens at 317 and drops to 312 with a few hours. makes absolutely no sense. no stock consistently trades like this."
Going downtown as I told you a few weeks ago. The train just came out of the station :))
Almost bought the $297.50 calls for $0.01. Missed opportunity. NFLX has been itching for a breakout. No stopping this now.
So Disney + has 85+ M subscribers in year and has several new titles coming out this year. Netflix seems outmatched added 30M in the same year with a 6 year head start. They could catch Netflix next year in total subscribers.

Haven’t seen a company so overvalued in a long long time. Will be fun to watch the fall of Netflix as Amazon prime and disney + continue to eat up market share
"I don't see the competition overtaking Netflix for one reason, foreign films. There are many outstanding foreign films from around the world. So what happens? These countries will continue to watch these films use and join Netflix. Yes, many are closed caption but some are now being dubbed.I have many for years hated commercials. Also for years stopped watching MSM content.I do have HBO, Amazon and thinking about HULU for extra content and the ability to drop one TV, that my wife watches, to cut the final cable to her TV, which is expensive."
"Been thinking about streaming in general and the cost of content, not just for Netflix but for everyone. Think about this. Netflix added 4 million subs in January through March. They're guiding for a million subs in April through June. That's 5 million subs they're adding in six months. ARPU is $11 or $12, right? So let's use $12. That's $60 million in additional revenue each month. Six months times $60 million is $360 million added revenue over six months. They spent 450 million for two Knives Out movies. Just TWO MOVIES will cost them 90 million dollars more than the extra revenue they gained for six months. The Sony deal on top of that is probably crazy expensive as well. And this is for a handful of movies. See the problem here? The only recourse for any streamer is to either get content prices down or keep raising sub prices, but Netflix has been okay with writing massive checks to people and relying on sub numbers to move the stock. That's not gonna work as well anymore."

We saw $375 last week. Hoping to see to $380 this week.
"People paying nearly 50% of current market value (About $60B) just to some recent Netflix Exclusive Hits. I put those hits value just around $10B ( This is how much Very long list of Super Hit HBO shows ever worth to HBO valuation)Here is How I would divide value of Current Netflix Enterprise valueCurrent Subscriber:-About $40B ( $330/Subscriber) :- Reason:- Very high penetration to many market give higher value ($360 =3 year fee), Raising Marketing cost mean likely high chrun rate cut some ($30-$40 negative)Growth:- $25B (Given high value but please note this limit based on Raising Marketing cost- make risky and Growth will find some trouble in couple year, Competition also factor here. )Orignal Content:- $10B ( They have spend about $6-7B on orignal content with some hit)Up Coming Content :- $5B (This is value they creating after paying for content, This assume continue success in shows.)License Content:- $5B (Many limited time, Old content has not much value either)Other :- $5BTotal:-$90B Enterprise value =$75B market value ( About $15B for debt and Content value reduction which already accounted above)I am very generous on give This company valuation and still that = 30-40% hair cut to current market value."
"This will hit $550 by friday! No worries, have you seen the charts, option charts, and expected earnings! this is going to the moon finally."
Great rally to end the day folks. Bottom line is this though.. this will trade within a 10 point window in either direction until the Q1 earnings call. 9+ mill subscribers sends this up 20 points and ultimately to 400 in weeks to follow. They miss the 8.9 million subscriber number and we have a big problem on our hands and we need to sell cause the growth story is what buries the P/E ratio. It's that simple.
Honestly I kept wondering about the Netflix bandwagon so I joined . Not overly impressed . Not the easiest platform to use and the movies by Netflix are very B rated at best . Many of the regular movies are very old . It’s like HBO meets Lifetime channel
"I am so nervous with Nflx subscribers number on Wednesday 16 after the bell . Please , I need some help SELL OR HOLD ???"
Wiped out 24B in a matter of minutes. The casino stocks FANG have been over pumped!
back up she goes. missed on revs but exceed eps and subscribers. guidance and call will push this into the positive territory + analyst upgrades tommorow
If it goes over 357.30 it will be a new high for the month and highest since July 27.
I bought it after the drop. I made good money on it a couple of weeks ago by buying in at $505 and selling at $535 less than a week later. Time to do it again.
600 dollars before june
With nflx falling below 290 level could there be interest from someone for a buyout? Or merger. Just thinking outloud
"do not buy options today, options prices will crash after earnings both puts and calls"
Netflix has more than 5 million subscribers in France https://finance.yahoo.com/news/netflix-more-5-million-subscribers-141923068.html
love netflix never a problem
All time high by next Friday? Maybe Disney or Amazon should buy out Netflix
Netflix brought this on themselves. Old stale movies/ shows. Highly political stance (Left leaning). Charge way too much for what they provide. They couldn't capitalize at a time when majority of people were staying at home in front of their TVs?! HAHAH What a joke!
"It was the best day yesterday. Finally got out of a lot of stocks. I was waiting for the opportunity. I am a bit skeptical about this job report. If the government is not working, who compiled this report? I think it was a political stunt to arrest the market fall by Trump administration. If the manufacturing index came out so bad showing manufacturing shrinking, it seems counterintuitive to think that the manufacturers would be adding jobs. Anyway, cash is the king right now. Will wait for opportunities."
"There are 300 million broadband subscribers in India and Netflix currently has 2 popular original TV series there, Sacred Games and Ghoul. Q3 subscriber adds could be very big."
"The difference between Netflix and Disney+ in one sentence:“Netflix is the most innovative content creation and distribution company of the last decade, leading the way in streaming since 2007 and changing the original content game with House of Cards in 2013,” said Brian Grazer, Ron Howard and Tyler Mitchell, co-founders of Impact, in a joint statement. Amen to that."
"IMDb, the film and TV website owned by Amazon, is launching a free streaming video channel that will be available in the U.S. on its website and Amazon Fire TV devices, the company announced Thursday. Unlike streaming services like Netflix and Prime Video, IMDb Freedive does not require a subscription, and is instead supported by ads, according to a press release.The streaming space is getting increasingly crowded as even legacy media players like Disney have announced plans to create their own services. Apple, AT&T and others are also planning to launch streaming video services this year. But IMDb's ad-based model could make it attractive to consumers"
"Have 943 shares, down a bit but still haven’t lost a blink of sleep, as professional trader, I know based on solid ground of Netflix will back up to $400+ in near future, for far future its $450+. Please don’t panic, it’s what Market does to stock when things are not certain."
Tomorrow will green again.
Was doing great until they brought in Obama and Rice... I wonder why...
Perhaps now they will finally stop all the stealing by non subscribers. That alone will instantly boost revenue and earnings quite significantly. I just bought more as I have for years on any dips.
"NFLX may explode later today. She may get in the red first, though."
"Crushes earnings and other monetary metrics. As a reward the investor loses 35% in 4 months. Large debt or not, there's NO inherent reason for a drop like that with the metrics it had. Besides, it always had a relatively large debt, why the drop now?"
"Netflix has gotten too expensive. I am at almost $20 a month in order to get 4K UHD. I am probably going to drop for a few months until some shows I like are back on. Right now I am watching Paramount+ the most and enjoying some shows I never watched before like The Good Wife, The Good fight, Blue Bloods, etc......."
NFLX looking strong this morning.She may erupt today.
it's still a buy at $250
will break 400 next week. easily.
"The analysts will say ""BUY"".... In truth they are shorting the stock. Notice they talk a lot about their options plays."
Netflix up 1% in six months ..... def worth the investment
"CEO claim that he will have 100M from India is laughable claim.India sure has 1300M people but when you count house hold, They are around 300M ( Joint family common in India still).In other word to reach 100M subscriber it need 1 in 3. Now even USA it hardly reach there.Now look at Income.In India 85% household don't even earn $1000/Month. In other word they can't afford $10/Month. Cable service does not even cost $10/month with 100's channel.So At best I give chance to reach 10M.Same article estimate 0.5M paid subscriber in India.This is how insane claims people make. When it come from CEO this look seriously fishy.I wonder if he inflating subscriber count using robot just to create hype and stock price raise. If Secondary Stock offer announced soon, It will just confirm my theory that They need money and using Stock as Money and fooling people."
Looks like blowout subscriber numbers coming. We see a big ramp in the number of Netflix originals on the most popular TV series lists starting in the beginning of December.
"Hey bashers, streaming a commodity? It's about CONTENT and NFLX has excellent content!"
"Well hooders...it could be worse.....you could be stuck long in cciv, cramer pumped it 9 timesit just went down fastertbioThe Real RyanReal as they come since 1997"
Disney reports Earnings Wednesday. What are the odds something in there sends this thing down? I personally believe there’s 50/50 shot and will be closing out all nflx positions before end of day Wednesday. Thoughts?
pop after earning
On Fiirrrreee
Relax people over reacting for no reason. Stop looking at it everyday it’s going to give a to much emotion just stop it. It’s going back up soon
buy the dips?
You all way too bullish.... they increase the monthly and people were not happy about it and with everything reopening they will have to lower their forecast and that can turn negative! Just saying
"Buy $250 puts, very cheap and huge potential."
Time for Netflix to make new 52 week high
Bought 400sh in 2009. NFLX is putting my son through school. Little to complain about with this company.
"I dont know how people can be so confidant that NFLX will give better guidance going forward, clearly there has been FOMO buying and the price has skyrocketed, then a price increase announcement 2 days before earnings report? this screams short if you ask me..."
"Why is this still down doesn’t make any sense NFLX beat ER all FANGS are up, whoever that selling or shorting this will regret it badly come after hours."

Finally found how much revenue billboard company generate. I was surprise. (Should I say not surprise since Netflix buying it)Company generate $36M in revenue according to this site. Now paying $300M for that sure meet Netflix stanard. You know what I mean. Overpaying must be very sexy.http://www.hoovers.com/company-information/cs/company-profile.regency_outdoor_advertising_inc.3e65df584eacf908.html

so .any upgrades coming soon dont sell this is 600 dollar stock
you know how many people including myself have cancelled our memberships! LOL this is going down
Is anyone still watching Netflix? I still watch 20 years old series in cable TV. Net flux trash not interested.
On track to blow away previous record for subscriber adds in a year.
"welcome to the party. Your a bit late, but its time to get this party started."
Guys After 2 hours we will start buy 40k share Just follow me This week up to 380$
330 soon. Wow !
every year they will try to jack up prices to pay bonuses and then keep losing users
"Nasdaq green, this stock red, always.."
Just covered my NFLX short at $339 after shorting it at $405...still think its going sub $300 but took the profit
"Dis doubled subscribers, imagine Netflix"
"So if they give away a billion free subscriptions and show 1000% “subscription growth” (lol) at the expense of zero margin and losses then the stock will shoot up 100x fold in one day, correct? Is this what people are chasing??? They missed eps by a mile because of that (just gave free or cheap subs) yet showed a “subscriber beat” so called and now added 20 BILLION to their market cap based on that?? Makes total sense in this incredible market bubble of course...keep on buying!!!"
October earnings gonna show dropped customers IMO
I’m very disappointed with Netflix they have no new shows ever I feel like I have DIRECTV with 1 million channels I can’t find anything to watch quite honestly the platform has become very stale
Leader of the pack.
"Based on the pace of of debt increase, how is this type of business model sustainable?"
i watched this last year at 232 from 423 and still never sold .lol Netflix dominates the world
Market waiting for Fed speech guys. Netflix will either go 255 or 275 today
"looks like the analysts can't keep up with the price increases. Wildly inappropriate, but it seems the norm for mega caps to go up 10 percent a week these days."
Tom Rogers well known analyst and media mogul was just on CNBC and gave NFLX a great read out and said that NFLX will continue to grow subscribers and far outpace competition.NFLX will give investors a great opportunity to buy shares at open and proceed to pop at trading day proceeds.
"I'm new to investing, yesterday I learned a very important lesson about setting a stop loss"
US subs will be strong and international will be blow out numbers! Watch. The world is on lock down.
I am very curious about all this hype that Netflix did not reach subscriber growth numbers. This is true domestically but internationally they met the expected growth. One thing to note is Netflix market saturation domestically. They have already reached a HUGE amount that any more growth domestically will be expensive to maintain and grow. This is why I think that international growth should be the focus of Netflix in the coming years. Thoughts?
"Shorts losing the dip, will cover soon today, no more downside from here folks"
Shi I wish had payed attention to who's reporting earnings today. Down she goes!
"I love NFLX, but cancelling Daredevil and The Punisher was a big mistake! Seriously! Those shows were amazing and just getting into their prime, there was so much left to tell in the stories and so many dedicated fans! Netflix needs to sit down with Marvel and renegotiate a deal to bring back Daredevil and The Punisher."
Invest in ViacomCbs best stock 60% discount
Apple will buy Netflix early 2018!
"The stock is very, very cheap now. Only Netflix has the subscriber growth which leads to more content."
This os awesomeee!! Sorry for the ones who lost money but this is a great opportunity
Huge over reaction!This will get back close to 600 by summer
Interesting in that it lost $55 quickly and stayed within a buck or two of that the entire AH session.
Will make a new all time high before close today.
"Chart for this stock follows the chart of the S&P500 index, and that index always goes higher eventually"
Highest day since July 27 (366.85)

"Dont miss the videoconference at 6pm EST where for the 3rd time in a row, UBS analyst Eric Sheridan will ask softball questions to management for an hour. Eric Sheridan also happens to be on the payroll at Netflix."
The main reason NFLX growth was down last qtr was because of world cup soccer. time to buy...
Netflix needs better Original programming. Disney+ numbers are strong because of Mandalorian/WandaVision.
Netflix stock price is controlled by short sellers
Bought some levered call options for 1000$ premarket; alrdy worth 1400$ now ;DLooks like was a smart move and we can go ahead to 700$ fast :)
Viacom is growing and paying dividend do your own dd
450 next stop
What kind of person would invest in Cuties?
I guess trannie programming isn't appealing.
NFLX is a buy at any price. The NFLX rocket defies financial gravity. Traditional valuation metrics do not apply to this company because the the story is so overwhelmingly compelling.
is this a good entry point 10% discount since 2 days ago.
"I've used both Amazon Video extensively and now using Netflix. The experience with Netflix is so, so much better. I am quite the Amazon fan, but I think the only way big conglomerates like Amazon can take on specialized services like Netflix is to operate at a loss until they run Netflix out of business. Netflix is too big for that.Take a lesson from Apple, guys. The ones who perfect a few options will succeed against those with many options. That is why Apple has been so successful offering only a few models to choose from.One could make the case that Amazon provides a wholistic experience. They are quite a ways away from that.Wishing I had more money to invest at such a discount!"
Vaccine delay is apparently bad news for nflx stock. Vaccine progress is bad news for nflx too. Lol
Analysts will need to bump earnings estimates up for this year and next year. Open the gates and let the momentum investors in.
"two step forward, two steps back :("
And the sudden sell off is because ...........?
They still had growth just not as much as expected. Not worried about holding this one
If you guys had to choose between roku or NFLX you’d choose?
"Why does everyone constantly compare netflix and disney, why do you think that a person should choose just one of them. They have completely different content."
I'm only up 110% now instead of 125%...oh well.
Beat rev and sub growth estimates!!
"Netflix upgraded to Buy from Hold with a $650 price target at ArgusArgus analyst Joseph #$%$ upgraded Netflix to Buy from Hold with a $650 price target. The company is expanding globally, adding new subscribers, and ""strengthening"" its industry position with ""popular"" original content, the analyst tells investors in a research note. #$%$ believes that Netflix offers a sustainable structural competitive advantage in the streaming video space, and the recent selloff in the stock represents an ""appropriate"" entry point."
I would not short until it breaks that 50 day on a day chart. It's going to take some bad Market news.
"Netflix’s forward (2022) PE of 38 is lower than that of Disney and Disney’s media networks, its biggest sector, is in a death spiral."
"What can I do without? Hulu live TV has local, sports and a ton of movies from all studios for $50 and 50 channels. YouTube TV has 70 ch for $50 plus YouTube red. Spectrum has 155 ch plus internet and phone for $100/mo. Direct TV now has 40ch for $50 but has many on demand. NFLX has their own series and movies but VERY limited other movies for what $15 plus I don't need Nflx. It is not that good. I chose spectrum net for 50, YouTube TV for 50 and basic Hulu for $6. Hulu has much more choice vs NFLX."
Where my Shorts at ? New Closing High on NFLX all time high open Monday you are now all under water in your shorts cover quick I need 310 next month
Chart looks bullish.
"guess their ""talent density"" will become less dense soon and expenses go up due to generous severance"
"Time to increase Netflix, 30% drop is a sweet spot"
"I can watch Champions league soccer on Paramount + right now. YeeHaw.NFL, Europa league. CBS sports. Comedy Channel. real news from SKY or BBC.Showtime. BET. Paramount movies. Paramount + has 10 good movies for every 1good movie on Netflix.Why? Because they own the movies. Netflix rents them."
Shorts leaving it seems.
"Analyst just adding fuel to fire. I guess they don't care valuation and Why they should there are enough out there buy at any price. I just don't understand why raise price target to 345, Just raise to 1000 or 2000 or something."
Better than expected subscriber adds along with a subscription price increase will send this to 650 before years end.
Millions will have Disney+ and millions will have Netflix. Millions will have one or the other and millions will have both. But no one that has Netflix is getting rid of it for Disney+ that much is a fact.

Holding a range of $358-$360 for the past hour. Let's see which in direction it breaks out ....
Ouch
Sorry but with Disney and earning report projected poor by Goldman sach I just sold all my share before or in case it drop.
$IQ RALLY WILL CONTINUE ON MONDAY. EXPECT GOOD TRADING NEWS OVER THE WEEKEND BETWEEN US AND CHINA. DO NO T SELL. $NFLX $HUYA
"CBS report a good Q helped by strong licensing revenue from Netflix. Les Moonves gets it. I believe Bob Iger gets it, we'll see if Disney continue the Marvel TV series with Netflix."
Tomorrow it’s looking really good. I’m telling you all it’s going to get better from here on out. There is no reason to be back 400.00 plus by the end of the month. I love Netflix and loves me back
"I just can't figure out why people don't see the obvious? Volumes fell from 7 million to 4 million. The promotion is lower and lower every time. And Nasdak is getting higher. What needs to happen, what event is there for them to at least be able to return $ 570? They are overbought in terms of fundamentals. And slowing down subscribers will finally break them."
"well not bad, still losing a lot, need to get to 410.00, good luck to all !."
"Appointing Rice and signing the Obamas was for one reason - international subscriber growth. In order to realize its heady targets, NFLX must penetrate and be the top one or two streaming services in a large percentage of countries. IMO, Hastings apparently feels Trump damages American prestige, and in turn, NFLX prospects. So he is using the dynamic duo (Obama/Rice) to assuage the world and ensure NFLX can succeed in these countries.The fact that NFLX would be willing to take the risk of angering 1/2 of the USA in order to build int'l bridges for NFLX tells me that Hastings and co. are desperate for the subscriber growth that will only happen if the world embraces NFLX. This is not a good sign.So, my thoughts have evolved on this. Sure, Hastings is a Lib, has a vehicle for spreading the message, and can use the dynamic duo to do so. But he did this for business, not political reasons. I believe his reasoning is not sound, and demonstrates the challenges the company faces."
Here we go people start buying. I see it going up by the end of the week.
I’m short again at 303
"$MSFT $WIMI $NFLX Investment is a science, speculation is an art."
my puts are going great. my bracket is up enough
"Netflix is losing friends and the office, two of it's most streamed shows. The Disney deal is set to expire this year. Netflix's catalogue of content is going to take a massive hit. Their own content is not enough to sustain them. In the very long term I might remain neutral on Netflix, but short term this could be a brutal three year period."
Looking real good for $400.00 today and maybe a little extra.
Netflix is up almost $100 since Hastings said they plan to take spending up quite a bit. Translation: they continue to see strong demand and will be raising prices this year.
"What do you guys think? Is it time to sell and cash in? It is a way overextended rally in no time! I'm up $50M since December 2018. I'm going to cash in EOD anyway but, Your sincere thoughts are welcomed. $NFLX $AMZN $AAPL $AMD $NVDA $CSCO $SQ $SHOP"
Tomorrow market will be up and we see again 510+
I bet Nflx will rocket to $550 the moment I sell!
"I did an unusual call option purchase. Too close, too high, but I did it. I bought 50 April 24 $475 calls. Don't do it unless you can afford to lose that money. It's almost like gambling. I bought it at 58 cents average."
Everyone that doubts Netflix should listen to the earnings call
The analysts will come out Monday and Tuesday to upgrade this stock. Of course after they and their friends/families bought lots of stock at this level. The price will swing up this week.
Going to braekout 390$ by friday
NFLX may hit $285 this Friday....Don't short NFLX before its momentum stops. It can move much higher...I have been seen this thing happened tons of times before:
not buying into this sell off...still holding
"unless nflx is growing at 80% a PE of 170 is too highif nflx is only growing at 15%, then the value might be 15/170*375 = $33its ten times too pricey based on a 15% growth5 times is you use the forward PE, putting it worth $66they turned into Bitcoin"
Will continue drop and lost subscriber to Disney +
BUY NOW! Thank me next week.
Yahoo Finance Earnings Calendar still says the NFLX report will come out today at 12;00 noon eastern time? Expecting .79 cents per share.
"Toss a coin to the Witcher, it will make you Richer..."
"NFLX seems to have two major strategies:1. Provide as much of the existing popular content, produced by cable networks and movie studios2. Create their own original content exclusively available on NetFlixQuestion for all: it would seem that part 1 is under massive attack since practically all content owners at best has ambivalent feelings about NetFlix (e.g. cable networks with loyalties divided between NetFlix revenues and cable revenues), and at worse planning to compete outright and pull their content away from NetFlix (e.g. Disney). It then begs the question just how far can strategy #2 take NFLX when creating that unique content is very costly and then just makes NetFlix just one of many movies, documentaries and series producers. Feedback anyone?Disclosure: I am short NFLX as of 2 days ago"
Disney+ revenue growth rate from the previous Q was lower than what Netflix had.
NFLX is the next Blockbuster.
"All the talk about Disney removing content from Netflix, does it fall under antitrust? Why can’t Disney license the shows out to anyone wants pay the fair price?? How is it legal to limit the circulation of contents?"
to the best
Chart is literally doing the exact same thing as yesterday if so looks like we should be hitting 564 ish
"Apr 16, 2018. Netflix, Inc. is expected* to report earnings on 04/16/2018 after the close. I think the stock goes back over 300 before earnings."
May be reversing.Buy calls.
"Wow, so Microsoft will generate $35 billion in free cash flow in FY'19. And Facebook will likely generate $17.5 billion in free cash flow. And then there is Debtflix that will lose $3.5 billion in cash flow."
"Ok so from the technical analysis, it reached the 486 in 1hr tf at the support level and it may reach back to $499 resistance or if it breaks that then back to $578 area"
Chart looks similar to 2009 when it broke out through 7 and rallied to 42.
Good news guys! We’re up $0.39 in after hours!!!
"Raise prices and beat their best Q ever for selling subscriptions by 18%. Imagine if Google and Facebook raise prices on ads and beat their best Q ever for selling ads by 18%, or imagine Amazon raising prices and beating their best Q ever by 18%. You can only imagine because they would never be able to do it."
"Netflix price target raised to $628 from $615 at JPMorgan, OverweightJPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth raised the firm's price target on Netflix to $628 from $615 and reiterates an Overweight rating on the shares. The analyst ""tweaked"" estimates higher to reflect the monthly price increases in both the U.S.and Canada. Anmuth does not expect the increase to pressure net subscriber additions."
This will be $400 when earnings come out!!! Cant wait!
"Analytics firm Antenna found Netflix had the lowest churn of all the streaming services last quarter. Monthly cancelation rate: Netflix 2.5%, Disney+ 4.3%, Hulu 5.2%, CBS All Access 5.9%, HBO Max 6.7%. Being in an an original content slump caused by the pandemic Netflix has been licensing big hit movies to keep subscribers engaged. This shows media companies need revenue from Netflix to stay FCF positive."
NFLX should already be over $600 after that earnings report. Patience
Happy to say the profit on my investment in Netflix today has reached 1000% and it had only taken five years. I have never had an investment perform this well and I hold all the high beta stocks. I continue to be a believer in this generational stock and plan to hold indefinitely. GLTA in your investing life.
stay green bb
NFLX is gonna be green tomorrow when it's all said and done...just watch!
Wow very happy that I kept my 2 shares. 
Anyone not buying at these levels is missing on a big opportunity.
Bear trap
"most tech stocks are down today, so nothing in particular to netflix. LONG"
Revenue growth increased around 10% when Netflix raised prices in the past. A price increase now would bring revenue growth back above 30%.
"I am open to selling my NFLX shares to Apple, 5 for 1 or AMZN .20 to 1. Let's merge."
How do you justify a 130 PE ratio? When will those earnings meterialize? I'm a big fan of Netflix but this is to much! Other streaming platforms are coming and netflix will have to spend much more to be competitve! I'm sorry but this is a $120 stock (being optimistic)
um that’s with the 1% spike out of nowhere?
Oh my going above 380 today. Break and see you at 400 tomorrow
I’d be nervous. Getting to be too much competition. Limited room for price hikes. Who’s going to want this service when it’s $25 a month?
Imo earnings will be great think of all the new subscribers. Crazy to see now.
Does anyone know what times are the results?
Next stop is 400 they gonna keep raising the price on this stock . Best stock in wall street.
This is a double from here. GREAT COMPANY and LEADERSHIP.
"Sorry. Long live Netflix, but the stock price is no longer justified."
Netflix just surpassed Disney on market cap
"Given that the current lockdown and quarantine in place situation isn't going to go away anytime soon, not even by the end of this year, Netflix is easily poised to become a $500+ stock.The biggest issue that I foresee for Netflix due to the COVID-19 situation is the increased difficulty of creating and shooting original content. $500 stock. $600-$650 stock end of year based on rough estimates."
I come from India and can't stress any more the significance of cheap mobile plans introduced this week. Nflx will do very good coz of this and know all time high is coming by next earnings
"Here’s why Netflix stock, now below $500, is going to $1,000 https://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-why-netflix-stock-now-below-500-is-going-to-1000-2020-07-27"
Chart readers watching for a golden cross and I think its coming GB
Only safe investment there is in this current market. All new highs coming soon!
NFLX will control the world financial system
This ALWAYS ends the same way! higher it goes the bigger the drop! looking like the next AMD. Prefect earnings priced in shorts tapped out for the most part. ITS GOING TO SINK. just a matter of time

"As a guy living in europe, I can tell netflix dominates whole streaming industry here. 1- Disney+ and most of other services you guys talk about is not available here2- The mentioned free month option is not available here3- The content richness of netflix is insane and uncomparable with any other options. I just know amazon prime and they litterally doesnt have anything at europe to watch except 1-2 shows.4- I am new to this however with respect to my personal analysis using google trends. I expect around 25% increase compared to last quaters new subscription numbers. Therefore I expect around 11M new subscription (it was 8.7M last quater)Therefore this stock will explode in the earnings considering the reduced costs due to stopped productions. I personally expect 2.0+ EPSCheers from EU"
"Never hold through earnings, lots of disappointment tomorrow"
"$NIO A game of waiting, waiting for market conditions to change, waiting for time to expand or shrink your money position, waiting for Mr. Market to give you everything. $NFLX $ZM"
"I really can't understand why this stock is falling. It has a large, expanding customer base. It is also consistently profitable and has surpassed the analyst's expectations on a quarterly basis. I am beginning to think I should just stay out of the market as there are forces going on here that I simply do not understand. My $100K investment here is now worth about $77K... Nice! I guess I can't roll with the big boys"
"In a few years, there will talks about Netflix buying Disney."
Big oil hit job. No wants to talk about $shop being a outrages valuation or $Nflx business model not having a clear path to long term success. When it’s comes to EV’s is there really going to be a bigger or better player than Tesla? If so when? When you think EV you think Tesla. Everyone loves the product
how can anyone hold or bye this stock now
It's not a bad idea to add more shares before another subscriber growth survey comes out ahead of the earnings report due in just 3 weeks. JMHO
"was there for the break through 100, then 200, then 300, now 337 will stay there as it breaks through 500 and beyond."
looks like it held up strong
"Wont drop any further, ALL the damage has been done, its at the bottom with October coming to a close...……...good buy at this price for long, the only way is up and profit"
Will it be back to $400 today?
Slap that ask let's punish the shorts this afternoon
"BofA reiterates Buy on Netflix and $575 target, after churn checkhttps://seekingalpha.com/news/3605192-bofa-reiterates-buy-on-netflix-after-churn-check?utm_medium=email&utm_source=seeking_alpha&mail_subject=nflx-bofa-reiterates-buy-on-netflix-after-churn-check&utm_campaign=rta-stock-news&utm_content=link-3"
"Just a reminder, one other upgrade in late March had come from RBC Capital maintaining a buy rating on NFLX and a price target of $420. This is a bit lower than AB Bernstein who in early April raised their NFLX rating to outperform and upped their own $423 target to $487. (Also, according to Market Watch, streaming services jumped up 32% in March - globally - this will have a major positive impact on NFLX Q1 numbers as they are by far the leaders in the streaming service industry).Wishing all that celebrate a Happy Easter and a safe and healthy long weekend!!"
The Mouse is beginning to roar.
My post deleted...due to i mentioned donation of blm from netflex
"so some analyst pumped price target by $100, and that's worth company entire 2017 revenue. hmmm it all makes sense."
Why would anyone waste their time telling people how bad a stock is? LOL Thank you for looking out for everyone. ;)
"It will tell us a lot with how the market closes today. If we get a little bump up that is a good sign, but a bump down (what I expect) will be a pretty bad sign."
"MKM Partners out very bullish on NFLX, reiterates buy rating with 12-month price target of 415, sees surging earnings growth through 2025, and sees the stock to rally 30% annually for 5 yrs. They must know something."
One word : perplexed
"The major difference between NFLX and DIS is that when Disney launch their streaming of movies for $6.99 they will have many parents subscribing for their kids. $6.99 is less than the cost of one movie. With Netflix they have over 130M subscribers, To date they have not been too profitable. They have a PE ratio of over 130x earnings. Yikess........ They are pouring a lot of $$$ into original contents. They do not own their own studios and Disney has studios. There is definitely advantages and disadvantages in owning studios. This is a major blow for Netflix. I do believe that Disney will get up to 60M subscribers in the near future like just a few years at most."
ready to crush
"@Alen- Glad to hear common sense prevailing. At this point NFLX is totally immersed in people's lives. Even the bears can't argue that point. And the pleasure that people get from watching what this company puts out literally costs them less then 50 cents a day. If people want to add Hulu or Disney+ along the way then they'll simply pay $10 to add a second streaming service. That's under $25 a month for multiple streaming services. People spend that at Starbucks during the course of a week or the first 2 hours at a bar on a Saturday night. Like you said... no one is cancelling their NFLX subscription to redirect 15 freaking dollars elsewhere for a different streaming platform. Bottom line: Stay long, ride the subscription wave to 200 million worldwide, ride the 800 pound gorilla that will start printing money within 3 years which every analyst under the sun has been saying. Sometimes the easiest money can be made in the simplest of stories. The NFLX story is as simple as they come. In a short time there will be almost a quarter of a billion people paying $15 a month to watch content that they are obsessed with. A story doesn't get any more beautiful than that."
Sio glad I finally jumped aboard this baby last month. What a machine.
"Resistance at 575, if crossed then 670-680."
"3Q earnings will be great, a lot of new stuff went out (stranger things, casa del papel, Orange Is The New Black, balck mirror, etc..) no surprise they had a significant acceleration in apps growth in Q3 as per Bank of America research. And decrease of growth of download app in Sept. It's a streaming on and off service, people get in when is worth it, Q3 was worth it, earnings will jump! As they did in Q3 208, Q3 2017 etc"
"Oh oh, watch out NFLX, Disney+ is coming ...Disney’s access to popular content naturally makes it a force to be reckoned with in the streaming space. At launch, Disney+ users will have immediate access to more than 500 movies and more than 7,500 episodes of library television content, including 30 seasons of The Simpsons. Disney+ will also offer 10 original movies, specials, and series exclusive to the platform, including The Mandalorian (the first live-action Star Wars series). Disney+ will allow unlimited downloads of any TV show or movie on up to 10 devices, which is a feature that can distinguish it from Netflix."
$430 by friday.

This happened when I bought at $114 and it dropped to $85. Glad I didn't sell :)
This looks solid green to me.
It will reach to 500$ each share so soon
Disney just said Hulu international on hold due to cash shortage - that means Netflix will grow unchecked internationally for next few years
we looking at a green day tomorrow?
If you think TSLA earnings is impressive wait till you see AMZN today. I would load up before market closes today. Thank me later.
Shorts have gotten obliterated betting against this name. It's like salmons swimming upstream where the end result is just tragic...
"Another early trading session sell-off, but it looks like that may be it. Heading to $370+ today, I predict."
Will be green tomorrow. lot of shorts will be covering
Just curious as to why almost an equitable drop occurred in the days prior to the earnings release. It was as if certain investors may have had access to certain information that the general investment population wasn't privy to. Just a thought! GLTA
keep up the momentum..waiting for 380
Market almost came all the way back to its December 2018 low. Netflix didn’t come close to its December 2018 low. Netflix is a strong buy.
this is actually going to break green today
Ready to be done with Netflix as an investment . It’s sad how much it’s been punished the last few years. COVID was it’s snap back - but it really is so much better. Just can’t crater with it

netflix will always come back. regardless of what happens in er.
"Do not count Netflix out. They have the best ROI for the quality of content they create. Asides from “The Irishman” they have had no big name actors in any of their original content. Also factor in Netflix can advertising to their offerings at anytime they want. A lot of room to expand overseas as well still!!! Maybe it will not 3x any time soon, but definately can beat the s & p for returns"
500 by next year
"I've changed my position on NFLX. I bought calls after realizing today that the stock is climbing higher into earnings. I intend to take my profits the day before they release their earnings. As I'm still unconvinced that their subscriptions have improved this quarter. The only problem is what Powell does next week. I'm not sure how the market will react to only a quarter point. After earnings I'll again accumulate puts just in time for the Apple, and Disney launches."
"If you owned NFLX only from 2 years ago & thought it overpriced then, you’d be happy today. 2 years from now, would you be happy if you bought this year? IDK. I’d be happier if they took their positive cashflow & paid a dividend, while still making excellent content. With only Queen’s Gambit, the Irregulars, One Night in Miami, there’s nothing else they have that’s good."
"Netflix maintain overweight and $643 price target at piper sandlerPiper Sandler analyst Yung Kim says the firm's December quarter ""Netflix Navigator"" search index points to Q4 subscriber growth in-line with consensus for both U.S. and Canada as well as international. The search index analysis suggests Q4 U.S. and Canada subscriber growth of 8.5% year-over-year, versus the consensus at 8.3%, and international growth of 29.1%, versus the consensus at 28.7%. Kim remains comfortable with estimates of 8.7% and 28.7%, respectively, driven by the ongoing stay-at-home environment. Despite increasing competition, Netflix continues to capture a significant share of content consumption dollars, Kim tells investors in a research note. The analyst keeps an Overweight rating on the shares with a $643 price target."
"It's funny, if earlier here $ 530-540 was quite a normal price and it could easily be reached within a month from $ 500. Now even $ 500 seems to be something unattainable)."
"WEDBUSH: Netflix overvalued, could drop 37% next year"
SWEET RECOVERY 
$503.03 will make a huge difference.
Stock will soar high after all sheeps run away. Strong company and it is good to buy with such discount price !
I have ran out programs to watch.
Headed to 300 soon
Anyone see $380 before end of the week?
Tony you are looking for the tsla board. It is funny however that you stumbled upon nflx. A company rewarded with a 50% higher market cap than tsla with less revenue and more debt AND a company that produces NOTHING of value. Unlike Tsla.
"Ignorant shorts and weak hands, listen up. Netflix reported a net income of $1.71 billion, a quarterly record that was almost $1 billion higher than the $709 million reported a year ago and nearly as much as Netflix earned in all of 2019. Revenue increased more than 24% as price increases in the U.S. and Canada took effect. Netflix is less about growth and more about net income now. So thank you for the cheap shares. I’ll be adding more shares tomorrow once I find an entry point."
"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/netflix-shares-can-fall-50-if-growth-cred-is-lost-says-needham?post=302277Covid-19 is about to end, Netflix will fall because people don't have to stay isolation and people gonna travel instead."
Earnings not just important for Netflix but for all of tech.. Not a holder but fingers crossed for a strong earnings beat.. Hope it goes well.
Wow i should of bought this last night. Scared money = no money
"As of today the best streaming product available for the money is Paramount +hands down. NFLX is probably 4th after Amazon, Disney bundle, and Paramount +."
Losing subscribers left and right. That's What they get for pushing a liberal agenda! The majority of Americans are not liberals! No matter what the left-leaning media tells you everyday! Get woke go broke!!!!!!
Gotta “love” how Goldman upgrades yesterday causing the surge (probably sold millions of shares north of $550) only to have USB downgrade it this morn (probably bought millions of shares below $515)..these big boys run the business and is retail investors are their customers..but all good..have a solid chunk of shares going into earnings predicting a homerun..GL all!
Nobody is leaving netflix for such a minor price increase.
"Incase anyone is uncertain, yes, the selling is way overdone from both a technical and fundamental level. Technically, the MFI is below 20, way oversold. On the fundamentals, keep in mind that Q2 earnings, margins, and revenue were all in-line with forecast despite the fact that the subscriber forecast was missed by a million. That is a staggering achievement totally overlooked by the media. I expect Q3 to be a blowout so the next couplle months will likely be very choppy and should be viewed as a chance to add to positions rather than waiting for a sell point. The largest number of shares this year were purchased between 320 - 330 so look for resistance at or slightly above that level."
here come the climb XD
woke NFL and NBA is next.
Closing at 370.00 for the long weekend see you next week Tuesday. Let’s thanks ours troops for there hard work and dedication for there service. May God bless them all Thank you
"Earnings call Jul 16, 2018 3:00 PM PDT, I predict a nice recovery from today and a little run up above the 52 week prior to the call."
"Imagine stuck at home for an year and half, and suddenly travel and all those social activities come back... are you still gonna stay home and be a couch potato watching $NFLX?"
sinking
"German series Dark a Netflix original is rated most popular series on TV this week by IMDb (9.5 rating) and Rotten Tomatoes (100% critics rating, 99% audience rating). Netflix has attracted international subscribers with US produced content. Now they’re attracting US subscribers with foreign produced content."
"60 P/E, has few truly worthwhile competitors, misses subscriber expectations, down 7%.Tesla. 1000 P/E, plenty of better car manufacturers, let’s wait for a couple of stagnating earnings reports. Short Tesla"
Going to see 365 next week
Because VIAC has set itself up for streaming and content internationally it will have more growth and revenue in 2021. It is still providing content to NFLX but forming a better alignment with Amazon. For these reasons I think we will see a rotation out of NFLX and into VIAC over the next 6 to 8 months.
Why is it negative?
"Don't be fooled by the game Netflix plays by ""beating"" international subscriber estimates. Nearly all of the upside to international subscriber adds is generated from low GDP per capita countries like India, Indonesia, Malaysia, etc. Per member per month pricing in these regions is a fraction of what NFLX charges in the US and Europe."

Bubble has formed in the market again. Some stocks have gone up substantially due to short covering. Time to short now.
I guarantee you this. Anyone who leave Netflix will come back to netflix! They get board of the other platforms in 2 weeks
"Going higher, much higher."
$300 at max.

Nobody is going to cancel there Netflix. Only source of entertainment at home. It will be the LAST thing people drop. Skip 1-2 meals over the whole month or cancel my Netflix? Hmmmm. And who could afford to sign up for Disney and keep their Netflix account. Wow a while $16 a month. Those people must be rich LOL GO NFLX
Broke right through 50 day MA
Netflix is so overrated you have to wonder if they discovered some kind of mind control EMR during their average content.
"There's still no sign of a bottom yet, if the markets were even or down slightly the stock would have been down at least another two or three points. If this drops below 300, one bad tweet, a bad overall day for the markets, etc, the selloff could escalate very quickly."
Will be 1000 in 1.5 years
"TSLA beats numbers, NFLX will do the same"
I would like to know the same
"Having gotten back into NFLX for the first time in almost three months, it is good to see the stellar quality of the shorts posting on the Netflix thread. It bodes well for a long trade."
ROkU is much better.
"I have Netflix....frankly, I think it stinks. I only keep it for other members of the family. They are posting “new movies” that are 10 years old. The content is “eh” if you ask me. Most of the Netflix movies are B type movies with no name actors."
"Sony nice library, but Paramount better, India gobble up this ol’ Yank culture pulp"
it will be in the 450s in July dont worry.
Serious question. Anyone think this could sink to 230-240 by next week? or is 250 its baseline?
NFLX great company. we will be seeing $360 soon.
"Nothing changes, Netflix has only way up now.. they are leader in content, this stock is up tomorrow and goes until October, it is an entertainment company providing all types of content at minimal price, watch out for strategies they are going to come up with on advertisements, subscriptions and sign ups they have done, few negative comments will not change the progression of Netflix."
NFLX looks suspicious.She can explode tomorrow.
Looks like the longs have the advantage today. Let's see how the rest of the day shakes out.
Double top.
They had some interesting insights about NFLX on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
I’m keeping my call options 500++ until Wednesday.
Still Long and Strong! +-3$ its stable at 500$ :)
"After rising 24% for the week it closes right on the high. Year over year subscriber growth remains unchanged at 25% after raising prices and investors continue to figure out what it means. For instance, Netflix could double it's subscription fees and settle for only 5% subscriber growth. In a year revenue would be 30B/yr, profit before tax would be 16B/yr and PE 7. Adjust for a normal PE of 20 and the stock would be 785. We could see the stock continue to spike next week."
Netflix should make shows in stead of political statements
"All those companies that were supposed to be competition for NFLX, like DIS, they are just being completely left in the dust...."
Careful fellow shorts. NFLX went on a subscriber gain blitz giving away 3 month trials. Subscriber count will jump artificially.
There is an abundance of competition.
netflix now a studio. They need to keep the foot on the gas in producing original and compelling content. Only path forward for sustainability
"Trump, Economic Adviser Resigning.Tomorrow Market will Sell, Sell, SellThen... You Buy, Buy, Buy"
Cash flow positive not good news??
in 2015 shares were 700 before the 7 to 1 split. I noticed news media is not meeting this. so technically the stock is higher than amazon around well over $2800 a share since 2015. I'm still skeptical as to why everyone is downing the stock is there a catch....
"Netflix is the top dog, at first I was worried about Disney+ but than realized they might have goofed in naming their platform Disney. They can’t make movies for everyone and possibly ruin the “Disney” brand. Plus Netflix has a good pulse on what people like. Nowadays anime is the hot thing, they just need to continue investing in that."
Downgrade and MM is criminal actions and shall be prosecuted.
Good lord - ATT and Netflix have the same market cap. What an interesting stock market era
"If Trump stays quiet, NFLX 370 tomorrow. Let's hope so."
Solid guidance was given for future subscriber growth. People need to relax. Blips like this happen.
"LIKE I SAID, Social distancing not going away anytime soon. THEATERS DELAYED REOPENING, AND then we they do finally reopen, who wants to sit through an entire movie with a mask on? Yes, it’s safe, and the right thing to do. But many will avoid the hassle all together and just stay home and watch Netflix and Chill https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2020/06/19/coronavirus-amc-theatres-require-face-masks-customers/3221317001/"

"I may buy calls tomorrow. NFLX seems to be very strong. I'll decide tomorrow morning.(I mean, ""Shouldn't she be $320 by now?"" Well, she isn't? Why?)"
Maybe $400/share
"Can't find any news on it, why is it popping on heavy volume? Thx"
"People want to see Netflix lose. They missed the big run up in the stock (blame it on the fake news). It hurts knowing they missed out on big gains and seeing the stock sell off makes them feel better. The news is controlled by the big media companies who’s cable networks are losing subscribers to Netflix, so it’s best to do your own homework on Netflix."
"I can't believe how NFLX is performing this week. Looks like it's trying to get to Goldman Sachs new PT of $490 this month, lol!"
Monday will be a better day

"I got in at the dip to $485. Might buy back in. I get the whole ""too many streaming"" services - but I don't see this one going away. They still had profits and user growth - just not as MUCH as others wanted.I DO wonder what the future is for cable and content delivery - far too many options to have them all. I am one of those guilty parties that has always been with NFLX since the 1 disc mailer days @$4.95 a month. We also have HULU, Prime, & Disney+ WHILE paying for cable TV. I won't do CBS (pay) or any others wanting to charge. I'd rather just use my DVR services...I know there are other ways of doing this content thing.. Youtube+ etc.BUT I see many people just staying with 2-3 streamers (not just cutting down to 1) and I see NFLX staying in the top 3.As for stocks - I have VIAC (bought in with the merger and added shares as they dropped average price just under $30) LUCKILY I sold half my shares at $92. Also, DIS."

"Have Netflix investors been doing there reaserch? Netflix likes to be named a ""streaming business"", but in reality they are no more than a hosting website. Right now ONLY 8% OF THE PLATFORM CONTENT IS FROM NETFLIX ORIGINALS, and the other 92 PERCENT from other brands (Disney, WarnerMedia, COMCAST, ETC...) What happens when the big brands pull out and do there streaming platform? Will people pau $12 a month to see pathetic justice warriors shows and movies? I THINK NOT!"
up 10 bucks today .imho

Back to 330's by end week..
What was the revenue amount this quarter compared to this expectations?
amazed it went back up so quick. I sold my nibbling shares in AH back around 358-360. Well congrats to longs. Did not expect it to be so strong.
the party is about to begin!
Today’s daily trading pattern for Netflix has changed. The pump that follows the first 5 minutes was absent today.
"the guy has a massive short on $SHOP since 2 qtrs ago that drove the stock down below its 200D SMA and below $90. now that it was over $140 and he still hasn't covered, he needs to do something to help drive the stock down - and this is it. Left is a hack - a broken clock is right twice a day (he got Valeant right). oh, and how is his $NFLX short doing?"
"Be careful, it's going up."
Should Amazon buy Netflix?
"The demand for TV, online games, e-commerce, social networks, health TV, and online education increased significantly during the quarantine. Only in the first quarter, $Netflix increased 16m new users in the US -- about double the number in the previous quarter. Italians also increased their time spent on Facebook apps by 70 percent. After 2020, there will be significant growth in the upstream video data stream from the Internet of Things. AR holographic services are expected to generate massive demand between 2020 and 2025."
"I'm not worried too much about Disney. it reminds me when Google+ was trying to compete with Facebook. they finally gave up and closed the service for lack of popularity. if Netflix will give a good fight, people won't have a reason to switch over."
"Only question they asked when I ordered my NFLX Yacht, red or blue?"
"Almost bought this but instead put my money in the steady/dividend paying stocks like JNJ and Proctor & Gamble, i.e. consumer staples."
"Hard to buy puts with this kind of euphoria. There's a top, but it could be a blowoff top at $450 or $480."
I'm guessing $490-485 bottom...
"Oh boy, here we go!"
Its GONNA pop after earnings and i'm pretty sure we GONNA see 350 by next friday
The best in the world
Good news leaking out. People want IN!
Competing with apple Amazon Disney and Google what could go wrong!?
Bought 250 shares for a quick swing tmr. I’m not much of a swing trader I’m all about long term hold but with the ya these markets are at the moment who knows what’s gonna happen. With the months of April and may being the heart of the virus and everyone was home during that time we should expect phenomenal earnings... but who knows anymore.
I’ve been reading their quarterly reports for two years and the last two reports are concerning. It was enough for me to open a short position. Look at their recent growth and compare it to their multiples and it doesn’t add up. Throw in a heavy debt load and we’ll funded competition coming to market in the next year and I’m happy to be short
I canceled Netflix for Disney + and HBO. Just sayin. Should've picked up Terranova when they had the chance.
this stock always falls on the aftermarket..)). Weak stock.. Netflix has no chance after ER to go to 600
"haven't seen SonnyBlack around here in a while. I kind of miss his daily forecast of ""back to pre-covid level"" that he's being saying since April... perhaps he just gave up, covered his position and moved on"

"MarketWatch 21 JanuaryGoldman Sachs expects strong results and steeper gains in paid global subscription additions. On Tuesday, it hiked its Netflix ) price target to $450 per share from $400 per share, implying 32% upside for Netflix ( NFLX) , which closed at $339.67 per share on Friday.Netflix's ( NFLX ) deep roster of movies and shows in the fourth quarter should propel its fourth-quarter subscription additions to 9.7 million -- well above guidance of 7.6 million -- Goldman Sachs senior equity analyst Heath Terry predicted in a note to clients."

"NFLX maintainted Overweight rating on the shares with a $634 price target.Netflix's 2021 film slate ""marks a more pronounced shift toward quality,"" as its 70 films have increased star power from the likes of Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, Leonardo DiCaprio, Meryl Streep and Denzel Washington, KeyBanc analyst Justin Patterson tells investors in a research note. The analyst believe Netflix's scale has made direct-to-streaming a more compelling distribution option for actors and directors, particularly as COVID-19 weighs on global box office revenue. If Netflix can succeed in film, its lifetime subscriber value can increase due to improved retention and pricing power, predicts Patterson. The analyst keeps an Overweight rating on the shares with a $634 price target."
the irony that the current price is the same as June 1st 2018. that's only 45 days ago. so it will recover back up 18 dollars since aftermarket low
Options are on calls to beat 52 week high. Which would be the +10%. I guess we’ll see what the report brings.

"Down by a little over 1 % in a bleeding market, whats all the fuzz about??"

I like netflix as a service and investor. But swing trading this thing I shorted it all the way up to 593. What people don't realize is it surged way too high and fast for the short term..... the potential buybacks are not for sure and won't be for a long while. They are also in a catch 22 with covid since the subscribers have surged due to covid but they are also running much behind on new content also due to covid = catch 22. I have already watched everything I can possibly find on there and I'm cancelling after the second price increase for the service taking place only a few months apart until they have a ton of the new anticipated releases which all have no actual dates on them. I think many will follow like myself and no way this price keep sup this high until it dips way lower. Though I do think it will come back up but maybe not until end of year.
I have a question. I'm looking at the nasdaq right now and looking at the 3 year/weekly chart. I see that when there is a huge negative event that occurs that the nasdaq corrects to the 200 sma line. 2 events I see were 12/24/18 & 3/23/20. If the treasury yields rises to very high levels does that mean at the very least that the nasdaq will correct the 50 sma line? The 50 sma and 200 sma line are stretched extremely far apart right now which is telling me that assets are hyper inflated as well. Wouldn't these 2 lines eventually snap back closer together? They don't like to stay too far apart from each other.$msft $goog $amzn $fb $twtr $nflx

Anyone seen a buy out number floating around. Once we see people speculating on a premium price then something simmering.
it will be in the green $14 today
Nothing more than a casino. That's all the market is. $50 swings in this stock over the course of weeks and none of it having to do with the company itself.
Maybe Sleepy will include a grant for $NFLX in his infrastructure bill.
"Extremely high PE...bubble waiting to pop. Mounting competition with better access to capital. $NFLX will be priced out of the market by competitors. I bought long $290 puts, free money."

I sold this stock at $534 months ago because the only thing it knows how to do is go down.
Something about this does not sit well. I love the Bollywood content but they are skimping on quality. Ive been long for 4 years and sold. Prove me wrong and ill buy my 8k shares back.

They likely worth $250B valuation in 3 year as it become clear that it's wining market share. (WIth so much superhits kids content, Sports It sure going to take over market share).Apple is disruptor and can take huge pile of money to take over market.

The market has corrected and nflx is oversold. Will go back to over 300 quickly.

"Ted Sarandos Says Covid Safety Protocols Are Generating Surprising Savings For NetflixSarandos revealed that Netflix has seen a surprising upside to the layers of pandemic procedureSarandos said Netflix shoots, such as The Witcher and Sex Education, are now “mostly up and running” — and sets are running more efficiently as people adapt to new ways of working. People are also not falling prey to pre-pandemic illnesses, such as the flu, he added in a wide-ranging interview.“Because of all these safety protocols and people being very supportive of these safety protocols, productions run much smoother, so you actually save some shooting days sometimes. Shooting days are shorter, the sets are better run, there’s fewer people on sets sometimes, which keeps the trains running on time,” he said.https://deadline.com/2020/10/ted-sarandos-covid-protocols-are-generating-savings-for-netflix-1234595726/"
very predicable..... this is a $150 stock and will be there soon..
"360 yet? Oh okay, it is fine it will close above 360"
Needham analyst Laura Martin downgraded Netflix (NFLX) from hold to underperform.
There are free streaming services out there better than Netflix.
"The 40% correction was healthy after a 5 fold move up in only 2 years. But when it rebounded it was too soon for new highs to be made, so we had to retest the lows. Now the stock is ready to make new highs after they report record subscriber adds."
It's over for Netflix and it's growth trajectory. To much competition in this space.

"If there is trade deal on Monday, we will see 320."
Up 44 percent since December 24th. Up 103 points. And still room to run up to the all time high 423. Earnings report and guidance will blast NFLX up. Award winning product. Superior subscriber growth. A+++++++
breaking: Canaccord reiterates Buy rating and $550 price target on Netflix shares.Netflix content leadership poised to persist. Canaccord analyst Maria Ripps noted streaming video has seen a surge in consumption over recent months and Netflix shares have reflected this momentum. She expects the company to deliver another strong quarter as it continues to benefit from investments in original content and broader industry tailwinds.
With the major studios like Disney and Paramount and others launching their own services it proves there's plenty of room in the streaming ecosystem. The pie is expanding.

"This is similar to Tesla. Tesla disrupted autos and now everyone is following them and saying “competitors” will hurt Tesla. Netflix disrupted movies/shows/series content and now everyone is following them and saying “competitors” will hurt Netflix. Tesla and Netflix are both innovators in their space, have brand loyalty, and are market leaders, their pace of innovation and experience will keep them market leaders in their respective fields for years to come"
look at that comeback though
NFLX business model is similar to Movie pass ..I shorted 350 shares at 377 .
"Entire Netflix Investors are living in different world and ignoring all detail about Disney Streaming.They are preparing lot of new content along with lots and lots of quality old content just for Streaming. This is not launch of Hulu or Amazon Prime Video where limited or low quality or old content only available.I think NFLX likely end around 250-275 at year end (Even assuming there is no market crash) If crashed, then 160-170 is easy as well."

"Hilarious. Netflix is basically Blockbuster....with a $150 BILLION market cap! Debt is soaring, content acquisition costs are soaring, future content commitments are in the BILLIONS, the company has NEGATIVE $500 million in cash flow. Meanwhile, the company only loses as ""little"" as it does because it pushes the cost of broadband onto ALL broadband customers, not just Netflix customers. The big cable companies still have tons of cash and lots of very powerful political connections. And they don't appreciate subsidizing their competitor. The political risk to Netflix is high. If the cable company lobbyists ever succeed in allowing differential internet access pricing based on bandwidth usage, Netflix will be crushed. Meanwhile, there are 4X more TV shows produced per year now than just 15 years ago. So Netflix's original content is less of a special selling point because there is a content glut out there. Meanwhile, guess who is Netflix's biggest competitor? Amazon! LOL. Betting on a company to beat Amazon or even survive the onslaught from Amazon would be risky enough at a cheap valuation. But Netflix trades at like 300 TIMES EBITDA. I think Netflix the company will survive, but there is a very real chance of the equity getting wiped out to zero at some point in the next 5 years. LOL. This valuation is absolutely hilarious. Even a run of the mill correction of 20% in the stock market will take overvalued Netflix down by 50%.Right now the stock is as high as it has ever been. Everyone has been excited about Netfix for years. But today's price shows people more optimistic than they have EVER been on ANY other day. Buyer beware!"
It seems I made huge mistake being on wrong side of the trade when it got dropped to $336. I shorted with my big savings at $338 and since then this never came back. I knew DIS has yet time and also NFLX was on pressure for few months and that it could bounce any time. I got trapped badly. Not sure when this will return but I’m scared now... 
"Golden days for Netflix are over. This sector is very competitive and crowded. I exited my full position after today's results,"
Spending almost half a billion on a show pretty much nobodies heard about. Wow.
$410 by Sept 6!
Every FANG stock up significantly today except the one the crushed earnings. Something seriously wrong with that picture.
Well looks like my buy at 384 yesterday looks pretty good today.
Netflix will buy CBS/Viacom and buy the biggest tv and movie library ever created in history. CBS has 75 year history of tv and movies and unlimited content to feed into Netflix. CBS also has paid streaming service with Pluto tv with 15 million subscribers growing 100% and worth 15 billion by itself. Entire market cap of CBS/Viacom only 11 billion and CBS network alone worth 33 billion. Netflix doubles revenue in first year and accretive to eps first year. Deal is 0.19 a share in Netflix stock and a $7 cash coupon.
nflx just touched the upward trend support line its bound to now touch the resistance line which is at 349-350. If it Follows the pattern we will possibly see 345+ tomorrow.
NFLX faces too much competition. It is impossible to expand its business anymore.
down because of downgrade from buy to neutral price target raise to 425 though.
All indicators are pointing to a 200 point drop tomorrow. Sub $100 easily.
Netflix will beat earnings because 4th quarter is their strongest quarter historically
Going down again.

Ready for a strong break out over 320 finally?! Big day!
"This is not good, I know someone who works there, I will see if I can get a little insight. I know one thing, I bought some, because international growth was supposed to be very good........376, down she went, back up she went, over 376. Here we are again, BUYING OPPORTUNITY? Maybe not. NFLX would be very smart to buy SIX FLAGS, are they then afraid a like Disney model may rate them as ""second rate"".The deal with the Obama's was a joke. It's funny, they, they criticize Trump who made all his money before he got elected, but Bite me, the chosen one, all of ""them"" made it AFTER they left office. Who are the crooked ones?"

Anyone have an explanation for the AH plunge of almost $4.00? Did some analyst trash it?
If it closes over +19.79 it will be the greatest NON-earnings day ever.
Predication. Netflix killings earnings. Releases earnings after market. Post market traders load up and sell premarket. Ends day up 4% giving hope for $600. Falls back to where it is now.
Paramount + better than Netflix. Just that simple.
This is a clear purchase beneath 550. Netflix is still a staple of society at this point and the streaming entertainment takeover is still underway. This will reach high 500s before mid August. especially after their signature earnings 10% drop
"For the naysayers (and the longs who know a good company and investment when they see one):Netflix is a positive cash flow company, they are making money hand over fist. They currently owe more than they make, but as they gain subscribers (projected 200+ million by 2020) and pay the debt down NFLX will become one of the wealthiest companies on the planet. Companies borrow money all the time, even blue chip companies, to invest in growth and infrastructure. FB borrowed a ton of money before they were net positive, so did Sirius XM and AMZN. The math is there, and it's simple, that's why the stock price is what it is, with 79%+ institutional investment. The institutional investment wouldn't be so high if the banks didn't see a golden goose. Shorties just want to try and drive the price down with nonsense so they can make a 4-5% gain here or there, while us longs are already up over 100% on the year. I know what side I'd rather be on with this stock. The shorts are going to get burned and then cry that it's manipulation or some other nonsense. It's hilarious how no matter how well a stock is doing, there is always the ""sky is falling"" types that cry doom and gloom. If they'd care to take a look at numbers, NFLX only has a 4.5% short interest on its share float. That's literally like saying 4.5 out of 100 people think the stock is going to go down in the short term. That's extremely low. Most shorters don't have the stomach to watch a 5-10% rise above their short price, and they close with a loss; that is going to happen with the short float leading up to earnings, and we might get a nice little 2-3% squeeze on top of the next rally. If you shorties were confident in your position you wouldn't be on here day after day, hour after hour, posting non-stop ""armageddon is coming"" nonsense. But hey, good luck."
Could be wrong but I think this may have finally bottomed out. If you sold it may be a good time to buy back in. Just where my thought process is at
Just sold. this is going below 350
Held sideways all day. Wonder how many start the selloff in 10 minutes to lock in profits since it's not going any higher/
NETFLIX is going to surprise all of you with there blow out earnings.

"Netflix is growing and adding content which costs money. CEO is brilliant. If shares dip more than a couple percent today I am ""definitely"" loading up."

"Netflix price target raised to $634 from $590 at KeyBancKeyBanc analyst Justin Patterson raised the firm's price target on Netflix to $634 from $590 and keeps an Overweight rating on the shares. The company's second half of 2020 subscriber additions are on track for 9M, which is above consensus, Patterson tells investors in a research note. Further, KFL Data and Google search queries suggest churn concerns may be overblown, and Netflix's international momentum remains strong, says the analyst."
Big up day tomorrow to 330-334. Then up all next week into earnings. Then great earnings and great guidance for 2019. What a great time the next 2 weeks will be. Happy Happy Joy Joy ! ! ! ! 400 in a month. then question will be: WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?
"Lots of talk about Netflix high valuation. Netflix value is how it is valued by its investors, nothing out of the ordinary as this is how the stock market works. Some will say Netflix value is too high......but on what basis? What are your credentials that qualify you to value this stock.....have you owned a billion dollar company such as Netflix? In the end no article, no person has any authority nor credibility in valuing Netflix from a distance unless you are on the inside with the decision makers of the company. In the end everyone is speculating, but I do know that the street knows best....if it see Netflix is more valuable than Disney.....the NetFelix is more valuable than Disney."
Current price says they will blow away subscriber guidance so the stock will move up or down based on guidance going forward. What I am looking forward to is the day they report profits that are 2x more than expected. The stock will gap up 20% and then go on to double and triple in the months that follow as investors realize the unprecedented profitability of TV on a global scale.
hits just keep on comingNetflix to release Final Fantasy Live-Action showhttps://www.esquire.com/lifestyle/a28210413/final-fantasy-netflix-show/
when there is no buying stock falls. I think there is a small gap from 508 to 517 so I think ti will be covered and then it may stock to go up.
"Double down on my short at 319 premarket. 1200 short which is limit. Plan to cover 2/3 around $302. and will also sell remaining cover put. Not sure when this will go to 302 but if remain strong, I will see out of money puts again. (Should have sold put on Friday but didn't thought $300 milestone consider so strong + greedy Analyst will jump to add fuel as much as they can)I am down $12K now in this run with this unexpected raise but I am not worry as all those Buyout talk is just to find more fool.Only problem is if I get uncomfortable with losses so I have to keep selling put to keep loss in control. Which I will do that."
"If scale is the most important factor then Netflix’s lead appears to be insurmountable: Netflix $26 billion/yr, Hulu $5 billion/yr, Dis+ $4 billion/yr."
"Remember Blackberry RIMM? At one time it was ""the"" leader of the stock market. NFLX is next RIMM"
A FEW people are scared and dumping the stock but not institutional holders. Shorts have more to loose than the longs over the next couple years. There is NOTHING fundamentally different about nflx today than three weeks ago. This stock will recover at next ER with plenty of upside thereafter. Have seen this movie over a decade of owning APPL.
"Waiting to buy, when to pull the trigger is the question"
"SIX day unbeaten streak continues! Best close since Dec. 13, 2018 (276.02)Last time it went 6 days in a row without a RED day was 8 in a row back in Jan. of last year. From the 18th to the 29th.up 37.32 during this run. The 8 day run was 67.09.Got up 8.13 right off the bat and then down 3.23. Glad the NFLX does not care about Iphones!Tomorrow, we see if the Friday slump is indeed over."
I suggest everyone to watch the conference call. Extremely bullish. You should be buying any weakness aggressively! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14FSz69Aerc
I'm out with solid gain
most ppl now understand u only need to have Netflix 1 or 2 months a year. these subscriber Numbers gonna implode
"Sacred games from Netflix was aired this week in India and it’s already become the house of cards, way to go nflx"
"Maybe not this week or month, maybe not even this year. But fairly soon this will inevtiably end very badly people. like 60% down. Companies don't maintain these valuations, especailly one who simply streams TV shows/movies."
So missed on subscribers but killed earnings and gets hit like this. I guess more bought out than call options! I didn’t see that at close
What do you think after the report?
I never bought NFLX before...Is this a good price or it will go down more tomorrow?
"Futures are way up, so much for predictions of WW3 and a big drop in the market, Nflx will open up +10 tomorrow and climb from there. Congratulations to all you Longs that bought on Friday!!"
I am raising target from 650 to 780 on this.
"Hello Jack, If you think NFLX is mostly politically correct entertainment it is good you cancelled. Hope you didn't sell your stock. I am an analyst and I have been predicting NTFLX climbs to $1000. Save a little and watch it climb."
Time to buy?
The service Netflix provides is great; personally I do like to watch Netflix. But the valuation of Netflix is steep and implies a much higher growth rate.
NFLX stock is pretty resilient today. Lets see how the final 30 minutes goes.
"Free Disney+ is a good thing for Netflix. If NFLX customers were thinking about cancelling their service in favor of D+, now they may be less inclined to do so since there will be no additional expenses. This gives Netflix more runway to produce compelling content to retain viewership."
just hold it till the Q3.. will back in a month. stop checking everyday. check once a week more relax.
Stock price overreaction to price increase. Price increases do not always help the company. Many other choices exist today.
Wait till they announce live sports streaming...

"At least we outpaced Amazon, Disney, Apple with more then 3 times today. Says enough about what investors think about streaming."
20M subs in Q2. See you new highs!
"It up $2 billion in market cap in the premarket.Time to shut down the premarket trading, hey SEC.The earnings reported for the year is about a half a billion dollars.If they wanted to buy it, they would have held it down to buy it.And there has been a substantial outflow as the stock goes up."
"from the release. Bear case has blown up.""We believe we are very close to being sustainably FCF positive. For the full year 2021, we currentlyanticipate free cash flow will be around break even (vs. our prior expectation for -$1 billion to breakeven). Combined with our $8.2 billion cash balance and our $750m undrawn credit facility, we believew eno longer have a need to raise external financing for our day-to-day operations."""
"why is the ""Top Reaction"" still ""Cold weather mean indoor movies."" Hahahah LMAO. Please, let's get new reactions.Netflix is hot right now. The upgrades are coming for a reason. They are very well positioned. If Netflix needed to raise cash, they are easily able to do so. These are smart people on the board, this is an investment, not a cash cow. I think they should raise our pricing 2-$3.00 per account. They have produced a product people love and yearn for more of. It makes sense, while still keeping the cost of subscriptions relatively low. Me personally, would rather pay a couple dollars more, than see ad pop-up's everywhere. Thoughts?"
People got scared and sold last week. Must be crying now.
"$NFLX must be DOWN by at least 45% today alone, after such terrible results! It is INSANE that the Government is preventing the Collapse of Netflix BUBBLE!The fair value of NFLX is $25.00 per share!"
"I was for a long time hesitant to invest in Netflix because of the amount of money they have to keep reinvesting in original content. Then, I read one commenter saying that the two best things about Netflix are the growth in subscribers numbers and the low ""churn"" rate, and compared this to the highly competitive environment that telecom companies experience. Telecom companies chase for new subscribers and highly desire low churn for many reasons. This got me thinking that it must this low churn that allows the company to forecast projects with some level of financial confidence. To summarize, I now have few shares and am considering adding more."
Netflix will 660 soon

What happened? Why down so much? I saw it filled the gap down and now money manager can drive it below 500 ?
"NO REASON FOR IT UP LIKE THIS, TILRAY, PART 2"
"""No good deed goes unpunished."" NFLX asks dormant accounts if they still want to subscribe and stock takes a haircut. Of course at current valuations, it doesn't take much to spark a drop in price."
"Some people are saying that NFLX earnings are not going to meet expectations, yet a majority of the nation (~328 Million), are told to stay home... while at the same time movie theatre’s are being shut down. Am I missing something here? To me this looks like a Great opportunity for NFLX to take over the market. They just bought out the Paris theatre in NYC so that they can begin to have their movies/shows receive Oscas, what makes you think they wouldn’t do the same with AMC or Regal? Someone please enlighten me because all I see is upside from here."
All the way back to Nov
The drama created by NFLX trading before earnings is more entertaining than anything streaming on NFLX.
"ViacomCBS down 3 to 32 on a 3% drop in revenue. ViacomCBS peaked at 70 in 2013, the same year Netflix started producing its own content."
"C-man looking for next big thing to replace FANG. How about this; Apple, Square, Snap, Hewlett-Packard, Amazon, Twitter?"
I heard about NFLX the other day on (http://Rightpicker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
"i was long and i sold today at 359, i lost 4k . and i hate to see netflix go down to 330 again because i was down a lots at 330. this stock market now is shaky. and iam out on the side line now . iam going to buy again and hold for a long time. but i want to get in the right price. so many swings from 372 to 330 then 386 to 356, and lets dont talk about the 340 and 318. stay strong if u can. good luck to all."

"NFLX TARGET RAISED TO $310.Netflix Poised to Extend Lead Despite Content Glut -- Barron's Blog2/2018- DJNFBy Jon SwartzDespite an increasingly crowded field for content, Netflix (NFLX) is poised to extend its content and distribution tentacles over the next 12 to 18 months.GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives bases his bullish assessment on Netflix's ""competitive moat,"" franchise appeal, ability to increase international streaming customers through 2020, and originalcontent. He gives it a Highly Attractive rating and raised its price target from $255 to $310 to reflect stronger-than-expected net subscription additions and international growth through 2018.Shares of Netflix are up 3% to $273.91 today.Ives expects Netflix to spend $7 billion to $8 billion on content this year, up about $1 billion from its spending trajectory for 2017. About one-third will go toward original content in 2018, with a long-term target of 50% by 2020.As more consumers eschew cable for streaming delivery, Netflix should anticipate heightened competition from larger media players such as Disney (DIS) and 21st Century Fox (FOXA), pure-play competitors such as Amazon.com (AMZN), and new potential entrants like Apple (AAPL).""The holy grail of incremental growth (and profitability) going forward will be from international customers as we believe Netflix has a [total addressable market] of over 700M subs by 2020,"" Ives wrote in his note. ""With the company spending major resources over the last two years building out a global distribution arm and customer base in over 100 countries, we believe the fruits of this labor will start to be fully realized in 2018 and beyond as evidenced again by the strong international performance in 4Q."""
OmG!!! Its down 1.5% how is this possible?

CYA longs
Pandemic brought results forward. They will pay the price this year.
"Netflix looking to hire to expand in video games, The Information says In recent weeks, Netflix (NFLX) has approached ""veteran game industry executives"" about joining the company as it looks toward an expansion into videogames, reported The Information's Nick Wingfield and Jessica Toonkel, citing people familiar with the situation. The streaming giant has ""already dabbled in games"" with the help of an outside developer, but is now looking at boosting its investments in the category, the report said. Publicly traded companies in the video game publishing and hardware space include Activision Blizzard (ATVI), Electronic Arts (EA), GameStop (GME), Nintendo (NTDOY), Take-Two (TTWO), Tencent (TCEHY) and Ubisoft (UBSFY)."
"Netflix king of streaming services, Numbers dont lie"
$DIS and $NFLX would soon realize that $VIAC is the key to success. Whoever buys $VIAC would be king of streaming
Netflix stock is a JOKE. You'd need to be certifiably insane to stay with this.
"If my friend sells all his NFLX shares for $394, he would walk away with $32K. But the prospect of NFLX rising to $500 is very tempting. Should my friend sell? or Not? Whats your opinion?"
"They said on the radio that the loss of some 700,000 subscriptions was shockingly due to people quitting Netflix after the following announcement:""Former President Barack Obama formally announced on Monday a multiyear production deal with Netflix in which he and the former first lady, Michelle Obama, will produce television shows and films for the streaming service.""""The deal will give Mr. Obama an international television platform during his post-presidency, allowing him to reach millions of people in the United States and internationally. The couple has created “Higher Ground Productions,” a company to produce content for Netflix, the streaming service announced.""He might have won the presidency, but I can see why people might be bothered and even angered by this. Obama can be a very polarizing guy who comes across as a partisan know-it-all, always preaching about what Americans should do and not do, say and not say, while he laughs from his ivory tower at all our little problems which he says we cause and he doesn't have.Sorry I really like Netflix so I wish I had better news."
Sentiment from two weeks ago has not changed on this stock when it was at $385. It was the computer algos that sold it off in addition to the weak hands that took quick profits on that latest run-up. ZERO direct exposure to China. Stay strong longs and buy any weakness.
PS. You can sell one share of NFLX and buy 17 shares of VIAC with a 3.5% dividend - this will hedge your bet.. VIAC is slated to beat estimates by >20 cents in 2 weeks. Streaming has grown 74% last quarter.
I'm so tempted to add more shares....
I'm holding this stock till $1 or $1000.
This is what you get if you buy tulips
"Some people says there are 1.9B house hold and so Netflix can grow much further.Now this exact point I think netflix will never able to grow above 200M level even while growing so fast currently.Here is reason:-out of those 1.9B house hold, 80% people don't make more than $10/day. This mean possible house holds who can afford Netflix service or Netflix like service is <400MNow in market like USA where most make more than $10/day, They have hard time achieving 40% penetration and marketing cost already ballooning. So I don't think Netflix able to achieve 50% overall (Even when you count 2-3% of those poor subscribe & include here.) You reach <200M max. With Service from Disney , Apple, HBO, HULU, Youtube, Facebook and 100's of other countries local, I think 50% penetration is great achievement and that put to 200M max at current price. If they reduce subscriber price than it's different deal but will market allow that. It will cause 30% haircut in no time."
"We will see what the bottom is. And where it goes from there. I am still a firm believer of this company. Have 205 @186 i bought a while back. And now 40 extra @ 336. Netflix grows very fast, content is getting better and better. And kids don't know any better these days then that Netflix is available. They grow up with it. Just like Mc Donalds, Coca cola etc."
"Amazing run, but it’s over. Competition and boredom with NFLX is setting in. Fubo, ZM, Roku will all fall."
so... ROKU is eating $NFLX lunch?
is this the beginning of our run into earnings?
"This will be Junk . I do not think they will even be able to hold the attention of anyone with the Junk they are putting out and the old movies everyone has already seen , Oh but the Oscars were really great ?"
we gonna copy Amazon tomorrow.
Dow futures climbing after hours.
Why do you guys come on here every single day to say this thing is crashing to (insert dollar amount) by (insert date)? It’s only gone up. It goes up every single time you guys say it’s crashing.
"As supply goes up, price goes down. Which way has supply of content gone? That is NFLX only revenue stream. They will be overtaken by the big players with huge Free cash flow from other revenue streams."
This is so far below the 200 day moving average. How much lower is this going to go?
Feels more likely to me that it'll snap back to it's 50-day than for it to continue lower. Also I think the S&P and Nasdaq look poised from a chart perspective to continue up this week. NFLX is due for a rally back to that 50-day.
bought 40 shares at 333.26. I set a limit sell for first thing in the morning at 360
"400 may be here sooner than planned, get on board or get left in the dust...."
I just wish Netflix would start sending disks or make downloads available of old movies again. I used to go in after the Oscar awards and order every movie that was nominated for something the following year. Can't do that any more.
be ready for filling the GAP tomorrow! :D
Content producers need Netflix it’s the only way to access viewers. The viewers are coming to their streaming platforms. They make more money licensing their content to Netflix.
Full Disclosure: Hulu only reduced the cost of their ad supported package. Charge less per month but increase the amount of ads. Great strategy until customers figure it out!
Buy AMC before it takes off.
this is the easiest short in the history of the market with netflix not doing free 1 month trial memberships they will have a collapse in new subscriber growth and that will kill its bottom line in about 3 months nflx will be a $90 stock if your lucky perhaps even lower like $60
Jim Cramer says he's not fond of NFLX - I'm buying a bunch more.
any legit reason this off 5 points?
"So, really what changed with the fundamentals of this company since yesterday, that merits an over 4% drop.?"
"After half a year of following this stock I finally managed to convince myself to buy 2 shares at 553,04 each. I hope this will go to 1000 this year. We will see :)"

This is easily one of the most over valued stocks on the market right now.
What’s a better buy? Fb or Nflx?
Nflx will be over 400 after earnings. As expected evil analyst wants Cheatham shares
Ha ha ha. Only 3% down. Going green tomorrow.
The boycott and divest campaign continues to push the share price down!!!!Keep up the good work!!!
Out of gas
"Today is the start, market will be going up till Christmas."
"This stock could drop 70% and still be overvalued lol. It’s literally the biggest bubble in the stock market. Worth more than Ford, GM and TSLA combined with negative $3B cash flow"
Oh my god I love Netflix
"I get why people are skeptical but at the end of the day I’m 26 and I don’t know one person who doesn’t have Netflix. Forget cable, I think streaming services will replace cable fully. Why just have one? You can have 4 or 5 steaming services and get more content than cable for the same if not cheaper. Plus the vertical integration aspect that Netflix has. Good content made in house. I’m bullish"
It has lost 37.06 in the past four days. That is the 2nd worst four day total ever.It dropped 39.43 from July 17 to the 20.That was the four days after the July earnings were announced
"Disney is not going to be able to outspend AT&T and Amazon who both lost to Netflix. Forget about it, let it go. Netflix has won and will become one of the most profitable companies of all time."
This won't drop until volume picks up. For some reason all of the negative press hasn't had a major impact.
That was an amazing turnaround
Can we go 4 in row?
Just signed up for NFLX plus bought more stock.
Lower volumes recently - here's to higher volumes and higher levels for nflx
"Lets hope that meet expectations in earnings this time, with markets being ""toppy"", I don't think investors and M. funds will be as forgiving."
"5th greatest day ever!Two of them have come in the last 11 days. The 24.28 high was the 6th best ever.

"I bought split adjusted at $8, and sold several hundred K worth over past 5 years. It hurst to see the remaining holding down so much. But, I just need to remind myself that I am way ahead on this one despite today's debacle."
Here is one analyst history of price target.GBH:-1/17:- Raise from 235 to 2552/15:- Raise to 3153/8:- Raise to $375 5/17:- Raised again to $4006/18:- Raised to $500.First does yearly price target change so much???? 5 time in 5 month.So what common theme about this Analyst???? price reach with in $10-$15 of previous target. Can you believe this?I guess we should start 20 firm with different price target on stock we love and hot in market and put computer who keep announce price target increase when last price target reach with in $10.
Netflix is the king no one can touch then great job Netflix
"I think this election today could def affect NFLX. If the lefties get in, watch for strict lockdowns (which will be good for NFLX). I used to laugh at the conspiracies when both sides in the past would scream about election stealing and fraud, but with what I saw the DNC do in the primaries in 2016, and from what came out in my own state a few short years ago (and there were prosecutions) I don't laugh anymore. The DEMS really could steal this thing...."
I'm buying tomorrow
"I covered now so buy, lol."
"this is communist company supporting far left, they have to go to zero."
"Earnings were better than expected. Additional subscriber numbers faltered when people got Spring fever and came out of hibernation after an extended long, long winter. Analysts #$%$ their pants. Selling ensued. Panic reigned high. Stock tanked. Incidentally, Netflix is still the same fortified leader in streaming content it was before the 2Q earnings report. Disney will take some time to properly compete---even then, humans are not quick to change habits"
And then 390 coming
"Gz on 300! I'm not in this stock anymore since $200 but I love the company, but 50% up in 2 months seems a bit too fast, I'm looking to get back in someday at the right time."

Today I am taking the day off."
"high volume drop yesterday, low volume rally today with the market up. under $300 by the end of next week"
Lots of positive articles about NFLX these past few days. I bet large stakeholders are laying a groundwork for getting out by selling to the retail.
The growth story is finally overSee u at a 8 pe
Rocco Pendola was way ahead of his time. Wonder where he's bartending these days?

"NFLX is one of the world’s greatest companies. The stock won’t stay down for long. It’ll soon be back to its highs, and go up from there.It’s a great time to buy. I’m a long term holder, bought at $423 and holding for $5000."

how does nflx data center work and and what company do they use for their memory operation and hardware.would like to invest in what makes nflx great.also am considering buying IQ any ideas?
My chinese fortune cookie told me my investment would bring me more than expected 
"People look into past growth and think growth will just continue.Business like Subscription normally had sudden stop or even negative growth. I think Netflix is candidate in year or so. Netflix has bigger problem because it allow to share accounts and so very hard to tell how many unique household using it. Sure those free with Cable and T-Mobile going to help for time being.AOL is prime example where it taking millions of subscriber ever month and then suddenly go to pause. While Market value crash more to do hype it was into market, Subscriber pause and decline has nothing to do with Market, It's just it monetize most of subscriber.HBO is another example:- 2010 to 2014 it grown to 80M to 142M then suddenly drop next year. Since then its stable around 145M.I think Netflix is next. We just don't know when that going to hit but market cost raise concerning for sure. And those Cable offering free netflix going to delay that problem as well but it's trojan horse and they will use it when Netflix at worst position."
"Netflix has the whole world to conquer. International market expansion is only beginning in places like India, Asia, South America and Europe. Investor should feel confident that Facebook and Apple are interested in investing and partnering with Netflix. This is a good stock to buy. Coming news will reflect this. NFLX for those with a vision of the future as seen by Facebook and Apple."
350.00 coming
Was there ever a doubt that Derek Chauvin would be convicted of all charges and have the book thrown at him with the media convicting him and rioting looming? Just saying..............

"Wall Street can get all excited about a substantial price increase, but as a user I'm not paying anymore than I'm currently paying for the service. This means I will stop using Netflix, and sign up with Amazon or others. There's a lot of competition. I'm not the only one quitting Netflix, I spoke with about 25 people in our company who agree with me. I don't own Netflix as a stock."
So nice to settle into a place that everyone’s happy with. .. Let’s all just take a deep breath and share a big hug. :)
A DIP of LESS than 1 % for the WEEK...GOLD-backed Cryptocurrency STOCK... Do your investment acct a favor.
I can't believe its only down 4% as we speak. Absolutely INCREDIBLE!!!
They increased $2 monthly on 80-100 million subs. Thats 2.4 billion off 3 billion yearly debt. Numbers still dont add up. They need minimum $5 price increase to offset cost/debt to start to have positive cash flow. But at that price they wont be competitive anymore and will need to spend more to retain customers. And at this point Its not a growth stock anymore and it shouldnt be trading at 100+ PE.
I AM HOLDING A HUGE POSITION (seven digits). SO FAR -5% loss. Shall I sell or hold longer ? Thanks for advice!!!
So many stocks bled out today... I think market is heading for a major correction. Market is extremely top heavy and over valued right now and will correct itself IMO. Not looking forward to September...
"“Over the next 5 years subscription growth will accelerate once 5G becomes available. Anyone within range of a cell tower signal will have access to affordable broadband Internet, which is what's needed for NFLX. That will make NFLX the most ""affordable luxury"" in virtually every corner of the planet, especially in areas where local TV choices have been traditionally very limited. The result will be an explosion in non-US subscriptions, which we're already starting to see evidence for in the most recent couple of quarters.This growth will, in turn, further accelerate the decline in traditional TV viability as ""cord cutting"" becomes pervasive. Expect continued upside ""surprises"" as this industry transformation continues. All good news for NFLX shareholders.”"
"The stock can easily surge 20 points on another positive subscriber survey, do not miss out. JMHO"

"why would Netflix go up on news that Apple is likely to have a major streaming bundle soon?to dump shares, since they can"
"I did a big mistake today. I’m still a amateur in stocks, bought Netflix at 520$. The stock started dropping and very fast. I panicked and sold it at 505$ to cut my losses but now it’s back at 524$. Not very happy with myself but learned my lesson."
Doing just fine
will bottom at around $350...by Wed...and close at around $360 by Friday...another tough week

Business insider: Disney and Netflix to partner up for world wide streaming.
Share of this stock are “less owned” says JP morgan. Im not sure where they get this stuff? “Insulated from regulatory and data privacy concerns.” Says who!!?!? I doubt NFLX is setting the standard in these areas. The subscriber growth is all this stock has..
"NFLX is translating existing content for India, Asia, South America, Europe. Huge growth opportunity."
LoL 512.. what a magic trick is that
stock should be down more than -10%....tomorrow another -10% drop
Slowly but surely this becomes a mature stock that follows its own path. Not so much up and down with the faang stock or the market anymore. Nice to see.
Would be nice to see hedge funds reallocating from apple to NFLX a few billion can go long way for netflix.
Strange day.First back to back red days since Oct. 8-9.Up 9.99 for the week. Best week since Oct. 7-11High was 293.49 on Wednesday and low 277.35 on MondayWas down 4.39 at one point. Hit a big spike at 1:21 that put it in the green for a few minutes.3 of 5 days this week in red. Two of them for under .25%Have not had a 3 day losing streak since going 5 in row from Sept. 18-24That run took us down to 252.28

Something is brewing.She is gonna move tomorrow.Which way? I don't know. I'm betting on the upside.
The real reason why NFLX surged yesterday and today:Their subscription numbers around the world are shooting up as people who want to avoid going to crowded places (including movie theaters) are becoming new subscribers of Netfflix!It's [pretty simple.Be prepared for next week's short carnage. Rated X (for gore).
Good entry point for nflx??
It usually rips higher about 12$ from here...”stocks” & “the Market”. Whatever people
Do you guys think they will announce stock split today?
Seeing some mid caps who are down 65% bottomToday. Would be very fitting to see smaller growth caps bottom here as overvalued big megacaps unwind the froth. I see zero zero zero froth in small mid and spac markets. $aapl $msft $plug $be $nndm $ddd $nflx $clsk- if your stock hasnt crashed yet or done time lower much lower like these smalls or $tsla u should be nervous
Should open around 460
Today’s action is very good for NFLX. All weak hands are out. Institutions & smart money got their hands on cheap shares of Netflix. Now it will be easy to breakthrough $380 resistance and hit $400+ price target :)

Addicted behavior of making money buying NFLX
Technically this stock needs to back fill down to 310.05 before making a run to higher highs. (Weekly candle chart). Red on a day when the Nasdaq is green +31 isn't confidence building. See you at 301
I wouldn’t short Netflix. It will go up $100 per share if Microsoft announced it’s interested in Netflix.

"Breaking: Netflix price target raised to $575 from $485 at Morgan StanleyMorgan Stanley analyst Benjamin Swinburne raised the firm's price target on Netflix to $575 from $485 and keeps an Overweight rating on the shares. While there has been ""much debate"" over the pull-forward effect of the pandemic, Swinburne argues that benefits of the 2020 member growth ""pull-forward"" will likely be lasting as the company will see structural benefits from greater scale and put pressure on its primary competition for audience time, namely incumbent TV broadcasters. Swinburne added that he expects Netflix to add its 200 millionth member this year, ""just over three years after crossing the 100M mark."""

I was considering to cover rest but thought to do it around 290. Yesterday I had chance again but thought sell off is solid. No regret. I will slowly add more while keep selling out of money put for premium.with earning around I should able to bring my average price from $325 to $345 with all calls and puts profit. Premium into earning will be killing and will help make me money. I am fearless and will sell near money calls and puts to take maximum advantage.I shorted 315 call yesterday at close and also short 100 at 320 and 100 at 323 this morning. Plan to keep adding short for every $10 increase."
downgrade nation tomorrow
"Will nflx be closer to 320 this week or 340? That 10% increase last week has already taken a good hit. I think if we see 1 positive day and 4 negative days this week, the gains will be erased."
Take the time to read netflix financial statements. Pay attention to how much the company earns per year and what debts they have. How many years to work only to cover the debt.

"Netflix downgraded after stock runs up 67% in two months 11:41 AM ET 3/7/18 | MarketWatchBy Trey Williams, MarketWatch 'Share price may have sprinted ahead of fundamentals in the short-term,' says Stifel analyst Scott Devitt Shares of streaming giant Netflix Inc. were down roughly 2% on Wednesday, after analysts at Stifel downgraded the stock to hold from buy after its valuation ballooned in a two-month period. ""We are downgrading shares of Netflix on valuation, as the stock has appreciated to our new $325 12-month price target,"" Stifel analyst Scott Devitt wrote in a note to investors. ""We are attracted to Netflix's business and competitive position but believe share price may have sprinted ahead of fundamentals in the short-term."" I'm not surprised one bit. It can't keep going like this forever."

"This stock is like bitcoin at close to 20,000. Netflix is a great company. But the only thing it has is first-mover advantage in the streaming area. With more players and more competition, it will only lose its market share in US. Internationally? keep burning cash while facing more local competition as well."
"CONGRATS IF YOU BOUGHT THOSE NOVEMBER 20th CALLS WHEN THEY WERE DIRT CHEAP! Been telling you since under $500 to load up on them. Huge gains.NOW Goldman raises NFLX price target to $670!IF WE GET another PULLBACK, pick up the November 20th Calls cheaper ahead of next week earnings. "

How are my shorts doing today? RIP.Going to $400.
"The real reason why it is up today (along with FB) is because crooked analysts have already pumped TSLA and APPL to the max, and even the most naive retail investor is starting to think maybe buying 1 share of TSLA at 2000 is probably not wise. Because FB and NFLX have been relatively quite in the past few weeks, they decided to pump these two stocks. This is text book example of pump and dump. This is how whales feed. They gather all the minnows, then take a bite gulp. The trick is to get the average Robinhood investors to pour in money in these companies, and once the stock is pumped, they sell quietly to the more naive average Robinhood investors at even higher price. This is reality. There is no material change in NFLX business that can explain this. Some AI generated headline stating ""tons of new subscribers"" pushes the market by 30B! You see, bubbles don't burst everyday, they can keep going up and up, but the problem is when it does burst, most average people will be caught with their pants down, and psychologically, it is hard to take a loss, so they keep until they are too much down and then take a huge loss."

Let me see now....cash flow losses in 2019 go to $3.5 billion from $3.0 billion previously. US subscriber guidance of 0.3 million net additions in Q2 is way below consensus. It would appear US subscriber growth has reached a plateau and is about to flatline due to the churn from the massive price hike. US subscriber base may actually decline by 4Q when Disney+ launches. Netflix has no growth remaining in the US.
"330,000% increase in eps and 30% increase in REV==== NFLX is best of breed start making a bid AAPL,DIS, AMZN. Always trades down after earning but Goldman has a 425 PT before getting the #### increase PT to 500. OK GB"
"Appears to be a technical bounce, oversold short term. Could fill the gap soon but beyond that, this space is pretty crowded and NFLX needs a plan."
Many subscribers have dropped the service because they became to political in their programming. Annie 's first season was delightful but second season was unwatchable. Political correctness overwhelmed the script. I cancelled and will not return.Programming with Obama and Letterman tipped the scales. Many othe good options available.

"Using Day Trader Josh's swing trading system, the 328.00 support on daily chart ( low on 7/31/18), its holding above here for 9 days. One of Josh's rules for an established swing level requires a 10 day hold above/below a support/Resistance, this means that going LONG here above 328 is very risky for SWINGS. Especially when market is at all-time highs and due for sharp NATURAL pullback. Investors dont worry, just hold...but swing traders, wait for 228 to break (or come close, below 330) before getting back in this beast. Now, if NFLX does NOT go back down, then we will just wait for higher resistance swing levels, and start our shorts again for quick 5-10 pullbacks. Again, we DO NOT guess direction, we instead wait patiently on sidelines till price comes to us. Way less stress and we ALWAYS get a damn good entry with this strategy. But there is far more to Day Trader Josh's strategy then what I just mapped out here. But at least you get the framework. Essentially, we are counter-trend trading, for quick (1 to 5 day) profits off the reversals in price. Although, in key situations (like earnings) we get far more then 10 points on NFLX, both LONG&SHORT."

If Disney’s offering does not come under Netflix’s price umbrella their subscriber growth will disappoint. They will not be able to raise prices and will fall further behind.

"If raising subscription prices was such an easy panacea, all companies would have done so. This is a competitive market and there's no telling what the effect will be. I consider it a negative as they cited rising costs, which means margins are being squeezed. Don't short because of the insane volatility in this stock but if you are long, I'd consider selling some, especially after this huge run-up on no news, which smells like a short squeeze."
"First Netflix said they're gonna start cracking down on password sharing. Now they are considering releasing episodes in batches rather than all at once (remember when everyone said Netflix wouldn't do that because they created binge watching?).

"The Sony deal proves once again that streaming is becoming more and more about name brand titles. The world of entertainment is so fractured and people's attention is divided among so many things that it's very hard for anyone to create brand new IP that gets the attention of the world. Star Wars, Harry Potter, Marvel, Godzilla, etc, properties that get the most attention have been around for many years or even many decades. What was the last entirely original property that really made an impact? Traditional studios have pretty much given up trying to make anything new, which is why we see an endless list of reboots and sequels. I think Stranger Things is the first one that comes to mind as something that became really big in the last five years in terms of saturation among both kids and adults. It's a property that can be rebooted and spun-off for years. I'm sure it's only a matter of time before we get a show called Hopper."

"With subscriber growth now back on track, look for more upgrades coming."
Legendary media investor John Malone says scale is the most important factor in the media industry. Netflix has a huge lead in scale and no one has been able to cut into that lead.
"I told you folks a few weeks ago to sell NFLX when it was in the low 400's, high 300's, mid 300's and now low 300's. This stock got way ahead of itself. The current P/E ratio is still way too high by all means. I have never said that NFLX doesn't have a good product, it just that the market cap is twice as to what it should be. They have grown by given its product at prices that doesn't sustain their business bottom line. When they increase the price to become profitable the customer base will decrease. So they are in a very tough position. In addition, competition by Disney, Apple, Google and others will only intensified down the road. If you still have profits sell and run for the hills and if you have losses sell now to minimize further loses. We will if not already enter a period of a serious stock market correction as it's currently way over priced. I strongly recommend that you consult your CPA/CFA and ask him/her on holding stocks of companies with P/E of over 100 and see what they tell you."

"Remember two words: this is an “American Giant”, can’t tell you what price it will go up, but I can assure you $400+ beginning Jan, 2019. Logical reason? The “Buyback” will kicking strong until then. Relax."
"Amazing that the funds are still buying this stock despite the massive run up over the past 5 years. One thing is for sure though, NFLX pioneered the OTT concept and has a strong lead over it's rivals, but cash burn needs to go down at some point. Else people who bought in at today's prices will need to keep waiting forever to get back their investment. JMTC"
"Ahahah, Dead money, dead stock)))"
theres always Monday
"Better to go long on Netflix than shorting it. if it doesn't ride tomorrow, it will in the coming months. I think it will be above 700 before end of year. I hope I m not wrong because I am going long."
"seriouslyAmazon announced 150 million prime members, up from 110 in June 2019Check those numbers and datesThey get free Amazon Prime videoand Netflix is down less than 1%and Disney announces Mondayand Coronavirus is running up fast and we have the weekend for the news to get worseNetflix has a PE of 90 nowApple had a PE of 26Disney had a PE of 20Google had a PE of 30Compared to Apple's PE, Netflix is 3.2 times too highI'd expect selling. I mean the price dropping with selling. I'm pretty sure they are selling."
Time for day traders to close their position now. Tommorow is another day.
"Heavy buy volume today and as usual, with this kind of strong momentum PPS could explode from current levels. GLTA"
So great. Added more 2 days ago.
"$NIO $NFLX $FB $WIMI No matter be the process that buy, still be the process that hold, still be the process that sell in the future, it is spent in waiting actually, do not wait to do not have appropriate price, won't have the arrival that rise, must want to have enough patience, just make enough money likely."
What news today was behind the rally?
Apple investors are not liking this conference at all. Stock is falling accordingly
I just took out a second mortgage to BUY MORE!
"You don't buy a stock like this when it's up up up, you sell. You buy it when it's down down down."
The bears are winning--reality is 3 million vaccines per day. NFLX is going to be fine --its just not going to be as highly valued and PRICED TO PERFECTION because it like reality HAS CHANGED.
"Netflix dazzles with 34 Golden Globe nominations (more than HBO (15), Sony (8) and Disney (6) combined!)https://seekingalpha.com/news/3524829-netflix-dazzles-34-golden-globe-nominations"
Barclays just upgraded it
Congrats NFLX longs. Within 24 hours Google (YouTube) and now Apple have been thrown aside. Can't wait to see that 10 mill subscriber number being announced in a few weeks! $400 in April. Fact.
"Netflix needs to start doing stock splits. I want to see it be a $50 stock, so averange people can afford it. Disney and Apple can try to take away market share but reality is, Netflix is king. say what you want to say...smart people will only activate their free 7 day pass of Disney plus meanwhile paying hardcore cash each month to keep their netflix subscription."
"Analyst constant commentary1.> Unstoppable lead2.> AI Lead3.> Technology leadAll three are bogus or not so material claim1.> HBO still have more subscriber than NFLX so where is lead? If HBO growth suddenly stalled, why Netflix will not run into same fate? They are very similar. HBO direct cost $15 and it growing very fast still.2.> AI lead:- I can think four type of AI advantage -> What User want to see based on past history. Now with around 4000 title ( likely much less when lot of license content disapear in 2018-2019 period), How much data you need to determine what user want to see. They can determine based 10-15 day data at best. So NFLX got 15 day lead to give very close result and more than 6 month data is outdated. What a great lead that. -> Viewership to determine if show should continue or not:- This is not advantage as it look. reason TV Shows you sign by series and not by episode so even if they learn that kind of show flop it might too late. Also traditional TV has TRP rating system that very accurately measure number of viewers so there is no advantage. Infact experience advantage on traditional side because they have lot more exprience on continue or cutting series which matter more.-> Parental control :- This is sure advantage as they know how people setting parental control. This can help setup default and also removing undesired content. But again not visible advantage. Not sure Netflix is using such AI or not either.People will also give chance to improve new services by few months. If they don't care then for small group of people this do matter most.-> Ad targeting for new users based what people love to seeThis is another key advantage but human can figure this out without AI and result would still very close if not 100% accurate. So while it's advantage it's not as big. Also brand name advantage will become disavantage that take away ur targeting ability (Disney, Apple, Facebook are much bigger brand name)3.> Technology Lead:- Not much against most and big disadvantage when come to other technology company like Apple:-There are many many different streaming service already out there. They don't match scale of Netflix so not threat for Netflix but technology working great and improving along. Also live streaming and AD integration, NFLX is generation behind in technology. Not saying it's hard to catch up but same apply for Off-air Streaming."
The cup runneth over today. good luck owners
"Everyone is closing their Netflix accounts and heading to closed theme parks, cruise ships and casinos."
"God, I love this stock. Been holding it for years. I've ignored all the naysayers dismiss it countless times over the years because it always defies the skeptics and critics. And I credit Reed Hastings for much of the stock's resilience and growth: He never hesitates to admit when he's messed up, and always offers a solution to fix it - and he's always been right so far. Even earlier today when the stock was getting sold off, some were speculating on this board that ""smart money"" must have known something ahead of the earnings release - when, clearly, they didn't."
Internally there are concerns about liquidity at Disney. The reason for the Dis just cut the Dividend.Also it makes Disney have no choice but to cut back on investments in Dis+. Perhaps in a year or two Netflix will acquire Disneyhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHjl1a-UQg0
"were getting crushed now, makes me think its going down tomorrow also"
"As far as I know, Netflix hasn't lowered guidance, so they would come out w/ blockbuster earning tonight.NFLX would pop up to 430.00 after hours/tomorrow, and those selling will eat dust.Buy, buy, buy, buy!!!!"
"Wow. 11% down. Earnings are a no brainer for tech. Not worth the hold. Upside is always limited and downside is, well, as you can see."
"So I have 1,015 NFLX shares which I bought at $380. When it spiralled down to $382, I sold my shares at $392. Then when it is rising, I was only able to buy 983 shares. So I lost 32 shares. Now NFLX is $418.97, that means I lost 32 shares x $418.97 = $13,407.04. I have forever lost 32 shares. I realized not to be so greedy. I also realized to trust the fundamentals which convinced me to invest in NFLX from the very start. My move is against the advise of my fund counselor who also managed the rest of my funds. I have to learn from Buffett to choose a stock wisely, buy and hold it for the longest time."
Short covering rally increases tomorrow as weekend approaches. Who wants to be short over the weekend?
"if AAPL has good numbers, we click 340 tonight or tomorrow."
"I always said you can realistically judge the progress of the recovery by the decline of streaming services, which boomed at the height of the pandemic."
Thanks for the cheap shares in nflx and amzn. Glad I had 1/3 in cash after taking recent profits. Remember this was $360-$380 before covid and now they are much stronger. Could stock go lower tomorrow? Of course but I’m confident this will be $550-$600 by end of year or early 2021. Amazon should be $3500-$4000. You make money when you buy. Today was a money making opportunity if you’re smart and patient.
Netflix is gonna tank soon
They have the wind at their back with the cost savings they get switching from license content to original content. This wind will persist a few more years.

I agree with bay-nearly time for another split. If it did-it would go up 20% fast.
$392 before next earnings
NFLX pulling an Apple....Raise prices as lower subscribers doom the revenue stream ! OUCH
"Hulu reduced their monthly fee, should Netflix be scared? After all Hulu is competing from that space. We can also look at this from another angle, The only business that I saw reduce prices in th past are companies in desperation like block buster when they reduced their prices to compete with Netflix, Movie houses when they rolled out $10 a month unlimited movies and many more to list. Reducing prices on already established price point is a move from a position of weakness folks."
FANG stocks back once again to leading this secular bull market.
It’s hard to be positive right now about this stock. Hopefully we see a rotation into names like nflx and amzn next. The market ran big across the board and is at all time highs. Yet nflx needs to go up about 20% to reach it’s all time highs. Ideally right now you’d be taking profits after the big market run. Not only has nflx declined almost $100 in a couple of months. It’s done it during a time of a very strong market. Most of us have cost basis much lower than $575 obviously but you’ve not only been in the red the last couple months here but you’ve incurred a steep opportunity cost. My reason I continue to hold is because the company is doing as well as ever and so many bullish signs with analysts price increases and subs. The disconnect between stock and company has fooled me. Hopefully the road ahead is brighter than today.
NFLX tops HBO FOR THE 1ST TIME MOST EMMY NOMINATIONS !
"We are looking at another day like June 27. Open +8.17, high was +12.12 ended -9 for the day.Only day since July 18, 2016 it opened +6 and finsished in the RED....."
"I think today was a test just to see if it can even hold a green day. If markets are good tomorrow we may see a proper gain. If markets are bad tomorrow then, per usual, NFLX will have an exaggerated drop."
"This is the start of Netflix. Netflix will become so cash flow positive and can fund almost any new content. That is the key. Do not forget the buybacks.Whoever is selling, thank you. Whoever is buying, good job."
"Idk why people even use Netflix,Roku, I use free sights for any streaming"
I expected NFLX to immediately plunge 10+ points after FCC net neutrality ruling and Disney/Fox announcement. Boy I was wrong.
I just went short 200 shares at $337. This one is bloated folks.
"Logic eludes me on this; the rest of the FANG stocks are under investigation for anti trust practices and such yet they're all way up, and NFLX is down over 2%. I know it has heavy debt, but its been there for a long time."
Post Earnings....NFLX Is Just ROLLING......In......TIMMMBERRRRRRRRRR
342 tomorrow
"Results disappointing, pointing to single digit growth ahead"
If we get 4.5% up today we may catch another 5% shortly and settle $333.
thumps up if you guys think it will get back to $370 again
As Netflix scales up their return on content increases and they are still in the early stage of scaling up.
Stocks typically drop on day 2 after a selloff like today. Let's see if NFLX holds true to that. My guess is it will be off 2-3% tomorrow then resume the run to $450.
has NFLX missed 2 earnings in a row in recent memory? serious question.
"Beat on revenue but huge miss on earnings... How? Studio production and original content was shut down! How did they manage to blow hundreds of millions with a big drop in production costs which had been their albatross?And now to confirm, slowing expectations of future growth.What were you thinking paying DOUBLE the pre corona price?"
Company DID NOT make any loss. It'll recover the loss in few days. It's GOLDMAN who gave wrong estimates
"Last year almost same time I start buying Netflix around 290$, it went down to 245 if I dont make a mistake, at the time I had 85 stocks and was nervous because I lost so much money on it, however I sold my stock few month ago around 345$, now same as last year, start buying at 310$ and latest batch was today that bough few at 253$. I know will enjoy at least 10k return in 2 to 3 months."
Why don't you just make the fake news real. Say Nflx price target raised to keep the stock market from a correction. That w be just fine don't you think?
Do you honestly think those that are buying the monthly description to Disney for their kids are going to cancel Netflix? Come on!!! What are they going to watch !?!
amazing watching people come here to brag about losing money on NFLX short positions...
"Increased user growth rate isn’t feasible every quarter. Netflix is still the King, probably always will be."
I'm guessing NFLX will find some support in the 260 to 270 range.
"Fact: In the long run Netflix will just be another ""channel"" in the new Internet on-demand TV market. $30B market cap max!"
Maybe if Netflix didn't have garbage programming people would sign up.

"WHY WOULD YOU SHORT NFLX ahead of earnings with massive subscribers? PLUS, FALL IS JUST around the corner, and COVID 19 expected to be even worse! $670 price target might look more like $750. "
"Nothing goes up on a straight line, same as nothing goes down on a straight line."
Im trying to short more no share to short = no buying
This is not the beginning of some sort of recovery. This is an opportunity to eject and save losing a fortune
Volume is so low.. Almost no one is selling .. Just CHECK THE VOLUME :D
PE ratio of 95? Long way to fall before it becomes interesting.
Look at subscriber growth rate of 26% and accelerating. They just raise prices 16% but analysts are only estimating 26% revenue growth this year! There's another flood of analyst upgrades coming. It happens every year and I think this year will be one of the best years ever for the stock because the stock was robed of having one of it's best years last year with the tech stock bear market.

"Here’s the upside for Netflix. 5G rollout will by EOY will benefit Netflix push for mobile. Streaming gets cheaper every year and that adds up to Netflix bottom line. 5g will allow countries with slow internet speed to finally catch up to the west and it will spur innovation all over the world as we have seen with the rollout of 4G. We are looking at a new bull run in the US economy and many mini bull run on many nations which in turn will increase its middle class base which will directly benefit Netflix. We are looking at another 4 more years of additional bull run. If you doubt the 5g bull run projections, just look at the innovation spurred by 4G."
Good call Barry screaming buy at 334.
Great piece .. https://techstockobserver.com/did-netflix-inc-nasdaqnflx-really-just-do-that/
"Buy the fear. Every time NFLX takes a substantial hit to the downside, it recovers in short order."
"RBC has it right when it comes to Netflix with $450 price target. And it is his top name with best risk reward.His case rest on:-> horrible sentiment on Netflix (worst he can recall), so good setup-> people thinking they are going to miss subs, but his channel checks doenst suggest that-> accelerating cord cutting that's happening -> Netflix being big/main beneficiary-> lots of room to grow.(early innings) They currently have 150m - 160 m subscribers.there are 3 billion smartphones, and in long run 2 billion of those he views as netflixs potential. If you look 10 years out Netflix will be 5 times the company it is today-> netflix has scale advantage, spend more on content, have better brand name in streaming, better globally distributed, and better partnerships"
The Word of theDay Is.TIMMMMMMMMMBAHHHHH !
Should be announcing a stock split and dividend increase shortly
How much does Netflix need to spend a year before all of it's subscribers always have a short list of must see shows? If it's 25B and they can grow to 100B a year in revenue the difference of 75B a year would be mostly profit.

Hard to imagine people pay this price for a company that burns cash and is t profitable.
"According to co founder this morning, Netflix has enough new material already completed to get them thru August. Can't say that for the other networks and streamers."
You honestly think the analyst upgrades mean anything. These firms are heavily invested in this stock. Go figure.

A couple years ago I bought some shares of NFLX at the $82 range and sold at the $92 range. I locked in a good $10/ share of gains and was very happy with my trade. Following my gains I saw the stock climb to $350 range. I was heartbroken and disappointed that I wasn't strong enough to hold on for the ride. However a couple years later ( Tuesday before the bell) I decided to participate and open a good position on NFLX. I'm very happy I did and I don't think a quick $10 - $20 bump up is enough to get out and lock in gains this time. Same thing happened to me with TSLA- I saw a $100 gain / per share and got out. Way too early now that I look back. After I got out of TSLA the stock rallied another $200+ a share.
"Congratulations to all the longs that held through today without bailing out. After recent performance, to hold through today took a lot of guts. I am one that held and glad I did."
"Be very cautious, pre and after-market trading don’t mean squat. Hopefully it holds, but I’ve experienced way too many times where it did the complete opposite when it started trading in regular hours."
I predict we close at 1% gain.
"Anyone trying to convince you the likes of $IQ or $NFLX are performing badly as a company should be ignored. The entire market selloff is irrational, so use it to your advantage and pick up stocks on the sale of the decade. We are likely to see markets get halted today with a circuit breaker to get triggered. Buy the fear and hold. You're going to make 50%+ after the virus fears are over....which I expect to be within 30 days. Keep buying and holding."
"50% miss on domestic and 25% miss on international. Stock should be down $100, not $50"

"Buy as much as you can premarket, it will be down like today. It is like walking into equity. Apple's misfortunes are temporary/product cycle and has nothing to do with economy. A lot of people who bought IPhone X last year (2017) did not upgrade. Netflix's monthly fee is very reasonable and can withstand economic downturn. Disney+ and Time Warner streaming is not a threat to Netflix, I for one will subscribe to Disney+, the other service will complement Netflix and it will take 8-12 year for Disney+ and Time Warner catch up."
"Hopefully Andrew Left got burned on his short play...----------------------------In 2016, the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission accused Left of spreading false and misleading information about Evergrande Real Estate Group Ltd. The trial marks the first legal action of the Securities and Futures Commission against a short seller with ramifications for free speech, according to the judge. Left had been researching Evergrande since 2012 when he received papers from an anonymous whistleblower, and claimed they were insolvent and the chairman's credentials were false.[16] Later in 2016 a Hong Kong tribunal banned Andrew Left from trading for five years after publishing “false and/or misleading” claims about China Evergrande Group. Left was ordered to repay HK$1.6 million in trading profits, pay about HK$4 million in legal expenses, and face criminal prosecution if he breaks Hong Kong rules again."

CHAPTER 13 ON WAY ......
up to 380 tomorrow...watch
I guess we should be happier than we were at 9;31
I don’t blame those of you who sold when it went above $510 and I think tomorrow is shaping up like another market selloff. But that said the election is likely over Tuesday night. A contested election could create some overhang but that appears unlikely to happen. The other uncertainty is covid. Well a second wave hardly hurts nflx. In fact it likely helps. So that’s why I didn’t sell some today. I think this stock will be in the $600 before the end of the year. I will take some profits before then but not selling at $510 right now.

Head & Shoulders pattern just formed in the three months chart.
When is Netflix required to write down the carrying value of some of this original programming? There is no positive ROI associated with much of this original content.
"They are on fast track going from licensing content to producing their own which has high upfront costs and returns coming only 1 to 2 years later. So how can they still keep a 25% subscriber growth rate!?? They must be saving a ton producing their own content. This company is in a sweet spot. When they reach the production/ licensing balance they're looking for higher cash flows will kick in, subscriber growth rate will be at a high, and profits will soar. 500 by years end and 1000 in 3 to 5 years."

"Today all tech stock up, Netflix down)). Dead money since summer 2020."
Wow why these companies feel the need to inject a public company into politics. It seems like a travesty of justice to me
Netflix is charging itself out of the market. Should have lowered prices to compete...
Why Netflix is going down? They reported very good earning report. Does not have any impact of trade war. Still down!! Can’t believe this. Any bad news that I am not aware of?
"From just over 2 USD in 2008 to 586,34 USD in 2021.Quite impressive."
board cashing in
Let’s do what GME players did to raise stock price 100% in 2 days!
"I know it’s going to be back at 350, the question is when?"
"I bet a lot of NFLX shorts think that because of Disney’s projected 200 plus million subscribers over the next few years that they will eat NFLX’s lunch. That’s simply not the case. DIS and NFLX make very different shows and target different markets. There is a way the two can coexist without cutting each other’s throats. As long as NFLX continues to make shows like The Queen’s Gambit their subscriber numbers won’t shrink. Long term I am bullish on both DIS and NFLX and believe the two can coexist in the same way Coke and Pepsi, Square and PayPal, Domino’s and Papa John’s, all can. Competition doesn’t have to erode business when there are only a few players. Own both. I see so many people bashing DIS in this discussion and vice versa in the DIS discussion it makes no sense. Two money makers are better than one. GLTA."
"The main reason subscriber growth slowed was not due to competition but due to a lighter content slate...user retention remained robust. So people aren't quitting NFLX for others in mass numbers...I myself am subscribed not only to NFLX but to Hulu and Disney+ (for their Marvel content), I own a ROKU TV, I'm subscribed to Amazon, etc. Most people have multiple streaming services. The average analyst report, which most of the yahoo bears don't have access to, states that hundreds of millions of future subscribers await NFLX, as well as significant free cash flow generation and very high operating margins. There really isn't a bear case on this name, and while I expect many thumbs down and to be called names by the shorts they don't realize the financial suicide they're committing by doubling down on their shorts instead of wisely covering after the dip. It's your funeral...just don't say you weren't warned."
"""Limit my gains"" ??? That doesn't sound like a winning market strategy."
go NFLX keep growing
"Netflix maintained Buy with $685 price target at JPMorganJPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth believes investor sentiment around Netflix ""remains muted"" given COVID-related pull-forward driving year-over-year declines in net additions, along with increased competition and price increase concerns. The analyst maintains a 6.3M Q1 net add estimate, down 60% year-over-year, and just above management's guidance of 6.0M. Anmuth believes expectations are no higher than guidance based on his recent investor conversations. The analyst sees year-over-year net adds growth in the second half of 2021 and keeps an Overweight rating on Netflix with a $685 price target."
"I just don’t think the remaining longs understand the economics of what’s going on with this company. For the last few years they could spend whatever they wanted to boost subscriber growth. Now that they are coming under pressure to reduce the cash hemorrhage they are finding resistance from sub price increases while the content is getting worse due to lower spend, it is impossible for this company to turn a profit and bankruptcy is a mathematical certainty"
sweet Goldman Sachs raise price Target for Netflix to 490$ by next year .....start buying guys
$NFLX $WIMI $NIO It feels like the dealer is going to pull a wave to attract the attention of the funds. I have laid out in advance
I said so: Friday NFLX may hit $300 today!
"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/should-you-buy-netflix-stock-the-company-will-keep-losing-market-share-11620251326?siteid=yhoof2Ha, ha ,ha-trash comes to the end"
"""Netflix on track to double revenues by 2021 and triple by 2023."" Ok so let's assume thats true, let's triple the EPS. We'll make it a clean $9 per share. That puts PE at 34 at this share price in an optimistic scenario by 2023? What am I missing?"
"Serious question, Why does a price increase make the stock jump 3%? Is it just a profits kind of thing?"
what's happening?
"One out of every ten people in the world survives on less than $2 per day. If you make over $35,000 per year, you are in the top 1% of earners in the world. And some people think ""the entire world population"" is going to have a Netflix subscription?"
If Netflix adds an avg of 5m new subscribers the next 20 quarters (low estimate)....thats another 100m subscribers....no brainer. Z
nflx dsny hulu best places for streaming money. I don't see nflx losing any market share at all even with disney coming online soon. People will just buy both and cut to cable tv cord.
If AAPL or GOOG buys VIAC - NFLX would make a documentary - once upon a time there was NFLX
"Nasdak - ATН, this company is at the bottom, nothing has changed since the report"
Gonna add 20k if it dips to 272.00
"NOW analysts are saying that maybe NFLX is ""expensive"". Hahahahahaha. They all thought it was undervalued in the $400s. NEVER listen to those people. They are NOT looking after your interests."
"I'm a long term investor in Netflix and will look back in 5 years at this share price today and think, I wish I bought more."
"The market is a never ending learning experience. Remember when Netflix briefly had a higher market cap than Disney? Then a pandemic came along, shut down almost all of Disney's income, and the result is Disney rocking and rolling above $200 with a 360 billion market cap. Who saw THAT coming?"
"Buying opportunity for sure. Look at your history here...every sell off has turned into a chance to buy and make money. The sub model they have blew it this quarter, but they set the bar low for next quarter and they’ll beat it handily. This is always the weakest quarter with little new content. Add to that the fact that they’re just in their infancy in Asia. Short term pain down to 320 in the near term, but up up and away is the long term destination."
"It try to hold the 5 day moving average, but I don’t think it will. Tomorrow we will see more speculators sell to cut a loss."
"as warren buffet says, buy when the opportunity arises to buy a good stock on sale."
Netflix investors snookered by wall st pros who hyped bad news and are now LIQUIDATING their overvalued shares to NAIVE shareholders who read headlines and ignore the facts..Click on my icon and scroll down to see the zerohedge arrticle i posted when nflx was 306..Once ypu read it you will understand the selling....
"This was a beaten down stock from its highs and a perfect setup for this move higher. More room to run. Competition concerns are minor in my mind, most cord cutters think of streaming like a buffet. Cable subscribers think of nflx as a supplement. I'm holding my call options and riding this higher."
I sold my remaining shares around $520. My take is we all know Netflix is doing great and will likely post a great quarter. The problem is their outlook will be compared against 2020. While I think 2021 will be a strong year for nflx I think people will focus on comparisons to 2020 sub adds. I’m guessing it probably sells off on earnings. If it does so I will look to get back In.
No rate cut so back to 350
P/E at 90. Yikes!
buying all the shorts i can for the short term
This baby is still a bargain from its 400 territory. Just added $100K ~~~
Bloomberg TV just had a very positive report on NFLX. The Bloomberg analyst explained that the very few analysts recommending to sell NFLX will need to explain to their clients why and maybe change their recommendation given the anticipated subscription increase in Q1. He said it could be up 53% for the Qtr. That would be a monster EPS (probably $2.25 range and share price would increase 20% on Tuesday after market closes).
I read why Netflix dropped. Less new subscribers. To much competition from many other streaming services. Disney is eating their lunch.
netflix story is over. too many competitors now
"P/E at 99 with slowing growth, burning billions to make movies/tv products, rough competitions, movies awards taken by competitors, competitors with low to free contents. I wouldn’t be surprised to see an 50% haircut from here."
Looking like a nice gap up at open. $415 by Friday
"Day's Range 503.60 - 515.46... So, tomorrow we will start @515+"
Held this stock for 8 years. Seen all the downward slides only to see it come roaring back to all time highs a few months later. This blip will be forgotten by next earnings. See you all above $420 by end of year.
why would anyone think they just keep adding subscribers? There is a limited number of people in the world!!
Lets keep going NFLX dont give up those gains!!!! Yesss!!
LoL roku +18% on a good report. it just falls).

"Netflix price target raised to $550 from $420 at Barclays Netflix price target raised to $550 from $420 at Barclays 06:30 NFLX Barclays analyst Kannan Venkateshwar raised the firm's price target on Netflix to $550 from $420 and keeps an Overweight rating on the shares. While Q2 expectations have ""run up significantly ahead of already high guidance,"" the key driver is likely to be Q3 guidance where expectations are ""relatively subdued"" due to company commentary earlier in the year and a tough comp versus Stranger Things last year, Venkateshwar tells investors in a pre-earnings research note. Netflix is one of the few content services with a full content slate which, combined with sports uncertainty, could continue to be a tailwind, says the analyst."

Well now i know why Netflix surged today. Beyonce's Homecoming concert at Coachella was released on Netflix today. And it is phenomenal. Easily one of the best things i have ever seen on Netflix. They should do more concerts and fewer lame comedy specials.
Sub $300 tomorrow. NFLX shareholders right now:
"got, you make a good point. Piggybacking off that, the 10 largest Nasdaq companies (NFLX is like #8) are now worth much more than the entire German economy and closing in on Japan, the 4th and 3rd largest economies in the WORLD. Really? Day of reckoning is coming for sure."

Everybody knows Netflix numbers will be much better then expected this time because of the great shows that came out in November and December. All those that signed up then are paying now. Next to that the price increase.
$508.78 is very expensive for a $200 stock. Extremely Strong sell.

The market is so dramatic. News wasn’t even that bad. I am staying in and will just buy more tomorrow haha don’t have weak hands
You will see $320 very soon. This is solid business with $400 target price for 2018.
"So many people took a gamble and shorted this stock. Needless to say, this stock will soar tomorrow with all the shorts covering their calls! Hahahaha"

$340-$350 on Tuesday next week. Earnings will be outstanding per experts.
oh yeah....
"I learned something with this trade, Buy when its completely beaten up and hold on strong,"
1 trick pony!! Cant see anymore than 5-10% upside potential if they are just going to focus on streaming...
Looking perfect for a gap up tomorrow
Going under 500 today
"For the sake of it's future technical health, I'd like to see NFLX fill this earnings gap before crushing the $260-65 area. Yes, they had an amazing quarter in terms of new subscriptions, but, the stock is expensive as heck... The chart looks like bitcoin. careful!"
660 NEXT STOP
CNBC confirmed standard to $14 price increase by $1. Nobody will cancel over $1 and the revenue will go up big.
I think this is a warning of rocky earnings. The adults are going to be asking fund managers why they are holding this tomorrow. Going to be interesting day.
up 14.52 another 6 more and its 20 plus day!!!!!!!
"Time to buy AMC. Heavily shorted, AMC’s market cap is only at $4B as the world’s largest cinema severely hit by pandemic. Streaming is not going to kill movie going. Movies will be flooded with people. People miss going out to movies with family and friends. Don’t miss the AMC train."
"I'm long on Netflix, bought at the beginning of the recession in 2008. Ok to buy on the dip, had several dips/corrections in the last several weeks. But Netflix has a lot of headroom, even with new competition, with more content creation and new markets in China and India, and more shows in Spanish. So buy and hold, even if it is a bit over valued now. Price doubled over last year so some correction is expected."
"Will be green before the market closes. Nothing is allowed to go down, comrades."
"Netflix(5 year, GAAP) VS. INDUSTRY 58.20%Revenue Growth (TTM) 26.74%Disney only wishes :-)"

Netflix Stock Gets Price-Target Cut As Subscriber Outlook Lowered
$FUBO everyone is looking at the usa as total addressable market. but fubo is already in spain and canada. They are also talking with other countries and preparing the fubo app + fubobet app to go internationally. current market cap is undervalued on this fact alone. looking at funk's lifespan they are further at this stage than $NFLX and $ROKU are.
"John Malone says scale is the most important factor in the media industry. In Feb 2016 the market had a big sell off, Netflix fell 40% to $80. It had 78 million subscribers. Netflix fell 45% to 231 after the recent bigger market sell off. Netflix had 146 million subscribers. Netflix subscribers increased 165% but the stock increased 289%. Scale is very, very powerful."
"Load up. Netflix target to $610 (from $585) with 'bull case' of $700 and BUY rating at JefferiesJefferies analyst Alex Giaimo raised the firm's price target on Netflix to $610 from $585 and reiterates a Buy rating on the shares. Netflix's United States and Canada price hikes coupled with an ""improved pipeline"" can drive upside to estimates in 2021, Giaimo tells investors in a research note. ""Surprise hits"" like The Queen's Gambit and ""tentpole hits"" like The Crown reinforce the company's ""outsized consumer value proposition, says the analyst. Giaimo increased fiscal 2021 estimates Netflix and has a ""bull cash"" of $700 for the shares. The stock closed Monday up $17.47 to $515.78."

Will come back stronger Monday and hit 600 next week. That options thing is over.
I dumped Netflix over a year ago and haven’t missed it. NFLX is a $50 stock at best.
Netflix is the most absurdly overvalued stock on the entire market.
"Nflx prime is over. Streaming is no longer an innovation, everyone can do it. It is now down to contents, and Nflx no matter how much they bump the contents, it will never be able to compete with Disney, HBOWarner, NBC, Paramount. The future is bleak for Nflx. Get out now."
"I was impressed with NFLX's growth, they added 8.8 million new customers. Comcast and ATT would love to have that kind of growth."
"Do you longs understand what the word “market” actually means? Look it up...NFLX basically was up 100 points in three weeks. Demand at these prices are drying up, high beta plays first to cool and debt ridden YoY get hurt as rates rise = Fact check!Getting frothy up in here...stay nimbleVA"
"Real Quid Pro Quo was NFLX giving Obamas $50M for a TV Series, for a connection with net neutrality."
"Bought in at $300, now again at $265. I've been binge watching a bunch of their shows. Just finished homeland, just wow! Can't wait for season 8. I work in the media industry and the production quality is very comfortably up there with HBO or even better. I'm waiting for Disney+ with ESPN to come out (Apple TV+ I don't know), combine that with Netflix, I will gladly cancel my cable. This is going to be the trend and Netflix will benefit massively from all the cable TV dollar (Cable TV is $100B/year just in the US alone!). The competition is GOOD! People are missing the big picture. I would love to buy Disney right now but it's overbought, wait for a pullback. Netflix has been pulled back because of all the noise, jump in while you can."
I'm hoping we beat. ;)

bought back in todaygood move or bad?
NFLX is ripe to take off after today’s action. Load up on the call option for some real money.
I guess NFLX likes higher interest rates. Shows what I know. I thought higher interest rates would put downward pressure on the stock price.
"Garolou, where are you? You should have listened to me and shorted at $380. I tried to tell you all your pumping was useless and it was bad news it couldn't break thru the $380 level even though the market was hitting new highs. Sub growth is disappointing. Not surprising since the shows are weak. Even Stranger Things can't save them. Now you know why DIS is the king of content. Keep wasting your time pumping, the stock will act based on NFLX' performance, not your pumping."
Buying continues on NFLX stock because their revenues are increasing two fold each qtr! Earning will be HUGE!
Good stocks must have a long - term patience and wait $NFLX $WIMI $GOOG
Moving back to $400? Why the big moves over the past few days?
Don't worry guys. Netflix will pump out even more LGBTQAI+LMNOP&$ original content that will definitely be massive hits! Right? Guys...?
My wife said once it gets to 400 you can have some of this LOL
stock went down 3% after the announcement of the previous cfo then went up 800% since then.
Value investors are getting into NFLX.
This should drop at least 10pts today on 2B debt notes.
"Swear this stock will be up 2% by the end of the day, lol."
Disney says their streaming service won't compete with Netflix. That makes sense because all the streaming services that are competing with Netflix are losing a lot of money.
"Breaking: Netflix just teased on twitter, new game announcements at E3 ! (this is in addition to the stranger things game):https://comicbook.com/gaming/2019/05/13/netflix-e3-2019-video-game-announcements/"
$500 just around the corner  
Netflix needs to release more content quicker. Disney is going to make NFLX a knockoff brand.
Did Netflix will grow with the earnings? Or fall ?
"Nflx entry level plan is $8.99, 4.00 more expensive, so for the price difference of one coffee latte from SBUX I am expected to change to something as #$%$ as AAPL streaming where for each desirable content there will be one buy me for $3.99 content (lol)"
Here we go.... Nice Beat!
"News Flash: Netflix has already won. Rest playing for #2, including Apple and Disney. I own Apple as well."

His new forecast for Netflix to begin share repurchases later this year, and assumption for $2B in share repurchases during the second half of 2021, compares to his prior estimate of buybacks coming in 2023, Swinburne noted."
Good growth but on market down days buy it in low 500s. wait for it to get in.
Can a pundit step up with positive news? All is not bleak..NFLX is still functioning on all cylinders as always.
Expected a better day for NFLX
As long as Netflix invest in good content the customers will stay put....simple
Netflix competition just got stronger
"NFLX considered a ""growth stock"" because of the rate of subs. Okay now where's the revenue has it had yet to make a profit? Fair questions to ask."
"Took my 40k in gains on my $397.5 , $400 and $405 Puts today and bought $5000 of calls expiring Friday for $390-400. Feel like it’ll rip back up very fast... if not, great week overall..."

What is your realistic EOD thoughts?
Gave a fair warning
52 week high on Monday. Good luck NFLX long.
Obliteration After the Close... buy the 500 puts
If Netflix is going to release good numbers why wouldn’t they wait to announce price hikes until after or even during quarterly earnings? Seems like numbers may not be good so they want to run it up as much as possible before they announce to minimize damage.
Go baby go. They spent 600 mln on buyback yesterday -4400 left- worked like a charm
"This will go to $480 and than once Netflix start adding new content, hence adding more subs, it will do fine in the 3rd Q. but the sales will be down in the 2nd Q too."

With free streaming of some of its best shows is Netflix launching its ad supported service?
I don't even watch Netflix anymore.Content is horrible. Was a fad. I cancelled it.
Chances are Netflix added 12 million new subscribers last quarter which is 2.6 million more than they forecast.
"Whenever Cramer said negative about a particular stock, it means the opposite."
Good luck to you Netflix investors today. I do not own any Netflix. But I am smart enough to know bad numbers tonight could send us tumbling.
"Personally , I resigned from Netflix when they announced their deal w the Obama’s family. That family will not get another one of my $ if I can help if."
"NFLX was at 500 few days back, 480 is the resistance level. 5B buyback and international growth long term. I don't any skin in the game but it is still leader in streaming."
Increasing subscription prices no Netflix .... no thank you
How many more times am I going to hear that Disney+ only took 16 months what it took Netflix 14 years to reach 100M subscribers without any mention that Netflix started from scratch while Disney+ started with a whole library it took 100 years to build. Unbelievable.
Tacked on another billion today and now up 8.5% in 4 days. Hard to know how much further this can go. I started a short when it went over 206 and have averaged up to 207 but the train is pulling away. This could hit 210 today and 220 next week.
Bullish engulfing pattern AND a strong move off the 50% retracement level? Ooooo...shorts better cover while you can.
costant growth till monday
The pandemic was the perfect storm for this stock. Exiting the pandemic can only be bad for them.
I can't wait for lackluster subscriber numbers and revenue from DIS and AAPL streaming a year from now. Watch how fast bullish sentiment returns to this stock. They added almost 7 million (!!) new global subs last quarter. The US in only one piece of the puzzle.
"Go green, would be nice if at least one of my stock would make a profit today...its all red on my account today."

get it while itsCHEAP !
My Bloomberg terminal just gave me the blue line alert if you know what I mean.... huge subscription increase
"Its a Solid Good Holding, NOW THAT the drama is gone, its on its way back up"
"NFLX is looking like the new AAPL in stock ownership. October, 2012 it was 50.00 than it went to 700.00, split 7 for 1 and know it's 322.00 so that makes it worth 2254.00 a share now and don't see any competition either. Certainly not Amazon."
"Another funny thing about the NFLX shorts (we've already covered how whiny they are) is how born-yesterday they are. They don't seem to have the slightest idea that when AMZN was 300 then 400 then 600 their message board was full of posts about ""High PE"" this and ""no business model"" that and ""can't justify"" and ""bubble"" and...anyway, it's 1750 now. NFLX may or may not do the same- obviously it has so far- but you can tell that the shorts have no idea the different ways something can go.

It's fair price is 300. It's audience will continue to decline. It's p/e is way too high. This is not a growth company.
Buy roku instead!
Once people realize that profit and content spending will never intersect this stock will tank

"“In a note to investors on Tuesday, GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives raised his Netflix price target from $400 to $500 a share. He said the decision reflects “stronger than expected subscriber growth for the rest of 2018 and 2019” and continued growth in international markets. Netflix shares are currently trading at $397.75.”http://fortune.com/2018/06/19/netflix-stock-price/"

"Ok, time to bounce back to where it was before."
It probably will close around 490 and Half by EOY . It’s mature business and too much competition for this high PE .
Nice to see NFLX rising back up with FB sits under $200.
"Lmao...still above 500 pre market, down a mere 7.5 percent, and shorts are calling for the end. Analysts aren’t concerned meantime. Yeah I think I’ll stick with the analysts over know nothing yahoo bears. Everybody who had any degree of intelligence was expecting this quarter to be rough. Other than subscriber numbers this was a good quarter. There is room for more than one player in the streaming world. The idea yahoo bears have that NFLX will implode due to competition is not shared by most analysts. Watch as NFLX goes back to the highs."
NFLX had 24 movies that got Oscar nominations - more than any other movie producer - they will control this bizz like AMZN controls home delivery. Long on NFLX and will be adding along the way.
"It's really funny how all these ""expert"" analysts were predicting the demise of Netflix last summer and saying that when Disney launched its streaming platform how it would be the end of Netflix.

"The stock will rebound very quickly. They had another blockbuster quarter. Revenues exceeded guidance and growth of subscribers shattered expectations. The only blemish was earnings, which is not as important as growth. Here's the article............................Netflix Inc. logged another blockbuster quarter Thursday with the addition of 10.1 million new paid subscribers and a significant jump in revenue, and rewarded one of its most important executives with a promotion, but shares declined in after-hours trading on fears of slowing growth and a miss on profit.Netflix NFLX, +0.78% reported 10.1 million new subscribers in the second quarter, topping the 10 million mark for a second consecutive quarter amid shelter-in-place orders related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The company reported net earnings of $720 million, or $1.59 a share, compared with net income of $270.7 million, or 60 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. Revenue improved to $6.15 billion from $4.92 billion a year ago. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had expected adjusted earnings of $1.82 a share on sales of $6.08 billion.They also expected the addition of 8.21 million paid subscriptions, higher than Netflix’s forecast of 7.5 million in April. Netflix’s shares have soared 64% this year, while the broader S&P 500 index SPX, -0.34% has declined 0.5% in 2020.Netflix’s second-quarter results sent shares of the video-streaming giant down more than 10% in after-hours trading Thursday, following a four-month surge that has propelled its stock ($527.39 at the close) and market valuation (more than $230 billion) to record highs that eclipse streaming rivals like AT&T Inc. T, +1.30% and Verizon Communications Inc. VZ, +1.30% . In a letter to shareholders, Netflix executives admitted that the gains in the first half of the year were likely pulled forward from later in the year, which means fewer new subscribers in the rest of 2020.“In Q1 and Q2, we saw significant pull-forward of our underlying adoption leading to huge growth in the first half of this year (26 million paid net adds vs. prior year of 12 million),” executives said in the letter. “As a result, we expect less growth for the second half of 2020 compared to the prior year.”Netflix also announced a big change in its executive suite: Ted Sarandos, who has led their original-content efforts, was named co-CEO to shares the top spot with co-founder Reed Hastings."

"NFLX is finished - at least for the time being. All analysts have upgraded and pumped to the max, the stock is up 40% YTD, they will sing the same old story about international growth blah blah blah - but the facts are that NFLX is burning cash at an alarming rate, the stock is way overvalued and it has $10 billion of debt with no end in sight to the cash bleed, which means more debt issuance is unavoidable, which makes the stock more risky and the interest rate paid higher."

I see $360.00 today no problem. Big boys are coming in today and buying big blocks. Kaboom
Watch for $300 leading into the earning report. After earning $350+. Next rocket to a device near you coming up.
I can only speak from my experience - my kids are on netflix all the time (6 & 12) and they NEVER choose to watch any Disney films so will.I be shelling out for Disney? Nope and we have most of the films on dvd anyway.
BIG GAP DOWN TO CLOSE $550-$500BUY BUY BUY!WILL CLOSE VERY SOON!GO NFLX!
$485 tomorrow am
Notice that during the recent crash NFLX holds up better than the broader market. Not bad for a highly valued momentum stock.
tomorrow 348 and friday 360 should be tested.
Be careful with what Wall St is selling us. Tidepods & IBMs old legacy systems are not going to jump start the world economy.

place your bets here place your bets red or black where will the marble stop. the big guys already have the wheel rigged. remember trading places with Eddy Murphy. yeah those guys are real Mortimer is a real person they fix news reports no favor whatever outcome they want. these people have insiders in companies and get reports early is it illegal of course not. because the SEC is run by investment bankers

time to go green.
"$NFLX $WIMI $ZM I think as long as the company is good, you can hold on to it as long as you bought at reasonable price."
NFLX is no longer a future growth and revenue stock. Past quarter drawback is just an indicator of the future. Even Cramer indicated that in the past.
Great week. I loaded up on NFLX and CGC monday. Runs are not over. CGC might putts around before popping again but NFLX clearly going to breakout big into earnings. Not sure about earnings itself but will run up to next week.
Today Disney won back + 1.5% of the fall. Netflix was unable to grow and + 1% LOL
"with a PE Ratio (TTM) 276.80, did you see that? a good short."

Analyst average Price target: $628.26Wall Street high price target: $850Netflix makes up 2.5% of my portfolio and will make up about 5% of my portfolio by end of February. This prices is a steal.
Just imagine how many funds have NFLX in their current holdings. And you think they will allow it to fall??? Come on guys! Let’s get real here.
"Of all the surveys showing Netflix’s domination this one from Cowan stands out the most to me.Which do you use most to watch video?Netflix 27%, cable 20%, broadcast 18%, YouTube 12%2 important things that can be drawn from this data. People are willing to pay for premium video when there is enough to watch every day and Netflix has a whole lot of pricing power in reserve."
"Hope today's bullish momentum will continue until next Monday (Jan 13) when Oscar nomination will be declared and then will pause for the earning. If we consider a small portion of worldwide 3 billion Facebook users to have the potential to be Netflix users then it has a long way to go until it reach the saturation point.In the meanwhile, hope bulls will enjoy the current momentum."
"I have seen this before, debtflix drops 3% am, then goes up 5% pm."
Watch for a complete reversal. We will over $275 by end of this week and $300 by earning.
"Think about this- a year ago, this thing was $160."
sell
Will this push past $385 by 7/27?
shorts won the earnings guessing game. congrats.
The P/E ratio is over 200 where in reality it should be n/a. The free cash flow bologna is an accounting trick that Netflix uses. They are hemorrhaging cash. If they put content spend above the bottom line like every other company who has ongoing operating expenses an investor would get a much clearer picture that this company is losing TONS of money and will continue to lose tons of money as long as they employ this business model. It’s really a catch 22. Continue content spending hemorrhage cash. stock eventually goes down. Pair down content spending. Subscribers bail stock tanks. It’s a lose-lose scenario. It’s a broken business plan
What’s the value of 545 calls right now?
"Heading back towards it’s 200 day moving average ($336.31). If it can get back above that, it’s a good signal for even more upside."
value Viacom the same way you do netflix.and Viacom will be $400 a share.is that true
"Fourth solid greed day in a row.

I think it's going to turn green for good soon. They can't keep it down for long. Back to $375 by Friday.
should be fun day tomorrow
Not many better short candidates than NFLX. Field getting more crowded with lots of better capitalized players. You can't borrow mony forever.Short 300 here at $377.40
"With earning coming and the recent price upgrade to $650, NFLX should test all time highs and perhaps set new highs over the next two weeks."
The markets used to drive me crazy with losses. I almost left the trading game for good until a friend shared a little secret with me. He gets his best picks (one a week) from (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Join them.
You don’t raise prices when business bad. Huge number awaits us. How the market reacts is a different story but it’s all about subscriber growth. The rest of the report takes a back seat.
"Hey all you pessimists out there: nothing goes straight up and long term investors in nflx will do well indeed.A good business model, innovative team and good leadership will prevail despite the increased competition. Remember that nflx has evolved from a mail order business into a streaming behemoth? That should give you pessimists some pause and stop the selling nonsense and frenzy. Also, one quarter does not a trend maje."
ZERO upside to this market. People are just buying for the sake of buying and they are going to get crushed.
Wowww 
"Legendary media investor John Malone says scale is the most important factor, while Reed Hastings says it is engagement. Increasing engagement leads to low churn which leads to strong subscriber growth and pricing power, the 2 things needed to build scale."

 Netflix ￼indicted by Tyler County TX grand jury for controversial cuties movie 
It took many years for mobile phone companies to catch up with Apple. And it’s going to take many years for Apple and Disney to catch up with Netflix. They have to start spending 15 bn a year to just stay on the same level with Netflix who spends 15 bn and has the lowest cost per subscriber. The current drop in Netflix price will reverse out in 6 months and it’s a buying opportunity today.
"Maybe we will get more analyst upgrades tomorrow morning. Cash burn of $3.5 billion in 2019, up from $3.0 billion previously. US subscriber adds are plateauing in Q2, and will likely begin to fall in 2H 2019."
"They are going to throw a good day in there every now and then to get the public to think everything is ok but the market is tanking lower and lower. The dow will be under 23k soon. The good days will go up just a tad to trick people to put their money in so they can trap you the following day. One day up 100 points, the next day down 300-500 points."
Not enough content worth watching. I get 1 month year. Watch what is necessary then cancel.
$FUBO buying now it’s like buying $NFLX first 2 years IPO I was in heavy trading many times pre split in the $1s to $2 levels. Some Ppl got way so scared back then when Netflix was losing money but the growths #s was real same thing $FUBO today. I always got in selloff.
"Man, their income statement and cash flow is an absolute mess. If you handed these financials to any CPA and removed the name of the company, he would be advising you to seek a bankruptcy attorney"
"Was in @ 220, but Over 70% gain in 3month. Really? It might be just undervalued or just too fast. This need to slow down a bit for the long run"
Congrats to all who bought in at 340's at open - that was a Prime day gift
"nflx will have a solid qtr er. i bet the stock rises substantially with good guidance and analysts upgrades. hastings should split the shares, remove cuties from its programming."
"Earning next week. While last 2 Quater history is on Long side, They have to remember stock more than double this year. This is not earning where investor will overlook any negative. Also those paid by Investor scheme can't sustain and reset required time to time.While Company sure going to add good number of subscriber as Many Cable provider now include with bundle, Paid by investor scheme used in larger scale & buzz is still out there on netflix. All those going to help.But most of subscriber it adding is lower quality subscriber including paid by investor + 125 millions subscriber has many different reason to leave including why just use one streaming service when you can rotate between them.Also marketing cost is keep going up and expect same.Content cost might much higher than expected based on recent Goldman Such analysis (Again you cant trust analyst, it's possible he has detail and it trying to pre announce in order to reduce hit on stock price when reality kick in)All of this thing + ever increasing content cost raise (Including paying millions for signup bonus) going to make financial worst ever.Market didn't care until now about it but might suddenly start caring with raising interest rate environment."
"If NFLX chart looked like TSLA chart, 360 is top Bollinger Band and should be easily touched!"
It’s early but the fact that this isn’t up significantly premarket indicates another day of selling pressure is very likely. We will likely retest $470 and $460 or even $450 is on the table if the trend out of faang continues beyond today. I’m in a watch and see mode today. Same with Apple and Amazon. Hopefully I’m wrong and this can rebound today but I’m just being realistic.

"Words around that there's boycott for NFLX since Rice become board of director, follows by Obamas multi year's deal. Is that true? If this continue I think NFLX may go down further. Overseas subscribers maynot follow through, there maybe more competition for domestic overseas that we don't know but NFLX and some may now."
if chipotle can recover so can netflix. this is a small dent for longs to hold for a while. I meann 3 years ago it was 700 a share and split 7 ways to 100 a share now it's back up again to 400. when facebook dipped in from of Congress we all thought it was over no it games 50 points since then. this is just a slowdown if your a day trader trying to make quick cash.
"Investing in new content is not the same as investing in infrastructure. A long term asset like property plant and equipment that has a useful life of 30 years and will produce cash flow during that span of time is not the same as borrowing to finance content. Who watches a movie twice? Borrowed, spent, watched and gone."
Looks like another up day. Glad I'm still in the game. Impressive.
It will reach all time high again by the end of next week.Who agree with me give a thumbs up...
"Joe Biden just bought some shares. He's like ""where the cuties at?"""

Very lofty today. Rise NFLX rise!
Disney has kids movies an NFLX has original academy award winning adult content. How do you compare the 2. NFLX is set up now to surprise on earnings next Tuesday
I'm looking for 545-560 strike ahead of earnings. not a huge move 5-7% by the 19th.
i was about to buy stocks just prior to earnings and put a stop loss just in case it drops. Then I thought forget it and left home. Now I come back and it's up 13% -.-
Barry & Michael ruin Netflix!
"I’ve seen worse with other stocks, Dell and CSCO, in early 2000’s, NFLX will bounce back, 15% drop after earnings isn’t that bad. Netflix is a solid company."

"You know, with a massive upgrade by Heath Terry, who upgraded the Top on Amzn, the very DAY Nflx topped at all time highs, Upgrades, says 50% upside this week for Netflix and the Stock drops, When you have a Stock dropping on upgrades your out of Steam"
The coin flip is still in play. Does it go to $550 plus before ER or does it go toward $500 again? I have a small position while waiting to get a better idea of the sentiment. But is anyone else concerned that the ER itself could be trouble? I feel like sub numbers are a question mark.
"PRICE TARGET -> $500.00Netflix has reaped the benefits of people having to stay at home during the peak of the coronavirus pandemic, but the real reason to buy the stock might be the company's international growth story, according to RBC Capital Markets .Analyst Mark Mahaney reiterated an Outperform rating and $500 price target on Netflix shares (ticker: NFLX) on Tuesday, writing that his thesis is underpinned by the company's success during the pandemic and its expansion in Mexico and beyond."
"Bitcoin falls off the map, be prepared to exit your position. Selloff started bloodbath tomorrow morning"

"Netflix has 3 of the top 4 shows on Rotten Tomatoes (the #1, 2, and #4 ). They also have 3 of the top 5 shows on IMDB (including #1, #3, and 5). As netflix climbs the wall of worry and shows improved cash flow(as they have stated) in 2020, and has low expectations, I expect in 2020 we could get a double. As this is a massive secular shift with cord cutting accelerating world wide and Netflix is in a pole position. A service synonymous with streaming, making local language productions all around the globe."

"NFLX borrowing rate is growing 3x faster than its profits, meaning they are becoming more and more cash flow negative. Can someone explain to me how people think this is sustainable?Any hiccups in subscriber growth as well as rising interest rates could cause their business model to collapse almost in an instant."
"Stock market is pretty much unstoppable at the moment. Doesn't look good for earnings season if they take out all the cream ahead of the announcements. Goldman called for $400 on NFLX by the end of the year, not the end of the month."

Hello! Come join us! Plenty of room for growth!
Netflix is old news...content liabilities are off the charts... to be honest not a very strong balance sheet when you take this into consideration.
"The often over looked technology aspect of Netflix.And there advantage, in terms of both streaming video and audio quality, compared to others:https://www.digitaltrends.com/movies/hbo-and-game-of-thrones-should-learn-a-lesson-from-netflix-and-stranger-things/"
It might sell off from $550 but honestly it overreacted to downside last quarter. It’s the best in field. I thought too risky to hold into earnings but those who gambled worked out well
AMC has taken off. Buy AMC before it it late. AMC heading to squeeze. 
How's your Obama series working for ya now?

"If it breaks $340 tomorrow, the next support is around $280."
"Good morning everyone. I’m 82 years young. I rarely comment on these message boards, but wanted to jump in for a few moments. I’ve held NFLX since August of 2016. over the years, its had some significant dips in price and management has made some bonehead errors, but, they have always pivoted and evolved as needed. Investing and trading isn’t for the feint of heart. You can read every news article, every financial, and perform technical analysis until you are blue in the face—sh$t still happens. NFLX has always made the appropriate change and tweaked the model as needed. When they stop doing that, then you sell. But, if I had sold out every time bad news hit a stock that I invested in, I’d be a security guard somewhere, not enjoying breakfast in the tropics. NFLX will drop probably another $60 to $80 dollars, then be flat for a few weeks, before its next run. Look to load up if you can. See you on the other side of 700 by year’s end."
Nflx is no longer a one trick pony streaming service. It's also a movies producer aka pocket Hollywood.
I can’t stop watching Netflix. Amazing. People complain about a little increase. Lol too the moon selling half at 660
people staying home a lot more now because of corona and watching movies buy nflx!!
Thumbs up for $500+Thumbs down for $400-Assuming the change as +/-50 after earnings..Lets gauge peoples opinion on this board???
"Buy FUBO/ROKU, and sell this--it's played out for years. I see a buy @300."

"If you’re a day trader, you should definitely check out (http://Thetraderguide.com). They send a watchlist covering the top pre-market movers every day before the open. It’s a great way to pick out potential trades for the day."
All in
"it's just a matter of time before NFLX signs a partnership with IQ to deliver it's content in China. IQ is a great avenue for NFLX to expand and become recognize in China. hold on to your stock .let the traders and shortie's continue to create trade volume in the stock, eventually IQ is destine to trade at a higher price."

what is going on? It wend down after bought it and went up after i sold it.
FAANG are back.
I think the buyback will start at price 480-490$

Time to abandon ship. Disney is pulling its collection from Netflix.
so do u think it's better to hold till earnings or sell as soon as price shoots slightly up?
"I grew up in the 80’s. Mom and pop vhs video rentals ruled the movie scene. In the 90’s, and early 2000’s Blockbuster and Movie Gallery put out the mom and pops. In the mid 2000’s Netflix put out Blockbuster and Movie Gallery ... What happens next?"
"400 soon !! All shorties, thanks for your purchase to push share price much higher."
HUYA will triple before NFLX gets here sea legs back
Jim... you don't get it. No one is canceling $12 Netflix to buy $7 Disney for their kids. You're better than that. Come on.
"Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) was given a new $375.00 price target on by Barclays PLC ( ) (analyst Kannan Venkateshwar). They now have a ""buy"" rating on the stock. 6.6% upside from the current price of $351.74."
The listing under foreign films is amazing. From almost every country on the planet there are many films to watch. THAT'S where Netflix's growth will continue to come from.
The day before Netflix releases its quarterlies Deutsche Bank - fined over $600 million for laundering billions for the Russians stated that Netflix has a great chance of missing its numbers. Great. Thanks Deutsche Bank - where international mob cartels go to launder money and where Donald Trump has gotten his projects financed for the past 20 years. A name to trust.
"Wow, positive 1.55 after hours.."
Ok. whats the story today??
Keep raising cost and people will reduce there service. I just switched from ultimate to standard. So no price hike for me.

Why is this dropping so much? This has been dead Money for months
With all the suspense over subscriber growth heading into the ER we know it's by far the most important thing for Netflix. Then it also has to be the most important thing for Netflix's competitors. Netflix competitors don't have that much subscriber growth. So if Netflix adds 1 or 2 million more subscribers than expected then it makes sense the stock can gap up 10-20% and trade at a new all time high price to sales ratio because there are no competitors that are doing the same.

"Netflix options imply 19.3% move in share price post-earnings (TheFlyOnTheWall)BY The Fly— 2:49 PM ET 04/21/2020Pre-earnings options volume in Netflix is 1.3x normal with calls leading puts 7:4. Implied volatility suggests the market is anticipating a move near 19.3%, or $84.95, after results are released. Median move over the past eight quarters is 4.6%."
"When Goldman analyst upgraded $500 share; it was a trap and I kept warning retail investors. Goldman will buy to cover and take profit tomorrow.

Ok.. This is the Netflix board and we shouldn't discuss Disney here but we have to be honest... Everybody loves a good Disney movie with some hot chocolate and popcorn on a rainy sunday afternoon... But... A month has 31 days isn't it??
Do you like to watch the lion king 50 times in a row and star wars cartoons with a banal plot and poor graphics paying $ 7 for this or the original diverse content of Netflix? Disney is growing due to crazy investor support and when the week passes we will look at the situation objectively

Cramer just now on CNBC: ""I advise buying a Netflix post-earnings dip if shares fall lower than where they are now.""I get that he's paid to be bullish to help increase ad revenue, but he needs to stop weighing in on every stock trying to convince traders to buy who don't know any better."
330 open close 340
Looks like the Covid trade has run its course...
Their foreign growth potential is through the roof and that is where the real future growth lies. India is just now is now just in the first inning and NFLX is well positioned there. A market much larger than USA. Ditto for Southeast Asia. The next two ER’s will be blockbusters (no pun intended) as Q3 and Q4 normally are and this current price will look dirt cheap. Amateur hour selling this morning and that’s why I bought in at the open and made $30/share. I am not a trader I buy and hold. This baby had a long way to go. IMHO
"NFLX IS SO EASY TO BUY ON WEAKNESS. It will always recover and make new highs, ONCE THE DUST SETTLES. ONLY QUESTION: WILL YOU BE IN when it does? "
CBS beats on 33% growth in licensing revenue. Very smart CEO over there who knows the only way to grow is by partnering with Netflix.

It's only down 11% from the $400 it was before the ER. That's in a fairly robust market. Tells me it has a lot farther to fall if the market weakens at all. Today's tech spike couldn't save it from falling some more. Look for $320 soon.

"The way they switch the algos is just unreal, The correlations are changed to capture liquidity on both sides, someone is printing money off of the put buyers..."
$265-$270 is definitely possible but I may be selling and going the other-way at the 20-day moving average. Still in a downtrend unless it breaks through that level on volume.
Not a horrible drop. Horrible I mean by Apple losing 30%.
This will be a 600 dollar stock in no time
short squeeze tomorrow?
you didn't hear the cdc
imagine selling $nflx in 2013 after it's fall ....
"$YSG $WIMI $NIO $NFLX The fastest time for a stock to rise is that many people are not optimistic about it. Once they are optimistic about it, the price will not move, because those who bought it have bought it, and there is no driving force for it to rise. There are many such examples"

"Tomorrow is an option expiration Friday, may open +$4-$5 just to clear some options. Nothing that hasn't been seen before."

"prime, disney+, hulu, hbo max, starz, discovery.... monopoly is over... programming sucks and worse than cable re rate increases... also political bs alienates 50% of us viewership. sold at 564, shorted same day price. initial basis 120... all is good."
in a swift move of a hand we have recovered..... up only 199% now....
"My last post for NFLX today. We should get a dead cat bounce first thing tomorrow morning but again all technicals STILL indicate a downward trend! Set another intraday low towards close of mrkt; with the exception of the 9 day RSI, all other RSIs are still in the low 40s indicating more room for selling pressure to hit; 9 day RSI is only 38 so still bearish. If the S&P rips higher tomorrow (at least 1% higher) NFLX might break even; if there's any market weakness, I expect to see NFLX in the low 260s and if it breaks 260, my 252 support comes into play for the next few days. I'm short NFLX (Nov puts) and was surprised at that pop after earnings came out but overall, reality check is coming in and the shorts will continue to pound this stock lower. Good luck to all the shorts as I hope to make some decent profits by Friday at the latest!!"

Recently cancelled Netflix as it is getting too expensive and the content is so so. Retained Amazon Prime and Sky here in the UK which has pretty good content.
HUGE buys at the close.
Anybody else heard rumor that Netflix is planning on bundling MoviePass into their subscription?
"Growth stocks like $NFLX and $FB can't continue to have huge earnings beats and exceed these monumental expectations set out by ""the street"" because eventually they hit a wall. That's what we're seeing now...doesn't mean they're terrible companies, just means they're human after all. Stuff doesn't go up forever. Even $AMZN will hit that wall sooner or later"
Come to buy AMC. AMC is taking off with theaters opening and vaccines available. Squeeze is imminent. 
How will they meet revenue and earnings projections for this year with the severely decreased subscriber growth? CEO will need to pull a rabbit out of his hat.
"Wait until after the shutdown for the real major leg down. Because of the government shutdown, the Treasury hasn’t been issuing checks at its usual pace. In the first half of January when it was expected to issue $75 billion in new debt, it has issued ZERO! That’s $75 billion that gets to live in the financial markets for another couple of days, in fact as long as the government shutdown grinds on.. That will keep the stock and bond markets liquified, when they would otherwise have been starved for cash."
Netflix now has a higher market cap then Disney!
"U.S. subscriber growth looks particularly weak when you compare it to 2018 — Netflix has only seen 2.1 million net additions domestically in the first nine months of 2019, compared to 4.1 million in the same period of 2018. Netflix’s investor letter seems to blame this on price hikes earlier this year.“Since our US price increase earlier this year, retention has not yet fully returned on a sustained basis to pre-price-change levels, which has led to slower US membership growth,” the company says. “On a member base of more than 60m, very small movements in churn can have a meaningful impact on paid net adds.”"
Oversold the last few days. Buy the dips. Disney and Netflix will co-exist in the post cable cord cutting world of video streaming.

"Netflix going down to 100 per share, should not even be valued at that. only makes 12B in revenue"
Holding and watching this earnings
"People need to step back and see the forest from the trees. Their is a seismic shift happening and an acceleration of cord cutting. Netflix is still very small compared with cable subscribers.Their will be multiple winners, and Netflix is in a fantastic position. The losers will be traditional cable.Netflix addressed this fact on their release regarding so called competition,""In our view, the likely outcome from the launch of these new services will be to accelerate the shift from linear TV to on demand consumption of entertainment. Just like the evolution from broadcast TV to cable, these once-in-a-generation changes are very large and open up big, new opportunities for many players. For example, for the first few decades of cable, networks like TBS, USA, ESPN, MTV and Discovery didn’t take much audience share from each other, but instead, they collectively took audience share from broadcast viewing."""
Netflix...always trying my patience.
"Competition beginning to heat up. Apple, Disney, and others on the way."
Options Friday will close at $282.50 or better. Nice week.$$$$$ I'll take it.
"I think today I have been convinced that we are going back to 350. This is just a slow drip at this point. All of us in above 400 will have the problem of people selling when they make a good profit. This have us locked in for while. I don't think I will hold through another ER report again, not worth the risk."
"Called it after earnings it would drop between 310-315. It did that and more. I hope those who sold after earnings (me) reinvested the last two days (me). If the markets are good this week and into next week with other big names reporting strong earnings, NFLX will be back to 320 range."
Big reversal pre market...from up 3 to down 1. Yikes
This seems to be the start of the end of the bull market. To many companies are being high and now the main support stocks in the markets... just my thoughts!
Netflix may be the most overvalued big cap stock of all time.
360 to 330 is only 30 points and reasonableit was 343 three days agoit was 242 or so four months agonow the competion matters and the PE's normalize by NFLX selling offDIS PE 18Apple PE 16.78NFLX PE 133Even Amazon's PE is only 92.5 and they add a new business twice a year
I own NFLX and will not sell for 5 to 10 years. I see this as a 1500 dollars stock.
bye shorts
Just bought 10 at 382 what yall think
"Lovely discount - panic sell, back up tomorrow :) thanks guys"
"Well, I'm ruined. Nothing I can do but hold my short now and pray for a miracle. Too much margin. The system is rigged."
If it goes up today. It would be an Ascending Triangle breakout. Time to cover short and go long.
Everything is gonna be alright
"in my honest opinion in nflx is a good company. However, I believe its hand is overplayed. DISNEY is not just another company its a brand WORLDWIDE. After hearing Bob Iger speak on cnbc I believe that Disney stock price will rise substantially. I still think Nflx is a good company but its exclusivity and domination has passed."
When is earning report? 3 weeks from now?$1000 stock in 6 months? or earlier?
You can’t fault FANG for being online businesses during the internet boom. They all face intense competition except for Netflix whose competition gets weaker every year.
Valuation and earnings don't matter for this stock. This is going to 700 or moe EOY.
"This stock could go back to it's 52 week LOW and still have a ridiculous PE ratio. Why is NVDA constantly criticized for 30x forward earnings, and this thing is allowed to run wild? Unfortunately, I think a larger haircut is coming here. Eventually, being realistic has to win out."
"My opinion, this is pure homogenized BS. Granted it missed subscription metrics, but it still topped earnings estimates. Quarterly revenue growth is 26%. No reason short of massive manipulation for a drop of this magnitude."
"$BA $NIO $WIMI $NFLX Without a strong heart, really hard to survive in the market, the volatility of the market is intense, the pressure is huge to investors, if can't bear the pressure, then enter the market itself is a mistake, in the market every day will be, under such an environment, want to make money that is difficult."

My luck we’ll lose the entire gain by week’s end.
"One thing I omitted in my review of the balance sheet was the 21B worth of capitalized content costs. For non financial people, that means instead of expenses to the P and L, they are capitalizing and will amortize over a specific period of time. This number grew from 13B to 21B. This seems like some creative accounting and could be an issue down the road. Do your own DD but I have a funny feeling that in time, and might not be long, this number will be questioned and the small EPS number Netflix has could in reality be a loss."

So the stock is 100 points down because they guessed new users wrong!!
20m short interest shares need to be covered.

"Ow my haha. Netflix rules big time. I have been with the stock almost from the beginning. Made me so much money. Drop big, buy more."
I guessed wrong. Cost me 10k in puts. I really thought we were at netflix fatigue. Congrats to everybody who's about to get paid off tomorrow!
Only down because the market tanked hard. Was green for most of the day. Still outperformed today compared to most! This is a stay at home winner.It might drop some more but I think I'll be picking up along the way. It should retest highs in the coming weeks/months.
The market love the current price.. strong rejection of lower one.
Netflix is capitalizing the expense of content creation and getting tax exemption for it. Interest rates are low great time to borrow to expand. The have reached a scale where their sub base generates cash and gives them bargaining power like no other competitor. Sub demand is pretty inelastic. They can raise prices 10% without losing a single sub. Ppl only talk abt cancelling Netflix they rarely do then they come right back
$270 TARGET!---Netflix stock price target raised to $270 from $175 at SunTrust RH
Every rational business owner(if you own stock...you are one)....should ask themselves is this business only worth 155B. Maybe to wall street it is for now after the earnings..who knows. But if one believes the projected 2B+ in profis they do for 2019 is just the beginning of the scaling...it ain't. Your decision. Its a good offer though not going to lie..Z
stock split incoming
"This beeing not 300 now shows the market is still delusional. The young generation never loast money in the market , seems like they need a "" lesson"". A lesson about pe and why pe forward earnings mean something."
"I just carefully read over there financials. This is a bubble that is going to burst. No doubt about it. The cost to acquire and keep the business is far greater than the revenues generated from this business, and the problem is the more they grow the more there expenses increase. It’s like a reverse scale that has no possibility of reversing itself (at least that I can see)"
"Netflix should tank back to the 250-300 range, buying range. It shouldn’t have climbed so high."
nice recovery. closes virtually unchanged.

Netflix needs to buy this new Co when it comes out

"In Q2 they added 2.7 million subscribers, below the 5 million forecast. But here’s the thing people are missing. Most of the 152 million subscribers got a 15-20% price increase which leads to more revenue which leads to more content which leads to more subscribers. The forecast is for 7 million subscriber adds this quarter, a million more than analysts were expecting."

"You can’t expect that much from Disney streaming going forward when all together with ABC, FX, Hulu, Disney+ they have no TV series that show up in last week’s IMDb top 10 while Netflix has 7 of the top 10 TV shows."
It's so great to be invested in a stock that market makers and fund managers want to see over $400 regardless on what's going on in the world or all Wall Street. Congrats to the rest of you longs that got in over the last 3 months. Sometimes making money in stocks is really this easy. And remember shorts... NEVER bet against momentum or the desire of what fund managers want the outcome to be for a stock. $400+ next month my friends!
Bears let’s spread word wide and far..Nflx is not a tech company! Nflx is a only a media company! Just basic media company!!! HBO nbc abc Disney fox time warner Nflx etc Thing is Nflx is the smallest and has the worst content....
What good is holding any tech thru earnings? it just gives it back over the next few days.
"Just curious, with Netflix being so heavy with debt, what is the hit to earnings if interest rates start going up (they are already going up)? Not trying to be a shortie here, wondering if anyone has done the math."
so is $300 a week away or 2 weeks ? Thx.
buying opportunity...
The big picture is that we will hit 660
They better not miss again with a high P/E!
$530+ this week would be nice.
It’s going to keep running the rest of this week. Another 5-7% more based on last 6 earnings where up more than 5%. Expect EOW $352-$360
Going to FLY tomorrow.. fasten your seatbelts gentleman.
Both netflix and disney will be winners of streaming in the end.
"Breaking: Netflix price target raised to $550 from $465 at Credit SuisseCredit Suisse analyst Douglas Mitchelson raised the firm's price target on Netflix to $550 from $465 ahead of quarterly results, while keeping an Outperform rating on the shares. The analyst notes that subscriber growth expectations are justifiably high heading into result, as Netflix app downloads reflect continued strong underlying trends that have been helped by shelter-in-place, reduced competition, momentum building in Asia, content success and a lack of price increases. Mitchelson now sees Q2 global net adds of 10.55M, ahead of Street/guide for 7.5M. While he continues to expect that second half of the year comps will be tougher, the analyst believes Netflix's increasing content advantage and ""the Asia flywheel fully spinning up"" will bolster confidence in sustainable growth."
CFO stepping down for a company like NFLX is usually good for a a 2-3% decline. Hanging in there pretty good.

"NFLX, this is as good as it gets. As NFLX assumes the streamer throne, incremental growth becomes increasingly difficult. Meanwhile amortized content costs start to hit the income statement and carrying costs for the debt funded content binge increase. But today NFLX is lying on the beach basking in the sun. Maybe we will social distance for another 10 months and interest rates will continue to fall. Ah, life is good!"
"Holiday coming up, big brokers take this week off, next week we should make a significant move!"
"Potential for earnings per share in 5 years at subscription maturity is about $10 per share. At that time market will value Netflix like Apple around 20 times earnings. So, in 5 years your investment in Netflix will mature to about $200 per share. GREAT INVESTMENT in you are buying at $340!"
This will be back to over 510 tomorrow. Major selloff because of Capitol!
This is just straighten out itself to move back up again. Start buying don’t let this short guys scare you. The BULLS are back and strong
this should be up
No more price hikes for Debtflix. That poses a major problem for all of the analyst cash flow models that factor in higher subscription prices in subsequent years
NFLX never dies because money makers favorite just like Bitcoin. $340 this week.
good entry point.

"People who have to go back to work have far, far less use for things like Netflix. Expect this and other streaming media stocks will see zero or even negative growth in subscribers in 2021. When they are pumped up to the moon with inflated values justified by future growth, that's going to be bad, really bad."
Apple would never buy a company such as Netflix which is overpriced but mainly does not own most of the content it streams. Apple wants IP.
I just saw Todd Gordon genius explaining on CNBC why he thought nflx would go down today. And then he taught the viewers how to read a candle chart. I wonder what these so called top analysts studied during thier school years

"I'm a LT investor in NFLX, in at $88/share. If you only invest in the stock and not actually consume the service, you are truly not seeing the potential of the impact NFLX has. I'm a Moderate, so this news about Susan Rice and signing on the Obama's to produce some shows has no decision on my investment. If people can look past that, they can see the value of this platform. I just finished watching ""Trump the American Dream"" and I can say it was fascinating to see how he achieved winning the Presidency and I had no idea how much of it was influenced by Pat Buchanan and Jesse Ventura. In short, you don't like what's streaming, you can scroll right through the listing, but if you open your mind to varying viewpoints, I like that NFLX offers me choices."
subs all that matters Netflix so cheap they can keep raising prices as long as content is getting better
"Okay, so Disney and Apple are out with their streaming game plan, let the streaming game begin. If it was a 100 yard dash, NFLX is waiting at 50 yard for Apple and Disney to catch up!!"
More news tomorrow regarding content!! Futures are looking great as well. Up 15 points tomorrow!

LONG BABY! 
When NFLX keeps going up
any idea how low can this go ?
Streaming is a winner takes all market. Netflix can price its service below the cost/subscriber of competing services. Unless Amazon Prime or Disney+ can catch Netflix in subscribers they will never be profitable and will need to cut spending. Subscriber growth will slow as a result and eventually they will be priced out of the marked by Netflix.
Just like last ER. Sellers own the day and the rip higher starts tomorrow at the open.
"Someone bought 159,000 shares after hours"
Cord cutting continues and nflx will do just fine. The drop is an opportunity to buy some shares because it will be $400 but the end of the year.

What you guys think where Nflx would b by Friday
Netflix is over 400 today.
So let me see? he shorts then bashes on CNBC or tweeter. Isn't that what they do when they tell you to buy stocks that they already own on CNBC/ I see it as activity that should be illegal in all cases - if you mention a stock sell or buy on public network like CNBC - you can't close that position for 30 days/ Perod

Overall that workout about 9% of value.Is All Subscriber cost raised already? Does any one has any clue where they stand on price raise.I will put my answer in reply.

The price drop is not because of current earnings..but because of Q3 subscriber growth which is just 2.5M..expecting it to drop to 420 next week

In developing country scope of such service is never significant. For example in India, Netflix still struggling.While it admire how quickly NFLX gone international, valuation can't justified given not as much growth left in market where it popular and affordable."
We need an investigation in the NASDAQ INC. for rigging the exchange. On every down day because of low volume they drop the prices significantly in order to get people to trade and make them money.

Happy for Netflix investors! Congratulations!
Charts show NFLX breaking out over $500 this year. Market cap is still very low relative to earnings and potential. This stock is still in the first or second inning of a great game still to come. There are few stories as exciting as NFLX. Perhaps TSLA is the other rare one.
"NFLX is one of the companies which does not have many competition. Even if one wants to buy other platforms a study shows they too have NFLX. The customers and families throughout the world have adapted NFLX into their daily or weekly routine. This will double in the years to come. Its has a buy rating by many analysis. I too know this will have a ""20% gain at least"" within 2 years."
Netflix will go to $500 by August.
green soon and big green later
honestly I unsubscribed personally month ago I thinkni watch everything what was watchable and the only think what makes me use netflix was the dobly vision and 4k quality of content and the user friendly interface otherwise you can find everything in piracy sites..... is not worth to sit and pay every month's 15£ for netflix
Takes a strong stomach to hold onto NFLX.
buy AAPL
Impeachment will hurt growth and the market is looking at P/E and this one is too high.
My guess is Netflix beats handily but the stock sells off in spite of it
Thumbs up if you have a good feeling about this round. I do.
$370/$380 by Friday
"during earning season, an ultra short term trading is still the best profiting strategy. after majority reporting done and evaluating all risk, holding for long term will make a safer bet. too much noise right now. I don't even know who to believe, including myself."

This has been the most rewarding turnaround I've experience this year. Up $40 in a couple hours. Go go go NFLX and thank you!
This is why after hours numbers are generally meaningless.
"Everyone knows about Netflix. Netflix is the biggest streaming site in the world. The confidence and the trust for Netflix is really high. The stock value is about 80 times more than the revenue, we feel confident in that, price target higher than todays value.I wanna give you a tips. a streaming site, Mavshack, that has been active as long as the Netflix was active until 2011 had a stock value not even three times more then the revenue until a few days ago. In 2011 Netflix was worth as most 48 dollars, only a year later in 2012 it went down to $7, even though Netflix had 26 million subscribers, it was increasing in subscribers. Netflix was worth in its bottom only $7.00. Today 2020 Netflix is worth around $500. That means that Netflix increased its stock value with more than 7000% since its bottom in 2012. Mavshack have had a similar road until now as Netflix had its first 10 year on the market until 2012. Mavshack is increasing alot in the amount of subscribers. But the stock value have not shown its true value. The stock value has been very volatile and also has been on a down side for a long time. many investors been sceptical an pessimism have been around the stock for a while.But now its going to be a change, December 3rd 2020 it was announced that Mavshack will start Europe's largest shopping studio in collaboration with the NEP the world's leading technical production company for live productions and events. together with an EP marshak Salma has created the market's most elegant and cost effective VR studio. the market cap of Mavshack is only around 12 million American dollars. the stock is around its bottom. I can't see it getting much lower than it is now.. Now many feel like it's abiously that the stock is going to increase. With more good news about the streaming, live-sport coming up after realease of corona-restrictions and also the live shopping studio this stock can increase very rapidly and high in stock value. My own price target for this stock is around 400% for the upcoming year. I have been following this company for a long time and now I see a bright future for the company, its been an annoying ride until now. Please do your own anilyses and look this up. I feel very sure about that this stock is going to increase a lot upcoming years even though nothing in this world is totally sure. Maybe you would like to invest little in mavshack to get a big opportunity to get a big return out of it . I would still say Netflix is a more safe option but Mavshack is a great spice to it. Have a lot more potential to grow away higher in percentage. Have a pleasant day"

Disney+ is better.
Pull back only next week. Until then 270+ is expected. Could be more. Lots of shorts now running to cover.
Technical analysis is slightly bearish almost neutral. I’d like to ask the yahoo community to vote here! Bullish btw! Can nflx foreign subscriber miss 3 in a row here?
"OK, it's down 3 days in a row. Down $36 or 9.1% based on the lower sub growth. Right now, it's hard to imagine this ever going up again. You can picture another big down day tomorrow, with traders wanting to get out of their positions before the weekend. There is new competition coming, negative cash flow that's ongoing, and a bloated PE that's hard to justify. On the other hand, I've thought that same way many times in the past, and somehow this thing always turns around and powers to new highs. This is the most loved stock I've ever experienced and I'm betting it turns around and eventually gets back to $400. I know that sounds crazy right here and some day this has to turn down and return to a ""normal"" PE. But I'm betting this has one more run up before that happens. I admit I may be wrong but I have history on my side."
Dumpster fire!
Roku guided lower...should help NFLX who already guided much higher.

"Sorry to say it, but with all these new excellent streaming services coming, how will it not hurt Netflix?"
The days of NFLX's monopoly on streaming entertainment are long gone. Everybody is doing it now. Their multiple will merge towards the mean of entertainment companies.
This things is obviously going to test the post earnings 344 low.
The quarter could be great but it’s about retention as well. I think Netflix is really good with quality original shows.

No doubt after hours yesterday was meaningless.
"Good Morning folks, the shorts are being set up (shorts trap)......price will move to $450+ later on today."
With streaming competitors unable to make a profit Netflix is a buy under 600.
"Breaking: Loop Capital raises Netflix price target to $650 (from $600) Loop Capital analyst Alan Gould raised the firm's price target on Netflix to $650 from $600 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares. The company is becoming ""the master of its own domain"" with enough self-funded content available and in production so as not to be dependent on any specific titles produced by others, the analyst tells investors in a research note. Gould adds that Netflix has continued to grow subs and content sourcing despite the launches of Disney+, HBO Max and Peacock as well as navigating more limited content available from three of the major media conglomerates."
Why the jump?
#IQ volume 42.84 Mil #Netflix 6.83 Mil
Back to 300.
Watch for a major drop. Price is getting way ahead of the financials. Soon there will be a correction and watch the frothy stocks get a 40-50% cut.
Nflx isn't nearly as good as HBO Max in my opinion....

If AMC go higher because of the new Hollywood’s new release how many Netflix new shows will start to pop once this COVID is over. Very good growth potential for the content.
NFLX barely has a presence in China which is the primary reason for AAPL's revenue issues. Robots are trading this. Will snap back tomorrow when actual people are trading.

NFLX does not make more money if people watch more. They have to pay out more in streaming COSTS which hurts margins.

Wages are a mess. it's going to take some time for the market to truly show us what is up. this is all gossip driven at this point. prices are up....but loans are cheap. hrmmm"
"Netflix has had easy wins with Hulu, Amazon, YouTube, and HBO. There are no contenders left after Disney and Apple. The stock will surge if the early reports on subscriber growth are not good for Disney and Apple."
"Let me know how high the NFLX will go by end of Friday considering the following... 1, Massive Q2 earning on Thursday after hr. Most countries in the world, lockdown started in Q2. 2, Goldman just raised the price to 670. If it gain 3 or 4 % daily next week, it'll reach there. 3, A lot of momentum. 3 days straight (7 out of 9) in green with a spike on Friday. It'll continue. 4, Record Spike in Covid19 continue with some states looming back to closing."
just remember they hit their earnings estimate people. the funds just look for a reason to lower the price temporarily so they can buy more
Could an educated intelligent long tell me why this is up and how it deserves the valuation the market is giving it?
Last 8 days after they announce earningsJuly 19 2016 -12.97Oct 18 2016 18.99Jan 19 2017 5.15April 18 2017 -3.89July 18 2017 21.90Oct 17 2017 -3.20Jan 23 2018 22.71April 17 2018 28.28July 17 2018 -21.00

who's excited?
Ok guys.. 300 is very near.. we should break it and move past that by the end of the week!

"Sympathies to all those who sold. Likewise, congratulations to all those visionaries who bought and continue to hold. Onwards and upwards."
"17 films nominated in 36 categories for the Oscars Sunday, with only half the regular content for the year"
"As long as growth keeps occurring and content keeps improving, the debt is not an issue. Ad revenue hasn't even been discussed, which I'm sure is in their long term plan (a NFLX basic plan that's cheaper but has ads, a NFLX Premium plan to skip the ads). They can get 80 million sets of eyeballs on a movie in a week. Think about that. That's the equivalent of Kardashian's Instagram, and she gets hundreds of thousands of dollars per post. Completely untapped revenue. The key metric right now is growth."
"Netflix changes its view on ‘views,’ which will boost its numbers by 35%"
LOL....the bears are just piling on...one bad quarter and it's all over NFLX. You all need to get off those hallucinogens...not every quarter is going to be great....the analysts are still bullish. Everyone was expecting subscriber numbers to slow down. I expect many thumbs down but you shorts will all go back into hiding once this rallies back to 550. I've owned NFLX since 2013 and know how this story ends. This is not the end of the world. Get off the drugs and go to rehab...those of you who are going short right now are too late...the time to do that was before the market closed today. That window is gone now. The stock will be bottoming soon and going back up. FAANG is not dead. Your finances will be if you don't cover your shorts.
"Netflix is down because their programming is bad. Left-leaning ideology has dominated their plots, casting, etc. and the content isn't what America wants to spend their time viewing."
"Bought calls. Feels like it is trying to bottom and when it reverses it will be swift. But, I've been wrong before."
"their earnings missed the expectations, yet it increased 165% as compared to last year's. That's pretty good growth"
Can't believe this is on sale again. Buying more. I think this will be a $750 stock next year.

If the were to put a For Sale sign on their storefront window, they would be lucky to get an offer in the $50B range. Complete and total disconnect between Wall Street and reality. These FANG stocks have become nothing more than a high school popularity contest. A real shame what's happening. Stock bubble of 1999 revisited. Many small investors are going to get seriously burned. And the big boys (and girls) are getting richer, at the expense of the small investor. Really sad how history repeats..."

"It did fairly well, but the analysts think it is worth 3X of what its real value is. Should be about $8 net income per year * 25 = $200, It might only get to $12 per year when it maxes out and 12 * 12 is the non-growth P/E = $144. Definitely, not worth $670 or $570 or $470 0r $370 and never was and never will be"

The markets were rough / oversold and took down the stock among other tech / financial stocks. I think $NFLX will have a better quarter than last. Hoping the markets are on the mend.
"tell andrew not to spend that money he made on shorting NVDA, NFLX and whatever else he failed to guess... at one place"
cash burn is unsustainable. debt is in billions. many alternatives so the stock does not have any pricing power to raise fees. chart looks awful. Goldman & Morgan already warned their clients that sxxt will hit the fan last week. be careful next Wednesday.....

Premarket will bounce between 320&340. 9:30 will open at 325 +|- 10. First 20 min will bounce between 315&335 then jump to 345 +|- 5 then do a nice 45 degree climb the rest of the day to close at 360 +|- 5. This is my trading plan: buy 350 call options cheap when it’s around 320-325 and by market close they will have tripled. I will profit 15000-30000. I guarantee this action tomorrow. Any of you losers can follow my lead and make some serious benjamins! If you lose I will personally cover your losses. All I ask is you forward to me a mere 10% of your profits after 4:00Deal???

"Daily trading volume more than double the average day. With stock up since 11:30, expecting good earnings news."
Netflix would not increase sub rates if it was expecting a poor quarterly. Increases in subscriptions would have to outway the losses due to fleeing subscribers bent on the $2 increase. Expect a positive report.

Let’s be honest with ourselves here. This is a $20 stock trading at $500. Today proves this.
"NFLX notes offering got Ba3 rating, anyone knows what does it mean?"
There are no salary caps in the TV and film business. Sports leagues have salary caps to enhance competition. Netflix with 20 billion in streaming revenue (181 billion over the next 5 years at current growth rate) is buying the streaming championship.
I prefer ROKU over this.
Just curious and would like to see how netflix stock holders feel cause while I may have netflix in my mutual funds I don't in my personal stocks.I have the premium plan as long as I can remember cause my kid was in school at the time and have kept it since cause he still uses it and in our household it's infrequent so I keep the plan.Am I the person Netflix is looking at because I always felt I paid the extra and if my kid had to pay he wouldn't(he's cheap) and I would have no reason to keep it.Just some thoughts.
HBO Max is already better than Netflix quality content wise and will be a bigger thorn in Netflix’s side than people want to give credit for
Stiflel announced price target 390. Analyst said - Comcast is a very well-run company but face is ongoing challenges in a rapidly changing video landscape. Netflix on the other hand is also a well-run company but without the burden of a legacy business to protect. ￼
Who needs it?
Netflix is dropping lotta great new movies! Bound to bounce!
Just incredible...not expected at all by the market. Amazing figures....I was expecting something good but not that good!

The PE is up around 134 or so, it got pumped too high, 3 times too high or more even. It depends on their quarterly results. Seems to be support at $295 or $280 as well. Just an observation."

"15 Year old options trader with a 25k Netflix call,making more than my teachers"
Incredible bad timing. Netflix might be presenting their best earnings ever and stock can't take benefit of it on such a red day.Such a waste. Earnings are 5 days to late.
EASY $360 OPEN TOM MORNING
They had some interesting insights about NFLX on (http://Rightpicker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"Very informative piece on CNBC about Netflux and all the competition coming in. They were stating Netflix was always overvalued, however, they had no competition so that helped. Now with all the competition, the valyationncan no longer be justified, their monthly price will probably need to decrease, content costs will now increase and this valuation just isnt sustainable."
Jerome Powell to the rescue?
this has nothing to do with NFLX

Netflix raises prices in Canada. They'll raise prices high enough to keep revenue growth close to 40% but low enough to stifle competition.
Woohoo stock buy backs coming!!! $575 tonight

"How can Netflix stay up at least 180 points too high? Read the details, Hbo all series are quality, this is a game changer, they are trend setters!In year one, there will be 31 original series on HBO Max, growing to 50 series in 2021 (in addition to originals for legacy HBO), according to Kevin Reilly, chief content officer, HBO Max and president, TBS, TNT, and truTV. Underscoring HBO Max’s focus on “content that matters to viewers,” Reilly said the top 100 titles on streaming services drive half the total usage. Translation: HBO Max is focused on quality, not raw tonnage of content.As previously announced, HBO Max is getting its hands on the entire runs of “Friends,”“The Big Bang Theory,” “The West Wing” and “Pretty Little Liars,” among others; the entire Studio Ghibli film catalog; the full library of “Sesame Street” as well as the next five seasons; and CW dramas produced by Warner Bros. starting with the fall 2019 season (30 days prior to the TV premiere of the next seasons of the shows).HBO Max will have 1,800 movies at launch. In the first year, the film selection will include all the films in “The Matrix,” “The Hobbit” and “The Lord of the Rings” franchises as well as all titles in the last 10 years from DC Entertainment, including every Superman and Batman movie ever made. Recently released hit “Joker” starring Joaquin Phoenix will be available at launch.After the initial U.S. launch, AT&T will take HBO Max international — in 2021, it plans to debut localized versions of HBO Max in Latin America and Europe, according to Stankey.AT&T told investors Monday that it expects to spend $1.5 billion to $2 billion on HBO Max next year and invest a billion in each of the following two years, before hitting profitability in 2025.In 2021, WarnerMedia expects HBO Max to generate $1 billion in incremental revenue from the U.S. — over and above HBO — stepping up by a billion each year through 2025 to $5 billion. Those forecasts include ad revenue, expected to come in starting in 2021.It’s unclear how the so-called streaming wars will shake out, but Netflix investors in particular have been unnerved at the prospect of competition with content powerhouses like WarnerMedia, Disney and NBCUniversal. Some analysts believe it’s not a zero-sum game, with room for several big streamers to gain traction — likely at the expense of pay television."
"the GDP is around $31 trillion. That's money changing hands. Wmt used to have an income of 5% of their revenue, maybe it is less now. Point is, the most the country income is is likely $3 trillion.The interest on the national debt is $600 billion and likely to climb, even without the debt moving north. That's 20% of the national total income.That's a serious issue and the entire country is in denial.So, QE4 or QE5, whatever you might imagine is likely to be muted out of necessity. Costs need to be cut, which will likely put serious downside on the economy, like it or not. A recession is upon us."
"Have any NFLX longs looked at HBO max? It is the far superior quality HBO originals, plus higher quantity content library with shows like Friends(this was nflx #1 watched show). If longs think this doesn't put a huge dent into nflx subs, well you will be greatly mistaken. Nflx has nothing to differentiate and keep subs now. This combined with an already shaky balance sheet. Bye bye nflx. Step 1: shares fall below 100. Step 2: A real company buys them out between 100-150. Just wait and see. this will play out in next 1-2yrs."
"I've had a continuous Netflix subscription since the disc days, but recently canceled it. Why, you might ask. It's the politically correct messages that have usurped the storytelling. Although I might agree with the messages, it's not entertaining to have them shoved down my throat. I watch TV to get a break from politics, yet it seems to creep into movies and sports, so I guess I'll start reading books again."
It’s pretty much back to the 200 day moving average. The 50 day isn’t far away at $355. That’s definitely doable and could put NFLX back onto many buyers’ radars.
About time to see some green after 4 long days of nothing but red. This really needs to finish over $362 today.
BREAKING: Netflix (NFLX) reported 1st Quarter March 2019 earnings of $0.76 per share. The consensus earnings estimate was $0.57 per share on revenue of $4.5 billion. The Earnings Whisper number was $0.60 per share. Easily beat
Volume way down today. Not a good sign for a bottom.

"""Netflix is building a long-term cash machine here. Value investors will come to appreciate it later but you can get started right now. """
381.89 is the best close this year. Also the best close since 400.48 on July 16 of last year23rd best close ever
"Even if Disney+ has some errors at the beginning, they are going steal at least some customers from Netflix. Apple will to in the future and every other 'new' streaming platform that will come out. Netflix will lose a chunk of his customers. It's only common sense the stock will go lower mid to long term."
So who has been terminated for this horrible earnings? I hope Netflix is not going to ignore this and act as if everything is fine.
hoping for $600 in couple weeks. Loaded 15 Sept monthly strike $500 calls yesterday under $20 each.
In streaming profit margins increase as you scale up. In a survey of 3100 people Morgan Stanley found that 39% chose Netflix for best original content followed by Amazon 12% and Disney+ 7%. With its scale advantage and still in the early stage of growth Netflix is in a position to increase its lead.

It’s a mature market not much growth left with such high PE .This baby will be cut in half by EOY. IMO
Did i say i bought 100 shares at 358 and predicted it would go up in the last few hours? :))))))))))
Far over valued even at this level. Competition in this space is getting fierce and will continue to grow. Netflix had a good run for a while and stood alone for quite sometime. Well that time has passed and now they'll need to fight for their customers like every other content provider does. That could mean cutting cost of subscription while the cost of content continues to rise. The level of cash burn will also continue to be a problem.
Netflix currently has 7 of the top 10 shows. 9 of the top 13. Really think about that. Content slate is only getting stronger into Q3 and Q4.https://www.imdb.com/chart/tvmeter?ref_=nv_tvv_mptv

"This stock will get hard kick if market corrects again. And, there is nothing major happening on NFLX at least until end of November."
"A little back of the napkin calculations: Current market cap = 221 Billion. With a discount rate of 4% that would imply average future earnings of ~8.84 Billion/year or ~5 times 2019 earnings. So, if NFLX doubled its subscribers AND doubled their subscription rate it still would not support the current valuation. Crazy, huh?"
NFLX reached a new All Time High at 215.22
220 after Friday. This stock is going down the toilet. Sold at 310 made me some money :).
"Big boys just love to play with retail and steal their money. So be cautious doing too many options. Only way to win against Big Boys, don't play the game. Hold and accumulate good companies."
"News of record number of subscriber adds after raising prices keeps on giving, and why not, nobody has ever done it."
"Apple is projected to launch a streaming TV service to challenge Netflix NFLX, also Amazon AMZN, Disney DIS, and AT&T."
Free Streaming Contents is the trend...forget about all those paid ones.
"Earnings announcement* for NFLX: Apr 20, 2021Netflix, Inc. is expected* to report earnings on 04/20/2021 after market close. The report will be for the fiscal Quarter ending Mar 2021. According to Zacks Investment Research, based on 12 analysts' forecasts, the consensus EPS forecast for the quarter is $2.98. The reported EPS for the same quarter last year was $1.5699999999999998.Over $600 after earnings. Easy money, last time it went to $593."

Whats going on with nflx. Should be 380$ already
MKM sees 390 million subscribers by 2025. I'v been following Netflix for many years and since 2013 every analyst with long term subscriber estimates has had to increase them.
I see a $5-$8 up day today....
Buying opportunity . CNBC talking heads in full out condemnation of NFLX. Bar set low for next quarter results.
Netflix still has room to increase subscription price 7 times to $20 and will not have significant impact with subscriber retention.
SWEET CHRISTMAS!!

Shorts lost big time, ""longs"" for a day ;), also lost so much. And its all going to the big money. If you pick a stock, rhink it over and stay with it for a while."
I wonder why the SEC allows the option makers to peg a stock at the exact price that essentially wipes out the most option holders possible. That would be like the Nevada Gaming Commission allowing the bookies and sport books to control the scores of the games that they take action on. Incredibly corrupt.
Andrew Left has that much influence over Netflix share price???
Netflix will break $400 by Friday!

CNBC guest now a bagholder of NFLX who bought the stock before earnings now explaining why she is now losing money. Maybe NFLX can do a comedy show on this.
I was worried that expectations were getting crazy. Glad I bailed last week.
Lots of investors will be buying this stock on today and also on monday. Strong signal of going rapid high.
"I remember the last time NFLX took a hit from earnings and next earning I decided to short the stock, what a big mistake that was and I had to cover my shorts, I was in the house of pain. I've been waiting buying my time waiting for the next time NFLX take at hit at earnings, because this earnings, this stock is going to fly high. the next two days I expect 15 points each day and earnings day 10/15/18 I expect 40 to 50 point depends how much people have to cover their shorts. Painful experience but I learn fast"
"Jim Cramer ""Mad Money"" said a little dip before earnings is good. I imagine a little bird coming in for a landing, and then taking off to the moon. We will see the moon in AH with everyone staying at home watching Netflix. Buy it while it's cheap if you want."

"If you want the best content, then you have to have Netflix along with HBO. Netflix knows that which is why they can raise rates and continue to gain in subscribers. Will new entrants like Disney prove to be competitive? Maybe someday in the future when they can provide comparable content. No one will drop Netflix for Disney. But, people might add Disney for the kids. That's the truth!"
Analyst just on CNBC said research shows consumers “stack” streaming not replace 1 for another..
"You truly are hurting if you think DISNEY is going to do anything. DIS, the company with NEGATIVE earnings. You realize last quarter earnings were the same as the ones from EIGHT years ago. AMZN, DIS, Apple, have had a decade to do something, they are going to do nothing. Netflix will be 400 first quarter next year easily....get on board or get left behind."

"there seems to be a lot of upward manipulation in the morning on few days within the last monthseems like selling, spike it up, sell it offprobably continuessomeone suggested we will see the price move up until earningsthe counter is the 431 million shares of float and the fact that 5 years ago it was trading at $40 per share, so there are a lot of shares with a huge profit margin potential if they get sold, before the price returns to $130 or lower, which seems likely given the PE is 117 vs the competition at 17 or so, and the high possibility that they lose revenue to the competition"

He is well known short seller Here is my contradian theory:- Clearly with At&t merger, Net naturality change, Netflix going to have tough time keeping up, On top of them, ISPs will demand share of revenue sooner or later to deliver to home.Big player want that and so they create big plan to push all retain investor into Stock and exit. Now They need time to slowly sell all those huge number of share they purchased and so they basically making sure report like this not become well known."

"BTIG Rich Greenfield repeated his Buy recommendation on Netflix (ticker: NFLX) shares and lifted his price target to $630 from “a very stale” $375.Greenfield notes that he picked up coverage of the company in October 2019, when there were growing fears about competition from Disney+, Apple TV+,AT&T ’s HBO Max, and Comcast ’s Peacock. “Netflix not only shrugged off competition, the Covid-19 pandemic has pulled forward industry change, breaking the theatrical business just as Netflix’s theatrical investments are starting to bear fruit,” he writes in a post on the Lightshed website.Greenfield offers a list of six reasons to own Netflix shares:Unprecedented industry scale: He thinks the company will reach over 300 million subscribers by 2023 and over 400 million in 2026. Greenfield thinks that will translate to over $70 billion in revenue by 2026, with Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) margins in the rante of 35% to 40%.Accelerating cord-cutting: Greenfield says that while the addition of new streaming services has not hurt Netflix, it has dinged the cable and satellite TV businesses. “Outside of sports, legacy media companies are essentially telling consumers that there is no reason to subscribe to multichannel television anymore,” he writes. “It’s over. Multichannel video subscriber declines rose from low-single digits in early 2019 to mid-single digits by late 2019 and will end 2020 in the high-single digits.”Covid has accelerated industry transformation: “With so little fresh content on TV and without sports for several months, consumer adoption of streaming hit warp speed. Once consumer behavior shifts, it is very hard to shift it back, especially when the “experience” of streaming TV is so far superior to linear live TV,” he writes.Studios unwilling to shift film economic models: Most major studios are unwilling to shift to a streaming-first model, he notes. And Greenfield finds that puzzling. He notes that Walt Disney (DIS) had a huge hit streaming Hamilton, but the pay-per-view model adopted for Mulan has been a “financial failure.” That miss, along with the weak reception for the theatrical release of the Christopher Nolan film Tenet, has major studios delaying major releases until summer 2021 or later, while shifting smaller budget films to streaming services. In contrast, he points out that Netflix has a hit in the newly released film Enola Holmes, and has 18 or more movies lined up for October release. Greenfield writes: “As consumers begin to appreciate the steady stream of high quality films on Netflix at no additional cost, it makes Hollywood’s [pay per view] ambitions even harder to achieve and it likely means that theatrical attendance will never rebound to prior levels whenever the pandemic is behind us. The longer Hollywood studios remain focused on the sequential release pattern for movies that starts with theatrical, the more it advantages Netflix.”Competition lacks global ambition: “When we look at the major streaming competition, we see limited interest in having global subscriber scale, let alone producing local content all around the world that can be utilized by all subscribers,” he writes. “Netflix’s global content scale increasingly feels like even larger strategic advantage than its domestic programming spending.”Feature animation at Disney scale: “Netflix has been investing aggressively in animation for the past couple of years, but the animated feature lead time means the output is just beginning ...The first Netflix animated feature film that feels Disney-like is Over the Moon, which will be released next month ...It remains far too early to judge Netflix’s animation strength, but in success it could meaningfully increase the value perception of a Netflix subscription and make it even harder for families to cancel their subscriptions.”"
smart money would buy before earnings...enjoy the rewards longs...it will Crack 600
So Netflix told the story of the market downturn before it even happened. Check out early January..it baselines and start to fall...and if NETFLIX is baselining and falling no matter how small to start...that is the canary in the coal mine for sure.
I have to admit l am very new at NFLX. I myself is a subscriber and l enjoy it. I have made 5 purchased in the last month of this stock and had made some $$ in the past. I would not pay attention until all the upgrades lately about this stock. Right now l have all together 250 shares of NFLX snd un fortunately l am in a hole. Next Tuesday will determine weather or l will walk away with profit or loss. But l am still very confident it will be a gain to me. Good luck to all who participate in this stock. Have a great weekend.
The only hypothetical you should be wrestling with right now is “is NFLX” worth 300+ a share?”
Very disappointed today with this run tomorrow this can open big over $400 then run to $415 go nflx

"Breaking: JPMorgan boosts Netflix target to $625, says buy the selloffJPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth raised the firm's price target on Netflix to $625 from $535 and reiterates an Overweight rating on the shares. The analyst recommends buying the shares on today's post-earnings selloff. The stock in premarket trading is down 7% to $489. While the company's Q3 guidance for 2.5M net additions was below expectations, it would still represent Netflix's biggest combined Q2 and Q3 ever, Anmuth tells investors in a research note. And after global net adds dipped in June with the removal of inactives, Netflix returned to growth in July, adds the analyst. Anmuth believes the Q3 content slates ""appears solid"" with The Old Guard, The Umbrella Academy S2, The Kissing Booth 2 and Project Power."

January 1st 2019 Netflix stock per share $750.
This is becoming the bubble to end all bubbles. It's like this is valued based on the best case scenario 10+ years from now. I wouldn't be shocked to see a 20%+ drop in a day on any significant bad news. As long as the news stays good I expect it will just keep going up forever based on momentum though. This is the kind of stock that could either be <$150 or >$500 a year from now. Way too scary to short or to buy and hold IMO.
I LOVE NETFLIX $350 soon
lower highs and lower lows on big volume..very bearish. no real bounce anytime soon. It will continue to trade lower and lower until the next earnings report.

Look for a stock offering in the near future to retire some of the older bonds; those euro bonds probably won't be retired, they are probably held by the ECB. They will say it's for ""content"" ""general purposes,"" etc., the main purpose is to protect the bond holders.With the recent drop in NFLX, there may be a push to move forward with this."
OMG OMG..maybe tomorrow NFLX will open at $130 because someone (1 guy) decided to short the stock. OMG he is a god.
"Historically, NFLX doesn't miss in consecutive quarters and they've been quiet leading up to this earnings report, not trying to hold the stock up. Big beat and back to the $400 Level post-earnings and upgrades. Toasted shorties."
There is a lot of money to make here. Possible $340 by Tuesday next week.
"If you haven't figured out yet that CNBC is on Wall-Street payroll, then good-luck"
Will Netflix recover pass 380 this week or to at least 400
370 plus starts tomorrow
Realistically what the high of the day?
"Nflx always runs pre earnings. Held that $500 nicely, here we go boys get ready. $550+ coming soon!!"
"Longs are calm, we know better than to sell"
Netflix currently has 8 of the top 12 most popular shows this week on IMDB (including #1 and #2):https://www.imdb.com/chart/tvmeter/?ref_=nv_tvv_mptv
"This will go over $400 , now a days DISH is not doing good due to that everyone is streaming"
I have options $350 strike January 2020 --- Should I sell or hold off until it strikes? I think $350 and over coming soon :) I'll just keep it for a little while longer. YAAAA $NFLX
Anyone buying NFLX or TSLA tomorrow?
The time to make a move is now because the markets are headed for a crash. Do you know what stocks you should be in when the bottom falls out? If not check out this free newsletter that sends one stock a week. Just go to (http://Multistockalerts.com) to join for free!
"Bought 250 shares in the morning open, gaining quite a bit already, hoping to see $400 back this week."
I hope everyone here understands the amount of growth Netflix will have to achieve to live up to this valuation.
"Can the option manipulators hold $uvxy under 10 going to Wed?Will look to add more if ONLY above 10, BIG bubble $nflx is going to report after the bell today"
Won't go green today..... Just hope can stay around 407-409
How far do we think this is dropping?
$503.67 is critical today.Yesterday's decline will be undone.
"Buy the way up $2.5 in AH, NO WAY THIS STOCK IS GOING DOWN TOMORROW"
Netflix should be $52 a share compared to Disney and Disney owns all its content including sports along with HULU. Netflix mkt cap is almost equal to Disney with NFLX at $158 B vs DIS at $170 B. P/E of NFLX is 134 vs DIS at 15. Anyone can stream content but NFLX hardly owns any content as the big 4 increase their streaming and pressuring NFLX by withdrawing their content.
how long have people been saying this is over valued? since before the split which has been about 5 years now
Bear market done straight to new highs
This what happen with NFLX durimg every earning. Seat tight it will be up after hours and tomorrow. Dont sell.
"$300 million to service current debt$500 million to service debt starting 2019and more to come each year based on future negative cash flow.Starting 2020 will need to refinance $500 million of bonds rated B+ (2020-2026 so far)All while competing with Amazon, Hulu and Disney"
"Since the beginning of the year, NFLX 2019 EPS estimates have been tumbling from 4.06 to 3.42 while cash burn estimates has shot up to $3 billion/year. Large media companies with tons of content and much better capitalized have announced entering the streaming business and pulling their content from NFLX. Netflix's business model seems as shaky as it ever was, and loaded with debt with spiraling costs and interest rates makes it financial situation highly risky. Yet despite all this, the stock is up 42% YTD, trading at 120 P/E and $160 billion market cap! This is very much a disaster waiting to happen, just like the dotcom crash of the early 2000's."
This thing is ripping it in aftermarkets. Congrats to the longs.
Seeing how Disney has run since it announced streaming focus what do you guys think about att for a trade as it switches over to streaming with times Warner. I know att is kind of a dinosaur but I could see it moving up maybe 15-25% on hype related to this news.
"HAVE 100 SHARES, WILL LOAD MORE TOMORROW"
NFLX is best of FANGS growth is huge BUY.
"Raymond James forecast 31 million subscriber adds for 2019. That looks too low, should come in around 36 million IMO. Hulu CEO says they can catch Netflix with their promotion induced 8 million/yr subscriber adds? I like Hastings, he stays away from the limelight focused on changing the TV industry."
"Probably overpriced, but so is 90% of Nasdaq."
Article on credit suisse rating for netflix.$470 price target and outperform rating.people always comment on their growing dept. But what they don't realize is the dept per subscriber has remained fairly flat. And that subscribers have been growing for years. In 2012 there were less than 40 million subs and now they have over 140 million subs and still growing.This stock will see mid 400's in just a few months. Check the Barrons article below.https://www.barrons.com/articles/the-euro-is-due-for-a-rebound-1538146881
"Breakout, on 3 times avg. volume. As they say ""The longer the base, the higher in space"". Neflix has been consolidating for 18 months."
same pattern as yesterday....load up early.....should see 400 today
Today Netflix had the lowest volume of the past 10 trading sessions. what does that mean?
it cant be green all the time
"One thing I learned. Never listen to the bad comments here. If the stocks are at low price, buy them and you will be rewarded. Thanks Netflix. 600$ Soon. It was a great news today."
"Netflix saw a significant decrease in short interest in the month of December. As of December 31st, there was short interest totalling 13,853,134 shares, a decrease of 16.5% from the December 14th total of 16,593,567 shares. Approximately 3.3% of the shares of the company are sold short. Based on an average daily volume of 13,284,425 shares, the short-interest ratio is presently 1.0 days.— markebeat"
I can't imagine anyone buying this stock at this price.

"Netflix now expects 2020 free cash flow of negative $1B or better, compared with prior guidance of negative $2.5B."
Not worth more than $25 pps
Climbing up fast
I think its safe to say that this has been totally oversold - market got ahead of itself on the miracle vaccine news!!
Shorts haha
Monday we should see 10% gains AT least wich means 350$ by EOD. Then if markets are good we should see 375$ by friday
There went the best Netflix Series!https://deadline.com/2018/11/daredevil-canceled-netflix-3-seasons-1202511521/
I only have 10 shares at 332 I'm not rich or well off but holding
I think $380 or $400 is fair value. I will get there in the next few weeks.
$204 or $235 AH tomorrow. Will be a 7% move.
4 out of 5 shares owned by institutions. They won't be selling. Demand for shares today will far exceed supply. Add to that it has been stuck in channel for 6 months and seems like easy buy. 600 by end of week seems realistic.
"When would this recover? 1-2 years? I am long since it’s peak around 390 and wonder if it’s time to limit loses and move on or let it be. If good earnings and subscription growth did not move this stock up, what will?"
This stock is a joke. Everyone knows that everyone uses someone else password. That is not a paying subscriber. I know i wouldnt pay for nflx.
"NFLX reminds me of Blackberry before the onslaught of competition, but unlike Blackberry which had the best technology and was very profitable, NFLX has no proprietary technology, very little content, and over a $3 B loss going into a state of hyper competition."
And my feeling was right. Been waiting for this all quarter. NFLX a huge thanks.
strong guidance
"Maybe Netflix can prove us all wrong with their numbers but I think most people know that increased competition leads to lower margins/slowing revenue growth. That’s just the nature of consumers having more than one option. At this point, I think it’s a matter of how much the competition hurts Netflix rather than a matter of IF"
1 yr Price Target: $79.00
NFLX $600 by next week!!!!
"What’s stated on this board has no influence, just fun, to let off steam, release the pressure valve. It’can be informative at times and give you the psychological pulse of the retail investor, but like I read 60% of NFLX shares are held by institutions."
Just the normal ebb and flow of subscriber count. Expect higher rates in the future to shave down debt.
an upgrade came in folks this might be a good day for us who knows
"I'm not sure that many people realize that VIAC has nearly identical annual revenues, operating and leveraged free cash flow as $NFLX HOWEVER VIAC trades at an Enterprise Value of only $46 Billion compared to NFLX's $247 Billion! Given that VIAC pays a dividend and it's growth should accelerate going forward with Paramount Plus, that's just insane!"

The survey of 3,000 U.S. consumers showed that Netflix’s new original content drove subscription memberships recently.

Remember all the downgrades before earnings?
"Buy NFLX!!! The market has no confidence in the merger of AT & T and Discovery, customers have no confidence in the platform either. The only valuable thing that there is HBO Max.All these ""old"" media companies who were critical of Netflix and made fun of Netflix are now trying to imitate."
"Buyback program starting very quickly, positive cash flow, beat EPS, etc. That is going very difficult for the shorts following the usual weak hands selling happening..."
Going bullish due to international expansion which Netflix virtually has no meaningful competition

"Yesterday, after the new debt news and the VZ roll out info, the stock opened at 271.18. We have traded nearly 20 million shares since yesterdays open-and it is unchanged. The stock is being distributed and the downtrend is still in place."

"Today was the greatest comeback ever in the history of NFLX.First time it ever ends green on a day when the LOW reaches 12.50 in the RED.Can this be the beginning of the comeback to just a normal number, like let's say $350?"
People with short positions are short because this company is irrationally valued. Price movements like being up 2% after announcing 2b more in debt months after another issuance only reinforce the theory of an irrational value.
The 1Q results doesn’t even account for the month of April which was the beginning of stay home. Surprised no one meant it
"$INTC $NFLX Nobody really wants to sell, shorts getting forced to cover. Nowhere to go but up  $WIMI"
I have all major streaming platforms. My queue on NFLX is over 30shows of different genres. All the other platforms have 0-4shows on my watchlist. NFLX has the content
"Witcher coming December, epic. Already 20+ million views on YouTube for the trailer, nearly at Stranger Things popularity!"
"I saw 3 episodes of ""WITCHER"".. It gets better with each episode."
You're lucky this market has momentum otherwise this would be down at least 40.00 bucks NFLX misses revenue and poor guidance with growing competition is serious

When you panic you make the wrong decisions and lose money.
"Question about the impact of production shutdowns on Netflix's release schedule.Sarandos: ""We work really far out relative to the industry. Our 2020 slate of originals is largely shot and are in post-production remotely. We're also deep into our 2021 slate. We don't anticipate moving the schedule around much, certainly not in 2020."""
Netflix will always be the best
NFLX price target raised by Barkley to $450 and now overweight rating
$TSLA I hope I'm wrong but this is not looking good for tomorrow.. $NFLX really didnt pass the vibe check.

Low rate forever and ever! NFLX loves low rates. Spend away!
Cracking down on password sharing is the absolute dumbest thing Netflix could do. It will result in fewer paying subscribers as half the subscribers are only paying for the service because their kids are using it. They could improve their cash flow by producing less garbage shows and fewer but higher quality shows.
Tsla and Netflix. So much innovation and pricing power. Ride
Market ready to take a dive tomorrow?
$440 by September 15
"Just an fyi, Pre-Market UP $12 to $435 (volume 164K shares traded)........in my humble opinion we'll be at $450 either today or tomorrow ""before"" the earnings announcement!"
"The reason these media mergers keep coming is they need more scale to compete with Netflix. When it’s all over there will only be 2 maybe 3 global media companies around, Netflix, Amazon and maybe Disney."
A near 100$ drop p/s since 3rd week of January. Tell me why NFLX is worth holding or buying...
the analyst used his imagination to raise NFLX to $650.
2:30pm is what look for.
Let's go back to 423
80% of put contracts have been filled at 297. We see reversal shortly after that.-Rainbow financial services.

Netflix needs to move into the 2020 decade. Thier still using 2019 devices.
"FANG is dead; long live MAGA (no - not that MAGA. Microsoft, Apple, Google and Adobe)."
Would be very nice if Netflix continues this momentum today. If it continues to outpace the market it will hit green quicker
Everyone stops in to kick a stock when it takes a hit. Netflix will likely gain half of this loss back tomorrow. Possibly be back to $400 by Friday.
"Once millenials start to learn how to use a COMPUTER, not an iphone, they will learn that ALL of this content can be downloaded for FREE Lol"

"Carpe Diem. Strike while the iron is hot. My two cents to management of NFLX to buy ViacomCBS while its stock currency can be used to buy one of the most undervalued companies out there. The brands and value proposition that it brings to NFLX will strengthen the company against the likes of DIS, the tech giants etc. Have a conversation with Ms Redstone and make her an offer she can't refuse before someone else does. Thoughts. God Bless and stay well."
The premium plans price is increasing to £13.99 starting from the 25th February 2021 !! This is going to make netlfix stocks go even higher

It is setting up for a perfect morning panic dip buy. If it sells of at the open look for the bounce for a nice flip
There is no other branded streaming service like Netflix. They are so ahead than others in this field.
Netflix is up 500% in last few years . People dumped it thinking it’s not a reopening play. Well for now it isn’t but everyone we know has Netflix and will get Netflix .
one day you’ll walk to the movie theatre owned by Netflix and running blockbuster movies produced by Netflix just like lionsgate or Warner bros or dream works. Netflix is going to be just Netflix of today. Companies evolve. Is Jeff bezos still JUST selling books online???? No he’s selling the world online!! People’s visions are so week and that’s why all they know what to do is making money from day trading while others are busy planning the future.
"When Netflix runs advertisements, that will be the day i finally cancel my subscription.Netflix will have no choice but to run ads, industry execs say - https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/29/netflix-will-have-no-choice-but-to-run-ads-industry-execs-say.html"

A good chance Netflix will add 30 million subscribers this year.
"Roku's shares fell after the report, but already increased by + 20%. Netflix you are more likely dead than alive .. your investors did not deserve any for a year spent with you?"
Netflix will be soaring high tomorrow after close!Imagine how many new subscribers they added just to watch “Bird Box”.
"Not short or long, just watching volatility and wondering what makes NFLX so loved? Modest growth and minimal profits...lots of companies do this. Just saying...."
"The competition in Netflix is over blown there is room for more players, it is not a zero sum game. Consumer will have multiple streaming accounts but Netflix will be the primary account for them. The difference with Netflix is operating margins, as they add their next 100 subscriber the movies they produce becomes cheaper and profits will soar. Disney and Netflix are the only 2 streaming with a studio where movies are actually made....what does that tell you about the competition? Disney is 5 more years to profitability when it come to its streaming business. So Netflix is king!"
"Once again Garolou deflects instead of talking about an issue. The most recent bonds (actually bank loans) from NFLX are graded out as junk status. NFLX has to, again not by choice, pay a higher interest rate on those bonds because the credit market identified them as being higher risk. To say debt is a non issue is the worst kind of sunshine pumping. Ask any institutional manager the oppty and risks of owning NFLX stock and each and every one will list debt as a risk. Look, I am not trying to scare anyone off of NFLX. Just want to expose the shill garolou for what he is. If you don't know the definition of a shill, look it up because its him. Listening to shills on a message board can be very dangerous. Do your own DD. Don't ignore the risks or only listen to those you agree with. Its called confirmation bias."
I counted 10 analyst price boosters going into earnings since 7/1-- Mogan Stanley Wedbush Barclays Benchmark BMO Capital Goldman Sachs Stifel Noicolous Rosenblatt Credit Suisse Canacord. The booster club will be out again tomorrow watch.

Disney has been a drag on the Dow Jones performance. They will be replaced by Netflix in the next go round.
"Between ""Cuties"" and the price increase, I finally got around to canceling, just now. Feels good."
Scale provides a strong moat in the film industry. It’s what kept Disney and Warner on top for almost 100 years. By filming all over the globe Netflix is taking scale up 10 fold.
475 probably by Friday
Look at how many fake bulls here! LOL We love to see you are buying! Then we have bigger room to short it all the way down below 470! Don’t actually secretly sell! LOL
Netflix is the big dogs in streaming. Everyone else is late to the game. They going have to spend a lot more money then Netflix to catch up. Netflix already has the 5 years ahead and advantage of streaming. Netflix for life
an upgrade for Goldman who has been down trending for the last 16 months isnt a great thing...Just saying
"Ok they got it now. On the lightest volume in 2 weeks they just took out yesterdays high. My guess is the 275 puts are now in sight. Disney, amazon, and Verizon all getting in the space-oh yeah-Apple. Everyone of these companies could buy nflx with just their cash on hand but somehow nflx is still trading at 90 times earnings and 6 times sales?"
"The story behind NFLX was the growth. Now, with such big competition from all around, awards taken by competitors. I won't be surprised to see below 200 in the near term."
They need to report 7.2M subscriber adds for Q2 and guide for 6.5M adds in Q3 for the rally to continue.
sitting on house money now sold half when was up 136% a while back....... and it wont stop....
Still no sacrificial lamb termination? We need accountability to stop this free fall.
Netflix is woke
HBO MAX added only 2.7 million sub..Netflix not alone seeing slowing sub growth in first half of year..Disney plus conveniently won’t release numbers until after May
***** UP 37 % in a Week...SEGI...SEGI TV...Sycamore Entertainment based in Canada and the U.S. FREE TV and MOVIES.
Disney direct-to-consumer + international segment revenue grew 3% in Q1 over Q4. That compares to 6% growth for Netflix over the same period.
"The best explanation of what the problem with NFLX is articulated in the article below. The price action is beginning to show that the market is finally realizing that NFLX is overvalued. One could argue that the action is simply in line with the market move, but if one reviews the price action closely, you can see the initial stages of facing reality has begun.The likelihood that NFLX will breach its high of ~286 is very small for a very long time. Instead, watch it bounce around a bit with a bias towards a steady decline that will bring it to the 186 area. Could go down much further than that.NFLX is a great company that, quoting the article, is ""incomprehensibly overvalued"".https://investorplace.com/2018/02/nflx-stock-uncertain-future/#.Wn8QJainHIU"

"Some time back, I bought Amazon, just before earnings report, at $400.00 a share. After they reported, it went down significantly, so out of fear, I sold. I think now, what it would be if I had just held on. Now over $1800.00. Hardest thing to do when investing in the stock market is to have patience. Don't look back some day and wish you had just held on to NFLX."

"People don't look into but it increasingly costly for Netflix to get subscriber. This include Domestic being more difficult but Overseas this is slowly becoming problem as well.They spending whole lot to get growth but cost to get new Subscriber is not sustainable.Domestic it already reaching near $100 and overseas it's near $50.Domestic is worst it double over last couple year. That mean it's increasingly difficult for new customer which expected given most already have it. Overeas given 150 country launch, it's hard to determine but I think last Quater it's clear, cost is raising very quickly.Now why they keep spending more on advertisement in domestic.simple:- They have to replace all customer who they losing. Otherwise it will look they start losing subscriber instead gaining and stock will tank. If stock tank, it will much harder to finance spending & also retain talent. They likely offering stock as part of their content deal as well.In otherword, This is how you can hide serious problem with either Churn Rate or harder to get new customer.It's also possible that many are keep cancelling and resigning. Again that's actually best hope. Otherwise some point it will hard to replace leaving customer and stock will tank very badly."

I wish Yahoo had a way to sum up all of our posts at the end of the year. Some of these guys who shorted NFLX and then freaked out on these boards would be mortified to reread their posts at the end of the year. Or 5 years later. What are you thinking?
Netflix is like a cult right now with the original content they are producing. They got me hook line and sinker as I’m addicted to some of their shows. I’d pay $30/month. Millions feel the same way can guarantee it. $2 raise?? Please.
Disney report shows subscribers to streaming services are on the rise. Disney and Netflix offer different content. They both benefit from ramping up subscriptions.

"I repeat $300 @ MAX. I am very bearish on this. They have been raising rates to adjust, but lot of competitors coming. AMZN is big one."
hello 200 hello 210
Talk about on overreaction to a known issue for something that hasn’t even happened. Good grief. I’m buying the dip for sure.
The Queen’s Gambit is an unexpected big hit. It should help Netflix beat subscriber expectations and show pricing power.
It's interesting that every article about the Sony deal mentions Spiderman movies as the main draw. Think about the complexities there. Spiderman is a character owned by Marvel which is owned by Disney which Sony releases in movie form and which Netflix will show on their service after theatrical release. A tangled web indeed!
"Disney starting streaming service at $5 per month, lot lower than prime and netflix and is pulling all content from netflix"
"Netflix’s Oscar Stock Is On the Rise : ""The Irishman"", ""The Laundromat,"" ‘Marriage Story’, ""The King', ""The Two Popes""https://www.indiewire.com/2019/09/netflix-oscars-marriage-story-the-netflix-two-popes-marriage-story-laundromat-the-king-1202170928/"
International growth will take NFLX much higher. Bet on it. $330.00 minimum Tuesday am.
Humm why up 12 after hour?
"Even if I get all the streaming service from DIS, AMZN, AAPL, GOOG and NFLX. It will still cost less than my current cable bill."
"9 months ago, shares were worth $ 490, now they are worth the same. Many good news came out in 9 months. Price increases in England, Canada, USA, Ireland, Japan. The company has collected many awards at the Emmy, Golden Globe, Oscars ... But the shares did not become more expensive, but only lose their value .. every day it loses its meaning .."
Congrats to all that bought the massive dip! Netflix isn’t going anywhrre
"Now that Netflix has the option of producing its own content licensing to Netflix isn’t as profitable as it was before, but it’s a lot better than losing money in streaming."
"The demand for TV, online games, e-commerce, social networks, health TV, and online education increased significantly during the quarantine. Only in the first quarter, $Netflix increased 16m new users in the US -- about double the number in the previous quarter. Italians also increased their time spent on Facebook apps by 70 percent. After 2020, there will be significant growth in the upstream video data stream from the Internet of Things. AR holographic services(provider WIMI) are expected to generate massive demand between 2020 and 2025."
What an amazing range today. casino royal..
can someone please tell me where the future growth will be coming from. is this an international play? Why would anyone own Netflix over other high growth tech companies? Netflix seems to have much more competition than others and they don't make money.
Will be down big in AH trading. MM trying to slow the drop to limit amount of puts in the money expiring today.

Can someone give me good reasons as to why this will rise on earnings?
Ask yourself this question. Do you like money? If so vote trump and this market will fly for 4 more years. If you hate money and don’t care vote Biden and get what you deserve!
"The true future of Netflix may be it being purchased by another streaming platform. It’s taken yeats for the original brain washing movie tudios to get their streaming chops up, now that HBO Disney and all of the heavy hitters are taking back their “rightful” monopolistic reign, Netflix could easily just have its catalogue sold, and your ticker be switched to a new IPO of whatever platform buys it."
closing green......ON SALE! Back up the truck.
"For how long will the US Government continue to PUMP the US Stock Prices artificially? Everyone knows that the US Market is in the MEGA BUBBLE; it is even more overvalued than Tulip Mania Bubble! The US Stocks are INSANELY OVERVALUED and OVERBOUGHT! The Valuations are impossible to justify!For how long can the US Government run this fraudulent Stock BUBBLE, while Corporate revenues are tanking, Corporate and National Debt is Astronomical, the Valuations are beyond insanity, Political polarization is at max, there are ongoing and upcoming wars, the real resources are limited, Economy is Collapsing, Competition is intense, the Stock Dilutions are at record highs, everything is getting worse, China, Russia, and many other countries are set to ditch the US Dollar as an international reserve currency. Now there are 100,000s of companies worldwide competing for $1 revenue! The US Companies that barely generate revenue of $1-2 million are trading at $50-60 Billion Market values, while in Asia, the same companies with better fundamentals, 100 times more revenues, are trading at 99% less market value! The US Company valuations DO NOT MAKE Sense at all! Why would one invest in US Stock Tulip Mania while he/she can buy the 1000 times better company share for a 99% cheaper price? The US Stock Market is a MAJOR PONZI SCHEME designed to patch fraudulent pension systems in the US temporarily! There is NO PROPER Revenue Collection by the IRS since 2016.

Ppl are so underestimate how tough this streaming game is and how expensive is it to retain customers and how many months of subs it takes to offset those cost. It’s easy to get ppl interested in a stream and go ‘WOW I LOVE IT’ but did you guys ever think of the scenario where someone sign up for Disney for a year or 2 and unsub as the kids age? Yes Disney put a lot effort with the whole 4 quadrant content and it is there. But is it really enough to make consumers stick? Getting excited about a stream and paying 3 months of it is very different to how Netflix retain their base
"disneys signups (which they started several weeks ago, not 1 day ago), are highly inflated by:1) free weekly trials and 2) free 1 year trials from verizon. The real questions:What % are free trials (my guess is 50%+) ?and how many pay to keep the service after the trial is over ?regardless its not a zero sum game, its a very large market, where both can thrive."
"Earnings beat, stock buyback and 2:1 stock split coming, $650 tomorrow."
"When major media companies need to buy other major media companies to better compete with Netflix, then Netflix should have the highest market cap of them all."
So Apple can’t make a charger in two years but yet they are going to complete with NFLX from basically no content to being a powerhouse. This from a company that its biggest spend to date was buying Beats. I understand all the subscribers and all the money. I just don’t see them doing anything great in streaming.
getting closer to $199 and still a big bubble stock with huge debt.
We are looking at a decisively higher gain in subscribers during 3Q earnings announcement on 10/16! $450 here we come!!!
The netflix buyback was accepted on time. This will keep the stock from falling below $ 470-460.
"Netflix is manipulated as well, in my opinion. The PE is 91. What is the growth rate? Yes, people signed up due to the virus, and they have done well, but the competition is real as well and their PE""s are 1/4 to 1/2 what Netflix's PE is. Big money comes out with upgrades (bogus upgrades) and then turns on their BOTs. That's my opinion, as they sell, most likely, and funds and indexes and retail get left holding the bag. Oldest trick in the book. Illegal though.This is just my honest opinion."
50% in 10 days...This should continue and accelerate. Likely to acquire AAPL by end of quarter.
Nothing but a tech rout. Haven’t seen it this bad ever. Not even 2008 was this bad for tech.

"Netflix content is boring. Everytime I look for a movie on it, I can't find it.I cancelled it long time ago"
If we could get one green day in the Nas we would rocket! hopefully this is tomorrow
used netfilx for 3 months the unsubscribed lol not much to watch .... it will drain after pandemic finishing is bot worth 15$ a month for their very few 4k movies they got ....
"Time to load up before the earnings run.Netflix currently has 7 of the top 10 most popular series (including #1, #2, and #3). Complete domination in a rapidly growing industry. Its market cap is way too low.https://www.rottentomatoes.com/browse/tv-list-2"
Netflix has been categorized as a stay at home play when really it’s an opening up play. The big subscriber growth it had when Covid hit was only pulled forward and now they are left with little new original content due to studios shutdowns. Now with studios back up and running Netflix has the the most money to spend on new productions. Netflix expects subscriber growth will return to normal in the second half.
Market participants are simply in the mood to buy. The results don’t matter much never. It’s all about “future growth” which is just market mood and feelings.Look at Aapl doubling in price despite declining earnings and revs. The only thing that matters is whether traders think someone else will buy it for higher. For nflx that’s a big YES. He who panic buys first panic buys best!
May be buying at@t not a bad idea after all. 6% plus yield is tempting.
"Mad bashers on this board, sounds like a buying opportunity"

"$362.75 will be a key level to test, if we fall through that then I have $361.20 as support, if support fails then $358.01 is the next level to test, then $352.61, all bets are off if it falls below $344.40."
"DIS is the growth company with them entering the market, nflx not so much, scrounging around in the remote areas of the globe for international growth. How is it that revenue per subscription is only slightly lower when entering less affluent countries in South America, Asia, India, etc. The math doesn't work unless they are paying $9-10 per month."
313 yesterday 340 middle of today. Is this still one bullmarket!
Sooner or later they will announce the new cfo and nflx will zoom past 400
nasdaq up almost 50 pts and nflx falling. Not a good sign for today. That means when the nasdaq falls down we are just going down even more. May not be our day today people. Looks like were going red.
short squeeze could soon drive nflx stock up 50%

Netflix swept the awards
"Last earnings, it went form $510 to $593. It can easily go from $550 to $600 today. Let's go."
"For those that missed it:LOS GATOS, CA – June 14, 2018 -- Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX) today announced it will post its second-quarter 2018 financial results and business outlook on its investor relations website at http://ir.netflix.com on Monday, July 16, 2018, at approximately 1:05 p.m. Pacific Time. At that time, the company will issue a brief advisory release via newswire containing a link to the second-quarter 2018 financial results and letter to shareholders on its website."
"People are not going to stop their $16 a month Netflix subscription! It's their only form of entertainment during these dark times. Hence, everyone is talking about Tiger King. If anything, people are starting to realize that they don't need to follow grown men playing children's sports, i.e., professional sports. Netflix is actually going to get stronger during this pandemic."
"$NFLX $WIMI $GOOG $FB According to Stratistics MRC, the Global Hologram Market is accounted for $25.56 million in 2017 and is expected to reach $ 244.15 million by 2026 growing at a CAGR of 28.5% during the forecast period. The up-to-date comprehensive item learning, and industry development curve, end clients are some of the factors fuelling the market growth."
"Funny, We subscribe to Netflix but we hardly ever watch it anymore. Wonder if there are others like us out there??"
"""Scale increases 10:1 with the internet"". John Malone, media tycoon,PhD, in a Nov. 16, 2017 interview. He also said Netflix is on track for enormous profits and it's a way too late for old media to figure out a Netflix like service. July last year Disney said they will launch a streaming service in 2019. Why not in 2017? Then again, they launched one way back in 2007 with partners Fox and Comcast and called it Hulu and it's stuck in the mud."
Netflix subscription is getting high enough to consider ditching it. Did so with cable in 1995 and will do it with streaming too.They keep touting their original content which mostly sucks. I much prefer existing movies and a lot of non original content shows I watched have been removed. Magnum P.I. and Murder in Paradise to name two.That said the stock will probably still do well for a while.Lots of people are more interested in watching TV than am I.
buy buy buy... cover cover cover
It's done for now. I see 350 as good entry. Be safe

Looks like another all time high at opening. Go Netflix!
"You can no longer invest or trade Netflix, it's just gambling."
Yep we done.....recovery yeah in about 2-3 weeks
"I’ll be selling but good luck to y’all longs. Wall Street is never happy with Netflix after earnings even after a beat, they always have something to complain about that drops the stock price"
"As a product it’s lost its shine. Years later, its library of content is still limited."
Netflix stock up or down tomorrow?
"NFLX should use their ludicrous and obscene market cap and buy a real company like VIAC. live sports and news, a movie studio with 100x good content vs netflix, owner of multiple channels like CC, BET. Showtime. A TVnetwork in CBS. An unbelievable number of quality assets vs Netflix'sovervalued assets which are basically none. All for 30 - 50B."
VIAC is taking NFLX lunch money.
people hate to see success when they have no idea how to obtain it.
"""Upon launch, Disney+ will include 'at least five content channels' including Disney, Pixar, Star Wars, Marvel and National Geographic.""Maybe it's just me, but this seems very underwhelming to be considered direct competition to Netflix. Seems like it only will appeal to children and nerd culture. And there are so many alternatives for children (including Netflix). As a parent, I don't think I'd pay $10 a month for this."
Can anyone see AAPL using some of that spare 250bn to buy Netflix
buy in now or wait??

Streaming BUY
"This is a easy call.I am going short on this. It has to go down below 300.Everything is already factored in and hence there is going to be massive profit taking and shorting.1st quarter subscription is slow for NFLX.Take my advice, sell before it's too late."
"For the second quarter 2018, analysts estimate NFLX will generate revenues of $3.9B, an increase of 41.46% over the prior year second quarter results. Time to buy!"
buy buy buy
Goldman conviction list AKA - stock going down
It is really time for them to add other revenue streams
"See no point is selling Netflix to take my profits. I only need to hold 90 days to 4Q and we will be at or closing in on $450. Amazing company, utterly dominating steaming. I'm not saying their lead is insurmountable, but they are here to stay for quite some time. Enjoy the money friends."
Sold single 350 put. Basically that mean will go long if remain below 350.I am totally surprise Wallstreet favorite having no story telling. I but this going to start soon.If everyone seat home who going to benefit most. Entertainment services. May be market hate selling real story and only imagine story. We will find out where I end but this is huge U-turn I am taking on NFLX. Not because I believe they can continue grow for next 10 year but because wallstreet love stories and Netflix is best because it only have video streaming business which rival best out there. Again earlier I was short on Netflix because it can't continue grow like analyst putting out when upgrading. Not enough in rest of world can efford.But corona virus sure going to bring back USA subscriber growth and acceleration in International subscriber. this is huge when they release their result. Market story going to start and stock will trade 500 in no time.
"5 Top Stock Trades for Friday — A Look at Half of FANGSpeaking of consolidating, look at the excellent price action of Netflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX).Some investors may not like the recent action or complain that it is stalled. But keep in mind that Netflix stock is up more than 100% so far in 2018! It needs to consolidate some of these moves and this is very healthy price action.Shares are gearing up for another big move, that much is clear. The only thing we need to figure out is which direction. If the past is any indication, that direction will be higher.Watch for a move up to $405 to $410. Should we get it, it could spur a rally back to its previous highs near $420 and possibly even new all-time highs above that.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-top-stock-trades-friday-195312774.html"
Since when earnings matter?
Time to sell or wait..... Hard to hold...
Wow guess what? I just checked PG and it has a 87 trailing PE for single digit growth. LOL at people saying Netflix got a PE problem. Even a dinosaur company like PG can get a 87 PE
WIN. WIN. WIN.
"I told you to buy an hour after the market opened because by the then the fundies would have sold an the weak hands would have thrown in the towel. I bought only 300 shares but by the end of the day I am up $29 a share. If you panicked and sold learn a lesson from this. You got scared by the bad press, panicked and sold. You ended up doing exactly what the fundies wanted you to do so that they could buy your shares cheap."
"Global domination continues, After opening its doors in Paris last week, Netflix is setting up a production office in Rome.https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/netflix-opening-rome-office-1203478438/"
Netflix is spending $500 million on three movies with zero revenue or profits to be gained from these movies beyond the possibility of adding subs. Brilliant use of capital.
"All you longs, keep on holding and NFLX still has some room to run"
"Disney flopped, viacom somehow became a pump and dump scheme. Netflix is the only reasonble stock option"

"Netflix is quickly approaching 150 million subscribers. It added nearly 9 million paying subscribers during the final three months of 2018, beating its own expectations of 7.6 million new subscribers. Netflix (NFLX) now has 139 million subscribers globally."
Will it be below 300 Tuesday
"If everyone pulls their content from Netflix and you were left with only Netflix originals, they would only have 37% of the streaming time they have now. How can investors think that Netflix originals will keep this stock afloat? It makes absolutely no sense. Netflix needs borrowed content to survive, and the best borrowed content is leaving. Period."
Own NFLX and DIS...People are being SHORT SIGHTED! More than 1 service will make it! In addition ...Netflix streams PERIOD! Disney has theme parks...Makes Billion Dollar Movies...Sells Merchandise and Owns Hulu. TV Started with Network TV. CBS was joined by NBC ...ABC etc.....Guess what CBS didn't GO OUT OF BUSINESS when NBC arrived!
"With the explosive quarter earning, don't be surprised to see upgrades on the way."
I think they 5 for 1 split soon follow the pack Then GOOG and AMZN
Big group waiting to buy at $505.00
Here is my attempt to interpret CEO message saying next 100M from India. Is he trying to say Development phase countries like India? If so does that mean all developed market not much growth left and so Next 100M subscriber will mostly come from developing country. If so Netflix sure headed for temporary slowdown on subscriber growth for sure. There is no way developing countries can afford $10/year subscriptions and so no way those 100M can come in next 4-5 year. it will take way longer like 15 year.
Tomorrow back to $440.
Cramer said buy NFLX last night.

"earnings:$3.29 blns vs. cons. $3.28 bln...more importantly, net streaming adds @ 8.33 mln vs. est. 6.35 mln...a massive subscriber growth"
With a solid beat Netflix will add more subscribers than Disney+ this Q. They will continue increasing their lead with a barrage of new releases. FANG stocks will come back into favor because of valuation and Netflix stock will rally to 1000.
"Netflix had a good day!! Hope all of ours trust on this stock is held, if all goes fine this stock should be around 520 by aug end."
"Have been in Netflix for over 2 years. There most certainly is no reason to panic, no company can hit expectations 100% o0f the time. I noticed with the quarterly report a drop in revenue, I smell another Netflix price increase this year, 2019 at the latest, as the company tries to increase revenue. They might want to consider reducing spending."
Netflix stock received two upgrades to buy after earning report: Oppenheimer and Stifel Nicolaus. Check it out.

"revenue greew 32.4% from Dec 2016 to Dec 2017the forward PE is 75; half of that is 37.5I feel the forward PE (which may be fairy tale) is two times too high for a 32% revenue growth rateAnd that ignores some important points:interest rates are going uptariffs will put pressure in NFLX trying to grow in the worldthe balance sheet; see the net assetts running out of controlgrowth slowscompetition is real and more of itgrowth tends to normalizerevenue growth will sloworiginal content is great, but the long term debt has grown in a major waythe stock price (manipulated, it seems to me) helps them look good. But what if it were trading at a more fair value like $130 per share or maybe a quarter of where it is, under $80then the market cap would be around $32B and their debt would ratio would be substantially more as a percentage. I'm saying the debt doesn't look as bad as it really is, since the price has been pushed to the moon. Time for a major correction in NFLXMaybe AMZN will join it.OF the FANGs, I feel Apple and NVDA are not so high in terms of their PEs."
"ok, this time $600 for real"
"I can safely claim: if NFLX does not innovate revenues from other business, NFLX will not come back for at least 2-4 years!"
NFLX will be up at least $20 tomorrow. We'll close between 388-395 !!
"The biggest problem Netflix has right now, is that competition is entering the field that make most of the their revenue and profits from different sources. They can afford to lose money as they build up their content, and charge low monthly pricing to build up their subscriber base. This is the only business Netflix has , and it can no longer raise prices. In fact, I think they will need to lower pricing to keep growing their subscriber base, or even keep their them where they are right now. I don't think they will be able to survive as an independent company long term....If you have large profits in Netflix, I would start trimming if you haven't already....."
"WSJ survey30% of netflix users will cancel to try the new streaming companiesweekend paper, check page 1 (or B1) and B6"
What time are they reporting earnings?
Losing subscribers faster than you can watch a Netflix show.Currently still overpriced for a year subscription. Should lower fee to $10.95 a year.
"rain has left the station... Whoever bought, good luck"
NFLX had a great quarter
"nobody is playing ""chase the Netflix rally"" today?"
Earnings day bumps are ALWAYS sold. I see no upside to holding thru earnings. Never maintains.
"Netflix survives by borrowing money. It's able to borrow based upon its ""assets"" (the content it owns) -- but those ""assets"" are (mostly) lies; the company puts values on its content far in excess of what the content is actually worth (if it were to be sold).

Should open up +$10 tomorrow morning
I heard about NFLX the other day on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
Will Disney's $12.99 bundle put price pressure on the rest of the competition coming into the streaming market? How will this price pressure affect Netflix?
"Netflix sees a deceleration in new subscriber additions in the second quarter to 5 million. Wall Street had expected 6.09 million.Sales growth slowed for the fourth straight quarter.Operating profit margins fell 190 basis points from the prior year.The year-over-year growth trend in paid memberships also continues to be lower.At an outflow of $460 million in the quarter, Netflix burned cash at a faster rate than the year ago quarter ($287 million)."

guys is not just Netflix the whole market is down so relaxed no need to panic
"Are you guys concerned that Netflix may not be producing much new stuff for a while, or is this basically like a non issue ?"

"Wall Street awards growth but pivots on a dime in the absence of it.Five quarters NFLX subscriptions grew, NFLX doubled in price.Yesterday, growth was not there; NFLX fell 15%"
Last hour of trading......I expect buying to pickup as people will not want to miss the run up due to earnings! Per my projections from early last week when the price was $360 I was expecting NFLX to reach $450 before market close today (I guess I got very close given the $439 right now)! Am still looking for a major blowout EPS ($2.05) and a HUGE total for new additional subscriptions globally!! This would convert to a price above $500 on earnings announcement!!
14 more days before the earnings
Seems NFLX still the main service for the multitudes.https://finance.yahoo.com/m/3ebc6c18-c0cc-3f29-a931-feaa41cfd4d0/netflix-is-still-viewers%E2%80%99.html?utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=feed&yptr=yahoo
"If they reach 150 million subscribers at an average of $9 per month, their annual revenue would be $16 billion. Making their current market cap pretty reasonable. And if they introduce a cheaper version with ads, they could offset the price reduction with advertising revenue. I don't understand how this stock went from the golden child to the red headed step child of the market. A little competition isn't going to kill them."
Netflix spending $17B on content just this year...hello more cash for more bad Kevin Hart shows...hello leverage to the moon....hello losing more subs...Netflix back below $200 THIS YEAR
games are being played...all so sudden all analyst feels low about it ..two week ago they were so optimistic about it?
Nflx can't seem to stay above 290. It looks like that is where they are going to suppress it.
"Seriously, I think it's going to take a trip to $290 tomorrow."
here comes GREEN
If you want to get in... Buy now before 400.
Worst earnings ever and their growth are complete done and this is still trading above $500? My godness people do like to burn cash 
I called it 360 but went higher. The banks are really opening there wallets. Big blocks buys. Tomorrow another beautiful day. 380.00 easy
Yesterday's share volume was only 42% of the daily average. Nobody's interested and the hedgies can't get out.
Is NFLX being pumped by analysts so their big clients can get out at a decent price?It doesn’t make any sense to upgrade a stock facing negative cash flow + huge debt + rising interest rates + rising competition from other content owners launching their own streaming service
India Numbers lagged coz of Cricket World Cup and Elections. No provider has given so popular and original cult shows than NFLX. It will rocket up soon
Is it quite possible for this to sink to 230 this week?

This is a huge thing for Netflix in terms of owning content. WAY to 600

"Overall good earning but I am not impressed with Earning. While It's nice they beating subscriber number, it come at much higher cost. Balance sheet isn't in great shape.Here is thing I like.1.> Subscriber grow by another 7.2M while I like, everyone expected this.2.> revenue per Subscriber raise little bit.Thing I don't like1.> Marketing cost raising much faster nearly 71% year over year. Even higher than Q4 last year. 2.> Revenue per subscriber raise is lower when you compare history and recent price hike. Without hike it was going 1.5%-2% up as people subscriber higher quality plans. With Raise last Quarter with most not raised until near end of year, it's up only 4.8%.3.> Content spend is getting crazy. I think If they hit unexpected peak for subscriber, Those content cost very hard to pay for. I think level of sharing is unknown but if it's higher than 50%, I think it might even paused early next year. 4.> With Disney and Apple going to enter, Risk of subscriber growth stall is even higher."
Upgrades. Goes down. Upgrades. Goes down. Upgrades again. Goes down. Big subscriber gains leak. Goes down. Surveys show dominance in America. Goes down.

nice solid consolidation before breakout next week
Any idea why we have a 4% drop today! No news that I could find. Earnings don't come out for another 46 days.
THey should revise their guidance down due to Disney +.
Down $32 a share. People will NOT want to pay more money for a Netflix subscription if the stock doesn't hold up.
"Just by thumbs up or thumbs down, what do you think will happen with earnings?Whatever gets more votes, will not happen...."
"Just binged ""The Kominsky Method"" after it's Golden Globe success. Excellent!"
NFLX WILL BE BULLISH THROUGH THEIR EARNINGS ON TUESDAY!!!
The only reason they didn’t beat on EPS is because of the strong !!! It’s amazing how undervalued currencies are all over the world compare to the dollar!!! Other than that record quarter for sure!!! Long nflx!!!
Netflix to $4000 a share by 2022. Mark my words!
everything is factored in already?
"Disney? Hastings doesn’t give them much thought, they are years behind. He’s thinking of where Netflix’s next growth area will be."
"You guys are funny! How many of you actually read the balance sheet of the quarter instead of bragging about 3 or 4 mil subscriptions over 208 mil? I just had a look at the balance sheet (just download it from the investor relations at Netflix). The diluted eps is 3.75 for Q1 alone! The cumulative diluted eps for the 4 quarters of 2020 was 6.08 (about 1.7 per quarter in 2020). To put things in perspective, if the eps stays at these levels the eps for the year is gonna be 12 dollars per share in 2021. On the top of that Netflix is goin to buy back 10 million shares (5 billion in buybacks), which reduces the current float of about 543 mil to approx 533 mil, the lowest number since 2018. With eps 12, at 550 you have P/E of 46, the lowest in the industry. Make your bets!"
Still cool with Netflix.. compared to the bleeding on all tech stocks :D

That's a 63 point drop from here. If the earnings isn't so hot, or subs, the price might drop below the 100 dma and that will become resistance for a while. Imagine all the stops below.

ABOUT TIME
with people piling on the short side I started a position. I don’t like the show in question but when it comes to streaming tv Netflix is the only real game in town. If people really boycotted companies EA would have been out of business a long time ago. The market doesn’t care about your feelings
Maintained at buy by Guggenheim
"All of those who didn't buy on Friday, will be forever broke and not on the winner side.Take chances (which are legit) NFLX is going to skyrocket. again.$$$"
Target raised to $450 from Goldmans. Good night shorts!!
Hastings predicted this pull forward slowdown a year ago. Now he is saying growth will return in the second half.
You can take Disney's 5 year return of 40% & I'll stick with Netflix's 500%

"there are certain companies that do good due to the stay at home orders, NFLX proved that they are benefiting from it. The sub adds were mostly in March and get one month free, the sub adds in March and April will be massive tail wind for the next earnings, we may hit over 1.8 EPS next Q. So while the issues are there in the economy, the slowdown is not affecting this at all, this will continue to march higher."
The latest Nielsen ratings for streaming have Netflix with 19 tv series and movies in the top 20. The streaming wars are not going well for the competition.
Does IBD amateur writers ever watch NFLX for possible breakout? Answer is : no;These IBD writers should get more experience in stock market; Jim Cramer is far superior than those IBD writers!
feels like earnings never happened
"Global growth company.#1 Streaming company in China.So many revenue streams unlike $NFLX. $ROKU holders may be interested also.- 100M+ Paid subscribers- 400M+ Ad supported- gaming with Skymoons- IQiyi Sports- Content distribution- Settop box- 37,000 video screens In Shanghai subway stations- Streaming deal with New Zealand Airline- VR movie deal with hotels- Membership deal with JD.com- VIP deal with Ctrip.com- Licensing deal with Netflix- Licensing deal with NickelodeonMore"
There goes all my gains. Sob. Time to buy more in the $400s
"nflx has no real competition. nflx is up, what, 20 bucks in the past few days? i own a good wad of shares, but want to add more."
They added $NFLX and their competitors are struggling. I’m feeling good!
Big buying continue through out the week. Could reach $340.00.
Everyday from here on out green green green from the grinch
"Churn rate has been constantly decreasing, and reached lowest level this quarter. Churn rate measured how many people cancel subscriptions. Netflix has the lowest churn rate in the Industry. Let me ask: as an investor, would you rather have lots of subscription with people canceling after a few months (high churn rate) or have a very solid stable base of subscribers increasing at a lower rate? I’ll go for the second!"
NFLX HAS A BUY BACK TO SAVE DIVE ON SHARE PRICE.
just remember people netflix can swing 40 points easily in one day it can be down 40. next day up 40. easy profits if you buy now.
recover soon
AM pop for sure! easy $520+ tomorrow. I wouldn't be surprised if we see an article on price increase ;)
LOL that huge sell off only ended up being 5-6%
Hopefully Andrew Left is still holding his 325 short. POS. Can’t stand finance channels allowing these people to tout a short (or long) stock to enrich their own wallet. At worst there should be a counter point on air with them.

Congratulations to all long
WOW!
safe for bulls now
433$ tomorrow hold tha stock.
"Streaming is still in the early stages, so if Netflix remains the leader much higher stock prices are guaranteed."
do not need joetrader statment- easy 10 points down. It´s 3 points down an 15 points up and 5 point up next day and 10 point up next and flat after that.
Trash over valued virtue signaling company
NFLX might trade lower 5% in the morning but I expect it to pop back up and close green... NFLX never fails!!!

Made $14.00 a share today. Great day.
Tom Rodgers former NBC executive and founder of CNBC just said on CNBC no one will come close to Netflix. Everyone will have Netflix and other services will be fighting with each other for 2nd and 3rd place.
I paid $15 a share before 7:1 split. Trust me this goes higher.
earnings at close
disney slowed down because the free ride is over. No more free service
"Think of google+ trying to topple Facebook, orkut vs Facebook. Bing vs google. Just because a strong competitor is stepping into the streaming space doesn’t mean bad news for the top players. Netflix will keep growing and eventually get far too high than any other streaming service."

"Five day losing streak ends! Only the 6th green day in 17 this month.The way it was going, I was sure it was going to end red.For the 1st time in 8 days, the previous high is surpassed.We have now gone 12 days without the high reaching 10. Still can not hold a lead. High was +7.43 today. I guess any green day, is a good day.See how it goes tomorrow...."
Glad I sold off and got out.
Well. 10% seems extreme
"Low cancellations and production back up means subscriber growth accelerates in second half. Increasing subscriber engagement means more price increases coming. Everything’s good, back the truck up."
When Netflix does nothing but win.
Will close below 500 tomorrow. Trust me.
it's good time to buy
Netflix is over as is Tesla. Over valued and more competition .
Netflix says The Queen’s Gambit is 1 of its most viewed shows ever. The unexpected big hit has always resulted in a subscriber beat. With a subscriber beat and the recent price increase investors will see pricing power and bid the stock to new highs.
Why?
NFLX doesn't like higher interest rates.
So shorts....show me the $220.00 bottom....Hmmmmm! Buy to cover your short which will propel this stock to $310.00 in March and $350.00 in April after earnings. NFLX may be acquired either by AAPL or DIS.
Netflix depended o. Short sellers toPush stock higher and now short seller are smart and algo unable to capture
"Covid hurt NFLX with lighter new content, subs loss when people lost income, and — most importantly— I’ve watched everything they have & finished their entire catalog. I’m bored & done. Almost done with Prime, until new releases of Goliath, Jack Ryan, Grand Tour, the Boys. Nothing left that’s good on NFLX."
"Just finished The Witcher S1E1 and it's WAW! The sets, costumes, music, battles and fights are impressive!"
"There will always be dip buyers, but there's an entire quarter now where nothing other than a split should move this up beyond $550 or get anywhere near $600. My guess is this will come down to $450 or less at some point in the next couple of months during market downturns. That's when I might consider getting in again for a swing trade. Stocks need catalysts to make big moves up and Netflix doesn't have any coming for awhile that I can see. Even the next ER in three months doesn't provide much excitement with them only estimating a million sub adds."
Need to close above 380 by Friday.
"CORRUPT, everything is up and NFLX tanks at the open, just temporary pain but still."

"I recently canceled my Netflix subscription after many years. The content (to me) seems more geared toward a politically correct message than pure entertainment. It's not that I'm opposed to the messages, but I just don't find it entertaining to be preached to (hit over the head again and again) with what seems to be a SJW propaganda. I know this post will be deleted in about 15 minutes, so read it while you can."

I feel the April earnings report will finally settle the debate on Netflix’s performance during economic hardship. Will they subscribe in droves to pass the time in isolation or will there be mass cancellations in an attempt to preserve cash.
"netflix at the point now where they will have to re-invent themselves somehow, or jack prices up continually. in the the streaming world there really is no point in subscribing to one service forever. we subscribe to 2-3 at a time and cycle to different ones every year, you get bored watching the same B grade shows all the time."
On the call they mentioned they are being prudent/conservative on their guidance.
Still. 10 dollars to the two-weeks-ago’s record. Will be 1000 in no time. 9-12 months.
Jim Cramer tonight mad money cnbc said. The market cap of Netflix at 150b is too small versus what it is doing world wide. It’s a gigantic entertainment company!
Anyone else think $NFLX is expected to have huge earnings and great new subscriber growth but is probably priced in already so once numbers are released it could go down?
"This is EXACTLY why Netflix remains the BEST OF THE FANGS! Fact is they REMAIN...The ONLY FANG to Beat Top, Bottom and Guidance! In addition where apple is starting to realize there may only be SO MUCH consumers are willing to pay for an I Phone(Now 1000-1500?) Netflix 1 Dollar increases here& there to improve content are barely perceptible!"
What is wrong with our President?
Anyone know any other subscriber based stocks similar to Netflix? This might be a sign of trouble for them as well
Too big of a jump. Will expect it to fall within a couple days. Anyone else buying puts?
Was priced about 3 years ahead of itself
They signed up to pay 100 million to air Friends for another year. To me this is flashing red. This shows you that most of the inhouse productions are not doing much to sustain members.
Where Netflix is going
"$NFLX $WIMI $BABA Fry stocks to be patient, there is time to slowly add positions, the bottom here"
This trash stock ruining tech stocks tomorrow.
NFLX isnt just a good stock its a great stock.Anything under 10%($360) is a strong buy.
"There is not a stitch of risk priced into this stock. Free Cash flow -1.3B and worsening. Current competition will not over take Netflix but the services will reduce Netflix ability to raise its prices. Once Disney comes their services is expected to be cheaper which will keep prices deflated for a long time. NFLX continues to add on debt as the operating cashflow continues to deteriorate. This should trade with some risk priced in it is rare to see a company this developed to trade at over 30x book value, 10.3x sales, and 127x earnings. Its laughable, the company is growing but that growth is at a cost which is debt and -free cashflow which add significant risk. I will open up a short position after a trade deal is signed. I believe the only thing holding stocks up currently is this trade deal and that the swath of negative news has been negated by this deal."
nflx's cash flow is a -2B. it survives on borrowing. how long it could last?
"This quarter must have been the best quarter for Netflix and they still miss earnings. Really? how good can this get?States are experimenting to ease lockdowns, This may not may Netflix lose subscribers. But it will definitely not get more, as people who were thinking about subscribing or not, have already subscribed to it over the lockdowns. So no new customers to add. With such a high P/E of 85$, This will slowly trickle to 400s."
$227 before close
There we go boys
Overvalued. Losing customers too fast. Should dive even more.
I wish you all would stop giving out useless unsolicited advice
"GreenLight shorted Tesla and Netflix.So I am long on both among stocks (as well as Apple, Amazon etc)."

"The bike / bike+ is priced more or less right, the treadmill is too expensive. But: $PTON is mostly a content company, why should the consumer pay for the $PTON service mostly the same as:$NFLX standard + $AMZN prime + $SPOT combined???Too expensive to be sustainable. Won't scale outside high-income households in a handful of countries. Not priced right."
Anyone think this is going straight to 400 from here still?
"Next, FB to hire Bill and Hillary to turn things around."

Susan Rice knows nothing about tech. Why on earth would they select someone so liberal and so controversial. Talk about being completely out off tune with a conservative point of view. What does that tell you about the arrogance of mgmt or their isolation from conservative points of view. I wouldn't trust this board anymore to make right decisions after this move.
Green is coming
"This morning we saw the preview of what will happen to NFLX when the music actually stop. NFLX could drop + $5 to -$7 less tham 1 hr. Once we have the actual profit taking day or reversal day, NFLX will drop 20- 25 pts in one day."
"So, the Ceo Sold Sub $300, they burned through their Cash for Disney (Marvel Studios, Lucas Film), Fox Content. These Two Extremely Expensive Content Providers are half of the Top Ten Movies on Netflix. The Netflix Killer is coming. All they need to do is PULL their Content from Netflix, offer a Cheaper, Promotional Streaming Service for a Year and Netflix is Toast, you'll all be Stuck watching Birdbux, or Birdbath, whatever, it makes you click on it by accident on the Homepage, generating fake data. Good Luck, when this Titanic sinks. Competition is Real."

"Analyst Actions: Evercore ISI Upgrades Netflix to Outperform From In-Line, Sets $665 Price TargetBY MT Newswires— 9:46 AM ET 04/06/2021"
This price increase just confirms that this quarter was good. Why would nflx raise rates on a miss? To loose even more subscribers because lets face it there will be cheap ones who will btch about the $2 increase. I expect a 1 million sub loss due to increase but that will clear the path for future.

Always take the long term view with this stock. Be patient. Easily $500 in 12-18 months.
Not much movement today. Sign of a downward trend?
$550 on Monday
thank you short.
close around 400 hopefully
How could there be such a huge miss on subscribers but not on earnings?
Did we make it thru the profit takers yet?
"Anyone else who sees NFLX as a classic Bubble please comment on WHERE you believe were are in the process. I believe were are at the beginning of the ""return to normal"" phase. I am uncertain when NFLX will drop, but NFLX will certainly plummet. Right now I think under $100 by June 2019. I want to buy more puts on NFLX but am debating how far out to buy.???What are your thoughts???? Here is a very short article with the stock market bubble chart for reference:https://seekingalpha.com/article/4140975-investors-ignore-clear-sign-stock-market-bubble"
Been waiting for Goldman Sachs upgrade and here it is. For some reason theirs has the biggest impact on the stock. Let’s see what happens.
So Benchmark recommends sell. Do they really think people will sell prior to a monster earning report coming on Tuesday. Over ten upgrades over the last ten days from major firms upgrading NFLX to high 400's and then tiny little Benchmark going against the grain to maybe grab some cheap shares from weak hands. Don't think it'll work for them.
I would not be surprised to see this up 4-5% today after the nice analyst notes this morning. Short covering could really drive this higher.
"Netflix on conference call. Netflix wants to be your best friend where you go from one hit show to another, you may occasionally go somewhere else as a one-off, such as Hamilton; but we want to be your main source of entertainment"
"I don't know if its true. Someone in India, a higher up public official? seems to have said the 50 million subscribers is max for India, not 200 million.If so, NFLX seems likely to sell off. Another article seemed to point to Google's Youtube, Apple streaming, Amazon, and others having had time to become a force of resistance. Add in the high debt and it seems to me the odds are NFLX has seen its high for quite some time. jmhoI like to back out and look at longer time periods. Seems to have a message. The 4 year chart has $130 for support. If it goes to the 313-315 range again (I forgot the low), it will be the third time, I'm thinking it breaks through to the downside then. 385 to 316 or so was a nice shortdoesn't mean it is necessarily even going down from here or bouncing and then going down. I just think it is likely. ................To me, they are losing money. Someone pointed out that they went more in debtt for new content, then they made in revenue. That's scrary, but they do have the potential to bring in revenue for years on the content. It seems to me they jumped in very heavily into massive debt trying to fend off the competition, before the competition made them irrelevant.You know one serious issue is that Apple and Amazon and maybe others are willing to basically give away their streaming service just to get the subscribers to help them sell product in their stores. That's a touch one for NFLX to work against. They have been quite creative though. Maybe they will bring on the education thing or something else. They could start selling things, compete agains Amazon and Apple, fight fire with fire. It's possible they could come up with some ingenious ideas to keep growing.I think they won't or it will be too little to late. Could be wrong.I'm thinking it tanks to $130 and soon.just a hunch based on information I have explained here"
Everything has dropped the last 3 hours today. It's been a bad 2 weeks for almost everything. Why would you expect Netflix to NOT following the same downward trajectory. Almost every stock has now given back it's previous daily gain.
"They should make HD standard, and 4K 2nd tier. SD should be removed."

"Every time NFLX raised price, the came short on their earnings. This speaks volume about what to see in future. It has stiff competition and competitors are catching up. It is getting hard to get new subscribers so increasing prices. Just like medical insurance companies, limited consumers so keep raising prices to stay in profit...i see more red in coming days and months...now that they raised the price less new consumers will be attracted. Netflix had price benefit over Amazon prime, now that they are kinda of same in pricing,it will be hard to convince new consumers..."

Katzenberg, a former Disney executive who later helped start DreamWorks, raised nearly $2 billion to finance Quibi.”"

Thornton adds that FX rates have been favorable to Netflix, which should support its average-revenue-per-user metric. The analyst further notes that the recent market pullback makes valuation on the stock more tenable."
Netflix always bounces back! Their service is here for the long haul! Thanks for the opportunity to add more pre earnings!
No reason to be bullish on this stock. Netflix CEO even admitted again today that competition is hurting their subs... The dynamics have changed. Soon every company will be streaming their content and those companies have far more original content than Netflix since they’ve been producing for DECADES. Just the reality. Netflix is no longer unique in streaming. They certainly ain’t unique in content. Basically they have NO MOAT. Their business is under attack at every angle from competitors.
Sold @ 503.00. Bought @490.00. Nice quick profit. 50 shares. Glad I held overnight.
"Crazy how this is headed towards the green today, when yesterday everyone was in panic mode, congrats to all who didn’t panic sell!"

"@Miroslav, I will tell you a secret .. I also have 200 Netflix shares, bought at 493 last summer, and this is a small volume from my portfolio. Over the past year I have already earned + 100-200% on Tesla, Modern, Banks and retail, etc. I also have AMD shares bought at a price of $ 85 .. 600 shares. And I'll tell you what, Netflix and AMD are my worst investment. I don’t sell them just because I made enough money on other stocks and covered my losses multiple times here. Now I'm just wondering how long they will be useless)). I do not believe in these companies, but a miracle may happen and they will grow up and I will sell them at + 20%."

Much less risk if your objective is a great earnings call since you can only lose your 780.00 original buy price if out of the money however, if it doesn't crash you still have a time value. My point is don't end up paying 33k on 100 shares of stock you will lose way more than 800.00 if it turns against you. I tried to explain as simple as I could that trading options is fun with much less risk and NOT hard as long as you have a plan. GL"

"The only justification the bulls have for justifying this NFLX valuation is comparing it to Amazon, but they're very different companies. Amazon could reap AMAZING profits in a heartbeat if they wanted to stop spending all of their profits into growth. How is NFLX ever going to make considerable money without jacking the rates up to near cable levels?"
"Most of the stuff on Netflix is just garbage. Poorly done, social commentary. The good stuff is older, recycled movies most people have seen. There are so many better options and Netflix will continue it's slow descent, never understanding what is happening."
Just think what an awesome experience it would be to watch a movie on Netflix while utilizing the game changing technology from HAPBF.

Ignore the gyrations from shorts and day traders. Buy for the long term and sell at $1,500."

"Disney’s appeal is that it has content for everyone. It’s library will go back more than 75 years. Add to that all the Fox content including 20th century and 21st century fox. Netflix has tons of debt on it’s balance sheet and is still borrowing to this day. Disney owns a massive amount of content, numerous studios to make content at, television networks and doesn’t borrow money to make content. Disney’s biggest deficit is ESPN. If Disney would put the hammer down and stop ESPN from bidding over priced professional sports contracts and return it to a sports news network they could sell or dump it."

$NFLX could gobble this up for $7B market cap.... $3.41 is small. This can double easily!
Hit $425 three years ago! This stock is old news.

"short have been accumulating in names like fb,nfln,twtr,snap and others for the past 6 weeks. one problem for influx shorts is that the price momentum stalled and it isn't dropping. pain is to the upside and its not about mkt cap its about where traders can separate the most amount of money from investors. nflx is going to trade back to $380-390 in the next 6 weeks and come earnings they could pull a tsla and be back over $400."
So the weekend action on the board tells me that the shorts had a nervous weekend. Just got back from a relaxing weekend and pumped for another awesome week for NFLX. Lets get this to $360 guys. It helps keep the shorts crying under their pillows and it is fun to see them hiding all day. Can I hear the longs give me a hell yeah? And any shorts who gave up are welcome to join and give me a hell yeah too :)? Lets keep the rally going guys and keep the shorts running.
"Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) dreams of getting its next 100 million subscribers from India.

"Disney Plus+ perfect example folks! Go research their news feed with charts. New subscribers in the millions then boom! Didn’t necessary mean money in the books! Tesla is the same way! It’s based off of future projections. The future validation are worth more than current price, companies then use that leverage as future collateral as credit to reuse in the company."

"NFLX daily chart looks very bullish to me. Seems to want to hold the 200dma, with mid- and long-term uptrend strengthening."
500 million subscribers by 2025
Just wait for netty to add 10 million subs thanks to de niro
Wouldn't it be a good idea to stop password sharing and launch a free Netflix service with just older Netflix originals (2months after payed release) and short commercials?
Reality check.
600$ next week
Less subscribers mean more profit because the cost of subscription increases. It’s money making machine. 5 year chart is showing massive consolidation. It will make new highs by the end of the year. Buy calls six month out. Easy money!

"Netflix Inc.'s (NFLX) 12-month price target was increased to $245 from $230 at MKM Partners on Thursday. MKM analyst Rob Sanderson raised his subscriber outlook for Netflix for 2018, saying the company has yet to reach its peak year for total subscriber additions. ""We continue to view Netflix as the large cap with the most potential for market cap appreciation over the next three to four years,"" Sanderson wrote in a note to investors. Sanderson said he expects Netflix to add 20.6 million subscribers next year, which is roughly in line with FactSet consensus of 20.9 million, but would be down from 2017 consensus of 22.0 million subscriber additions. This year was expected to be the streaming service's peak for subscriber additions, but Sanderson said it's more likely to come in 2019 or 2020. ""We think Netflix has a large first mover advantage, expecting to spend $7 billion to $8 billion next year, far more than any other programmer,"" Sanderson wrote."

"Here's another one for Tim's comment earlier:@tim said:$FB $AAPL $AMZN $NFLX $GOOG $GOOGLTalk about inflation? FAANG along with the rest of the stock market is inflated. If I wanted to get involved in FAANG as of today's closing prices, it would cost me $4k total to buy just 1 share in each company. Here's my acronym. GEB=Grossly Extended Bubble$FB-$177.46$AAPL-$217.94$AMZN-$1927.68$NFLX-$364.58$GOOGL-$1256.27Here's my take:Tim, you probably thought that on Jan 2, 2018 as well. Let's do the IRA contribution again, but with just FANG stocks. (This example could also be a college fund).$6500 to spend on FANG stocks on Jan. 2, 2018AMZN $1209.59 x 1 share = $1209.59 (18.6% of investment)GOOGL $1095.76 x 1 share = $1095.76 (16.7% of investment)FB $184.33 x 7 shares = $1290.31 (19.8% of investment)NFLX $205.63 x 7 shares = $1439.41 (22.1%) = $1464.93 leftAAPL 173.03 x 8.46 shares = $1463.83 (22.5% of investment), this is an AAPL board, right?So you spent $6500 and ended up with 5 companies and a total of 24.46 shares. Here's where you are as of close 8/27/18, using your numbers verbatim copied:$FB-$177.46 x 7 shares = $1242.22, -3.7%$AAPL-$217.94 x 8.46 shares = $1843.77, +26.0%$AMZN-$1927.68 x 1 share = $1927.68, +59.4%$NFLX-$364.58 x 7 shares = $2552.06, +77.3%$GOOGL-$1256.27 x 1 share = $1256.27, +14.6%Overall, for your $6500 investment, your total is now $8820.00, increase of $2320, and gain of 35.7%. Not bad for owning ""only"" 24.46 shares of good, quality stocks that are leaders in their fields."

"Differences between the Disney earnings dip and the Netflix earnings dip: Netflix dipped almost 12%, Disney almost 6%. Netflix dipped because people are unsubscribing, Disney dipped because it's investing in growth. Prediction... Disney rebounds before the end of the week. Netflix can't seem to shake off 305 price still. We'll see if I'm right."
NFLX going to $600 after earnings! Don't know if it'll hold. GLTA
"Why red,,,,"
67% upside from here
"In a statement, Netflix defended its decision: “We strongly support artistic freedom worldwide"" and only removed this episode in Saudi Arabia after we had received a legal request from the authoritarian regime— we aren't interested in truth or justice, just money."
Time to get out of the Netflix submarine!
"Question about low Q2 marketing spend and how they are improving margins, and whether spending will remain depressed in the near-term.Sarandos: Our members spend a lot of time on Netflix every day. So the best place to talk to them about Netflix is Netflix, and we put a lot of effort into that. We're spending less, but doing more to create buzz and attention for our content.Neumann: We previously expected marketing spend would be roughly flat in 2020. But it now looks like it'll be lower. Some of the spending declines are temporary in nature, but some of it is permanent due to what we've been learning.Hastings: The service is getting better and better, and we're taking advantage of that."

Short squeeze........ Happy
https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/netflix-original-spending-85-percent-1202809623/@Tilly it was Netflix who cancelled the the Marvel TV series and instead of licensing movies from Disney Netflix decided to spend the money on original content instead. Ted Sarandon clearly says that in the following interview.
"lol who ever thinks it was a good idea for Netflix to break the news about the password issue doesnt have stocks in Netflix because Netflix is going down, I already know about 10 people who cancelled their Netflix because of that need  greediness"
netflix is running into huge competition now
Huge huge huge green week ahead. I'm not selling belw 375$. Tomorrow new 52high 100%
"Check my postings and realize that I don't post just speculation and I am going to tell you straight. This BULL can run to 600 easy before earnings announcement on Thursday after market closes. Then 700 is a cake walk. Look at how AMZN and TSLA gained 30% in just a short burst. It is NFLX's turn to make that same crazy run while this pandemic situation has forced even Trump to take flight to safety. People, just stay home with your kids for a while. Enjoy your family, no school, no gym and definitely no more mass protesting without a mask and gloves. The cure is coming soon but in the mean time, enjoy yourself with the company that amassed so much content for such an occasion. Immerse yourself away from the reality of life with your kids and the wife. Time to get real close and build that family bond so that the memory ot these times may be pleasant not full of pain and heartaches. Buy yourselves some NFLX 600 calls for around October and shut your computer down. Now, go to the bank in October and treat your family to that vacation you all dreamed of. The fruits of your labor= L abor U nder C orrect K nowledge."
Surprised that Netflix didn’t take a huge hit today because of Disney and is actually green why?? More competition the better? Someone please explain.....
"Time to cut operating expenses by 15% - reduce salaries for top management who don't do anything.Focus on genres that people actually watch all the way, not just hopping around."
"I thought long and hard which is the biggest red flag bullish NFLX analysts miss. It's tempting to point at the $2.5B cash burn expected in 2020 - analysts pin hopes that this huge investment in content will eventually be offset by subscribers fees, forgetting perhaps that most subscribers crave only the recent new series or movie, i.e. content gets stale fast. Another mistake analysts make it to evaluate the impact of competition this quarter, mostly ignoring the fact that Apple, Disney and so many others are only getting started. But here is the point most widely missed: NFLX has near zero customer captivity, which is a very bad thing for ANY business: it's super easy to subscribe to a new streaming service - Roku makes it even easier by passing your email through and acting as the payment agent - and even easier to select from your menu of streaming services every day, until one day you may decide you prefer other streaming over NFLX."

"Why hasn't HBO, Showtime, Max etc, etc..... Taken Netflix out?? New streaming options are no different. People will carry Netflix plus multiple other options,,,,,, If anything they will cxl the HBO'S AND SHOWTIMES of the world before Netflix.... Can't wait til earning!! 410+"
Why was this beaten? Just for fun? Nothing?
can anyone suggest what would the good price to purchase 100 shares?
Futures are up
Netflix is modern day blockbuster video stores. Gl
Who was on this board who said that NFLX will be at $340.00 by the end of the week???Must be a genius!!!!Thank you for the TIP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
missed it again. already up by 3% in 1 hour
The mighty leviathan rises! nothing like a little trade deal chatter and little monetary stimulus to invigorate the animal spirits.
on down days like this market sell off accelerates in the last 30 minutes of the trading day. be patient....
Netflix has been basically flat for a year. Has this stock become the best short on the market? Or is this the plateau before the descend?
Do you know why analyst talk about subscriber numbers and not free cash flows?( NFLX can never be positive free cash)Does any analyst or Reed talk about how much a international subscribers pay?( 90cents per month compare to US customer paying around $10/month.NFLX stock is a bubble. only people who would loose at end are the ones with 401K invested in these bubbles.
Thanks All. NFLX has no exposure in China....collateral damage
Will recover after lunch
All the streaming services combined aren’t as much competition as cable TV was.

At the current time is more secure than holding your money in bank :D
sell... google amazon disney and apple taking over streaming... save yourself
How many ppl here use cable tv in here?.. Just wonder.... How much for a month you have to pay?..
FYI - it's not to late to get in on Disney. You'll get 3x the amount of shares and a ton more on return. Your choice.

Daily fluctuations in this stock can be $12-$20 in the blink of an eye. Either you have an iron gut or NEVER EVER look how it trades over an 8 hour time span.
The numbers look good!
Buy FUBO the new kid on the block. NFLX is tired !! ROKU is going to be 550.
Dead money until 200s
watch the stock movement at the close - If it closes in a downward fashion I predict high 370's easily post earnings.Another earnings miss just doesn't seem like its in the cards this time around.
did you know before the July 2015 split netflix lost 140 points a few months before. made a fast recovery though. 25 points x7 before spit is 140. no one really analyzes charts they just panic sell. longs are good!
First GREEN Monday since Oct. 1... so at least we have that going on for us...
WE NEED A HEDGE FUND TO START MOVING IT UP!
"On CNBC Greenfield likes NFLX saying that 10 million new subscribers is exceptional, With no new Hollywood TV programming NFLX is again a winner. Movie Theatres are close so this is a no brainer."
Is it related to people closing out options positions before triple witching this Friday? This is strange move
"the current price $315 makes sense when nfkx was monopoly. With Disney and Apple enter streaming, nflx will drop to $140."
"The market is very near the end of its bottoming process, once it regains its footing, the stock could easily trade back above 300 on very strong subscriber growth numbers. JMHO"
Sold 18k shrs of msft to buy more netflix at this level. This is now oversold by 28.00.
Netflix trying desperate measures is sign of big crash coming
NFLX back to $550 at closing this Friday!
"NFLX should be over 700 after this ER, it hit 593 then backed off since last ER, and this ER is expected to be even better....wonder if it will soar past 700?"
"Vs, that sounds complicated.why not go long and make big money like the rest of us?????"
"still they posted 25% (2,98)vs(3.75) higher EPS, than expected, why media/investors ignoring it."
"Subscribed ESPN+ and it's great. Work very well. Navigation is good.you can watch live games, Some great documentary movies, NFL Draft series and more. ( I think they going to limit 1 game /day but you don't watch more than that)I think this may be helpful to Streaming service like Netflix, it prove there is no technology advantage Netflix has. And Content clearly Disney is still king and with Fox deal going to remain that way.So I am not sure how people think Netflix can handle competition from Disney and Apple and list of other. At Best case scenario, people rotate service. Worst case, people subscriber on Service like ESPN and very limited money left for Service Like Netflix.Think if you have 200M subscriber but only for 3 month out of year that's just 50M subscriber. Netflix might get custom to service rotation as quality streaming service grow."

Come back in at $125.00.

Are we going to rock it out tomorrow afternoon?
going to 307 if the Dow can get to 300+ for the day. this stock is heavily traded on 300+ days.
Foreign subscriptions are in foreign currency which come to $1-$2 per subscriber per month. They don't make ANY money on foreign subscription in poor 3rd world countries. They just use those numbers to deceive rookie investors that they are growing. What a sham company!
Why is this down. No more upgrades ??
"Someone is working hard to keep our Netflix down . Alas , she will rise today . Too many subs to ignore ."
Viacom
"the thing that people have to remember, is that this last quarter means nothing. a low original content slate caused a decrease in additions, although churn was ‘unusually low.’ this is on top of what i believe is the biggest catalyst for the stock, the sony deal. focusing more on acquiring outstanding streaming licenses is an amazing growth sector which netflix has sort of fallen off of. think the recent acquisition of the rights to the knives out sequels, in addition to new shows like the kids jurassic park animation. this quarter was unlucky. it’s not happening again."
"Hey all, I’m not long or short here and just started looking into the company and am a little confused by the business model. I get that they are spending boatloads to create content which is amounting to significant cash burn resulting in negative CFO. Seems as though management is confident this is necessary to keep subscribers growing and will lay the groundwork for a strong stream of income into the future. That sounds great if it works out but this almost seems to good to be true. Questions that come to mind are: how long will it take to be cash flow positive, especially with the burn rate increasing rather than decreasing? What if popular shows fall out of favor in the distant future, get pirated, or too many new shows flop? What about competition? This just seems to me like a very aggressive strategy and that no matter how many subscribers they can get, the ultimate sustainability of the business will depend on being able to generate cash flow which can only mean higher prices which will attract more competition at some point. This reminds me a little bit of the flaws of Pandora’s model in a way where they had to spend more and more on royalties to keep up with subscriber growth. I guess there’s something I’m missing here because market clearly doesn’t agree with me but it’s not like crazier things haven’t happened before or will again..."
bought just for the earnings lol. Casino boyz
"To be honest, this is a bit aggressive and I'am not even invested in this."
Netflix with its scale advantage is buying back shares while Disney is losing $billions in streaming. Amazon can hide its streaming loses long enough until it is profitable.
Over reaction
"300 now, 3000 in 10 years"
"Today, Jeffries analyst rated Buy Netflix with a target of $ 620). All these analysts bet $ 550-750 a year ago). I bought it a year ago, so what?) Where are my 600+?) It's good to be an analyst, you risk not your own money)."
Just bought 15 shares
There’s absolutely no reason why you’d sell unless you’re using your margin. And people who use their margin should not trade at all for so many reasons one of them being they don’t hold over a few days and they cause the market to fluctuate badly and when they get fought in the a rainstorm like this they get hurt. But I find it so entertaining to see how people can criticize a massive company’s finances from their basement desk about debts and “bad” financial strategies as if Netflix itself doesn’t have the intelligence to manage its company with such global presence and worth billions. This hit is not targeted to Netflix. And I’m sure in couple years the prices will recover and in 10 years you will retire with more money
If Netflix boycotts Georgia I will cancel my subscription and so will all other family members. The pro life movement will organize and make our voices heard.

"Good news for FB longs and all ""Big Tech"" investors. Mike Santoli has proclaimed the end of FANG ($FB $AMZN $NFLX $GOOGL). In my years of following him, he's always been a great contrarian indicator. I guess FB will rally this week after all."
It’s jumped 30-40% within the last 15 days. I guess that’s enough for small investors like us. I’ll probably take out my profit before closing and I wish a GL to those who stay

Chart looks like Bitcoin
I smell more price increases!
"OMG I had to type this twice. Thanks Yahoo you rock! I'm seeing an ascending triangle on the weekly chart since 10/1/18. I think NFLX is at a crossroads at the moment. This needs to see a strong close above 285 to go to the next level, which is the previous highs at mid 410's. It has failed this 285 attempt the last 3 days in a row. The question is can it get there? I'll be watching. This is primed for a big move either way. GLTA"
"Reed Hastings decimated the Blockbuster Video model, revolutionized the DVD rental market, then introduced the world to streaming videos & created an empire with few barriers to entry at the time; Peacock, Disney, AMZN Prime, etc. are only some of the competitors moving forward, and Europe certainly isn't going to be the driver for NFLX in the near term; it was good while it lasted, they won't disappear anytime soon but their trajectory for growth in the New World Economic (catastrophe) seems strained"
"its a falling business model for many international countries. movies are big part of media and many government control how the media is broadcasted. the hollywood has created many great movies that advertising american values to the world. this has changed with pandemic and American elections, many parts of the world are less interested in so call Americans values when Americans cant even control the pandemic and had riots on the streets, cant even have a sooth election. no way NFLX can keep creating best contents for many international countries while there are many local monopoly by both private and government controlled companies."
"Dave chapelle gave you guys the hint with regards to media companies. He said Netflix was the most fair and he, a creator prefers working with them than other legacy media"
"Lionsgate is only 1.5 billion dollars, with a vast movie library that Disney, and other companies wont bother buying. Netflix could easily snag it for less than 2 billion. Wasted opportunity."

"Canceled my Netflix subscription due to political differences. The hiring of the Obamas is just too much for me to handle, I will not support Netflix."
Big crash coming
Nobody here can explain the rally
Mission accomplished..
"Unfortunately, after it’s most recent leg up, it seems to have gotten caught in a range. It may go back down to the 200 day moving average around $323 before heading upward again. Hopefully, it can push up push past $240 on a good earnings report or other good news."
Down here it’s a value. We are only up 30% in share value since the start of the pandemic. Even though it has accelerated Netflix bigly. 30% is nothing compared to other stretched names up 200%
Tesla dropped on cash and liquidity concerns. Guess who's next to see bottom soon....
There is no reason for this to happen. If I had more money I would have bought more. Can someone tell me if they will cancel their NFLX submission if it is increased a buck or two?
"Enough consolidating, time for new highs."
"What can happen to stock in weeks, look at $TSLA. It traded 365 on Monday and now 300. Only difference between Tesla and Netflix is, it pumped by CEO v/s Analyst. 5000/month which consider impossible 3 month Ago, Elon make it happen (Even while temporary) yet stock gone down 20% with sell on News.If anyone think this stock can't go 350, They will soon learn very expensive lessons."
This stock is going to retest $400 levels.
I bought at $530 when it was climbing.. ugh not sure what to do
"Something I just noticed. We last hit 300 a month ago today. First time NFLX hit 300 was back on March 2.From March 2 to Nov. 14, it was 300+ in 170 of 180.The the longest it went not in 300 during the stretch was 9 days March 28 to April 10. And then ONE day in Oct. 30.Dec. 3, we got to 298.72 and then closed the day 290.30Next day, 295.74 and closed 275.30We are going to need a good run to hit 300 again this year."

"What happened to 400 few days in AFH? Man, this stock is rigged to crash below 250 in a week"
Dumped at $272. Absolutely crazy action and I had a target of $268 by next week but when we blew through that had to re-think. Couldn't pass up an $80/share gain in a few weeks. I will be back on this one. Good luck to longs. This has been the biggest 3 week gain I've ever had. Thank you NFLX.
I got this at 247 and about to add.
A lot of games are played with this stock. I hold a small amount here to see which direction big money takes this before ER. They could just as easily take it to $590 or $500 from here.

"I saw the previews of the new series Lost In Space today, coming in April. I was very impressed with the video.If this is as good as the preview it could be another Stranger Things. It looks to have a favorite cast of young and old and the special effects are outstanding. I can't wait to see it."
how strange for this board to be so quiet when the stock is so active

"Tech radar 11/11Netflix India has posted a record growth of 700% for the Fiscal year 2018-2019 according to a recent report. There are various factors behind its growth in India that lets Netflix stand out from the sea of growing streaming players including it's global rival Amazon Prime Video and local players like Hotstar.From nine streaming services in 2012, India currently has around 39 players in the business. Netflix is the biggest video streaming player in the world but wasn't met with great enthusiasm when it entered India back in 2016.Since then, the company has doubled-down on offering local content, low-cost mobile plans and partnerships with telecom operators that headline its 700% growth in the country.https://www.techradar.com/in/news/netflix-fy19-revenues-up-700-in-india-thanks-to-regional-content-and-mobile-plans"

Why was NFLX up 4% today - great storyhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-netflix-stock-popped-4-233500531.html
"Netflix LeadsNetflix Inc. led all studios with five wins, including prizes for “Roma,” about the maid in a well-to-do Mexican family, and the comedy “The Kominsky Method.” Alfonso Cuaron won best director for “Roma,” which also grabbed the prize for best foreign language film. “The Kominsky Method” won Golden Globes for best comedy and best actor for its star Michael Douglas.The wins for “Roma” gave “that film the push it needed,” said Erik Davis, managing editor of Fandango.com “I think ‘Roma’ is your new best picture Oscar frontrunner starting now.”To help win awards, Netflix is giving some releases more theatrical exposure than ever before. Cuaron said “Roma” may have gotten more exposure than if he had chosen a traditional distributor."
Guys was it a good idea to buy 10 at 380??!!
"As we all know, NFLX can go up just as fast as it went down...stay tuned."
Won’t stay under 500 for long. Grab your shares now!!!
I'm buying in today. No way it's not going to beat the earnings report. 400 easy.
I’ve been using prime streaming recently and have almost stopped going to the others
It’s really green now and of course tomorrow too
Wait till Disney starts making announcements about Disney plus on their CC tomorrow. Disney is a marketing master and their content will not only be for kids but also adults with ESPN and all their blockbuster adult movies and content they will create. Can you also imagine if.they gave discounts to their parks and hotels for subscribers??? Hmmm!!! Netflix will survive but not at.this valuation.
Upgrade is coming
"I dont like them paying tens of millions of dollars to political types just so they can push some agenda. I mean, its a free country, but I wont pay them by being a subscriber."
I have not lost confidence in companies delivering good and great ER but i have definitely lost confidence in a market behaving rationally.
Netflix earnings preview https://www.google.com/amp/s/news.alphastreet.com/netflix-earnings-preview-q2-2018/amp/

"Roku: Time To Buy Again https://seekingalpha.com/article/4219850?source=ansh $ROKU, $NFLX"
"Guys, nflx is not just streaming .... It is becoming full production that stages movies worth Oscar nominations (many 2020 Oscar nominations). If they start doing premieres of these movies in movies theaters, each night is worth the price of a subscriber for a month. There were companies in Hollywood making a living just out of movie theaters ... Do you math. At 500 I'm back in tomorrow first thing in the morning. See you in 2 to 5 years from now."
we had seen the greatest show NFLX had put for us... from $344 to $379 just one day...we are hoping for more great show today from $379 back to normal $423... Go Go Go NFLX!!!
Great price!
"El Camino, The Irishman, The Witcher this Q vs BM Bandersnatch, The Birdbox, Haunting of Hill House in the same Q last year. Last year they added 8.8 million subscribers in Q4. They should add more than that this Q with a stronger slate of new shows."
NFLX reached a new All Time High at 304.20
I have to admit the what you did with Dolly Parton was amazing Congrat
I wonder if Netflix stocks will be affected by a severe slowdown in subscriber growth at Disney + ..
"See why RR doesn't play netflix earnings. They got Sektor 4 times in a row. He was right on 48 stocks before that. He told the little robinhooders with 2k accounts Sektor the whale wanted to save them at 30, get out, like Buddah the magnificent got the whole world out of vgac at 18.Now Sektor says 15 cciv might breakRR the Real Ryan will go with Sektor"
Should see 35 - 50 shr increase.
This will still open $480 - 500. That's just the way TSLA and NFLX roll. And probably will be $550-600 by Friday.
"If you are selling NFLX due to old kangaroo called DIS entering the show then you are short sighted. Online video streaming is accelerating and I can tell you for every industry there is always number one and others. Nobody will cancel NFLX to have Disney, families will have it as an add on for the kids and that’s about it."
"Today Nasdaq up, Netflix down, dead money since june 2020. 0%, ahahah."
Q1 is notoriously slower. Rocked every other metric. No concerns
With in next week $600 least
Im new to options.I purchased NFLX call spreadCall Buy 227 and call sell 237. Feb.Was playing safe.Are these call spread orders connected?Is it possible to close only the sell and go long with the buy?Is it possible to book some profit or do I need to wait till Friday expiration date.
glad I bought nsome more yesterday
"fundamentalsUS subscriptions fell when they raised rateshow can they keep rates at this level or raise them with Apple and Disney and YouTube and Hulu and all the others and individual networks like Bloomberg and CBS streaming their content?Can'tso, besides market manipulation what took it up to where it is?PE's belowDIS 17.7Amzn 76Apple 18.6the others are relatively low as welllook at the total liabilities for last quartercash flow burn is what they called it on Bloomberg"
"I an not a NFLX investor but i really wanted to say that this is BS,What is WS wanting? That NFLX now subscribe death people or disenroll existing customer to have them subscribe again? People are a finite source and they have a finite amount of accounts, DAs"
sold this junk a while back and cancelled my subscription then they wanted me to come back for half price but you couldn’t pay me to watch the trash they create. yep most people really have valueless values.

"$NFLX $WIMI $BABA Buy low and sell high through the market swings, and with a little patience, you'll have plenty of people coming to hand you money."
Bye bye shorts. Z
Market hoping NFLX earnings will reverse the market correction. God help us all.
Never underestimate peoples’ willingness to pay for TV. I remember my dad complaining about his $15 cable bill after another price increase. 20 years later I downgraded my cable from $150/mon to $100/mon 3 weeks after getting a Netflix subscription. Media entertainment has always been high up on the list of most profitable industries.
yahoo said shares were surging ah?
"Why would there EVER be more subscribers during the April-July quarter? Who buys a Netflix subscription so they can sit at home all summer? With that being said, buying opp right here."
"I just thoroughly reviewed their last quarter and it's worse than I thought. Liquid cash is about 3.3B and liabilities are 21B. Note that doesnt count off balance sheet items. Net operating income only increased 2.8% over prior year. There is a 141M net addition in the interest and other income line vs prior year first quarter. That's a non recurring event and cant be looked at in valuation. If they earn $3 a share in 2019 that's a 120 PE. Couple that with very moderate Operating income, leveraged balance sheet and increased competition, this stock could, and should, take a material hit. Do your own DD, but the results just dont justify this 158B valuation!! Wow."
"“Apptopia said Disney+ competitors, including Netflix and Amazon.com Inc's Prime Video, remain largely unaffected in terms of their performance during the same period”"
Did HULU crush them too.We already knew HBO MAX did.
Longs- We take some off the table tomorrow and lock in gains
NFLX will reach $ 360 by the close today!!!!
"Do any of you longs actually believe this trading? NASDQ hitting all time highs and nflx trading 25% below its high. Zero volume and zero buying even on up days. Stock in a clear downtrend, competition coming hot and heavy with deep pockets and oodles of content-and somehow this stock hovers with no buying just above an air pocket down.They are slowly distributing this stock and trading weekly to weekly Options to augment the return. your only friend is the time still left until the air goes out and they are gone and so are the option Boys."
Hi. Overpriced. Bye.
nflx was at $138.66 low this year. Now it is $315. This is roughly a increase in value or price of $180 or 150% in one year or 5 years. Can anyone complain about this appreciation in shareholder wealth?
"YouTube to scale back it's production of scripted content starting in 2020 as it struggles to find top talent - Hollywood Reporter. For sure Google has the money to hire top talent but they face the same dilemma as other streaming services, how do you add subscribers to cover the cost of talent when they are heading over to Netflix at a clip of 30+ million a year."
Not enough quality programming. I haven't liked a single Netflix Original
There IS NO CONTROLLED selling going on folks... No crash coming... No sell off coming... NFLX is one of the top 3 most widely held securities in 100's of millions of peoples 401k's... Everyone just chill!

"based on a comparison of the PE's with Disney for example20/105 * 334 = $64 per sharethe forward PE may not be taking into consideration the increase in cost of the content or the competition and bing watching and canceling, which could result in a 15% drop in US subscribers overall"
is it worth it to lose $13 for every cancellation? you need 13 subs raised by $1 to equal a single cancel. remember that
"Nothing would surprise me with this stock. If you told me it would be $350 by end of the week, I would believe you. Once it has gone into the stratosphere, anything is possible. You are no longer tethered to metrics like PE, PEG ratio, multiple of book value, discounted cash flow, etc etc. It's just whatever the next guy will pay, and it's a self-reinforcing process that can spin up for quite a while. Of course, eventually something happens to stop the rocket, but that can take a while and could be at least $700 before anything like that happens. Enjoy the ride. I expect at least $10 every day from this."
"Dont panic sell if you actually believe in this company, we ride until the end together. No matter what happens...."
"last quarter Nflx missed expectation $1.65. This quarter expects $1.81. Nflx could not raise price, Nflx will not meet expectation again. The report will be similar with last quarter which is adding more subscribers but missing $1.81"
I'll be buying more today. love the steep discount.
"Still a good solid buy at this cost, Solid part of the FANG group, going back to the highs after all the drama FINALLY died down"
Only subscriber count matters today

Reed Hastings sold $300 million of NFLX stock in 2018. He did not buy any stock on the decline down to $230. He just sold more stock. Reed thanks you for a wonderful 2018 and wishes you a Happy New Year.
"I’ve been day trading for years and I’m so glad I finally found (http://Fairstox.com). They’re pre-market watchlists cover all the latest market-moving news, and they don’t beat you down with tons of ads. Highly recommend!"
"Hey Netflix longs, just curious what you want the company to do:1. Status quo (trust the company to keep expanding globally and regain subs based on brand, content, etc).2. Make a big acquisition to increase market share.3. Be acquired (very unlikely given market cap, but just want to get a feel for where some mindset is).Full disclosure: I’m long 7K shares of Viacom (but Netflix subscriber lol; and I did like Outer Banks and Dead to Me; hope to see more seasons); I like where VIAC is headed, but I also have a bitter taste in my mouth from the margin call crash (even though I’m still up and buying at $38-$39). If someone wants to take us out for what it was pre-crash, I certainly won’t mind."
Love reading the comment section with all the millennial Robinhood day trader kids posting their knowledge here. . I’m an old guy who’s seen it all and it makes me giggle.
You all going to wish you bought yesterday when it was low. 10% up today. Green Day. Positive into the end of the year
"A Quarter in the Life (of Netflix)The countdown begins, the excitement and anx (for those with a position) builds until both numbers are in view, subscriber adds and guidance for next Q subscriber adds. Then in a flash the stock moves, up as much as 40% (Q4 ER 2012) or down as much as 25% (Q2 ER 2014). The next day the excitement fades and once again all the longtime Netflix skeptics emerge to talk about PE, FCF, and debt until the countdown to the next ER begins."
P.S. I seriously believe NFLX goes to $1000
The moment of truth
Still here and still believe that $500-$550 is fair value! Market dumping will be short living :)
"Who all are not getting sleep tonight,please raise your hand."
"plz, go above 380"
"Goldman Sachs argument to justify higher price makes no sense. Netflix will be paying more due to higher interest rates, they will be spending more as they add more debt to create their own content and as they pay more for licensing others' content and they will be losing Disney content. I don't see how this is a good proposition for higher valuation let alone justify yesterday's."
Guys plz don't short it!!! Let it rise
No Netflix is not facing competition overseas. Yes Netflix is winning original content award. Yes people know it. Yes people want entertainment. No people don’t mind 10$ a month. No none of the above is a factor in the stock market. Yes this is fall is market wide. Buy and forget
"BTW I bought this when shares were going for $95, so I'm doing just fine."
NFLX...keep rising and shining like the brilliant company you are...I'm a believer!
6% down is nothing for this stock. 195+mm subscribers. It will shake it off as it always does.
How high NFLX can go?My best guess is 325-350 range near term long term may be 490
"There you have it , the world biggest media stock. Congrats to longs "
Subscriber growth will exceed 10 million. Company guidance was ultra cautious and it set an extremely low bar that will be handily exceeded
What a come back!!!!!
"Netflix is expanding its footprint in New Mexico, announcing Monday that it is expanding ABQ Studios and pledging an additional $1 billion in production spending there."
Start of a bull run perhaps?
Big down day for NFLX !!
Why would you buy Netflix if you could just own Disney. Just curious because I believe Disney will likely have similar returns from its streaming business and the company has significantly more value behind it and a deeper most. Would appreciate any answer just curious.
"Lot of people says dot com and this rally is different. I agree with them. Back in Dot-com rally was broad cover lot of different companies in bubble territory. This rally focus on few hot names. Now is that good or bad. Very hard to tell but here is my thought.Because people only invest in hot names, Money concentrated into top 50 company in this market mainly. Now let's say $AMZN or $NFLX or $TSLA suddenly find hard to handle. With limited balance sheet they will have hard time meeting obligation and stock can crash big time. If one of such company fail, fear to exit will run. Given most invested in 50 company, Those all exiting into same names as well and what will happen when everyone thinking to exit same time?"
Is there still some loft left in NFLX hot air balloon?
Definitely thought Disney earnings would make this tank
"I like Netflix and Roku and $WIMI, they always do well, more and more people are using their products."
going to 500 after earnings
Disney + isn't a rival-it's just another streaming service. Most households will have both netflix and disney +.
"I wonder if Disney will stream anything rated higher this PG. I love their family/kid focus. I see people adding it, but most will keep their Netflix"
400 End of week. Those numbers are not good
Thanks for playing option buyers. No movement at all this week. Maybe next week after earnings. Of course everyone's expecting a huge swing but I wouldn't be surprised if it only moved 4 to 5%.
don't worry it's headed for 250 just after the split
why would they announce a price increase right before earnings? maybe to soften the miss ?
Selling 1st thing in the am. Then will buy back after it drops into the 230 Range

"Market is oversold today: $VIX fear index is hype overbought, looking for entry today!"
"Netflix guided very conservative. That is what caused this to just fizzle out, after a 10%+ rise after hours. So, really... the fun might begin next earnings release. IMO the users gained will have a snowball effect. More people talking about shows, more people in on the pop culture, more traction more stick less churn. Overall, this pandemic has drastically changed the dynamics and sped up the shift to cut cables. A fun year to be long in Netflix."

word on street is nflx will beat street estimate by 50 cents a shr.
"ROKU BEAT EARNINGS WHICH MEANS NFLX WILL POP TOMRROW THATS FOR SURE , KNOW YOUR FACTS"
Red
I am unsubscribing now.
"People on this board are greedy. NFLX is up 20% on the month. The gains are in. Despite what is likely to be a beat, stock is not ""rocketing"" to $500. May even go down. Increased subs does not address the longer term challenges of increasing competition and capital structure issues. Increased competition may not take subscribers away from NFLX, but it will make it harder to raise subscription prices, and it commits NFLX to massive debt funded content spending. A rise in interest rates will cut the current stock price in half. At these prices the downside risk is getting larger than the upside potential."
Hold steady guys. stay focused please
"Buying the dip tomorrow morning....big overreaction...everybody knew subscriber growth would slow, this miss doesn't surprise me in the least. It's the same old story...every quarter comes down to subscriber numbers..sometimes they beat, sometimes they miss..without fail during the misses this stock goes down massively, only to recover and make new highs. The shorts' cries of this time is different fall on deaf ears when it comes to me."
It was obvious - Netflix is losing market share as more people are signing up Disney+.Simply watch your children - they are watching Disney+ not Netflix.
"The content on Netflix is dreadful. With the exception of Narcos and Ozarks, the content is extremely poor. The company is just a vehicle for transferring billions from shareholders' pockets to the bank accounts of Hollywood/NYC producers, celebrities, actors, writers, production assistants, movie/TV crews, and everyone in the entertainment food chain. Colossal waste of money on original content with no financial returns whatsoever."
I have an open ended limit buy order for NFLX at 300 as an initial investmentFingers crossed !
what a drop. Just like the Q3
Netflix is buying CBS/Viacom for $66+ in Netflix stock and a $7 cash coupon. Netflix will double its yearly revenue of 25 billion upon acquisition and have 76 years of Movie and tv content and the CBS Network.
Lets all hope china and trump stay quiet for the rest of april lol.
This company is on track to lose four billion dollars this year and people wonder why the stock is not going up
"Amazing that this can tack on $13 billion of extra market cap on a sub beat of only 900k. Means every extra sub beyond forecast was worth about $14,000!"
In buy territory. Hmm... Might try buying some today.
i really like what i am hearing
I don’t understand the 3% rise. I seriously don’t..
Might be a great opportunity to add on overreaction. Nflx and amazon are going to do great after covid.

NFLX Is TOTING A LOT OF:TIMMMMMMMMBERRRRR !
410 easy today. and up before earning
290 by Friday.
Great buying opportunity. Optimism always prevails.
This is not the point where you should be shorting this one. It has a long history of trading like this for a few days and then wham it goes back into high gear. I had been watching this stock since its inception. Wish I had bought it back then. It used to be 50 ten years ago prior to many splits. Even three years ago it was pretty low and one time I bought it and it just kept going down. When it went down from 330 to 305 I got out (it was before 1:3 split in 2013). And here we go.
Heading for -0-.
getting close to green let's do this!
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mark-cuban-says-data-oil-190815814.html
This is worth at least $345
I just lost my entire life’s savings on calls
Competition is not necessarily a bad thing and the strong  will survive imo. NFLX is globally the king of streaming with an enormous library. I think the others will have a lot of catch-up.
Moon Bound
This was the easier bet to make. I should have shorted more shares. There was no was this was going up with the tape on the Nasdaq lately. But there are no guarantees so I’m happy with the trade.
Netflix is priced at a premium to other offerings and investors are concerned that this will inhibit growth as lower costs services gain market share. Netflix needs to ensure it continues to produce quality content to remain a streaming necessity.
Bulls always fall for bull traps. That’s why cows often get eaten by bears 
This clown market surprises me all the time). Netflix on the best report in the history of the company -12% .. Disney on a bad record only -3.6% .. this is crazy house ... LOL
"I am currently long NFLX but there will be a cap, there is only so many people that live in this world with access to internet."
"Has nice bear cover into this stock.Just wondering how long to hold it. 280 seems to happen easily, but I see also 266 lurking. Around that price we may see a slight comeback. But basically 2020 will be mostly bad news for Netflix due rising competition."
Long and strong!
"22 millon, lots of buying. Smart money buying. Netflix lead, like Tesla's is only increasing during the epidemic."
They regain momentum!! They can touch their highs very soon and maybe before next earnings
Heading to 361 after 30mins...
"On DIS balance sheet find where they value ""content,"" then compare it with NFLX ""content."" DIS has prixar, disney children's movies, stat wars, marvel, lions gate?, etc. Whose ""content' looks overvalued? This ""content"" cost is amortized over time and makes up nflx's largest expense. So by slow walking the amortization you make the company look more profitable. What does nflx have in content that would total $9B in value?"
"Suddenly looking vulnerable. This stock is definitely a panic meter, because obviously quarantine will increase Netflix use."
"Global growth company.#1 Streaming company in China.Interactive video pioneer.So many revenue streams unlike $NFLX. $ROKU holders may be interested also.- 100M+ Paid subscribers- 400M+ Ad supported- gaming with Skymoons- IQiyi Sports- Content distribution- Settop box- 37,000 video screens In Shanghai subway stations- Streaming deal with New Zealand Airline- VR movie deal with hotels- Membership deal with JD.com- VIP deal with Ctrip.com- Licensing deal with Netflix- Licensing deal with Nickelodeon"
Things go in and out of style all the time. Just like $NFLX.
Subscribers fleeing Netflix for less liberal programming!
"If after earning this go 400+ I will start shorting again for sure. Today I sold 345 calls expiring today just for premium. I am 99% certain it not going there just based on bogus analyst reports. Entire 2018 all they done is inflate and result their master make huge amount of money manipulating stock price based on report and retail who jump after seeing excitement, most lost lot of money. They going to keep repeating until retail get smarter and they can't benefit. I think this time retail going to smarter than last year and not going to get trap on every raising price promise."
The suspense waiting for NFLX earnings is better than anything on NFLX.
I've bought and sold Netflix for years; still have some shares at $29. Now this stock moves like a spinning top and it's liable to go in any direction on good or bad earnings.
"If NFLX Adds 3 to 5 dollars today, I am keeping the faith"
Why aren't any of you mentioning the subscriber growth rate? Nearly 9M new subscribers last quarter! That's HUGE!
The little guy investor doesn't stand a chance.
"I cancelled NetflixThere is no cost to cancel. You can always start it back up in the future. That's what will happen, but revenue and earnings will drop because of itWSJ survey30% of netflix users will cancel to try the new streaming companiesweekend paper, check page 1 (or B1) and B6"
"Every other streaming platform will run out of steam subsidizing their small number of shows, and the monster Netflix will be a winner as usual. 350 inevitable so watch u after earnings shorties. We will see u cry like babies soon on the other side. Netflix rocks. This price action is a blip and a must buy opportunity"
"Arora Report showing ""Positive Momentum"" & ""Positive Squeeze"" rankings. Next week should be good. GLTA"
Anyone taking profits? Like this start but the run up has been too incredible. IMO
So strong let’s goooo
123 very high PE
275 soon enough Keep shorting
"“It would be super helpful if Netflix was willing to sell itself” Needham analyst. Why in the world would the dominate leader in the next wave of TV ever want to sell. I get why Time Warner and Fox were willing to sell, because they saw no chance competing with Netflix."
"You can not believe it there are over 5000 people in Cebug school district, 10,000 students in Taiwan, 85,000 students in Shanghai, and 65,000 students in Vietnam want to subscribe Netflex after they hear Barack is signing up series!Barack is a giant figure! Think about it! So many Thai in Thailand also want to subscribe Netflex after they hear Barack series...Netflex CEO is correct. He needs to thank for Barack's signing up for Netflex series!"
Nflx floats $2B in bonds while dis rakes in $1.2B from Avengers. How's that for content?
Everyone that’s bearish clearly has puts. Sorry to break it to you but this baby is strong and only going one way from here
"so i am doing a stock market game in which i must make the most profits from stocks with a starting money of 100,000 and i only have 2 months to drastically make more from stocks, i think i will invest in Netflix tomorrow morning since their price is at a low and the new hubie halloween movie will be coming out October 7, is this a good idea?"
Pls see the whole perspective!! Netflix has gained market across the globe and have great plans. I have not watched cuties but I certainly keep a check on what my kids see and In fact they have a separate kids profile. I reckon Netflix has great projections.
Drops like a rock despite being more popular in the UK. Even families that have no money to go on vacation due to the market crash are likely to keep their Netflix subscription than even cable...
Which company Netflix can acquire for there future growth?
Netflix needs a Breaking Bad or Game of Thrones content play which will draw in a lot more domestic subs. Its all about content for growth
440 after ER.
Party to be continue tomorrow
Netflix has great movies. subscribers will sign up soon when they are tired of kid movies
This stock never recovered from the hiring of Barack Obama back in 2017.
Shorties are sweating it now with this upward pressure.
if it falls I'm buying more. honestly I think it will beat expectations.
"Liquidity has left the market, shares are not bought at all. In the next 3 months, Netflix has absolutely no growth potential. Maybe only by the end of autumn there will be an influx of subscribers, when they will finally be able to release new seasons of their most popular TV series The Witcher and Stranger Things."
$495 soon
"Earnings run coming this week, might hit 440!"
"Happy to say my Netflix investment is up 906%. Third biggest holding now. Basic method of buy and hold, buy on the dips. it's that simple. I would not let Rice, Obamas or anything else stand in the way of my continuing to invest in this generational stock. Highly recommend."
"Neumann: Netflix would've been cash-flow positive in Q1 even without COVID-19's impact on subscriber growth. For the rest of 2020, the push-out of some content spend will boost FCF. But only ""a small minority"" of content spend is being pushed out.Reiterates that 2019 will still be Netflix's ""maximum negative year"" for FCF"
Nflx too far too fast.. funds need a chance to buy more. IMHO will pullback 75 points
IM NOT COVERING they sold their share holders out could of announced price hike at earnings insider sold 900k worth of shares 2 days ago!!!! look it up!!
This will fly today i never believe analysts........Netflix too strong jump in folks today will shine like the sun in the sky
BOUGHT CHEAP going up as posted
Do you think this will continue going into the week
NFLX is downgraded this morning to sell from buy...
"Looks like some flies got caught in the spider""s web."

"So as inflation and more importantly interest rates go up, how does that impact Netflix earnings. Interest on debt is a huge % of their expenses, so rising interest rates would seriously hamper their profit growth expectations.Not a shorter, just sharing my thoughts...."
$ZM $WIMI $NFLX There's a lot of potential! Buy it when it's falling
"Here is reason stock raise $10 for nearly flat market.After revisiting expectations for Netflix Inc.'s (NFLX) international subscriber growth, Pivotal Research analyst Jeffrey Wlodarczak upped his 12-month price target to $400 from $300. Shares of Netflix, after hitting a record close on Monday, were up more than 1% in early Tuesday trade. Wlodarczak increased his long-term international subscriber forecast, expecting the streaming giant to hit 250 million international subscribers by 2024, up from 230 million. In its most recent fourth-quarter earnings report, Netflix said it had 62.8 million international subscribers. ""The company appears to operate in a virtuous cycle, as the larger their subscriber base grows the more they can spend on original content, which increases the potential target market for their service and dramatically increases barriers to entry,"" Wlodarczak wrote in a note. ""All else being equal with the broader markets, as long as Netflix continues to beat and raise on subscribers we believe the stock will continue to work."" Wlodarczak also raised his long-term expectations on average revenue per user as Netflix displayed pricing power after its most recent price hike had little to no negative impact on subscriber growth. Shares of Netflix have gained 122% in the last 12 months, while the S&P 500 index is up roughly 15%.Here are red flags on his analysis:-This analyst see 250Million subscriber suddenly jump from already increase 230 Million count for no reason. Now from 67M to 250 Milion in 6 year, each year they need to add 30M+ subscriber. Now looking into US short history, This is unlikely. Remember Most english speaking developed Foreign country reaching saturation point. Non English speaking, There isn't much content and with licensing cost increases and focus on own content that gap will get wider not smaller.Now Value:- Clearly reaching 250M mean not much growth left. And then company likely issue $30B+ stocks over 6 year period. at current price that mean it will value at $160B + likely $20B debt so $180B enterprise value.with 250M international you will have 320M total (70M is beyond peak I think but just get over optimistic) $10M = $36B revenue, They likely spending $20B on content (Only way they can reach 320M subscriber is spend lot more on content) , $5B on marketing , $5B on servers and $2b-3B on other = $33BIn other word still generate $3B profit. Even if we raise subscription by 20% it still likely <$10B profit in 2024..If you give 20 PE and discount 35% (Growth rate), You still comeup with <$150 fair market price."
NFLX is going to be a leader in the online TV/film content game for a long time. Bank on it.
"A word of advice to the more naive people who come to these boards for advice on how to spend your money. There were many people here the day before earnings saying you absolutely HAVE HAVE HAVE to invest in NFLX because it was going to sky rocket after earnings to 500's. I remember seeing people here advising others to either hold or buy in because 430's was a 'bargain' lol. The lesson that needs to be learnt out of this is, nobody here knows what the hell they are talking about, so do not ask strangers on a forum for advice on how to spend your money"
73.3 million international and 57.9 million domestic subscribers bringing its total to 131.2 millions. 
So quiet this morning. I bet the shorts are busy covering :-)
Green $500 tomorrow
The laws of competing strategy provide that Netflix will get competed away. Their disruptive business model will be the sword upon which they fall. Company will be find. Stock not so much.
Excellent!
Shorts panic and covering now...... Yay...
"CNBC talking heads like it. Whats not to like: subs up, revenue basically hits Q4 and Q1 targets, and costs plateauing this year. For a growth stock this is what matters. EPS lower because of investment costs, but thats not why you buy Netflix anyway, thats why you buy IBM. Plus they Its going higher."

"Bought as much as i could today, so sweet !"
starting with next earnings release Netflix will just crush to 150-200$ within 3 monthsThe competition will hurt them significantly while they need to invest more and even create more debt. Netflix will just survive the next 12-24 months alont before they need to be bought by Apple or Disney to integrate their content into the big boys streaming platforms
"Assuming Netflix makes a whopping $10 per share in earnings when it reaches its growth plateau in 5 years and at that time trades at a PE which is close to that of Apple's PE which is at 19. Then it will be only worth $190 per share. So, I ask myself, do I buy a stock at $330 today when it will be worth $190 in 5 years, or do I short it at $330 and buy it back at $190?? Invest wisely, not emotionally..."
"Netflix reports first-quarter earnings on Tuesday after the close of trading. Analysts expect earnings of $2.97 per share, up 89% from last year, on revenue of $7.13 billion, up 24%."

"NFLX earning better be really good on Monday. If not, this could hit 350 or lower fast."
"Good luck tomorrow Netflix price target raised to $440 at RBC Capital MarketsMARKETWATCH — 09/06/2018 3:01 PM ETAnalysts at RBC Capital Markets raised their price target for Netflix (NFLX.NaE) to $440 from $360 on Thursday, citing survey results showing high satisfaction and an increase in usage among U.S. and U.K. consumers. In a survey of over 1,500 U.S. consumers, 57% of respondents said they used Netflix (NFLX.NaE), up from 55% in May 2018 and 53% in September 2017. The survey also showed that 68% of Netflix (NFLX.NaE) subscribers were ""extremely"" or ""very satisfied"" with their experience. A hefty 84% percent of subscribers said they were ""not at all likely"" or ""slightly likely"" to cancel in the next three months, though that figure was below the 87% average of the last five quarters. In the U.K., 56% of respondents said they used Netflix (NFLX.NaE), up from 49% last year. Eight percent of subscribers in the U.K. said they were ""extremely"" or ""very"" satisfied with the service, and churn levels in the U.K. were at a record low; a record 71% said they were ""not at all"" or ""slightly likely"" to cancel in the next 3 months. ""We believe that Netflix (NFLX.NaE) has achieved a level of sustainable scale, growth, and profitability that isn't currently reflected in its stock price,"" wrote RBC analysts, led by Mark Mahaney, in a note to investors. He said he also sees potential in Netflix's (NFLX.NaE) push into India. ""India could well be a source of millions of new Netflix (NFLX.NaE) subscribers over the next few years,"" he wrote, ""but the company has a lot of work to do."" An RBC review of local Indian news sources suggested Netflix (NFLX.NaE) was off to a good start; its original series ""Sacred Games"" has become highly popular in the region. Mahaney also reiterated the company's outperform rating. Netflix (NFLX.NaE) shares have gained 80% so far this year, while the S&P 500 has gained 7.6%."
"I sold to early, but I was thinking that they missed earnings and was down by 10+ cents from last year... Oh well!"

"Netflix Inc.'s stock price target was cut to $458 from $463 by analyst David Miller at Imperial Capital, after the streaming video giant tapped the junk-bond market for the ninth time in six years. Meanwhile, Miller reiterated his bullish outperform rating, saying Netflix has a history of using the bond market effectively. The stock rose 0.9% in morning trade. Earlier this week, Netflix said it was offering $2 billion worth of U.S. and euro denominated debt, which Moody's rated at Ba3, which was three notches below the investment-grade rating threshold. As Miller said, the U.S. portion of the issuance will launch at 5.375% and the euro portion will launch at 3.875%, for a blended rate of 4.475%. In comparison, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 4.20% during the April 25 week. Miller said that Netflix has showed that tapping the debt markets has resulted in ""clear-cut, tangible, global subscriber growth and retention,"" as he assumes the proceeds from the latest debt issuance will go toward content acquisition, mostly on the self-produced side. The stock has climbed 18.4% over the past 12 months while the S&P 500 has gained 9.8%."

"When Netflix spends $100 million on a movie, you break that down to 190 countries, they only need to sign up 35,000 to 40,000 subscriber per country to pay for that movie. The math is incredible!"
I’m an old guy. Likes holding and dividends. Just from watching this thread I’m feeling so disappointed with the youth and greedy buy/ sell. Now they say day traders.
What just happened? Why the sharp drop right at the close?
Goldman Sachs lead tech analyst just stated on CNBC that NFLX will have BIG earnings and that it will continue for the next qtr (as what's happening for NFLX is like stacking 3 major holiday seasons together with people staying home)!!
"$PDD $WIMI $NFLX Successful value investing and successful short - term speculative trading are difficult problems at two extremes in the investment field. Blindly belittling speculative trading, or blindly worshiping long-term values, are cognitive deviations."
This recovery just goes to show the strength of this stock.
This is just a distraction to get bears excited on Monday for earnings but in reality Netflix will surge 400+
"Real price of Netflix -$50, SQ-$10, amazon $600, nvda-$60. Buying at current prices is not common sense, it’s greed"
Just option play every Friday. Turn it off on Friday and get back on Monday. Options have made the market less fun on Fridays (even weekly options affect stock now). MM don;t like to loose.
"HA! look at this:""The company also said that net income in the quarter included a $171 million noncash unrealized gain from a foreign exchange “remeasurement on our Euro-denominated debt”—which accounted for a significant part of the earnings beat."""

"As more online streaming available. It's no brainer People will use Online streaming and take internet from Cable or who ever provide.Reason is simple. Main advantage is on demand nature without worrying about DVR, Timing and many other thing. Only live stream, Cable make sense. (Cable likely go that route as Internet still yet to figure out pipe size issue but getting closer. Live streaming is reality but still behind by min or two compare to Cable).Subscriber also like to see all different content and use multiple streaming.Now biggest question is:- What keep those subscriber subscribe year round same service:-I find no reason to subscriber year round right now. Month or two more than enough to see all new content I like to see in 1 year.With Online, you can cancel anytime and subscribe again.Very soon people will figureout and stop keeping year round. This going cause limit on how many subscriber you can have.given how quickly $NFLX marketing budget going up per new Subscriber, this might happen already. Netflix able to find new subscriber to replace those and still able to show growth but coming at increasingly more cost. When Netflix realize it's not financially sustain it will stop spending more on marketing."

"Mark Cuban a large NFLX shareholder supposedly must tell the world why hepromotes private green companies like Regent Craft and GroupHug Solar while simultaneously promoting the worlds worst carbon emitters indirectly which are crypto mining companies.

"P/E > 240, NFLX will go down sharply by the end of this week when the options will be expired by this Friday. It is an easy money to sell short at current price"
What should I do ? Sell before earning or keep until earning . Nobody knows what will happen with the earning

NFLX has been holding up surprisingly well at $500 post ER.
"When will NFLX's debt be exposed like GE's debt?Netflix’s long-term debt was $12.4 billion at the end of the third quarter.Add the latest $2.2 billion, and it now stands at $14.6 billion!And that $2.2 billion didn't come cheap, when you consider the interest rates in Europe are basically at ZERO; the euro portion priced at 3.625% and the US dollar portion at 4.875% (a full percentage point higher than a 30-year mortgage).The company’s cash reserve was $4.4 billion at the end of the third quarter.The amount was lower than the company’s cash reserve of $5.0 billion at the end of the second quarter.Why the BILLIONS in annual cash burn? Just factor in Netflix’s content costs ... more than $12 billion in 2018, a huge increase from $8.9 billion in 2017.And what physical assets does NFLX own? How are they going to pay off all of this increasing debt?The subscriber numbers are nowhere near sufficient enough to support NFLX's spending spree.And Netflix even acknowledged that the coming slew of competition may hurt new-subscriber growth.So ... you want me to BUY shares of NFLX with a PE ratio of 87?WHY????"

Earnings 
Today was a short squeeze engineered by Fidelity which raised margin requirements on Netflix from 35% to 40%.
Sentiment is close to a bottom. Won’t be surprised to see over 600 tonight and then 1000 by year’s end.
To the moon very soon 
Nowadays if you say something negative about any stock you are automatically a “short seller” or “doesn’t know anything or doesn’t own the shares” I was holding Netflix I got in when they were trading at $100 levels and my stop loss triggered after hours and it was sold for $538. Netflix is done due to a peak subscription and competitive platform and cheaper! This was the worst numbers and the worst guidance that have ever reported! You are either too blind to see it or you bought the hype over $500 and now you will hold the bag! Once we are fully open the economy Netflix will be $300-$400 stock if you are lucky !

OF COURSE NOT."

Look for Netflix to zoom past 423 its all time sooner than later, on its way to 500 this year."
I have a great feeling about today!!!!!
"It's not going down because of shorts.It's massively over-valued. It's still priced as if it lives in a world dominated by it, which increasingly doesn't exist, and will be going going GONE in the next year or so.

"Everyone think Netflix susbcription will raise as they make more netflix orignal and so their lead increase.Simple question:-How many total Episode on Netflix Orignal Drama they produced in last 5 years:- Answer will surprise you. It's only 400. (There are B Grade Movies and Commedy shows and Marvel Orignal exclusive (Likely pulled out in 2019) l which I am not counting).In other word, if I start watNow how many shows Disney already have:- Probably 4000+. How much content Disney/Fox will generate $15B orignal.Disney also have 1000's movies. So if you have to choose between Disney or Netflix service which one will you go with? I think answer is very obvious.Netflix will continue license external content but that also mean it limit it's own and number above may not improve much.2019 coming fast and smart likely going to run before that. All this analyst pumping may be way to exit without stock price crash."
India number 2 million new subscribers to date
Netflix will always be the king in the jungle
"So I guess the Netflix exclusive Child Exploitation film, ""Cuties"", was not a subscription motivator? Or paying Obama and Prince Harry Millions was not a subscription boost as well? Maybe when Lrince Harry releases a film called, ""Meghan Merkel made me hate my racist family"", that will increase subscriber growth?"

India is going to be great numbers. I'm more wondering about the rest of the numbers
If nothing else they will have to run out of buyers eventually LOL

"Look at the big run up before the last earnings announcement. With next earnings coming in mid July, we should start to see a gradual increase now with higher demand (increase in price) as we get closer to earnings. No one thinks demand for Nextflix has done down since the last quarter so investors (retail and institutional) will buy leading up to earnings. I don't think $500 leading up to earnings is out of the question."
if it was going to 360 it would be half the way there. obviously being bought. up ..500 by labor day
Netflix is the king of streaming. Yes the stock is lower right now. But it will be back to 350$ soon. Disney or apple will have no effect on Netflix.
Nah the buying starts again soon. It’s going to move up again stay tuned
REALLY need an earnings beat!
"I've done extensive analysis on this. Pie charts, line charts, astrology charts, tea leaves, Ouija board. What they tell me is that Netflix will make a run at $600 in March. I'm looking at $590-$600 and possibly even $610-$620. Then it'll pull back to under $600 again before the ER in April."

Like a vegan diet or Obama's election. A burst of euphoria followed by an endless decline.
Netflix had a blockbuster quarter for new content releases. We should see a spike in cord cutting when cable companies report in January.
Can someone wake me up when this thing is over 400. Cheergirls said it was worth over 600 but it just keep going down. So from Jan to Jun it is up only 10% while other stocks are up like 100%. But I am sure cheergirls are right. But then I see reports that a saturation level has reached in terms of new customers.
$BABA $WIMI $NFLX Buying cheap is the best way to invest. Always stay where there are fewer people
Next stop 250.00 wayyyy over valued
F it. I'm keeping my long term long position for another 5 years and shorting with house money under 319. I wish I knew how to do options.
Cramer mentioned the subs tonight and the overseas growth positively.
When you’re priced for perfection........
Just what the doctor wanted. Rest and Netflix boom
told you $210 by Friday!
It’s Looking to make 370.00 today. Today she will rise.
Bounce time?NFLX may steal the show today.
I think a rumored takeover by Apple is driving this stock higher every day. I really do.
time to sell and good luck holding
My value is not more than $350 !!
"I truly believed big investment companies are paying these analysts to upgrade or downgrade a stock. In this case, NFLX is being downgraded 2 days before earnings so they can buy in for cheap to make a quick cash."
"Largest Bubble Stock in the History of the World trading at $2,200 Pre-Split with massive Debt and a Spending Binge."
Forward PE 46. This is low for the large growth Netflix will have.
"417 - when Shorts capitulate Yes, its worth $125 but in this bubble with endless price target increases anything is possible.Have Fun"
Even if it had 300million subscribers that would only be just 3 billion revenue a month... price just doesn’t make sense
And to think this was 140 at one time last year I guess we wait till next year
Buyback will not last forever- 250 soon
"The earning dosen´t matter I think 480, 2 weeks after earning. so get out of shorts onely drop of moore then 40 usd in one trading day will chance direction."
"shorts know this is going to fly next monday tuesday wednesday Thursday Friday, 400 ."
"By history and quarterly trends, NFLX has always increased stock price after a good earning. Believe me!"
"nflx beat expectations both top and bottom line, but no mention of that"
Disney will take another 8 months to have some effects on Netflix. Disney has more cash to support expansions. Netflix will have more debt to expand
It's really scary shorting this stock :(
"I’ve been day trading for years and I’m so glad I finally found (http://Thetraderguide.com). They’re pre-market watchlists cover all the latest market-moving news, and they don’t beat you down with tons of ads. Highly recommend!"
It is a 600$ stock
"If nflx beats, shouldn’t ubs and the reset of analysts that were mistaken be investigated?"
Why pay NFLX while Amazon Prime give you all for FREE?
I added more Netflix.
Anyone concern about rising debt load versus cash flows? Seems it has a large dependency on debt.
I just lost my cookies
"A legit analysts would want to post their price target on a stock with as much information as possible. There is no reason to be posting right **before** earnigns announcement unless you want to pump-and-dump.Also, before cheering the subscriber beat, you might want to ak yourself how a company can beat on customer numbers and then still miss their revenue target. Imagine if a car dealer sold more cars than they thought they would and had less profit AND less revenue to show for it. NFLX is using the MoviePass business model: good for custoemrs, bad for stock holders. This emperor has no clothes"
I think we'll see $405 in the after hours.
OUCH
Below 500 by Friday
When you sell a covered call your giveaway is the strike price you sell the covered call + premium ( $100).I think the Jan 20 $400 calls sell for $65.Just google aapl options and look but make sure time frame and strike price is correct.The Nasdaq option chain is the easiest to read
So did the analysts tell you the truth when they upgraded on poor guidance?
Cramer says buy here290.0-300.00
"When a company consistently put customer first consistently of long periods of time. Those companies enjoy unparallel customer loyalty. You see this in companies like Costco, Netflix, Amazon."
EPS missed ? Oh no.Users / Views doubled ? Oh yes.Covid-19 helped Netflix. But what if that gets resolved?
Netflix has corrected more in the past. It will recover.
this stock will double within 12 months - easy - This part of the FANG is back - probaly 650 to 700 by end of week - seen this so many times
EPS beat expectations by 50%. Revenue beat too. Why is this down? Subscribers will come.
"Going long, $1000 in a few years."
The...comeback...begins.
"New MUSIC Entertainment co...SNWR,,,,SANWIRE Corp.....UP 51 % TODAY....Small CAP with HUGE Future..??"
DISCOUNT BUYING ON THOSE AUGUST 21st CALLS AHEAD OF EARNINGS 
I'm betting that NFLX is likely to explode before tomorrow's close.
"honestly, who cares about guidance, just buy low and sell high..."
I need gains! Let’s go AH!
We need more diversity and women in our content. The industry is being valued on these metrics only. The acting and writing is irrelevant.

netflix you rebel you
Hello.. Need genuine advice. I bought 100 @390 for long-term investment. Since then it is just sinking. Should I sell or is there any chance it would go up? Thanks
Both NFLX and FB are two FANGS stocks that will bounce back to new high next month or so:
When after hours do we reach $600? THx.
It’s so promising that newbies are going to jump in tmr! Then we can start shoring from there! LOL
"I bought Netflix, it went down 17%. I bought Apple, it went down 8%. I sold. It went back up. I bought Comcast, it went down 18%. I sold. It went up. I bought att. It went down 18%. I bought Facebook, it went down 9%. I sold. It went up. I never made a profit. I’m going to reassess Netflix, see if I can salvage anything, if not in the next few months, then I will sell. Withdraw all my money and quit my failing streak. This is a big blow. It shows I know nothing."
We'll see what happens!!Market Chatter: Netflix Reportedly Targeting Big Budget Movies With $520 Mln Investment to Boost Subscriber BaseBY MT Newswires— 3:25 PM ET 07/29/2019
"Breaking: Netflix price target raised to $670 from $540 at Goldman SachsGoldman Sachs analyst Heath Terry raised the firm's price target on Netflix to $670 from $540 and reiterates a Conviction Buy rating on the shares. The stock closed Thursday up $4.98 to $507.76. The analyst expects Netflix to report Q2 results ""well above guidance"" with at least 12.5M net subscriber additions. Quarterly app downloads reached a record high and year-over-year downloads growth reached its highest level since Q1 of 2016 during the quarter, Terry tells investors in a pre-earnings research note. The analyst attributes this to content growth on the platform, a lack of competition for entertainment hours and spend driving churn lower, and more time being spent at home during COVID-19. Further, Terry believes consensus estimates for the second half of 2020 and beyond remain too low."
NFLX won’t drop below 310 tomorrow at market open...bank it..
"When FB dropped to $150, I panicked and sold...didn't do that with NFLX. Not making that mistake twice."
666 by end of year
Time to buy
making base for another push up
There is no comparison between Netflix and Disney.. nflx content is unbeatable and stock going up all green tomorrow..$290.
"Not sure why people talking so negative about nflx, its same nfkx which is always overvalued and still rising. People will forget and start investing again, so see you guys above 400 again in a month max."
"All good tech stocks go to $1000. GOOG, AAPL, AMZN, etc. NVDA and Tesla will join that club. Watch out for trash like $FB, $NFLX, and $PTON. Those have an unsustainable revenue stream."
NFLX is a time bomb right now. Huge expectations priced in. This has to beat expectations pretty hard for it to even retain current price levels. Longs who can't stomach the risk should consider puts or offloading before earnings.
"did you read Its on this site, belowIt's not making money, read it to seehttps://www.investopedia.com/insights/how-netflix-makes-money/?utm_campaign=quote-yahoo&utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=referral&yptr=yahoo"
Amazon to buy MGM
"In 2016 Amazon, Hulu, and HBO combined sank 10 billion into content in an attempt to cut into Netflix’s lead. The stock stalled trading well below its high of 133 for over a year. Today Netflix is 342, yearly revenue has doubled since then and they’ve increased the huge lead they have in streaming. It’s time to face the music, Netflix competition is weak and will remain so as long as Reed Hastings is in charge."
"So is the rotation over, out of hype (DIS), into real growth NFLX"
Buy the dip!!!! Stocks ONLY go up!!! Cramer said so! BUY BUY BUY!!!!!
to all u negative Nancy's out there. Moody's released a report saying Netflix will be cash positive by 2022 wit a projected 20 point margin. this stock will continue to go up it's still very young
Entire market was down today. Every day is not going to be green. Not worried at all. Full steam ahead to 500
"@Gregory Too many to name, my friend, with the same first name. I’m an actor and over the last 2 yrs there are 4x more Netflix auditions because of the shift out of Hollywood. Hollywood sells to China and 16 year olds in America now with superhero movies taking over. The good scripts don’t bring people to theaters any longer and so it pushes the action to Netflix who’s giving actors their own shows. Glad I bought in recently."
Netflix more stable than your bank :) ~500$ strong support

Might as well print 280 by 335
Back to the 400s on its way to 500
Looks like more upside soon as per the chart https://schrts.co/ijmxsUFJ
226 BILLION for what??still way OVERVALUED.
"Netflix maintained buy and $630 target, expected to report strong Q4 results, says CanaccordCanaccord analyst Maria Ripps expects Netflix to report strong Q4 results as the recent price hikes have enabled ongoing investments while the competitive landscape evolves. She believes estimates for the company could be conservative depending on the timing of billing increases and potential price hikes in other markets. Rips has a Buy rating and $630 price target on Netflix shares."
The bull case for Netflix is still intact. The road to international growth is still there. The $4.99 price point in India is not just for that country but for all 2nd tier countries. This price will propel Netflix to another 300 million subscriber around the world in the next 4 years
DIVING FAST!.
Don’t get scared buy more
Why down? Earnings leaks? Anyone?
They’re not buying enough stock
"shorts told me to sell at 95, 99, 120, 130, 140, 160, 170, 200, 220, 240, 250, 300 and 350increased position for the first time at 378. better late than never."
The market will do its best to separate you from your shares but if fails to do so and you pick the right stock you will do very well. Long term shareholders in Netflix have done very well.
"With the new change to how a “view” is counted, they will see 33% more in viewership. Textbook example of cooking the books."
Netflix is the leader in streaming. Lower prices are driving the growth in streaming which is still in the very early stages.
"Netflix price target raised to $670 from $600 at Goldman SachsGoldman Sachs analyst Heath Terry raised the firm's price target on Netflix to $670 from $600 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares ahead of the company's upcoming earnings report, telling investors that he expects the company to report Q3 results ""well above"" guidance and consensus expectations, including roughly 6M net subscriber additions. While management is likely to continue to guide conservatively, Terry thinks consensus estimates for Q4 and beyond remain too low given growth in content on the platform, a lack of competition for entertainment hours and spend, and more time being spent at home. Terry keeps Netflix on the firm's Conviction List as well."
Why this stock is going down? With strong subscriber growth? Yes Disney is coming with the streaming however it shouldn’t affect that much. Netflix is time to rise!!
"If Nasdaq goes back to green today, we are going to see 275 easily on this.."
Opens higher on Monday always ...way oversold...buy the dip!
I went to do some research on the Cuties controversy. It appears Netflix changed the Cuties promotional poster to the girls in dance uniforms vs. the original where it shows the girls happily walking along with shopping bags. But this is like scratching the surface when various scenes in the movie is pretty sexual especially for 11 yr old girls. People are defending it as a way to expose the sexualization of minors and addressing it to bring awareness to it but I think it could be done in a way to not actually expose 11 yr old girls to dancing like strippers and more likely encourage men to go seek out more images of young girls as a temptation. Gotta draw the line somewhere and I cancelled my Netflix as Netflix has been tone deaf about the whole issue. It's not the poster but it's the actual movie and inappropriate scenes that may do more harm than bring awareness. In the future if these types of scenes are normalized I can only imagine the harm and impact it will have to child and sex trafficking. I'm also selling all my Netflix stock although it's only a few thousand but this is about principles.
They turned the tables on old media with Netflix originals. The stock is up 5000% since they started producing original content in 2012. Before that the stock was up only 100% after 5 years of streaming due to the drag of higher costs of licensed content.
It will go up tomorrow
"It looks like this baby could rebound back to $400 by market close! :)I guess investors are finally reading the full earnings report and realize the company's fundamentals are still there and the story hasn't changed, and its growth potential remains high. As I've said in previous posts - those of us who have been in this stock for five-plus years have seen big pullbacks before, and each time we watched Reed Hastings hang tough, ignore the doom-and-gloom naysayers, and map out an incredible growth story. This is a buy-and-hold stock, folks."
"Definitely going to crash to $300 over the next several weeks, the guidance is painting a very bearish outlook ahead."
1 billion subscribers by 2030
They predicted beating last quarter up 143% from last year
"Analyst Guggenheim raised price from $285 to $360, maintains buy rating."
Its going to 250 at some point between now and next week.
"Betting NFLX won't rebound from this earnings selloff, like it has without fail for the last 8 years that I've owned it, is like betting the sun won't come up tomorrow. There was a short supply of new content this quarter...that has been without fail the reason for every single subscriber miss dating back to the time I first bought in. They retained just about all of their previous subscribers. The idiot shorts are arguing they haven't. New competition was not the reason for the subscriber miss. Competition won't kill NFLX. There is room for multiple player. Most people, myself included, use multiple streaming services in addition to NFLX. The idea that people are going to abandon NFLX in mass numbers is about as logical as the government legalizing murder. NFLX will only grow overtime. Shorts have as much credibility as the boy who cried wolf. Doing the opposite of what they've said over the last 8 years is the reason NFLX has given me a big enough return that I can make a down payment on a nice home. Shorts by comparison can barely afford a junk car."
why is it going up all of a sudden?
Why doesnt Netflix stream video games?
"Subscriber growth had peaked last qtr, there is only so much that subscibe . But the growth forward can only come from producing new original content , if it cannot do that ,then the stock will fall further in the coming months."
No difference between nflx and BET
Whose buying here? And I don’t mean covering.
When are those bond payments due.
Netflix raising prices by as much as 20% for 10 million UK subscribers. This means the price increases in the US are holding up really well.
"Most people still watch their original tv series on cable TV and broadcast, however Netflix original series consistently dominate the most popular TV series survey lists. Whether media companies show their shows on their cable networks, or their broadcast networks, or on their upcoming streaming services isn’t going to change anything."
"Problem with Netflix, is they got nothing to watch if you are a guy. It is loaded with Lifetime shows, no sports, Disney stuff is gone, all the popular shows are off their platform. With the Coronavirus all production was shut down. It will take years for Netflix to recover. They are in a lot of trouble."
16 MM new subscribers! Well done! Netflix should make a FREE version that includes ads & commercials :)
$325 this week!
"-> JPMorgan boosts Netflix target to $625, says buy the selloff-> RBC Capital raises to $619 (from $500)-> Morgan Stanley raises to $600 (from $575)-> Pivotal Research raises to $600 (from $580)->Goldman Sachs lowers to $600 (from $670)->Piper Sandler raises to $534 (from $500)->Suntrust raises to $530 (from $475)->Guggenheim raises to $530 (from $500)-> Deutsche Bank raises to $525 (from $500)->Oppenheimer raises to $515 (from $480)"

"NFLX subs are up, earnings are up, missing projections was taken way out of context by bias articles. NFLX 4 EVER."
international viewers subscribe Netflix to watch ying yang master and the soul. both great movies.
i need insight. should i hold i got in at 415? or cut my losses early? i feep it will be 500s by end of year.
netflix should just buy roku out and dominate.But they don't need to cuz NETFLIX IS THE KING
"Netflix grabbed all the Golden Globe awards, no surprise there."
"In video streaming, business subscribers will switch in a heartbeat, therefore, Content will be the king.Therefore, Netflix will rule in the long run."
"Patience everyone.. I know we are in the middle of a pandemic but historically, this has happened before.. Netflix will pop hard tomorrow. Don't sell the post market pop as this will rise at least 5% percent tomorrow, and quickly."
We pick off where we left off starting on Monday. Expecting huge gains this week. Good time to be a Long.
we are going back to 530 anytime
Should i sell for 500 dollar on friday or wait for it to become 600 next month?
Market action was telegraphing this result.
For once Cramer’s making sense!
We are above 500$!!! Finally!
Just face it Netflix has a long term strategic game plan working the global market and booking subs is the goal! The US market isn’t a factor anymore. Listen to the earnings call.
"""In the fourth quarter, Netflix's subscriber base grew nearly 20% year-over-year. Meanwhile, the company's revenue in the fourth quarter, grew 30.6% year-over-year to $5.47 billion."""

"I read that just before the earnings, there is always a sell off. Any thoughts on this. I have not had the stock for long."
AT&T today reported almost 1 million cable subscribers who canceled (They only managed to add 1.5 million to HBO and HBO max). Meanwhile Netflix just added over 10 million subs in that same time frame and they are on a much larger base. Netflix currently has 15 of the top 20 shows on rotten tomato's.This is what you call complete dominationhttps://www.rottentomatoes.com/browse/tv-list-2/
PE will come down to 15 because it is no longer a growth company.
Apple not buying Netflix - Can this be interpreted that there is no limit on the up side (in the longer term)?
Incredible
"Chinese Netflix IQ just bought out skymoon, chinas largest free mobile game producer. come to the dark side"
How do you Buy a short position. I have never shorted but it's time to learn this looks prime for it. Pretty sure this is going to tank...

"Something to keep in mind.....“For the full year 2020, we forecast [free cash flow] to be approximately $2 billion, up from our prior expectation of break-even to positive,” Netflix wrote. “We expect our FCF profile over the coming years to continue to improve as we increase our profitability and our transition to the production of Netflix originals matures.”And then:“With $8.4 billion in cash on our balance sheet at the end of the quarter plus our $750m credit facility (which is undrawn), our need for external financing is diminishing.”The exact numbers aren’t the important part. Here’s the bottom line: Netflix is no longer burning cash."
Netflix outperforming the market and other fangs this week. This could be the start of something good.
"yesterday was ""KEY REVERSAL DAY"" for NFLX stock.....This is super bullish."
"3Q is going to be Epic! Train leaving now, get on board for $500"
"10 shares, long and strong"
Was debating to sell 50% shares this morning. So happy that I didn't.
"so everyone is concerned about new streaming competition hurting netflix but nothing has gone live - HBO Max, Apple, Disney, etc.. so how does that play into this quarter? I think Netflix is over-valued but not because of current competition. Next quarter probably see some impacts"
lol most of you people have no idea how big of a bubble this stock is... nflx can drop 50% and it still will be expensive... I say this not to scare you but just stating facts. Most people in the dot com bubble didn't think about the downside either.. most were completely wiped out. Would you pay 100M for your local gas station that earned 200k a year? No is the obvious answer. That's how much your paying for NFLX...
"With summer coming and people getting out more, I would figure in lower revenue at this point.,... but NFLX is holding up well!"
What do people think Netflix is going to open tomorrow 10% up?
I won't be afraid.... say it 3 times
close 395.66
"On average $NFLX has dropped on Q1, Q2, Q3 reports, but has an average gain of 12% on Q4 reports. 390 on Friday!"
"You all can buy now. I sold my shares, which is a market indicator that it will rise."
"Don’t fight the trend, 250 coming soon"
Any one have an anticipated date we can see a stock split? The past 2 have been middle of the month.
"A long time ago I learned to consider PE ratio as a large part of my investment decisions, plus looking at the market overall and the growth rate and prospects for continued growth. I cannot see a justification to put my hard-earned money in a stock like this, since there is no fundamental balance sheet supporting the price. Tell me where I am wrong in this reasoning."
To all Longs.....
539$ Close.
"There is no stopping this. Analysts are embarrassed because they keep having to make up an excuse to up their models big time. This is up 68% or $57 billion in 2 months on no news other than a 1.9M subscriber beat. This is pure euphoria. No way to trade this except go long and hope it keeps going. No telling how high this will get before earnings release next month. Their sub guidance was very low (same as last quarter, which they beat), so any fool can figure they will beat again by the same amount. Does stock go up another 68%? At some point, the market cap is so high that it would imply they capture all entertainment dollars in the world. Guess that would be a trillion dollar cap? We could hit that by 2020 at this rate."
"Netflix leads SAG award, with 15 total nods — that’s almost twice as many than the next leading TV platform.https://www.thewrap.com/sag-awards-netflix-ozark-star-is-born-maisel/"

"QuibiQuibi, which is slated to launch on April 6, is a streaming service that focuses on short-form entertainment. It was founded by ex-Disney chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg and tech executive Meg Whitman, who among other things was CEO of eBay.Quibi—short for “quick bites”—markets itself as a new form of entertainment that focuses on “snackable” series and films that are each told in multiple short chapters. In its first year, the company says it will have around 7,000 videos, everything from scripted series and movies to reality TV.Quibi will have two payment tiers: $5 per month for an ad-supported version, or $8 per month without ads. Unlike many other new services, Quibi is meant to be viewed on a mobile device, not a TV, and it supports both horizontal and vertical videos. At CES, the annual electronics trade show held in January, the company showed off this technology, which allows producers to combine both types of orientations within the same video.Quibi has been able to attract some big Hollywood names: Steven Spielberg is producing a horror series that viewers can watch only after dark; Guillermo del Toro and Sam Raimi are also producing a few horror shows. Others signing on include Idris Elba, for a car-racing series; Andy Samberg, hosting a cooking competition; Stephan James and Laurence Fishburne, starring in Antoine Fuqua's drama series, “#Freerayshawn”; and a courtroom show starring Chrissy Teigen.There will also be revamps of “Punk’d” and “Singled Out,” from MTV."
"Can't you see that fundamental indicators have been of no interest to anyone for a long time. Companies with excellent reporting are selling, while bankrupts and bubbles have grown by 200-300% .. the market has long become a casino and big players are taking away their last money from naive private traders"
"Of the 12 most popular TV series released in 2017 and 2018 Netflix has 9, HBO has 1, Hulu has 1, and FX has 1. That pretty well says it all."
Bank of America gets even more bullish on Netflix: 'Still more upside for the new king of all media'
will reach the 420 or better level before they report earnings on 7/16
What happens when Netflix has to actually reduce spending on original content in order to stem billions in losses every year? Will the content get better at that point? I doubt it.

$FUBO so get this. Rich greenfield (yes the one from the short attack and 6.5 dollar price target) gave a buy rating for $NFLX ...... 7 months ago.  as a payed analyst in media he must be blind for potential ...
It’s actually right now in a 5-1 split mode that can happen if Nflx cares about there shareholders
"With respect to Cuties, this is a no-win situation for Netflix. The people bashing ""Cuties"" haven't seen the film. Every critic from reputable publications that has reviewed the film does not consider it pedophilia. And it it was in the legal red zone, federal prosecutors would already be taking action. If Netflix pulls Cuties, they then set a precedent for caving in to people who are offended by what they think a film represents even though they haven't seen it nor do they plan to see it. If they don't pull it, then of course; in an election year, Netflix is going to get slammed by politicians and dragged into theculture wars. Better to just ride it out. By this time next year, something else will be making headlines. And Cuties will be long forgotten. It may even be dropped by then as Netflix is anyway continuosly rotating its library."
"Wow! Almost everything to the upside in my portfolio today....except NFLX....what a bummer! I put in a stop-loss order a few weeks ago at $300. Originally bought my small time 40 shares at $115 so if I have to get out at $300 that's perfectly OK. i would rather it start its upward climb again. Stay tuned. I still have a cushion of $22. I have a feeling that the week to come will either give me a $7,400 short term gain or we will be off to the races again. Thoughts????"

I bought a small position around $490 but earnings are all about subscriber growth and they missed. Expect pressure on the stock near term. If you bought under $500 it should not be too bad. But if you bought over $500 you will likely have to wait several weeks or next earnings to recoup that level.
"what do you think a reasonable PE will be when Netflix reaches saturation. it's not a matter of IF, but when it reaches saturation when sub and revenue growth reaches 10-15% annually. I think at that time, PE will be closer to 20 (Disney is trading at a PE of 15 right now). If EPS is $9 at that time, NFLX won't be worth more than $200. and that's at saturation in a out 5 years."
NFLX crushed earnings last quarter. I mean absolutely destroyed all expectations. Stock popped up before we had a tech market correction. Trust me when I tell you that it'll be right back up to $600 in no time. You want a bargain? NFLX is it.
Nice 3 day run comes to an end....Nice comeback. Let's start a new one tomorrow.What stopped the rally when it hit $350?
"Even though I sold at $338.23, I think this will run more, just not today. I expect a retrenchment to around $335 very soon and will buy back if/when it hits $332. This is a strong long term play. Concerns about negative cash flow are crazy. Worried about a couple billion negative CF when the market cap zooms $14B in one day and is up $63B so far this year! Hats off to anyone who put a lot into this at year end. Quite a ride."
Anyone else excited to see how Netflix dominates in the Oscars tonight ? $$$
Buy Netflix
"I just saw, finally, Roma. I never really fall for hype of a movie, and I avoided seeing it because of the hype, but WOWIt is truly is a piece of moving art, and it beyond amazing, and I keep watching it over and over again to see something new that I missed before. History will rate Roma as one of the top movies ever made, I am convinced of that. Great going Netflix, Congrats!"
"$300 at max. Garbage is dead, while insiders dumping left right. Stay away. No growth ahead !!"
Disney’s strategy only cements and validates Netflix dominance and sound business strategy. Disney only shouted to the world that Netflix is doing exactly what it should have been doing the past 5 years.....
"Tell me if my logic is wrong. If a recession occurs and the economy is soured, NFLX has a product that is affordable by most, even in hard times. We always love to be cheaply entertained."
"56 forward PE, peg ratio over 2.5, and no massive organic growth. Unless they have another card up their sleeve .. look out below!"
Not Rich but I bought 10 at 332 in 2017 which is 4250 Canadian. not much but I’m. Selling 5 at 660 then ridding the rest.
It might close the week at $265 or around.
close $382 still on

It’s a good moment to buy 50 shares of NFLX?
Me before the earnings
I have such a talent to buy always at the highest price ever . Still so much to learn. With loses of around 17% of my invested all what I can do now is wait.
Analysts have the earnings estimate set too high for a beat. This is going to be similar to Costco’s earnings with an outrageously “unbeatable” earnings.I like to stay bullish but will play PUTS on this one.
LoL .. so much trolling here.. Relax nasdaq is -2.3% normal correction. See DoW and SP at ATH's
"I have both Netflix and Disney+...I use Netflix more than Disney+, after a month I will be canceling Disney+."
600 next week
SCRN is a great investment with the company agreeing on a deal with Netflix for covid testing. Amazing!
Want a better play for streaming and a high dividend? Then buy T! HBO max has better original content. It’s not even close.
"Sounds to me if NFLX is tightening up on password sharing that might be a sign that they see a slow down in new subs and are having to try a little harder to keep numbers up. I suspect NFLX was ok with people sharing at first, because they knew the piggy back non paying viewers would be hooked by the time they needed to drum up more new subs . This to me is a sign NFLX may be reaching their summit."
"Content has been becoming more and more high quality. Many more subscription services becoming available but as long as Netflix stays ad-free, they have no real competition."
NFLX doesn't like higher interest rates. Decreases the PV of future earnings AND increase future borrowing costs.
"crackdown on account sharing will backfire, SHORT NOW"
Maybe NFLX should move even further left. It's a popular biz model today to alienate half your potential customer base.
keep it up ( day 2)
MS says ntflx should be near 400 by July.
"Her is comes again, have a support at $380, good sign."
"everyone knows, this is done. Not more than 300"
Will hit $600 this week!
Dead money until 290s.
If a big buyer steps in tomorrow shorts might lose 10% in 2 days :O
"Start with how many people do you know using Netflix. 40% and growing. Netflix has far better content than Prime or anyone else. Also, they have Netflix only content which is hard to beat. Bought today. Watch for rally between now and end of year for $350+"
Just sold jan 21 (ie 15 months away) in the money puts at 350 and 380 strikes. Good premium. Paying $88 and $116. Just keep this cash when in one year price over 380.
"I am going to ask about 5 of my friends if they are cancelling NFLX after the Pandemic, whenever that is !!!!!I would be willing to bet they will not including myself. I like it because I know its there and just can't imagine not having it available. Many subscribers are hooked on some shows, not including myself. I am cancelling HULU mostly because they are unreliable and have a lot of issues with connections."

"I always get nervous for this stock as well as entire market when Jamie Dimon speaks as he is doing today. The guy is flat wrong over half the time, yet people cling to his words like he is some kind of oracle."
Hmmm I have the feeling we will hit that sweet $500 today.
"if you are up on nflx, buy a put or two as insurance. that way up or down on earnings you're ok"
"The survey of 1,556 U.S. adults, which was conducted from March 23 to March 25, found that Biden’s approval rating on COVID-19 has climbed 5 percentage points (from 51 percent to 56 percent) over the past two weeks. A near-identical majority of Americans (55 percent) now say they support the administration’s recently passed COVID relief package — up from 52 percent in February — while just a quarter (25 percent) say they oppose it. Of course this is what the media says and we are suppose to believe all the bull they are handing us. We the people don't have the outlet to comment about it and draw our own conclusions because we are censured from making any comments. Everyone I talk with are saying he is a big letdown and is taking credit for what the previous president had and put in place."
Henry Cavill was awesome as The Witcher.
Doing great Netflix. .Thank you all. You’re the best. You’ve proven this last year there’s always room at the top. For (one) player. The best will always be there.
"350 today, anyone ?"
"Subs talks, Bull #$%$ walks. Subscriber trends look extremely strong. I expect an excellent earnings reports. With peak pessimism, short interest, and oversold conditions, this sets up for a massive short squeeze coming. ""Netflix Subscription"" peaked during the week of July 21, while rising sharply again during the week of Aug. 11. These sharp rises in global trends have typically corresponded with substantial subscriber growth numbers in previous quarters. For example, the chart shows significant increases in the trends at the end of December, which corresponds to Netflix's fourth quarter subscriber additions of 8.84 million. We also can see in the chart the surge in the trends for July of 2018, which corresponded to additions of 6.96 million in the third quarter.The chart also shows that subscriber trends appear to have picked up again as the third quarter comes to a close. https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&q=netflix%20subscription"
It’s sho trying to climb.
"this will easily go to 500 and possibly 1000Netflix is the future guys, profits and such mean nothing when there is no competition. Once they control the market they can raise sub fees to $50-$100 and people will pay it because they don't know anything else"
"I'm surprised they didn't hire Andrew Cuomo too, to do a special on his fantastic handling of the pandemic in NY State. LOL"

Needham & Co says AMZN's media business worth 500 billion. Netflix at only 195 billion way undervalued.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/needham-says-amazons-media-business-083903445.html
"Netflix had a window of 3 years which they wasted to buy Disney, or HBO. They are in a tough spot, all their competitors have better content."
"Not what we Longs wanted but OK...Good enough to keep most of the gains from the December lows and that's what counts....If it was as bad as the Haters claim, we'd see the stock price trading down $30 - $50 ...Simple fact...So ...you can ignore the Blow Hards...."

Market Rigged this should be at 350 . Hedges covering on another level .
"50 basis point cut! Just think, when rates go negative all the debt on the balance sheet becomes a productive asset and can help turn NFLX cash flow positive. The more NFLX borrows, the richer it will get!"
shorts getting fried?
"As the streaming market continues to become more saturated with entrants that intend to carve of their portion of the market, $NFLX needs to look at how they pivot to alternative business models that enable the expansion of revenue streams that align with its core business. One great example would be the expansion of market through the acquisition of $FUBO that enables the streaming of local content and the added revenue stream of gambling beyond the basic subscription model. This or other alternatives could allow instant growth of membership and access to online gambling while enabling $NFLX to expand from original content to streaming of shows and sports not to mention $NFLX proprietary software could enhance access to a variety of other platforms. This is the type of thinking that will be required to enable the continued expansion of the business. $NFLX would then pick up the additional subscriber base along with revenue to expand their core business. Where will $NFLX expand in the future?"
All the NAYSAYERS on this great stock and yet it soars in the past few weeks. Everyone on CNBC was calling for the end of this successful company. They know NOTHING! Just look at what it has done. Anyone who bought way under $300 a share has made a fortune in a very short time. CONGRATS!
You guys think it’s gonna recover overnight ?
"Amazing stock))).Bullish 2020, it is falling .. The best report, it is falling again .. The main competitor Disney+ has a bad report... it is at the bottom again and does not grow, 5 billion buyback does not grow))))."
Buying opportunity
Who is keen to buy some netflix shares today???
"Since the president claims that the stock market is where it is because of him, why did he crash the market today?"
The fact that this is barely down 3% is telling and shows there are buyers even here. This will go positive after the conference call.
This could pop and turn positive today! Anything is possible with Netflix!
just bought a load at 270. Will wait before next quarterly results.
"Have no idea what's gonna happen with this one heading into ER next week. Could be $700 after ER, could be $450. It seems like sentiment on Netflix is very middle of the road. A split would be nice, but something tells me it ain't gonna happen."
"For a buyback, the stock is always going down, there is no point in buying back the stock at this price. 480-460 will be buyback."
"TARGET $365-->>CFRA KEEPS BUY OPINION ON SHARES OF NETFLIX, INC.March 7, 2018 (CFRA) We raise our 12-month target price by $95 to $365, on '18 price-to-sales of 10.0X, a very steep premium vs. peers, which seems warranted by very sizable international growth prospects. We raise our '18 and '19 EPS estimates by $0.33 and $0.90 to $2.71 and $4.72. With likely continuing momentum into '18, NFLX sees an expanding addressable market on further penetration of global broadband households. With '18 plans for up to $8B in content spend, we view NFLX's 1st Oscar win as another important critical affirmation following multiple Emmy awards (and nominations) in recent years."

Sea of green in a sea of red tech today.
"Hello everyone, I have just returned from Poland and I am full of admiration as Netflix is liked in Poland and throughout Europe. It is really a sensation and I am convinced that such a good company will now only go up."
"Overheated and Time to look elsewhere for now, p/e over 120 regardless of the momentum. Don’t even want to scalp this long anymore at these price tags. Better trades out there with much more value.Good luck to longs at this point, risk/reward ratio is no longer in their favor.VA"
It's been hovering around 490 for the past 2 hours!

Several upgrades out this morning:www.cnbc.com/amp/2019/04/17/wall-street-analysts-react-to-netflixs-earnings-report.html
"I bought 350 calls and 300 puts for May with a $ ratio of about 5:1, so I'm playing for a big move up here. This is contrary to my views the past few weeks. Mostly because we fell into 340s here the expectations are a bit lower now. Furthermore, the puts will limit losses and possibly be profitable in the event this drops big tomorrow. If this doesn't move at all, I'm fine with that too, I cut my losses from expensive options going into earnings and get into something else."
The pandemic is over and so is the big growth. Time for many of these stock to grow into their valuations (or not)
I am selling some of my shares at $500
the next Blockbuster.When was the last time you really wanted to watch something on Netflix. To much and better competition
"Today's trading was highly unusual. Simple fact is - no matter what your opinion is, given the extreme pressure on the market, there was no reason for NFLX to trade in the green all day. AH, the stock went down on small volume (as it went up AH yesterday on small volume).Interesting to monitor. I am sure others are."
anyone know what is really going on with Nflx lately?
"Interesting point here. 321 was support for months before earnings . If it now becomes resistance , look out below. Let’s see how the rest of the week plays out. From past selloffs there as a spike like this , followed by more selling. I’d take some profits if you bought yesterday. Either before close or at 10:30am tomorrow."
Wow. Just wow. Knew this was good when it hung tough on down markets. Now it's just lit a fire.
"same mkt cap as att, way overvalued. $300 as churn begins, no more rate increases without significantly increased churn, programming is terrible."
"Only down 9% after a miss, this stock has a way to go (down that is)."
Now Buy it up.... this was a nice wreck...
Play safe. If you have any profit on Weeklys calls. Take it.
Wow.. good thing i only own 10 shares
It'll be below $300 before end of year.
The days of V shape rebounds are over...$330 close
"Heard every opinion out there on earnings. I’m leaning towards the price hike is cause earnings report is huge. Supposedly 2019 is going to be tougher on everyone and the competition coming out, they can raise prices because numbers are BIG. Raise prices on a miss with earnings? No"
as soon as I heard about the Obama show I cancelled
"Netflix Has 'Insurmountable' Lead: Credit Suisse UBS just downgraded the Netflix Still, he raised his price target for Netflix to $425 a share. Its international revenues have increased at a CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 14.2% in the last five quarters. The company’s domestic CAGR in the same period stood at 5.5%, which indicates that the company’s international growth is outpacing its domestic revenue growth. Netflix’s Domestic Revenue Segment: Double-Digit Growth"
Bought at 332 2 years ago holding long
"Bullish crossover in MACD and Stochastic oscillator, according to foxchart. Looking for breakout at 355."
I’m wondering if I should sell some of my $NFLX shares and buy more IQ. Thoughts?
"The only folks predicting prices are shorts and analysts. Read the analyst reports. I prefer the analysts This stock is valued on the expectation of sub growth GLOBALLY and content production. That’s it. The company can make headway for a while...2 or 3 more years. Even if there is a little pullback, the subs will stick. Company is changing the content delivery business and is way ahead of the competition. Watch for other catalysts like gaming, premium tiers, price increase and an ad platform. Then maybe a merger because it’s to big to be acquired. I’m not predicting prices, judy enjoying the ride."
I believe Netflix is a long term buy over time....but as a now Hulu customer as well...have to say it's pretty good too. Z
"Get ready for profit taking the next two days, down we go, testing $300 level."

"Everyone is afraid that tomorrow will be a down day and selling it AF hours, it is going to be an up day tomorrow."
it's truly stunning that anyone still thinks shorting Netflix is a good idea
Good bye longs! You’re going home early but see ya next week
let see how is Nflx do this week.. I may get back in. let see
"I bought NFLX at 100, been sitting on it ever since, they have so many more choices than prime."
$270 seems to be where the most option holders get hosed today....so let's see if this miraculously ends up right at $270 to close......
"NFLX shares are owned by every major banks in the US including the Top 10 banks from Chase to Bank of NY Mellon, and these stable institutions which owned 80% of NFLX stocks are examples of the largest holders of NFLX to name a few namely CRG Investors 41,000,000 shares, Vanguard 30,000,000 shares, BlackRock 27,000,000 shares, FMR LLC 25,000,000 shares, StateStreet 16,000,000 shares, and the average daily trading volume is only 11 million shares which is less than 10% of the entire number of NFLX shares. Only 20% or 87 million shares worth 36 billion are owned by individuals (source: NASDAQ). These institutions usually rebalance their portfolio every June. So June has passed. These institutions are not prone to sell-off. For example with the GE stock; Vanguard maintains to own 600 million shares of GE, and BlackRock maintains to own 500 million shares of GE even GE fell from $26 to $13. Why they did not sell them. There was no SEC records that Vanguard or BlackRock bought or sold GE stocks. So will these institutions be triggered for a NFLX sell-off thus spiralling the NFLX price to half? It's a possibility but the chances of not happening is greater. In May 2002, NFLX = $1.21 and it has survived the Great Recession and reached this far to $418. No one can predict, but the company has a track record or innovation, and profitability."
whoa what just happened?!
"$SQ $NVDA $NFLX Since drop has begun about 3 months ago, it takes about 7-10 days from a new low to rally and then reach new lows again. This Friday will be that timeframe again. Sell into the rally, don’t get caught with good gains into the rally only to watch it disappear and now go into the red because of greed. This is a sell the rally market now, not a buy the dip market. Trade accordingly"
I'm long and nervous..anyone else nervous?
Looks like bad earnings are priced in. Now if Netflix does well then its gonna skyrocket.
i am hoping Monday is good day for NFLx . but need to wait until 12.05pm . you will see big change at 12.50pm. and stock will hit atleast $ 433

NFLX “down 10%” since fake earnings
5.15M adds was a strong number for Q2 which is usually their weakest Q. Wouldn't be surprised to see 7M subscriber adds for Q3 with the stronger content offering.
I wish I have gut to short more but I don't and against my principle as well. I think I am exiting too fast twice now. Last time I exit fast and sell off bring this down to 240. It was sad as I exit with lot of loss. This time I am again exiting very fast but this time making solid profit atleast.Moving average Trend line seems broken or all most broken and that only going to bring technical sell off now.Start of month and End of month complete contrasting. At start of month it was back by solid technical buy and now complete opposite.
It’s gonna flush at 3:50pm. Watch.

"Typical downward movement before an expected outstanding quarterly report. What surprises me is the manipulators can not run the price down even more. Especially in a down market. Any time I see downward movement the day of a quarterly report, you can almost always expect a blow out quarter. That is what is expected here. One of the better reports in awhile. This could run up to new 52 week highs tomorrow or even higher by the end of the week."
"Don’t foresee any significant movement tomorrow due to monthly and weekly options expiring. However, it should gain some positive traction as we approach earnings. Might test $400 in a couple of weeks prior to earnings."

Considering the earnings report next week on Netflix We actually have a great discount right now as the stock drops!!! Everyone and their Grandma are talking about the great earnings that Netflix is about to release. It's no secret. The stock is valuable.
"To all of you that said it would pull back today and suggested going short, so glad you were WRONG!"

REMEMBER AMOUNT OF SHORT IN THIS STOCK ALSO
Deutsche Bank upgrade creating havoc with algo trading now dominating the stock. Deutsche Bank can always be counted on to manipulate markets.
Yesterday CNBC focussed on Needham?s downgrade. There are all kinds of views but what I find disingenuous is that cnbc only published the negative one. There are four other updates from analyst. Bernstein at 422 yesterday. JP Morgan at 425 yesterday and stifel at 400 day before. piper jaffray today at 400. No mention of those at all. It also falls pre mkt because a network knows CNBc is going to focus on the negative one and starts shorting. Easy money. The flaw in Needham?s analysis is that she is treating the mkt as finite ie people will leave Netflix to go to Disney. But Disney and Apple did not get into this business to take customers from Netflix. They got in because they see a massive #$%$ in future years to streaming. So the point is all will win. The second flaw in Needham?s view is that she wants Netflix to introduce an ad model other wise they r in trouble. So now Laura from Needham wants to teach Reed Hastings the pioneer of streaming how to run his business when he does not see a problem.. just yesterday Sarantos at the UBS conference said business is intact. If he were losing subs he could easily do that. Short term because of these fears price can fall over next one year but don?t bank on it staying down. Too big a mkt and the suggestion they Netflix will lose 4 mn subs is complete nonsense with the pipeline of programmes.
Short will burn big time - congratulations

This move looks to me like NFLX is ready to raise funds again.

Netflix is the only streaming service that is making a profit. They have cornered the market.
I bought 50 extra at 363.53. How lucky can someone be :) Just before the buing spree.
• Morgan Stanley raised its target price to $475 from $450. • J.P. Morgan raised its target price to $450 from $415. • Raymond James raised its target price to $435 from $400. • Canaccord Genuity raised its target price to $470 from $450.
Charts pointing to 780 on this.
NFLX bubble is going to burst soon or later.
Apple’s $4.99 plan is way more expensive for just 9 shows vs Netflix’s $12.99 for over 5000 shows..
Still a bargain
What caused it to go back down from $290???
230 this week
"Bought 375 yesterday, 100 395@0.16 today - waiting for the big squeeze tomorrow !"
This stock kind of reminds me of netscape during the browser wars.... it's just a matter of time before the big guns get it together and grab the majority of market share. The win is that netflix would be a great acquisition for either apple or disney. IMHO
almost Disney market cap? There is a limit to the value of a streaming service with a reproducible business model.
"buy here and you will be happy . I told you at 250, 280 and 300 . This is will be best short term gain you will have . This stock will be above 400 tomorrow"
"congrats to those who held! last ER, it went back from 550 to 485$"
"I like your passion man/girl, whatever."
Daytraders: placing a trailing stop on this stock what is the magic number in order to protect your gains ? Just bought 300 shares but I think it is high and it may retrace. Market is very volatile
On a down day NFLX was strong. Especially at the close. That tells me Wall Street knows what we don’t know but are wishing for. Buy the rumor sell on the news then buy again. Or just hold it if an investor.
long term short on this stock. too much competition and the content is slipping.
If I were invested in Netflix... I’d start thinking of an exit strategy. Seriously. All they do is put old movies on Netflix and consistently raise the prices. They just raised my prices again ~ when I was just thinking the other day- how terrible their programming is. I canceled- I bet a lot of other’s will cancel as well. Netflix sux!
It this somekinda joke?????? red? Are you serious???? LOL

"Netflix is the stock version of the crypto craze. Everybody is just buying Netflix due to the name recognition, and because they see it always going up and they have the fear of missing out on the seemingly never ending gains. It worked for Bitcoin...until it didn't. I wonder how long this will keep adding billions to the market cap every day with no fundamentals to back it up?"

"Have a nice day you all. Dinner time here in the Netherlands.Let hope it goes green again. Going to watch Tabula Rasa. Belgium show. Very nice, can you watch it in the States?"
Don't make the mistake of looking at Netflix separate from the emerging streaming market. With it and being the clear leader they have outstanding growth visibility.
6.8 million adds and 2:1 split coming. Shorts will be begging for mercy. $550 call options are very cheap. Buy.
FB fallout. That's all
Strong!
"Remember People ,So called professional hedge fund managers said Amazon was grossly overvalued when it hit 500.00 per share where are they now ? Netflix is an anomaly stock that only comes around once in a while, so sit back and enjoy the ride.A year from now people will say I remember when Netflix was 350.00 per share."
"Remember when Netflix was $8 down over 80%. Content producers were raising prices, Apple, Comcast and Verizon said they were going to launch streaming services. Nearly half the floated shares were held short. They laughed at Hastings when he said streaming would eventually replace cable TV and Netflix was leading the way."
Netflix always is my biggest holding. even when I sell it off. if I kept it all I could have been rich.
"Good friend of mine from high school works at TD Ameritrade. I called him over the weekend. He said when the markets have been so bad and many have lost 10-30% equity in their positions, a small 1% drop pre-market causes tons of margin calls to go out. Most end up selling to cover the margin calls when market opens adding to the sell off and driving price down more. viscous cycle. You'd be surprised how many people are trading on margin...give someone credit and they will take it. Most houses bought on credit, cars, and most of the stocks as well."
"Netflix will recover, don’t sell!"
Triple top
Why doesn't NFLX issue its own currency like FB Libra? Thwart Zuck's ambition to rule the world.
the only dudes selling now are protecting their short term gains. cause even if earnings is flat this still has a pretty good chance of going much much higher long term.
This is only the beginning. Price targets all over this green earth at around $750 and higher. I will give it about a month before we hit that target. The analyst aren't giving us a 1 week target...realistically it's a 1 month target.
On Pace to move 1mm shares in the first 5 minutes. Jam it higher to unload shares.
"Netflix's balance sheet is a disaster. On 3/31/16, total debt was $8.9 bill vs. on 12/31/18 debt soared to $20.7 bill. Cash & equiv over the same timeframe only went from $2.1 bill to $3.8 bill. For year-ending 12/31/18, Netflix showed net inc of $2.68/sh diluted. The problem is that they're cash flow negative. There's a line in the Statement of Cash Flows for $13.0 billion, for ""Additions to streaming content assets."" The $13.0 bill was capitalized instead of expensed. It's not clear they'll ever see that money and may very well have to write it off. Shares closed at $360. Even if the eps of $2.68 for 2018 was legite, which it isn't, the p/e ratio is extremely high for a company cash-flow negative. Interest expense is creeping up, i.e., $150.1 mill for 2016 vs. $420.5 mill for 2018. The interest expense is rising b/c debt is rising, i.e., on 12/31/16, long term debt was $3.4 bill vs on 12/31/18, long term debt was $10.4 bill. Movie studios aren't giving away their movies for free. Original content is costly to produce. Needless to say, I've gone short the stock."
"wish you could buy nflx @ $31.00?? well here is your chance ! Buy IQ stock today , a Chinese co. that is 93% owned buy BUIDU. IPO was in March @ $18.00 and has already gone to $46.00 is just a few months. Well thanks to Trump hammering the Chinese market w trade war threats, the whole Chinese market has gone down and you can get IQ for $31.00 now. It is a fast growing co. similar to nflx in some ways and is not affected by tariffs, other than just being Chinese in general. CHECK IT OUT !!!!!!"

"take a look at NFLX, NVDA and FB chart at 4:15 eastern time they had a spike down and back up"
This market is getting so easy to predict. Let's get prepared for another 200 point down day.
Winners don’t come often when you are out there in the wild world of the markets. But all that can change if you join the right program. I joined up with these guys (http://Fairstox.com). Now I am having solid picks every week.
Days high. $580 coming soon.
"If Netflix want real growth they need to do something about the level of account sharing going on. My mom, dad, sister, brother and myself all share ONE netflix acct at 4 different houses."
One side of the mind says it is too good to be true and the other side says it is too good to miss out. This is how all scams and bubbles flourish. But ultimately this fake market will tank even more sharply than the last month..
How many of you here believe that NFLX will go right back to $400 as if the miss means nothing?How many of you believe NFLX will go back down to below $360?

"How about the sales $ per domestic subscriber metric? Looks hinky, jumps to $33.03 per domestic subscriber, last quarter was $30.87, before that $30.13. How about that cost per domestic subscriber, down to $16.24, last quarter $16.53, more hinkiness. And now CONTENT; $2,986M spent in the quarter but content costs only increased $35M. At that rate it would take 85 quarters or 21 years to amortize."

This was below $200 9 months ago...What makes you think it can't go back to that level again??
Why do people think 6.99 Disney means that nobody wants nflx? They have different content. No mature adult content on Disney.. they aren’t mutually exclusive. Affordable to have both.
Tomorrow easy 440.00
content sources getting more and more fragmented. The providers with the best exclusive content win
Who can sleep well today?
I sold couple 340 call yesterday (I have order at 2.5 and gone out and find out later yesterday that it was executed).I think this is inflated stock and clearly used by manipulator. Yesterday move is proof. sudden 4% gain for no reason. I think eventually this will go very bad way as no fundamental justify such valuation.
"MUST READ:::: Food for thought on NFLX (and all other high flyers)....each time price targets got lifted (on nflx) when it was at all time highs, it dropped over 20% every time, BEFORE going higher. Take early Jan 2018, target went to 350 (price was at 287), then dumped to 236. Then again in March, target was 400 (price was at 334), then dumped to 271. Now we are at 400 all time high and 500 is new target. Price will dump at least 10% BEFORE going higher...350-360 range will hit again soon. Don't read the hype on this stock...its being swing traded by big-cap on and off wall street. So, NFLX will dump soon BEFORE GOING MUCH HIGHER then 400...watch an learn....we swing traders make way more in long-run. We lock in profits on each run. Mostly we go LONG till new highs break, take profits, then capitalize on pullbacks with shorts... then hop right back in LONG at lower levels. PLUS, we dont risk losing large portions of our gains if something really bad happens. Much safer to swing trade...just need a good coach and trading group."
Obama and Rice presence will drive this stock down bigly yuuge!
All that AH action because of one analysts upgrade. Absolutely proof the market is manipulated and valuations are not realistic. Nothing against Netflix...just sayin. An upgrade shouldn't make a stock instantly shoot up. A good ER that proves a company has done well is more of a catalyst you can hang your hat on.Just my 2c

"While the naysayers are pontificating on a daily basis why Netflix should not be at these levels, the stock like the Duracell bunny keeps marching forward with occasional dips along the way. The naysayers and doubters for the last 100 points have been trying to comprehend why this stock should not be rising while it continues to rise. Now we have top analysts making a case that this stock will continue to move higher. There are the doubters and the believers and those that are believers and visionaries continue to make money and congratulations to them."

"I am holding some options, and I'm expecting them to pop big time after hours. The earnings will be great!"
There are not many good movies/shows to watch on Netflix.
Netflix India will boost the growth
"This is how it works folks. Cable companies used to charge from $100 to $300 for cable packages in the US and American consumers used to pay for that. Netflix change that game by charging $6.99. And now $13.99 a month. Consumer switch to Netflix in droves and dumped cable. Regardless if Disney came in or any other players there is room for more players in this field without cannibalizing from existing players like Netflix....remember consumer used to pay $100 for cable every month. So the argument that Disney coming in will compete with Netflix is false, they can Coexist together. The advantage of Netflix is the international market where right now they are first player and will capture the market like they did in America, Canada etc. This is why Netflix command the stock price that they did. How big is the world market....there are 3+ billion of middle class in the world who can afford Netflix subscription....Netflix currently only captured 130+ million of it.......Do the math"
This really is too easy. I had 220 last week nd 230 this week and looks like we will exceed that. I am wondering if my call for 250 post ER is too conservative. This just keeps running and may pop well over 10% when the subscriber growth comes in.
People are investing in Netflix like their Subscriber growth not slowing ever. It's own history is not consistent. But at least until now it keep growing so far.But if you look into HBO history. Incredible growth between 2010 to 2014 ( from 81 million to 138 million ) subscriber. It then dip next year to 132 Million subscriber. What will happen to Netflix price specially if remain inflated like this.https://www.statista.com/statistics/329277/number-hbo-subscribers/
has nflx doubled their earnings over the last year? no.. in fact they make so much money they need to keep issuing debt to keep their business alive.
One day before options expiration day Eric decides to upgrade/ Coincidence much? These analysts are starting to have too much power.
"People can easily cancel (as they advertise) their account if no new contents/shows. Besides 1 in 6 of the people in U.S. had signed up (300 mil population vs. 55mil member) which means market is saturated (family with kids a/c, friends sharing...). I see this would collapse (again) if their contents budget is down or member not meet target. 1 Million missed last quarter says EVERYTHING."

"Now it is coming down lol ! Maybe market correction can bring it to 250 before it go us to 300 and then 500. Internet success is still in early stage. Just keep this in mind, 30% of internet traffic is done by netflix and all paid and still growing fast. That is huge."

If Netflix would monitor how many accounts are being abused and shared by non family members they could double maybe triple their account number. I know several people who has shared their account with 15 or more people outside of immediate family
"Yes, Friday's trading results make me a bit nervous but, like the elite companies out there, NFLX has a great track record of hitting and beating the quarterly estimates....the mark of a leader or, super athlete...."
Seems like healthy pullback
"Setting up to be the best buy in a long time. Needs to drop another 70 or so points, then buy as much as you can afford."

"Im scared, miss or beat?"
I called a couple of my friends yesterday that work in the banks and told them to load up Netflix. This is going over the all time high soon. They where buying but said waiting for today to see what happens it’s looking real good. Going to $360.00.
We are up almost as much as $NFLX
"Exercise the 3 day rule before buying more. NetFlix could rebound later this week, but it needs to sell off further, maybe down to $325 before climbing again."
"Time to short this debt king. Only thing growing at this wall street scam stock is debt. Negative cashflow, rising debt yet the stock is touching the sky. This bubble market is ready to tumble just like Dec. 2018."

Already up 6 grand on my short! Let the party begin. To much competition .
$20 is my threshold before I would cancel Netflix. Quick survey on others threshold
320 before closing 
"so let me get this right, a $2 price hike is too much for everyone to bear, lol . This service is the bargain of the year. It is the cost of a sandwich. All these competitors are so far behind and people love many of the shows on Netflix. This is only their 4th hike in their history. Eventually this had to happen, how else do you make money? Look what Amazon prime has done, way more hikes, way more expensive and nobody blinked yet. This model like COST AMZN, subscription is what's happeneing"
NFLX will reach $ 275 by this Friday! Do not miss this buying opportunity.

Netflix price target raised to $650 from $625 at CowenCowen analyst John Blackledge raised the firm's price target on Netflix to $650 from $625 and keeps an Outperform rating on the shares.

Time to shine
"Netflix is a vehicle for transferring wealth from public shareholders to Hollywood producers, directors, writers, actors, production staff, etc. It is a total boondoggle for the entertainment industry. There is no positive ROI. The content bubble will implode."
The current decline is just a warning shot to what's coming......this will end up like 1999-2000. NFLX P/E ratio is at almost 300 (very irrational).
"Tommorow NFLX will break through the old high of 421 and march higher due to shorts covering, really excited considering I have over 450 shares"

"Wow... 320 in after-market... I think if the momentum continues over next 3-4 trading days, we all can buy NFLX around 280 and then count our money as it steadily moves to 400+ over next 6-8 months. I'm salivating... :)))"

Netflix is the real deal folks! It will be as big or bigger than Disney!

"Viewership and Membership UP BIG in March ""and"" production basically zero so no cost for producing NFLX originals (as no shooting was happening). NFLX saved a lot of revenue due to zero production in March and they also increased revenues due to higher memberships. All of this means share price will be going much much HIGHER!!"
can't wait to see the Netflix and Amazon bubble pop. better than any show i can stream!
volume is low today. I expect more selling in next 2 days
Sometimes you think you reached a floor and then you fall through. That’s what is happening. NFLX should test 350’s again real soon.
Can we at least close 1% up today. I’ll take that lol
"netflix needs to chill on their liberal agenda. Big mistake for content provider to lean left or right because they are just shrinking their customer base. I live in netflix's home, silicon valley and its one of the most liberal areas in the nation and believe me...netflix's newest original content is an exaggeration of reality. Tone it down netflix."
"dont listen to cramer ...listen to ur research,,,:-)"

"The reason NFLX is worth much less (circa 40) is that Video is FREE .. think all the amazing free stuff on Youtube including university lectures!!!!. From X to Triple XXX, Sports, Movies on Prime (for those who want free PRIME shipping"", ETC. Netflix worth no more than $20 to $40. Even GE is a million times a better investment than NFLX."
Apple beats and NFLX barely moves. Hmmm. up .10% at the time of my post. So much for hoping Apple would help a lot.
this was 410 after earnings what happened? lol

"Why the drop today?Any news."""
Is a entry point people or still a little more down to go!!
"Netflix since inception gave a great product with exceptional value to its customers. They have not strayed from that mission and that mission worked very well for them in the form of customer loyalty to the brand. Consumer knows that there are not that many companies out there that are customer centric, to name a few like Costco. Netflix could have made a boatload more of money but instead focus on delivering quality product at reasonable cost."
The stock is great but all the negative attention is just a drag to wait it out. The Netflix train is slow to climb in price followed by a long long slow bleed
If Netflix has taught me anything. That is how to stomach seeing your stock go down 30% knowing no one is near this company’s current market. Going to keep holding.
Sellers before the long week end.
"With that Comcast alliance announced today, I would expect the guidance to be pushed up well beyond current expectations."
Just remember all these new streaming service are in it not by choice but are force into it due to Netflix success. Profitability for any of these new players is at least 5 years away
now we’re negative for the year

I prepare to buy more at 310.
Covered yesterday. Just shorted more again.
Apple's strong income from subscription services like Apple Music only means one thing for Netflix. Stronger competition. Apple can easily bundle video streaming with Apple Music for a higher fee. Netflix is feeling the competition from all angles. Both Disney and Apple are much stronger brand names than Netflix globally...
385-390 is so close. Don’t worry about it.

"The last I posted about Pi, it was trading unofficially at $0.2x per coin and that is now all the way up to $1.22 and there are over 10 million miners/pioneers mining coins on their phones. Search on google, ""pi network coin value"" and you will be able to see current unofficial quote.Before you skip the post thinking it's useless for you, check out where BitCoin is trading today. It's over $34,000 per coin. I am not saying that pi will be that successful, but what if it even reaches $100 per coin in the future? Even if you can mine 1000 coins by the mainnet launch the next year, those coins can be worth a significant amount of money.In any way, you NEVER have to pay anything to anyone to mine pi, it's open for anyone to mine on their phone as BitCoin was in earlier days. Just download the Pi network app on your phone, use invitation code ""celebration26"" when registering (it's by invitation only), and make sure to use your legal name as when they assign the coins to your wallet in the future, they will verify that if you are the person who you said you are.As far as my progress, I have mined so far about 10k coins which unofficially are worth about $10k and possibly can be worth much more when the mainnet is officially launched and the pi starts trading on crypto exchanges officially."
"Here's some news. North Korea invites President Trump to meet with Kim Jong Un and POTUS agrees to the meeting. Sounds like fake news? It's true.

this was what I felt and stated before market open today: investment banks co-plot to upgrade stocks so as to push DOW up and break through 24000 points.

Waiting for Disney streaming service to cancel Netflix
"It is perfectly fine for NFLX to sign Obama up. It will not be perfectly fine if NFLX becomes a propaganda machine for the progressive movement. This is what ABC, NBC, CBS, and all of their affiliates have become. What a disaster that has become for them. And you have no idea how many people are turned off by, and never watch those channels. Another example is the Hollywood elites. Oscar ratings were historically low by a wide margin because many simply refuse to listen to the political garbage that is spewed as well as the ridicule they are subject to because they don't share the views of liberal elites.Mark my words. If NFLX gets into bed with one side of the political spectrum, they will lose massive numbers of customers. Reed Hastings made it known how much he hates Trump as he threatened to resign from FB board because Peter Thiel was on the FB board and Thiel supported Trump. So while signing Obama is fine (it's a free country where diversity of opinion is supposed to be welcomed - unless you are not a progressive of course), if NFLX starts this march towards becoming a liberal propaganda machine, it is going to get cut down to size."
HBO Max is better in my opinion.
Its going lower.... why
I know nothing but these numbers aren’t bad. They had to spend money to get international and produce original content. They added 8.84 subscribers beat expectations on that and EPS. That’s a growing business. Am I wrong?
Just bought at 312..volume settled down. Yesterday's volume was 3x the average daily volume. Up from here

So wen this thing was trading around 250 less than a month ago there was no buyer now it’s almost $100 more and people are all over it because a so-called analyst said u should buy? Seriously? What has fundamentally changed about the company from a month ago?
let's get back to US$400!

I was looking at buying some Netflix stock but the PE ratio has me very concerned. looks way over bought?
Time to buy ?
She’s moving fast! 
Remember I said last night Netflix will be back up! already coming back up in premarket $$$
"Mark Tepper, president of Strategic Wealth Partners, is a long-term bull on Netflix, but its outsized move in recent weeks has him nervous.“I would be a seller of this thing ahead of earnings. It’s up 50 percent since Christmas Eve so I think a lot of the good news has already been priced in,” Tepper said on “Trading Nation” on Thursday."
In the red tomorrow. Will be back below 500 shortly. Dream on holders. Cash in tomorrow. Your days are over. You will thank me for the advice!!!
"This quarter is after price hike, it is going to be blow out! Netflix India is growing faster than analyst imagine."
"Netflix isnt going anywhere,seems to be dropping less and less every day. Just a matter of time before it goes back up"
any predictions on earnings
Well that was easy
Should test 305 on the open monday
Anyone shorting like I have?
"if NFLX has good earnings, how high will it go AH? better to sell AH or on Friday? any thoughts?"

Down market.....NFLX Positive!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! .....GREAT!!!!!
"Falling Revenues, TANKING Earnings and yet $NFLX BUBBLE is getting PUMPED again!What a PONZI SCHEME!"
Imagine how bad the selling will be if it loses that post earnings 344 level.
Bottom line NFLX has hit the ceiling in US. Too many new cheaper choices coming to take customers away. Amazon prime continues to grow. Disney. Comcast. Universal. Etc etc Soon they will opt for Hulu model and add a monthly plan with ads. Cannot remain at this valuation burning 2 to 3B per year
"nasdaq bull take it higher, take it higer"
550 on the way
Down just a percent; got to see the open tomorrow

"Netflixx to buy Viacom/CBS Netflix Should Buy ViacomCBS | About: ViacomCBS Inc. (VIAC), VIACA, NFLX, VIA, VIAB, Includes: AAPL, AMZN, BRK.A, BRK.B, DIS, FB, GOOG, GOOGL, TJune 2. 2020Paul Franke Paul FrankeContrarian, long/short equity, momentum, Deep Value(6,000 followers)SummaryThe Netflix business model is under competitive attack and risks becoming the next America Online boom/bust example of a changing technology landscape.Without free cash flow and a much larger library of media content, Netflix cannot win the coming streaming wars.Only a bold and masterful move by management to acquire a company like ViacomCBS will keep the Netflix stock quote around present levels.The Viacom-CBS business combination is almost complete and could be a long-term buy regardless of any Netflix moves.Netflix (NFLX) is in big trouble without a grand stroke of genius by management in coming months. I propose the company fix its two biggest competitive problems - the lack of both owned content and free cash generation - before it’s too late. Netflix’s middleman streaming business model between customers and media content assets will not cut it anymore. By acquiring the new ViacomCBS combined media enterprise as soon as possible, Netflix can turn lemons into lemonade. Purchasing a huge library of entertainment assets to broadcast over the internet, while immediately adding $3-5 billion in cash flow and earnings generation each year, would put the embattled Netflix stock quote back on track.Management at Netflix is rapidly coming to realize a stand-pat operating model of paying billions annually to create/rent streaming content, while its high subscription selling price per month is coming under attack by new competition, is a lose-lose proposition going into 2020. The only way forward is to make a bold move, specifically a transformative merger with an important media content owner.Sumner Redstone and his National Amusement entity hold about 79% voting control of the soon-to-be-merged CBS Corporation (CBS, CBS.A) and Viacom Inc. (VIAB, VIA). I think an all-stock Netflix deal to buy out ViacomCBS in late 2019 or early 2020 would be an ideal ending statement for his long career in entertainment ownership and production. Who wouldn’t want to become one of the largest shareholders in a reinvigorated, high-growth return Netflix? After subpar investment gains from his companies for several decades versus the media industry, a sellout to Netflix may prove to be his grandest and smartest achievement. Sometimes, the simplest answer is the best answer. Netflix’s board and management only have to negotiate with the Redstone family to work out a price.Below are graphs of some of the television/film content ViacomCBS owns.Source: CBS and Viacom Investor SlideshowDuring 2016, I outlined the argument on Seeking Alpha for Disney (DIS) to acquire Netflix when its quote was around $120 a share. The merger would have allowed Disney to quickly enter and basically control the world of streaming video/entertainment content all over the world. Apparently, Disney’s CEO, Bob Iger, did not like the steep entry fee back then, around $50 billion to buy out the premier global streaming company. Of course, feeling left behind a few years later, Mr. Iger decided to purchase $70 billion in Fox content assets, and will likely spend tens of billions more building out Disney’s streaming service about to begin in November.Now the big boys are all coming to play in Netflix’s backyard. Everyone is entering the streaming business and spending billions to become even bigger players. Disney+, Google’s Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and YouTube, Apple (AAPL) TV, Amazon (AMZN) Prime, Facebook (FB) and AT&T (T) Time Warner have all announced media content investments or new spending sprees in the tens of billions to roll out greater streaming options for consumers globally. The competitive environment for Netflix could easily turn it into the America Online situation of the 1990s tech bubble peak. Basically, AOL grew at an astounding clip to become the largest and only truly functioning Microsoft Windows (MSFT)-compatible online access company for U.S. consumers between 1993 and 1999. Then, competition and a changing Internet access landscape showed up and ran AOL into the ground. Could Netflix suffer the same fate? I have openly wondered about Netflix’s business fortunes past 2019, and have been short the stock off and on this year.Netflix is Expensive, ViacomCBS is CheapThe argument for an all-stock deal, where Netflix just mints new shares to hand out to Sumner (and a few others) for ownership of ViacomCBS, is compelling right now. CBS and Viacom are late to the game in streaming, planning to spend future cash flow and earnings to catch up. Why not join forces with the world’s largest streaming service, filling your business model void overnight, while helping Netflix to plug its major gaps? Talk about a win-w"

Wow I have to say this is brutal just in the fact that if you didn't get in you felt bad. When you see moves like this it gives you the opportunity to make a boatload of money. Now we know what side to play for earnings or shortly there after. Hang on this is going down as fast or faster than it went up. I always say I don't know what I am looking for in a pattern or know which way a stock is heading but when it presents itself YOU WILL KNOW. This is one of those times.

I think it might go to 650 this week
"Goldman reiterates 400$ buy and adds nflx to conviction list, GM shorts"
Monday after close NFLX will be up $50.
"We used to get way more newer movies. Now days the movie list is so outdated, even though they increased the price couple of dollars. I love horror movies for example and I’ve been seeing same movie list for weeks. All they need to provide a updated list. They are not diversified so good lock for longs.I want even pay $100 for NFLX."
"just another milestone on the way to $1000, as Netflix dominates world wide media in the coming years and traditional cable crumbles."

"If you're long term, which hopefully you are, there is no need to sell at all"
"To put the $500 price target into perspective, that would be a gain in market cap. equal to the entire TWTR market cap. All at a time of losing DIS content."
"Totally insane reaction. NFLX is already the most overvalued stock in the index. A 28% growth rate is not high enough to bring its 300 PE down to reasonable levels for decades. On top of this, they MISSED revenue projections by $80million ($2.20b vs expected $2.28b), are experiencing NEGATIVE CASH FLOW, and are going further into debt. Any one of these three negatives would take a non-darling stock down 20%. All three would...pick a number... down 35%? But yet, in this crooked (can you say rigged?) market, it goes up. I'm not long or short. Just an observation that there are many, many companies that are superior to NFLX that would get absolutely hammered for producing results like this."
This is giving me a stomach ache
We have lift off
Am I the only one that thinks Netflix’s - interactive movies- is the greatest thing ever
Thank you Goldman Sachs. $490 PT. Let's run.
400+ on the way congratulations !!!
balloon is going to pop tomorrow. It just started to leak a little.
Market Cap is ~ revenues on the pandemic of the century. Amazing $AMZN $NFLX or Private Equity are delaying the takeover. Don’t bet on the short squeeze. Bet on vaccinations by summer.
very bearish trend
"Good news is that GOOG beat. I bot NFLX this morning expecting the rest of the FANGS to beat and that we would get one more rally going into next year before the major correction.Bad news is even after the beat, GOOG's price really isn't moving much in AH. That is typically a bad sign."
What's the expectations of Netflix earnings?? Going to beat expectations?
Hey Maguire get writing a new book .I finished your last book at 3pm today.

Tomorrow futures green this will rally big
Ah $380 Tuesday 
It’s waiting to run again
Just won’t leave it alone huh? What is it with this Disney fear? I know of no one interested in all honestly. But whatever. Hastings has been underestimated before. I’ll keep adding on the dips.
Same bubble mentality has arrived to town again. Just a day or two when we see a 700 point decline. Enocomy worldwide is sinking. Financial media is hiding it.
Here we go people start buying

Do you people realize that in the 1.9 trillion stimulus package 400 -500 billion dollars of it goes to bail out the democrat run cities with all of their rioting and illegal immigrant safe havens and misuse of funds ??? See what you have elected? The recession will be coming and soon.

Netflix needs to cut prices or lose subscribers to Disney. Either option is terrible for stock.
Where is the 500 to 1000 soon crowdmaybe 200 to 100 soonnice
Netflix will post good results i have a feeling.
What a week! From a low of 310.82 to a high of 359.15.From 6 red days in a row to 4 of 5 n the green.Let's do that again next week!

Right after lunch the buying begin again.
"Watch this snap green at open. Possible treatment is good, but doesnt cure the massive Q2 losses everyone but the stay at home equities are going to bring. Suspending guidance is a bandaid on a bullet wound."

"William Blair made some other decisive moves in the fourth quarter, including ramping up its investment in Netflix (NFLX"
It's good to be green.
I'm not a holder of Netflix but it seems to me it will soon be a buying opportunity.
Bernstein says Netflix should easily get to 90M US subscribers and John Malone says scale going from US to global is 10x which means Netflix should easily get to 900M subscribers.
"“But Netflix’s management has already shown that it is willing and able to deal with potential pitfalls in a proactive way. The company reports its second-quarter results on July 16, and is likely to show another big increase in sales.When that happens, the momentum could carry the stock all the way to $500.”https://investorplace.com/2018/06/can-netflix-hit-500/"
"The market is looking at virus as adding to Netflix Subscribers, but when the economy pulls back so does spending and Netflix is an extra expense no one needs."
"My objective two cents on earnings:Content spend will be outrageously highSubs will be ,Price increase announcement was an attempt to neutralize content spend.Will it work? Who knows. We will find out Thursday but any stock that has increased 50% in a month is primed for a correction"
bird box cost a lot to make. How much money did it even make NFLX? what a few more people signed up? people who want NFLX already have it. They made zero off everyone who already has it... think
https://www.google.com/amp/s/investorplace.com/2015/12/netflix-stock-nflx-insiders/amp/
how many people think that report will be bad on Monday?
I’m selling 2 more of my PUTS with 187% gain!Thanks NFLX lovers! Keep holding! 
"Almost made back the loss from yesterday. Only opened .02 in the red. Then dropped 3.44 from there. Bit spike from there at 10. High for the day was 360.45. Still the highest since October.Up 11.50 for the week, 19.59 for the month and 91.41 for the year.Should have a big surge next weeks because of the Oscars."
"Give us a bone at least maybe a stock split, buy-back, tiny acquisition?Just to shake this short purgatory"
"Name one reason why Netflix will be the content king for the next 10 years ? Because CONTENT is king, Netflix will never be a long term play compared to the library Disney owns. It is like David and Goliath. Anyone can stream, but not everyone has content that will survive over the next decade. Name one iconic show or movie that Netflix owns that the “world” would pay for more than $10/month."
"Few buyers, volume very soft."
"All bull aside, is jumping into some Netflix shares directly before earnings Friday before the bell closes worth the risk? I am well aware of it’s recent run up, been sitting on the sidelines waiting for this stock to pull back and lost out. Thumbs up for a Hell Yes or Thumbs Down for a no, you’ll get burned"
"Experience tells me that all short-term stock price changes are driven by capital, while long-term performance is driven by solid results $GOOG $WIMI $NFLX"
Remember when a stock comes down where it becomes flat it allows the buyers that’s wants in for a pull down and when shorts recover it will take the stock higher. This one was flat for 5-6 straight days.
"Look at the future trend of social development, find the right to hold firmly $AMZN $WIMI $NFLX"
"The companies being the hardest hit these days are those with lots of debt. NFLX is a DEBT LADEN company with negative free cash flow of over $3.0 billion. Stated debt on balance sheet is $15.0 BILLION. There is an additional $5.0 BILLION disclosed in the debt footnote in their filings. And there is an additional $10+ billion in debt like contingencies which didn't qualify to be consolidated on he balance sheet. So we have $30 Billion in debt just there for a company which stays alive each year by borrowing but credit markets are now closed. Netflix does not make any more money just because people watch more. In fact, they make loss as it increases their streaming costs to serve up the content. Maybe facts don't matter with a cult stock-but everything I said is a fact which is in their most recent 10K."
Nice rebound.
Yep! Smashed numbers
"More streaming does not equal more $$$. More streaming equals more cost. They have to pay AWS for compute and storage. People are tightening their belts, not adding Netflix. Cost are up, subscribers may even be down. $NFLX is overvalued."
CONGRADS TO ALL OF U LONGS!!!!!
So buy netflix and hold to 1000?
"Which analyst will bail out Netflix tomorrow. They have been saved by multiple analyst on every sell-off. Eventually, they will run out of upgrades based on previous stated upgrades."
good price to buy now?
"This company is one of the best in the market. Just buy it, and chill"
Wait till the real selling begins tomorrow.
A lot of time I feel like I am all powerful and only I can save the market.How? I simply sell my shares. And stock is guaranteed to instantly go up after that.
phenomenal growth.
"“As we generate excess cash we will explore returning cash to shareholders through ongoing stock buybacks”. Terrific, but my shares aren’t for sale Netflix."
is it too late to join the party?
At this rate NFLX will buy Mickey
$255 this Friday is possible. Hold off short...
Is it just me or do I see a huge block trade on ever stock around 10 am today. Buy backs?
WOOHOO! Most of my loses from the past 3 years made up in a week of NFLX calls.
"I'm sorry to rain on your parade but a.....125 PE Ratio.... according to current Yahoo data, unfortunately is NOT.... sustainable.MTNB "
No Obama!!!!!!
When do they report
$380 by Friday.
"if market goes up tomorrow. 11,202 open contract at 600 and 5,193 at 620..... should pop and then drop"
This has been my issue with tech stocks for a long time. What may take months or years to gain can be lost in days or a week.
Back to 325 and to 330 by 45 minutes
I wonder how shorty is feeling right now.
Buying time. Support at 276.64
I made tons of money shorting stocks. Shorting in this market is a lot safer and easier than going long
"Apple and Google and Disney and .... are spending and will spend billions to create streaming video.Do you suppose that will affect Netflix's bottome line?The forward PE is probably pie in the sky.PE more than likely to go up significantly, which will cause the stock price to dive."
Some institutions are dumping......back to 450 for NFLX in AH
"hey, who's short out there?? Feeling some pain???"
Well now we all know why $NFLX was up yesterday. People in the know were front running the upgrade this morning. Kind of blatant but we know nothing will happen.
Will turn green buy buy buy
HBO Max is better than Netflix in my honest opinion.
"rumor proves true, this stock immediately is worth triple what it currently sits at. The market cap is absolutely insane if this pushes through. $NIO $WIMI $NFLX"

Anyone worried NFLX is not in the sports realm?Disney got espn comcast got sky (premier league is bigger than all NBA NFL and MLB combined)

Lots of short covering today after GS positive notes on NFLX: Pre-Market 285 plus

"EPS estimates for NFLX keep dropping, which means multiple should contract, not expand. There is so much you can inflate a bubble stock."
increase subscribers without increasing profits. It is contradicting. Are they real subscribers?
NFLX down 10% since earnings pop. Gave up all gains YTD. The market is speaking loud and clear.
if it didn't drop at the last half hour before the bell it will not drop at all today... road to 600
Huge shorting pressure is what dropped this stock. Once people start covering then it should start going up
The prodigious market cap is making me believe the stock market as a whole currently has a specious valuation
no way we are gonna continue being trash for another week. $NFLX $WIMI $FB
Sell some Netflix and buy American Express going up today earnings
"The stock has been ahead of the analysts with a -8% return this year. Citi and others who late last week said free cash flow will not be black in 2021, and a bad Disney comparison. I guess up after a beat Tuesday, since there have been 3 misses, -5, -11, -19% last three quarters"
amc gme koss all tanked ..AGAIN NETFLIX IS THE KING
I decide not to sell any put until tuesday next week. And i will stop watching this stock (Except once in two hour) I know this not even worth $300. So I should not worry regardless what happen. Anything go up too fast normally come down. Stock price growing with result is healthy. When it get out of sync it's very risky.
Will it go beyond 290 at all ??
500 million in buys equates to 26 billion added market cap when they didn’t even beat earnings estimates
"This will go up big today, earning after hour and giving the record and history of nexflix people will want to get in before earning. After earning, this thing will rocket up to the moon"
"I am short and bear of Netflix, but appreciate all the bulls for their courage to hold it through earnings . Good luck"
Nasdaq heading to retest $7500 real soon. A lot of tech stocks earnings coming out beginning of May!
Hoping for $365 towards close - have a ton of 360 calls that expire today
I called it: NFLX will close at -5 to -6%. It closed at -5.7%. Tomorrow this will open from -1% to +1%
or will implode tomorrow overacted same old

I use to have Netflix but switched to HBO Max and glad I did.
"I applaud those who bought calls and/or stock ahead of earnings. I played it somewhat safe and deployed a $525/$540 call spread. So my upside is capped at $540. Still, it was minimal risk for what will be a nice return tomorrow."
Pps bloated beyond belief.HBO Max far superior!!After Queens Gambit nothingreally great added.Mediocrity at best!!!
Below 500 by years end
Netflix Expected to Spend as Much as $15 Billion on Content This YearThat makes last year's $12 billion look like chump change.
Wow TSLA down 17.58

"Netflix (NFLX) has 2 splits in our Netflix stock split history database. The first split for NFLX took place on February 12, 2004. This was a 2 for 1 split, meaning for each share of NFLX owned pre-split, the shareholder now owned 2 shares. For example, a 1000 share position pre-split, became a 2000 share position following the split. NFLX's second split took place on July 15, 2015. This was a 7 for 1 split, meaning for each share of NFLX owned pre-split, the shareholder now owned 7 shares. For example, a 2000 share position pre-split, became a 14000 share position following the split."
"It was a nice run from being a bag holder to making a profit and exiting too early! Was not sure what the fed was doing and thought it prudent to exit with a sort of decent profit! I admire you longs who held in there, especially with the nice pop AH! Go long, stay strong! Good luck!"
Today's short covering and buy force may bid NFLX up 8%+!
The ticker looks like it’s gonna explode lol
"D+ is a complimentary service geared towards children.

"Take advantage of the artificially low volume pump stock price today and sell before the dump. As I have said in the past, ask your CPA for their opinion on holding a stock of a company that has a current P/E ratios of over 200 and see what they tell you.

When is this going to 405 so i can unload..?
Bought 200 shares in 2002 at $25 sold at $12 because Walmart and Blockbuster were getting into dvd mail rental. These 200 shares woukl be worth $620000 today. Sigh.
"Technically, the 3 day losing streak ended..Had it ended in the RED, it would have been only the 4th time since July of 2016 that it ended RED when the high reached at least 9.Worst close in the GREEN when the high reaches at least 9.I guess it's better than losing 11.14 like the average had been for the last 3 days."
why the price drops like crazyafter nflx beat the earnings on 7/17/2019 ?
Bought another truckload at $288. McHaney with RBC is is bullish on NFLX. Research shows that 66+% will have more than one service. So Disney is not really a threat. Paying $50-75 a month is very reasonable. A family of four going to see one movie spends more than that.
Here come the momentum crowd who buy stocks with upward earnings revisions. Analysts are hiking Netflix earnings estimates across the board.
Strong BUY NFLX! Apple will buy this company soon!
Just wait. Maybe we’ll have an end of day rebound.
You know who's not buying; management!
announce a stock split that will fix it :)
"Growth intact...""Netflix (NFLX) is showing that it is far from exhausting its overseas growth opportunities as it sets up its first production hub in Europe. The company is setting up its first European production facility in Madrid, which is happening at a time when Netflix has a team working on nearly two dozen original productions across Spain this year with other original projects underway in other markets. Netflix spent $6.0 billion on content acquisitions, including original productions, last year."""
I was long . but this rises too much .gonna short it at 568
I bet we’ll be surprised how well it holds up today even with the big cut and debt worries this board will push.
Netflix removing Apple app means subscriber growth is strong baby.
"Netflix is going to price itself out of the market. I refuse to pay $15-20 a month for their ""service"". There are few hit shows that I need to watch. House of Cards used to do it, but they are over. I watch some sitcoms & shows here or there, but if they want to push the $15-20 a month barrier, I will cut the Netflix cord.Sling is $25 and presenting live TV: ESPN, news, etc. 40+ channels. It's a much better deal. I'm sorry, but this is a lousy move for Netflix. They need to enforce that your account can only be logged in on a handful (maybe 5?) devices. Too many people are STEALING by using logins from friends/relatives. Speaking of which, TIME TO CHANGE MY PASSWORD!!"
Just like they depressed the price this morning so that they could buy more at a lower entry point.
Sold $330 puts here into December against my position comfortable being long at $330
Finally this morning hopefully we shed these barnacles that have weighed us down. There is a tone of desperation amongst some here today.
Never bet against NFLX!!! Exceptional company and visionary management!!!
i saw aol do this same thing up on sudscriptions and always missing earnings. it ended badly.
Just saw this : https://www.barrons.com/articles/netflix-stock-will-keep-surging-jpmorgan-51554212692
Let's hope for a $20 jump immediately after earnings and close :)
THIS THE BEST TIME TO BUY 30 POINTS ON THE UP SIDE
Watch for the close. Today’s manipulation day. Next week the funds will start buying again due to the change of sectors for FANG stocks
"With Hulu in its 12th year of streaming and loses continuing to escalate a big concern for companies is can they ever make a profit in streaming competing against Netflix, so they hesitate, they wait, and they finally come out with a streaming service but it never shows up on the radar."
Time to short...?

What’s your trading strategy for today? Do i buy now or kick myself later?
I am staying long
"When Netflix spends 100 million dollars for a movie, they are not really spending that much for the movie if you calculate how many countries it will be shown and how much each movie will attract additional customers to its service internationally. The per cost basis is divided to 190 countries they are in ends up being minuscule compare to say Disney or Amazon or Hulu spending the same amount as the market is only for Domestic consumption ( except for Amazon which is in 2 or 3 other countries )"
Does anyone think this stock will do a 2 for 1 split soon?
Will will see next quarter with all the people opting out of the service due to the Rice hiring.
This will be green
Buy and hold. Moon bound.
"If media, analyst or regulator like FBI discover that millions of account paid mysteriously other than real user, what will happen to stock? Just wondering?"
They are losing millions of subscribers I just cancelled
"For those who are so confident that NFLX is just another bubble stock consider this. At one time, Apple, AMZN and Google hit 400 for the first time. True no stock deserves a 100+ PE based on earnings alone. The question to be answered is whether future international growth can result in a stock worth $20+ per share. That is entirely possible because content costs do not increase 1 for 1 with each new subscriber. Lots of subscribers sharing the same content will increase earnings per share.NFLX is in 130 countries and has only a tiny percentage of the population signed up so far."
the other faangs has some modest drop. This one fall hard. Why?
"Well, the 370 mark has been broken.For the 1st time in 8 tries, it closed over 370 when the open was over 370. Could not close over 380, but close. Best close since the day after earning, July 17, 379.48.... Next few weeks should be interesting. Does it go back to 400 or down to 350?"
any opinions on what strike we pin tomorrow?
Like I've said in a prior post... the Street wants this over $400. Ride their coattails and make money with them. Never fight against The Street and momentum... it's a losing proposition
$494? now that is funny Netflix can get new subscribers

Time for 600 then 700
what's happening here today
The stench from the Obamas and Rice having its predicted affect.
Today we saw the denial phase of the bubble.
Long term investment. It's a household name.
"Is it me, or has NFLX given back that huge earnings call?"
they tested a pice increase in Canada and it was a success.
Remember how low NFLX was at the end of 2018? it's back there and has become a roller coaster between earnings....not for the faint of heart. I wasn't i mpressed with their press conference.
"total liabilities $15 Billionwil be $17 billion within 6 monthsan article suggest the liabilities are actually $10B more, not sure why they said thatinterest rates going updo they have 'earnings"" or earningshow do you get to say they are making money, looks like they are losing money big time"
NFLX oversold.....Guess what.....It will rebound because sentiment is negative....Contrarian typical scenario
I’m picking up 5 shares long at the open Monday. Maybe 6.
"why is this not going back up with the markets, the way you would expect it to"
it'll get US$390 today
12%today
tomorrow... dizzy.....again
Wrong SG. They raised prices because then on the ER call they don't have to get funding for more content. Their game is to have the best and most content to stay on top. Commercial Free. I'll pay 300% increase not to have to watch commercials.
I see 400.00 this week

GOING TO 600 GUYS MANY SHORTS DONT SELL CHEAP
keep feeding the bubble
breakout on huge volume.
"This company is in so much trouble. They badly need a new CEO. The current guy has no clue how to run a company when there is actual competition. Netflix has been making the service and shows worse while hiking the prices. It's like they've taken a page right out of big cable cos playbook. And how is that working for them? I figured Netflix would start losing US subscribers, but I didn't think it would happen immediately.And after a disastrous quarter, the CEO blames analysts for bad projections? So it is good to be losing US subscribers? Face it, the CEO is doing absolutely everything wrong. He wanted to be the new cable tv and a one-stop shop for everyone. People don't want that? Until the competition got going, everything was easy for Netflix. The CEO couldn't do anything wrong if he tried. Now it is clear, he has no clue and has to go immediately."
Predictions Anyone for closing price today and at open tomorrow? My guess 315 close today and 340 open tomorrow!
2% a day yeah... this is normal..

Could use an up day for a change.
"I guess I might not need to worry about my Dec 410 covered calls....But, that's still a long time from now."
Streaming services are losing a lot of money. Licensing to Netflix pays more than streaming. We have seen a shift from cable TV to streaming and now we will see a shift from content producers streaming their own content to content producers licensing their content to Netflix.

I bought more at 185. Hope the drop is done.

"Ok, thats where NFLX was at 1 1/2 months ago... Good opportunity to buy."
"In a day when it opens at least +6 and the high reaches at least +14, NFLX has never ended the day at less than +5.75"
Ok - pre earnings this moon soon
Netflix profit now 1030% and counting. Starting to think this could be another Amazon.
NFLX will succeed and prevail..hold the line
Two things I know about the short game:1) you have to absolutely unequivocally believe in what you are doing and stick with it2) have the resources to weather the storm.I’m short this stock and I’m going nowhere
"strap in, here we go again!!!!!"
370 today guarantee

565 WATCH
4 reasons Netflix is destined to become the next mega cap company. 1. It keeps all the revenue by eliminating the cable middleman.2. It is hands down the best distributor there ever was in the media industry. 3. Because of economy of scale that exists in the media industry Netflix's big lead in streaming means it's much more profitable than other streaming services.4. Netflix reinvests those profits in more content to thwart competition.
Thinking of adding 3500 shrs tomorrow.
Get in now! Will touch $525+ tomorrow!!!

"nflx p/e is still 238 and forward p/e 77....there is still a lot of room to go down. be realistic about this folks, no buying on the dip please, this i way overvalued"
"Wow I just watched CNBC interview ( I was out this afternoon). Look Andrew must upset some big players.Wow they refuse to recognize fundamental of Investment:- ValueWhen Andrew said Netflix gone ahead of itself (Which mean overvalued) they all coming after that's not fundamental reason to make call. If Their growth slowing or something like that then it understandable.So Stock being overvalued is not issue and All those analyst and media pumping people into over inflated stock like nflx and $AMZN is god gift but When someone speak with sense, it's nonsense. What a great Wall street and how good they are adjusting to new Internet reality and still find way to control market (By Controling Sentiment)"
Holding long and hard in at 332 3 years ago selling half at 664 then riding the rest let’s go Netflix the best I the world
Hey shorties. The Netflix run has only just begun.
I'm accumulating now up to 1500 shares.
Always a week behind in my options.. 360 call expired last week... Why....
"Bid against amazon for amc, don't let them steal amc, it's worth forty a share, make them pay up for it netflix, build 100 drive ins in the midwest and show netflix originals and outsell the largest film producers, paramount sony, all those guys."
Wait after lunch going green again start buying. You be happy closing around 366.00. It’s Friday baby
"I cover 400 ( 200 I sold yesterday at 366 ) Still have 800 short but I have 7 352.5 puts. Going to cover soon. If this go lower than that before I able to cover , then I am mostly out but My bet is stock not going to drop quickly because still lot of over excited crowd ready to buy when this go near 350."
Let’s go!!!
Short covering could take this over $290 again by tomorrow
"I don't understand. If you want to buy a company, don't you want to purchase it at a cheaper price?"
"In the early morning, institutional investors started taking profit and selling slowly. They keep retail investors holding so they can sell high. The selling will accelerate near closing today and continue tomorrow early morning"
Price target raised to 475
My 5Million Long position took a big hit tonight but i know this is a long play. They keep adding subs. do you know how hard is to add 10M subs? this will gradually go up long term. I see market cap of 1 trillion in 5 year.s
I told your guys that someone manipulate the price few days ago. no one trust me. now you see the result. hope you don't trap when you in in very high price. you might never get back....
Why the big drop?
NFLX to split 3-1!!!!! Load up@!
"The share appreciation these last eighteen months or so has been unbelievable. Not complaining, but really wish I had purchased more than just the IRA yearly limit years ago."
Nothing that anyone says here today matters until AAPL reports.

"GUYS, 400+ on the way congratulations!!!"

For once the analyst was right. See you under $300

It's always nflx drops after the earnings! So I guess I'll buy just after the earnings!
"Plenty of studies on it, too....Mathematically, one has a far better chance to make money in stocks by taking long positions....Shorting stocks has a far less success rate...And, I have seen very little in terms of acumen and ability on stock message boards by people who claim that they are short a stock...."

Netflix has reached escape velocity. 1 billion subscribers is in the cards.
Lets hope NFLX goes beast mode tomorrow.
Gonna start seeing a runup to earnings
"i'm going to buy NFLX before ER tomorrow so it will crash. When I buy the stock price crash. When I short, stock price spike."
There is no other place to go for investing. So buy and hold on tight. It's only going to go up more!
Were too many people in weekly calls? Is that why this dumped the past two days?

The negative ripple effects from NFLX to my healthy tech positions Rob Arnott is predicting seems unfair to us real investors
"Get excited about NFLX, it isn't all that bad....290. Just let go higher, a better short position awaits you, just not now."
Now is the time to buy people!
Realistically this stock will see $375.00 before it sees $330.00. When this wakes up it’s going to crush shorties beyond recognition. A stock like this one doesn’t get a $70.00 haircut on the sole basis of missing subscriber growth.
Guggenheim increases PT from 360 to 420 on subscriber growth in India.

"Earnings per share (EPS): $1.19 vs $1.39 expected, according to Refinitiv survey of analysts Revenue: $6.64 billion vs $6.626 billion expected, according to Refinitiv Global paid net subscriber additions: 8.5 million vs 6.47 million expected, according to StreetAccount"
"As I have been saying...lower highs, lower lows..."
am I the only one seeing YUGE shortfall in Q1 EPS forecast??? consensus was .84. they are now expecting .56 despite the massive price hike. YIKES
Cramer said it would be down more than 50 today
Rally eased back perfectly to the week average which is actually a very bullish signal as the week continues at an upward trend. means no more violent whipsaws and continue gaining about 5 points each day
The outcome will either make or break the NASDAQ over the next week or so with additional earnings from FAANG.

Tesla, Amazon, Apple, Twitter, and other tech stocks are all going down after earning announcements. 30+ mil people are unemployed and many are scared for their jobs.

So much for $600 NFLX..... another terribly overvalued tock stock.... one of the best shorts in the market...
amazon is next!
"When it comes to Netflix and Disney, Disney has 5 times the revenue, 6 Tims the profit, but a lower market-cap. Think about that for a minute. If Netflix manages to continue beating estimates it will still take years to live up to it's ridiculous valuation. Even then there would have to be an absence of competition and a strong bull market just to keep this share price flat."
"Consensus estimates 5.75 billion revenue. Report $5.77 which beats estimate, but wasn't impressive. Forcast earning per share $1.64, reported $1.57 which isn't meet expectations. It means Nflx added 16 million subscribers at discount price"
"With competition so high, how come analysts still think the subscriber numbers gonna stay the same. The will go down for sure. There’s not point in this stock going high. Longs gonna get burnt soon"
"I set to sell short $420, but it is struggling to get up $420. It went up 2 days, I expect going down the third day, then will go back up again the 4th day. I anticipate a large drop after ER. If DIS has 50 million subscribers, at least 5 million came from NFLX"
This is one of biggest market caps in the world that barely makes EPS. This stock always amazes
"Glad I finally bought my 10 shares back I sold a year ago for a loss, everyone should own this and I don’t care what anyone says this is still looking amazing. Check out “the little hours” if you haven’t seen it yet. Funniest movie I have seen in a long time, the wife thought it was great. The best chick flick type movie I have ever seen. Gotta love Netflix and got to support this still amazing company that is saving Americans $$$"
"If you compare $NFLX and $AMZN against $GOOGL, $NVDA, $FB then you will realize how smart move this is.$GOOGL, $NVDA and $FB all about same growth rate. Only thing different is those generate lot of profit v/s $AMZN and $NFLX actually have negative cash flow. $FB and $GOOGL actually trading discounted Forward PE just 2 year out than S&P 500 overall.So why NFLX keep going all time high vs other not.two reason.1.> NFLX and AMZN ceo/management active pumping stock price. Other are not. Something that fan club love.2.> Big player know it's way inflated. They love it. They pushing trend follower to these two and other such stocks. While reduce them from quality companies. They are very successful I think.So what might happen next.We don't know when this happen, it all depend on how strong retail interest remain and how much further Margin /debt used by retail investors, What is limit before big player exit long position and what is limit when they dump everything & go actually short. But my prediction this will happen. AMZN and GOOGL right now have $425 difference. I think in year or so this likely <$200, Could be negative.Same with NFLX, it likely trade lower than $NVDA (Also might $FB) in year out. If you can handle temporary paper loss.I recomend go long on $GOOGL & $FB, $NVDAGo short on $AMZN and $NFLX. I think you will not regret strategy year out. You likely profit limited to 10%-15% but again risk is limited."
"One of the best stocks to buy right now, queens gambit show is gonna drive profits to way better than expected. Very bullish with price target at 680"
Is it too late to buy at current price netflix? thoughts?
"Ok with the fervor dying down a bit I’d like to re-ask my question from yesterday. Netflix has a massive debt load. Interest rates are going up. Has anyone looked into how this will impact their profits?Not trying to attack, just wondering.(And to head off the one response I got yesterday, I know they are saying they will not need to borrow new money. But they still have to deal with the debt they already have, and interest rates will not remain constant as debt is refinanced or as bond values go down.)"
Why up today?
This will double from here
"@zoe India is a poor country? Yes but not for all. India has the richest people in the world. Also a great deal of India's population is moving upwards to what they would consider middle class.I know, I've been to India many times.They love movies, TV and their cell phones."
NFLX still has a little loft left. Up she goes!
"Friday, NFLX had a down day. If (and I mean if) Monday is a positive surprise, then we may see a Gap Up. But this is would be a special & unique Gap Up,....... a Bullish Kicker, one of the strongest bullish signals. Stay tuned....."
593 to 526 . Awesome . Rather not even bother w/ Netflix stock. What a disappointment. Headed right back to sub 5.
Way overpriced stock. The fall will be hard on this stock.
Like I said we going to $400 in less than 2 weeks.
believe it or not: NFLX will close above $275 and $280 below.
310 tomorrow ?

dot com II bubble is about to go bonker big time. Tomorrow dow -800 and nasdaq -350
sadly nflx has an unsustainable business model and will never be strongly profitable even though they provide a great service that tons of people subscribe to.
Buying op. They need to develop a live TV service like YouTube TV of Sling TV to package with their streaming service. No brainer IMO. The growth potential is still there.
Should’ve bought another 312.50 put! Stock dropping a lot in the after hour
I bought 1 $600 call option. The maximum option pain for 3/19 is $520. So it would be better to sell it or keep it? Any advice in this maximum option pain strategy would be really appreciated

"How many big (over $50B market cap) companies can tack on 10%, or over $8 billion in market cap in one week on essentially no news? This reminds me of AMZN a couple years ago. At this rate it could be AMZN size in a couple years! Crazy! Could surpass $100B market cap by end of next week!"

Discovery just announced a new streaming service.....and many more companies doing the same. Do you think it’s been their plan to do this all along as part of a broad company strategy? These companies are forced to adjust their business model because of the Netflix effect. What we are witnessing is the demise of an old industry and the rise of the new. The companies who adjusted Years ago has a better chance of survival than the companies who. pivot just now.

Late afternoon is when we see a rally in the stock as people will want to have NFLX in their portfolio prior to start of a breakout week (especially big boys and hedge funds). A little Profit taking so far today is very understandable.
Don’t worry this will keep going up up up. Trust me!
"Netflix is still up around 20000% in last 15 years. I never did understand how this company goes up everyday trading at 140 times earnings and losing billions every year. I know it is all about subscriber growth, but still never deserved to be up 20000%."
bankers take profit today in Nflx and use $ to pump up Amzn
"I am seeing some really great relative strength. Netflix looks like it wants to take off, a coiled spring ready to fly."
"The long-standing assumption for Netflix's optimistic growth trajectory was the potential pricing power and hyper growth of subscriptions. However, recent market trends show that its core pricing power may be limited asnew subscriptions slow.https://seekingalpha.com/article/4186627-netflixs-perceived-pricing-power-may-soon-hit-reality"
Looking at 600 tomorrow
US subscriber growth will go negative next year. So many streaming providers. You just need one. And do you know anyone who doesn't have one of them? Everybody has NetFlix or Hulu or something. Now DIS and AAPL will take them away plus Comcast is now providing a free streamer. AT&T and Spectrum will be next. Streaming will soon be just like an email provider. No money to make.
"For all the gullible ones who bought this thinking higher viewerships = higher revenuesNetflix doesn't have it's own servers it's using AWS cloud (Amazon Web Servers) which charges for the network usage $0.15/GB on monthly basis.This means that while the membership price is fixed, Netflix's COSTS ARE HIGHER when everyone are not working and watching all day long. There real winner from all this stay-at-home situation is AMZN which is overpriced and heavily pumped as well but that's a different story. Beware."
back to 400 by the end of this week
A trading buddy asked me the other day about NFLX and where I got the pick. I told her to check out (http://Thetraderguide.com). That’s where I get 95% of my winners.
Guy on CNBC trying to twist chart reading according to his short positions? Anybody noticed?
SHORTED 5000 SHARES I THINK IT WILL GO DOWN WHEN REPORT EARNING TODAY.. I HOPE I M RIGHT..ANYONE ELSE SHORTING.
The fact that they raise prices two days before earnings it means that they are coming up short with the earnings
Oh man this is getting juicer by the minute. Big buying are coming in fast.
Best close since 373.25 on July 12 of last year
Netflix is the Tesla of movies streaming
"Longs need to defend $560. Once that level is breached, it will drop straight to $525 or $535."
It will be 400 very soon .
Looks like the mm wants to keep it around $350.
what the h. is going in Netflix... why does it keep going down and down.... ?
Looks like market has bottomed at least in the short term. Earnings will be the focus going forward.
May be time for that epic thing.
The old Netflix stock that I know usually ends the day like this up 8%. This one is just about half way..
"Toss a coin to the Witcher, he will make you richer......."
just give up shorties. your lucky you pushed it down to mid 260s after their best earnings in history and overblown competition. pe is not a good measuring stick for a growth company. Netflix is still just that until proven otherwise
"Been in NFLX stock for the long haul, excellent content coupled with mg'mt being mostly ahead of its various peers. I bought some AMC with some recent proceeds with talk that Netflix could have some interest in this beaten down theatre/entertainment Co. What better way to get your original films on BIG screen across the USA and promote all your other content."
this is gonna drop imo
huge earnings in 7 days! 550+ coming
time to short?
RBC Capital Mark Mahaney reiterated an Outperform rating and $500 price target on Netflixhttps://www.barrons.com/articles/netflix-stock-international-growth-mexico-51591713030
"Netflix is coming out with a new movie ""House of Cards"""
All time high close
If you want to short—-dont short the stock. Short by buying puts or selling calls. It avoids short short squeezes. Do yourself and othrs a favor.
"I can still remember when AMZN dropped like this after earnings and I honestly thought that was a buying opportunity. But I was too scared to jump in. Look at where Amazon is now... Honestly, you just need to know who’s going to be the winners of the future. For me, NFLX is the future and being the pioneer of the streaming world, it will only get bigger and stronger over time."
Anything is cooking internally.. why this is going without any reason?? I am worried now..
"As predicted, it was weak this morning. I hope you took advantage of the dip below 209 to pick up some more. I predicted a slight green finish today. Let's see if we can get there."
"I bought at $19.74, sold some at $400 and $350. I’m still obviously up, but I am thinking of selling some now so I don’t lose any more. Or just wait and see if it goes up again. Don’t know what to do!"
Patience pays!
It will be down 75 in the morning
One day soon you will wake up and see the price 100 points lower. Then you will ask What Papen? What Papen?. Then on another day soon after you will wake and see this down another 75 points. Then you will ask your mom What Papen What Papen?
"Two price target increases already, buyback coming, NFLX to $1000!"
How is the one-year target still $400?
"NFLX is the only FANG stock you can buy at big discount at this price level.You will see $400 soon.Similarly it happened in July,2010 after missing est and then back to uptrend in one week or so!"
toward $360 close!
What a golden opportunity to buy it at a discount!
Nothing but a casino. That's all the stock market is. Yesterdays gains...whoosh.
"This is a 1999 kind of Move up, on NOTHING. name one reason, 100% Machine driven"
362/share by the end of today
"Uh, stock did not blow up like a stock ALWAYS does if it’s as bad as our sleazy board bashers claim. It traded down but, did not collapse further from the open.Netflix lives. Prepare for Son of Netflix, Haters—-"
"this ""crash"" was a blessing, I'm making a fortune today :D"
Why this slow bleeding again?
This has been trading sideways for 6 months. It’s about time it breaks out 600+
"... How many times recently have you seen it down in pre, only for it to completely turn around later that day... easy for someone to manipulate the pre with a bunch of selling... the seller or sellers made 11 yesterday... use a little of that to cause a little panic."
Lots of immature folks on here. You can make money either way on this one depending on how good you trade. I'm out. Good luck to everyone.
"Cramer says FANG still have room to run...That the signal to his Wall Street buddies? Suddenly, positive news appears."
"Well, the market just lost trillions for what, a $20-30 billion trade squabble. Back up on Monday to $325. Seen this happen before."
"Anyone notice a quarterly trend here? Right before earnings and # of subscribers release, the stock dips to sub 500. Right after the market closes and the company reports, the stock shoots right up. It appears it happen the last 3 quarters."
Market up again tomorrow. Now it is the decision time. Sell into the rally and reap gains or hold a little more. But what if markets tank again. I hate this decision time. I guarantee if I sell it will keep going up and if I hold the market will tank. Happens everytime lol
love Netflix but this growth is not sustainable. pullback soon before new highs

Based on their current trajectory...they hit 200 subs in about 26 months. Z
Add AMC $6.04. $AMZN and $NFLX salivating at these levels for the On-person Entertainment.
Final melt up before the big correction!
"So many trolls angry at Netflix bc of the Obama’s producing a few shows. Hey snowflakes, ever heard of the concept of not watching those shows? I’m sure there are conservative talk show hosts on SiriusXM radio. You don’t see me cancelling my subscription. I just....repeat after me....don’t listen to those channels."
Oh boy
"Raising prices now? Not committed to growth anymore? Investors are looking at this the wrong way lmao. In my view, this actually hints at sub growth not meeting expectations come earnings. Why else would you stunt your growth right now just as more competitors are ramping up their offerings?"
"Smart money is headed for long positions at NOK, earnings tomorrow morning then liftoff long term. They are manipulating stock price but, longs will prevail. Cheers."
Wait until lunch more big buying. Banks are loading up heavy
Will finish in Green today. New highs by Friday.
"Here we go with the mail in balloting again in Georgia. Stop the steal and save the country, vote republican to hold the line in the senate and save the middle class in this country and save the country period."
Told the shorts earlier this week to cover after the $327 close. Tech analysis is a beautiful thing. Read a book shorties.
83pc held by institutional. No wonder this going up. Could be huge short squeeze to 700
So T mobile one data plan offer free Netflix now. Guess how many new subscribers will be there. And btw. The hunting of hill house is really good. There are so many good original shows . They will dominate the market. So for long investor I am still in
A toast to the Colonel and Paul Williams.
NFLX is up over $ 9.00 per share in pre-market on an analyst upgrade!!!
great today but I hate to see what happens tomorrow
"Steven Spielberg is trying to keep NFLX out of The Oscars. When one of the most influential Hollywood directors of all time is scared of you, you know you're doing something right. Netflix has disrupted the entire film industry, and has a massive head start over all other streaming platforms. All shorts ever talk about is their P/E and their debt. They're not seeing the bigger picture here."
all eyes on it! I’m positioned for a breakout but have already reduced some! $PDD $NFLX $WIMI
most businesses start off in debt and NFLX is young..by 2020 it will be profitable..scare story doesn't cut it.
Wow. What a move.
"BREAKOUT WATCH for the breakout above 222.36, no resistance in area just above.Type: Continuation breakout from single resistance.Target: 235, 6.7%"

Netflix rises after Bank of America says it's 'seeing significant reacceleration' in mobile app downloads https://www.cmlviz.com/article/NFLX/cnbc-2019-9-9-netflix-rises-after-bank-of-america-says-its-seeing-significant-reacceleration-in-mobile-app-downloads.html
Options trading priced in 10% volatility. Call buyers need NFLX to move 10% up to begin making money. Right now only 6% gain so both call and put buyers lose money if they bet on the earnings using options.
This is pure unadulterated pricing power. If they really needed money they would slow down spending.
I believe the stock will pop up nice after the report to (let some people out) and then sell off. It looks like it is set up for that.
Gap up and drift sideways. I would say that is what happens 99% of all days.
bought few thousand shares at 18$ been happy since then everything is paid off kids are in best universities! i knew it woud kill blockbuster
NFLX always recovers and goes to new highs. Billions of Indians and Chinese still need to sign up for their service! Their growth story is just getting started. I bought at $420 but I’m not worried - am in for the long term.
Desperation in the NFLX bashers’ posts—-
another hour till green?
It will never get back to 333.00......says the nut who never bought.
I smell 400 before earnings...
It is hard to believe that someone is still buying WORTHLESS $NFLX Netflix shares in this MEGA BUBBLE!
Thumbs up if you think every network will go direct to customer streaming. Thumbs down if you think all other stream networks will fail and Nflx will be the solo player with unlimited pricing
"If NFLX goes below $300.00Opportunity to Buy, Buy, Buy"
some analysts will put out some article to raise stock so mutual funds can dump
"There are ample movie Apps in addition to Netflix that are great. Amazon, YouTube Movies, Hulu, Pluto & more. Smart TVs are full of movie app options. They also offer global internet movies and are growing. The online movie. streaming is growing regardless of carona virus as more families have been improving their home theaters with larger TVs. The large movie theaters growth has declined due to ticket cost increases, parking & security even before carona virus arrived. It is a trend."
Hope NFLX working on the next big thing because it's original content in the US only appeals to a hairline sliver of the East and West coasts. Got to be a better way to spend 8 billion a year and they need to find it quick.
"Samsung, Netflix mobile deal https://www.cnet.com/news/samsung-netflix-mobile-deal-will-unlock-bonus-content-on-galaxy-phones/"
Always the EPS misses.
If they get 200 million subscribers. And they will get it. They will generate 20 billion a year. 15 billions for tv shows a year. That is a 1000 episodes of the most expensive episode of Game of Thrones a year. Almost 3 a day......
Maybe this Netflix should have been a buy. I don't know what I'm doing with stocks anymore.
NFLX will not miss. Expect a big numbers. Sorry shorties.
"Dropping fast, oh wait no it isn’t, lol Sorry Shorts"
"got in at $150 last May, BAM!!!!!!!"
On the shopping list today.

NFLX has a smaller market cap than TSLA. Does that seem right?
"Hahaha, i just want to laugh on the people waiting at 200."
THere it is 300
where's this 300 shorts? I'm pretty sure tour not even coming close to it
They beat international. Almost all the growth going forward is international.

"If you call your broker at lunch and he tells you to buy this dip, ask him how many shares of nflx he's bought today."
No sense in watching it continue to bleed. I’ll give it one more day to stabilize. Portfolio poison right now.
"Bubble os busting. With the financial condition is tightening, companies that rely on debt like Netflix wi have difficulty to raise cash. If they increase subscription fee, then reduce the user growth. It's a difficult time ahead."

It’s going green today after 10am start buying it’s going to start looking good.
Should close Friday at $215.00...options expiration. Next Tuesday morning open at $330.00 minimum. Good luck to all longs.
Streaming with the use of AI is a more productive way of distributing video. Netflix is the runaway leader. When it is finished claiming its market share in global TV Netflix will be one of the most profitable companies of all time.
Netflix is a real deal after Theater purchase ideas and Comcast partnering. This is going $400 PPS; This will burn shorts badly.
"NFLX is now down 30% from its high, but it's sister company Tesla is still at all-time highs. Weird. The companies are very similar....both competing in very old industries (Hollywood, Autos) while pretending to be ""tech companies,"" both endlessly cash burning, both huge issuers of junk bonds, both trading at absurd dot.com valuations, etc. So why is Tesla still near all-time highs while Netflix has crashed? Consumer Reports says Tesla is the LEAST reliable auto brand. Meanwhile people LOVE Netflix. So as both Auto Stocks AND Tech stocks have corrected, why hasn't Tesla?"
Just cancelled my NFLX subscription. This is heading to $20 soon!
Two reason: Disney is coming into the streaming field; NFLX US subscription growth is slowing down

"So far!Netflix Q1 EPS, Revenue Surge Boosted by COVID-19 Stay-at-Home Orders; Shares Down After HoursBY MT Newswires— 4:25 PM ET 04/21/202004:25 PM EDT, 04/21/2020 (MT Newswires) -- Netflix reported Q1 EPS of $1.57 compared with $0.76 a year earlier as the streaming entertainment company's business was boosted by people staying at home because of the COVID-19 pandemic.The company reported revenue of $5.8 billion compared with $4.5 billion a year earlier. The consensus estimate called for EPS of $1.64 and revenue of $5.75 billion, according to Capital IQ.The company expects 190 million global paid memberships in Q2 compared with 152 million a year earlier. It expects revenue of $6 billion and EPS of $1.81 in Q2. The consensus estimate is for EPS of $1.54 and revenue of $5.95 billion for Q2, according to Capital IQ.""Our membership growth has temporarily accelerated due to home confinement"" but as stay-at-home orders are lifted the company expects growth and viewing to slump, the company said in a letter to shareholders. Netflix expects 7.5 million global paid net additions in Q2, however ""this is mostly guesswork"" because of uncertainty around the end of home confinements."

Don’t panic longs. We will get an upgrade tomorrow or news from Netflix which will push it another $20 up. $410 Friday 
"up til 10am EST, then the sell off. yesterday's more than 6% drop with a volume of 22M shares was no joke."
What you guys think will be the price after today’s earnings?
I am holding on for $395. Willing to wait until year end if I have to. All we need is for the old NFLX to regain form.
Netflix now has a market cap larger than the total wealth of 111 of the world's 166 countries. Makes perfect sense....
the sleeping beast shall awaken once again....
WHY IS THE ENTIRE MARKET DROPPING
This is a definitely 250 $ stock in a few weeks. It was 230 last month and things have gone even worse for DebtFlix. Not sure why bagholders are buying this at these insane levels.
384.23 by 2pm
$1000 target in 3 months//
$345 by tomorrow
William Blair loves NFLX
i feel bullish here....it may reach 550 soon
I ignored netflix when it was 50 dollars but now reckon this could do 100pc in the next few months. Few percent each day grinding up slowly same way tesla did. There is no reason to stocks like this anymore.
"If Apple launch Video Streaming service on Friday. Game over all This stock. I have strong feeling that Apple will announce something like that in order to keep stock bleeding low. Specially if those IPhoneX report are real problem.If that happen this will go back to 200 easily. Be careful. Bigger Netflix price, more gain Apple get from announcement. After all, Apple already have better technology, Data (Most use Netflix on iPHone and can take over Netflix in no time."
$76 tomorrow morning.This stock is rigged.
Piper Jaffray sees strong international subscriber growth this Q. Raises PT to 420 up from 367.
Solid stock
"Just my opinion, but this decline is way overdone. Yes the PE ration is high; no doubt! But it isn't much higher than Amazon. They did predict that they wouldn't do so well in the immediate future; but as I said, it's a prediction, which at this time amounts to no more than speculation. As such, it doesn't merit a 20% decline in a little over 2 weeks."
Wow...
Don't chase this. It's over until it drops. Better pricing in 5 days.
Remember Tesla everyone bashed and it hit 2000 before the split and again they will rock. Netflix is the future and the king
This is what happen when company pressured from Investor. This is reason I say all along that Raising stock price is not good for company like Netflix. It just push company to make short term decisions that only hurt long term potential.https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2018/06/06/despite-season-2-issues-netflix-greenlights-13-reasons-why-season-3/?utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=partner&utm_campaign=yahootix&partner=yahootix&yptr=yahoo#2c33473b79ae
"MSFT much safer, little competition, next high flyer, the cloud will increase this business and stock over 50%. Little or no downside. FB still getting high growth. GOOG and AAPL also safe . Tesla, I would not touch."
pt upgraded to 480.
So what’s the word on today’s actionI think it will be a replay of yesterday dropping to 560 and then closing around low 570sWould love to see it bottom out at 530s early so I could cash in on my puts and call it a day
"Move over to IQ folks. Weak growth. Going to be weaker with higher sub costs, and new competition from T and DIS. IMO. GL"

citron research warns on NFLX
In the last 7 months we have seen 2 times the same picture and it always roared back.
Why nobody mentions the fact that $NFLX Earnings are TANKING BIG TIME????
Good late day buying signals!
"Sweet, just picked up more shares at 299!"
Hulu partnered with Sprint. Sprint has free commercial saturated Hulu for free with plan !!!!! There's your big bump in subs !!!!!
who would've ever thunk that $325 would be a buy price.
Forget about the emergin markets. Most have IPTV (Kodi) where everything is free. If you have to chose between free vs. not free and you are tight in budget the choice is very easy
a big pop like this on the day of ER? not a good sign. this will tank after hours.
could apple buy netflix?or do you think apple will go on their own on the streaming market?
Is TechStrategy still around ? He was shorting since 2011.
Only question now is does this run into the close. Why not. Finish 210.75. Next week hits 220 and 230 before ER. If that is good it's 250 by end of January.
"Netflix will post good net gains on subscribers next week. There are a lot of scared, weak-minded people who have sold and that is a good thing. It only serves to fortify the fountain, which will be stronger as we get back on the tracks and full steam ahead to new highs!"

"It's clear now, it was Netflix that opted not to renew the Disney movie deal. At the MoffetMathanson media and communication conference Sarandos pointed to new, big budget titles as 1 area where it no longer makes sense for Netflix to spend a ton of money - because if you really want to catch the latest blockbuster, you probably already saw it in theaters.""We said, maybe we can put the billion dollars we'd put in an output deal into original films"" he said."
$320.00 just around the bend!!! Shorts keep buying more please. The spring will keep getting tighter and your short positions will create a buy to cover to get out. Niiiiiccce!!

wow NFLX decides to stabilize after i buy a 600c

The whole lot of the market is red. This is holding up fine. It will pop 10% in one day. You will see. I seen it done before with a lot of other stocks.
400$ after ER or higher possible
My theory on this stock being a total POS will be vindicated
netflix has a stockpile of cash in hand they cannot lose. if they see a decrease in income they can reduce the number of shows they produce and save millions. the big funds manipulate this stock with news but long run it's gonna be a great stock. if there's no minus in front if eps it's a winner
"Down 25% since it's high, time to buy?"
Wait until tomorrow. Lol
"this will close green, mark this post"
Up up and away. Nothing can stop the rise of NFLX! If NFLX is unable to borrow they can always float a secondary offering. Think how much content they could create selling shares for more than $400. That would make NFLX worth at least $500!
Netflix: The 3 Reasons Why The Future Is Less Rosy Than The Past $NFLX https://seekingalpha.com/article/4298817
it is not the pathway Amazon is experiencing ? and if so why not Netflix!
I still contend several biggies knew about the 2B note...waited until earnings sent it higher and imediately sold before the announcement of the 2B was made. Classic insider trading. Too many knew about securing the 2B and the stock reacted VERY funny from AH’s to close the next day.
have you seen how much NFLX drops after it surges? Almost equally. Great to swing trade or if you are seriously long then we all know you got in wayyy before these price points. Point is I can't say it's a bad company but anyone buying in now or pretty much above 500s is taking huge risk IMHO. Then again a lot of the market is the same but NFLX surged way too high wayy too fast so it will correct before anything else does. And then on a big market correction day it will not be good for NFLX but great time to buy in
"From the release: ""We’re looking forward to a strongslate of global content in the second half of the year, including new seasons of some of our biggestseries, Stranger Things (July 4th), 13 Reasons Why, Orange is the New Black, The Crown and LaCasa dePapel (aka Money Heist) as well as big films like Michael Bay’s Six Underground and Martin Scorsese’sThe Irishman, and expect another year of record annual paid net adds in 2019"""

Not quite understanding the noise about Disney. Surely their content will be competing against other Disney platforms without increasing total viewing that much?Netflix has access to many providers.
"Bottom here, never will you see this price again"
Hopefully some Recovery
Disney going to get Hulu. Once that happens Netflix is done. Disney has deep pockets and Netflix has beer pockets. This news is getting overlooked and once announced you could see a drastic drop.

"So according to my research again, this is my research (my opinion). Netflix should meet its subscriber goal this quarter. How you may ask? Look for Netflix google trends, traffic analysis, and mobile app ranking overtake. In conclusion, I found that October wasn?t a smacking hot month for unique visitors. November got better. I will pause here and let you know that story changes from here. December was Netflix?s best traffic month ever in history thanks to the holidays and yes i have to give credit to bird box and bundersnatch for making that happen. Few days back a moron analyst price cut netflix from SunTrust who said it will miss. Now yes, October and November wasn?t as hot as i hoped it would be but the dude based his full conclusion from google trends. Thats the biggest mistake he made as there is a lot that google trends misses and did I point out he didn?t check December #$%$! He should be fired in my opinion or at least investigated. His words can have an impact as we live in an age of computers trading and crowd following traders we saw a 4% drop that day but later closed neutral. Google trends does not know how many people are visiting netflix domain without a G search secondly if you log in from an app it wont be able to catch that. So I also checked traffic analysis for the domain as well as app downloads. October and November again showed decent progress but nothing out of the ordinary as 9.4 million subscribers is a huge ask. Which i was worried at first but after December we might actually make it and it still could fall short. I recommend you buy here not only because of sub meet but also we are currently in a technical breakout.."

It’s an earnings day stock. Everything in between is fluff. Either up $50 or down $50 on the release.
No other FAANG stock went down as much as Netflix. 7%. I bought more today. Anxious to hear what the shorts say.
Someone are donating $ to the brokerage banks by buying $581
Begged you to buy this before ER. Said they would beat on subs and stock would rally 5%. This is predictable. Cant understand why everyone didn't do.
There seems to be a lot of angry shorts on this board.
"it is not the first time Netflix shows a slower growth, but it always get better one to two quarters later. Have faith. Netflix is king of online streaming right now and expanding globally."

I am from Europe so we don't have Disney+ nor Apple stream here yet. But i read a lot of people talking about on this board. Do they have many subscribers in the US or the rest of the world compared to Netflix 150 million? How close are they in terms of catching up? Can't find it anywhere. They must be around 100 million subscribers each orso already since everyone is boasting about them... Help?

How you going to bring up Netflix to all time highs when it didn’t even hit earnings estimates
Party’s over!
I just traded some FB for NFLX yesterday. Not too sure I'm making the right move...thoughts?
"I'm in. Small position, but I'm in."
"i bought in before september earnings last year, and yesterday just barely pushed me green "
When is the earnings?
"NASD will breach all-time high next week, then down she goes for the summer."
NFLX will open higher regardless of where it trades tonight.
Welcome 400 Friday morning

Trading the AH swings today could have made you far more profit than being long before earnings.

Way to hold up Netflix .
"Most of the guidance for this Quarter ER from CEOs will be measured and conservative, knowing that interest rates will go higher and OPEX due to inflation and tariffs. Question is will the investors take that into consideration and not react negatively as usual and bring the stocks down. I think guidance for most high growth stocks will be rather cautious and investors should adjust their expectations accordingly."
If you look at the recent transaction with att and Hulu to value Netflix you get a market cap of 90-110 billion nearly 35% below their current price
I'm hoping for a pop to $435-$440 after earnings.
I like Roku very much but seems like buying it @ $95 is like buying $NFLX @ $420... I'll just sit on the sidelines and wait.
You do realize today was another all-time closing (212.52) and intra-day (213.60) high. Got its steam back today after a one day break. We need another similar sized move tomorrow to catch up.
Let's be real if you are going to post about the price movements. There is only a 3% short interest with about a day to cover on a heavy volume day. That means they are essentially irrelevant regarding price movement. That means if the stock goes down it is because bulls are not buying at whatever level.
everybody take a deep breath and relax; add a few shares down here
Whatever your position long or short you should have reduced your exposure before they report. I cut my shares down to where I’m ready to add if it sells off. I’d rather sell shares ahead of earnings for a small loss. If it goes up I have enough shares to profit and if it goes down I can add.
Early this morning Goldman Sachs increased price target to 490 from 390 but you have to dig real hard to find the news. If it was a downgrade it would be all over the place. I've always found sentiment indicators to be the most reliable. Netflix is buy until it becomes obvious sentiment is bullish across the board.
Going all the way up
"NEW TARGET $255---Analysts at Loop Capital bumped their price target to $252 from $241, saying ""it's not too late for large-cap growth investors to establish positions.""

Morgan Stanley's Benjamin Swinburne.Swinburne upped his price target to $255 from $235 and maintained his overweight rating.

Hey guys. Netflix earnings on Thursday. Supposed to be tough 4Q is Netflix going to best earnings?
$600 coming
NFLX is grossly hammered by media and overall market: unfairly mistreated like no tomorrow: given its huge subscription growth rate in international market and potential service pricing rise: its free cash flow and EPS will be in accelerating track in 2019!
NFLX could give away free subs and burn cash for the next 10 years and this market would still reward it.
Netflix faces multiple growth challenges moving forward making its current P/E ratio of 133 difficult to justify. The company is no longer the high-flying technological disruptor of old and is slowly evolving to be a content generator or media company. The previous growth promise of technology changing our viewing habits has already come to pass such that the technology to build a streaming platform is becoming more readily and easily available.

This stock has held up and should of been to 250 without down market. I expect it will open below 250 or trade through it and accelerate. It's extremely high off 50 and 100 day and expect more downside.

Good earnings call. I recommend you all listen. They have sufficient new content for the rest of this year and next year. Good guidance. In addition they are in contact with many offers to buy content. Netflix will rule for several quarters to come. IMHO
NFLX reached a new All Time High at 264.37
"you guys have to understand that wall street controls the media sentiment and hype for companies. The""analysts"" that set price targets work for Wall street.

It is slanted towardtheir side. wall street creates bubbles in stocks on purpose and for one reason. To take your money."

"This Laura Martin certainly has a bias against Netflix. I would not be surprised if she has friends shorting the stock.She puts a ""buy"" on Roku yet a ""hold"" on Netflix. Really? Roku is not even yet profitable, has far fewer users than Netflix, and Apple+ TV and other cable companies will give away free streaming devices yet you rate Roku with a ""buy"" and $150 price target? I wouldn't trust a thing she says about Netflix losing subscribers.Netflix will be at least near $290 before earnings."
They're going to knock it out of the ballpark once again!
Set the alarm at $280 please
why is this going down?
High volume. Target 750
"I cut my cable. I got tired of paying forprograming and then having to watch 5 minutes comericals every 20 minutes. With Netflex I can watch what I want when I want with no comericals. Netflex cost me less than cable and no comericals. Plus, the content I'm offered is endless. It's still the best option for the price out there."
Wow going to green
here we go monday 600
"My concern is that the big money firms are going to walk the price down slowly over the next few weeks as they sell, so that the small investor's continue to hang in there. Kind of like the analogy of slowly raising the heat in the pot the lobster is in (lobster doesn't realize it till it's too late!). As opposed to throwing the lobster in the boiling water and have it jump out. The next few weeks will be interesting to watch."
580 soon split and keep running. They might just buy AMCX or continue licensing their content. But the minute AMCX decides to throw in the towel NFLX should allow anyone else to acquire them
90 New movies a year planned by Netflix.
"In my opinion, as a consumer, Netflix is significantly better than its rivals. They have the best offering of movies, original content, and platform. Netflix also has the largest customer base. It is a question of valuation. This stock will rise again once the short sellers have run out of opportunity and exit all of their positions. The long-term strengths are too positive here. I have 300 shares and I am down 20% right now. But there is an ancient Chinese proverb that applies here: ""The ox moves slow, but the earth is patient."""

My gut is telling me this will finally hit $600 sometime before the next ER.

Download growth also remains elevated from pre-pandemic levels, and has stabilized globally at 0%-10% in recent weeks versus down (20)%-(10)% in January/February and up 40% in early April, Anmuth tells investors in a research note.

You trade long enough, you can tellIt is up about 47% from the bottom 12 days ago and around 4% was today. Anyhow, they appear to have less than 10% growth from my calculations and a PE of 120.

That's 20% of the national total income.That's a serious issue and the entire country is in denial.So, QE4 or QE5, whatever you might imagine is likely to be muted out of necessity.

grandma sold nflx last week thursday. When grandma sells everyone sells. ha ha. I love that woman
The CEO states the obvious. No sheet your business model is in trouble. Huge debt + rising costs + declining subscribers + strong competition = bankrupt nflx
"Keep the faith longs! The bar to entry for over-the-top streaming is very high. DIS and T are trying to compete late 2019, but will take time to get any momentum going. T has not been able to monetize the assets they already have. DIS will initially be a niche player for a certain demographic, unless they start to produce their own content. Youtube premium maybe showing signs of trouble (placing ads on original content).NFLX is already anticipating the competition in 2019 and is already ahead of the game. They are arguably the best platform for the widest range of multi-screen devices. GLA"
time for 330
Nice comeback from the 3.58% drop. 2nd best day this year. It was up 26.37 (9.72%) on Jan. 4Best close since 362.44 on July 17 of last yearNow up 9.93 for the week and 26.03 for the month.
Apple not buying....I know there has been speculation they might.
What a destructive and meaningless drop today...
"Look at the plus side, things could be worse. Green indices and Blockbuster is not red. Today is equivalent to depressing the accelerator pedal but the transmission is in NEUTRAL."
"Competition in the space is only INCREASING.... going forward which makes the current nosebleed valuation for NFLX extremely difficult (impossible ?) to support.... Again, based on current NASDAQ analyst consensus estimates, TXMD-by far-has SIGNIFICANTLY.....more upside potential than NFLX going forward....The NFLX party is about to end while the TXMD party has not even started....Good luck to all "
when are the #Reddit guys get to $ROKU to make sure its in the stratosphere so that it is valued like $NFLX ?

This was totally unexpected! Let's got NETFLIX!
When did everybody get in? April '14 for me at about $44. Just keep holding on!
This is the best growth play around no reason to sit on the fence.
I figure this is a sell and buy it back next week.

We are on a technical breakout
Beef Stew!
400 by April. That’s all.
NFLX “down $50” since fake earnings
Netflix getting into gaming online
OMG WHAT HAPPENS?

"Told you to toss a coin to the Witcher, so you could be richer...."
Green today?
575 WILL COME
Well all I know is I listen to a bunch analyst this weekend on the financial shows and just about every single one of them said that Netflix at $300 a share you should back up the truck and load up as much is you can these guys work these numbers out to a science we here on this message board don’t know nothing about numbers when it comes to those guys because they live in a breathe publicly traded companies numbers
"Nasdaq Composite Tulip Mania BUBBLE got PUMPED by 170% since March 2020, despite so much terrible news, thanks to Coronavirus Pandemic. Without Pandemic Coronavirus NASDAQ Composite BUBBLE would be around 6000-7000... We need MORE PANDEMICS to PUMP NASDAQ Composite by 200% per year!!!$TSLA $NFLX"
We are back in business folks! $400 before October earnings.
"When Bitcoin was $20K, there were daily article on how he predicted such price and why Bitcoin going 30K, 40k, even 100k.People were following them like god because they seems winner of dart game. Where Bitcoin trade today."
Nice work with that $500 price target Goldman.
Netflix stock reacts as if its earnings has come out in the previous day everyday
"Goldman Sachs said $670!!! They keep upping it and think it will happen. It has never been worth more than $100, maybe $0"
The revenue generation and acceleration pushing competitors further behind...if netflix feels this is the time to raise the prices(which were inevitable to anyway with a brain0...competition il have no other recourse..the competition will have 0 edge. Z
All time high by the end of the month
Company must issue cooperate debt to pay bills. Either that or dilute
I will buy at 200
"We're in the 1st inning for NETFLIX growth, SAYS MART MAHENNY, OF RBC."
This should be no where near $350.00. This should be already $400.00 and over the top. Why are we playing games here let’s get this back where it should be $500.00.
"Netflix borrows big to produce original content which was feasible until now with low interest rates. With rising interest rates and its rising Debt/Equity ratio, big investors know the problem and will be ready to sell. Don't be fooled by the $500 price target- it's just a dangling carrot !Few Big players already took some profits when it tested PiperJaffray’s $420 price target on June 21st.This bounce above $400 is another chance for you guys to sell sell sell !$413 is the next level when it may turn negative and go down to $371"
"Forget about cryptocurrency, NFLX is a better investment."
I am issuing aggressive buy from this level
there will be definately a huge dip before going to 600
I've waited too long to buy in and I did 2 weeks ago. I'm going nowhere. for 2 years I thought it would fizzle due to competition and it just keeps on chugging.
"$NFLX falls after each Terrible ER and Guidance report! But the Government still continues to PUMP the Stock price between quarters FOR NO REASON! NFLX is LOSING subscribers and the revenue growth turns to negative, but the Absurd Valuation is not coming down!"
Almost to 280! Thanks shorts for your advise!
it is heading to $560 at today's closing
Up to now less than 20% of revenue has come from price increases. In the future over 80% of their revenue will have come from price increases.
can we make 360 next hour?
Netflix is growing in leaps and bounds around the world in new countries like China and Australia ... so many more subscribers yet to come aboard. eh
I figured it out Netflix stock price inverse’s cash flow. (Operating Cash Flow) -1.79BNext year expected to be -4 billion get ready for NFLX to double!
"It’s either a buyout or killer subscriber growth , it moving up rapid well in advance of earnings"
700 coming baby YES!!
How the heck this is up this much with earning miss
Netflix over $400 tomorrow with a late day selloff (profit takers)?
Short now thanks
No 370 today... If still green... I'm very thankful.
Looks like we are headed to 50 day moving average around 350
The market big up rally tomorrow
just added to position ;
The 200 day MA is around $475. That's a buy point.
The market is not even down that much. PURE MANIPULATION
Skuba divers are having a field day this baby going to 340 today. Enjoy the fishies.
60% 2018 gains gone
"Some nut on CNBC said 'sold half my shares, I'm still in the game"". Sounds good but how does this NUT feel now that this WINNER is up almost 9% after hours. 9% is a great gain for the YEAR let along for a few minutes!"
"The board Hater is having fun, today."
"Obama? Sell it Monday, maybe even short it. If the company can't learn anything from Hollywood or the NFL, the company is not what I thought it was. Alienating half of your viewership, or even that perception, is not part of a strong business model. The motives behind delving into propaganda makes the stability of future budiness decisions quite uncertain."
Where is the top? Loving it.!!!!
Any new info as to why NFLX goes down day after day?
"The last 2 or 3 times this stock has climbed to 299 to 300, that's normally the high for the day. After 2 pm the stock starts to tumble. They must be day trading nflx big time."
"$540 today, the last 3 days haven’t been to good but today and tomorrow will skyrocket the stock"
Good luck to all holders. Cramer hasn't done you any favors tonite on his show (personally i find the guy a blowhard... but people seem to listen)
"Disney is competition? I don’t really get this logic? Disney will have to cannibalize from its profitable business for years to ramp up its streaming platform....where is the value there? Disney is not going into the streaming business on their own accord, they are doing it because there traditional cash cow for their old movies are getting devoured by the Netflix model. The theme parks are super expensive, the dvd sales are dwindling, the old Disney cartoons are becoming obsolete, there is more risk for the next few years than value in my opinion."
540 tomorrow great short here no risk reward higher only lower
CECE should be a good paris agreement stock
Was a late winter....obvious gonna get more subscriber growth with more people staying in.
"Being a customer of NFLX, I think there is room to add other streaming service as long as the monthly total budget is less than $20. You paid a lot for cable shows in the old days. I cancelled my cable (50+ Mbps) and switch to AT&T fiber (300 Mbps), about half the price and 6x the speed. It's no brainer. So cable companies are in trouble since they used to be the only ones in my area gave you decent internet connection speed. I subscribed to cable for internet only and the cable shows I rarely watched and not subscribed with the bundle do not save much. With the saving, I'll add DIS+ to my streaming service. I believe the package is about $6.99 per month. I'll try out for one year and if I find value in them, I'll keep both. If I don't have time, I'll just keep one. So if most people think like me, then NFLX subscribers loss will be capped somewhat. Their dangers lie in adding new subscribers and future pricing increase. People new to streaming service will likely pick a cheaper package with good contents and DIS will win in this space. NFLX will have difficulty to further increase price to offset its production cost. They will be under more pressure to give up shows that don't immediately perform instead allow them time to play out more. Based on above thesis, I will not touch NFLX until one or two quarters into DIS+ have been turned on. In this market no need to take extra risks when you see it coming."
And will also be green tomorrow
"Hi, I bought 5 contracts calls at strike of 600 expired on 22 Jan. Price is 0.61 . If the stock open at 560, how much could I earn."
"NFLX is shaking out all the weak hands here. Let’s see where the share price opens on Tuesday morning. $350 or $450, I’m banking on $450. Good luck all"
"After Q1’s record breaking subscription numbers, Canaccord analyst Maria Ripps expects Netflix to post another strong report. Along with the secular tailwinds blowing at its back, the 5-star analyst points out the simple reason why she thinks Netflix will keep on outperforming.“Analysis of our proprietary Netflix content power rankings highlights continued momentum in original content: As subscribers around the world spent more time at home during Q2 due to the pandemic, and amid continued competitive intensity, the importance of Netflix's content slate has arguably gone up. It seemingly delivered, creating a consistent stream of interest and buzz around original titles,” Maria wrote.You can count the roaring success of Tiger King, crime drama Ozark, dating reality series Too Hot to Handle, and Michael Jordan docuseries the Last Dance among the titles which have kept sofa bound consumers tuned into Netflix. Add to that children content which got a meaningful boost during schools’ closures and a sizeable library of reality TV shows and docuseries, “with the two genres representing over 20% of the top 10 most popular TV series during Q2,” and you get Ripps’ point. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/netflix-original-content-library-separates-005355727.html"
Tomorrow should open at $390’s
Fed will signal rate cut today and stock will rally big this afternoon.
netflix beat the street by 73 cents a share. Way cool. Subscriptions up 1.7m.
"With tariffs now in place on most other goods, a Netflix subscription looks relatively cheap, maybe the company should consider raising subscription fees next year. JMHO"
What a comeback

"I love all the little haters on here, maybe if you keep saving your allowance you'll be able to buy one share of the great NFLX...."

360 today close..
Any opinions on how high this can go? I only own 100 shares but a lot for me. Thanks
we are in the manic stage of the bull mkt those who dont know how to make money in a sideways/ declining mkt better enjoy these days before it all comes to an end. This won't last forever
I figure a real world PE for a stock like NFLX should be about 45.....which would mean a stock price of around 125 bucks.
To be holding up today is a good sign. Not expecting green to hold today in this market.
it only takes a few days like today for it to get back to $400 :)
"HI, GUYS, THE 5 DAY CHART LOOKS PRETTY GOOD IF YOU BOUGHT UNDER $240, IT IS TIME TO SELL THE RALLY IN NFLX , netflix is now $273.10 intra day, max pain will push netflix down to $265"
We are back above Tuesday's lows already!
Lol yesterday it was up after hours and open down. Today down after hours up tomorrow
This is worth a quarter trillion dollars about as much as my house is!
I’m seeing here same lame comments that I saw in Tesla when it was at 250$ a month ago. Look at it now. Netflix will bounce up in no time. Did it before and will do it again.
lower highs and lower lows...
I really hope Netflix perseveres. FANG without it would be awkward...
Can we break resistance tomorrow? Decided to enter a short term trade based of bullish in engulfing on one day charts
360 today ?
Small Fortunes are being made on this stock today (by being Long).
beginner long term investor here. with the high PE I don't know if i should buy at high price. any suggestions????Im not a day trader. thanks everyone!
it looks to have finally broken through that resistance! let's see tomorrow
"Sorry all you nflx investors , should have gotten on the ROKU train ... though you guys still own a very solid company and the leader in its industry "
This is excellent Results. Netflix has absolutely no competition. That is why growth is coming like awesome! World wide domination!
looks like it's going to 390
confirmed with support and higher highs strength is going up as we speak by open tommorrow well be barley red or green love how charts work most don't get them they all rely on news and opionion charts matter so much to risk mitigating
Thumbs up if you're up over 100% on the most awesome stock ever!!! :). I'm thumbs upping this post myself as I eclipsed 100% a few weeks ago...
"I do not post often, first of all. anyone posting Netflix is not a buy, has obviously shorted the stock. Netflix is a Buy, unless you woke up and thought the sky is falling."
Shorts better cover now
NFLX burning through cash and debt increasing while the Wall Street crowd wants you to focus only on subscriber growth. I’m not even sure I believe the subscriber numbers any longer. Mostly international growth only. And the numbers still include the free trials. That’s not true “subscribersl
These bears that have been predicting total destruction each quarter have been saying this since Netflix was 50 bucks. Now its 600% higher in a few years and on the cusp of hitting a new gear in growth with India and with a lower tax rate. What credible evidence is out there that all of the sudden this is going to reverse course? It's not happening gents. $400 by end of year easily.
$NIO $GOOG $NFLX $WIMI this market is definitely a sight to see. It baffles me that people are short right now
$580+ tomorrow?
"Even if The Nasdaq is down, if a company does well there is no reason to justify a 9% swing in price from its high yesterday to what it is today. Hell, on a price to percentage loss basis, neither FB or AMZN came anywhere near to losing what this did, and this company just beat earnings forecast by 30%."
"Unfortunately for Netflix the vast majority of their content is licensed from other production companies. If that weren't bad enough, what original content they do have is actually mostly producted by these same content providers, CBS, Viacom, Paramount etc. With so many parties now entering into the streaming business production costs are now running at 30% above previous costs. This certainly can not be good for Netflix. When you consider they just signed agreements for Seinfeld for over $500 million for 5 years and they actually just stated that they were committed to spending over $17 billion next year on content. If you look at their finances you will see actual shareholder equity of $6.8 billion. How can any company with $6.8 billion of shareholder equity be valued at $136 billion stock capitalization? We keephearing about the growth in foreign pamrkets, but Netflix refuses to breakdown revenue by markets."
Recovering nicely! Back to previous high in no time!
That's it. I'm buying WMT for its streaming business
"Just think, this thing is climbing and we still have more than a week before earnings."
cancelled my subscription
420 tomorrow
This earnings is good will go to 500
People missed the boat yesterday
So is subscribers really going to be this good to justify 120x earnings?
"I would be interested in the subscribers added that are not part of the Sprint / T mobile merger. Anybody have those numbers, because the growth for next quarter is the issue if they are a result of Sprint."
Time to buy... it's now dropped too far.
no one is safe anymore
Maybe this is where MSFT begins to see an entry point for an acquisition of NFLX while the stock is depressed and Porter Bibb's prediction becomes reality.
I predict -$10 on early Monday (6/25/18). It went up on speculations and will go down because of lacking fundamental reasons to support current price.
market major correction on trade wars and White House turmoil no stock is safe especially Netflix the ultimate momentum stock
How will Trump response to China?1) Do nothing2) Shake hands with China and make peace3) Hit back with additional tariffs4) Something else...Give your thoughts and how do you think the market will react.
The stock ran ahead of growth. Now growth has caught up and the stock is getting ready to run ahead again.

I am thinking its because netflix has no china exposure? I see GOOGL and FB who is also banned in china are in green?
Trying to break 400
440 coming.
I bought some nflx for the first time. You have to buy something that goes up everyday. This is the simpleness strategy and therefore most beautiful strategy. people watch it shaking their head and some even go short it. But this is the contrarian method of investing. You trust the action only and not the opinion.
Lol what? Is the fed printing directly into Netflix's stock or something? Who is possibly buying at these levels? This company IS NOT worth more than Disney in any universe.

I picked up a 362.5 call today expiring Friday for $4.88. It's now doubled but i have some questions. Put options are crazy expensive right now and their implied volatility is through the roof.

People love movies NFLX and IQ should rocket
"Guys, do you think AT&T report tomorrow will affect us?"
lol it doesn't want to go down
Back up after hours i think i found the one
"Why Netflix could surprise to the upsideThere are number of reasons why Netflix could deliver better-than-expected results next Tuesday. The COVID-19 pandemic was a key driver of the surge in the first half of the year when it added 25.9 million subscribers. In October, when the company offered that guidance, the pandemic was much more controlled than it is today. In the U.S., daily new cases went from about 60,000 to more than 200,000 today, while new infections similarly spiked in Europe, prompting lockdowns in countries like France and the U.K., as well as incremental measures in parts of the U.S., like Southern California and New York.That rise in cases is likely to have driven similar growth in subscriptions the way the initial outbreak in the spring did.The company also said it would�raise prices�in the U.S. at the end of October from $12.99/month to $13.99/month on its most popular membership option. While that move was widely expected, it shows management's confidence in both its long-term growth trajectory and the performance in the fourth quarter. A 2019 price increase caused Netflix to report a slight decline in subscribers in the second quarter, but that was during a seasonally slow quarter. Also, it was a larger price hike, as prices went up by $2 then compared to just a $1 hike last year. It also proved to be a temporary speed bump as it returned to steady growth in the following quarter.Additionally, there's evidence of a streaming boom across the industry in the fourth quarter.�Disney�reported that it added 13 million subscribers in the two months leading up to the beginning of December, while streaming aggregator�Reelgood�noted ""massive growth across the board,"" though it did say Netflix's leading market share declined from 25% to 22% among Reelgood's 2 million users.Finally, Netflix rolled out another strong slate of content in Q4.�The Queen's Gambit�was a surprise hit globally, sparking a surge in chess interest around the world, and the company also seems to have scored victories with the first season of�Emily in Paris, which was already renewed for its second season, and Season 4 of�The Crown, one of its strongest franchises. Towards the end of the quarter on Dec. 25, the company also released the first season of�Bridgerton, Shonda Rhimes' first production for the service, which has also received critical acclaim.Data from Reelgood shows that five of the top 10 streaming movies in the fourth quarter were released on Netflix, including�The Haunting,�Hubie Halloween,�Mank,�The Trial of The Chicago 7, and#$%$ Elegy."
You knew that when this stock was holding strong on down market days that it could explode higher with up markets. Such is the case. Love that NLFX hanged tough on down markets.
stock buyback will add 200/shr.
340 coming
What will be the $360 puts worth tomorrow?
Easy money on this..
Just went trough the upcomming Netflix shows trailers in the app. It's just incredible what a spectrum of programming they offer. Something for everybody. Insane...I'm proud to own shares of this compagny...
"Shorts better cover, this will explode"
So upset today i bought 3 put of nflx355 and fb 5 cc 175 and 1 amzn 1825. sold all at 9:35 am this moring . i had the motherload on nflx and decided not to be greedy for the first tine today. Sold my 3 nflx 355's for $7.75 close at $21.I actuall bought some calls a liitle early today . I think it will bounce tomorrow but it will go lower . probably will hit under 300 .

Amazing how the stock sentiment changes so fast
"450 this week, possible ?"
Tomorrow will be a great day for NFLX!
after hrs +$20.00
Cant even hold positive earnings. It’s way too hyped and overpriced
To infinity and beyond!
Do people think that Netflix has basically saturated its market and that we are going to see little growth over the next few years?
"trade ""war"" can hurt them in that they may not get entry into countries they might have a fee for viewing, a tariffthe cash flow isn't so hot, that would mess them upthe trade stuff is important and a good idea, but it will hurt in the beginningTrump is rightthose that complain are wrong"
This is going to split
"somebody just bought 95,000 shares.. wow"
NFLX $550 BEFORE EARNINGS!!! Look at the yearly chart and you'll see 
The main thing Netflix is not saying about its huge miss with subscribers loss is the fact many people including me dropped Netflix due to Netflix signing a 50 million dollar deal with the socialists Obama's. That SOB added over 10 trillion to our nations national debt of 20 trillion. All Obama has to show adding over 10 trillion debt to the backs of Americans is nothing except a weaker military when he left office. Netflix will continue to go down once more in stock price when more Americans find out about Netflix signing up the Obama's to give us there socialist opinions. Sell short and you will make money.
"I think it is a buy at these levels. Netflix is the best for kids. We have Netflix and Amazon prime now, and did a trial of Hulu. Netflix is practically unlimited for kids and has too much for a grown up to park their #$%$ in front of in good conscience. Getting the amazon firesticks has made both Netflix and Amazon more accessible, still my kids use 95% Netflix. They kind of gave up on amazon after trying to search and running into non-free content. Amazon tries to make you watch trailers as well. Same thing with Hulu, they never figured it out and even I had a hard time finding stuff that didn't suck and clunky to navigate (it was a couple years ago). I cant bring myself to go back to commercials either. I spent this whole summer staying in a hotel during a work assignment and flipping channels was a waste of time besides getting caught up on naked and afraid and fix or flop."
"sold 1 shr at 379, keeping the last 3 shrs! This is a tough stock..."
Netflix never misses two quarters in a row. Congrats longs!
"Folks, who fuss about OBAMA, Reid, Pelosi, Clintons,etc having content on nflx etc, do you really think people are that politically motivated in their spending habits. Do u think they won't for example, not eat at a restaurant because it is ""run by Democrats"" or something like that?"
"I am a current subscriber of Netflix. However, once Disney rolls out their own streaming platform, I will take my business to them. Unless Netflix provides Live TV, I am not leaving SlingTV.

$593 or $560? Which one? Was $575 like a year ago. Nice “investment”.
$500 tomorrow. #Conditioner predicted this!
bought this thing at 570 and have been a bag holder since...
It is not a trap it is a bubble that will come down hard.
"Alright, nflx has found support above 300 for the time being."
This sell off is ridiculous

"Take over the world, Netflix"
LOWER LOWS MEANS WHAT?
WOW
"bought at 97, have ridden with it through ups and downs.......this will be no different..............GLTA"
"This pop is irrational, I am a long holder, don't ge me wrong I love it but there's no way it can be justified. Much better earnings reports of Netflix have yielded much smaller gains. This is part of the insane market right now. I wish it wasn't but it will correct."
"She helped [and I mean directed] spy (without a warrant) on a U.S. citizen and then wrote a CYA memo while Trump was getting inaugurated. She will be lucky if she is not one of the people indicted in the FISA court abuse scandal (it was not just the FBI) that is unraveling. The Benghazi stuff is old hat compared to her toxicity on the FISA scandal. Netflix, drop her now. The worst parts of the scandal will be where she is committing felonies by unmasking the names of US citizens such as Michael Flynn to the NYT and WA Post for pure politics."
Will Netflix beat the earnings??
Another $1 trillion market cap company in the next 5 years. Yes !
Nice time to buy.
will this hold at 330 till tomorrow ?
Beast of a stock. Never imagined this would rally about 45-50% in a few weeks. Wow!!!!
Never sell on weakness of the people trying to scare you out of your money.
Great day to buy more Netflix before earnings! Love this company! YTD 32.45% gain 
"every since we sold our LONGS on NFLX when first broke 405 on 6/19, we logged a very nice run of 60 points from 345-405 (and plenty more in past 3 years), since 6/19 we have logged well over 50 points on shorts, after each runup and pullback (some 5 points and some like today we got 15 points intraday). So, after earnings we expect NFLX to initially dump below the 378 support, probably 350-365 range. We will then go LONG again, ride it back up 50-70 points to alltime highs. This is SWING TRADING folks, way more profits in long-run, and we dont risky losing equity on huge pullbacks, we actually capitalize on shorts when investors are running for the hills. If you wanna truly learn our system, you know where to go..."
Subscriber growth missed for second quarter in a row........stock will come down tomorrow!!

May I have a dividend please? What... No positive EPS. Sounds like a dot com
520 by Friday
NFLX is one of the greatest stocks of all time.
Gave it all back as per usual...Its like you never had a good earnings beat. Absolutely hilarious
"Is netflix business model recession proof in your opinion, when things are not as good, consumers retreat to there televisions and movie and series content, to save cost of other activities that are much more expensive?? Opinions are welcome thanks!!"
They have so many tools to pumps these stocks. They can make it go wherever they want.
Is there any upside left?
"Average P/E of an SP 500 stock is around 12.9. NFLX's going-forward P/E is supposedly 129. Thus, NFLX's P/E is around 10 times the average P/E of an S&P stock. So, NFLX should be trading at 1/10th its current price, or around $34 per share, to be on an even par with OTHER S&P 500 stocks."
"Comcast announced earnings today and ""Management said on the earnings call that it expected accelerating cable TV subscriber declines"""
Crushes expectations...down 25%...makes no sense. Institutions are buying cheap while instilling fear in the clueless
"It is trading in a very tight range $326.25 - $328.50. Strange, as if a tug of war going on, like a coil, if it breaks thru on the up side we can see short term $345."
"As a die-hard long, I live for days like this!"
Seeking Alpha article says the PE should only be 40and that puts NFLX worth $165 per sharesell
It’s not a loss until you sell
I placed $2500 on PUTS and $2500 on $600CALLS. Best way to play earnings. 1000% profit here I come.
"Netflix is not only streaming service, it is international movie studio. So much content coming."
UP 3.4% deal happening
"As I said, wait on market down days to get in low 500s. Market in general is going crazy. be careful."
NFLX will see 195 by xmas.
Traded down all week...watch for SEC investigation for insider trading.
370 TODAY COME BIG BALLERS START BUYING WE GOT THIS
2 week work.... dop in one day...
"ACCUMULATE THE OCTOBER/NOVEMBER CALLS CHEAPER AS NFLX GOES LOWER.OCT/NOV CALLS WILL SOAR AHEAD OF OCTOBER EARNINGS. BUY LOW, SELL MUCH HIGHER. "
sure wish trump would make some random tweet about a yuuuge new round of tariffs.

I'm out. Pretty much lost it all. you might as well sit on the sideline for now
I wouldn’t be surprised if it gaps up $5-$10 tomorrow.
I’ve had Netflix for a long time and I think they need to look to make more money off the subs somehow or this thing is going to start going down
One way or the other this company is a pioneer with no actual competition at the moment.Netflix set the new rules to everyone in Hollywood and the whole movie/series industry worldwide. 500 by year end.Good luck longs
Netflix cannot continue to lose billions each year while claiming to have wonderful content. When are they required to writedown the value of all the cancelled series and movies that no one viewed?
Barely makes targets and stock goes up 10%. Talk about delusions!Next qtr's numbers are being goosed by the increased prices but for how long!
Shorts throwing everything in final tantrum?
Netflix is giant king streaming in the world
"Netflix's latest earnings indicate strong growth will continue and margins will improve. However, most of the good news is already baked in the price."
"An open farce, content up $1.2B to over $13.3B and amortization. exp up $100M. Try to sell some of that $13.3B content and see what you get. Auditors went along with it when it was small and now they can't backtrack."
"Netflix would be unbeatable if they acquired a broadband company. If you want people to completely cut the cord, offer Internet + Neflix outside of any cable or dish program. I would jump on that in a minute. I hate having to pay my cable provider for Internet just so I can use Netflix."
Buying opportunity??
What’s going here ? All of sudden goes up any clue?
"Amzn all time high , Netflix should follow suit . Come on 405 pm"
Hey guys dnt ever sell ur shares after reading this chat board...people who are saying nflx will down are either shorting it or are regretting not getting on the train early on.. it will go past 615 next week without any doubt. Dnt forget nflx is buying back their shares. Goddluck!
Keep your arms and legs inside until the ride comes to a complete stop......
CFO is Out! Good move. Direction of company can now move into a positive direction. David Wells was engaged in asshatery of epic proportions. Joy to the World!
Ive been burned so many times by Baron’s predictions in the past. They should be banned.
GS 500 price target. Long gap up.
I smell 270..
beginning multiple. sell days
"Shareholders!You have the right to sell options on your stock. These are called "" covered calls"".If you sell Jan 2020 calls you can pocket $80 to $100 in tax deferred cash a share until trade is closed out."
Rate of fall will accelerate
what is current multiple on NFLX??????????????????????
The gift that keeps on giving
This is a joke after a stellar ER! Disgustin! :/
I guess the big buyer is gone. And DEBT will be a topic when we see tomorrows FED statement. I sold with this week 8% up :))))
so are they posting at 12:05 or after the bell? Yahoo says 12:05 and an article on e trade says after the bell.
"Netflix and Wimi went up too much last week, and it's going to adjust this week."
"Obama says don’t worry we are now a socialist enterprise and will now share the wealth equally except for my $50 millionWe will use your money to produce enriching content on topics like diversity, white privelage, gender identity, and social justice Wokeness not profits is the goalSee you at 200"
"All these people thinking the stock will rise tomorrow, you’re delusional. Newsflash: we’re in a bear market. These last two week will be a blip in the radar on the road down, we’re going much much lower than December’s lows very soon. 8 years of artificially low interest rates built up a massive asset bubble, it’s already popped"
Someone is buying a lot. I see it going to $350.00. Could be tomorrow or Thursday. I’ve seen this pop 5 to 10% in 1 day. Love Netflix
"Overvalued by any measure, projections are just that, projections, 20 times earnings get this to the real value of 50 per share."
Then next quarter Netflix will announce that they lost 8 of the 8.5 million subscribers which they added this quarter and the stock will take a 20% nose dive. I'm so sick of this stock going up & down like a Yo-Yo. That's why I took it out of all of my clients' portfolios.
"Blast off at bell. Shorts, thanks for covering."
NFLX's loudest detractors continue to be the ones who fear owning it. They will fear buying it at 300 and 200 because the valuation will still be too high for them.Every great company that has ever irreversibly changed the world has stumbled along the way. NFLX will have another stellar quarter eventually and to those burying it today will watch from the sidelines again.
short it... you might get lucky. but more likely you gonna lose money!
Presifdsdsf4 days ago$NFLX conversationI bought 1000 stocks at 405 with margin and paying interest daily. What should I do?ReplyReplies (24)45
At $331.61 the 200 day average is critical for tomorrow. If it breaks it and closes above it we will see $350 before earnings
net profit up 10% in the quarter thank you Microsoft
"this stock reminds me of amazon - the talking heads say that the valuation makes no sense, and they would never invest in it - but the stock continues to climb for years. I'm sorry I didn't invest when I saw the writing on the wall 8 years ago."
"We need more DEM wits without a brain to way over pay for NFLX LOL,LOL You just can not make this stuff up as NLFX is now having customers dropping NFLX in droves because everyone is now getting FREE HBO MAX with their unlimited cell plans from T LOL,LOL,LOL"
First 4-day losing streak since going 6 days in the read from April 18-25
robinhooders know what will follow tomorrow and they all rush to catch the traintomorrow will open 600
Wow selling tomorrow
370 coming.
"What happen why its dropping, any news?"
Easy tomorrow another 20.00 upward from after earnings. 420.00 better try to buy tomorrow before the open.
"Buy, buy, buy!!!"
Let rock for the day
"I don’t see $400 today, let’s not get overly exuberant."
I love the fact the media is playing Netflix like it's the whole market.
Still no stampede to the exits. Not enough volume. Expect it to be propped up before close.
This thing could go up to 360 tomorrow. Shortsville is boiling over now.
"""Scale is the most important factor in the media industry."" ""Scale is very, very powerful."" John Malone."
Might we see 580 tomorrow?
If growth keeps up in this pace and with this price hike they start to generate money end of this year or next year already instead of 2021.
whenever I need a laugh I come here and look at shorts talking about how NFLX is about to crash 
If I buy more this will drop tomorrow. If I sell out today it'll skyrocket tomorrow morning. This one is tricky.
"Netflix has a hard choice. Adding ads will lose subscribers. no ads, revenues could not cover expenses. Nflx is either combatting with no ads. or with ads streaming competitors. It is difficult to hold on current price"
"Netflix just said in call that in 2020, the plan is to take over the earth.."
Will open at $410 tomorrow morning and will run up to $420
"What a JOKE! They are PUMPING $NFLX MEGA BUBBLE again, Despite Falling Earnings!"
420 todayalso Netflix will hit $420
75 cents though probably not real as they plan on borrowing $12 billion or whatever it is$3/$417 = > PE 190so the forward pE looks likke 190 instead of 90sell time
If Germany throws a tariff on Netflix then it goes down another $50. It is only a matter of time before some foreign government figures out that they can make 10 to 20% off Netflix.
STCN - next 5x
Good odds they beat expectations. Over the last 7 ER they missed only once on international by 0.2M subscribers and beat 6 times with an average beat of 1.3M subscribers.
What you all think will it best earnings? And stock will jump?
Yeeey green
"25000 call options expiring this Friday, $600 strike. Someone knows !"
looks like 50 plus tommomrow?
to the moon we go
"netflix will continue to voo away cable customers from dish, timewarner, charter, etc there is practically no stopping them for the next 5 years. They use cutting edge cloud platform technology for providing ever improving plethora of streaming options at ultra HD quality of all shapes and sizes of devices. they will strike many more media partnerships in near future to establish their hold in the world."
"Wow, all the earnings gains are gone."
It's kinda simple. When you think yourself of which streaming service is best Im sure 90% of people say netflix. Their decision to make a lot of (great) content is going to pay off as it has already. No one else (besides maybe HBO) is making new successful content like they are.They are building studios in countries around the world. Lets not forget the global marketplace.
"The shorts are working hard to prevent NFLX hitting $350 this week, but they will fail! See you at $350 soon!"
Buying more
Shorts better cover-this thing is about to fly
a 10-15 dollar haircut is in order
Thumbs down to Netflix price increases! I may have to drop it for awhile and try Hulu.
"Bohemian Rhapsody, dead pool, Glass. AVATAR 2-5(COMING) This is Disney content. They bought 21st century fox to put a strong hold on content. Then you got bird box...."
"Did anyone do the math for India? You seriously think they will spend 1% or 800 rupees of their yearly (44,000) income PER month on Netflix?"
Bulls bears and pigs know this thing USB’s about to tank. The most shorted stocked rebounded the most. Everyone knows how questionable this business model is. 108 PE as of today ... I got my whole account short NFLX and if somehow goes higher I’m doubling down with margin
Debtflix has an enterprise value of $168 billion with no free cash flow in sight for years. This stock has enormous downside.
I am watching PE ratio everyday and wonder how high it can reach before it crashes.
"NFLX becoming cash flow positive is a major blow to the shorts’ thesis. This is despite coming competition from DIS. This tells me that not only will the two coexist without cutting each other’s throats, they will be like Coke and Pepsi. They target different markets so there is no bear case to be made here. $600 a share will be here soon."
So sell or hold? Verdict please less than an hour remaining
$375.00's tomorrow and more
it's only going high shorts. big investors are adding to their position. FANG
Buy buy
MM won't let it go higher today because of calls sold. Next week it goes higher again and calls will be sold for end of week. 520-530 possible next week.
Above 265 is possible tomorrow and above 270 on Friday.
Wfh stocks will rally this coming quarter. This is where you want to be! This things a beast even when corona is not a thing
407 for tomorrow sure
"Simple math, this is going down. Algo is recovering the amount of loss. Imagine going down from 343 to 300 that is big hit. Now it will be 363 to 343. Thats how it works."
"based on charts and current news events, expect NFLX to drop back to $300 and below; AAPL back to $180 - $190.SPY down this week to 260-265agreed?"
God please help the longs
Oh look. Everything is Ok now.
"Netflix has a finger on the pulse of what the general public wants. If you check social media, there are memes being created and shared by the thousands about Netflix content. Hulu and Netflix both put out Fyre Festival documentaries. I don't know a single person who was talking about Hulu's. Critics talk about how the Adam Sandler movies and Bird Box were awful. That's true, but it doesn't matter. Because the general public consumed the content in record breaking numbers. I think people miss the bigger picture with this company."
I don't see what's so great about this anymore...they have some good original content but that's it...they are gonna eventually loss most other good content and they don't do anything special everyone knows how to stream content I never had a problem with disney ....maybe it's worth $100
never fear netflix rules
Do u think we will beat
not worried at all as long as im in at 332 over 2 years selling half at 660
Hey now!
425 today
If you buy a put or call regardless of action the options will drop.. 100+ implied Volatility
Looking like a beat has leaked....sorry shorts
This needs to start kick like amazon. Everyday green. Let’s start the fire back on. This should be 600.00
"NFLX moves into the S&P 100.I'm new to this stock, is this known prior to today..?"
"If this doesnt fall more then 3.5% in AH, chances are it will be green tommorow"
can anyone tell me what Amazon's p/e is? thank you
Setting up nicely for mid-week rally after big tech earning announcements AH on Wed.
Short
Down volume picking up in premarket
"Uh oh... Roku going into the streaming business to compete with Netflix. They say their service is incredible. Roku will their tech embedded into every TV, which Roku TVs are awesome."
Every dollar drop means I lose 20k :(
Don’t worry buy more. Netflix is the best with what they do.
"Netflix price target raised to $670 from $575 at BofA, BUYBofA analyst Nat Schindler raised the firm's price target on Netflix to $670 from $575 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares. The analyst is taking a ""cautious stance"" on subscriber growth heading into Netflix's Q3 results on October 20 but believes the long-term story is ""stronger than ever."""
There are zero examples of entertainment or tech companies EVER maintaining multiples like this with this kind of debt load. Debtflix has nothing in common with the cash generating juggernauts that make up the ither FANG stocks. They just needed an N for the acronym so it wouldn’t be politically incorrect.
lmao how many shorts do you think lost all their gains from October with the NFLX comeback? no wonder they're all here sharing their salty tears
Im afraid with the price this low somebody is going to buy us up-AAPLToo bad would love to see this double in the next 2 years
Terrified shorts posting week-old articles...
I heard NFLX is gonna introduce infant twerking......Biden loves this stuff
Blues are winning
"The story remains the same. The majority still have $100/mon pay TV and are shifting over in accelerating numbers, along with their $billions freed up from pay TV, to better value streaming services where Netflix is the leader. Hold on tight. Don’t let them separate you from your shares."
"10,000 calls, $550 strike expiring this Friday. Let's go !"
Thanks Barack Hussein
I sold 1000 sold shares and bought IQ.
There is no reason for this stock to slow anytime soon. Next earnings will rocket this past 600
market is rigged. They try to pump this stock up even after $2B debt notes. Unbelievable sheet.
LONGS ARE WINNERS! THAT'S JUST REALITY!
how long before we're back north of 400?
Just remember the negativity spread during last ER and rest was history.
"I'll have my money in GOOGL and Disney and netflix. Why? Because, if disney loses out to Comcast, which is hated, then I see Disney doing a deal with Netflix or Googl. Disney has worked with Netflix in the past. Not to buy then out but to work together once again. Googl could also work with netflix and has the money to buy them out. Oh yea, lets not forget about apple. They have the money to purchase Netflix as well."
CNBC just reviewed the Ican and Ackman brawl. I remem ber Ican said he sold nflx year and half ago citing competition. Boiy he sold too early. All the shorts who took his selling as a sign to short were wiped out. LOL
"thats all???? all the cries for 30 bucks under a share? if you look any farther than a day, week and even a month... nothing to worry. to big of a company to fold after a bad qtr. and u know what, not as bad of a report than many talk about. invest.... and go live your life. do not check any stock on hourly basis. not healty down the road"
The stock will increaseEverybody stand on Netflix
just buy like always
Beware of ER and EPS missed
14m people dropped cable tv last year. Next year it is expected to boom to 47m. Those cutting the cord will be buying both Disney and netflix-both will be winners. A lot cheaper than that 100.00/mo cable bill.
$400 by Friday
Netflix is in the green.
Does anyone remember what happen to zoom after earnings?
"Markets are going to close very, very strong today. Looks to end at highs of the day and of course highs of the week, month, year, and decades!!!"
"Mtvx electric scooters, Future World FWDG, COWI, RTON,DRNK, APTY stock market software"
"Just remember - tomorrow is 'window dressing day"" for money managers. Last day of the month trading. You can expect the unexpected as managers either flee stocks or do what they can to prop them up. Trade at your own peril"
"Rise hot air balloon, rise! There is no limit to how high you can go!"
Short squeeze tomorrow is going to be epic!
BLOATED. The market will correct. Expecting a decline of 20% or more.
should I short ntfx or wait till tomorrow
"short cover first at 340, it looks like it is not safe to short tomorrow"
"So let me get this right. For the price of Netflix. You could buy Ford, General Motor and Tesla? Is that correct? Is it really that insane? A friend of me told me this"
"best to not short moore this is the most profitable for retailer long in history, they will take it up 20-30-40 usd just to knock out short one day after earning, even if the ernings is bad."
"Well, it may be time to grossly recalibrate my thinking about what a company is actually worth. If Tesla is allowed to have a negative 12 dollars EPS and can rally 4 percent today, then I guess we can justify Netflix at a price of 10,000 per share; just like bitcoin. Why not? Boy, bonds are starting to look real good to me."
er before market?
"Content providing is becoming me too! NFLX will be forced to switch to an ad revenue sharing model, or suffer a slow painful decline..."
thank you for letting me buy today with a nice discount
For all of you shorting it... I think you are a little late to the party.
happy for now however Netflix should learn from cable companies mistakes that price and product matter. increasing cost without increasing service result in declining interest.
I will get back to my old profits if this goes above 310. Hopefully that happens by Tuesday!
"new highs are inevitable. pension, hedge funds, and fan boys will make it so."
Look at NFLX rally!!! GO NFLX GO!!!
Down $25 in a month. Will be down $100 by June
"To increase growth, you need better content. I was upset that one of my favorite shows was taken off. More content investment equals more cost. Which may or may not payoff."
"want to short at 260, some one keep buying to push it there"
what do you how far netflix go
NFLX momentum==1. ER2. FANGS stock in uptrend now!
Here is a good reasonablee article regarding Raymond James belief on the sector. This is a real “expert” and knowledgeable person than the paid pumping by garolou on here. It’s dangerous to listen to paid pumpers. This article is not anti NFLX. It’s positive on NFLX.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-strong-subscriber-growth-hulu-221203720.html
Look at the 3 year performance of Deutche Bank!!
Netflix shows down to negative time to race to my computer to SELL as the us markets fall even IBM stock is DOWN after earnings my golly how will all this effect the market tomorrow? I must sell to be safe.
NFLX reached a new All Time High at 320.10
Some gains will be taken next week (new tax year) and this should push price lower.
AMC THEATRES TO OPEN !! $GME $NFLX $CHTR $T over to $AMC Movie theatres to open in NY$DIS $DISCA $CHTR $T $AMCX $NFLX $CMCSA $CABO $ATUS $WOW
Was a fake pump premarket and that squeezed shorts. No one is buying at these levels. Need to go to 500 to make it attractive.
Deutsche Bank is the most heavily sanctioned and penalized global bank. Record fines for manipulating and distorting markets.
Short squeeze
my loss is now $28K so sure getting into uncomfortable level but some reason I am not feeling concern. Not good thing because I keep thinking to short more and use my buying power which now lowest of last 2 month. Need to keep writing - follow principle to control my mind.
"NFLX will beat. The way things are, more people want to ""Netflix & chill"" the world over."
something is burning ....
"SWING SWING SWING...I warned you guys...and I offered my levels. but no one listens on hear, i only get bashed EVEN WHEN IM RIGHT 100% of the time.....FYI, 90% of swing trading is knowing the stock market. Guess what levels wll hit next on NFLX in next two session when S&P500 drops another 1-2%....you guys seriously need to start swing trading with us"
CIDM stock is a better streaming play right now!! they just aquired the indian version of NETFLIX and have annouced a new streaming app

"Ok , I'm giving everyone a fair warning. I'm about to buy NFLX for the first time ever. Usually when i buy a stock, it goes down immediately. You've been warned. "
"It’s all about content spend, Disney has to quadruple just to catch up to Netflix which is way ahead and has almost zero content spending"
What time are earnings happening today? is it after the close?
$500 soon. Sleep on that!!
You can think of NFLX like a roulette wheel - for every 18 reds there are two greens.
netflix nears China deal.
"The sharks are circling, PE and P/B are screaming 2000, I give this market 3 months and all the fresh marks will go down like they did back then. just a matter of time."

"Interesting, with the company hiring Susan rice, many will cancel their service, many don't like her from the Obama administration.Enjoy this ride for now next month will be different!"
"14% jump in a 200b company, yep, bull market is almost over"
With all the price target increases to 650+ this'll be 600 tomorrow.
Final trade yesterday on CNBC - sell NFLX. How's that working for you?
Nearly 300 PE...Seems legit.

RBC Capital raised PT to $440 today. i wonder how it will react
UP 20% In After Hours Trading!!!!
Netflix might become the next Hollywood for actors and actresses.
Netflix fundamentals hitting on all cylinders:1. Cord cutting is accelerating.2. Competing streaming services losing billions.
Run Forrest run. Shorties better run for cover cause 600 here we come.
Enjoy the ride boys and girls. Wish I were on it...Congrats!!
"NFLX is a great idea and a great company. It is just that it's stock price has become bloated. This is just a modern version of a cable network (TW or Comcast but does not own the pipe to your home so can't sell other services), so it is more like a broadcasting company ABC or NBC with less content, albeit perhaps more entertaining. So how does it garner a market cap equal to 75% of Disney's who's content rakes (as well as other streams of revenue) 5 times the top line revenue of NFLX and 6 times NFLX earnings. This bloated pig of a stock will trade below $100/share probably below $50 during the next downturn."
omfg it's going green Netflix 395.66 today
it will split at 500+
nflx will open $362 on 4/30/19 and will touch $350 by Friday this week
"Netflix is the new Hollywood. I don’t get why theres so many shorts on this board. Investors know Netflix will be around in 20 yrs and it’s currently stealing all of the cinemas best writers and actors. If you’re not making a superhero movie, you go to Netflix. If you want to make an hbo series independently, you go through Netflix. The company had too many hooks in the industry and it will be the number 1 studio"

Netflix will be 350 by end of day tmr and 400 by august
I left with 400 short as my 295 put not exercised (lucky $600 gift) I cover 100 at 289 and now shorted 2 282.5 put for $5 premium.Still have 100 open and plan to cover and then short higher until this go below 270.Overall I am making solid profit on this run and Overall Loss YTD is now <$10K ( This was one point $60K+)
bubble has burst so aggressive sell off is over. Buy with confidence across the whole market.
What are the predictions for Netflix this year. Netflix will go back to $400+ as streaming numbers overseas ramps up exponentially and foreign investment tapers down while investment in movies remain the same. Profit will start to rise by end of year
"In a 6 month time frame, including the most recent bump, ROKU is up 183%, while this thing is up 16% and dropping; yet again!"
Amazing debtflix comeback happening right now! I can’t believe this...might go up $380 at close today!

Netflix never ceases to amaze me. my only regret is not buying more.
Good entry today
bad content is true. I always cancel after trial because there's nothing to see as far as I'm concerned.
"Here is three very negative news that impacting dow to drop 700+ point and one of most impacted stock for each is Amazon and yet it's stock drop only 2.34% after recovering quickly.1.> Tariffs:- China tariffs going to hurt Amazon most. Trade war will hurt Amazon as well because Amazon has lot of global seller and lot of Amazon brand created by putting their label on top of Chinese manufactured stuff. So This should drop as much as $CAT drop.2.> Internet Regulation:- This again impact most to Amazon. Amazon is E-commerce giant and regulation means it will not able to do lot of thing it currently doing.3.> Internet Privacy:- This is third item:- When people think about Privacy most matter is their blogging/personal post (FB), Their Shopping ($AMZN) , Listening their home conversation ($AMZN/$GOOGL), Ability to let anyone one ($AMZN recent doorbell idea to let package deliver inside),Their TV Watching Pattern ($AMZN, $NFLX, $GOOGL).So each item has major negative impact for $AMZN and yet Amazon is least impact stock even after so much run up.This is call way over optimism. This stock should below 1500, may be even near 1400. Only thing going great is technical but it going to break down at 1525. So I guess after that only it will drop like rock. After all entire rally build on top of technical."
I need to celebrate tonight
Perfect! Thanks guys!
all the way up to $400 by June
Any longs have some HUGGIES TO SPARE???
WOW .. just one earning ... made a huge difference
"NFLX went up very quickly from last quarter, even they issue debt of additional 1.5 billions. May go down same way."
I’m buying more more MORE I LOVE NETFLIX
"Just like it didn't go up from $300 to $400 in one day or one week, it won't go down from $400 to $300 in one day or one week either. NASDAQ 100 is at all time high. So, downside risk is much higher than upside potential for all stocks that have unreasonable valuations at these levels. NFLX is no different..."
Very rich valuation
345-347 Before lunch
This is going to break green today
"wow cash flow positive, what an accomplishment. is that hard to do?"
HAHAHHAHAHAHAH PE's matter especially when you MISS on REVENUE!!! TSLA shareholders take note
L'âge du Garbâge. NfLX. Toss it.
Here we go again. Up before 9:45 and down it goes. Market is green and this one barely move. Sleeping again.
"If you are sitting on 1,000 shares. What do you do at the open1. SELL them all, wait for the dip2. Sell a few, see how it goes3. Let it ride"
"We are going much higher than ""three fifty"" this week."
"street money is coming back to NFLX as everyone realized it will go again to $400, If I had money I would buy it for sure."
"So what I saw today from watching the tape. Retail buying and chasing up(small lots)...meanwhile, the market maker was picking up those orders and then eventually sliding them over to large block sells (plus 7000) . Still don't know what to make of all this but be on guard."
Any predictions for tomorrow?
"IQiyi has over $4 Billion in annual revenues.Global growth company.#1 Streaming company in China.So many revenue streams unlike $NFLX. $ROKU holders may be interested also.- 100M+ Paid subscribers- 400M+ Ad supported- gaming with Skymoons- IQiyi Sports- Content distribution- Settop box- 37,000 video screens In Shanghai subway stations- Streaming deal with New Zealand Airline- VR movie deal with hotels- Membership deal with JD.com- VIP deal with Ctrip.com- Licensing deal with Netflix- Licensing deal with NickelodeonMore"
Have you seen (new Lucid Air commercials on CNBC) How about calls 4 it's spac (CCIV)? CALLS EXPLODING!GSAT & GTE CALLS EXPLODING! Future World Rumors on the Dark WEb .002 suppose to be a lock!
I would imagine it is difficult to manipulate a stock substantially higher when the manipulators are the only ones doing the buying.
405 by Friday.
"NFLXPE 1203,999,374 3,907,270 the last quater income is to the left, the one before to the right3999/3907 = 1.02351.0235**4 => 9.76% annual growththings are slowing if you used the last two quarters and annualize that to find the growthsome problems are1. the PE is 1202. the debt went up $5 billion and they got a half a billion in income for the year3. competition. Today Amazon released their free TV, check for yourselfThere is a lot more competition than Amazon. You can get a Fire Stick and get TV for $40 a month these days.Others are starting streaming. Many others and building content.4. manipulation. Can't prove it, but it didn't seem like they were buying, but it does seem like they are selling. You trade long enough, you can tellIt is up about 47% from the bottom 12 days ago and around 4% was today. Anyhow, they appear to have less than 10% growth from my calculations and a PE of 120. That might indicate that they are about 6 times too high. For debt to go up $4.5 billion in one year is a huge amount, especially in a rising interest rate environment and with competition coming on so hard. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;the GDP is around $31 trillion. That's money changing hands. Wmt used to have an income of 5% of their revenue, maybe it is less now. Point is, the most the country income is is likely $3 trillion.The interest on the national debt is $600 billion and likely to climb, even without the debt moving north. That's 20% of the national total income.That's a serious issue and the entire country is in denial.So, QE4 or QE5, whatever you might imagine is likely to be muted out of necessity. Costs need to be cut, which will likely put serious downside on the economy, like it or not. A recession is upon us. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;its up 43 percent in 11 daysand then they upgrade itwhy?To sell it to you.Did they say to buy at the bottom, before it went up 43%? No;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Book value $11.49Price $337, seems a bit extreme.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;someone here compared Disney to Netflix. It makes you realize that NFLX is grossly overpriced. NFLX's PE is almost 10 times as high. NFLX's debt to equity is more than 4 times that of Disney's. NFLX's current ratio 1.39. Disneys current ratio .94."
Once this thing is above $390 it's going straight to $400. Manifest destiny.
It looks like It is finally starting..
Taking profit today would be very wise
"As I said earlier, $550.. we are there now....."
sucker's rally in the opening hour?slowly drifting down ... distribution continues?closing below open.
I honestly wouldn’t be surprised if this hit $600 mid morning
"NFLX tries to maintain the current price level if it can to the end of June, but the market down trend can pull it down. Bankers will sell 3 days to 1 weeks prior next earning (7/16/18). The selling will drive down price so they can buy low. The retail investors should take profit now before bankers selling. NFLX was around $295 prior the last earning because of heavy selling from bankers couple day before the last earning."
"Once AO was the 'first mover and leader' of the internet... once Yahoo was the 'first mover and leader' of email and search.Netflix does not have a huge selection of content, many Netflix investors are going to learn very quickly when Disney, Marvel, Star Wars, Pixar, Fox, etc. is pulled from Netflix just how sparse their content is. It will be worse when Warner/HBO follows suit."
"Get in now not too late , $427 by close tomorrow"
I knew it was going down today.
"I am no longer going to watch CNBC, especially when there is market turmoil . They always make it worse."
"I see resistance at 454.00, oh well. We’ll get there in August."
2 mil more subs than expectations for 14% up ???
Anybody holding lithium here (LAC)?
Never
Textbook short squeeze. Enjoy the ride! Congrats longs!
Stock split in the horizon?
"$585 baby. Yes, fly baby fly."
Expecting 9.4 million subscribers in 4th Q....that tells you all you need to know...Business is booming!!!
$NFLX PONZI SCHEME will COLLAPSE by 65% soon!
If they are talking about buying back their own stock they must think it’s cheap. This increases the chances for another 7 to 1 stock split.
200 million subscribers wow
"“At the other end of the income statement, Netflix’s adjusted Q2 earnings are projected to skyrocket 433% from $0.15 per share in the prior-year period to $0.80 per share.”"
"American TV shows do not dominate the TV screens of Asia so why should NFLX be any different especially since the majority of their offerings are of questionable quality. Be realistic about the growth prospects of NFLX and realize that it is still way toooo overpriced at USD 120 billion. When the market realizes NFLX's income and revenue cannot keep up with the debt, much more pain will come."
This always sells off on earnings
In my opinion we will go up easily to 450-480 to EOW
i have to now eat crow and tell my boss i was kidding about retiring.
"Back to back Green days for the 1st time since Jan 4-7Hit 360 for the 1st time since Oct. 18, 2018 (362.20) that was the day after the Oct. earnings and the slide started.355.81 close is the best since 364.7 on Oct. 17, day after earnings.6th day in a row that the high from the previous day is surpassed.3 day winning streakUp 15.96 for the week and 16.31 for the month"
"So much negative missinformation before earnings, Yahoo Finance peddled some of these boiler room lies. They worked the retail investors HARD on this one."
"Great company that’s showing competition fears were overblown. Disney is the only one remotely competing, I would not be surprised if more than one new entrants leave the industry entirely"
you could go sledding down this chart today
Corona cases are spiking all over the world! I won't be surprised if nflx hits $1000 in few months.Tomorrow we will be greenNext week we will test $600
any single ladies with 1000 shares? need a guy with lots of love to give? looks not important?
What I can say is: WOW
I think this will break 600 easy. I kept mine through all the rough and tumble.
Close to 400 real soon.
$330 by end of March....
FANG stocks are in a correction process.
Watch out the big short squeeze tomorrow if shorts cannot drop NFLX in the thin market now.
9 dollars...no adds...less than 40 cents a day. Z
after 280 little pull back then 315.
needs to break 380
waiting to load up at 300
If it hit's 595 I'm topping off my short for some serious gains tomorrow so I can cover at 550's I mean who the heck is buying still at this range? I know true investors will dislike but us who day trade and swing trade follow if you want to make easy fast money. I'm sure it will come back to this price range later this year but man way too high to try to maintain short term
"Cable TV is in decline because subscribers pay mostly for distribution vs Netflix subscribers who pay mostly for content. Cable TV is still holding on to 90% of the market so Netflix has a long, long way to go before the ride is over."
"Will woke up this morning, opened the window, and took in a deep breadth. ""Smells like new money,"" he said to himself. Let the day begin."
"shorts having been saying this stock is a bubble or it will crash and burn since June 11, 2011 when I purchased at split adjusted price of 37.27 and I did not believe them then nor now."
230 after Earning is reasonable.
"One year ago NFLX was trading at $140. Today it closes over $300. Very impressive. But has the company and its prospects really changed that much? What am I missing? This is madness, right?"
It should be around 290’s right around earnings. If they miss subscribers numbers it will go down. Otherwise 330$ for sure. Again Netflix has the biggest content on their platform compare to any other given.
My company just reimbursed me 5k for my tuition. I’m thinking of putting it all in 400 September calls. Just worried that the stock has next earnings baked in.
"time to party, NFLX Longs...https://youtu.be/cFk0SSmmvfQ"
my favourite stock and also the best in my portfolio
this is stronger than AMZN.
Netflix will close between $435-$450 after earnings report.
So AMZN had a great quarter nut weak guidance and NFLX had a great quarter and Great guidance and the stock went down. Does not make sense.
50% cut in corporate taxes will boost earnings.stock will rocket up.jus sayin
600 call volume for next week is insane. Wonder if it’ll get up to that.
time to take profit on long trades and prepare to go short.
don't let big get your cheap shares---hold it or buy more:I see NFLX hit $1000 in 3 month!
Buyers will come in after 11
Avoid Netflix 2021 is what all Brokers are saying. Time to Short Big on Netflix and send Obama to a lower tax bracket.
"The gary Cohen thing we knew would happen, and as far as nexflix is concerned either someone is buying it or the next quarter they are going to blow out subscriber growth"
DID YOU NOTICE THE GREEN MACHINE BROUGHT IT UP 4 POINTS. THEY WILL BRING IT TO 420 SOON!
So cheap now should jump $25 today at least
"As of January 18, 2018, China held $1.7 trillion of our debt. In fact, China is our largest creditor and will make a fortune with interest rates rising here. IQ is largely known as the Netflix of China and they report earnings in just over a week. We already know they will do very well because they beat expectations last time and raised guidance. Other oversold Chinese companies that are a must buy before earnings, for the same reasons are BIDU and MOMO. Like I said earlier, don't worry about Netflix here. They'll pop again before you know it. China has been in a bear market because of the trade war; however, the selloff in many of these companies is too extreme to last. Take advantage of it and happy investing."
Up then consolidates..Up again then consolidates..Up again the consolidates. This baby is going higher then higher then higher than high!!!
NFLX has been on fire almost as much as ROKU over the past month! What a beautiful partnership! 
if they can run up tesla and bitcoin are they going to run up netflix?

It will be back to $200s very soon
"John Malone says with the internet scale increases 10x for media companies, which implies Netflix will have 1 billion global subscribers if they reach 100 million subscribers in the US."

Is it True that NetMuzxi is hiring Kap to work with Susan Rice and Obama in Project Get on Knees for IRAN???
The stock has been on fire ever since Hastings said they plan on taking spending up quite a bit. It can only mean one thing. They continue to see very strong demand for their service.
"Down 100$ from the high. I think the selling is about done. ok, I hope it's done"
"And here’s the sell off, yet again. Biggest regret of my life buying this before earnings"
"RBC — outperform rating, target price to $450 from $480“Q2 Subs came in materially light, due to a weak new content slate & some price hike pushback. The Subs miss wasn’t unprecedented, though the International miss magnitude was greater than normal. The Q3 &’19 Subs outlooks were strong, however. We believe the Long Thesis is intact, though we are incrementally less bullish. Price target reduced from $480 to $450. Maintain Outperform.”"
"Sell in at 388, maybe it will tick to that point"
"Sell NFLX and buy ROKU! It's going to 1,000 in 2021!!!"
Something to be happy about. Yipee!!
$700 this year
New 52 week high by few minutes now...still Watching...dont leave to see an amazing short Squeeze
The fact NFLX stock has withstood all the trade fears and firing of COO this week and is still above $390 is pretty shocking to say the least... I think everyone can agree that if there was going to be a massive sell off it would have happened already. With that said where do we see this opening going at the start of the new Quarter next week?
no one stopping this now
Don't buy into GS's bs. It is so funny to read that the street is trying to 'decouple' NFLX from the FANG and this stock is running purely on the new 'Brick box' release.
$GME $NFLX $CHTR $T over to $AMC Movie theatres to open in NY
Guidance will temper the enthusiasm. We're still in the peak of a pandemic. Got some headwinds on sub growth a couple quarters out.
"In a blink, NFLX up 8 points as it was doing yesterday!"
Grats to anyone who sold this stock. You will regret it after this month...

Deutsche Bank wants cheap shares before Monday. Says NFLX will miss subscriber growth. Nice try.
I told you it was a buy at $500.00Now look it's up over $59.00
Revenue is up only 40%. Lol
Netflix is 100% safer than usd dollar- this is the safe stock
Nothing happening before next ER
$500.00 is coming to a movie near you
Analyst would be revising their price targets upwards with the huge subscriber growth. Nextflix global market still has much room to grow. I myself subcribed to Netfix in March last year when the pandemic striked and continue to see myself as a subcriber even after the pandemic.
Netflix has a good business model however profitability is highly elusive and competition is heating up. The closest analogy I recall is when Netscape was the dominant web browser until Microsoft came out and offered IE free. Things didn't end overnight for Netscape but in time IE won the war. Same thing is happening with competition from AT&T and Disney. Netflix could be bought out but only at a much lower price. Think about it.
Upgrades before earnings are scary as always
It's just FOMO there will be plenty of profit taking tomorrow. It's near all time high. Literally no sellers after hours so they're all waiting until the opening bell when the spread is lower. 1000 share bids on the ask and 5 shares on the sell says it all. It will test VWAP then carry on tomorrow.
NFLX 375 tomorrow
Gottal love those analysts: upgrade after the stock has made a 35% move in two weeks and is up already 22% YTD.
All these shorts bad mouthing NFLX is hilarious!! All they say is how this will be down big tomorrow or go to $500 lol. Don’t forget people this was at $545 a week and a half ago without earnings!!! This will hit all time high tomorrow no worries lmao!
Best day since last Wednesday. Last time we had a HIGH of double digitsWe need the Friday slump to end tomorrow.Last green Friday was oct. 12Only one is the last 9.Can this be the start of something good?
380+ in 2 weeks. Mark my words!!
I think the only way it will go up is if they are integrating online gaming onto the platform.I don't see the catalyst for it to go up more. More catalysts for it to drop actually.
Can someone on this board please tell me why NFLX stock price will still rise after earnings release even though its valuation is in another stratosphere? Profit taking will be significant regardless of earnings/guidance.
Congratulations. I just pushed up the premarket price by $2/share. You're welcome.
"look at these shorties in here,scared to death it will scream tomorrow, trying everything tonight to cast a bunch of fear"
Need new compelling original content that simple
When market turns south; these stocks with shaky EPS will be hit hardest: NFLX/ROKU/AMZN/AYX/MDB/.....
Netflix has to be undervalued. It continues to make new highs while the market has been in a correction for most of 2018.
Copy and paste: $AMC CEO and $NFLX $GME major announcement at 3pm here with us at the studio !!! https://twitter.com/cnbc_mark/status/1357710529763147782
Bad move by Netflix to relate anyway to politics. I like netflix but I just cancelled by subscription.
Celebration Tonight...
Looking forward to merger Monday. NFLX is a takeout candidate at these levels. $450 - $500.00.
EOD low will be visited again and surpassed.
"Up day on big volume, don’t sell"
"RBC predicts 30% upside, source CNBC"
TIMBERRRR the Shorts.
Wow what a miss
8% options implied. So plus or minus $30
Before earnings last quarter the stock was 400 on the day of the report. These 330s a gift I accept!
My calls paid off 
option expiration day ; traders and hedgefund guys driving it down to close out their accounts ; what do you expect
Could Netflix actually end on a high note today!! No 3pm decline!?! Woohoo!
The Only Thing Netflix Investors Have to Fear Is Fear Itself
Realize that the Masters of the Universe are simply waiting for opportune moments when they can count on short-covering to do virtually all of the heavy lifting - and do so with relatively small outlays of cash.
HP coming to netflix in Sept!
No better stock out there.
"Although I am long for the short term, I do believe they will miss the ""Expected Subscriber Growth"" this quarter. Many people signed up in the 4th quarter for the holidays. It had nothing to do with the content. The street has missed this. Just my opinion."
"To quote Chic Anderson, race announcer of the 1973 Belmont Stakes and Triple Crown. Secretariat (Netflix) is ""running like a tremendous machine"". This stock could down in history in a similar way as Big Red."
Strongly green for tomorrow...
Morning folks looks very promising today. Love netflix no problems with me have fun
"if they license their stuffs, why do i need Netflix ?"
Netflix is 10 years ahead in internet video distribution. There is nothing impeding them from reaching 1 billion subscribers.
Great earnings!! And stock is down!! Why it’s going down?

"WHILE SO MANY businesses had to shut down, NFLX always open for business.24/7. GO NFLX "
Scared money...dont make money. Z
Im hoping to get back at my buy in so I can sell out of this market. 2018 is not looking good and Trump doesn't make it any better. They may trap us for quite a while down here.
Look at max and 5 year chart... Last 2 years market almost flat yet Netflix up over 200%. Sorry but odds are dropping to around 220.
"There it goes up again. Those big banks and investors bought yesterday. Made a big profit today. Sold high and hired people to convince everybody that this stock is no good. Negative reports, spam on forums. It went from 10% up, where they sold. To 3,5%. And now they buy back. Watch my words friends. I would do it to if i had a billion to spend by the way."

Underestimating the size of the streaming market is the biggest mistake people make with Netflix.

"Debtflix is a bull market phenomenon. When the credit cycle turns, Debtflix will no longer be able to finance itself with junk bonds. Buyer beware. Debtflix has no cash relative to its deep-pocketed competitors like Disney, Comcast, Apple, Amazon, Google/YouTube, etc. Frantic borrowing just to stay in the game is an unsustainable strategy."
NFLX WILL BE IN THE 200'S AFTER EARNINGS..... BOOK IT
OK up 7.12% in 3 days and 6 billion in market cap. I was surprised it kept going up today. It's clearly tired here and I expect a small pullback tomorrow. Maybe finish around 204.35 going into the weekend. I look forward to another volatile day with this.
I believe Nflx can easily increase their monthly rate to at least $20 a month. The cost to see 1 movie in the theaters like Mudbound far exceeds what one pays for Nflx service. In fact I pay $50 a month for Hbo and I get practically nothing.
"Someone just bought my remaining share over 563... I'm out, good luck everyone!"
NFLX next 3 month revenue per subscriber = $31.1 (8% higher). Reason Most of subscriber yet to see price increase.They somehow hide this detail and market celebrating too fast I think.
Can’t even close at 525 when the market up 300 plus points. Very disappointing move today.
360 tomorrow ?
"Netflix price target raised to $750 from $660 at Pivotal ResearchPivotal Research analyst Jeffrey Wlodarczak raised the firm's price target on Netflix to $750 from $660 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares. The company last night reported a ""nicely better than expected"" Q4 subscriber and financial results, conservative Q1 subscriber guidance and better than expected Q1 financial forecast, Wlodarczak tells investors in a research note. Further, management officially confirmed they no longer need outside capital to fund their business, and raised their 2021 free cash flow forecast to flat from negative $1B, adds the analyst. He expects Netflix will continue to demonstrate pricing power ""as the service remains a relative entertainment value for best in class entertainment."""
"man I have to tell you, just when you think you're about to make up some ground, this stock starts to sell off. We are definitely in for the long haul. NFLX is officially a day trading stock. They are selling on any kind of jump."
Does someone know the most recent short percentage?

Still trading at 265 p/e. P/E = 50 is more appropriate and thats where this wall street scam stock will be. Just look at how much money this company is burning each quarter. Debt is going up big time. Yea keep funding free users with debt and let wall street manipulators keep upgrading because number of users are increasing but nobody talks about billions of new debt being added every year. This Dot Com II bubble will go bonker big time anytime soon now.

I still say $390 by end of week!!
"Going up in PM, down less than 2% now. Green futures. Going to be a good day!"
"NFLX @ $351/share, it is better to buy stock of Boeing @ $357. Boeing pays $1.71/share divident"
Why be worried. It only has a market cap of 117b and negative free cash flow
going up of course
Money to be made if you buy at $502.00 or lower.
im so glad I sold this thing when it was in the mid 560's. It was such a drag on my porfolio between earnings. I will prob buy into it again when it dips to 470's...
Has any analyst said they'll miss? If not it's a very good sign.
"Well, we held above 300, for today. Tomorrow will be brighter."
"Long term this company will grow. However keep in mind it’s negative cash flow and the fact that as time goes on, the amount of competitors they will have will increase. This company is not the future in the next 10 years, as some day NFLX will become Blockbuster."
"Nflx has potential plan, stock might be 500 by eoy.."
Add today! NFLX is No.1 stay-at-home stocks! People who quarantined at home have to watch NFLX to kill the time!
Today 450 easy
Back to $400+ today
"On a day when it opens between 2.5 and 3 on the green side and the high reaches at least five, like today, it has NEVER closed in the red."
HBO Max is so much betterthan Netflix. No comparison whatsoever. Every title downloadable. I have had Netflix forFREE for at least 2.5 years.Why is the stock SO BLOATED?
"For the ones crying about nflx debt of $12BDisney has $58B, comcast and ATT over 100 and 150B respectively. For the wedbush lovers https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/17/netflix-analysts-preview-the-companys-upcoming-earnings-report.html"
"If you value Netflix strictly by its ability to make money by subscription only then your not looking at the big picture. Netflix is in the midst of a transformation. This company just like it did when it switch to streaming is again transforming into a media company. You can see from the steady stream of media talent it has acquired and property location it has purchased. The ramp up in Netflix original movies is not just for its subscription business, it is part of a larger business transformational strategy. The cost of making movies for Netflix is going to go down further as they become more of a movie studio than a streaming company."

$DIS would benefit more them $NFLX or $AMZN. So much potential here.
I wonder if this really good company value is to close to dis in value without much assets should be at 99 compared to 300 plus?
$562.00 & Higher !!!!
"Pricing basically means nothing in this market and this stock. If you can get your market maker buddy to buy it at a higher price,"
349 tomorrow
"Make no mistake, Netflix is the king of video distribution. It is going direct to the talent to produce TV shows and movies. Game over, competition is a no show and Netflix wins by default."
Who would have thought that Netflix would lose subscribers aftter paying $$ millions to the Obama's with the following special documentaries coming out: 1) How to become President from only being a community organizer 2) How I learned to hate America and the military and love Fidel Castro 3) Just give socialism a chance 4) How to keep your present medical plan 5) How to double or triple the U.S. deficit 6) How to keep your present doctor 7) Why Michelle and I don't care about BLM (because we're filthy rich now and wouldn't live in Chicago if you paid millions more to us). These are just some of the upcoming special documentaries coming up on Netflix. Join up now to make sure can stream these fascinating insights into the Obama legacy.
"Netflix 375 tomorrow, rug pull incoming."
"This reminds me of the early days of $NFLX.Yes I got into $NFLX, after it’s IPO.While reflecting back I got in at $8 per share- about a 10point drop, after its IPO.It’s EPS we’re still in the RED, but it’s CHURN RATE (money a Co. spends to attract new customers) was going lower and it was expanding and everyone in Boston was talking about its convenience.By the next QTRLY EPS, and following QTR EPS, -trading up and sideways - it kept revealing lower QTRLY EPS losses, lowered Churn rate, increased sales, and Quarterly EPS, improved and well once $NFLX, began to receive more and more upgrades and beat Analysts EPS, it shot up and up.Unfortunately, My broker had put a sell order in to sell 1/2 my position at $125. My shares were sold and within a week or 2 it was nearly $200+ and announced a split and again skyrocketed. My remaining shares were sold at $201."

"And I am glad I bought 310 put today for expiry tomorrow, might go worthless but will give me opportunity to buy 325-330 put before next earning"
"Q1 Earning, Beat expectation, raise guidance => Stock was trading 330 and in couple day drop to 310.Now Q2 Earning:- Miss Q2 est by big margin, reduce future guidance => Stock still trade 380.What a great market. Stock is overvalue at 310 even after rosy picture, it's now way overvalue with downtrending picture as well but no long care here."
Total manipulation of the stock Monday morning

"Once Apple and Disney get there act together in NFLX's space, NFLX has to move down to the $185.00 range. Its just common sense. The quesiton is when?"
tomorrow will be 410-415
NFLX is up 12.13% to 255.19

"We might see new lows to 200s next couple of months, am short Netflix snap and roku"
"The only reason this dropped from 330 was because a ""famed"" short seller was given HUGE airtime on CNBC, Bloomberg and other outlets to promote his short."
Look at that power!
"Call and Put trading lately weird. I do lot of trading. I have this exprience since last few weeks specially with $CAT and $NFLX.Here is what I learn.When I try to sell put and if it don't sell even it's near bid, I think that mean stock likely going up.If try to sell put and able to sell near ask, stock likley going downSame with Calls.In other word, They are lately controling entire market.

looks like a little healthy pull back
Netflix valuation is always too low because it is compared to companies with much less growth potential.
Now price target hikes will come in next 2 weeks. it is going 650+. Hold it.
Love Netflix but this growth rate is unsustainable
Will be 375 to 400 in a month
"here we go, green again"
PE ratio of 224. Very healthy
This happens all the time. It goes down and then right back up up up up. It’s not end of the world

"LONGS! We have to hold the $300 level! We need to come together and BUY today to defend this crucial psychological level. The stocks HIGH for 2017 was only 200, and we could easily revisit that level if this slips back into the $200s. Don't let it happen! BUY!"

market timers will be destroyed by Netflix. this is a buy and forget about stock.
"Overall Netflix is a good stock/company, it just got to far ahead of itself. Just needs time for a lower base to be established. P/E needs to become something more reasonable too. 240+ is way to high."

"Reed Hastings : ""fundamentals have never been stronger"""
There is NO reason why NFLX traded higher on Friday It obvious that once it’s start falling it will go way down who is behind this
"Netflix has huge upside, I won't be surprised if it closes over 450 by the end of next week."
you can't honestly look at nflx with everything that is is facing and expect it to keep going up. i think that both longs and shorts can agree that nflx is a solid company. the question is multiple compression. it is normal for a company to retract 20-30% after such a huge run and particularly when its prospects are slowing slightly. Where would a -20% to -30% adjustment bring us? think about that.
This cannot fall as almost all funds in the world owns this.
...pretty amazing...50% in just a few weeks....I'm tempted to sell with the idea of buying it back at a better price. Stocks just don't move up this much without correcting...
"Yeeey , tomorrow is a great day..."
Netflix will turn green before market makes it
"Well, it went up roughly $80.00 on good subscription news, and lost $50.00 of that, on NO news. Granted the market is down, but ROKU seems to be doing just fine, up over $10.00"
"Article today someplace (appears authentic but frivolous, not bothering with the link) stating traders are positioning ahead of earnings for the inevitable decline after earnings. I'm counter positioned with short term calls and shares. After 3 quarters of misses, time for a beat."

"Cameria said and I quote"" Buy all of Fang on the Open"". So you Buy at the highs then sell at $320, Didn't He say buy two days ago AH at $400 too?"
I don't think NFLX goes higher until it comes down again. Folks probably missed the last ride and are finding it hard to buy here like me. I'm short until I get hurt a little or it trades down to a level I like. I'd buy at back at 308
Impressive volume.
Hear me out... shouldn’t Netflix Buy Game of Thrones... milk it for more money on Netflix with spin-offs. After some time when Netflix makes a bit load more money they can open up a theme park and they have really good stuff in their portfolio... in this case (GOT). Stranger things... and other Netflix hits could be rides and experiences in the parks. Netflix Food originals? Boom restaurants and shops.... the amount of money they could make on parks is huge in the future. Thoughts
Why is this still dropping?!
"If it opens tomorrow above 327.10 tomorrow, look for a GREEN DAY with a high hitting at least 336."

Not quite the 360 I was hoping for but on our way... 380 by Friday
if we get to 650 then 700 is around corner and they should split 7-1. I don't believe this has ever split correct?
The fundamentals that Netflix has are incredible ..........The unstoppable train
"By comparison, this stock is pitiful! In a 3 month period ROKU has gained 85%, while this dog has dumped 7%."

"Netflix investors are getting skittish.

A reverse of just the last 15 weeks of gains would mean a stock price collapse of almost 40%.6) Already down 10% in just the last two trading days7) About to breach the $300 level to the downside8) Already priced as the 33rd largest company in AmericaYIKES!

"I watched a few things on Netflix over the weekend. They offered subtitles in at least 15 different languages. They had a good movie subtitled in Korean, I watched a standup comic from Morocco, the one that followed was another stand-up comedian from another country and the entire standup was subtitled (I only watched the trailer, but the translation wasn't lost in the comedy), watched a biopic and a streaming series. In short, Netflix is blowing up internationally."

HBO still bigger than Netflix on Pay TV and Hulu catching up quickly on Domestic.Hulu added 3 million in just 3 month and reach 20M+ compare to Netflix 55M.With recent partnership with Spot they going to get even more subscriber this 3 month.Now People can sure keep multiple subscription but when they paying for multiple they will think about rotating soon and when that start Netflix will have hard time keep 55M subscriber even.
Hulu was just valued at $15 billion. Thats a problem for Netflix's valuation which stands at a staggering $165 billion including net debt. That is roughly 11x the valuation of Hulu.

who buys this stock at this price and waits till 2020 for a bounce Netflix needs to go down to 220 than you can look at it
"Trend is ur friend, Short Short Short"
"Looks like this is going to $330 today. Likely $350 by end of the week and then $400 before earnings release. After that, I would expect at least $500 by end of April. That would give it a market cap of $216 billion. Seems like $700 by the end of the year is doable if they can continue to beat on subs."
Is the company going bankrupt?
See ya
"The whole FAANG is a huge bubble ready to pop folks, NFLX will go down to $200's soon. Margin calls will come in tomorrow and Friday at a fast rate......10-20% price drop within the next couple of weeks (domino effect).

I bought them at 369 and I am long term holder. This is going down every single day. Any thoughts why?
"Today's close price complies with the statistics that for the past nine red Fridays, the following Mondays dropped 1.23% in average."
I told all of you that mutual funds would buy more today. Did you listen ?
Nice upward pressure leading into tomorrow.
$550 calls look beautiful. Told you to buy them cheap this morning.
What is going on with this stock? Great earnings announcement and just keeps going down?
Did it beat
In only 10 shares at 332 lol don't have that kind of money
"PATIENCE PAYS!!! we started shorting NFLX when above $330, covered at 300...then waited for 280 to break..we got two $10 runs already before today (279 to 289), then again today another $10 run. Day Trader Josh's swing system is spot on people. Gotta check him out....his system is perfect for the volatility in 2018...make no mistake, the volatility is not going anywhere, anytime soon. Swing trading is best strategy in 2018..gotta lock in profits! SwingTrade101com"
wait til it reaches the 50 day moving average around 348 before buying. It always bounces off from there when it pulls back.
Monster Miss!
"Today I sold me Netflix shares with minor losses. I’m afraid this company is done. There will be more and more pressure from other streaming services (incl $AMZN, $DIS, $AAPL, $HULU, $GOOGL and other service). $NFLX is burning a lot of cash and the only strength they have is the number of subscribers which will decrease with the increase of competition/alternatives. More, today (the next day after Disney released their new streaming cheap service with great library!), Netflix announced increase of price [face palm]- I got an email. Last but not least, mostly, Netflix’s library of content is garbage - I have nothing to watch there. So, I do not see bright future for this company, but good luck to all those who are long here"
Netflix expected to quit burning cash. Cash flow positive going forward.
"More/higher PTs after earnings. This is a stock you hold not trade. Same thing happened with Amazon 4yrs ago. Missed out at 270, now it’s 1750."
"Explain how this, which traded down to 338 yesterday on an Upgrade, all of a sudden, just move straight up 14 points on nothing"
I am hoping for a strong push back up to the day's high by the closing bell today.

This is the time in the market where I stop paying attention to stocks. A bunch of institutional traders are following each other like sheep in order to boost their bottom line for Christmas bonuses. No reality is involved here. So I just wait them out and maybe scope out some buying opportunities.
If you are an investor you should know the answer.
CFRA reiterates Buy rating on $NFLX & ups TP from $400 to $500.Bet we see $500 by end of week.
"Disney up a whole 2% after hrs., no one will get close to us for a few quarters.NFLX looking good tonight"
Massive short squeeze in the afterhours. Missed on EPS but apparently the street was pleased...subscriber numbers must've been good. Shorties are bleeding from the rectum right now.
"like I said before, if this were to crash below $305 it would've done it already."
"Does anyone consider how much more appealing the content of Netflix is to international subscribers than Disney or any of the competition? Personally, i could care less about a few popular American movies when I can choose so many good ones you probably have never heard of on Netflix and many were aimed for the non-usa audience. Does anyone realize that Netflix could put content in theatres too, or use advertising in a limited way to augment income?"
Day trading this stock wasn’t the best idea was it fellas?(;
"Netflix has come this far, and surely it will go farther from here. Intermittent pullbacks are normal even from Jan 2018 up to the present. Trust Netflix. Just hold on your stocks. The best things will come for those who wait."
In for $305.82 . Come on after hour 
"I bought Netflix just now at 496$. Hopefully, It will go up till next week. I believe in Netflix and I am confident about it. Go Netflix !!!!!"
Thinking this report is going to be similar to ROKU's announcement 2 weeks of more subscribers. It's Winter/Christmas season and Smart TV's sales were excellent. NFLX will announce more subscriber growth in this report.
"I love the service, but this P.E. is absolutely ridiculous. I would rather buy Apple and sleep at night."
sorry after hours $488
I hope the fact that Netflix is huge in Europe will surprise everyone and today’s earnings report. Stay long stay strong!
"Major timber tomorrow, another 9%!"

"Why are Netflix bonds officially rated (and priced) as ""junk bonds""? What does this mean for the stock price? The other FAANGs have much better credit ratings and don't have to issue junk bonds. What's different about Netflix?"
What about this warrants a PE 10x higher than DIS? This company is so overvalued it would need to double earnings every year for several years to even start justifying this valuation.
337+ by close of day.

yup weak stomach's selling BaaàaaHaa Dems going to shut down again. this going to the moon.
Any bets on NFLX being up over $600 tomorrow?
Subscriber growth will blow past the most exuberant estimates!

"Trump says an impeachment inquiry will ""crash markets."" Does that bode ill for NFLX? On the bright side, if NFLX falls far enough, it might become a possible buy out candidate."
This will revisit $360’s a few times before earnings.
This move is all about pricing power. The last time they blew away subscriber estimates after raising prices the stock ran from 185 to 423.
Sell now
"hunch:sells offtime to get in is now (sell or short)why, because the price is apt to go to $130 per share (see a long term chart)and so, a lot of money is to be made in the early goingbut, $420 was the top, but $130 is about half where it is, so its still easy moneyOnce it gets to $200 it may pop highercould pop here, thoughbasis:5.2 times the PE of Disney$276/5.2 = $53 per sharebased on that aloneone might expect some selling at some point, PE normalizationand then the cost of content is up 30% in one yearthen the competition is everywhereZacks noted the low barrier to getting into the streaming business and a $165 price target"
As soon as one country puts a tariff on Netflix then the stock is toast. I'm surprised that Soros isn't shorting NFLX while working on some government to impose tariff. Does anybody really think that foreign governments are going to sit around and watch $10 a month be sent to the US by their citizens?
"Put it to you like this. HBO is valued at 30 billion with 130 million subscribers. Nflx, has 118 million subs, doesn’t charge as much and spends 100x as much on content and has a valuation of 140 billion. Stay long if you’re long but you could lose your shirt if you’re a buyer at these prices"
"The reality is the deal does not create Netflix, some way to go regarding penetration, analytics, commissioning and growth. Disney has blockbuster content but no real offering to customers today or in the near future!"
"At Thanksgiving everyone wants to say ""I sold my nflx at $420. Who would admit to missing that window?"

"Nice 100k+ pop $$$ today. Keep on shorting, people. Thank you for making this a wild ride."
bought 20k @$350
"I can't believe with all this market volatility and where nflx started this morning at -$12.00 in reds, now no one is commenting how it's holding its own. Everyone i'm sure was expecting worse!"
"ATDS could soon be the security software , protecting user information this and many other tech companies... Just saying."
another buy opportunity!! loading up!
God have some mercy on us Friday.
What is this about AMZN ER having effect on Netflix stock prices? Do you watch Netflix while ordering online on Amazon? Or do you put Netflix on hold while rush out to front door to pick up amazon delivery? If you do any of these activities multitasking then there is nothing to worry about either one!
Should Amazon just cancel and ban Netflix so they would have more customers on their own platform.
i'm usually sympathetic but not the way folks piled into this one.
Hope for a $20.00 gain tomorrow it could happen within first hour. Let’s go BULLS keep buying and put pressure on the bears
This sell off is the biggest lol today:DDD
Sell ASAP at open $355 or less
"Didn't like the afternoon selloff, but ending up $3 on a day when all of the major averages were noticeably down is still pretty good. I agree with some of the other posts - tomorrow we'll probably drop a few dollars early, then slowly rise throughout the day to finish somewhere in the mid-370s."
350 will always be a cheap price for netflix. i will remind you again when its at 450....
the will try to close 350 but the market and buffet push to 370
"One of most long time bull analyst downgrade Netflix after reaching 325 target. This is big deal because analyst keep upping stock price just to not go against trend or fuel into rally. Yet when analyst upped price target this move $10-$15 on up but now when downgrade which is huge change, it only go down $4. This is how bad wall street gone. Normally when long time bull analyst downgrade stock drop big and hardly any effect when they increase price target."
I'm selling as soon as it reaches $1500 a share.
let's hope for a brighter week next week and thereafter
it good time to buy
Today easy $40.00 pop. This going to run so fast up that the banks aren’t going to have time to get in at a low price. Buy early I LOVE NETFLIX
"Matthew Harrigan reiterated sell rating, he has sell rating on NFLX since it was 300, his client would have made lot of money if he went long at 300."
Not even the Enterprise can keep up with this stock. Great show by the way. Season 2 ep 1 on Netflix today.
"it was under 307 on may 3its may 1613 days, including two weekends (4 days)so 9 trading days 307 (less) to 329.723.8 points aboutmaybe the peak was a lower low, so we go to 300 the 100 dma?"
https://youtu.be/cKUvKE3bQlY
Can only be valued this high if people don't work.
Netflix has the lowest cost per subscriber and don’t take Ad money and can still spend 10 times what it’s closest competitor is spending. It’s like Usain Bolt gets a 1 Mile head start in a race and his competitors are saying they will catch up with him. No chance. Just noise when views are expressed about Apple or Disney catching them any time in the near future. Netflix is very sticky and addictive.
"Sugar, we’re going up."
"After hours obviously looks great but after being burned, I don't trust after hours or premarket. I've see stocks go berserk at the opening bell"
"A community organizer has a show on NFLX, how ?"
"when news came that some resolution of trade with eu was imminent the smart traders sold INTO the rally. this market is NOT a buy it is strong sell...it is not how much growth USA has, it is why are not salaries going up? if corporate profits were sustainable AND debt was under control, salaries would rise...this is why stocks are falling and will continue weakening....what will precipitate a total market collapse will be a fed raising rates into the instability you see in the market today...growth is weak and problematic elsewhere in other countries...you buy at your own risk, it takes years to recover stock losses."
??? Why is CFO leaving?
Seems like an awful lot of bulls in here going into earnings for a stock down $100 from its highs
Market manipulation to burn calls for tomorrow.
400 by close >)
430 pt GS
So does NFLX interest continue to rise to fund their negative free cash flow?
pre market just moving wow great for people like me under 332
Millions without jobs and they have increased the monthly fee! I don’t know guys! This could ended up really bad after hours .... just saying!

Bought a few shares in AH yesterday at 345 and change. Just sold for 379 and change. Not a bad percentage gain for an 18 hour hold (I'm here to tell ya)!!!
should buy more now?

"NETFLIX CEO: ""WE ARE LOSING IN THE COMPETITION AGAINST DISNEY+"""
"I am fairly new to options trading. Bought $340 Jul 20 puts yesterday. How can I get a rough estimate of where the puts will be trading post market open? Options follow the black scholes model, which I am familiar with but not too knowledgeable about (I know about delta, gamma, theta, and vega just not the mathematical calculations behind them). How would I go about mathematically getting a rough estimate of where the options should theoretically trade at market open, assuming they will open at the pre-market price (which will of course change as soon as the market opens)."
"Just got our go ahead to SHORT nflx today from Day Trader Josh. Shorting from 359.50, cover at 339.50 ($20 run). PLEASE NO LONG-TERM investors need respond, just hold you will be fine...although, you make way more on this beast stock if you sell long potions, then SHORT, after every new major break out and then buy back at lower levels after your cover swings. We are up over 400 points on logged profits since we started training nflx 3 years ago, way more in profits when swing trading, both LONG&SHORT."
"So even though I've owned 200 shares since $80, yesterday for once I finally signed up for Netflix. You're welcome for the pop!"
380 today here we go bulls
Folks it’s only 3 percent relax
Competition Has lower prices.
I can't imagine Disney+ will be good news for Netflix. Strange that they aren't launching until late 2019 though. I suppose that is good news at least?
I will start a short position soon..
FANG have been over pumped for so long!
The one thing that the NFLX shorts seem to have in common is no personal responsibility of any kind. Their losses are all somebody else's fault.
"DIS down NFLX up in AH says it all ! NFLX will pop big tomorrow, both overhang, Apple and Disney out of the way now."
Sell and come over to ROKU
Consensus is building that the stock would trade above 400 in 12 months as more and more analysts raise subscriber growth projections.
Sold at $248. Great move but this is as good as it gets.
Is NFLX down because DIS up and is presumably is taking market share from NFLX.
get ready for the market reversal in the next 45 minutes. stop loss in place.
Need more Susan Rice
WOW Subscribers must be falling because everyone in Turkey can't pay for Netflix subscription.
buying more ... way way way oversold.
"$NFLX sellers come on over to $DIS! The water is warm, the dividend is good, and the fundamentals are strong... Rogue One is going to be HUGE!!!"
 bears
THIS IS NOT WAR... ITS JUST A SINGLE BOMBING AND STATEMENT. Stop magnifying every single headline.
NFLX has not corrected at all today. The market has but not NFLX.
$550 coming up
Is is still worth buying in right now ? Or wait for a dip?!
The stock chart is telling us loud and clear that TV watchers will always choose the service that gives them more for their money.
One day we'll be saying NFLX was 408/share! Best advice is too buy long and hold for a couple years when it's well over 1000
Yesterday's sugar high wearing off. As expected.
Thumbs up if you think this is going up after earnings or thumbs down if you think it’ll dip. Vote now!
364 by wednesday. About to break out
This market wants to rip 12% higher...... Netflix will lead the charge.
I don't know if anyone noticing but I do notice that retail buying is not as much as those manipulator expected even after so much push by their media friends and Analyst friends. I really hope they end up very badly because such manipulation is never healthy for stock market.
"After seeing the combo of a bullish engulfing pattern along with a sharp move off the 50% retracement yesterday, today is no surprise at all. This stock has shown it can go up with frightening momentum. Shorts cover while you can."
its not stable plus 50 tomorrow I've seen this before going to 650
"Yes, it's not as high as most would have liked, but it's still going to be up on a ""down"" day. If tomorrow is an ""up"" day, Netflix should be pulled up further."
"a stock is not supposed to go 43 points above the 50 dmaespecially with the growing debt on their booksPE 283revenue grew at 40% from year to year (annual) -> 3.5 times a PE o 80353/3.5 = ~ $100 per shareand we haven't seen the competition effects, they have the toughest competition: apple, FB, AMZN, Goog, ....Comcast, DIS ...."
"Anyone read the WSJ today? India is going to curb growth of US tech firms in their country. They are going to follow the China model. Bad news for NFLX since that is an expected major growth area. I know this board doesn't like facts but this is real. From the article, ""The proposed rules, which have emerged in recent weeks in a series of private, draft government policies, have U.S. tech companies concerned, according to people familiar with the matter. American firms are betting billions on the Indian market because, unlike China’s, it has been relatively open to foreign competitors. That might be about to change.“It is unprecedented and it needs to be taken very seriously,” said Vinay Kesari, a Bangalore-based technology lawyer specializing in regulatory matters who has worked with U.S. tech firms. “It could have huge implications.”"
Who is buying?
SELL $NFLX SCAM! Netflix BUBBLE WILL COLLAPSE by 60%!
There’s rotation out of fanny ex Apple. Not surprising. People can make money in other sectors at the moment.
Nice close...shorts better cover Monday....which will become a buy to close order and propel NFLX even higher. Longs will prevail Monday evening and Tuesday morning. $340.00 minimum after earnings release.
Another great buying opportunity.
"NFLX will crush the shorts again next quarter. It is an unstoppable freight train that will continue to grow at least for another 50 years. Cash flows and debt are irrelevant. They can borrow unlimited amounts of money at very low interest rates.I predict $300 by April, $1000 by next year, abs probably $10,000 in a couple of years."
"Wait, stocks can go down??"
Sorry for those who got fooled prior to xmas and sold out or shorted. Time to short will arrive soon but wait a little more.
Shorts must cover
Not a great product anyways. You pay 3-4 months of NFLX you’ve seen everything. Many streaming services have overlapping content. Streaming services are pushing people back to cable.
"Best Drama series go to NFLX at Emmy's award... Last time , Nflx won oscar and stock jumped 6%"
699 by summer
bubble always bursts
"Netflix finally admitted the obvious when it reported third-quarter earnings Wednesday afternoon, though: At least in the short term, the arrival of a slew of new services from companies like Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.06% and Walt Disney Co. DIS, +0.25% is going to hurt its new-subscriber growth. The company expects that subscriber growth will decline year-over-year in the usually strong fourth quarter and for the entire year, even with a strong slate of new shows."
"Today was due to Golden Globe.... Weeks later , Oscar is coming.... Hahahahaha.. Another rally.. Then earning... Oh god... I will be rich"
after hours :: schmafter hours
Goldman Sachs always tell the truth. Very honest bank. Trust them!
$350 coming
"Hey, just came of work and seeing a nice green day sofar :) No idea why other then it went down a lot while content and subscription numbers grew."
570 BY TOMORROW PROMISE U SHORT SQUEEZE
I've been saying it for months. This had to happen. 800 is next stop.
Fun facts - number of movie tickets sold in India is 2x the number of movie tickets sold in US. The total box office revenue in Asia Pacific is 1.5x the box office revenue in US & Canada. Those markets are huge and streaming services are in nascent stages. Huge upside potential for NFLX if they play their cards right. They do have one advantage - they are a leader in US and investments they make in creating international content helps them grow internationally and helps strengthen their base in US even further.

Netflix doesnt actually have a P/E multiple. They have no real earnings.
ROKU beat earnings! NFLX will without a doubt reach 525-530 tomorrow
Don’t get left out on the way up this week...
"So all the cheer leading over the weekend might have created this artificial move higher. And the cheer leading includes the white house. Its really hard to trust at this point. What to do here is the question? I feel like this should be much higher as well , perhaps fund managers are dumping into strength. We will see, meanwhile finger on the trigger to sell. If we are in a bear market then share prices will be brought lower during earnings for many techs, regardless of the numbers. Just my 2 cents."
I need to see a moonshot to 380 today to be happy
Anyone who thinks it’s going higher neck than day or 2 knows nothing about trading
will close in redfyi i am long
"What are the odds these guys say they will launch AVOD? Man, my Roku would love that"
Call sellers got to be crying.
I really can’t stop watching Netflix really don’t care for other companies.
"India has over 1 billion people, all wanting Netflix!"
"Folks the PE is still up around 170, down from around 250. It needs to fall by a factor of 10 for this to be fairly valued!"
It's all normal...intraday profit taking...lot of traders. Z
"Hello everyone! if by chance you have time and desire to discover a mini Netflix that already collaborates with NFLX I suggest you put in your watchlist CIDM very under rated stock with great potential now below 2$. The company's recent moves have resulted in near zero debt and great expansion. Some of the company's digital content partners include: 20th Century Fox, Disney, DreamWorks, Lionsgate, Paramount, Sony, Universal, Warner Brothers, Weinstein and hundreds of independent distributors around the worldp.s. sorry for my English"
"They should makes a movie about Netflix. We could call it ""The Day the Bubble Burst"" Remake you say?"
that was an absolute gift
Randolph taking a shot at Apple for “buying” subscribers and DIS for their copycat practices. I have Netflix and watch it often. Guess they are counting me as a “paid” subscriber? Only reason I have it is Comcast threw it in to my package while cutting my monthly rate....
If we stay above $400 we a definitely going higher
Any buying is met and overwhelmed with quick selling.
"Why SENS will dominate DEXCOM AND ABBOTT CGM in 3 to 5 years!CGM market is still in infancy. DXCOM, Abbott, Medtronic and Roche only grabbed <10% of CGM market today; the total number of possible diabetics who needs this device are enormous. More and more insurance companies are buying into importance of CGM capabilities in reducing medical complications. The total costs related to diabetes costs just in America annually is Hundreds of billions of dollars each year. It’s much cheaper for insurance companies to pay upfront fees to get CGM implanted then pay for treatments for leg amputations, diabetes blindness, end stage kidney failures, cardiac complications secondary to untreated diabetes. There are many more conditions causing billions of dollars in Medicare due to uncontrolled diabetes. CGM device is literally life savers for millions of people around the world. Currently there is vast untapped markets for both internal and external CGMs in India, China, Middle East, Far East, South America. CGM growth will be exponential over the next decades. Lastly, Medicare will be paying Providers almost twice more to implant Eversense CGM then Dexcom CGM. Main reasons for this? It cheaper in the long run to implant Eversense CGM. Dexcom requires very expensive external sensors changing out every 7 to 10 days. Eversense CGM, no sensor change needed during lifetime of Eversense implant. Great bargain compare to Dexcom G6 or Abbott Libre"
This needs to correct to about 240.
"people: whatever we do/say/buy/sell here it will not affect the stock price, as we only represent 1.74% of the total investors... only the institutional investors can move the price as they please"
Goldman Sachs reporting Netflix will spend 12 to 13 billion on content for 2018 instead of the 7.5 to 8 billion Netflix guided for. If this is the case it means subscriber growth is coming in much higher than expected.
I hope u shorts enjoy your .47 percent cause going up a few more percent tomorrow! lol
375 by next week
Today Netflix will be above 564$ probably 580$ or even more. Lots of good news. It is considered a safe play after it beat the estimates.
just short 50 shares of nflx. 
whoever said $20 up today...you were pretty close buddy!
"Good premarket movement, it’ll be back up to 400+ early morning."
We ditched NFLX in big numbers!Just check out your nextdoor Conversation
time to buy when others run hard and fast.lets wait for the big buying but nibbling can be done.
"I guess the high PE is scaring some investors due to what they say is nose bleed. Well I guess my AMZN was that way too at one time. But look what happened.Just #$%$ a major investor said years ago, buy what you like and others do as well, and invest in it. Well for me that meets the requirements for investing in Netflix. If I had to pay $15 a month I'd still use it.No politics, If I care not to watch them, and the greatest thing! No f,,,,ng commercials!!We do have cable for my wife by the way since she likes to watch her stuff. For me, I haven't watch nothing but Netflix for two years.I'll give a prediction. I think there is a good chance that Netflix will double their subscription base in 2-3 yearsWhy? because everyone I know has it and loves it>"
Who owns the content delivery network? Netflix Who built their own Hollywood? NetflixWho is forming relationships with top level producers? NetflixWho is the king? Netflix
holy. congrats to all shorts
See all you shorts at 330 friday
Bird Box was a lot of fun to watch. Finished House of Cards in two days. Netflix has quality production far better than major networks and rival HBO lineup.
First big close over the 50 DMA. Most funds wait to buy until a close over this technical signal. Upgrades and good earnings. This could be a nice run back to 400.
200 dollars at most!
wow......
Netflix stock price target raised by $100 to $465 at Raymond James in latest bullish notehttps://www.marketwatch.com/story/netflix-stock-price-target-raised-by-100-to-465-at-raymond-james-in-latest-bullish-note-2018-06-21?yptr=yahoo
Is this a bubble? I'm thinking it's heyday is past.
i FEEL PRETTY EMOTIONAL RIGHT NOW AND I'm only dealing with a 10K account. I can only imagine what people with 10 times my amount go through.. Unbelievable.
They can't afford a 110 dollar total fee for netflix for a year...but they want you to know they know something about something trading for 1 share at 3X that price. if it wasnt so sad..be funny. Z
"I said this on Monday. We would get about 4 negative days this week and 1 positive day. This is not the type of market to hold your money in over night. 2018 is much harder to make money. If you make a 5% or 10% gain in a day, you better sale in order to keep your money"
"After Thursday, on a positive earnings report that meets or exceeds expectations, expect $400.00+"
How about split 1:5?
"Sell Netflix, Buy Viacom CBS!!"
strong finish.700 by friday
Better sell at the open!!! Will slide all day
We watch friends and office because it’s on Netflix. Not gonna join other services only for these shows..but the dip
The move of NFLX seems some are confirmed that APPLE will buy it at $300.
I just overheard good news for tomorrow they going to blow out the numbers all time. 450.00
I can already feel another short squeeze after AMAZON reports earning today after the bell :-)
I’m still hopeful that we will see 600+ this week
"Buying more, thanks to I"
hoping for more analyst Target price cuts so this thing keeps going up
CIDM and DLPN are NETFLIX's up and coming competition so!!! I would jump on before they rocket to the size of this company both companies have been buying other businesses left and right
lets hope Monday is a good day and the rest of the week is great.
I was long for the earnings pop but if it doesn't make new high I'm short.
"So, it's just as likely NFLX reports a blowout quarter that gives one more boost to the share price going into the 2019. It all depends on their guidance, and how open they plan to be. Apple got hit in January when they guided down but the stock has since recovered 80% from the pre-announcement price (155 vs 158). So, maybe NFLX thinks they can guide people to the punch bowl for a bit longer before the reality sets in."
WE'RE RIGHT AT THE 50 DAY SMA. ONCE IT BREAKS THROUGH THERE IS NO RESISTANCE!
450 next week plz
Goldman Sachs is angling for the lead underwriting role in the next capital raise by Netflix. Cash on the balance sheet will drop below $2 billion when NFLX reports on Jan 17. NFLX will need to raise more capital to fund another $3 billion in cash losses in 2019.
Hopefully to see another 2-3% up today!
Im bullish.. Netflix is the benchmark in the streaming market and too big to fail. There are still high growth possibilities plus profits will rise exponentially
Why in the hell they have Just PUMPED $NFLX BUBBLE by $10 Per share in 7 seconds???How the hell is that possible????
Obama is now running the show. Not doing so well.
After earnings report yesterday they already got around 40.000 new paying members!
"At this price and Disney price, It take over Disney in valuation. Unbelievable market and incompetence analyst who just know to add fuel.Why am I complaining. I am actually very happy because at this price it's almost risk free to short as long as I can control my greed, I will make solid profit on this.So my special thanks to trend follower and analysts."
buy nflx
I will buy around 283 for the bounce.
We need another upgrade from any banks!
"While good Quarter, I am sure everyone going to ignore but marketing cost is keep going higher.it raise from 271,270 to 479,222. that's 76% raise. This clearly mean company is spending lot more just to keep stock price inflated. I think company need to finance negative cash flow so those marketing cost is justified because that way they can keep getting better rating and more interest in debt."
does anyone know how much people pay to subscribe to Netflix in India?
wow! volume at 55 million! impressive!
I am happy with this trade today. It recoveries all my lost from TSLA and NKLA last year.
$360 opening tom morning
Ain’t scared...I’m a sport guy and I find myself on Netflix everyday
WOW! WHAT AN AMAZING DISCOUNT TODAY ON THOSE AUGUST 21st $500 CALLS! CONGRATS TO DIP BUYERS!
I have a feeling I’m gonna regret waiting for a correction....
IT WILL HIT 570 TONIGHT
"$TSLA $NVDA $FB $NFLX , these are heavy volumes on the downside. Pretty scary."
So. high. .Wait for better price.
Predicting the daily rise and fall of a stock with the same probability as flipping a coin $AMZN $WIMI $NFLX
what is netflix? i got amazon video and apple tv for free.
Many mutual funds will buy more tomorrow.
how high do you guys really think this name can go?
Boys Netflix is going green tomorrow!!!! Great company with a lot of potential....
why the sell off.. ??? there is no news out??
"If the stock did not crash with a poor earnings report, can you imagine where it would be with a excellent Q3 earnings! My guess is 600."
"Where are all the 1000 share holders today? 56,590 Bucks one day loss is big and it did not even trade on the open market yet."
"Netflix is going to have to lower prices for *US* custoemrs as well. Here is waht Disney owns:Disney (Mickey Mouse, Snow White, The Jungle Book, Bambi, Peter Pan, Frozen, etc.), Marvel (The Avengers, The X-Men, etc.), Pixar (Toy Story, The Incredibles, Finding Nemo, etc.), LucasFIlms(Star Wars, Indiana Jones, etc.), 20th Century Fox (Titanic, Avatar, etc.),Miramax (Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill, etc.)Withot access to that library, NFLX is going to lose subscribers. The Star Wars and Marvel movies will drive away a lot of Millenails, and then familes will go to Disney to entertain their kids. NFLX will not recover.Also, Disney now owns 2/3s of Hulu, so they have Disney+ for familes and Hulu for those that adults that aren't intereested in aniamted flicks."
The money is flowing out from Netflix to other sectors. It is about time. NFLX is dangerously expansive. Defense sector should be a safer investment
Sell it folks
I would not buy anything until things come back in under 50 or 100 day. The market is going to sell off through earnings season. Last Q was peak for most.
I wonder if Netflix is cooking their books?
FB sell off will definitely bring down Netflix but where do investors put that money. I can see IQ starting a run here
"NFLX $210. Target announced: By Trey Williams, MarketWatchNetflix's valuation is the elephant in the roomInvestors shouldn't worry about Netflix's rapacious spending -- but should be concerned about its ability to grow overseas, say analysts who started coverage of the streaming company on Tuesday.Analysts at Evercore initiated their coverage of Netflix Inc. with an in-line rating and a $210 12-month price target, which represents a roughly 14% premium to current trading levels.Lead analysts Vijay Jayant and Anthony DiClemente wrote in a note to investors that there are a lot of aspects of Netflix's story that are no longer debated. Internet TV is here to stay and the growth runway is massive. Within that, they wrote, Netflix (NFLX) has a huge head start.""The platform has reached near ubiquity with the help of an effective original content strategy, and a global mass market has emerged with streaming becoming the consumer's preferred way to consume video content,"" Jayant and DiClemente wrote"
570 BY TOMORROW
what can go wrong ?
$345 day after earning report.
Normal 2-3 day drop then $50-100 surge after good earnings call. Look at past blow outs
"For Q1, NFLX is projecting 6.35M subscriber adds. LOL. That's what they had for last quarter too, and they came in at 8.3M. Let me guess here. I predict they come in at 8.3million for the quarter, and the stock explodes up 8% on the news."
"Still over 3x overvalued, a fair price might be around $100."
It is clear to me that NFLX will rise past $400 in a few days...Asian growth not even factored in the numbers yet...wow
Oh....up some more....time to take some profits before giving it all back or even worse....become negative
Someone lend me money so I can buy a whole truck load. This going back to 400.00 soon.
"Disney planning big, will be in every country. Baba going big too, will be international"
And just bought 10 more $520 call options for tomorrow dirt cheap! bam!

Why the raise 2 days before earnings ?Fishy ?
"Netflix is value for money. They have so much valuable data, great AI and negotiating power."
I am so glad I hold . Markets green and this will be$450 Friday
"What has the bigger upside in 2019, Netflix or Amazon?"
"Funny thing is, there isn’t that much shares short... so it’s not the squeeze. Just hype."
"just sold 1/3 at 331, hope I don't regret"
"Great short term, but long term is difficult with original content when DIS and Warner leaves Netflix to start their own Netflix. "
are free subscriptions considered subscribers
"Hilarious that the most expensive stock in the most expensive market ever soared 10% after announcing cash flow projections for the year of NEGATIVE $3-4 BILLION. When this stock rolls over, it's going to roll over HARD."
Watch for this to crash like a rock once people realize Apple isn't gonna buy NFLX.
"My question to all the bashers, don’t you already have Netflix subscription? And if yes, did you cancel it after Disney announced theirs? I’m sure the answer to second question is no.Think about it before you bash!"
Take profits till it lasts
Here we guys the buying starts now. 380.00

All ER gains gone?
"Buy don’t miss the golden eggs train, once it’s gone, you will be standing on waiting at Netflix never returning station haha"
AH isn't helping....
if you have nextflix you would know why it is doing so well..
Could Netflix split again??
Nice Try. Looks like it's going to about 420 before earnings and then we will have to see what they release
We are up to .04% in after market. Should be back to 420 by tomorrow
"Happy, Happy, Happy!!!!!"
With all their debt and now rising interest rates and completion you have to wonder why they are screaming for HELP by raising fees this is a big gamble on their part if you ask me since they had a bad experience in the past by doing the exact same thing only this one on a much larger scale.
FIFA should effect this stock this quarter
bought and sold 400 shares this morning for cool 8k!
"Disney has contents, deep pocket, diversity business, P/E RATIO 23, stock price below $150. NFlx has stock price >$300, P/E = 99, no diversify business, little original contents. It will head deeply South in a year"
Almos 40% off its all-time high. Nothing has changed about NFLX specifically.
More democrats = potential for net neutrality = good for Netflix ? Is this driving the stock?

stock split!
up 27 today.
It's getting to expensive to buy for small investors. A 1-5 stocksplit would be welcome and boost the stock.

Hi it’s just got another upgrade to buy ILOVE IT GO NETFLIX 450 coming sooner then you think
Will Netflix hit a new 52 week high today?
This time next week All time high
"Netflix is maybe worth $30 right now... Everyone living in this imaginary land where Netflix can keep growing as much as they want. Fact is they need cash to operate and grow which they don't have, last year before financing Netflix cash flow was negative 2 billion dollars, just losing more and more every year. Bonds funding this debt start maturing 2021, price of them is already dropping. Who would buy 10 year junk bonds from Netflix at 5.5% when 10 year treasury notes could be yielding 4% next year?They are going to have to up yield of the bonds they issue in hopes someone will buy them. But if they up the yield of the bonds it means they need to increase their profit margin which is already way below the rate they are paying on current bonds. They can't afford more expensive debt. Its irrelevant how many more subscribers they get or how great the shows are unless they start getting positive cash flow very soon.Fact is Netflix future is in their creditors hands, Netflix has no control. Why invest in a company that can't control its own destiny when there are positive cash flow growth companies like AMZN, GOOG or FB? Makes no sense to invest in Netflix when you have much better options out there. So many places to get just as much upside without the huge risk Netflix has. Maybe they pull a rabbit filled with cash out of their hat and make the business work but they can pop at any moment and then everything is gone...If you want to invest in hype just invest in Bitcoin more upside with less risk as Bitcoin doesn't have creditors lol."
"Small portion in @$398.45, too boring if just watching"
and back on track for one direction
You hire Susan Rice and Obama and look what happens.
"Today's action should be a warning and constant reminder to shorts that with nflx, they operate at a severe disadvantage and often are fuel for spikes higher. Even at $192, while there isn't a fundamental case that supports share price, there looks to be only 1 thing that can drive it lower; heavy, sustained selling."
"Before you jump and mute me right away. Hear me out, I am not here to spam but to bring exposure in a gently manner. Check out CIDM and do your own DD but they've just met compliance yesterday and are a major streaming play with more partners and a larger library than Netflix. I am in on Netflix myself but its worth checking out CIDM. GLTA."
I’m not going to try and understand why and just ride the wave.
Ha. I'm gonna make so much money after Netflix 3Q tomorrow! You all stay scared and keep selling.

"Looking for a $250 entry, when will it happen?"
I love bubbles. There will be a time to short but not even close yet.
This is starting to look like the same set up we got with micron technology. All analyst hyped up the stock and everyone got burned. I think the fix is in already. We may not get the jump like everyone is thinking. This does not look good. Big money may be shorting regardless of the ER report.
"NFLX was up 40,000% since 2002.IQ is up 100% since it’s IPO March 29, 2018 as a spin-off of the Internet search engine Baidu.Move to IQ."

"Man, when will people start listening to me. We all have a thing called ""The world wide web"" And people want good things at a good price. Now, I have been researching this sector for years and I am a subscriber to Netflix but I don't use it. Now the reason why will shock you? They have the same shows on their since I started service. Now, let me give you an anology. If you have a starting five such as the golden state warriors and for years you are close to making the playoffs but then you lose in the first round if you do make it. Now, you trade some players or aquire all stars such as adding super all star Kevin Durant. You win the championship. Now, going back to Netflix is that they are not staying competitive and when Walmart which is way bigger than netflix will ever be starting their streaming service or how google is buying up the Virtual Reality sector you will see why Netflix will not compete. They need to clean up their business or they will get squished by its competitors."
all hype endsthis is the top for Netflix back to 80
Obama and Susan Rice frantically working the phones. Need upgrades ASAP. Funds drop more money into the stock.
"NFLX will have to pay dividends to be competitive with Disney. you get value and growth and dividends with Disney. Sell NFLX, buy Disney."

"French fries with a fresh Belgian beer, tonight The Witcher, tomorrow El Camino, sunday afternoon Claus with some hot chocolate and pancackes, what a wonderfull start of the vacation. Enjoy the holidays Netflix lovers!"
I advise any long to book some profit today. Even after analyst pumping so much end of last week. It fail to hold 315+ that clearly mean big player selling before earning. This prove my theory that it's help that Analyst provide so Big player can exit with profit.Now slight only beat or slight miss can bring this stock to 250 easily. They have to beat big time in order to justify such inflated prices. Analyst and big player know that. There is very limited up side incase they beat big time but downside risk start even with slight beat.
"I'm sure Buffett is looking at loading up on NFLX, it's P/E is only around 254! He knows a good deal when he sees one. And has said he likes to buy at a reasonable price. Not for the wide moat too! Bars open, drinks are on the house."
NFLX already guided higher during their Q earnings cc.....ROKU guided lower...wouldnt that mean that that NFLX taking their business? Will be interesting what disney says
maybe I did a mistake and sold everything at once.. looks like it will grow moreanyways that was the easiest 45k I have ever made
Earning one week later...... I added 1000 more.
"I'm sick of this board, what's on Netflix? "
Buy now another blast off is coming 
"Google trend data suggest Outlander season 1 and 2 has a bigger viewing audience on $NFLX than any season ever had on Starz. Does this draw Netflix subscribers to subscribe to Starz for season 3&4? If so probably not for more than a month before they cancel, but sure shows the importance of scale. LGF is more valuable apart of another network than on it's own, it's so obvious."
Congrats to all long friends! Patience always pays back. $400 is not coming soon enough.
Selling at this moment will just loss more.
"If Amazon trade at same PE as Facebook, Stock world drop 80%-90%.Growth rate until recently Facebook has higher than Amazon. Market is very unfair with $FB and rest of stock market compare to $AMZN and $NFLX."
I don't have gut to buy NFLX at $391. I may get in at $325. My experience tells me loss/win ratio is 80/20 at current price. I will wait for the bubble bursting this week. At the current price I would rather buy Fb with much better valuation.
cramer would call nflx a buy once it reaches the moon. buy now at bargain
Stranger Things was responsible for a 14% boost in Eggo waffle sales LOL
"seems to be a trend. high of the day around 10am, then lower highs and lower lows."
Another over priced turd to short into the dirt.
This will head higher as people anticipate the higher revenue in q2. I’m guessing most subscribers stay on because it is very cheap. And they still have room to grow albeit not as fast as this quarter. The key will be content. Original programming is pretty strong. I do wish they had a more extensive movie library. But I know that it’s their original programming that sells.
"The whole tech sector has been squashed, not just NFLX. There is nothing wrong with the company, they beat last earnings and are continuing to grow. If you own, hold. If you don't own, BUY. Netflix is always exaggerated in it's movement, when the market goes back to an uptrend this will soar very quickly and erase the losses. The ONLY losers are those who sold their shares for a loss out of fear. Fear, makes some men poor, and others rich."
"AXXA, check out market cap vs revs. It's a diamond of a stock"
"Reed Hastings on DIS' new streaming service:""“I know I’ll be a subscriber of it, for my own personal watching,” Hastings said. ""In the end, Hastings asserted, all boats will rise with the streaming tide."" Guess Hastings doesn't agree with the pumper on here."
$420 to $265. I originally bought at $212 and watched it almost immediately go up to +$400. Sold $350. This down drop has been tough to watch.
are they making adult x movies
"The big drop comes after Disney pulls all its content from NFLX later this year and sets up its own $6.99 service. Amazon throws its streaming free with Prime. APPLE will not enter any business unless it is in the top 3, but it will likely bundle its movies. No company plans to make any money."
We need an upgrade! Soon!
Icahn sold his at around $50/share. If Buffet was lucky enough to buy when Icahn did he would still be holding. He said his favorite holding time is forever. Buy and hold is the best strategy my friends.
5 for 1 Split coming soon
"I know I missed the great run up in the stock the last few years, but I couldn’t resist any longer and bought in at $318. Hopefully Netflix will double by this time next year!Congrats to all the longs who have been in this stock the last few years!"

this will be green by lunchtime
$550 coming soon. You are not to late to load up! earnings are going to be fire!!!
$520 looks like a good entry point. I don't think you would lose money if you bought in the last couple days. But you would have to hold it for a while.
Every penny gained off the earnings report...gone.
Retails and big holders are getting antsy with the valuation and will start trimming position.
"NFLX will hit $300 soon, if market is not so panic for no-reason!"
This is the quickest 60k i made AH
"will have the biggest one day gain since 2008. $qqq , $nflx, $amzn ,$ appl"
I’m shorting my shares at this point. It has increased too high too fast.
"3,75% plus with no new news. What will happen if they anounce the new CFO this week. |This stock will jump fast!"
I got in at $188! Long and strong!
Even Mr wonderful from shark tank said loves Netflix and going to buy more it’s a no No-brainer
Buy NFLX on the dips. You can’t go wrong.
Who bought a $480 call for Friday?
Hi again. Where’s that “$600” everyone was hyping just a couple of months ago? Hahah
Buy at $275
337.50 before friday
ok looks like it's making a comeback.
Netflix international is growing at amazing rate... Obama internationally is very popular. You Are Looking At The Next General.. if you leave politics aside this is a great move..mho
fire Susan Rice cancel the Obamas this stock will rise
Netflix stock price target raised to $480 from $435 at Pivotal Research
Finally finally finally Cramer has acknowledged what I have been pointing out for two years. The NFLX quagmire of content spending and customer retention is unsustainable and will lead to the ultimate demise of this company. It’s a mathematical certainty
During last half hour share volume has dropped dramatically. Sometimes this means a bear trap is being set for after Europe close.
Whoever buys this stock at these prices needs their head examined
any predictions as to what will be the opening next week? I want to get in to but at right price.
"$600 coming, hold on to your seatbelt"
"Some day the entire market will just consist of NFLX as it never goes down. And that makes perfect sense. Perfect. Who else will be able to stream content but NFLX? And that $12 Billion in debt which isn't listed on the balance sheet won't ever matter, even after DIS takes all of its content off NFLX and starts its own streaming service. NFLX RULES!!!!!"
Watch she is dropping!!
last earnings it was hovering 400 albeit it dropped after the good earnings. now it's at 20 percent or so less.
$NFLX $FB $WIMI hopefully we go strong in the morning...
12 point straight up days always follows with straight down. Let's see if the trend is bucked tomorrow.
"Remember when FB dipped during the privacy saga? It bounced back within weeks. I expect the same with $NFLX. Also, $IQ has enough positive news to help continue the momentum. Might cool off a bit tomorrow, then continue upwards by midweek."
Disney plus is advertising all over NFL games this weekend. This is really going to be a major subscription loss for Netflix.

it’s ok to take profits
To the Moon Alice.......
LOL @ at those who said it was falling 20%+ today. thank you everyone for this quick cash! glad i bought it in AH yesterday.
Netflix has always beat subscriber expectations whenever it releases the first season of a big hit original series. The Queen’s Gambit is one the biggest of them all.
"Ok, picked spots wisely, shorted a few shares at $315 whole figure - 315.50's, this is a temporary top. Declines on profit taking will be swift and short covering is drying up here as well. Going to let this trade play out swinging short. Stay nimble folks...VA"
"got in at $124 will get out at $2,124...."
"funny , 3 comments about heavy overvaluation and this stock recover emidatly."
Lol to the shorts...
THE BEST SHORT STOCK IN THE BUSINESS!
see you all at 200 in the next few days
I bought at $400. Will I ever make my money back?
LOL Hulu increased their subs to 7 million to nflx 5 mil. That has to be a concern
Don't do it...don't buy a single share. You've been warned.
There are not enough questions being asked on the profitability of streaming services competing with Netflix.
LOL Goldman seriously reiterating $400?! NFLX has $8 billion debt and only $500 million annual income with slowing growth in a saturated market. So obvious Goldman is pumping and dumping before next earnings.
$19/sh rise on this stock in one day is totally absurd. Market deserved a recovery today but NFLX's rise is insane.
350 next Friday according to outperforming earnings
"I agree it's a good company but there's too much speculation already priced in, and earnings won't live up to that. short now, buy wednesday."
"The Stock is $2,760 per share, everyone forgets it split 7 for 1, so it's actually doubled up Google, Amzn, and it's a one trick, Streaming Service."
"How come Netflix is down? Their earnings will be great due CV situation. Every family on the planet is now Netflix & chillin. Millions of kids watching Netflix becouse their school is closed. Companies like Tesla will loose, there is literally nobody buying Tesla car. Market is losing due panic, but after CV panic end forever there will be great earnings for Netflix and really bad for Tesla. I took them only as example. Don’t invest in stocks that will crash after their earnings.$TSLA$NFLX"
"I don’t see any correlation-ship between FB disappointing revenue and NTFX, two different business models. I guess it must be the FANG thing!"
100 day MA 341.34
Revenue run rate Is 21 billion a year. Revenue growth was 35% y/y excluding negative impact from foreign currencies. How is anybody going to touch them?
Very good news. There is 40 % chance Apple will buy Netflixhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-dips-billion-dollar-toe-161414012.html
There is nothing to watch in Disney NFLX rocks
This should gap up and shoot out tomorrow. Time to test $600.
"Nflx added more subscribers + raised the price, but the earning per share did not meet expectations. is that make sense? Not for me."
What a bargain!
Fantastic recovery for -15% to -7%. in a matter of hours. Will this be 390+ in two weeks time?
Let's hope it closes green today
"Monumental comeback.. come on, make your way to 325 now.."
Now NFLX needs to announce a split 5-1
A small bump rather!
"Scale is very, very powerful in the media industry. Henry Ford could only sell a car to one customer. Reed Hastings can sell a movie to 1 billion customers."
"Ive got a good percentage of my portfolio in NFLX. Its been the main stock that has drug it down since last October. If this happens to shoot up even close to my net cost, im dumping it. Ughhh.. My luck though, it will tank after earnings... hope not, we'll see..."
it wasn't a movie that killed our Embassador it is Susan Rice that will chill 50% off the value of NFLX. Sell this poison now
it's only 15% after 100%+run-up..........
"Everytime market caves in the morning, it ends up closing green"
"Said $335 closing price, pretty close, anyways congrats to all alongs. $400 is soon to come, huge rally coming up and solid earnings are boosting all sectors. Financial leading with solid revenue and earnings especially Goldman Sachs beating EPS by more than a $1, economy strong and forward outlook of 4% GDP by mid 2019."
"NFLX has no moat! Really? $13 billion in original content and 122 Emmy nominations will be put together by a Walmart! Really, Disney is going to Mickey Mouse a challenge? Comcast - ever dealt with their customer service! The only true challenge is Amazon but it is too distracted and holds a fraction of viewership. NFLX is light years ahead of any competition and it simply needs to execute - in Reed Hasting’s astute leadership, NFLX will continue to flourish."
having Susan Rice and Obama on Netflix will only encourage non-americans on the Democratic side to subscribe
when announce pialways shoots upthen crashes back
Trader sees a breakout coming for Netflix https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/20/trader-sees-a-breakout-coming-for-netflix.html?__source=yahoo%7Cfinance%7Cheadline%7Cstory%7C&par=yahoo&yptr=yahoo
Last chance to buy in folks ...it’s going to rain after hours 
looks like a double top to me.
Bought at 494$  Expecting to hit 530$ next week
"Avoid buying and book profit. This is fraudflix really. Huge fraud that I think going to come out sooner or later. Even it's not comeout, it's worst than pyramid scheme and only good thing is, if who ever doing it go undetected (Only Another fraud Bribe keeping them safe so far) They going to take benefit of both end.When going upand Then When going down. Because they are controlling how many subscriber getting added and reverse also they control."
It needs to test the Monday's after hour low of $342
$320 today $420 next then $520 which is the PT by Q2 2019.
"Upon launch, Disney+ will include ""at least five content channels"" including Disney, Pixar, Star Wars, Marvel and National Geographic"
Thumbs up if you held this over night
Wake me up at $401 please
The run to 750 begins now
"Wow , stays green.."
What a frustrating period with this stock
It's a joke that this one idea company is being valued higher than DIS which has a real assortment of businesses and which owns its own content. Markets have gone BONKERS!
my opinion. No installation. No receiver box. No special changer. No dish on top of my house. No contract. No 100$+ monthly bill. Most Emmies won because of good original content. Bottom line is they have successfully leveraged the Internet to deliver entertainment cheaper and evey day more people are signing up.
There’s no competition for Netflix top growing subscribers
No news why down?
Easy short here. Watch this break 300 handle tomorrow.
"NFLX surging, congrats Longs!!!"
what are the technical indicators for NFLX? more downside?
$325 is coming before lunch stat your buying. You should of bought yesterday it was your last chance to get it at a hell of a discount. It was a early trick or treat
50% chance this opens above 600 the next day after ER.
Made a big mistake of buying 1800 shares of this stock at 278 earlier today. Now negative 14k! Hope it gives me a chance to break even tomorrow!
Looking good so far.
450 after earnings
Where have all the haters gone? And the short side Disney pumping media analysts?
This one's gonna keep going up. like tesla. still not too late to buy some.
Will exceed subscriber growth forecast. So happy to buy more on the scare! Will be $450 by mid November.
Can anyone explain how company expect $31.1 per subscriber in 2018 quarter when They only make $28.75 last quarter.Is another price increase. Is this company getting too much comfortable with value they provide?
"Highest number of open interest contracts expiring today (4,4509 contracts) strike of 550 so heads up it will keep drooping next 30min to hour and might see a drastic drop"
"Invest 10 000 in netflix a year ago, the ceo is a very intelligent and wise man, hes able to adapt netflix, netflix will win im sure, more and more people getting netflix account day after day in canada, europe and Africa."
What will happen to the shorts tomorrow?
"Is NFLX just another Tesla? Huge quarterly miss and stock plunge, follolwed by a huge rally off the low in anticipation of a much better 2Q? We will know about TSLA when their earnings report is released on July 24."
Did anybody mark my post that I wrote on Monday?335 by end of week375 end of September (it will be end of August actually)And 400 end of year. I was right on my first prediction
this will start to slowly bleed I to next two days
"10+ million subscribers this quarter, but hey... That's just me. Glta... I expect great beat either way"
"OMG spending on content will have to be drastically cut to stop the cash burn, and of course, subs will cut their subscription by the 10s of millions!Hilarious fact!"
Disappointing to see this before earnings.
"So judging by how much $AMZN, $GOOG, $FB and some others have dropped after hours due to the miss of $NFLX, $NVDA should wear the loss like a badge of honor as the company has arrived?"
Monday should recover?
"When old media come out with a steaming service they say won't compete with Netflix, or a service that reduces the time of a TV show or movie to 10 minutes, or a service that pays you to stream video you know the streaming wars are over and Netflix has won."
Can this be why this is down today?https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-hires-key-netflix-engineer-in-bid-to-boost-subscription-services-11580324237
close today: 342.19
"400 million customers by 2010, $1,000 stock"
from a chart point of view Netflix is at the bottom completely washed out and oversold. its a great entry point imho
"2000 share options straddle contracts. 1000 calls, 1000 puts. I'll make money no matter what happens tomorrow."
"You can’t talk about the entertainment industry without bringing up streaming service Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX).Historically NFLX stock has been an expensive play, but a worthwhile investment because the firm’s position at the top of the streaming space looked very solid. However, recently Netflix has seen a major pullback as investors started to worry about rising competition.In just two months, NFLX stock has seen its share price fall nearly 20% after the company’s second-quarter results underwhelmed the market. To be sure, Netflix isn’t flying as high as it once was, but the firm’s commitment to creating quality content is likely to keep the service from succumbing to the increasing competition in the streaming space. Plus, although NFLX is nearing saturation in the U.S., the firm still has a huge growth opportunity in India, where its content has been well-received so far. So, while the Q2 results were admittedly disappointing, this pullback in NFLX stock makes for a buying opportunity."
$450 puts will print next week it will be a bloodbath
On the news after hours yesterday NFLX was down 3 points. After the day traders were done and the news analyzed this WINNER soars nearly 20 points into today's action. This stock's share appreciation is far from over.
Would Netflix buy CBSViacom and really give Disney some Streaming Competition
"With so many of their programs trans-homosexual themed, not many can relate. Not interested."
"For all the shorties out there saying the P/E of NFLX is too high, keep in mind that Amazon's (AMZN) is 213, and we all know how that story ended up. Don't listen to the shorties on this, they have money to lose and are trying to get people to panic. They just want a few bucks in the short term, while us longs are making money hand over fist. Everyone knows that NFLX is the entertainment platform of the future and a solid company."
"Like I said, the market will do its best to separate you from your shares. Ignore the volatility the story is still ongoing."
one day before earning it would be 450 or 460.
Funds are buying.
Nice movie bird box
Only 115 points away from 400. WE are coming
500 by December
look out below!! here it goes tanking !!
"Looking at picking up 10 shares or so, best to wait or get in?"
fantastic results
NFLX will be above 280 tomorrow . Buy now . Very successful line up of content and then all carriers are offering netflix . NO one is going to develop content other than big boys like Netflix . Every one is going to pay them for content . Disney has long way to go . This qtr will be huge specially global .
If most of Hollywood is against the same people that pay their salaries. This is not going to end well when the liberals are trying to burn the constitution.
Relax...markets red today so it will dampen the rise but when markets go green...BAM!!
Tesla teams up with Netflix to distribute network satellites for TV.
Walmart’s entry into streaming will crush NFLX as it will under cut prices and quickly gain the middle to lower end of users who are price sensitive. NFLX is built on house of cards with negative cash flow and loaded with debt and burning what cash it has.
"Bubble Trouble....Right now NFLX is selling for a whopping and nosebleed......117x.....(18) estimates of $2.73. Why is this alarming ? NFLX is estimated to grow only by........................ 42%.......from (19) to (20)On the other hand, TXMD currently trades for less than .................10x......(20) estimates and is estimated to grow revenues and earnings in excess of 50% annually between now and 2023.Jefferies Group already has a $1.51 estimate for TXMD for 2022. If TXMD just trades at a modest 20 forward multiple, TXMD is a $30 dollar stock 2 years out....... Valuation matters "
"Yep, like I said, NFLX is going to 600 very quick. Get you some Disney hacks!"
Netflix is still a great stock in my opinion. Should be worth 3 times the amount or more.
TOLD YOU Last week was a FIRE Sale
Netflix will be worth buying when they start offering more movies and content I want to see rather than just their own stuff...Its not all bad but come on...
1000 by year end
remember the short sellers and haters at 325. Lol it went back up to 386. I see a recovery before earnings next week and if they meet earnings and subscriber numbers it will hit new highs
people that keep talking about option volume clearly don't understand the highest volume will always point to current price...look at the open interest that is your actual clue of what is to come which points to 550 dip and upper range of 570
shorts take profits today before option expiration tomorrow. after shorts covering Nflx will tank Monday next week
"I'm not short or long NFLX, I really just want to know how a company that does $100-150MM/quarter can be valued at $110billion..."
Hold.
Honestly speaking i am impressed by Netflix contents lately. They are becoming very innovative and the contents are top notch
Should Apple buy Netflix? Does it need to do this?
Obama not happy with this actionHe will have zombie Joe sign an executive order to boost the stock price
put all your money in Netflix and just wait. u will be rich!
"Look at the Balance Sheet. The unamortized content costs, massive debt and recurring negative cashflow. Plus the competition has just started. Really shocked on the stock price but this will drastically fall. Might not be today or tomorrow but fundamentals are terrible and it's a matter of time."
Don’t worry you think this is going to be red everyday or green. It has to go up or down sometimes. But it will run up faster then fallen. It could happen today or next week 400 see you soon
The Citron #$%$ did the same thing with Roku dropping the stock over 10 points

Michelle Obama's new NFLX series will explain how to short NFLX and profit like Hillary did with uranium one. Lots of money to be made.
just wait when they announce the sub lost from The Office leaving netflix... dont underestimate the power of Michael scott
Some dolt just compared FB to NFLX. lmao Can someone tell me how they are related at all? Shows you how stupid these boards can be. How much debt does FB have on its book. How much does FB charge the end user? Two completely different business models but some dolt used FB to defend NFLX. Best laugh I have had in a while
can this stock spilt
We'll get a 4-10% pop very soon. It's been trying to break to the upside last couple sessions only to break down midday. Maybe Tesla and AAPL beating will bring forth such a pop in the coming days.
Sell sell sell. Debt continues to rise and competition is increasing. NFLX has no other revenue stream. Waiting for them to announce ad-based plans.
Global hits just keep on coming: 'Mindhunter' season two finally premieres on Netflix August 16thhttps://www.engadget.com/2019/07/12/mindhunter-season-two-august-16/
"LOL @ Netflix. When your biggest competitor is Amazon.com, should your stock trade at 300 times earnings? Nope! You should have a bankruptcy lawyer on speed dial. It's hilarious that Netflix trades like a world-beating monopoly. When in fact they compete against the deadliest and richest competitors on the planet: Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon. Will Netflix survive? Sure, quite possibly. But should Netflix trade at the most expensive valuation of any company in the market? LOL. Just ask Excite, MySpace, Nokia, and Barnes and Noble! Competing against any ONE of Google, Facebook, Apple, or Amazon tends not to be fun or fruitful. Competing against all of them at once is REALLY not fun! I wonder if Netflix could possibly revisit its 2017 levels? In 2017 the stock traded in the 100s all year. Now, just 15 weeks later, it's trading in the 300s! Is this a permanent change? To revisit the levels of just a few months ago, NFLX stock price would get cut in half. Gulp."
"I have so few short shares in Nflx, so it goes up or down will not affect me. 10 years ago, I used to listen to the pumpers and analysts in message board, I lost so much money. Since 4 years ago, I decide not to listen to them, and I recovered all my losses, and making profits. I guess some of pumpers working for the brokerage banks. My experiences tell me, Nflx will meet, exceed or miss ER expectations, it will go down within 3 weeks after ER. The high debts will eat up the profits. The current price is too high to sustain regardless of meet or miss ER. NFLX needs multiple products to survive"
I really do not like holding a position in a company when earnings hit but I may just try a short position on Netflix. I think the numbers would have to be great to move the needle higher and I expect them to be no better than good and maybe a little negative .
Wonderful deal !!!!
Looks like this stock will keep going up for no reason whatsoever
Lots of super wealthy people spend their time on yahoo boards.....
Earning next week Monday. Prepare for big gain
we close over or under 194 today?

"Upcoming split, solid day 700$ TP"
FANG = Overhyped and over pumped casino stocks!
Netflix has little competition which always comes from lower prices. Their main competitors cable TV are raising prices.
There it goes. Someone wanted a bargain and got it.
Selloff likely related to options expiration on Friday. I bet we see 52-week highs this week.
short of the day... starbucks
"This will definetly beat earnings. But those who actually insist to belive that the stock will be worth 400, 500, 600 within a week or two are just delusional. The big investors will cash out after earnings. They want their quick and easy money."
Trade war and tarrifs concerns along with higher interest rates has caused the market to re-evaluate growth stocks. The problem was a lot of growth was already getting priced into a lot of these names. So they overshot and now with this selloff will likely undershoot at some point.
Panickers feeling mighty atupid...scared money don't make no.money. z
I don’t why people would buy this stock.... LMAO
Netflix shining again
wow! nice buying opportunity!
Did you guys not read that management views this Q as a blip on their otherwise stellar predictions of future growth? They clearly explained why this Q underwhelmed.
Another split? 3 for 1?
"God Bless the Savior Donald Trump.Doing what he said, the truth. Elected, Tested, Proven. #MAGA Tax the World!#NVDA #BA #TECHY #ATVI #FB #NFLX"
Now green. I told you right? Rising oil price will shift money from retail sector to tech sector and others. Easy money. Tomorrow NFLX will be up 4%
Rainbow Financial Services upgrades netflix to 425pt from 395.
"This was there strongest quarter from seasonality perspective. They also tend to always do well and FCF is to be expected in light of stay at home environment. That said, this stock isn't a value play, its supposed to be growth play. Will new subscribers be sustainable even if they pull out great content? I think netflix's best days are behind it and absent diversifying their business model, probably is range bound at best."
Why the drop?????
iq is the next netflix
when does the earning report come out Thur Pre or market close?
Amazing day- where all others are deep red or flat NFLX gains ~4%
It is still down: supply greater than demand!

BTW what dividend is Netflix paying its shareholder/owners?What is Netflix expected capex requirements to continue producing original content vs expected revenue and cash in the bank?Questions to ponder on a day of ""irrational exuberance."""

"They’re running out of analysts to try and manipulate the stock with price target increases, got to feed this thing news every day or it starts sinking. I’ll be long again after this short when I get a way better price."
"You know the old sayin when something seems to good to be true it probably is. The fantastic content that NFLX creates comes at a very large price. $20b to be precise. Not including the $1.5b they recently borrowed. It’s Interesting that they go to the debt markets rather than dilute the stock. Further evidence of stock manipulation IMHO. Unfortunately for Netflix. There will be no way for them to reduce content spending while growing or even maintaining current subscribers, so soon enough the alarms will toll, the bow will break and NFLX will fall."
Total joke this market is
"Based off historic Netflix stock price, this is set to fall for a few days, have a tiny bounce, and then drop off a ledge"
Sold at $310 for an 80% profit. Going to buy DIS soon
"Today it's a buy, tomorrow it's a buy, next week it's a buy, next month it's buy, next year it's a buy, next decade it will still be a buy, in a century - you guessed it! still a buy!"

I wish my phone would catch fire so I can’t check this thing anymore.
I see closing at $365 today myself. It will take about end of the month or sooner to get back to 400.00 again.
The rest of the FANG stock earnings will continue to drive NFLX UP as well as the markets.
going ro 200
"Real Money contributor and former NYSE trader Stephen ""Sarge"" Guilfoyle noted that Netflix remains a favored short position of his due to longer term problems that persist in the stock.""The fact is that for many firms engaged in the business of streaming television, costs are only going higher, perhaps much higher as the field becomes ever more competitive,"" he explained."
IBased on today and yesterday price action I can easily can see a 20% shave after q2
NFLX should start buying and split

"if the world is at war, even more of a reason for people to stay home and watch Netflix."
If you compare to mcaps of other big stocks and earnings ratio no reason this cannot be 400b. Will just go up almost continuously like Tesla. Everyone starting to question the value of everything nowadays
"hits just keep on comingNetflix twitter:""The rumors are true. The tangled story of Morpheus, King of Dreams is becoming a Netflix series!

"No more subscriber growth, hence they have to raise price. Lots of other companies moving into this space. Netflix = next AOL"
just finished watching season 2 of Ozark. Great series. if NFLX continues to make content like this no reason why the stock can't rise to 400.
Can we see some green days plz....
"Netflix has highest content in global market to attract all customers from different countries . Netflix has become the part of comcast ,Verizon and other carriers as bundle key inclusion . All new Smart TV has netflix as part of smart gui . Kids are hooked to netflix versus regular TV . Guys this is bargin and buy here ...Look at my previous post and stock has done great versus any ohter FANG stocks .........."
The charts are saying its going higher.
"When is Hilaryy getting a show on nflx?It’ll be called, “Get Ready for Another Failed Candidacy!”"
Nice run for a second day!
450 after earnings call
"A lot of air under this one, drops could get dramatic."
Looks like it is consolidating for a big move.
"under 400 today, this is coming down fast could be 390 this week itself"
How many trump tweets will it take this weekend to allow his buddies to buy Netflix stock for under 200 per share?
I’m almost afraid to watch
"A hugely over-priced stock...and the fact that they're considering share buy-backs is insane!....they're barely cash flow positive as it is....they should be doing the exact opposite, SELLING shares at these lofty prices and using the money to fight off increasing competition.....the outdated ""maximizing shareholder value"" mantra comes a cropper eventually, just look at GE and Boeing."
300 today let’s go
Is this buying opportunity ( or selling )?.....
"NFLX mailed DVD’s 15 years ago. Their business model died, but they reinvented themselves as a deliverer of content online. Then, content providers started to play hardball and limit access to some content. NFLX completely reinvented itself and became a producer of content. It seems now that premium 3rd party content is the next leap forward. Perhaps, NFLX will need to again completely reinvent itself and sell premium 3rd party content; like, selling new releases at a per movie price, and not only doing subscription for unlimited video. If any company has been near death and figures out how to come roaring back...NFLX is that company."
"TBH, as a short, I almost start to miss the optimisim once abundant here."
Seems Like $FB $TWTR and streaming stocks went down in AH in sympathy with $NFLX
Will this be around in 5-10 years?They may have to sell a bunch of shares to stay afloat.
The selling resumes.
SHORTS DESTROYED. 
10 MINUTES TO THE CRASH!!!!!!!!!
Should do your dd. But looking at VIAC. By the numbers it looking like they still showing a lot of growth in near future. Plus divi I will keep my Netflix but Viacom is a good study lol
Second coming of winter to boost share of NFLX come Tuesday. New highs lie directly ahead.
NFLX will reach $ 408.00 today. Expect a solid 2nd quarter!!!
"Best non-earnings day since the Friday before earnings,10/12.Was able to stay green the whole day, +.16 was the low point. Best close since 10/33.Let's keep the run to 400 going!"
"Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.38% lower. NFLX is holding a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) right now.Digging into valuation, NFLX currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 80.93. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 14.77, which means NFLX is trading at a premium to the group.It is also worth noting that NFLX currently has a PEG ratio of 2.7. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The Broadcast Radio and Television was holding an average PEG ratio of 1.44 at yesterday's closing price."
"My Indian neighbor cancelled Netflix because he said to watch any good or popular movie such as Titanic....etc, you have to pay a rental fee between $2.99 and $3.99.....NFLX PE is way too high to justify the price of $265, many other attractive companies with much lower PE such as GooGle (PE 38), FB (PE 22), Amzn (PE 85), BABA (PE 40).....etc."
If amzn tomorrow also reports the prime video new members then you will see nflx at 430 at the end of next quarter.
Lets take this to $400 then we can have that 30% market correction.
"It is always hard to gauge the performance from the opening bell, I usually like to take the pulse around 10:00 - 10:30. At this point, we just need to see that there is still interest in this stock. Judging by what a lot of analysts and money managers have already said, it appears that the bulls may very well still out weigh the bears. We just have to hope they put their money where their mouth is. Maybe the whole tech sector will help buoy us up unless everyone is out to play right now with Amazon, Apple and the other FAANGs. After earnings season, maybe the chickens will come back home to roost. Good luck."
If the market is up tmrw $20+ if not $10+ easily
Still satisfied! My cost basis is $273. Regardless this will go back up!!
"IMO NFLX would not be increasing prices if they are losing Subs. This increase is going to add ~$1B domestically and another ~$1B from international Subs. Their model is working and Sub must be increasing, otherwise they would not be raising prices, esp in light of competition from DIS/T. I think 4Q earnings are going to be good.Good luck to all."
I say ER will be lack-luster. Numbers will be in line with expectations which is already priced in. Don't expect this to pop AH. Also ER better be spotless or this will most definitely fall guaranteed. Just my 2c...getcho popcorn ready.
thumbs up if you think it will increase at least 5% after earnings.
GREEN soon
Hasting will not sell all his stock if he is knows his company doing well. Common sense.
"Bye, Bye, Bye, wave to the onlookers as the train departs the depot. Shorts, have fun covering."
Added only 670K new subscriber. But how many of them are one of those free ones that received membership through mobile phone companies and other partners. They don't pay. This company never tells the truth.
"Usually there are number out before earning, no such preview this time. very likely a subscriber miss."
"What happened???!!!!going down too much..,"
Turned green but then quickly reversed course. This has no support at all. I can't believe this is the invincible NFLX. Literally the most powerful stock of the last 5 years. Dying right here. Even AH is down. Maybe this is truly the end and we head all the way down below $300? If this remains weak next week I'm out and will go short. Good luck to anyone trying to trade this. It had a furious rebound from the big drop Tuesday but then has turned around and just faded down 20+ points. Too much pain..
"Hulu, Disney+; Showtime, CBS; AppleTV. Case closed."
"$CSCO $WIMI $NFLX The current market value, I think, is undervalued"
"There is nothing wrong and everything right with NFLX except the price. It should be a great 20 billion dollar company capable of reaching 50 billion in 3 to 5 years. Instead it is price the same as Disney,,really? Disney. Pleaes do not be the dope holding this as hedge funds run."
"There are hundreds of channels to choose from soon to be 1000s. On internet tv. NFLX is just one of those thousands. They are absolutely a doomed company, they don’t have a sustainable pricing model."
Everyone ready to gamble? It’s black or redtoday. Could go either way in a big way. Doubt it just hangs around $350.
"come on baby, you can do it"
From what...590ish to 530ish. Quite a drop...
Just wow! I sold at $252 for a quick gain. But congrats to those who stayed in!
"simple economics for nflx. the most expensive item sold $17/month. does not justify the stock price of $356. aapl, most expensive item sold is in the thousands."
up another 10 today.
up $3.61 in AH
"Getting there, slowly but surely."
This is never going back down.subscriptions will Increase and price of subs will rise. Everyone loves netflix
Going up.... We will close at 375
"There was talk of people dropping their Netflix subscriptions when it was announced they signed a contract with President Obama, etc. I wonder if that had an effect on the loss in subscriptions?"
"These dips mean nothing. Netflix will continue to be leader in the streaming space. Disney will never manage to restore bargaining leverage.this mesaage board is now hopeless, should invest in mutual funds."
I would say the final hour of trading will be volatile. Where it finishes is anyone’s guess
First time this will go hard !!! 10%
I suggest to cancel your NFLX account. Go see your friends. Enjoy the summer sun. Dip into a lake or ocean. Hike under the trees.
Impeccable timing. https://youtu.be/RPU_u3TWvbk

"What do Americans think about hydroxychloroquine? In Africa, the death rate from Corona 19 is very low. This is because they usually take malaria pills. The president of Brazil is also taking hydroxychloroquine and his symptoms are improving very quickly. I've seen an article in the U.S. that one of the Democratic Party's female congressmen has taken hydroxychloroquine since she was infected with Corona19, and that her symptoms have improved very quickly and have been completely cured. Is there a lot of negative media coverage of the drug just because President Trump recommended it?$cpe $cdev $nymt $pvac $ssl $pvac $gild $pfe $mrna $appl $tsla $nflx $amzn"

wild.to is the next netflix. buy now while its still penny
Waiting until the closing bell for NFLX earnings report makes me feel like I’m back in 1995 awaiting the OJ verdict.
"Vix only at 13, Vix at 15 this is Sub $300"
who bought calls in the morning
NFLX cooking books ! how do we know that this is not all made up on the subscriptions ?
Just sold my Netflix shares. Cannot stand it going down further. Better to take profit. Now I bought more shares on amazon . Amazon Hugh earning release on Thursday.
This is the growth / momentum stock King of Kings
Watch for that pop tomorrow off the pull back today
Getting bought by Apple?
Why it is up in the AH?

market is cooling off. Even Microsoft didn't move much with an earnings beat after hours.
"Floods not open yet, imagine with volume,will be 100 dollar drop in no time"
I sold all my NFLX stock yesterday....going to drop much further
Controlled selling will continue folks until stock hits $200's. It's obvious that big boys are exiting but don't want it to go down so fast.....they want to get as much money out (small retail investors will be holding the bag).
it will drop back below 500 in a few weeks. no longer growing much and eps dropping. only sustained by jacking up monthly sub.
"Reed Hastings is smiling all day today, I wonder why ?"
"Closing green today, thanks to shorts for your contributions"
The last time they hike price in 2011 and next quarter they lowered the guidance and stock dropped 10%
"Take from a thousand families, give to one family. Thats how the US Stock market works."
Netflix valuation is elusive. For example: after reporting q4 2016 earnings the stock gapped up to 140. It was only 87 five months earlier. At PE 325 people were saying it was extremely overvalued. 140 looks very cheap now at PE 34 on this years est earnings and PE 22 on next years est earnings and the company still growing faster than ever. In a few years 350 will look very cheap.
Dont want to jynx anything but great strength netflix Wooot woot!

"""Netflix Earnings: Analysts expect the FANG stock to deliver a whopping 433% increase in EPS growth in the second quarter. That would mark the third time in the last four reports that Netflix has generated a triple-digit earnings gain. The stock has continued to stream higher since breaking out of a long cup-with-handle base in January 2017.

STOCK holders say FIRE OBAMA and FIRE Susan Rice.. NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Subscribers down because they have mostly international subs 72/130 million and the international community was busy with World Cup which is once every 4 years. Take a chill pill and buy it if it drops. I did.
Cineworld is set to close all its 543 Regal Cinema venues and its 128 theaters in the U.K. and Ireland.More Subscribers coming our way. Also more movies Netllfix can buy (at a discount) from the glut of unreleased films looking to re-coop their losses. Which leads to even more subscribers and consumer habits of using netflix and further cementing of Netflix as king. Netflix was already synonymous with the best in streaming. Now even more so.Netflix and chill.https://deadline.com/2020/10/cineworld-regal-closing-cinemas-no-time-to-die-delay-1234590897/
"Netflix is licensing its movies to China's iQiyi on a movie by movie basis, that's the way for the company to enter China."
"another Q, additional 524 m $ of negative free cash flow, around 2 B for the whole year and another 1.6 B raised in debt. Total debt is up from 3.3 to 6.5 B in one year. Looks good :) This company is burning cash fast. No wonder its debt has junk rating, but the shareholders seem to ignore it. All they look at is subscriber growth. It's like year 2000 is back."
"Peaking stock price of NFLX is a thing of the past. It has very very limited scope of rising from above this level. It has lost its monopoly. Original content can be produced by other competitors as well.With surplus cash, Apple can be a winner in the race. Disney content going away from Netflix can prove expensive to Netflix. Stock price will remain in this level or will drift down when Market correction happens."
Man. All FANG have been a big zero for six months. If nothing moves this ER round it’s certainly time to move on.
"Seriously folks, stock is up 70% since Jan 1!!!! What logic is there to justify such a rise in valuation? I want the same prescription everyone is taking."
Oh come on...enough of this drop.
"I made a mistake and went long too early with this, expecting a bounce back when it dropped below $300. Market seems to want to take this down more, and I remember several rides this year on the way up when it would go up for 6 or 8 days in a row. I now fear it could do that on the way down. The one piece of good news with this is the sub growth, which is going to beat expectations once again, but that is 3 weeks off. Cant hang on that long if this keeps grinding down. I will likely bail tomorrow if another red day. Good luck to longs."

not looking good. very weak open when the market opens strong. be careful
are you guys ok today?
Any technical traders confirm based off 6/26 chart open and 6/27 close that next level support is $380
so if nflx has 700 million users at $10/month...that would equate to $84 billion in 2018 revenues. How in the world are they projected to get $16 bill in revs versus $12 ill in revs last year while this goes up in market cap y around $15 bill/day. Irrational exuberance with a capital I

CMCSA and DIS are creating a lot of wealth for us. These 2 nutty companies are bidding so much for FOXA that whoever WINS this crazy 'war' will be in such debt that neither company will be able to make the necessary investments to compete. The Street realizes this and just look how NFLX has appreciated during these crazy negotiations of CMCSA and DIS. One thing for sure: IF I OWNED ONE OF THESE CRAZY COMPANIES (CMCSA OR DIS) I WOULD BE SELLING MY ENTIRE POSITION. NFLX is the one to play here.

450 today ?
"NFLX = $500 by August 1, 2018"
I think investors are panicking without even looking into what Disney+ is. It's not the same service at all. Not even close to be. It's kids content. I'll keep my Netflix subscription.
Netflix can dial down spending if they wanted.....but they won’t because there is a strategy in place here. This is an investment for their future as Reed Hastings said himself.
Who pays for this service?
"12mil new subscriptions, price goes to $440"

"For me Key question will answer in 4 hour. If this is 390+ I will have 2000 short. If below 390 I will have 1600 short.If there is sudden Sell off and close below 382.5 I will have 1200 short.I let market decide my fate for next few days as there is no point to sell put for little premium at such inflated price. It's very hard to make decision on whether start selling near money put (For like 25%) or wait for this excitement end. While this is way over done, I can't predict which price it will stop going up and start going down. Since Regardless it trade 340 or 400 it's way more over value."
Have any of you even seen the Disney app? It’s very average. After everyone sees the marvel movies and Disney movies then what?? It will take them a few years to catch up to Netflix. It’s not that impressive
When did NFlx split. I have been in my man cave for two months.
"Nflx is a day trade stock; It is not for long term investment. It pays no dividend, high P/e, a lot of competitors and debts. If you want to short, then wait after ER. If you are long, then sell and take profit before ER. A lot of unemployed people, they need to cut back expenses, not adding more expenses on unnecessary as Nflx, DIS. Plenty of free movies on YouTube. Why pay?"
Could go down on monday. But if they anounce a good new CFO or other good news before or on monday.... this will rise even more.
"NFLX Hi-Yield Bond Rating Boosted!

Disney now has all of Fox's content and will most likely pull all of it from Netflix when it launches it's own streaming service. There will be very little good quality shows on Netflix and people will have to choose between different platforms which will put pricing pressure on subscription fees. Growth for Netflix is having some major headwinds which will undoubtedly affect the share price...
This and AMZN my best stocks over last 2 years. Cha ching!

not currently holding a position but curious how revenue only increased 90 mil since last quarter on 7 mil net new adds??
Can someone educate me that how they only expect 21% revenue growth when they just hiked 18% price on the subscription? Are they only expecting 3% growth if they didn’t hike the price v？

"Netflix price target raised to $650 from $640 at Morgan Stanley, OverweightMorgan Stanley analyst Benjamin Swinburne raised the firm's price target on Netflix to $650 from $640 and keeps an Overweight rating on the shares. Media remains ""very cyclical"" and he expects 2021 to be a year of top-line strength, said Swinburne. While he thinks Netflix has been ""perhaps the most positively affected by COVID tailwinds"" given the long-term benefits from shifting streaming behaviors, the stock has not seen any multiple expansion, said Swinburne, who sees the potential for Netflix's margin expansion to ""break out"" beyond the 300 basis points per year level to which the company has guided."

Check out (http://Pick-stocks.com). They just mentioned NFLX in the daily newsletter.
Where are the analysts with their $500 price targets today???
Bottom line I've had Netflix forFREE 2.5 years. No revs from me.Used to be outstanding. Nowpretty boring. Actually PAIDfor a HBO MAX membership. 100% Satisfaction. If I owned this. I would be cautious ofpumping. Can't go up forever.
This should pop any minute now to 320
I sold 100 yesterday at $353...tempted to buy it back...
Netlifx bought a huge positive review campaign into IMDB.But The Witcher isn't a new GoT. Actually a far from it.

here comes the rise
"NFLX will be above $300 this week!market normally up in March if down in Feb., historically speaking.Thursday and Friday market will calm down and move up nicely, so leading stocks, such as NFLX, AMZN,BA, will lead the upside parade. If this does not happen, NFLX may delay to climb above $320..."
"The 2 previous times the stock traded sideways for around 1 year, 2014 and 2016, it took back to back good ER to send the stock rallying to new highs. It looks like Q3 will be good with the help of Stranger Things and Q4 has always been their best quarter."
"""In the last 3 months, 34 ranked analysts set 12-month price targets for NFLX. The average price target among the analysts is $412.59. Analysts compare their price target to the current market price of the stock to determine how much potential upside or downside movement there could be in the stock price."""

This is a technical trade from here since the fundamentals are way out of wack. Total double top. If the neck line dips below the start neck line is going to be very bearish. You could see another 30 points from there.

"All I hear is about content,..well with the new players in the bidding pool content cost may go up...Apple and Disney have the cash to buy the best programs out there...leaving Netflix the crumbs..unless they go deeper in debt...IMO"
speechless
Nflx goes up always

Well no $400 today
They have more subscriber & price raise yet they not able to beat revenue target. Market want to celebrate all little thing but this beat specially domestic beat is due to T-Mobile/ Cable provider giving free Netflix with their service.
"hold tight till noise cleared in first 30 min, will turn green"
$ROKU Bounced off nicely from the 50dMA. Profit takers and weak hands are now flushed out. New money should be coming in and we should be heading to $500.... $TSLA bounced off nicely after a long consolidation.

Netflix earnings transcript https://www.google.com/amp/s/news.alphastreet.com/netflix-inc-nasdaq-nflx-q1-2020-earnings-call-transcript/amp/
It will close at $340 and above tomorrow.
Time to break this one up too. Half of the stock value in America is tied up in such a few over-priced stocks.
Wow... Can this go even up tomorrow? Any thoughts.
Netflix is down 5.72% to 529.80
buypoint of the inside day we just saw a few sessions back is $556.42
Here u go again. A minute ago was just 509.60. Now already 508. Nasdaq is up almost 300 points and this one can’t even go back to 530 before earnings. I can’t imagine if the market is down. Where will that be?
"can someone give me some advice if I should purchase a stock of this rn, I am very very new but can see that this is a good price to buy and sell by the end of the week for a quick 50 bucks but if I'm wrong or anyone has advice id love to hear"

Does today's dip in NFLX have anything to do with: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/deletenetflix-campaign-erupts-brazil-over-145803294.html
Netflix is the best
"I just wanna say, now and the coming hard times in the market are not the time to be panicking, stressing and selling. view this as an opportunity to work hard at your jobs and earn as much money as possible to invest in every company you believe in at heavily discounted prices. you will be thankful down the road, you will be much wealthier than selling now. try not to take this on negatively, this is a chance that doesn't come often. yes I'm down 30% off my high point, and in time I hope to look back to this time and realize that the real money was made working hard and investing in this bear market"
Surprised it’s up so much given the revenue and eps. I guess subscriber numbers are good enough to offset. Congrats to those who had the nerve to hold through earnings. Given the last couple of quarters it was risky
They just hiked prices in Canada cool
"We have now gone 10 days without hitting a +10 on the HIGH for the day.Longest streak since going 29 from July 10 to Aug 17 of this yearFrom 8/20 to 11/7, the high reached at least 10 17 times.....This is such a mess......."
"Here we go again. Blood pressure up and down. Even, my medication isn't helping today. Where will this end up?"
Just picked up 900 shares at 283 and will be dumping soon. Easy money. Thank you
I’m out
Lmao. People still trying to push this to $600. Hahahaha
"Since holding $490, NFLX will trade above $525 by mid day!"
I say tomorrow is a coin toss 2-3% again up or down. Wednesday we bounce back to 360 + wishful thinking ?
"FAKE ACCOUNTS are being added to $NFLX to PUMP its stock price, as its earnings are tanking!"
"I’m no expert, but isn’t 380 in the opposite direction? Goldman ?"
"If you like high risk with a good reward, jump onto the Netflix roller coaster without a seatbelt."
There is so much risk in this market which is now at all time highs
Everyone on tik Tok is cancelling Netflix because of the subscription increase ..
Ahhh... NFLX. . Coming right back up to my favorite resting place. 300. Just with they had dividends.
Not sure if this stock will ever correct again? Its not allowed to go down I Dont think...
shorts are going to scramble to buy under 600. SQUEEEEEEZE!
"Is ""Bright"" so bad that now everyone's gonna want to watch it? Just to see what the negative hype is all about?"
Tomorrow $389
Nice close.
"HAHAHA this will crash, they dont keep enough new shows and movies to sustain increases"
"Oh my! On this great news, The Cutied part 2&3 announced!"
New high this week or $340+!
Netflix should ban Trump ahead of time.Twitter and Facebook going up !
Shorts. this not the time to Cry but time to cover!
Max pain for weekly options is $370. Dont be surprised if the market makers push the price their.
it will never hold 420+ says Cramer
350 by eow
"NFLX is a generational stock, it will keep rising as long as the Browns keep losing"
Could be 100 bucks streaming is slow sometimes.
Curious do people still buy NFLX at these prices? I was going to buy some put options but it is extremely expensive so I guess I am not the only one thinking this is going to drop hard in the next couple of years?
Heading to $335 and than $350 by the end of the week
I'm down 20% ($20K) on a $100K investment here. I'm not sure this thing is going to turn around. Should I dump or wait for a turnaround? Everyday it gets worse and worse.
Netflix bubbleheads still in denial. NFLX’s grossly overvalued shares will lose 90% of their value.
I can't believe this thing is still going up after the news about many competitions. PE close to 100. I guess this company has a great backing from Wall Street.
Bears getting crushed today
Crossed 575 resistance to 650 now. Keep adding..
"Here is the wall street disconnect for the day , NFLX double their earnings shares are down 3 %"
"There's still 21,904,200 short shares. The shorts will have to buy back in the next few days. More room to go up!Stay long, easy money. Another 10% easy when shorts cover."
"?? The market is massive, more than enough room for all the streaming services...Upgraded by Deutche Bank. Besides, Net lfix is heavy hitter original content, they don't have to rely on ooold franchises, they"
"Wow, I am rich"
This will drop back below $500 in a week
I predict earnings of $1.58 and 6.8 million new subscribers. 52 week high on Wednesday. Buy now.
Susan Rice now says 911 was caused by a cartoon... And Obama is taking credit for AMAZON...
NFLX trying to break 6 week Flat formation entry or add at 338.98 per IBD
It’s going to 500 today after the bill
Disney will now have the opportunity to pull all of the content that belong to Fox from Netflix in addition to its own content
this is the most meaningless drop ever.
New to investing .... would like to start a portfolio of good names. Will Netflix be good for the long haul?
This is what alter ego Richard will look like at 1:01 pm when he realized he could have made most of his money back
Over $370.00 this week. Mark it.
ER push. I'm buying.
why! Why! why didn't we listen to those who said sell?
Most valuable media company. LOL LOL
And the castle in the sky comes crashing down
Don't understand why this keeps ripping higher on more debt and weak guidance.
https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/08/veteran-media-analyst-microsoft-will-buy-netflix.html?__source=yahoo%7Cfinance%7Cheadline%7Cstory%7C&par=yahoo&yptr=yahoo
"This has to be setting up for some unloading tomorrow, be careful"
selling? why...LOL
why do big companies announce earnings after hours?
It’s up 2$ after hrs
And this is trading up why?
"I am not a fan of Zacks but they have a fair and balanced article about NFLX on the front page. Unlike garolou and other pumpers, they write about both the opportunities and risks. A couple comments caught my attention, First, I have been stating live sports is DIS ace in the hole. Zacks wrote ""Netflix is in for a major streaming battle for years to come. And let’s not forget that unlike Disney and Amazon, Netflix doesn’t have any plans to entice subscribers with other offerings such as live sports."" And then, as any fundamental investors knows the balance sheet matters, ""Plus, Amazon, Disney, and Apple all have much more money to pour into content."" (which I have been stating in debates with garolou over and over. So while NFLX has to borrown junk bonds at a high rate to produce this content, these other firms have cash sitting on their books. Don't but garolou's ridiculous point that it's too late or that AAPL, AMZN, DIS etc will not take a hit on earnings today. Firms INVEST in businesses all the time which means losses upfront and then gains later. Be careful listening to the pumpers on here. They aren't being nice to you, they are trying to manipulate you."
Dead cat bounce.
"getting back to where I bought it. I'm at a break even on this now, the other techs I own are still coming back up from the hit, my valuation puts the Nasdaq at a 50% discount to the s&p 500 and Dow. Needless to say it is a better buy than most other world markets. Easy buy for long term."
350 seems to be the top for a bit. Many people came in for that amount a month ago. Now they are selling. After that who knows how high it will go.
2nd TV broken
NFLX chart kinda looks like head and shoulders forming.
Will this be over 329 tomorrow in pre-market ? Or just a 1 day technical bounce ?
Will go green before noontime and climb from there.
I think I might drink a 40 of vodka before the market opens tomorrow. Things usually don’t hurt as bad when you’re hammered.
"new shows are horrible...whats up with all these yuppie soap operas & depressing sci fi shows....even their documentaries about crime & serial killers are boring, you can watch better stuff on youtube...their big budget standup comedy is atrocious, that #$%$ died 20 years ago.....FUBO is the future.....smart team that really understands enertainment & what people want out of streaming...."
"Hold long, hold strong"
for all share holders who bought NFLX around $400 please remember you don't loose anything if you don't sell it ..Just hold on to your shares and check back in 2-3 months you will be all fine ....panic sell you give your shares to market makers for free
Keep on moving !
back to 550 perhaps?
Once again RIP to whoever bought at 580
It will go higher.
And as I said heading back to the stratosphere
Disney earnings next week
220 Monday
The future is in free streaming with advertising. How well will NFLX make the transformation? People talk about them risings price... things get cheaper in todays tech era. Apple showed us increasing the price of the same product can be the kiss of death. Then you hear about the overseas growth and growth in general. All growth is priced in at this point. Also many weak retail investors buying what they know....the type the that run when they see shares sinking
NFLX is among the best games in town right now!
Why down?
Netflix is trading high just because of buying back news. Otherwise they are losing ground big time. They will face real competition from Disney!
"nice, overpriced Netflix with disappointing earning results actually might finish the day on a positive."
"if it goes above 400$ its time to short it again.Netflix will soon see tougher competitions from Apple, Disney.... and they wont survive this. Especially Disney streaming service will take a huge bite from the companies viewer base"
Tomorrow 350$ Friday 400$

Time for NFLX to go...
Did nflx sell user data. This question needs to be answered.
Got in with the hype at 513.00. Next Tuesday is the earnings report. Anyone who think it will break 540?
Do you think this will split
Well its up again in premarket. We need this to start ramping up as earnings are coming. Can we keep it Green today?
"450 by Friday, going up"
Not getting out
"Closed all my position on NFLX. bye, everybody. Good luck."
"VIAC is a better buy - which one is more likely to go up 10-15% this month? Market cap is too high here now for consistent gains, and revenue growth is slowing down."
Will Netflix or HBO ($T) get more subscribers next quarter? Thumbs UP for Net Flix and Thumbs down for HBO......While I like NetFlix I actually believe that HBO will outperform on basis of their direct to streaming content strategy........

Do the Bird Box challenge with buying stocks. Put on a blind fold and start clicking the mouse within your brokerage account...haha
I just watched Netflix again last night. Didn’t even bother looking up Disney app yet.
"LOL NFLX is on a roll- first Susan Rice, then the Obamas, now... ""A documentary chronicling the life and times of controversial Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan will appear on Netflix in August."""
Shorty Shorts getting toasted. Better cover soon.
How are we looking for ER??!
soros made 2 Billion shorting this
after earnings released
This is now certified money order a gateway to play with the rich huge money flow on this.
DJ dropped -209 points in 30 minutes after opening. It will probably -400 point at closing today
Neflix golden Globe Nominations: 34 is the same as HBO (15) + Amazon (8) + Disney (6) + Hulu (5) combined. Think about that. Really think about that.
Single biggest indicator that Netflix will hit it out of the park on Monday is their Q2 guidance for 6.2 million subscriber adds. The previous high for a Q2 guide was 3.2 million. They really didn't need to guide that high unless subscriber adds were going through the roof.
Wow...and to think Blockbuster could've bought them for 2 million way back when. Imagine that.
One thing is for sure--Disney makes a lot of money off its movies. Nflx does not
"Happy to say my Netflix profit has reached 962% having bought the first tranche in July, 2013. So in other words it took 5 years. Be a believer in this company and you will be rewarded. Good luck to all."
Roku confirmed how much streaming is dominating. And we all know the current King of Streaming. SimilarWeb just updated their data and december was a very big jump with 2.09 Billion web traffic that month. its not the apps just the netflix.com webpage. So if you are going to short this going into earnings its your funeral.
34m shorts will cover soon. No choice. Contracts are up Tuesday.
Too many people buying put options expiring today. The machine keep it above $265 for maximum gain on the house.
Dow future up 400 + today no one can stop Netflix to fly $600 + Dow close today 1500 + point just wait
if you bought at $320 you're golden. wait for that $50 gains! I'm gonna go Netflix and chill 
wow...All of a sudden $382....This is impressive.
"what a volume today!, definitely tomorrow will be US$400"
volume is shot. largest open contracts again point to 550 strike for friday. VIX is poking it's head out. Exit now and enter back in 1-2 weeks later and catch the bounce look for as close to 500 but 520's might also be decent entry
"Big expectations for earnings means there will be a high chance of them not meeting those expectations. Limited upside, big downside, good luck to all."
I only own 10 at 332.00 USA I'm Canadian love Netflix
Algos are cooling off but hype on street with retail investors is BUY BUY BUY... guess what? Algos are smart to find the vulnerability and we make a double top near 298 today... last chance to sell near 300 before results
NFLX moves up 9$ today. Yeah longs!! And mms
340 by the eod
Options writers win again.
"Hi In France, Netflix is becoming very popular, more and more people want it. And Netflix is taking the whole markete, no compétition"
Sold mine took profit before it crashes down

"Todd Gordon was on CNBC after whiffing badly on his short trade. He tried desperately to say it won’t break out to new highs. After slamming earnings/subs and guiding next quarter for more than expected subs! His take is nothing more than arrogant and self serving. Like most of these other so called “experts” who lowered their estimate into earnings, some people never learn. I trust RH! Congrats to all longs...see ya’ll at 500!"
"dont understand, why down so much premarket?"
"The smart money is headed to Chinese stocks. The Chinese market is 20% off it's high. Baba, JD, IQ, Huya, Bidu. All going up. Mark this post."
Here is goes! Shorties are sweating it.... but we warned them plenty.
are we finally breaking out?
way too sudden of a jump IMHO. wish I bought the dip but just shorted 600 shares for a quick gain tomorrow sell off it will most likely hit at the very least 540 easily hopefully 515 is the target though and then 500 buy into it if it hits that low. this thing always drops hard after such huge pop always.....
"Here is another aspect to look at NFLX subscriber raise.If you compare NFLX is favorite among teenagers/young people. Which other app has similar user group. SnapChat.SnapChat quickly raise their subscriber (Faster than any other Social Media) but now hardly have any growth. Reason unlike Adult/Old who take time to use new things, Teneger /Young people will immediately jump on trend.In other word, Netflix might growth 200M very quickly but I think it will have very very hard time to grow beyond that. There are lot of challenges.And any one think they can raise price to justify valuation. Look how cautious they are with small price increase. They yet to realize raise after 3 month for most of subscriber. They will only realize after next 3 month. This mean price increase is not easy."
"Everyone predicting the death of Netflix because of Disney plus, not sure if y’all have actually seen Disney’s + but for the most part it has extremely entertaining shows if you are under the age of 7. Also this 10 million subscriber number doesn’t take into account all the free one year trials. If something is free everyone will go for it."
"Study this list, study it twice. Netflix has 11 of the top 20 shows (4 of the top 5) on Rotten Tomatoes:https://www.rottentomatoes.com/browse/tv-list-2"
"Is this some kinda joke???? Under 500$..,, Why??????"
goes to show trade with your gut not with people have to say they have their own agenda and everybody that was bashing was dead wrong.
STRONG BUY! https://cweb.com/2018/03/03/netflix-crosses-to-300-a-share-cweb-com/
I can't find any news for this kind of volatility that fast
Going up! $385
420 tommorow!!!
Just buy Netflix and chill. This bad boy will be back in 400 land before you know it
Sell when others buy. Buy when other sell. Take profit before losing it
--Analyst Actions: Bank of America Lifts Netflix PT to $460 vs $352; Maintains Buy Rating
7% market correction is long overdue
any one ever wonder how NFLX got to 220 P/E. It is like exactly like bitcoin manipulation. 90% of stock is instutation/private owned and only 10% is freely traded. Todays price is based on that 10% stock. Once the institution start to sell stock for profit NFLX will be steeply down like Crypto.
"And this is dropping why? Either it did well on its quarterly report or it didn't. Granted investors will take profits, but is there any rational reason beyond that for this to drop 5% in two days if the company is indeed doing well."
STA research raised PT to 571
I hope it drops so I can buy more NFLX!
Pull back is coming
For every user there are 5 sharing their log in info.
Looks like Conservatives Boycotts of Netflix because of the OBAMA original content is working. Not good to mix Politics with business. We saw that with Starbucks.
Guess holding at 375 was a horrible move
"Anybody knows of a site where we can read and post serious messages on stocks? Most people on the yahoo boards sound like 15 years old. I am looking where we can exchange with people interested in sharing ideas, news, data.... Not sure a site like this even exists....."
1/24/18- Netflix stock price target raised to $330 at BTIG
"380, 390, 400 and so on don´t get trapped in bears"
Let see the after-hour... South or north.....
"Just bought another 300 shares, this will climb the rest of the week forsure"
This is probably going over 600. Very strong earning reaction. Usually this stock will find any reason to fade and sell off after earnings pop.
this company has built an efficiency that is almost as good as car that runs on water (maybe better).
Friday 13... Most stock red... Jason is coming to town.
"Disney Lost 1 Billion dollars in streaming which wont start until later this year and it wants to compete with NFLX? What a joke! The media company , Disney, said in a filing on Friday that its investment in Hulu was the primary contributor to a $580 million loss in equity investments in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30. Additionally, Disney lost $469 million in its direct-to consumer-segment, largely from BAMtech, the streaming technology that powers ESPN+ and other over-the-top services."
Easy 370 soon
Hello YAHOO!! Quotes are not updating.
370 coming big block buys
"Wait, so now I gotta tell the boyfriend of the mother of my nephew's girlfriend's sister that he can't use my password anymore? Thanks a lot, Netflix."
Target $1000 !
"It will finish above 370 today, 380 by Wednesday"
"Shorts are active again. Love that sooo much. Means they get scared and know what is going to happen, Buy back with a big loss."
NFLX going higher and buying AMRN rocket Upside
295 this week...
Dumping cable for Netflix... makes sense !Why would anyone pay like almost $100.00 for cable television ?? ... and your monthly bills keep going up too/.Netflix have a bright future..
Netflix is the best of the streaming services. I have all three and Netflix is the easiest to navigate and use. Amazon seems to rent everything and Hulu has commercials. They will do well. But those unbelievers can always put a stop loss in the account just in case the worst happens.
52 week high coming by the end of the month. Today's turnaround is awesome.
this will hit 600 tomorrow hopefully split 10-1and we buy lower.........
The banks wants you to sale you shares tomorrow so they can pick it up at a lower price don’t do it.
It's up 40 cents AH. I'm surprised people aren't calling for new all time highs by week's end.
"We entered a secular bear market in october. Extreme high valuatuons (NFLX), low interest rates, high debt, low wages is what started this trend. The breakout of the markets in 2013 was not one based on organic economic fundamentals but rather through massive monetary interventions by Central Banks globally. The previous secular bull markets in our history we ones which were derived from extreme undervaluations, washed out financial markets, and extreme negative sentiment."
NFLX buying AMC..? Interesting news especially with shorts stretched at over 60% short on AMC..((((((((( BOOM )))))))))
March 29.... $320 Calls ...easy money...$$$$$
New Streaming ETF SUBZ started trading today and one of the top holdings will be NFLX
CLASSIC shakedown
All aboard next stop 350
No Bama...!!!! Is what the market is saying.
Wonder if signing pacts with Michelle Wolf and Obama has turned off a segment of viewers that normally would have signed up/stayed with Netflix. Saw the latest promo clip on ICE by Wolf and could see where her political controversies could hurt Netflix subscriber growth with Middle America.
"Looks like the 'cuties' controversy has passed. Americans are so over-reactionary. I only saw clips, and if anything, I'd say it did a public service by making parents aware of what some of their innocent little tweens are actually doing online."
"looking at revenue 6/30/2018 3/31/20183.907 most recent quarter3.700 prior quarter 3.907/3700 = 1.055941/05594**4 quarters = 1.2424 percent growth rate per year using the last quarter and the one before problem is th pe is 168even the forward PE is 84.4for caution, lets use the forward PE and let them have a PE of two times the growth rate (24%)PE 48 is two times48/84.4 * 369.61 per share close = $210 per sharebut that is using the forward PE and allowing for a PE of two times the growth rateIt looks like NFLX is grossly overpriced, close to 2 times too high based on the forward PEAnyhow, it looks like $210 per share is a more reasonable price, though it is still very high, since we used the foward PE'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''Using the PE instead48/169 * 369.61 per share = $105 per shareAgain, this is allowing the PE to be twice the growth rate.The negative net assets is a weak point as well. The liabilities are growing vey fast."
"if the same chart pattern as yesterday holds, it will close near the low of the day which is $360"
3 million shares in 45 minutes. That is heavy volume
People have said this stock is all about subs and they are right But it’s also the reason I won’t buy here. The first half of 2021 is a tough compare.
"Wow!! I am so glad I walked away from buying puts on this stock since the last earnings - just looked again this morning. What A GIFT above 400... for put options - And the guy with the new 500 price target saying that NFLX was the Lebron James of Content (as part of his 500 price target justification).. spoke to me that the END is near for both NFLX and AMZN... You know what I'm talking about if you paid attention in ""how to value a company"" class..."
so my $305 prediction turned out to be right. only it happened after hours....

Last chance to buy under 420!!!!
I got out just in time TY Netflix for my new 2018 Jeep
It is recovering.
Patience please. The stock was 3 when they launched streaming 13 years ago. At 486 it is above its long term trend line which has been going up 46% a year.
Don't try to find a bottom as it is much lower than this. Keeps making a new low...
You guys think this will recover within the next couple days?
"Short term closely watch the trend, this price is very attractive $GOOG $NFLX $WIMI"
How is $NFLX related to Nvidia?
"Sub acquisition costs, losing 2.00 a subGreat business model!"
From buy to hold
Fundamentals don’t matter......Until you offer 1.5 billion in Junk bonds.
Below 500 soon
nflx must has a lot of customers and a lot profit these times because almost all europe has quarantined last weeks. So i think earnings will beat the expectations.
bought some puts for tomorrow. probably see a consolation before hitting new highs.
netflix to hit 625 this time around.
SOCIALISM does not work...
At one time AOL metrics and market cap were eerily similar to NFLX.As subs started declining AOL went from 300 a share to 2$ in a matter of a year!Hilarious fact!
All time high in 2 months?
"Before Apple can win competing against Netflix they have to win against Hulu, Amazon and HBO who all have much more content than Apple."

Like Amazon but movies. Cinema dead.
"I read most bullish article about Netflix in seeking alpha. Who thinkin 2021 - Netflix will have 143M international paying customer, 75M usa paying, Subscriber cost raise 20% , and expect interest cost will go lower than current, margin will double, will trade at 48 pe.All combine he still value company at $408 in 2021. then he argue trade $300 based on 10% discount model.Now Risk reward analysis of his way optimistic number still make this stock work $200 in my opinion. Sure if it continue grow even after $DIS entry and without disney content, could worth $400 in 2021 But that 3 year out. Why pay so much premium now."
Nice pickup on dip in premarket. Easy $340 today. Thanks Citigroup.

"this is henry blodget, you don't upgrade after 20% move before earnings"
"The remaining pumpers and bag-holders just want to get out desperately to sell you their expensive shares, this is definitely a sell the news event with the extremely poor guidance."
Shorts making things worse for themselves
NFLX either has too many DVD subscribers or not getting enough disks. I've been a customer for years and now with 37 titles on my queues I can get even one shipped!
"RIP to whoever bought at 580, she be droppin soon"

"I think COVID 19 is behind us now. There should be more lock downs coming with COVID 20(UK strain) and a new vaccine will be needed so $TDOC, $AMWL, $AMZN, $AAPL, $ZM, $FB, $NFLX should continue to do well"

If you want to trade it. Always notice after a decent underperform day vs. Nasdaq...this always trails lowers for the next 4-5 days.
Crossed $370 today - we have resistance -- we hope:)The next time you see a $50.00 drop - remember BUY BUY and smile

"$4.99 from Apple, cancelling my netflix..."
"It was only a couple weeks ago when the shorts were posting that they shorted at $180, $190, $200. Hahaha"
Back to 360 next week
Hey @BD it's a green day for Netflix and I still think it's a bad investment due to competition growth and over inflated PE. My opinion has nothing to do with Netflix having a red or green day. I won't touch the stock either way. https://www.forbes.com/sites/ianmorris/2018/05/04/hulus-incredible-growth-is-bad-news-for-netflix/
As stated. You need an iron gut to hold a lot of shares in this stock. The moves are TREMENDOUS...both ways.
Did you ever hear about (http://Multistockalerts.com)? They just covered NFLX this AM
So today's plan is to PUMP $NFLX and Nasdaq BUBBLE to new record ABSURD Highs every minute with Falling Earnings...
I shorted 300 again at 322. Again 1200 short and My Average is $308 for short. Plan to cover 300 at 317.I decide to trade instead selling put because stock moving very fast and once I sell cover put can't do trading. I also hold couple $320 Calls with $1K premium. I am hoping it expire out of money. But May sell couple of put for those soon in order to limit my looses.

what's the expected closing price?
435 is the next resistance.
NFLX $560 coming soon! just look at the past 2 earnings and the channel that this stock has been trading!
Terrible situation with tech. Looks like 2000 or 2008 all over. I see no bottom. Sorry. Wish I did because I hold tech.
Mouse is old news. Netflix rules content. Watch for $300+ by end of this month. $350 after earning.
Hearing that $AMC is possibly coming out with streaming service to compete with $NFLX
Wow
So they reported an in-line revenue # but blew away subscriber estimates. This makes no sense. If analysts got the revenue # correct how did they under estimate the sub #? One answer: all the excess subs are promotional and non-paying. If they convert to paying then next quarter it is fine.
More room to fall
Parabolic Movement. Remember bitcoin ?Netflix Boeing AMZN NVDA Just to name a few 
"P/S of PTON 750% more expensive than NLS. NLS 22” screen treadmill and new bikes and software are incredible. NLS market cap is 5,000% cheaper than PTON. MONSTER BULL Nautilus. EPS quarter over quarter is mind-blowing. NLS five bagger minimum off $30. Market cap under $800 mil. PTON $45 billion. $NLS $PTON $WW $SNE $MSFT $AMZN $FUBO $NFLX"
Any guess on opening price for tomo?
Looks like nobody wants to hold it. All good things...
"Let's see, should I go to the doctor, be able to buy groceries, put gas in the car, or buy NFLX? Which one do I cut out of the family budget in a recession?"
EASY MONEY!!!!
a stock that missed top and bottom is buy or selllll?
"Wow NFLX over $400 , Time to Buy IQ rocket"
"Up $4.60 already in the premarket, nice upward pressure, we’re gonna see $410+ today."
Excitement is nice just like the horror movies on Netflix 
whoever bought in premarket - raise your hands :) What a rebound? Netflix is not going anywhere
"At Netflix old subscription pricing I did not really care if I watch it or not, but now it is so expensive I have to think if I really need it?"
So the price increase sounds like a response to an earnings miss.
I hope for 550$ soon.Very disappointed from the stock
Next step is to raise the sub fees. Need more free cash flow without relying on debt!!
Will back to 400 soon who with me?...
Every time we clear 370 massive selling comes in. Have to take out the seller and close over 375. I wouldn’t be surprise if we make another run today and/or tomorrow.
Disney vs Netflix for long term hold? Thoughts? 
3 months ago NFLX was trading at $329. What is the big deal if drops to $350

"Never been so confident shorting Netflix, am pretty sure it don’t have big upside and sure it will in 200s sooner or later"
"Monday afternoon buy put option, thank me next day"
There is a definite seasonal trend - in 9 of the past 10 years Netflix has closed higher over the upcoming 35 days with an average gain of 26.9%
Slingshot!!! just bought 300 more baby! $520 EOD
"Netflix is making the same play Apple made. They are increasing their prices to result for lowered subscriber numbers. Look how well that worked for the iPhone and Apple stock.Not to mention they released this info days before their earnings report. Companies do that to give a buffer of good news to mitigate the damage a bad ER will cause, otherwise they'd just give the news during the ER."
CNBC not a mention of NFLX high or 300
"If Netflix eventually reaches 1 billion subscribers, and I don't see anyone impeding them from doing that, then 195 or 325 or 425, they're all very cheap."
lets see on friday its gonna be a rocket
"NFLX is half the market cap of Boeing, welcome to casino street !"
well this isn't good. .26% after GOOG's report? Doubting my trade now. Needs to finish green today or watch out.

"As a top analyst I rate this stock overweight, strong buy, with a bullish outlook. — Goldman Snacks"
"Most of the subscribers are from through third party vendor, like Verizon and Sprint and T-Mobile that bring no money so even very conservative EPS and ER missed.You can mute me but can’t mute truth. "
P/E 258 —- spends $12 Billion in content it doesn’t even own. Big quarterly burn
Netflix will be back to $400 in 30 days.
Hey! I'm holding some stocks that I bought two weeks ago when the price was way better! Are you selling or holding? Or buying new?

Netflix’s Massive 2021 Film Slate Will Deliver New Movies Every Week This Yearhttps://variety.com/2021/film/news/netflix-2021-new-movies-every-week-1234882900/
Why didn’t Netflix wait until earnings call to announce the raise in subscription prices? Is it a warning the sub numbers are low?
$1000 in three months or so:Long base of NFLX price consolidation means huge upside!
Market correction usually last about a full year and it started in July so if you’re invested for 5 years minimum why are you worried?
The stock will be up 100+ on news they will enter sports and advertising.
310 by end of week?
Such irresponsible upgrades they gave on this beloved stock.
"poor Disney, they were better off getting their own channel on Netflix and staying in front of 160M and growing"
No business will go constantly. There will be speed bumps along the way. This is a speed bump.
