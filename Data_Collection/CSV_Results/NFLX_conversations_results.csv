DOGE COIN REALLY TAKING OFF like BUYING NFLX in 2007 Do NOT MISS THIS ROCKET !!

If it could not go positive when market zoomed up for 30 minutes????? expect it under 260 this week
Congratulations. I just pushed up the premarket price by $2/share. You're welcome.
"Remember Blackberry RIMM? At one time it was ""the"" leader of the stock market. NFLX is next RIMM"
"Netflix is the stock version of the crypto craze. Everybody is just buying Netflix due to the name recognition, and because they see it always going up and they have the fear of missing out on the seemingly never ending gains. It worked for Bitcoin...until it didn't. I wonder how long this will keep adding billions to the market cap every day with no fundamentals to back it up?"
we need 50 more dollars!
Nice pickup on dip in premarket. Easy $340 today. Thanks Citigroup.
to the moon we go
410 easy today. and up before earning
I'm out. Pretty much lost it all. you might as well sit on the sideline for now
Netflix is growing in leaps and bounds around the world in new countries like China and Australia ... so many more subscribers yet to come aboard. eh
nflx 438 by end of april.
"FANG have one thing in common, they are the fastest growing large cap companies. That’s why Jim Cramer chose them when he created FANG. Netflix is the fastest growing FANG and its stock has outperformed the others over the years, yet it is the only FANG that hasn’t made a new all time high this year. Look for Netflix to zoom past 423 its all time sooner than later, on its way to 500 this year."
"If you want to buy the dip, here’s your chance. This stock is still a long term winner. Who cares about estimates.....they still ADDED 5Mill + subs and beat on earnings. The stock settles at 340 and slowly makes it way back to 400 in a few weeks."
"This stock will lose an average of two points everyday heading into next earnings. The decline just got ahead of itself. It’s right back on the linear regression line now. Look back at my post from earlier. I said it will got to $230 and then decline again. Guess what? Here we are. May go up a bit more, but just remember am average of two points for each trading day heading into earnings"
any predictions on earnings
fund managers will say anything to manipulate on this board. just stay long look at history before split and multiply ×7. splits make us forget previous movement. longs are fine.
michael jordan exclusive netflix documentary coming. Cool.
Holding a range of $358-$360 for the past hour. Let's see which in direction it breaks out ....
Netflix stock surges above $400 in falling market as three analysts raise price targetshttps://www.marketwatch.com/Story/netflix-is-still-a-top-pick-for-analysts-despite-looming-challenges-2018-06-19?&siteid=yhoof2&yptr=yahoo
will be 270 by end of tomorrow
NFLX may hit $450 next Friday!
Last chance to buy in folks ...it’s going to rain after hours 
$450 is still my price target.
Next upgrade NFLX target could be raised parallel to AMZN at 1460.
If you?re not buying Netflix at these prices then go get a job at McDonalds. I?m so happy to have invested in this #$%$ while watching other stocks on my list reach new heights...
Great volume. Keep this baby going to at least 5% increase at closing.
Looks like another up day. Glad I'm still in the game. Impressive.
gogogogo NFLX want to see 390$ today
Netflix Stock Gets Price-Target Cut As Subscriber Outlook Lowered
Anyone shorting like I have?
anyone else notice highest open interest PUT contracts expiring tomorrow $550 strike
That was an amazing turnaround
"Every time NFLX raised price, the came short on their earnings. This speaks volume about what to see in future. It has stiff competition and competitors are catching up. It is getting hard to get new subscribers so increasing prices. Just like medical insurance companies, limited consumers so keep raising prices to stay in profit...i see more red in coming days and months...now that they raised the price less new consumers will be attracted. Netflix had price benefit over Amazon prime, now that they are kinda of same in pricing,it will be hard to convince new consumers..."
let's b real people! how many more subscribers can this company get!? saturated market
No Bama...!!!! Is what the market is saying.
"So all the cheer leading over the weekend might have created this artificial move higher. And the cheer leading includes the white house. Its really hard to trust at this point. What to do here is the question? I feel like this should be much higher as well , perhaps fund managers are dumping into strength. We will see, meanwhile finger on the trigger to sell. If we are in a bear market then share prices will be brought lower during earnings for many techs, regardless of the numbers. Just my 2 cents."
This is now certified money order a gateway to play with the rich huge money flow on this.
405 by Friday.
getting closer to $199 and still a big bubble stock with huge debt.
I hope the fact that Netflix is huge in Europe will surprise everyone and today’s earnings report. Stay long stay strong!
450 after earnings call
so far in line with goldman....revenue
Too the moon!
WHY IS THE ENTIRE MARKET DROPPING
"Time to load up before the earnings run.Netflix currently has 7 of the top 10 most popular series (including #1, #2, and #3). Complete domination in a rapidly growing industry. Its market cap is way too low.https://www.rottentomatoes.com/browse/tv-list-2"
I will buy at 250
"I think this election today could def affect NFLX. If the lefties get in, watch for strict lockdowns (which will be good for NFLX). I used to laugh at the conspiracies when both sides in the past would scream about election stealing and fraud, but with what I saw the DNC do in the primaries in 2016, and from what came out in my own state a few short years ago (and there were prosecutions) I don't laugh anymore. The DEMS really could steal this thing...."
Don't worry peepsbig gains great shows no movie theater sDon't listen to haters. Booooooo Ya
"Within the next week or so, Reed Hastings will be selling another $25 million of Netflix stock. And possibly at least $300-$400 million of stock sales for the year. He is a multi-billionaire who has not generated any cash profit whatsoever."
"Bought AH yesterday, and rewarded today as I expected."
"NFLX tries to maintain the current price level if it can to the end of June, but the market down trend can pull it down. Bankers will sell 3 days to 1 weeks prior next earning (7/16/18). The selling will drive down price so they can buy low. The retail investors should take profit now before bankers selling. NFLX was around $295 prior the last earning because of heavy selling from bankers couple day before the last earning."
"Suntrupgrades Netflix, buy on the dip because of India opportunity"
Remember those stone age days when you ordered Netflix DVDs over the mail. And you could only order so many at once I believe it was like 2 or 3 before Redbox. Well I still have one of those DVD's I never returned. I'm getting it framed this weekend. That's how long I've been in this baby.
"After Thursday, on a positive earnings report that meets or exceeds expectations, expect $400.00+"
They up the price because they have to do something. Otherwise they’d look bad for being so far from the price and short term trend.
Susan Rice now with Netflix. How could that possibly be positive for them?
I think the stock is about to really tank. Netflix took on Susan Rice to their board.
I sold my remaining shares around $520. My take is we all know Netflix is doing great and will likely post a great quarter. The problem is their outlook will be compared against 2020. While I think 2021 will be a strong year for nflx I think people will focus on comparisons to 2020 sub adds. I’m guessing it probably sells off on earnings. If it does so I will look to get back In.
It’s Looking to make 370.00 today. Today she will rise.
"If we open over 275, good chance we hit 280. Hope we can hold the lead..Good luck to everyone!"
market major correction on trade wars and White House turmoil no stock is safe especially Netflix the ultimate momentum stock
Netflix has 42 of the top 100 shows (TV series and movies). When they get past 75 of the top 100 shows they will start raising prices by 20% every year.
The only thing that matters is that netflix is crushing the competition and gaining market share.
Impeccable timing. https://youtu.be/RPU_u3TWvbk
"I think Apple parked all that cash , buy Netflix "
And just bought 10 more $520 call options for tomorrow dirt cheap! bam!
"Anybody knows of a site where we can read and post serious messages on stocks? Most people on the yahoo boards sound like 15 years old. I am looking where we can exchange with people interested in sharing ideas, news, data.... Not sure a site like this even exists....."
Could Netflix split again??
"As long as we close in green, I'll be gracious"
Go ahead and sell.. it’s just gonna rise.. this is AH.
Just incredible...not expected at all by the market. Amazing figures....I was expecting something good but not that good!

I just bought hundred shares at closing YES 
Streaming services are losing a lot of money. Licensing to Netflix pays more than streaming. We have seen a shift from cable TV to streaming and now we will see a shift from content producers streaming their own content to content producers licensing their content to Netflix.
I will start a short position soon..
"I can't care less if you are a long or short. But if you use terms like ""We warned you OVER AND OVER"", and especially if you forgot how to turn of the caps-lock. I can't really take you seriously, go bother some other board."
Hey Maguire get writing a new book .I finished your last book at 3pm today.
i am hoping Monday is good day for NFLx . but need to wait until 12.05pm . you will see big change at 12.50pm. and stock will hit atleast $ 433
I think this is a great time to buy
Time to buy...WSTIstrong buy now
why do big companies announce earnings after hours?
just added to position ;
"NFLX puts the ""P"" in parabolic. This stock has not taken a breath since $185. I think it is funds who are buying to fill out positions. They know the stock will drop but are long term. This has got to be a short here."
Head & Shoulders pattern just formed in the three months chart.
Small Fortunes are being made on this stock today (by being Long).
every one who bought last and this week will sell after earnings.. 400 then sell to 300 again
I called it 360 but went higher. The banks are really opening there wallets. Big blocks buys. Tomorrow another beautiful day. 380.00 easy
"OMG, The sky is falling!!!"
"Netflixx to buy Viacom/CBS Netflix Should Buy ViacomCBS | About: ViacomCBS Inc. (VIAC), VIACA, NFLX, VIA, VIAB, Includes: AAPL, AMZN, BRK.A, BRK.B, DIS, FB, GOOG, GOOGL, TJune 2. 2020Paul Franke Paul FrankeContrarian, long/short equity, momentum, Deep Value(6,000 followers)SummaryThe Netflix business model is under competitive attack and risks becoming the next America Online boom/bust example of a changing technology landscape.Without free cash flow and a much larger library of media content, Netflix cannot win the coming streaming wars.Only a bold and masterful move by management to acquire a company like ViacomCBS will keep the Netflix stock quote around present levels.The Viacom-CBS business combination is almost complete and could be a long-term buy regardless of any Netflix moves.Netflix (NFLX) is in big trouble without a grand stroke of genius by management in coming months. I propose the company fix its two biggest competitive problems - the lack of both owned content and free cash generation - before it’s too late. Netflix’s middleman streaming business model between customers and media content assets will not cut it anymore. By acquiring the new ViacomCBS combined media enterprise as soon as possible, Netflix can turn lemons into lemonade. Purchasing a huge library of entertainment assets to broadcast over the internet, while immediately adding $3-5 billion in cash flow and earnings generation each year, would put the embattled Netflix stock quote back on track.Management at Netflix is rapidly coming to realize a stand-pat operating model of paying billions annually to create/rent streaming content, while its high subscription selling price per month is coming under attack by new competition, is a lose-lose proposition going into 2020. The only way forward is to make a bold move, specifically a transformative merger with an important media content owner.Sumner Redstone and his National Amusement entity hold about 79% voting control of the soon-to-be-merged CBS Corporation (CBS, CBS.A) and Viacom Inc. (VIAB, VIA). I think an all-stock Netflix deal to buy out ViacomCBS in late 2019 or early 2020 would be an ideal ending statement for his long career in entertainment ownership and production. Who wouldn’t want to become one of the largest shareholders in a reinvigorated, high-growth return Netflix? After subpar investment gains from his companies for several decades versus the media industry, a sellout to Netflix may prove to be his grandest and smartest achievement. Sometimes, the simplest answer is the best answer. Netflix’s board and management only have to negotiate with the Redstone family to work out a price.Below are graphs of some of the television/film content ViacomCBS owns.Source: CBS and Viacom Investor SlideshowDuring 2016, I outlined the argument on Seeking Alpha for Disney (DIS) to acquire Netflix when its quote was around $120 a share. The merger would have allowed Disney to quickly enter and basically control the world of streaming video/entertainment content all over the world. Apparently, Disney’s CEO, Bob Iger, did not like the steep entry fee back then, around $50 billion to buy out the premier global streaming company. Of course, feeling left behind a few years later, Mr. Iger decided to purchase $70 billion in Fox content assets, and will likely spend tens of billions more building out Disney’s streaming service about to begin in November.Now the big boys are all coming to play in Netflix’s backyard. Everyone is entering the streaming business and spending billions to become even bigger players. Disney+, Google’s Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and YouTube, Apple (AAPL) TV, Amazon (AMZN) Prime, Facebook (FB) and AT&T (T) Time Warner have all announced media content investments or new spending sprees in the tens of billions to roll out greater streaming options for consumers globally. The competitive environment for Netflix could easily turn it into the America Online situation of the 1990s tech bubble peak. Basically, AOL grew at an astounding clip to become the largest and only truly functioning Microsoft Windows (MSFT)-compatible online access company for U.S. consumers between 1993 and 1999. Then, competition and a changing Internet access landscape showed up and ran AOL into the ground. Could Netflix suffer the same fate? I have openly wondered about Netflix’s business fortunes past 2019, and have been short the stock off and on this year.Netflix is Expensive, ViacomCBS is CheapThe argument for an all-stock deal, where Netflix just mints new shares to hand out to Sumner (and a few others) for ownership of ViacomCBS, is compelling right now. CBS and Viacom are late to the game in streaming, planning to spend future cash flow and earnings to catch up. Why not join forces with the world’s largest streaming service, filling your business model void overnight, while helping Netflix to plug its major gaps? Talk about a win-w"
"Oh boy, margin calls kick in on Monday."

Movement this morning is identical to how it was in the first 3 minutes of trading yesterday. We all know how that ended by the end of the day. Don't get too excited.
lucky I not sell it thus morning
"*Warning to shareholders* There is a huge boycott campaign starting against Netflix, thousands have already cancelled today, check evidence on Twitter, FacebookLong term prospects are not good, the subscription base is cratering and this company is burning cash.You've been warned"
#FB #AMZN #BABA #NFLX.. Enough said!! Long and solid!  Tomorrow will be a great day!
Very good news. Netflix is hiring Colin Kaepernick .He will be paid 25 mln and will be a member of the board with Susan Rice..I am buying in the morning
"I applaud those who bought calls and/or stock ahead of earnings. I played it somewhat safe and deployed a $525/$540 call spread. So my upside is capped at $540. Still, it was minimal risk for what will be a nice return tomorrow."
"was there for the break through 100, then 200, then 300, now 337 will stay there as it breaks through 500 and beyond."
"$375,00 $385.00 Good Luck Netflix FAMILY!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Tomorrow easy $40.00 pop. This going to run so fast up that the banks aren’t going to have time to get in at a low price. Buy early I LOVE NETFLIX
kiss green
Could see 375 before earnings... buy buy buy run it up...
wow...today's gain alone almost equals all of 2017 revenues. Complete insanity---
breaking: J.P. Morgan reiterates Overweight and price target of $535 on Netflix amid stable trendshttps://seekingalpha.com/news/3582065-j-p-morgan-reiterates-overweight-on-netflix-amid-stable-trends?utm_medium=email&utm_source=seeking_alpha&mail_subject=nflx-j-p-morgan-reiterates-overweight-on-netflix-amid-stable-trends&utm_campaign=rta-stock-news&utm_content=link-3
"What can happen to stock in weeks, look at $TSLA. It traded 365 on Monday and now 300. Only difference between Tesla and Netflix is, it pumped by CEO v/s Analyst. 5000/month which consider impossible 3 month Ago, Elon make it happen (Even while temporary) yet stock gone down 20% with sell on News.If anyone think this stock can't go 350, They will soon learn very expensive lessons."
wild.to is the next netflix. buy now while its still penny
Who anas hurts?
Classic pump of an overpriced stock! Who knows when it will stop.
"I say again: NFLX is the only game in town right now/ TSLA needs pause; BYND for next week ER, so AMZN/GOOGL/AAPL/....Target $650 if this bull market keeps chugging up!"
400 next month.
I think I might drink a 40 of vodka before the market opens tomorrow. Things usually don’t hurt as bad when you’re hammered.
"NBC Universal, which owns the rights to The Office, is pulling the popular sitcom from Netflix in favor of its own SVOD service, Peacock, due to launch next year. AT&T (T) - Get Report WarnerMedia-owned Friends is also leaving Netflix soon, and will instead run on HBO Max. Both programs will disappear from Netflix at the end of next year."
I bet those shorted amzn is shorting Netflix now . .
"If you compare $NFLX and $AMZN against $GOOGL, $NVDA, $FB then you will realize how smart move this is.$GOOGL, $NVDA and $FB all about same growth rate. Only thing different is those generate lot of profit v/s $AMZN and $NFLX actually have negative cash flow. $FB and $GOOGL actually trading discounted Forward PE just 2 year out than S&P 500 overall.So why NFLX keep going all time high vs other not.two reason.1.> NFLX and AMZN ceo/management active pumping stock price. Other are not. Something that fan club love.2.> Big player know it's way inflated. They love it. They pushing trend follower to these two and other such stocks. While reduce them from quality companies. They are very successful I think.So what might happen next.We don't know when this happen, it all depend on how strong retail interest remain and how much further Margin /debt used by retail investors, What is limit before big player exit long position and what is limit when they dump everything & go actually short. But my prediction this will happen. AMZN and GOOGL right now have $425 difference. I think in year or so this likely <$200, Could be negative.Same with NFLX, it likely trade lower than $NVDA (Also might $FB) in year out. If you can handle temporary paper loss.I recomend go long on $GOOGL & $FB, $NVDAGo short on $AMZN and $NFLX. I think you will not regret strategy year out. You likely profit limited to 10%-15% but again risk is limited."
"What a great stock, Netflix payed my mortgage for a few years now. Keep it going Netflix!"
What I can say is: WOW
Nice and green today!
Shorts mist be ecstatic as they get to short at higher and higher prices!
NFLX will reach $ 275 by this Friday! Do not miss this buying opportunity.
"Of any option out here, I feel more comfortable shorting nflx. Even Cramer said it was overbought. Brake downs past few days signal something real bad is gonna happen soon. In fact the pump news cycle confirms this. They are desperate to get some room to get out above 260"
"400 soon !! All shorties, thanks for your purchase to push share price much higher."
Tomorrow it’s looking really good. I’m telling you all it’s going to get better from here on out. There is no reason to be back 400.00 plus by the end of the month. I love Netflix and loves me back
Why this stock is going down? With strong subscriber growth? Yes Disney is coming with the streaming however it shouldn’t affect that much. Netflix is time to rise!!
"if stays above 364, then there will be hope for coming back."
GREAT year ... NFLX up 67.11 %....
"Sell Netflix, Buy Viacom CBS!!"
NFLX buying AMC..? Interesting news especially with shorts stretched at over 60% short on AMC..((((((((( BOOM )))))))))

295 today?
"Disney planning big, will be in every country. Baba going big too, will be international"
$400 by mid day tomorrow
nobody disputes the fact that Netflix is a great company with great service globally. The problem is that it needs to be trading at a reasonable value of 25 to 30 times eaenings which is about $100 per share. Apple is a great global company and it trades at a PE of 19. That's all..
 bears
I’m wondering if I should sell some of my $NFLX shares and buy more IQ. Thoughts?
it'll get US$400 before friday! :D
Get in now why red... this will be green eod and fly 5% by eod tomorrow
Why is she down
remember the short sellers and haters at 325. Lol it went back up to 386. I see a recovery before earnings next week and if they meet earnings and subscriber numbers it will hit new highs
With shortage of vaccines-netflix will continue to climb world wide.
7 min to open.... Let the game start.
BUY NOW! Thank me next week.
"Furthermore, Loop Capital analyst Rob Sanderson pointed out that Netflix could be close to free cash-flow positive this year due to the massive industry-wide production halts due to the COVID-19 outbreak.“Given the industry production shutdown, we estimate NFLX will spend $2.5B less this year, and be close to free cash flow positive. With the largest library and the entire industry shut down, we think NFLX will spend less while expanding its competitive edge,” Sanderson said in a note April 17."
can we make 360 next hour?
"Extremely high PE...bubble waiting to pop. Mounting competition with better access to capital. $NFLX will be priced out of the market by competitors. I bought long $290 puts, free money."
"Could you please tell me where are the shorts? Oh wait they are hiding. Well, let them stay in their caves lol"
Open price tomorrow?$335+
This is a repeat of year 2000 dot com bubble
"Netflix will have a blowout earnings report, should be around 440 after that."
Well what did ppl expect?! It was trading above avg target already...
Good job NFLX. Worst market fall and you closed green. Hope markets recover tomorrow. 285 easy this week.
500 steady in few weeks
I wonder if this could recover to 370 today
nothing like a buying discount
"Once millenials start to learn how to use a COMPUTER, not an iphone, they will learn that ALL of this content can be downloaded for FREE Lol"

I heard NFLX is gonna introduce infant twerking......Biden loves this stuff
Big reversal pre market...from up 3 to down 1. Yikes
300 was actually a bullish call. Everyone and his mother knows this thing is going down much farther than 300.
Does EPS mean anything these days?
This countries in TROUBLE?????????????
back to $450 folks
IQ the better deal.Like Netflix from 5 years ago.
Last chance to get on the train!
Just stopped in to point and laugh at the numerous shorts that claimed it was dropping to $250
easy money just bought 530 shares. earnings will be great and up. Ty for the discount.
just finished watching season 2 of Ozark. Great series. if NFLX continues to make content like this no reason why the stock can't rise to 400.
NFLX going higher and buying AMRN rocket Upside
BUY BUY BUY BUY
Closing 375!!
needs a BIG week next week
"Reality is there’s only a handful of super market caps growth stocks that the biggest institutional investors can buy. NFLX has crossed that threshold at 200bn mkt cap - after a pause, it will move to 300bn cap (particularly with CV lurking around) simply bc there’s no competitor in this space except AMZN which everyone owns. Trade on mkt cap not on daily price."
I like Roku very much but seems like buying it @ $95 is like buying $NFLX @ $420... I'll just sit on the sidelines and wait.
"From seeking alpha: ""all this cr*p about the prior product from a start-up, not the commercialized product - the outcome of that spending - $EOSE currently has.Did you know that the initial products from many start-ups aren't perfect? I mean, $nflx used to MAIL DVDs. Crazy, right?This short report is laughable . And this ice berg #$%$ firm will get sued to pieces."""
"Earnings run coming this week, might hit 440!"
"Lovely discount - panic sell, back up tomorrow :) thanks guys"
Going to 50 - 70
Wonder what Baldy Jim Cramer will have to say about his least favorite FANG stock tonight!
Trading used to be such a frustrating experience for me. The losses mounted up until I discovered the winning service over at (http://Thetraderguide.com) check them out today.
Shotr NFLX now.
Dow future up 400 + today no one can stop Netflix to fly $600 + Dow close today 1500 + point just wait
I believe the stock will pop up nice after the report to (let some people out) and then sell off. It looks like it is set up for that.
$AMZN $AMC $NFLX 
a stock that missed top and bottom is buy or selllll?
A new hit series or lack of one is the difference between beating or missing subscriber guidance. The Witcher should provide Netflix with a big beat this Tuesday.

NFLX: show us green today...we deserve it.
"37 million new subscribers to end the year. Shares up by 48% over the past 12 months, that led to its revenue rising to $25 billion. The No. 1 streaming service company definitely not slowing down.And because of the pandemic, we saw a big shift to streaming, making an opportunity for growth and a more healthy and intensified competition between other streaming giants. https://zyne.com/stock/NFLX"
"Netflix Has 'Insurmountable' Lead: Credit Suisse UBS just downgraded the Netflix Still, he raised his price target for Netflix to $425 a share. Its international revenues have increased at a CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 14.2% in the last five quarters. The company’s domestic CAGR in the same period stood at 5.5%, which indicates that the company’s international growth is outpacing its domestic revenue growth. Netflix’s Domestic Revenue Segment: Double-Digit Growth"
290 by Friday.
just thinking about - what if they had beat on subscriber count? It would have been over 450 today. Cord-cutting is real..Netflix will be the big player no matter what
thank you short.
"Assuming Netflix makes a whopping $10 per share in earnings when it reaches its growth plateau in 5 years and at that time trades at a PE which is close to that of Apple's PE which is at 19. Then it will be only worth $190 per share. So, I ask myself, do I buy a stock at $330 today when it will be worth $190 in 5 years, or do I short it at $330 and buy it back at $190?? Invest wisely, not emotionally..."
lets see on friday its gonna be a rocket
Might end green today lol !!!
I can't imagine anyone buying this stock at this price.

Daytraders: placing a trailing stop on this stock what is the magic number in order to protect your gains ? Just bought 300 shares but I think it is high and it may retrace. Market is very volatile

You put Obama on Netflix and I’ll cancel my subscription and never watch Netflix again.

"MSFT much safer, little competition, next high flyer, the cloud will increase this business and stock over 50%. Little or no downside. FB still getting high growth. GOOG and AAPL also safe . Tesla, I would not touch."
This could be the next $NFLX
Two more PT upgrades today. Total of 6 since yesterday
The road to $400 begins with one green day.
Nice- sold right into the close.
Below 525 by Friday
"I do not post often, first of all. anyone posting Netflix is not a buy, has obviously shorted the stock. Netflix is a Buy, unless you woke up and thought the sky is falling."
Would be very nice if Netflix continues this momentum today. If it continues to outpace the market it will hit green quicker
"DIS is a strong and powerful company, but NFLX also.....NFLX could easily cut from 5 to 2 users for a single subscription......And push new subscribers to 300 millions....."
So is subscribers really going to be this good to justify 120x earnings?
$NFLX is up big right here.. what I am doing is taking profits... i am diversifying my funds into more lucrative small cap opportunities.... my #1 trade idea right now is.... https://www.tradingview.com/chart/ANFI/sKmH2SoX-ANFI-is-back-in-the-buy-zone-How-high-will-this-low-float-go/
"The reason NFLX is worth much less (circa 40) is that Video is FREE .. think all the amazing free stuff on Youtube including university lectures!!!!. From X to Triple XXX, Sports, Movies on Prime (for those who want free PRIME shipping"", ETC. Netflix worth no more than $20 to $40. Even GE is a million times a better investment than NFLX."
"Are DLPN, CIDM and NETFLIX all related?? I heard DLPN is working with NETFLIX and CIDM might partner with DLPN??"
"Too much politics in their content. My entire family got off of it, so have my friends and I’m up next this weekend once my pc is set up"
Bridgerton is top of the top....Should bring some subscriber with Queen's Gambit big hit.....Strong buy
Don't chase this. It's over until it drops. Better pricing in 5 days.
What’s your opinion on next week price? Up or down?
"Well I usually don't return for a victory lap, but I'll make an exception here. The analysts were falling all over themselves with upgrades and gushing over the price increase, and everything was baked into the stock. Except the earnings are mixed, meaning not good enough."
"Anyone here remember when NFLX was twice Disney, now look  Disney is twice NFLX. See what happens when you have a CEO who is a far left LIBTARD"
What will happen to the shorts tomorrow?
"Disney For Investors, Netflix For Speculators https://seekingalpha.com/article/4272985?source=ansh $DIS, $NFLX"
Anybody holding lithium here (LAC)?
I think NFLX is going to blow away both estimates and future guidance. It will be phenomenal. Jmho. Glta longs.
"SAG award TV nominations:NETFLIX – 15 PRIME VIDEO – 8 HBO – 6 (including a stunt ensemble nomination)FX NETWORKS – 4AMC – 3 (including a stunt ensemble nomination)HULU – 3NBC – 2BBC AMERICA – 1NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC – 1SHOWTIME – 1USA NETWORK – 1Nearly 2 times the next highest, Amazon. 2.5 times HBO5 times hulu15 times showtimeNetflix has been aggressively signing up talent, writers directors, studios for multi year deals. They give the talent the freedom to do their best work. Not to mention the experience and data they have on viewing habits and markets around the globe.See you at 1000 / share."
Now green. I told you right? Rising oil price will shift money from retail sector to tech sector and others. Easy money. Tomorrow NFLX will be up 4%
"Think of google+ trying to topple Facebook, orkut vs Facebook. Bing vs google. Just because a strong competitor is stepping into the streaming space doesn’t mean bad news for the top players. Netflix will keep growing and eventually get far too high than any other streaming service."
"Netflix purchased the entire billboard advertising agency, not just advertising space:Netflix, already a heavy advertiser on billboards in the area, was offering $300 million in April to acquire Los Angeles-based Regency Outdoor Advertising, Reuters previously reported."
Netflix now has a higher market cap then Disney!
"Another nice little after hours bump. This is good a good upward trend leading into tomorrow.For all those who bought yesterday, good news:Best Day of the Week to Buy Stock: MondayIt's called the Monday Effect. For decades, the stock market has had a tendency to drop on Mondays, on average. Some studies, as in ""A Survey of the Monday Effect Literature"" by Glenn N. Pettengill in the Quarterly Journal of Business and Economics (2003), have attributed this to a large amount of bad news that is often released over the weekend. Others point to investors' gloomy mood at having to go back to work, which is especially evident during the early hours of Monday trading. July is traditional one of the best months of the year for S&P returns..... so with the momentum moving forward and earnings looking solid, I think all us longs are in for a real treat the next few weeks."
"I think AMZN should buy NFLX, 0.20 shares of AMZN for 1 NFLX. $625 sounds good to me."
NBC just announced streaming initiative. Space getting more crowded.
Open 302$ and close above 310$
Looking forward to the Earning Release tomorrow. Have a good feeling about this one!
Would be nice to see hedge funds reallocating from apple to NFLX a few billion can go long way for netflix.
"Nflx will someday make money, why worry"
I love Netflix come on bashers admit it you love Netflix too
Fast Money don’t like NFLX up here!Rather Buy BABA!
Going all the way up
"Here's another one for Tim's comment earlier:@tim said:$FB $AAPL $AMZN $NFLX $GOOG $GOOGLTalk about inflation? FAANG along with the rest of the stock market is inflated. If I wanted to get involved in FAANG as of today's closing prices, it would cost me $4k total to buy just 1 share in each company. Here's my acronym. GEB=Grossly Extended Bubble$FB-$177.46$AAPL-$217.94$AMZN-$1927.68$NFLX-$364.58$GOOGL-$1256.27Here's my take:Tim, you probably thought that on Jan 2, 2018 as well. Let's do the IRA contribution again, but with just FANG stocks. (This example could also be a college fund).$6500 to spend on FANG stocks on Jan. 2, 2018AMZN $1209.59 x 1 share = $1209.59 (18.6% of investment)GOOGL $1095.76 x 1 share = $1095.76 (16.7% of investment)FB $184.33 x 7 shares = $1290.31 (19.8% of investment)NFLX $205.63 x 7 shares = $1439.41 (22.1%) = $1464.93 leftAAPL 173.03 x 8.46 shares = $1463.83 (22.5% of investment), this is an AAPL board, right?So you spent $6500 and ended up with 5 companies and a total of 24.46 shares. Here's where you are as of close 8/27/18, using your numbers verbatim copied:$FB-$177.46 x 7 shares = $1242.22, -3.7%$AAPL-$217.94 x 8.46 shares = $1843.77, +26.0%$AMZN-$1927.68 x 1 share = $1927.68, +59.4%$NFLX-$364.58 x 7 shares = $2552.06, +77.3%$GOOGL-$1256.27 x 1 share = $1256.27, +14.6%Overall, for your $6500 investment, your total is now $8820.00, increase of $2320, and gain of 35.7%. Not bad for owning ""only"" 24.46 shares of good, quality stocks that are leaders in their fields."

"as warren buffet says, buy when the opportunity arises to buy a good stock on sale."
phenomenal growth.
did you know before the July 2015 split netflix lost 140 points a few months before. made a fast recovery though. 25 points x7 before spit is 140. no one really analyzes charts they just panic sell. longs are good!
384 WALL
Need to close above 380 by Friday.
Run Forrest run. Shorties better run for cover cause 600 here we come.
IBased on today and yesterday price action I can easily can see a 20% shave after q2
SO MANY SHORTS
just I cover 100 more now 1500 short.
UP 5 IN AFTER HOURS !! WILL OPEN UP 10 TOMORROW AND CLOSE UP 25 AT 349.75 !!!
275 close today
Look at subscriber growth rate of 26% and accelerating. They just raise prices 16% but analysts are only estimating 26% revenue growth this year! There's another flood of analyst upgrades coming. It happens every year and I think this year will be one of the best years ever for the stock because the stock was robed of having one of it's best years last year with the tech stock bear market.
going up of course
no one stopping this now
God please help the longs
$418 by tomorrow??
"How anyone would give even the smallest amount of credence to anything Citron says, is way beyond me. Some of the outrageous calls they have made in the past, speak for themselves. In my opinion...they are not an investment factor."
Why down? Earnings leaks? Anyone?
"Great short term, but long term is difficult with original content when DIS and Warner leaves Netflix to start their own Netflix. "
Great price!
"Taking a poll. Tomorrow when I wake up I will do one of two things. Thumbs up if I should go in the backyard and set a pile of cash on fire, thumbs down if I should log into my computer and buy NFLX?"
RBC Capital raised PT to $440 today. i wonder how it will react
news of the year announcement Apple buying Netflix WOW
it will possibly be green by tomorrow lol
Bought 400sh in 2009. NFLX is putting my son through school. Little to complain about with this company.
Wfh stocks will rally this coming quarter. This is where you want to be! This things a beast even when corona is not a thing
"Over 5 million subscribers added....the world is not ending for Netflix. Next best company with content, subscriber count, and streaming contracts is 10 years behind. Sell now and regret it later....long and strong."
"This year's Singapore Marathon will be run in virtual and AR mode. This year's Singapore Marathon will be run in virtual and AR mode. The AR track starts at Orchard Road and passes attractions such as Chinatown, the National Gallery and Marina Bay. To participate in the AR race, simply download the program and follow the instructions to connect to your treadmill at home, go to the ActiveSG gym specified in 12, or sign up for the live AR run at Marina Bay Gardens on December 5 and 6."
Buy more
"Bubble os busting. With the financial condition is tightening, companies that rely on debt like Netflix wi have difficulty to raise cash. If they increase subscription fee, then reduce the user growth. It's a difficult time ahead."
230 this week
Did Netflix had good earnings 2 weeks ago?
"We used to get way more newer movies. Now days the movie list is so outdated, even though they increased the price couple of dollars. I love horror movies for example and I’ve been seeing same movie list for weeks. All they need to provide a updated list. They are not diversified so good lock for longs.I want even pay $100 for NFLX."
"The stock sold off all day today on profit taking, setting up for a great run in the holiday season when it reports explosive subscriber growth. JMHO"
And then 390 coming
my loss is now $28K so sure getting into uncomfortable level but some reason I am not feeling concern. Not good thing because I keep thinking to short more and use my buying power which now lowest of last 2 month. Need to keep writing - follow principle to control my mind.
An exec said the N word
OmG!!! Its down 1.5% how is this possible?
By order of the PEaky Blinders!!
Hope you guys are doing well! God bless Americans
Will go lower
"Tommorow NFLX will break through the old high of 421 and march higher due to shorts covering, really excited considering I have over 450 shares"
As long as this stock is over $200 is still not too late to short this balloon. The P/E on NFLX is over 112 even after todays sell off. This stock will be less than $150 within a few months.....
"A historic day! The high of 26.60 was the highest on a non-earnings day and the 4th highest ever. The close of 26.37 was the 2nd highest ever on a non-earnings day. April 17 of last year it was closed 28.28 in the green.Good way to end the Friday slump.7 day unbeaten streak. +63.69 during it. On Dec. 26, it reached a low of 231.23 and has bee running since then.Highest point since 298.72 on Dec. 3, Best close since 303.47 on Nov. 9The 10.68 open was the 10th best ever and highest since Oct. 31Dec. 26 it closed +19.79. Next day it, closed up 1.90, but it got down 13.57 before it started the comeback.Good luck to everyone next week!"
if we get to 650 then 700 is around corner and they should split 7-1. I don't believe this has ever split correct?
Bought 450 more shares in the morning and appreciating the returns. Stay long!
Netflix beat the last 3 earnings. I hope next one will also beat.
"Just curious, with Netflix being so heavy with debt, what is the hit to earnings if interest rates start going up (they are already going up)? Not trying to be a shortie here, wondering if anyone has done the math."
Is this worth a buy before earnings report tomorrow?
Nothing happening before next ER
looks like it's going to 390
"Sorry shorts, NFLX is not going to slow down, in fact it's only going up from here. After hours up to 420, tommorow at closing will be rallying past 430, cover now or wait until your brokerage calls"
NFLX could close green...
"Looks like we won't see 350 today, but it's highly probable next Monday or Tuesday. JMHO"
https://youtu.be/EWkDZ51yrUg
the party is about to begin!
Fundamentals don’t matter......Until you offer 1.5 billion in Junk bonds.
If you compare to mcaps of other big stocks and earnings ratio no reason this cannot be 400b. Will just go up almost continuously like Tesla. Everyone starting to question the value of everything nowadays
"I really can't understand why this stock is falling. It has a large, expanding customer base. It is also consistently profitable and has surpassed the analyst's expectations on a quarterly basis. I am beginning to think I should just stay out of the market as there are forces going on here that I simply do not understand. My $100K investment here is now worth about $77K... Nice! I guess I can't roll with the big boys"
This is the best place for stock market news. Everyone is always correct about everything.
Can you say... DOT COM
"Most meaningless, unnecessary drop ever. The only FAANG which has no problems with it’s audience. Rock solid company, great technology, perfect numbers. 0 concerns and this is tumbles. WHY????"
Netflix and chill slogan really pushed this stock to mars. I'm loving it :)
I would like to see $375 today
"All exuberance aside... we need to consider that NFLX - - added lesser subscribers in US- added lesser foreign subscribers- had smaller revenue than forecast, - piled up $1.5 billion more loan, - gave weaker guidance for next Q, - is facing more competition everyday - Yields on their bonds rose 17.4 basis points I was bullish too in the past but which investor (not Trader) would feel safe buying at this point ??"
"I have mixed emotion in this stock, although it’s a household name but more and more competitors are coming. Their content are not as interesting anymore (personal opinion only) confused wether to buy calls or puts"
"I am no longer going to watch CNBC, especially when there is market turmoil . They always make it worse."
Shorts better cover-this thing is about to fly
Analysts will need to bump earnings estimates up for this year and next year. Open the gates and let the momentum investors in.
"earnings:$3.29 blns vs. cons. $3.28 bln...more importantly, net streaming adds @ 8.33 mln vs. est. 6.35 mln...a massive subscriber growth"
"shorts told me to sell at 95, 99, 120, 130, 140, 160, 170, 200, 220, 240, 250, 300 and 350increased position for the first time at 378. better late than never."
550 by Jan 19
"hey shorties, feel that squeeeeezze"
start of a small rally. $325 by end of next week
Some of the most bullish analysts yet to weigh in including Goldman.
http://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/netflix-stock-price-earnings-analyst-preview-2018-7-1027370368
What is your realistic EOD thoughts?
can someone please tell me where the future growth will be coming from. is this an international play? Why would anyone own Netflix over other high growth tech companies? Netflix seems to have much more competition than others and they don't make money.
People Netflix by far is the best
"Amzn all time high , Netflix should follow suit . Come on 405 pm"
We are on a technical breakout
What's is going on???!! Is this a FB affect?
I'm in for 5 years
Need new compelling original content that simple
400.00 stock by Halloween
CECE should be a good paris agreement stock
"Apple and Google and Disney and .... are spending and will spend billions to create streaming video.Do you suppose that will affect Netflix's bottome line?The forward PE is probably pie in the sky.PE more than likely to go up significantly, which will cause the stock price to dive."
You can keep your Plan..
"I forgot earnings is the 16th, it's the 12th alreadyI probably would have bought some at the bottom for a bouncewait til after earnings and then trade it. could go either way. I'm leaning toward a sell off, but they could have some really good news"
300-400 gap will fill real quick.
"""Netflix on track to double revenues by 2021 and triple by 2023."" Ok so let's assume thats true, let's triple the EPS. We'll make it a clean $9 per share. That puts PE at 34 at this share price in an optimistic scenario by 2023? What am I missing?"
Investors may be pleasantly surprised with earnings - new subscription pricing is included in this reporting quarter - which is approximately 10% higher subscription pricing
"We've got back $84 from Dec 26.....another $80 and, we're back at $400.00 per share"
Check out (http://Pick-stocks.com). They just mentioned NFLX in the daily newsletter.
"Goldman, need emergency upgrade. Cramer start pumping the stock harder."
NFLX will open higher regardless of where it trades tonight.
I know nothing but these numbers aren’t bad. They had to spend money to get international and produce original content. They added 8.84 subscribers beat expectations on that and EPS. That’s a growing business. Am I wrong?
This may be good time to buy NFLX. I added
"Discussion: NFLX $500 at end of 2018?What does Mr. Cramerica thinks?AAPL, AMZN , Disney - Wake-Up, Take-Over - BuyImagine all that World Subscribers, These are Leads (Contacts), $$$$$$$NFLX should start using Advertisements, $$$$$$Include Gaming's, $$$$$$Gambling, $$$$$$Shopping, $$$$$$Lots of ways to MonetizeIts Infinity"
It's getting to expensive to buy for small investors. A 1-5 stocksplit would be welcome and boost the stock.
"short have been accumulating in names like fb,nfln,twtr,snap and others for the past 6 weeks. one problem for influx shorts is that the price momentum stalled and it isn't dropping. pain is to the upside and its not about mkt cap its about where traders can separate the most amount of money from investors. nflx is going to trade back to $380-390 in the next 6 weeks and come earnings they could pull a tsla and be back over $400."
"If NFLX chart looked like TSLA chart, 360 is top Bollinger Band and should be easily touched!"
345 Target for today/this week
Everybody knows Netflix numbers will be much better then expected this time because of the great shows that came out in November and December. All those that signed up then are paying now. Next to that the price increase.
Sell ASAP at open $355 or less
"this will easily go to 500 and possibly 1000Netflix is the future guys, profits and such mean nothing when there is no competition. Once they control the market they can raise sub fees to $50-$100 and people will pay it because they don't know anything else"
"This stock will climb to $350 tomorrow. They have a lot of pumpers. If trump says anything good about the talks, it’s heading to $360 this week then"
"Nflx added more subscribers + raised the price, but the earning per share did not meet expectations. is that make sense? Not for me."
i just cannot stop smiling and laighing  hit loke if u feeling the same 60 share at 500
So to recap the general sentiment on every board on yahoo...if a stock moves in the direction you want “yeah! I was right! I’m a genius!” If it moves against you “market manipulation!!!!!!” What a sad mindset has befallen this nation.
"With tariffs now in place on most other goods, a Netflix subscription looks relatively cheap, maybe the company should consider raising subscription fees next year. JMHO"
Disney in talks to buy Netflix
So T mobile one data plan offer free Netflix now. Guess how many new subscribers will be there. And btw. The hunting of hill house is really good. There are so many good original shows . They will dominate the market. So for long investor I am still in
320 is the bottom. Only goes up from now. 30.000 extra paying members per day. 3 million extra income per day!
"can't be going up all the time.a 30% correction is in order, and overdue.for NFLX, a 50% drop would still be too small in view of the unreasonably high p/e ratio."
Panickers feeling mighty atupid...scared money don't make no.money. z
Cant even hold positive earnings. It’s way too hyped and overpriced
Time to break this one up too. Half of the stock value in America is tied up in such a few over-priced stocks.
what is current multiple on NFLX??????????????????????
"I'm with a full tattoo Yakuza now. He wanted to go mudding. He's an o.k. dude, but it looks like he's carrying. I'm hoping it's just an IP/GPS scrambler ( yakuza dudes are known for those contraptions) $mnkd $nflx $arna $nvda"
pt upgraded to 480.
Not shorting debtflix this time...it might jump to $380 by next week!
"Monday afternoon buy put option, thank me next day"
It’s actually right now in a 5-1 split mode that can happen if Nflx cares about there shareholders
I have a $515 call for 24th Jul.. am i safe?
The GDP of the US runs at a rate of $19 trillion per year. Think about that when you add up the market cap of some of the larger companies.

Trade war to accelerate market correction.....take your profits while you can. NFLX trading at irrational levels not seeing since 1999-2000 (P/E ratios at almost 300).
Green today?
This will drop back below $500 in a week
Will DD $FUBO earnings fully tonight and add tomm. Patience is a virtue here this is the next $NFLX bigger than Netflix with the sports betting coming real soon. Draft Kings is $30B cap vs $FUBO $3B cap.
"nice, overpriced Netflix with disappointing earning results actually might finish the day on a positive."
"Content providing is becoming me too! NFLX will be forced to switch to an ad revenue sharing model, or suffer a slow painful decline..."
The run up to earnings begins!
F it. I'm keeping my long term long position for another 5 years and shorting with house money under 319. I wish I knew how to do options.
how does nflx data center work and and what company do they use for their memory operation and hardware.would like to invest in what makes nflx great.also am considering buying IQ any ideas?
"I am beginning to wonder if Netflix is paying too much to get “original contents”. AOL comes to mind, I was paying through the nose when it first offered “you got mail” and now I get too much mail and for free. Any thoughts on its future prospects?"
Icahn sold his at around $50/share. If Buffet was lucky enough to buy when Icahn did he would still be holding. He said his favorite holding time is forever. Buy and hold is the best strategy my friends.
Thumbs up if you're up over 100% on the most awesome stock ever!!! :). I'm thumbs upping this post myself as I eclipsed 100% a few weeks ago...
Thinking of adding 3500 shrs tomorrow.
I decide not to sell any put until tuesday next week. And i will stop watching this stock (Except once in two hour) I know this not even worth $300. So I should not worry regardless what happen. Anything go up too fast normally come down. Stock price growing with result is healthy. When it get out of sync it's very risky.
375-400$ is the Target by next friday
"briefing.com29-Jan-18 12:58 ETHMNYHelios & Matheson ( $HMNY ) up 11%: Hearing vague, unconfirmed chatter that Netflix ( $NFLX ) is interested in taking a stake (9.58 +1.00)The MoviePass CEO was an early executive at Netflix."
This is my Big Short......Analysts are still pumping it. Their US new membership increase has decelerated. Now they are competing with Disney on the International front. Who do you think will win internationally? Disney of course.
Back at $505 by Friday!
"Hey Stevo, where's your GIF for the Longs who bought at $385 today?"
Shorts LAST desperate attempt
337.50 before friday
If this is true then WOW! Rocket Shiphttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/netflix-could-add-over-6-193500333.html
Let me see now....cash flow losses in 2019 go to $3.5 billion from $3.0 billion previously. US subscriber guidance of 0.3 million net additions in Q2 is way below consensus. It would appear US subscriber growth has reached a plateau and is about to flatline due to the churn from the massive price hike. US subscriber base may actually decline by 4Q when Disney+ launches. Netflix has no growth remaining in the US.
slight of hands going on here. NFLX did fine. wall street wants you to think otherwise so the big boys can grab more then they will push it to 1000. mark my word...
"Nasdaq Composite Tulip Mania BUBBLE got PUMPED by 170% since March 2020, despite so much terrible news, thanks to Coronavirus Pandemic. Without Pandemic Coronavirus NASDAQ Composite BUBBLE would be around 6000-7000... We need MORE PANDEMICS to PUMP NASDAQ Composite by 200% per year!!!$TSLA $NFLX"
"A Quarter in the Life (of Netflix)The countdown begins, the excitement and anx (for those with a position) builds until both numbers are in view, subscriber adds and guidance for next Q subscriber adds. Then in a flash the stock moves, up as much as 40% (Q4 ER 2012) or down as much as 25% (Q2 ER 2014). The next day the excitement fades and once again all the longtime Netflix skeptics emerge to talk about PE, FCF, and debt until the countdown to the next ER begins."
No news from Apple about streaming = Netflix the king for years to come 
How did a $30 dollar stock get to $300....
"Netflix just said in call that in 2020, the plan is to take over the earth.."
Expect the sugar high to die down next few sessions. Stay long on this one.
$NFLX the TULIP MANIA BUBBLE is COMPLETE OUT OF CONTROL!
I’m little bit worried I hope this can continue the momentum...
$385 easily today
Interesting thought!https://www.barrons.com/articles/the-other-faang-stocks-could-be-holding-netflix-down-1542382004
Almost green again. Not bad.
surprised its not up 10% with earning rep coming on Tues
The one thing that the NFLX shorts seem to have in common is no personal responsibility of any kind. Their losses are all somebody else's fault.
Netflix should buy Lionsgate. Then spin off Stars for % bill. It gets a studio and huge library content for peanuts.
they missed subscriber growth....https://finance.yahoo.com/m/7f126603-69fb-3651-a1c7-695ec61b6a5e/netflix-stock-jumps-on.html

"Yes, it's not as high as most would have liked, but it's still going to be up on a ""down"" day. If tomorrow is an ""up"" day, Netflix should be pulled up further."
here people come buying this discounted stock
525 by Tuesday
Everybody done selling on the news from the Famed Professor 
My calls paid off 
Netflix will close between $435-$450 after earnings report.
Netflix dominating content production with 8 of the top 16 most popular TV series according to Rotten Tomatoes. TV series is the most profitable segment of TV.
"Ok they got it now. On the lightest volume in 2 weeks they just took out yesterdays high. My guess is the 275 puts are now in sight. Disney, amazon, and Verizon all getting in the space-oh yeah-Apple. Everyone of these companies could buy nflx with just their cash on hand but somehow nflx is still trading at 90 times earnings and 6 times sales?"
Strong
"“At the other end of the income statement, Netflix’s adjusted Q2 earnings are projected to skyrocket 433% from $0.15 per share in the prior-year period to $0.80 per share.”"
NFLX has been on fire almost as much as ROKU over the past month! What a beautiful partnership! 
Do you people realize that in the 1.9 trillion stimulus package 400 -500 billion dollars of it goes to bail out the democrat run cities with all of their rioting and illegal immigrant safe havens and misuse of funds ??? See what you have elected? The recession will be coming and soon.
"NFLX will be green tomorrow no matter the outcome in Georgia.. Republicans win and the market stays stable, democratics win and the markets slides but outlook on NFLX will be good due to more lockdowns and stimulus packages! Green tomorrow"
Why is Netfllix selling off today? Anybody know?
"Very nice reversal day and better coming off yesterday's move. The bear market rally looks to be on and will continue the first of the year. Then the real bear market hits. If you don't know bout the correlation between quantitative easing/tightening and market returns, look it up. The Fed is removing $50B a month of reserve assets in their aim to bring the reserves from $4.5 trillion to $2.5T. Don't be a blind lemming. Research it as it is a real factor. Don't fight the Fed is an age old adage. NFLX will not escape it if the correlation continues."
Someone lend me money so I can buy a whole truck load. This going back to 400.00 soon.
Too pricy
I just bought y first 40 share of fubo. Im hoping this will be the next $NFLX in 3-5yrs
350+ tomorrow
Increased valuation by almost a full year of revenue! Talk about crazy. That's like MFST going up $110B in one day! Gamble on!
"73.3 million international and 57.9 million domestic subscribers bringing its total to 131.2 millions.I’m going to laugh all the way to the bank! All naysayers, will be vaporized. Huge wave of covering will ensue. Watch. 500 easily next week."
Time to short.
"This stock reminds me of BLACKBERRY before it dropped from $72 to $8, even though it invented the smartphone and was even nicknamed CRACKBERRY."
Rally eased back perfectly to the week average which is actually a very bullish signal as the week continues at an upward trend. means no more violent whipsaws and continue gaining about 5 points each day
"Another classic comment by investment guru ""Presifdsdsf""4 days ago$NFLX conversation""Guys I'm trying to not be emotional and be objective. I am holding onto a 60k loss. What should I do?"""
Wow selling tomorrow
looks like they beat nicely...
It’s going to 500 today after the bill
"IT'VE GONE UP TO $280, IT IS GOING TO BE BACK TO 300 BEFORE OR AFTER HOLIDAY, ALWAYS STAY HIGHER PRICE IN NEW YEAR !!! LOADING UP MORE AND MORE AS YOU WILL NEVER GONNA SEE THIS PRICE AGAIN !!!"
https://www.engadget.com/2017/12/27/kanye-west-bought-kim-netflix-and-apple-stock-for-christmas/
"IMO Netflix will not lose eyeball share to anyone new including Disney. Amazon Prime is arguably the closest competitor, Netflix was / is first and everyone else is just me too."
Huge sell coming AH
"Actually the longs have several things working for them. A seasonally strong period, better subscriber numbers, and when Trump resolves the issue with China, and he will, the Market will be up 1,000 points."
Every penny gained off the earnings report...gone.
Short it!!!
I see that tonight Cramer said that Netflix is a must-own stock and that you buy it now.
"Why SENS will dominate DEXCOM AND ABBOTT CGM in 3 to 5 years!CGM market is still in infancy. DXCOM, Abbott, Medtronic and Roche only grabbed <10% of CGM market today; the total number of possible diabetics who needs this device are enormous. More and more insurance companies are buying into importance of CGM capabilities in reducing medical complications. The total costs related to diabetes costs just in America annually is Hundreds of billions of dollars each year. It’s much cheaper for insurance companies to pay upfront fees to get CGM implanted then pay for treatments for leg amputations, diabetes blindness, end stage kidney failures, cardiac complications secondary to untreated diabetes. There are many more conditions causing billions of dollars in Medicare due to uncontrolled diabetes. CGM device is literally life savers for millions of people around the world. Currently there is vast untapped markets for both internal and external CGMs in India, China, Middle East, Far East, South America. CGM growth will be exponential over the next decades. Lastly, Medicare will be paying Providers almost twice more to implant Eversense CGM then Dexcom CGM. Main reasons for this? It cheaper in the long run to implant Eversense CGM. Dexcom requires very expensive external sensors changing out every 7 to 10 days. Eversense CGM, no sensor change needed during lifetime of Eversense implant. Great bargain compare to Dexcom G6 or Abbott Libre"
34m shorts will cover soon. No choice. Contracts are up Tuesday.
I just shorted Netflix at 328.67.
pump today sell off at eod.?
"When Greenlight is short on Netflix, one must go long."
"pre market rally, drop to open levels then, back to highs, back down, then finish with end of day rally $CSCO $NFLX $WIMI"
"Longs still strong, up 120%"
Does IBD amateur writers ever watch NFLX for possible breakout? Answer is : no;These IBD writers should get more experience in stock market; Jim Cramer is far superior than those IBD writers!
wow sold at 385... and been waiting to get back in....
Everyone saying this jump is to sudden i just got the mail from ark invest. They bought heavy bags on netflix ah
NFLX $560 coming soon! just look at the past 2 earnings and the channel that this stock has been trading!
Last minute buying on all stocks except NFLX. A lot of people believe that the trade deal will be announced over this weekend.
time to buy when others run hard and fast.lets wait for the big buying but nibbling can be done.
Why are we red when all is green? What game is this? Please be objective if you care to answer.
It seems I made huge mistake being on wrong side of the trade when it got dropped to $336. I shorted with my big savings at $338 and since then this never came back. I knew DIS has yet time and also NFLX was on pressure for few months and that it could bounce any time. I got trapped badly. Not sure when this will return but I’m scared now... 
CEO exercised and sold 95.5k options. So happy I bought puts today :)https://www.secform4.com/insider-trading/1065280.htm
$550 coming soon. You are not to late to load up! earnings are going to be fire!!!
Tomorrow 325 - 310
If you are an investor you should know the answer.
So sad that people buy into one or two investors breaking the resistance
Netflix removing Apple app means subscriber growth is strong baby.
I think it will come back to 400 tomorrow
Do you guys ever read (http://Multistockalerts.com)? They just wrote about NFLX
"every bull is thinking...""it'll pop and ill sell for massive profits"""
Have you seen (new Lucid Air commercials on CNBC) How about calls 4 it's spac (CCIV)? CALLS EXPLODING!GSAT & GTE CALLS EXPLODING! Future World Rumors on the Dark WEb .002 suppose to be a lock!
Tomorrow will green again.
Lol what? Is the fed printing directly into Netflix's stock or something? Who is possibly buying at these levels? This company IS NOT worth more than Disney in any universe.
Why be worried. It only has a market cap of 117b and negative free cash flow
barrons pt increased to 418/shr.
"it's about time we see some green again...., Come on!"
Looking forward to 450 by june !
"With subscriber growth now back on track, look for more upgrades coming."
It will be 400 very soon .

"a little odd to post about rising costs before earnings, no? could it mean losing subscribers or something?"
I made tons of money shorting stocks. Shorting in this market is a lot safer and easier than going long
"Have a nice day you all. Dinner time here in the Netherlands.Let hope it goes green again. Going to watch Tabula Rasa. Belgium show. Very nice, can you watch it in the States?"
Nice work with that $500 price target Goldman.
The...comeback...begins.
"I saw $20 billion in upward gaps within a short period, check it out. Then you see these huge ram it ups. Then you see high speed trading tricks, market orders fills maybe above the ask and bid, hundreds of times. In my honest opinion, it's part of the Ponzi scheme. CMG trades at well over PE = 100, a Mexican restaurant. Doesn't appear to have much growth at all. Dangerous short."
Short Netflix to 300 today!!
"Disney deal complete, waiting for huge opening of streaming in US and international"
$450 here we come
220 after Friday. This stock is going down the toilet. Sold at 310 made me some money :).
https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/19/market-beating-investor-bill-nygren-says-facebook-and-netflix-are-real.html
"My portfolio short Netflix short SQ, and short TSLA, no longs"
NFLX has a smaller market cap than TSLA. Does that seem right?
Good luck NFLX longs. What time earnings going to be released?
I think earnings will be good
"sold my nflx calls , made nice profit, good luck"
Netflix doesn't offer free month trail anymore in Belgium and The Netherlands
NFLX reached a new All Time High at 264.37
Shirted 100 at 582
If this baby closed under 278 then we are good for at least another 30-35 points on the down side.imo
Best day since last Wednesday. Last time we had a HIGH of double digitsWe need the Friday slump to end tomorrow.Last green Friday was oct. 12Only one is the last 9.Can this be the start of something good?
I got out just in time TY Netflix for my new 2018 Jeep
I am holding on for $395. Willing to wait until year end if I have to. All we need is for the old NFLX to regain form.
Another day another high
what happened to 450 ?
Now price target hikes will come in next 2 weeks. it is going 650+. Hold it.
yes it will
tomorrow... dizzy.....again
Looks like blowout subscriber numbers coming. We see a big ramp in the number of Netflix originals on the most popular TV series lists starting in the beginning of December.
Dumping cable for Netflix... makes sense !Why would anyone pay like almost $100.00 for cable television ?? ... and your monthly bills keep going up too/.Netflix have a bright future..
netflix to hit 625 this time around.
Have a hard time to hold it..... Sell or hold......
"Swear this stock will be up 2% by the end of the day, lol."
"Just like it didn't go up from $300 to $400 in one day or one week, it won't go down from $400 to $300 in one day or one week either. NASDAQ 100 is at all time high. So, downside risk is much higher than upside potential for all stocks that have unreasonable valuations at these levels. NFLX is no different..."
I just traded some FB for NFLX yesterday. Not too sure I'm making the right move...thoughts?

Early this morning Goldman Sachs increased price target to 490 from 390 but you have to dig real hard to find the news. If it was a downgrade it would be all over the place. I've always found sentiment indicators to be the most reliable. Netflix is buy until it becomes obvious sentiment is bullish across the board.
Guys After 2 hours we will start buy 40k share Just follow me This week up to 380$
We are up to .04% in after market. Should be back to 420 by tomorrow
let's hope it won't drop below 540 before the bell
The problem with NFLX is they are no longer a trend setter. Streaming has caught up with them They do not own the secret sauce and others such as Disney will rapidly fill the entertainment void with a vast library of rich content. None of the media giants can deliver new content like Disney. The only thing slowing Disney is their leadership as they slowly embrace streaming.
"If we open between 369 and 370, look for the high to be at least 372. If it goes above that, it's a bonus."
Should I hold my puts through earnings or should I close out with decent profit?
They seem to imply that content spending and hence Free cash flow is a temporary problem. What a total and complete joke. I've never been more sure that this company will be bankrupt within five years or less
Good lord why did I sell when it dropped to $280? FML
The future is in free streaming with advertising. How well will NFLX make the transformation? People talk about them risings price... things get cheaper in todays tech era. Apple showed us increasing the price of the same product can be the kiss of death. Then you hear about the overseas growth and growth in general. All growth is priced in at this point. Also many weak retail investors buying what they know....the type the that run when they see shares sinking
"far from over, video streaming site should not be worth more than Disney"
"This was there strongest quarter from seasonality perspective. They also tend to always do well and FCF is to be expected in light of stay at home environment. That said, this stock isn't a value play, its supposed to be growth play. Will new subscribers be sustainable even if they pull out great content? I think netflix's best days are behind it and absent diversifying their business model, probably is range bound at best."
Bongrip Capital initiates coverage at MASSIVE BUY PT $500
362/share by the end of today
NFLX==confusing stock==market does not like its story!==sell!
do not need joetrader statment- easy 10 points down. It´s 3 points down an 15 points up and 5 point up next day and 10 point up next and flat after that.
beating the resistance..370
"want to short at 260, some one keep buying to push it there"
"After seeing Bird Box, I now enjoy watching Netflix much better blindfolded."
Will finish in Green today. New highs by Friday.
With all their debt and now rising interest rates and completion you have to wonder why they are screaming for HELP by raising fees this is a big gamble on their part if you ask me since they had a bad experience in the past by doing the exact same thing only this one on a much larger scale.
Options writers win again.
Trading above $359 in pre market
I hope it drops so I can buy more NFLX!
IT WILL HIT 570 TONIGHT
I don't own Netflix but am watching it for the impact it will have In the market this week. I believe Netflix will have a positive report.
If it goes over 357.30 it will be a new high for the month and highest since July 27.

$375.00's tomorrow and more
"Wow!! I am so glad I walked away from buying puts on this stock since the last earnings - just looked again this morning. What A GIFT above 400... for put options - And the guy with the new 500 price target saying that NFLX was the Lebron James of Content (as part of his 500 price target justification).. spoke to me that the END is near for both NFLX and AMZN... You know what I'm talking about if you paid attention in ""how to value a company"" class..."
Going past 500.00 pretty soon thank me now or cry later trust me I know and I really do its facts not some BS starting tomorrow & engaging as of next week gonna power burst it unto that level & hover and hold then up some more could care less if you believe me I hold mine and I have plenty
Investors from retail sector will sell their shares and will buy tech sector with their money..... That was what happened on Monday when oil price reached to 70$
Ok - pre earnings this moon soon
$500.00 is coming to a movie near you
Bought another truckload at $288. McHaney with RBC is is bullish on NFLX. Research shows that 66+% will have more than one service. So Disney is not really a threat. Paying $50-75 a month is very reasonable. A family of four going to see one movie spends more than that.
looks like its going to hit 280 today
1000 this year.
"Monumental comeback.. come on, make your way to 325 now.."
Ouch
"You buy $NFLX and I'll buy $DIS, we'll see which one goes up. Friday, it looks like investors ran from $AMZN, $APPL, and $NFLX to $DIS. Not only has Disney been in business since 1923, it has family oriented content. Netflix is ok, but for me, it's entirely too liberal. I get it, Netflix is trying to appeal to everyone, but I still don't like it. Disney has a ton of potential for growth that investors like, for example, amusement parks, streaming, cruises, it just acquired FOX, etc."
"Meaby 520 in july,earning dosen´t matter. 540 would take out most of the shorts."
Shorts have been obliterated. Cash on the sidelines ready to buy any dip. Shorting NFLX is literally throwing away money.
"“In a note to investors on Tuesday, GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives raised his Netflix price target from $400 to $500 a share. He said the decision reflects “stronger than expected subscriber growth for the rest of 2018 and 2019” and continued growth in international markets. Netflix shares are currently trading at $397.75.”http://fortune.com/2018/06/19/netflix-stock-price/"
TOO BIG TO FALL. NFLX is the pioneer in streaming service no matter what you say. AMZN; GOOGLE; APPLE; MSFT; FB. Just like that. Now go to sleep and relax.
"The past couple of days, these post have been getting deleted. not sure whyClose on Dec. 19 since 20082008 3.962011 9.592012 13.432013 53.822014 48.592016 125.452017 187.022018 266.77"
"All these people thinking the stock will rise tomorrow, you’re delusional. Newsflash: we’re in a bear market. These last two week will be a blip in the radar on the road down, we’re going much much lower than December’s lows very soon. 8 years of artificially low interest rates built up a massive asset bubble, it’s already popped"
it'll easily reach US$400 by Friday
360 today.
any news?
It will reach all time high again by the end of next week.Who agree with me give a thumbs up...
Under water since it was $555 at last Sep. Finally I have it dumped. Good luck everyone !
Daniel Ives still has $500 price target on NFLS. I trust him more than the posters on this board.
NFLX will be 200 next year...the poor cant afford it anymore
analysts said it's going green today!!
This is still concerning. This just may open up in the 350's on Monday. There is nothing to be excited about over the weekend.
380 resistance BREAKOUT!
"If you're destin to own this stock through earnings with a target price of 365.00 check out the buying the jan 25th calls for 7.75 one contract will cost u 780,00 includes the commision. 1 contract equals 1,000 shares of NFLX stock. Much less risk if your objective is a great earnings call since you can only lose your 780.00 original buy price if out of the money however, if it doesn't crash you still have a time value. My point is don't end up paying 33k on 100 shares of stock you will lose way more than 800.00 if it turns against you. I tried to explain as simple as I could that trading options is fun with much less risk and NOT hard as long as you have a plan. GL"
You all knew I predicted below 500 for the end of the week lol
"LOL NFLX is on a roll- first Susan Rice, then the Obamas, now... ""A documentary chronicling the life and times of controversial Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan will appear on Netflix in August."""
"One thing I learned. Never listen to the bad comments here. If the stocks are at low price, buy them and you will be rewarded. Thanks Netflix. 600$ Soon. It was a great news today."
Whole market is down!...time to buy...roller coaster week special...
Down 4% on nothing.
"It is getting higher and steady, going to load up more !!!!!Time to rock !!!!!!!!!!"
Lets take this to $400 then we can have that 30% market correction.
Why doesn't someone take NFLX private at $420
"How is a single ""TV channel"" with 1/5 of the revenue and 1/20 of the profit be worth 90% of Disney? Is al this hype really about content? That is absurd, and while Netflix is a fine company, it is way overvalued. If it is all about content then Disney should be 5X the market cap of Netflix. Disney has a TV channel, plus they produce blockbuster films, they own Marvel, Star Wars (Lucas Films), Pixar, ABC and ESPN (additional channels that produce their own content); plus Disney has real assets - namely two theme parks that throw off billions in profits annually and the real estate itself is valued at $3-4 billion. But business is not all about content. That is just moronic hype. Business is about making money, period. Disney has multiple streams of income and much of it is all integrated. Make a princess movie that makes $100-300 million in profit, sell gobs of profitable toys and costumes of said princess along with other profitable royalties, then charge families $400 so their daughter can dress up like the princess and eat chicken tenders with her in a castle in Orlando. Netflix has none of those highly profitable additional income streams. Any media company could easily start competing with Netflix just by streaming their content. Netflix doesn't own the pipe to its customers like Comcast who sells content and high-speed internet over the same cable, two income streams. Amazon does what Netflix does but its service costs less and you get free 2-day shipping on just about anything you order. Netflix is absolutely overvalued and I think will trade below $100 within 2-3 years. It may have peaked recently and the options market definitely is bearish on this stock. CBO market is not always right in the short-term, but often has a pretty good read on the overall prospects for a companies future stock price."
How many ppl here use cable tv in here?.. Just wonder.... How much for a month you have to pay?..

looks like it held up strong
350 coming.
This stock has that big D
Below 500 by Friday
NFLX only has 1% of India’s subscribers. Possibly Huge upside for every % increase.
one day you’ll walk to the movie theatre owned by Netflix and running blockbuster movies produced by Netflix just like lionsgate or Warner bros or dream works. Netflix is going to be just Netflix of today. Companies evolve. Is Jeff bezos still JUST selling books online???? No he’s selling the world online!! People’s visions are so week and that’s why all they know what to do is making money from day trading while others are busy planning the future.

This stock is amazing. Going up everyday forever.
Cramer said buy NFLX last night.
You can see how the shorts are shivering on this board by reading their messages
I say tomorrow is a coin toss 2-3% again up or down. Wednesday we bounce back to 360 + wishful thinking ?
"14% jump in a 200b company, yep, bull market is almost over"
"This will hit $550 by friday! No worries, have you seen the charts, option charts, and expected earnings! this is going to the moon finally."
Netflix is in the green.
You can either buy it now for $440 or buy it later at $500-600. Up to you
"Looks like the train is leaving the station again, next stop 360."

Have any of you even seen the Disney app? It’s very average. After everyone sees the marvel movies and Disney movies then what?? It will take them a few years to catch up to Netflix. It’s not that impressive

"So what I saw today from watching the tape. Retail buying and chasing up(small lots)...meanwhile, the market maker was picking up those orders and then eventually sliding them over to large block sells (plus 7000) . Still don't know what to make of all this but be on guard."
bought more at $308.66
how are your new short positions working out?
The DOW is green let’s get this NETFLIX back up 355
Minimum wage at $15.00 will make this stock triple.Inflation!!!!

"I started buying Netflix before last ER in the $500 range. I sold half of what I had at $590 after ER, then I sold the rest between $550-$580. Now I'm nibbling here again. If it goes up, great, if it comes down into 520s or even lower, then I have dry powder to buy more, so let's go. Swing time."
"Volume is low, it is just manipulation. Hold on!"
Netflix has always beat subscriber expectations whenever it releases the first season of a big hit original series. The Queen’s Gambit is one the biggest of them all.
Looking like a beat has leaked....sorry shorts
Netflix buy AMC soon
Netflix report after the bell. It's the law.
"Netflix need 250 million subscriber to be sustainable, and I think they will con with strategy other than the O’s films to increase that number. I’m holding on to my loss for another week to see what happens. I bought on 400$ and I hope it will come near tha amount in a couple weeks. If not just cut the losses and move on."
"new highs are inevitable. pension, hedge funds, and fan boys will make it so."
the green pattern was broken yesterday red is the new Netflix

So I️ need honest opinions will Netflix rise in the after hours? Experts only
Ive been burned so many times by Baron’s predictions in the past. They should be banned.
MARGIN CALLS COMING IN TOWN BUBBLE BUYERS
The hits just keep on coming:https://www.engadget.com/2019/06/03/netflix-magic-the-gathering-anime-russo-brothers
Who bought a $480 call for Friday?
Taking profit today would be very wise
Who let the bulls out.
"gunna get a 3-tier setup here for SHORT on NFLX, easy $5 intraday gain...watch and learn....first entry now at 419.55. Then again at 421.55 (2nd tier, if hits), then 3rd tier $2 past alltime high (if hits)....but chances are is will pullback to 414.55 for our $5 intraday profit"
Looks like another all time high at opening. Go Netflix!
"Netflix borrows big to produce original content which was feasible until now with low interest rates. With rising interest rates and its rising Debt/Equity ratio, big investors know the problem and will be ready to sell.

this market will turn green and close 375 today.
600 call volume for next week is insane. Wonder if it’ll get up to that.
EVERYONE I talk to about NETFLIX says the same thing. There is nothing good to watch on Netflix AND they were getting tired of the shift to more foreign content.

"If you are selling NFLX due to old kangaroo called DIS entering the show then you are short sighted. Online video streaming is accelerating and I can tell you for every industry there is always number one and others. Nobody will cancel NFLX to have Disney, families will have it as an add on for the kids and that’s about it."
Apple is getting into the streaming business. Thats why stock is down. Netflix is going to have to compete with Apple and Amazon. Two companies with all the money

"Netflix is going to price itself out of the market. I refuse to pay $15-20 a month for their ""service"". There are few hit shows that I need to watch. House of Cards used to do it, but they are over. I watch some sitcoms & shows here or there, but if they want to push the $15-20 a month barrier, I will cut the Netflix cord.Sling is $25 and presenting live TV: ESPN, news, etc. 40+ channels. It's a much better deal. I'm sorry, but this is a lousy move for Netflix. They need to enforce that your account can only be logged in on a handful (maybe 5?) devices. Too many people are STEALING by using logins from friends/relatives. Speaking of which, TIME TO CHANGE MY PASSWORD!!"
netflix will hit $500 by EOY this is so easy

The PE is up around 134 or so, it got pumped too high, 3 times too high or more even. It depends on their quarterly results. Seems to be support at $295 or $280 as well. Just an observation."
its the gift that keeps on giving
Any thoughts on a split??????? Price way to high for people to buy in
Don’t miss out 575.00 before end of year!!!
I'm working an MOC after shorting. I expect that break into close. Profit taking into a large gap on chart. GL Yahoos
If you believe in streaming invest in Disney as well. I am long $DIS and short $NFLX (Although for netflix my exit point on short is near (I would not remain short below $230-240. I will exit 260 actually but may continue sell out of money calls for premium until it reach below 250 and buy if this goes below 150 (Which seem unlikely but in this market nothing impossible.)
Controlled selling will continue folks until stock hits $200's. It's obvious that big boys are exiting but don't want it to go down so fast.....they want to get as much money out (small retail investors will be holding the bag).
FIFA should effect this stock this quarter
People are investing in Netflix like their Subscriber growth not slowing ever. It's own history is not consistent. But at least until now it keep growing so far.But if you look into HBO history. Incredible growth between 2010 to 2014 ( from 81 million to 138 million ) subscriber. It then dip next year to 132 Million subscriber. What will happen to Netflix price specially if remain inflated like this.https://www.statista.com/statistics/329277/number-hbo-subscribers/
I SHORTED NETFLIX I THINK IT WILL DROP WHEN REPORT I SHORTED AT $505. I THINK IT WILL DROP SINCE DISNEY AND ROKU AROUND..........................................SO I SAY SHORT IT WE CAN MAKE PROFIT IT WILL DROP I SAY

"Positive earning results next week, will make pps fly to $330."
Every rational business owner(if you own stock...you are one)....should ask themselves is this business only worth 155B. Maybe to wall street it is for now after the earnings..who knows. But if one believes the projected 2B+ in profis they do for 2019 is just the beginning of the scaling...it ain't. Your decision. Its a good offer though not going to lie..Z
Barclays just upgraded it
I'm hoping for a pop to $435-$440 after earnings.
Most institutional debt investors will not touch the bonds of Netflix. What does that say about the value of the equity?
Anyone else think $NFLX is expected to have huge earnings and great new subscriber growth but is probably priced in already so once numbers are released it could go down?
The run to 750 begins now
It's just FOMO there will be plenty of profit taking tomorrow. It's near all time high. Literally no sellers after hours so they're all waiting until the opening bell when the spread is lower. 1000 share bids on the ask and 5 shares on the sell says it all. It will test VWAP then carry on tomorrow.
Careful fellow shorts. NFLX went on a subscriber gain blitz giving away 3 month trials. Subscriber count will jump artificially.
Nobody is leaving netflix for such a minor price increase.
"I have a netflix account . But honestly, netflix's revenue is not diversified enough , basically from membership. Unlike Disney or Amazon. If giving enough time, I believe the streaming business will have more competitors from those giants. Then it has to keep raising membership fee to stay a flow. We will see how this model goes."
I predict earnings of $1.58 and 6.8 million new subscribers. 52 week high on Wednesday. Buy now.
364 by wednesday. About to break out
"if you're thinking long term, this is a great time to pick some up."
Covered yesterday. Just shorted more again.
"buy here and you will be happy . I told you at 250, 280 and 300 . This is will be best short term gain you will have . This stock will be above 400 tomorrow"

"If the newbies here knew how hard it is to get Sektor for his money and how nflx took it twice.Well than they would know the truth about how risky nflx is at earnings.This is the private whales favorite stock to sell mountains of calls, puts, and shares in, then say five minutes after so many are #$%$ secknds after nflx earnings releasedwell, what did you expect, it moved too much, before earnings the last few weeks or months for that matterIf I had to bet on nflx and I wouldn't but because I'm getting tko many emails on seeking alpha and here asking me.I'd bet on a washout of both calls and puts, maybe 5 to 9 % one way or the other.Their is no science or reasonable method or formula to a netflix bet.That's why sektor's in gte gsat eh and not nflxget it?Sektor"
"Disney Lost 1 Billion dollars in streaming which wont start until later this year and it wants to compete with NFLX? What a joke! The media company , Disney, said in a filing on Friday that its investment in Hulu was the primary contributor to a $580 million loss in equity investments in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30. Additionally, Disney lost $469 million in its direct-to consumer-segment, largely from BAMtech, the streaming technology that powers ESPN+ and other over-the-top services."
It might close the week at $265 or around.
"This Citron guy should be arrested. He tried the same manoeuvre on SHOP and ROKU. The stocks rebounded shortly after, as there was no basis for his comments."
Buy now and thank me later.
India Numbers lagged coz of Cricket World Cup and Elections. No provider has given so popular and original cult shows than NFLX. It will rocket up soon

"Viewership and Membership UP BIG in March ""and"" production basically zero so no cost for producing NFLX originals (as no shooting was happening). NFLX saved a lot of revenue due to zero production in March and they also increased revenues due to higher memberships. All of this means share price will be going much much HIGHER!!"
Like I said we going to $400 in less than 2 weeks.
"A company with 3 billion in cash 5 billion in current liabilities and 10 billion iin long term debt, Will be bankrupt"
Shorts are fighting it but watch them scramble after earnings is announced.
Big crash coming
"I made a mistake and went long too early with this, expecting a bounce back when it dropped below $300. Market seems to want to take this down more, and I remember several rides this year on the way up when it would go up for 6 or 8 days in a row. I now fear it could do that on the way down. The one piece of good news with this is the sub growth, which is going to beat expectations once again, but that is 3 weeks off. Cant hang on that long if this keeps grinding down. I will likely bail tomorrow if another red day. Good luck to longs."

This is not the point where you should be shorting this one. It has a long history of trading like this for a few days and then wham it goes back into high gear. I had been watching this stock since its inception. Wish I had bought it back then. It used to be 50 ten years ago prior to many splits. Even three years ago it was pretty low and one time I bought it and it just kept going down. When it went down from 330 to 305 I got out (it was before 1:3 split in 2013). And here we go.
"the GDP is around $31 trillion. That's money changing hands. Wmt used to have an income of 5% of their revenue, maybe it is less now. Point is, the most the country income is is likely $3 trillion.The interest on the national debt is $600 billion and likely to climb, even without the debt moving north. That's 20% of the national total income.That's a serious issue and the entire country is in denial.So, QE4 or QE5, whatever you might imagine is likely to be muted out of necessity. Costs need to be cut, which will likely put serious downside on the economy, like it or not. A recession is upon us."
This will fall at least to 290 during the conference call.And settle down somewhere at 285.Netflix has run up too high too fast.Time for correction!
I will have 800 short as my 3 360 call will exercised (Assuming it get exercised). My average now stand 353 for those. Loved this rally. Going to help me make thousands more eventually.
"Todd Gordon was on CNBC after whiffing badly on his short trade. He tried desperately to say it won’t break out to new highs. After slamming earnings/subs and guiding next quarter for more than expected subs! His take is nothing more than arrogant and self serving. Like most of these other so called “experts” who lowered their estimate into earnings, some people never learn. I trust RH! Congrats to all longs...see ya’ll at 500!"
Posters: this space is for NFLX related comments only! Keep your political wisdom to yourself.

This is only the beginning. Price targets all over this green earth at around $750 and higher. I will give it about a month before we hit that target. The analyst aren't giving us a 1 week target...realistically it's a 1 month target.
It will reach to 500$ each share so soon
Oh come on...enough of this drop.
"I will continue to say this is a dead cat bounce. Some funds are caught with the surprise and even though NFLX had quarters like this, it is different this time. A few years ago the cable guys and network were asleep at the wheel and there was no AMZN, HULU and APPL. The competition is definitely different this round and the results in the past quarter are reflective of this. People are lured to other providers besides NFLX. They may have some original content but others can also put money on creating something even better. As for international subscribers in Asia, there are not many paying customers as people are used to free content and there are lots of those TV top boxes now that are floating around. No one is willing to pay for content there. And China will be a big joke. Just wait til trade war extends to content and the Chinese will ban all partnerships to show content that they define as immorale western values."
bought this thing at 570 and have been a bag holder since...
Honestly this stock could be argued to be worth more or less depending on whether we are basing everything on the future or the current. But more importantly it’s just what the ambience of what people want to do with it
"Well, it may be time to grossly recalibrate my thinking about what a company is actually worth. If Tesla is allowed to have a negative 12 dollars EPS and can rally 4 percent today, then I guess we can justify Netflix at a price of 10,000 per share; just like bitcoin. Why not? Boy, bonds are starting to look real good to me."
By Friday right back to 400s. Amateur panic sellers just make us big investors big more money.

"I said this on Monday. We would get about 4 negative days this week and 1 positive day. This is not the type of market to hold your money in over night. 2018 is much harder to make money. If you make a 5% or 10% gain in a day, you better sale in order to keep your money"
"Does anyone consider how much more appealing the content of Netflix is to international subscribers than Disney or any of the competition? Personally, i could care less about a few popular American movies when I can choose so many good ones you probably have never heard of on Netflix and many were aimed for the non-usa audience. Does anyone realize that Netflix could put content in theatres too, or use advertising in a limited way to augment income?"
is this the beginning of our run into earnings?
"Broke 524 resistance, tomorrow up past 530!"
"A lot of air under this one, drops could get dramatic."
"I'm a LT investor in NFLX, in at $88/share. If you only invest in the stock and not actually consume the service, you are truly not seeing the potential of the impact NFLX has. I'm a Moderate, so this news about Susan Rice and signing on the Obama's to produce some shows has no decision on my investment. If people can look past that, they can see the value of this platform. I just finished watching ""Trump the American Dream"" and I can say it was fascinating to see how he achieved winning the Presidency and I had no idea how much of it was influenced by Pat Buchanan and Jesse Ventura. In short, you don't like what's streaming, you can scroll right through the listing, but if you open your mind to varying viewpoints, I like that NFLX offers me choices."
Spoiler alert Netflix has strong earnings beating all the estimates
"Analysts never get it right, NFLX will beat the number and guide higher."
Dis will dominate this IMO!
Down in after hours of course
90 New movies a year planned by Netflix.
"Resistance at 575, if crossed then 670-680."
Where is larry who predicted oil price will fall and NFLX has nothing to do with Iran Deal?
you have to believe Netflix will lose some percentage of subs
"in a previous post I took the revenue growth rate quarter to quarter and compounded it and got 18% growth ratethat's the most up to date picture of what is going on and things got worse with Coronavirusfor example Nedham sees Coronavirus a risk to Netflix's global growth content cost went up abut 30% as wellso why does Netflix deserve a PE of 94, when Google has a PE of 25, Disney at 17.6, Apple at 21 all yesterday's numbers (but close to today, today is higher)And as you know Netflix has a negative cash flow of around 3.2 BillionI think Netflix's price should be cut in half at least. I see half as happening quick and more later, it should be on par with the competition."
Way overpriced stock. The fall will be hard on this stock.
Chart is literally doing the exact same thing as yesterday if so looks like we should be hitting 564 ish
"This is crazy, I mean at least Amazon can somewhat justify their market cap. This though? There's no way they'll ever make enough money going off $11 per month subscription fees."
CAN SOMEONE TELL ME WHEN TO SHORT THIS BUBBLE? THANKS
"20,000 in puts"
"Glad I sold half today. Holding ANY tech thru earnings is not worth the risk vs. reward. When FB dropped $45 on earnings...you know there is NO CHANCE it’s going to rise $45. Same goes for NFLX. upside is limited, downside is huge. Just not worth it. Calculable decision."
Could an educated intelligent long tell me why this is up and how it deserves the valuation the market is giving it?
Next stop is 400 they gonna keep raising the price on this stock . Best stock in wall street.
how someone will not buy this under 500?the whole world on quarantine sitting home watching Netflix while earnings report are on the way

"My charts say NFLX is going to soar AH ... and if you believe that, I have some beachfront property in Kansas I would like to sell you."
Expect more than 10 million subscribers... Maybe 12 this last quarter.
"Incase anyone is uncertain, yes, the selling is way overdone from both a technical and fundamental level. Technically, the MFI is below 20, way oversold. On the fundamentals, keep in mind that Q2 earnings, margins, and revenue were all in-line with forecast despite the fact that the subscriber forecast was missed by a million. That is a staggering achievement totally overlooked by the media. I expect Q3 to be a blowout so the next couplle months will likely be very choppy and should be viewed as a chance to add to positions rather than waiting for a sell point. The largest number of shares this year were purchased between 320 - 330 so look for resistance at or slightly above that level."
I called a couple of my friends yesterday that work in the banks and told them to load up Netflix. This is going over the all time high soon. They where buying but said waiting for today to see what happens it’s looking real good. Going to $360.00.
I use to have Netflix but switched to HBO Max and glad I did.
"Market down?............ Scroo it, I'll watch Netflix!"
"Article today someplace (appears authentic but frivolous, not bothering with the link) stating traders are positioning ahead of earnings for the inevitable decline after earnings. I'm counter positioned with short term calls and shares. After 3 quarters of misses, time for a beat."
Am I the only one who thinks it will be back up next week?

Tacked on another billion today and now up 8.5% in 4 days. Hard to know how much further this can go. I started a short when it went over 206 and have averaged up to 207 but the train is pulling away. This could hit 210 today and 220 next week.
Take profits till it lasts
"earnings report soon: July 16, 2018!"
Hopefully close above 300
Holding long and hard in at 332 3 years ago selling half at 664 then riding the rest let’s go Netflix the best I the world

Predicting the daily rise and fall of a stock with the same probability as flipping a coin $AMZN $WIMI $NFLX
Mr Left is laughing all the way to the bank today.
What you guys think will be the price after today’s earnings?
"Who all are not getting sleep tonight,please raise your hand."
"$INTC $NFLX $WIMI $BA most of the tech stocks sitting on strong support level and they have strong earnings coming up. Chart is also setting up very nicely, wouldn't be surprise to see strong price action upwards for the next few weeks."
$ROKU Bounced off nicely from the 50dMA. Profit takers and weak hands are now flushed out. New money should be coming in and we should be heading to $500.... $TSLA bounced off nicely after a long consolidation. For ROKU RSI of 46 is quite low and I expect quick upside is in the offing..... $QQQ $NFLX $AAPL $QS $SQ $TWTR $UBER

"Sub growth is for headline readers. So much more info needed like cost of acquisition, ARPU, margins, and most important debt to equity. Only lemmings focus just on sub growth."
"Earning beat will not save Netflix, 50% drop is imminent. PT reduced to $175 by independent reviewers"
"People don't look into but it increasingly costly for Netflix to get subscriber. This include Domestic being more difficult but Overseas this is slowly becoming problem as well.They spending whole lot to get growth but cost to get new Subscriber is not sustainable.Domestic it already reaching near $100 and overseas it's near $50.Domestic is worst it double over last couple year. That mean it's increasingly difficult for new customer which expected given most already have it. Overeas given 150 country launch, it's hard to determine but I think last Quater it's clear, cost is raising very quickly.Now why they keep spending more on advertisement in domestic.simple:- They have to replace all customer who they losing. Otherwise it will look they start losing subscriber instead gaining and stock will tank. If stock tank, it will much harder to finance spending & also retain talent. They likely offering stock as part of their content deal as well.In otherword, This is how you can hide serious problem with either Churn Rate or harder to get new customer.It's also possible that many are keep cancelling and resigning. Again that's actually best hope. Otherwise some point it will hard to replace leaving customer and stock will tank very badly."
All time high in 2 months?
Go go go I love Netflix not selling till 2022
Closing green
Netflix Traders Bet Stock Will Gain 10% After Resultshttps://www.investopedia.com/news/netflix-traders-bet-stock-will-gain-10-after-results/?partner=YahooSA&yptr=yahoo
"Where's Cramer to tell us how awesome FAANG is? Oh yeah, he's recovering from a weekend in the Hamptons with his hedge fund buddies who sold last week."
International growth will take NFLX much higher. Bet on it. $330.00 minimum Tuesday am.
"Don't frequent this board much. I'm only 21. I do have 100 shares of AMZN my dad put in my UGMA account. Not bad for someone my age. At least I won't be working at Hooters. I don't know Tilly but, I know he's arrogant. I also know that NFLX is about ready to close above its 200 day moving average which could be very good."
Slap that ask let's punish the shorts this afternoon
What's the easiest way to buy downside protection with options?
The gains are just about gone.
last thing i wanna do with my life is sign up for netflix and watch the obama’s again for 8+ moreyears.
An astounding 8.8 million subs in this past quarter. No one expected that many new subs. I have been in this stock for many years. I have done very well and not about to sell any time soon.
Did you ever hear about (http://Multistockalerts.com)? They just covered NFLX this AM
"NFLX is looking like the new AAPL in stock ownership. October, 2012 it was 50.00 than it went to 700.00, split 7 for 1 and know it's 322.00 so that makes it worth 2254.00 a share now and don't see any competition either. Certainly not Amazon."
240 soon
I invested in T. It provides a 7% dividend owns both the pipe and premium content with HBO max and its price is a fraction of Netflix with a p/e of 8 versus Netflix's 56. Sooner or later the market will understand this.
So the weekend action on the board tells me that the shorts had a nervous weekend. Just got back from a relaxing weekend and pumped for another awesome week for NFLX. Lets get this to $360 guys. It helps keep the shorts crying under their pillows and it is fun to see them hiding all day. Can I hear the longs give me a hell yeah? And any shorts who gave up are welcome to join and give me a hell yeah too :)? Lets keep the rally going guys and keep the shorts running.
So AMZN had a great quarter nut weak guidance and NFLX had a great quarter and Great guidance and the stock went down. Does not make sense.
Bears getting crushed today
Look at NFLX rally!!! GO NFLX GO!!!
let's go back to 500!!
Next step is to raise the sub fees. Need more free cash flow without relying on debt!!
$NFLX now I want you to go down baby! you were beautiful today! But that's enough!No greed - no sorrow!
So many stocks bled out today... I think market is heading for a major correction. Market is extremely top heavy and over valued right now and will correct itself IMO. Not looking forward to September...
NFLX barely has a presence in China which is the primary reason for AAPL's revenue issues. Robots are trading this. Will snap back tomorrow when actual people are trading.
230 to 270 in a week just as sharp as the fall a week before. Congrats to those who were able to get into when it was down. Sorry for those who got scared and sold out cheap. Last week every story in financial media was about market's demise. Those stories disappeared quickly.
no one is safe anymore
Well looks like my buy at 384 yesterday looks pretty good today.
Sell when others buy. Buy when other sell. Take profit before losing it
"For the second quarter 2018, analysts estimate NFLX will generate revenues of $3.9B, an increase of 41.46% over the prior year second quarter results. Time to buy!"
So many free sights you don't need Netfux.
Holding and watching this earnings
End of Game of Thrones Series = increase in NFLX subscribers!
This time next week All time high
So nice to settle into a place that everyone’s happy with. .. Let’s all just take a deep breath and share a big hug. :)

If you let my daughter go now, that'll be the end of it.$vrx $nflx $arna $nvda"
The days of NFLX's monopoly on streaming entertainment are long gone. Everybody is doing it now. Their multiple will merge towards the mean of entertainment companies.
"Good premarket movement, it’ll be back up to 400+ early morning."
What will happen if Apple bids on Netflix??
I am an independent voter. Not democratic nor republican. What Netflix failed to announce was the number of subscribers that dropped Netflix once they announced the Obama show. That number will over double once the show hits the Netflix stream. Netflix should never politicize their platform. Lots of pain to come. This is dead money at this point. I am out.
Was priced about 3 years ahead of itself
Up up up ... Easily at least 5% Today
$350 has become strong support now. Upside is unlimited. It’s an open-sky chart.
Oh the humanity...!
"Bankers sell then pause and wait for retail investors to buy then bankers sell again. Greedy retail investors will hold the bags, but they deserve holding the bags and learn"
"DIS is the growth company with them entering the market, nflx not so much, scrounging around in the remote areas of the globe for international growth. How is it that revenue per subscription is only slightly lower when entering less affluent countries in South America, Asia, India, etc. The math doesn't work unless they are paying $9-10 per month."
would netflix share skyrocket as well after amazon and google beat earning?
"Netflix (NFLX) PT Raised to $375 at Cowen; 'Strong Sub Growth Across the Board'April 17, 2018 2:22 AM"
investigation needed
"Someone please explain the difference between a bubble and a ""momentum"" stock. Seems to be some confusion on here between the two"
50% chance this opens above 600 the next day after ER.
"Never been so confident shorting Netflix, am pretty sure it don’t have big upside and sure it will in 200s sooner or later"
"We have now gone 10 days without hitting a +10 on the HIGH for the day.Longest streak since going 29 from July 10 to Aug 17 of this yearFrom 8/20 to 11/7, the high reached at least 10 17 times.....This is such a mess......."
I carry a 50% open % gain on Netflix! Why would I panic over a -2.25% one day drop! Let's have this same discussion in 3 years!
netflix signs rob reiner for new movie.
Sell sell sell. Debt continues to rise and competition is increasing. NFLX has no other revenue stream. Waiting for them to announce ad-based plans.
"I don’t see $400 today, let’s not get overly exuberant."
we have last minute surge!!
"nflx p/e is still 238 and forward p/e 77....there is still a lot of room to go down. be realistic about this folks, no buying on the dip please, this i way overvalued"
WOW
Shorts panic and covering now...... Yay...
MOON BOUND T-180 minutes.
"somebody just bought 95,000 shares.. wow"
Can someone explain why Netflix is down after hours? Earning Report was decent no?
"Tomorrow, the US stock market is likely to remain anemic all day."
Wow... Can this go even up tomorrow? Any thoughts.
"Remember 2016, after hitting a high of 130 the previous year the stock couldn’t get out of its own way at 90. The same thing is happening 3 years later but the stock is 3 fold higher. The market will do its best to separate you from your shares. Don’t let it do it."

This market is getting so easy to predict. Let's get prepared for another 200 point down day.
Wrong SG. They raised prices because then on the ER call they don't have to get funding for more content. Their game is to have the best and most content to stay on top. Commercial Free. I'll pay 300% increase not to have to watch commercials.
who would've ever thunk that $325 would be a buy price.
We ditched NFLX in big numbers!Just check out your nextdoor Conversation
You can hear pin drop here.... Yes?
NFLX IS HOT HOT 30 POINTS UP SIDE AFTER HOURS 10 TO 15 POINTS ON THE UP SIDE
Excitement is nice just like the horror movies on Netflix 
lol most of you people have no idea how big of a bubble this stock is... nflx can drop 50% and it still will be expensive... I say this not to scare you but just stating facts. Most people in the dot com bubble didn't think about the downside either.. most were completely wiped out. Would you pay 100M for your local gas station that earned 200k a year? No is the obvious answer. That's how much your paying for NFLX...
330 open close 340

Man I loaded up this is going 330.00 closing green. Kevin O’Leary said loves Netflix and buying more more. Watch this turn up trend. CNBC loves to scare people out of there money and have people panic.
How many shorties are hurt today ?
More subscribers than expected makes competitors less willing to compete with Netflix on price.
wow look like is going back on track
strong finish.700 by friday
"TD101 the market in general has been down, even apple and Microsoft and Disney only went up 0.13 percent today, it will recover"
"i'm going to buy NFLX before ER tomorrow so it will crash. When I buy the stock price crash. When I short, stock price spike."
Netflix is giant king streaming in the world
"be alert: July 16, NFLX will report earnings: blowout!"
This stock will be back at 400 by the end of the week or next week.
"Netflix up 10% market down 7% since ER, a watershed moment which showed by adding Netflix originals they can raise subscription fees and still grow subscriptions."

Lunch is done now the buying starts again.
"nothing comes close to Netflix contents and programming not even a giant like amazon, all others are decades behind,"
"Looking at picking up 10 shares or so, best to wait or get in?"
"Which analyst will bail out Netflix tomorrow. They have been saved by multiple analyst on every sell-off. Eventually, they will run out of upgrades based on previous stated upgrades."
One thing is for sure--Disney makes a lot of money off its movies. Nflx does not
doing pretty good for a miss lol
"Great company that’s showing competition fears were overblown. Disney is the only one remotely competing, I would not be surprised if more than one new entrants leave the industry entirely"
Looking at 600 tomorrow
"People can easily cancel (as they advertise) their account if no new contents/shows. Besides 1 in 6 of the people in U.S. had signed up (300 mil population vs. 55mil member) which means market is saturated (family with kids a/c, friends sharing...). I see this would collapse (again) if their contents budget is down or member not meet target. 1 Million missed last quarter says EVERYTHING."
NFLX will strike a deal for movies to be streamed live to your house instead of at movie theater.
OMG hope China US trade news comes out tomorrow morning. Any news showing progress in negotiations. You can expect Dow shooting up another 1000+ points.
Reed Hasting says explosive growth ahead.
"Ok with the fervor dying down a bit I’d like to re-ask my question from yesterday. Netflix has a massive debt load. Interest rates are going up. Has anyone looked into how this will impact their profits?Not trying to attack, just wondering.(And to head off the one response I got yesterday, I know they are saying they will not need to borrow new money. But they still have to deal with the debt they already have, and interest rates will not remain constant as debt is refinanced or as bond values go down.)"
I shorted 300 again at 322. Again 1200 short and My Average is $308 for short. Plan to cover 300 at 317.I decide to trade instead selling put because stock moving very fast and once I sell cover put can't do trading. I also hold couple $320 Calls with $1K premium. I am hoping it expire out of money. But May sell couple of put for those soon in order to limit my looses.
Sell before the big drop after hours.....$200's will be here soon.
Does anyone think this stock will do a 2 for 1 split soon?
400 by close >)
Selling 1st thing in the am. Then will buy back after it drops into the 230 Range
I'll probably go to cash as I have no idea on direction.
"10,000 calls, $550 strike expiring this Friday. Let's go !"
Staying short in this market is risky.

Still think I'm crazy when I said this is heading to 310?
Pump it up
Disney owns FOX and ABC. Go do your homework on all their content then come and tell me NFLX has a moat on original content
I love the fact the media is playing Netflix like it's the whole market.
Wonder who is propping up this stock
Why does the Head Case always yap about NFLX being lib? Who cares? I'm a Republican and I don't care. I just want NFLX to grow.

When you sell a covered call your giveaway is the strike price you sell the covered call + premium ( $100).I think the Jan 20 $400 calls sell for $65.Just google aapl options and look but make sure time frame and strike price is correct.The Nasdaq option chain is the easiest to read
"If Netflix want real growth they need to do something about the level of account sharing going on. My mom, dad, sister, brother and myself all share ONE netflix acct at 4 different houses."
Grab if before earnings if you can. I trust Netflix. They never overstate their subscribers growth im expecting a subscription growth on 6.7mil in total this Quarter.
They predicted beating last quarter up 143% from last year

What's the expectations of Netflix earnings?? Going to beat expectations?
"290 times earnings, lol! I certainly wouldn't short the stock, but I wouldn't buy it either!"
"My objective two cents on earnings:Content spend will be outrageously highSubs will be ,Price increase announcement was an attempt to neutralize content spend.Will it work? Who knows. We will find out Thursday but any stock that has increased 50% in a month is primed for a correction"
"You sell Netflix stock on two situations: Pay college debts or buy home; secondly, you are retired and need income to survive. In my own case, this is a keeper because of no college debts, own a home, still working, another good 20 years to retire!"
NFLX will lose the streaming war in US. Disney already dominates in India. China does not need low tech Netflix.Africa? get real.40% overvalued.
I have made thousands of option trades and i can honestly say there hasnever been a time where owning outs was orofitable for me but calls have profited nearly every single time $nflx $shop $nvda $mu

Wow...and to think Blockbuster could've bought them for 2 million way back when. Imagine that.
This could go UP 25 pts. after fed announcement today!
i have to now eat crow and tell my boss i was kidding about retiring.
Guess holding at 375 was a horrible move
"I shorted a decent amount of netflix at 380. is now a good time to buy it back? pretty decent profit , and they are a good company i don't want to be greedy. i am sure the large funds will start buying back soon and we will see a large increase.

Really an upgrade of whole $10 at level $400 that’s an upgrade of 2% makes all sense to buy it now
Down $25 in a month. Will be down $100 by June
"Throughout this month, a huge amount of money has entered the market. Popular stocks like NFLX are bought big time causing the parabola we are seeing in the price. Once the gotta buy syndrome ends, NFLX pulls back. Maybe to $230, where the breakout occurred."

Upgrade!GBH Insights raises its price target to $500 from $400 for Netflix shares.
just give up shorties. your lucky you pushed it down to mid 260s after their best earnings in history and overblown competition. pe is not a good measuring stick for a growth company. Netflix is still just that until proven otherwise
it will be in the 450s in July dont worry.
How much can this drop if earnings are bad ?
let's get back to US$400!
missed
is it going to 350 before the gain date
new low with a volume of 16M. no rebound anytime soon. take the profits and run...
Underestimating the size of the streaming market is the biggest mistake people make with Netflix.
Can we close at $375 today :) . Let's do this!!!
Don’t worry buy more. Netflix is the best with what they do.
Amazing job by the institutions today (controlled selling at its best).....after market this will drop $10-$20.
"As I wrote yesterday, we are due for a little counter-rally into the high $350s, then back down again. Nothing goes straight up or down. Smart moneywill be selling into rallies. Watch the volume because volume always speaks volumes. There is o justifying these valuations and as Morgan Stanley recently wrote, the party is over"
• Morgan Stanley raised its target price to $475 from $450. • J.P. Morgan raised its target price to $450 from $415. • Raymond James raised its target price to $435 from $400. • Canaccord Genuity raised its target price to $470 from $450.

"Anyone have a clue (news story, etc.) why NFLX has dropped nearly a percent in the few opening minutes of after hours trading?"
"Earning next week. While last 2 Quater history is on Long side, They have to remember stock more than double this year. This is not earning where investor will overlook any negative. Also those paid by Investor scheme can't sustain and reset required time to time.While Company sure going to add good number of subscriber as Many Cable provider now include with bundle, Paid by investor scheme used in larger scale & buzz is still out there on netflix. All those going to help.But most of subscriber it adding is lower quality subscriber including paid by investor + 125 millions subscriber has many different reason to leave including why just use one streaming service when you can rotate between them.Also marketing cost is keep going up and expect same.Content cost might much higher than expected based on recent Goldman Such analysis (Again you cant trust analyst, it's possible he has detail and it trying to pre announce in order to reduce hit on stock price when reality kick in)All of this thing + ever increasing content cost raise (Including paying millions for signup bonus) going to make financial worst ever.Market didn't care until now about it but might suddenly start caring with raising interest rate environment."
"Why is this going down? after reporting, will this be at 330 or 280?"
The Queen Gambit series added in my opinion a billion dollar value to the company
boy I hope you didn't short nflx
NFLX added 6 million NEW SUBSCRIBERS in Q2!!! Highest new subscription quarter EVER!!!
Analyst average Price target: $628.26Wall Street high price target: $850Netflix makes up 2.5% of my portfolio and will make up about 5% of my portfolio by end of February. This prices is a steal.
Wonder if signing pacts with Michelle Wolf and Obama has turned off a segment of viewers that normally would have signed up/stayed with Netflix. Saw the latest promo clip on ICE by Wolf and could see where her political controversies could hurt Netflix subscriber growth with Middle America.
DONT MISS THE EARNINGS RUN UP! THIS DIP IS SHAKING OFF PEOPLE

"Here is reason stock raise $10 for nearly flat market.After revisiting expectations for Netflix Inc.'s (NFLX) international subscriber growth, Pivotal Research analyst Jeffrey Wlodarczak upped his 12-month price target to $400 from $300. Shares of Netflix, after hitting a record close on Monday, were up more than 1% in early Tuesday trade. Wlodarczak increased his long-term international subscriber forecast, expecting the streaming giant to hit 250 million international subscribers by 2024, up from 230 million. In its most recent fourth-quarter earnings report, Netflix said it had 62.8 million international subscribers. ""The company appears to operate in a virtuous cycle, as the larger their subscriber base grows the more they can spend on original content, which increases the potential target market for their service and dramatically increases barriers to entry,"" Wlodarczak wrote in a note. ""All else being equal with the broader markets, as long as Netflix continues to beat and raise on subscribers we believe the stock will continue to work."" Wlodarczak also raised his long-term expectations on average revenue per user as Netflix displayed pricing power after its most recent price hike had little to no negative impact on subscriber growth. Shares of Netflix have gained 122% in the last 12 months, while the S&P 500 index is up roughly 15%.Here are red flags on his analysis:-This analyst see 250Million subscriber suddenly jump from already increase 230 Million count for no reason. Now from 67M to 250 Milion in 6 year, each year they need to add 30M+ subscriber. Now looking into US short history, This is unlikely. Remember Most english speaking developed Foreign country reaching saturation point. Non English speaking, There isn't much content and with licensing cost increases and focus on own content that gap will get wider not smaller.Now Value:- Clearly reaching 250M mean not much growth left. And then company likely issue $30B+ stocks over 6 year period. at current price that mean it will value at $160B + likely $20B debt so $180B enterprise value.with 250M international you will have 320M total (70M is beyond peak I think but just get over optimistic) $10M = $36B revenue, They likely spending $20B on content (Only way they can reach 320M subscriber is spend lot more on content) , $5B on marketing , $5B on servers and $2b-3B on other = $33BIn other word still generate $3B profit. Even if we raise subscription by 20% it still likely <$10B profit in 2024..If you give 20 PE and discount 35% (Growth rate), You still comeup with <$150 fair market price."
8 days was green now 8 days of red
One more big spike is coming in 10 minutes. Stay turned 345
can't stay on the green. not enough buyers
China deal
Buy now for $390+ open. Easy 10 points while you sleep!
"384 breakout today, surely big PT upgrades today after close or am tomorrow......slight pull back right now before going higher. 405-410 by end of next week. Probably 395 by EOB friday."
Thumbs down to Netflix price increases! I may have to drop it for awhile and try Hulu.
Support on Netflix looking good.
"Let's see, should I go to the doctor, be able to buy groceries, put gas in the car, or buy NFLX? Which one do I cut out of the family budget in a recession?"

"Holding up OK. Still quite buoyant. Rise NFLX, rise."
570 BY TOMORROW
This is starting to look like the same set up we got with micron technology. All analyst hyped up the stock and everyone got burned. I think the fix is in already. We may not get the jump like everyone is thinking. This does not look good. Big money may be shorting regardless of the ER report.
"Netflix and Wimi went up too much last week, and it's going to adjust this week."
DID YOU NOTICE THE GREEN MACHINE BROUGHT IT UP 4 POINTS. THEY WILL BRING IT TO 420 SOON!
"When it comes to Netflix and Disney, Disney has 5 times the revenue, 6 Tims the profit, but a lower market-cap. Think about that for a minute. If Netflix manages to continue beating estimates it will still take years to live up to it's ridiculous valuation. Even then there would have to be an absence of competition and a strong bull market just to keep this share price flat."
"dont understand, why down so much premarket?"
Let's hope for a $20 jump immediately after earnings and close :)
"Classic post yesterday, NFLX is down today AH too:""23 hours agoToday, Netflix held a long term support zone at $360. This is very bullish sign. Looks like we’re going up this week boys! """
Too many people buying put options expiring today. The machine keep it above $265 for maximum gain on the house.
"Don't recommend shorting when trading thins out, easier for them to push around. Shares need to be sold by golly and the price needs to be higher. All should give you pause, step gingerly."
Expected a better day for NFLX
Does today's dip in NFLX have anything to do with: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/deletenetflix-campaign-erupts-brazil-over-145803294.html
am I seeing +5% after hours?
"Success for a thirty year old is when they have their very own Netflix account with their own user name and password. As a measure of their success, they graciously allow their parents to use their password in order to watch a few #$%$ shows on Netflix.The problem with subscriber growth in the US is the whole shared password situation. The 50 million US subscribers probably represents 75 to 100 million households. If you're only watching one or two shows on Netflix, you're better off just borrowing someone else's password."
Thanks Tim Cook! Gonna buy big tomorrow on NFLX!
Can we see some green days plz....
Forward P/E of 60. Fair value is $75
Green on steep red markets. Not bad.
Next wave of subscriber growth coming with Netflix's big push into original movies.
Buy buy
Omfg  to $593 buyers
330 by Friday
I am not kind of worry about my 342.5 put. Yesterday I can't avoid thought and so decide to buy just 1. glad it's just 1 not 10.
no way it will ever see $400 again ...
Yahoo News VideoPelosi on the threat of violence to House members: ‘The enemy is within’ and it starts right with you Pelosi!!!
"I'm sure Buffett is looking at loading up on NFLX, it's P/E is only around 254! He knows a good deal when he sees one. And has said he likes to buy at a reasonable price. Not for the wide moat too! Bars open, drinks are on the house."
$593 or $560? Which one? Was $575 like a year ago. Nice “investment”.
"All of those who didn't buy on Friday, will be forever broke and not on the winner side.Take chances (which are legit) NFLX is going to skyrocket. again.$$$"

Skuba divers are having a field day this baby going to 340 today. Enjoy the fishies.
Wow..Whole thing was pumped up by analysts so they could sell their shares into strength. and then the shelf offering. the company and the street made out and retail suffers. Sad
I got out before earnings but I’m glad for those who held on. So many nflx haters eating their crow tonight. I love the company. I just was worried stock might sell off on earnings but looking back you knew sub number would be good based on what they said about queens gambit.
"My portfolio is now 35% $NFLX, 25% Nvidia, 15% Raytheon, and 25% Cash. What is everyone else’s portfolio? Please share."
Is it quite possible for this to sink to 230 this week?
"I recently canceled my Netflix subscription after many years. The content (to me) seems more geared toward a politically correct message than pure entertainment. It's not that I'm opposed to the messages, but I just don't find it entertaining to be preached to (hit over the head again and again) with what seems to be a SJW propaganda. I know this post will be deleted in about 15 minutes, so read it while you can."
"Anyone else who sees NFLX as a classic Bubble please comment on WHERE you believe were are in the process. I believe were are at the beginning of the ""return to normal"" phase. I am uncertain when NFLX will drop, but NFLX will certainly plummet. Right now I think under $100 by June 2019. I want to buy more puts on NFLX but am debating how far out to buy.???What are your thoughts???? Here is a very short article with the stock market bubble chart for reference:https://seekingalpha.com/article/4140975-investors-ignore-clear-sign-stock-market-bubble"
Tomorrow we will see 420.
"I bet a lot of NFLX shorts think that because of Disney’s projected 200 plus million subscribers over the next few years that they will eat NFLX’s lunch. That’s simply not the case. DIS and NFLX make very different shows and target different markets. There is a way the two can coexist without cutting each other’s throats. As long as NFLX continues to make shows like The Queen’s Gambit their subscriber numbers won’t shrink. Long term I am bullish on both DIS and NFLX and believe the two can coexist in the same way Coke and Pepsi, Square and PayPal, Domino’s and Papa John’s, all can. Competition doesn’t have to erode business when there are only a few players. Own both. I see so many people bashing DIS in this discussion and vice versa in the DIS discussion it makes no sense. Two money makers are better than one. GLTA."
"Longs need to defend $560. Once that level is breached, it will drop straight to $525 or $535."
Walmart’s entry into streaming will crush NFLX as it will under cut prices and quickly gain the middle to lower end of users who are price sensitive. NFLX is built on house of cards with negative cash flow and loaded with debt and burning what cash it has.
"As I said, wait on market down days to get in low 500s. Market in general is going crazy. be careful."
"Unbelievable it holds over $330, honestly it should of drop to bellow $200 by now."
"For the last six days, we have gone back and forth between green and red.only problem being the RED days have been bigger.. In total we are down 19.05 Since Nov. 30.We did nave a nice comeback from being down 4.53.Now let's just see if we can go green back to back for the 1st time this month."
Could be wrong but I think this may have finally bottomed out. If you sold it may be a good time to buy back in. Just where my thought process is at
What an amazing range today. casino royal..
What happens when the bell rings? It can't stay here?!
"Took a pure gamble 10/30 $490 put... I hope people realize that this company is over valued. $10,000 gamble. I hope it does well."

"Don't underestimate NFLX growth power.Historically copycats seldom succeed through merger/acquisition.I don't think DISNEY's buyout of FOX can beat NFLX, a media disruptor!"
Could we see this week 350
"I think this will go back up, prob a good opportunity to buy at the dip."
I love Netflix that’s all
I laugh at this stock price every time I see it. I like Netflicks but ATT and Disney are going to crush them! Netflicks is borrowing more money than the y make to produce quality shows which makes them technically unprofitable. They will never turn a profit until that can significantly raise their monthly fee. I suspect the6 are going to soon see a significant drop off of there new subscribers which will be the end of there stock valuation. Tic toc remember AOL etc
"Disney will rule and be a 1T Market Cap in a few. NFLX has some good competition in Disney,too big IMO."
Bought at 494$  Expecting to hit 530$ next week
Sometimes you think you reached a floor and then you fall through. That’s what is happening. NFLX should test 350’s again real soon.
I don't think I've every been so pleased to be down 5%.
The last time they hike price in 2011 and next quarter they lowered the guidance and stock dropped 10%
Are you shmucks that were posting $280 still out there?
This ALWAYS ends the same way! higher it goes the bigger the drop! looking like the next AMD. Prefect earnings priced in shorts tapped out for the most part. ITS GOING TO SINK. just a matter of time
"will have the biggest one day gain since 2008. $qqq , $nflx, $amzn ,$ appl"
"I know I missed the great run up in the stock the last few years, but I couldn’t resist any longer and bought in at $318. Hopefully Netflix will double by this time next year!Congrats to all the longs who have been in this stock the last few years!"
same thing amazon prime hbo disney NETFLIX DOMINATES all other ones wait when they get india
TOO BIG TO FALL.
Business insider: Disney and Netflix to partner up for world wide streaming.
"Netflix saves lives, taking cars off the road and giving blockbuster amounts of accommodation back to the people. LONG."
I don’t predict prices but TA suggests support @316.49. If it goes below that 297 is the next target
I'm sure by the end of the year it will be 500 I'm not worried.
"Upgrades this morning, fasten your seatbelts the rocket ship is going to be a bit rocky"
NFLX has a long road ahead to correct how Disney just leap over them.
yesssssssss 370 touched
"Heard there is a caravan headed towards the US, the people have been promised nflx."

Hold on. Look good. Short-term fluctuations are just that. $NFLX $NVDA $WIMI
It is a fine share and it is a joke if u sell this
guys. Any ideas? I should have sell it on 388 yesterday i guess. Hold or what?
I just canceled Netflix.
up after hours! 53 cents!
320 before closing 
"Watch this snap green at open. Possible treatment is good, but doesnt cure the massive Q2 losses everyone but the stay at home equities are going to bring. Suspending guidance is a bandaid on a bullet wound."
"3 More weeks untill next earnings. Very curious what it will be, can't wait."
Should i sell for 500 dollar on friday or wait for it to become 600 next month?
Who is buying?
"NFLX surging, congrats Longs!!!"
"I hate to do it but I shorted this stock today and will make some cheese tomorrow, not a fan of shorting but its all about making money, this company will be fine and will crush in the future, but I sure I am glad it’s getting crushed tomorrow."
market is rigged. They try to pump this stock up even after $2B debt notes. Unbelievable sheet.

Netflix Expected to Spend as Much as $15 Billion on Content This YearThat makes last year's $12 billion look like chump change.
"lol, people who panic never prosper."
Who bought $593 after fake earnings
I’m going to start calling on some of my banks friends to start loading up. It’s going to all time high no questions ask
"Barron's article says Netflix is paying 6.375% interest rate. ""Since 2017, the cost of debt has risen 275 basis point to 6.375%. Should debt investors grow more weary of Netflix’s massive cash burn, the liquidity they’ve provided could dry up quickly. See Appendix II for more details."":::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::Try buying something at 6.375% interest rates.It is burdensome. Soon they will paying interest on the interest. I think this is a major issue. Why can't they sell some bonds fro 2% or whatever? Maybe because their company is too risky. That one point is making me lean toward the Barron's article. https://www.barrons.com/articles/why-netflix-shares-will-plummet-fund-manager-51556731141"
just bought a load at 270. Will wait before next quarterly results.
NFLX is up over $ 9.00 per share in pre-market on an analyst upgrade!!!
In at 332 2 years ago ty selling half at double
It’s a good moment to buy 50 shares of NFLX?
Why nobody mentions the fact that $NFLX Earnings are TANKING BIG TIME????
"Great to have picked up some cheap shares today, will be worth north of 320 in 2 weeks after earnings report."
337+ by close of day.
"Netflix saw a significant decrease in short interest in the month of December. As of December 31st, there was short interest totalling 13,853,134 shares, a decrease of 16.5% from the December 14th total of 16,593,567 shares. Approximately 3.3% of the shares of the company are sold short. Based on an average daily volume of 13,284,425 shares, the short-interest ratio is presently 1.0 days.— markebeat"
"I should know this, but for tax purposes is a stock transaction based on initiation date or settlement date? If it's settlement date wouldn't a transaction initiated today settle next week?"
"Maybe Netflix can prove us all wrong with their numbers but I think most people know that increased competition leads to lower margins/slowing revenue growth. That’s just the nature of consumers having more than one option. At this point, I think it’s a matter of how much the competition hurts Netflix rather than a matter of IF"
Netflix had a blockbuster quarter for new content releases. We should see a spike in cord cutting when cable companies report in January.
Looks like someone wanted out so they Bid it up and dumped... hmmm. Not a lot of volume so not a big deal yet. $PDD $WIMI $NFLX
Plenty of room for 3-4 streaming services each household.
"IQiyi has over $4 Billion in annual revenues.Global growth company.#1 Streaming company in China.So many revenue streams unlike $NFLX. $ROKU holders may be interested also.- 100M+ Paid subscribers- 400M+ Ad supported- gaming with Skymoons- IQiyi Sports- Content distribution- Settop box- 37,000 video screens In Shanghai subway stations- Streaming deal with New Zealand Airline- VR movie deal with hotels- Membership deal with JD.com- VIP deal with Ctrip.com- Licensing deal with Netflix- Licensing deal with NickelodeonMore"
WHY DOES IT FALL APART FOR KNOW REASON!
"The stocks move up the past three weeks is a nightmare for longs whether they know it or not. With this terrible earnings report (make no mistake, it was atrocious and they decreased expectations for next year on top of that) the stock has nothing but air underneath its current price, it will have very little resistance on the way down. $100 drop coming over the next few weeks, most likely more. The bubble created by 8 years of 0% interest rates has popped. The sooner people realize this, the way better off you’ll be. Flash crashes happened in China yesterday, some stocks down 80 plus percent in a few hours. Won’t be long til that happens to our equity market"
I'm out with solid gain
Should test 305 on the open monday
Selloff likely related to options expiration on Friday. I bet we see 52-week highs this week.
320 next is 330
"Now that the cities are opening back up, how is this stock going to sustain in Q2? Tesla, Amazon, Apple, Twitter, and other tech stocks are all going down after earning announcements. 30+ mil people are unemployed and many are scared for their jobs. How many people will be spending tons of money on non-essential stuff in Q2? Sales and profits are going to drop!!!!!"
The CEO states the obvious. No sheet your business model is in trouble. Huge debt + rising costs + declining subscribers + strong competition = bankrupt nflx
2 mil more subs than expectations for 14% up ???
353. now.. back to 11% down . ppl will keep buying. will recover.
"Wolf responds on Twitter , he and I have a BETHe is screaming $20 end of 2020I’ve got $8You can BET right now $2.54Wolf made $40,000 into 10 MILLION in five yearsI did #GrandSlam 4 bagger $NBEV in a month$TGODF will be #MyLegacy in 2025 creating more millionaires than $AMZN or $NFLX or $TSLA"
"Almost 15% seems to be a ridiculous drop, but markets don't always act rationally so will let it settle out before buying."
Lots of volume after hours. Over 1.5 million shares just with blocks over 10k in 35 minutes.
80% chance Apple and Amzn will buy all companies in the world in 2020 and our world will be renamed as Amazon Apple from Earth.
$520 looks like a good entry point. I don't think you would lose money if you bought in the last couple days. But you would have to hold it for a while.
Does anyone know for sure if under the Historical Data tab in Yahoo Finance and the last column labeled as Volume for daily volume is expressed in Shares or Dollars?
good luck to all regardless of what happens. play safely.
"There are a few real bad pumpers on thhis site that people need to be aware of. They will tell you that NFLX has no competition and will rule the streaming world. APPLE has recently announced deals with some powerful hollywood types like Oprah Winfrey, Octavia Spencer, Reese Witherspoon, Jennifer Aniston, Steven Spielberg, Francis Lawrence, Damien Chazelle, M. Night Shyamalan and Kristen Wiig. They will be a major competitor. So will AMZN and DIS. Beware of the paid pumpers on here."
What you all think will it best earnings? And stock will jump?
This will run up at end of day... start to pre earnings run up!
This is one of the more popular stocks that actually will grow. I bet it reaches 400 in the next year. Pay no attention to lowering of Target prices...
‘Vikings: Valhalla’: Netflix Orders ‘Vikings’ Sequel Series From Michael Hirsthttps://deadline.com/2019/11/vikings-valhalla-netflix-vikings-sequel-series-michael-hirst-jeb-stuart-mgm-tv-1202789898/
Why such a huge drop today? Do people really not like the new netflix films?
So the price increase sounds like a response to an earnings miss.
"I got ""thumbs down"" yesterday for my comment after-hours that Netflix would finish today between $360 and $370 today. I still stand by my comment. A lot of ""big money"" investors are using the pull back as an opportunity to buy more and average down the cost of their position. Others are using this as an opportunity to enter this stock. How many people do you think are willing to take the the bet that Netflix won't hit at least $400/share by next earnings release?"
600$ soon! Great company!
I advise any long to book some profit today. Even after analyst pumping so much end of last week. It fail to hold 315+ that clearly mean big player selling before earning. This prove my theory that it's help that Analyst provide so Big player can exit with profit.Now slight only beat or slight miss can bring this stock to 250 easily. They have to beat big time in order to justify such inflated prices. Analyst and big player know that. There is very limited up side incase they beat big time but downside risk start even with slight beat.
"Before Apple can win competing against Netflix they have to win against Hulu, Amazon and HBO who all have much more content than Apple."
"Again, good buy in low 500s in market down days"
A fair value for this would be around $180-$200 per share. Don't buy until then.
LET ME JUST SAY ONE THING......... ha ha
"Seems like NFLX will hit that new target of $490 before the end of Summer, my question to ths group is, at that level, the stock is very close to $500, and wouldn’t it be time for another stock split?"
If it hit's 595 I'm topping off my short for some serious gains tomorrow so I can cover at 550's I mean who the heck is buying still at this range? I know true investors will dislike but us who day trade and swing trade follow if you want to make easy fast money. I'm sure it will come back to this price range later this year but man way too high to try to maintain short term
When is Ozarks 4 being releases
Definitely selling tomorrow 9:30am sharp.
Oh my god I love Netflix
Very rich valuation
If I had to choose to go all in on one company it most likely would be $WIMI $NFLX $FB
https://finance.yahoo.com/m/a91898eb-389e-37dc-a602-3e1b9b82b686/netflix-is-ditching.htmlJust read the comments before buying stock
Buy as much as you can
"I watched a few things on Netflix over the weekend. They offered subtitles in at least 15 different languages. They had a good movie subtitled in Korean, I watched a standup comic from Morocco, the one that followed was another stand-up comedian from another country and the entire standup was subtitled (I only watched the trailer, but the translation wasn't lost in the comedy), watched a biopic and a streaming series. In short, Netflix is blowing up internationally."
tomorrow's call is going to be epic lol 2000% up?
Analyst would be revising their price targets upwards with the huge subscriber growth. Nextflix global market still has much room to grow. I myself subcribed to Netfix in March last year when the pandemic striked and continue to see myself as a subcriber even after the pandemic.
Stranger Things Season 3 sets breaks viewing record.
Will hit 350 tomorrow
"In a day when it opens at least +6 and the high reaches at least +14, NFLX has never ended the day at less than +5.75"
When Apple announce iphone prices that keep going up. Everyone celebrate. But what is outcome? Apple lose 50% sale in India and 30%+ sell in China. Two most important market for growth that also very price sensitive.
"So many trolls angry at Netflix bc of the Obama’s producing a few shows. Hey snowflakes, ever heard of the concept of not watching those shows? I’m sure there are conservative talk show hosts on SiriusXM radio. You don’t see me cancelling my subscription. I just....repeat after me....don’t listen to those channels."
When everyone is selling.. I buy 
"11months ago it was noted here that for the cost of 1share of nflx you could have purchased 1share each of dis, vz, fb. You'd be up 27% and have received $4.22 in dividends. With competition, no longer a unicorn."
"The only folks predicting prices are shorts and analysts. Read the analyst reports. I prefer the analysts This stock is valued on the expectation of sub growth GLOBALLY and content production. That’s it. The company can make headway for a while...2 or 3 more years. Even if there is a little pullback, the subs will stick. Company is changing the content delivery business and is way ahead of the competition. Watch for other catalysts like gaming, premium tiers, price increase and an ad platform. Then maybe a merger because it’s to big to be acquired. I’m not predicting prices, judy enjoying the ride."
Bank of America gets even more bullish on Netflix: 'Still more upside for the new king of all media'
"$TSLA $NVDA $FB $NFLX , these are heavy volumes on the downside. Pretty scary."
"These post are supposed to be about stocks and making money which is green, not a political agenda."
10 MINUTES TO THE CRASH!!!!!!!!!
HBO Max is so much betterthan Netflix. No comparison whatsoever. Every title downloadable. I have had Netflix forFREE for at least 2.5 years.Why is the stock SO BLOATED?
"All the shorts seem sure of themselves on this... Be careful, they were sure on BYND and ROKU as well, suffered badly for it."
Then next quarter Netflix will announce that they lost 8 of the 8.5 million subscribers which they added this quarter and the stock will take a 20% nose dive. I'm so sick of this stock going up & down like a Yo-Yo. That's why I took it out of all of my clients' portfolios.
"Heard every opinion out there on earnings. I’m leaning towards the price hike is cause earnings report is huge. Supposedly 2019 is going to be tougher on everyone and the competition coming out, they can raise prices because numbers are BIG. Raise prices on a miss with earnings? No"
"Read my previous update. Compare this with Goldman just put out. Goldman Sachs added Netflix to its ""conviction buy"" list, calling it ""one of the best risk/reward propositions in the Internet sector."" Goldman also said, ""We continue to believe Netflix's investment in content, technology and distribution will continue to drive subscriber growth well above consensus expectations both in the U.S. and internationally."""
looks like a technical bearish double top.
Monday should recover?
All the good articles coming out now! here we freaking go!! Calls are going to print
selling half at 664 which means i doubled and holding the rest for 5 more years cheers
This has been the most rewarding turnaround I've experience this year. Up $40 in a couple hours. Go go go NFLX and thank you!
Now Buy it up.... this was a nice wreck...
keep feeding the bubble
This is beginning to look like its being wslked down slowly. Time will tell. In the mean time GLTA.
Sorry for those who got fooled prior to xmas and sold out or shorted. Time to short will arrive soon but wait a little more.
"For highflier stocks, missing ESTIMATEs and guiding downside is huge issue.See you $310 soon!"
in 2015 shares were 700 before the 7 to 1 split. I noticed news media is not meeting this. so technically the stock is higher than amazon around well over $2800 a share since 2015. I'm still skeptical as to why everyone is downing the stock is there a catch....
Lets keep going NFLX dont give up those gains!!!! Yesss!!
"Price Target is US$420 by the end of the month, when the ""disappointed"" feeling pass this week, everybody will jump again and realize that NFLX is growing in content and production (112 Emmy nominations) - Netflix plans to spend between $12 and $13 billion this year on original programming while HBO’s budget was a thrifty $2.5 billion by comparison!"
The House of Mouse is comin for ya..
There IS NO CONTROLLED selling going on folks... No crash coming... No sell off coming... NFLX is one of the top 3 most widely held securities in 100's of millions of peoples 401k's... Everyone just chill!
Final melt up before the big correction!
Today will rise $GOOG $NFLX $WIMI
Why value investing?Because you can not only make money but also sleep well and eat well $AMZN $WIMI $NFLX
"Well, the 370 mark has been broken.For the 1st time in 8 tries, it closed over 370 when the open was over 370. Could not close over 380, but close. Best close since the day after earning, July 17, 379.48.... Next few weeks should be interesting. Does it go back to 400 or down to 350?"
Thankfully I got the dip.
The prodigious market cap is making me believe the stock market as a whole currently has a specious valuation
Under Trump MAGA this stock will see 800/share
"Why hasn't HBO, Showtime, Max etc, etc..... Taken Netflix out?? New streaming options are no different. People will carry Netflix plus multiple other options,,,,,, If anything they will cxl the HBO'S AND SHOWTIMES of the world before Netflix.... Can't wait til earning!! 410+"
NFLX--among the worst stocks you should hold: upside is thin;while downside is huge'Sell any rally!
"2021 movie lineup on Netflix, it is going to be awesome year guys!"
will go up 25 dollars tomorrow
"As Netflix goes for mobil push, it will open up markets that traditionally is not able to tap. These markets are primarily in Asia and Africa where mobile use is the greatest. Pushing mobile also lowers cost of entry for must people in that region. This market is huge and only Netflix can tap into it due to its size"
$500 soon. Sleep on that!!
Why is Nflx down in the after market?
"Looks like the 'cuties' controversy has passed. Americans are so over-reactionary. I only saw clips, and if anything, I'd say it did a public service by making parents aware of what some of their innocent little tweens are actually doing online."
Tough to call. $4 up or down before the numbers doesn’t mean much for this one
NFLX is up 12.13% to 255.19
What’s a better buy? Fb or Nflx?
I'm a buyer at 275.
Wow no one buying I cover half of my new short (300) at 317 as I was hoping over excited people will buy dip.Comeon buy with both hands. This should only go Up regardless what happen to market.... Where are you guys? If you don't know you can do trading in after hours. I need to short again at 320.
Wow TSLA down 17.58
"I see resistance at 454.00, oh well. We’ll get there in August."
Netflix has to be undervalued. It continues to make new highs while the market has been in a correction for most of 2018.
"50 point bump up over next 2-days. Screen capture ~ save it, let that sink in."
should I short ntfx or wait till tomorrow
"All up from here, $500 soon"
SELL your Apple stock and BUY more NETFLIX! Makes sense?!
"The shortfall in subscribers in Q2 was primarily due to the World Cup, so the pullback just offers an excellent buying opportunity."
"we seem to all be hoping for a great earnings report, I have some worry but I hope it will be great. 26 more hours till earnings report good luck."
when announce pialways shoots upthen crashes back
"I think people are forgetting the fact that Netflix was doing fine before COVID, this was just a boost. Overall still a great company, if you think otherwise why waste your time posting negative comments"
I am surprised that there is no post claiming we are heading back to $400.
I have options $350 strike January 2020 --- Should I sell or hold off until it strikes? I think $350 and over coming soon :) I'll just keep it for a little while longer. YAAAA $NFLX
CMCSA and DIS are creating a lot of wealth for us. These 2 nutty companies are bidding so much for FOXA that whoever WINS this crazy 'war' will be in such debt that neither company will be able to make the necessary investments to compete. The Street realizes this and just look how NFLX has appreciated during these crazy negotiations of CMCSA and DIS. One thing for sure: IF I OWNED ONE OF THESE CRAZY COMPANIES (CMCSA OR DIS) I WOULD BE SELLING MY ENTIRE POSITION. NFLX is the one to play here.
incredible beat. superb earnings report
green by days end?
Grats to anyone who sold this stock. You will regret it after this month...
This sell off is ridiculous
Going to be a great day 360.00 closing GREEN
Only company in the world that beats earnings estimates by 30% and loses 13% valuation in 2 days. Something massively wrong with that.
"What’s stated on this board has no influence, just fun, to let off steam, release the pressure valve. It’can be informative at times and give you the psychological pulse of the retail investor, but like I read 60% of NFLX shares are held by institutions."
"The momentum reversal is confirmed. Technical support is breaking down. Filling the gap back to 163.22. Bot algos will start to trigger more selling. Then moving down to low 140s. MMs are working hard to keep things orderly and preventing a pps collapse. The only reason that they can is because 90% of the float is held by institutions, hedgies, and insiders, They do not want to #$%$ the market by aggressive selling instead have been slowly decreasing their nflx holdings, booking profits and positioning to profit from the downward momentum. While Goldman and their ilk continue to pump, blow smoke, mislead, and deceive. But the cat is out of the bag now. The constant reiterations of the shills, hawkers, and pumpers are not very convincing anymore. They benefit of the doubt is gone. The growing closer scrutiny, evaluation, analysis, number crunching, realistic projections from numerous diverse unbiased credible sources all agree that nflx pps present absurd extreme over valuation is unjustifiable . The hand writing is on the wall and the wall is crumbling. Greed is turning into fear. Short interest remains low but congregating on the sidelines cautiously waiting to pounce. Technical support eroding. Momentum reversing. The zealots who remain blind to these facts are putting any paper profits or real principle investment at great risk. There are so many less risky good investment opportunities for the individual investor."
Back to $360 tomorrow it looks good
Dead cat bounce.
"Bohemian Rhapsody, dead pool, Glass. AVATAR 2-5(COMING) This is Disney content. They bought 21st century fox to put a strong hold on content. Then you got bird box...."
Stock split ??
"You can’t talk about the entertainment industry without bringing up streaming service Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX).Historically NFLX stock has been an expensive play, but a worthwhile investment because the firm’s position at the top of the streaming space looked very solid. However, recently Netflix has seen a major pullback as investors started to worry about rising competition.In just two months, NFLX stock has seen its share price fall nearly 20% after the company’s second-quarter results underwhelmed the market. To be sure, Netflix isn’t flying as high as it once was, but the firm’s commitment to creating quality content is likely to keep the service from succumbing to the increasing competition in the streaming space. Plus, although NFLX is nearing saturation in the U.S., the firm still has a huge growth opportunity in India, where its content has been well-received so far. So, while the Q2 results were admittedly disappointing, this pullback in NFLX stock makes for a buying opportunity."

Seeing how Disney has run since it announced streaming focus what do you guys think about att for a trade as it switches over to streaming with times Warner. I know att is kind of a dinosaur but I could see it moving up maybe 15-25% on hype related to this news.
"Just bought another 300 shares, this will climb the rest of the week forsure"

good entry point.
nflx must has a lot of customers and a lot profit these times because almost all europe has quarantined last weeks. So i think earnings will beat the expectations.
"Netflix current technicals. OBV good across all time frames from 5-minute thru the dailies. RSI not overcooked. Oh yeah, my buy stop hit a few minutes ago @ 533.70"

Green today? What a crazy stock. You gotta love it. Daytraders dream. Long are in for a scare now and then but.. haha
Peter Dowling adding to his position.We should see $575 very soon.
Surprised that Netflix didn’t take a huge hit today because of Disney and is actually green why?? More competition the better? Someone please explain.....
netflix production in japan and taiwan and many asian countries are incredible.. that's where the growth is
"Love the three dollar run up at the open, and then they open up the trap door."
"This is up almost 90 points in two weeks. Well done longs, that is incredible. Only in America! Belongs to be trading near $240-250 max but hey in due time....VA"
"Not even up to 1B paying subscriber base yet, it’s mind boggling to think of fast the adoption is. NFLX is almost a must and will be a must in every house hold. Monster Buy"
"OK, it's down 3 days in a row. Down $36 or 9.1% based on the lower sub growth. Right now, it's hard to imagine this ever going up again. You can picture another big down day tomorrow, with traders wanting to get out of their positions before the weekend. There is new competition coming, negative cash flow that's ongoing, and a bloated PE that's hard to justify. On the other hand, I've thought that same way many times in the past, and somehow this thing always turns around and powers to new highs. This is the most loved stock I've ever experienced and I'm betting it turns around and eventually gets back to $400. I know that sounds crazy right here and some day this has to turn down and return to a ""normal"" PE. But I'm betting this has one more run up before that happens. I admit I may be wrong but I have history on my side."
"Well, it went up roughly $80.00 on good subscription news, and lost $50.00 of that, on NO news. Granted the market is down, but ROKU seems to be doing just fine, up over $10.00"
Bullish engulfing pattern AND a strong move off the 50% retracement level? Ooooo...shorts better cover while you can.
I bought them at 369 and I am long term holder. This is going down every single day. Any thoughts why?

"every year this happens - everybody hates NFLX and then when it drops to below 260; people back up to truck to a run to 360+. it is all gibberish about the other streaming stuff; NFLX thrives on its own content and competition from other services will have no impact on the growth of NFLX. people are not going to give up or take dis, hulu, etc. over NFLX. they will simply be additions to NFLX. This stock is about to be a screaming buy opportunity very very soon."
Any bets on NFLX being up over $600 tomorrow?
"If it's not a day to sell, I don't knock what it is"
"No more subscriber growth, hence they have to raise price. Lots of other companies moving into this space. Netflix = next AOL"
Who would have thought that Netflix would lose subscribers aftter paying $$ millions to the Obama's with the following special documentaries coming out: 1) How to become President from only being a community organizer 2) How I learned to hate America and the military and love Fidel Castro 3) Just give socialism a chance 4) How to keep your present medical plan 5) How to double or triple the U.S. deficit 6) How to keep your present doctor 7) Why Michelle and I don't care about BLM (because we're filthy rich now and wouldn't live in Chicago if you paid millions more to us). These are just some of the upcoming special documentaries coming up on Netflix. Join up now to make sure can stream these fascinating insights into the Obama legacy.
"If everyone pulls their content from Netflix and you were left with only Netflix originals, they would only have 37% of the streaming time they have now. How can investors think that Netflix originals will keep this stock afloat? It makes absolutely no sense. Netflix needs borrowed content to survive, and the best borrowed content is leaving. Period."
"Trump, Economic Adviser Resigning.Tomorrow Market will Sell, Sell, SellThen... You Buy, Buy, Buy"
Barely makes targets and stock goes up 10%. Talk about delusions!Next qtr's numbers are being goosed by the increased prices but for how long!

The greatest stock comeback in history right here. Unshortable.
What do I do tomorrow morning ??? I will BUY more !! Thanks for cheap shares. LONG TERM HOLDER.
How do you know if your a SHORT Johnson?? You bet against World Class Companies!! Congrats SHORTS!! Wrong Again!!!
"A hugely over-priced stock...and the fact that they're considering share buy-backs is insane!....they're barely cash flow positive as it is....they should be doing the exact opposite, SELLING shares at these lofty prices and using the money to fight off increasing competition.....the outdated ""maximizing shareholder value"" mantra comes a cropper eventually, just look at GE and Boeing."

NFLX is pure gamble.
"BioHarvest Sciences Inc. Announces a Major Breakthrough in the Growth of Cannabis TRICHOMES across Multiple Strains in Liquid Media17 patents filed to date, 11 patents granted in 5 different jurisdictions"
Honestly what’s so great about Netflix? Most of there content you can find online for free or on demand. And they haven’t really had many new reuses of late. I only keep it due to Stranger Things and 2 other titles.
$132B Market Cap. PE 200+ and they have to finance $1.5B debt? Red flags all over the place. When a company like this is operating a light speed and cannot pay off debt from over inflated stock valuation - run and run fast.

"Once Apple and Disney get there act together in NFLX's space, NFLX has to move down to the $185.00 range. Its just common sense. The quesiton is when?"
I predict a near identical daily chart today as compared to yesterday. Flat to down by EOD.
Isn't it amazing how buyers show up all at once?
 we are closing at 375 today. Gj ppl with strong hearts
Hoping 392 by Friday

"Sold my small position, are better stocks in place to make money"
LOOK AT NFLX GO!!!
360 tomorrow ?
"NFLX has no moat! Really? $13 billion in original content and 122 Emmy nominations will be put together by a Walmart! Really, Disney is going to Mickey Mouse a challenge? Comcast - ever dealt with their customer service! The only true challenge is Amazon but it is too distracted and holds a fraction of viewership. NFLX is light years ahead of any competition and it simply needs to execute - in Reed Hasting’s astute leadership, NFLX will continue to flourish."
How do you buy after close?
Today was a good day to start buying some Puts. On a positive note Bord Box was a pretty good movie. Happy New Year yall

I wouldn’t be surprised if it gaps up $5-$10 tomorrow.
Netflix has captured the melennials and once they start going to work so does their Netflix subscription. That’s 78 million folks!
Ozark is coming
When will the next squeeze come in? It should be soon
Single biggest indicator that Netflix will hit it out of the park on Monday is their Q2 guidance for 6.2 million subscriber adds. The previous high for a Q2 guide was 3.2 million. They really didn't need to guide that high unless subscriber adds were going through the roof.
Recently sold all my Netflix shares because this stock can correct all the way to 150; this period reminds me of 1999 where stocks like Cisco and sun Microsystems disappeared and investors lost 90 percent of their money
we gonna copy Amazon tomorrow.
SHORTS DESTROYED. 
Perfect buy point
Here is my attempt to interpret CEO message saying next 100M from India. Is he trying to say Development phase countries like India? If so does that mean all developed market not much growth left and so Next 100M subscriber will mostly come from developing country. If so Netflix sure headed for temporary slowdown on subscriber growth for sure. There is no way developing countries can afford $10/year subscriptions and so no way those 100M can come in next 4-5 year. it will take way longer like 15 year.
If a big buyer steps in tomorrow shorts might lose 10% in 2 days :O
"MANIPULATEDI guess you just go long when they turn on the BOTSRIMM was manipulated like this. Went to 148 or whatever, then down to $3 or whatever it was. You get my point.They turned on BOTS and the excuse is, the market sold off, so it was a buying opportunity. They make shorts cover, they get retail to buy, ....It's manipulated. It just went from 283 to 301. That's 8.3 Billion dollars in market cap with no news, nothing. They made 0.58 billion in one year. 14.3 ratio. Wall Street made 14.3 times as much today off trading NFLX than NFLX made in a year. That's how I see it. I think the folks at the SEC needs to be thrown in a dumpster and replaced by someone that wants to act like the Securities Exchange Commission. The big trading firms get to see your bids and asks before they are posted. Why? I emailed them. ""It's not their responsibility"". I know they get to see the bids and asks before the exchange posts them. I was told by a programmer about that. And I see it when I put in a bid or ask. ""Someone"" jumps in front of my trade. Bullsheet, let them get in line. They can jump behind my bid or ask. They call it ""high frequency trading"". I would like to see a $100 billion lawsuit, taking back some of the money they stole, which is probably a lot more than that. It's like the Government is helping them steal. It has been going on since 1999 at least. That's a lot of money to stolen.just my opinion, check the data yourself"

Companies like Tesla will loose, there is literally nobody buying Tesla car.

Don’t invest in stocks that will crash after their earnings.$TSLA$NFLX"
"This stick has been a joke for years, not even worth $100. Disney would never pay more than $50 a share in an acquisition, and even that's a lot now that it isn't growing. They should wait for $20 a share"
Drops like a rock despite being more popular in the UK. Even families that have no money to go on vacation due to the market crash are likely to keep their Netflix subscription than even cable...
A lot of time I feel like I am all powerful and only I can save the market.How? I simply sell my shares. And stock is guaranteed to instantly go up after that.
going to 300 tommorow
"Bottom here, never will you see this price again"

But what if it were trading at a more fair value like $130 per share or maybe a quarter of where it is, under $80then the market cap would be around $32B and their debt would ratio would be substantially more as a percentage. I'm saying the debt doesn't look as bad as it really is, since the price has been pushed to the moon. Time for a major correction in NFLXMaybe AMZN will join it.OF the FANGs, I feel Apple and NVDA are not so high in terms of their PEs."
Did you guys find odd that Eric Sheridan was the only analyst asking questions during the EQ after his staged upgrade a week ago?
Red Monday too...count on it.
You guys were right! 280!

Apple not buying....I know there has been speculation they might.

Fed Raises Interest Rates and Signals Additional Increase in 2018... Sell
I wish i had bought this stock back in jan
I love Netflix never had a problem with them.
Every time we clear 370 massive selling comes in. Have to take out the seller and close over 375. I wouldn’t be surprise if we make another run today and/or tomorrow.
Still no buying offers at $450.00.

"An article will appear in 2028 July 15th on CNBC, it would say - do you know how much you would have made, had you invested 2000 $ in nflx 10 years ago?. And the article will conclude that you would have made 100k"
"if it turns green today, that will be a big plus."
"Would be nice to see NFLX punch pass the 52 week high. I’m liking my ‘NAN’ stocks (NVDA, AMZN, NFLX) a lot. Long term buy and hold, true legacy stocks."
The negative ripple effects from NFLX to my healthy tech positions Rob Arnott is predicting seems unfair to us real investors
netflix has a stockpile of cash in hand they cannot lose. if they see a decrease in income they can reduce the number of shows they produce and save millions. the big funds manipulate this stock with news but long run it's gonna be a great stock. if there's no minus in front if eps it's a winner
"I think today I have been convinced that we are going back to 350. This is just a slow drip at this point. All of us in above 400 will have the problem of people selling when they make a good profit. This have us locked in for while. I don't think I will hold through another ER report again, not worth the risk."
Amazing day- where all others are deep red or flat NFLX gains ~4%
My tech portfolio hasn’t suffered like this since 2008 crash.
Going up due to more lockdowns being initiated around the world. Netflix is the King.

Nice to see this finally having a decent day. Hopefully Amazon will be next. I did sell some more nflx because I just don’t trust the market right now. Will keep a core position.
Bought a few shares in AH yesterday at 345 and change. Just sold for 379 and change. Not a bad percentage gain for an 18 hour hold (I'm here to tell ya)!!!
"Shorts are in big trouble tomorrow, 52 week high by Friday. $537 now."
volume is shot. largest open contracts again point to 550 strike for friday. VIX is poking it's head out. Exit now and enter back in 1-2 weeks later and catch the bounce look for as close to 500 but 520's might also be decent entry
Today’s note from Goldman Sachs should provide a boost today. Would be nice to finally see $390+
Holy had to triple check
this is gonna drop imo

"This company is in so much trouble. They badly need a new CEO. The current guy has no clue how to run a company when there is actual competition. Netflix has been making the service and shows worse while hiking the prices. It's like they've taken a page right out of big cable cos playbook. And how is that working for them? I figured Netflix would start losing US subscribers, but I didn't think it would happen immediately.And after a disastrous quarter, the CEO blames analysts for bad projections? So it is good to be losing US subscribers? Face it, the CEO is doing absolutely everything wrong. He wanted to be the new cable tv and a one-stop shop for everyone. People don't want that? Until the competition got going, everything was easy for Netflix. The CEO couldn't do anything wrong if he tried. Now it is clear, he has no clue and has to go immediately."
Folks it’s only 3 percent relax
I sold couple 340 call yesterday (I have order at 2.5 and gone out and find out later yesterday that it was executed).I think this is inflated stock and clearly used by manipulator. Yesterday move is proof. sudden 4% gain for no reason. I think eventually this will go very bad way as no fundamental justify such valuation.
"Covid ain't gone hang tight, no volume in after hours might not even be a drop those are all neat numbers missed per share but still great numbers q3 is where it's playing for 600+"
"Be honest, who bought NFLX @ $593?"
Bring on the upgrades!
Like I said yesterday...expect more selling.
"In at 387.00 for 15 shares and a quick trade. Have a sell at 415. Not a lot, but no one got poor taking profits."
Mission accomplished..
"Remember last quarter they lowered the guidance... So,, this quarter is less pressure... They can easily beat estimates... BUY NOW"
"Netflix is going to hit 550 by the end of the day, wait for the massive surge of dip buyers today."
"Dropping fast, oh wait no it isn’t, lol Sorry Shorts"
NFLX great company. we will be seeing $360 soon.
"Netflix after the close, heading to $400 by weeks end"
RBC says NFLX will double and the stock takes a tumble. OMG hahahaha
so are they posting at 12:05 or after the bell? Yahoo says 12:05 and an article on e trade says after the bell.
"""So much value here. $NFLX is $540 with 240b market cap.CIDM is below $2 with less than 300m market cap. I don't think $NFLX is even close to 1000 times better than $CIDM. Highly undervalued! Do your down DD and get in ASAP. Easy 10x"" -Stockwits post"
nflx is the only stock that makes me feeling confidence to hold long term short. its incomes are not cover expenses for contents
wow was up 7 bucks next second down 7
Been a long day....
"""SMASHES EARNINGS"""
COVERED CALL LADY - BOT 100 SHARES at 305 + change. Sold call expires Fri. Got in 1400 + change right into my account. Love it! Don'care if it goes up or down - that's the nature of momentum stocks. Take money when u can
"""No good deed goes unpunished."" NFLX asks dormant accounts if they still want to subscribe and stock takes a haircut. Of course at current valuations, it doesn't take much to spark a drop in price."
"Shorts have taken this stock to 410+ last year, this year the pattern is repeating"
Going to test 350$ tomorrow for sure!
Nobody is going to cancel there Netflix. Only source of entertainment at home. It will be the LAST thing people drop. Skip 1-2 meals over the whole month or cancel my Netflix? Hmmmm. And who could afford to sign up for Disney and keep their Netflix account. Wow a while $16 a month. Those people must be rich LOL GO NFLX
With all the suspense over subscriber growth heading into the ER we know it's by far the most important thing for Netflix. Then it also has to be the most important thing for Netflix's competitors. Netflix competitors don't have that much subscriber growth. So if Netflix adds 1 or 2 million more subscribers than expected then it makes sense the stock can gap up 10-20% and trade at a new all time high price to sales ratio because there are no competitors that are doing the same.
Stiflel announced price target 390. Analyst said - Comcast is a very well-run company but face is ongoing challenges in a rapidly changing video landscape. Netflix on the other hand is also a well-run company but without the burden of a legacy business to protect. ￼
This market wants to rip 12% higher...... Netflix will lead the charge.
This Thursday Netflix is expected to report subscribers grew 25% for a 3rd year in row.
Another over priced turd to short into the dirt.
"Netflix has huge upside, I won't be surprised if it closes over 450 by the end of next week."
"So, it's just as likely NFLX reports a blowout quarter that gives one more boost to the share price going into the 2019. It all depends on their guidance, and how open they plan to be. Apple got hit in January when they guided down but the stock has since recovered 80% from the pre-announcement price (155 vs 158). So, maybe NFLX thinks they can guide people to the punch bowl for a bit longer before the reality sets in."
MM won't let it go higher today because of calls sold. Next week it goes higher again and calls will be sold for end of week. 520-530 possible next week.
Glad I cancelled my account ...
paying at most 50 pe...for a company that will find out how much more it can raise prices...while growing subs....yeehaw. Z
most risk to short
I got those $420 and $430 calls for super cheap... TY SHORTS 
they try to keep it down for options?
Analysts have the earnings estimate set too high for a beat. This is going to be similar to Costco’s earnings with an outrageously “unbeatable” earnings.I like to stay bullish but will play PUTS on this one.
Like watching a ball stop mid-air; what’s next?
Only question now is does this run into the close. Why not. Finish 210.75. Next week hits 220 and 230 before ER. If that is good it's 250 by end of January.
"NFLX WILL DROP BIG BY THE END OF DAY. Quiet selling going on, high volume is telling it, but No ""anals"" want to discusing about it.NFLX is falling today because comcast just conform that they are dropping bidding for Fox asset. https://finance.yahoo.com/m/ac951e65-52bf-39be-a7b9-c2f642c5035d/%5B%24%24%5D-comcast-drops-bid-for.html"

You knew that when this stock was holding strong on down market days that it could explode higher with up markets. Such is the case. Love that NLFX hanged tough on down markets.
"Up 10 , 15, or 20 after the bell?"
We are up almost as much as $NFLX
"Here is CISCO earning result in 2000. Remember Cisco is very successful company but in 2000 it reach more than half trillion valuation. if you look into earning and growth, it seems nothing can stop Cisco. All know what happen afterward. Chart are very similar and so this might peak for netflix.https://s2.q4cdn.com/230918913/files/doc_financials/annual/2000/is2000_081604.xls"
"Hey all you pessimists out there: nothing goes straight up and long term investors in nflx will do well indeed.A good business model, innovative team and good leadership will prevail despite the increased competition. Remember that nflx has evolved from a mail order business into a streaming behemoth? That should give you pessimists some pause and stop the selling nonsense and frenzy. Also, one quarter does not a trend maje."
OH BABY ITS SHOWTIME
Fundamentals and technicals lining up. First target 700 early next year and then 1000 by year end. After disrupting film and TV industry they won’t wallow in their glory. They will finish the job and take over. Perfect rounding bottom on the 6 month chart.
"Using Day Trader Josh's swing trading system, the 328.00 support on daily chart ( low on 7/31/18), its holding above here for 9 days. One of Josh's rules for an established swing level requires a 10 day hold above/below a support/Resistance, this means that going LONG here above 328 is very risky for SWINGS. Especially when market is at all-time highs and due for sharp NATURAL pullback. Investors dont worry, just hold...but swing traders, wait for 228 to break (or come close, below 330) before getting back in this beast. Now, if NFLX does NOT go back down, then we will just wait for higher resistance swing levels, and start our shorts again for quick 5-10 pullbacks. Again, we DO NOT guess direction, we instead wait patiently on sidelines till price comes to us. Way less stress and we ALWAYS get a damn good entry with this strategy. But there is far more to Day Trader Josh's strategy then what I just mapped out here. But at least you get the framework. Essentially, we are counter-trend trading, for quick (1 to 5 day) profits off the reversals in price. Although, in key situations (like earnings) we get far more then 10 points on NFLX, both LONG&SHORT."
"Down 25% since it's high, time to buy?"
don't worry it's headed for 250 just after the split
Still good value at $1000 a subscriber- I remember cable companies trading at $4000 in the 90s. Early days of Streaming.

How is $NFLX related to Nvidia?
Charts show NFLX breaking out over $500 this year. Market cap is still very low relative to earnings and potential. This stock is still in the first or second inning of a great game still to come. There are few stories as exciting as NFLX. Perhaps TSLA is the other rare one.

"$4.99 from Apple, cancelling my netflix..."
"The whole FAANG is a huge bubble ready to pop folks, NFLX will go down to $200's soon. Margin calls will come in tomorrow and Friday at a fast rate......10-20% price drop within the next couple of weeks (domino effect). NFLX is in a much worst condition than FB with a P/E ratio of over 200 but controlled selling holding it from collapsing to where it should be (slowly bleeding until it gets to $200's)."
"NFLX is really volatile!!! I've owned it since @ $100 and took profits and have been looking for an entry point. But where is the next entry point? Thought $330 might have been a good point but it fell to @ $250 and then spiked to $290 where it is now. Just can't tell where this stock is going. Analysts have been pretty negative about debt, competition, P/E, etc. Current rally may just be short covering but it is holding up pretty well. Any thoughts?"
Time for 600 then 700
1 yr Price Target: $79.00
$$600 End of week!!
"I think Netflix marketing cost is key to watchout. Their growth likely good but if marketing cost ballooned, it's serious problem. This is even before Disney and Apple Launch. So you can imagine what would happen when they launched.Netflix trying to get as many subscriber as they can before probably but again that's very risky strategy."

I've never had a Netflix subscription. Probably the only one left in the US without a subscription.
"For the sake of it's future technical health, I'd like to see NFLX fill this earnings gap before crushing the $260-65 area. Yes, they had an amazing quarter in terms of new subscriptions, but, the stock is expensive as heck... The chart looks like bitcoin. careful!"

"I am fairly new to options trading. Bought $340 Jul 20 puts yesterday. How can I get a rough estimate of where the puts will be trading post market open? Options follow the black scholes model, which I am familiar with but not too knowledgeable about (I know about delta, gamma, theta, and vega just not the mathematical calculations behind them). How would I go about mathematically getting a rough estimate of where the options should theoretically trade at market open, assuming they will open at the pre-market price (which will of course change as soon as the market opens)."
"Everyone think Netflix susbcription will raise as they make more netflix orignal and so their lead increase.Simple question:-How many total Episode on Netflix Orignal Drama they produced in last 5 years:- Answer will surprise you. It's only 400. (There are B Grade Movies and Commedy shows and Marvel Orignal exclusive (Likely pulled out in 2019) l which I am not counting).In other word, if I start watNow how many shows Disney already have:- Probably 4000+. How much content Disney/Fox will generate $15B orignal.Disney also have 1000's movies. So if you have to choose between Disney or Netflix service which one will you go with? I think answer is very obvious.Netflix will continue license external content but that also mean it limit it's own and number above may not improve much.2019 coming fast and smart likely going to run before that. All this analyst pumping may be way to exit without stock price crash."
"At this price and Disney price, It take over Disney in valuation. Unbelievable market and incompetence analyst who just know to add fuel.Why am I complaining. I am actually very happy because at this price it's almost risk free to short as long as I can control my greed, I will make solid profit on this.So my special thanks to trend follower and analysts."
May see 356 again......?
"NFLX is the only FANG stock you can buy at big discount at this price level.You will see $400 soon.Similarly it happened in July,2010 after missing est and then back to uptrend in one week or so!"
I can't imagine Disney+ will be good news for Netflix. Strange that they aren't launching until late 2019 though. I suppose that is good news at least?
there is no bottom to this free fall until this thing is properly corrected.210.

NFLX once again saving my portfolio. <3
I was looking at buying some Netflix stock but the PE ratio has me very concerned. looks way over bought?
Anyone think this is going straight to 400 from here still?
"Netflix is all about subscriber growth right now...but that does not mean it will always going to be just that. There are a thousand ways Netflix can monetize their current platform that they have not even tapped yet and I suspect the goal right now is just capture as much market share as it can. Once that growth engine starts to decline Netflix will start executing monetization on their platform. How do you know when they start? Simple look at the mature markets they are currently in and the US is numero uno on that front they will start playing around price increases and will continue until the market cannot absorb anymore, then they will play around with advertising and there are many ways to advertise on the platform without intruding on the customer experience. You will also start seeing licensing come into play on their hit shows and that folks is not just T-shirt, caps and toys......you will start to see theme parks and network TV. NOW MULTIPLY THAT PROCESS TO 180 COUNTRIES IT IS IN"
Netflix outperforming the market and other fangs this week. This could be the start of something good.

If 530 holds 690 won’t take long.
"Hilarious. Netflix is basically Blockbuster....with a $150 BILLION market cap! Debt is soaring, content acquisition costs are soaring, future content commitments are in the BILLIONS, the company has NEGATIVE $500 million in cash flow. Meanwhile, the company only loses as ""little"" as it does because it pushes the cost of broadband onto ALL broadband customers, not just Netflix customers. The big cable companies still have tons of cash and lots of very powerful political connections. And they don't appreciate subsidizing their competitor. The political risk to Netflix is high. If the cable company lobbyists ever succeed in allowing differential internet access pricing based on bandwidth usage, Netflix will be crushed. Meanwhile, there are 4X more TV shows produced per year now than just 15 years ago. So Netflix's original content is less of a special selling point because there is a content glut out there. Meanwhile, guess who is Netflix's biggest competitor? Amazon! LOL. Betting on a company to beat Amazon or even survive the onslaught from Amazon would be risky enough at a cheap valuation. But Netflix trades at like 300 TIMES EBITDA. I think Netflix the company will survive, but there is a very real chance of the equity getting wiped out to zero at some point in the next 5 years. LOL. This valuation is absolutely hilarious. Even a run of the mill correction of 20% in the stock market will take overvalued Netflix down by 50%.Right now the stock is as high as it has ever been. Everyone has been excited about Netfix for years. But today's price shows people more optimistic than they have EVER been on ANY other day. Buyer beware!"

Disney results out.. ok.. not great.. the DIS plus not soo great.. Maybe NFLX will jump tommorow

fresh juice shorts better buy back now before they are squeezed out. good earnings and adjusted subscriber count will bring netflix much higher over the next couple months and earnings season.
They regain momentum!! They can touch their highs very soon and maybe before next earnings
Shorties be like

"bought at 362, good luck to me and all"
310 tomorrow ?
MKM sees 390 million subscribers by 2025. I'v been following Netflix for many years and since 2013 every analyst with long term subscriber estimates has had to increase them.
This has been my issue with tech stocks for a long time. What may take months or years to gain can be lost in days or a week.
this will close above $30 a share tomorrow.

"Anyone notice a quarterly trend here? Right before earnings and # of subscribers release, the stock dips to sub 500. Right after the market closes and the company reports, the stock shoots right up. It appears it happen the last 3 quarters."
"This is a 1999 kind of Move up, on NOTHING. name one reason, 100% Machine driven"
"It will roll over, because of the slow down of the new subscribers, next quarter NFLX will even have tough situation because it is near the time DIS to start to hit NFLX directly from every angle."
"It's funny a few days ago everyone was said, Roku will bottom out to 30 to 50$ per share, look at it now, all of you who are making the noise now will regrate it later on."
I say ER will be lack-luster. Numbers will be in line with expectations which is already priced in. Don't expect this to pop AH. Also ER better be spotless or this will most definitely fall guaranteed. Just my 2c...getcho popcorn ready.

Jefferies Boosts Netflix Target To $610 With 'Bull Case' Of $700
"this stock reminds me of amazon - the talking heads say that the valuation makes no sense, and they would never invest in it - but the stock continues to climb for years. I'm sorry I didn't invest when I saw the writing on the wall 8 years ago."
Never bet against NFLX!!! Exceptional company and visionary management!!!
"Netflix has come this far, and surely it will go farther from here. Intermittent pullbacks are normal even from Jan 2018 up to the present. Trust Netflix. Just hold on your stocks. The best things will come for those who wait."

"Rather nice dead cat bounce. RSIs have improved to mid 40s but NFLX still below all of its daily SMAs. I still believe NFLX will fall down to its next support level of $252. My only regret is that I didn't purchase longer dated puts, say Dec 2019 or Jan 2020. Give me a shot in the low $260s and I'll bail and go a bit further out."
amazed it went back up so quick. I sold my nibbling shares in AH back around 358-360. Well congrats to longs. Did not expect it to be so strong.
NFLX was trading around 278$ yesterday then it ran to 285 due to news that Altice intergrades it to it top box set.The stop losses will kick in til 271.5 where I will cover my shares .imo

No matter how much economy drops and markets drop people will continue to watch their TV shows and movies for time being so I reckon Netflix can only fall so much

Woo hoo! It's a great day to be in Netflix land.
who sees $400 by next week
"Do not be deluded by the bounce from 350 to 380 yesterday. When large holders are surprised by bad news, they buy into it and sell their shares to the shorts. Then they exit at their leisure, as they were doing today. No one wants a growth stock which has stopped growing. This should be walked down to 350 again eventually."
speechless
This is going to be us boys in a few weeks. 500 coming
Cannot wait for netflix movie about fed manipulating the stock market
"For the naysayers (and the longs who know a good company and investment when they see one):Netflix is a positive cash flow company, they are making money hand over fist. They currently owe more than they make, but as they gain subscribers (projected 200+ million by 2020) and pay the debt down NFLX will become one of the wealthiest companies on the planet. Companies borrow money all the time, even blue chip companies, to invest in growth and infrastructure. FB borrowed a ton of money before they were net positive, so did Sirius XM and AMZN. The math is there, and it's simple, that's why the stock price is what it is, with 79%+ institutional investment. The institutional investment wouldn't be so high if the banks didn't see a golden goose. Shorties just want to try and drive the price down with nonsense so they can make a 4-5% gain here or there, while us longs are already up over 100% on the year. I know what side I'd rather be on with this stock. The shorts are going to get burned and then cry that it's manipulation or some other nonsense. It's hilarious how no matter how well a stock is doing, there is always the ""sky is falling"" types that cry doom and gloom. If they'd care to take a look at numbers, NFLX only has a 4.5% short interest on its share float. That's literally like saying 4.5 out of 100 people think the stock is going to go down in the short term. That's extremely low. Most shorters don't have the stomach to watch a 5-10% rise above their short price, and they close with a loss; that is going to happen with the short float leading up to earnings, and we might get a nice little 2-3% squeeze on top of the next rally. If you shorties were confident in your position you wouldn't be on here day after day, hour after hour, posting non-stop ""armageddon is coming"" nonsense. But hey, good luck."
I love Netflix but it's extremely and insanely overpriced
Is low volume means no buyers or no sellers??? It’s almost half of daily volume
It will go higher.
what's the expected closing price?
Day trading this stock wasn’t the best idea was it fellas?(;
NFLX must see bigger business from overseas... to make investors happy IMO.

This is what happen when company pressured from Investor. This is reason I say all along that Raising stock price is not good for company like Netflix. It just push company to make short term decisions that only hurt long term potential.https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2018/06/06/despite-season-2-issues-netflix-greenlights-13-reasons-why-season-3/?utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=partner&utm_campaign=yahootix&partner=yahootix&yptr=yahoo#2c33473b79ae

"Netflix maintain overweight and $643 price target at piper sandlerPiper Sandler analyst Yung Kim says the firm's December quarter ""Netflix Navigator"" search index points to Q4 subscriber growth in-line with consensus for both U.S. and Canada as well as international. The search index analysis suggests Q4 U.S. and Canada subscriber growth of 8.5% year-over-year, versus the consensus at 8.3%, and international growth of 29.1%, versus the consensus at 28.7%. Kim remains comfortable with estimates of 8.7% and 28.7%, respectively, driven by the ongoing stay-at-home environment. Despite increasing competition, Netflix continues to capture a significant share of content consumption dollars, Kim tells investors in a research note. The analyst keeps an Overweight rating on the shares with a $643 price target."
If Netflix has taught me anything. That is how to stomach seeing your stock go down 30% knowing no one is near this company’s current market. Going to keep holding.

"IQ is nflx in infant stage. Actually better, less competition. IQdoing what nflex did a decade later. Ads ads, ads on top of all nlx does."
"It is perfectly fine for NFLX to sign Obama up. It will not be perfectly fine if NFLX becomes a propaganda machine for the progressive movement. This is what ABC, NBC, CBS, and all of their affiliates have become. What a disaster that has become for them. And you have no idea how many people are turned off by, and never watch those channels. Another example is the Hollywood elites. Oscar ratings were historically low by a wide margin because many simply refuse to listen to the political garbage that is spewed as well as the ridicule they are subject to because they don't share the views of liberal elites.Mark my words. If NFLX gets into bed with one side of the political spectrum, they will lose massive numbers of customers. Reed Hastings made it known how much he hates Trump as he threatened to resign from FB board because Peter Thiel was on the FB board and Thiel supported Trump. So while signing Obama is fine (it's a free country where diversity of opinion is supposed to be welcomed - unless you are not a progressive of course), if NFLX starts this march towards becoming a liberal propaganda machine, it is going to get cut down to size."

"Good friend of mine from high school works at TD Ameritrade. I called him over the weekend. He said when the markets have been so bad and many have lost 10-30% equity in their positions, a small 1% drop pre-market causes tons of margin calls to go out. Most end up selling to cover the margin calls when market opens adding to the sell off and driving price down more. viscous cycle. You'd be surprised how many people are trading on margin...give someone credit and they will take it. Most houses bought on credit, cars, and most of the stocks as well."
stock buyback will add 200/shr.

"As more online streaming available. It's no brainer People will use Online streaming and take internet from Cable or who ever provide.Reason is simple. Main advantage is on demand nature without worrying about DVR, Timing and many other thing. Only live stream, Cable make sense. (Cable likely go that route as Internet still yet to figure out pipe size issue but getting closer. Live streaming is reality but still behind by min or two compare to Cable).Subscriber also like to see all different content and use multiple streaming.Now biggest question is:- What keep those subscriber subscribe year round same service:-I find no reason to subscriber year round right now. Month or two more than enough to see all new content I like to see in 1 year.With Online, you can cancel anytime and subscribe again.Very soon people will figureout and stop keeping year round. This going cause limit on how many subscriber you can have.given how quickly $NFLX marketing budget going up per new Subscriber, this might happen already. Netflix able to find new subscriber to replace those and still able to show growth but coming at increasingly more cost. When Netflix realize it's not financially sustain it will stop spending more on marketing."

"LONGS! We have to hold the $300 level! We need to come together and BUY today to defend this crucial psychological level. The stocks HIGH for 2017 was only 200, and we could easily revisit that level if this slips back into the $200s. Don't let it happen! BUY!"
NFLX's loudest detractors continue to be the ones who fear owning it. They will fear buying it at 300 and 200 because the valuation will still be too high for them.Every great company that has ever irreversibly changed the world has stumbled along the way. NFLX will have another stellar quarter eventually and to those burying it today will watch from the sidelines again.
For once the analyst was right. See you under $300

Amazon and YouTube just made a deal to allow video clips for amazon sellers. It's only a matter of time before Google YouTube and Amazon take over the whole streaming industry. Netflix days are numbered and they know it. Theyre even thinking bout pulling out from making Martin Scorseses next film
"I told you to buy an hour after the market opened because by the then the fundies would have sold an the weak hands would have thrown in the towel. I bought only 300 shares but by the end of the day I am up $29 a share. If you panicked and sold learn a lesson from this. You got scared by the bad press, panicked and sold. You ended up doing exactly what the fundies wanted you to do so that they could buy your shares cheap."

Mark Cuban (Dallas Mavericks owner) owns a ton of NFLX and AMZN stock.I don't think he is selling either of them this week.
Today Netflix will be above 564$ probably 580$ or even more. Lots of good news. It is considered a safe play after it beat the estimates.
Goldman Sachs reporting Netflix will spend 12 to 13 billion on content for 2018 instead of the 7.5 to 8 billion Netflix guided for. If this is the case it means subscriber growth is coming in much higher than expected.
it's only 15% after 100%+run-up..........
Always the EPS misses.
On the news after hours yesterday NFLX was down 3 points. After the day traders were done and the news analyzed this WINNER soars nearly 20 points into today's action. This stock's share appreciation is far from over.

Everytime I want to watch a movie that I have in mind...Not on NFLX.Canceling tomorrow.Buy puts on this pig
"This past week I sold, fully knowing that NFLX is going up. Tuition is due for my child and I cashed in at $520. 33 months ago I jumped on board at $320. Not a bad profit, just ignore Sonny Black and wait or the next upward move.Frustration did set in with the endless liberal decisions by Netflix management. Signing the Obama's, Cuties and praising Kaepernick are just a few of the ideas that I desired to step away from.So long, sorry Sonny black isn't here to share my winnings with or he could carry home his share IN A BAG of course LOL."
"I think from here onward we will be rangebound between $360-$385, until next earnings. If 3Q is good, then $410-$440. If 3Q is bad, $310 will be tested."
Could be 100 bucks streaming is slow sometimes.

I'm hoping we beat. ;)
nice came back today
This option trading for Netflix make no sense. I bought 320$ call April 20th contract for 955$ and stock price at 307! And today went up 20$! My contract price still at 1000$!?! Anyone explain ??
To all you shorts... I'll say it yet AGAIN... The Street and fund managers want this above 400 again. It's that simple.
Investigation needed
Well its up again in premarket. We need this to start ramping up as earnings are coming. Can we keep it Green today?
You know what happens when it hits $290s? It'll jump straight to $300
Bulls what do you think about disney entering the streaming service game? Will netflix take a decent hit in the short term because they will lose at least 10% of the movies and shows.
"At this rate, I believe NFLX will achieve PE of 300."
Upgrades are very good. 350 in no time
Netflix will return to $525.00 and then onwards to $550.00
BUY:. .. MU.. JD... GE.. DESPThank me later
Super duper 600$ stock!
And this is trading up why?
"I can still remember when AMZN dropped like this after earnings and I honestly thought that was a buying opportunity. But I was too scared to jump in. Look at where Amazon is now... Honestly, you just need to know who’s going to be the winners of the future. For me, NFLX is the future and being the pioneer of the streaming world, it will only get bigger and stronger over time."
Is it just me or do I see a huge block trade on ever stock around 10 am today. Buy backs?
"Needham analyst Laura Martin called short Netflix, long Roku the firm's top pairs trade for 2021. While Netflix's growth story could slow next year, the analyst believes that Roku's powerful advertising growth engine could pay dividends on its larger installed base. The analyst maintained its Buy rating on Roku and an Underperform rating on Netflix."
Added only 670K new subscriber. But how many of them are one of those free ones that received membership through mobile phone companies and other partners. They don't pay. This company never tells the truth.
I knew it was going down today.
Nice movie bird box
Dumped at $272. Absolutely crazy action and I had a target of $268 by next week but when we blew through that had to re-think. Couldn't pass up an $80/share gain in a few weeks. I will be back on this one. Good luck to longs. This has been the biggest 3 week gain I've ever had. Thank you NFLX.
All the NAYSAYERS on this great stock and yet it soars in the past few weeks. Everyone on CNBC was calling for the end of this successful company. They know NOTHING! Just look at what it has done. Anyone who bought way under $300 a share has made a fortune in a very short time. CONGRATS!
"As we all know, NFLX can go up just as fast as it went down...stay tuned."
"Lot of people buying up on post earning movement. Remember history don't repeat and do repeat. don't repeat on such gain Quarter after Quarter specially for such large cap. History do repeat on Scale limitation. Every subscriber Netflix add, mean it reduce pool who possibly subscribe. pool is getting smaller and smaller & some point leaving start outpacing new subscriber & so Growth slowed or even get negative in no time."
Last chance today and tomorrow for people looking to get into NFLX prior to a BLOWOUT Q1 earnings after market close on Tues. Just look at some of the articles out yesterday and today and you'll see everyone is projecting BLOWOUT earnings! This is why all the major Wall St firms upgraded NFLX last week to high $400s and as high as $500
"I bought 350 calls and 300 puts for May with a $ ratio of about 5:1, so I'm playing for a big move up here. This is contrary to my views the past few weeks. Mostly because we fell into 340s here the expectations are a bit lower now. Furthermore, the puts will limit losses and possibly be profitable in the event this drops big tomorrow. If this doesn't move at all, I'm fine with that too, I cut my losses from expensive options going into earnings and get into something else."
Takes a strong stomach to hold onto NFLX.
how high do you guys really think this name can go?
If drop till 165... I buy it
THE BEST SHORT STOCK IN THE BUSINESS!

after earnings released
goes to show trade with your gut not with people have to say they have their own agenda and everybody that was bashing was dead wrong.
if it breaks 550 prior resistance it is done.
Very disappointed today with this run tomorrow this can open big over $400 then run to $415 go nflx
we could see 100 point swing if earnings and subscriber numbers are met.
"It looks everyone is bashing Netflix, Just like they used to say, Tesla."

"Good luck tomorrow Netflix price target raised to $440 at RBC Capital MarketsMARKETWATCH — 09/06/2018 3:01 PM ETAnalysts at RBC Capital Markets raised their price target for Netflix (NFLX.NaE) to $440 from $360 on Thursday, citing survey results showing high satisfaction and an increase in usage among U.S. and U.K. consumers. In a survey of over 1,500 U.S. consumers, 57% of respondents said they used Netflix (NFLX.NaE), up from 55% in May 2018 and 53% in September 2017. The survey also showed that 68% of Netflix (NFLX.NaE) subscribers were ""extremely"" or ""very satisfied"" with their experience. A hefty 84% percent of subscribers said they were ""not at all likely"" or ""slightly likely"" to cancel in the next three months, though that figure was below the 87% average of the last five quarters. In the U.K., 56% of respondents said they used Netflix (NFLX.NaE), up from 49% last year. Eight percent of subscribers in the U.K. said they were ""extremely"" or ""very"" satisfied with the service, and churn levels in the U.K. were at a record low; a record 71% said they were ""not at all"" or ""slightly likely"" to cancel in the next 3 months. ""We believe that Netflix (NFLX.NaE) has achieved a level of sustainable scale, growth, and profitability that isn't currently reflected in its stock price,"" wrote RBC analysts, led by Mark Mahaney, in a note to investors. He said he also sees potential in Netflix's (NFLX.NaE) push into India. ""India could well be a source of millions of new Netflix (NFLX.NaE) subscribers over the next few years,"" he wrote, ""but the company has a lot of work to do."" An RBC review of local Indian news sources suggested Netflix (NFLX.NaE) was off to a good start; its original series ""Sacred Games"" has become highly popular in the region. Mahaney also reiterated the company's outperform rating. Netflix (NFLX.NaE) shares have gained 80% so far this year, while the S&P 500 has gained 7.6%."

Disney is 2 months from pulling content from NFLX. Walmart will take a chunk of subscribers of middle and lower incomes from NFLX when service is announced. The hot air balloon  is about to pop!
Friday 13... Most stock red... Jason is coming to town.

The stock chart is telling us loud and clear that TV watchers will always choose the service that gives them more for their money.
10 Billion in debt and 2 Billion debt to issue soon. Where's the end of NFLX cash burns?
"Netflix is into producing and distributing hindi movies , worlds second largest after hollywood."
Almost to 280! Thanks shorts for your advise!
"Sweet, just picked up more shares at 299!"
"Hello everyone! if by chance you have time and desire to discover a mini Netflix that already collaborates with NFLX I suggest you put in your watchlist CIDM very under rated stock with great potential now below 2$. The company's recent moves have resulted in near zero debt and great expansion. Some of the company's digital content partners include: 20th Century Fox, Disney, DreamWorks, Lionsgate, Paramount, Sony, Universal, Warner Brothers, Weinstein and hundreds of independent distributors around the worldp.s. sorry for my English"
"For my fellow newbie robinhood investors. If you are wondering why the sudden drop. Hold tight it was just a small correction, don't use any margins whatsoever we might see some drastic drops since $GOOG $MSFT $NVDA $AMD $TSLA $NFLX $AMZN all of them are highly overvalued. Right now only retail investors like you are buying these and smart money want to get out at the moment. Don't use any margins and don't make rush calls. I would never buy from these levels either or short them."

What happens at the Bell today? Will this stock finally get its much deserved reversal
Hold!
People now watch more Netflix than cable TV and by a wide margin according to a Cowen survey. It won't be the current Netflix managers that gouge it's customers but the future managers.
Netflix will fly come earnings and new subscriptions
So basically everyone was wrong. There was no bloodbath and it was in the green. Anyone want to apologize?
"Vs gets you facts straight. per CNBC “Sheridan still raised his price target to $425 from $375 for Netflix shares, representing 2 percent upside to Wednesday’s close”."
Sold at $248. Great move but this is as good as it gets.
Below 500 by end of week

Perfect! Thanks guys!
Netflix is still a great stock in my opinion. Should be worth 3 times the amount or more.
So what’s the word on today’s actionI think it will be a replay of yesterday dropping to 560 and then closing around low 570sWould love to see it bottom out at 530s early so I could cash in on my puts and call it a day
$375 after closing!! #NFLX
Buying!
will it turn green?
"alot of angry shorts here, this is a long play"
"Very high PE, additional 1.5 billion debt. NFLX to go down quickly"
Many subscribers have dropped the service because they became to political in their programming. Annie 's first season was delightful but second season was unwatchable. Political correctness overwhelmed the script. I cancelled and will not return.Programming with Obama and Letterman tipped the scales. Many othe good options available.
"Some people are saying that NFLX earnings are not going to meet expectations, yet a majority of the nation (~328 Million), are told to stay home... while at the same time movie theatre’s are being shut down. Am I missing something here? To me this looks like a Great opportunity for NFLX to take over the market. They just bought out the Paris theatre in NYC so that they can begin to have their movies/shows receive Oscas, what makes you think they wouldn’t do the same with AMC or Regal? Someone please enlighten me because all I see is upside from here."
"Remember two words: this is an “American Giant”, can’t tell you what price it will go up, but I can assure you $400+ beginning Jan, 2019. Logical reason? The “Buyback” will kicking strong until then. Relax."
4M new sub from China is very dubious. I came from the country and I never knew Nflx is hot there. And not so many people can watch English streaming program if there is no subtitle
Because it just crossed the 50 DMA and that’s a very bullish sign. If it closes over 364 it could quickly gap to high 370s tomorrow.
This should start to turn around soon. Green today
$562.00 & Higher !!!!
"Mission control, this is NFLX19, ready for takeoff. We have a clear path to planet 400. Are we cleared for liftoff. NFLX19, this is Mission Control, you are cleared for liftoff in T-minus 13 minutes."

load up on puts tomorrow morning. 305 will be the high
Gotta love that electron Hollywood.
Looks like market has bottomed at least in the short term. Earnings will be the focus going forward.
Will come back stronger Monday and hit 600 next week. That options thing is over.
$370/ share coming fast
Buying more
"I guess it's time to sell. please, share with your thoughts. thank you"
"The Dow and Nasdaq have been carpet bombing us with numerous large dive bombs on too many days. Dow up 150, up 110, bam!--down 700, etc. Same with Nasdaq. This is not the actions of a bull market. Maybe we are in a new type of market---""Wild Boar Market""?"
Keep raising cost and people will reduce there service. I just switched from ultimate to standard. So no price hike for me.
"Netflix got too political with their movies. They are dark, depressing movies. Even the queens gambit had shades of the darkness and love of communism theme. Please dont want indoctrination, just something to feel good about life and people. Just make action with a positive ending and feel good movies and that what Disney does."
Netflix is King! 
decided to flip a coin on whether to buy a put or call
"VIAC is a better buy - which one is more likely to go up 10-15% this month? Market cap is too high here now for consistent gains, and revenue growth is slowing down."
"Midday lull like it always does, rally toward 400+ will begin around 2-2:30."
"were getting crushed now, makes me think its going down tomorrow also"
"Trevor Milton, is now appearing on Kobra Kia!"
"Google trend data suggest Outlander season 1 and 2 has a bigger viewing audience on $NFLX than any season ever had on Starz. Does this draw Netflix subscribers to subscribe to Starz for season 3&4? If so probably not for more than a month before they cancel, but sure shows the importance of scale. LGF is more valuable apart of another network than on it's own, it's so obvious."
"There it goes up again. Those big banks and investors bought yesterday. Made a big profit today. Sold high and hired people to convince everybody that this stock is no good. Negative reports, spam on forums. It went from 10% up, where they sold. To 3,5%. And now they buy back. Watch my words friends. I would do it to if i had a billion to spend by the way."
Guidance will temper the enthusiasm. We're still in the peak of a pandemic. Got some headwinds on sub growth a couple quarters out.

Insurmountable debt. Decreasing revenue growth. Rising interest rates. A stock market bubble based on 8 year of 0% interest rates. Analysts raising price targets to unload shares on retail. What’s not to love about Netflix?
Days high. $580 coming soon.
Might we see 580 tomorrow?
Don't understand why this keeps ripping higher on more debt and weak guidance.
"Going to $750,,, easy money"
"I just sold my 35 shares at $411. I made a profit of about $8,000. Too bad I didn't buy 100 shares or more"

500 target
Shorties are sweating it now with this upward pressure.

Apple should have a beat tomorrow this should keep the rally going thru Fri at least....
whats a better buy Apple or NFLX i am confused
Why don't you just make the fake news real. Say Nflx price target raised to keep the stock market from a correction. That w be just fine don't you think?

This stocks like the Wind. gone
1.9b netflix gift cards were sold
real Netflix up 4.3 percent
looks like being stuck at 380 +-2
My gut is telling me this will finally hit $600 sometime before the next ER.
"Any good company who protects investors lowers the guidance ahead of time, FB does, MSFT does, everyone doe it,Netflix hasn't lowered the guidance for this quarter, so their numbers would be blockbuster.I'm seeing 430 after hours!!!!"
that was an absolute gift
I am very curious about all this hype that Netflix did not reach subscriber growth numbers. This is true domestically but internationally they met the expected growth. One thing to note is Netflix market saturation domestically. They have already reached a HUGE amount that any more growth domestically will be expensive to maintain and grow. This is why I think that international growth should be the focus of Netflix in the coming years. Thoughts?
im in for 20 large at yesterdays price. who doesn't have netflix nowadays? Going to be like apple in 2010-2018
"If I have prime, Hulu, Disney, Netflix, att, Apple. One of em gots to go."
"In a few years, there will talks about Netflix buying Disney."
This is obviously an informal poll but about a third of my friends have canceled Nexflix since Susan Rice and the Obamas were affiliated.
Dow futures climbing after hours.
Anybody else heard rumor that Netflix is planning on bundling MoviePass into their subscription?

It will be interesting to see how much selling pressure we see here shortly. They're trying to break it out on the intraday chart.
There is so much risk in this market which is now at all time highs
It’s going green today after 10am start buying it’s going to start looking good.
"It looks like this baby could rebound back to $400 by market close! :)I guess investors are finally reading the full earnings report and realize the company's fundamentals are still there and the story hasn't changed, and its growth potential remains high. As I've said in previous posts - those of us who have been in this stock for five-plus years have seen big pullbacks before, and each time we watched Reed Hastings hang tough, ignore the doom-and-gloom naysayers, and map out an incredible growth story. This is a buy-and-hold stock, folks."
Even Mr wonderful from shark tank said loves Netflix and going to buy more it’s a no No-brainer
NFLX has never ever missed 2 earnings in a row in the company history..... Easy money this evening.
ALL.... bubbles eventually popTXMD 
The gains nflx has had this year are great but when you look at where the market and what this has done the last 3 months it’s hard to be pleased. You want your stocks close to their 52 week highs when market is setting new records daily. It appears that large cap tech is suffering the most. It is strange because you see companies like roku crowdstrike google snowflake etc hitting new highs. Then you have companies like amzn nflx zoom which seem to be stuck despite great earnings. Zoom I understand more because of valuation. But then how can you explain snowflake. If snowflake is this high then zoom should be higher. If roku has run 30% in a few weeks then nflx should have seen some reaction along with that. So I just see a lot of disconnects which makes it harder to invest. Definitely been trading more this week. It’s basically a traders market right now and I guess just follow the momentum.
"Sorry, I am going to short this"

"Up $25, or 8.5%, which is well over $10 billion in market cap in just the past 2 trading days on essentially no significant news. Based on sheer momentum, you would guess it hits $350 by end of the week and then $400 after ER if they added more subs than projected, which they always do."

"I would be interested in the subscribers added that are not part of the Sprint / T mobile merger. Anybody have those numbers, because the growth for next quarter is the issue if they are a result of Sprint."
Netflix will always win with high unemployment until they run out of money to pay the monthly fee.
Will this be around in 5-10 years?They may have to sell a bunch of shares to stay afloat.
"I have given enough thought on what to do. Here is how my holding look2200 short Average price just below $260I just short 2 285 calls I had 15 265 cover put for (that I just cover. $260 average price including that profit).Now I have open 2200 short. I know just today I lost $20K, Total is $50K+ loss.I thought to give various option including start selling put aggressively But $CAT I end up long side while doing that which Company like CAT is fine. But not with NFLX where if Crash come, this can go to $100's easily. So I only left with 2 options.1.> Sell in money cover put but if sell off start this can easily below 260 and I regret it.2.> Sell out money Cover put which I will do it again if this go near 270.3.> Trade Stock, Given large number stock, this I think I can do with little risk. Read market sentiment and trade accordingly.4.> Forget and keep all open. (Which mean I wait for payday). Only problem is if this keep going up very soon I will get margin call."
I'm down 17% = 5K..... hold or jump ship now? No hurry to sell but I'm wondering if this will ever recover!
going ro 200
Disney now has all of Fox's content and will most likely pull all of it from Netflix when it launches it's own streaming service. There will be very little good quality shows on Netflix and people will have to choose between different platforms which will put pricing pressure on subscription fees. Growth for Netflix is having some major headwinds which will undoubtedly affect the share price...
Following same pattern on chart as yesterday

Dear God Of Stock... please forgive me for not going long 9 years ago on Netflix.. I only ask 9 mo..
"Something I just noticed. We last hit 300 a month ago today. First time NFLX hit 300 was back on March 2.From March 2 to Nov. 14, it was 300+ in 170 of 180.The the longest it went not in 300 during the stretch was 9 days March 28 to April 10. And then ONE day in Oct. 30.Dec. 3, we got to 298.72 and then closed the day 290.30Next day, 295.74 and closed 275.30We are going to need a good run to hit 300 again this year."
We need another upgrade from any banks!
"CFRA Outlook for NFLX-2018-2019---Total revenues are projected to increase about35% in 2018, with continued strong subscriber growth and the benefit of recent priceincreases. By the end of Q3 2017, the company had surpassed 110 million paid membersworldwide, with rising viewership fueled byexpanded content offerings through a recent round of global expansion. With increasedcollaboration with service providers, we seefurther upside to U.S. subscriber growth and a much stronger international growth trajectory,with rising penetration of global online/mobilehouseholds. We see 2019 revenues up almost 20%.Despite escalated content costs (projected at$7.5 billion to $8.0 billion per year) and increased marketing spending, as well astechnology and G&A expenses, the companysees its operating margin expanding about 300 basis points in 2018, reaching about 10%(versus 7.2% in 2017). In large part, overallresults should benefit from rising profits from the international division, which should drive afurther margin improvement in the next fewyears against intensifying pressures from content and marketing spending.**After interest expense and taxes, we forecast EPS of $2.38 in 2018 and $3.82 in 2019."
The shorts are missing the main Reason for the run.It is their pricing power.They can bump up their Revenue by raising their monthly fee by 25-50 % without losing any sub .It's the cheapest form of entertainment out there.Costco and Amazon are in the same boat.
We are looking at a decisively higher gain in subscribers during 3Q earnings announcement on 10/16! $450 here we come!!!
Who is buying this - same business model as Tesla - wait another 3-6 months
"If the stock did not crash with a poor earnings report, can you imagine where it would be with a excellent Q3 earnings! My guess is 600."
"Sell offs like this is way more than a 3B revenue miss. If you believe in Netflix and believe it’s not going anywhere, therefore will continue to grow and make money, but doesn’t perform on a quarter the way analyst say it should, then why do people sell? It just hurts your stock, if patience and relaxation would take place even on a miss, your stock would stay solid and be closer to 400 a share again. Really, think about it, the share will drop low again when it was up 50%, but people will still invest and not go anywhere, so why sell? Seems to me people hurt their own finances by tanking there own stock."
What will NFLX close at tomorrow?
"Market is in the hands of Algorithm programs running on servers not retail institutions or institutions. That takes away the human emotions, momentum trading , fundamentals and great ER. on which trades should be made. This is a SCAM run by machines and programmed based on false metrics and triggers. We all retail investors are taken out of picture. Sad but true!"
So shorts....show me the $220.00 bottom....Hmmmmm! Buy to cover your short which will propel this stock to $310.00 in March and $350.00 in April after earnings. NFLX may be acquired either by AAPL or DIS.
"people: whatever we do/say/buy/sell here it will not affect the stock price, as we only represent 1.74% of the total investors... only the institutional investors can move the price as they please"
Buy buy buy 330 is coming
"Advice to the shorts! Never stand in front of a moving train. If everyone is jumping into a stock, regardless of your thesis don't go against the crowd. The market will crush you, even if your thesis proves correct later. Cover your shorts and live to trade another day!"
593 to 526 . Awesome . Rather not even bother w/ Netflix stock. What a disappointment. Headed right back to sub 5.
"GSAT in extended hours, buy it 5g satellites.....GTE energy.... cciv lucid rumors, ciic arrival"

There are not enough questions being asked on the profitability of streaming services competing with Netflix.
"The robust earnings on April 16, in particular, surging international growth, should propel NFLX beyond 400. Look around you, and speak to your friends around the world, all seem to be addicted to NFLX original content. Hours of high quality streaming content, when and where you want it, commercial-free, and intelligently catered to your taste - coming at a price of watching a single flick - NFLX is a game changer. I predict consumers will ungrudgingly pay an extra buck or two for its service, adding hundreds of millions to the bottom line. Is competition increasing - sure, but we still have 200 million Americans still subscribing to network TV. I predict blue skies for NFLX, for the next earnings, and beyond."
370 coming.
"Only down 9% after a miss, this stock has a way to go (down that is)."
Cord cutting continues and nflx will do just fine. The drop is an opportunity to buy some shares because it will be $400 but the end of the year.
bought 40 shares at 333.26. I set a limit sell for first thing in the morning at 360
GS price target 495-announced this evening.

MS says ntflx should be near 400 by July.
I own 1 million shares I’m going to sell them all right now. What will happen to the stock price?
Everyone delete Netflix off your watch list. Then come back in 2 weeks and you’ll be surprised 400.00
Bought $50k worth in Netflix @ 309.36. I guess it was worth it.
Late afternoon is when we see a rally in the stock as people will want to have NFLX in their portfolio prior to start of a breakout week (especially big boys and hedge funds). A little Profit taking so far today is very understandable.
"Folks, who fuss about OBAMA, Reid, Pelosi, Clintons,etc having content on nflx etc, do you really think people are that politically motivated in their spending habits. Do u think they won't for example, not eat at a restaurant because it is ""run by Democrats"" or something like that?"
should buy more now?
Large buy block.
I can't believe anyone would own this stock.......I hope they run a show with images of your granddaughter twerking
oh yes........ come on 4% up
wait til it reaches the 50 day moving average around 348 before buying. It always bounces off from there when it pulls back.
"CEO claim that he will have 100M from India is laughable claim.India sure has 1300M people but when you count house hold, They are around 300M ( Joint family common in India still).In other word to reach 100M subscriber it need 1 in 3. Now even USA it hardly reach there.Now look at Income.In India 85% household don't even earn $1000/Month. In other word they can't afford $10/Month. Cable service does not even cost $10/month with 100's channel.So At best I give chance to reach 10M.Same article estimate 0.5M paid subscriber in India.This is how insane claims people make. When it come from CEO this look seriously fishy.I wonder if he inflating subscriber count using robot just to create hype and stock price raise. If Secondary Stock offer announced soon, It will just confirm my theory that They need money and using Stock as Money and fooling people."
"330,000% increase in eps and 30% increase in REV==== NFLX is best of breed start making a bid AAPL,DIS, AMZN. Always trades down after earning but Goldman has a 425 PT before getting the #### increase PT to 500. OK GB"
First of all i want to clear something up. The market screwed over netflix. Partially netflix got screwed more because of its valuation and then 2B note and inner management news ain’t helping the stock either. But as soon as this wave is over i assure you that everyone here who is saying netflix will be below 200 will be running away with their pants down. Because when this stock decides to rally it will wipe away all these leachers. The selling has been excessive especially for NFLX. But that is what you get with this stock it is 2x more volatile than other FAANGS. Longs - Q3 couldn’t have been better for us hold on to it because that is the biggest assurance you will receive and it is good. A lot of companies have disappointed earnings this season but NFLX. Haha it made a blowout. Hold on tight longs we will take off. Nothing has changed about NFLX growth and it will bounce back just got to be able to stomach this turbulence.
Is it time to sale??
By Friday this will be around 260
Wait till NFLX subscribers lose Disney and National Geographic etc and are left with whatever the new streamers allow NFLX to buy. Disney and Time Warner own a lot more content than a bunch of made for TV soaps.
NFLX rejoins IBD 50 again today==Bullish!!See you $450!
It’s sho trying to climb.
$495 soon
Easy 370 soon
Will close green
Netflix and everyone on board the ship happy New Years true leader of them all
"This is a easy call.I am going short on this. It has to go down below 300.Everything is already factored in and hence there is going to be massive profit taking and shorting.1st quarter subscription is slow for NFLX.Take my advice, sell before it's too late."
"NFLX $210. Target announced: By Trey Williams, MarketWatchNetflix's valuation is the elephant in the roomInvestors shouldn't worry about Netflix's rapacious spending -- but should be concerned about its ability to grow overseas, say analysts who started coverage of the streaming company on Tuesday.Analysts at Evercore initiated their coverage of Netflix Inc. with an in-line rating and a $210 12-month price target, which represents a roughly 14% premium to current trading levels.Lead analysts Vijay Jayant and Anthony DiClemente wrote in a note to investors that there are a lot of aspects of Netflix's story that are no longer debated. Internet TV is here to stay and the growth runway is massive. Within that, they wrote, Netflix (NFLX) has a huge head start.""The platform has reached near ubiquity with the help of an effective original content strategy, and a global mass market has emerged with streaming becoming the consumer's preferred way to consume video content,"" Jayant and DiClemente wrote"

"""The best propaganda is that which, as it were, works invisibly, penetrates the whole of life without the public having any knowledge of the propagandistic initiative.""Hastings threatened to resign from FB board because Peter Theil (fellow board member) had the audacity of expressing his american right to his opinion by supporting Trump. I thought that Hastings response was weird, but gave him a pass. Then, we get the announcement that the Obamas will be involved, No problem I thought, as once again, the great thing about this country is diversity of thought. But added to the Peter Theil thing, just a little weird where this seemed to be headed.Now Susan Rice. Wow. Everything gels. Wonder what % of content is going into the propaganda machine. This is becoming very scary. Has nothing to do with being long/short."

"What the H is going on? How could it be lower than it was pre-earnings when everyone thought they were going to miss and instead they BEAT? Hold on, computer correction taking place. Should be back to sanity next week when it makes a run back towards $400"
"Down 100$ from the high. I think the selling is about done. ok, I hope it's done"
fantastic results
After market turns green.... shortsqueeze continu
feels like earnings never happened
William Blair loves NFLX
Its going lower.... why
Reed Hastings just sold another $22 million of Netflix on 4/22. What a great country! He is a multi-billionaire and yet his company loses over $3 billion per year.
"If you value Netflix strictly by its ability to make money by subscription only then your not looking at the big picture. Netflix is in the midst of a transformation. This company just like it did when it switch to streaming is again transforming into a media company. You can see from the steady stream of media talent it has acquired and property location it has purchased. The ramp up in Netflix original movies is not just for its subscription business, it is part of a larger business transformational strategy. The cost of making movies for Netflix is going to go down further as they become more of a movie studio than a streaming company."
Above 265 is possible tomorrow and above 270 on Friday.
"The companies being the hardest hit these days are those with lots of debt. NFLX is a DEBT LADEN company with negative free cash flow of over $3.0 billion. Stated debt on balance sheet is $15.0 BILLION. There is an additional $5.0 BILLION disclosed in the debt footnote in their filings. And there is an additional $10+ billion in debt like contingencies which didn't qualify to be consolidated on he balance sheet. So we have $30 Billion in debt just there for a company which stays alive each year by borrowing but credit markets are now closed. Netflix does not make any more money just because people watch more. In fact, they make loss as it increases their streaming costs to serve up the content. Maybe facts don't matter with a cult stock-but everything I said is a fact which is in their most recent 10K."
I can't add more shares quick enough. Wish I had more to invest. Going 400+ over next couple weeks!
Good perspective coming into earnings: https://techstockobserver.com/netflix-inc-nasdaqnflx-gets-ready-to-rock-or-be-rocked/
This one's gonna keep going up. like tesla. still not too late to buy some.
Great bear trap has been set. Those who are buying the dip will be holding the bag
whoever said $20 up today...you were pretty close buddy!
Netflix May Rebound by 15% on Bullish Momentumhttps://www.investopedia.com/news/netflix-may-rebound-15-bullish-momentum/?partner=YahooSA&yptr=yahoo
385 coming.
"This is one strong stock. After the plunge this morning and the remarkable recovery this afternoon, it is even up in after hours. What are people smoking that they can't see this?"
NFLX still has a little loft left. Up she goes!
"From just over 2 USD in 2008 to 586,34 USD in 2021.Quite impressive."

Someone are donating $ to the brokerage banks by buying $581
Below 500 by year end. Sorry I had to edit it. But I would sell now. You will thank me for it.
Here's a good puzzle...netflix adds 1m customers roughly every 15 days...so how much is every block of 1m customers produced. Say right now at worst...every block of 1m customers is worth 1 dollar of share price. So we currently have 140m paying customers....so bottom 140/share and rising every 15 days. Good luck shorts. Z
This is just straighten out itself to move back up again. Start buying don’t let this short guys scare you. The BULLS are back and strong
"Giving the margin calls tomorrow, i van guarantee you 325$"
"I knew it will turn green soon so I can ad shorts its just 6,2% from my adding point."
Do you think this will split
Netflix has a good business model however profitability is highly elusive and competition is heating up. The closest analogy I recall is when Netscape was the dominant web browser until Microsoft came out and offered IE free. Things didn't end overnight for Netscape but in time IE won the war. Same thing is happening with competition from AT&T and Disney. Netflix could be bought out but only at a much lower price. Think about it.
We saw $375 last week. Hoping to see to $380 this week.
God have some mercy on us Friday.
this is actually going to break green today
There are zero examples of entertainment or tech companies EVER maintaining multiples like this with this kind of debt load. Debtflix has nothing in common with the cash generating juggernauts that make up the ither FANG stocks. They just needed an N for the acronym so it wouldn’t be politically incorrect.
"$GOOG $NFLX $WIMI Seems to have found some decent support, adding shares today."
Big players who knows earning leaks before report... Earning are huge and they are buying........ Get on the car and let's ride.
Netflix now has a market cap larger than the total wealth of 111 of the world's 166 countries. Makes perfect sense....
FANG stocks are in a correction process.
One day before options expiration day Eric decides to upgrade/ Coincidence much? These analysts are starting to have too much power.

Should open up +$10 tomorrow morning
"ATDS could soon be the security software , protecting user information this and many other tech companies... Just saying."
Come on baby
There is no reason for this to happen. If I had more money I would have bought more. Can someone tell me if they will cancel their NFLX submission if it is increased a buck or two?
"I am letting it ride. Buy your tickets, take your chances."
Nice run for a second day!
Up up and away. Nothing can stop the rise of NFLX! If NFLX is unable to borrow they can always float a secondary offering. Think how much content they could create selling shares for more than $400. That would make NFLX worth at least $500!
"It’s all about content spend, Disney has to quadruple just to catch up to Netflix which is way ahead and has almost zero content spending"
hopefully a big day to close out the week tomorrow
"I know it’s going to be back at 350, the question is when?"
Good luck to all holders. Cramer hasn't done you any favors tonite on his show (personally i find the guy a blowhard... but people seem to listen)
"Took my 40k in gains on my $397.5 , $400 and $405 Puts today and bought $5000 of calls expiring Friday for $390-400. Feel like it’ll rip back up very fast... if not, great week overall..."
it will be at pre earnings by the end of the week.
we will rise again.
"Average P/E of an SP 500 stock is around 12.9. NFLX's going-forward P/E is supposedly 129. Thus, NFLX's P/E is around 10 times the average P/E of an S&P stock. So, NFLX should be trading at 1/10th its current price, or around $34 per share, to be on an even par with OTHER S&P 500 stocks."

"If it opens tomorrow above 327.10 tomorrow, look for a GREEN DAY with a high hitting at least 336."
Pretty funny that folks bought this after market above 400
I may buy calls now. [11:23 am ET]
"Trading at 13 x revenue. Water always finds it's own level. Great that everyone is making $$$$ dollars now but at some time in the future, it will trade like CBS, Viacom and Disney and watch out below."
"Good news for FB longs and all ""Big Tech"" investors. Mike Santoli has proclaimed the end of FANG ($FB $AMZN $NFLX $GOOGL). In my years of following him, he's always been a great contrarian indicator. I guess FB will rally this week after all."
Triple top
I sold and took my profit .
I don’t know. I think it’s going to $320
"500 Today!Today would be a good day to release the secret partnerships with the other company insiders have been talking about. With all those new bonds they are pulling with the Big banks, not only will they be pushing new content, but new partnerships as well."
Doesn't look like nflx will save my portfolio today. It's all good though. No fear.
I'm curious to know the thoughts people have on the evaluation. give a thumbs up if its undervalued and thumbs down if it's over valued

Great day.
Looking perfect for a gap up tomorrow
I am raising target from 650 to 780 on this.
netflix and disney to team up to tackle global streaming.
NFLX will not miss. Expect a big numbers. Sorry shorties.
"If you missed the first run, this is a blessing. Don’t miss your chance. Fomo"
"Netflix is quickly approaching 150 million subscribers. It added nearly 9 million paying subscribers during the final three months of 2018, beating its own expectations of 7.6 million new subscribers. Netflix (NFLX) now has 139 million subscribers globally."
"shorts, do what you do best. lose money!"
See all you shorts at 330 friday
And...... Green!
No telling where this baby ends up today. Might be another $15.00 + pop. !!!
It won't be down for long.
To be promoted is also a matter of the next step $WIMI $NFLX
$1000 target!given its positive cash flow and rosy subscription growth---aggressive buy!
The went to the left and alienated half their subscribers. When will companies learn and keep politics out of their business models? Free fall to below $200 in just a few weeks folks and below $75 by 2019.
"These dips mean nothing. Netflix will continue to be leader in the streaming space. Disney will never manage to restore bargaining leverage.this mesaage board is now hopeless, should invest in mutual funds."
Bought 275 sold 302
Today is ridiculus
"It ""Showtime"" on Monday for AppleAmazon is a formidable competitor as wellDis going streaminga lot of new companies going to streaming, and in other countriesNFLX is a ""house of cards"""
"Everyone predicting the death of Netflix because of Disney plus, not sure if y’all have actually seen Disney’s + but for the most part it has extremely entertaining shows if you are under the age of 7. Also this 10 million subscriber number doesn’t take into account all the free one year trials. If something is free everyone will go for it."
Hey guys dnt ever sell ur shares after reading this chat board...people who are saying nflx will down are either shorting it or are regretting not getting on the train early on.. it will go past 615 next week without any doubt. Dnt forget nflx is buying back their shares. Goddluck!
I think it’s a small pullback back to 300 this week or next sure . Wait for a new upgrade . Don’t sell now
I guess streaming is a bit more than just having a good catalog.... https://www.cordcutters.com/disney-appears-be-down-some-users as I said before Netflix invests in the hardware by putting content locally and the software writing codexes that work even on connections that are bad. If you're into how the tech behind streaming works see here https://medium.com/netflix-techblog
"at least before Tuesday close, it is safe, another 5%"
It should be this:UPDATE: UBS Upgrades Netflix (NFLX) to Buy
"Correction typically means 10% down. Both Nasdaq and Dow were down more than that. So the correction cycle is over. Its rally time. My heart goes out to people who sold on Monday and this morning. Millions of people sold out cheap. Now they will be jumping back in due to ""being left out"" factor."
$NFLX PONZI SCHEME will COLLAPSE by 65% soon!
This move is all about pricing power. The last time they blew away subscriber estimates after raising prices the stock ran from 185 to 423.
I feel like this is a support group. Anyone else feel that way?
a 10-15 dollar haircut is in order
Good riddance to one-term grifter Donnie!
People just chill! Fed supposed to give minutes which has everyone on edge...plus markets went red....NFLX forecasting 9.4 million subscribers next Q...blew this Q out of the water!!
Honestly if I watch an hour or two of television a day it is on Netflix. I get to watch whatever I want when I want it is that simple. My kids go crazy if I turn on Direct TV Now because they don't get why there are only certain shows on at any given time. Netflix could double its rates tomorrow and I would still keep the subscription and I'm probably not the only one.
It's always nflx drops after the earnings! So I guess I'll buy just after the earnings!

Disney’s strategy only cements and validates Netflix dominance and sound business strategy. Disney only shouted to the world that Netflix is doing exactly what it should have been doing the past 5 years.....
Downgrade and MM is criminal actions and shall be prosecuted.
Cramer saying BUY BUY BUY right now
What happens when Netflix has to actually reduce spending on original content in order to stem billions in losses every year? Will the content get better at that point? I doubt it.
This continues tomorrow. Double digit losses.
$270 seems to be where the most option holders get hosed today....so let's see if this miraculously ends up right at $270 to close......
"Today I sold me Netflix shares with minor losses. I’m afraid this company is done. There will be more and more pressure from other streaming services (incl $AMZN, $DIS, $AAPL, $HULU, $GOOGL and other service). $NFLX is burning a lot of cash and the only strength they have is the number of subscribers which will decrease with the increase of competition/alternatives. More, today (the next day after Disney released their new streaming cheap service with great library!), Netflix announced increase of price [face palm]- I got an email. Last but not least, mostly, Netflix’s library of content is garbage - I have nothing to watch there. So, I do not see bright future for this company, but good luck to all those who are long here"
what's happening here today
so funny people calling for unity but they still are so negative on this board.shutdown soon movies a must.

Bottom line I've had Netflix forFREE 2.5 years. No revs from me.Used to be outstanding. Nowpretty boring. Actually PAIDfor a HBO MAX membership. 100% Satisfaction. If I owned this. I would be cautious ofpumping. Can't go up forever.
Sentiment from two weeks ago has not changed on this stock when it was at $385. It was the computer algos that sold it off in addition to the weak hands that took quick profits on that latest run-up. ZERO direct exposure to China. Stay strong longs and buy any weakness.
My 5Million Long position took a big hit tonight but i know this is a long play. They keep adding subs. do you know how hard is to add 10M subs? this will gradually go up long term. I see market cap of 1 trillion in 5 year.s

"Here’s the upside for Netflix. 5G rollout will by EOY will benefit Netflix push for mobile. Streaming gets cheaper every year and that adds up to Netflix bottom line. 5g will allow countries with slow internet speed to finally catch up to the west and it will spur innovation all over the world as we have seen with the rollout of 4G. We are looking at a new bull run in the US economy and many mini bull run on many nations which in turn will increase its middle class base which will directly benefit Netflix. We are looking at another 4 more years of additional bull run. If you doubt the 5g bull run projections, just look at the innovation spurred by 4G."
Hulu was just valued at $15 billion. Thats a problem for Netflix's valuation which stands at a staggering $165 billion including net debt. That is roughly 11x the valuation of Hulu.
Someone earlier said apple wants to buy Netflix anyone

"Started to accumulate this baby since it was $75. It's been a fabulous ride ~ . It's a great company with great products, having seen how it evolved over the years. Will continue to accumulate as NFLX expands its global business with new regional contents."
Market Cap is ~ revenues on the pandemic of the century. Amazing $AMZN $NFLX or Private Equity are delaying the takeover. Don’t bet on the short squeeze. Bet on vaccinations by summer.
Congrats longs!
"Reed Hasting is not reactionary, the moves he make has always been based on long term. He said it himself on one of his interviews, he said “its impossible to run a company based on quarterly earnings”. So the commitments he makes right now s to s3cure the future not as a reaction to quarterly earnings. As an example the the price increase is least likely due to recently quarterly earnings but more likely due to carefully planned price increase based on where they are now based on their projection. A price increase is based on a position of strength not weakness as some here would say."
"Spending 8 billion in content this year, unbelievable. This company's going to be the largest studio in the world passing Disney soon."
NFLX already guided higher during their Q earnings cc.....ROKU guided lower...wouldnt that mean that that NFLX taking their business? Will be interesting what disney says
I smell 400 before earnings...

350 will always be a cheap price for netflix. i will remind you again when its at 450....
"In 2016 Amazon, Hulu, and HBO combined sank 10 billion into content in an attempt to cut into Netflix’s lead. The stock stalled trading well below its high of 133 for over a year. Today Netflix is 342, yearly revenue has doubled since then and they’ve increased the huge lead they have in streaming. It’s time to face the music, Netflix competition is weak and will remain so as long as Reed Hastings is in charge."
433$ tomorrow hold tha stock.
The moment of truth
LETSSS GOOO GREEN
Don't do it...don't buy a single share. You've been warned.
happy for now however Netflix should learn from cable companies mistakes that price and product matter. increasing cost without increasing service result in declining interest.
It will take years to grown into this valuation.....wake up.
Oh my gosh.. wish I had cash to dump into this!! Flash Bargain??
Going bullish due to international expansion which Netflix virtually has no meaningful competition
"Moving back up in premarket, good volume"

You will see $320 very soon. This is solid business with $400 target price for 2018.

Last earnings report NFLX blew it out of the park. Anyone remembered what happened?
Should be at $450.00 soon.
"This pop is irrational, I am a long holder, don't ge me wrong I love it but there's no way it can be justified. Much better earnings reports of Netflix have yielded much smaller gains. This is part of the insane market right now. I wish it wasn't but it will correct."
$345 by tomorrow
75 cents though probably not real as they plan on borrowing $12 billion or whatever it is$3/$417 = > PE 190so the forward pE looks likke 190 instead of 90sell time
why up ah?
"Some time back, I bought Amazon, just before earnings report, at $400.00 a share. After they reported, it went down significantly, so out of fear, I sold. I think now, what it would be if I had just held on. Now over $1800.00. Hardest thing to do when investing in the stock market is to have patience. Don't look back some day and wish you had just held on to NFLX."
NFLX will succeed and prevail..hold the line

Ppl are so underestimate how tough this streaming game is and how expensive is it to retain customers and how many months of subs it takes to offset those cost. It’s easy to get ppl interested in a stream and go ‘WOW I LOVE IT’ but did you guys ever think of the scenario where someone sign up for Disney for a year or 2 and unsub as the kids age? Yes Disney put a lot effort with the whole 4 quadrant content and it is there. But is it really enough to make consumers stick? Getting excited about a stream and paying 3 months of it is very different to how Netflix retain their base

I still contend several biggies knew about the 2B note...waited until earnings sent it higher and imediately sold before the announcement of the 2B was made. Classic insider trading. Too many knew about securing the 2B and the stock reacted VERY funny from AH’s to close the next day.

Their foreign growth potential is through the roof and that is where the real future growth lies. India is just now is now just in the first inning and NFLX is well positioned there. A market much larger than USA. Ditto for Southeast Asia. The next two ER’s will be blockbusters (no pun intended) as Q3 and Q4 normally are and this current price will look dirt cheap. Amateur hour selling this morning and that’s why I bought in at the open and made $30/share. I am not a trader I buy and hold. This baby had a long way to go. IMHO

Up 12 dollars pre market!! Happy hunting today fellow longs. A moment of silence for shorts please..
Barclays says going to 245 soon. Nice
P/E 258 —- spends $12 Billion in content it doesn’t even own. Big quarterly burn
"Guys, i need your honest opinion. WHY would you choose NFLX at this current market with super high P/E ratio?"
it will drop back below 500 in a few weeks. no longer growing much and eps dropping. only sustained by jacking up monthly sub.

"Wow, positive 1.55 after hours.."
Good luck to everyone today....Let's end the Friday Slump....
Do you like to watch the lion king 50 times in a row and star wars cartoons with a banal plot and poor graphics paying $ 7 for this or the original diverse content of Netflix? Disney is growing due to crazy investor support and when the week passes we will look at the situation objectively
Was debating to sell 50% shares this morning. So happy that I didn't.
Short covering could take this over $290 again by tomorrow
Shorts need to cover ASAP...you got 15 minutes and the countdown starts.
Why did all the stocks across the board go down at 11:08 today?
afternoon turnaround anyone?
$FUBO buying now it’s like buying $NFLX first 2 years IPO I was in heavy trading many times pre split in the $1s to $2 levels. Some Ppl got way so scared back then when Netflix was losing money but the growths #s was real same thing $FUBO today. I always got in selloff.
What's that popping noise?
"At Netflix old subscription pricing I did not really care if I watch it or not, but now it is so expensive I have to think if I really need it?"
Get Some BABA too
increase subscribers without increasing profits. It is contradicting. Are they real subscribers?
52 week high on Monday. Good luck NFLX long.
At last the stock didnt justify its $80+ move in 3 months and was all HYPE.
Looks like we are going back-to-back FULL green days since Aug. 24 & 27 of last year.

"Up almost 20% in on day on mediocre report and forecast! Unbelievable. When everybody's buying, must be time to sell."

"This one is oh so simple. The great Covid 19 trade is in its first stages of unraveling. With the Stay at Home Orders lifted around the world, the great growth movement is gone. You're paying a fantastic premium to own a very old story. Same goes for Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, and many others hooked to these stocks. Best to be in stable VALUE stocks that pay decent dividends and not being chased by every 20 something with a few bucks on Robinhood."
HBO still bigger than Netflix on Pay TV and Hulu catching up quickly on Domestic.Hulu added 3 million in just 3 month and reach 20M+ compare to Netflix 55M.With recent partnership with Spot they going to get even more subscriber this 3 month.Now People can sure keep multiple subscription but when they paying for multiple they will think about rotating soon and when that start Netflix will have hard time keep 55M subscriber even.
Big guys manipulate NFLX today to scroop shares: hold it tight;don't let these big guys get your cheap NFLX shares:NFLX hit $1000 in three months!
"I bought Netflix, it went down 17%. I bought Apple, it went down 8%. I sold. It went back up. I bought Comcast, it went down 18%. I sold. It went up. I bought att. It went down 18%. I bought Facebook, it went down 9%. I sold. It went up. I never made a profit. I’m going to reassess Netflix, see if I can salvage anything, if not in the next few months, then I will sell. Withdraw all my money and quit my failing streak. This is a big blow. It shows I know nothing."
Crushes expectations...down 25%...makes no sense. Institutions are buying cheap while instilling fear in the clueless
Wow I have to say this is brutal just in the fact that if you didn't get in you felt bad. When you see moves like this it gives you the opportunity to make a boatload of money. Now we know what side to play for earnings or shortly there after. Hang on this is going down as fast or faster than it went up. I always say I don't know what I am looking for in a pattern or know which way a stock is heading but when it presents itself YOU WILL KNOW. This is one of those times.
"An open farce, content up $1.2B to over $13.3B and amortization. exp up $100M. Try to sell some of that $13.3B content and see what you get. Auditors went along with it when it was small and now they can't backtrack."

"What happened???!!!!going down too much..,"
way too sudden of a jump IMHO. wish I bought the dip but just shorted 600 shares for a quick gain tomorrow sell off it will most likely hit at the very least 540 easily hopefully 515 is the target though and then 500 buy into it if it hits that low. this thing always drops hard after such huge pop always.....
Andrew Left has that much influence over Netflix share price???
From buy to hold

Profit taking will occur today
More democrats = potential for net neutrality = good for Netflix ? Is this driving the stock?
It will go above 375 tomorrow after earnings call

"This is EXACTLY why Netflix remains the BEST OF THE FANGS! Fact is they REMAIN...The ONLY FANG to Beat Top, Bottom and Guidance! In addition where apple is starting to realize there may only be SO MUCH consumers are willing to pay for an I Phone(Now 1000-1500?) Netflix 1 Dollar increases here& there to improve content are barely perceptible!"
AH short covering rally that will be reversed in the AM. Competition now exists. Pricing pressures from alternatives. 5% short interest into earnings. It's all about the new subs and they meeting lower numbers.
Back to 330's by end week..
"Netflix expected to report 43% streaming revenue growth, the fastest in 5 years."
Is this really up 5% today over the Oscar win for Icarus?
"A company who has a bright future drops 10 or 20 percent is still a company with a bright future. So for those who is thinking of selling Netflix, ask yourselves why you bought the company in the first place? The fundamentals have not change, it is the weather that change and weather will change again. This is why the long term investors always wins"
William Blair's 2025 EPS valuation framework implies 20-percent upside in the next 12 months and a $660 share price by 2024.
Netflix will gain the remaining us cable subscriber during a recession. Netflix will gain HBO subscriber soon when HBO plays out game of thrones. Netflix will gain subscriber as it subscriber base grow in both US and International because they are just producing more content...this is just simple math. If you want to be Rich in 5 years just dump your money in Netflix. Don’t worry about Disney it will be 4 years before they can even thinking of international growth
looks like 50 plus tommomrow?
"Netflix sees ""5 billion more potential subscribers"" worldwide"
looking great moving forward. dividend tomorrow also.$GOOG $NFLX $WIMI

"NFLX went up very quickly from last quarter, even they issue debt of additional 1.5 billions. May go down same way."
put all your money in Netflix and just wait. u will be rich!
There seems to be a lot of angry shorts on this board.
NFLX is a streaming channel among many. Production companies are creating their own streaming channels to stream their own productions. The writing was always on the wall. Why else would NFLX invest so much in producing their own shows?! $150 billion is much too generous that's why NFLX has a lot of downside ahead of it.
wow look at it go
Thumbs up if you have a good feeling about this round. I do.
"if market goes up tomorrow. 11,202 open contract at 600 and 5,193 at 620..... should pop and then drop"
"One of the few stocks that does well in good times and bad. In bad times, people look to save money which accelerates cord cutting (because of the price gauging by cable companies) and simply going with netflix."
"here we go, green again"
Netflix will go way beyond no man has gone before to the moon
Tomorrow futures green this will rally big
Im happy i loaded a bit more shares again in the morning.
OK up 7.12% in 3 days and 6 billion in market cap. I was surprised it kept going up today. It's clearly tired here and I expect a small pullback tomorrow. Maybe finish around 204.35 going into the weekend. I look forward to another volatile day with this.
Dead money until 290s.
Eric Sheridan hosted their last earnings webcast and his questions were all softball and demonstrated no real insight into the company. UBS is obviously angling for a co-manager role in the next financing round for the company. I call FOUL!

"up til 10am EST, then the sell off. yesterday's more than 6% drop with a volume of 22M shares was no joke."

Great earning. Good to hold for long. I'm adding more.

split?
Picking up nicely
"More streaming does not equal more $$$. More streaming equals more cost. They have to pay AWS for compute and storage. People are tightening their belts, not adding Netflix. Cost are up, subscribers may even be down. $NFLX is overvalued."
"Be very cautious, pre and after-market trading don’t mean squat. Hopefully it holds, but I’ve experienced way too many times where it did the complete opposite when it started trading in regular hours."
All gains erased in after hours trading! Sad...something weird is going on!
350 seems to be the top for a bit. Many people came in for that amount a month ago. Now they are selling. After that who knows how high it will go.
Don't WORRY ... there's support at $220At the 150 DMA

"yesterday was ""KEY REVERSAL DAY"" for NFLX stock.....This is super bullish."
I think it might go to 650 this week
"If raising subscription prices was such an easy panacea, all companies would have done so. This is a competitive market and there's no telling what the effect will be. I consider it a negative as they cited rising costs, which means margins are being squeezed. Don't short because of the insane volatility in this stock but if you are long, I'd consider selling some, especially after this huge run-up on no news, which smells like a short squeeze."
"When would this recover? 1-2 years? I am long since it’s peak around 390 and wonder if it’s time to limit loses and move on or let it be. If good earnings and subscription growth did not move this stock up, what will?"
Anybody else looking forward to the ranch?....

I purchase October 2014. Today my gains reached 1000%. I remember the narrative back then was it was over priced. I bit the bullet and purchased. I’m ready for the next 1000% of this “overpriced” stock.
"Oh my! On this great news, The Cutied part 2&3 announced!"
"Why the drop today?Any news."""
I'm selling as soon as it reaches $1500 a share.
May be time for that epic thing.
"“As we generate excess cash we will explore returning cash to shareholders through ongoing stock buybacks”. Terrific, but my shares aren’t for sale Netflix."

Calling $500+ after 4Q earnings report in January 2019.
"NFLX is one of the companies which does not have many competition. Even if one wants to buy other platforms a study shows they too have NFLX. The customers and families throughout the world have adapted NFLX into their daily or weekly routine. This will double in the years to come. Its has a buy rating by many analysis. I too know this will have a ""20% gain at least"" within 2 years."
NFLX either has too many DVD subscribers or not getting enough disks. I've been a customer for years and now with 37 titles on my queues I can get even one shipped!
NFLX is a buy at any price. The NFLX rocket defies financial gravity. Traditional valuation metrics do not apply to this company because the the story is so overwhelmingly compelling.
350 seems to be coming today.
Yessir Netflix signing up millions at 50 cents a month in third world countries while jacking up prices in USA There’s a growth model worth every bit of a 150 PE!
I'm canceling my subscription. Just had a recent price spike. I assume others will follow.
Competition Has lower prices.
"So if they give away a billion free subscriptions and show 1000% “subscription growth” (lol) at the expense of zero margin and losses then the stock will shoot up 100x fold in one day, correct? Is this what people are chasing??? They missed eps by a mile because of that (just gave free or cheap subs) yet showed a “subscriber beat” so called and now added 20 BILLION to their market cap based on that?? Makes total sense in this incredible market bubble of course...keep on buying!!!"
"Since March 2020, the US Companies that report earnings, see at least 10% Jump in their stock price, no matter how terrible Earning/Loss report. $NFLX is getting PUMPED again, DESPITE Falling Earnings!"

Disney plus is advertising all over NFL games this weekend. This is really going to be a major subscription loss for Netflix.
"If you're long term, which hopefully you are, there is no need to sell at all"
What’s the value of 545 calls right now?
Many millions college kids in India have internet at homes but only small fraction of them has Nflx subscription. “Sacred Games” is a game changer for Indian TV!
Be ready for 345$ tomorrow
"Why no one discussing Citron report. In past he made headlines. 90% of his call turn out true. He is well known short seller Here is my contradian theory:- Clearly with At&t merger, Net naturality change, Netflix going to have tough time keeping up, On top of them, ISPs will demand share of revenue sooner or later to deliver to home.Big player want that and so they create big plan to push all retain investor into Stock and exit. Now They need time to slowly sell all those huge number of share they purchased and so they basically making sure report like this not become well known."
"With the rate of growth this has seen, don't be shocked if it plunges 10+% in a single day if bad news comes out."
"I just bought into NFLX before earning report. Should have sold at 380 cause it kept going down and down. sold with a few profit gain. couldn't hold on any longer. This way, i can jump back in if it goes down further without a wash sale. BUT I'm so close to retiring that I prob need something more conservative anyway…"
"Another early trading session sell-off, but it looks like that may be it. Heading to $370+ today, I predict."
Great day! I always regretted not purchasing Netflix and today was my chance. I will keep these for the longer term :-)
"NFLX WILL INCREASE INTO TODAY""S CLOSE. THIS STOCK IS EXTREMELY BULLISH!!!"
"I anticipate bankers selling 3 days before the next earning but NFLX went up so much in last 2 weeks, bankers will take profit. The selling will probably happen this week then another round of going up and selling before earning in July."
"I have been a follower, and, stock holder of NFLX for quite a long while. Mostly, I traded the stock. Made some gains. I wish that I had held my initial position. Currently, I hold a very small position ahead of earnings. NFLX continues to be a long hold, especially, considering their international expansion aspirations. All this talk about the 8 billion they spend on content, is, just too nearsighted. Good luck to all!!!"
huge earnings in 7 days! 550+ coming
Whoever shorted Netflix this morning when it was $341. Lol thanks for your cheap shares. Now you I can take a quick profit while you cover your short.
"People, if you are still short nflx, you should be really scared. When the Dows fell 400, and nflx is up 1.4% , it speaks volume."
anyone else need advice on what to do?
Just buy Netflix and chill. This bad boy will be back in 400 land before you know it
bought 30 calls ---strike price305 ---April 20th---- for 14.71- at 3.30 pm---feeling good.
this thing is headed for 550..
Hearing that $AMC is possibly coming out with streaming service to compete with $NFLX
come on 500. This is the next hollywood.
there will be definately a huge dip before going to 600
Listen closely...Price targets are meaningless. Determining fair value on a price tag via retail investors and traders are just based on what everyone is willing to pay for that equity. Cult following here WILL weaken soon. That’s a guarantee! This IS extremely overvalued at these price tags. Take it fwiw...VA
"Question: What is taking the U,S so long to impeach Trump?"

By Friday $390.
It’s up 2$ after hrs
Netflix is producing much more movies than everyone combined with a very high degree of success.....that is what Disney or anyone else has to be in order to compete with Netflix. All that money and old movies is not going to change that.
"Cohn resigns, nflx goes up by 30"
People have said this stock is all about subs and they are right But it’s also the reason I won’t buy here. The first half of 2021 is a tough compare.
"Citron shorted NVDA last year and $140 and went short again this year at $230. They try and time 3% pullbacks to make a quick buck. Andrew left tweets that he's short, CNBC puts him on tv for minutes, and the stock drops 3%. Rinse, repeat. Thanks for playing."
buy the dips?
"WHILE SO MANY businesses had to shut down, NFLX always open for business.24/7. GO NFLX "

"Netflix has highest content in global market to attract all customers from different countries . Netflix has become the part of comcast ,Verizon and other carriers as bundle key inclusion .

"my thoughts and prayers to everyone who sold at a loss in the first 30 mins. the selloff is over, let the FOMO begin!"
Sell
"We are looking at another day like June 27. Open +8.17, high was +12.12 ended -9 for the day.Only day since July 18, 2016 it opened +6 and finsished in the RED....."
The markets were rough / oversold and took down the stock among other tech / financial stocks. I think $NFLX will have a better quarter than last. Hoping the markets are on the mend.
i sold At $420 and bought Disney shares
Just watched Jingle Jangle on Netflix.I'm not into Christmas movies. I don't like musicals but this is a stunning movie. Love or hate Netflix; After Klaus they just prove again they don't have to fear Disney.
Curious do people still buy NFLX at these prices? I was going to buy some put options but it is extremely expensive so I guess I am not the only one thinking this is going to drop hard in the next couple of years?
bought a couple 400 sept 21 calls hope it keeps going upany prediction I feel 400 next weekthe big players want this over 400
NFLX reached a new All Time High at 304.20
450 next week plz
"Longs, just remember. This trades on sub growth. The bogey for next quarter is 6.4M. They did 8.1M last quarter. They always beat on sub growth. When that happens, this will pop once again."
"Best 3 day total since July 5,6 & 9 (+28.45)Last 3 days +27.66. This run started when it reached 310.81 on Monday.Can we make it 4 days in row?Last 4-day winning steak was July 11-14 on the way to 423.21 on July 21."
All that AH action because of one analysts upgrade. Absolutely proof the market is manipulated and valuations are not realistic. Nothing against Netflix...just sayin. An upgrade shouldn't make a stock instantly shoot up. A good ER that proves a company has done well is more of a catalyst you can hang your hat on.Just my 2c
this will hit 600 tomorrow hopefully split 10-1and we buy lower.........
The money is flowing out from Netflix to other sectors. It is about time. NFLX is dangerously expansive. Defense sector should be a safer investment
This is the time in the market where I stop paying attention to stocks. A bunch of institutional traders are following each other like sheep in order to boost their bottom line for Christmas bonuses. No reality is involved here. So I just wait them out and maybe scope out some buying opportunities.
"btw, Longs...don't fret. NFLX is fine..."
1000 by year end
Short squeeze tomorrow is going to be epic!
why would this crash with double average daily volume already sold at 565?
I am sure the Obamas will be Proud of you when the #$%$ the $$$ off the table and your left looking like a CNN reporter.

Zero reason toBe long anymore this 15 year old theme

"It is ridiculous that good earning can be erased the following day by the personal opinion of some investment firm. Business is about results, not hypothetical outlooks that are unfounded. I will continue to buy if the weakness continues."
Hear me out... shouldn’t Netflix Buy Game of Thrones... milk it for more money on Netflix with spin-offs. After some time when Netflix makes a bit load more money they can open up a theme park and they have really good stuff in their portfolio... in this case (GOT). Stranger things... and other Netflix hits could be rides and experiences in the parks. Netflix Food originals? Boom restaurants and shops.... the amount of money they could make on parks is huge in the future. Thoughts
When NFLX keeps going up
any opinions on what strike we pin tomorrow?
"Reed Hastings decimated the Blockbuster Video model, revolutionized the DVD rental market, then introduced the world to streaming videos & created an empire with few barriers to entry at the time; Peacock, Disney, AMZN Prime, etc. are only some of the competitors moving forward, and Europe certainly isn't going to be the driver for NFLX in the near term; it was good while it lasted, they won't disappear anytime soon but their trajectory for growth in the New World Economic (catastrophe) seems strained"
Go green..
Any know how the PE ration of NFLX? It's a whopping 227 and not counting AH gain. Why in the world anyone would want to buy this stock?
Was a late winter....obvious gonna get more subscriber growth with more people staying in.
"If you are a shareholder, you can sell covered calls at any strike price for any time frame depending on your cash flow needs, risk tolerance and time horizon.If stock is taken; so what!You made 20%. At close, NFLX Jan 20 $400 calls sold for $88 tax deferred cash per share This is a stres free way of investing."
"Amazon almost caught Netflix several years ago and then Netflix pulled away. Now Disney will try it. They have no choice, streaming is the only thing the stock market is willing to reward them for."
Back to $230
are you guys ready to beat er???

Disappointing to see this before earnings.
Hard to hold

The main thing Netflix is not saying about its huge miss with subscribers loss is the fact many people including me dropped Netflix due to Netflix signing a 50 million dollar deal with the socialists Obama's. That SOB added over 10 trillion to our nations national debt of 20 trillion. All Obama has to show adding over 10 trillion debt to the backs of Americans is nothing except a weaker military when he left office. Netflix will continue to go down once more in stock price when more Americans find out about Netflix signing up the Obama's to give us there socialist opinions. Sell short and you will make money.

"The last I posted about Pi, it was trading unofficially at $0.2x per coin and that is now all the way up to $0.8x and there are over 10 million miners/pioneers mining coins on their phones.Before you skip the post thinking it's useless for you, check out where BitCoin is trading today. It's over $24,000 per coin. I am not saying that pi will be that successful, but what if it even reaches $100 per coin in the future? Even if you can mine 1000 coins by the mainnet launch the next year, those coins can be worth a significant amount of money.In any way, you NEVER have to pay anything to anyone to mine pi, it's open for anyone to mine on their phone as BitCoin was in earlier days. Just download the app on your phone, use invitation code ""celebration26"" when registering (it's by invitation only), and make sure to use your legal name as when they assign the coins to your wallet in the future, they will verify that if you are the person who you said you are.As far as my progress, I have mined so far about 10k coins which unofficially are worth about $8k and possibly can be worth much more when the mainnet is officially launched and the pi starts trading on crypto exchanges officially."
This has been trading sideways for 6 months. It’s about time it breaks out 600+
I am hoping for a strong push back up to the day's high by the closing bell today.
I guess NFLX likes higher interest rates. Shows what I know. I thought higher interest rates would put downward pressure on the stock price.

Traders unwinding but will close up nicely.
Down over 30% from high
"Peaking stock price of NFLX is a thing of the past. It has very very limited scope of rising from above this level. It has lost its monopoly. Original content can be produced by other competitors as well.With surplus cash, Apple can be a winner in the race. Disney content going away from Netflix can prove expensive to Netflix. Stock price will remain in this level or will drift down when Market correction happens."
so beautiful to see drop like this
"Need advice from options traders: I bought Aug 395 calls this morning. As nflx sank, I bought more to average down, and then bought more again to get my cost basis down. Im in do 19k and am already down 2k. I hate that I am holding these options overnight. Am I screwed?"
This is the time to put your money where your mouth is. If you sub to Netflix you are supporting the distribution of the film Cuties. Also if you own the stock you are supporting the company that allows a film like this to be streamed. The best thing to do in this situation is to stand up for what’s right. I understand there are other shows that you might like on Netflix but we all need to draw the line and take a stand. ACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER THAN WORDS.
One of the best stocks to buy right now! Will be loading up as soon as the market starts
This is excellent Results. Netflix has absolutely no competition. That is why growth is coming like awesome! World wide domination!
I can't imagine who is selling but I really can't imagine who is buying...Did any banks call their margins?! Yeesh
"Remember folks, Netflix was $420 just a month ago."
Netflix has 12 of the top 20 TV shows according to Rotten Tomatoes. Competitors aren’t generating enough revenue from TV to cover the cost of content. NFLX is buy under 600.
Hahaha the low today was $346 so this is a normal intraday move for this stock
"What do you guys think? Is it time to sell and cash in? It is a way overextended rally in no time! I'm up $50M since December 2018. I'm going to cash in EOD anyway but, Your sincere thoughts are welcomed. $NFLX $AMZN $AAPL $AMD $NVDA $CSCO $SQ $SHOP"
"i think today could be the for short term rebound. if I see NFLX at -$13- 15 and AMZN -$60-80, within 30 mins after opening"
"When analysts say 40% of chance that AAPL will buyout NFLX, it implies that the chance is 80%: AAPL will takeover NFLX to compete with AMZN, DIS. The premium may be around 30-40%."

Too many $400 calls expiring tomorrow. Might breach it but will retreat very quickly. I do see it going up steadily next week as earnings approach.
"If media, analyst or regulator like FBI discover that millions of account paid mysteriously other than real user, what will happen to stock? Just wondering?"
@MR What strike price on April 18 calls would you take?
440 close ? LOL
Will breakout to new highs for the simple reason that nothing has changed from the previous times it broke out to new highs.
"got, you make a good point. Piggybacking off that, the 10 largest Nasdaq companies (NFLX is like #8) are now worth much more than the entire German economy and closing in on Japan, the 4th and 3rd largest economies in the WORLD. Really? Day of reckoning is coming for sure."
"Weak hands, profit taking are perfect today, on way to $610 next week. Easy money."
NFLX moves up 9$ today. Yeah longs!! And mms
This needs to start kick like amazon. Everyday green. Let’s start the fire back on. This should be 600.00
All the streaming services combined aren’t as much competition as cable TV was.
"All of their content is available through the backdoor, aka Torrent."
"I think I figure out how to benefit from biggest very openly done fraud without being long and risking money. So let this continue. Longer it continue, more I benefit. Why waste time & energy expose, possible risk from criminals who might frighten to death when I can make money since no one seems to care here."
"loving that I was able to get into position at 325...I'd but here too...this is the future of entertainment, the New Hollywood!"
"NFLX price to sales 5 year average is around 6. Right now it is around 13. So 200 is not out of the question. But with 8 billion in streaming obligations and 9 billion in debt they need to do something. They are playing a tightrope game before the competition picks up. Really, a 160B dollar company and they dont even have a good browser. I have to use an app just to figure out whatthey have on streaming. Come on."
remember the promise monitory mask first hundred days. shut down soon grab a blanket watch a movie.
Netflix will 320 soon
Sentiment is so negative with traders...easy buy before ER. Good luck NFLX!
480 tomorrow EPS missed earning missed
quiet over here today....

"Netflix is using Amazon web services to host their content. Time for a change of providers. Amazon can't be trusted. Move the content away, or build your own servers."

Hulu has over 27 million subscribers compared to 139 million paid subscribers for Netflix. So Netflix has slightly more than 5x the subscribers of Hulu. Yet Netflix is valued at 11x the value of Hulu.
Deutsche Bank raised price target to $400...says NFLX is becoming a cultural phenomenon...that's huge
"Goldman Sachs — conviction buy rating, target price to $420 from $460“As Netﬂix’s content investments, distribution partnerships and marketing spend drive subscriber growth signiﬁcantly above consensus expectations and the company approaches an inﬂection point in cash proﬁtability, we continue to believe shares of NFLX will signiﬁcantly outperform. We remain Buy rated (on CL), though we lower our 12-month price target to $420 from $460 to reﬂect our revised estimates.”"
NFLX party under Trump is over. This will be under $100 next year. Too much debt.

"$SQ $NVDA $NFLX Since drop has begun about 3 months ago, it takes about 7-10 days from a new low to rally and then reach new lows again. This Friday will be that timeframe again.

This is a sell the rally market now, not a buy the dip market. Trade accordingly"

"""One of the most dangerous things to happen in financial markets is to be right for the wrong reasons. If you fail to recognize that you were lucky, then you will continue to make investment decisions based on faulty reasoning, and eventually your luck will run out."""
"How many people on this board not only invest but consume Netflix? I just finished streaming ""Collateral,"" a British Crime thriller and it was amazing! An immediate trailer that followed was another original Netflix series, only this one is a Japanese Anime. This puts into perspective for me why their subscribers and stocks are soaring. I'm a LT investor (invested when it was $88/share)."
"Of the 12 most popular TV series released in 2017 and 2018 Netflix has 9, HBO has 1, Hulu has 1, and FX has 1. That pretty well says it all."
"This will go up big today, earning after hour and giving the record and history of nexflix people will want to get in before earning. After earning, this thing will rocket up to the moon"
The P/E ratio is over 200 where in reality it should be n/a. The free cash flow bologna is an accounting trick that Netflix uses. They are hemorrhaging cash. If they put content spend above the bottom line like every other company who has ongoing operating expenses an investor would get a much clearer picture that this company is losing TONS of money and will continue to lose tons of money as long as they employ this business model. It’s really a catch 22. Continue content spending hemorrhage cash. stock eventually goes down. Pair down content spending. Subscribers bail stock tanks. It’s a lose-lose scenario. It’s a broken business plan
Content King!
HBO Max is better than Netflix in my honest opinion.
buy in the dips
Netlifx bought a huge positive review campaign into IMDB.But The Witcher isn't a new GoT. Actually a far from it.
Market manipulation to burn calls for tomorrow.
"Subscribed ESPN+ and it's great. Work very well. Navigation is good.you can watch live games, Some great documentary movies, NFL Draft series and more. ( I think they going to limit 1 game /day but you don't watch more than that)I think this may be helpful to Streaming service like Netflix, it prove there is no technology advantage Netflix has. And Content clearly Disney is still king and with Fox deal going to remain that way.So I am not sure how people think Netflix can handle competition from Disney and Apple and list of other. At Best case scenario, people rotate service. Worst case, people subscriber on Service like ESPN and very limited money left for Service Like Netflix.Think if you have 200M subscriber but only for 3 month out of year that's just 50M subscriber. Netflix might get custom to service rotation as quality streaming service grow."
A big misconception is Netflix got big because they never had serious competition. Hulu (Disney Comcast) along with Amazon had to be serious competition for tiny Netflix back when. It only makes sense being the major media company it is today Netflix competition has to be weaker than ever. It will be confirmed when the stock rises to 1000 next year.
IT WILL FLY FLY FLY DONT MISS OUT ON THIS SALE PRICE
The stock is great but all the negative attention is just a drag to wait it out. The Netflix train is slow to climb in price followed by a long long slow bleed

Wait till the real selling begins tomorrow.
"Been in NFLX stock for the long haul, excellent content coupled with mg'mt being mostly ahead of its various peers. I bought some AMC with some recent proceeds with talk that Netflix could have some interest in this beaten down theatre/entertainment Co. What better way to get your original films on BIG screen across the USA and promote all your other content."
"Some day the entire market will just consist of NFLX as it never goes down. And that makes perfect sense. Perfect. Who else will be able to stream content but NFLX? And that $12 Billion in debt which isn't listed on the balance sheet won't ever matter, even after DIS takes all of its content off NFLX and starts its own streaming service. NFLX RULES!!!!!"
If you don't believe in this company then you probably should get out and leave the board! I am in this for the next 10 years or more! Cost basis $270
"We were set up by the market to buy into what ""they"" already knew. When Warner, Disney and the rest of them pull content and launch there own streaming service Netflix will pull back further unless we improve profit margins. imho"
wasn't this at $600 after earnings?? That sure didnt last long.... im a buyer at $250. wont be long now.

There are no salary caps in the TV and film business. Sports leagues have salary caps to enhance competition. Netflix with 20 billion in streaming revenue (181 billion over the next 5 years at current growth rate) is buying the streaming championship.
just picked up 1500 shrs. shutdown 2 coming.
selling? why...LOL
If you want to short—-dont short the stock. Short by buying puts or selling calls. It avoids short short squeezes. Do yourself and othrs a favor.
"If raising subscription prices was a panacea, then all companies would do it. The impact of Netflix price hike is not only in the short term when people call to cancel their subscription (that number is likely low) but mostly long term: when new consumers are faced with choices, they will always go for the lowest priced, even if it's by a couple of bucks per month, as they view it a commodity.Also NFLX sounded the alarm on rising costs which bodes ill. In short, yesterday's pop was pure momentum, it should have been a negative."

"We will see what the bottom is. And where it goes from there. I am still a firm believer of this company. Have 205 @186 i bought a while back. And now 40 extra @ 336. Netflix grows very fast, content is getting better and better. And kids don't know any better these days then that Netflix is available. They grow up with it. Just like Mc Donalds, Coca cola etc."
Huge short squeeze
400$ after ER or higher possible
Netflix expected to quit burning cash. Cash flow positive going forward.
Since when does an investment analyst serve as a moderator at a quarterly earnings call? And questions are submitted in advance? Does anyone other than me understand how inappropriate this is?
reading all these people saying it will pop crash and drop means it will sky rocket
Getting ready to buy calls again.There will be one more dips.
Below 500 by years end
Looks like the mm wants to keep it around $350.
This market has become brutal.
"out Netflix at $63 a share few years back. Sold it at $410, wish I would have waited to $423, but made a nice profit. Bought again today. I think its going up. With the stock market in the toilet people will not have money tgo out with. They will stay home to save money, and watch Netflix. I also bought a lot of Walmart too. If we do head into a recession, people won't stop shopping, but just adjust to a discount store. Made a lot of money last recession with Walmart."
Looking like new highs today - shorts covering before bell!
Ha. I'm gonna make so much money after Netflix 3Q tomorrow! You all stay scared and keep selling.
"with a buyin at 45, I'm ok with holding on longer."
Any online game from Netflix yet ?? It will be huge.

SimilarWeb just updated their data and december was a very big jump with 2.09 Billion web traffic that month. its not the apps just the netflix.com webpage.

"More likely trading on the technicals today. It overshot the 50 day on the way up, it failed and it came back down under the upper Bollinger band on the 1 year chart (roughly $364). Give this another day or two for the bollinger bands to start heading higher and it should be fine."

"Words around that there's boycott for NFLX since Rice become board of director, follows by Obamas multi year's deal. Is that true? If this continue I think NFLX may go down further. Overseas subscribers maynot follow through, there maybe more competition for domestic overseas that we don't know but NFLX and some may now."
"There are MANY.... cash rich global companies that can build or buy content...... Because of this reality, NFLX is extremely vulnerable going forward. As estimates in the outer years decline, so too will forward multiples...... This process has just started.Prepare thy self"
Impact from 16 million new subscribers starting to sink in.

I picked up a 362.5 call today expiring Friday for $4.88. It's now doubled but i have some questions. Put options are crazy expensive right now and their implied volatility is through the roof. Are we gonna see a sell off tomorrow morning? I see below some people talking something about fraud. Can someone explain that to me since i'm new here? Thanks!
It will reach 300 in two weeks.
So you still want to short NFLX? Good luck buddy!
"well there is good and bad news. The good news is NFLX wasn't down today. The bad news is the downside pain isn't over. We know this based on how people on here reacted to ok news. A truce is not a deal. People calling for a $40 one day pop (just silly), $350 by EOY (even more silly) and the always funny death to the short cries. You must reach pessimism before you start climbing back up. I am not sure we are even close to that yet."
New high this week or $340+!
"LOL @ Netflix. When your biggest competitor is Amazon.com, should your stock trade at 300 times earnings? Nope! You should have a bankruptcy lawyer on speed dial. It's hilarious that Netflix trades like a world-beating monopoly. When in fact they compete against the deadliest and richest competitors on the planet: Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon. Will Netflix survive? Sure, quite possibly. But should Netflix trade at the most expensive valuation of any company in the market? LOL. Just ask Excite, MySpace, Nokia, and Barnes and Noble! Competing against any ONE of Google, Facebook, Apple, or Amazon tends not to be fun or fruitful. Competing against all of them at once is REALLY not fun! I wonder if Netflix could possibly revisit its 2017 levels? In 2017 the stock traded in the 100s all year. Now, just 15 weeks later, it's trading in the 300s! Is this a permanent change? To revisit the levels of just a few months ago, NFLX stock price would get cut in half. Gulp."
What is going on with this stock? Great earnings announcement and just keeps going down?
It will go up tomorrow
Who got in at $592??
"“Hello, this is your margin call for today....” we got to 350-352 this week"
Best earning ever
Let's hope it closes green today
I guarantee you this. Anyone who leave Netflix will come back to netflix! They get board of the other platforms in 2 weeks
There is bound to be a 3-5% pull back on this
"Wow I just watched CNBC interview ( I was out this afternoon). Look Andrew must upset some big players.Wow they refuse to recognize fundamental of Investment:- ValueWhen Andrew said Netflix gone ahead of itself (Which mean overvalued) they all coming after that's not fundamental reason to make call. If Their growth slowing or something like that then it understandable.So Stock being overvalued is not issue and All those analyst and media pumping people into over inflated stock like nflx and $AMZN is god gift but When someone speak with sense, it's nonsense.

Hear that sound? Thats billions of people shutting down their tvs this spring! Pe compression gonna crush u $nflx $roku $spy streaming bubbke
santa clause rally is on!!
At one time AOL metrics and market cap were eerily similar to NFLX.As subs started declining AOL went from 300 a share to 2$ in a matter of a year!Hilarious fact!
So NFLX has the same Market Cap as ATT. So if HBO Max gets 100M subscribers in one year it should be worth $1T. So how do these valuations work?
"Sell NFLX and buy ROKU! It's going to 1,000 in 2021!!!"
He comes the selling. EPS is an issue.
"@Alen- Glad to hear common sense prevailing. At this point NFLX is totally immersed in people's lives. Even the bears can't argue that point. And the pleasure that people get from watching what this company puts out literally costs them less then 50 cents a day. If people want to add Hulu or Disney+ along the way then they'll simply pay $10 to add a second streaming service. That's under $25 a month for multiple streaming services. People spend that at Starbucks during the course of a week or the first 2 hours at a bar on a Saturday night. Like you said... no one is cancelling their NFLX subscription to redirect 15 freaking dollars elsewhere for a different streaming platform. Bottom line: Stay long, ride the subscription wave to 200 million worldwide, ride the 800 pound gorilla that will start printing money within 3 years which every analyst under the sun has been saying. Sometimes the easiest money can be made in the simplest of stories. The NFLX story is as simple as they come. In a short time there will be almost a quarter of a billion people paying $15 a month to watch content that they are obsessed with. A story doesn't get any more beautiful than that."

Apple not buying Netflix - Can this be interpreted that there is no limit on the up side (in the longer term)?
$494? now that is funny Netflix can get new subscribers
About time to see some green after 4 long days of nothing but red. This really needs to finish over $362 today.

"For all who have only very negative things (almost hateful) to say about nflx, if you don’t like the stock, move on. Why waste your time posting this stuff. There can be thoughtful dissent and disagreement but I’m hearing a lot of folks getting emotionally worked up. My advice; find a stock you like and make some money on what you believe is positive news. Amazing how much energy is wasted on something you are seeing and getting no benefit from. DAW"
Content is king.....NFLX is king of content......Shares will climb it is a matter of time.....NFLX should acquire rights on 007.......That will be amazing!!!!!!
what's the bottom? $350? or this is it?
I don't know if anyone noticing but I do notice that retail buying is not as much as those manipulator expected even after so much push by their media friends and Analyst friends. I really hope they end up very badly because such manipulation is never healthy for stock market.
"This stock has been a total dud for me. Ive owned it for a while now, and even picked up more recently. The market cap IMO is a little too low. Im not sure whats keeping it down, but Ill wait..."
Goldman Sachs is angling for the lead underwriting role in the next capital raise by Netflix. Cash on the balance sheet will drop below $2 billion when NFLX reports on Jan 17. NFLX will need to raise more capital to fund another $3 billion in cash losses in 2019.
"Netflix would be unbeatable if they acquired a broadband company. If you want people to completely cut the cord, offer Internet + Neflix outside of any cable or dish program. I would jump on that in a minute. I hate having to pay my cable provider for Internet just so I can use Netflix."
"The Los Gatos, California-based company posted revenue of $4.19 billion, falling short of estimates of $4.21 billion for the quarter. The company reported diluted earnings of 30 cents per share; however, it is not immediately clear whether this is directly comparable to the 24 cents expected by analysts.The company also said it foresees fiscal first quarter revenue of $4.49 billion, lower than the expected $4.6 billion."
bubble has burst so aggressive sell off is over. Buy with confidence across the whole market.
"i like it as a long term, I basically live in my home cinema and I am a young guy that has stuff going for me. If you can't see profit here you didn't read this."

Can anyone explain how company expect $31.1 per subscriber in 2018 quarter when They only make $28.75 last quarter.Is another price increase. Is this company getting too much comfortable with value they provide?
Dam trying hard to stay red everyday but eventually it’s going to give in and turn green for days. I love Netflix 400 soon
Watch NFLX drop in October when Disney begins their media campaign just prior to the launch of Disney+.
If we get 4.5% up today we may catch another 5% shortly and settle $333.
"See no point is selling Netflix to take my profits. I only need to hold 90 days to 4Q and we will be at or closing in on $450. Amazing company, utterly dominating steaming. I'm not saying their lead is insurmountable, but they are here to stay for quite some time. Enjoy the money friends."
"Funny thing is, there isn’t that much shares short... so it’s not the squeeze. Just hype."
"Goal, holding NFLX now till it's over $400.00."
Oh my going above 380 today. Break and see you at 400 tomorrow

CNBC said NFLX is $300 stock. Every quarter Nflx went down for many days after earning even after initial pop. Not surprised if this is under 300 tomorrow. Sell !!!
SPLIT COMMING
Does anyone remember what happen to zoom after earnings?
"$GOOGL was going to change gaming forever in 2020, look up what they did to stadia one year after launch. Streaming games isn't happening any time soon. Downloading & streaming isn't an option due to ISP restrictions (download caps) in a majority of US and across EU. Do your DD. Who do you know that streams games? To be clear, I don't mean stream their gameplay to others, stream their game $NFLX style."
Why is insider ownership in NFLX only....1.81% ?
It is not a trap it is a bubble that will come down hard.
May I have a dividend please? What... No positive EPS. Sounds like a dot com
"Beginnners' luck? The first time I bought shares in my life was on January 22, 2018, Netflix, early morning, for 222,000 USD. I swear."
if does not hold @307 might drop till 270
NFLX now has 6 PT upgrades today ranging from 585 - 700
Netflix was and always be he king of the jungle
Well that was easy
Nothing but a casino. That's all the stock market is. Yesterdays gains...whoosh.
Everytime i want to jump in it goes up more and more and more
Fair value $450
"Time to sell the news. NFLX has had a great run, but I think the Oscars just might be a short-term top today. Just sold 400 shares in pre-market. Will look to buy back in if it hits low 340s. GLTA."
Easy short here. Watch this break 300 handle tomorrow.
"People are forgetting one thing here. With big media launching streaming services cable TV will be riding off into the sunset sooner than expected. Cord cutting will spike. Netflix’s growth, which has come at the expense of cable TV should get a boost."
Ha to 600 she goes !!!
Man. All FANG have been a big zero for six months. If nothing moves this ER round it’s certainly time to move on.

"All the Good Content They have to Purchase, if they get every single Human, Alien, Animal in the Universe, you still cannot Grow into this Valuation."
"My friend has 2,000 shares of NFLX when NFLX = $411 in 6/22 value =$822,000. He bought NFLX at $364. In 6/25 he panicked and sold all his 2,000 shares at $392 and cashed out $784,000. Now NFLX closed at $401.40 after hours and if he buys NFLX at $401.40 he will recoup only 1,953 shares. Should he buy immediately when the stock market opens or wait til the price drops to at least $395 if ever it will, Or you think it will? What's your advice?"
Everyone should have bought the dip that went to 490 - this is a guarantee smash after earnings - it will hit 575 easy
I promise I will never short this stock again. Learnt it the hard way
"Some nut on CNBC said 'sold half my shares, I'm still in the game"". Sounds good but how does this NUT feel now that this WINNER is up almost 9% after hours. 9% is a great gain for the YEAR let along for a few minutes!"
350 this week
A trading buddy asked me the other day about NFLX and where I got the pick. I told her to check out (http://Thetraderguide.com). That’s where I get 95% of my winners.
and the sell off begins. Everyday like clockwork
An amazon prime membership which includes prime video is cheaper and provides superior value. I dropped Netflix for this reason.

"Bullish crossover in MACD and Stochastic oscillator, according to foxchart. Looking for breakout at 355."
Why the beating???
After the beautiful conference call I’ll be shorting again if any shorts are still available
I like netflix as a service and investor. But swing trading this thing I shorted it all the way up to 593. What people don't realize is it surged way too high and fast for the short term..... the potential buybacks are not for sure and won't be for a long while. They are also in a catch 22 with covid since the subscribers have surged due to covid but they are also running much behind on new content also due to covid = catch 22. I have already watched everything I can possibly find on there and I'm cancelling after the second price increase for the service taking place only a few months apart until they have a ton of the new anticipated releases which all have no actual dates on them. I think many will follow like myself and no way this price keep sup this high until it dips way lower. Though I do think it will come back up but maybe not until end of year.
I still say $390 by end of week!!
"Most of the subscribers are from through third party vendor, like Verizon and Sprint and T-Mobile that bring no money so even very conservative EPS and ER missed.You can mute me but can’t mute truth. "
"With competition so high, how come analysts still think the subscriber numbers gonna stay the same. The will go down for sure. There’s not point in this stock going high. Longs gonna get burnt soon"

"Goldman raise price target from 390 to 490:-Here are reasonsin 2018 Ebitada will 2138M ( in April 18 when he raised price target, it was 2131M, so up 7M)IN 2019 Ebitada will 3509M ( In April 18 report it was 3652M so going down 143M)2020 both are same.So because Ebitada going down in 2019, It must worth 490 instead 390."
Should I buy net shares before earnings come out? first thing in morning? or wait for earnings.
Just picked up 900 shares at 283 and will be dumping soon. Easy money. Thank you
"Keep the faith longs! The bar to entry for over-the-top streaming is very high. DIS and T are trying to compete late 2019, but will take time to get any momentum going. T has not been able to monetize the assets they already have. DIS will initially be a niche player for a certain demographic, unless they start to produce their own content. Youtube premium maybe showing signs of trouble (placing ads on original content).NFLX is already anticipating the competition in 2019 and is already ahead of the game. They are arguably the best platform for the widest range of multi-screen devices. GLA"
Netflix = Netscape
This @SquawkAlley interview with the producer of “The Office” is very ominous-sounding for the $NFLX story. Almost a quarter of Netflix viewing in the US is legacy sitcoms?
"THEY MISSED, GOING TO 300"
WOW Subscribers must be falling because everyone in Turkey can't pay for Netflix subscription.
"2/7/18- ING BUYS NFLX SHARES-Can there be much more upside in Netflix after a 55% gain in 2017? Apparently yes, as, stranger things have certainly happened. ING has made a tentative investment in the streaming service by buying 4,200 shares in the fourth quarter. Shares have already soared nearly 40% so far in 2018, given a boost by reporting earnings that topped even heightened expectations."
570 BY TOMORROW PROMISE U SHORT SQUEEZE
382 before earnings. Said it a while back and say it again.
Bernstein says Netflix should easily get to 90M US subscribers and John Malone says scale going from US to global is 10x which means Netflix should easily get to 900M subscribers.
Held sideways all day. Wonder how many start the selloff in 10 minutes to lock in profits since it's not going any higher/
Randolph taking a shot at Apple for “buying” subscribers and DIS for their copycat practices. I have Netflix and watch it often. Guess they are counting me as a “paid” subscriber? Only reason I have it is Comcast threw it in to my package while cutting my monthly rate....

I hope everyone here understands the amount of growth Netflix will have to achieve to live up to this valuation.
"Three reasons for today's move:1) An analyst who was negative raised the target to $270 and made NFLX a hold (primary reason)2) NFLX signed DIS creative director - they are spending 300MM more of other people's money (debt) to do this.3) Market moved up (very irrationally as inflation reared its ugly head)I added to my latest short position (already made $ on the last one) an hour before the close. It was clear that the bulls were trying to squeeze the shorts big time, but then a very big seller came in, and unloaded 1MM shares in the last 20 minutes. Why would someone do that? Because the wheels are coming off. NFLX has come back from its $233 low (not unexpected). There are many bulls, but they can't hold this tulip bulb up much longer. Enjoy your paper profits"
Add today! NFLX is No.1 stay-at-home stocks! People who quarantined at home have to watch NFLX to kill the time!
"If you are going to wait, why not pocket tax deferred cash and pre-pocket a profit"
Time to buy... it's now dropped too far.
All these shorts thinking that netflix is bad. Whole tech market is down. This is a good investment in the long run but this week may go bad for tech. I'm ready to hold through it but I wouldnt be surprised if we saw 340 before we see 400 again.
Why is this down. No more upgrades ??
Netflix rules the world never selling only 5to10 years to go
180 ...first
Ba-bye Netflix....
"NETFLIX PROVE THE HATERS WRONG, RISE TO 400"
"Fact: In the long run Netflix will just be another ""channel"" in the new Internet on-demand TV market. $30B market cap max!"
Relative Strength Index for NFLX is at 83. The most overbought for NFLX has been in over 2 years.
"The thing about AAPL streaming, they just copied NFLX, but you have to pay more for less. Disney has a 71 billion dollar debt, but I don't know how much is stock transfer, but still it will take years paying that bill off, NFLX looking pretty right now."
Netflix is the best
"Hulu reduced their monthly fee, should Netflix be scared? After all Hulu is competing from that space. We can also look at this from another angle, The only business that I saw reduce prices in th past are companies in desperation like block buster when they reduced their prices to compete with Netflix, Movie houses when they rolled out $10 a month unlimited movies and many more to list. Reducing prices on already established price point is a move from a position of weakness folks."
Oh man this is getting juicer by the minute. Big buying are coming in fast.

NFLX has not corrected at all today. The market has but not NFLX.
"if it goes above 400$ its time to short it again.Netflix will soon see tougher competitions from Apple, Disney.... and they wont survive this. Especially Disney streaming service will take a huge bite from the companies viewer base"

I’ll sell a portion at $350
"My concern is that the big money firms are going to walk the price down slowly over the next few weeks as they sell, so that the small investor's continue to hang in there. Kind of like the analogy of slowly raising the heat in the pot the lobster is in (lobster doesn't realize it till it's too late!). As opposed to throwing the lobster in the boiling water and have it jump out. The next few weeks will be interesting to watch."

Is this going higher? Good time to enter for long? Or is there a potential for correction to say 500-550?
Any technical traders confirm based off 6/26 chart open and 6/27 close that next level support is $380
I think the only way it will go up is if they are integrating online gaming onto the platform.I don't see the catalyst for it to go up more. More catalysts for it to drop actually.
$400 by Friday?
$1000 target in 3 months//
Disney has reached over 10M subscriptions since yesterday. That's why the drop.
What is this about AMZN ER having effect on Netflix stock prices? Do you watch Netflix while ordering online on Amazon? Or do you put Netflix on hold while rush out to front door to pick up amazon delivery? If you do any of these activities multitasking then there is nothing to worry about either one!
"Major timber tomorrow, another 9%!"
Everyone on tik Tok is cancelling Netflix because of the subscription increase ..

Not a horrible drop. Horrible I mean by Apple losing 30%.
LMAO....I bet NFLX bought back much of their stock when everyone else panic and sold.
bought 200 shares at 352...little scare but ended up easy money
Can’t even close at 525 when the market up 300 plus points. Very disappointing move today.

"RIP to whoever bought at 580, she be droppin soon"
Doctors in stocks try to organize competition between NFLX and DIS....But in facts both companies are complementary.....Content is not the same and most of subscribers will have both......Still cheaper than a movie theater per month.....For thousands of top series and films.....
"This will go over $400 , now a days DISH is not doing good due to that everyone is streaming"

BE CAREFUL SHORT. STAY AT HOME STOCKS HEATING UP AGAIN
This stock is like Cisco circa March 2000
"Here is three very negative news that impacting dow to drop 700+ point and one of most impacted stock for each is Amazon and yet it's stock drop only 2.34% after recovering quickly.1.> Tariffs:- China tariffs going to hurt Amazon most. Trade war will hurt Amazon as well because Amazon has lot of global seller and lot of Amazon brand created by putting their label on top of Chinese manufactured stuff. So This should drop as much as $CAT drop.2.> Internet Regulation:- This again impact most to Amazon. Amazon is E-commerce giant and regulation means it will not able to do lot of thing it currently doing.3.> Internet Privacy:- This is third item:- When people think about Privacy most matter is their blogging/personal post (FB), Their Shopping ($AMZN) , Listening their home conversation ($AMZN/$GOOGL), Ability to let anyone one ($AMZN recent doorbell idea to let package deliver inside),Their TV Watching Pattern ($AMZN, $NFLX, $GOOGL).So each item has major negative impact for $AMZN and yet Amazon is least impact stock even after so much run up.This is call way over optimism. This stock should below 1500, may be even near 1400. Only thing going great is technical but it going to break down at 1525. So I guess after that only it will drop like rock. After all entire rally build on top of technical."
Thanks to Sony for acquiring Crunchyroll from WarnerMedia. Goku is going to land on Netflix. Just my opinion.
All analyst are increasing price target by $10-$20. What a coordinated effort by analyst to pump.
"Geez, what a run!Time for a pullback"
"Real Money contributor and former NYSE trader Stephen ""Sarge"" Guilfoyle noted that Netflix remains a favored short position of his due to longer term problems that persist in the stock.""The fact is that for many firms engaged in the business of streaming television, costs are only going higher, perhaps much higher as the field becomes ever more competitive,"" he explained."
The shorts are on the run...scared money don't make money...baby going over 400 post earnings. Z

"So according to my research again, this is my research (my opinion). Netflix should meet its subscriber goal this quarter. How you may ask? Look for Netflix google trends, traffic analysis, and mobile app ranking overtake. In conclusion, I found that October wasn?t a smacking hot month for unique visitors. November got better. I will pause here and let you know that story changes from here. December was Netflix?s best traffic month ever in history thanks to the holidays and yes i have to give credit to bird box and bundersnatch for making that happen. Few days back a moron analyst price cut netflix from SunTrust who said it will miss. Now yes, October and November wasn?t as hot as i hoped it would be but the dude based his full conclusion from google trends. Thats the biggest mistake he made as there is a lot that google trends misses and did I point out he didn?t check December #$%$! He should be fired in my opinion or at least investigated. His words can have an impact as we live in an age of computers trading and crowd following traders we saw a 4% drop that day but later closed neutral. Google trends does not know how many people are visiting netflix domain without a G search secondly if you log in from an app it wont be able to catch that. So I also checked traffic analysis for the domain as well as app downloads. October and November again showed decent progress but nothing out of the ordinary as 9.4 million subscribers is a huge ask. Which i was worried at first but after December we might actually make it and it still could fall short. I recommend you buy here not only because of sub meet but also we are currently in a technical breakout.."
Lots of folks still stuck in using old models to think about new companies. TSLA is a good example of why old models don't work. AMZN took years to turn profitable. NFLX is no exception. Can't use what worked for GE on the new economy. Plus GE is half dead in case you are not following the news.

Chances are Netflix added 12 million new subscribers last quarter which is 2.6 million more than they forecast.

22 trading days before earning. If their is no disaster like worldwar or simular this terribly stock will climb meaby 80% of the trading days of them.
Some gains will be taken next week (new tax year) and this should push price lower.

"when I make money , I say that it is mine , If I lose , It is the Grand Daughter money in the future"

This is a 600$ stock! Go!
"man I have to tell you, just when you think you're about to make up some ground, this stock starts to sell off. We are definitely in for the long haul. NFLX is officially a day trading stock. They are selling on any kind of jump."
Took 1/2 off of the table. I don't understand how they can keep going forever with negative cash flow.
I would say the final hour of trading will be volatile. Where it finishes is anyone’s guess
"You heard the CEO say it, bonds are cheaper than equity, however interest rates are rising. Here's the template; issue bonds, issue bonds, issue bonds,... Stock dilution to ""pay down debt."" Who benefits? Investment banks, all at stockholder expense."
"NFLX will have to pay dividends to be competitive with Disney. you get value and growth and dividends with Disney. Sell NFLX, buy Disney."
This really is too easy. I had 220 last week nd 230 this week and looks like we will exceed that. I am wondering if my call for 250 post ER is too conservative. This just keeps running and may pop well over 10% when the subscriber growth comes in.
"Someone just bought my remaining share over 563... I'm out, good luck everyone!"
"Why is this still down doesn’t make any sense NFLX beat ER all FANGS are up, whoever that selling or shorting this will regret it badly come after hours."
400+ on the way congratulations !!!
just sadness ........
I think investors are panicking without even looking into what Disney+ is. It's not the same service at all. Not even close to be. It's kids content. I'll keep my Netflix subscription.
Netflix is down 5.36% to 518.45
setting up for a nice start tomorrow!

"Look here, Cramer stating the obvious: “And, remember, thanks to Disney's acquisition of Twenty-First Century Fox's entertainment assets, the combined company's going to have perhaps the best library of content in the world,"" Cramer said.""In the end, when it comes to streaming platforms, I believe the best content will win, and Disney's got amazing content,"" he continued. ""The stock actually remains cheap; it sells for 15 times earnings. [...] I think it's a buy ahead of what I believe will be a very compelling April analyst meeting."""
"Plenty of studies on it, too....Mathematically, one has a far better chance to make money in stocks by taking long positions....Shorting stocks has a far less success rate...And, I have seen very little in terms of acumen and ability on stock message boards by people who claim that they are short a stock...."
in a swift move of a hand we have recovered..... up only 199% now....
why is it going up all of a sudden?
Netflix is so far ahead of the curve I am doubting that Disney’s position and current business model and capabilities can effectively compete with the new landscape of competitors. Great to have your thoughts.
resume the pump
Nflx is no longer a one trick pony streaming service. It's also a movies producer aka pocket Hollywood.
"Netflix subscriber by countryUSA:- 54.75M ( 126.22M total house hold) = 1 in 2.5 has netflix (With Sharing this likely 1 in 1.5)UK:- 8M+ ( based on 7.5M in 3Q2017 (27M house hold) = 1 in 3.5 has netflixAustralia:- 2.5M+ ( 1 in 3 based on 7M house holds)My point is NFLX is quickly reaching very high penetration in developed countries. In developing country scope of such service is never significant. For example in India, Netflix still struggling.While it admire how quickly NFLX gone international, valuation can't justified given not as much growth left in market where it popular and affordable."
"The content on Netflix is dreadful. With the exception of Narcos and Ozarks, the content is extremely poor. The company is just a vehicle for transferring billions from shareholders' pockets to the bank accounts of Hollywood/NYC producers, celebrities, actors, writers, production assistants, movie/TV crews, and everyone in the entertainment food chain. Colossal waste of money on original content with no financial returns whatsoever."
"This quarter is already off to a very strong start. From Netflix Twitter:""THE OLD GUARD is breaking records! The Charlize Theron blockbuster is already among the top 10 most popular Netflix films ever. The film is currently on track to reach 72M households in its first 4 weeks!

OH YEAH! also support at 209The 200 DMA
Why didn’t Netflix wait until earnings call to announce the raise in subscription prices? Is it a warning the sub numbers are low?
"My stock forecast does show higher highs for the next 4 days... Let this bull push up... Slight burn out by July 30th and July 31st, but good for long holds. Highs of 390$ early Augest."
"the hits just keep on coming. Netflix dropped a first teaser for its blockbuster ""The Irishman"" during a commercial for the Oscars. Epic.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfr44G1KJmc"
"I'm a long term holder of NFLX with an over 300% gain. I continue to believe that streaming is the future. If you are a long term holder, I want to know your thoughts."
one day before earning it would be 450 or 460.

Hey @BD it's a green day for Netflix and I still think it's a bad investment due to competition growth and over inflated PE. My opinion has nothing to do with Netflix having a red or green day.

I wonder how shorty is feeling right now.
This could pop and turn positive today! Anything is possible with Netflix!
If we hit 3% on ten year you will see more heavy trading down.
"Just added Netflix to my portfolio today, feeling pretty confident long term"
Michelle Obama's new NFLX series will explain how to short NFLX and profit like Hillary did with uranium one. Lots of money to be made.

I think there is more damage to come from the subscriber growth miss.https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/netflix-hit-shareholder-lawsuit-missing-growth-projections-1226089
It will stop at $373 today!!!
?????? Good to know that there is some sanity in the market. FB has nothing to do with NFLX period. I am keeping the faith especially that one tiny positive announcement from NFLX will turn things around and if AMZN beats then it will even be better.
Before earnings last quarter the stock was 400 on the day of the report. These 330s a gift I accept!

NFLX real advantage in the streaming wars is a ultra wide genre spectrum. No other platform will have content from and for so many countries
"when news came that some resolution of trade with eu was imminent the smart traders sold INTO the rally. this market is NOT a buy it is strong sell...it is not how much growth USA has, it is why are not salaries going up? if corporate profits were sustainable AND debt was under control, salaries would rise...this is why stocks are falling and will continue weakening....what will precipitate a total market collapse will be a fed raising rates into the instability you see in the market today...growth is weak and problematic elsewhere in other countries...you buy at your own risk, it takes years to recover stock losses."
of course drop of 1-2 usd in the morning tomorrow then up to 380 the same on monday.
"When it hits $225, I'm selling. OK, $275.Oh, I mean, $300. When it hits $350, I'm definitely getting out. OK, $400 is my top. ...When will the split happen?"

can anyone suggest what would the good price to purchase 100 shares?
Let’s go!!!
"just sold 1/3 at 331, hope I don't regret"
"After market guys (day traders) who don't post all day long are in to try and drive the price down with panic nonsense. Then, they'll swoop in premarket and sell within the hour. It happens every day, watch the early morning volume, and quick sell within 30 mins of the opening bell."
"gunna grab a SIDETRADE on NFLX short here at 367, cover at 363 for quick $4 intraday gain. We still have base short swing positons, but we also LIFO trade (last-in-first-out), its very effective to use while in a base swing, we also get side trades.....its more difficult then it sounds...for now watch and learn."
Always remember if your short what your looking at 126 P/E 10 billion in debt after a keep the lights on junk bond sale of 2 billion. Its pump and dump manipulation there is no value here long term only endless hype with a massive debt reality topped with aging technology that every tech entertainment co is now throwing their hat in mix.
Get me to $380 and I’m done. I can’t handle his anymore.
"The whole tech sector has been squashed, not just NFLX. There is nothing wrong with the company, they beat last earnings and are continuing to grow. If you own, hold. If you don't own, BUY. Netflix is always exaggerated in it's movement, when the market goes back to an uptrend this will soar very quickly and erase the losses. The ONLY losers are those who sold their shares for a loss out of fear. Fear, makes some men poor, and others rich."
Even if it had 300million subscribers that would only be just 3 billion revenue a month... price just doesn’t make sense
time to take profit on long trades and prepare to go short.
"Huge buying volume, huge call option volume. Shorts beware. As Jimmy Z says, you have been warned!"
"Nflx is a day trade stock; It is not for long term investment. It pays no dividend, high P/e, a lot of competitors and debts. If you want to short, then wait after ER. If you are long, then sell and take profit before ER. A lot of unemployed people, they need to cut back expenses, not adding more expenses on unnecessary as Nflx, DIS. Plenty of free movies on YouTube. Why pay?"
April Calls on NFLX are through the roof.
$NFLX partnership should sky rocket this to multi pennies
CIDM stock is a better streaming play right now!! they just aquired the indian version of NETFLIX and have annouced a new streaming app
what is going on? It wend down after bought it and went up after i sold it.
Tomorrow 350$ Friday 400$
"The stock has been ahead of the analysts with a -8% return this year. Citi and others who late last week said free cash flow will not be black in 2021, and a bad Disney comparison. I guess up after a beat Tuesday, since there have been 3 misses, -5, -11, -19% last three quarters"
Nflx has very little to do with the overall economy
NFLX never dies because money makers favorite just like Bitcoin. $340 this week.
LOL Goldman seriously reiterating $400?! NFLX has $8 billion debt and only $500 million annual income with slowing growth in a saturated market. So obvious Goldman is pumping and dumping before next earnings.
Market hoping NFLX earnings will reverse the market correction. God help us all.
I’m out
Maybe not today maybe not tomorrow but this market all FOMO now and about to implode
"I hope to see $350 ---- Earnings, Earnings, Earnings :)"
Was a good day. Now i go watch another episode of El Chapo on Netflix. That guy made almost as much money as the people that go long on Netflix :)! Cheers and hope tomorrow will be as good as today.

Thumbs up for ER Puts / Thumbs down for ER Calls
"Netflix Inc.'s (NFLX) 12-month price target was increased to $245 from $230 at MKM Partners on Thursday. MKM analyst Rob Sanderson raised his subscriber outlook for Netflix for 2018, saying the company has yet to reach its peak year for total subscriber additions. ""We continue to view Netflix as the large cap with the most potential for market cap appreciation over the next three to four years,"" Sanderson wrote in a note to investors. Sanderson said he expects Netflix to add 20.6 million subscribers next year, which is roughly in line with FactSet consensus of 20.9 million, but would be down from 2017 consensus of 22.0 million subscriber additions. This year was expected to be the streaming service's peak for subscriber additions, but Sanderson said it's more likely to come in 2019 or 2020. ""We think Netflix has a large first mover advantage, expecting to spend $7 billion to $8 billion next year, far more than any other programmer,"" Sanderson wrote."
Nearly 300 PE...Seems legit.
"O bama’s show should be at 3 am to cure insomniacs. What’s next, Liz Warren playing Chuckie, the psycho doll?"
A heavy Correction is imminent!US Stocks are INSANELY OVERVALUED and OVERBOUGHT!The Valuations are impossible to justify! The US Stock indexes must fall by 65-70% to come down reasonable valuations.$TSLA $NFLX
The reason Netflix has been stalling out the last few days might be because of the massive inflows into $IQ . Just buy both and you will be very rich!
"revenue growth yoy 30%FPE (maybe hype) 91so it looks to be worth about a third of what it is trading at, based on that420/3 = $140now look at a long term chart, 5 years, 130 sticks out as supportgive it time, it may go there"
Stocks typically drop on day 2 after a selloff like today. Let's see if NFLX holds true to that. My guess is it will be off 2-3% tomorrow then resume the run to $450.
No competition whatsoever will hit 500B soon as it becomes the world go to For contents I see 1000K/shr 2020.
Just remember all these new streaming service are in it not by choice but are force into it due to Netflix success. Profitability for any of these new players is at least 5 years away
"Ohhhh Cramer said he likes $DIS better, no wonder $NFLX rebounded"

"NFLX subs are up, earnings are up, missing projections was taken way out of context by bias articles. NFLX 4 EVER."
think of it as a slingshot
$NFLX is going below $300 in a week or two.
The Queen’s Gambit is an unexpected big hit. It should help Netflix beat subscriber expectations and show pricing power.
"Well I’m having fun today, is everyone having fun? Sure hope so"
"Great article. The important point in it is how NFLX has to keep borrowing at high costs to compete with AMZN, APPL, and DIS, with the first two sitting on piles of cash and can outspend NFLX.

That is an unsustainable model. https://www.forbes.com/sites/stephenmcbride1/2018/12/10/netflixs-worst-nightmare-is-coming-true/#d9788f86efce"

"wow.... Goldman just manipulated this stock . They cut the price so that they can buy back with cheap prices..But everybody knows NFLX earning will be huge tomorrow. So, stock will go up again...."

Goldman bullish on nflx? why?
Wow
Any idea why an $8.00 drop today. No real news to speak of.
"Wow, all the earnings gains are gone."

I’m buying more tomorrow I believe in the company.
bought back in todaygood move or bad?
9% drop over past few days without any news and without major volume... analysts and fans/foes all over the place with price targets. Q3 results one week away. Looks like a trade setup to me... sell the rumor and buy the news! NFLX should fall a bit more and then recover back to 380+ post earnings... nice opportunity!!
Where have all the haters gone? And the short side Disney pumping media analysts?
It’s waiting to run again
If you think TSLA earnings is impressive wait till you see AMZN today. I would load up before market closes today. Thank me later.

Look out below....
Sio glad I finally jumped aboard this baby last month. What a machine.
great buying opportunity before earnings release.
You know who's not buying; management!
AMZN will sell off on earnings cause its been on monster run. It ran up and sold last time even though report was awesome.
"because of the compeition, folks will cancel Netflix, if even for a few months, to try the otherswhich represents a push against their revenue, a drop perhaps, less growth, probably a drop"
I've been saying it for months. This had to happen. 800 is next stop.
"Raising prices now? Not committed to growth anymore? Investors are looking at this the wrong way lmao. In my view, this actually hints at sub growth not meeting expectations come earnings. Why else would you stunt your growth right now just as more competitors are ramping up their offerings?"
NFLX priced to perfection. Any miss or even not beating expectations is going to be a huge drop.
im realy going to feel sorry for the longs who bought above $150 next week
BMO upgrade to 580$
How do you justify a 130 PE ratio? When will those earnings meterialize? I'm a big fan of Netflix but this is to much! Other streaming platforms are coming and netflix will have to spend much more to be competitve! I'm sorry but this is a $120 stock (being optimistic)
"One out of every ten people in the world survives on less than $2 per day. If you make over $35,000 per year, you are in the top 1% of earners in the world. And some people think ""the entire world population"" is going to have a Netflix subscription?"
I just watched Netflix again last night. Didn’t even bother looking up Disney app yet.
"Netflix price target raised to $700 from $650 at Morgan Stanley, OverweightMorgan Stanley analyst Benjamin Swinburne raised the firm's price target on Netflix to $700 from $650 and keeps an Overweight rating on the shares, stating that the ""moment has arrived"" that he has long believed would come when the company moves to ""sustained and substantial"" annual free cash flow. His new forecast for Netflix to begin share repurchases later this year, and assumption for $2B in share repurchases during the second half of 2021, compares to his prior estimate of buybacks coming in 2023, Swinburne noted."
"Analyst Guggenheim raised price from $285 to $360, maintains buy rating."
MS netflix to hit 700. Covid is skyrocketing back. People will go back to staying home all day.PT upgraded to 700.
"I just wish, I'd bought more calls towards close."
"Once AO was the 'first mover and leader' of the internet... once Yahoo was the 'first mover and leader' of email and search.Netflix does not have a huge selection of content, many Netflix investors are going to learn very quickly when Disney, Marvel, Star Wars, Pixar, Fox, etc. is pulled from Netflix just how sparse their content is. It will be worse when Warner/HBO follows suit."
"Up day on big volume, don’t sell"
"The usual. Driven up during after and pre hours and then sold off after those who can't trade during those hours buy in thinking the stock is moving up. Why are people allowed to manipulate stocks like this? This is a pattern especially with Netflix that should be regulated somehow.Stock closed at 309, opens at 317 and drops to 312 with a few hours. makes absolutely no sense. no stock consistently trades like this."
I'd like to see 350 but might not get there.
HUGE AMOUTN OF SHORTS TIME SQUEEZE
Think we will see just shy of $400 by next Friday
"tomorrow a higher low and higher high, as we just put a inside day in today! Then watch to see if it takes off in next 3 candles"
If nothing else they will have to run out of buyers eventually LOL
Logical that the higher the stock goes the more it becomes a buy.Fast subscriber growth not only leads to higher stock prices but also higher chances Disney Time Warner and Fox will lose their grip on the TV and movie industry.
"""Netflix Earnings: Analysts expect the FANG stock to deliver a whopping 433% increase in EPS growth in the second quarter. That would mark the third time in the last four reports that Netflix has generated a triple-digit earnings gain.

Nothing that anyone says here today matters until AAPL reports.
How you going to bring up Netflix to all time highs when it didn’t even hit earnings estimates
Believe it or not: NFLX may try to hit $300 mark next week!
"We tested the $362.75 level and got a little bounce, next will be $361.20 support, this will be a major hurdle., if support fails then $358.01 is the next level to test, then $352.61, all bets are off if it falls below $344.40."

"By history and quarterly trends, NFLX has always increased stock price after a good earning. Believe me!"
Fun facts - number of movie tickets sold in India is 2x the number of movie tickets sold in US. The total box office revenue in Asia Pacific is 1.5x the box office revenue in US & Canada. Those markets are huge and streaming services are in nascent stages. Huge upside potential for NFLX if they play their cards right. They do have one advantage - they are a leader in US and investments they make in creating international content helps them grow internationally and helps strengthen their base in US even further.
"When FB dropped to $150, I panicked and sold...didn't do that with NFLX. Not making that mistake twice."

Overall it's just break even since I cover 30% by selling 225 put last week (I thought it wont go below that but I was wrong just like I was wrong about won't go above 220.My intent was as hedge but I will stick to stock that really overvalue like $AMZN, $NFLX. No reason to short quality stock that only slightly overpriced compare to overall market. Risk/Benefit does not justify."
subs all that matters Netflix so cheap they can keep raising prices as long as content is getting better
"Take from a thousand families, give to one family. Thats how the US Stock market works."
Buying opportunity
"wish you could buy nflx @ $31.00?? well here is your chance ! Buy IQ stock today , a Chinese co. that is 93% owned buy BUIDU. IPO was in March @ $18.00 and has already gone to $46.00 is just a few months. Well thanks to Trump hammering the Chinese market w trade war threats, the whole Chinese market has gone down and you can get IQ for $31.00 now. It is a fast growing co. similar to nflx in some ways and is not affected by tariffs, other than just being Chinese in general. CHECK IT OUT !!!!!!"
335 calls would be worth by close
"Made good fortunes today, thank you Netflix "
NFLX next 3 month revenue per subscriber = $31.1 (8% higher). Reason Most of subscriber yet to see price increase.They somehow hide this detail and market celebrating too fast I think.
Based on their current trajectory...they hit 200 subs in about 26 months. Z
news of the year announcement Apple buying Netflix WOW GOING UP 10%
Where Netflix is going
"So the squid has an opinion, funny how they announce after a quarter close but prior to earnings. Then we find out there was a change to capital structure like bonds issued. What does the squid have in store this quarter? Around 12/24 it was $243, vs pre-market of $279, that's a 14% increase in 6 trading days. What was the news?"
By 9:30 am it will be 510 ish
I'm buying tomorrow
I'm buying at some point.
Happy for Netflix investors! Congratulations!
Strong BUY NFLX! Apple will buy this company soon!
$DIS just blew past subscriber growth. $CURI is next!! $NFLX here we come!!
This should be no where near $350.00. This should be already $400.00 and over the top. Why are we playing games here let’s get this back where it should be $500.00.
Netflix will be soaring high tomorrow after close!Imagine how many new subscribers they added just to watch “Bird Box”.

"I sold to early, but I was thinking that they missed earnings and was down by 10+ cents from last year... Oh well!"
buying on the opening bell.. thanks shorts for over playing this.. it gives us a good bargain.
Good growth but on market down days buy it in low 500s. wait for it to get in.
1.5 billion new debt every quarter. This is going to be fun to watch this one go below 100

"CNBC currently, analyst Rich Greenfield is bullish on Netflix."
this will start to slowly bleed I to next two days
"Totally insane reaction. NFLX is already the most overvalued stock in the index. A 28% growth rate is not high enough to bring its 300 PE down to reasonable levels for decades. On top of this, they MISSED revenue projections by $80million ($2.20b vs expected $2.28b), are experiencing NEGATIVE CASH FLOW, and are going further into debt. Any one of these three negatives would take a non-darling stock down 20%. All three would...pick a number... down 35%? But yet, in this crooked (can you say rigged?) market, it goes up. I'm not long or short. Just an observation that there are many, many companies that are superior to NFLX that would get absolutely hammered for producing results like this."
"Going higher, much higher."
not buying into this sell off...still holding
"Remember when Netflix was $8 down over 80%. Content producers were raising prices, Apple, Comcast and Verizon said they were going to launch streaming services. Nearly half the floated shares were held short. They laughed at Hastings when he said streaming would eventually replace cable TV and Netflix was leading the way."
"400.00 after the report,"
"I've done extensive analysis on this. Pie charts, line charts, astrology charts, tea leaves, Ouija board. What they tell me is that Netflix will make a run at $600 in March. I'm looking at $590-$600 and possibly even $610-$620. Then it'll pull back to under $600 again before the ER in April."
CFO stepping down for a company like NFLX is usually good for a a 2-3% decline. Hanging in there pretty good.
"On average $NFLX has dropped on Q1, Q2, Q3 reports, but has an average gain of 12% on Q4 reports. 390 on Friday!"

"Netflix LeadsNetflix Inc. led all studios with five wins, including prizes for “Roma,” about the maid in a well-to-do Mexican family, and the comedy “The Kominsky Method.” Alfonso Cuaron won best director for “Roma,” which also grabbed the prize for best foreign language film. “The Kominsky Method” won Golden Globes for best comedy and best actor for its star Michael Douglas.The wins for “Roma” gave “that film the push it needed,” said Erik Davis, managing editor of Fandango.com “I think ‘Roma’ is your new best picture Oscar frontrunner starting now.”To help win awards, Netflix is giving some releases more theatrical exposure than ever before. Cuaron said “Roma” may have gotten more exposure than if he had chosen a traditional distributor."
"The last 2 or 3 times this stock has climbed to 299 to 300, that's normally the high for the day. After 2 pm the stock starts to tumble. They must be day trading nflx big time."

"American TV shows do not dominate the TV screens of Asia so why should NFLX be any different especially since the majority of their offerings are of questionable quality. Be realistic about the growth prospects of NFLX and realize that it is still way toooo overpriced at USD 120 billion. When the market realizes NFLX's income and revenue cannot keep up with the debt, much more pain will come."

There is no other place to go for investing. So buy and hold on tight. It's only going to go up more!
At one point today this was $15+ why did it drop?
"NFLX is finished - at least for the time being. All analysts have upgraded and pumped to the max, the stock is up 40% YTD, they will sing the same old story about international growth blah blah blah - but the facts are that NFLX is burning cash at an alarming rate, the stock is way overvalued and it has $10 billion of debt with no end in sight to the cash bleed, which means more debt issuance is unavoidable, which makes the stock more risky and the interest rate paid higher."
"the options market signals a move of 8 to 10% in either direction, at this stage anyone buying is gambling"
Netflix never misses two quarters in a row. Congrats longs!
"you guys have to understand that wall street controls the media sentiment and hype for companies. The""analysts"" that set price targets work for Wall street.

It is slanted towardtheir side. wall street creates bubbles in stocks on purpose and for one reason. To take your money."
"time to party, NFLX Longs...https://youtu.be/cFk0SSmmvfQ"
"Happy to say my Netflix investment is up 906%. Third biggest holding now. Basic method of buy and hold, buy on the dips. it's that simple. I would not let Rice, Obamas or anything else stand in the way of my continuing to invest in this generational stock. Highly recommend."
Lmao. People still trying to push this to $600. Hahahaha

Analysts at Buckingham upped their price target to a similar $251 from $235, while maintaining a buy rating on Netflix stock.But the one analyst TheStreet's Jim Cramer was focusing on during CNBC's ""Mad Dash"" segment on Thursday? Morgan Stanley's Benjamin Swinburne.Swinburne upped his price target to $255 from $235 and maintained his overweight rating. He also raised his estimate for international subscribers additions in 2018 to 16.9 million. Even that may be conservative, Swinburne acknowledged."

"consolidating around 340, will end up at 345.Buy the dip while you can."
what a comeback
Everything has dropped the last 3 hours today. It's been a bad 2 weeks for almost everything. Why would you expect Netflix to NOT following the same downward trajectory. Almost every stock has now given back it's previous daily gain.
"God, I love this stock. Been holding it for years. I've ignored all the naysayers dismiss it countless times over the years because it always defies the skeptics and critics. And I credit Reed Hastings for much of the stock's resilience and growth: He never hesitates to admit when he's messed up, and always offers a solution to fix it - and he's always been right so far. Even earlier today when the stock was getting sold off, some were speculating on this board that ""smart money"" must have known something ahead of the earnings release - when, clearly, they didn't."
up and green like always

There you go ... Brexit vote turmoil hitting stock market
"Netflix will report earnings after close on Monday. Estimates are $0.80. There is concern for the stock price because: 1) P/E is very high 2) it's up over 108% in a year 3) if a competitor like HULU were to be bought by say Direct TV, Netflix would take a big hit 4) nothing goes straight up forever. Even a slight ER miss would sent the stock price tumbling. GLTA"

"A long time ago I learned to consider PE ratio as a large part of my investment decisions, plus looking at the market overall and the growth rate and prospects for continued growth. I cannot see a justification to put my hard-earned money in a stock like this, since there is no fundamental balance sheet supporting the price. Tell me where I am wrong in this reasoning."
"Nice upward movement premarket, hopefully it’s a sign of things to come today."
Just bought 10 at 382 what yall think

"Honestly, Netflix deserves a big thank you from Disney for showing them the path to getting the market excited. If Disney now gets to be valued like Netflix and Roku, the sky is the limit. Netflix was the teacher, Disney was the pupil. The question now is, will the pupil surpass the teacher?"
"Most of the guidance for this Quarter ER from CEOs will be measured and conservative, knowing that interest rates will go higher and OPEX due to inflation and tariffs. Question is will the investors take that into consideration and not react negatively as usual and bring the stocks down. I think guidance for most high growth stocks will be rather cautious and investors should adjust their expectations accordingly."
Yesterday CNBC focussed on Needham?s downgrade. There are all kinds of views but what I find disingenuous is that cnbc only published the negative one. There are four other updates from analyst. Bernstein at 422 yesterday. JP Morgan at 425 yesterday and stifel at 400 day before. piper jaffray today at 400. No mention of those at all. It also falls pre mkt because a network knows CNBc is going to focus on the negative one and starts shorting. Easy money. The flaw in Needham?s analysis is that she is treating the mkt as finite ie people will leave Netflix to go to Disney. But Disney and Apple did not get into this business to take customers from Netflix. They got in because they see a massive #$%$ in future years to streaming. So the point is all will win. The second flaw in Needham?s view is that she wants Netflix to introduce an ad model other wise they r in trouble. So now Laura from Needham wants to teach Reed Hastings the pioneer of streaming how to run his business when he does not see a problem.. just yesterday Sarantos at the UBS conference said business is intact. If he were losing subs he could easily do that. Short term because of these fears price can fall over next one year but don?t bank on it staying down. Too big a mkt and the suggestion they Netflix will lose 4 mn subs is complete nonsense with the pipeline of programmes.
Goldman conviction list AKA - stock going down
I dont often get to brag so let me have this one...played my $AMZN and $NFLX call options purchased yesterday perfectly today...top price for Netflix and near top for Amazon. rarely nail it like that.
I ignored netflix when it was 50 dollars but now reckon this could do 100pc in the next few months. Few percent each day grinding up slowly same way tesla did. There is no reason to stocks like this anymore.

"Lot of people says dot com and this rally is different. I agree with them. Back in Dot-com rally was broad cover lot of different companies in bubble territory. This rally focus on few hot names. Now is that good or bad. Very hard to tell but here is my thought.Because people only invest in hot names, Money concentrated into top 50 company in this market mainly. Now let's say $AMZN or $NFLX or $TSLA suddenly find hard to handle. With limited balance sheet they will have hard time meeting obligation and stock can crash big time. If one of such company fail, fear to exit will run. Given most invested in 50 company, Those all exiting into same names as well and what will happen when everyone thinking to exit same time?"
No joke: this will tradeAt 200 this year. Streaming is a decade old story its doa. Pe compressiom coming

What about this warrants a PE 10x higher than DIS? This company is so overvalued it would need to double earnings every year for several years to even start justifying this valuation.

Netflix would not increase sub rates if it was expecting a poor quarterly. Increases in subscriptions would have to outway the losses due to fleeing subscribers bent on the $2 increase. Expect a positive report.
Time to shine don't bother with amc gme koss they are all going to crash hard .....Buy netflix a legitimate solid company

One way or the other this company is a pioneer with no actual competition at the moment.Netflix set the new rules to everyone in Hollywood and the whole movie/series industry worldwide. 500 by year end.Good luck longs

Market maker priced this for a ~$35 move. $380 is right in line with their estimates. Longs should be happy they got their direction correct. Shorts should be thankful its not higher.

Held this stock for 8 years. Seen all the downward slides only to see it come roaring back to all time highs a few months later. This blip will be forgotten by next earnings. See you all above $420 by end of year.
"Before you jump and mute me right away. Hear me out, I am not here to spam but to bring exposure in a gently manner. Check out CIDM and do your own DD but they've just met compliance yesterday and are a major streaming play with more partners and a larger library than Netflix.

Sell NFLX and buy ROKU!!!It's gonna rock on ER!!!
Every 10m customers added is 1b in revs annually...extrapolate at least 60-70 percent minimum would pay double the price...fantastic. z
HUGE buys at the close.
Netflix has little competition which always comes from lower prices. Their main competitors cable TV are raising prices.
"Lost 8,000 today should have sold last night"
NFLX SHORTS! Lol
There is a definite seasonal trend - in 9 of the past 10 years Netflix has closed higher over the upcoming 35 days with an average gain of 26.9%
They get a lot more for their money with original content. More content leads to more subscribers. Maybe 9 million added this Q.
How can a streaming media company be worth $134 billion?
Buy now another blast off is coming 
I'm just so happy every time I play Netflix no problems I'm from Toronto I only have 10 shares at 332 bought June 7 my bday last year don't care yo down and I said I'll hold one year on my 51 bday but I said nope I'll hold for my boy for 5 years then sell long holder any thoughts will be appreciated
"They should makes a movie about Netflix. We could call it ""The Day the Bubble Burst"" Remake you say?"
Looks like 320 is the resistance line
oops there goes the dow
I predict we close at 1% gain.
we will continue to see lower highs and lower lows until earnings...
Everything is gonna be alright
Morning folks looks very promising today. Love netflix no problems with me have fun
High today should be at least $351....
"I still do not understand. Netflix owns nothing. Its original contents are not that ""valuable"". It is just a streaming service!!! Soon (most likely now) the other company will start gang up on Netflix. Once they will stop feeding contents to Netflix, it is the end of Netflix!!!"
BREAKING NEWS : EARNINGS BEATS ESTIMATES BY 60%
"Wall Street awards growth but pivots on a dime in the absence of it.Five quarters NFLX subscriptions grew, NFLX doubled in price.Yesterday, growth was not there; NFLX fell 15%"

"why volume is so low? can anybody explain me,please"
Bought at 332 2 years ago holding long
It might sell off from $550 but honestly it overreacted to downside last quarter. It’s the best in field. I thought too risky to hold into earnings but those who gambled worked out well
there was no reason for it to be 415 in first place. 250 soonnnn..

"We entered a secular bear market in october. Extreme high valuatuons (NFLX), low interest rates, high debt, low wages is what started this trend. The breakout of the markets in 2013 was not one based on organic economic fundamentals but rather through massive monetary interventions by Central Banks globally. The previous secular bull markets in our history we ones which were derived from extreme undervaluations, washed out financial markets, and extreme negative sentiment."

wow going around appl to keep 30% if the did sign up through iTunes
A couple years ago I bought some shares of NFLX at the $82 range and sold at the $92 range. I locked in a good $10/ share of gains and was very happy with my trade. Following my gains I saw the stock climb to $350 range. I was heartbroken and disappointed that I wasn't strong enough to hold on for the ride. However a couple years later ( Tuesday before the bell) I decided to participate and open a good position on NFLX. I'm very happy I did and I don't think a quick $10 - $20 bump up is enough to get out and lock in gains this time. Same thing happened to me with TSLA- I saw a $100 gain / per share and got out. Way too early now that I look back. After I got out of TSLA the stock rallied another $200+ a share.
The U.S. Federal Reserve on Thursday temporarily eased requirements for banks to access intraday credit from Fed banks to ensure that lending continues during the coronavirus pandemic.The Bulls are coming.
Why do you guys come on here every single day to say this thing is crashing to (insert dollar amount) by (insert date)? It’s only gone up. It goes up every single time you guys say it’s crashing.
There’s absolutely no reason why you’d sell unless you’re using your margin. And people who use their margin should not trade at all for so many reasons one of them being they don’t hold over a few days and they cause the market to fluctuate badly and when they get fought in the a rainstorm like this they get hurt. But I find it so entertaining to see how people can criticize a massive company’s finances from their basement desk about debts and “bad” financial strategies as if Netflix itself doesn’t have the intelligence to manage its company with such global presence and worth billions. This hit is not targeted to Netflix. And I’m sure in couple years the prices will recover and in 10 years you will retire with more money

Share of this stock are “less owned” says JP morgan. Im not sure where they get this stuff? “Insulated from regulatory and data privacy concerns.” Says who!!?!? I doubt NFLX is setting the standard in these areas. The subscriber growth is all this stock has..
Semiconductors and Chips under pressure from Tarrif May move money to Streaming hot hot hot NFLX and IQ rocket stocks
The drama created by NFLX trading before earnings is more entertaining than anything streaming on NFLX.
How high NFLX can go?My best guess is 325-350 range near term long term may be 490
This is the growth / momentum stock King of Kings
They may have started buying shares today
My fear is dead money for the foreseeable future. Neither up or down much. Money has to work for me.
NFLX was consolidating and forming a base or a platform to blast-off. And it did!$BABA is currently going through what NFLX did the fast few weeks.
"380, 390, 400 and so on don´t get trapped in bears"
Great buying opportunity. Optimism always prevails.
"Buy as much as you can premarket, it will be down like today. It is like walking into equity. Apple's misfortunes are temporary/product cycle and has nothing to do with economy. A lot of people who bought IPhone X last year (2017) did not upgrade. Netflix's monthly fee is very reasonable and can withstand economic downturn. Disney+ and Time Warner streaming is not a threat to Netflix, I for one will subscribe to Disney+, the other service will complement Netflix and it will take 8-12 year for Disney+ and Time Warner catch up."
THIS THE BEST TIME TO BUY 30 POINTS ON THE UP SIDE
when are the #Reddit guys get to $ROKU to make sure its in the stratosphere so that it is valued like $NFLX ?
"Her is comes again, have a support at $380, good sign."

"It will finish above 370 today, 380 by Wednesday"
"Six days up in a row, top of bollinger band, time to short again"
Right at the 50 day moving average now and the top of the bollinger bands. My guess is a pullback from here but will wait and see. May grab some puts today if this gets up to $285 or higher.
guys is not just Netflix the whole market is down so relaxed no need to panic
Way to go longs. I don't own.
I dont hold any apple shares but I really hope they do good on earnings so market goes green tomorrow as well. Keep the streak going for NFLX
Cash flow positive in 2021 and 8.5 million adds. Wow !
Dont want to jynx anything but great strength netflix Wooot woot!
"NFLX is now down 30% from its high, but it's sister company Tesla is still at all-time highs. Weird. The companies are very similar....both competing in very old industries (Hollywood, Autos) while pretending to be ""tech companies,"" both endlessly cash burning, both huge issuers of junk bonds, both trading at absurd dot.com valuations, etc. So why is Tesla still near all-time highs while Netflix has crashed? Consumer Reports says Tesla is the LEAST reliable auto brand. Meanwhile people LOVE Netflix. So as both Auto Stocks AND Tech stocks have corrected, why hasn't Tesla?"
600$ is a reasonable price target
So buy Amazon and Netflix - the world is changing......ride the wave while it lasts.....it may go longer than the trolls expect -- when the weather changes - bail to cash.
longs... hold tight. Monday is earnings and upgrades are already out. they're buying this into the close.
Under the hood this is still a rental shop for out-of-season used DVDs. They are so out of the FAANG league.
yay 1st month free means user count LOL
Over priced. No profits ever. Only losses. Will have to spend more on content when Disney and WarnerMedia begin to pull content from them. Share price is way overinflated only due to hype. Analyst are not evaluating this correctly. They promote and when price does up they dump. Sell Netflix.
back to 550 perhaps?
Some institutions are dumping......back to 450 for NFLX in AH
Glad I sold this morning.
Booyah!!! Cramer nailed it on this one. He said it was going to be blowout earnings!!! Good job Jim!!!
They signed up to pay 100 million to air Friends for another year. To me this is flashing red. This shows you that most of the inhouse productions are not doing much to sustain members.
Buy now or never see this price again.
Any chance of Netflix ever providing live entertainment streams such as sports and the like? That's one thing which would make Cable completely obsolete.
"NFLX just signed with Nickelodeon. Great strategy to fight back against Disney. 10 million subs on day one is impressive, but they are giving the service away for free to VZ customers & others. So that data isn't all it's cracked up to be."

Heading to 361 after 30mins...
"Didn't like the afternoon selloff, but ending up $3 on a day when all of the major averages were noticeably down is still pretty good. I agree with some of the other posts - tomorrow we'll probably drop a few dollars early, then slowly rise throughout the day to finish somewhere in the mid-370s."
it will never hold 420+ says Cramer
if it didn't drop at the last half hour before the bell it will not drop at all today... road to 600
Trying to break 400
"$NFLX does this, don't worry guys, it recovers much harder since everyone ends up buying the dip. Just stay long, don't sell this stock. You'll see tomorrow morning a little more red and then Monday it'll go to the moon."

"In again at 384, don’t miss the train"

I was down 156K at the open today. Bought 60 calls ($340 strike) at the open and came out with a 16K loss.
Revenue missed Subscriber growth not impressive
"When interest payments are only 5% a year and you can grow borrowed money 35% a year it would be a big mistake not to borrow, especially in an emerging streaming market where advantages of scale prevail."
Hopefully a split
"NFLX is a great idea and a great company. It is just that it's stock price has become bloated. This is just a modern version of a cable network (TW or Comcast but does not own the pipe to your home so can't sell other services), so it is more like a broadcasting company ABC or NBC with less content, albeit perhaps more entertaining. So how does it garner a market cap equal to 75% of Disney's who's content rakes (as well as other streams of revenue) 5 times the top line revenue of NFLX and 6 times NFLX earnings. This bloated pig of a stock will trade below $100/share probably below $50 during the next downturn."
I cannot wait till they take over India Bollywood.
GO TRUMP...

"So all those calls I bought yesterday are in the money now, HAHAHA"
Wait until lunch more big buying. Banks are loading up heavy
If they beat next quarter then the tone on this board will change instantly.
The ultra high growth phase is now in the past for NetFlix. Interest in newcontent is lackluster so going forward competitors in China and elsewhere will be taking marketshare and subscriber base will flaten out or possibly drop slightly after Hastings decides to hike prices again to pay for content. $313 is fair value for NFLX share price.https://finance.yahoo.com/video/netflix-shares-tumble-subscriber-hiccup-100900415.html

I need to see a moonshot to 380 today to be happy
my opinion. No installation. No receiver box. No special changer. No dish on top of my house. No contract. No 100$+ monthly bill. Most Emmies won because of good original content. Bottom line is they have successfully leveraged the Internet to deliver entertainment cheaper and evey day more people are signing up.
Nflx needs to produce something like GOT. Amzn is making Lotr. Quality is more important than quantity.
Can a pundit step up with positive news? All is not bleak..NFLX is still functioning on all cylinders as always.
I cant stop thinking about the guy that posted here a few days ago that he had bought 800K worth of Netflix shares at $415
shorts are going to scramble to buy under 600. SQUEEEEEEZE!
What a come back!!!!!
Next stop 350
buy AAPL
"I begged you longs to sell last week, saying this was headed to $320. I hope a few listened. My short is doing great. Still more pain to come. If you have a massive gain still on your long and are comfortable holding long term and able to ride this down another $20 or so, then hold on, otherwise get out."
Back to $360
"Falling Revenues, TANKING Earnings and yet $NFLX BUBBLE is getting PUMPED again!What a PONZI SCHEME!"
wow......
"People investing based on wrong matrix called Growth. Given high penetration in many developed market, Growth isn't great matrix but how many Subscriber left who might subscribe.Here is NFLX Subscriber peak analysis and it's scary.For No. purpose I am using 30% more household due to Common netflix account sharing. Which likely conservative.Current Subscriber count:- 125MWith Sharing About 165MTotal World house hold (Ex- China which clearly not going to launch anytime soon except licensing deal with limited extra income.):- 600M80% world population live on <$10/day, most of them can't even afford. Normally those household much bigger and so I assume 40% house hold can't afford Netflix like service more than month or two/year So Let's Reduce 35% house hold = 390 left.Now let's assume on average 50% of that 390 subscriber (Which actually mean 65%-70% penetration with sharing. This is very very high number because even USA they can't reach there and their marketing cost already balloon in USA just to keep current growth rate) = 185M.My prediction, Peak around 160-170M , after reach 150M, Growth will stall or even go negative. Growth likely slowdown in quarter or two as well.If price raised within 2 month, we might see 2-3 Quarter of growth Stall and peak reduce by 10% at least.If you are retail long, this is best time to take profit (Atleast some profit) peak is not far from here on growth. Normally stock react few month advance. So recent quick raise is due to expected growth near peak which almost always certain for popular services like Netflix, HBO ,DIS (HBO experience peak even in 2014 and so Disney on their current business Line).Only difference between HBO , DIS and Netflix is, unlike DIS and HBO who generate real profit, Netflix still spend $2B-$3B /year and add debt. Also not other businesses to balanced out."
have you seen how much NFLX drops after it surges? Almost equally. Great to swing trade or if you are seriously long then we all know you got in wayyy before these price points. Point is I can't say it's a bad company but anyone buying in now or pretty much above 500s is taking huge risk IMHO. Then again a lot of the market is the same but NFLX surged way too high wayy too fast so it will correct before anything else does. And then on a big market correction day it will not be good for NFLX but great time to buy in
Netflix valuation is always too low because it is compared to companies with much less growth potential.
Disney+ and revenue it will generate within 2 year may more than $NFLX.With $29 for big movie on first night is way to go and very innovative way to handle.They will generate $300M on just that move.
"Look at this insider trading. There is very clear pattern even when they getting stock for $25-$100 price. They still selling everything same time.So who know if stock is really buy or sell??? Market, Analyst or Insider?https://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/insider-trading/NFLX.O"
I predicted this stock goes to $1000 and I will hold till it does.
Should do your dd. But looking at VIAC. By the numbers it looking like they still showing a lot of growth in near future. Plus divi I will keep my Netflix but Viacom is a good study lol
"Hmmm, well #NFLX does report tonight. Should be interesting!"
Why aren't any of you mentioning the subscriber growth rate? Nearly 9M new subscribers last quarter! That's HUGE!
Waiting until the closing bell for NFLX earnings report makes me feel like I’m back in 1995 awaiting the OJ verdict.
Gonna add 20k if it dips to 272.00
"There's really no reason or logic to be found concerning this stock valuation. It's basically an alternate version of the crypto bubble where people just keep on based based on the fear of missing out. As long as they do, it keeps going up, which leads to others trying to catch the train while it's still going up the hill. There's really no way to analyze how far this irrational investing can take this stock. It could go to 400+ by the end of the month because ""reasons"" or it could crash and burn back down to $150. My verdict: Don't go long OR short. Stay away."
Sell and come over to ROKU
Netflix shining again
NFLX may hit $285 this Friday....Don't short NFLX before its momentum stops. It can move much higher...I have been seen this thing happened tons of times before:
Feel bad for anyone bought in today. Beware the over valued high PE stocks.
Buy the lunchtime dip. Closing 375+ today.
"Wow, I am rich"
Gonna start seeing a runup to earnings
"And there ladies and Gentlemen is the ""Option Boy Spike"" I talked about earlier. They have had to work very hard today to keep this above 285 with absolutely zero institutional interest in this stock in a big up day. but things must be done and it simply is not allowed that retail put buyers make money so they must be destroyed,"
Here it comes!
We are closing to $360 today!
It's so great to be invested in a stock that market makers and fund managers want to see over $400 regardless on what's going on in the world or all Wall Street. Congrats to the rest of you longs that got in over the last 3 months. Sometimes making money in stocks is really this easy. And remember shorts... NEVER bet against momentum or the desire of what fund managers want the outcome to be for a stock. $400+ next month my friends!
375 tomorrow
Any buying is met and overwhelmed with quick selling.

not selling nothing. Saving for my 11 year old
"Six month base. Analysts missed badly last 3 quarters, nonGAAP was 5% below estimates, then 12, 19%. Why couldn't eps be over $2 Q4 2020?"
Netflix has corrected more in the past. It will recover.
So cheap now should jump $25 today at least
from a chart point of view Netflix is at the bottom completely washed out and oversold. its a great entry point imho

"Based off historic Netflix stock price, this is set to fall for a few days, have a tiny bounce, and then drop off a ledge"
Could Netflix actually end on a high note today!! No 3pm decline!?! Woohoo!
"They are on fast track going from licensing content to producing their own which has high upfront costs and returns coming only 1 to 2 years later. So how can they still keep a 25% subscriber growth rate!?? They must be saving a ton producing their own content. This company is in a sweet spot. When they reach the production/ licensing balance they're looking for higher cash flows will kick in, subscriber growth rate will be at a high, and profits will soar. 500 by years end and 1000 in 3 to 5 years."
I love Netflix
I haven't looked at or listened to news for 4 days and my sanity is just coming back..... cant stand the noise....
200 dollars at most!
"Netflix (NFLX) has 2 splits in our Netflix stock split history database. The first split for NFLX took place on February 12, 2004. This was a 2 for 1 split, meaning for each share of NFLX owned pre-split, the shareholder now owned 2 shares. For example, a 1000 share position pre-split, became a 2000 share position following the split. NFLX's second split took place on July 15, 2015. This was a 7 for 1 split, meaning for each share of NFLX owned pre-split, the shareholder now owned 7 shares. For example, a 2000 share position pre-split, became a 14000 share position following the split."
NFLX is projected to more than double its EPS this year'; up from 1.25 to 2.85. That's huge!
So sell or hold? Verdict please less than an hour remaining

This is very interesting... is either going up or down or flat.... one of those 3 scenarios for sure
"getting back to where I bought it. I'm at a break even on this now, the other techs I own are still coming back up from the hit, my valuation puts the Nasdaq at a 50% discount to the s&p 500 and Dow. Needless to say it is a better buy than most other world markets. Easy buy for long term."

I AM HOLDING A HUGE POSITION (seven digits). SO FAR -5% loss. Shall I sell or hold longer ? Thanks for advice!!!
"Is this some kinda joke???? Under 500$..,, Why??????"
"Netflix has a finger on the pulse of what the general public wants. If you check social media, there are memes being created and shared by the thousands about Netflix content. Hulu and Netflix both put out Fyre Festival documentaries. I don't know a single person who was talking about Hulu's. Critics talk about how the Adam Sandler movies and Bird Box were awful. That's true, but it doesn't matter. Because the general public consumed the content in record breaking numbers. I think people miss the bigger picture with this company."
GS just added NFLX on their Buy list with a increase of pps of 79% from today’s level! Let’s hope they get this one correct!

"If you want to earn $30 per share by Tuesday, then you have the opportunity NOW."
Fubo TV will be acquired by Netflix soon
the fact that the market is going down and Netflix maintains that 13% proves how strong the buying is..
If you were long you could afford to have your own.
"It’s in a good shape now. My only concern is very high expectation. Anything even small, may knock it down"
subscribers ran when Susan Rice went on the board and the company annc. a deal with the obamas.
"Did Trump speak , is that why the markets are down LOL"
Buying here at a 24% discount. Invest now while the stock is on sale. Opportunities like this don’t come often. Blue Light Special Folks.
Wake Up!
we had seen the greatest show NFLX had put for us... from $344 to $379 just one day...we are hoping for more great show today from $379 back to normal $423... Go Go Go NFLX!!!
Watch for a major drop. Price is getting way ahead of the financials. Soon there will be a correction and watch the frothy stocks get a 40-50% cut.
if it was going to 360 it would be half the way there. obviously being bought. up ..500 by labor day
"the 10 year is 3%rates are moving upretail sales low, this monthinterest rates uptime for nflx to correct?"
it is not the pathway Amazon is experiencing ? and if so why not Netflix!
Here is one analyst history of price target.GBH:-1/17:- Raise from 235 to 2552/15:- Raise to 3153/8:- Raise to $375 5/17:- Raised again to $4006/18:- Raised to $500.First does yearly price target change so much???? 5 time in 5 month.So what common theme about this Analyst???? price reach with in $10-$15 of previous target. Can you believe this?I guess we should start 20 firm with different price target on stock we love and hot in market and put computer who keep announce price target increase when last price target reach with in $10.
amazing watching people come here to brag about losing money on NFLX short positions...
These bears that have been predicting total destruction each quarter have been saying this since Netflix was 50 bucks. Now its 600% higher in a few years and on the cusp of hitting a new gear in growth with India and with a lower tax rate. What credible evidence is out there that all of the sudden this is going to reverse course? It's not happening gents. $400 by end of year easily.
https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/12/netflix-emmy-nominations/amp/
I think this will break 600 easy. I kept mine through all the rough and tumble.
I'm down 20% ($20K) on a $100K investment here. I'm not sure this thing is going to turn around. Should I dump or wait for a turnaround? Everyday it gets worse and worse.
"one word: STCN, next 1000%"

If they are talking about buying back their own stock they must think it’s cheap. This increases the chances for another 7 to 1 stock split.
This stock typically wakes up late. Just watch later today and tomorrow
More people will cancel NFLX with price hike and moving to other channels.

im so glad I sold this thing when it was in the mid 560's. It was such a drag on my porfolio between earnings. I will prob buy into it again when it dips to 470's...
The market leaders r toppy i submit the market can do nothing for months now as new leaders emerge and new names like $dmyi $vldr $dm $aone and several more who are new or already crashed to fair value meanwhile whole world is trapped in $aapl $nflx $googl $roku $tsla $now $dt $twlo etc and are wel known and topppppped out
"A nice little after hours recovery, I hope this is indicative of things to come leading up to the earnings call."
And the shorts are all crying
All stocks seem too expensive now. Market needs corrections.
"Call and Put trading lately weird. I do lot of trading. I have this exprience since last few weeks specially with $CAT and $NFLX.Here is what I learn.When I try to sell put and if it don't sell even it's near bid, I think that mean stock likely going up.If try to sell put and able to sell near ask, stock likley going downSame with Calls.In other word, They are lately controling entire market. If you want to find biggest AI Usage, you will find in Stock market. Those AI software know exactly where market going because they are making market.Dangerous world. Small Computer mistake can cause unreasonable losses and when it work, it design to do unthinkable."
"Read an article today stating that the intrinsic value based on 10 year outlook is $290. That assumes 50% penetration worldwide in 10 years. To me, that seems like a lofty projection, and even with this expectation, the current intrinsic value is less than where it's trading today. No idea what to do with this one."
I guessed wrong. Cost me 10k in puts. I really thought we were at netflix fatigue. Congrats to everybody who's about to get paid off tomorrow!
Options action suggests a 8% move...up or down. That’s about a $30 move.
"forming a base for the next leg up, shorts beware"
I figured it out Netflix stock price inverse’s cash flow. (Operating Cash Flow) -1.79BNext year expected to be -4 billion get ready for NFLX to double!
At least NFLX is unaffected by that tariffs thing.
"Just think, this thing is climbing and we still have more than a week before earnings."
still holding
Netflix alone is saving my portfolio from all my other stinkers today!
NFLX momentum==1. ER2. FANGS stock in uptrend now!
I bailed. Not good trading action for me. Need nerves of steel and ain’t got’m anymore.

What you guys think where Nflx would b by Friday
its over :(
"the pumpers actually put out such crapola statements that they must be laughing behind the curtain."" The irishman and 4 other titles could kick start the stock""These guys are insane. kick start the stock?? you have to be joking. the stock is already valued at 138,000 million.someone has to tell me how this valuation is remotely sane. At 125 million members they value each one of you roughly1000 apiece. What does netflix own that is worth this much? It certainly is not the content. because they have to keep producing NEW content to keep the existing members happy. And with all the competitors the prices of the studios and actors that netflix buys to put on their site with the original title is shooting higher."
This should pop any minute now to 320
"Whoever buys $NFLX BUBBLE at that ABSURD Valuation, DESERVES to LOSE EVERYTHING and WILL LOSE EVERYTHING!KEEP GAMBLING!"
I bet Amazon or Apple is buying it
The premium plans price is increasing to £13.99 starting from the 25th February 2021 !! This is going to make netlfix stocks go even higher
I don't see what's so great about this anymore...they have some good original content but that's it...they are gonna eventually loss most other good content and they don't do anything special everyone knows how to stream content I never had a problem with disney ....maybe it's worth $100
Stock was heading for breakout before market turned yesterday. I’m going to buy on today’s selloff ahead of earning momentum
Sell or hold until Monday? I'm down big. I bought at 347. Please advise
Netflix is trading high just because of buying back news. Otherwise they are losing ground big time. They will face real competition from Disney!
"big boys want this at 475 to 500, dont fight it."
"NFLX usually drops 15-20 points after the earning, but soon recovers in next few days.i will buy some calls 2 days after the earning....Wednesday..if my palms start itching I MAY BUY FEW PUTS IN AM to make double dip"

This downward momentum is just like the upward momentum of the past 6 months. And it will continue at least til it tests $290
"Is $NFLX BUBBLE a FREE MONEY ATM????The stock price is getting PUMPED Parabolically without a single break, while the Earnings are TANKING!!!"
last earnings it was hovering 400 albeit it dropped after the good earnings. now it's at 20 percent or so less.
This is going to come crashing down I sold it if you don’t believe nothing you can do about it ....

Netflix earnings preview https://www.google.com/amp/s/news.alphastreet.com/netflix-earnings-preview-q2-2018/amp/
So Netflix told the story of the market downturn before it even happened. Check out early January..it baselines and start to fall...and if NETFLIX is baselining and falling no matter how small to start...that is the canary in the coal mine for sure.

"Thanks to those who bought OTM options, I will take good care of the money you have transferred to me."
I said it would be at 370 here we come
Don't buy into GS's bs. It is so funny to read that the street is trying to 'decouple' NFLX from the FANG and this stock is running purely on the new 'Brick box' release.
Bye bye shorts. Z
"Internet moves very fast along with AI. If your a company and it takes you 3 years to ramp up....u are essentially late in the game. By the time Disney Ramos up, Netflix will have 300 million subscribers and will be producing most of the 4K content out there. It will also secure the top contracts for producers and talent out there for the next 5 years.....Disney will find out soon enough what is the point of ramping up if they can’t find talent"

Netflix is recession proof. In fact it will do very well during a recession. The value proposition is unbeatable. Netflix will take remaining market shar from cable companies during a recession.
"Netflix Hiring the Obama's to make programming, Hosting Michelle Wolf and her pro abortion rants. Doesn't matter what side you are on a smart business steers clear of politics."
I love Netflix all you bashers probably bought in at 400 that's why your upset.
"""The firm's upside case now crosses 300mm paid subs in 4Q23, up from prior 2Q24. Under this scenario, NFLX shares would be worth $713 12-months from now. @Street_Insider"
"Wow , stays green.."
If Germany throws a tariff on Netflix then it goes down another $50. It is only a matter of time before some foreign government figures out that they can make 10 to 20% off Netflix.
"450 this week, possible ?"
"Load up. Netflix target to $610 (from $585) with 'bull case' of $700 and BUY rating at JefferiesJefferies analyst Alex Giaimo raised the firm's price target on Netflix to $610 from $585 and reiterates a Buy rating on the shares. Netflix's United States and Canada price hikes coupled with an ""improved pipeline"" can drive upside to estimates in 2021, Giaimo tells investors in a research note. ""Surprise hits"" like The Queen's Gambit and ""tentpole hits"" like The Crown reinforce the company's ""outsized consumer value proposition, says the analyst. Giaimo increased fiscal 2021 estimates Netflix and has a ""bull cash"" of $700 for the shares. The stock closed Monday up $17.47 to $515.78."
Anyone bought at 420 ?
No Netflix is not facing competition overseas. Yes Netflix is winning original content award. Yes people know it. Yes people want entertainment. No people don’t mind 10$ a month. No none of the above is a factor in the stock market. Yes this is fall is market wide. Buy and forget
Why does CNBC allow a short seller who was likely short BEFORE he went on air...a forum to simply put money in his pocket??
remember when netflix hit 700 and split 7 ways back to 100 a share that's now 350 a shade could be coming again soon!!!
All those gift cards got cashed in this quarter. It's going to be great quarter.
"Here is yet another reason I think large scale paid by investor operation going.Last week when I search Netflix cookies on Youtube for last 1 week, I find lot of videos that have large no of views & up vote.Now today I find near 0 for India specific and only some Latin america targeted (I don't know spanish and portuguese so can't really understand fully on method unless I watch them closely. no point to spend that much time.).Now we all know Quarter ended last week and I consider such coincident is proof on this entire activity driven by investor groups."
I should have so at 385 and took some of what I lost back in because this does not look like a good sign falling back under 370. Now it will probably struggle to stay above that.
"RBC — outperform rating, target price to $450 from $480“Q2 Subs came in materially light, due to a weak new content slate & some price hike pushback. The Subs miss wasn’t unprecedented, though the International miss magnitude was greater than normal. The Q3 &’19 Subs outlooks were strong, however. We believe the Long Thesis is intact, though we are incrementally less bullish. Price target reduced from $480 to $450. Maintain Outperform.”"
"all of you shorts are going to be annihilated when Netflix passes 400 and then 500keep with your doom and gloom, see how it works out for you"
There is a very good chance we see new record high for the stock after it reports solid earnings report in just 3 weeks. IMHO.

"can someone give me some advice if I should purchase a stock of this rn, I am very very new but can see that this is a good price to buy and sell by the end of the week for a quick 50 bucks but if I'm wrong or anyone has advice id love to hear"
"So as inflation and more importantly interest rates go up, how does that impact Netflix earnings. Interest on debt is a huge % of their expenses, so rising interest rates would seriously hamper their profit growth expectations.Not a shorter, just sharing my thoughts...."
nflx goes down because it's over value and many competitors. Tariff is not the reason. earning $ isn't catching up with expenses
It is clear to me that NFLX will rise past $400 in a few days...Asian growth not even factored in the numbers yet...wow
hahatake off baby!!!!
is now the right time to get in?
Can someone educate me that how they only expect 21% revenue growth when they just hiked 18% price on the subscription? Are they only expecting 3% growth if they didn’t hike the price v？
Just got a message from NFLX my monthly charge now is $17.95 by january 5th.. Not smart doing that when the us economy is imploding..

Nflx can't seem to stay above 290. It looks like that is where they are going to suppress it.

Remember when a stock comes down where it becomes flat it allows the buyers that’s wants in for a pull down and when shorts recover it will take the stock higher. This one was flat for 5-6 straight days.
You called it!
"Disney says they will turn a streaming profit in 4years, but over the past 13 years no one has made any money competing against Netflix."
This earnings is good will go to 500
This move looks to me like NFLX is ready to raise funds again.
Today easy $40.00 pop. This going to run so fast up that the banks aren’t going to have time to get in at a low price. Buy early I LOVE NETFLIX
I can't find any news for this kind of volatility that fast
"Nflx always runs pre earnings. Held that $500 nicely, here we go boys get ready. $550+ coming soon!!"

Here we go! :)
At this rate NFLX will buy Mickey
Will Disney's $12.99 bundle put price pressure on the rest of the competition coming into the streaming market? How will this price pressure affect Netflix?
Thanks for the good run Netflix but I’ll be banking while I can.
Netflix will post good results i have a feeling.

Is NFLX being pumped by analysts so their big clients can get out at a decent price?It doesn’t make any sense to upgrade a stock facing negative cash flow + huge debt + rising interest rates + rising competition from other content owners launching their own streaming service

Don't make the mistake of looking at Netflix separate from the emerging streaming market. With it and being the clear leader they have outstanding growth visibility.
"@Anonymous, do you short other stocks? I have some free money to invest and go long....."

"congrats to those who held! last ER, it went back from 550 to 485$"
Surprised it’s up so much given the revenue and eps. I guess subscriber numbers are good enough to offset. Congrats to those who had the nerve to hold through earnings. Given the last couple of quarters it was risky
Recovering nicely! Back to previous high in no time!
40 more minutes....
Hopefully Andrew Left is still holding his 325 short. POS. Can’t stand finance channels allowing these people to tout a short (or long) stock to enrich their own wallet. At worst there should be a counter point on air with them.

The result will be an explosion in non-US subscriptions, which we're already starting to see evidence for in the most recent couple of quarters.This growth will, in turn, further accelerate the decline in traditional TV viability as ""cord cutting"" becomes pervasive. Expect continued upside ""surprises"" as this industry transformation continues. All good news for NFLX shareholders.”"

"Looks like this is going to $330 today. Likely $350 by end of the week and then $400 before earnings release. After that, I would expect at least $500 by end of April. That would give it a market cap of $216 billion. Seems like $700 by the end of the year is doable if they can continue to beat on subs."
I would not short until it breaks that 50 day on a day chart. It's going to take some bad Market news.
THE BULLS ARE COMING 375 soon start getting your saddle ready because it’s going to be a real ride. NETFLIX FOR LIFE

Doubled my Netflix position today! How high does everyone think Netflix can go in the next 12 months?
Can we break resistance tomorrow? Decided to enter a short term trade based of bullish in engulfing on one day charts

"I cut my cable. I got tired of paying forprograming and then having to watch 5 minutes comericals every 20 minutes. With Netflex I can watch what I want when I want with no comericals.

"Netflix price target raised to $650 from $640 at Morgan Stanley, OverweightMorgan Stanley analyst Benjamin Swinburne raised the firm's price target on Netflix to $650 from $640 and keeps an Overweight rating on the shares. Media remains ""very cyclical"" and he expects 2021 to be a year of top-line strength, said Swinburne. While he thinks Netflix has been ""perhaps the most positively affected by COVID tailwinds"" given the long-term benefits from shifting streaming behaviors, the stock has not seen any multiple expansion, said Swinburne, who sees the potential for Netflix's margin expansion to ""break out"" beyond the 300 basis points per year level to which the company has guided."
Stocks never do what you think they'd do after earnings. The last earnings call the stock rallied so now everyone thinks it will do it again. Been burned too many times.

"As long as growth keeps occurring and content keeps improving, the debt is not an issue. Ad revenue hasn't even been discussed, which I'm sure is in their long term plan (a NFLX basic plan that's cheaper but has ads, a NFLX Premium plan to skip the ads). They can get 80 million sets of eyeballs on a movie in a week. Think about that. That's the equivalent of Kardashian's Instagram, and she gets hundreds of thousands of dollars per post. Completely untapped revenue. The key metric right now is growth."
Who’s buying tomorrow!

You guys think this will recover within the next couple days?
You guys noticed all pro-NFLX articles these past 72 hours on Yahoo Finance's front page?
When you see NFLX profits
"NFLX is still WAY too high, Per Jim Cramer. needs to come down to be a buy, closer to 200 dollars. Nobody in there right mind is touching it here with this market performing the way it is. I WOULD SELL HERE take some profits and buy it back at 200"

"Netflix Inc.'s stock price target was cut to $458 from $463 by analyst David Miller at Imperial Capital, after the streaming video giant tapped the junk-bond market for the ninth time in six years. Meanwhile, Miller reiterated his bullish outperform rating, saying Netflix has a history of using the bond market effectively. The stock rose 0.9% in morning trade. Earlier this week, Netflix said it was offering $2 billion worth of U.S. and euro denominated debt, which Moody's rated at Ba3, which was three notches below the investment-grade rating threshold. As Miller said, the U.S. portion of the issuance will launch at 5.375% and the euro portion will launch at 3.875%, for a blended rate of 4.475%. In comparison, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 4.20% during the April 25 week. Miller said that Netflix has showed that tapping the debt markets has resulted in ""clear-cut, tangible, global subscriber growth and retention,"" as he assumes the proceeds from the latest debt issuance will go toward content acquisition, mostly on the self-produced side. The stock has climbed 18.4% over the past 12 months while the S&P 500 has gained 9.8%."
another price hike already gonna lose tens of millions of subs
Applause to all the doomsday shorts today
"""With the exception of Netflix, I don't think"" it's too late to buy FAANG, Cramer said on Mad MoneyGuess the upside for NFLX is limited at this point"
Let's face it. HBO Max is going to have better content next year.
Netflix just surpassed Disney on market cap
Was there a GS upgrade? Got link?
"Netflix should tank back to the 250-300 range, buying range. It shouldn’t have climbed so high."
"Netflix is still up around 20000% in last 15 years. I never did understand how this company goes up everyday trading at 140 times earnings and losing billions every year. I know it is all about subscriber growth, but still never deserved to be up 20000%."

Got in at $287 and I’m not getting out. Netflix is gold; it will bounce right back up.
"The stock is very, very cheap now. Only Netflix has the subscriber growth which leads to more content."
WOOHOO! Most of my loses from the past 3 years made up in a week of NFLX calls.
stock went down 3% after the announcement of the previous cfo then went up 800% since then.
"Volume already at 5 million, lots of upward pressure and buys!"
$265-$270 is definitely possible but I may be selling and going the other-way at the 20-day moving average. Still in a downtrend unless it breaks through that level on volume.
Sold at $309.20. Lunch time!!!
"Three massive gaps since the beginning of the year. This is extremely unusual with a stock that had no earning news. It indicates probably a short squeeze, even though there is not much short interest on NFLX. But it also tells me those gaps will close sooner rather than later."
This stock kind of reminds me of netscape during the browser wars.... it's just a matter of time before the big guns get it together and grab the majority of market share. The win is that netflix would be a great acquisition for either apple or disney. IMHO
Netflix dominates Emmys ! Was incredible !!
Woohoo stock buy backs coming!!! $575 tonight
You can think of NFLX like a roulette wheel - for every 18 reds there are two greens.
"Going to continue sideways until earnings and if it's a miss, going back to $200"
Just wow! I sold at $252 for a quick gain. But congrats to those who stayed in!
up up up
Sell it folks
Buying puts as will continue to fall for next few days with analyst downgrades
"We are going much higher than ""three fifty"" this week."

"Netflix's balance sheet is a disaster. On 3/31/16, total debt was $8.9 bill vs. on 12/31/18 debt soared to $20.7 bill. Cash & equiv over the same timeframe only went from $2.1 bill to $3.8 bill. For year-ending 12/31/18, Netflix showed net inc of $2.68/sh diluted. The problem is that they're cash flow negative. There's a line in the Statement of Cash Flows for $13.0 billion, for ""Additions to streaming content assets."" The $13.0 bill was capitalized instead of expensed. It's not clear they'll ever see that money and may very well have to write it off. Shares closed at $360. Even if the eps of $2.68 for 2018 was legite, which it isn't, the p/e ratio is extremely high for a company cash-flow negative. Interest expense is creeping up, i.e., $150.1 mill for 2016 vs. $420.5 mill for 2018. The interest expense is rising b/c debt is rising, i.e., on 12/31/16, long term debt was $3.4 bill vs on 12/31/18, long term debt was $10.4 bill. Movie studios aren't giving away their movies for free. Original content is costly to produce. Needless to say, I've gone short the stock."
great buying opportunity a week before earnings. I'm sure the funds are making the price lower so they can buy more after shorting it which sadly is legal by the SEC.
Netflix is expanding foreign language original programming that will drive subscriber growth beyond expectations.Company has unappreciated and unexploited pricing power.
Eddy Cue just said Apple is not in the business of making big acquisitions like NFLX. But still all-in on media content.
Any idea why we have a 4% drop today! No news that I could find. Earnings don't come out for another 46 days.

I am happy with this trade today. It recoveries all my lost from TSLA and NKLA last year.
I really do not like holding a position in a company when earnings hit but I may just try a short position on Netflix. I think the numbers would have to be great to move the needle higher and I expect them to be no better than good and maybe a little negative .

Disney + isn't a rival-it's just another streaming service. Most households will have both netflix and disney +.

I get flash backs of $NFLX with the report. All I now is they are gaining subscribers and spending money on content. Sounds Familiar
Netflix price target raised to $650 from $625 at CowenCowen analyst John Blackledge raised the firm's price target on Netflix to $650 from $625 and keeps an Outperform rating on the shares. The analyst said his survey suggests its US pricing power continues to rise and he expects paid net additions to come in above guidance.
"I see the same arguments from the $TSLA shorts that were prevalent when $NFLX $AMZN were losing money during their expansion (BTW they are still expanding!!). Unlike the other companies, making cars and building necessary infrastructure is very costly. And yet, they ignore the fact that every single car tesla sells makes money (that is cost per car is less than what they sell for) and the reason for quarterly loss is the money spent paying for debt, and infrastructure building. They way things are going no capital raise needed and they are selling enough cars every month with enough margin to make the spending and expansion sustainable. Longs are not looking for profits right away (of course it will be nice), expansion is the game right now to make sure your #1 position is maintained when all these ICE makers are trying to compete with you with little to no success so far. The only ones bringing up profitabiulity and doubt are the shorts..no doubt about it. But next week they are about to be bamboozled"
Expected report @ 4:05 pmNow is the time people to BUY BUY!!!!
"Up on the downgrade, makes perfect sense."
Millions without jobs and they have increased the monthly fee! I don’t know guys! This could ended up really bad after hours .... just saying!
I wish Yahoo had a way to sum up all of our posts at the end of the year. Some of these guys who shorted NFLX and then freaked out on these boards would be mortified to reread their posts at the end of the year. Or 5 years later. What are you thinking?
Analysts continue to raise price targets and this stock continues to fall. Go figure
Own NFLX and DIS...People are being SHORT SIGHTED! More than 1 service will make it! In addition ...Netflix streams PERIOD!

I hate to say it but back to 400 it goes
"Buying opportunity for sure. Look at your history here...every sell off has turned into a chance to buy and make money. The sub model they have blew it this quarter, but they set the bar low for next quarter and they’ll beat it handily. This is always the weakest quarter with little new content. Add to that the fact that they’re just in their infancy in Asia. Short term pain down to 320 in the near term, but up up and away is the long term destination."

"The best explanation of what the problem with NFLX is articulated in the article below. The price action is beginning to show that the market is finally realizing that NFLX is overvalued. One could argue that the action is simply in line with the market move, but if one reviews the price action closely, you can see the initial stages of facing reality has begun.The likelihood that NFLX will breach its high of ~286 is very small for a very long time. Instead, watch it bounce around a bit with a bias towards a steady decline that will bring it to the 186 area. Could go down much further than that.NFLX is a great company that, quoting the article, is ""incomprehensibly overvalued"".https://investorplace.com/2018/02/nflx-stock-uncertain-future/#.Wn8QJainHIU"

"thats all???? all the cries for 30 bucks under a share? if you look any farther than a day, week and even a month... nothing to worry. to big of a company to fold after a bad qtr. and u know what, not as bad of a report than many talk about. invest.... and go live your life. do not check any stock on hourly basis. not healty down the road"
Extraction movie amazing. Simultaneously hits USA and Indian market. Genius CEO Hastings. Original content cannot be beaten.
"Every other streaming platform will run out of steam subsidizing their small number of shows, and the monster Netflix will be a winner as usual. 350 inevitable so watch u after earnings shorties. We will see u cry like babies soon on the other side. Netflix rocks. This price action is a blip and a must buy opportunity"
590 call Feb 18??
told you $210 by Friday!
"UPDATE: so much for 450 hitting by Friday, you long-term guys still dont get it, nothing goes straight up...not even AMZN....AMZN still got 100-300 pullbacks once above 400. You gotta know when to exit, then back in at much lower levels. We like NFLX long again between 350-370. Told you guys this way back when nflx was hitting 420. We got our SHORT covers, and now we are waiting PATIENTLY for lower levels to hit. Between general market pullback here and pure technicals on NFLX daily chart, this is practically certain for more drop....350-370 range."
"Just think, this stock was down $14 today and a stock like TSLA was unchanged. There's no justice."
A lot of people are switching to Amazon Prime and note they have a lot more content than they used to have..
the most overvalued thing of the century.Litteraly went up about 30B$ in 1 week without any news while the company makes less then 500M a year with a massively huge debt.
"So Disney has a Market Cap of $323 B and Netflix has $222B, so which has a better valuation"
Will Netflix have the same fate as Blockbuster video in future?
Yes it’s all about the numbers reported but there does appear to be a negative psychology and sentiment
"If NFLX announces a stock split, $600 will be taken out."
520 by Friday
Gottal love those analysts: upgrade after the stock has made a 35% move in two weeks and is up already 22% YTD.
"It was the best day yesterday. Finally got out of a lot of stocks. I was waiting for the opportunity. I am a bit skeptical about this job report. If the government is not working, who compiled this report? I think it was a political stunt to arrest the market fall by Trump administration. If the manufacturing index came out so bad showing manufacturing shrinking, it seems counterintuitive to think that the manufacturers would be adding jobs. Anyway, cash is the king right now. Will wait for opportunities."
AH price soaring with huge volume Tue should be up an easy $30 best momentum play on the boards economy way too strong to worry fundamentals.
Buy it at $230Backfill needed...
I have been searching for a site that will send me extra income producing stock tips and I think ive finally found it. If you are like me and in need of stock tips that produce good monthly income then you need to go to (http://Multistockalerts.com) now!
I paid $15 a share before 7:1 split. Trust me this goes higher.
High of the day! wait until the markets to go green this afternoon
what - insiders not loading up on a good deal?
"some techinicals suggest a sell off50 dma 313100 dma 290 rsi over 70if it sells off, it might be 20 points or morethere is a gap at 325, maybe it will go there to fill the gapconsider the growing debt and PE of 283, would be nice to see it go to the 100 dma at $290. That's a 63 point drop from here. If the earnings isn't so hot, or subs, the price might drop below the 100 dma and that will become resistance for a while. Imagine all the stops below. There may be 10's of millions of shares that were purchased below a dollar or not purchased, maybe handed out to management."
Goldman has confirmed $400 NETFLIX is on its own way!
Today's short covering and buy force may bid NFLX up 8%+!
Should’ve bought another 312.50 put! Stock dropping a lot in the after hour
If you want to get in... Buy now before 400.
All time high by the end of the month
"the shorts have allredy cover, the greddy bears will be stuck"
"I remember the last time NFLX took a hit from earnings and next earning I decided to short the stock, what a big mistake that was and I had to cover my shorts, I was in the house of pain. I've been waiting buying my time waiting for the next time NFLX take at hit at earnings, because this earnings, this stock is going to fly high. the next two days I expect 15 points each day and earnings day 10/15/18 I expect 40 to 50 point depends how much people have to cover their shorts. Painful experience but I learn fast"
If I were invested in Netflix... I’d start thinking of an exit strategy. Seriously. All they do is put old movies on Netflix and consistently raise the prices. They just raised my prices again ~ when I was just thinking the other day- how terrible their programming is. I canceled- I bet a lot of other’s will cancel as well. Netflix sux!
"$DIS and $NFLXwho going to ultimate winner.Business perspective both will winner along with CBS and HBO. (HULU will majority own by Disney soon and likely buy atleast time warner 10%, Comcast might not sell it's 30% given fight between company)Stock perspective:-NFLX will big loser (Current Growth is unsustainable and so it will take many years to justify such valuation)Disney:- Huge winner. They likely worth $250B valuation in 3 year as it become clear that it's wining market share. (WIth so much superhits kids content, Sports It sure going to take over market share).Apple is disruptor and can take huge pile of money to take over market. Disney still winner because Apple willing to pay high dollar for content still."
Market up again tomorrow. Now it is the decision time. Sell into the rally and reap gains or hold a little more. But what if markets tank again. I hate this decision time. I guarantee if I sell it will keep going up and if I hold the market will tank. Happens everytime lol
Are we gone see $650 soon?
52 week high coming by the end of the month. Today's turnaround is awesome.
"Hedge fund managers working OT trying to drive price down to cover their short position. DON""T SELL. Put your Sell order at 600"
"Isn't this supposed to be blowing past $500 according to all the ""I am in love with NFLX"" bulls on this board?"
bought at 188.5 ?did i do it right?
I'm done with this stock. So many losses.
I told you
"I love NFLX, but cancelling Daredevil and The Punisher was a big mistake! Seriously! Those shows were amazing and just getting into their prime, there was so much left to tell in the stories and so many dedicated fans! Netflix needs to sit down with Marvel and renegotiate a deal to bring back Daredevil and The Punisher."

"@Gregory Too many to name, my friend, with the same first name. I’m an actor and over the last 2 yrs there are 4x more Netflix auditions because of the shift out of Hollywood. Hollywood sells to China and 16 year olds in America now with superhero movies taking over. The good scripts don’t bring people to theaters any longer and so it pushes the action to Netflix who’s giving actors their own shows. Glad I bought in recently."
NFLX 375 tomorrow
"Today was due to Golden Globe.... Weeks later , Oscar is coming.... Hahahahaha.. Another rally.. Then earning... Oh god... I will be rich"
"If Netflix eventually reaches 1 billion subscribers, and I don't see anyone impeding them from doing that, then 195 or 325 or 425, they're all very cheap."
Party to be continue tomorrow
Zero catalysts for rest of yearHahahaha
the other faangs has some modest drop. This one fall hard. Why?
"I may buy calls tomorrow. NFLX seems to be very strong. I'll decide tomorrow morning.(I mean, ""Shouldn't she be $320 by now?"" Well, she isn't? Why?)"

Here we go!
"For me Key question will answer in 4 hour. If this is 390+ I will have 2000 short. If below 390 I will have 1600 short.If there is sudden Sell off and close below 382.5 I will have 1200 short.I let market decide my fate for next few days as there is no point to sell put for little premium at such inflated price. It's very hard to make decision on whether start selling near money put (For like 25%) or wait for this excitement end. While this is way over done, I can't predict which price it will stop going up and start going down. Since Regardless it trade 340 or 400 it's way more over value."
Booming
450 today ?
1 billion subscribers by 2030
"NFLX is a generational stock, it will keep rising as long as the Browns keep losing"
Should be green by EOD
Stay well away....
NFLX cooking books ! how do we know that this is not all made up on the subscriptions ?
You hire Susan Rice and Obama and look what happens.
So tempted to get more here.
Oh....up some more....time to take some profits before giving it all back or even worse....become negative
nflx announcing 1 to 3 split at earnings.
Not rich but I bought only 10 shares at 332 2 years ago. I’m selling 5 when I double and leave the rest for my sons he’s 11. Going to surprise him when he’s goi g to college or university
Stocks go up and down. Not worried. Holding for $500. Could be end of year or mid next year. Either way I don't care. Have fun selling for those that wish to do so.
ER push. I'm buying.
Never sell on weakness of the people trying to scare you out of your money.
"I don’t think there’s too much to worry about Disney service In my opinion. Most folks have both as I do. Some don’t even have cable tv anymore. So having both is an advantage to the customer. It would be another issue if it was illegal to own both. At the current subscription price, most can afford both. Now I would start to worry if these services were to increase to $40-$50 monthly subscription. That’s a price point where most would start to pick one or the other. I wish both success as it has rocketed competition for better content."
Margin calls for those who shorted below $200 are about over. Next week this will trend down below $240
"R-E-L-A-X. President Trump cannot afford these trade talks to fail since his re-election bid will be based on the economy. When he strikes a trade agreement with China, the rally will resume with NFLX approaching all time highs. Buy the weakness."
"Year Of Birth: 1994Year Of Demise: 2007Ceo: Jim BarksdaleFounded By: Jim Clark & Marc AndreessenIt's not hyperbole to say Netscape was one of the most important companies in the history of the Internet. The computer services company is credited with developing JavaScript and had an incredibly rewarding IPO as its stock soared from $28 to more than $75 on the first day of trading. At its peak, Netscape Navigator's market share was over 90-percent. November 24, 1998 would prove to be the turning point in the company's history as AOL announced it would acquire Netscape for over $4 billion. Some saw it simply as a play by AOL to unshackle itself from Microsoft (AOL's browser was based on Internet Explorer). Updates began to slow and the browser began to shed users. By 2003, Time Warner had disbanded Netscape, laid-off the programmers, and removed the logo from its building."

We know nflx lost 130k subs net in the us. I want to know how many subs were actually lost not offset by new additions
9 days in a row of gains. Don't follow into this crowded trade.
No better stock out there.
And the dumping begins
"dipping the toes in. i think nflx had a 1quarter ""blip"" and will be north of $400 by year end."
Is it True that NetMuzxi is hiring Kap to work with Susan Rice and Obama in Project Get on Knees for IRAN???
"wow cash flow positive, what an accomplishment. is that hard to do?"
"Now that Facebook has been tagged it, NFLX can start digging out of the dip. The analysts are still behind it and the World growth story is still intact. I'm thinking another new high before year end."
Come on...it is a 600$ stock!!!!
Congrats to long
"They are going to throw a good day in there every now and then to get the public to think everything is ok but the market is tanking lower and lower. The dow will be under 23k soon. The good days will go up just a tad to trick people to put their money in so they can trap you the following day. One day up 100 points, the next day down 300-500 points."
Netflix comes to Sky Q boxes in November https://www.engadget.com/2018/09/19/netflix-sky-q-november/?yptr=yahoo
Is is still worth buying in right now ? Or wait for a dip?!
"Time to buy. Message board and market way too negative. This stock is being unfairly lumped in with all of the other FAANGs . The growth story is intact. If economy tanks, consumers look for bargains in entertainment spending and NFLX fits that category."
"Debtflix's junk bond addction:""When Netflix (NFLX) priced a $1.9B junk bond deal early last week, it got me pondering the companies with the largest equity market capitalizations in the high-yield corporate debt space. After all, you do not often see companies with a $135B market cap issuing high-yield debt. While the equity market is painting a rosy outlook for the internet entertainment and digital content company, the outlook from the rating agencies and bond market is less optimistic. Netflix's new ten-year debt carried a 5.875% coupon, a 291bp spread over Treasuries at issuance. The interest cost on Netflix's debt is roughly 2% higher than where high-quality, low-levered, A-rated companies issue debt in today's market.When we look at the companies in the high-yield corporate bond market (HYG, JNK) with the largest equity market caps, Netflix certainly stands out. It is nearly twice as large from a capitalization perspective as the next largest junk-rated company, Charter Communications (CHTR)."""
Should see $380 by end of the week
Just won’t leave it alone huh? What is it with this Disney fear? I know of no one interested in all honestly. But whatever. Hastings has been underestimated before. I’ll keep adding on the dips.
425 today
#IQ volume 42.84 Mil #Netflix 6.83 Mil
Im bullish.. Netflix is the benchmark in the streaming market and too big to fail. There are still high growth possibilities plus profits will rise exponentially
Should close Friday at $215.00...options expiration. Next Tuesday morning open at $330.00 minimum. Good luck to all longs.
"The only thing I am looking forward to with Netflix is the stock split I heard about,"
Huge miss on subscriber growth and guidance AND...the stock currently trades for a whopping and nosebleed...268x... trailing earnings according to Yahoo. Bubble trouble.Look for stocks that are growing significantly faster than NFLX and trade for a significantly lower forward multiple.A T R S 
This stock has held up and should of been to 250 without down market. I expect it will open below 250 or trade through it and accelerate. It's extremely high off 50 and 100 day and expect more downside.
I need to celebrate tonight
"The sharks are circling, PE and P/B are screaming 2000, I give this market 3 months and all the fresh marks will go down like they did back then. just a matter of time."
I think we'll see $405 in the after hours.
"Tomorrow, barring any poor market conditions, I think this tests 376. If it finds support there, next stop is 390, and probably in a hurry. If I am right or wrong, I still love how she moves"
This will be back to over 510 tomorrow. Major selloff because of Capitol!
Grab the bargain before the stock heads back above 400.
"Interesting, with the company hiring Susan rice, many will cancel their service, many don't like her from the Obama administration.Enjoy this ride for now next month will be different!"
How many trump tweets will it take this weekend to allow his buddies to buy Netflix stock for under 200 per share?
Bird Box was a lot of fun to watch. Finished House of Cards in two days. Netflix has quality production far better than major networks and rival HBO lineup.
Don’t panic longs. We will get an upgrade tomorrow or news from Netflix which will push it another $20 up. $410 Friday 
After loosing earning this is up $40. Just imagine what would have happened if it had met the earning expectations.
SELL $NFLX SCAM! Netflix BUBBLE WILL COLLAPSE by 60%!
Why is this still dropping?!
"As i said yesterday, it did get numerous upgrades. Will be 10+ minimum on Tuesday next week. Dis or Time Warner can not produce local content. They are so behind."
"Has anyone else noticed or been disturbed that netflix and amazon do not offer any holiday classics for free especially in the time of covid. They are experiencing great increase in business yet not giving anything back. Un American, get you some more money Netflix, Merry X mas"
Hard to imagine people pay this price for a company that burns cash and is t profitable.
cancelled my subscription
"In the early morning, institutional investors started taking profit and selling slowly. They keep retail investors holding so they can sell high. The selling will accelerate near closing today and continue tomorrow early morning"
NFLX “down $50” since fake earnings
Set your stop losses good luck
I love bubbles. There will be a time to short but not even close yet.
Did i say i bought 100 shares at 358 and predicted it would go up in the last few hours? :))))))))))
"Bulls enjoy what your account looks like now. 5 year rsi At 871 year rsi At 826 month rsi At 78.423 month rsi At 76.351 month rsi At 76.46Stock has gone absolutely parabolic. 50 DAY MA. - $253.54 a share - stock is 31%+ higher -Even nvidia didn’t get that far.Weekly chart, stock in its history hasn’t closed 5 weeks in a row for a very very long time. 66% since 2018.Shorts are covering quick. But this type of move will be reversed quick next week. S&P is overbought in the 5 day again. Should see a massive haircut next week and will close at $315 per share minimum EOW."
Why Netflix is going down? They reported very good earning report. Does not have any impact of trade war. Still down!! Can’t believe this. Any bad news that I am not aware of?
I open a Fortune cookie and it said Netflix $500.00 soon
What’s going on ?? Why red always???
Light Volume is the first step
2 week work.... dop in one day...
NFLX is the next Amazon
"if you miss this chance, you'll regret it, soon over US$400!"
In the red all day
It going down to test the 328 low guys. Then it's gonna straddle 330 for options expiration on Friday. Might as well get comfortable...
Is this a bubble? I'm thinking it's heyday is past.
"this stock should be higher, so many analysts and news events are supporting it. If it doesn’t run up for earnings something is seriously wrong $GOOG $NFLX $WIMI"
"Buying more, thanks to I"
"Goldman and their VIP accts have been buying NFLX right after Chrstimas and even Jan 3rd when all.stocks were.tanking with AAPL warning. they already got 20% less than 1 1/2 wk, probably they will start selling right after it hits 300"
Netflix shares are trading lower despite the company reporting strong Q1 results. Analysts at multiple firms also downgraded the stock. The company said it expects membership growth to decelerate as home confinement ends.
So let me see? he shorts then bashes on CNBC or tweeter. Isn't that what they do when they tell you to buy stocks that they already own on CNBC/ I see it as activity that should be illegal in all cases - if you mention a stock sell or buy on public network like CNBC - you can't close that position for 30 days/ Perod
"It seems like NFLX is starting to correct. 202 to 189 189 to 196now down againwe'll seethe market finds its excuses to sell off after things get to bubble territorythe entire market is in that situation, except some have already corrrectednflx is 7% or so shortmoney is in at $2, $4, $10 a share, will like get out at this leveltoo much debt with an average of 6%interest rates are heading uptomorrow is another day, the sellers will likely come outno sense of selling so much when they have the bots on, let them take it upwhat a day for GE"
Look for 10% up after hours.
Monster Earning
Do I see 500 in July????oh yes.
Look at that power!
There is not 1 analyst that can rationally explain NFLX's price valuation. They don't say the P word but the way they describe it spells out PONZI scheme. The numbers make no sense to anyone and someone's gonna be a billionaire someday shorting this.
Debtflix will never achieve positive free cash flow status in any reasonable time frame. The analyst cash flow models are preposterous. Just read this article from Bloomberg.https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-04-23/will-netflix-junk-bonds-wilt-amid-the-content-wars
Susan Rice? wow.
Bought 200 shares @ 318.25
I'm totally going to have my trade pages up at the announcement.....buy or sell 100 shares cause this is going at least $10 one way or the other.....
"Funny, We subscribe to Netflix but we hardly ever watch it anymore. Wonder if there are others like us out there??"
"Friday, NFLX had a down day. If (and I mean if) Monday is a positive surprise, then we may see a Gap Up. But this is would be a special & unique Gap Up,....... a Bullish Kicker, one of the strongest bullish signals. Stay tuned....."
$500.00 on Horizon.... watch those earnings pump Netflix...
"Shareholders!You have the right to sell options on your stock. These are called "" covered calls"".If you sell Jan 2020 calls you can pocket $80 to $100 in tax deferred cash a share until trade is closed out."
why the sell off.. ??? there is no news out??
"There are 3 stocks trading in the US that start with Net Netease at $484pps Netflix at $548pps & Netlist at $0.72pps, Netlist can get the nod this week to receive damages or settlement from Google because Google used the last decade quadruple memory expansion on their search servers that allows it do deliver instant search results with access to the whole database with the enlarged memory. The patent that Google used of Netlist is mentioned in 64 Google patents patent 7,619,912 ‘912 of Netlist. Netease was a 2650 bagger from it's bottom at 0.18 & Netflix 500 bagger from its bottom at 1.08, so far Netlist is only a 7 bagger from the bottom & trades at $0.72. $NLST"
Looking worse for shorts by the minutes .....
Anyone who thinks they are buying cheap on the dip. This has always been a sub $100 stock. Anything above that is too expensive
NFLX close on Jan 7 going back to 20092009 4.672010 7.492011 25.612013 14.172014 48.502015 46.742016 114.562019 315.34

If we stay above $400 we a definitely going higher
So buy netflix and hold to 1000?
The 200 day MA is around $475. That's a buy point.
Looks like the longs have the advantage today. Let's see how the rest of the day shakes out.
I have a feeling I’m gonna regret waiting for a correction....
I bought more at 185. Hope the drop is done.
Friday is options expirations so today will be volatile for the stock price. No need to be concerned if you are long. I'm long from $70 a share.
I will buy at 200
"Shorts, RIP"
So they reported an in-line revenue # but blew away subscriber estimates. This makes no sense. If analysts got the revenue # correct how did they under estimate the sub #? One answer: all the excess subs are promotional and non-paying. If they convert to paying then next quarter it is fine.
Oh my this is going up tomorrow 370.00 easy. You should of buy yesterday and today. Banks are going to open the wallets.
Open limit down tomorrow?
This is just the start of massive losses to come.
The train cannot be stopped now. Heading to $380 briefly and then break $400
I bought at $400. Will I ever make my money back?
"Years ago I heard friends and relatives talk about the shows they were watching on Netflix. They were so enthusiastic and more importantly they were hooked on the content of the shows. I considered Netflix as an investment and I bought. Never did I think in my wildest dreams they would be so successful. I added to my position along the way by buying on the dips. I has worked well and now Netflix is my third largest holding. FYI: I took awhile but, I'm now a subscriber."
we will be like Amazon tomorrow
Netflix always is my biggest holding. even when I sell it off. if I kept it all I could have been rich.
I am issuing aggressive buy from this level
Come green..
"NFLX will crush the shorts again next quarter. It is an unstoppable freight train that will continue to grow at least for another 50 years. Cash flows and debt are irrelevant. They can borrow unlimited amounts of money at very low interest rates.I predict $300 by April, $1000 by next year, abs probably $10,000 in a couple of years."
"Am I missing something here? Q4 EPS is 1.19 #$%$ estimated 1.35, how is this up? Can someone explain? Oh well, selloff and profits taking tomorrow."
Haven't heard any genius analyst upgrades lately. What happened?
I'm holding this stock till $1 or $1000.
signed up disney package and cancelled netflix. loving the content and quality
SWEET CHRISTMAS!!
finally breaking it
Here is a look at shorts tomorrow. LMAO
shorts take profits today before option expiration tomorrow. after shorts covering Nflx will tank Monday next week
LOL to amateur sellers
"And this is dropping why? Either it did well on its quarterly report or it didn't. Granted investors will take profits, but is there any rational reason beyond that for this to drop 5% in two days if the company is indeed doing well."
"Uh oh.... late day buying, insiders know something :)"
whoever miss the boat wait 2 more the price all drop ever more. than back up. whoever already in the boat... hold . will back to 380 ib a month.
"I’m tempted to take profits and buy more IQ, still very undervalued"
Here u go again. A minute ago was just 509.60. Now already 508. Nasdaq is up almost 300 points and this one can’t even go back to 530 before earnings. I can’t imagine if the market is down. Where will that be?
All these shorts bad mouthing NFLX is hilarious!! All they say is how this will be down big tomorrow or go to $500 lol. Don’t forget people this was at $545 a week and a half ago without earnings!!! This will hit all time high tomorrow no worries lmao!
Nice close...shorts better cover Monday....which will become a buy to close order and propel NFLX even higher. Longs will prevail Monday evening and Tuesday morning. $340.00 minimum after earnings release.
"red light, green light"
"Guy Adami, smartest person on Wall Street, predicted large run up in NFLXstock price."
Very good opportunity to buy now. Just added 2000 shares .
"Netflix is saying they save 30% by producing their own content. Or they acquire 30% more content when they produce their own. More content leads to faster subscriber growth. Expectations need to be raised, again."
"Oh boy, shorts are dazed and confused now, they missed subscribers numbers but stock is still up."
With all the price target increases to 650+ this'll be 600 tomorrow.
Chris Usiak =Selig= Garlou- same paid pumper
"remember today is a huge down day for tech, we would normally be up 3-4% if it wasn't for this correction"
so my $305 prediction turned out to be right. only it happened after hours....
I got in when stock was up $4 so you can thank me for the drop....happens to me every time!
"ok, this time $600 for real"
"If NFLX was not there, where would you invest your money? What is the next growth stock?"
"Up 14 of 16 trading days this year. Up $34, which is a 36.1% increase. Market cap has increased $30 billion in those 16 days. Really the only significant news in that time was that they beat on subs by just 1.93 million (they met on rev and EPS). That's a $15.5 million market cap increase for each new subscriber. Wow!!! This is just amazing."
Netflix Almost 5% down yet I’m still here? Look Disney will take 4 years to be profitable on their streaming if they can even reach 80 million subs. by then Netflix just added 400 films to its library and Netflix Netflix will beat earnings again.
400 @ closing???
in the absence of net neutrality I see 500 as a real possibility
"FB will take the market with it tomorrow. Bubble has peaked, only down from here. First slowly then a steep slide. Margin debt is all time high at $600B. Margin calls will doom this market once we have even 3-4% slide."
My wife said once it gets to 400 you can have some of this LOL
"Next quarter earning outlook $2.97,looks impressive."
"this ""crash"" was a blessing, I'm making a fortune today :D"
Is the company going bankrupt?
"Nflx new contents will spend a lot of cash. New contents will last for a month. Nflx needs to borrow more money for new contents. The cycles will continue until profits will not be enough to pay for interests of the loans. The current business model will not sustain over the long run. Nflx needs more products beside streaming movies. AMZN used to sell books only, and couldn't survive by selling books. AMZN has multi-products today"
Good read:https://seekingalpha.com/article/4142858-netflix-priced-beyond-perfection
Going below $570 today?
yes! I wait to 385 to short
good time to get on board?
340 coming
"CNBC talking heads like it. Whats not to like: subs up, revenue basically hits Q4 and Q1 targets, and costs plateauing this year. For a growth stock this is what matters. EPS lower because of investment costs, but thats not why you buy Netflix anyway, thats why you buy IBM. Plus they Its going higher."
NFLX isnt just a good stock its a great stock.Anything under 10%($360) is a strong buy.
"NFLX has competition coming from every angle Disney, HBO, Peacock, Hulu, Prime, Roku etc and a vaccince countdown everyday. You do the math."
Bidens plans and policies won't work here in the U.S. maybe in Venezuela they will work or China.
"Diseny+ won't be profitable until 2024, FACTS."
"They’re running out of analysts to try and manipulate the stock with price target increases, got to feed this thing news every day or it starts sinking. I’ll be long again after this short when I get a way better price."
To be holding up today is a good sign. Not expecting green to hold today in this market.
"I read a lot about apple here. Wil it be something like Amazon prime, a few shows as an extra or will it be a full on streaming service? I cant find a lot of tv shows online that they are going to make."
NFLX is one of the greatest stocks of all time.
How the heck this is up this much with earning miss
CNBC just reviewed the Ican and Ackman brawl. I remem ber Ican said he sold nflx year and half ago citing competition. Boiy he sold too early. All the shorts who took his selling as a sign to short were wiped out. LOL
Why the revenue miss when they said their subscribers are growing? Anybody?
Imagine how bad the selling will be if it loses that post earnings 344 level.
I wrote two weeks ego and predicted NFLX $280.00. It is time to buy it.
something is burning ....
Buy below $500.00
People you'll be sorry for selling
is it profit taking time yet?
I've sold all my $IPIX and bought$ $TSLA and $NFLX. These are the new paradigm stocks.
"I think anyone investing big on NFLX should balance out between NFLX and $DIS. I exit all my short on NFLX last week. Should have waiting until Thursday but I decided to exit completely and didn't stop.I do went long on $DIS on Friday (Also $FB).Here are reason why.1.> Disney Launch of ESPN stream will likely huge success. Lot of people waiting for that. This should known in 6 month.2.> This might help Netflix somewhat (Not whole lot of as most in USA at least already have netflix, With sharing, I think 80-90% penetrated which is incredible but also mean not much left to gain. ) and Most International market specially development country, Cable is still much cheaper than Streaming service.3.> ESPN pricing means Netflix lost pricing power. Now it will compared with ESPN. Also Most of local channel either easily available through Antenna or Free with Advertisement on most of TV Streaming box apps (Like ABC, NBC, FOX....)3.> As Disney launch full streaming service, Their offering will appealing and remove any remaining pricing power Netflix has. It might forced to lower price (Depend on how aggressive Disney is)"
"For Q1, NFLX is projecting 6.35M subscriber adds. LOL. That's what they had for last quarter too, and they came in at 8.3M. Let me guess here. I predict they come in at 8.3million for the quarter, and the stock explodes up 8% on the news."
Let the buying begin. Stop the with the 1% or 2% let’s rock n roll to 10% today. Let’s show the stock market who we are and have them talk about how NETFLIX is coming back strong. Green Green Green. I counting on everyone today. Prove me wrong.
Netflix is like a cult right now with the original content they are producing. They got me hook line and sinker as I’m addicted to some of their shows. I’d pay $30/month. Millions feel the same way can guarantee it. $2 raise?? Please.
"Don't be fooled by the game Netflix plays by ""beating"" international subscriber estimates. Nearly all of the upside to international subscriber adds is generated from low GDP per capita countries like India, Indonesia, Malaysia, etc. Per member per month pricing in these regions is a fraction of what NFLX charges in the US and Europe."
their Q3 Projection to add 5.00 millions. i really think they will beat it. they didnt say 5.15 or 5.05 like before. they picked 5 millions because they know they will beat it .

"Name one reason why Netflix will be the content king for the next 10 years ? Because CONTENT is king, Netflix will never be a long term play compared to the library Disney owns. It is like David and Goliath. Anyone can stream, but not everyone has content that will survive over the next decade. Name one iconic show or movie that Netflix owns that the “world” would pay for more than $10/month."

"At Thanksgiving everyone wants to say ""I sold my nflx at $420. Who would admit to missing that window?"
same pattern as yesterday....load up early.....should see 400 today
"Since the beginning of the year, NFLX 2019 EPS estimates have been tumbling from 4.06 to 3.42 while cash burn estimates has shot up to $3 billion/year. Large media companies with tons of content and much better capitalized have announced entering the streaming business and pulling their content from NFLX. Netflix's business model seems as shaky as it ever was, and loaded with debt with spiraling costs and interest rates makes it financial situation highly risky. Yet despite all this, the stock is up 42% YTD, trading at 120 P/E and $160 billion market cap! This is very much a disaster waiting to happen, just like the dotcom crash of the early 2000's."
 The 7 Best Stocks To Buy In March 2021  For details https://youtu.be/tpqEbEZywA4
Just watch the stock and watch the sell-off an hour from now Weekly target is $250
I can't believe its only down 4% as we speak. Absolutely INCREDIBLE!!!
let's hope for a brighter week next week and thereafter
"Buy this now it’s a discounted price, going back to 360s..."
Entire market was down today. Every day is not going to be green. Not worried at all. Full steam ahead to 500
"Amazing, with no news some how the market found 2.3% more value than Friday's close. That's approx. $3.2 more market cap. Who says it's a bubble?"
Covered 253.15. I’m taking a break from this casino. Bonds are looking nice to deposit 500k in.
are you guys ok today?
"I dont know how people can be so confidant that NFLX will give better guidance going forward, clearly there has been FOMO buying and the price has skyrocketed, then a price increase announcement 2 days before earnings report? this screams short if you ask me..."
Should Amazon just cancel and ban Netflix so they would have more customers on their own platform.
Impressive volume.
I'm going to watch bird box again now
NFLX will control the world financial system
200 dollar stock at best
"TSLA beats numbers, NFLX will do the same"
BLOATED. The market will correct. Expecting a decline of 20% or more.
earning next week... Up up up
"Upcoming split, solid day 700$ TP"
"Shorted 100 shares at 309, will hold through earnings,"
"Imagine what this thing would be doing if the Nasdaq hadn't been up 9 out of the last 11 days, or if the broader tech market sells off."
"Netflix price target raised to $750 from $660 at Pivotal ResearchPivotal Research analyst Jeffrey Wlodarczak raised the firm's price target on Netflix to $750 from $660 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares. The company last night reported a ""nicely better than expected"" Q4 subscriber and financial results, conservative Q1 subscriber guidance and better than expected Q1 financial forecast, Wlodarczak tells investors in a research note. Further, management officially confirmed they no longer need outside capital to fund their business, and raised their 2021 free cash flow forecast to flat from negative $1B, adds the analyst. He expects Netflix will continue to demonstrate pricing power ""as the service remains a relative entertainment value for best in class entertainment."""
Netflix has the lowest cost per subscriber and don’t take Ad money and can still spend 10 times what it’s closest competitor is spending. It’s like Usain Bolt gets a 1 Mile head start in a race and his competitors are saying they will catch up with him. No chance. Just noise when views are expressed about Apple or Disney catching them any time in the near future. Netflix is very sticky and addictive.
It was a good run but the bubble has finally popped!
Netflix valuation is elusive. For example: after reporting q4 2016 earnings the stock gapped up to 140. It was only 87 five months earlier. At PE 325 people were saying it was extremely overvalued. 140 looks very cheap now at PE 34 on this years est earnings and PE 22 on next years est earnings and the company still growing faster than ever. In a few years 350 will look very cheap.
"Dis is NOT good news for NFLX,Not good news at all!"
headed to $275.agreed?
Is a entry point people or still a little more down to go!!
Before market red after hours also red red red red
"Love early morning pumpers, Short after pump around 361"

"I don't know if its true. Someone in India, a higher up public official? seems to have said the 50 million subscribers is max for India, not 200 million.If so, NFLX seems likely to sell off. Another article seemed to point to Google's Youtube, Apple streaming, Amazon, and others having had time to become a force of resistance. Add in the high debt and it seems to me the odds are NFLX has seen its high for quite some time. jmhoI like to back out and look at longer time periods. Seems to have a message. The 4 year chart has $130 for support. If it goes to the 313-315 range again (I forgot the low), it will be the third time, I'm thinking it breaks through to the downside then. 385 to 316 or so was a nice shortdoesn't mean it is necessarily even going down from here or bouncing and then going down. I just think it is likely. ................To me, they are losing money. Someone pointed out that they went more in debtt for new content, then they made in revenue. That's scrary, but they do have the potential to bring in revenue for years on the content. It seems to me they jumped in very heavily into massive debt trying to fend off the competition, before the competition made them irrelevant.You know one serious issue is that Apple and Amazon and maybe others are willing to basically give away their streaming service just to get the subscribers to help them sell product in their stores. That's a touch one for NFLX to work against. They have been quite creative though. Maybe they will bring on the education thing or something else. They could start selling things, compete agains Amazon and Apple, fight fire with fire. It's possible they could come up with some ingenious ideas to keep growing.I think they won't or it will be too little to late. Could be wrong.I'm thinking it tanks to $130 and soon.just a hunch based on information I have explained here"
"NFLX is expanding rapidly in India, whose population is 1.2 billion."
Im afraid with the price this low somebody is going to buy us up-AAPLToo bad would love to see this double in the next 2 years

Please keep shorting, and I’ll keep buying more, been using Autodesk products for over 28 years now, they have their own issues, for sure, but they know where it’s going ;)"
NFLX oversold.....Guess what.....It will rebound because sentiment is negative....Contrarian typical scenario
Buy Truck Load now
Fake rumor on China tariffs from WSJ to pump the market ahead of horrific news from NFLX earnings release to provide a cushion for the market before the drop. That's how the game works now. Please trade accordingly.
No sense in watching it continue to bleed. I’ll give it one more day to stabilize. Portfolio poison right now.
"Pre-earnings options volume in Netflix is 1.9x normal with calls leading puts 9:5. Implied volatility suggests the market is anticipating a move near 9.5%, or $47.71, after results are released. Median move over the past eight quarters is 3.8%."
"NFLX maintainted Overweight rating on the shares with a $634 price target.Netflix's 2021 film slate ""marks a more pronounced shift toward quality,"" as its 70 films have increased star power from the likes of Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, Leonardo DiCaprio, Meryl Streep and Denzel Washington, KeyBanc analyst Justin Patterson tells investors in a research note. The analyst believe Netflix's scale has made direct-to-streaming a more compelling distribution option for actors and directors, particularly as COVID-19 weighs on global box office revenue. If Netflix can succeed in film, its lifetime subscriber value can increase due to improved retention and pricing power, predicts Patterson. The analyst keeps an Overweight rating on the shares with a $634 price target."
8% options implied. So plus or minus $30
Based on the trend. It should be $305-$306 by the end of the day! Thoughts?
"After rising 24% for the week it closes right on the high. Year over year subscriber growth remains unchanged at 25% after raising prices and investors continue to figure out what it means. For instance, Netflix could double it's subscription fees and settle for only 5% subscriber growth. In a year revenue would be 30B/yr, profit before tax would be 16B/yr and PE 7. Adjust for a normal PE of 20 and the stock would be 785. We could see the stock continue to spike next week."
$405 today after 3PM .
I wonder how many people are still holding from 400+.
Netflix to $4000 a share by 2022. Mark my words!
There are not many good movies/shows to watch on Netflix.
"lol,, i must have to say amazing market and super strong NFLX!!! I decided to gamble and bought some tomorrow expiring weekly calls early this morning at least that will make up heavy losses that i took on NFLX puts this week."
Lol to the shorts...

"Netflix can quickly propel much much higher from where we are... it just dawned on me that the price increases that will come will greatly improve profitability. Think about it, 1 dollar more a month and double its current profit of .79c a share... ie: close to 2 bucks a quarter, 8 bucks a year. Suddenly, this doesn't look pricey. Does Netflix have the pricing power? Reed is going to be pumping out the best content and believes that will command a higher price. I agree. Netflix is growing a huge moat, and it will continue to get bigger and bigger.... greatly fortifying its position. PS: That was only for 1 price hike... what if they pump out the content its users woud be willing to pay $2 extra, $3 extra... etc. Big money in Netflix."
What a destructive and meaningless drop today...
Will it be below 300 Tuesday
Glad to see I was correct to add 100 shares at the open. Already up over $20/share. That was too easy. Like Buffett says. Hehe. :))
Why the sudden decline? Any news out making the stock tumble?
Seems Like $FB $TWTR and streaming stocks went down in AH in sympathy with $NFLX

I love when the price ticks off the bottom of the chart. Volume is picking up down.
Finally finally finally Cramer has acknowledged what I have been pointing out for two years. The NFLX quagmire of content spending and customer retention is unsustainable and will lead to the ultimate demise of this company. It’s a mathematical certainty
Thumbs up if you love Netflix and Chill!!
This would be 375 had that POS Andrew Left not been given an open media forum to declare a short play.
"Just remember a couple of things. Netflix has hired the best people to make their own owned content.A lot of people feel that Netflix will be beholden to others content. Maybe their prices will go up, or maybe these content holders will see the audience (subscribers) increase so much they want their content on Netflix and the prices for these content holders and may not try to push their weight on Netflix and lose a large viewing public around the world. Just a thought. By the way, there are other companies that would love to have a Netflix of their own but it would cost billions to do it.Maybe Netflix could be a target if the price is right. If it happens then Disney is the one I'd bet on. They already have a great relationship with Netflix. To me that would be a marriage from heaven."
"Nflx was $333 yesterday before increase statement. Price increases are 13 to 18%. If you take 15% as an average on the previous day's close ($333 x 15%) appx $50, then one arrives at $383. If you don't take in news about subscriber growth and outlook which no one knows until earnings"
"An early Christmas gift in November, give thanks to that, cheers!!!"

These daily swings everyone is concerned about doesn't matter in the long run. This is a solid long term investment.
Do you think this will continue going into the week
Andrew Left wants this at 320.
Upgrades in the morning
350 by eow
Netflix profit now 1030% and counting. Starting to think this could be another Amazon.
They need to report 7.2M subscriber adds for Q2 and guide for 6.5M adds in Q3 for the rally to continue.
There is NO reason why NFLX traded higher on Friday It obvious that once it’s start falling it will go way down who is behind this
No question...the volatility in this equity is ENORMOUS
Is that after a 7 to 1 split?
"FAANGs are back baby ! AAPL, MSFT and AMZN earnings coming soon. Give me $600 NFLX today."
Soon down to $20.00.
"Nasdaq down, NFLX down, Nasdaq up, NFLX down. Sells every early morning pop. Sells into the close. See a pattern?"
Looks like we'll see 400+ in the after hours.
How do you Buy a short position. I have never shorted but it's time to learn this looks prime for it. Pretty sure this is going to tank...

"Growth stocks like $NFLX and $FB can't continue to have huge earnings beats and exceed these monumental expectations set out by ""the street"" because eventually they hit a wall. That's what we're seeing now...doesn't mean they're terrible companies, just means they're human after all. Stuff doesn't go up forever. Even $AMZN will hit that wall sooner or later"
Very reminiscent of FB dropping from $195 in Feb. down to $150 in March.
"Thanks longs, I appreciated all that short money I made this morning. Keep holding the bag for me."

NFLX down 10% since earnings pop. Gave up all gains YTD. The market is speaking loud and clear.
Why this slow bleeding again?
Short.
look out below!! here it goes tanking !!
Just about done here. What an absolute do noting.
"street money is coming back to NFLX as everyone realized it will go again to $400, If I had money I would buy it for sure."
buying all the shorts i can for the short term
Banjo has proven my point about the knowledge level of the longs on this stock. Somehow he thinks it makes sense to compare the valuation of this stock to a burrito joint.
up 15 or 20 today?

"Smart money is headed for long positions at NOK, earnings tomorrow morning then liftoff long term. They are manipulating stock price but, longs will prevail. Cheers."
Too much free stuff on the Net for NFLX to be able to increase prices and retain subs!Obumer hiring will cost them dearly too! It already is!Hilarious fact!
"Streaming is the future for a long time. The pie/market share will continue to expand and isn’t limited at all. Competitors welcome, won’t matter. Should be $400 as of today."

shorted today again at 385. NFLX is flying in the stratosphere and with the state of politics in the US today and the balloning national debt it appears certain that we will see a very large pullback in all stocks over the next year. Too many people are overly optomistic about the future of the country and NFLX. Everything is priced in to the umpt degree.
Deutsche Bank wants cheap shares before Monday. Says NFLX will miss subscriber growth. Nice try.
"Yeterday 7% jump was indication of way over excitement. I love it specially since Friday I have 800 short cover from my put excercise, leaving only 500. I was considering to cover rest but thought to do it around 290. Yesterday I had chance again but thought sell off is solid. No regret. I will slowly add more while keep selling out of money put for premium.with earning around I should able to bring my average price from $325 to $345 with all calls and puts profit. Premium into earning will be killing and will help make me money. I am fearless and will sell near money calls and puts to take maximum advantage.I shorted 315 call yesterday at close and also short 100 at 320 and 100 at 323 this morning. Plan to keep adding short for every $10 increase."
options are toast
They can't afford a 110 dollar total fee for netflix for a year...but they want you to know they know something about something trading for 1 share at 3X that price. if it wasnt so sad..be funny. Z

"Why No One Can Catch NetflixBY MarketWatch— 6:44 PM ET 08/26/2018Knocking Netflix ( NFLX Loading...Loading...) is easy.

But that assessment misses the key insight driving Netflix's ( NFLX Loading...Loading...) success, and why the stock is likely to climb again after last month's tumble.What Netflix ( NFLX Loading...Loading...) understands is that getting subscribers and, just as important, keeping them, is everything in the new media environment. The definition of success has shifted from how many eyeballs a channel can grab on a given night to how effectively a piece of content helps retain subscribers month after month. That insight has propelled Netflix ( NFLX Loading...Loading...) far ahead of Hulu and prompted the costly takeover battle between Comcast(CMCSA) and Walt Disney(DIS) for 21st Century Fox(FOXA) assets.It is also why Netflix ( NFLX Loading...Loading...) is sweeping up Hollywood talent. Earlier this month Netflix ( NFLX Loading...Loading...) wooed Kenya Barris, the creator of ""Black-ish,"" away from Disney, signing him to an exclusive, multiyear deal. Netflix ( NFLX Loading...Loading...) has also nabbed producers Ryan Murphyfrom 21st Century Fox (https://www.wsj.com/articles/netflix-signs-producer-ryan-murphy-to-multimillion-dollar- deal-1518588414) and Shonda Rhimesfrom Disney (https://www.wsj.com/articles/netflix-signs-scandal-creator-shonda-rhimes- away-from-abc-as-battle-for-talent-escalates-1502683261). It is expected to book $8 billion in expenses this year, though it will likely spend closer to $12 billion, according to Michael Morris, a media analyst at Guggenheim Securities. To some, those numbers seem excessive, but by spending to have the best content, Netflix ( NFLX Loading...Loading...) is locking in its subscribers and locking out its competitors.Netflix's ( NFLX Loading...Loading...) great advantage over its rivals is it doesn't need to show profits, as long as the subscriber numbers keep climbing. Profits can come at Netflix ( NFLX Loading...Loading...) when it has locked in enough subscribers who keep paying for content at higher prices.The major risk for Netflix ( NFLX Loading...Loading...) is that it somehow miscalculates what its subscribers want and doesn't draw in as many as expected. That happened last quarter (https://www.wsj.com/articles/netflix-reports-weaker-than-expected-number-of-new- subscribers-1531771717), when the stock tumbled 14%. But Netflix ( NFLX Loading...Loading...) has had many tumbles over the years, and strong growth has resumed. Thanks to its algorithm, Netflix ( NFLX Loading...Loading...) knows better than anyone else what kind of content it needs and when to launch it to keep subscribers happy.Disney's streaming services, set to launch next year, are the only possible threat to Netflix ( NFLX Loading...Loading...). But Netflix ( NFLX Loading...Loading...) has a giant lead; it will take Disney years to catch up, in part because lots of Disney content is still licensed to Netflix ( NFLX Loading...Loading...).Admittedly, the bar for Netflix ( NFLX Loading...Loading...) shares is higher now, and investors are nervous about whether it can keep growing at the same levels. But Netflix ( NFLX Loading...Loading...) has plenty of eyeballs still to sweep up--not only in international markets such as India and South America, but also at home, where cord-cutting continues apace.Netflix's ( NFLX Loading...Loading...) big lead may be its most important strength. It can keep bringing in talent, which will bring in new subscribers and keep existing ones happy. It will take a powerful competitor to break that cycle."
Short will burn big time - congratulations

"Consumer inflation is rising much slower than expected, so there is no good reason for the Fed to raise interest rates too quickly. JMHO"
Disney forecast 60 to 90 million subscribers by the end of 2024 or around 5 billion a year revenue. Netflix 2018 revenue was 16 billion up 35% from 2017. With 30% growth Netflix revenue will be over 100 billion a year compared to only 5 billion a year for Disney+ by the end of 2024. Not only is Disney+ content much different from most of Netflix content the service itself is tiny by comparison.
Short at $400. Looking for low 300s or 200s this afternoon.
its about original content and Netflix better keep pumping compelling must see stuff which will cost a lot of money

"It seems like people are pulling out of all tech except AMZN. At NFLX current price the a miss on earnings at 420 (a week ago), is already priced in. If they crush earnings beware."
That's it. I'm buying WMT for its streaming business
Tariffs are bullish. The removal of tariffs is bullish.
long term short on this stock. too much competition and the content is slipping.

Netflix losing lots of the big name shows at the end of the month. Will this reflect on their stock?
Why would NFLX raise $2 billion with Debt offering right now ???
Volume picking up bigly during last hour.
Reality check.
The old Netflix stock that I know usually ends the day like this up 8%. This one is just about half way..
Nice time to buy.
Poll. Will NFLX Break over high by weeks end?
"Up, Up n Away....."
How about split 1:5?
Someone is buying a lot. I see it going to $350.00. Could be tomorrow or Thursday. I’ve seen this pop 5 to 10% in 1 day. Love Netflix

"Everyone knows about Netflix. Netflix is the biggest streaming site in the world. The confidence and the trust for Netflix is really high. The stock value is about 80 times more than the revenue, we feel confident in that, price target higher than todays value.I wanna give you a tips. a streaming site, Mavshack, that has been active as long as the Netflix was active until 2011 had a stock value not even three times more then the revenue until a few days ago. In 2011 Netflix was worth as most 48 dollars, only a year later in 2012 it went down to $7, even though Netflix had 26 million subscribers, it was increasing in subscribers. Netflix was worth in its bottom only $7.00. Today 2020 Netflix is worth around $500. That means that Netflix increased its stock value with more than 7000% since its bottom in 2012. Mavshack have had a similar road until now as Netflix had its first 10 year on the market until 2012. Mavshack is increasing alot in the amount of subscribers. But the stock value have not shown its true value. The stock value has been very volatile and also has been on a down side for a long time. many investors been sceptical an pessimism have been around the stock for a while.But now its going to be a change, December 3rd 2020 it was announced that Mavshack will start Europe's largest shopping studio in collaboration with the NEP the world's leading technical production company for live productions and events. together with an EP marshak Salma has created the market's most elegant and cost effective VR studio. the market cap of Mavshack is only around 12 million American dollars. the stock is around its bottom. I can't see it getting much lower than it is now.. Now many feel like it's abiously that the stock is going to increase. With more good news about the streaming, live-sport coming up after realease of corona-restrictions and also the live shopping studio this stock can increase very rapidly and high in stock value. My own price target for this stock is around 400% for the upcoming year. I have been following this company for a long time and now I see a bright future for the company, its been an annoying ride until now. Please do your own anilyses and look this up. I feel very sure about that this stock is going to increase a lot upcoming years even though nothing in this world is totally sure. Maybe you would like to invest little in mavshack to get a big opportunity to get a big return out of it . I would still say Netflix is a more safe option but Mavshack is a great spice to it. Have a lot more potential to grow away higher in percentage. Have a pleasant day"
I’m looking for 391 today!
I'll take +$6.00 for the day in a heartbeat.
NFLX has to close above 330 as shorties fighting hard to keep below
Time to short...?
If you didn’t know this was coming then you are dense. They have been releasing great info for two weeks now. Not just great info but huge info!! New content coming out every week in 2021 and with huge movie stars!?!?! Come on... this will hit $575 tomorrow and $600 next week
Just went trough the upcomming Netflix shows trailers in the app. It's just incredible what a spectrum of programming they offer. Something for everybody. Insane...I'm proud to own shares of this compagny...
"Believe it or not: NFLX is the next internet-related $1000 stock after AMZN, GOOGL, BKNG..."
"how much longer until these pro censorship, unamerican freedom hating ""intellectual"" terrorists leave the country? $TWTR $FB $NFLX"
Will Netflix hit a new 52 week high today?
Even Jim Cramer is calling this a bubble now
Rising today like the White Walkers
Headed to $140 Billion Market Cap.
575 WILL COME
can we add the after-hour increase to my portfolio? Haha
"Haven’t seen this much premarket moving and shaking for a bit,"
When did NFlx split. I have been in my man cave for two months.
"I love bing watching netflix shows, not the type of person who'd watch superhero movies 2x. Weeknights for nerflix, Cinema on weekends. Bought netflix on Friday, hope my gut is right. I mean my household have Amazon, Netflix, and Hulu, but we ended up only watching Netflix 95%."
"Overall good earning but I am not impressed with Earning. While It's nice they beating subscriber number, it come at much higher cost. Balance sheet isn't in great shape.Here is thing I like.1.> Subscriber grow by another 7.2M while I like, everyone expected this.2.> revenue per Subscriber raise little bit.Thing I don't like1.> Marketing cost raising much faster nearly 71% year over year. Even higher than Q4 last year. 2.> Revenue per subscriber raise is lower when you compare history and recent price hike. Without hike it was going 1.5%-2% up as people subscriber higher quality plans. With Raise last Quarter with most not raised until near end of year, it's up only 4.8%.3.> Content spend is getting crazy. I think If they hit unexpected peak for subscriber, Those content cost very hard to pay for. I think level of sharing is unknown but if it's higher than 50%, I think it might even paused early next year. 4.> With Disney and Apple going to enter, Risk of subscriber growth stall is even higher."
"Thumbs up if you bought the dip, thumbs down if you held your puts."
"The pandemic brought in many more NFLX subscribers. After seeing the benefit of having the online steaming service, These subscribers will likely stay even after the pandemic. It’s like the people who started buying groceries online will likely continue to use it after the pandemic. The pandemic accelerate the shift to online and lowered the customer acquisition cost."
Yep! Smashed numbers
I’m picking up 5 shares long at the open Monday. Maybe 6.
300 next week
Whats tomorrow is this going up or down
Who’s buying at these prices ?
Come on move like $NFLX is moving now
In God we trust
WHERE IS THE BOTTOM?
"Getting there, slowly but surely."
NFLX will see $350 before $400
This. Cant. Be. Real.
I sold all my NFLX stock yesterday....going to drop much further
"Only the second time since July 18, 2016 that NFLX lost at least $5 on a day when the HIGH was at least $5 above the open June 27, 2018 (-9)"
Breaking down. Funds are selling.
Netflix is the Tesla of movies streaming
Take your profits. Will be RED by the close. Maybe RED within a couple hours.
"I'm not worried. I did not sell mine. They almost hit the numbers guys!! If you are a business owner and a investor of this company and the street is predicting a 50% growth year after year (subscriber, eps, net revenue) and the company almost gets almost 85-90 percent of that number , what the hell is wrong with that?? Please tell me. That's freaking awesome numbers!! Just the short guys wants a quick buck. Remember this stock is up 100% UP in one year (even after this hit) This is a long term stock. Not going anywhere. Best buying opportunity of the year!! Sticking in the long term!! Going long!!"
Shorts throwing everything in final tantrum?
"Earnings per share (EPS): $1.19 vs $1.39 expected, according to Refinitiv survey of analysts Revenue: $6.64 billion vs $6.626 billion expected, according to Refinitiv Global paid net subscriber additions: 8.5 million vs 6.47 million expected, according to StreetAccount"

Volume is massive on this run up. Shorts are in serious denial about the accumulation happening.
330 tomorrow! Higher and higher as positive word comes from US-China trade talks!
"sorry bulls but this is going under 300 by end of the monthbeat earnings by 0.06 but estimates were a very low bar. down 0.11 from last year despite subscriber growthmissed revenueinternational subscriber growth was light and their contribution to the bottom line was down by 0.80 /subscriber(very important given that is where all the new growth is)finally; most important, guidance for Q1 is way down 0.83 estimate to -> ~0.60 new guidance despite subscription fee increasescash burn also to increase slightly in 2019yeah...i don't see this continue to rise next few months"
People storming capitol now
I nailed this bubble
Moment of silence for the dude who bought at $380 yesterday morning.
I don't think NFLX goes higher until it comes down again. Folks probably missed the last ride and are finding it hard to buy here like me. I'm short until I get hurt a little or it trades down to a level I like. I'd buy at back at 308
NFLX reached a new All Time High at 366.64
Tech stocks got clubbed like a bunch of baby seals today.
Stock split in the horizon?
if you're thinking about opening a NFLX short position I urge you to just donate your money to charity instead
370$ - 385$ - 410$ in 2 weeks

Happy to say the profit on my investment in Netflix today has reached 1000% and it had only taken five years. I have never had an investment perform this well and I hold all the high beta stocks. I continue to be a believer in this generational stock and plan to hold indefinitely. GLTA in your investing life.
Will it be back to $400 today?
I bought more more more Geico told me to
Will Netflix beat the earnings??
If Netflix keeps the Obamas thank you liberals for letting me short this stock even more.
"Netflix sees a deceleration in new subscriber additions in the second quarter to 5 million. Wall Street had expected 6.09 million.Sales growth slowed for the fourth straight quarter.Operating profit margins fell 190 basis points from the prior year.The year-over-year growth trend in paid memberships also continues to be lower.At an outflow of $460 million in the quarter, Netflix burned cash at a faster rate than the year ago quarter ($287 million)."
"NFLXPE 1203,999,374 3,907,270 the last quater income is to the left, the one before to the right3999/3907 = 1.02351.0235**4 => 9.76% annual growththings are slowing if you used the last two quarters and annualize that to find the growthsome problems are1. the PE is 1202. the debt went up $5 billion and they got a half a billion in income for the year3. competition. Today Amazon released their free TV, check for yourselfThere is a lot more competition than Amazon. You can get a Fire Stick and get TV for $40 a month these days.Others are starting streaming. Many others and building content.4. manipulation. Can't prove it, but it didn't seem like they were buying, but it does seem like they are selling. You trade long enough, you can tellIt is up about 47% from the bottom 12 days ago and around 4% was today. Anyhow, they appear to have less than 10% growth from my calculations and a PE of 120. That might indicate that they are about 6 times too high. For debt to go up $4.5 billion in one year is a huge amount, especially in a rising interest rate environment and with competition coming on so hard. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;the GDP is around $31 trillion. That's money changing hands. Wmt used to have an income of 5% of their revenue, maybe it is less now. Point is, the most the country income is is likely $3 trillion.The interest on the national debt is $600 billion and likely to climb, even without the debt moving north. That's 20% of the national total income.That's a serious issue and the entire country is in denial.So, QE4 or QE5, whatever you might imagine is likely to be muted out of necessity. Costs need to be cut, which will likely put serious downside on the economy, like it or not. A recession is upon us. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;its up 43 percent in 11 daysand then they upgrade itwhy?To sell it to you.Did they say to buy at the bottom, before it went up 43%? No;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Book value $11.49Price $337, seems a bit extreme.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;someone here compared Disney to Netflix. It makes you realize that NFLX is grossly overpriced. NFLX's PE is almost 10 times as high. NFLX's debt to equity is more than 4 times that of Disney's. NFLX's current ratio 1.39. Disneys current ratio .94."
"They're trying to make it look reasonable, not an elevator drop."
Congratulations to all those who bought this stock at $150 because you have doubled your money!!
Keep Bringing on more people like Obama and Susan Rice into your fold. That should help subscription numbers
Its time to move over 260
"$300 million to service current debt$500 million to service debt starting 2019and more to come each year based on future negative cash flow.Starting 2020 will need to refinance $500 million of bonds rated B+ (2020-2026 so far)All while competing with Amazon, Hulu and Disney"
Anyone think I should short Netflix?
I added more Netflix.
what do you how far netflix go
"Who us the guy that posted ""My chart shows NFLX going to $331"" when NFLX was at mid $200. I used to think he is crazy, but now I miss him. Hi, if you see the message, can you tell what your chart shows now"
What a golden opportunity to buy it at a discount!
"$CSCO $WIMI $NFLX The current market value, I think, is undervalued"
Congrats to all the shareholders! This is a great start for the FAANG+M group.
having Susan Rice and Obama on Netflix will only encourage non-americans on the Democratic side to subscribe
"It is always hard to gauge the performance from the opening bell, I usually like to take the pulse around 10:00 - 10:30. At this point, we just need to see that there is still interest in this stock. Judging by what a lot of analysts and money managers have already said, it appears that the bulls may very well still out weigh the bears. We just have to hope they put their money where their mouth is. Maybe the whole tech sector will help buoy us up unless everyone is out to play right now with Amazon, Apple and the other FAANGs. After earnings season, maybe the chickens will come back home to roost. Good luck."
"A sea change going on in TV and movie industry right now. Netflix MC increase over the past 2 years, equal to 1/2 Disney MC which has remained flat, reflects this sea change."
"Get in now, this will be back at 400 in a few months I’m sure of it"
"If we break 52 week high on good volume, I see $600 by Friday. I will keep my stock but will cash out $550 calls, 400% profit, tomorrow."
What will be the $360 puts worth tomorrow?
"What is a ""non-current asset""? Every quarter, Netflix ""balances"" its balance-sheet by increasing its ""non-current assets."" Non-current assets stand at almost $13 billion. I understand why debt is evaluated based upon ""current"" and ""non-current"" status -- it makes sense to understand where one stands presently in business, compared to obligations going forward, but what is Netflix putting values on with these ""non-current assets""?"
This is the quickest 60k i made AH
MY retirement just become whole from loss in ENRON. Thanks NFLX
Fantastic day shorts made no progress 290 Tuesday and nothing they can do to stop it
I can’t decide what I want to buy after ER call? A new Tesla? Maybe a new house? Tough decision hmmmm

"BTIG Rich Greenfield repeated his Buy recommendation on Netflix (ticker: NFLX) shares and lifted his price target to $630 from “a very stale” $375.Greenfield notes that he picked up coverage of the company in October 2019, when there were growing fears about competition from Disney+, Apple TV+,AT&T ’s HBO Max, and Comcast ’s Peacock. “Netflix not only shrugged off competition, the Covid-19 pandemic has pulled forward industry change, breaking the theatrical business just as Netflix’s theatrical investments are starting to bear fruit,” he writes in a post on the Lightshed website.Greenfield offers a list of six reasons to own Netflix shares:Unprecedented industry scale: He thinks the company will reach over 300 million subscribers by 2023 and over 400 million in 2026. Greenfield thinks that will translate to over $70 billion in revenue by 2026, with Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) margins in the rante of 35% to 40%.Accelerating cord-cutting: Greenfield says that while the addition of new streaming services has not hurt Netflix, it has dinged the cable and satellite TV businesses. “Outside of sports, legacy media companies are essentially telling consumers that there is no reason to subscribe to multichannel television anymore,” he writes. “It’s over. Multichannel video subscriber declines rose from low-single digits in early 2019 to mid-single digits by late 2019 and will end 2020 in the high-single digits.”Covid has accelerated industry transformation: “With so little fresh content on TV and without sports for several months, consumer adoption of streaming hit warp speed. Once consumer behavior shifts, it is very hard to shift it back, especially when the “experience” of streaming TV is so far superior to linear live TV,” he writes.Studios unwilling to shift film economic models: Most major studios are unwilling to shift to a streaming-first model, he notes. And Greenfield finds that puzzling. He notes that Walt Disney (DIS) had a huge hit streaming Hamilton, but the pay-per-view model adopted for Mulan has been a “financial failure.” That miss, along with the weak reception for the theatrical release of the Christopher Nolan film Tenet, has major studios delaying major releases until summer 2021 or later, while shifting smaller budget films to streaming services. In contrast, he points out that Netflix has a hit in the newly released film Enola Holmes, and has 18 or more movies lined up for October release. Greenfield writes: “As consumers begin to appreciate the steady stream of high quality films on Netflix at no additional cost, it makes Hollywood’s [pay per view] ambitions even harder to achieve and it likely means that theatrical attendance will never rebound to prior levels whenever the pandemic is behind us. The longer Hollywood studios remain focused on the sequential release pattern for movies that starts with theatrical, the more it advantages Netflix.”Competition lacks global ambition: “When we look at the major streaming competition, we see limited interest in having global subscriber scale, let alone producing local content all around the world that can be utilized by all subscribers,” he writes. “Netflix’s global content scale increasingly feels like even larger strategic advantage than its domestic programming spending.”Feature animation at Disney scale: “Netflix has been investing aggressively in animation for the past couple of years, but the animated feature lead time means the output is just beginning ...The first Netflix animated feature film that feels Disney-like is Over the Moon, which will be released next month ...It remains far too early to judge Netflix’s animation strength, but in success it could meaningfully increase the value perception of a Netflix subscription and make it even harder for families to cancel their subscriptions.”"

"On DIS balance sheet find where they value ""content,"" then compare it with NFLX ""content."" DIS has prixar, disney children's movies, stat wars, marvel, lions gate?, etc. Whose ""content' looks overvalued? This ""content"" cost is amortized over time and makes up nflx's largest expense. So by slow walking the amortization you make the company look more profitable. What does nflx have in content that would total $9B in value?"

"Netflix price target raised to $550 from $420 at Barclays Netflix price target raised to $550 from $420 at Barclays 06:30 NFLX Barclays analyst Kannan Venkateshwar raised the firm's price target on Netflix to $550 from $420 and keeps an Overweight rating on the shares. While Q2 expectations have ""run up significantly ahead of already high guidance,"" the key driver is likely to be Q3 guidance where expectations are ""relatively subdued"" due to company commentary earlier in the year and a tough comp versus Stranger Things last year, Venkateshwar tells investors in a pre-earnings research note. Netflix is one of the few content services with a full content slate which, combined with sports uncertainty, could continue to be a tailwind, says the analyst."
"Very few real shares were sold. These were shorts who are trying to get people to sell AH and in the AM. It's going to go back up some tomorrow when people realize it's a bargain. I'm thinking 365 minimum. I'm buying more on a dip in the AM, if there is one."
Time to more buy
"told you so: market up, NFLX down; market down, NFLX also down;Classic laggard stock==strong sell=see ya at 150!"
"PE 200+ in an inflated stock market, nowhere to go but down"
I use closed caption all the time due to hearing loss years ago. But one thing I discovered with Netflix is the great foreign films available. Most are excellent productions. For many US subscribers that don't want to see a film with CC they're missing out!My point is that every foreign country that produces and has films on Netflix draws more subscriptions to Netflix from those countries.
"In a 6 month time frame, including the most recent bump, ROKU is up 183%, while this thing is up 16% and dropping; yet again!"

well this isn't good. .26% after GOOG's report? Doubting my trade now. Needs to finish green today or watch out.
$320. I’m telling ya
4 out of 5 shares owned by institutions. They won't be selling. Demand for shares today will far exceed supply. Add to that it has been stuck in channel for 6 months and seems like easy buy. 600 by end of week seems realistic.

Even if you can mine 1000 coins by the mainnet launch the next year, those coins can be worth a significant amount of money.In any way, you NEVER have to pay anything to anyone to mine pi, it's open for anyone to mine on their phone as BitCoin was in earlier days. Just download the Pi network app on your phone, use invitation code ""celebration26"" when registering (it's by invitation only), and make sure to use your legal name as when they assign the coins to your wallet in the future, they will verify that if you are the person who you said you are.As far as my progress, I have mined so far about 10k coins which unofficially are worth about $10k and possibly can be worth much more when the mainnet is officially launched and the pi starts trading on crypto exchanges officially."
Have I told you how much I love Netflix? I love love love it! Another 10 years of free subscription all thanks to Netflix Management - They are the best!
GBH raises Netflix price target to $500https://www.marketwatch.com/Story/gbh-raises-netflix-price-target-to-500-2018-06-19?&siteid=yhoof2&yptr=yahoo
"I told you folks a few weeks ago to sell NFLX when it was in the low 400's, high 300's, mid 300's and now low 300's. This stock got way ahead of itself. The current P/E ratio is still way too high by all means. I have never said that NFLX doesn't have a good product, it just that the market cap is twice as to what it should be. They have grown by given its product at prices that doesn't sustain their business bottom line. When they increase the price to become profitable the customer base will decrease. So they are in a very tough position. In addition, competition by Disney, Apple, Google and others will only intensified down the road. If you still have profits sell and run for the hills and if you have losses sell now to minimize further loses. We will if not already enter a period of a serious stock market correction as it's currently way over priced. I strongly recommend that you consult your CPA/CFA and ask him/her on holding stocks of companies with P/E of over 100 and see what they tell you."
"I cut my position in 1/2 but still long. I am not understanding why this keeps rocketing when it has negative cash flow, and, as I understand it, no plan to become cash-flow positive in the near future. What am I missing?"
what is happening!??!!?!? should I buy yet
I am unsubscribing now.
accumulate and cover is the news here today.
"Small portion in @$398.45, too boring if just watching"
Why the drop?????
"When companies like Bloom Energy with negative earnings and negative revenue growth has 4X the YTD stock price growth as Netflix, you know someone's cooking bubbles."

$433 tomarrow . yes
"It's clear now, it was Netflix that opted not to renew the Disney movie deal. At the MoffetMathanson media and communication conference Sarandos pointed to new, big budget titles as 1 area where it no longer makes sense for Netflix to spend a ton of money - because if you really want to catch the latest blockbuster, you probably already saw it in theaters.""We said, maybe we can put the billion dollars we'd put in an output deal into original films"" he said."
who would worry for a 1% drop after 15%+ gain yesterday.. haha
Hope NFLX working on the next big thing because it's original content in the US only appeals to a hairline sliver of the East and West coasts. Got to be a better way to spend 8 billion a year and they need to find it quick.
"Appointing Rice and signing the Obamas was for one reason - international subscriber growth. In order to realize its heady targets, NFLX must penetrate and be the top one or two streaming services in a large percentage of countries. IMO, Hastings apparently feels Trump damages American prestige, and in turn, NFLX prospects. So he is using the dynamic duo (Obama/Rice) to assuage the world and ensure NFLX can succeed in these countries.The fact that NFLX would be willing to take the risk of angering 1/2 of the USA in order to build int'l bridges for NFLX tells me that Hastings and co. are desperate for the subscriber growth that will only happen if the world embraces NFLX. This is not a good sign.So, my thoughts have evolved on this. Sure, Hastings is a Lib, has a vehicle for spreading the message, and can use the dynamic duo to do so. But he did this for business, not political reasons. I believe his reasoning is not sound, and demonstrates the challenges the company faces."
Moving back to $400? Why the big moves over the past few days?
This is exactly why I never could justify buying netflix. Anyone can copy what they are doing. I knew it was just a matter if time before the bottom fell out.
"lower eps than expected, but blowout subscriber additions at 8.51 million vs expected 6.06 million.. netflix strong "

Total manipulation of the stock Monday morning

Always a week behind in my options.. 360 call expired last week... Why....
"Had to add some at $350. NFLX along with Amazon and Nvidia some of my biggest winners because I held on. And in Apple too. Never fails, the lemmings run for the hills, the No-CASH Shorts get excited about making some pocket change and us LONGS hold or add and in the long run make the serious cash. Have a great weekend amigos. :))"
Best time to buy!!!
now we’re negative for the year 
calls up 500% right now!! Wow
This stock is a joke. Everyone knows that everyone uses someone else password. That is not a paying subscriber. I know i wouldnt pay for nflx.
Wonderful deal !!!!
With its Oscar nomination Netflix demonstrated their films can garner awards. This will in turn entice producers and directors to make movies for Netflix who crave recognition. This is big deal....what we are seeing folks is the beginning of Netflix taking over hollywood
It will never get back to 333.00......says the nut who never bought.
$500 this time next year
"why is the ""Top Reaction"" still ""Cold weather mean indoor movies."" Hahahah LMAO. Please, let's get new reactions.Netflix is hot right now. The upgrades are coming for a reason. They are very well positioned. If Netflix needed to raise cash, they are easily able to do so. These are smart people on the board, this is an investment, not a cash cow. I think they should raise our pricing 2-$3.00 per account. They have produced a product people love and yearn for more of. It makes sense, while still keeping the cost of subscriptions relatively low. Me personally, would rather pay a couple dollars more, than see ad pop-up's everywhere. Thoughts?"
Last chance to buy under 420!!!!
OMG OMG..maybe tomorrow NFLX will open at $130 because someone (1 guy) decided to short the stock. OMG he is a god.
"Yea right Joe blow , this is still a growth stock ."

"Yes, Friday's trading results make me a bit nervous but, like the elite companies out there, NFLX has a great track record of hitting and beating the quarterly estimates....the mark of a leader or, super athlete...."
"Copy: Last month, telecom giant AT&T said that Netflix's data traffic touched all-time highs on its network. The streaming giant also had to dial down its video quality in Europe and Canada to reduce bandwidth consumption in the face of rising demand as the pandemic keeps people at home. With limited entertainment options, Netflix is a pretty obvious choice for millions of people right now."
funny. all the people on this board who say they know what is going to happen. they dont't.

Looks like this is headed below $300 very soon. Absolutely no strength from what used to be the baddest stock in the market. I've been absolutely crushed every time I tried to short it. Does anyone dare now? Sure hard to imagine this ever going up again after the last few days.

"""These stocks have handily benefited from an economy flooded with subscription models, said Boris Schlossberg, managing director of foreign exchange strategy at BK Asset Management. The growing popularity of subscription services, particularly across media, has been key to these names’ success.“They are essentially trading on the fact that they are growing their subscriptions. It really doesn’t matter how profitable they are; it almost doesn’t even matter how much revenue they have. It’s the subscription growth that really attracts them, because then it makes them a candidate for M&A for, probably, old media,” he said Thursday on CNBC’s “Trading Nation.”“Until and unless their subscription growth rate slows down, I think it’s very dangerous to short them at this point. That’s the dynamic that’s really driving them, and that’s the dynamic that could push them even higher as we go from this point,” he added.https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/06/streaming-stocks-are-on-a-tear-and-its-not-just-netflix.html?__source=yahoo%7Cfinance%7Cheadline%7Cstory%7C&par=yahoo&yptr=yahoo"

I believe Netflix is a long term buy over time....but as a now Hulu customer as well...have to say it's pretty good too. Z
"Netflix burned a record $859 million in cash, or about 10 million per day in the third quarter. Everyone jump in as they lose more even more money LOL"
"Huge money was buying in right at the bell, look at it climb already!"
"I thought it was up pre-market, what kind of scam is this?"
Predictions for tomorrow?I'm thinking close of $395.00
Disney (DIS) will raise the monthly price of its Disney+ streaming service to $7.99 per month in March 2021.This price hike is a very good news for the leader Netflix...
"another Q, additional 524 m $ of negative free cash flow, around 2 B for the whole year and another 1.6 B raised in debt. Total debt is up from 3.3 to 6.5 B in one year. Looks good :) This company is burning cash fast. No wonder its debt has junk rating, but the shareholders seem to ignore it. All they look at is subscriber growth. It's like year 2000 is back."
"Netflix is value for money. They have so much valuable data, great AI and negotiating power."
"Be careful, it's going up."
Nflx is a well- managed company that has a single focus that is its expertise and dominance. Long term investors win with a company like this.
"Disney+ at $6.99 is a shocker price they hope no one will actually take, we don't know what it is for, restricted content, only 1 screen, low quality... what will the cost of higher memberships? will they have off-line access? ... I think it is a positive for NFLX Disney is saying ""we're cheap"" people don't equate that with quality..."
"If nflx beats, shouldn’t ubs and the reset of analysts that were mistaken be investigated?"
should get out now before they look again at the numbers and dump at the opening bell
What a frustrating period with this stock
When someone mentions NFLX competition.
NFLX chart kinda looks like head and shoulders forming.

It’s going to dump today

Nothing more than a casino. That's all the market is. $50 swings in this stock over the course of weeks and none of it having to do with the company itself.
Nothing that a strong slate of content can't fix. Netflix waiting for people to get back from vacation to put out it's best content. We could see a 10 million subscriber add Q before years end.
Subscriber growth missed for second quarter in a row........stock will come down tomorrow!!
apple beat stock up big in ah. should help NFLX rebound tomorrow along with Fed cut.
selling off again. man this may be bad. I'm stuck in $409. I hope this is not a sign of bad news. I said if they hit numbers this would just go back to about 420.
"Netflix is not only streaming service, it is international movie studio. So much content coming."
NFLX is the best FANGS stocks you can buy now: I switch bulls from bears!!!Target $380 in 12 months or so!

Looks like Conservatives Boycotts of Netflix because of the OBAMA original content is working. Not good to mix Politics with business. We saw that with Starbucks.
I have only 500 short. out of that there is 1 315 put and one 295 put I sold yesterday. So only 300 short. Considering to sell 290 put for those. I think market will recover at least once before enter into bear market trend line.Let me know your opinion. Show I sell 290 put for rest or not.
Here is a good reasonablee article regarding Raymond James belief on the sector. This is a real “expert” and knowledgeable person than the paid pumping by garolou on here. It’s dangerous to listen to paid pumpers. This article is not anti NFLX. It’s positive on NFLX.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-strong-subscriber-growth-hulu-221203720.html
The selling resumes.
Time to put option 
NFLX could give away free subs and burn cash for the next 10 years and this market would still reward it.
Holding from 312. Didn’t sell any.
"And then after the retest of $231 fails, it will break down utterly. False business model that will never generate a dime of free cash flow."
Lets go!https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/17/netflix-stock-has-a-history-of-big-rebounds.html
"NFLX totally subverts the fundamentals of valuation when it NEVER had positive FCF since the beginning of operations. Yet the stock is priced at the current lofty level that does NOT make any financial sense!!! This is the X generation investment mentality of HERD EFFECT which throw the OLD SCHOOL fundamental analysis out of window. Well, time will tell what will eventually evolve. Good luck!!!"
Man.... Up too early...
"Why, even in good price movement days, does NFLX volume remain 50-60% of average from just a few months ago? Looks like the investers are leaving this stock, signal of a top?"
CFRA (Standard and Poors) Give NFLX a high risk ratingOur risk assessment reflects intensifying competitionamong established and new entrants in the subscriptionsvideo on demand (SVOD) landscape; potential threatsfrom direct-to-consumer offerings by the major contentproviders; corporate governance concerns related to aclassified board of directors; and some regulatoryuncertainties related to the FCC's recent overturn of NetNeutrality regulations.
"Better luck / hope next week, tm is friday we all know what's going to happened. I just need 170 nflx. Get it together."
This is easily one of the most over valued stocks on the market right now.
Goldman Sachs always tell the truth. Very honest bank. Trust them!
Short Squeeze! My question is how did the two short squeeze happened last Friday and Monday ? We have to repeat that.
it is ready for a $10 rebound by the end of this week
"Earnings were better than expected. Additional subscriber numbers faltered when people got Spring fever and came out of hibernation after an extended long, long winter. Analysts #$%$ their pants. Selling ensued. Panic reigned high. Stock tanked. Incidentally, Netflix is still the same fortified leader in streaming content it was before the 2Q earnings report. Disney will take some time to properly compete---even then, humans are not quick to change habits"
"People on this board are greedy. NFLX is up 20% on the month. The gains are in. Despite what is likely to be a beat, stock is not ""rocketing"" to $500. May even go down. Increased subs does not address the longer term challenges of increasing competition and capital structure issues. Increased competition may not take subscribers away from NFLX, but it will make it harder to raise subscription prices, and it commits NFLX to massive debt funded content spending. A rise in interest rates will cut the current stock price in half. At these prices the downside risk is getting larger than the upside potential."
And the sudden sell off is because ...........?
Netflix competition just got stronger
time to buy some putsthis way too high already
Will be shorting soon with options NFLX because of T's new unlimited cell plan with free HBO MAX because customers that switch to T's new cell service can drop NFLX and save even more money. we will see how big a hit NFLX takes after 3 months and the next earnings report.
"Well, I'm ruined. Nothing I can do but hold my short now and pray for a miracle. Too much margin. The system is rigged."
"Raymond James' Justin Patterson upgraded the stock to strong buy from outperform. He also hiked his price target on Netflix to $450 per share from $435, implying a 38 percent surge from Thursday's close."

Trump's speech confirmed trade war with China/Europe/Canada/Mexico......markets will crash very soon folks. The trade war will accelerate the deflation of the current bubble (get out now if you have profits and thank me later).
Solid management and execution
"After seeing the combo of a bullish engulfing pattern along with a sharp move off the 50% retracement yesterday, today is no surprise at all. This stock has shown it can go up with frightening momentum. Shorts cover while you can."
Correction from earlier post..Not $375 after earnings $384!! #NFLX  Congrats to all longs that held through this massive dip and continued to add!!!
"Which is going to fly higher, Elon Musk's new rocket or Netflix?"
...should pop even more tomorrow(?)
I will get back to my old profits if this goes above 310. Hopefully that happens by Tuesday!
This is becoming the bubble to end all bubbles. It's like this is valued based on the best case scenario 10+ years from now. I wouldn't be shocked to see a 20%+ drop in a day on any significant bad news. As long as the news stays good I expect it will just keep going up forever based on momentum though. This is the kind of stock that could either be <$150 or >$500 a year from now. Way too scary to short or to buy and hold IMO.
"We are adding to our position,buying more GPK too."
Pretty sure original content is not so expensive compared to licensed content and a lot more engaging. If that's the case this rally should last a couple more quarters.
Added at least 1.5b in revs from us customers...and more from new subscribers. Bravo...all to the bottom line. Z
CIDM and DLPN are NETFLIX's up and coming competition so!!! I would jump on before they rocket to the size of this company both companies have been buying other businesses left and right
Those who bet against NFLX over last 10 years all failed! Period!

"When Netflix spends 100 million dollars for a movie, they are not really spending that much for the movie if you calculate how many countries it will be shown and how much each movie will attract additional customers to its service internationally. The per cost basis is divided to 190 countries they are in ends up being minuscule compare to say Disney or Amazon or Hulu spending the same amount as the market is only for Domestic consumption ( except for Amazon which is in 2 or 3 other countries )"

Bird Box release back on 2018 Dec 21st on Netflix streaming hit a all time high! Look at the charts matched with the release! 500+
"Apple is steaming to buy a giant media streaming company , NFXL is its first choice. which could happen before end of 2018. once news start flowing , you will see Netflix in $1000+ in couple of months."
"With all this talk about competition, i still don't see a meaningful threat to NFLX's content. I might be wrong."
"Overall Netflix is a good stock/company, it just got to far ahead of itself. Just needs time for a lower base to be established. P/E needs to become something more reasonable too. 240+ is way to high."
"Was -4 earlier today and now +6, nothing is going to stop this stock until we hit earnings and it will pop more. Got in at $160 last year still holding 3k shares"
What was the revenue amount this quarter compared to this expectations?
They increased $2 monthly on 80-100 million subs. Thats 2.4 billion off 3 billion yearly debt. Numbers still dont add up. They need minimum $5 price increase to offset cost/debt to start to have positive cash flow. But at that price they wont be competitive anymore and will need to spend more to retain customers. And at this point Its not a growth stock anymore and it shouldnt be trading at 100+ PE.
"Why Netflix could surprise to the upsideThere are number of reasons why Netflix could deliver better-than-expected results next Tuesday. The COVID-19 pandemic was a key driver of the surge in the first half of the year when it added 25.9 million subscribers. In October, when the company offered that guidance, the pandemic was much more controlled than it is today. In the U.S., daily new cases went from about 60,000 to more than 200,000 today, while new infections similarly spiked in Europe, prompting lockdowns in countries like France and the U.K., as well as incremental measures in parts of the U.S., like Southern California and New York.That rise in cases is likely to have driven similar growth in subscriptions the way the initial outbreak in the spring did.The company also said it would�raise prices�in the U.S. at the end of October from $12.99/month to $13.99/month on its most popular membership option. While that move was widely expected, it shows management's confidence in both its long-term growth trajectory and the performance in the fourth quarter. A 2019 price increase caused Netflix to report a slight decline in subscribers in the second quarter, but that was during a seasonally slow quarter. Also, it was a larger price hike, as prices went up by $2 then compared to just a $1 hike last year. It also proved to be a temporary speed bump as it returned to steady growth in the following quarter.Additionally, there's evidence of a streaming boom across the industry in the fourth quarter.�Disney�reported that it added 13 million subscribers in the two months leading up to the beginning of December, while streaming aggregator�Reelgood�noted ""massive growth across the board,"" though it did say Netflix's leading market share declined from 25% to 22% among Reelgood's 2 million users.Finally, Netflix rolled out another strong slate of content in Q4.�The Queen's Gambit�was a surprise hit globally, sparking a surge in chess interest around the world, and the company also seems to have scored victories with the first season of�Emily in Paris, which was already renewed for its second season, and Season 4 of�The Crown, one of its strongest franchises. Towards the end of the quarter on Dec. 25, the company also released the first season of�Bridgerton, Shonda Rhimes' first production for the service, which has also received critical acclaim.Data from Reelgood shows that five of the top 10 streaming movies in the fourth quarter were released on Netflix, including�The Haunting,�Hubie Halloween,�Mank,�The Trial of The Chicago 7, and#$%$ Elegy."
"Another funny thing about the NFLX shorts (we've already covered how whiny they are) is how born-yesterday they are. They don't seem to have the slightest idea that when AMZN was 300 then 400 then 600 their message board was full of posts about ""High PE"" this and ""no business model"" that and ""can't justify"" and ""bubble"" and...anyway, it's 1750 now. NFLX may or may not do the same- obviously it has so far- but you can tell that the shorts have no idea the different ways something can go. It's like they all started trading the day they shorted NFLX."
"Chart for this stock follows the chart of the S&P500 index, and that index always goes higher eventually"
Where my Shorts at ? New Closing High on NFLX all time high open Monday you are now all under water in your shorts cover quick I need 310 next month

Good entry point for nflx??
Pulling content from 155 million paying subscribers makes no business sense. Netflix replacing it with their own content does make business sense. The ER next week will show that.
Netflix needs to cut prices or lose subscribers to Disney. Either option is terrible for stock.

LOL. Bag holders. Such an obvious by the rumor sell the news event
"Investing in new content is not the same as investing in infrastructure. A long term asset like property plant and equipment that has a useful life of 30 years and will produce cash flow during that span of time is not the same as borrowing to finance content.

"Building a strong film and streaming video series library, room to grow."
How you feel today ? Still buying
NFLX is ripe to take off after today’s action. Load up on the call option for some real money.
Netflix to $400 today!!! $500 tomorrow! $600 Friday
$375-$390 in a week :)
Big up day tomorrow to 330-334. Then up all next week into earnings. Then great earnings and great guidance for 2019. What a great time the next 2 weeks will be. Happy Happy Joy Joy ! ! ! ! 400 in a month. then question will be: WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?
And keep in mind that ALMOST EVERY subscriber account is shared with 2 or even 4 families. This means that the netflix has an unknown but huge fanbase and they didn't even start with selling Official Stanger Things shirts and backpacks and games to all those people.

Terrible situation with tech. Looks like 2000 or 2008 all over. I see no bottom. Sorry. Wish I did because I hold tech.
Turned green but then quickly reversed course. This has no support at all. I can't believe this is the invincible NFLX. Literally the most powerful stock of the last 5 years. Dying right here. Even AH is down. Maybe this is truly the end and we head all the way down below $300? If this remains weak next week I'm out and will go short. Good luck to anyone trying to trade this. It had a furious rebound from the big drop Tuesday but then has turned around and just faded down 20+ points. Too much pain..
"Last 15 mins to get in, opens $390's tomorrow"
bought some puts for tomorrow. probably see a consolation before hitting new highs.
So wen this thing was trading around 250 less than a month ago there was no buyer now it’s almost $100 more and people are all over it because a so-called analyst said u should buy? Seriously? What has fundamentally changed about the company from a month ago?
"Patience...As quick as this went down 30 points, it will rebound to mid 300s"
This market is on its last leg. no more 7% after hour pops for any stock. AMZN crushed its net earnings and has barely recovered today's loss during after hours. Goes to show how over valued FAANG are.
Can anyone explain why this is down after hours
Better sell at the open!!! Will slide all day
This is absurd. Stock price was higher than this weeks prior to earnings.
"Netflix to $1,000!!!! Diamond hands!!! We will be rich!!!!"
Is it really that hard to figure out that NETFLIX is going back towards $600 this month? Come on people. Buy and make some money!!!
This price increase just confirms that this quarter was good. Why would nflx raise rates on a miss? To loose even more subscribers because lets face it there will be cheap ones who will btch about the $2 increase. I expect a 1 million sub loss due to increase but that will clear the path for future.
It needs to test the Monday's after hour low of $342
Watch for that pop tomorrow off the pull back today
"Bought 375 yesterday, 100 395@0.16 today - waiting for the big squeeze tomorrow !"

Anyone seen a buy out number floating around. Once we see people speculating on a premium price then something simmering.
"They’re investing 23B/yr in scaling up, and it’s growing 30% a year. No company on this planet is even thinking of competing with Netflix who is well on its way to becoming the only major global streaming company."
"This stock could go back to it's 52 week LOW and still have a ridiculous PE ratio. Why is NVDA constantly criticized for 30x forward earnings, and this thing is allowed to run wild? Unfortunately, I think a larger haircut is coming here. Eventually, being realistic has to win out."
"shorts having been saying this stock is a bubble or it will crash and burn since June 11, 2011 when I purchased at split adjusted price of 37.27 and I did not believe them then nor now."
Congrats!
"Cord cutting is now a global phenomenon, who doesn't want to save money anyway ?"
Sell now
"I told everyone to forget about AMZN, FB and the rest of the FAANGS and buy NFLX. Just look at this thing, it's like the Emerald City over here."
In the red tomorrow. Will be back below 500 shortly. Dream on holders. Cash in tomorrow. Your days are over. You will thank me for the advice!!!
On the shopping list today.
how many people think that report will be bad on Monday?
"Goldman Sachs argument to justify higher price makes no sense. Netflix will be paying more due to higher interest rates, they will be spending more as they add more debt to create their own content and as they pay more for licensing others' content and they will be losing Disney content. I don't see how this is a good proposition for higher valuation let alone justify yesterday's."
Guys take all you profits from Netflix again remember what happened to nvidia when GS did the same
No 370 today... If still green... I'm very thankful.
"Why red,,,,"
patience is key
Will go green before noontime and climb from there.
350 today?
I just signed up for Hulu because my family finds it better than NFLX. I think people may be underestimating the competition
"Not long or short..Thumbs up or thumbs down, who thinks the smart money sells into this rally?Closes above $245 manana?"
is it time to add more shares?
Will give back all gains from the past week. Watch and see. The institutions know when to get out.
My guess is Netflix beats handily but the stock sells off in spite of it
"Why Does Mark Cuban Own Netflix, Amazon Shares When He’s Worried About the Market?https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-does-mark-cuban-own-135238850.html"
Subscribers down because they have mostly international subs 72/130 million and the international community was busy with World Cup which is once every 4 years. Take a chill pill and buy it if it drops. I did.
Wow exciting
"Makes no sense, Q4 exceeded earnings by 25% and exceeded subscriber growth by more than 17%, stock price should be soaring. Somebody must be manipulating...."
If you look at the recent transaction with att and Hulu to value Netflix you get a market cap of 90-110 billion nearly 35% below their current price
"You can not believe it there are over 5000 people in Cebug school district, 10,000 students in Taiwan, 85,000 students in Shanghai, and 65,000 students in Vietnam want to subscribe Netflex after they hear Barack is signing up series!Barack is a giant figure! Think about it! So many Thai in Thailand also want to subscribe Netflex after they hear Barack series...Netflex CEO is correct. He needs to thank for Barack's signing up for Netflex series!"
I'm cancelling my NFLX sub to offset my short losses. I should be back to even by year 3020.
At this pace we will reach 400 today Mark these words
From what...590ish to 530ish. Quite a drop...
"I am currently long NFLX but there will be a cap, there is only so many people that live in this world with access to internet."
I'm saying 20 to 30 up today
NFLX will be up at least $20 tomorrow. We'll close between 388-395 !!
Crossed $370 today - we have resistance -- we hope:)The next time you see a $50.00 drop - remember BUY BUY and smile
"NFLX becoming cash flow positive is a major blow to the shorts’ thesis. This is despite coming competition from DIS. This tells me that not only will the two coexist without cutting each other’s throats, they will be like Coke and Pepsi. They target different markets so there is no bear case to be made here. $600 a share will be here soon."
Sell some Netflix and buy American Express going up today earnings
Monday after close NFLX will be up $50.
"Just bought more at 396, should be easy profit"
Buy buy buy
Hope we can keep this momentum
Every dollar drop means I lose 20k :(
We have pretty good support at $338.If it does pull back again it's only a buy opportunity. We should be hitting $380s soon.

"Huge amounts of money lost today to big buyers. Billions on all types on companies. Create panic for longs to sell and short to step in. Then buy back so short get scared and buy back with a loss. To green again, people buying. Now shorting again. Hahaha. And many people keep going for it. If you have a stock of a good company. Stick to it for a year at least."
ALERT NFLX is consolidating and chart pointing MM are selling in strengthBeware first support at 382 then 350 and final if severe bear market then 263...Also NASDAQ is in process of making double top and market will correct never before seen fury of correction.
Sell now and take profits. I did. Great day!!!!!!!!!!!
Obama and Susan Rice frantically working the phones. Need upgrades ASAP. Funds drop more money into the stock.
"it’s hard to believe that even after that massive breakout, we’re only up 6% for 2021"
Good luck to you Netflix investors today. I do not own any Netflix. But I am smart enough to know bad numbers tonight could send us tumbling.
Everyone stops in to kick a stock when it takes a hit. Netflix will likely gain half of this loss back tomorrow. Possibly be back to $400 by Friday.
Today after fed decision Dow will either go up 500 points or go down 500 points
"NFLX 80% institutional ownership, NFLX is going back up"

next stop $550...jus sayin
I was long . but this rises too much .gonna short it at 568
"How can Netflix stay up at least 180 points too high? Read the details, Hbo all series are quality, this is a game changer, they are trend setters!In year one, there will be 31 original series on HBO Max, growing to 50 series in 2021 (in addition to originals for legacy HBO), according to Kevin Reilly, chief content officer, HBO Max and president, TBS, TNT, and truTV. Underscoring HBO Max’s focus on “content that matters to viewers,” Reilly said the top 100 titles on streaming services drive half the total usage. Translation: HBO Max is focused on quality, not raw tonnage of content.As previously announced, HBO Max is getting its hands on the entire runs of “Friends,”“The Big Bang Theory,” “The West Wing” and “Pretty Little Liars,” among others; the entire Studio Ghibli film catalog; the full library of “Sesame Street” as well as the next five seasons; and CW dramas produced by Warner Bros. starting with the fall 2019 season (30 days prior to the TV premiere of the next seasons of the shows).HBO Max will have 1,800 movies at launch. In the first year, the film selection will include all the films in “The Matrix,” “The Hobbit” and “The Lord of the Rings” franchises as well as all titles in the last 10 years from DC Entertainment, including every Superman and Batman movie ever made. Recently released hit “Joker” starring Joaquin Phoenix will be available at launch.After the initial U.S. launch, AT&T will take HBO Max international — in 2021, it plans to debut localized versions of HBO Max in Latin America and Europe, according to Stankey.AT&T told investors Monday that it expects to spend $1.5 billion to $2 billion on HBO Max next year and invest a billion in each of the following two years, before hitting profitability in 2025.In 2021, WarnerMedia expects HBO Max to generate $1 billion in incremental revenue from the U.S. — over and above HBO — stepping up by a billion each year through 2025 to $5 billion. Those forecasts include ad revenue, expected to come in starting in 2021.It’s unclear how the so-called streaming wars will shake out, but Netflix investors in particular have been unnerved at the prospect of competition with content powerhouses like WarnerMedia, Disney and NBCUniversal. Some analysts believe it’s not a zero-sum game, with room for several big streamers to gain traction — likely at the expense of pay television."
"After hours: KeyBanc initiated Netflix with an Overweight rating and $590 Target KeyBanc analyst Justin Patterson initiated coverage of Netflix with an Overweight rating and $590 price target. The analyst sees the company as the winner in the over-the-top video and believes that it is positioned for long-term free cash flow growth. Patterson further cites the pricing power of Netflix, with cord-cutting having accelerated and consumer adoption increasing during the pandemic"

"The demand for TV, online games, e-commerce, social networks, health TV, and online education increased significantly during the quarantine. Only in the first quarter, $Netflix increased 16m new users in the US -- about double the number in the previous quarter. Italians also increased their time spent on Facebook apps by 70 percent. After 2020, there will be significant growth in the upstream video data stream from the Internet of Things. AR holographic services are expected to generate massive demand between 2020 and 2025."
Maybe NFLX should move even further left. It's a popular biz model today to alienate half your potential customer base.
NFLX is undervalued still ... squeeze!
Keep your arms and legs inside until the ride comes to a complete stop......
"The vaccine is the light at the end of the tunnel for most companies, but an oncoming train for NFLX. I don’t know where the stock price will go in the next couple months, but longer term it is headed down. NFLX buyers/holders just naively celebrating with the rest of market...for now."

"MUST READ:::: Food for thought on NFLX (and all other high flyers)....each time price targets got lifted (on nflx) when it was at all time highs, it dropped over 20% every time, BEFORE going higher. Take early Jan 2018, target went to 350 (price was at 287), then dumped to 236. Then again in March, target was 400 (price was at 334), then dumped to 271. Now we are at 400 all time high and 500 is new target. Price will dump at least 10% BEFORE going higher...350-360 range will hit again soon. Don't read the hype on this stock...its being swing traded by big-cap on and off wall street. So, NFLX will dump soon BEFORE GOING MUCH HIGHER then 400...watch an learn....we swing traders make way more in long-run. We lock in profits on each run. Mostly we go LONG till new highs break, take profits, then capitalize on pullbacks with shorts... then hop right back in LONG at lower levels. PLUS, we dont risk losing large portions of our gains if something really bad happens. Much safer to swing trade...just need a good coach and trading group."

Avoid Netflix 2021 is what all Brokers are saying. Time to Short Big on Netflix and send Obama to a lower tax bracket.

"All I hear is about content,..well with the new players in the bidding pool content cost may go up...Apple and Disney have the cash to buy the best programs out there...leaving Netflix the crumbs..unless they go deeper in debt...IMO"
"When is Disney’s content being pulled in entirety from NFLX? I’m up 80% on NFLX, but certainly watching Disney’s moves..."
Sorry but with Disney and earning report projected poor by Goldman sach I just sold all my share before or in case it drop.

i need insight. should i hold i got in at 415? or cut my losses early? i feep it will be 500s by end of year.
NFLX will rise to $ 346.00 at the opening bell this morning!
Netflix stock reacts as if its earnings has come out in the previous day everyday
Lots of immature folks on here. You can make money either way on this one depending on how good you trade. I'm out. Good luck to everyone.
Netflix may be the most overvalued big cap stock of all time.
This things is obviously going to test the post earnings 344 low.
"This is the start of Netflix. Netflix will become so cash flow positive and can fund almost any new content. That is the key. Do not forget the buybacks.Whoever is selling, thank you. Whoever is buying, good job."
NFLX short thought DIS's subscriber numbers meant the end of NFLX. Today is proving to be a rude awakening. Love the smell of freshly squeezed shorts. Delicious.
"Wall Street analysts upgrade NFLX to:$300, ....NFLX looks like bringing all net stocks up today: AMZN, BABA, PCLn,..."
"Forgot to mention, cancelled my Netflix today and millions more will follow........."
"Not just get out.... They sell it and buy FB,Amazon,AMd... Before ER. And back here again. Cause they know.. The price won't up too high here"

This always sells off on earnings

"with Apple, Disney, and others getting into the streaming game, I fear Netflix's best days are behind them"
If you want to trade it. Always notice after a decent underperform day vs. Nasdaq...this always trails lowers for the next 4-5 days.

I'm looking for 545-560 strike ahead of earnings. not a huge move 5-7% by the 19th.
That was great! I managed to turn a profit and Im happy with that.Good luck everyone.i'm out of here.
It is a 600$ stock!
i think this stock will go beyond $500.00
Any new info as to why NFLX goes down day after day?
Looks like another split to me!!!
NFLX is gonna be green tomorrow when it's all said and done...just watch!
Waiting for Disney streaming service to cancel Netflix
just remember people netflix can swing 40 points easily in one day it can be down 40. next day up 40. easy profits if you buy now.
If you’re not buying NFLX at this price then go get a job at McDonalds!
anyone who get stocks including shorts understand support we see it and I'm sure you do to hahaha 15 min to cc have fun
stop at lose at 600 $ . good luck to everyone. its just the game
Streaming is a bubble $roku $nflx $viac not just ev $tsla
It's only down 11% from the $400 it was before the ER. That's in a fairly robust market. Tells me it has a lot farther to fall if the market weakens at all. Today's tech spike couldn't save it from falling some more. Look for $320 soon.
Surprise! Surprise!
"I own 100 AMZN and it's almost all my money but, I took $10,000 out of my checking account and bought NFLX yesterday. Wish me lluck!!!!"
3 minutes to AH trading....thinking it will pullback then but i could be wrong.....
Lots of positive news articles out over the weekend 420 here we come
When the crash begins tomorrow this will be under $200 by Christmas.
one question.... where were these experts when it was jumping up 70%?.... experts have hind sight.... no foresight...
I placed $2500 on PUTS and $2500 on $600CALLS. Best way to play earnings. 1000% profit here I come.
Nice comeback from the 3.58% drop. 2nd best day this year. It was up 26.37 (9.72%) on Jan. 4Best close since 362.44 on July 17 of last yearNow up 9.93 for the week and 26.03 for the month.

"what do you think a reasonable PE will be when Netflix reaches saturation. it's not a matter of IF, but when it reaches saturation when sub and revenue growth reaches 10-15% annually. I think at that time, PE will be closer to 20 (Disney is trading at a PE of 15 right now). If EPS is $9 at that time, NFLX won't be worth more than $200. and that's at saturation in a out 5 years."

I think Netflix has given my family the best deal ever. We are never going to cancel it and still use it all the time.
fly NFLX fly
NFLX is among the best games in town right now!
Getting bought by Apple?
This is probably going over 600. Very strong earning reaction. Usually this stock will find any reason to fade and sell off after earnings pop.
"all money in calls, to the moon we fly today boys $AAPL $WIMI $NFLX"
"Citi (Mark May)International subscriber additions were “meaningfully above” expectations, while the weaker-than-expected revenue in the quarter “appears to largely be FX driven.”May lifted his target on the company to $420 and affirmed his buy rating. In October, when May upgraded the stock to buy, he had a $375 target on Netflix.Nomura Instinet (Mark Kelley)“The quarter was fairly clean; management’s language on cash burn was consistent with prior commentary, indicating that investment in content is still top of mind.”There was “broad-based geographic strength” in net subscriber additions, along with a “solid 4Q18 content slate.”Lifts price target to $320 from $300, and boosts Ebitda forecasts for both 2019 and 2020. Keeps neutral rating.Goldman Sachs (Heath Terry)“Netflix has outperformed the best-fit-line in each of the last four quarters suggesting that the company is getting incremental leverage on its content investments.”Because subscriber additions continue to exceed expectations and the company is approaching “an inflection point in cash profitability, we believe shares of NFLX will continue to significantly outperform.”Raises price target to $450 from $420 “to reflect faster subscriber growth, particularly in international markets.” The firm maintained its buy rating and kept Netflix on its conviction list.RBC Capital Markets (Mark Mahaney)Global paid subscriber growth continues to accelerate, and the “pulling of pricing lever should be successful,” which “means accelerating revenue growth & operating margin expansion.”Raises price target to $480 from $450, not far below the Street-high target of $500. Also raises 2019 and 2020 revenue expectations."
"Look at the Balance Sheet. The unamortized content costs, massive debt and recurring negative cashflow. Plus the competition has just started. Really shocked on the stock price but this will drastically fall. Might not be today or tomorrow but fundamentals are terrible and it's a matter of time."
"the stock is a bargain at this level, thanks me in a month after academy awards"
Why the big drop?
AH isn't helping....
I would not buy anything until things come back in under 50 or 100 day. The market is going to sell off through earnings season. Last Q was peak for most.
"Who sold at $200, $195, $190?"
what's the price target for today 420?
"so with a P/E of 106, it will take only 106 years for the company to earn it's current market cap? is that a good deal? BTW what dividend is Netflix paying its shareholder/owners?What is Netflix expected capex requirements to continue producing original content vs expected revenue and cash in the bank?Questions to ponder on a day of ""irrational exuberance."""

"Don’t foresee any significant movement tomorrow due to monthly and weekly options expiring. However, it should gain some positive traction as we approach earnings. Might test $400 in a couple of weeks prior to earnings."

"IMDb, the film and TV website owned by Amazon, is launching a free streaming video channel that will be available in the U.S. on its website and Amazon Fire TV devices, the company announced Thursday. Unlike streaming services like Netflix and Prime Video, IMDb Freedive does not require a subscription, and is instead supported by ads, according to a press release.The streaming space is getting increasingly crowded as even legacy media players like Disney have announced plans to create their own services. Apple, AT&T and others are also planning to launch streaming video services this year. But IMDb's ad-based model could make it attractive to consumers"
Shorts burning
Everybody should stop talking. No one knows what's going on until the new guys sort themselves out. A lot of mess was left everywhere.
Mark my words Netflix will be $450 by end of this year.
"Heard Laura from Needham , not impressed about her logic on downgrade, too many if this happens and that takes place and then subs are lost to Disney and they come back and so on.. It is almost like everyone is lining up to cancel nflx subscription, all things have to go against Nflx but all goes well for Disney, too many speculative arguments to sustain the logic."

"i bought in before september earnings last year, and yesterday just barely pushed me green "
Great week. I loaded up on NFLX and CGC monday. Runs are not over. CGC might putts around before popping again but NFLX clearly going to breakout big into earnings. Not sure about earnings itself but will run up to next week.
netflix turn tomorrow to smash all time highs
GS 500 price target. Long gap up.

"Wow, it broke just through the 345 pretty easy. I did not expect that. Was expecting much more fluctuation."
So Disney + has 85+ M subscribers in year and has several new titles coming out this year. Netflix seems outmatched added 30M in the same year with a 6 year head start. They could catch Netflix next year in total subscribers.
NFLX numbers will be off the page at earnings! This will run above $400 any day now and may get to $500 right after earnings! One analyst already has a $487 price target for that reason!!
No Obama!!!!!!
if they can run up tesla and bitcoin are they going to run up netflix?
Back to the 400s on its way to 500

may up to 430
netflix will always come back. regardless of what happens in er.
"IMO NFLX would not be increasing prices if they are losing Subs. This increase is going to add ~$1B domestically and another ~$1B from international Subs. Their model is working and Sub must be increasing, otherwise they would not be raising prices, esp in light of competition from DIS/T. I think 4Q earnings are going to be good.Good luck to all."
To 380$ Are you ready guys?
New movie Staring the Kap and directed by Susan Rice and the Obamas....
Are we going to get a 3pm jam session today like yesterday?
There is a reason why 85 percent of the institutional investors invest in Netflix
Below 520 by Friday
Markets will be green
In for $305.82 . Come on after hour 
Hulu partnered with Sprint. Sprint has free commercial saturated Hulu for free with plan !!!!! There's your big bump in subs !!!!!
Feels more likely to me that it'll snap back to it's 50-day than for it to continue lower. Also I think the S&P and Nasdaq look poised from a chart perspective to continue up this week. NFLX is due for a rally back to that 50-day.
Nothing to watch at Netflix. I like youtube.
500 after earning?
"Highest number of open interest contracts expiring today (4,4509 contracts) strike of 550 so heads up it will keep drooping next 30min to hour and might see a drastic drop"
The $nflx shares are like a spring the more you push it down the more it will pop. I am 100% bullish about this security good for all investors who loaded this in discount.
Celebration Tonight...
if it closes over 380. you better ADD
Citigroup raised PT from $450 to $580
Is there any upside left?

Twelve dollars off the high for today. Geez!
Will you agree AAPL offer $345 if having one??
despite losing 30% NFLX still a big bubble...
I’m almost afraid to watch
anyone know what is really going on with Nflx lately?
In my opinion we will go up easily to 450-480 to EOW
450 next stop
"I like Netflix and Roku and $WIMI, they always do well, more and more people are using their products."
All aboard next stop 350
"I don't know...NFLX jumped 11% the next day after earnings for the quarter before this one where it jumped almost 6%. It's a great company but, it can't keep pulling miracles out of its #$%$, I think I might sell 100 of my 200 shares which I have owned for almost 3 years and be very content with that even if it somehow keeps appreciating."
"If you are looking to buy, wait for it to find a base. Stocks don’t typically trade in V formations but rather Ws. Wait for it to hit a double bottom while it bases for several weeks. Trust me on this, don’t try to catch a falling knife"
I like SNAP at 13 better then NFLX right here.
This is one of biggest market caps in the world that barely makes EPS. This stock always amazes
SHORTED 5000 SHARES I THINK IT WILL GO DOWN WHEN REPORT EARNING TODAY.. I HOPE I M RIGHT..ANYONE ELSE SHORTING.
SO MANY ANALYSTS UPGRADES out this morning over $500 
Begged you to buy this before ER. Said they would beat on subs and stock would rally 5%. This is predictable. Cant understand why everyone didn't do.
Watch she is dropping!!
"when Netflx says they spent billion in marketing, they pay analysts and websites to write positive things about stock,it may work to certain extent. It worked for bitcoin."
"News of record number of subscriber adds after raising prices keeps on giving, and why not, nobody has ever done it."
Such irresponsible upgrades they gave on this beloved stock.
Amazing amazing amazing
$550 calls look beautiful. Told you to buy them cheap this morning.
Johnny goes on MUTE
"hunch:sells offtime to get in is now (sell or short)why, because the price is apt to go to $130 per share (see a long term chart)and so, a lot of money is to be made in the early goingbut, $420 was the top, but $130 is about half where it is, so its still easy moneyOnce it gets to $200 it may pop highercould pop here, thoughbasis:5.2 times the PE of Disney$276/5.2 = $53 per sharebased on that aloneone might expect some selling at some point, PE normalizationand then the cost of content is up 30% in one yearthen the competition is everywhereZacks noted the low barrier to getting into the streaming business and a $165 price target"
We'll get a 4-10% pop very soon. It's been trying to break to the upside last couple sessions only to break down midday. Maybe Tesla and AAPL beating will bring forth such a pop in the coming days.
i do like netflix but it's too expensive...fair value is at 280
Is NFLX down because DIS up and is presumably is taking market share from NFLX.
net profit up 10% in the quarter thank you Microsoft
"1. Let's pretend NFLX triumphs over Amazon, Disney, Apple, and Google in streaming and doubles its revenue to $23B.2. Let's pretend they do that without spending a single dollar more in cash flow than 2018.3. $12B in incremental cash flow to the projected -$3.5B FCF burn in 2018 is $8.5B4. $8.5B versus current Enterprise Value of $137B is just a 6.25% ROIC yield after achieving unprecedented success.5. That being said, would you like to buy $NFLX at $280?"
Why is Yahoo pushing this dam Walmart story?
i am never getting rid of netflix
"Thought I could bank on today being a high flyer, not sure what is causing this. Supposed to be added to S&P 100 today, where is all the ETFs??"
I don't have gut to buy NFLX at $391. I may get in at $325. My experience tells me loss/win ratio is 80/20 at current price. I will wait for the bubble bursting this week. At the current price I would rather buy Fb with much better valuation.
just waiting for earnings
The future is more streaming.
I’m Crying so much I wish I had a lot of money to buy more why why why. Looking good 425.00 by end week
Funny thing about next bear market / correction / recession for $NFLX $AAPL $FB $GOOG $AMZN $NVDA $TSLA etc ... is that we won’t even see it coming.
It's all in the GUIDANCE.
"Sorry shorts and the naysayers, this is what it is"
"Umm, okay, so somebody please explain the logic here....NFLX has a P/E over 100, which is in of itself is ridiculous, but with more and more competition, there's no way this company can sustain such multiples and such nosebleed valutions. I get that its a high Beta stock and will make massive swings (in either direction), but it seems like all this is is a momentum play right now. Sure, overseas has some growth, but not enough to warrant this price and this valuation. I want to short it around here, but man, who the heck knows. One little earnings hiccup and this thing tanks hard. Hmmmm, maybe an options trade is better."
Ha I called this last night when nflx was down 6 bucks.I even called the shrugged off article the day before it was printed..Party  is NOT Over YetParty  is NOT Over Yet16 hours ago$NFLX conversationThey are writing  the Old “Investors shrugged  off the Netflix warning  and it went higher haha Reply31

Stock in a clear downtrend, competition coming hot and heavy with deep pockets and oodles of content-and somehow this stock hovers with no buying just above an air pocket down.They are slowly distributing this stock and trading weekly to weekly Options to augment the return. your only friend is the time still left until the air goes out and they are gone and so are the option Boys."

Once profit takers gone...this Will skyroket to 350$ tomorrow by END of the Day. Chek the previous charts...after earnings people take profit..but the 3 following Days it only goes Up. History Will repeat itself and to 375$we go
"come on baby, you can do it"
Finally this morning hopefully we shed these barnacles that have weighed us down. There is a tone of desperation amongst some here today.
Never
"Mark Tepper has said stock will rise 30-40% from here. When an expert like that says so, that's all I need. I'm going all in on this stock. It's the only one I need for retirement."
"WHY WOULD YOU SHORT NFLX ahead of earnings with massive subscribers? PLUS, FALL IS JUST around the corner, and COVID 19 expected to be even worse! $670 price target might look more like $750. "
"Quit trying to call the top shorties, you’ll never do it. Get on the winning side of this stock while you still can!"
My Bloomberg terminal just gave me the blue line alert if you know what I mean.... huge subscription increase
"so let me get this right, a $2 price hike is too much for everyone to bear, lol . This service is the bargain of the year. It is the cost of a sandwich. All these competitors are so far behind and people love many of the shows on Netflix. This is only their 4th hike in their history. Eventually this had to happen, how else do you make money? Look what Amazon prime has done, way more hikes, way more expensive and nobody blinked yet. This model like COST AMZN, subscription is what's happeneing"
Yesterday's sugar high wearing off. As expected.

"She helped [and I mean directed] spy (without a warrant) on a U.S. citizen and then wrote a CYA memo while Trump was getting inaugurated. She will be lucky if she is not one of the people indicted in the FISA court abuse scandal (it was not just the FBI) that is unraveling. The Benghazi stuff is old hat compared to her toxicity on the FISA scandal. Netflix, drop her now. The worst parts of the scandal will be where she is committing felonies by unmasking the names of US citizens such as Michael Flynn to the NYT and WA Post for pure politics."
NFLX==the lest likely FANG stocks==
AND we still have another week before earnings!
After earning we take off hopefully a split
Guys how u will trade Nflx tmr if earning positive tonight !
Incredible!
Up 25% in last ten trading days.
"Man, when will people start listening to me. We all have a thing called ""The world wide web"" And people want good things at a good price. Now, I have been researching this sector for years and I am a subscriber to Netflix but I don't use it. Now the reason why will shock you? They have the same shows on their since I started service. Now, let me give you an anology. If you have a starting five such as the golden state warriors and for years you are close to making the playoffs but then you lose in the first round if you do make it. Now, you trade some players or aquire all stars such as adding super all star Kevin Durant. You win the championship. Now, going back to Netflix is that they are not staying competitive and when Walmart which is way bigger than netflix will ever be starting their streaming service or how google is buying up the Virtual Reality sector you will see why Netflix will not compete. They need to clean up their business or they will get squished by its competitors."
A good chance Netflix will add 30 million subscribers this year.
"I bought Netflix just now at 496$. Hopefully, It will go up till next week. I believe in Netflix and I am confident about it. Go Netflix !!!!!"
Nice close.
Stay clear of netflix until it settles down. Some more downside seems to be coming up.
I think a rumored takeover by Apple is driving this stock higher every day. I really do.
"Matthew Harrigan reiterated sell rating, he has sell rating on NFLX since it was 300, his client would have made lot of money if he went long at 300."
Final trade yesterday on CNBC - sell NFLX. How's that working for you?
Going up.... We will close at 375
"Is this even getting propped up by actual buyers, or is it just held up by short covering? I cannot imagine any real thinking human buying at these levels."

The Best 8 Work From Home Stocks To Buy Right Now Check out https://youtu.be/KlbdcMnBESo
$FB $WIMI $NFLX Looks like someone wanted out so they Bid it up and dumped... hmmm. Not a lot of volume so not a big deal yet.
"All bulls here can you answer how tightly Netflix success associated with Disney association.2012 Netflix make deal with Disney.This is point where Netflix start gaining lot of subscriber. No wonder because Disney own top quality content and deal where most available on Netflix is big win. Turn out it was great money yet bad deal for Disney.Now one thing didn't change, Disney continue build top quality content and still own all copy right. License content is expiring on 2018 and Disney is not renewing. So when all those quality Disney content disapear will Netflix look same interesting and will it continue able to gaini subscriber.This is serious question you have to ask.Remember all those market excitement can be way to exit for big player, Even going short & one way transfer of funds from over excited trend follower to big player."
Wow beat by 2 million+ subscribers. To 700+ by end of week!
277 do we get 280 today ? maybe 290 tomorrow
"Netflix will keep rising and high, may still be time to get on the ship before it rises to the $400. that's my personal opinion only"
the will try to close 350 but the market and buffet push to 370
"If it breaks $340 tomorrow, the next support is around $280."
Look at the 3 year performance of Deutche Bank!!
"A lot of shorties getting clobbered! Oh, how I love that!"
Hopefully to see another 2-3% up today!
"I'm all for Netflix, but this run up is over played. Its due for a pull back. GL."
The market has corrected and nflx is oversold. Will go back to over 300 quickly.

There is a reason Netflix is shooting up guys . I’ll leave it to you to find out . But I’m very bullish for earnings and think this should see 400.

"Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) was given a new $375.00 price target on by Barclays PLC ( ) (analyst Kannan Venkateshwar). They now have a ""buy"" rating on the stock. 6.6% upside from the current price of $351.74."
"Competition in the space is only INCREASING.... going forward which makes the current nosebleed valuation for NFLX extremely difficult (impossible ?) to support....

"David Einhorn Is Short Netflix, he also shorted Tesla at 200 a share..."
Thats gona be green in the end of the day lol
NFLX should already be over $600 after that earnings report. Patience
"Let me tell you all something. NFLX is a good company. you want to buy it by all mean buy it. by the next year this time, it could be $600 a share or could be $100 a share. A company that gains or losses 30 billion $ in market cap in one week, is not an investment, is more of a gambling. Up until now, not much competitions for Netflix, but other companies now getting more serious or increase their exposures in this area, such as Amazon, Apple, Disney, AT&T, Hulu. With the current evaluations that Netflix has, it better be no competitions around. There is no room for errors. Don't just think because it dropped from $400+ to $360, now is a burgain. Once the trend breaks, the down fall is fast and furious"
