Recent headlines and conversations for M
How about it now short smellers? this will be over ten bucks by Friday easy and in the teens next week. Ha Ha Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!!!!!!
EXCELLENT NEWS>>>> EXPANDING INTO PETS & HAIR CARE >>>> HUGE HUGE MARKET!!!!!https://www.mytotalretail.com/article/macys-is-expanding-into-new-categories-including-pets-and-hair-care/
"If you can make Macy's drop really low in price, I'll get you a beer"
It's like path to the 20s is cleared
When earnings rebound for M and I expect they will the pe will also expand.
"This stock is puzzling. I was stopped out of my puts and have been waiting to get back in. However, as I previously wrote, this price action is concerning. I mentioned a fund could be looking to do takeover.. Then you see them buying back some debt today to take a 30M Q4 Charge to save on interest expense. Happy for the longs that have been able to get a little back. Anyone have thoughts on what's moving it higher?I know many people have said the stores are busy, the distribution post seems positive, however, Margins have always been an issue for Macy's."
"John Templeton did not believe in Efficient Markets theory nor did any successful money manager.John Templeton said in order to beat the market you must purchase what others are avoiding!Buy the diamond in the rough before others find it. He would buy companies in temporary problems that had the potential for greatness, and he would buy them before others saw the light at the end of the tunnel.Case in point is his purchase of Union Carbide right after a major chemical spill in India that killed thousands and injured 500,000. Most money managers sold! He bought! It was one of his most profitable purchases ever!To do better than others you have to buy what they arent buying. IF you only buy the popular stocks that everyone else buys like MSFT, Amazon etc. you wont achieve superior performance in your portfolio management. A word to the wise."
Only good news from Macy’s. New range is 28-35.
"Nomansky in full on meltdown mode, you almost feel bad for the guy... almost"
"Surprised to see this hanging tough today in the face of yet another 3-4% Dow decline, and no news other than the reg div being declared. I wasn't paying attention at the right time(s) and missed a chance to load some around $12.50."
This baby still flying under the radar unlike others where they are now talking about regulating trading.I'm holding.
There are 2 Mega distribution centers for Macys online sales for direct to customers and ship to store purchases . I have worked at the one located on the east coast since 2012. Since November 2020 we have had so much volume that we can’t keep up. The daily unit out bound unit goals has just shot through the roof.￼ I’ve never seen anything like it They have hundreds of jobs openings right now and cant get them filled￼. The stock we back in the 52 $70 range after a couple mega quarters that we’re about to have coming up. I dont have to be the CFO to know this stock is dirt cheap.
"After a year of social distancing, no new clothing and a few other things...you need to go shopping and put up something nice to travel or go social.."
"$5,68 (+9,02%).......... Let‘s all go according to the short-squeeze-script! Don‘t sell! Just buy and bid up. Shorts desperately need your shares. At any price........."
20s on the horizon boys!
Great long term investment.Huge gains for the patient investor. Dividend will be restored post covid like KSS
In South Carolina (SC) many of the gas stations are out of gas. The ones that have gas are swamped with long lines. The good news is Macys closed all but one of its stores in SC. In store pick-up for Macys just got more complicated on the East coast. Gennette won't say anything negative until earnings so he can keep his $10 to $12 million a year dream job. He'll be gone in a year or two with his golden parachute. Get out Sally.
"I love this, but how is M up today? Why would anybody buy M today and if they didn't yesterday?"
Macy's is up 9.58% to 17.38
Macy’s effective interest rate on debt is 4.6 percent. They pay a 6.25 percent dividend on stock. They’ve reduced debt to 4.8 billion. I don’t see why they don’t buy back a billion of stock to save payout and boost stock price.
Top reasons to buy M now. They only closed 9 stores last year and will close 37 more this year; turning them into fulfillment centers for e-commerce to compete with AMZN. They're saving millions to pay workers by eliminating the dividend as of March 2020. Reddit is talking about making shorts of M pay. Covid is almost over and rich vacationers will soon spend at M again. Yahoo says it will go to $9 this year. They owe a lot but interest rates will remain low. M has a parade and by going virtual they saved 12 million last year.
"I guess Macy's doesn't care about PR or their employees layoffs start in February. No bonus for sales staff, but I'm sure executive management and store management will be getting theirs.https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/business/wp/2018/01/11/walmart-to-raise-starting-hourly-wage-to-11-offer-paid-parental-leave/?utm_term=.a1a53172d13d"
BOYS...I AM LOADING THE BOAT. THE 10% DIVIDEND IS SAFE!!!! I STAND BY 20 BUCKS 1ST QUARTER 2020. THE STOCK WAS PRICED LIKE THE BOTTOM WAS FALLING OUT....AND IT DID NOT!!!!
"Typical trend for Macys is down on low volume days. And down on big DOW up days. MM's take control, when they can."
Me watching the market overreact to Macy's:
"December 23, 2020This February, the dingy vacant Macy’s building once filled with fluorescent lights, mannequins, and perfume counters will become the temporary new home of BHS. As department stores all across the nation are shutting their doors, unable to keep up with major online competitors, and in our case, opening them to PCB-displaced high schoolers, it is hard to imagine a time when these dinosaurs ruled the retail world. Miracle on 34th Street, written and directed by George Seaton, invites you into that world to experience the magic of Macy’s in its heyday through the story of a seasonal Santa, who just perhaps may be the real thing."
If we close up here every robot in town will buy this tomorrow.
"With every third outstanding Macy‘s-share sold short, i see an epic short-squeeze coming up......... and make no mistake: EPIC!!!"
"Yacktman Asset Management purchased shares in 4th Qtr and now has 7.91% of its shares in Macy's, to the tune of 24.4 million shares with a market value of 415 million dollars. Expecting big appreciation in stock price."
Tomorrow closing $8.44
EARNINGS UP!!!! OVER 60%!!!! WOW
Macys opened up by me in east coast feels like Christmas
Macy has to develop online shop like Amazon’s strategy.
buying back M today coz it is ready to hit $20 on Monday
"Steer clear of JP Morgan retail analysts. They botched it several times with ANF where I've made great calls, and now KSS where they reduced from outperform this morning. Not sure where they stand on Macy's, but I hope they're negative. It'd make me want to buy even more lol."
Will Macy#$%$ $11 tomorrow? Possibly $12 or $13 by Wednesday?
"I sold my stake this morning and now buying back on the cheap, but I'm impressed how low it's going today"
M will be $25 plus after report.
I love MACY's :)
"As someone who has a beautiful girlfriend who spends tons of money on clothes, I have to wonder about guys like Nomanskys personal life. You get your girlfriend her stuff from Chewy Im assuming?"
"Man, Macy's just can't hold a good day. I think what we are seeing a is a lot of jitters. However, it worries me that the stock would decline so much after the retail-wide good news on Tuesday."
"''On the corporate earnings front, department store Macy’s will be reporting ahead of the market open. Macy’s is expected to report an adjusted loss per share of $2.53 on $3.69 billion in revenue during its first quarter.A few weeks ago, Macy’s provided preliminary first quarter financial results. “The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted our first quarter sales and earnings results, but I am proud of the way our team navigated this difficult period and maintained the business while our stores were closed,” CEO Jeff Gennette said in a statement.“Our strong digital business sales trend continued throughout May, and it is encouraging to see that as we reopen a store, the digital business in that geography continues to be strong. By June 1, we had approximately 450 stores reopened, with the majority opened in their full format. Our reopened stores are performing better than anticipated. Importantly, we are receiving positive feedback on the curbside pickup experience and our efforts to create a safe and welcoming shopping environment,” he added.The company also said that it was seeing strong sell-through of its seasonal merchandise and expects to exit the second quarter in a clean inventory position.Department stores had been struggling even before COVID-19 wreaked havoc on the retail industry. Macy’s peers JCPenney (JCP) and Neiman Marcus both filed for bankruptcy in recent months.'' (source: yahoo)"
"Thank you guys, It's a new BUY opportunity!"
Folks I live in Boca Raton . The Macy store is doing fine and in a few months it will be a very different story. This should be 40.00 to 50.00 per share in 2021 end of story. Hold on to your shares.
"Macy's is consolidating and getting set to break through the small resistance that has been found at $16. I think a lot of buying will occur over the next 30 days by large institutions and funds, and a lot of investors will be asking how safe is the dividend and moving into M for a value play in this age of no way to get safe yield."
Volume is nice as well! Macy‘s going back to double-digits! Give or take!
"The shorts must be trying to delude themselves that a major sector swap is underway, tech is going out and retail, fashion and banking coming back into vogue."
Some Fool at Motley doesn’t like this stock. I think Macy’s will be one of the few department stores still standing when everything is all said and done￼
"on March 18 2020 ( in the middle of the pandemic) amazon bought lord and taylor building on Fifth ave (424 Fifth ave) for 1 billion dollars The building size is 600,00 square feet. Macys herald square store size is 2.5 million square feet and is in as good or not a better location. https://rew-online.com/amazon-closes-on-978m-purchase-of-lord-taylor-building/what does that make the Herald square location worth?

"P&G CFO: ""Consumer spending is very strong"". At the end of the day, retail is consumer driven, all of the false narratives can't deny the fact that people are spending money. We can discuss all day long why this is down or why Williams Sonoma, a company that almost unanimously is considered one of the best in class has been weak lately, but the truth is the earnings reports will be good."
"2021 Macy's Chart looking very bullish, like it!"

Just for fun if they crush earnings what kind of squeeze should we expect them all thoughts welcome
"Pouya, aren't you supposed to be on the Amazon site? Have you ever noticed how dramatically Amazon has shifted to having a strong brick and mortar presence? Buyout of Whole Foods. Collaboration with Kohl's to accept returns and exchanges. Opening stand alone Amazon retail outlets in select cities. Tells me that they aren't that confident about two points 1) that they will continue to dominant the on-line space as retailers such as Wal-mart with their recent acquisition of Jet, Target who had a very good on-line presence this past Christmas season and Williams Sonoma nows accounts for 52% of their revenues from on-line sales. 2) That the expected conversion of consumers from in person shopping to on-line shopping may not reach the penetration levels that many ""experts"" thought. Actually the younger generations are rebelling against on-line and going for the more personal and casual shopping experience that only brick and mortar can provide."
"""The company [Macy's] ended the quarter with about $7 billion in combined short- and long-term debt compared to a mere $2.7 billion in shareholders’ equity."" https://finance.yahoo.com/news/macys-wont-survive-a-second-wave-of-covid-19-top-strategist-165317077.html"
"TY short sellers, now start buying"
"Yeah, roll back down the hill. M is King of the 52 week low. Another one coming soon!"
"But sales at electronics and appliance stores fell 0.4%. Receipts at building material stores dropped 0.5% and sales at clothing stores declined 1.0%. Spending at furniture stores fell 0.9%, the largest decline since December 2018.Clothing stores sales declined. Isn't that what Macys sells?"
Huge sell volume. Follow the trend.
Come on shorties! Buy and cover your shorts! This is going but higher. Macy‘s WILL survive! Double-digits coming again........ Short-squeeze will be very hefty........... Whatever it takes.........
Eric Macy's lost $623 millions dollars FACT Here is the Yahoo income statement https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/M/financials?p=M
not sure wats with the daily decline but more and more stimulus incoming is coming to prop up the economy
Does Macy’s stock in general have a better potential than KOHLS currently?
Going down the road and jcp
"guys, don't panic. fundamentals are great. real estate is great. div' is great. hold and everything will be fine."
AMAZON!!!!!!!!
"Last year on January 31 2020 Macy's had long term debt of $3.62 billion and shareholder's equity of $6.38 billionOn October 31, 2020 Macy's had long term debt of $4.85 billion and shareholder's equity of $2.24 billion.The share price now is the same as it was last January, except look at those numbers, look at the trend for department stores and mall traffic in December, look at continued store closure announcements, look at the lack of dividend which there was last year. These are facts and figures, they are based in reality, they are not some arbitrary declaration that ""this stock should be x amount of dollars based on nothing"".Debt ratios, Forward P/E's, sales growth, profit margins, growth rate of EPS.. these things matter much more than what someone decides is a nice looking number. For Macy's shares to be $30 it would have to be valued at twice what Target's shares are valued at as a multiple of earnings. Target had double digit sales growth this year while Macy's had double digit sales declines.Macy's was in big trouble before the pandemic and I don't see anything that has changed the course it was on, except to hasten it's decline."
"Do All Your Christmas Shopping This Holiday From Macy'sIf you own any shares in this company then you should make it your priority to fill your entire shopping list from Macy's and do it preferably online because that's what critics will be looking for comes February !!If we beat last year 4th quarter #s and street view on both revenue and profit then we will be flying high back into the $30s So do your part, then encourage friends and family members to do the same !!!!"
The shorts are going to squeal tomorrow
$8 -> $9.5 -> $11 -> $15 -> $20 ( in 6 months)
"Warren Buffet: ""Buy when others are fearful."" Seems like there are thousands of investors here on this board who have NO fear at all."
Will hit 17.5 first 30 minutes and gradually fade down to 16.5 end of day.
What's the news? It's almost gonna hit my average $8. lol
"I hoped to double my position at around 9, but I'm happy with the shares I have now with that first little push :-)"
$17 PLUS CLOSE for SURE !!!!!
"Own 2000 shares... Will get diviend $ 0.38 per share . So, i will get extra $ 760 as diviend this quarter . Love Macy."

By Friday above $10.50 Or Thursday
Question for the shorters: why do you go short and what is your target and time horizon?
Where is Dan? He was saying Monday double digits... I think he meant with a decimal point in front of it...
Margin calls.
"Taken from another investor I follow and happen to agree with:“Caviet to good investing is day traders & shorter's & MM's are not in the game for the long term (3months or more) gain. Their game is to buy lo lo lo thus relentless bashing to drive the s/p down, then sit chilly until a profit is realized & sell sell sell. This strategy is to accumulate a larger cache of shares, enough to drop the s/p when they are ready to sell, accumulation of 100's of thousands of shares is the goal so they have the power to rinse & repeat. They want your shares on the cheap & will say anything to sway your opinion & emotions. Take note of who these players are so you can evaluate their post with a grain of salt. They seem to be real good at predicting when the s/p is going to drop, but disappear when s.p is going up. They will be here this weekend trying to convince you this stock is worthless, be smart & ignore their post or mute them. They are like a virus & are considered to be the lowest hanging fruit on the tree.If you ignore them they rot & fall to the ground to be squashed like bugs.“I think we have a good idea who these folks on this message board are."
Chris Sain called this stock out and it’s making some uptrend

$ 20 now...
"I was surprised that M was on the list of 50 most shorted stocks. It was about 38th on the most shorted list. Who would short a stock with a 9% dividend? They'll have to pay it. I bought more Friday at $16,61 just to see it close 21 cents lower than my purchase price. Oh well I'll get $4000 dividend on 2 April 2020."
"I work in the e-commerce industry.I see more and more manufacturers putting restriction on their sales of goods on third party market places on eBay and amazon. Manufactures are finally responding with copyright notices and MAP violations.While I buy a lot from amazon my last designer clothe purchase was from a brick and mortar store. It was cheaper and returns where very smooth.While some might say retail is dead, I will take my knowledge and experience and invest in Macy's.Good luck to all longsI would mind if the shorts keep shorting so I can buy it at a lower price. This is strictly my opinion."
"Last crisis in 2009 Macys stock, as well as many others, went to $5/share then recovered in a V fashion.Same as in 2009.Was heavily shorted in 2009 too.BBBY has is shorted twice as much as Macys. Look what BBBY stock is doing.Same here.Shorts are noted for losing often especially in this market."
"Although I shop in the store at Macy's, I normally buy online at Macy's so to me it's irrelevant. Macy's is more of a get out of the house experience with my girlfriend. Me personally I shop Macy's online. I also shop Nordstrom."
Macy’s green
Macy's has one fundamental that almost no other stock has.....a real value 25% higher than the stock price. this will always protect m from going lower.
Sell over 18 or hold?
This management is simply doing poorly! It needs to hire an outside expert consultant perhaps from the nearest university to point out their critical errors and provide several recommendations on how to improve their critical business.
M to the moon....
"short to 20, easy money with this"
Short interest reduce from 35% to 28%. Someone short covered 20m shares over night.
Guy Adomi on CNBC's Fast Money just recommended M as a buy.
Love Macy stock..

"I am not selling before earnings. It wants to go much higher. We may have back to back 10% plus gains multiple days in a row. Losses are already priced in, and then some."
"JCP just announced yoga, arcade games and coffee, wth is M going to do?...it better have a better game plan than those clothes."
What’s. Interesting is on Sunday I was at my two closest malls. Both had virtually no parking. Kohl’s was crowded as was Macy’s.. I was very surprised at the activity this far before Christmas. It wasn’t like this last year. Anecdotal but interesting.
January 2005 market cap was $15 billion. Today market cap is $2.2 billion. Loss of 87%. One of the poorest managed companies in USA
"Macy's is too high end shopping what Nike is to tennis shoes and Nike is right now, today, trading at all time highs. Macy's will be back to the mid teens before Thanksgiving as online shopping from Macy's spreads over the world and people return to the stores with the implementation of a covid 19 vaccine."
It’ll be ok
Love MACY stock..
"The latest data shows that the death rate of this virus is not near what experts were telling us in March. Macy‘s will still be here when covid is long gone. Cowen‘s says that Macy‘s online sales could ring up to $449 millions monthly. Meanwhile 68 stores reopened this week, 50 more on 11th May and soon all 775 Macy‘s nationwide until mid June the latest. Customers can‘t wait to shop and go out again."
Back to $20 direction next week ..got me a nice dip 6k at 15.04
This stock is weird. They sell at 16.7 and buy at 17.5 to make it go to 18??
https://www.morningstar.com/articles/942666/macys-deflates-and-now-its-even-more-undervalued
My firm believes this can easily go to $185.00 a share in 2 years and $500.00 per share Seems plausible but you do realize this is trading below 10$.. It's going to be higher with patience.
Not surprised if Green by day end.
The short shares over the shares outstanding = 33.48%. The company only needs to pay dividend to 33.04% shares outstanding. So it is sustainable!
"Wow, I sold out at $16.42 on Jan 3 and took heat for doing it. This is incredible."
M to 44 b4 xmas!
What IF a trade deal is signed with China and all tariffs are lifted? Is that concerning to anyone that is invested in Macy’s equity? Just thinking out loud...
"50 million shares traded so far:-) Short-squeeze is going its way according to the short-squeeze-script/manual:-) Let‘s keep up the buying pressure and do NOT sell! If you want/need to, then put in only some small amounts for MUCH higher prices. And in addition buy MUCH more and/or put some bids in to support the ascent. Do not forget: Shorts desperately need your valuable shares, at almost any price if Macy‘s keeps on rising on decent volume! Let‘s all work together and proceed according to the short-squeeze-playbook (search Short-squeeze on Wilipedia). All you need to know after today us: Macy‘s WILL survive............ every THIRD share is sold short:-) Act accordingly all together and we‘ll propel this great American icon to double-digits where it belongs........... Whatever it takes.........."
Macy‘s Annual Shareholders Meeting starts at 11am EDT....... Get ready for some really good news ladies and gentlemen......... whatever it takes.........
What do you guys think about the changes to the board of directors?
As they said on the halftime report about M surging online sales... Going to be a fun close for the longs today. Great work M.
See where are the afternoon warriors chirping at how this would open down today? Is that Doopey guy still around? Macy's was here before us and probably will be here after us. Long on Macy's!
"Austria, Hungary, Poland, Belgium, Iceland, Portugal, Bulgaria, Ireland, Romania, Cyprus, Italy, Russia Macy's stores are in these countries to name a few and are open also, online ecommerce look it up they are top 10"

This should turn green anytime soon
Beat and add 100 million in savings next quarter.
"Macy’s Stock Is Rising as Stores Reopen to More Shoppers Than ExpectedMacy’s shares were jumping Thursday morning after the department store said customer demand at its reopened stores has been “moderately higher than…anticipated.”“We are confident we will obtain this financing before it is needed, allowing us to improve our financial flexibility,” Chief Executive Jeff Gennette said in a statement."
Cramer last week said to buy M. Yesterday he said to sell. Does he remember what he suggests.I am bullish with M with shops opening.
"Is M down, because earnings were not good enough, or because of short manipulation. Me thinks the later. Anyway, it's good to have more time to add more shares of M."
Down yet again on a huge up day for the markets in general. Single digits are inevitable
"Any thought on how or when we push thru the $7 Cant seem to rise above the last 3-4 daysSeems stuck between 6.50 and 7Any news, report, event etc that might help the sector ??"

"This is Why! Cracks Are Showing in the Junk Bond Market. A Selloff Could Be Coming. The worst-performing bonds in the ICE BofA high-yield index this week have been in virus-sensitive sectors. And the sectors posting the worst overall performance were department stores, health facilities, theaters and entertainment, leisure and travel companies, energy producers, and airlines."
"I don't understand this stock at all. It covers its dividend, has an enterprise value above its market cap if it were to close today, and manages to make a profit while paying down debt and increasing capex and it gets tanked hard. Is the assumption that this stock is going to 0 because the whole retail sector is going to 0? If not the valuation makes absolutely no sense to me."
Macy‘s is doing the right things: The CEO gets no salary during the crisis and they‘re saving money wherever possible:https://www.businessinsider.com/macys-ceo-wont-be-paid-during-coronavirus-2020-3?r=US&IR=T About 25% of revenue comes from Macy‘s-online-store......... thats absorbing these few weeks........ and maybe Macy‘s has insurance for this short virus-closure.........Short-squeeze-potential is very real........... whatever it takes..........
Macy’s is in the midst of a remarkable digital transformation . If good control of debt tomorrow this should go up 4–5x in line with what Best Buy or wayfair trade at as they figured out digital
"J, have to finally agree with you, it was a trap to draw in small retail investors back into retail and fashion, the big boys are already dropping the other retailers back down, they are focusing on pumping tech. Though they will play with retail and fashion to buy cheap shares in preparation for the mid summer pump."
Stores in Colorado are empty with more employees than customers. When is the next earnings report?
Longs must love it
"Hi, if I will buy shares on Wednesday am I in with dividends?"
Insider Director Lenehan William H bought 2500 shares on 8/17. Just read the news. Small amount but at least someone bought lol
Macy’s I’m Sure Will Survive... Jus needs a little more time and less Corona News ...
"With the Amazon Macys merger in Robert's dreams I thought we'd be above $20 by now. Maybe five quick pump posts will get us there. In all actuality, shorts hate Fridays will be the reason M finishes with an up day."
It will spike tomorrow up to 15 dollars ... billionaires investor... bought shares on Macy’s! Buy now... up tomorrow!
Macy's price was higher not too long ago when the street was debating whether they could earn 3 dollars per share with 7 billion in debt. They'll do likely this year $3 with 4 billion in debt. Go figure.
"Macys is laughing and saying ""They know nothing"". I can't wait for Q4 earnings and when Macys buys another company or becomes partners with another company. Think about it people...if Macy's was doing bad they wouldn't be paying off debt for the fun of it. They have big plans overtime. Little by little they are making smart moves. You have to be long in Macy's stock. I will continue to buy more and more shares at a lower price with a free 4% dividend for waiting. Btw, the whole market is down lately."
The trend is crystal clear. I'm wondering if I shouldn't buy like I did with last week's dip...
Covid was like Armageddon situation for retail stores like Macy's. Amazon stock price almost doubles during this tune thinking that it will be de facto place to shop. Ironically Macy's and other retailers earnings report is telling us different story. What next? High probability thqt Amazon stock will go back to its pre covid level.
Vaccines coming soon in warp speed. It'll be OK and everyone should just relax and enjoy the Macy's fireworks next week. Macy's will do fine and keep growing upwards from here on. $10+ soon.
"Nice 5 day chart. Higher highs, higher lows. Trending a little higher each day."
New study by German scientists reveal that Covid 19 is not as deadly as we thought! Google it people.. media and CNBC won’t show this...
"I hate to see M downgraded. Please don't buy anything from Scamazon. We all need M to stay around forever. The country needs a nice place to shop to go in and look at nice clothes, try them on, etc."
Stay Strong 12.5-14.5 for now Then The News
"Total Return on this stock has been so bad that very few have it beat. No dividend, no eps increase, dead revenue...why would anyone be buying this?"
Never invest in a stock in the hopes private equity will get involved
Macy has a quarter of its profit through e-commerce. And is currently the 10th largest e-commerce merchant in the US. I am not saying M deserve a high PE. But it also doesn't derserve a 10 year low stock price as of today. Either way to each of its own. I am buying here while collecting my dividend for the long-haul. Good Luck M Investors.
HOLD!!! ))
"Come on Macy's, insiders are buying shares why aren't you. I've said it before M can just be flat earnings and flat sales and the stock is undervalued so it doesn't matter if the market doesn't appreciate M they only need to focus on some share back backs at these levels and M will have no choice but go back to 30. Otherwise just keep buying back shares at 21... I'm definitely okay w that!"
@ 9:30PM Mall is still packed with shoppers in Cerritos CA. It's going to be a great holiday season for Macy
"Series of bailouts are taking place at the moment to prevent bancruptcies. From federal government' perspective: It's either 130k unemployment checks every month, and loss of income tax revenue or loans at 0% interest and let it recover. Coronavirus is not a permanent thing. It will get better for Macy's."
"IN 10K SHARES 5.17, FOLLOW ME, I SHALL SHOW YOU THE WAY TO THE LIGHT"
I own this stock for the dividends. I still believe that the dividend is safe regardless of the Credit Suisse downgrade
"The Herald Square store, alone, is worth 3/4 the market cap of M."
4.98 since yesterday all in. confirmed bankers holding this stock.
"I’m no pumper, but everything Nomanski says is speculative. Puts and calls expire and change all the time. My guess is he’s got significant short positions and needs M to drop in order to not lose the premium. Seems he knows a little something about options trading, but his agenda is clear. I’m an investor, not an options trader—so I’m betting on M’s rise."
Why down today? Totally unexpected
Everything else I shop online but not clothes
"Looking good. Now just needs a PR on great consumer response with those 68 stores that opened yesterday. Many many more to come over next weeks. All 775 Macy‘s stores/malls to reopen mid June the latest. Back to normal step by step, back to normal stock prices (e.g. double-digits)"
If Macy's would beat and raise and that is a HUGE IF...stock would be up 30%
short squeeze will happen here
Bought another 1000 shares. I have a total shares of 9000 now. Ready for the dividend.
"Get yer rally caps on. Macy's is headed back up, keep the momentum going."
$6.00 coming
Huge after hours buying and right before the end of day!! Think thats a good sign with over 4 mlln guys and hope this thing doubles soon!!
Macy’s is like Christmas  Not going anywhere BUT UP each yearIt’s Dividend time again
panic time? BB&B PIER ONE both downers M looks GREAT by comparisonpreemptive strike announcing closing storesM going to be touted as a VALUE play and as long as the dividends safe and high the shorts will be kept at baystill............................
+8% M. JCP and Neman Marcus skipped debt payments.
"RETAILKohl’s says it added 2 million new customers in 2020, thanks to AmazonKohls tried to sell themselves to Amazon.... but Amazon eyes, only the BEST of the Best in Presence!!!!MACYS!!!!"

Shorts thought they had an easy meal but got their teeth kicked out instead. All I saw today.
"Anyone trying to figure out whether to buy and hold long or sell short and hold has one big decider: Shorts have to pay longs a 10% dividend plus any fees they are charged to borrow stock. IMO, they will find their risk reward ratio pushing them to cover. When they cover, that is another force that will drive PPS increases and PE expansion to more normal levels. Their are a lot of much better short prospects, and we already have seen the high multiple growth stocks weaken, while value stocks are improving. That rotation favors M."
"I personally don't think any of the people who have held this for a long time should be hoping for any of the following:1) private equity2) management LBO.3) activist investor who tries to push for sale of company4) another foreign retailer coming in to acquirer.Look at Tiffany's experience, the price was down substantially when LVMH gave their initial offer, they did up it finally to close the deal, but it only amounted to a little less than their highs a year previously, so most shareholders really gained nothing for holding the stock an additional year. In the case of Macy's we are so beaten down, that even the most darling of premiums doesn't even get up back to where it was a year ago. All we can hope for is that the management is able to successfully implement their plan and the profits begin to increase accordingly."
I think this company is paying too much dividend that they cannot afford instead of paying for their debt. If they continue to pay this much dividend I think they will end up like JCP and SEARS and others who are now gone. This should be the time to start re structuring and save this company before it becomes like the others who are no longer here or are on their way out.
big win

Bought 564 shares !Did I make a mistake ? Looking to swing trade If continues to uptrend
Have avoided retail stocks in the past two years. Could someone please give me reason why anyone would buy Macys?
"Fed operations have begun a process that is now, and will continue to strengthen the dollar. This has profound effects on stock classes going forward. High PE growth is slowing and those stocks began to come under pressure in September. There is a stock rotation under way that is shifting from growth to ""value"" type stocks. Among the ""winners"" for this next phase are good earners, not small earners or growth that has not yet turned the corner.Large, companies with good balance sheets, consistent earnings, high dividend payments and many of the characteristics exhibited by Macy's are coming into favor, at a remarkable time in which certain cyclical trends have driven M to multi year PPS lows. There are many ways to look at the risks and rewards in holding M for the upcoming rotation. Certainly high yield will be a great driver if the dividend is safe. As this becomes more clear, M can double on yield alone. If the payout continues, the PPS must adjust to around a 5%yield, IMO, and if M drives annual EPS back to the $4/share range, it will more than double.So do the work to see how they can, and likely will, drive EPS above $4/share in this coming ""value"" environment.They have debt reduction, cost reduction, asset sales and other balance sheet tactics in play. They have spelled it all out. Just read what they are planning to do to reduce debt and costs.The second leg of their plan is a large number of initiatives that can grow sales and margins. These also have been spelled, and they appear to be good plans that are more or less doable, including key store improvements.There is always risk and more than one outcome possible, but now the odds favor M, far more than at any time in the last few years, while sentiment is down, manipulation attempts are rampant, and the market is in a fear phase. Do your diligence, as shorts will cover, the greed phase will come, and good buys here will be rewarded, IMO."
I love short shorts. More to come!
"Online sales are not the only market place change which reduces Macy's brick and mortar sales.Those who are retired or elderly buy fewer clothes than when they were in the peak of their working years. The clothing which is purchased is of a different, usually less expensive, style than before. Eventually, most of what is purchased is night clothes as they become bed-ridden except for trips to the doctor.This age bracket buys even less in the way of home furnishings. Their homes have long since been furnished. New purchases are limited to replacement of stuff which wore out. Frequently we are trying to get rid of accumulated stuff instead of adding to the collection.Generations behind us are smaller. Purchasing power may be limited by student debt load.To survive, Macy's must either adapt to changing purchasing patterns of the Baby Boomers or write us off as a market segment. Macy's must also adapt to purchasing patterns of the Millennials."
Markets will rebound tomorrow. And Macy‘s will bring BIG news........ Perfect timing!!!
M needs to break $21.10 today and it's up to $23 range from there. Mr. R Sorry about your loss.
"Analyse is now: Strong buy, Buy and Hold...Something is happening and healthy news are going to be delivered..Dont be mistaken by shorters, they are worried today.Buy and hold mid term.enjoy reward and cheers your familly with $M this end of year.."
Timber ....... another big box retailer going under the Amazon knife. Save what you got or stay with nothing. Buy the dips? ..... not me bye bye !!!
This going to 12 very soon!
Adding 7000 more sales reps -- up we go some more!
"Macys is a great American Company. They've got millions in real estate in downtown areas though out America. When Eddie Lambert's hedge fund bought out Kmart in 2002 he sold 30 Kmart's a year in the inner cities for millions in profit and did the same when he merged Sears with Kmart in 2011. In the end SHLD went bankrupt and common shareholders got pennies on the dollar. My buddy had a K mart pension and it was cut by 75%. You can't borrow and sell property to make a profit although you can with GAAP and EBITDA. My guess is our CEO Gennette will leave in two years with his $12 million a year salary and bonuses to a warm beach front community in Florida, which taxes him little. Do you believe he'll make his goal of $25 billion in digital sales in 2023? I saw the same goals with other bankrupt retailers. It is easy to have a goal two years out. Look at the financials. Macys is a mess."
"With a debt of over $8 Billion and long term interest rate going up, I am careful with it, financing this debt will take a toll on the company!"
or is Amazon earnings call today ? not Macy?
"Congratulations to all who held. This is a strong performance stock, won't give in that easy"
Back to precovid prices and beyond ! ($50-80_share)
This could open at $8 tomorrow at this rate
"With improvements on the horizon, and Macy’s stock price sitting at dirt-cheap valuation levels, now actually seems like a good time to get bullish on Macy’s stock. I think that Macy’s stock price can reach $30 by the end of the year, implying 20%-plus upside over the next eight months."
"Fresh baked lows of the day at the close. Tomorrow, lows of the year? But ""retail is nack"", right Scooby"
Macy will release diviend news soon
Jim Cramer on mad money saying now is the time to buy M
They're going to try and tank retail hard one more time before the Black Friday numbers are out.
"Buy this for 10 years, reinvest dividends, get rich."
"The way up is never a straight line !!!Hang on on to your shares....the road ahead is gonna be Bumpy, Don’t get nervous and start selling every time it goes down"
M is going to reach 19.5 by friday
Honestly those are pretty good number! Cnbc made it sound like was terriable ER! They did great job and beat it
"I walk into Macy's and there are returned Christmas purchases everywhere. After the Stock Market crashed on Christmas and the 800,000 Government workers have no pay checks and interest rates flew up. Everybody returned all their stuff. This country is in trouble? Cash is King."
"Great Idea . Amazon should buy macys and put a smaller version of whole foods in each store.thus making them the higher end walmart or target.One stop shopping folks is the future . most of the whole foods have bars in them .Think eat ,drink ,buy groceries and buy a outfit"
"Always remember Rule 1 only buy stocks that trading WAY, WAY, under value. Rule 2 Always get paid very well to wait ( Cash Flow always tells you the dividend is safe or not ). Rule 3 and the hardest to stick to, You must sell when your stock gets back over valued. If you are buying stocks that are way under value and paying you to wait. They will always get to over value again and you will always have to sell them. Fact. Very hard to do most can not, Why because of the Wall Street manipulation machine. Wall Street is the best at it in the world, Why because they invented the Wall Street game."
OMG! Are you taking advantage of these free trade alerts? If not there literally has to be something wrong with you. go to (http://Multistockalerts.com) now.
The time is now May is going to be the ride back up For M
This funding is a big deal for Macy’s. More liquidity is a game changer. Now they can have more leverage against competitors and suppliers.

7.49 will be closing
Morgan Stanley still bullish on Amazon at 100 times earnings with no dividend and negative on Macy's at less then 8 times earnings and close to 5% dividend
I’m predicting 110% stock growth and the price would be 11.12 in about 1 1/2 months
"Macy's isn't Reddit driven. If it were, this message board would read like AMC's. When they do come, however, put on your golden parachute."
"M shares have a book value of $20.60 per share, thus a price to book ratio of 0.63. Plus their balance sheet probably undervalues its real estate assets. If the company were liquidated (not likely in any event) investors would not lose a penny."
"MACY'S are a savvy company and I think they will get through all this just fine when the smoke clears from this virus, long term I can see them at 50 dollars a share. They have very smart people at the helm UNLIKE Sears."
"MACY'S is either going to zero or $25-$45 in 3 years.Macy's has been around since 1858. It has survived the civil war, Spanish flu, world war 1, world war 2, Vietnam war, Clinton, Obama, 911, Amazon, and will likely survive Covid19"
"Government is looking at retail and we shall hear good news soon. Macy‘s can probably also get rent reductions, insurance payments due to governmental closures and reopens tomorrow Monday with a big bang. Everybody is looking for pleasure and entertainment and will head to the malls. They all want to look good and dress nice when they have to show up at workplace and go out dating:-)"
"high ranking things sales will be strong growth next year, this year bottomed out, because American people income can keeping continues growth, Macy's sales can double and profit $4bln after 4years, so M can reach $125 per share in 4years, wmt, tgt , amzn, kss and GPS will stop growth, old navy will be bankruptcy again,"
getting ready for earnings. cant wait for 2/25.
That Robert who urged you to buy Tuesday afternoon really is nice :)
To reap full appreciation you have to be patient and let it grow! By the end of the year your money will be doubled! Worth it me!
I wonder if Philip is on his way to the bank for more personal loan?? Keep shorting M and this will make the longs happy forever!!!
BZ: Macy's shares are trading higher after Jefferies upgraded the stock from Hold to Buy and announced a $14 price target.
"well, I bought some at $40, bought some more at $25. will likely buy more at $15.00, I just want to get my average price paid a little lower."
Macy’s Green 12+
Thought earning was May 18 ???
"I read the negative on M. Just remember, a patient consumer is a wise consumer. M will rise once again. Since the 1800's M has survived. It's because of good management. Think before you criticize."
"Analysts all day on CNBC..nobody goes to mall everyone shops at Amazon, Target and Walmart...the mall here there was no parking and it was a madhouse the last 2 weeks...but nobody goes to the mall. Oh and who on gods green earth buys there clothes at Walmart and Target"
Heading upwards. I see fireworks towards closing. $10 next week. All aboard!
"Yes M may be breaking out but I sold and I can find better options. I/you/we can do betterNo more langishing with familiar iconic name brands like F, M and T, etc..- On to tech and transports."
Shorts may God be with u next week
How isn’t Macy’s going up like ulta did... Macy’s sells ulta products Macy’s sells clothes and appliances like kuregs and a lot of clothing and appliance names have been bullish. ?
Set me free.....
"Macys literally does not sell anything that you can buy at Walmart or Target. Its like saying LULULEMON is losing sales to Walmart and Target. Sure, Walmart and Target sell exercise clothes but very low quality items and a very few of them and they have a poor selection because most of their floor footage is devoted to groceries. Fact is LULULEMON sell a very expensive high end version of exercise clothing. It is no doubt true that Walmart and Target though they sell exercise clothes don't sell the same type as LULULEMON and thus don't take any sales from them at all. Likewise Macys does not lose any business to Target or Walmart as they are not competitors because they don't sell the same exact products.Macys is worth $75/share"
Looks like Blackrock agrees with me.http://archive.fast-edgar.com//20190910/ASAWN222Y222J2Z2222K2CZZLUNBZ262A2B2/
"Look at this headline already ""Macy's Smashes Q3 Earnings Forecast, Boosts 2018 Outlook Ahead of Black Friday"". Well done Jeff Gennette! Positive changes!"
$M Rising with good volume. Looking for breakout at 26.48 for a run up to 30.93. http://www.foxchart.com/share/842821279.png
Ouch they stopped 26.
nobody buying
M message board is becoming irrelevant. Buy more M to put more money in my Short pocket. Zombie company as Bloomberg stated last weekend.
"Macys by my place is always packed, can barely find parking post-pandemic, and as holidays approaching this should get to 12$ in no time."
I’m so nervous about tomorrow
"$39.83. Not much further to $40. I have a feeling we'll reach it today. Not saying we'll close above it, but such a rally will get more people on the M train."
"BOYS.....AN INTERESTING METHOD OF DETERMINING VALUE HAS BECOME THE EV/EBITDA RATIO. WHEN YOU COMPARE MACYS, TO OTHER COMPANIES IT BECOMES VERY APPARENT THAT AT CURRENT VALUES....MACYS IS A HUGE, HUGE VALUE !!!!"
Who said no short squeeze. This was very very good earnings. 20+ today
"On Monday, Macy's Inc opened its 34th Street flagship store in Manhattan. Around 3 p.m. that day, there were only a handful of shoppers, way outnumbered by staff on the floor, according to a Reuters photographer. lol"
"If Macy's posts positive quarterly result and short squeeze, this would end up above $25 in no time."
Macy will recover in no time. $14 is the bot. I see $17 by end of December.
"Oh, by the way our leader Jeffrey has made over 22 trades of the Macy`s Inc stock since 2011, according to the Form 4 filled with the SEC. Most recently he sold 47,190 units of M stock worth $600,257 on 28 February 2020.The largest trade CEO Gennette ever made was exercising 156,221 units of Macy`s Inc stock on 24 February 2012 worth over $5,778,615. On average, CEO Jeffrey Gennette trades about 18,845 units every 77 days since 2009. As of 28 February 2020 he still owns at least 173,005 units of Macy`s Inc stock. Now we know why M shares sell-off on market up days. Our fearless leader needs a new summer house on the beach and boat dock for his yacht. He knows his company and he regularly sells. Our CEO's net worth is at least $23 million."
Macy’s has the best merchandise at the best price.
Obviously M is a delayed up! Now the theory both fundamentally and technically supports M to go above $7 direction!!!
"Maybe a few more baseless pumps by robert can get us to a $18 close. A Community College could teach this guy the fundamentals of reading a balance sheet, EBITDA and GAAP. If CEO Gennette sells his $7.5 million in free M shares every year why should the common person hold. The hedge fund Yacht whatever is not in a vacuum. More M pain next week."
$20.00 is next resistance point lots of upside to Macy's in the next few years
"Prediction: We will not hear a word from ""Freedom Fraud"" or ""Patterns Pea Brain"", after Macy's reports earnings on Tuesday. These keyboard warriors are all bark and no bite!!!"
WMT drags down retail.
"Problem with shorting is something major could suddenly happen that causes a stock like this to shoot upward premarket many hundreds of a percent and then its too late to get out.Like a sudden offer to buy out Macys by Amazon.Amazon needs and wants Macys very valuable assets. Macys is greatly undervalued due wholly because of the Covid nonsense. Macys was doing extremely well prior to covid, paying down debt, giving out a handsome dividend and quarter after quarter, year after year posting a huge profit.Fact is this stock has been unfairly sold off."
dont sell before 30$
We could see a potential buyout of Macy's by private equity limited downside with real estate asstes and improving sales also if PE buys M the elimination of the dividend alone could help fund the yearly debt obligations..Macy's would fetch $40-45/share today in a take private deal
"Macy's owns real estate worth 2-3x its market cap, they are making billions in revenue a year, they pay a huge, seemingly safe dividend, but this thing continues to drop?"
"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Macy’s Inc. is having a miserable year. With meager sales growth and a lackluster annual forecast, it is currently the worst-performing stock in the S&P 500 Index."
There are some companies that will get out of this alive but you have to realize Macy’s had problems before the Corona.There is a reason their CFO quit right away . They have interim CFO. If by any chance this goes up to 7-8$ take loss or take whatever profit you have Cos this is another JCP. Kohl’s will probably be the only one surviving and only Cos they are incorporating into Amazon..Macy’s CEO hin self said that they will be a lot smaller company one this is through.But the damage is already done. And they own most of their stocks. But they will quarter their company after this.
They are trying to shake the tree early in trading...Everyone hold on!!!!
breakout city!
"Our short seller posters are making terrible arguments. Lol. M is about to go on a sales run that will likely include massive short covering. Big Xmas sales season for M is developing. Many key factors all falling into place for productivity increases using technology, plus a large free cash flow to pay down debt. Possible share repurchases too, all reducing costs, and helping margins. M is turning the corner, IMO. BIG PPS GAINS IN THE OFFING!"
WOW even Cramer now talking dividend cut and that's not good
It will about $50-70 in next economic cycleYou have to buy and hold at least few years.
https://seekingalpha.com/article/4326063-macys-why-store-closures-are-good-for-investors
Can anyone give some real thoughts on this other than the shorts trying to bring it down? Is this still on the way down?? Thoughts?
"Ive said this before and will say it again..if M ever drops below $10,sell your house and grab as much as possible..by the end of December,it will be at $14+"
"I don't think Macy's is irrelevant. Recently I bought a furniture sectional from them after considerable research of competing products. First visited their on-line store, then visited the store and actually sat on the furniture. Much better quality then the competing store offers and competitively priced. I wouldn't buy everything at Macy's, but they do offer a lot of good and competitively priced merchandise. I believe their financials will stabilize over time and the share price will rebound (over time)."
"Telling for months over 20$ stock, heading to 30's. Earnings guidance 1.71$-2.13$ with a p/e of 10 it's about the current price get it to 12 we can see 25$ soon"
down $5 in 1 week ?? Omg ! why ?
A lot of people like to go shopping. They want to see and try on the clothing before they buy. Their web site is good for those that want that experience. I think M will persevere and lots of upside potential.
i hope the short squeeze will come at higher prices
"SHORTING THIS .... after GREAT RESULTS is VERY DANGEROUS3 words for the shorts: AMAZON, AMAZON, AMAZONMacy's is loaded with real estate & retail presence.... Just what AMAZON WANTS"
Does this stock ever go up anymore? And if this company is doing so poorly why do they do still do the Macy's day parade and 4th of July extravaganzas?How do they have the money for these events?
M gains market share as Forever 21 files BK and closes stores in US.
"clothes sales very bad, but Macy's sales better than anyone, and M same stores sales up 0.75percent, that is incredible, but Macy's stock price incredible low, it's lower than anyone, Macy's dividend higher than anyone, so M is worth to buy, M will reach $45 , because clothes sales will rebound in 2h year,"
anyone know what the payout ratio currently is?
Macy’s CEO Jeff Jannette ;Sales were very strong on line as well as in the store ....it’s about time And to all the short...you should go to Macy’s and pick up some looking jel while it’s on sale because the burn is gonna hurt
Long
"How many people on here are using their dividend monies to shop at Macy's? That would be better than buying more shares, that is for sure."
"i can tell you that if you have shares and selling them for under 20$ you will regret it for sure . This is the most undervalued stock i have found. Typical turn around story. I am not adding up due to diversification reasons only . I have shares for more than a year and didnt sell, dont let the market scare you, hardest times are over."
"After the country is open, there will a lot of people getting out to shop. Probably tired of sitting in front of their computers. That too will be temporary. Once people get back to work, they will fall into their usual rut, while watching to see the Covid-19 numbers rise/fall."
BUY BUY BUY!!!
Macy‘s is making progress (creating additional value):https://finance.yahoo.com/news/argent-retail-advisors-lands-9-044500235.html
"Bill?Robert?Nomansky?Oh, sorry, you'all must be busy covering your positions.I'm sure we will hear from you again after the price goes above $7 AGAIN within a week."
$9+ tomorrow. All aboard!
Macy‘s will close green today! This Thursday preliminary Q1-sales as well as CEO in firesidechat with JP Morgan! Giddy-up giddy-up! Big news coming up! Whatever it takes..........
Anyone going to hold shares through earnings?
"The $20+ book value seems to me a nice anchor, lets hope for better execution going forward."
"I bought JCP in 2012, when the CEO Ullman gave the great lie that JCP didn't need a loan and later that day he got a $300 million loan from Goldman Sachs. Real estate was put in GS name as collateral and two GS guys were put on the JCP board. Selling bonds in a low interest environment is a good idea. JCP had 1150 stores at the time to M 775 now. Like Warren Buffet stated about JCP, there's a lot of levers they can pull to survive. At almost $15 a share M is priced to thrive. Add no dividend and I ask myself why is M $15. I know a Hungarian investor bought a million shares of M at $4.50 per share in April 2020. Looks like he knew what he was doing."
Short positions will reduce dramatically after today. Worst is over.
M
"clothes stores closed 1by1,it maybe good news for m, so buy Macy's can make a lot of money,clothes sales very bad this year,it's not Amazon,I think it will be strong rebound in this October quarter,"
Looks like a sector rotation is beginning out of tech and into value plays including retail. Macy’s will benefit. 16’s tomorrow. The recent $500 million in unsecured notes at 5.875% is a smart move by management and will pay dividends down the road.
Along with Saks being in trouble now Nordstrom debt cut to junk. Macy’s moat building in the retail space
"I would like some thoughts here. Is the big jump today due to short covering as this has been inching up the past week ? And the shorts are in panic mode, Or is there a real reason this has gone up so much?"
up $3 per share/ 10k shares wait patiently and be rewarded :)
"Just in: Google will acquire a small stake in Macy's, and there will be a Google Store in every Macy's!"
"WOW talk about real Street signs , M retiring 450 million in debt is a screaming street sign that M is having a VERY good Holiday season or they would not be retiring all the debt early . Makes M a screaming buy because thing have to be going even better than M was thinking and WOW they must be having MASSIVE CASH flow also which means LOTS and LOTs of sales ."
Let me get this straight here. Macy's delays earning report 1st quarter for good 2 months due to corona virus and share price goes up. Interesting.
Consumer confidence through thru the roof this morning. Selling M here is a losing bet imo. Buy.
Macy's is still a online business 10th in the nation before this pandemic. I believe that they will survive...
"''1:36:09 $ 6.53 44,180'' look at the numbers of share being bought.. not the every day trader.. ;-)"
TARIFFS will hurt stock price and expect a new low = this week or next
Updated full year forecast EXTREMELY strong. Upgrades coming. They're baaaaack.
"Macy’s is holding its positive strength convincingly in a generally down market day. If the market opens positively tomorrow, then the stock will continue to creep upward."
"$15 is a low number for what's coming next. As we get closer to holiday season and vaccine is now within grasp, more and more sudden upward moves are inevitable. Surviving department stores are holding onto larger share of this segment. All the bashers can go buy their pants from Amazon. Amazon will be happy to accept the returns in exchange for their prime membership."
M was mentioned on CNBC as top insider buyer lately!! Go Macy ;)
"Yesterday +6,11%, today -2,98%, next week big spikey-spikey coming........ whatever it takes......... double-digits coming again this year........... give it a few weeks/months and check back soon............"
Congrats Longs!!!!!!
"I see M was up in a down market yesterday the 30th of December. I bet it was because all the tax loss selling is over, as trades take 2-3 days to settle and that puts it into 2020. I bet we're at $18.50 ish as of 10 January 2020. Looking forward to my $3200 dividend payment in a few days. Hope shorty is paying for it, although who would short a high dividend stock like M?"
I went to my local mall for kid pics with Santa. Came in thru Macy’s. It was crowded and more important the lines at the cash registers were packed.
Macy’s standing strong when so many retailers have gone belly up.Gotta be worth $10.
"Glad I did not listen to all the ""experts"" here explaining why Macy's would reach $ 30 very soon. I got out with a small profit but a profit nevertheless. I don't know why this stock can't go up. For whatever reason it just can't. Until it can be figure out I will stay away."
"And there is the news I was looking for! Macy's, Inc. Raises Approximately $4.5 Billion in Financing"
what's happening? 5% down?
"has anyone noticed that JCP is down only 71% and M is down about 64% from its 52 week high around 41.99? that's almost the same % drop yet Macy's makes about 800-900M a year, pays a hefty dividend, has about the same long term debt as jcp (when u factor in cash on hand), has invested billions in cap ex within last 3 years, has comparable store growth (jcp is -5% each and every quarter btw). M also has way more valuable real estate plus does about 25B in revenue a year vs 12B from JCP... yet mr market thinks all is equal with the two. go figure."
compared to JWN... M should be 17 now.
No way it will end up down today. Once market opens bulls will pile on this stock. Saving $1.5 billion per year due to cost cuts. Trying to match expenses vs sales. Solid company
"$10 soon. Retail Sales are booming faster than expected, especially Clothing up 188%! Let's go long Macy's! #LGM"
M reached a new 52 Week High at 36.36
My new favorite Friday tradition!CC: Nomansky and Eric THE FRAUD
"Macy’s said it has been “fast-tracking digital initiatives and partnerships to quickly meet increased customer demand for online shopping and flexible payments options.”Load up on the stock before the next earnings report. Macy's is going online on a very large scale to become Macy's to the world not just to walk in shoppers. Their next earnings report is going to blow this stock up and the shorts will be the afterburner that fuels even higher prices. tThey are short 40% of the stock and will have to cover by buying shares from people who consider the stock undervalued and do not want to sell.

"Guys, m up 6% on heavy volume (8M shares traded in the first 40 minutes into the trading day). Someone accumulating shares at these fire sale prices…thoughts anyone??        "
Labour day tomorrow.... let people back to work and reopen the economy... Macy‘s reopens beginning next monday... huge marketing campaign coming... every third share is sold short... lets start an epic short-squeeze.... whatever it takes...
Anybody know when M reports Q1?
"I heard recently an analyst saying brick and mortar stores will soon cease to exist and that all sales are going ONLINE and that stores like Macys have no mote protecting their business.Wrong! Absolutely Wrong! You know why they say that, it is because they heavily own Amazon and other ONLINE retailers. Fact is that 75% of all clothing sales are at brick and mortar stores such as Macys. The latest government sales figures showed a massive drop in clothing sales corresponding to the time Macys and other retailers were forced to close their stores. Clearly what the consumer did was to say, well Macys is closed, so I will delay clothing sales until they reopen.So Amazon, Walmart or Target did not get those sales. The consumer merely delayed and stopped purchasing clothing during that time. Fact is 75% of clothing sales are at brick and mortar stores and these consumers WILL NOT BUY CLOTHES ONLINE! This is true mote protecting sales at Macys because the consumer will not buy ONLINE!This a mote, which Amazon cannot overcome unless it were to purchase a huge department store chain like Macys!It is the only way as online sales of clothing will never exceed 25 percent annually.Thus I fully expect a V shaped recovery in sales to Macys and Kohls. As the CEO of Macys said, he sees $10 billion is sales additionally up for grabs because of the massive bankruptcies in the USA of retailers like JCPENNY, Neiman Marcus, JCCREW etc.Macys and Kohls will benefit and be more profitable and stronger after all this nonsense subsides.I see huge gains in the stock prices going forward!"
even jwn went up 4 bucks come on Macy's rip above 4.00 tomorrow
"How about Reporting the ""Hard-Fact"" that Macy's Lost Book-Value. ""The company ended the quarter with about $7 billion in combined short- and long-term debt compared to a mere $2.7 billion in shareholders’ equity."" https://finance.yahoo.com/news/macys-wont-survive-a-second-wave-of-covid-19-top-strategist-165317077.html"
"I've been following this board for some time now. IMO It's important to take into account the following:-Book value is at around $20 per share-Book value does not take into account the actual market value of Macy's properties rather their book value, including depreciation and amortization. I wonder what the book value of Herald Square is if they bought that property 100 years ago??? Maybe $25,000 that is twenty five thousand dollars?? Hmm-Macy's has a credit card business worth billions to any bank out there that specializes in credit cards (Capital One, Barclays USA, among others)IMO Macy's will either be taken over by a hedge fund/private equity and sold by the slice...like a NY pizza, or it will continue as a going concern for another 100 years.Either way the stock has only one place to go...UP and that is without considering that this thing has a 45% short interest which is nuts. A short squeeze is very likely with that short interest, maybe as soon as this week..."
"The problem is... the shorts looked at Macy like a wounded deer, and the coyotes that they are... thought they had themselves an easy meal shorting shares. Well the predator turned prey and longs are feasting today."
$7.00 coming
"Not sure if anyone else noticed but the stores were packed out on Cyber Monday, probably why the Adobe Analytics were off on their projections. My wife was complaining about how crowded the mall was near the house and sure enough when I came home yesterday after work, the road that leads by it was as crowded as I have ever seen it. Not sure if foot traffic is equaling sales for the brick and mortar, but it looks as if face to face sales are still doing very well. Of course we all know that other than mom and pop stores, omni-channel sales are critical, without an on-line presence no major retailer will survive, it appears that Macy's is doing a decent job of creating that presence. Should be an interesting Christmas season for all."
"Close the coffin lid MACYS is history. It is in the same league as Sears, KMART and Penneys. Even if the pandemic eases they are broke and fewer than half the stores will ever reopen. The historic Thanksgiving parade is going to be canceled and they cannot afford it anyway. New movie: The Nightmare on 34th Street""."
I bought M a few days ago...been watching for a bottom and i think it may be in....lots of upside in my view...very undervalued..this a great asset play.

$M Target Raised by Telsey Advisory Group Market Perform USD 10 » USD 14
I hear Macy’s will reinstate dividend if things normalize in a month from now.
Macy’s is fifth largest online retailer. Has incredible real estate assets. Can fund an above average dividend and Blue Mercury is growing. The top 20% performing stores are all cap ex positive. Bloated management structure has been reduced as well. Seems like a buy at these levels.
"With so many retailers going out of business, only some big and established names like Walmart, Target and Macy’s will survive and will infact benefit from the competition shutting down. Macy’s just has to reinvent itself a little with changing consumer behavior."
I picked up 500 shares at $20.03. Good price for a decent company that pays a great dive.
finally broke the $12 
Buy the dip! Back up over $7 next week
"What do you say fellas? Just look at the ""finance statement"" and buy buy buy? One can argue that all retail is down so no big deal Macy's is down too but I ask the rhetorical question again - how many of you shop at Macy's for real? Good luck!"
"In 1993, Goldman Sachs downgraded Dell Computer Corp to sell. The stock dropped 10% to $13.20. I sold the entire 9,000 shares. Dell went on to effect 8 (2 for1) stock splits and became the fastest growth stick in all of market history. In the next 4 years, Dell did those 8 stock splits. That analyst at Goldman was dead wrong. And he cost me $54 million. I sold /- biggest mistake ever"
"This is a great long term investment, not a trade."
"So much for the panic selling this morning. Whoever sold their shares at the low point this morning should just exit and put their hard-earn money in the bank, CD or bonds. You will preserve your capital but inflation will slowly eat it away (while all of the countries keep on printing more and more new money). For those who hold tight - great job!"
Anyone know What is responsible for all the good price action in Macy’s today?￼￼
Macys outpacing the SPY....see y'all at 25 ( while earning an easy 10% divvy ) ;)
Will Macy’s maintain $1.51 dividend for 2018?
"Amazon buy Macy's better than buy target, because amzn don't have high ranking retailers, if Amazon buy Macy's, amzn can reach $2000 per share, if Amazon don't buy Macy's, amzn will fall to $1200 per share,because amzn sales is not enough to support amzn."
Debating buying in today?
"This stock is shorted since a while, not new..But today the trend is up, many competitors gave up, good management and market recovery..It should goes down again a bit in few months, but not now.."
"Macys better wake up to realty. Brick and Mortar outdated.If they refuse to evolve, Herald Square will be converted to Multimillion dollars Condos"
A good stock to trade.
"I'm not bullish, but I do like to point out hypocrisy from analysts rating Macy's. As Goldman Sachs downgraded M last quarter, they increased their holding by 92%, adding 5.99M shares."
 Curiosity begs me to ask this:DID THIS CLOSE ABOVE $8 Today pumpers? bwa wa wa bawa wa wa 
"investors still fear Amazon, but gasoline prices went up showing people go out more, so Amazon sales growth maybe end soon, it looks as same as last spring, gasoline prices went up, people go out more, Macy's sales go up too, plus Fed won't rise rate, people income can keeping continues growth, so Macy's sales growth will very strong in 2h 2019"
I compare apples-to-apples. The vast majority of the retail industry is down 5-6% If Macy's were the only one I'd be worried.
Chris Sain set us up wel
Anyone notice last week's dip was on very low volume way under the average yet this weeks pop is at or above average volume? That is definitely bullish!

"And it will be back at 25 by next Monday, this is being gamed, they dump it, they drive it up. So if you buy now you get a quick buck and sell. The markets are so manipulated now it isn't even funny. If the SEC really wants to do their job they need to ask for assistance from the NSA to give them super computing capabilities and work on developing algorithms that can actually pin point collusion among large brokers. Until then, the markets will be gamed and the small investor will lose and eventually lose any confidence in the markets this will lead to more of a dichotomy in terms of the haves and the have nots. If the government really wants to provide fair and honest markets they need to up their game, yet most politicians gain from the game as much as the uber wealthy it is unlikely to happen."
WHAT A RALLY!!!! approaching HOD here.
"Macys is in for a V shaped recovery! Yes, some may want to take a dollar per share profit and run, but fact is this stock is going to double, triple and quadruple over a short time period.If you a happy with a measly profit sell, but best strategy is to hold and dollar average and the icing on the cake is when they restore the massive dividend too.Great long term investment for you tax free IRA."
Macy’s reported positive GAAP earnings of $0.50/share in Q4 2020. Don’t believe R’s lies a simple google search can verify this!!!
nice day today. Glad I bought yesterday!

"Has this story been posted?UPDATE 1-Macy's sees savings of up to $550 mln from targeted promotions, better pricingReuters ReutersSeptember 5, 2019(Adds details from retail conference, background)Sept 5 (Reuters) - Macy's Inc said on Thursday it aimed to save $400 million to $550 million annually in the next two to four years, as the department store chain cuts back on discounts, sending its shares up 5% in mid-day trading.The 160-year-old company, which has been spending heavily on remodeling its stores and building off-price and online businesses, has relied on discounting to clear inventory, a move that has hurt its earnings.Speaking at a retail conference hosted by Goldman Sachs, Chief Financial Officer Paula Price said some of the savings will be supported by better prices as the retailer moves towards targeted promotions for customers.""We know that some of our customers respond particularly well to coupons while others do not. And so using data and customer analytics, we can become more precise on who we target with promotions and what offers we provide,"" Price said.Macy's, the largest U.S. department store chain, has closed more than 100 stores and cut thousands of jobs as mall traffic falls amid a shift in customer preference to shop online.The company said it is also testing self checkout in stores and rolling out new modernized handheld devices for staff to improve efficiency.The retailer also said it expects to drive about $100 million in additional working capital improvements.Earlier this year, Macy's said it would cut 100 senior management positions to reduce costs and improve profitability.

Please move over to the sides Home Depot and Kohl’s; Target and Macy’s will demonstrate how to properly show up in the big dance soon.
"With Cramer's recent Macy's pump, the booming season and hire of 7000 temps, the rotation out of tech, the upcoming dividend payment, and the corp tax cut being lowered, the catalysts are now in place for a major reversal. We will easily see $30, and with any luck, we will return to $50 and beyond. I'd go long now guys."
LOL BTW ANY BEARISH BET IMO JUST A HEDGE.

Macy will go up Monday:1. Friday initially like entire retail sector M had a tendency to go up after good retail data2. M didn't go up when the market went up recently.3 The $6.17 gap is filled.4. Correction from recent high $9.55 to $6 is more than enough and is done.5. M has enough liquidity to pass through this tough time.6. Laying off people actually cut cost and Wall street likes that.7. 450 reopened store sales is better than expected.8. Amazon could buy M. Sector leader will normally win.9. CovID-19 vaccines are coming.10. Don't fight with Fed. Fed will fully support the economy and M will recover.
This is good
"At these prices you still have one more chance to buy near 52 week low and ride up a buck and a half before earnings. Dump before earnings and secure a nice 1.25 to 1.75 profit per share and not even have to worry about how they report, though do agree that it will bounce regards."
"I remember when people were saying how Best Buy was going to to bankrupt because Amazon was going to eat their lunch. What happened? People wanted to talk to the sales people, see the TV, laptops & other electronics up front and personal. Macy's is not going to go the way of JCP.

"Price is at pre-covid level, there's no dividend, more debt and an uncertain economic future. I don't think we'll go much higher, despite being long for the long term."
"I love the new Zack's article rating M a #2 BUY. I wonder how much money they made publishing the article for the MM's? This will be the first Quarter where M pays 5.825% on the half billion dollars of junk bonds they sold. No worries the sale of the Seattle Macys for $460 million ($404 million after commissions) will cover it and then some. Macys can kick the can down the road for many years, while Gennette makes his $10 to $12 million a year in salary and free shares he sells on the open market every 5 months. It's worth a goo gle."
"Nice volume, million shares in 5 minutes on those green candles. Need a big green candle on the weekly to have impact on technicals. Bollinger bands still very bearish, but to be expected with 20,50, and 200 DMAs so far away. Still waiting to make additional purchases. Buyer below $17. Seller at $25 and $32."

Total hit job downgrades. Right before earnings too like they have a crystal ball. If anything M has been showing strength this past holiday and short interest has declined. This downgrades just means institutions are getting ready to buy!
I expect Macys stock to do very well today as well as intermediate and long term.This is 4 bagger and for the patient investor a 6 bagger.
This is easily a $20 stock. I know it. Black Rock knows it. At these levels how could you not accumulate.
"We are forming the bottom around 5 USD now, now it is a time to get in."
Best short squeeze of any stock!Excellent up potential!
JCP cannot compare with Macy. Macy just reported great earning and announced new impressive dividend. Time to buy honestly!
Macy’s report better than expected we are off boys
GO GO GO finally
Here is the plan...( worked last qtr)....I buy the stock then immediately Buy PUTS to insure 100% of the investment...then collect my guaranteed 10% dividend....FOOLproof
Going to SOAR!!!!Take advantage.... buy pre-market
"Wow, you can buy 10 shares of this company for the price of one article of clothing in their store...puts it into perspective."

Will this go up again tomorrow as we have divided chasers?

Buy buy buy!!!

Wednesday will follow trend. Up we go!
"Never be the same, lights out, move along -- common posts on this board. Facts are, Macy's improved its online presence dramatically. Couple this with less mall competition, and a solid cash position, and you have the makings of a muti-bagger.

"Macy’s is Shifting with The TimesSurprising to many, Macy’s, one of America’s most iconic fashion brands, is making key strategic moves to remain competitive in the future retail model:• Sustainability: Macy’s has committed to reduce its energy consumption by 10% by 2025, and in one year alone lowered their greenhouse gas emissions by ~7%, or 84 million pounds of CO2. • New, Strong Board: Macy's has brought on a diverse board of global distribution, entertainment, real estate, health and wellness, and advertising titans to compete in the shift to online sales.• Increased Technology: The company has partnered with payment processor Klarna, to allow purchases to be split into manageable payments for customers, thereby lowering the barrier to entry for its customers, and potentially increasing its total addressable market size.• Shift to Direct to Consumer Model: Macy’s has leveraged the pandemic to strengthen its e- commerce model, partnering with companies like Doordash to provide same day delivery to luxury customers, as well as offering same day in-store pickup that combined have led to digital sales making up 54% of total sales in Q2.• Entry into $24B Used Clothing Industry: Macy’s has partnered with millennial brand ThredUp to offer pre-owned clothing, a move that has brought in new customers and acts as its greatest differentiator from other large retail brands. Following in the footsteps of Levi’s and Patagonia, Macy’s demonstrated commitment to sustainability has the additional benefit of acting as a buffer to potential future disruptions to its value chain.• Potential Acquisition by Amazon: Sources have spec"
Big money firms now rotating from the stay at home stocks to retail and other beaten down sectors...
So they expect sales to grow a measly 2% but the e-commerce over 20%?
I bought at 7 now I'm green.

-.25-.30 on a even market day when it actaully was even at 7.15 so it should be more....whassa gonna happen tomorrow when it goes red in the aftanoon?
$1 soon. JC Penney will file for chapter 11 then this stock will drop accordingly. retail and hospitality biz now is like banks in 2008 think about it. the worst is yet to come.
Macy’s locked in financing for next 2 years. Macy’s is here to stay. It’s no JCpenny or Sears. Has still money to spare for fireworks and thanksgiving parade. Best retailer out there.
looks like its breaking some resistance
I'm in 2K shares at 6.50.....Macy's will survive for sure...please don't scare me.
Dear Santa—All I want for Christmas is for M to continue it’s upward trajectory and to “crush” the spirit of all the negative “short” investors until they are completely “squeezed” out of their losing bets- which will drive M even higher!!! —- thanks Santa!!!
+$40.00 in a few months! Mark this post! This stock will TRIPLE in a few months!

"Does the Amazon numbers really surprise anyone?1) Even the retail numbers last month stated that on-line sales fell for the first time -- EVER.2) Brick and mortar retailers are becoming vastly better at on-line themselves.3) AWS part of Amazon business model which is their only profit center is coming under furious competition from Microsoft, IBM, Oracle, even Google is going heavily into cloud storage/computing. Within two years, AWS will no longer be the leader and Amazon will no longer be able to unfairly supplement their failing retail model with the cloud computing business.All these points combined this quarter to show the general weakness in the Amazon business model, then you still have Bezos chasing after the delivery business, wow, in a trucking and transportation sector which already has a major glut in it. Simple suicide."
"Even with China doing trade deal or negotiating, this stock is telling us somethings wrong! 1. Divvy cut?2. Management change?Actually surprised Carl Icahn hasn’t gotten into M and then force changeIs M a viable business 10 years out in its current format?"
"I do think more of the US has learned how to order online, and that's not good news for the shopping malls. Macy's needs to invest in online and in bricks-and-clicks like Bonobo's, and stop wasting a billion-dollar asset - Herald Square - on running a money-losing store. Emotional love for the building and its ""Flagship"" status is understandable, but it should be a firing offense! You can mount the Edison plaque in the lobby of the new office building there."
Macy's has paid off nearly 2.3B of debt since early 2017. That debt reduction is worth roughly $7.50 per share. Clearly M will end Q4 about 1% above last year so we can expect M will have an additional $700M+ (q4 asset sale not included) to pay down even more debt
"4th tranche tariff worries to earnings are overplayed. M simply passes along these particular tariffs to customers as it works to erase Chins from their supply chain. There competition is in the same boat, maybe even worse."
X Dividend March 14 will we see a up tick in stock price 6.34 percent
Macy's will likely survive and the stock is probably 4 bagger from here minimum
Big mistake why I did not load up on M yesterday coz this could hit $21 on Monday - stimulus bill is approved - Macy’s will have unlimited growth this year
"i'm not here to blow smoke up anyones butt, like you ALL DO..And i'm talking about the pro M people OR the shortys who love to buy/sell/short , then ""repeat""...(lowlifes to be honest). I'm not saying Macy's is going to 25 dollars in a month or two, and anyone who says that is a liar. What i AM saying, is that my partner works at Macys for 25 years now, and tells me daily its ""more"" busy AND more sales are made on an average day than pre-covid....Buy, sell, or short as you wish...I only have a few hundred shares of this stock, just giving you my ""honest"" opinion....No reason this stock cant be or shouldnt be at least ""half"" of its precovid value is what i'm saying."
"Great day for stocks, especially Macy's. Up 4.5% on 16 million volume. Looks like $25 may happen this week. The economy is strong, the markets are strong, and people are spending money at high levels.Shorts are going to get clipped with huge loses."

Macy's is the only department store that will survive!!! mark my words will be $10+ by the end of the week!! get it now while it's still cheap! my brother works in head office and they have some very exciting news coming out late this week!! mark my words over $10!!! come back next week and thank me
If kohls is 7 billion market cap i cant see why Macy's cant

"I don't know what everyone is so worried about. Trump is doing great. 16K manufacturing jobs vs. 5K expected, GDP, low unemployment and taking it to China. These fools will not give the president credit for anything except when the market corrects. He is to blame for the ""crash""; however, the multiple ATH's he gets no credit for. I remember in Q1 where everybody was trying to poke holes in the beautiful GDP and job reports; I noticed this time when that job report came out they didn't have much to say. M shareholders should be more concerned about their CEO than Trump. At least Trump is winning. These little twitter induced corrections are basically meaningless noise over the long-term. What isn't are the problems M was having before all the tweets."

I am not selling at all. Sooner or later this stock will rebound.
"Never short on this potential growth stock, $25-$30 next week  Where are all the shorts at ?"
Hard to understand still being short on M. Heading into stimulus and an extended holiday season as an undervalued company is a nice place to be.
"Macy's has called in Lazard bankers who specialize in finding ways to recapitalize financially troubled companies and rework debts, the sources said. Macy's has also enlisted debt restructuring lawyers at Kirkland & Ellis LLP, two of the sources said. Refinancing the loans will save a ton of money in the long run! Macy's with Google helping them with internet sales that just started, this restructuring is all good!"
Still at least 50% undervalued at $12. Macy's will break $20 in no time and reinstate dividends! Hang in there and Merry Christmas

"Time to get some shares on M , Why because everyone one hates it and they still make a ton of money plus it pays you over 10%. Never follow the herd , Lead the herd."
"Here is the proper way to think about this stock. First and foremost, ask yourself whether this company will survive or not. To answer this, do your own homework, look at retail data, look at what markets Macy's serves, look at their balance sheet, online sales, debt, access to cash and so on. Also, in addition to your own homework, find out what reputable analysts are saying about Macy's. If you're truly convinced death of Macy's is on the horizon, the short the stock and shut up about it. If you're convinced that Macy's online sales are growing, that Macy's serves a much needed market between fancy boutiques and Target quality, which I believe, and that Macy's will survive, then buy as much as you can, either shares or very long term contracts, and then ignore all negativity about this stock. Remember, companies do not go bankrupt because their stock is low. Just consider Sunpower. A few months ago, they hit 3 dollars. Now, it's trading above 17! It is only a matter of time before Macy's will pull through this rut, and believe you me, it takes just a few steps to jump from 6ish to 8 to 10, then it will be matter time before it goes back to upper teens and before you know it, in 20s. I believe Macy's will survive and I am long. GLTA."
"Has anyone ever heard of the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade? Just wondering. It's gonna be an extra special one this year for its' investors. Parade starts early this year, Nov 21, 7AM so I hear. One car parade to the moon!"
today is the last day for you to buy in order to get 5% diviend . That's why shares are up
Will wait for 15.60 and buy puts again.
Going green any minute now! Numbers better than expected! Macy‘s will survive. Financing on track. Reopenings on track. Fireside-chat with JP Morgan today. PR. Go Macy‘s go!!!
"If ER is good next week, this will be back to above $20 in no time.Get ready for a major short squeeze!~~"
The breakup is coming
Macy's real estate alone is worth $16 Billion...Can anyone explain the $7 Billion Market Cap?
I wish I was allowed to buy those 5 year senior notes paying 8.375%
"Up, Up and away we go back to the 20s and then 30s."
"I loved the reimaging PR by CEO Gennette. In a nutshell he states that what M is doing is now failing so they're shifting to online and digital. I owned M from 2017 to 2020 for the dividend, which was over 10% at times. My girlfriend works at the local newspaper and I've heard her say they're going digital 1000 times. Her bosses say that's where the money is. Old people read newspapers and young people go online (digital) and read. if at all. I can't see digital is the answer for M or online. Amazon and Wal-Mart are years and millions ahead. Although the previous M CEO was ahead of his time with store closings and investing in online sales. What should M's foot print be in five years? 500 or 600 stores? Is stand alone smaller stores the answer? I don't think so. JCP sold real estate to stay afloat and sold bonds for years. In 2012 I bought JCP and by 2013 I knew they'd be bankrupt. I'm not sure about M but with $28,000,000 in quarterly interest paid on the debt I know the can, can only be kicked down the road for so many years."
"Wooo, can’t believe it’s going up today."
pretty much a lottery ticket at this point. same with the cruise lines.
+10% and underway for a classic short-squeeze:-) Macy‘s WILL survive. A third (!) of all shares shorted. All hell breaks lose when this ascent continious! Let‘s go for a hefty short-squeeze! This stock has artificially been kept down long enough. Now we‘ll exagerate to the upside!
"worst retail stock of 2018, doubt it will rebound"
"Up in ex dividend date means ""strong buy""."
BOOM
It’s sitting up nicely for a short squezzz ..
"7.14, 7.17, 7.21 need to be broken for continuation upward. Let’s close 7.17 and break this wall."
"OVERSOLD and UNDERVALUED, imo. It should bounce back fast to at least $28's short term. Also, Likely filling the gap. Do not sell your shares Cheapo."
Ok i sold. so that should be the bottom -- for today. essentially there's no bottom now until the shorts run out of money which might be days away.
Macy 20-25 by Friday 3/26/21
I would buy at low to maximum of dividend pay. Why pay high for lower dividend? It doesn’t make sense
"Only a DEM wit would think people after being lock down would be going to Macy's , LOL,LOL there are miillions of other places people will want to go to before any one was thinking Macys' they can go any where they want and still shop on Amazon or Walmart at the same time LOL,LOL,LOL Eric the DEM wit without a brain is going to cause you to lose all your money"
"Macy‘s with better than expected numbers. Will survive. Financing on track. Reopenings in track. Bottom is in. Macy‘s back to double-digits......... whatever it takes......... and don‘t forget the short-squeeze.........,"
"M to exceed 3Q earnings estimate on property sales.Out of necessity and following business plans, Forbes.Hurrah!"
"Wow.. I fell asleep on my keyboard.. wake up, 6.40 :D i feel maybe wait a bit let it bleed a little and buy some more shares. What level are you guys buying/covering?"
Based on the free cash flow yield for that quarter we are trading at roughly a 15 multiple for that quarter’s free cash flow ALONE! I estimate with a full years’ worth of free cash flow the P/FCF will be 3-4. Most of M’s free cash flow comes in during the fourth quarter during the holiday season. The long term market average is roughly 15 and currently the market is trading far above historic averages. Short % of float is 18%. Lots of opportunity here. Once shorts lose control this can go up fast!
when is the ex dividend date?
"Seriously,every forum will have haters...the only thing that matters is DID YOU MAKE A PROFIT? Who cares about negative remarks..people entitles to their opinions...haters gonna hate anyway.. My 15K shares of M averaging $6.53 will justify my point.If I even listened to 1% of these negative post,I wouldnt be at where i am now.Just TRUST yourself...if everyone is that good at PREDICTING,there wont be poor people and there wont be haters in here"
"Nice volume for first hour, taking shares cheap before rebound and rebirth!"
Down againPeople must believe that Macy's is going to cut the dividendWhy don't they sell marginal stores and pay down debt and buy back some stock?
Nomansky is not going to be happy next week.
"people have money, will spend, I expect higher yr/yr sales"
I hope all true longs are accumulating at these levels. Good day longs.
So here is what I don’t like...buying back debt at 4% - 6% while paying 10% dividend. It’s simple math to buy the stock and let the debt ride.
"25% gain within few weeks, should be enough for any sane investor to say I am out.You stay in, after 2 weeks this thing is back to 10-11. It is just a common sense. Macy's has been going down since summer of 2018, nothing is changed, but got worse due to Covid. JC Penny pulled the plug and Amazon is getting bigger."
Why didn't Macy's give an update on Christmas sales in early January? Seems strange to stop doing that if you had a great Christmas?
Why is Macy's popping today? Short squeeze? Is M the next GameStop? Or is there some big news I'm not realizing?
Stay focused. Less department store competition plus big strides made online equal huge run. Buy.
"The board has arrows in its quiver, like firing Gennette. Nobrainer imo."
Cheap still. How much is Herald Square worth? Raising pt to $45!
"Well I might consider buying Macy’s if it pops to $7.25 today. It’s looking very interesting went two two stores yesterday and they where pretty full. Not like before but much better than closed. Also the fact that hedge funds and institutional investors are buying is a good thing. Macy’s has plenty of liquidity and will be a surviving retailer. I say $15 by December 31, 2020."
happy fathers day on June 21. Expect a lot of parents with their children will go to Macy. expect the stock will go up to 35 in two weeks time.
Soon will trade double digit stock prices! A word to the wise!
"Hey, start paying a dividend to the common shareholder atgain."
the excitement over Macys some how is gonethere is no juice left it seems
JWN earnings further prove that Macy's is outperforming its peers. Unfortunately it'll probably drag us down tomorrow.
Today's Call Option volume is insane!
How you all feeling about tomorrow earnings? Do you all think Macy did good in the last quarter?
"with Macy's earnings looking on July 1st I wouldnt expect to much of a pullback if any....should move up headed into earnings as stores opening back up, company already stated foot traffic at 50% of precovid.....I'm seeing $14 written all over this stock in a month."
strong buy
"Look like people are coming back to their senses finally. Thank you for whoever sold me my new shares at $11.025. Ex-Dividend date is March 12, so still time to purchase to get it. GLTA M Investors"
We will focus on debt and net income.
"Macys has begun a long, very prosperous upward trend.While outrageously insanely overvalued tech stocks began a very long term downward plunge.post covid environment on horizon"
Macy's short seller.......sorry for you guys....Macy's will go back up to $30 soon....
"Recap of yesterdays numbers: Macy‘s will survive; financing backed by real estate on track, reopening of all 775 stores/malls on track (270 already open this Memorial Day weekend); every third share sold short => Hefty short-squeeze potential. Everything negative already baked in, bottom in, uptrend to establish; back to normal, back to double-digits, dividends reinstated after covid is over; American icon ready for big spikey-spikey............ whatever it takes (i‘ll prove you this year........... whatever it takes..........."
stimulus = more retail spending!
"Macy is to survive, longs patient will be rewarded"
Macy's boosts annual earnings forecast
"lmao, Dillards missed and look at it, only down 3% right now. Management didn't even comment, omg. Last time I was in Dillards it looked like JCP. Total ghost town. My local Macy's are doing better than Dillards, hilarious."
"some analysts said: Fed will stop shrinking it's balance sheet, and some analysts said Fed won't rise rate in this year and next year, because next year is electing year, so Fed will not rise rate in 2years, so American people income can keeping continues growth, so M can continue rise to history high, so it's time to buy high ranking retailers, Macy's is #1,all high ranking retailers stock price too low, don't miss it. Macy's strategy is very good: Bloomingdale sell highest ranking things, Macy's sell high ranking things, backstage sell middle ranking things, I think Macy's sales have 100% growth in 4years, in 2004-2007,American people wearing over $400 clothes anywhere, so Macy's sales reach $40bln one year have no any problem if Fed won't rise rate,"
"KSS CEO said in March they were cancelling the dividend and stock buyback because of the covid crisis causing all their stores to be forced closed to conserve cash, but she promised to restore the dividend after the covid crisis ends and sales and earnings restored to normal. Yesterday she kept her word and announced KSS dividend will be reinstated in first quarter of 2021 as sales, earnings return to normal.Macys did the same thing! You can count on it that the dividend will be restored to Macys stock holders after this covid crisis is over."
Good dividend is gone. Now the stock will see a bump up to at least $8 on Monday.
"Discount retailers Burl, tjx, burl, wmt, tgt, all up today all department stores down so the trend continues.."
"I guess those 40,000 call 12 strike contracts for Dec 31 bought yesterday someone knew an upgrade was coming."
I had previously determined I will not hold through earnings after I was devasted with TAP earnings. I am stuck with TAP for a very long time. With that being said does anyone feel tomorrow the shorts will win? thanks
Can someone explain why M is going to continue going up?
This stock will move sideways until the earnings announcement later this month.
Until this goes over 25 and sees a 2-3 percent up day that holds shorts own this name.
I’m sorry but no one is taking their 600$ to Macy’s. They’re paying bills and staying afloat.
Maybe Google and Macy's will begin a strategic partnership. I think the new board member can bring a lot to the table...
Another Stimulus brewing.....20 is near
will be 42 soon wait and watch
I think Macys is one of the top 10 ecommerce in the USA.
12 after earnings
Brokers are lifting restrictions on volatile stocks and options. You guys shorts will suffer here
"How un-professional of the analyst for Morgan Stanley.The report by that analyst was nothing more than a re-hash of the trash.The sales trends are definitely supporting brick and mortar and mall traffic.Numerous reports, recently, support retailers sales growth, contrary to the Morgan Stanley analyst.Be wary of of anyone who sells short the retail business.I believe the upcoming quarterly report on May 16th will again support the upward trend of retail sales and the strengthening of mall and brick and mortar businesses."
"I was in Macy's in NJ Saturday, I could not believe how busy it was. Seemed like alot of young people too. Under 40 with kids and teens and 20 year olds. pretty amazing how much people love to shop"
yep making good money now boys
"Where is the Energy?Tesla made a big deal of moving battery pack production to the Gigafactory, but there is almost no discussion of utility scale storage systems in the quarterly letter. In the financials, they don't even have a separate line item. It is just 'Services and Other' and it's a miniscule $88M (down from $121M the prior quarter)I get that the business will take time to ramp up, but I'd still like to see it broken out. How many KWH and $M worth of storage did they deliver in Q2?The silence on stationary storage was pretty deafening...."
Hey there sales101 thanks for the shout-out let me ask you this. What are you going to do when a strong retail report comes out?
This low stock price was a “gift” for those smart enough to see it.I already made 13k from the move from the upper 6’s to current price.... expecting to make $50-80k by nov... YOU GOT TO LOVE THE STOCK MARKET!!!
Well whole market down and M followed it down. Dow was down 600+ and M hit 16.63. Who knows why market dropped like it did but way over done so it's just a big clean up day.I bought more at 16.77 and now will ride back up to 18 again. I think once earnings come out it pops up to 20 plus on good news. dow has come back 150 points and slowly going backup. I wish I had more money because today is a buy day
"Looks to me like M's fall program may get some comments and upgrades from Analysts as it seems they are putting things together in an impressive manner. A few buy recommendations could really help sentiment and get M back to more reasonable valuations. A 5 PE is just too low for this stock. The high dividend yield is not going to last, but that will not changed because they lower or discontinue the dividend. Rather, the yield will decline because the PPS will incline!! Please do your own research and due diligence and don't rely on what you read on a chat board."
The worst stock I have ever owned. Thinking of taking a loss and moving on.
"M is a long term hold that will continue paying dividends and is not for shorts and day traders. Reducing underperforming stores is just fine. As long as there are earnings to pay the dividend, we dont need growth. There is no growth in retail as it had peaked years ago. Just pick companies with well maintained balance sheets like M or KSS and collect the dividend. Macys is an iconic brand that will not die and could be bought up at todays stock price. Visit the store in Herald Square Manhattan and you will see why."
I have this personal rule of buying heavily into stocks with a Price/Sales ratio of 0.3.
"A few retail stocks are done today...Amazon down $22, Walmart down, etc...its not just Macy's. It's clearly the market."
If M can't hold $25.40 we will probably see $24.
"Long live Shorts!! Without you all,M wouldnt have raised to this level in just a few days!!! Grabbed another 2K @ $10.68 earlier..Xmas came early!!!"
"At the end of 2021,M will be $40,only 1 reason,paychecks are going higher."
I changed my mind on Macy’sStrong Buy on Macy’s taking over business from JC Penny and many other weak retailersMacy’s will be #1 with $80 price target
"I haven't heard the argument of: when Macys took a clothing line out of its stores of a certain former president, his supporters quit M. The Kanye West, Gap article reminded me of the outrage in 2016. His clothing line was made in china."
"So is this down 10% today because of Kohl's or is the earnings report already out there. It doesn't make any sense to me that M is down so much off of the report from Kohl's because that has already hit M last quarter (Which is why KSS is trading at a 11 PE and M at less than 5). Macy's would need to miss earnings, and miss huge, to justify this level of selling. Not quite cheap enough for me to want to accumulate more, but we will see what the week will bring."
Let‘s go by the short-squeeze-manual (script) - A third of all Macy‘s-shares are sold short:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_squeeze
I just went to Macy. I couldn't move. Too crowded. # Bullish
Online sales grew 54% YoY... watch out Bezos Macy’s is officially back!!!!!
Scam market. There is know reason for retail sector to go down when market is green . Pure manipulation to deceive bagholders.
"Congrads to all longs, don't give up your shares cheap folks. Remember last quarter it took about 10 trading days to see the real bump up in stock price. Play the long game!"
"Morgan Stanley isn't bullish on Macys:Macy’s • M-NYSE Underweight • Price $24.72 on Feb. 26 by Morgan Stanley Research Ongoing Ebit and Ebitda declines leave us wondering how Macy’s can create shareholder value in 2019 and beyond. Second-half weighted 2019 guidance is concerning, as one- and two-year comparisons strengthen in the second half. We lower our price target to $22, despite the current price, and stay Underweight in our overall assessment of the stock. We also lower our 2019 earnings estimate to $3.05 from $3.11.Macy’s core retail operating profit (total operating profit excluding credit-card revenue and asset-sale gains) shrank in 2018. Though it fell at a more moderate rate than its fall in prior years, we note that this decline occurred despite an excellent consumer-spending environment and Macy’s best comp sales result in four years.Based on our analysis and incorporating management guidance, we expect core retail operating profit to decline in 2019, as well."
"Just bought 20,000 shares. Looking forward to my $8k dividend next month!!!"
Almost out of margin But I Shorted 3k more shares now short 11k shares at cost of 15.34 I know this will tank Hard
And Macy's is off running!
A Biden win means tradewar has an end in sight. No tariffs is great for M. More certainty and more stimulus. All great for retail but most importantly covid could end quicker and things normalize.
"djia s&p and down are good news for high ranking retailers,because Fed won't rise rate, and maybe cut rate, so people income can continue going up, plus on line sales have been top-end should return some customers to retailers,and these customers will bring more people shopping real stores,so high ranking retailers M sales sure be strong growth,"
Evercore partners upgraded Macy's this morning June 4...can anyone find the link??
Glad to have bought more yesterday
"I'm patiently waiting until it gets back to $40 a share, and that's called buying high and selling low. And, it's the way a lot of you are thinking and stressing out over whether you should be buying a cheap (below book value) stock!"
"As Credit Suisse downgraded Macys last quarter, they add 450k shares"
Will no longer sell fur. That is nice and all but can they announce something that might make a difference to the shareprice.
Check out Value Line and its analysis on M. We can and will imo go much higher. Very good report. Holding tight. They also said that in two years M should be able to raise the dividend if they wish. Like I said I just crunch numbers.
"Martingale Asset Management L P Purchases Shares of 80,779 Macy’s Inc (NYSE:M) – Baseball Daily Newshttps://www.baseballdailydigest.com/news/2019/01/13/80779-shares-in-macys-inc-m-acquired-by-martingale-asset-management-l-p.html"
Wow! Look at that UP Volume! And it's only 20 minutes into the trading day!
And the CEO bought at 21. What did that tell you?
"Either show the CEO and management the door or they'll be closing the doors....why no one on here will call out this blatant mutiny is beyond me, everyone is happy with the CEO's ""great performance."""
Buy Buy Buy !!!
Physical retail space per customer in the USA is 3x a comparable density in Europe. M has too many stores. Discount and online retail is growing. Macy's second tier locations need to be sold and the real estate monetized. M got rid of about 100 stores before. They need to get rid of more
HUGE volume tomorrow...
Malls are dying ? Macy's making me rich since I massively bought 2 weeks ago
Macy‘s will rebound nicely from these levels...... buy early and be rewarded the most.......
Very high volume and holding up nicely. This stock will continue going up 10-15% every day this week and into next week. Hang on longs for the great ride up. 
Spx will try to gently touch 33M should follow16 Bruh
WHO IS RICHER THAN YESTERDAY LOL??????????
What you guys think for tomorrow ?
close some of the stores may get M tons of money..Stream the bottom line.
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/macy-apos-stock-could-triple-000500455.html
I guess it's a good time to sell. M ain't Dillard's
amzn confirmed not interested in M? lol. they can get the empty JCP stores for pennies on the dollar. Literally. pretty sure deals have already been made. google it!
"Department stores keep tinkering with something consumers don't want. T J Max is doing it Right, it's Worth more than the Entire Dept-Store-Sector. hehehe"
"I am not inclined to predict stock numbers while short sellers are manipulating pps, but a careful look at Macy's Columbus Day offerings convinces me they have a great internet program under way at excellent price points. I think sales and margins are going to improve nicely. Big negative surprise coming for the bears, IMHO. I think the dividend will be maintained."
"People don't watch the financial data anymore ,stocks move up everytime good news from vaccination"
"www.macysinc.com is going to rise and shine with reopening of all 775 stores/malls by mid June the latest. This Thursday we‘ll learn about preliminary sales in Q1, followed by CEO in fireside-chat with JP Morgan. Shorties better cover.......... just a friendly advice............ Macy‘s going to double-digits this fall........... whatever it takes............"
Does anyone else remember Nomansky lol?
Macys is having the parade this year
"RED?!!!! So weird!!!! With the good news, it should be green... so disappointed"
https://www.marketwatch.com/story/april-is-likely-to-be-the-cruelest-month-for-retailers-as-sales-slump-and-prices-tumble-2020-05-11
"10,000 shares returns $1250/no plus likely substantial stock appreciation for the next few years as M's cost saving, third party vendor, and other internet and phone app iniatives drive sales and margin growth. Looking like a value play that has a high probability of success. Great buying opportunity right now, IMHO."
23% dividend looks delicious
"The stock is trading like there's going to be a new surge in corona and a few more lockdowns, bringing Macy's into a Chapter 11. What are the odds?"
all these shorts are posting negative remarks!! I love it when they got hit in real life by M and now all they can do is cry!! I suggest go to the bank and start getting cash from your credit cards to cover your shorts!!! $12 M before December!!!
"Broad averages at new all time highs and TJX is up nicely, as one would expect. M has been named a ""bargain"" and, so far, it is one of the leading retail stocks today, following the broad market. Shorts are working hard to hold M's down, but they are swimming against the current. Will short sellers ever get tired of paying longs the M's dividend? Probably not until it gets back over $18, but some shorts will cover sooner, around $16.50, IMO. With the markets making all time highs, it is not exactly smart to be shorting stocks, LOL"
Just announced: Macy's closing it's landmark downtown Seattle location. After 90yrs in this space. I told you this thing was going down.
Mr. R is bankrupt. Sad to say.
"Did you see the short squeezes in TLRY, ACB and APRN? Macy's (M) will have similar short squeeze soon! Their market capitalization is under $2 Billion and they are seeking $5 Billion more debt. With so much stock shorted, this could go to moon!"
"Does anyone , living in USA has any insight about the traffic on Macy's stores? if they make it this is a 25+ stock"
Ah easy money :)
"Look at that Macy's only lost -$1.95 in Q4 WOW what a real P.O,S only a DEM witted DUMB dASS would have paid money for Macy's shares. All that money they got for the real estate is just going out to pay Management as they rob the shareholders before they file bankruptcy again"
Ask yourself .Think. When there's Blood in the Streets you Buy. Only Macy's and Nordstrom can quadruple.
"The ""Street"": ""Macy's Smashes Estimate....."""
A 1/3 drop in share price over a 20 cent haircut from $3 on the annual estimate? The company could easily make up the difference on how many billions in sales? Buy.
Shorts have left themselves open to UNLIMITED LOSSES!!
DIVIDEND PAID SINCE 2002 AND NO CUT IMO. PAYOUT RATIO UNDER 50%. MONEY IN THE BANK! M ALSO PAYING DOWN THEIR DEBT.
"Is this really good news? I mean I see what's going on in the AH, but will this continue tomorrow, I am long 9K shares, I certainly hope it continues tomorrow and the next few day until we reach....what $14?"
"TJ Max essentially sells the closed out or discontinued apparel of other defunct retailers but yet garners a whopping 22 PE and 65 Billion market cap for its zero branding or innovation. Macy with its profitability, fashion brand, digital sales, innovation and 6.1% dividend garners an 8 PE and 7 Billion market cap. Wow, isn’t Wall Street marvelous. Patience M investors, every dog has its day."
"macy will either beat or meet consensus, because the estimate is super2 low."
I’m fixing to load up on some more shares thank you Mr. Market !!!
"Macy's used its real estate value as collateral for their billions in loans last year. So for all of those who like to quote the value of Macy's real estate, if Macy's continues to see poor performance and can't pay the bills, it will be the banks that see the value of the real estate."
"Pretty clear the FED let the air out retail in December. Now on the sidelines, retail will reinflate. Update comes Tuesday morning. Buy."
Strategy Nomansky 
"Steve, no is going to buy HMNY or its previous shell company name from India HMIT. MoviePass is gone, gone forever, the value of the company is going to zero, Macy's needs to focus on their own problems right now, not try and save your investment."
"out now , gl longs"
I don't recall when I shopped at Macy's last time. I ordered something from Amazon yesterday.
I pray that Macy's continues to go down each so I can continue to buy more and more. Macy's is a long term stock. I say 2-3 yrs and this stock will be well over $50 with all the positive changes they are doing. I wouldn't be surprised of Macy's buys another company within the next few yrs with all the money they are sitting on. Just look at Bluemercury and how successful these stores are becoming. CEO Jeff knows exactly what he is doing. It just doesn't happen overnight. Strong Buy with Long term goal.
"One somewhat intangible 'loyalty' dynamic which seems to possibly not have been fully appreciated when experienced sales people are terminated is the effect of these terminations on the purchasing loyalty of long time repeat buying customers to their preferred store sales people. When the buying customers' preferred store sales people are no longer available to them, the customers' loyalty to the store may possibly also wane..."
Is it a good time to sell M now? Need smart advice from smart people please.
M is going to do fine.
summer is going to be hot and so will Macy's.Temp is on the rise for Macy's. Not to late to buy into this super sunrise.
I just bought 200 shares at this low price! There must be a sale going on at Macy's!
Gift
"Thumbs up for people who feel sorry for J, now that AEO is lower per share price than Macy's, oh so sad, too bad. I will vote right now to get things started."
the end of the beginning
"For all of you that tout the 9% dividend I wonder if you actually understand how a dividend payment works.Take for Example a stock trades at $50 and pays a $1 dividend.On the day that the stock goes ""Ex-Dividend"", absent any other change in price it would open at $49.It would also reflect zero change in price.The $ are better spent in a stock buyback, which increases the share price in the same way but creates long term, deferred, capital gains."
"Macy's is the next JC Penney. M has $3.8 BILLION in goodwill on the balance sheet, along with $488 M intangibles.Gee, that kinda puts a zinger on your 'net tangible assets' category ?Have fun paying off your $5.4 BILLION debt load."
"M is one of the worst managed retail companies !!!1. All they do is blow “dust” to the market with merchandise strategies that have no substance to their results ( women’s shopping initiative in limited stores, no fur, 35 store boutique concept etc ) C’mon !!!2. No significant change to merchandise strategy ( pet product, groceries, electronics ) try something other than more cheap,low avg selling price outlet product ( higher priced than their reg stuff )3. Major real estate strategy other than selling off parcels of owned properties 4. Try new PROMOTiOMAL strategies ( be more aggressive !!! 5. Present a restructuring plan that presents more value to shareholders ( REIT, spin off B, sublet strategy in over spaced stores )6. IMPROVE your private brand quality and look ( currently it’s horrifying) get a merchant7. Sell the company8. If Current CEO, who has all this prior expertise 30 years) isn’t getting it done than get someone who will actually perform !! 9.

wow ...hardly any buying at all....just melts down all day every day
"people spend money very open now, it's time to buy Macy's, Macy's laying off 57 tech workers are good news for Macy's, because people shopping in stores more than before, in kings plaza Brooklyn New York: too many people inside in weekend."
"buy under value stock could make huge money ,when AAPL fell to $95 per share, AAPL p/e =9, smart investors bought AAPL, made a lot of money now, Macy's and JCP stock price under value, buy them now, next year make a lot of money."

Explore options from Macy’s suppliers to create a new division like Amazon Essentials.This way they can stab their competition (AMZN) and finally get into proprietary garments2. Walmart online sales are increasing but most millennial still like AMZN much more. By buying Macy’s Walmart would now have access to Mall (Millenial Breeding Grounds) Stores. 3. Walmart’s current items are non aligned with Macy’s and Macy’s products will be upscaling for Walmart, but remember Walmart customers on average don’t find at Walmart upscale items. It would be a good fit.4. Imagine buying Walmart online and being able to pick up items same day at Macy’s locations. No need to worry about packages left outside your door or at apartment lobby. Same time giving AMZN a challenge with prime.5. Finally, lots of non Walmart regulars like myself who prefer malls because of location would end up going more often to Walmart. Lots of millennials need converting."
"Please bear in mind, tommorrow is the day when a lot of people will grab profit. Sell it today for god sake."
"Shareholders meeting goes well:-) Macy‘s going MUCH higher ladies and gentlemen! Short-squeeze getting traction day by day. All 775 stores/malls reopen by mid June the latest. Back to normal, back to double-digits! Go Macy‘s go!!!"
Well.. Zacks got it wrong again. Article dated 4-20-2020. 4 Stocks to buy Amid the coronavirus route. Macy's #1... Later that day Macy's announces they stop the dividend. Great job Zack's.
Maybe not today but this will break out above $8 soon
"JCP EARNINGS report very bad, that means people trend to shopping high ranking retailers(Macy's), this trend sure be continue, SO strong buy Macy's,Macy's stock can continue rise to history high."
I just wonder where are Macy’s short gone ? Well fried . They deserve it .
im still down over 30% and not selling like some wsb fomo kid LOL i just cant see this not going up when pandemic is over im waiting to average down cause i have no clue how much further its going to head down. the way i see it when i got 50% loss and i double my shares i think at that point there is nothing to short anymore. i only have 10 shares by the way
Macys store at my location is soaring with customer. Parking lot feels like thanksgiving time last year. Big crowd and lot of customers. I see Macys business running good this quarter and next. People are getting comfortable living with Covid.
"Look at Macy's max chart.Notice during the financial crisis M hit around $7.50-$7.80 and then went up for years to hit something like $60-$65 bucks.Know what you own.3 quarters ago Macy's was clocking in 8.5 billion in sales,but now they've adjusted because of the Covid and they will be stronger than ever before.WATCH AND LEARN."
"Amazon has even been suggested as a primary suitor for struggling retailers Macy's. A move into retail real estate would provide the company with a physical presence closer to consumption centers, allowing it to shorten delivery distances to households. It would also give the company the physical presence needed to build out its grocery business, Amazon Fresh. A deal could also give the company access to brand names that have been reluctant to sell on the company's website."
I don't think M will reinstate dividend this soon. Stock should reach substantially high( around 18-20 ) for the dividend to be back.
"Lowest unemployment and strongest GDP we've seen in years, but the market focuses only on tariff skirmishes with China? Buy the dip."
40+ with real estate. They have the footprint to do same day delivery with all their stores.
Hey Reddit if ur reading this message plz get M back to $30
"It's Not Just Me, But Even Analyst: Holiday shopping will be 'very, very good' despite coronavirus, stimulus headwinds. Macy's will be around another 100 Years."

Wow! Are you missing out on making a lot of money by taking a long position!!
just picked up a few before earnings. I think all bad news has been discounted.
"Jim Cramer is right , Macy should go up higher than $20. Just like Disney"
Remember folks. Fortunes are made when you buy. Not when you sell. M is in it for the long haul so I have no problem when it goes down.
"After a few days of big decline last week, now a green candle on the 20 moving average. The candle is small so the reversal patterns is not that strong as it can be, but it's not bad. Gap up tomorrow with another green candle could be the confirmation.- I am not long / short in Macy's at this moment -"
"consumer confidence rise very high, so it's time to buy M, M still #1 high ranking retailers, m price too low, low p/e and high dividend, I think m can make $4.1 per share in 2019, target price $52 per share."
"I love when everyone bashes retail right before holiday season, good entry points the past couple years"

Long and strong
"The stock is in trouble but it has a long history the dividend payout is healthy and gives you a big yield, if it goes to 10% dividend i am buying and waiting for a rebound. It's undervalued compared to it's peers. Even if the dividend is suspended by half you will still get a 5%. they are making moves to adjust at the current enviroment and they have a good balancesheet and profit margins, also the valuations are already low. So you are getting 10% returns on dividend while waiting for a rebound, i think at 15$ is a great buy opportunity"
"Success caseFair P/B= Assets turn over* net margin* leverage/discount rate . assets turnover all time low is 1.14, a net margin of 4% is possible. leverage is high 6.89. discount rate = beta* (market premium)= 13%. So fair P/B=1.14 4%*6.89/13% = 2.41. book value= 8,69. Fair price= 21. 15% chance of BK that adjusts fair price to 17,85"
Who wants to be short going into the weekend?
Don't be shaken by this low volume manipulation. There is zero volume on M today which gives MM's the chance to pin M to the $18 mark for Max pain on Options tomorrow. Nothing will ever change this as long as they have control.
"Market will begun recovering midday and M will finish green. Amazon interest will have to be addressed in short term while the price is depressed or ignored as Macy's expands their online presence themselves. The shutdown due to c19 may be the best thing that ever happened to Macy department stores, in the long term, for it forced them to dive into online sales. Now their market is not restricted to shoppers in their stores. Their market is now the world. How will that effect them? Look at the long term chart for Amazon."
Dial M for money. Lol.
Good news for traders. 200 day is plummeting. It will test that again before going below $11.
"WOW don't get to many time like now for every shares M can buy back they are getting them at about 30-40% lower then they are worth plus it will make every share way more valuable WOW only very big upside for every share that can be retired. Heck if you don't want to at less call in the /new American Banking system Apple Bank , Facebook bank , Google bank, MSFT Bank , INTC Bank , CSCO Bank they all have boat loads of cash all locking for yield , but best of all they would all love to fry the shorts."
Bravo Macys! You r finally getting the recognition that u deserve. 
"Ok I just bought M now it will start going down.. Get ready to buy at $6.50 , because every time I buy at $10.50 and then it goes to $6.50 and I am stuck with it... Story of my trading life..."
"WALMART & Macy's, Brick Mortors should partner...."
"Here's a little fact check for everyone to ponder. Its obvious that M is unlikely to cut their dividend by their forecast and recent commentary, however why haven't they declared the dividend yet? If they were going to cut that most likely would have been announced along side earnings which they haven't. That being said nobody knows what's going on w dividends yet but what i do know is that M pays 465M a year in dividends, that's alot considering the marketcap is near 4B. M can literally buyback 11% of the shares at current prices with just the dividend they payout in a year which is after tax earnings. This would immediately change the forward estimated eps from 2.40 to about 2.80 a share. Oh but what there's something else... the 34M shares that were eliminated would also potentially yield a savings of 51M a year if M decides to reinstate the dividend the following year. This use of funds from dividend will do nothing to Macy's core business and is totally optional. Those that argue this would decimate M stock obviously haven't been paying attention when M went from 42 down to 13.5! It has already been decimated (unjustly) by the market so a surprise move by management like this would definitely rattle the nearly 30% short positions that are definitely impacting share prices. Those in favor of a divi cut to buyback shares at current levels please like and those that oppose please dislike. We need to show M what investors want change!"
"If you hold and be patient, there will be enormous profits. If in doubt, ask those who bought the stock in 5s 3 weeks ago."
They had some interesting insights about M on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
I never comment but what is happening with this stock? I was genuinely expected to sell around at 15$ around Christmas? Why did it drop so much the past week? Does anyone have any plausible explanation?
"IMO, the current move up is gaining momentum, and other retailers are participating. The rotation is toward stocks with metrics like M, so it looks like this move has more to go as the shift to ""value"" stocks gets into full gear for the year end.."
HAHAHAHA THIS SUDDEN CRASH
"I am looking forward to Macys reporting their quarterly earnings! The momentum for Macys business is strong in in a post lockdown parts of the country, think of the free states such as Florida and Texas. As a point of reference, the Dillards chain of department stores reported amazing quarterly results recently and their stock price reacted by breaking through a new record high, in a huge move up. Macys currently has more than 40 million shares short according to the WSJ."
greater than ever online sales here at macy's one of the top 10 ecommerce shopping sites
Wow...Almost 8 percent dividend. In slowing economy let’s see how long that lasts... hmmm
"I take this mornings announcement as a very positive indicator. Macy's paying down their credit revolver shows they have enough liquidity to make it through the pandemic. They didn't have to go to the vultures to give away the whole farm to secure money. It's my opinion Macy's will steadily rise from here. As the stock rebounds over time to $15+, Macy's will have a secondary offering and deleverage their balance sheet. Now is the time to start a long position."
I buy at 11
will Phillip be right tomorrow - that is the big if question for this board - is he a paid shill from a hedge fund?
What happen to Carlos today ?
"I can't wait for tomorrow to learn what is going on. Either I'm right and Macy's is way overvalued here at 20 x forward earnings or else there is a renaissance of American department store/mall based retailing that has gone right over my head. Do people see new malls being built and a return to 90s style shopping happening? I myself liked that world so I would be thrilled, but I just can't envision that happening from what I'm seeing."
"Without question, this is definitely underperforming, anyone can see that. Get ready for the downgrade cause it will be more of the same back down to $12 or even less."
"I think Macys can use their several brick and mortar stores as a way to outperform all other retailers. Considering many people now order their clothing online, it means there is a high dependence on instant satisfaction. Macys can get data on some of the brands heavily ordered online with fastest delivery and choose to stock on those brands assuring customers within local communities of same day deliveries. How nice will it be if you wake up and realized u don’t have the right matching tie or suit or dress and then u place an order on Macys to have it delivered at ur door within 2 hrs from the closest Macys store. That far outperforms any online retail."
tell me divinded start??
Zacks changed his rank on macy's. from strong sell to buy!https://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/M?q=M
"M was one of three stocks mentioned on CNBC this morning as prime candidates for year end tax loss selling. With a loss of 48% for the year M was way ahead of the other two. Do most of you still think there isn't going to be tax loss selling with M?If you don't, please explain why."
"Lot's of the October 18 calls bought today, all strikes. Someone thinks we're going back into the 20's."
I love the popcorn fart PR by our CEO. A bright light in an uncertain world. He says nothing of facts and talks of vague forward looking statements. Why didn't he mention the sale of the Seattle Macys? They paid the most real estate taxes of any Seattle building. Was in the top three of any employer of people in Seattle. The loss of M revenue will be connected to the sale of this building. Ten floors of rentals generated millions in rent per year. The sale will get to our bottom line. How long can M cannibalize the real estate to fuel a broken Mall retailer. M is no AMZN.
Re-launch Dividend News.... soon
With a short interest approaching 50%. I wonder how big the short squeeze is going to be if new shareholders buying at these levels decide not to sell until much higher prices.
"Macy's, The YO-YO-Stock keeps-on Dangling on its String. lol"
I'm so glad to own Macy's when the whole Market is down. What do you think shorts ?
"E, actually it is a great buy given the manipulated and controlled markets we now find ourselves in and actually have been in for over a year. We hear that there are concerns about the economy, yet we have retailers posting very good numbers. We get Kohl's, Gap, ANF, Target, BBY, Wal-mart and many others jump anywhere from 5 to 30% after reporting. And yes we do have the laggards as well, JWN, though they are flirting with 52 week lows are still a distance away and offer a dividend which is half of Macy's. We supposedly have government numbers which came out extremely close to the time that the government shutdown was resolved for December retail numbers which according to the government were horrible, yet this seems to run counter to what Visa and Mastercard were saying and is being confirmed by dozens of retailers who posted good if not great numbers. So what we will probably see is that the government retail numbers which was created by a group of disgruntled typically liberal civil servants who were peeved at the President whom they blame for the shutdown, when the new numbers come out for January and February we shall see large upward revisions to these numbers and this should shut down the false narratives about the American consumer being weak. We are already at 52 week lows and we seem to reach new depths every week, yet even though many will disagree, the earnings report by Macy's was not a bad report, was it a bit disappointing, sure, though we do know that there were significant issues created by the fire at their primary on-line sales distribution center. So add into the equation again a dividend which can compete with most REITs you have a stock already at multi-year lows (last time at this level was Nov. 2017 and before that it was 2009), so you really have very limited downside. Regardless of how the markets are gamed."
what happend to the reddit people that were supposed to push this shorted stock up
Shock and awe sell off looking weak today. Beat+ raise = Up We Go!
"Greetings from the Czech Republic. In our country, we have followed the restrictions since the first case appeared in our country. Started wearing face masks, social distancing, quarantine, lockdowns, etc. Since this day we have had 8.900 cases and 315 deaths (population around 10 mil.). Monday 25th May we are reopening almost everything. Big shopping malls are already opened, except fast foods since half of May. 14 days ago there were no people shopping. Yesterday we went for shopping again and crowds are almost back to normal 70-80% I would say. During March and April online shopping has skyrocketed (especially older people) in our country, but after reopening people are getting back to standards. I must admit, that some people will never get back because of online, so Macy's will definetely lose some customers. On the other hand, customers from JCP and other devastated companies will come. According to my humble opinion COVID just accelerates a digital evolution. If Macy's survives this COVID thing, they should invest more to online. We will probably see more and more closed mall in near future, not because of COVID, but online. Macy's is a valuable company trading under its book value. I can easily see Macy's in the range of 10-12 USD after COVID, but in a long term perspective I still can see slow decline."
Berkshire (Buffett) should buy Macy's for $47.50/share..they could payback the purchase by not having to pay the dividend and Macy's free cash flow..they get the best real estate in the USA for FREE
$M on his way to rock...Hold or buy in the up trend..To $12 - $16 before end of year
All in M !
"A fair assessment of the pluses and minuses of buying M here at close to $14 per share with a very high 10% dividend (that has been manufactured by shorts and other forces which have temporarily driven the PPS down sharply from $42/share), can only be made by those with knowledge and, is really, a research project for interested parties, followed by a careful evaluation, and ultimately leads to disparate opinions. I have done my due diligence and conclude that M is way underpriced right now when compared to its intrinsic value.Properly done, you must make many comparisons between how the retailer department stores are doing in sales, earnings, margins and other metrics, and how it is thought they will do in the future. They are obviously in a competitive battle for market share and also for best practices in this age of e-commerce.Some of M’s strengths appear in the metrics found in their balance sheet items like cash, debt, real estate assets, and many other factors, all of which have to be weighed and carefully evaluated. However, even the quick passing view shows M has enormous staying power and that they are outlasting department stores of lesser stature. When you are all done with the numbers you need also to keep looking at many other factors, including the stock market prospects, the retail industry prospects, the individual company's management, dividends and the ability to pay them, buy backs, and on and on. I have tried to assess all these factors, and IMHO, M is temporarily extremely depressed and has an absolutely great comparative value at these prices, which have now become incredibly oversold given their opportunity versus their current risk. No one can argue about the opportunity, as you need look no further than last year when profits were over $4/share and the PPS was $42. What has caused the sudden sell down is the dropping profits to $3/share, which in and of itself is overdone, IMO.With a reasonably strong economy, despite the fear that it might be slowing in the coming year, but still growing, and the other positive factors favoring discretionary spending by consumers, retailers stand in a good position now. During the next 12 months, we will see how M's multifaceted initatives work out to cut costs, increase productivity, improve their use of data and better manage inventory. Their plan and goal is to produce outsized improvements in quarterly and annual comparisons. I think they are bound and certain to achieve some or all of their objectives because their efforts are well conceived, and for may reasons, profits will grow from the low point they hit in their last quarter.To me, the time is right to buy and hold M, and it is my view that it has an excellent, logically sound, and evidence base reasons for an eventual return to $70/ share. Lower PPS numbers like $40/share and $30/share are even more likely. When it comes to high probability plays, I think it is reasonable to expect we will see the markets swing and take M back on good news way above $20. now, I like the “value play” of a solid company, with sales increases, and expected annual earnings of approximately $3/share priced, at a 5 PEs. I think PE expansion is coming and so is profit expansion. No one should ignore the value of their real estate holdings as you figure out their enterprise and market value."
Hudson Bay gets offer to go private at a nearly 50% premium of current stock price. These private investors realize the value the market is not given retailers like JWN and M. They have argued that Hudson Bays property holdings far exceed the stock prices. Is Macy's or JWN next? https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.wsj.com/amp/articles/hudsons-bay-owner-of-saks-gets-offer-to-go-private-11560171604
"I would wait to sell , I think you will get a lot more for your shares just by waiting. M stock is worth a lot more than what it's trading for and it pays you very well to wait. But if you need to sell at least do it smartly. By waiting until right before the ex dividend date of DEC 12 2019 you might get a nice little run higher or by selling with call options you just might get more for your shares. For anyone holding for the dividends you know you get paid very well to wait"
"Seems like a solid buy at these levels,"
We have to be patient. I think M easy increase 50% by December
Jill Ramsey Named Chief Product and Digital Revenue Officer of Macy’sAccording to the shorts on this board Macy's & Macy's.com are doing so bad !!! if that's true I wonder why the company would create a Chief Digital Revenue Officer position if there wasn't any online sales and revenue ??????? just for the record this lady has 20 years experience with Walmart and eBay
The M 70 cent gain yesterday was a 'Mad Money' show spike. Shorts don't want to risk holding their position because Jimmy loves retail. Jimmy ask easy questions and they're practiced and edited. Now we're giving it up. I've seen the Cramer spike and retreat time and time again. M is not for the faint of heart. 'The street' was owned by Jimmy and today's M $7 or $23 article doesn't help.
So all the analysts that said 12$ were right

"Buying all I can this morning from Cash I earned with BGS. Similar situation as M (62% short). And it pop 20% this morning after the earnings report last nite. Moving those profit to buy M and SKT to wait for a similar short squeeze to happen with eventually while collecting 10% dividend. It is tough to play with the short. 1 down, 2 more to go!

LOAD THE TRUCK!!!!!
"dbd, earnings are solid at 3.50, expectations from the company confirm this going into 2019, dividends are roughly 1.50, so it is a 2.5 coverage, unlikely the dividend is in jeopardy. I understand that it is your job to create concern amongst the long term and probably mostly older investors who hold on to Macy's for the dividend to create just enough concern that they might sell. That way the brokerage houses that you work for can come in and buy more stocks from the concerned small investors. The truth is that without knowing what the true churn rate is, we as individual investors can't really have confidence that any movement is anything more than manipulation using HFT computers. Yes, ten million shares may trade today, but really, how many times where the same shares traded back and forth to the same buyers and sellers to create a false narrative? What if Morgan Stanley and Goldman decided to trade the same block of 100K shares back and forth one hundred times at progressively lower prices, how likely is it that someone would have the capital available to intercept the trade and cause them to real lose any money on the transactions as they are just selling back and forth. The SEC needs to recruit the NSA to help them police HFT abnormalities and they need to do it NOW. Congress must mandate it NOW."

"Short story writers are focusing on a dividend cut, because they know the vast majority of long term investors are extremely conservative and bought the stock based on dividend returns, they know a dividend cut would disseminate the stock at current earnings levels. As it appears the company's management is incapable of properly phasing in seasonal changes since the past two reports have listed poor inventory mixes due to unseasonably warm/cold weather they need to focus on the same model that Spanish retail giant Inditex has created. They own their entire supply chain and come out with new seasons of fashion with low inventories, use the provided inventories as a gauge of the consumers interest, if it is great response they can mass produce the product in a matter of days and flood the shelves, if it is failure they use consumer surveys and data collection systems to re-align the designs which they can do in a matter of two weeks, if those designs work as anticipated and shown through the low initial inventory levels they again, flood the shelves, if not, back to the drawing boards. Essentially combining just in time manufacturing techniques with point of sale data collections. Not that difficult for a country that sent a man to the moon but we can't even keep up with the Spaniards."
"If M and F are so underpriced, cash solid and ready to break out,, etc. then where's the dividend ? - Pete"
"I think M will go down even if it rises in the immediate aftermath of the upcoming earnings report.The overriding fundamental fact is declining sales and earnings in an environment of low unemployment but stagnant middle class income. Add tough competition to the list. And a likely stodgy corporate management.I shorted M sometime last year and lost money, I would have made it up and gained much more if I'd held on. I suspect a repeat. Possible short term bounce and long term decline. Definitely will see 15 before the year is out."
A close friend of mine works at Macy's. The store was very busy and she's selling fragrance like the per pandemic days.
"Why I think Target or Walmart will need to buy Macy's to truly compete with Amazon. Macy's have the name brands as well as private label brands. Macy's also has ""made for Macy's"" clothing from top brands. I can't see Target or Walmart competing with Amazon without Top Brands"
"Amazon just doesn't have the capacity to convert orders into sales. Their delivery system is broken.Amazon when it tells their customers they have to wait two months to get an order filled.I don't know about You, but my response is to cancel the order and buy from their competitor.Fact is the Covid rules have broken their delivery system so it is now operating far slower then it ever has in the past.Fact is Amazon is vulnerable to competition just like any other merchant and when they fall we move to their competitors to fill our order.What Amazon sales drop drastically and costs to significantly rise due to Covid 19. Profit margins at Amazon are going down fast.Macys is in the winning position."
"Should I say I told you so? Target just released their holiday sales figures and they were disappointing. Why? Because they COMPETE head on with Walmart and NOT MACYS! Walmart and Target are primarily grocery stores with about 60 percent of all revenue from groceries. Revenue thus is fairly consistent, but boring and very low margin as they make very little profit for each dollar of sales. Half of their store footage is occupied with groceries which MACYS does not sell at all. The other half of the store sell an assortment of products that Macys does not sell either such as Tires, Car Batteries, and neither does Macys change your oil so Macys does not have a service department for cars or sell car accessories. Target competes viciously with Walmart, Costco and Sams Club. Target sells the same things as Walmart but its prices are higher than Walmart. Likewise Walmart and Target being grocery stores compete with Albertsons, Krogers etc.. in this very low profit margin business.For the very little foot space left in Walmart and Target they sell a few clothing items for men and women and children as well as shoes and I might add they sell LOW QUALITY cheap clothing such as mostly jeans and tee shirts as well as some very low quality exercise clothes. The clothes that Walmart and Target sell are of such low quality and of very poor selection because they don't have any floor space left to provide a wide selection of clothes like MACYS. Thus Target competes with Walmart and they try to steal sales from each other, but however they don't sell the same items that Macys sells.Macys is a HIGH END retailer selling high quality clothes with an excellent selection, shoes and numerous other items like fine furniture too. You Can go to Target and Walmart and buy the same items you can buy at Macys.Macys also sells unique high quality clothes, shies and furniture lines not available at any other store. Macys also has unbeatable prices too. This is why Macys is doing so well and will post surprising sales and earnings figures soon.They have a terrific 3 year growth plan to be released Feb 5 th that will send shares upward. The huge generous dividend is safe and they have enough real estate if monetized could pay off all their long term and short term debt and would be enough to buy 100% of all their common stock and take the company private with billions left over in cash.Now, that's a great value play."

"Bryn on CNBC thinks Macys was good that they only lost 688 million dollars if she has any of your money get it back fast , Any DEM wit that thinks losing 688 millions is good should not be managing any ones money"
Do I hear $7.25?
"Earnings beat the forecast. All stores open...Q1 sales 3.01 billion,gradually improving"
Going UP!!!! BUY BUY .... Going to FLY
If $7.50 isn't in the money as well... then it's more like 81.5K @ Expiry fish ;)
I think people will get inspired on july 4 annual macys fireworks show and the stock will fly that day.
Can M run like GME to $75 within 2 months?
"“We were pleased with the significant trend improvement in the fourth quarter, including a meaningful sales uptick in the 10 shopping days before Christmas. Together with disciplined expense management, our solid sales results in the fourth quarter allowed us to deliver stronger-than-expected earnings results. Importantly, we exited the year with a clean inventory position,"" said Jeff Gennette, chairman and chief executive officer of Macy’s, Inc."
Macy’s free cash flow...fairly positive balance sheet and it’s dividend is why I’m in Macy’s!
Going to close out my short position here. I have been adding to it down all the way down from an initiation in the mid $30s and the present risk/reward for the next few months is not what I typically search for.Good luck to everyone.
"There are so many shoppers in the stores daily, why is its stock unable to move up?"
"Stock is worth 15 Dont pay attention to $5 and $7 ""FAKE"" price targets cheesy WS analysts have put out. If the economy restarts and stores open, there will be huge pent up demand. Macy's will be just fine"
"09/23/2019 GARCIA C ELISA D Secretary & CLO 5,098 sharesAnother insider that sold. No questions the executive team at M is all in and are expecting great results."
GOING UP!!!!!BUY BUY BUY !!!! $21 PLUS CLOSE
It will go back to 35 in no time . Heavy debt reduction and store closings is awesome..
"Nuriel, you think way too highly of Amazon, Amazon will cease to exist in its present form if Trump gets re-elected. He will go after Bezos with the DOJ and the FTC and sue to split the company up into three parts, the retail business, which is consistently losing large sums of money, the transportation/logistics business which is losing even more money and no where near the build out that it needs to compete with the likes of Fed-ex and UPS for the last mile deliveries for retailers and of course the AWS business which is what Bezos uses to subsidize the money losing businesses. Without the subsidies from the AWS business, the retail and shipping companies will die on the vines."
Macy's is opening all it's stores real soon. It may not go back to 16 soon but it's definitely not staying below 5.
"It’s definitely a sector rotation, the 5 minutes $5 test is a game changer, Macy’s will recoup loses and forward huge gains soon"
41-19k that is one heckuva volume signalLook for a p0p 0nce the heavy selling is exhausted
Meanwhile we have covid third wave started in Europe and lot of vaccines that were developed when 'scientists' thought the virus would never mutate.
"After hearing the earnings call tonight, I expect this to be 7+ tomorrow. Q2 & Q3 will be much better. Especially with vaccines and another stimulus on the way sooner than later. And by being a more leaner and digital company, this is primed for Amazon. Let's go long, Macys!"
"M is selling at a ridiculous PE given their continuous history of sales and profits and their enterprise value that is twice the current market cap based on valuable real estate they own. It is true that this year their profit and margins came under some pressure, but they have the tools to manage the issues and the Administration will probably work out something with China that will lessen the tariff part of the problem for M. Retail, especially department stores, are undergoing some changes, but a 5 PE is just way too low to reflect the value of a large company that consistently generates $3 to $4 per share every year since 2013 (look at their profit history) and pays a good dividend to its stockholders. The S&P 500 average PE is around 18 and yet, M with $25 B in sales and an expected profit of around $3 per share gets no respect. At a mere 10 PE the current PPS would be about $30 where it still would be undervalued. If they turn things around and show EPS growth and improved margins, they could support a 12 to 15 PE IMO which would triple current PPS metrics. In 2018 they generated $4/share with higher debt costs. Clearly they could get back to those numbers with lower debt costs and all their technology ideas they are working on. At $4/share and 12 PE, they could return to a PPS of near $50/share, which no doubt is their working goal. Those with vision that buy stock here may be richly rewarded, IMO. Meantime you get a nice yield on your investment which cannot be obtained with bonds in the current market environment. If everything they are working on fails, and things do not pick up for M, you can always sell, LOL."
"There will be steady increase all the way to earnings date. Then, a big jump on the earnings date. Covid 19 has been priced into this stock. And then some."
Retail sales report due out this morning....Lets see if this can break past 26 today...
"Time to buy? or is this going to keep dropping, been struggling to try and understand what the market is doing lately"
"Macy‘s is going to teach shorties a lesson they‘ll never forget.......... just sayin........... whatever it takes............ Annual Meeting tomorrow Friday, 15th May 2020 with BIG news............"
"Goldman Sachs ""upgrades"" Macy's stock. New target, $21 from $23. Lol, you cant make this stuff up."
Hit 52 week high.
I think they will have strong Q2 numbers because their stores have reopened and they have a strong E-commerce business. They have tons of good deals online right now! Many items 50 -75% off. Clearing out tons of inventory. They should have strong revenues this quarter. This is a great price entry point. Earnings are on 08/12.
After looking through and examining targets release. If you look beauty product and clothing sales increased what dragged them down was electronics and small home goods. Macy's is mostly all beauty and apparel!. Target also said they will.matcj guidance. Macy's is going to beat. Buy more on this dip. Shorts this is a chance to close your position now it's cheaper!!!!?!
if you're wondering why it's down after hours.. thank GAP CEO Art Peck for walking out.
I am following Macy's but I read thoroughly the report from the Top Analyst and I sold. I don't think conditions warrant over $3. Given the nosedive I cannot risk My firm's Involvement given numerous Analysts reporting and my team explained the dire situation. I might but back at 3.
"R, I would like to personally thank you for being short Macy's. My retirement has been fast tracked, due to low IQ shorts such as yourself!!! Unfortunately you're facts are inaccurate, you claimed Macy's lost $1.95/per share in Q4 of 2020. In reality they made $0.80/share!!! Perhaps your time would be better spent doing research instead of trolling on message boards!"
"The latest MorningStar article indicate that Macy's Revenue fell roughly 3 billion (26's to 23's) during the last recession (2007-9). If we are headed to a significant downturn, how much would revenue drop in today's environment for Macy's?"
"Find a cheaper stock from a relatively stable company. TTM P/E of 5, with no signs of the company falling apart. They have real estate worth more than the full market cap of the company. The dividend has grown more than 10% avg/yr for 10 years. Their e-commerce has grown every quarter, quarter over quarter for 10 years. The dividend is 8.8%. They are paying down their debt consistently and easily. They make profits every quarter. Yes, Amazon is a long term threat to viability. Yes, JC Penney and Sears are going out of business. Yes, Chinese tariffs are bad for Macy’s. Yes, malls struggling is bad for Macy’s. But, Macy’s isn’t going anywhere. They make a lot of money. They own a lot of assets. They’re growing their presence online. Their dividend is fantastic. If the shock went up to $25, the dividend would still be 6%+. The P/E would still be just over 7. And the stock would be up over 50%. This is a steal here."
"At $40, Macy's was a sell. Down here, it is a good bet for private equity. Buy us out at $25, sell Herald Square, pay off all the debt, close more under-performing stores, and plow the savings heavily into macys.com. No-brainer."
"I would think that with the good job report his morning retailers would go up today. And I was right. Most of them are green, except of course our beloved M."
I'm going to add to my 5000 shares in the morning.
"The holiday season is just around the corner, and a new report from Mastercard is forecasting that holiday sales will grow 3.1% this year. The economic setting is helping all retailers, and especially Macy's because it has been sold far beyond reason."
Pain is coming for shorty all across the market
sounds like a deal to me ..about 20 bucks a share and a dividend of 6.5 %
Haven't been to a Macy's in Aug or Sep and so far in Oct. What is it that Macy's sells?
"$5,74 (+10,14%) and already over 20 million shares traded! Macy‘s WILL survive............ and WILL go back to double-digits again........... whatever it takes (please note that every third Macy‘s-share is sold short => Hefty short-squeeze taking traction slowly but steadily)"
At the rate Macy's is really losing money they should be broke really soon and the venders should stop shipping product to them. If you have ordered furniture or other big ticket items and they are late getting to you it's more than likely Macy's could not pay for them with such a big loss in Q4 and you may never get them
"Evercore upgrade tthis morning June 4, 2018The 'retailpocalypse' is over and it's time to go long Macy's, Evercore ISI saysEvercore ISI ""double-upgrades"" shares of Macy's to 'long' from ""short,"" saying that classic retailers and brands are learning to adapt in a digital age.""We are convinced that old-world brands and retailers are figuring out how to manage inventory and market to consumers in the digital era,"" analyst Omar Saad wrote."
Fair value for M is $35
"what is bothering me is that this security, even with the miss, is still getting priced for extinction. Tough to know if this is truly a value trap or not.... hate to see it going to the way of BBBY, but I don't know what to do. Be greedy when others are fearful is a great mantra, but my god, how much further can it truly go with it's EBITDA multiple where it's currently at? The dividend discount model and CAPM says its worth much more than this instrinsically but the market is speaking for itself. Within one month, I'm down over 25%."
"Load it up, Let make M great again people !!!"
Last day of the year tax loss selling. This should pop back up first week of the new year and continue through earnings.
"Be aware... History could repeat, Macys stock grew from $5 in 2008 to $72 in 2015. This time Macys can grab the market that stores are leaving bankrupt..."
Search for the following article title:Mall Stocks Surge With Shoppers Coming Back Faster Than Expected
"Today, June 13th is Macy’s ex dividend date. So if you bought M stock prior to today and held the stock up to today you will receive the .377 per share dividend. June 14th is the date of record when the list of dividend recipients is established. Many notions were being expressed on this board and I just wanted to clarify."
Short squeeze imminent. I warned you for weeks
10% off it's high in a day lol. Sell every pop.
"I don’t care what ya say, Macy’s is a good buy at this price. Added at the drop today"
"Revised - Okay who wants to buy Macys. We pay a premium for the company or $22.00 per share x 308 million shares outstanding = $6,776,000,000. Go private and use the dividend to pay off the loan each year with money to spare. Sell 300 stores, pay off the leases and some debt, and keep only the best properties. Operate the company for 4 years while paying off all the remaining debt. Then dump the inventory, sell all the other properties except the NY Macy's and Bloomingdale's buildings and be debt free owning the buildings outright - 5 billion profit at least."
Today?s price action make no sense ..should be playing above $14 ...total #$%$
"Up, Up , up and away resumes today. Back to the 20s then 30s!"
Let’s hold
"The article yesterday saying many of retail are poised to now have reached a bottom and may now be able to surprise on upside may be responsible for yesterday’s good price action in M, KSS, and JWN. I am happy either way as have Jan 26 calls and not much time for improvement ( unless I exercise them). Go M !!!"
"I honestly don't think it's going to be safe for anyone to short a stock that is heavily shorted going forward. WSB proved you can own anyone no matter the size if you can just spill some blood in the water. GME was easy to drive as the short interest was 130%. But AMC has been driven up too with a much smaller short position. Even if we don't see a swarm of investors buying calls on M, the shorts have got to feel like they've drifted into deep waters. I'm thinking the smart money will exit and see how this settles given the potential down side of a short squeeze and a feeding frenzy on the minds of retail investors."
"One thing for sure, analysts covering M will have to notch up their eps estimates for this year. You can take that to the bank."
"People back to office and public gatherings, shod increase within two weeks, patience"
When you see HAS and W and other retail companies that have 1/5 of the revenues of Macy's and own no real estate and valued same as M you have to wonder how UNDERVALUED Macy's actually is..we should be trading over 50
"Hopefully, close above $12.50today. Good Luck IMO"
"The funds are-moving/have-moved their money from the COVID winning tech sector to the losing Retail/Airlines/etc. this afternoon.It would appear they are taking profits from the long term winners, and shifting over to the losers, expecting to reap easy profits in these sectors now."
OXY already 22B market cap..I am sure that Macy is worth 22B
Get ready for a decent rebound today........ whatever it takes......
will touch single digits
"This seems to me like a good go round. I actually buy clothes online through Macy's. They do clothes better than Amazon. Macy's did close a giant retail store near me, that it could prob have rented for peanuts after this disaster. However, they are a real online play, not that the website couldn't be better, but it's pretty good. This company has a lot of upside, and if it goes down 10% and you want out, you just get out. It's not gonna crater at this price."
Massive 40 percent float short!I love being long this stock!
Half the float short on M going into the holidays will make my holiday. Buy hard and long.
Is Macy's heading down the same road as Sears? I don't knowI remember when Macy's declared BK in the 1980's and given up for dead.Came back though.Is this a repeat performance going on from the 1980's?
"I’ve been day trading for years and I’m so glad I finally found (http://Fairstox.com). They’re pre-market watchlists cover all the latest market-moving news, and they don’t beat you down with tons of ads. Highly recommend!"
"M is the best house in a challenging neighborhood. Small sp declines in the last 2 trading sessions tells me investors are buying the quality names like M. CNBC, Cramer and Zacks touting M as a buy. As you can see Amazon and Best Buy have bigger sp declines. I like my $31 average in M right now with a 4.8% annual dividend."
"Macy's just made an early ""Tender"" offer to payoff debt!"
"Wow, all over a 20 cent cut the annual eps? Seems surreal. Macy's has been chopping down its debt big-time over the past few years. Wouldn't be surprised to see private equity weigh in. Herald Square looking cheaper and cheaper."
We love shopping at Macys wonderful stunningly beautiful stores. It is like a winter wonderland!
"I will continue to invest in Macy's with the belief that they will continue to adapt to the changes in retail (Ex: Online shopping, Etc...) If Macy's can't make it then Sears, JC Penny. Etc...won't and Amazon will WIN in the end. Amazon will inflate all of their prices since there won't be no more competition."
"Macy’s, Inc. (M) stock RSI 31.70 Signals investors to buy – Wallstreet Morninghttp://www.wallstreetmorning.com/2019/01/11/macys-inc-m-stock-rsi-31-70-signals-investors-to-buy/"
"Reverse head and shoulders pattern, if I was short, I'd probably cover an hour ago. 10,000 shares M long. 9 target."
"In a report released yesterday, Robert Drbul from Guggenheim reiterated a Buy rating on Macy’s Inc (M – Research Report), with a price target of $30. The company’s shares opened today at $21.80, close to its 52-week low of $21.08."
Look even AAL who is in debt up to their neck is going up. M has a lot more potential. Customers are more likely to go shopping than get on an aircraft for hours.
Starting next week people will be buying stocks. Shorts will be surprise. Watch and learn.
come on 15$i will buy for divinded 1$ per year
$10+ next week. Buy buy buy for me! Loading the truck.
"Let’s look at history and see what it’s telling us...Q1:February 26, 2019...Macy’s stock rises on Sales and earnings beatQ2:May 15, 2019...Macy’s stock rises as it blows past earnings estimatesQ3:November 21, 2019...The trend is your friend LONG MACYS!!!Happy Thanksgiving!!!"
"When people talk about an inflationary environment of money printing, stimulus, and re-opening, the market is forward looking so I'm assuming all of that is why this has tripled since November. Now Macy's just needs to have huge growth from all of that to justify their insane valuation."
"I guess M is going to trade sideways, like the rest of the market, until we have more data. Most likely between 6 and 6.5."
The negativity is so intense it wont take much to send Macys stock to the moon! We cannot lose!
"OMG, My Macy's stock down over 14%, I'm so scared, not. I will back the truck up at these prices. Drive it down so I can BUY BUY BUY."
"Wall Street doesn't care about debt. The interest payment doesn't count in GAAP and EBITDA. So if M loses $12 a share for 2021 like 2020, the $220,000,000 they'll pay on interest for 2021 is hidden. M will tell you they paid $28 million for the 4th Q of 2020 but its not deducted from profits. So you'll think they made money when GAAP and EBITDA hid the losses. The CEO will get his grand kids through private schools while the meat and potato investors on this board pay for it as he dumps shares or units as he states."
"This will continue to rise just as Kohl's has. 6 months ago KSS was 20 and now 57.00. This will be the same, don't miss the boat!"
Sideways trading at 6.50 would be the most painfull move of the price of Macy's for me.. DECIDE already Macy's.. are you going up or down?
More positive news about a vaccine today. Volume is huge. M could test $8.00 today.
"Hi, I just sold about half my shares @ 30.90. Was that a mistake?"
"Macy’s needs $4.6B cash injection to remain viable , either through equity dilution or real East are sales,or both.With Ebitda of $1.7B and market cap of &1.7B , Macy will have to issue massive debt, since selling real estate will have a negative sentiment.At $8.1B in total debt obligations and the full withdrawal of the $1.5B revolving credit Macy’s will have difficulties paying it’s current debt obligations.Only government bond purchasing will save Macy’s,"
"Ollie's is a retailer for bargain shoppers. Their stock got clobbered after they reported earnings, forecasting (stop if you've heard this before) about a 20 cent drop in expected earnings for the year to roughly $2/share. Macys earnings forecast dropped about the same amount to about $3/share. After getting pummeled, Ollies is about $60/share, a P/E of around 30. Macys is $15/share, a P/E of 5. The valuations aren't pretty for M, but I'd say M has a lot more upside and less risk."
"I will be the first one to say it. @Nomansky while I hated your posts in the beginning, I don't think most of us can deny the entertainment value you brought. With that said, I do not wish you good luck, as our interests are opposite sides of the coin. I wish you much losses with your shorts.."
"The news has been great, if people read the news rather than the headline. Expecting a strong bounce here. Store closings, selling properties is good for the company and SP! Adding Macy's at these levels...https://www.bizjournals.com/cincinnati/news/2018/01/04/macys-announces-closure-of-10-more-stores-bringing.html?ana=yahoo&yptr=yahoo"
Macy's is structuring to become a high-end Amazon. All those people calling for an Amazon buy out. I don't think Macy's will sell to them. They want to be the captain of their own shop and it is Macy's to the world not just walk-in shoppers in malls and stores located in major cities. They are going online on big scale Macy's to the world there's a lot of stock equity in that statement.
"It will become very difficult to make intelligent decisions about a retailer's success or failure anymore based on traffic through the stores as most traffic even in the past were lookie Lou's who rarely bought much, it has always been a very inexact science and now it is made much worse with the omni-channel approaches which retailers are forced to pursue. This past quarter, WSM made 57% of their revenues on-line as on-line becomes more prominent this will only escalate. Furthermore, those who do shop in-person are probably much more likely to be real buyers, so it should prove to be interesting to see how companies such as Cleveland Research stay relevant based on what is mostly questionable if not misleading data points."
Let me explain something to the uninitiated. A whole lot of new debt is not a good thing. One day Macy has to pay it all back and in the meantime they have to pay interest which will take a heavy toll on Macy´s low margins and it is doubtful that they will ever become profitable again. In the next couple of months when the rapid cash burn becomes apparent people will rush to the exit once again.
"I am holding 1100 shares of Macy’s, but for those who think (or yell to get more people buying) dividend is easy money grab, you need to have some education."
"It will rebound was in 6's and even 7""s while all the stores were closed. Not to worry just takes time."
BUY BUY BUY M IS A $30 STOCK
macy has a negative growth on eps yoy and qoq. It will be hard for it to maintain the eps unless macy stop wasting money and start paying back its debt. macy needs like 15 years to pay it back. Their so called store improvements flunked.
Trading doesn’t have to be about losing all the time. It doesn’t have to be about letting the markets pummel you day in day out. Fight back with (http://Pick-stocks.com). Beef up your defenses and join them.
"Sorry folks, looks like we broke the $15.88 bottom so next level of support is $14.33Long and strong."
day trading this is so easy and fun lol
"Still think M needs to float a convertible for $1+billion. Use the $$ to buy back shares and fund operational improvements. even w/o a note, time for M to buyback shares and cancel dividend for next 1-2 quarters. The virus is going to hit this for a few quarters, but I'd expect it'll back to being a good biz for X-mas, which is when they make their money anyway. At $7/share, the market cap is roughly $2.5b, which means it's way below book."
Mentioned on Fast Money tonight. Seymore and another guy love the stock here. We'll see tomorrow.
M will rise up quickly!!!!! Buy your tickets not this train now!!!!!
Yesterday some complained here that M was down while Market up. What do they say today ?
"Hurry sell, sell, sell LOL,LOL,LOL Wall Street rich clients are now buying M LOL,LOL,LOL Sell and prove me wrong LOL,LOL,LOL I am the greatest of all time and M will be going higher so get your shares"
How much more can this stock go down? Who is holding the stock price down? This stock never should have been over $40. But this price is so low. I don't get how you can short it.
"All the retailers were down today. Please don't compare M with retailers that sell groceries like Target and Wal-Mart. With the pandemic people feel comfortable wearing clothes that are inexpensive. They got a mask and sun glasses on so who do they have in impress? People don't get married as much as they use to, but the pent up demand is now. M makes a lot on funeral and wedding clothes."
"143,735,100 Shares Short ...i.e. 46.42% Short Interest(%)when the shorts get this wrong.. the stock has easy potential for a double / triple.. 50% short is really a big number."
Selloff already accelerating. Didn't even make it to earnings before scalpers jump ship. Longs better pray $6.73 holds.
"Poorazz Shoppers who get zucked-into a Macy's Credit-Card. The average rate on a store credit card is just over 26%, much higher than the average rate of 21% for regular credit cards. lol"
Bought some more. My avg. is 5.07
Impressive

Moderna is a Top Stock in Vanguard Small-Cap Growth Index Fund ETF Shares (VBK)
Yep news coming out later about how busy they were today lol
46% of Macy's is sold short around 122 million shares every shareholder put a good till canceled sell order at $15 or higher on your shares it will not allow short sellers to borrow them they have to buy back every share they have sold short deny them the opportunity and it will create a short squeeze that will drive this to $40Turn the short sellers into short smellers two can play this game
The addition of new buyers off the earnings report plus shorts covering into the Christmas season equals at least $15. Mark this post.
"I am buying more, do my parts supporting the revolt against establishments."
"very undervalued, went to Macy's yesterday took me an hour just to get out of the parking lot."
At what time is the retail federation report coming out? does anybody knows if Macy´s is making also an announcement regarding its sales?
We haven't heard of Macy's Opening Any more than 68 +50-Stores Outta 775. That leaves 657 to Open--Those Open doing only 50% of Normal Sales? lol
How many Billion dollar debt offering is m going to announce for q2 carnage? That is if there are any left to purchase yet another very high risk bond offering. Round 1 $5 billion 8% interest (Very high risk).
Even millennials shop at Macy's. An offer of $25/sh is the least if acquisition is in order.
"Folks... it doesn’t get any better than this !! Excellent entry point at multi year lows. Strong earnings and a great dividend.... this retailer is not affected by Amazon at all. People that go to Macy’s like to try things and shop outside, they are not coach potatoes that just buy on line. I see an earnings beat on the 14th and improvement overall. Even if it goes up to only $25 you still have the 7.5% dividend. Buy now !!"
"If you haven't figured it out M is a zombie company. Sell before we're are $4.50 again. They paid off $300 million in debt to replace it with $1 billion in debt in 2020. Their dividend was 15% in March; now its nothing. Meanwhile, CEO Gennette makes millions steering the zombie department store."
Pretty high volumes on a strong climb today. Are the shorts starting to bail or are institutions starting to pile in?
tomorrow we opening green
"I'm hearing management is buying 50% of the shares back, so they can work on taking the company private. Has anyone else heard that?"
"Meanwhile, companies who have improved earnings are dropping today."
"So much good news from Retail sector and other sectors report good numbers too. Result, market takes a dump. The super rich don't want you to make money, god forbid you profit from options on their stock. The power to deflate and push the market around is apparent. But succumb to their tactics, end result they want to push the market higher but greed makes them also want short term gains. Buy and hold is the only option for success."
Dan Loeb thinks Campbells is undervalued with 200 million in cash 10 BILLION in debt with revs of 8 billion and a 21 billion market cap......HE should look at Macy's with 1.7 billion in cash 5.7 debt with revs of 25 billion and a 16 billion market cap and 15-20 billion in real estate assets
"Herald Square Macy's is getting jam packed, everyone is sick of being cooped up all day and online shopping. This is going to the moon!"
Let's see here... earnings beat and raised guidance. Pretty much a great report.I wonder what this would have done on just an okay or sub par report... chapter 11 talk?
https://www.businessinsider.com/macys-vip-sale
PE ratio < 6. Amazing
Market coming to its senses? Never have seen a stock go down on such an earnings report and forecast. Buy.
Strong buy.
"1 year target estimate of all analysts is $7,77......... will get revised upwards in a few weeks and months......... double-digits coming......."
"The chart. Eventually we will close the gap on the chart at $18.86. We are now firmly above the 50 day moving average, next is the 100 day at $18.06. I think we'll be above $18 by year end."
"John, volume is meaningless, there could be one hundred million shares traded, but it could merely be churning the same one hundred thousand shares one hundred or even one thousand times. Until there is a legitimate and verifiable way of tracking the number of unique shares traded in a trading session, with the advent of HFT, following and basing decisions merely on shares traded is almost worst than no information at all. It creates false information leading to poor decisions."
Tim Seymour of Fast Money continues to plug Macy’s
$20 Plus Stock.... will close above $21 today on RAISED GUIDANCE !!!!
Very dangerous for the overall sector to correlate any future results to other members based on Dillard's. They are a very unique and niche player in sectors of the nation that did not engage in the horribly onerous shutdowns that many blue states employed. I can see this leading to a lot of disappointment in the performance of the sector going forward. I do not believe Dillard's will be indicative of Macy's or any other Mall dwellers performance.
One thing for sure M's board should be buying back and retiring all the shares than can at this price
"Now U know where This Came from: ""The company ended the quarter with about $7 billion in combined short- and long-term debt compared to a mere $2.7 billion in shareholders’ equity."" https://finance.yahoo.com/news/macys-wont-survive-a-second-wave-of-covid-19-top-strategist-165317077.html"
i notice some of you guys are trying to create alot of negativity to try to prevent buyers in buying shares cuz shorting aint working lol .... this is just the beginning wait until after hours lol stock will be in mars chilling
wow
buy buy...people need cloths more than a CAR and PHONE!!
Trump impeachment hearings are making millions and millions of Americans stay home and not go shopping.
why is this not 40 +... shorts
What did you expect? Physical locations shutdown. M will be $10+ soon enough
over $14 after hrs
Brick and mortar retail is a slow death. Nothing like paying 20% more to buy what you dont want. How long does that last?
$6 - Achieved!
"Ensure me that this will last after this week. I think a lot of people will grab their profits on Friday. I do not want to sell, but give me some data not to do it."
Retailers turning green. Jwn and kss now green. M to flip back into green. Back to 20s soon.
Good luck with the earnings week everyone. We all win some and lose some and we all know how bad it feels when we research a company and trend and find that we are wrong and lose money. I promise that next week if I'm correct and Macy's plunges I won't be here gloating. I also promise that if I'm wrong and Macy's soars that I will admit I was wrong (at least in the near term) about my bearish position and March expiry puts.Good luck!Soon we will all know a little more about Macy's performance over Christmas.
"Computers making their next wave of attacks against consumer discretionary stocks, here it goes again."
M is not BBBY ...... it has 50% less short interest than BBBY
very scary at this price over $20 - this may drop back to $11 nextweek
"Peter Lynch said investing is like planting a garden. Let's say you plant vegetable plants and they start sprouting upward. You wait and let them grow before harvesting. Too many investors see a small rise and pluck these money plants out of the ground before they are mature and miss out on massive profits. Lynch said typically he held 3 to 4 years to get the maximum profits after buying distressed stocks.A word to the wise. Some sold M prematurely at $6, SOME at $12 and some at $18, and others at $22. They all sold too soon. We are going much, much higher! To maximize your profits expect to hold, enjoy the restored dividends and set your eyes to $75 and beyond! Near term we will be in the 30s soon.As the investment matures take some profits and diversify, you should keep some as a long term part of your portfolio for diversification, capital gains and dividend incomen"
"Eight years from now, the stock price will be $180."
"This is a pretty powerful statement regarding Macy's and the misrepresentation:""Testing a shop with them in their store and having really good success made us feel bullish that this model would work well for them,"" b8ta CEO Vibhu Norby told TechCrunch.To the outsider, there's this idea that Macy's is struggling -- in light of a bunch of store closures. That was a conversation b8ta had internally, Norby said.""As an example, our board was initially not certain we should do something with them, but I felt like it was worth a shot,"" Norby told me. ""For us to get comfortable, we spent a lot of time trying to understand their business. What we found was that perception in the media didn’t really meet the reality for us. The reality is Macy's is one of the most important companies in the country.""Macy's, Norby said, is also one of the largest real estate companies in the world and owns ""so much real estate in all of the best places.""He added, ""it's not that retail itself is dying, it's just that it's changing. The way people want to shop is changing and we have a shared alignment on bringing that next generation of a company into the space."""
macy's make very good real state.
Just bought 5k more. I think this will break 15 in no time! Vaccines are being administered this week to so many across the world
"As Macy's makes incremental improvements to it's assets and manages it's costs, over time it will gradually improve, not decline, as some think. How fast the improvements come is dependent on many unpredictable variables, but their opportunity to use data mining, AI, and other modern productivity inhancers is widely under appreciated. This may turn out to be one of the biggest winners of the next 5 to 10 years. Yes, there is a lot of things to do, but it is underestimated how much low lying fruit they have to work with. Shorts have helped set up a nice risk/reward play for those buying at this time,Imo. Please do your own careful research, as there is a lot to understand and assess with this company."
+20% a day!!!! WHAT A DAY!!IT'S CHRISTMAS
"Retailers e-commerce will soon be established and starts eating away Amazon advantage. Many brick and mortar sites will be closed and only good, profitable locations are opened. Order online and pickup at curbside will become the norm."
Retail sales up. Clothing sales up 105%. For June.
BOYS...M... IS A LOCK GOING INTO THE HOLIDAYS. 17S BY THANKSGIVING. 19S BY FEBRUARY...BANK IT!!!!
Going to EXPLODE to the UPSIDE!!!! Close $18 PLUS
Shorts are stubbornly holding on! Eventually they will panic and capitulate! Each dollar up is $110 million is losses to shorts!
"One main reason why M has received some upward traction as of late has been the recent positive news about a vaccine. And yes, that is a game changer. But another positive development for M has the reduction of competition. Gone are Lord & Taylor, JC Penney, Sears, and others. Who will be left aside M? Hardly anyone."
Im in. Easy double from here
I remember when AMD was at 2 dollar. Every analyst from Barron to Cramer was saying sell sell. Look where it is now.
I love the Macy’s thanksgiving day parade!!
Epic short squeeze coming tomorrow after earnings. I’m talking EPIC!!!!
"great day for M longsfor now, i go to watch the launch space X rocketgoodluck for the astronauts, grts from Belgium"
Prime rate will be cut 100 basis points!
"Outstanding short float is at 15.232% according to my workstation, that's more than a 2% increase in the entire float this past week. Once a change of sentiment hits, this should pop."
"Oh, yahoo deleting my posts aye. Once again, I love how a strong jobs report bumped my retail and trucking stocks but all of the other news for the last six months I guess was just ""fake news""??"
Hey Shorts....the death of the mall is premature and M should see a solid earnings report. Have a great weekend!
Macy's/Bloomingdales is smartly discounting high margin well known designer products 20-30%. Not Nordstrom or Neiman Marcus. Store traffic is greatly elevated due to the sales. Positive customer experiences and satisfaction with the sale prices. Plus currently giving 25 dollar gift cards for every 150 spent in the store or online. What's that mean? They come back and spend more money at Macy's/Bloomingdales! It's not rocket science shorts.... But maybe you haven't been shopping lately because your worried about what you borrowed on margin.... Close out here it'll be cheaper
"Glad to see the stock going up but here in Tampa, the Macy's was dead the day after Thxgiving. Keep in mind, businesses in FL are open and we have huge influx of tourists. Currently still dead with stores closing early."
Low P/E and high dividend drew me to M. I've owned it four previous times and always made money. Bought in at $22.84 this morning and feel good about it. Now back to the okra garden.
"Tomorrow M 3,2,1"
The market is pricing in a lackluster earnings report for 2/26
"The option premium is off the chart with M. It has great momentum. For now M is no more risky than blue chips stocks like INTC, APPL, HD, etc. if you want to sell put options."
"Offices, stores, schools are opening around the country. Life is returning back to normal. Shorties will get caught with their pants down, when we get back to back good news from vaccine and treatment side of things. Good things happen over time, great things happen all at once."
Vaccine ready before the Christmas buying spree. Buy like crazy imo.
"companies like Nikola haven't sold a single product but now trading in d 60s, but this iconic company that makes Christmas fun is 7. Market must be crazy"
M reached a 52 Week low at 5.93
"The fact that we still gained over a dollar (including AH trading), after the market was completely spooked about the Fed raising interest rates, shows the stock is resilient. We'll get back over 30 soon enough."
"BOYS....I LOADED UP THE BOAT IN THE 14S.......THIS IS A 20 DOLLAR STOCK BY NEXT EARNINGS. 40 % ON MY MONEY IN 3 MONTHS...YA, I CAN LIVE WITH THAT !!!!"
added 250 more shares. will meet in 2-3 years :)
"M is down because of fear that JCP will be declaring soon and it rubs off on all retailers. But M will not decale. they have too much value in the real estate and they dont have that much debt. It will slowly creep back up to 10-15$ range. They need to suspend their divvy to conserve cash. That, paradoxically perhaps, will cause the stock to rise"
"Received my $4500 dividend payment from Macy’s today. Great way to start the New Year. Every 3 months, the shorts have to pay me. Thank you Nomansky"
Macys is undervalued from a fundamental basis. Typical stock fluctuation on an upward trend. Down on low volume yesterday.Move back to 20s and 30s to resume soon!

"M p/e =6 , dividend 7.35% , it's business stable, very low unemployment rate and people income continues growth, so M can rocket any time."
"Reasons to buy Macy's stock before it hits $301) You're not just buying Macy's, but Bloomingdales, Blue Mercury & Backstage. All of the retailers have their own strengths and cover a wide and diverse market of shoppers nation-wide.2) Real estate holdings are worth between $16 and 20 BILLION dollars. And have been monetized quite well in 2017, whether selling properties or leasing space, to high-end shops, on or near its flagship stores.3) It generated $170 million in profit from its store credit cards alone in 2017. 5) Still paying a generous 5.5% dividend (even more if you got in last year). And there is no sign that they are going to reduce it anytime soon.6) Weaker dollar brings more foreign shoppers to retailers like Macy. Amazon can't and doesn't benefit from it as much. I'm not going to knock Amazon, they will always be dominant, but saying it's the death of retail is like saying Netflix is the death of the the Movie industry. Both can and will co-exist with each other.7) That which does not kill you, only makes you stronger. Sears, JCP, & Bon-Ton, large closings and bankruptcies may sting M in the short run, but in the long run reduced competition will bring more customers to Macy's and their other stores.Once we hit $30, FOMO will kick in again driving the stock to new highs. Hesitate at your own risk."
"I think this was a nice little and much needed pull back for this stock. I think we trade around the 10 multiple at 3.75-3.95 of projected eps until earnings. I am taking the bullish side on this stock, and believe the rewards program offers great deals for customers that are hard to pass up. The report of more and more backstage stores being opened up will complete for market share against TJX. I would like to see more of an online eCommerce site for backstage, but with the latest Supreme Court ruling on sales tax.. that might not be such of an issue at the moment (I still want it though). If the next earnings release is promising, I like mid to upper 40's as a nice target.(full disclosure - I am a long with a cost basis in the mid 20's)"
Will close green and skyrocketing tomorrow
MACYS Will Shine IT Has BIG Days ahead.
$18+ By EOW mark this post
"Stock manipulators know something, because Puts and Calls raise from $7.50 to $9.00 by 18 December. Price will go up, they're betting on it !!!"
"department store shares up 2% today. Huge sell volume for Macy's. If this isn't your warning, I don't know what is."
Was at Macy’s the past few days and hardly any merchandise in the store
18.18 I like it!
Above $8.00 real firework start for Macy. First needs to cross $7.75
"Article from a couple of weeks ago“ Macy's also anticipates unspecified goodwill and asset impairment charges. We had expected a 37% net sales decline and a $445 million operating loss. Although we expect to reduce our per share fair value estimate of $17.60 by a high-single-digit percentage after the quarterly report, we view Macy's as attractive, as we believe it will survive as a downsized business and return to profitability.Macy's has taken drastic steps to conserve cash, such as suspending its dividend (saving about $450 million in cash per year), furloughing staff, and cutting planned 2020 capital expenditures by more than $500 million. The firm entered May with $1.52 billion in cash and total debt of $5.66 billion and is trying to raise additional capital. While this process is likely complicated by the economic shock and the resignation of chief financial officer Paula Price (announced in April), we believe Macy's will raise the necessary funds”"
"9% yield on M, wonder will it be cut soon,, or is the real estate holding so profitable they can keep it going as they try to figure out how to sell GROCERY vs Clothes since clothes no one wants,,,, people want electronics and food,, thats it,,fashion is dead"
party time
brutal drop since earnings
"Tonya GarciaTue, May 18, 2021, 7:18 AMM+5.97%^GSPC-0.25%Macy's Inc. stock rose 6.5% in Tuesday premarket trading after the department-store retailer reported first-quarter earnings that beat expectations and raised its full-year guidance. Net income totaled $103.0 million, or 32 cents per share, after a loss of $3.6 billion, or $11.53 per share, last year. Adjusted EPS was 39 cents, ahead of the FactSet consensus for a loss of 39 cents. EPS and adjusted EPS in 2019 was 44 cents. Sales of $4.71 billion were up from $3.02 billion last year and ahead of the FactSet consensus for $4.36 billion. Digital sales growth was 34%. Comparable sales rose 62.5% on an owned basis and were up 63.9% on an owned-plus-licensed basis. The FactSet consensus was for a comparable sales increase of 44.9%. For full-year 2021, Macy's is now guiding for sales of $21.73 billion to $22.23 billion, up from $19.75 billion to $20.75 billion previously, and adjusted EPS of $1.71 to $2.12, up from 40 cents to 90 cents previously. The FactSet consensus is for sales of $20.66 billion and EPS of 85 cents. Macy's stock has rallied 70.3% for the year to date while the benchmark S&P 500 index is up 10.8% for the period."
"With a stimulus passing and the holiday shopping season getting closer I see this stock getting to around $12/share.But even without a stimulus passing I see this stock breaking $7/share and possibly getting close to $8/share with a little bit of a short squeeze.My point is the longs will win either way, at this point it’s just a question of how much will we make and how soon.I’m personally long on 3K shares at a $5.90 average.Now for those who have been holding long for an extended period and have an average price of $15+, good luck but I don’t see this stock reaching levels like that again for at least a year."
"Dumped all my shares today. If it drops I'll buy back, if it doesn't, I won't."
HEADING to $18.50 !!!!!
loooooool Macys is going to keep going up tomorrow most likely XDDDall in since 4.98 here comes my first million
"Eric, and ninji put every NICKEL they had from their accounts to short this last evening, at 9 dollars a share...Tell me, especially ERIC, how did that work out for ya--Chump? i'm laughing AT YOU......next time you wanna flap your jaws about M going BK, remember THIS LESSON.....remember it WELL."
"Inverted head and shoulders, reversal to the downtrend since 6/8. 6 was bottom, cover and go long, this will hit 7.50 before any consolidation. M Long!"
As long as they don't cancel the dividend;I stay short .There is no money to pay dividends when you have a giant mountain of debt.
How many of those trillions end up being spent at Macy's spring sales event?
"Nordstrom opens women's flagship 57th & Broadway Manhattan, New York. Manhattan is already their Biggest New York City online Buyer Market. lol"
"I say Macy‘s will close green today. After yesterdays +6% some folks already want/need to cash in. I‘m definitely staying for double-digits. And with stock I have all the time of the world. According to yesterday: Macy‘s will survive, financing and reopening of all stores on track, plus the very likely and hefty short-squeeze i am betting on. Whatever it takes.........."
"People have been imprisoned all year, online shopping will be gone once people are allowed to leave their cells. LOL"
Yacktman Asset Management Lp who is this institution and why they bought 20 million shares last quarter?
impressive turnaround but no short squeeze. yet
The street is only beginning to tap into the new Macy's -- leader of the online/in store fashion business.
"The model is no longer internet vs brick and mortar. Its the two together. Macy's is moving on track by shutting down unprofitable stores, and bringing up to speed its on line presence. The virus gave all a chance to get in ultra cheap. Buy."
"Well, looks like it's ready to be shorted back down now."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIWR66o2ovk
the debt restructuring wont be able to stand up to the sequential decline in revenue. XMAS will be the knockout blow
what time is the share holders meeting tomorrow ?
"Hard not to see it as a strong buy. I mean, the price/sales is now 0.2. That's got to be among the best for mid-cap stocks."
Bought some puts at 16.9. Went up too high too fast.
"Everybody forget that M is going to do $3 per share this year, while upgrading their stores and their formats?"
Today confirmed Fridays buy signal. In with a stop loss order.
Sales 5billion. Net profit. 60mill...1 percent. Lots and lots of room to cut costs and drive profit up!!
My wife was at a near by mall yesterday. She said that it was swamped with shoppers. She was in the Eileen fisher store and a woman dropped in looking for a particular garment which they didn’t have. After an extended computer search the clerk said that she could try Macy’s. She said that she came from there with no luck. Eileen fisher merchandise has been picked over and gone from stores.
"Don't sell, get rich."
big move up coming soon
"Target (TGT) should consider owning a piece of Macy's just to collect the 10% annual dividend, and use the proceeds to buy-back its shares!"
This stock isn't going up until they announce the closing of 250 to 300 stores. Hopefully they will not wait until Jan. of next year to make this announcement.
Online sales busted it out. Cheapo stock over $20? You bet.
"Now that those 15,000 call 11 contracts are expired M can go higher. No high open interest until Jan."
 FUNDING COULD JUST BEPRE-BANKRUPTCY FUNDINGBE CAREFUL KIDS
Macy can pop 20% today with few good news. Good luck 
Macy's is totally undervalued now.
"Stubborn shorts don't want to realize the picture has changed...the virus' days are numbered. Secondly, Macy's withstood the worst of it and now has a better crick and mortar landscape to compete in, not to mention a far better online experience. Buy. Going up so more."
Amazing Wayfair makes NO money and its twice the market cap of Macy's
"Is this company in a better condition than a year ago? If no, today's peak is a pure speculation.$15 target reached in 2 trading days. Pretty quick, isn't it? Are we going to test other targets tomorrow? What they they are, by the way? $10? Or maybe even $6?"
Short squeeze and massive buying opportunity. Completely undervalued. My opinion but of course.
mark my words. this is the next gamestop. this has a lot of shorting and the market cap is about a quarter of their annual revenue forecasts. dillards is at about half of their annual revenue for market cap so is nordstroms. this has much higher room to run than the others considered to be peers.
"tarrifs or no tarrifs, this company is absolutely undervalued with great mobile and online experience. good merchandise and sales unlike competitors Kohls JCP and Nordstrom"
I dont buy all the doom and gloom. Macys is profitable. There dividend is 50% covered. There assets are worth more than current market cap. Of course thats not good enough. Greed will push this further down in the short term..
Macy's has put itself in the same position as BBBY..the activists come out and take a stake and start demanding change!! Macy's could go from $24 to $40 in a blink of an eye
I get my Covid vaccine within the next two weeks! First thing is Macy's baby!
the Corp Tax cut was not given back to employees in most of retail. This will now show up in profit!
"KSS, JWN, GPS down almost 4% each. Yet, M is climbing. There is still so much room on the upside."
"Real upgrades have to come soon, can't keep M in the doghouse forever. Too many haters equals SQUEEZE at this point."
like a famous short on this board says take note of lower lows . . . well here comes higher highs
Macys going Higher like the Macys 4TH of July Fireworks For our First Responders Thank You
"Macy's 52 week high of $41, was last year on December 8th..."

Going to get real quiet in here as longs panic.
"Super cheap here with a massive dividend and low P/E and P/B. Why is Macy's trading so much cheaper to competitors like Dillards, Nordstrom, Kohls, etc???Tariff risk, sure, but everyone is facing the same outcome. Amazon risk? I doubt it. Who wants to order clothes before trying them on? Revenues have been flat for 10 years, but better than a 50% decline like the stock price has been implying."
"It's getting to where they can't hide it anymore, retail sales growth ACCELERATING for the first quarter this year. Put that in your pipe and smoke it media..."
"David is a visionary, and where is the sage Tom? I need M to dip a little lower and then I am back in!"
"Robert aka Nomansky, Vortex etc. bought this stock above $40 and lost a fortune and now thinks the best way to deal with that loss is to name call and pick on people who are just now getting into the stock. He knows absolutely nothing about how this market works and should be ignored."
Love having this stock. They have money and stores are opening. The public is so ready to be set free. Pandemic severity hoax needs to stop!!!
So sales y/y still dropped but the stock goes up ... what a fail lmao
"Given the size of the short trade here, any positive outlook on Thursday could double us. Buy."

No way this is only a 2 billion worth stock. Easily should be worth 10 billion.
wow I'm glad I'm was buying
"With 11 store closures in 2018, sales and revenue held up better than expected. Double digit gain from on line sales."
Beautiful close. Now the fun begins...
"News Alert: According to acclaimed Dr Zaius, Amazon (AMZN) is preparing to acquire Macy's (M) to expand brick and mortar market presence and sees the present as the perfect time."
Buy Buy Buy now !!!
this better rally to 20 really quick
Macy's cutting costs and headcount? This will make it a more attractive target acquisition for Amazon. Mmm..
The tech sector bubble is slowing deflating now that they realize that their enemy number one was the only thing protecting them from overzealous and tax revenue hungry European Legislators. We may also see a lot of new regulation on the sector even though they were very friendly to the Biden campaign. Big money are moving from the tech sector into consumer discretionary now.
Shorts are in for lots of losses Macys stock going forward.Nightmare scenario ahead!
"What a great way to end the day. Its been in the making for the last couple of months. Some had $3 target, some was just plain annoying with constant bashing of the stock. Congratulations to the longs. Shorties better cover..."
I’m adding more on the dip today!
"Paying down debt, expanding macys.com and new store concepts continues. Debt is down far enough for private equity to jump in. Will be interesting to see what transpires. Long and strong."
trading at only 3 times last year sales: Rebound to $16's as we come out or Covidhttps://www.trefis.com/stock/m/articles/497898/can-macys-turnaround-help-it-get-back-to-16-levels-post-covid/2020-09-11
Scary times are here again.
Wow this is incredible. I invested in Macy’s at $5 hoping I’d get lucky and sell it at $6. Wow! I can’t believe where it is right now. Macy’s will definitely recover strong from Covid
bought here... will buy options under 16.50
"Buy it in mid $20s, sit back, and take the $1.52/yr dividends -- next one in a month+."
Dont be surprised to see Macys up 50 percent one morning when you wake! This stock is going to soar!
JCP and forever 1 and niemen Marcus BK will be huge gains for Macy's
Macy's success with Story and Backstage could predict a PE deal based on its real estate. Separating the stores might now be a viable and profitable option for a buyer.
Heading to $18 plus !!!!!BUY all that you can!!!!
macy's will easily hit 22.50 by xmas. great buying opportunity.
like Donald Trump said why are we letting the post office deliver Amazon packages for free. and the rest of the world suffer time to text Amazon
"Hard to pass up at this price, added to my position."
Buying Macys stock at this price is like having your own minting press! It's like being a loan shark charging 270 percent annual interest!
Jcp pain is Macy's gain
"Let's review here, we have a trade deal signed, that was supposed to cost consumers billions of dollars and retailers billions in sales, that didn't happen nor will it. Macy's reported good numbers, better than guidance would have indicated. Meanwhile, LBrands a company that reported poor numbers and lowered guidance but is being pumped by B of America, M Lynch and Wells Fargo is up five percent today. The tech sector which has already been pumped to astronomical levels is still being pumped because of the trade deal. I don't think the analysts could be in the pockets of the big money boys anymore than they are. Goldman places a 12 dollar target on Macy's, yet three analysts come out with major upgrades of LBrands. Makes absolutely no sense."
What does Macy's have to do to increase sales or with brick and mortar is there no model that will work in this age of on line shopping?
Market selloff gained steam and muted or action for the time being.
A jump to $10. Screaming buy at the value.
$150 coming soon. Let’s squeeze the life out of shorts!
No need to reopen the 125 stores they were planning on closing over the next 3 years. Sell off the real estate and develop the NYC building into hi-rise showplace. Ecommerce is still profitable during the shutdown.
Here comes the dividend volume.
"It’s looking good so far guys! Two days in a row of positive gains in a generally negative market days. That’s impressive, and I hardly get impressed easily."
"With PE ratio below 6, profits going up, yield over 5%..sky is the limit for this stock.."
shorts pushing it down today but the fundamentals don't justify selling so they are just climbing in the oven again so we can roast them tomorrow
What happen now
Stop! Don't sell! Its a game...that the shorts can't win!!!
"NEW YORK (CBSNewYork) – Macy’s Inc. confirmed this week the company plans to build a skyscraper above its flagship Herald Square store in Manhattan. News May 2019 ! Macy's is going up!According to Bloomberg News, the retail giant is looking to capitalize on the Midtown real estate market with a 1.2 million-square-foot building. Hey Barney come back!"
BOYS....THE RISE IS ON. SMART INVESTORS KNOW THE SELLERS HAVE LEFT THE BUILDING!!!!
"Rising robust earnings, huge assets in real estate, and a generous dividend are seeds for a much higher price. Buy the dipper."
Don’t panic this has to do with the federal reserve it’s not about M will bounce right back up
We need a national sales tax on online sales to save the brick and motor stores and level the playing fields.
shorts better cover! reopened stores are crushing it! along with online sales!!
It‘s rebound time!!! Come on M..... squeeze the shorts!!!
"We will see how the sales report comes out, but I have the impression that Macy´s stock is positioning itself to be a turn around story for 2018. Having lost 70% of its value and with 70 MM shares sold short, it won't take to much for this stock to skyrocket past 25 before the end of the year."
"I'll be glad when this earning report is over with, for Pete's sakes I hope it does something. Either go up to $30 or go down to $17 would be better than the way this thing has acted lately...."
"I am only a tiny bit ahead on this stock. I will unload all of my holdings very soon. Reason being, I called over an issue w an online order. An assistant in some foreign country answered. The individual was near impossible to understand, kept repeating what I just said back to me as opposed to answering the question, and merely ended up telling me to try to place the order again - later!! I tried the next day, same result, I called again, and when I asked to speak to someone in the US that could actually assist me - they hung up!!!! I called back, asked directly to speak to someone in the US and they told me that they did not have the capability of transferring me to the US!!! After going around and around, being passed off to this person and that, and put on hold each time, I and FINALLY ended up talking to someone in the IT department, and was instantly able to resolve the problem. Macy's will not survive - ANY entity that can offer actual streamlined customer service located IN THE US will knock them out of the park - and probably buy their many properties for pennies on the dollar."
"Topped up position at 10,000 shares on Friday. Expect a minimum of 25% by year end plus a $0.3775 dividend"
How can wayfair be valued so high compared to Macy which is in much better shape ????
Market has it wrong on Macy's. The co. will emerge better equipped to deal online with less mall competitors. Seize the moment and buy.
Macy's is going up to $17+ possibly close to $18 by friday... mark my word!
"J, did you happen to read the entire story? Of course not, you are a typical impulse reader, it takes way too much time to actually do due diligence. One of the woman that they were interviewing was discussing the situation with a long time, independent drug store that had been in business long before the department store that Macy's inherited when they bought Federated was also closing due to the horrible crime problems and homelessness issues. Based on what Starwood paid for the upper floors, this means that Macy's will probably net closer to 75 million dollars for two floors in a town that is going the way of San Francisco and the Black Plaque. Macy's is wise to focus on suburbs and higher end niches rather than trying to emulate their New York City stores on the West Coast. The West Coast is a turd show and everyone but the uber liberals know this, why fight the undeniable trends."
I can swear that there is some entity out there that is buying every possible stock. you can see that on your platform.
If The Gap and old navy will be separate companies maybe macys can do the same thing with BLOOMINGDALES?
"$ 22 open, close around $ 25"
It's so hard for this thing to stay above $16.
Next year it will be Amazon's parade where all the balloons look like boxes.
I just started going out to shop again. My #1 place to buy clothing is Macy's.
"People are so fed up with being told to stay home. Everyone, and mean everyone wants to be set free.We are so done with hiding at home and shopping online.Americans want to go out breath the air of freedom and stretch their legs and go to the malls and enjoy the fun of being free shopping at beautiful fun places like Macys."
M bagholders have been warned many times:cancel the dividend and lower your debt.
"I have to say Macy's gas real good sales on RL, Nautica., Helfinger, London Fog, etc., etc.. Almost steals.Now is the time to get in there and look around. I just bought a ton of stuff there. - I don't like shopping either btw but it is what it is."
big news after hours.........wait 4 it!!!!!!!
Oh Lord one things for certain this puppy will either go up or down on Monday
"This will turn around soon. Big things on horizon. Back to $40 soon. Big influx of cash=big plans, bright future."
Praying for a buyout is a bearish position.It means that you think a buyout is the best price which you will get.
Just the beginning of a long upward trend!! Enjoy and soon we will have our dividends restored too. Grossly undervalued stock!!
Going to 25 by March next year
"Getting 100 cents on da dolla on that stolen inventory that was going for 30 cents on da dolla, ay fish?"
"Hopefully Macy's is taking this moment in time to drastically sharpen its prowess online. This could be a good thing, if not great."
6.7 reached
Incredible profits for the patient long stock holder of Macys as the short bomb explodes.
Getting some practice for the really big gain tomorrow!!!! These retailer just print money!!!
Last chance to buy under 7
Still have a longggggg way to go until we hit fair value!
"Short term it will be between 15 and 25. But I see M as a long term value play. Once they start dividends back, this will go much higher from where it is now."
safe to assume tomorrow is another 20% day lol.
LOL OK SHEEP I WILL MAKE MY CALL. WE GO HIGHER TOMORROW! I LIKEY ALL THIS NEGATIVE MARKET SENTIMENT. M BEEN HERE 90YRS WILL BE HERE ANOTHER 90 IMO!
I'm missing something here and need your HELP.Why are these other high end retailers doing pretty good and Macy's so poorly?I just bought 500 shares the other day because of the dividend and hoping for a turnaround within a year or so. Of course I realize that may be dropped.Oh yes I hold stocks for a minimum of one year.
"With retail failing even before the virus, Macy's real estate is not worth nearly what you think it is."
"Well at 3:59pm when Macy’s was trading at $5.7 there was one huge transaction of 1.2K Call Contracts of April 17 $6 CALLs For $0.07. After hours Macy's is up by $.35 cents or so. Tomorrow Macy’s should be trading at $7. Some frigging lucky guy will have made $120,000 from selling his CALL he bought just for $0.07 a share."
"hope today was the bottom and consolidation and it's green tomorrow, business has stabilized..they are expanding backstage, blue Mercury doing well+ real estate.. PE of 5 and 7% dividend. why so low ..enough positive to shrug off prevailing negative sentiment!"
Nomansky been talking for the last 2 months. all stocks except tech are down. Things will be better tomorrow.
Macy's is going to rocket in the next month. Everyone I talked to was shopping there over the past month! There is a strong likelihood of beating earnings expectations significantly imo!!!!
This is the stock of 2020
What have the people who were most negative towards Macys been doing? Answer: shorts have reduced from 120 million to 50 million. That speaks loudly!
"In recent decades, department stores have essentially morphed into apparel stores, as they shuttered or shrunk departments like electronics or home goods (among others) and filled those spaces with apparel. Yet shoppers have pulled back on their discretionary spending on apparel as casual wear has become more acceptable in the workplace, and at events like religious services and life milestones like weddings. Plus, when they do spend on apparel, they tend to favor low prices, and frequent discounters like mass merchants or off-price stores. Deloitte: In 1987, the average consumer allocated 5.9% of their spending to apparel and services, but by 2017, that had plummeted to 3.1%. $M $JWN $JCP $KSS. lol"
"Hate to say it, but I had to buy once it hit 25.50, was going to hold off until closer to earnings, but at that price, the dividend is pushing REIT levels and I believe that making 4 dollars a share and paying out only 1.51 a share makes their dividend a lot more secure than any of the REITS to include AI and NLY. I think the downside is really limited here, maybe as low as 24 but it will be back to the 30 mark by earnings."
"Lots of volume this morning. I am in a hold position to $28.00, looking at a march sale.Dividends are still good at 7.67%. This is a retirement stock, for income earnings. Shorts are trying to drag it down, it will not fall. Shorts will get burned in the next 3 months."
Trimmed 25% of my holding w/ big profits so prudent to trim and still hold 50k shares. With relative strength index above 70 and options expiration max paint at $15 think some short term weakness so ibought the June 20/15 put spread and sold 2022 20 calls to protect my remaing position.
"A good reason to buy M is the negative $12.68 they made in 2020. Of course haters want to hate so buy more M. There over 10% dividend is gone. What they have is a shell game of find the truth from forward looking statements. Their business model is broken. hence the $500 million in junk bond sales this month. Common share holders are at the bottom for pay back after bankruptcy. M needs activist investors to force the selling of three corporate jets and closing of the Puerto Rican stores, which make no money. Of course trust in the CEO, which makes over $10 million."
"Wow, so many optimistic articles about Macy's! I would sure hate to be short this stock. I would recommend that all shorts cover before they take it in the shorts and get tared and feathered tomorrow."
"Today's earnings reports were very good, and they are going to help the broad market move up strongly, towards the year end rally, IMO. This is one of my catalysts for M's, as there is a strong possibility M's will be moved higher with the market, IMO. Buy M's before it gets going above $16/share and enjoy a healthy dividend as you gain PPS points, IMO. Please do your own due diligence and don't listen to short sellers that spew FUD and try to scare you out of a very underpriced stock. They will cover before long because they don't want to pay that dividend while the stock rises. It is really crazy to stay short here with the risks so large, IMO. The extreme short interest here represents about 25% of the float. That is the only reason the PPS has gotten so low, and it is them who got CS to do the recent hit piece on M. Ignore the shorts and the FUD and do your own analysis. Institutions are going to clobber these shorts at the first sign that M's is doing okay."
Trading doesn’t have to be about losing all the time. It doesn’t have to be about letting the markets pummel you day in day out. Fight back with (http://Rightpicker.com). Beef up your defenses and join them.
"What would he price be for Macy's be if it matched the industry average?Please do the math. Note: Macy's has a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 7.40, compared with 17.90 for the industry."
Going to be a wonderful day!
I liquidated my BAC position today and just bought M with the gain instead. I love such days !!
Soon no one will want to sell their shares of Macys!!! Huge short position in Macys will have to be bought back at PREMIUM PRICES!! Bad for shorty good for us!!
It’s great that there going to raise 5 billion the way they are doing it. Great opportunity here. Will sell in a few years my 4000 shares just bought at 4.80
Watch the big Move up at 2:00
"Not exactly sure why an American retailer with little exposure to Chinese consumers and Chinese produced goods would actually be impacted negatively by trade war talk, even though it is merely banter. This on top of being at fifty two week lows and quickly pushing into multi-year lows. This on top of the lowest unemployment in fifty years, improving retail sales numbers and the list goes on and on. I think it would be reactionary to do anything to attempt to jump start the stock price, I think you let your earnings speak for themselves. Until the company can show that they are still relevant to the American brick and mortar or even the on-line environment the price will not improve substantially. Financial engineering at the end of the day is usually very short lived if there are underlying issues and holding onto cash to help modify those issues could be paramount. If the stock price as I believe as well is being manipulated by the big money boys and girls, buying back stock will also have limited impact, to overwhelm the coordinated attacks of the big money machine it will take improving metrics not stock buy backs."
"They just sucked up million shares cheap in the last 30 minutes. I think they can do it all day long on this low volume. Then they will sell put and call options and make a fortune keeping it flat for the next few weeks. Same old game, every day, every week, every year. Long term direction will be up."
Never short a company when the price is already low.
Market underestimating what Trumps is doing for brick & mortar. Continue to buy below $25.

se
A lot of institutions sold out of Macy's.6.01 USD is holding quite well today.Is there any new lockdown?
There is no chance for M not to make it ! M is a trademark in the states. I am certain it will grow fast in the years to come
M IS A COILED UNDER VALUED STOCK WE NEED A WHALE INVESTOR ANY NEWS THIS STOCK ROCKETS
Macy's was upgraded TODAY by Atlantic Equities according to Benzinga.
Macys stock will rise back to pre covid prices soon - $20- 40/share
What a good buying opportunity here. 4+% dividend. Can't go wrong with this. Will hold until $40+
I shop at Macy's. The store traffic is growing. I'm in!
Last earnings they exceeded and raised guidance. Sounds like a solid bet to exceed again today.
Nice Macy's skit on SNL 14 DEC 19. Free publicity.
All 775 Macy‘s reopen by mid June the latest. Can‘t wait to shop till you drop:-)
"It is interesting, starting to see more positive articles on this then it starts a downward move again. Still should be a good long term investment but how long will longs have to wait?"
"The way the stock is acting today, I bet we see good earnings."
Guys.. do you sometimes feel that if you post something that is close to the truth that your message gets removed?
9s this week. -15% after Black Friday last year. Worsening financials. More debt. Vaccine already placed in share prices. Monday needs to be a Green Day or this is going way down
Just bought some more. Any dip in M is just too compelling.
Shorties gettin squeezed like
They trashed RL yesterday even though they blew numbers out of the water. The market makers are still doing everything in their power to convince the small retail investor that there is justification for the drops in the market and that the economy really isn't exploding even though all economic data supports that fact.
"I don't mind receiving income, but I would rather see Macy's cuts dividend to repurchase stock. Still waiting for the company to defend their stock."
"Macy’s like Coca Cola , not going away"
Short cover what u can u still have Monday ..Macy’s is gona beat their ER with 28% ..most retail jumped so high after Christmas
This stock is undervalued more than I realized. Earnings are getting better every day vs lowered expectations. Just in now 2K shares in AH. Gl to all we see 2moro AM.
MACY's is a $20 plus STOCK!!!!!
Thinking Buffet should buy this before it goes back up to 70.
"10% dividend, hilarious. I wouldn't care if it paid a 20% dividend. All the excuses on here, meanwhile if you took two seconds to research Macy's social media you'd see the problem. Customer service. Jeffy poo can say China, tariffs, inventory, etc all he wants. Poor customer service. That's why it will never do anything, ever. The one thing you have as leverage over the customer that doesn't want to shop online and you screw that up, good job..."
Coronavirus pandemic raises concerns that some retailers will run out of cash https://www.marketwatch.com/story/coronavirus-pandemic-raises-concerns-that-some-retailers-will-run-out-of-cash-2020-03-25?siteid=yhoof2&yptr=yahoo
Is the options market predicting a big spike for Macy‘s? Oh yes! See todays article in Zacks. Strong buy at this low level! You heard it here first.......... Short-squeeze will be epic............ EPIC!
M has a price trajectory of $20
"Macy's real estate properties have significant value (pre-market $5,23):https://finance.yahoo.com/news/valuation-macys-properties-170952570.htmlThis Thursday preliminary Q1-sales numbers, followed by fireside chat with JP Morgan. Go Macy's (M) go!"
"It seems that a lot of people here are in Macy's for a quickie. They bail the moment they see a few hundred dollars loss. This works well for shorties. You need to keep this stock for a few weeks to realize a return because of the short volume. Shorties wouldn't have anywhere to go, if you held it a few more days."
45k contacts at $10 expiration 6/12. open interest as of Friday was 3.9k. let that sink in. go M
"Good report. Finally same store sales posted 1% growth, so the brick & mortar part of the business is stabilizing, meanwhile mobile is growing double digits. Cutting costs in 300 million and anticipating earnings in the upper end of its previous guidance. Looking strong to me. Will add some shares today."
This is an easy $20 stock. Should reach there this week or the next the latest.
"Keep holding it down, shorts, while us longs keep adding. M is going to have one of the biggest short squeeze in history."
Those that were shorting M at 4.80 and keeping outstanding shorts at nearly 50% how does that 80% pop feel? Not bad compared to what's gonna keep coming!
Will be at $15 before next earning. If it beats then will be a huge jump so keep your fingers crossed.
The shorts attacking now have so much skin in the game that have lost all objectivity. Thanks for the cheaper shares.
Closing stores is a smart business decision considering those effected will still shop at macys.com. Great to see the board understands the principle cutting expenses while leaving revenues in tact.
"M is $5,11 (+6,24%) in pre-market........ who sold yesterday for a loss? Go Macy‘s go! Let‘s squeeze the shorts with a vengeance....... whatever it takes......."
"So we have flat number of covid cases for around two weeks already. Not going up, not going down. It seems like third wave will start by the end of April. In NYC probably it is already started. Vaccinations will help, but to believe that pandemic will be over soon is just a wishful thinking."
Anyone else notice that on Down Days @Nomansky is here and on Up Days he uses other accounts @Robert
why didn't Macys partake in the rally today?seriously considering buying some here!
Inflation does not bring buyers
"M was spending significant money to improve customer experience in top stores which hurt profits and margins. That program is completed, so that cost will not continue to reduce profits, and to the contrary, now is expected to improve same story sales comparisons.Other cost cutting initiatives are under way that involved increased productivity with updated software, better inventory management at store level, some changes to lower operating costs, and further pay down of $3B debt to cut interest costs. If they can afford to do some share buy backs, they also will reduce dividend costs. They are working on a cost reduction play which likely will close weak stores and reduce employee counts.The cumulative effects of cost reduction s is going to bring much higher margins and profits. When the market sees the PPS start going up, it will reward M by extending it's PE, at least back to 10, on, hopefully, $4/share profits. That seems to be their plan, it it appears to be very doable and realistic over the next 12 months or so.The dividend should hold up during that time without problem, and FCF should be growing increasing their ability to pay it."
"id say there's a lot meat on these bones, a lot of meat. about $6 worth still."
"Macys bond offering MAY be completed by 2021. So they may be able to pay off debt with more debt, using realestate as collateral. What are their options left after this failure? They even want to use inventory as collateral. Inventory that already took a $350M mark down. This company is desperate and it shows."
"Wow, look at the share volume trading. Pretty wide base, would have loved to see it higher. Can't imagine anyone selling at this point."
"Today I was looking at times and saw a lot, a stream of small transactions that kept the shares going up.Thanks."
Credit cards up and Running Just called Macy’s customer serviceIt’s a little hick up but they have 36 days to make up some lost sales from yesterday!!We all agree that things are not perfect and peachy in Macy’s land or else we won’t be at $21.00.....hopefully no more screw ups or Wall Street will have no Mercy comes Earning day .
"I'm about 30% down on this, held for months - come a decision today. I'm adding more. This stock has been troubled, but is 100% more likely to go to $12 than bankrupt, run some numbers and see the risk is worth the reward"
"Closing 125 stores and only losing 1.4B in revenue isn't bad at all. Basically 20% reduction for 5% less revenue, those stores had to be losing money so it's quite good they are making a sizable cut this time."
Buy buy buy
This is a comparatively good day for Macy's.I'm thinking maybe they should throw a parade.
"Out of the 16 sell-side analysts that cover Macy’s, six rate the stock a Sell, nine see it as a Hold and one rates it a Buy."
I have deep sources in the M organization (janitors and stock personnel mainly) and they all tell me that M is in trouble. Forklifts don't run well and mops are not being replaced in a timely manner. Please keep this information secret since it might cost the jobs to the brave whistle blowers that provided it.
"Why buy Gold when MACY's Golden Prime-REAL-ESTATEs around the biggest, most expensive Cities, ie, NYC Manhattan, Brooklyn, SFransisco, Chicago, Atlanta, Miami, LA, Everywhere, to name a few in the world, gives you 10% Dividend, and it has $25 BILLION Revenue (debt is LESS than 30% of REVENUE, very easily manageable).. PRIME-REAL-ESTATEs are much better than Gold, on top of that 10% DIVIDEND??. Just my humble 2 cents, leave a comment, thoughts, thumbs up..By the way, ONLINE is never a substitute for in-person see, feel, try SHOPPING for CLOTHING. Anything else I can understand, but clothing, you have to see, feel the quality, real colors, textures. Build a SKYSCRAPER condos/office space on Manhattan, NYC Herold-Square, it will fetch $$BILLIONS.."
"Macy's shouldn't have lowered expectations in January. Stock should recover its $5 drop. Won't happen like it did on the way down, but it will. Buy."
Today is a GIFT up 10% on a 600 point down day.
"This is interesting.Macys shakes off analyst downgrade11:35 AM ET 12/9/19 | Briefing.comShares of department store retailer Macy's (M 15.43, +0.28, +1.8%) are outperforming today in an otherwise flat market. That outperformance is remarkable because it flies in the face of Goldman Sachs downgrading the stock to Sell from Neutral and slashing its price target to $12 from $17.Strikingly, Macy's has already exceeded its average daily volume less than two hours into the trading session. That heavy volume and the positive turn in the stock on a seemingly negative development are likely byproducts of the following factors:Investor belief that the Goldman Sachs analyst isn't breaking any new ground with the basis for the downgrade (secular headwinds weighing on comps and profitability). Shares of M were down 49% for the year before today's downgrade.Short-covering activity, which is often triggered when a beaten-up stock makes a counter-intuitive move.Momentum trading as speculators see an opportunity to force a short squeeze.Macy's is the picture of a tax-loss selling candidate, but the flip side of that understanding is that many tax-loss selling candidates are seen as good, bargain-hunting opportunities after the tax-loss selling is complete. The stock's resilience to selling interest today is apt to be helping its candidacy as a short-term, speculative rebound play."
"When JPM had target $13, M already moved to $20+. Now JPM raised to $15, M will go to $22+!!! Sector leader Macy is a winner and will go much higher!!!"
"Macy’s had been my go-to place for years. Its hard for me to get to the nearest store these daze (!), but the online experience is outstanding plus the benefits of being a platinum member are truly fantastic.Soon I’ll be a shareholder too. Long live Macy’s!!!"
"Guys, first of all I want to thank the shorters for their contribution. Without you guys I would have never been able to buy Macy's for 6.02 USD (excl. transaction). What is your vision for the next 20 years if Macy's does survive?*Look at my two Macy's*"
Loaded up for a run to $16...starts tomorrow.
HUGE GREEN BAR coming......
I'm happy for those who held. I sold at 13 but I'm still happy for you folks.I want a dividend tho. That was the deal before all this. - Pete
"Much, much higher is inevitable!Shorts to find themselves shorted.Unlimited losses are the future of short traders!"
"Wow, this thing is looking bad today. I think we are at critical levels of support here. Hoping it doesn't break and we end up back at 21 or 17, wow."
"Bought more on the dip, waiting for $20 then $25 soon."
Panic and sell? You miss out on handsome capital gains going forward.
"M options open interest at the 6 strike puts. 1. Oct 16 13,200 contracts2. Nov 20 19,100 contracts3. Jan 15, 21 11,900 contractsNothing like this on the 6 strike call side means the options market has put a 6 floor on M.Max pain for the Jan 2021 options is 13.Just look at the charts. If this 6 holds means the June, July, Aug, and now Sept 6 are the low."
"The big shakedown, you going to fall for it and give up your shares or know that AGAIN big boys missed out and are making there own opportunity on your FEAR."
"Macy’s is returning employees to work very soon, early June to be exact. Also opening many locations nationwide. My dad is a high up individual within the company and he got word of it. I will be buying shares. This WILL (not should) go up"
See you all at 35!
Macy is the most undervalued stock so far in 2021
Macy's is open for business!
"Money pouring into Macy's and Bllomingdales online and now in-store. Buy, buy, buy!"
"Why it is not going up? Good earnings, lowered debt, expense reduction, dividend payments, positive outlook.. still it is not going up...."
Typical. UP as they move out of tech!! This beaten up stock will return to fair market value in the high 30s!
"in kings plaza Brooklyn New York: JCP almost no shoppers inside, JCP business almost dead, but Macy's have a lot people inside, some division busy, Macy's things a lot more better than JCP, Macy's still #1 high ranking retailers in people's minds, no others can replace it"
"Hmm. A 6.4% dividend yield and a PE of 6. What Macy's needs to do to raise the stock price is announce that it's going to launch a ride sharing service to develop fake meat that you can buy with bitcoins. It will lose billions, but the stock will go up 400%."
I am buying for solidarity with retail investors. Let's fight the mission impossible war against the shorts ...
"Hudson Bay (Saks, Lord & Taylor) going private 45% premium...matter of time Macy's will be either taken private...private equity could buy Macy's and with the elimination of the dividend and possible spin off of Bloomingdales could fund entire transaction and keep the Macy's, Blue Mercury, CC business and the entire Macy's real estate and lease back the Bloomingdale's real estate to new owners"
https://www.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#cases
"Of course the stock price is rising:- clarity on the financials provides visibility to investors; always a good thing- the loss is not nearly as bad as some people suggested- $3B in online sales (customer demand for Macy's hasn't gone away)- stores are reopening and there are more customers pouring in than anticipated- Billionaire investor (as if M does not have various ways to obtain cash/loan? LOL!!!)Now tell me, what are the negatives that you feel will completely negate the turnaround that is in progress and send the share price down to $0???"
"Short Holders, Macy's was a bargain at $18 before Covid. When it dropped I though it was a great deal at $12 then $10, then $8 then $6 and finally stopped buying at $5. It HURT waking up every day to see more pain every day but I accumulated over 30,000 shares. It hurt bad! the drops were unforgiving! Cover your shorts because my hurt is now my reward watching the reverse happen. It won't end you will wake up every day seeing more pain and higher prices on M stock. You had a VERY LONG time to reap your rewards now it's over. Macy's has it's place in retail, it will not leave it has Direct to Consumer business that is growing and had the PERFECT chance to cut stores it was closing anyway. It now feels good to wake up every morning as see GREEN in my portfolio and I will not sell. I hope other longs will take this opportunity to hold on to their shares. I hope hedge funds and others that shorted and shorted and shorted to bring the price down now get what they deserve 100 million shared shorted and no way to cover. SHAME ON YOU!"
what happened to the reddit spike to $21
"before covid they were paying 1.5$ dividend. Now that they are without this burden , they will be able to fix their balance sheet and even pay dividends, even half of it will give at a price of 12 over 6% yield . Covid forced them to do the changes needed faster than expected. In a way that will help them to become stronger than before."
we'd have probably gone higher with market had the CEO not shown up on CNBC.
Whole economy is reopening. People are sick of staying and shopping at home. Once everyone is out they will be buying and want to relive the outdoor retail experience again. With summer approaching it makes it an even more ripe opportunity for Macy's to thrive. July 4th fireworks here we come!
when is the day you have to own the stock to get the dividend if anyone can answer please
New stimulus- people cannot buy houses and cars- but definitely small purchases - Macy’s should benefit.

Jim Cramer mentioned buying Macy's if you think turnaround is coming post vaccine! Massive short squeeze possible!
never seen stock down 9 percent on someone else's earnings lol
"M capex was too much too fast. Building out 200+ backstages and 150 Growth Store renovation within 2 years is no small project. Could have slowed down a bit so management could better focus on the core business more effectively and used half that capex to continue and pay sown debt. I mean over 3B within 3 years is alot. I'd be okay seeing about 75 growth stores done and 100+ Backstages completed for 1.5B. The other 1.5B could have dropped the debt level down near the 3B mark currently and theit EBITDA would now be in the 2.5-2.9 ratio WITHOUT asset sales therefore any future proceeds could be used to immediately buyback shares within the company's own guidelines. But o well, if Macy's doesn't have a blowout Christmas and a beat they better not keep dumping into Capex bc as an investor i would bail, bc 3B and 200+ backstage and 150 growth us enough to show sizable progress and if it does not it probably means it's not working and they should immediately continue to focus on debt reduction and perhaps some share repurchases. If they do that atleast M has a shot to be debt free within a reasonable few more years before things really fall off the cliff. Then atleast shareholders would be left with a company with massive real estate holdings and virtually no debt. Pretty sure shareholders okay with that. And even if M will eventually make less profit i don't see it taking losses anytime soon and they could also cut the nearly 500M dividend to 0 and get that debt paid off. Then we'll see how much investors will value M then with 0 debt."
open over $10

"If you really want to make money get your shares of M why it's down this morning , before it start climbing higher . More than likely will be Green today and by a lot. Shorty's trying to cover so Shorty doesn't have the dividend taken out of his account."
Short covering rally could be immense.

Shopping at the malls and brick and mortar is fun. Just went shopping last night. It is so much fun being out and about! Cabin fever is at a peak in the USA as never before. Watch the flood fill the malls and stores aftercovid is dead. 2021 will be a record year for the malls!
"MACY'S already paid down over 2B of debt in the past few years. All they had to do was instead of spending over 3B (over 1B this year alone) on capex they should have spent 1.5B on capex and another 1 on debt reduction and 500M on share buybacks. We'd be looking at a while different share price today even if sales were to slump a bit more. I don't understand why management rushed to do over 3B in upgrades and capex with so little to show for the results. 1.5B would have been enough to see if there was real results amd continue on a multi year capex instead of a 3 year binge in lieu of holding more cash on hand to tackle debt and buying shares back when jts cheap and yielding over 10%! That being said, with over growth stores and over 200 Backstages i really hope management will relax the capex and use any profits to continue to pay down debt and buying some shares back. BC I'M sorry if 150 Stores + 200 backstages doesn't make a difference now its not going to going forward and best use of funds now is to get debt levels to a point where most investors would feel very comfortable owning the stock. Buybacks wouldn't be so bad either."
"Is there other retailer that has billions of dollars of real estate, I don't recall.... Now, would Amazon need it? Macy's is very speculative, but it is solid more solid than many others, and it is cheap"
Gap up again tomorrow???????
why can they ever just let this sell off?
30$ next week
Where dem shorts at?
"Off Topic:""Judge OKs stock sale for bankrupt Hertz: report""- what do you'all think about that?"
Frankfurt 9 % up !
What is this stock worth?
Retailers are doing very well today so I think this is either short covering in the retail sector or buying in the sector and Macy's is going along for the ride.
"only panic sellers are selling. buy more to average down. this week the whole market is down, not just Macy's. I'll add more, I'm getting 3k shares tomorrow."
"JWN proves that the sector isn't the problem, the management styles of specific companies is. Macy's needs to step their game up."
"I look at many stocks on the board and I see some large exaggerations between the highs and lows for the year. I'm thinking this recession began sometime in January or February, not lately."
Just remember that today's price is what director Paul Varga thinks is a bargain. Hold tight and don't listen to shorts.
New store initiatives really starting to kick in and create great synergies. Buy. Going much higher.
"If you haven't read the Motley Fool article on Macys you'll find M financials are a mess. 4,4 Billion in debt is do-able, but add 3.2 Billion in long term lease obligations, 421 million in over-due rent and 7 Billion rental obligations. M can hide bad financials with EBITDA and GAAP and they're doing it. Why does CEO Gennette sell his 7.5 million in his free M share options every year if he is a believer? M doesn't belong over $10 per share."
I wonder how long they can maintain the high dividend?
The entire retail sector along with airlines/cruise and oil is down today. It’s not that just M is being shorted.
"After Veteran’s Day, that’s the time Macy’s will seriously start getting into beast mode for the holidays. Also, watch the stock price of Macy’s start to dramatically go up as usual as shown in the annual cycle chart."
Market playing options investors every friday
This is gonna be a great day ... celebrate your victory longs Macy’s thanks you for believing
"Markets are so rigged and only get worse, today Bed Bath and Beyond a stock that many thought would be bankrupt right now is now worth more than Macy's."
R.I.P Nomansky. I think we can all assume that 7 is safe and that Macy's has survived successfully the virus. Let's meet again at 14-16.
M should be on par with GAP!!!Come on man..lets hit that 3rd gear and break thru $30 !!!Also CONGRATZ to all longs...
"The report is out, better than expected!"

"In the last five years, M has gone from $60 to $16, and Friday CS downgraded the stocks. Thanks for nothing!"
If this keeps going up will it be added back to S&P500?
sell Manhattan store and buyback shares
"There's been $2B in EBITA lost in 16 months. And the trend isn't reversing. Following the trend we are at $2.25 full year EPS for 2020. During earnings growth the company trades at a 8-12x multiple. Declining earnings, 4-5x multiple. I'm holding until investor day to see how viable their growth initiative is. If they don't reverse; target price $8-13 range. GL"
Cramer bullish on Macy’s
Debt way down to 5.8 billion from 6.7 billion and sitting on 1.4 billion in cash as well as Real Estate assets worth more then market cap..love to see debt get below $5 billion this year..this is a gift at these levels plus throw in the 5.5% dividend

Definition of a short squeeze (pro memoria: Every third share of Macy‘s is sold short):https://www.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_squeezeScript for a savoury short squeeze: Cancel allsell orders and let shorts bid up and up and up - they absolutely need your shares. Plus snag them shares away and buy more and bid up yourself!
Macy's is still one of the only stores I like to shop to buy clothes.
Just got my 125 shares
$18 by end of week.
When and at what level does the dividend return?
"Macy’s Gennette on Digital Sales, Off-Mall GrowthDavid MoinTue, December 1, 2020, 2:43 PM ESTMacy’s Inc. sees digital sales this year accounting for more than 40 percent of its total sales, a big leap from 25 percent in 2019.Additionally, the retailer intends to resume its off-mall strategy involving rolling out more Backstage off-price units and continuing to test the Market by Macy’s format introduced this year. The off-mall strategy was halted due to the coronavirus and all the disruption it has caused. Bloomingdale’s Outlets, where room for growth is seen, is also part of the off-mall strategy."
Men who invest in Macy's would Never Bet 1-cent if they Actually Shopped There. Men's Goldwyn 2.0 Slide Sandals Deal of the Day $90.00 Sale $79.99 Hehehe
Now it is time to buy macy stock because it is down 2% because of people sold stocks after they got dividend. Today is exdividend date. Stock price go down and this is the best time to buy. Kohl (KSS) was up 4% on ex dividend date because wise people buy back stocks on ex dividend date since stock is very cheap on exdividend date. Added 1500 shares.
"Macy's current market cap is approximately half that of it's real estate value of approximately $12b. To confirm what I am saying, please Google ""what is Macy's real estate value""."
fake selloff this AM just ticked green CYA shorty
M beats on both top and bottom line in a very adverse covid environment. We are back on the road to normal huge profits and sales.Great results. Excellent management!
Amazon should bid for Macy's outright. All stock deal instead of cash. Imagine AMZN taking over those stores. It would be Whole Foods 2.0
"cant keep it down today, maybe tomorrow shorty. although.................. id cover............"
JWN AND ROSS REPORTED GOOD EARNINFS A D GUIDANCE JUST NOW....M IS LOSING ..
Short squeeze. It's simple math. Low P/E despite lower revenues eps was able to surprise. We've reached the bottom. Options expiring. Shirts should've stopped being greedy and taken your profits.
omg. futures are up. this thing is going to pop! sorry shorts you're done. hate to be you.
Up 7% next week.
Cramer says Macy's stock should be higher on earnings beat!!!
Macy's possible squeeze like AMC BBBY and GME. Showing a lot strength on the uptrend. Any thoughts?
Close above 16 today. Big dividend coming.
macy's should change cyber monday sale to covid19 monday sale. usa alomost hit 15 million cases world wide #1. all aisia are scaring american peoples of covid19.:(
Shorts must be covering. HOLD!!!!
"M looks like a buy at these levels? Consumer is strong and Christmas season should be enormous.. Amazon taking a bite, but folks still headed out.."
"Nomansky, Robert, Eric (all the same guy), look at the chart, bullish until $12 +from now and in no time, may be after you can short a little..But the trend is up, longs win if they are not panic selling.Cheers"
"The FACT is Macy's will now have the same problem that Sears had. Once fast ED sold the real estate at Sears , Sears lost it's cost advantage because they now had least payments which hurt their margins . Macy has done the same thing by Taking loans out on the real estate which will hurt margins because now they have payments to make that they did not before , They have sealed their own fate of Bankruptcy . The Fact is Macy's is a dying business just a slow death to Bankruptcy"
"Wow, guess it's time to start playing the same game as the big boys because they are doing all the work for you.Buy a bunch of M stock, sell options on it, hone in the stock to max pain every Thur/Friday and take all the money! I have 31,000 shares maybe I should be riding the free wave?Thoughts. A little nervous because I think between now and earnings (on the 18th) big boys may finally push this stock up in the stratosphere."
Strength today may be due to the fact that Macy's just made a Golden Cross when the 50-day moving average crosses the 200-day moving average. This is regarded as an extremely bullish sign for technical followers
"Macy’s at $15 is a steal and paying a safe hefty dividend of 10%. A new good CEO is need, once that happens I see the stock at $35 - $40 if they can show improvement. Pinterest at $18.25 another steal. This stock can be at $45 if they turn a nice profit the next two quarters. With the proceeds of my HOG short... bought 5,000 shares of Macy’s and 6,000 shares of Pinterest. I love this Market. Check out RH... it will go to $300 in a few months. Good luck to all."
"If anyone doubts the pure manipulation of markets by the financial houses you only have to look at Advanced Micro. Morgan Stanley who has been negative on the stock (and truthfully, rightfully so) for nearly two years, suddenly changed from bearish to bullish on it. Even though the AMD processors still do not compete with the Intel processors well in the commercial markets and their GPUs do not compete well with Nvidia GPUs. AMD, a company that has hardly made any money at all, is now being pumped by the same company that has stated that the semi-conductor industry was in the midst of a major inventory correction phase and in a economy where they have been predicting a recession for nearly two years now. Very interesting."
"long-term buy m sure be make huge money, Macy's CEO is very good CEO,"
Tooo many playing about with this stock just hold it thats what the volume and markets say to me right now
46 million short shares paying a 10 % dividend. look for a huge run this Qrt..
M protect your shareholders! Proprietary trade your shares. Sell 3.08 million in the money Put contracts. Borrow $5bil at 2% from Goldman to buy back the float. Keep the 10% dividend for yourself to pay off loan. Sell your buildings of all but 50 top stores to use that cash to buy back shares. Divest in brick. Invest in E commerce. Take care of your shareholders first!
45% of this float short.. are they going to hold and try their luck with earnings tomorrow...Remember AAL when that moved last week..
"I am in it for the long haul. I know all the analysts say that Malls and retail shops like Macys are a thing of the past. But I don't think so. Once this crazy pandemic is over, people will return to shopping in person. And, going to the mall/shopping is a much loved social activity. Sure, everyone is buying online right now. They really don't have a choice...."
this will fly again
"The current CEO is new on the job and is doing excellent job too. When he took over the past CEO recklessly had borrowed over $7 billon in long term bonds to finance an huge stock buy back that caused the stock to soar to around $70/share in the short term but he neglected its CAPEX and stores in general and Macys then was in decline under him, with newly minted heavy debt and sales declines accelerated and the credit agencies downgraded Macys several times due to the crisis that this reckless CEO caused. The new CEO immediately ended the stock buy back plan, and diverted free cash flow to pay off this long term debt and now long term debt is down to only $4 billion and falling quickly. In a few years all the long term debt will be paid off at this rate.Also, the current CEO dramatically upgraded Macys stores, improving sales, merchandise, marketing and he successfully stopped the decline in sales and even for many quarters we saw an increase in sales per store. AS a result of paying off debt and taking a serious stand against debt and stabilizing the sales and increasing net earnings the credit agencies took Macys off the negative credit watch and Macys debt remains investment grade today. I expect Macys will likely see their debt upgraded by the credit agencies if this CEO continues to pay off debt this fast and continues to improve the Macys business.This quarter sales and earnings are going to be much better than expected and combined with the soon to be released 3 year growth plan by this new CEO soon to be released on Feb 5th I expect a huge jump in this stock. Macys is going to be one of the best stocks of 2020 and an a handsome dividend too."
Not enough resources to attack this one. They are busy attacking gme and amc.
why is Dillards dept store up $3 ?
Of the major retailers Macy is a unique situation. They will survive the storm but with a different format than the past. It’s a fact retail is changing but it’s not going away.
M shares will have a major drop soon. Definitely will NOT make it past 25 anytime before May 2017. SHORT IT and do it now.
We could possibly see $18+/_ tomorrow
"Macy's is a manufacturer's haven. Great storefront for a company like Berkshire Hathaway. Hundreds of products with direct access to customer. Like Kirkland to Costco. Except much bigger. The issue is Buffett was so rattled by his Airline investment failure, he is probably going to wait it out. When Macy's recovers, he will have to pay a premium."
Macy's is down 9.08% to 16.17
"Shorts are nervous for a good reason. After tomorrow, stock will never see 9 again. By end of year, it will be $20. Massive short squeeze is brewing."
Macy's building in seattle sell at local real estate for almost 600 milions $It's a good news
stopping short sell would save the market
Strong Buy Macy‘s!!!! Short-squeeze coming up............ whatever it takes ladies and gentlemen! Whatever it takes!!!
"Short term: In spite of all the uncertain news out there, it was nice to see positive volume coming back into M today.We still have two weeks until Christmas and then all of the 'after Christmas sales'. We need is a few days of positiveactivity (and Trump keeping his mouth shut) and we could be back into high 30's by Christmas."
M reached a new 52 Week High at 33.74
All you people saying that Amazon buying Macy’s vould never happen probably said the same thing about Amazon buying Whole Foods which was really an odd acquistion.
Let me guys give you a comparison Ross has 14 million in revenue with gross margin about 25% while M has about 25million in revenue with gross margin of 39%. Ross selling/admin expense is 52% of it gross profit while Macy is 90% of gross profiit. While rost has a growing per share earnings. Macy has earning per share volatility either through issuing some new shares or macy is losing it competitive advantage.Ross has 364.7M outsanding while macy has 308.92M. Ross debt to equity ratio 1.77. Macy debt to equity ratio 2.28. Ross retain earnings about 2.3billion. Macy retain earning is 7 billion. Ross has growing fcf that pass 1.5 billion while macy fcf is around 500mil- 1billion. Macy current prob is that it not growing it earning has more debt to equity that they are currently trying to fix which they have been paying down alot the past few years. It selling/ admin expense is over 90% it should try lower it to 40-30% since it about 2x higher than it competitor. In the end the macy and rost has different comparison. Ross is apparently is growth stock right now while Macy is a value stock. Currently Macy is very undervalue compare to it competitors
I see a Macys and Nordstrom merger creating a monopoly in affordable fashion and luxury ....

"Dow Futures are up. Green day for stocks tomorrow. Hold on tight. I see fireworks. Heading back to $8 soon. Even NY is entering phase 2 and reopening. People are dying to shop outdoors. Less competition means more profits. July 4th fireworks, Thanksgiving parade. America needs Macy's long time! Hea"
Macy's owns most of it's real estate correct?
I believe under one of the new lending facilities announced today Macy’s can issue up to $6B of bonds that an SPV created by the Fed will buy. 4 year term. https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/monetary20200409a5.pdf
Good buying opportunity here!!!
"Pre-market is green:-) $6,66 (+8,12%). Let‘s all continue like yesterday. If we all stay together and act according to the dhort-squeeze-manual/script/playbook we can propel this to double-digits in the blink of an eye. See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_squeeze The important part is NOT to sell and to cancel all sell-orders, but instead to snap shorties shares away with heavy buying. Don‘t forget: They desperately need your precious shares, from a certaint trigger-point on, at almost every price. Big institutionals want Macy‘s going back to double-digits now. After yesterdays financing it is clear that Macy‘s WILL survive. Back to normal, back to double-digits......... Whatever it takes........... spread the word to all your contacts and let‘s go for an epic short-squeeze (almost every third share is shorted, what a feast:-) Act accordingly and this great American icon is in for double-digits again............"
And how does shorting freedom day's ending? he takes lubricant and goes out on the street
"all retailers stock price too low, but their earnings not bad, their margin profit very high, I think buy them sure be make a lot of money."
"Macy's Guidance was weeks ago, but for GS to come out 3 days before Ex Dividend date just says their clients who shorted needs a dip of about 2.5-3% to buyback the shares or pay the dividend on the 12th. Well looks like they got it at the open but the stock quickly rebounded which also appears they bought it back immediately. Over 15M shares traded (that's 1 entire day of volume) in about 1 hour of trading. Guess who was buying.... you can't make this up folks."
Seriously...who would short at this point? Until January what bad news could come out?
Should I buy more at this dip?
"Oh people who shorted the stock this morning.... I feel bad for you. Oh wait, actually I don't."
"If Macy's continue with their large growth from their online platform I think the future is very bright for them and the company is trading at a significant discount. I have used their online sales platform a couple of times recently, it was smooth and efficient, I got great deals and received the items quickly, that is a recipe for success."
Thomson Reuters as reported that the short % is up to 21.828%. Pretty aggressive for a company that still makes a profit.
"I owned KM, SHLD, JCP, Bradlees, KMRT, and followed Montgomery Wards. When a company slashes their SG & A expenses it is a sign the ship is taking on water. How many Macys commercials did you see last December 2019, compared to this last December. A lot less as the A in SG & A is being slashed. Retail needs to advertise to bring in people. The closest Macys to me is almost a two hour drive and I see TV commercials once in awhile now. What a waste of money. M isn't going bankrupt any time soon, but they sold $60,000,000 in assets in 2020 to make numbers. Just what the above mentioned companies did while slashing the SG & A."
"Wow, another 52 week low, smh...Show Jeff the door or you may have to CLOSE the doors!"
Report was positive all the way around the horn. Seems consistency and incremental improvement are now in the house. Makes little sense to be short. Cover time my friends. Buy.
$7.5 billion in available Cash$$$$$...Shareholders meeting was Positive.
"i was previously short this stock realizing gains of a little over $18 average per share.i closed out the position and bought OLED (Shaggy's favorite -not) before earnings and made a bit over $26 per share. Late today I established a long position in Macy's, feeling the retail clomate has strengthened.I am long 8,000 shares looking in to earnings."
Great buying opportunity today :-) Q4 results will be beyond great. Go Macy's!
"Better buy now, 10:45 is not that far away, though they will continue to drive for another half hour."
"I've got 700 shares that I bought between 19 + 20. Let's hope that the report is great, and drives M to the mid-30s."
"Macy's has got to be the stock of the week. For some reason, people are throwing money at this company for reasons I just don't understand. They have closed over 120 stores before this virus and are supposed to close 100 more. But, they say, the have name brands like Hilfiger and Ralph Lauren. I just don't see very many buying $100.00 shirts. Every year foot traffic declines at the Malls, and every year on-line buying rises. The fact that this stock is up to $6.00, shows how much money is on the sidelines to waste. What are these people buying? A Thanksgiving Day Parade?"
"DEM wits thinks M earnings are good just keep taking it higher and it will make for a great short again LOL,LOL,LOL"
We're moving on up...to the east side...in a deluxe apartment...in the skyyyyyy
"Macy’s stock is undervalued considering many factors,Macy’s will have hardly any competition once the economy opens up, the vaccine is at phase 3,As off now, Macy’s has enough capital to last through dec 2021. As well online sales are growing exponentially, Macy’s huge real estate ownership guarantees debt holders full payments and therefore credit is still there.Revenues for the second quarter are much better than expected, huge discounts on old merchandise.All we need is for the analysts to shut their pie holes"
"Retail sector as a whole went up over 10% in the first ten trading days after Christmas last year, of course that was on the back of a very bearish December market, though this year is different for the overall markets, retail as David stated has been very bearish."
"Any purchase now, is an easy 150% gain. Macy's was trading over $40 last Christmas...ignore the Fake News, study the charts, and buy more at a steep discount!"
"if they make 1 billion in profit this year and get a p/e of 15 this can go to 15 billion market cap. The stock tanked due to lockdowns , on the bright side that pushed them to work more on their online presence and the company did what they were avoiding before, do the changes needed. Dont forget that people will always want to shop clothes on store and combining physical and online presence boost sales on both"
Serious question: of all the alternatives available in the investment universe why would anyone choose to be long this stock? If you believe in retail as a viable investment alternative there are a host of better options.
Wow Great earnings going into 4th quarter which will be a blow out season. Great job Macys! Well done!
$30 will be a speed bump. M has big bang potential. New CEO is a major plus.
"BOYS...I SAID ON OCTOBER 20 THAT MACY AT 15.12 WOULD OUTPERFORM AMZN AT 1757.51 OVER THE NEXT YEAR. YAAA, MANY LAUGHED, BUT THEY AINT LAUGHING NOW !!! THE COMPETITION HAS CAUGHT UP, AND AMZN HAS GOTTEN TO BIG TO MANAGE. ITS DEAD MONEY BOYS. LOOK FOR A TRADING RANGE OF 1600-1800 FOR QUITE SOME TIME. PLUS...1500 WILL BE SEEN BEFORE 1900...BANK IT!!!"

"Why are you long/short? Give us some insight into your thinking, maybe we can solve the rubix puzzle together. My reasons for long:- Data showing people are going out more and more- Data showing people buying a lot more in retail stores (+105% in june)- Earnings (adjusted) 700m loss better than my anticipated 1bil loss- Q3 usually being one of the better months - US goverment stepping in to make going out safer (social distancing/masks)- Recent low mortality rate (somehow many young people got it, but survive better)- Their ecommerce has been increasing - Data from EU and China showing uptrends in retail (I also see many stores crowded (not many old people), personally I avoid crowded places)My worries:- New large scale shutdown (if this happens, I'm out.. small lockdowns is not a problem in my opinion)- Sales in Q4 and following still a bit unclear to me- Speed of adapting of Macy's (they could have started sooner imo)- Cost of staff and lease (related to adapting)- Debt ratioOveral I see a chance that Macy's can go bankrupt. However, I think this quarter will provide Macy's with liquidity. If people adjust in US, which is my assumption that they are similar to US and China, then the risk in time will be diminishing.Share your thoughts too, thank you!"

"Trend is your friend! Higher highs, higher lows. $21 today? $25-$30 EOY. American box store retail is far from dead."
"I believe the closed fitting rooms are a result of high unemployment payments resulting in a lack of workers coming back into the work place. M and all retailers have a lot of clothing shoplifting in the fitting rooms, so by closing them they save. This makes M like online retailers (ebay & Amazon, et cetera), you can see the clothes but not know whether it fits."
"% plus dividend (ex dividend date in 3 days) and GS downgrades so they can buy it for a day and then dump itjust a guessseems like a safe buythink they said $12 target, of course it should drop around 10% after the payout"
"Dillard's just blew the earnings report out of the water, analysts were looking for a loss of 40 cents, ended up posting a profit of 22 cents, the analysts have been wrong about it every report, they have a consensus price target of 45 and it now is above 75, and it has a huge short position against it as well. Wonder what the person who made the 1.5 million dollar bet against the Macy's earning call is thinking now?"
Folks - Macy’s has $4.5 billion cash with a book value of $20 - all these commentators were designed to scare small investors to get out of this stock then you’ll end up losing money. JCPenney is closing most of their stored nationwide - soon most of those customers will shop at Macy’s or Dillard’s
Dang the HFT's. Buy the rebound. Essential reopening trade thesis still in tact.
"I don't get this, they are projected to make around $4.00/share, they pay a $1.50/share dividend. They have $2.50/share left of profit. Some companies would kill to have that right"
"Shaggy - Good price action last three days. You got me thinking about Macy's now! I'll report back w/ ""technical"" by Sunday, for next week."
Red market is good for Macy’s run up
"Nothing can be based on pre-market anymore, probably a good indicator for normal trade hours that they are down, they blew the earnings estimates out of the water, they even bet the best case estimate by over twenty cents."
Reddit.....Take MACY's to $21 PLUS !!!!!
I take 9.00 at close
"Hugh 20k contract call spread risk reversal traded. 20k contracts of 9/11 P6 sold for 0.20, and a 14k contracts of 9/4 C7 C8 spread bought for 0.28. The spread was a $20,000 credit because more puts sold. Very bullish because max profit is $2M if M closed above 8 on Friday. If not then and 2M puts assigned at $5.80 Big money $11,600,000 on the line M closes above 8 on Friday"
Maybe Amazon is in cahoots with the brokerage firms to bring the price down and then acquire Macy's for their real state. Amazon is looking to expand into retail and they have their own clothing line. They just need locations.
Nordstrom is flying and Macy’s still on life support
I am holding on M shares. My wife still shop there with all her friends.
"Up, up, up and away!Back to precovid prices- $20s to $30s soon.FDA approval expected tomorrow in the USA. Vaccinations in USA begin days"
It's going up nonstop. Bad days are behind us. Confidence is restored.
Buy at 5 or 6 — this is not going anywhere anytime soon—take any profits you have no matter how small else get left holding the bag
"SR: Relax. There is nothing wrong with the earnings statement. It was a strong, positive quarter that beat the street and made every analyst following retail — and Macy's in particular — impressed. The guidance shows continued growth in the primary business with exceptional growth in On-line business. (My wife is a true blue on-line Macy's customer - she believes they ship faster, have better goods and do a much better job than Amazon or Nordstrom) She said to me, without any inducement, thatNordstrom used to be the store to beat when it came to customer service — Macy's has done exactly that. Their people are more responsive, their products are displayed and described more accurately; (My wife has returned two or three Nordstom on-line items...but never returned any of her Macy's on-line purchases). I don't want this to sound like a big ad for Macy's. I like the company, yes. I think it's earnings were terrific and the sell off today was mostly emotional — not fundamental. I was a big buyer of Macy's today. I believe any price under $35 will be a profitable trade."
Macy's now the dominant force online and at the mall. One of the few bright effects of the Covid. Buy.
Inventory is a positive.It is Un-tarriffed merchandise. Macy's can charge whatever they want and get it!
"Pray tell, what caused M shooting up? I have it in my watch list at 9.50 and surprised to find out it's doubled..."
Double Beat. Nice
"Expect a spike in share prices after earnings, because all the bad news is in the stock price in spades now.Good news regarding life returning to normal, vaccine being approved and This is the first quarter this year starting Aug that ALL Macys stores are open for business.Expect vaccine approval by FDA by Sept or Oct and wide distribution soon after.Russia is the first in the world to have a vaccine approved by its government and ready for its whole population. Russia announced their success and plans to innoculate their whole population starting in october thus ending covid in Russia.The USA is second or third in the world behind Russia and China and soon will do the same.Covid again, people forget, is just a mild flu virus that is so mild most Americans get it and don't know they have it because they have no symptoms at all.Its so harmless to most Americans, that it is far widely spread than most realize. In fact as much as 80 million Americans can now have had it and have immunity without knowing it. Antibody tests recently done by several Universities prove that the general population has been vastly exposed to it already and have immunity. In Los Angeles alone the positive tested cases vastly underestimate how widely it has spread.They estimate 20 to 40 times as many people as tested positive actually have had it in Los AngelesThis means in the USA about 5 million tested positive, but the actual number in the USA who have had it and have immunity now is more like 100 million people.Fact is ONLY a tiny portion of the USA population suffer severe symptoms and serious ill effects of the virus.Most of us, who are healthy and strong otherwise have no fear of covid. Its really the most mild flu ever.Case in point: Jack Nickolaus and his wife both in their 80s admitted they both had covid 19 and his wife totally had no symptoms at all. Jack had a mild cold for a few days and that was all and it went away on its own. If an 80 year old couple had such an experience like this we see clearly covid is indeed such a mild fluthat all this closing down of the economy, trillion dollar Hero bills from Congress and mass forciing of businesses to close and go out of business and 54 million unemployed was certainly very judgement on the part of our government.I think we need to vote them out of office. The cure is certainly worse than the illness.It is like cutting a persons head off to cure a bad case of acne.In any case the storm is passed and life will return to normal soon."
As I stated yesterday (I covered) out between 4.92-4.95Adios and thanks for the money
EMarketer ranked Macy’s as the 10 best retail e-commerce business in the country. The combination their strong e-commerce business along with the stores reopening should produce strong revenues for this quarter. Should have nice numbers on 08/12 when Q2 are announced.
M is a strong sell right here - could drop to $9
"Account value$10,334.56 $(11,939.67) (53.60%)ha-ha, got a call from ameritrade. I have until 3pm to liquidate my position..."
"The big machine is working M this week on all cylinders. First the fake drop to grab cheap shares, now the rise to $17 Max Pain. Now this morning in CNBC for the first time ever Jim Cramer was pumping Macy's before the bell. This is how it works folks, so many ways for them to make money and consumers sit and wait on their stock purchase, maybe even intimated to sell on the drop or this rise out of fear. Know that you have made a good investment and hold, especially if you purchase a year ago and now have long term gains.Will be interesting to see if this closes exactly at $17 today. I think it is no coincidence that $17 is max pain."
"Nomansky, what kind of position do you have or not in Macy's??? Stock, short, calls, puts--which one(s). Tell us and we will be able to appreciate your comments more validly. Thank you."
"The opportunity is to cut the dividend and start a buyback program. At current dividend and stock price, they could retire 9 million shares a quarter. When the price comes back, they will have room to sell and invest."
Finally back in the green here. Better days ahead. Congrats longs.
I'm waiting for $5. Then I will buy around 20 thousands shares. It will be easy profit when I sell them for $25 next year. Unfortunately I do not believe in shorting any stocks. I also use my retirement accounts so no shorting.
"Be careful of people telling you this stock os something its not. Pre covid when the economy was at its PEAK, this stock was 15. You think the economy is back to those levels? Haha"
"AZN/Oxford get approved in UKLONDON — The coronavirus vaccine being developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca has been authorized for emergency use in the U.K., marking another step in the global battle against the pandemic.The shot is expected to be rolled out next week and would be added to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine which has so far been given to 600,000 people in the U.K., according to government statistics.U.K. government minister Michael Gove said Monday that its approval could accelerate the lifting of strict lockdowns in the country, which effectively canceled Christmas festivities for millions. Cases have surged in London and southern England with significant pressure being placed on hospitals. A new coronavirus variant found in the U.K. is reportedly more transmissible and has led to travel restrictions for people wanting to leave the country."
sold all of my macys position coz this company is going bankrupt - stock is tanking
"Solution: M become a REIT since sales and earnings are flat....Spin off mercury as a growth opportunity, possible 15 multiple, sell Bllomings as a NNN lease deal and keep real estae. Now this will be a great company....total value today would be $40 per share!"
"My quick estimation of cash shortage for each level of revenue fall estimation for the year.i use 25300 as a revenue base line, 40% gross margin then substract 8000 as a constant SGA expense substract about 250 interest expense and then add back depreciation of 1000 and substract capex at about 750 . Feel free to make more accurate estimations-10% revenue : no cash shortage-20% revenue: break point-30% revenue: 1 billion shortage( they announced 1.5 billion borrowing, so they will cover it)-40% revenue: 2 billion shortage ( cover it by the 1.5 billion borrowing and their cash balance)-50% revenue: 3 billion shortage( cover it by the 1.5 billion borrowing and their cash balance and raise additional 1 billion by stock issuing if possible)"
"Goldman has been able to get this cheap for dividend for awhile now, a sell rating wasn't necessary...."
I need one more pop today to roll over the rest of my puts to next week please 7.50 again
"Looked up Macy's stock out of curiosity, looks undervalued to me. Ill definitely become a buyer at this price$$$$"
$7 today$10 next weekvery possible (my thoughts)
i recently bought 2000 shares of Macy's. When will be the earnings ? is it September 2nd ? does Macy's still give dividend ?
"Matthew says Macy's is on Cramer tonight. If so look for a bump up in M stock. Cramer will bring into focus how Macy's is evolving. He has turned a blind eye to this till now. Personally I thing it's all by design, let the big boys in then pump the stock. And I mean pump to $30 to $50 range. Consumers players will also get excited after this interview."
Green Monday!!!!!!
Incredible short squeeze story unfolding. Longs need only wait for the inevitable leap upwards!
squeezing me some lemons
Tomorrow will be fun:-) Go Macy‘s go!
$18.50 CLOSE ..... run up to GREAT EARNINGS next week
"W/O question company is going in right direction with regards to sales. However, need to realign this 100 VP overhead joke and cut more costs. Mentioned revenues next quarter are expected to be flat hence, no price action follow through. Sold premarket at $24.93."
"I sold off everything else and went into a margin call on Macy's (5k shares all in). People are going back to work and going out. Me personally, I do not like buying clothes without trying them on. Macy's has 84 percent institutional ownership. The company has a market cap of just under 5 billion and gross profit of 5.1 billion (18 billion revenue). It is a solid company and my only regret is not holding my shares at $6 when I knew it would eventually go back up. They own the land their stores reside in and they are cleaning stuff up for their balance sheet, which already looks pretty damn good. I read something about $10 billion goal over three years in ecommerce. Solid company... an American icon!"
After hours numbers look good. We will have another great day tomorrow.
Macy‘s going north on huge volume. This week will rock hard! Short-squeeze just around the corner! Keep up the buying-pressure and let‘s trigger the squeeze! There‘s a point where all hell breaks loose........ let‘s go for it!!!
Div is nice
"I got in at 35, now it is 31 with good results.. even with SGA expenses, this report is not bad."
On Fast Money ... M bought back 500 Million of its debt.. much more than planned...
Record breaking holiday sales over the weekend!
Ok folks macy’s is above the 50 and 200 day at around 15. If we hold we are still bullish with a breakout to new highs around 24 or higher with stimulus monies on the next leg higher as long as we don’t break support of 14.30.
Imagine being so insane you make multiple accounts on a yahoo message board and then write 50 to 100 posts a day for motnhs of the same stuff. Anyone else curious to know why this guy has completely lost it. I think he even talks to himself in here. Whatever is going on dude you should seriously get some help and leave the normal people alone to discuss $M stock.
Zack's give's it a strong buy recommendation and it has done nothing but go down.
"Oh when the saints, go marching in, oh when the saints go marching in... Boom!"
So I read that Macys is close to building a sky scraper on Herald Square. In researching this i saw that they added to the top of a Macys in Brooklyn. Apparently Macys sold a building and the top floors of that Macys to the real estate company who built it for 256 million. I would guess that the same would apply to Herald Square. Macys would sell the top of that building and the rights to build there. What kind of price do you think that would fetch? It could approach $1B. Then you have all of those new tenants passing right by your stores every day. I think this can spur growth and significantly add to revenue.
"As I said two weeks ago, Longs, all your assumptions about M going to the moon prices are based on believes that pandemic will end soon.It is not going to happen. We had masks one year ago. Virus had mutated to the point of being more infectious and CDC now recommends to wear two masks. We started vaccinations in January 2020. Virus right now produced new mutations that able to avoid vaccines.We live under new conditions now. There is no way we will ever go back to 2019 happy times.Macys main consumers - people 50+ years old will never return to offices and to Malls. They do not need Macys anymore. Get real. Stop gambling your money away.I sold all M stock at $17.90 and during last month already made 10% profit day trading."
"they have been consistently paying high dividends for over 20 years straight!!! and never missed a single payment!!! this will be $10+ by the end of the week and over $15 by mid July I guarantee it!!! summer is here and stimulus is coming people wanna shop and look good, and all stores will reopen soon!! big PRESS RELEASE ANNOUNCEMENT END OF THE WEEK!"
"New short interest numbers for Macy's out to-day, Monday, after the close."
"Macy's has showed us their hand, investors must have liked it, should be trending up, stores starting to reopen, would love to see 8 bucks by 4th of July!"
"2 folks here mention the JWN stock not doing as poorly but recall that the Nordstrom family was seeking to take the company private at higher levels so there is an implicit bid. That said, both companies have relatively equal market cap, Macys have a higher EV but lower EV/EBITDA TTM which indicates higher EBITDA and higher debt. Depending on expected EBITDA trends Macys would appear to be a better buyout potentially at current levels. Not saying it will be bot and my analysis is rudimentary, meaning there can be much more going on regarding expected future EBITDA. Just looking at the current point in time. All the selling is likely not short selling. You'll see clusters of volume reported this morning around 10am and 11am, which more likely indicates dark pool reporting of aggregate trading volumes that occurred around those hours which would be more long sellers this morning or naked illegal shorting."
I hear Clark Griswald is running the Thanksgiving Day Parade this year
Reversal starts now. Watch for the 10 minute red bar and then starts the downward spiral
"EPS of $0.80/share, paid off debt, online sales up 21% YOY, better inventory turnover, and decent margins!!!! EXCELLENT QUARTER!!!"
50 million shares traded already........ Macy‘s will survive........ double-digits again....... sooner than many think......... shorties getting fudged:-) short-squeeze is inevitable.......... Whatever it takes..........
What will this end the day at? Trying to figure out when to buy in for earnings
"What a time, I bought @ $7 ... !!! #GLTA longs "
We should get close to $20 next week with stimulus new and insider big buy orders
we need active investor.like kss!
What a nice day folks!!!
Inflation and interest rate future hikes will bring retailers back to a realistic evaluation. 10 at best for M
Holding on to the 5000 shares. Ain't selling it. Market is on my side..
"Given those results and the future guidance and strategy noted, this is nothing less than a $30 stock and I suspect we will see a small dividend announced later this year."
Huge pull back in the whole market nothing to worry about.
"It appears $GME will single handedly bring down CNBC, by the way all the hosts' panties look all tied up in knots. Every $GME short who shorted $260 worth of shares at the beginning of the year now owes $40,000 for that amount shorted. Similarly, every $M short who shorted $440 worth of $M in March will soon owe $15,000 for that amount shorted. $CVM might be experiencing a similar move, up 50% premarket."
Time to dominate. We going to eat! Next week will be huge.
Is time to come back
Why not continue to evaluate the other executive management as u eliminate the COO. Take a look at 5 year charts versus kohl’s or Ross stores. Obvious mismanagement is very extensive throughout the top echelon.
Someone must know something before earning release
"We should touch $20 by Friday , stimulus going to be signed either tomorrow or Friday ...let’s Goo bulls"
Really??? still paying 10% Dividend And selling at 5 times earnings. You guys act like it doesn't make any money. Easy money into 2020
Could today be the start of the mega short squeeze? Looks like it could by pre-market!
LONG MACYS
A month from now this will be $30+
Macy’s could easily hit 25 by end of this week and I may be underestimating the target . Shorts will be forced to cover because of the huge potential of more pain after seeing what happened to GSE.
I jumped back in yesterday @ $13.80.Will hold till ER.
"Hold !! It's not overvalued and short seller are leaving, we are going to 40$"
"Shorties better cover! Macy‘s with BETTER than expected numbers. CEO in fireside-chat with JP Morgan today. Financing is on track. Reopenings are on track. Macy‘s will survive. Bottom is in. Upside trend-change now. Analyst upgrades coming. Price targets increased. Short-squeeze with every third share shorted very very likely. Let‘s seek the trigger-point.......... whatever it takes........ double-digits coming again sooner than many here think...........,"
"Scroll down and read my comment.I'm so dead accurate on Macy's movement.If you don't sell today, make sure you sell tomorrow.This will be back to $17-18 level.It needs do that to catch a breath, before it resume running again to the next high."
Matthew isn’t short he just wants your shares
"Macy‘s to borrow up to $5 billion, secured by stores it owns and by merchandise. Macy‘s owns 342 of 775 stores free from mortgage. At the end of fiscal year on February 1, it had $685 million in cash and cash equivalents on hand. It drew its entire credit line of $1.5 billion. So that would be close to a total of $2.2 billion in cash. This plus the $5 billion will get it through. Reopening of stores/malls week"
"Rode this horse before, and there will be lots of shopping once the panic subsides!"
"gonna sleep well tonight knowing Macy’s did horrible on thanksgiving and Black Friday. per research firm Edison Trends only a 2% increase in online sales YOY 2019/2020.Additionally, a reduction of over 50% in foot traffic to retail stores.5+ billion in debt with these sales don’t seem like a bright future. Was bullish but ever so more bearish. We could see 7-8s fast"
"Let's not forget this.......Alibaba lands Macy's as the first U.S. department store for its online portalBy LEENA RAO August 12, 2015In Alibaba’s effort to woo American retailers, the Chinese e-commerce juggernaut announced a significant deal this morning—Macy’s. Macy’s China Limited, a joint venture between Macy’s and Chinese retailer, Fung Retailing Limited, will launch an online flagship store on Alibaba’s online shopping mall for brands, Tmall Global.Alibaba has made it no secret that it views bringing on U.S. and other international brands onto Tmall as part of the company’s key growth in the future. The company recently brought on Goldman Sachs banker Michael Evans to oversee this international expansion.Alibaba says Macy’s will be the first U.S. department store to join Alibaba’s Tmall Global."
Same pullback happened 2 weeks ago. No need for panick.
Will Macy’s go up or will it go down? One thing is for sure: this is a listed company.
"Make it harder for the shorts to cover by placing long term sell orders for any higher price you want for your share . $35, $40. $45 or more , The more longer term sell orders Wall Street see the better."
"(Bloomberg) -- Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky took a stake in Macy's Inc. and plans to engage management on ways to improve performance of the struggling U.S. retailer. Kretinsky's Vesa Equity Investment amassed a 5% holding in Macy's for strategic investment purposes, according to a securities filing."
Is anyone hearing a rumor of TJX buying Macy's..they want to control Luxury and discount..would be a stock deal
it will close tomorrow at 18.
I am finally green instead of red on this puppy. I’m going to hold it. At least thru the Macy’s thanksgiving day parade
"I've said it before and I will say it again with the direction being the opposite of the other times I have said it. The markets are being manipulated now like no other time in history. I think Macy's stock has been and is grossly undervalued. With that being said, why out of the blue does it just start to climbing? Meanwhile we see retailers who posted very good numbers like ANF who go up two dollars in a matter of three days to only go back up 3 dollars over four days, all on no news and it just bounces back and forth with out any logic or reason. It is happening throughout the markets, look at Five Below, after posting their stock tanked in pre-markets, continued down at the open but finished up over six dollars. Today we have Constellation Brands, post good numbers and they go up in pre-market though all over the place, they actually drop a couple of bucks at open and now are up almost ten dollars but have been up as much as 12 dollars today. Tell me, why such wild and illogical movements and please spare me the usual algorithms which are just reacting to certain key words or phrases. If that were the case, the stocks would either rocket up or down without the ridiculous inflection points. These inflection points are meant to trigger sell orders so that the big money boys can catch the passive funds, the small retail investors off guard and then profit as they run up the prices, sure it is computerized trading, but it is coordinated computerized trading accomplished by collusion (and not by the Russians or the Trump campaign). Just way too many inconsistencies in the markets, they will tank stocks that report great numbers to pump stocks with bad numbers."
$6.13 tomorrow $8 Tuesday
"29% short. This is going to 25 in a hurry after earnings. Bar set very low, easy beat."
"after they addressed the dividend being safe and having sustainable cash flows, I can't see it retesting today's lows. I've got an order in just in case it does to buy but between an inverted yield curve, a major sentiment against retail, a trade war and these results w/ lower guidance, not surprised it's down big."
"It is a very dangerous world we live in when we have a news media who has a very defined agenda which is counter to the country's well being. We have analysts who mostly live in NYC and thereby also have a very defined political agenda and therefore would be willing to spin their analysis to further these beliefs. Then we have the uber wealthy who also have a very defined political leaning as well, most would assume that the uber wealthy would be very conservative, with the exception of the Koch brothers, the top thirty billionaires in the US are actually uber liberal. You combine those three forces who will both gladly misled the American citizens to further their political agendas and also cause chaos in the markets to provide for tremendous buying opportunities as well. Very dangerous combination at play."
The volume on the $10 calls expiring this week are through the roof. Talk about unusual options activity!
"m, jwn ... 52 week high."
Macys will not go BK..........News flash
What is with the asset sales? Is Macy's slowly liquidating while reporting capital gains on property?
It’s a fight to stay above 5.00 And shorts won’t budge unless Macy’s gets closer to 6.00
let's sell off companies that trade at 9 times earnings...and buy companies that trade at 100 times earnings
"Close at $9, then to $10 by weekend"
Who is buying at this price?
From Cramer's interview with Genette in April.Genette said they completed most of their goals so far and will now look for a share buy-back.His Quote;“Use our cash to invest in the business”“Have a good dividend”“Now we will think about share repurchase in the future”
Barron's article Warning: Splitting co into 3-Separate entities. .
"LOL @ all the SIMPS who don't understand this was a profitable company prior to Covid and will be one after. Macy's holds less debt now than it did 3 years ago. The online business alone would be cheap at a $2b valuation. I pray for more shorts to pile in, cheaper shares for everyone with a brain that can read financial statements!!!"
scks to be long term . swing trade and learn the options
The dividend is fine. Why do people feel the need to spread fear and talk nonsense on these boards. The stock is at its bottom. Retail is strong as a sector. This stock is way over shorted. This is a hold until next earnings with gains and a nice dividend holding it.
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/options-market-predicting-spike-macys-141902665.html
Get the yield up to 12% for ALL I CARE. than I double my money in 6yrs compounded.
Lowest price in a month. Good day to add some.
"Shorts couldn't push the price under $16 anymore. For information we went through $16 in 24h, despite some efforts today at the opening. A nice short squeeze is coming, mark this."
WHY NOT OWN A STOCK THAT PAYS A 9.3% DIVIDEND.
"Goldman downgrading JWN at 31-32 range is purely another attempt to drag down the retail and fashion sectors to create even better buying opportunities for their fat cat clients. Why didn't they drop their rating when it was at 67? Did they base their previous rating based merely on the prospect of the founding family taking it private? If so, even the most basic of investors will tell you not to invest based on speculation of a buy-out, so Goldman can't even claim to be as good as a simpleton retail investor?"
"The loans merely replace existing loans and add cash or liquidity which is a wise and prudent course of action due to the current climate. As things change the excess funds can be repaid.No actual change in the book value of Macys occurred. The principle change was an accounting change to nearly eliminate a GOOD WILL of about 3 billion. BBBY did the same thing as did other retailers.It is really is just an accounting issue. No money changed hands it was a pure accounting issue.Just like Chevron and XOM did too. Personally, I am happy they eliminated Good Will from the books. I never like balance sheets that Good Will on them. It is really should not be done in accounting.Macys thus really only had an actual loss of $600 million last quarter which is to be expected due to the turbulent events and forced closure of the store for 3 months.If it weren't for that covid nonsense Macys would have posted solid sales and profits that quarter."
"Love when I see so many bears bushing means it’s time to load up bulls , we could hit $20 this week"
"Pre-market jump does NOT taken into account the short squeeze impact. Hold on to your shoes, this thing will blast off today."
"The private label brands offered by the Company include Alfani, American Rag, Aqua, Bar III, Belgique, Charter Club, Club Room, Epic Threads, first impressions, Giani Bernini, Greg Norman for Tasso Elba, Holiday Lane, Home Design, Hotel Collection, John Ashford, Karen Scott, Thalia Sodi and lune+aster.https://www.reuters.com › companiesM.N - Macy's Inc Profile | Reuters"
"oil price plunging, SO it's time to buy high ranking retailers Macy's, because no inflation, Fed rise rate will slow down, cheap gasoline will boost people go out more,"
Should have opened over $11. It was brought down from 10.94 (7.7M volume after hours yesterday) to 9.65 on 50K volume. Just a joke. Blatant short manipulation. From 8 am the real market starts.
M stock is a short nightmare coming true. UNLIMITED LOSSES!
this will be at $10 in few weeks just be patient
Why are we going down?
https://seekingalpha.com/article/4290119-macys-digital-contribution-comparable-sales
Cover cover before it’s too late shorty $20’s
Sold now will buy the dips
"Me thinks this is not a temporary pop in M, like last time, and M will be going higher and higher for some time."
"Never seen a completely different company trade in such sympathy without being a part of the supply chain. Even more crazy is that M is probably has one of the highest quality balance sheets in the retail space.Sometimes, I just dont understand the market."
Those who bought at open going to have some sick profits by the looks of this - going to rip higher.
"Eric what don't you under stand about the 688 million dollar loss in Q4, that was a loss of -$2.21 per shares that is what Macy's filed with the SEC as their earnings I know the business channels are reported something different , but the truth is what Macy's files with the SEC"
we have an up day and a shorty basher comes out of the woodwork posting paragraph after paragraph of FUD. someones getting scared i guess LOL
"macys will be fine. they have a wonderful business, and have wonderful online sales. it will be back up to atleast 10 very soon"
"I owned Bradlees (1995), K Mart (2001), Sears-K Mart (SHLD), JCP (2012-2015) and M (2017-present) as long and short. The pop corn fart PR by our CEO reminds me of the above mentioned desperate company's. Why didn't he mention the sale of the Seattle store for $480,000,000? This would have substance. Probably M has used the Amortization in EBITDA to their advantage for taxes over decades and now have to pay 28% on taxes and whatever WA State taxes are. I see he talks about in-store pick-up. There is only one M in SC and its a four hour drive to Greenville. Fayetteville, NC is my closest and I'm not driving 2 hours and 30 minutes to get there. He has large goals for 2023 in digital. All the above companies had large goals three years out. If M goes to $25 I'll be happy for Sally. A broken clock is right twice a day."
I believe in America. I think Macy's will be fine and it's a Great Investment Longterm
XMAS will the knockout blow. The reality is the sequential decline in revenues will be steeper than forecasted and thus we will not be able to service the debt.
Only reason you can buy this stock this cheap temporarily is Covid!Never would you have seen this low price if not for covid.Easily will jump back to the $20-40 range post covid.
"average hourly earnings increase to 0.4 % month over moth in February, 3.4% increase year over year, it's higher than expected, that's very good news for high ranking retailers Macy's, so Macy's no reason down today."
Real Estate value? What ever happened to Cowen's analysis from 2017 that Macy's real estate value was $16 Billion? The NY Store alone was worth $3 Billion. Today's market cap is $7.6 Billion. Nobody talks about the break up value anymore. Commercial real estate hasn't gotten any cheaper in the past two years. ?????????
"What does Yacktman's know that we don't? Macys is in a turn around. Wall Street MM's won't say a bad thing about M. There leasing inner city stores to the government for High Schools in VT. CEO Gennette says a M goal is $22 Billion in Digital Sales in two years. There saving on the dividend, They sold a half billion in junk bonds to survive phase 3 of Covid. Gennette makes over $10 million in salary and stock options no matter how well or bad M performs. He average sells every fifth month."
"Great report and outlook on strategic initiatives, despite the algos. Furthermore, if one wants to attack a stock on tariffs, start with AAPL lol. It's far more at risk than Macy's who is managing the situation as best as can be expected."
"Meanwhile, what is merely a new version of a dime store has a multiple even with a major beat down today for a big miss, of nearly 40. Five was dropped to 95 but has already recovered to 105, big miss. The same happened with Children's Place, another of the Street's fair haired children. Markets are so jacked right now. A dime store has a 40 multiple and Macy's is at 6."
Today's just a taste. I was there this weekend. The store was the busiest I've seen it since the pandemic started.
Here comes $8.
M is -33% in last 6 month while market is up m is down. M is going nowhere it a titanic following sear and toy r us.....time to abandon ship and join tech stock
"If this holds its gains , today might be the 1st day of the Santa Clause rally... :-)"
Macy's CEO sees $10BN up for grabs due to big name BK's in retail. Streamlining by closing 125 stores and reinvesting into Ecommerce websites and aps will see Macy's grab a chunk of this $10BN imo.https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/21/macys-ceo-10-billion-in-sales-up-for-grabs-because-of-retail-bankruptcies.html
"Closed put from yesterday. Bulls, you really need to hold this 16.10s level, if dont, the break below 15.90s will be fast. Good luck"
Great M comparison to Best Buy by the Motley. Right-on imo. Buy.
Huge stimulus and min wage increase to $15 to pass congress very soon! Big positive for retailers like MACYS!Life soon back to normal as restrictions ending because covid numbers getting better daily. Vaccines working! We have a president who knows how to solve the problems!
Indexes turning green. And Macy‘s reopens 68 big stores today. Another 50 stores in a week. And then much more week by week. All 775 stores nationwide will reopen in a few weeks. Back to normal step by step by step. The M-train is taking up speed now. Be on board!
Why a drop unless consensus now is for a dividend cut
"I’ve been day trading for years and I’m so glad I finally found (http://Pick-stocks.com). They’re pre-market watchlists cover all the latest market-moving news, and they don’t beat you down with tons of ads. Highly recommend!"
"Let’s get this straight, besides Macy’s being known as a brick and mortar retailer, it is also on the top 10 global e-commerce retailers list as of May 2019. Please google that up."
"Anyone try to place an order at Amazon recently or Walmart or Target.Their delivery system is broken! They said it would take until August 7th for an order placed May 21st to arrive!!Nonsense! Who is going to wait months to get something? That is crazy! This COVID cleaning and new rules have slowed the delivery system so much that it take months for an order to get filled!I don't know about you but I cancelled my Amazon order and bought online at Macys and got it in 3 days!Macys has a huge advantage over Amazon now because they can deliver a lot faster for home delivery and even faster if you go to their store and curb side pick up. The fastest yet is to you to their store today and you have what you want today!That is going to cost Amazon massive sales loss! Macys is going to win over billions of dollars in sales from Amazon, Walmart and Target as a result of their broken delivery systems.Who is going to wait months for pajamas from Amazon and have to then return it because it wont fit or is poor quality material or for a host of reasons. Macys is in the winning position.Besides, I never buy clothes online because I always have to return them. That is why historically 75% of all clothes sales are at brick and mortar stores. People prefer to go in person and try out the clothes first before buying. This is why clothes sales dropped off the clift when stores like Macys were closed.We stopped buying clothes completely until they reopened.This week we are having fun shopping at Macys in person."
"As Morgan Stanley downgrades Macys, they added 1.17M shares last quarter."
"Nice Macy‘s chart-analysis:https://investorplace.com/2020/05/3-big-stock-charts-for-friday-macys-gap-and/target/- A double-bottom chart pattern has formed at the $5 level and M has bounced off there twice- M stock 20-day moving average, M needs to go over 50- and 200-day moving averages- 33% of all Macy‘s shares are sold short.... what an epic short-squeeze in the cards.... let‘s go M!"
"Macys is going to have a very strong report for the last quarter. Report in 3 weeks. Online sales are going to go through the roof. Cashflow positive. Strong cash on hand. I won't be surprised if it is going to squeez shorts in a big way. It would be worth a buy from here. For a while there it got a head of itself when M went to 20 with Gamestock. Now its going down with Gamestock. Macys is in a whole different category and its presence in New York, San Francisco, major markets, its smaller stores and its online store. THis is not a brick and morter game company that will not be around due to online sales."
I owned 2000 M shares last dividend and received $377. Own 10000 shares now and can't wait for my next dividend of $1885.
Monday..time to watch every tick
Would have been nice if M went all the way down to $15.88 but I guess $16 is as low as we go.
"M is going to hit 100... after all, if LULU can have PE of 60...after M becoming a growth company... no problem."
"Beautiful close, This will reach 20 sooner than I would expect"
I CALL THESE BASHERS OUT BECAUSE THEY ALL MAKE MISTAKES AND HAVE NO CLUE. CARLOS AS AN EXAMPLE LOSING HIS SKIRT ON NKTR A COMPANY WITH NEGATIVE -2.44 A SHARE AND BEGGING ON THAT BOARD FOR HELP YET GIVING HIS OPINION ON M HERE WITH NO SKIN IN THE GAME! M HAS A BOOK VALUE OF OVER 20 A SHARE.

Manipulation at it's best bere folks.
Futures up big:-) Macy‘s with preliminary sales numbers this Thursday. On the same day (21st May 2020) public fireside chat with JP Morgan analyst. Good week ahead! Shorts are getting squeezed hard!
"A lot of people in denial on this board,look at sears"
"Bruce, volumes could easily be impacted by numerous factors. The stock churn rate could be very low based on the fact that there aren't a lot of sellers, people and institutions who are long Macy's have already seen the price drop to 20. They are also receiving a dividend yield of nearly 7% at current price. I think the majority of holders are doing just that holding. The volume that we are seeing are day traders and flippers who are merely buying and selling the same shares back and forth. I wager of the 5 plus million shares traded yesterday, that less than a million shares float created that volume, in other words, the same shares were traded on average 5 to 6 times yesterday and I believe that has been the case for months."
"I'm still very bearish on Macys, we'll see what they say in three weeks. But for what it's worth. Went bowling the other day. Place was at capacity, they are limited to 50% normal capacity, with in 30 minutes of opening. People are going out."
I sat on the fence for 3 weeks about joining (http://Fairstox.com) for their weekly picks. Big mistake. M exploded and I completely missed out. Don’t make the same mistake I made. Join them today
stock is dropping - is macy ready to go bankrupt?
"Futures up:-) This Thursday Macy‘s comes up with preliminary Q1-sales as well as CEO in fireside-chat with JP Morgan. It‘s definitely time to squeeze the shorts! The longer they stay, the more it costs them. If you own stock, look forward to double-digits! Whatever it takes.........."
FOR SURE 30 COMING SOON THEN 35 AND 40
"Macys quarterly results on revenue, margin and eps exceeded already raised expectations in dramatic fashion. Well done!"
I was wrong shorting Macy's. The shares sold off so much that it became a fundamental value play and buyers have reacted as would be reasonably expected. Took my losses. Learned a lesson.
Stocks fluctuate. Yesterday was just normal move which proves short sellers are die hards and short term traders taking their tiny profits. The real huge moves upward is just beginning. The massive move upward is still awaiting shorts capitulation yet to happen. Longs relax and enjoy the massive triple digit gains yet ahead. Dividend restoration news ahead too
Not a big surprise. I must admit its great to see the stock getting the respect it deserves. Congratulations to everyone who didn't loose focus and waited for this. Upward movement will accelarate from this point on.
"Now this GME saga is over and shorts are back like before, it's a good time to buy if you believe in that recovery trend that started in November."
M is grossly undervalued as is RAD as was BBBY. Both popped fast! Don't forget Goldman Sachs also has a Strong SELL rating on Best Buy too just before it turned UP! Buy low SELL high. Don't listen to Goldman Sachs They say sell low and buy high.M is going to pop just like BBY and BBBY and RAD and JWN did. This retail stock secular bear market is turning.
The $2.5M bear option trader is up to his tricks again playing on the fears of investors to drive the price of Macy’s further down. Please don’t fall for this foolishness and manipulation. All the major institutional investors are already get to go. We can no longer be waiting for this particular “Johnny come lately” option trader to get with the program.
"Surprised the resiliency of this security today. Strangely enough, my workstation (which ges quotes from Thomson Reuters) says the short percentage shot up 5%. May be a running average from the past few weeks, I'm not sure but it's reporting 20% of the float short. Does anyone have a different number?"
I need some reassurance on this stock. Should I go all in and buy?
To any actual reader who happens to stumble across this message board. One guy has gone full blown bu tthurt mode and spams all day everyday with absolute nonsense just block all 10 of his accounts or do what I do and get entertainment out of his misery. The stock is performing almost identical to all the other major clothing retailers and the sector will have its day to shine when the vaccine is released. Price tgt $20 by year end.
Superb buying opportunity for long term holders. Macy's well ahead of schedule on the recovery... the shorts can only keep this stock down for so long!
I wonder if Bezos have a hand in the heavy shorting of retail stocks. JWN is on the same boat.
Schools starting. Buying new clothes for kids. It will be a good quarter.
"MIke, people are afraid that the Fed will not cut now...because retail sales are too strong. So disregarding the fact that the economy is booming, disregarding the fact that retail is booming, disregarding the fact that the consumer is in their best position probably for decades, the possibility that the Fed won't drop rates that we really weren't expecting to happen at all this year is driving this stock down. Yet companies like ANF and AEO are up. Very interesting activity. No market manipulation going on here, move along, the SEC is more worried about Elon Musk texting something about his Ponzi scheme of a company."
Did this thing pop/drop a +-7% swing in just the last 25 minutes? I’m seeing it down premarket now.
"I don't often buy stock, this post is for nowierdosky, 5,000 shares long @5.50"
"Well when the corona virus is behind us it seems reasonable M will go up,wouldn't you think. The dividend isn't far off,which offers some downside protection.M is 97% owned by institutions and so I wonder when their algorithms kick in to buy. As people have pointed out their properties represent 70 odd % of the market cap. I remember when K mart doubled in 3 months back in '96. Be greedy when others are fearful,collect your dividends,will close at 12.50 or better today"
"Low float of just 293M, 45% of this is short. I don't think i've seen a more likely short squeeze about to happen. Could run to $20+ in just one day imo."
"rotation going on. These beaten down names like department store, casino, cruise are strong today.Definitely $7.5+ after earning, it will easily beat its only credible competitor's performance, don't forget macys has bigger presence on beauty and home business, less so on formal wear. earning is only 2 more business days away..."
"The recent sell off over the last few days hit all the department stores, not just Macy's. It was caused, IMO, by the advanced retail report for August that estimated that retail sales were up month over month and year over year, with e-commerce up 16% while department store sales were lagging for that partial month. The drop in M stock was another over-reaction by the market, and the shorts, as M's is certainly not a pure department store play with no e-commerce component. Indeed, M's is working hard to make that key adjustment to use its stores in combination with its e-commerce strengths for advantage, and they have over 40 quarters of improving e-commerce sales, which already is representing over 10% of their sales. The August retail report contains some very positive data for retail overall as it is growing at a reasonably healthy pace, which bodes well for all retail sales. Consumers are buying and this is not contracting, it is growing consistently with a continuation of the expansion in the economy. The secular problems that e-commerce causes for department stores can be turned into a strength when properly balanced with a strong e-commerce segment, as seen now by WMT, TGT and COST, who have figured out the formula. For clothing and housewares department stores, there still a big convenience factor for the person that wants to try something on but go back to the store to get a different size or color, or to have a convenient return location rather than just mailing things back. My own personal assessment of Macy's e-commerce activities is that they are doing an increasingly good job at shifting their advertising into that medium and they have very attractive e-commerce offerings. I think M well understands the need to combine their e-commerce in a proper mix with their well located and convenient stores. Each has strengths and M is making important changes in this mix. Over time they morphing into a more balanced retailer and they are benefiting from the secular move into e-commerce for that part of their business.I think the Ms will continue to find advantageous retail opportunities to get the right mix of their strengths, and they will turn the corner on organic profit growth. In the meantime, they have so many other ways to achieve improved profits, that it is extremely likely they will start posting some good numbers against the backdrop of recent weakness, which will make for good comparisons. We will see near term cost cutting combined with near term improvements in inventory management that will have potentially outsized effects with early signs. I continue to believe that regardless of the ultimate outcome, M is currently under an attack that has driven its PPS to undervalued territory, and this is the time to be a buyer. You make the most money by recognizing when something is an opportunity, and I still think the fact that M pays a good dividend is some icing on the cake that helps the long and hurts the short seller."
Buying opportunity of a lifetime
Dec 14. ex divy date
"These top comments are a total mess. That was unnecessary lol but whatever. Longs, look - I'll gladly admit that my bearish theory on M has not panned out so far. Six months ago.. I briefly shorted TGT after AMZN bought Whole Foods. I ended up losing 80 cents/share but more importantly I realized that I was fundamentally wrong. With M, so far.. I genuinely don't see a major reason to question my initial assessment. It's an entirely different and irrelevant matter that I have personally avoided loss.. unfortunately whether or not I have lost money is a big deal for certain characters."
"10.46 to 9.02, all in one day, thought more debt was good news, boy were we wrong."
"Fantastic Up-day. Last 5-minutes over 1-Million Shares, @ Close 1.5-Million Shares. lol"
Amazon buyout!!! OMG!!! Amazing!!! Congratulations to longs!!! Shorts will lose everything overnight!!!
Macy’s 10+
Not sue why so glum. Macy's already pre-announced. I think the 4th qtr. was a one-off due to the Fe's insidious interest rate talk that they've now reversed. Buy for a positive spin on 2019 next week.
"IMHO, the longer the current price continues, the advantage goes to the long positions. This gives it more time for upcoming upsides to develop -- whole economy reopening, growing retail/online sales up, stimulus, fed support, vaccines, more opportunities from bankrupt retailers, potential Amazon buyout, Q3/Q4 earnings, etc. The list goes on..."
"Until retail in general comes back into favor this will mirror the XRT trend. The good news is, the div is safe and I am more than happy, to wait it out :-)"
"Listen-up! Macy's recently made a tender offer to payoff some of its debt early. That is not a sign of financial stress. In fact, it's a sign of the coffers are being filled with cash from hefty holidays!"
"The economy is lifting shoppers up from Target and JCP, to Macy's. I call it the Trump effect."
Macy’s is going to be extremely profitable once the markets are opened up.
https://www.macysinc.com/investors/news-events/press-releases/detail/1623/macys-inc-announces-proposed-offering-of-senior
Let‘s go for a strong finish! Short-squeeze getting started slowly but steadily........ big spikey-spikey to double-digits coming........ BIG!!!
It can drop just as fast! Get your money now lol or 
"M will jump tomorrow. This week will be M's turn to go up! Big guys have made a solid bottom for reversing. Both the technical view and the valuation warrant the uptrend will start tomorrow! Obviously, cruise ones were up, airlines were up, why retails not? M will catch up for sure!!!"
Eric here is the SEC filing from Macy's own site that they lost even more moneyYou have been scammed Says Macys lost 688 million or a loss of $2.21 a share even worse than most reportedhttps://www.macysinc.com/investors/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001564590-21-007289/0001564590-21-007289.pdf
"12 NOV NAKED-SHORT REPORT: 5,155,248 (+81%).$2.5-M Smart-Money Puts Bet Macy's E/R Plunges. Short Percent of Float 27.06% - increase 4 % - Shares Short 83,440,000 - Prior 80,620,000. lol"
"Looks like M's management got their stock options reprice and it will be time to go higher , because they released the dividend information, Looks like you get .3775 cent dividend and M goes ex dividend on Sept 13 2019"
Macy’s has an expensive tv ad for women’s fashion. This ad campaign must cost multi millions. Why don’t they cut the ads to save money in time of crisis?!
Wasted Wednesday. A sell today can save you 50% or more on your losses.
"$6,25 and so determind to squeeze the shorts like never before. I‘m sure all funds and institutional will like to go this to double-digits again............ big boys and big girls with deep pockets and a very long breath! Never bet against this great American icon! Every third Macy‘s-share sold short fits perfect for a decent short-squeeze according to the script/manual/playbook! Double-digits calling (again)............. whatever it takes............"
"How is this money losing company's stock up like this? I don't own any and I'm not a short seller, I'm just baffled by the run up in a dead retail sector."
"Who is buying up all of these Call options on the cheap?Who has 60+% more cash than a few months ago, and has a proven interest in Macy's?I've experienced something similar with LL last year; the previous CEO bought options on the cheap, then announced an 'interest' in buying the company, suddenly owning a large number of shares.Do you think the shorts might be getting scared? Two days in a row now...."
At what level is the dividend no longer sustainable? 8 bucks?

You could have sold those two tiny pops and should before Gennette speaks about earnings on 19th.
Always the same guys pumping the stock on pre and after market. And then this is what we get. @5.08 closing and every one jumping in.
Man these retail puts have been easy money. I think I’ve found another winner in Macy’s 
"Some traders know...Look at the $7.50 Call volume or open interest...44,737 contracts..Something is brewing...https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/M/options?date=1595548800&p=M"
Macy’s CEO was very positive about Holiday sales
If M is going to do buybacks they better hurry. It looks like Trump won't be reelected and the Dems have made it clear that buybacks will be severely curtailed.
"Also, as a resident of NYC myself, I had covid four times during last 12 months and I and my wife are fully vaccinated. Wall Street is crazy thinking that covid is over and American mass media are just oblivious. Covid mutates much faster than flu and abundance of chronically ill people who live unhealthy live style help a lot to promote mutations."
M lays a trap for the shorts by pushing out the earnings date.
Here we go. Shorts starting to cover....
All stores open. Shopping season has started. Better days for the stock. Shorts better cover. Super bullish
"we need more patience, thats all. enjoy the 10% annual div and wait."
"This guy graduate from Tsinghua University in China, which is equivalent to the MIT in US, with a BS in automation and business administration, a MS in Automatic Control. He, then, got his PhD in Industrial Engineering from Texas A&M. A very smart guy. Look at his CV. Macy's has been getting rid of incompetent executives such as the former President and the former CFO, and adding smart people like Liu. This will cut the cost and improve the operation efficiency.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/macy-names-xingchu-liu-senior-130000030.html"
The gap to the 200 day is pretty big..... This will snap back any day now.
"Earlier run to mid $7s was on a measly 20M daily volume. No strength whatsoever. Todays selling on a whopping 44M shares. Volume confirms the trend. The trend is down. Sell/short, end the misery, make some money."
40$ company
Morgan Stanley should re-think if they are in the right business. They downgraded M and it goes up more than 10% in 2 weeks! They downgraded NTNX and it goes from $32 to $55 in 2 weeks!
The market has rallied for weeks now and Macy's still sits where it fell. Online retail is the new normal . $3.50 by July
"Let’s ask the Macy’s investors who have previously experienced the dividend payouts in the past, did the payouts significantly affected the stock price afterwards?"
Soon you'll wake up and hear AMZN buys M for 20B including debt. (Herald Square is the ultimate amazon head quarters and Thanksgiving day parade is priceless!) Does anyone know how much per share that is??? It's about 42.
Macy‘s going for a strong close.......... what does that mean shorties? People want to buy this stock! They think it will go to double-digits again. Covid soon over. Bottom in. Uptrend coming. Shorties covering. Squeeze-time just around the corner......... whatever it takes..........
"With the market “crashing” on Christmas Eve and all the other bad economic news in December, I think these numbers are reasonably good."
"Sad to see this happen to Macy's but it is their own fault.Over price items because you have a ""name brand store""What is the difference from buying online for 50% and driving to Macy's to buy for 50% more?....Same as going to Disney and buying a toy for $40, when you can get same toy for $10 at Target. Sorry NOT happening. Lower your overall prices by 50% and Ill shop there."
You people who hold M through ER are either extremely brave or have no knowledge of the way M is treated even when they report Very Good results The after Christmas quarter is their best and the pps is generally flogged anyway. Do you think the $2 move down was just from Kohl's?? i sold 8k shares in the high 16's. All too many times M crashes after reporting. Have you forgotten the August report?? I hope you have puts
Q? 12/15 is record date for div. what if u sell on 12/15 do u still get the div or do your have to sell the next working day? Tkx
Flat... yeah baby!

Margin calls have to be happening. Sorry Folks
$.60 up today
"Hey Moe, I alway’s buy at 3:30 , the arrow is going up, once market closed, after market is going to jump. Moe buy now"
LONG AND STRONG
Come on GameSpot!
Haven’t seen Michael and Matthew today ...lol
"Dear $M longs.I had a look to $AMAZON prime days and so desapointed..$AMAZON was great at start with sheap prices, fast delivery and customer oriented.But nowaday it is more poor quality products, especially on the market place.Prices are no longer good bargain and most of the time you have to return the products because wrong size, bad quality and delivery damage...$M is still keeping attention of healthy people, with iconic brands, sales at the outlet and still really nice customer shopping experience.Don't be afraid by shorters, $M is on his way back with a good up potential."
"I think we are about to witness the turning point the next week or so, this thing either goes back up to 26 or down to 18. This is around where it usually happens."
Undervalued.
"Hello Macy's short seller, this is the Margin clerk I'm sorry to tell you...."
"Pre-market is $5,51:-) Macy‘s seems overdue for a hefty spikey-spikey! Every third outstanding share is sold.......... Let‘s squeeze poor little shorties with great strength and make them cover (buy:-) Whatever it takes........ This Thursday preliminary Q1-sales as well as public fireside-chat with JP Morgan analyst........."
So the options market thinks this may hit 22 tomorrow
Tested and rebounded from $10. Confirms recent bullishness. 75% earnings beat was huge. Buy.
"Please note I was the one saying to purchase Macy's on Monday when it was under $6/share. Not to brag, but my brain is much bigger than the other Eric, whose #1 talent is troll memeing!!!"
Trimmed 10% of my position for a profit and replaced it with a long term call spread. Bought the Jan 2022 18/23 call spread for 1.5. So i pocketed $17 and still get the upside. That is how i plan my trades to reduces risk and make more.
"The senior notes are due 2025 and will be sold in a private offering. Macy's said it would use the offering proceeds plus ""cash on hand"" to repay the credit line. --- That means they not only have CASH to service BUT they are REPAYING with CASH ON HAND. Yay !!! This is easily a $15 stock. On a personal note, We have been shopping online on Macys site and we love their product assortment. Go MACYS !!"
MACY'S BOARD better be buying shares up at 21.50 saving over 7% yield!
97.5% delta hedged with OTM covered calls and long put spreads. Some call it a collar risk reversal. If down tomorrow will sell hedges for a profit and then short more puts. If up tomorrow will let hedges expire and roll short calls.
"""The Mall is dead""....it took me 10 minutes to find a Parking Spot yesterday. Macys had a Huge crowd...i was very impressed"
$11.09 after hours. Expect it to near $12 by the end of Wednesday.
"How Macy’s Stock Could Gain as Baby Boomers Go Shopping AgainBy Connor SmithMay 19, 2021 12:39 pm ET Macy’s stock had only a brief pop in response to the chain’s unexpectedly strong financial results on Tuesday, but an analyst at Evercore ISI says the shares can rise as the economy reopens."
and the winner is...https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/19/12/14914426/black-friday-2019-winners-and-losers-amazon-macys-shopify-and-more?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+benzinga+%28Benzinga+News+Feed%29
MACYS UP TO $8 ..... VERY SOON!They are a REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIO!!!! THEY NET WORTH IS A MINIMUM OF $10 ONLY IN REAL ESTATE VALUE.
"Why is M going down? They borrowed $500,000,000 in their bond sale at 5.75% interest so they can survive a 3rd wave of covid. They're saving so much money by cancelling the dividend last April. So what some of their A and B tier Malls are going bankrupt. M has the money to buy the Mall."
"I think Macy’s will have pretty decent earnings. The things that will keep me awake tonight will be me wondering about their margins, will they cut the dividend and forward guidance."
this was $9.50 last month
"what the blank , the whole markets up , they eased the restrictions and back to normal stocks are in playand this #$%$ is going down what the blank , I short it goes up , I go long it goes downI am blanked , you blank blank #$%$"
It appears many people believe you can buy a stock on the ex-date and receive the dividend. Must buy before ex-date. Everyone should read up on ex-date before investing
You know when a country is broken when the whole of WS is shorting a national institution like Macy's..and not for the right reasons but because they can manipulate the market.
Bottom bound reached. Macy is way oversold and will go up sharply tomorrow!!!
"I would like to ser forward the facts about M. 2019 saw them take a tremendous hit on a women's line that did not pan out. Still they updated 150 stores, paid down half a billion in long term debt, and still will make money for the year. 2020 will see M capitalize on decreasing costs associated with shutting the poorest performing stores and cutting hundreds of middle management jobs and relocating everyone to the east coast. M is not equal to JCP"
t what point do you hold management and BOD responsible for these results ????
"""The company is now reporting aDiluted loss per share of $11.53 and Adjusted Diluted loss per share of $2.03.""To be honest the results are worse than I expected. What do you guys think?"
"Looks like Macy's is going to now travel back up to a new High. I am very excited about the future and M turns the corner and Heads back North. I see ETF adding M and growth will be swift from this point... As Buffett says, ""Opportunities come infrequently. When it rains gold, put out the bucket, not the thimble."" ALL IN..."
"retail sales very bad in winter, I think it's been over, M earnings very good, margins profit very high, stock price too low, it's worth to buy, $36 per share,"
Macys up over $1.00 this morning. Earnings should be decent going into the 4th quarter :-)
Thank you for your money shorty
M crossed. 50 week moving average. First time since Dec 2018.
stock should hit $10 by july 1st
"looted the local M last night, got me some nice jackets and a new pair of sneaks, and we rise 9% by 2pm . classy times I'm living in!"
"Must have been good news today at the meeting, would love to see 6 bucks today!"
"Two new initiatives by M announced today are really brilliant, IMO. In a time of political correctness and sensitivity to race and community, M is emphasizing some very good themes that will resonate within their communities. People are going to be very supportive of these themes because of their true ""American"" values. There is no other chain that I am aware of, indeed, no other business that is launching these sorts of campaigns mixed with their sales programs. It will be good for worker morale and for building a better attitude of potential customers who will want to support a store that espouses openly these themes. Very smart business. See these PRs:https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190910005256/enandhttp://pdf.reuters.com/htmlnews/htmlnews.asp?i=43059c3bf0e37541&u=urn:newsml:reuters.com:20190910:nBw3Wdj67a"
Macy‘s going green. Epic rebound coming up! EPIC!!!
"“We experienced a steady uptick in our digital business in April, which was encouraging, but only partially offset the loss of sales from the stores, we expect business to recover gradually. With two weeks of results from reopened stores, customer demand is moderately higher than we anticipated,” said Gennette. “We are closely watching consumer behavior as we reopen more stores, and we remain flexible as we navigate this crisis.’ – CEO Jeff Gennette.https://www.rli.uk.com/270-macys-stores-to-open-today/"
"As GS downgraded Macys, they added 2M shares last quarter."
I think we closed at $10 tomorrow..
Mute Michael. Probably shorter....
"After Covid is over, TGT and WMT shoppers will come back to M.. because they can in the future..Mall shopping from Non-essential to shopholically essential..."
"Given the short volume, we could push $9 by the end of the week."
"Buy when there is blood on the streets......... and check back when all 775 Macy‘s stores/malls have reopened by mid June the latest........ Macy‘s will survive this storm, no doubt! Back to normal, back to double digits again. Buy the stock, then you have nothing to worry and all the time needed for this American icon to rise and shine again. Buy now, be rewarded big time later.......... just sayin.......,"
I am still not selling.
don't panic
"Longs - please look at the 2 year chart, how fast M has come up, huge short interest, etc. - all of the sign point towards a pump and dump. You are going get trapped by the big guys, at least in the short term. A popular misconception about short interest is the exciting prospect of the famous ""short squeeze"" that's always about to happen. In reality though, high short interest is a negative and short squeeze rarely happens."
Several analysts have recently raised their Q1 earnings projections and expect M to exceed the $.40.consensus. I’m holding 3.000 shares and have my fingers crossed.
"“Combined with our ongoing Polaris initiatives, we are confident this liquidity will ensure Macy’s, Inc. remains a strong company to work for, invest in and partner with.”"
Huge beat. Raised FY guidance. Now we just need analysts to update forecasts to realistic numbers. Waiting for the upgrades. Shorts look hosed.
The Mall area is packed. It takes 40 minutes to go 8 miles during rush hour this week and the parking lots in town as well as store lines are jamming. But I noticed we lost 25% in 5 days. Am I missing something I was not paying attention to $M the last few days
"Well, we know M isn't cutting their dividends."
I am reading ER again and again to find what is wrong in it. Did you guys find any? Is because of asset sales?
Do you really want to give me a 7% yield?
Any reason to believe it goes above pre pandemic $17? I've made a small profit this month btw.
"Shorted at 33.93,hoping to make a nice profit tomorrow."

Macy recovery road continues... YTD performance is impressive. 2021
Up we go 
I will be getting my big dividends check first of August and will wait patiently for the stock to climb back up and enjoy the dividends till I cash out. God bless Macy’s and American people for their support to Macy’s store of America.
"I said last week ""This is going all the way back up for sure."" I knew it. Good thing I added to my position on the big dip. :)"
"""upgrades are expected to include new LED lighting and flooring, renovated fitting rooms and restrooms, along with moving some departments to better take advantage of customer traffic."" Renovated fitting rooms? You mean those fitting rooms that have been littered with pins and trash? That employees never clean? Moving some departments to take better traffic? It's too bad you can't move them all next to the clearance rack because that's where most of the traffic is, lol."
Last Friday we closed at $12.88 this Friday $15.15. I call that a winning week for longs. Let's hope if this continues that the divided will be reinstated. TGIF to all!
"Macy's Inc (NYSE: M), SHORT interest Recent Surge; $327.9 million increase to 47-Million/Shs (13.02% to 15.25%). lol"
"Hey Shorts, listen up, with over 100,000+ a month going to Macy's online web site to shop, ""Macy’s investments in its digital platform have been yielding. During the second quarter, digital sales surged 53% from the year-ago quarter’s figure and contributed 54% to total-owned comparable sales. The company plans to continue investing in its digital platform, especially in terms of capacity expansion."" ~~~ I hear Macy's is now selling KY Jelly for Shorts !!!"
"Toojo who put the question 53 minutes ago (about 9pm PST) I think we should all have been pondering the question of what is going on with the 1st quarter results. Please add onto my guesses if you have anything else. 1. somebody (or more than 1 person) in the accounting department has been sick and not working, particularly if it's somebody high up who does the final combining of the figures and notes 2. I assume with the stores closing 3/18 somebody or several have had plenty of time to take the inventory which didn't need to be rushed as usual (assuming they take an actual inventory at the end of the quarter instead of relying on a computer figure) since they had 42 days through 4/30 to do this leisurely therefore that really can't be the problem 3. They are trying to look at the figures from different locations rather than working in one department the way they usually would and that makes it much more difficult to see what they are doing on different screens and trying to combine things. I'd think it still wouldn't take that much more time though. 4 they (the management) know the results will be mediocre and they want to wait until they have some good news to report at the same time--for example by the end of June we now have some new financing and/or we have new sales figures for May and June which may be getting close to normal etc. so the bad news will be minimized with the good news which they release at the same time Obviously everybody who has mentioned how many shares Yachtman and Blackrock (and all the other institutional holders and mutual funds) own should be trying to contact them (maybe a couple of you could pick a name and try). I think somebody owning 38 million shares might have enough clout to get the president of Macy's to give them the reason(s) why this is being delayed and you could ask them. If I owned millions of shares I certainly would be asking for the reason for the delay."
"Chomping through $25 resistance, soon to march towards $30. All aboard!"
The next Macy's parade is about to start.....
UPGRADES COMING !!!! $25 PLUS.... by end of week!!!
This is holding up very nicely right now considering the run up we have had recently and the fact that today is ex-div day. Very strong performance actually.
We desperately need Macys to start a share buyback program. Would definitely stabilize the share price...
About to go green. Killed ER some different results then slightly expected 4% div and online is booming with brick and mortar
$5.50 tomorrow
"Over reaction due to Corona Virus fear. Company is doing good, Dividend is good.Hopefully should be ok in long run. $M has way better P/E than competition. On management now how fast it handles loss making store closings and then turns it around. I am long. Similar stocks $JWN, $DDS,$ KSS etc.in the same retail category are down."
Apparel Sales are SOARING..... Think of all the job interviews taking place and will take place..... All those heading back to work.......
Vaccine news drove this stock to 5% + today. Earnings will have a much bigger impact. Today's surge is indication of what is coming within the next 3 weeks.
Last quarter online sales were 38% of total sales for Macy's and management has made a big push into internet sales. I think they finally have their act together when it comes to E commerce. When Target and Walmart made a big push into online retailing to compete with Amazon their stocks both took off. Hoping that happens here. Either way this is a very cheap stock.
"$6.50 Call-Options gained 158% Profit already Today Alone. Take some Money off the table Tomorrow, this won't last."
I have been searching for a site that will send me extra income producing stock tips and I think ive finally found it. If you are like me and in need of stock tips that produce good monthly income then you need to go to (http://Multistockalerts.com) now!
"Lesson number 1: when a stock ignore negative newsflow, research, articles, spammers is bullish sign!!!"
"Physical retail stores will not survive especially those that don’t own any brand, but just a middle man with a lot of overhead, like Macy’s. I shorted some today. Good luck to all!"
Buy a bunch of shares this morning at $12.43 and now my average cost is $12.51 (11.5% Dividend). Thank you to whoever sold those shares to me this morning :)
"Macy's has a blowout quarter. The earnings release was far better than the street expected (and many said so). Yes, there were some short sellers covering early, which is not unusual, but this 'all day selloff' is nothing more than emotional selling — it has no base in the financial or the forward guidance of the company. It's just that people get scared. And there are a lot of people in this market today that have never faced a strong sell off...so they overreact. Which is what I saw happening today with Macy's. This is a great American company that will be back over .38 in no time. But today was something of an anomaly. If you have the money, Macy's at this level or under $35 is a terrific buying opportunity. I was a big buyer today."
The Dow is up 350 points and M is flat. If you haven't looked all the retailers are down today. Wall Street MM's are rotating out of the retailers and into Tech. Target and Wall Mart area different type of retail so no comparisons please. We're heading to $12-$14 in my opinion.
Remember that Macy's took a $3.2 billion non=cash impairment charge in the 1st quarter of fiscal 2020. Remaining goodwill now sits at $0.8 billion.
"There is a lot of pent-up demand for spending, I have the same $125 in my pocket that I had one week ago, I have nothing to spend my money on other than groceries. Once stores start opening I will be a consumer once again, I am realistic, it may take some time but it will happen, only one way for this stock to go and that's up, you'll be sorry shorting this, at some point you've gotta turn positive on this you just can't stay negative on Macy's, once dividend is restored some time next year this will be a rocket."
Some people are going to wish they bought today. Tremendous gains coming.
"Macy’s CEO just bought 546,757 shares of the company"
M oversold. Huge short interest. Billions in Real Estate value. Expanding M offerings.Margins stable. look for earings to expand going into 2020. easier comps coming. Buy back will only boost earings and increase the value of the dividend.
Profit taking. Will buy back tomorrow
they dont start divindend.it is very very good!!!
What is keeping Macys alive the real estate?
No volume means MAX PAIN at $15 don't tell me the MM's don't have the power to do it. Kiss your Puts and Calls goodbye. After March 19th nothing holds Macy's back.
"Are things getting better or worse? Unemployment numbers down by 100,000. Coronus daily rates dropping fast! Were 400,000 per day and yesterday only 114,000 nationally! Deaths dropping rapidly. Even without the vaccine natural immunity kicks in people! Vaccines being moved into high gear! Yes we have several highly effective vaccines!Huge covid bill passed weeks ago with money yet to fully flow and even bigger one now being passed.Public us flush with cash! Expect a banner year for beaten down retailers like macys that have far less competition"
"The trend is: Airlines, Banks and Retailers, and trend is your friend!"
"Koder, look at what a joke Zacks analysts are. This was posted 7 days ago. So in seven days we go from ""Strong Sell"" to a ""Buy"", really? Macy's, Inc.’s (M - Free Report) shares have underperformed the industry in the past three months. Notably, shares of this Cincinnati, OH-based company have tumbled approximately 30% in the past three months, wider than the industry’s decline of 11.2%. This Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock has also underperformed the Retail-Wholesale sector and S&P 500 Index that declined 3.2% and 2.4%, respectively, in the said time frame. Further, the stock is trading close to its 52-week low of $14.11."
"Simply, Covid made Macy's a better company in terms of focus. For instance, they now view themselves as a digital, omni-channel store. Together with the closing of under-performing stores and belt tightening, not to mention the playing field narrowing, dramatically, M could reach $50 this year."
"Short Squeeze to the moon! Just like APRN, TLRY, ACB, and now M!"
"Thanks for bringing the share price under $8I was able to average down last night's AH buys, and I am now well in the green!Looking forward to $10+ again soon! :)"
why is it down ?
Sales report pretty much useless to determine 4 q sales remember Thanksgiving was later than usual.
Malls are packed in the south! Come Monday it will be alright!
Just went shopping. Crowd was just as big as the holidays. It's coming back!
I’m in NC and as of Thursday it has been like Black Friday every where that is now open. And all the beaches are packed again as well.
next stop might be the high of 33.17 on 2/21/17
Tepid earnings' estimates relative to how much consumers wallets are being padded by the gov't. Up we go!
I dont understand why this is below $17Mall is full folks are out shopping
"alert: immediate buy on Thursday August 6. Buy Target: anywhere below $6.65 per share.Hold 8-18 months, Target Sell Price at least $12Insight: This company has been around forever through much thick and thin. They have adapted to the COVID situation and are not going anywhere!One retailer's problems = another retailer's opportunity. Time to think the herd and make the correct play on the strong survivor.Below is a list of just some familiar retailers filing for bankruptcy thus far in 2020:Ascena Lord & TaylorTailored BrandsRTW RetailwindsBrooks Brothers G-Star Raw Lucky Brand J.C. PenneyStage Stores Aldo Neiman MarcusJ. Crew Roots USATrue ReligionModell's Sporting GoodsArt Van Furniture Bluestem Brands Pier 1As others go bankrupt - this is music to $M's ears."
"I have been a Macy's shopper for years. I went to the store I always go to a few days back.1) Wanted to buy new China. No longer in the store. 2) Wanted to buy new silverware. Again, no longer in the store.3) Wanted to buy Waterford crystal. They had a couple pieces but a fraction of what they had in years past.There were very few service folks around, but when I finally found one and asked about these products I was told to ""BUY IT ONLINE"". Seriously? I assume they meant the Macy's website. (LOL.)So I went online and bought the goods-on Amazon. I specifically went there to look at the products and that is the one value Macy's always had over Amazon. Well, that value is gone now. I cancelled my Macy's card later that day.I am not a stockholder but this is how the stores are being run now. This company is finished and will go the way of Sears. Maybe not today, or this month, or even this year. But it is over. No way this company can survive when the store staff is telling customers to ""go online"". Sincerely,A long time former customer."
Google may buy Macy's for $30/share to compete with Amazon...Google will lead online and brick and mortar
"FANTASTIC UP $1 SO FAR , JUST BOUGHT THE STOCK THE OTHER DAY , 750 SHARES @ 15.98"
anyone thinks this will go up or should I sell?
"If you read the Moody's credit upgrades and downgrades, you'll will find a Mall has defaulted on its loan modification. The Mall is anchored by Macys, Belk's, JC Penney and Kohl's and is 70% to 85% occupied. JCP and Belk's are in bankruptcy. The same Mall failures caused Radio Shack to file bankruptcy twice in seven years. Radio shack had over 1000 locations and now a handful. I'm sure gald M sold the $500,000,000 in bonds when they did. Breathing space for the future."
"4th quarter earnings will be okay, I believe.Macy’s is here to stay."
"BOYS...I WILL CLEAR THE CONFUSION. CLOTHING AINT THE SAME AS FOOD. AN APPLE IS AN APPLE...BUY IT CHEAP. BUT A DRESS...AINT A DRESS. MANY MORE FACTORS THAN PRICE. IF YOU THINK MACYS IS ALL ABOUT PRICE...WELL, YOU AINT REAL SMART. SURE...ITS A FACTOR, BUT IT AINT EVERYTHING LIKE WITH FOOD!!! WISE UP !!!!"
"Wow another downgrade!!$12 price target that has to be a private equity takeover at that price...06:33 Macy's rating change at Credit Suisse Macy's downgraded to Underperform from Neutral at Credit Suisse. Credit Suisse analyst Michael Binetti downgraded Macy's to Underperform from Neutral with a price target of $12, down from $19."
"Once everyone is back to work sooner than most think, they will put the Dividend back in! yes over 8 to 10.00 with in 6 weeks will be thinking what a investment because where can you double or triple your investment in a short time but here! Good Luck to all!"
"Sorry Guys just looked a the calendar and mis-spoke, one more day of Pump before earning. Which is Tuesday not Monday. Sorry for the error."
I wish Yahoo would let you see how many times users have been muted by others. Would surely be helpful.
"Buy Macy,s it is going up"
"Short interest rose to 93,130,00, shares, up 11.6%."
Put in sell orders for all my shares at $90......not certain that affects the shorts. Hope it essentially reduces availability for them to acquire cheap shares??? Comments welcome
"If you want a winner company and winner stock . Macy's is for sure not it and Macy's future only has wasting the rest of the real estate money then having to file bankruptcy. Told you last week to sell Macy and buy IPOE/ SoFi if you wanted a winner with a future. Still not to late to sell Macy's and pick up SoFi last week it would have been one for one , now Macy's has dropped in price and it's still a good deal to sell Macy's and buy IPOE/ SoFi If you want a real winner that can make you lots of money."
"I don't care what anyone says. If macys is finally closing 20% of their store count and only losing roughly 5% of their sales revenue i'm for it all the way. The top 150 stores does 50% and the bottom 125 does only 5%? i'm suprise the market isn't rallying more heavily on the news it's a big deal. 1.5B in projected savings from this restructuring and 600M from this year alone. But of course they choose again to use these funds to remodel another 100 Growth stores and open another 50 backstages this year, 7 of which are free standing. Makes you wonder tho... why are they opening the same amount of backstages and remodeling same amount of growth stores this year as last? Could it be it's really actually working?! Heaven forbid management knows something we don't. I would think they know with a bit more certainty this year b/c it's going to cost 1B again."
"Market had 2 major positive days this week, why is M down on both days?"
"PE will be prodded in at this price. The stores are on a path to better performance, and the real estate value is only going higher. Just a guess, but it's clear the stores are seeing increased dominance versus the competition, or demise thereof."
Let‘s go for a strong finish! Tomorrow big news coming......... Go Macy‘s go!
Warren B. is biding his time before major purchase. Macy's is worth $40 just on real estate alone.
The whole market is down today creating a buying opportunity for those who missed getting in earlier. Next week this will be back up and more.
Another new low today. The downward trend continues. So glad I jumped ship many moons ago.
Easter rally starts next week.
I added
"Can you imagine the value of the real estate if they converted every location into upscale housing units, the penthouse on the primary Macy's store and the primary Bloomingdale store in NYC would equate to their annual earnings."
that 17 is sooooo close!
Remember divvy chasers. GameStop had a 25 percent dividend. Until they didn’t. And don’t tell me Macy’s is different. It ain’t!
Those in favor of allocating dividends for the sole purpose of share buybacks at these levels... Thumbs up for Yes! Thumbs down for No!

Macy’s is undervalued ! Buy buy buy !
Dec-09-19 Downgrade Goldman Sachs Neutral → Sell $19 → $12Oct-18-19 Downgrade Credit Suisse Neutral → Underperform $19 → $12
No announcement from Macy's to give bonuses to store and operations employee after tax bill passed ........I'm not surprised.
The Donald's tax cut takes hold.Best 1st quarter since 1999.
AS life returns to normal in the USA stocks like Macys and KSS will see a return to normal sales and consistent quarterly profits as precovid saw.Of course then future quarters will see favorable comparisons to the covid forced closure quarters.Goldman Sachs stocks like KSS and Macys will benefit while FANG will be lose. We see that pattern today.
"Let's go M. American companies can win. Invest in M, JC Penney's; stop ordering from AMZN. This is the DEAL of a lifetime."
UBS tried but couldn't get us below where we finished a couple days ago. They did throw the momentum that was brewing on the chart out of wack but the market will adjust
I raise M to $35 from $15. Strong buy!
"Imagine waking up to learning Amazon just offered Macys $50/share for its company and premarket the shares are selling at $48/share. There are 150 million short shares of Macys outstanding so such an event would culminate in a massive multibillion dollar loss, permanent loss of those shorting MACYS.Now that is FEAR!Share holders would cheer it. As for the 2nd quarter results, all the bad is baked in the stock and then some too."
"This message board is 95% shorts,"
take a lesson
$Billions and $billions and $billions spent on Christmas and holiday gifts.Macy’s is sure to get their share of the business
there going miss earnings
25% gone in less than a month. Can it do 50% in a quarter? Gennette breaking records with new lows every single quarter for years.
"Ironman-""The market hates macy's""...that's funny I'm up 7% on Macys. This is just the beginning too."
Making up for eleven months of slow sales in the month from Black Friday to Christmas Eve is a difficult business model in which to prosper.
Macy's is up 11.85% to 20.95
Macy's likewise got a new $28 price target vs. Cowen's previous $23 prediction.
"Shorties feeling more and more pain.......... punish them for shorting this great American icon! A third of all Macy‘s-shares sold short........... tick tock tick tock............. I see a very hefty short-squeeze coming up here............. Let‘s act according to the short-squeeze-script/ manual: remove all sell-orders and heat up the squeeze with heavy buying! These poor souls desperately need your shares. The higher the stockprice, the more they‘re willing to pay! Macy‘s WILL survive. Returning to double-digits.......... whatever it takes..........."
WOW get ready to go a lot higher someone sold 15 million shares on the close and it only drop to $15.37 and M is up after hours . M is going a lot higher before Dec 12 2019
"Well i believe M should bounce back in next couple of months, but time is money and i am losing patience with being down -20% in my portfolio. Might be time to cut my losses and allocate in better stocks? Thoughts?"
If the company is so undervalued why isn’t management considering a LBO... If the company is so undervalued why aren’t they buying back stock ?If the company is so undervalued why isn’t a PE firm investing ?If the company is so undervalued why isn’t the board doing its duty and unlocking shareholders value by directing management to increase stock price?If the company is undervalued why is it lagging behind its peers in stock price performance?Somebody at Macy’s should recognize that shareholders are angry and dismayed by the lack of meaningful action by the board and management to regain valuation that is DOWN 67% from its all time high and 40% DOWN in the last year!!!BOD do your jobs !! Bb
You think Cramer shills for GS and MS? Sure seems like it - one day he’s interviewing Macy’s CEO and saying he likes what he sees and how great they are and a week later he’s trashing it - make up your mind!
Think a vaccine is coming in the next year? Think rates are staying low? A double double n 2021
I've officially declared M a growth stock.
"Down over 20% in a month. A new 52 week low every day...and people are still talking about undervalued. No, its going down because no one wants it; it has a disease."

"Macy's pre-pandemic dividend is $1.5 per year. With all the accepted inflation, the dividend can only become better provided the company executes well. If Macy's starts dividend again, what would be the stock price?"
Shorted more today at $16.04. They should close their Puerta Rico store and sell their corporate jets. Trying to buy to cover at $15.53. Zombie Macy's department stores was a Bloomburg phrase over the weekend.
Nordstrom sales fall 2 percent - stock moves up 10 percent
"Please, please hit $15. I have ANOTHER short order in that I would like to get filled.So far shorting Macy's has paid for 3 semesters of my daughter's college.Almost halfway there."
What’s going on?
"Well, I just placed a huge bet on Macy's. I think it'll do well for me. I like that the economy is in decent shape. Retail sales are solid and jobless claims are not rising. I may get out after the holidays, which I think will be strong for Macy's."
$7.00 coming Tomorrow
SHORTS will be in trouble soon
"With all due respect, how can some of you be long given the state of the economy and retail shopping? Shouldn't you wait until stores start opening and consumers trickle in to decide whether to buy? We will have record high unemployment numbers, and consumers will not be going shopping if they don't have a job. Fitch cut the credit rating to ""junk"" status. Their 10-K even says, ""The Company's liquidity may be negatively impacted if its stores do not resume normal operations and the Company may be required to pursue additional sources of financing to meet its financial obligations."" They will not get favorable financing with a ""junk"" status. They even say their ""ability to grow depends in part on our stores remaining relevant to customers."" Additionally, they are experiencing disruptions in the supply chain. Consumers that are working are also becoming more comfortable with shopping online. Macy's is in trouble and will be for some time."
8 million shares in the 1st hr of trading and no real justification for the drop
Good article by Doug Kass todayHe’s positive on Macy’s turnaround
Will reach double digits expecting a good earnings. Online sales should be good as other retail players
"I think this is going back to the 16 support, I'll pick up more at 16.5. Are my figures wrong???? Round numbers - We have here a company with $8B in debt - $2B in cash and $5B in Market cap. so if you bought this thing and paid off the debt and pocketed the cash its costing you 11B. It then throws off $5B a year in cash, so you get your money back in 2 years. After that, everything is gravy, the real-estate in the middle of NYC, all the real-estate across America (Valued at $15B). and any cash flow you can milk out of it. So to recap, for $11B I get $15B in real-estate, and cash flow of $5B a year. And the promise of this admittedly so so management team maybe waking up and figuring out how to grow retail in the 21st century."
"Hey Newbies calling for Short-Squeeze--The Opposite, Shorts increased by 22% from 129.71-M to 158.63-M, roughly a 29-Million Gain, Dikheadz. lol"
Looks like we will see $12 in the next for weeks but this stock may drop to $3 before it will start marching higher
$25 by Dec.
M taking a beating today was hoping to be back over 22. Holding 
Hi this is RobertMacy's will survive The shortys are winning nowthe real winners for the long term are......the longs
Why is Macy's going up? Can't find anything in the news to explain this. Glad it's going up.
Covid is a passing thunderstorm. Stocks most affected by covid are going to rise the fastest and largest amount when it passes and the sun returns. Management has taken a very conservative long term approach with plenty of funds to last a very long storm.
Market is finally showing weakness and I am again holding a short position here. 26.75. Let's see if my Macy's bearish theory (clouded with doubts lol) is still worth considering. I won't post when I will cover .. unless someone specifically wants to know.
Now Urban Outfitters in trouble. More pie for the big M
people high on pessimism!
"Shortly after Hal Lawton became president of Macy’s, the stock started rising. Now he has picked a new CTO he knows well from his days at Home Depot, Naveen Krishna. Naveen and Hal overlapped for 5 years at Home Depot. Naveen built up HD’s web presence and run a good team. This should bode well for Macy’s future."
"Interesting“The summer and fall stages of the U.S. recovery have been marked by incredibly strong retail and housing sales, which have both surpassed pre-COVID levels by a wide margin,” wrote Jefferies. “Due to the torrid pace of sales and virus-related supply disruptions, inventory-to-sales ratios have plummeted to record lows.”The Evercore ISI survey found that none of the consumer-business respondents thought inventory levels were “too high” or “a little too high.” Only 10% said they were “about right,” with 30% believing they were “a little too low” and 60% answering “too low.” So if retail sales are so good why M not doing better??"
"Many interested people are probabaly looking into the steps of Macys recently especially after announcing its option market. Check the disclaimer on my landing page. Moreover, there could be a tipping point for drug policy absent of any federal reform. Why not see it for yourself? Dig in! http://b.link/UnderTheRadarBillionWorthMedicalGreens"
"Good buy here because the current dividend yield is worth the risk. IMO, M has a very good plan that will return the company to EPS and Sales growth, lower the debt and reduce the cost of the dividend with share buybacks. The upside is $40/share while the downside is very limited comparatively. Even if they do not execute the in store plan perfectly, the internet sales are growing nicely. The tariff problem will be solved one way or another soon enough. Grabbing a good dividend while you wait for improvements in operating performance makes sense for this retailer. As their 150 store improvement plan brings in more customers, and their new discount programs bring in more customers, M's just needs the right product and price mix and they know how to find that, IMO. In the late stages of the current market rally, this type of value play with a 5 PE, and a 10+% yield, on a very profitable old line company, where the low price is result of a market over-reaction on the down side that brings it to a bottom or near bottom, on a with a company that is making only small sales gains, and temporary profit volatility, seems more sensible than looking for a high priced growth company that will fall sharply at the first sign of a slow down."
"Now that SP is almost at par with precovid, people thinking of taking their gains and moving to other stocks that haven’t recovered?It’s hard to believe this will surpass 2019 levels when there is less money in the average American’s hand to spend on retail goods.I’m amazed it made it this far, this fast.Good luck to all"
"The money supply of 5 trillions is a key indicator to watch during this business cycle and most importantly its part within the sector rotation,I tend to believe that a tsunami of cash will flow into the brick and mortar business which constitutes 80% of the retail industry,Since Macy’s is one of the only few survivors in this industry, I’m doubling down on my equity,"
Back in the green! + a massive dividend.
Next stop is the 20s and then beyond!!
Tomorrow fireworks dudes...Shorts just get stuck on all retailers today
I've been trying to tell shorts these last few days about Macy's $20BN in real estate assets.
Eric is going to have you lose all your money in Macy's because Macy's is run by DEM wit screw ups that have miss used and wasted all the shareholders money to line their own pockets. Like DEM witted ads that cost millions but sell nothing . Just to make some DEM witted statement
"Surreal.. Makes me think of Korvettes, across Macy's on 34th Street. Remember them?"
Huge marketing campaign for reopened stores online and in newspapers... back to normal step by step now... 775 Macy‘s to reopen beginning tomorrow....
Wow. Did Cramer finally change his tone on Macy’s during the lightning round? He has been bashing it for so long.
"Remember that guy, yeah me, that said market sell off would trigger rotation out of risky names like Macy's to reliable names that were taken down with market. You are welcome."
Shorts want a div cut so that the stock sells off
Another chance to buy on the dip. Macy's ain't Gap.
$7.15 is the new $5. There is a lot of resistance at this level. It will only go up from here.
"only high ranking retailers and high ranking things maker have more room to growth, others sales have been top-end, no room to growth, M still #1 worthest to buy, all high ranking retailers sales of 2018 were stable, so economic growth will turn into high ranking things growth in this year, so Macy's will return to new high, some investors still buy AMZN tgt and wmt, they will lose money,"
"The only thing shortseller can use against you is by keep repeating Macy's and JCPenney is the same. Looking at how JCP business was prior to covid 19 was a lot worse than Macy's. Ofcourse Macy's is a risk, but with possible high rewards as well."

This things going to be at $7.5 by 1pm pacific time. Just saying
what caused rising?? What do you thing? Is it retailed investors from reddit trying squeeze shorts or strong company?
"Don't listen to any of the pessimists here. Most are shorties, they have no idea what they are talking about. They will try to scare you to sell so that they can cover. Some had a target of $3 just 2 weeks ago. Surely, there will be ups and downs throughout the day, and they will try to use that convince you. Bottom line is, stock had over 100% return within the last 1 month. Retail is recovering at a rapid rate. That's all there is to know."

"What am I missing here? M market cap = ONE STORE piece of real estate (Manhattan) and market cap equals 25% of its just its real estate portfolio.**Dividend is 10.2%..safely covered by the most negative M analyst going forward.**Book value is $20/share.**Market value equals 0.18% of annual sales.**Debt has been reduced 5 straight years.If retail doesn’t improve, won’t an activist push to do a REIT? Or force a sale to a buyer who could pay a HEFTY PREMIUM and get the whole business and vastly understated valuable trophy real estate for BOOK VALUE?!I don’t see how this can possibly not work at this price. Even with a soft retail sales environment."
Wow! Look at that volume.
Huge buying opportunity!!!
"Again the Market had a drop, but M held strong. A solid stock with resiliency. We'll see M cross the $30 point, again, tomorrow."
People will start buying more stuff!!
"For Macy's to survive, it needs to do the following(1) Remove excessive number of stores(2) Remove excessive white collar workers.3) Increase the number of back stages(4) Cooperation with expensive foods5) Rejuvenation of the management team⑥Connection with women"
"Based on Starboard analysis the Bloomingdale's real estate is worth anywhere from $2-4 billion so if they sell Bloomingdale's to private equity they could get $4-5 Billion for the Bloomingdale's chain. I would pay off all debt and keep Macy's, expand Blue Mercury and keep Credit Card business"
I love Macy's. Great online experience and the pick up in store is good too. They hire well as far as I have been able to observe. I am still shopping Macy's through this pandemic.
very nice bullish trend line. need to break the 18.5$ and then we will go fast up
Some hack dividend investor is buying this thinking they are getting a free 20%..talk about lost.
Did I mention Macy's has $7.5 Billion dollars of Liquidity.... yes $$7.5 billion dollars at disposal so ..
"Macy's has been down graded to a ""SELL"" with a price prediction of right around $13."
When JCP enterprise value is nearly 50% that of Macy's you know there's something really whacky going on folks.
Wow strong hold at $16.50 Please come down a little bit please and go back on Monday
I had M shorted at $21 but felt scared to hang on due to high dividend. How do you deal with that? Work around the dividend or just push through?
Cramer just said Blue horseshoe loves M
Just my humble opinion. But I think this stocks hits 30 by years end. Eventually price and earnings must converge.
M is run by DEM wits and here is even more proofhttps://finance.yahoo.com/m/a382a90b-5b6b-383d-97c6-1e6630bac42a/california-banned-fur-sales.html
who thinks this is a buying opportunity?
TRUMP just signed a agreement with Mexico and now Mexico tariff is suspended indefinitely. He got Mexico to send troops to their borders to stop the flow of migrants. Once China and US finalize an agreement (inevitable) retail stocks benefit immensely. But here's something else to think about since Macy's ended 2018 with nearly 1.2B of cash on hand why did they decide to invest 1B (yes 1B) into renovating more stores and opening more backstages and blue mercury instead of buying back a massive amount of stocks or even paying down another 1B in debt? EIther they are very stupid or very smart. I'm leaning towards the latter bc they have the results and they see the numbers coming in from Growth50 stores and Backstages / Bluemercury. Once all the trade war noise settles the market will realize what M has done and appreciate the investments M has made and the stock will be back above 40. Long M
"Short sellers are hoping for weakness to buy back. Others are so pessimistic they are adding to their short positions. Eventually the shorts will capitulate as the stock continues its march upward. It has worked for them in the past, and creatures of habit it is difficult for them to break the habit.Eventually capitulation will result in a massive rise in this stock.Nearly all Macys stores were open this full quarter for the first time this year.Expect earnings and sales to beat expectations by a wide margin.FDA approval of this new 90 percent effective covid vaccine will come in two weeks.Flu vaccines typically are only 40-60 percent effective, while this new covid vaccine is MORE THAN 90 percent effective. They plan to have a billion doses by next year which is enough to completely eradicate covid from the world.Covid is a thing of the past.Trumps trade war and tariffs will all be reversed by the New president.Biden stated he plans to eliminate all of Trumps tariffs and actions.The trade war is ended and so is covid. Very bullish for Macys. Will be back up to $40 soon."
"JWN Full price store comp sales down -6.5%, The Rack down -1.9%, JCP down -6% (-9% including appliances), GAP down -7%, OLD Navy Down -5%, KOHLS down -3.4%. Macys sames store comp sales UP +.3%. Yet the market reaction to Macy's after earnings sending shares down 20% from 19.30 to 15.50 doesn't seem right. Especially having already falling another 25% after the January 10th sell off when they pre-announced x-mas wasn't as good as expected. Looks like Macy's shouldn't have ran so much promotions and allowed the same store comps to fall 5% and beat earnings instead. Just my 2 cents."
"Full disclosure for those so inclined and worried about me lol. Thanks for the dollar, closed trade. I'm sure I'll be back, probably not before earnings though."
"2019 results will be bad, 2020 Q1 will balance a bit dispite low sales due to COV as net earnings may raise becasuse of closure of stores. holding till Q1 results will give clear pciture where the company would be heading"
"I don't know if anybody was watching the action yesterday in the AH, a lot of interest pushed Macys almost to 8 bucks, I took profits yesterday during the regular session and watched it continue to climb in the AH, glad for the pullback today allowed me to get back in lower than what I sold for yesterday, this WILL see 8 bucks today with market cooperation. Good luck longs! Mo Man Ski is still on ignore!"
"You guys are insane, you are trading a stock in it's worst price since the company raised 4.5 Billions. Macys is not in risk of bankruptcy. Do your homework and don't sell your shares. ""The stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient."" - Warren Buffett."
Nobody wants to continue sustaining these type of losses. There isn’t a bottom in sight and I don’t think that the worst is over
"This thing is going up and up. Three days now the shorts try to push it down out of the gate, it bounces back just like M's stores and online platform. $20 by end of week - mark this post ladies"
Fake news is keeping Macy’s pps below $15.
HELLO after doing my dd I took a small position in M. I own top blue chip stocks so I money to spare on a small position. I must say this stock is VERY MANIPULATED. That said I don't see why people are selling at the current level. M is a flagship store in the Malls and imho not going away. Has paid a dividend since 2002 and with the low payout ratio I believe it is safe. Many woman I know like to shop at M. Will probably add if we go lower. Yield is over 10% and safe imo. Certainly the co is oversold imo. See a margin of safety here and potential huge upside. Best of luck to all longs.
officially a higher high today.
why is PRICE PAULA AChief Financial Office leaving and cashing out all of her shares ?
whats todays price target? 12 13? 11 is a given but seems to me resistance is a t 12.80 range
Hedge with few puts here...have lot of calls.. finger cross it will skyrocket tomorrow!

"A article was just released regarding the investor meeting next friday. Stating macy will Miley release information closing stores. This obviously look bad on Macys, however knowing the earnings are coming up which are expected to be great and they should also be giving a good growth plan. Do you see this meeting come out as a positive or negative impact? curious on yalls thoughts."
Expected to beat the earnings estimates. Scenario one is seeing great price appreciation pre-earnings and then profit taking. Scenario 2 is huge earnings surprise and price making new highs after earnings release too. Either way it's going up
"I bought 1000 shares on Monday - I am pretty long term on Macy’s so I really don’t mind the dips and can pretty much hold on. Plus I am blessed to be in a strong cash position, so I don’t have a worry in the world "
Macys is a great long term investment.Not a trade.
No extreme growth in revenue but a consistent earnings makes a good long. Buy before the revenue earnings announcement. It's all about profitability.
Question i understand about Macy real estate holdings. But did not Sears once have vast real estate holdings and go bk? so what is the difference?
At $21.09 buybacks should be of high priority and best use of some cash on hand. If the board waits until the leverage ratio is just a tad lower to buy the stock will be back above $25-30. As an investor sometimes it's okay to switch policys especially when there is such a big price difference between fair value and current price! You could buy a profitable M for 6B and keep all the dividends and profits!
$7 today could happen..
"I posted a few days ago that Macy's manaement was meeting with JP Morgan in San Francisco on May31 and Los Angeles on June 1Today this afternoon Guess What??....Macy's price target raised to $41 from $35 at J.P. Morgan3:05 pm ET June 5, 2018 (MarketWatch)Share Print(END) Dow Jones NewswiresJune 05, 2018 15:05 ET (19:05 GMT)"
Macy's just updated its tender offer from 450M to 525M. This could set M up for buybacks if this quarter does okay. EBITDA should be below 2.8 with this deleveraging. Run the numbers!
"UPS Notified Drivers Across U.S. To Stop Picking Up Packages At Six Retailers: L.L. Bearn, Hot Topic, New Egg, Macy's, Gap And Nike; The Message Said 'No exceptions'.

"Josh Brown was on CNBC yesterday evening and nailed it with what he mentioned about M. I loaded up in ""after hours"" at $15.69 and $15.70 and will receive the handsome divy. In addition I'm now in an unrealized capital gain situation wIth M going off at $15.78. Thank you Joshua."
"Remember all those analysts begging you to sell below $10 last year? Almost everyone of them as I recall. Moral to the story, be patient and average down with good companies. Always pays off in the long run."
"everyone will work for Amazon, no workers available for other retailers"
MASSIVE SHORT SQUEEZE COMING
"backed the truck up, at this multiple and dividend, with rising comps & an asset rich balance sheet, rational thinking will come."
"Postings from short sellers are not well grounded. Pure FUD. The FED is about to lower interest rates again to stimulate the economy further. Their is no recession coming near term. The retailers are doing well owing to the full employment economy and U.S. discretionary spending remains strong. This is just what M needs to get its new sales initiatives working on the right basis. They will cut some jobs and reduce costs. They will pay down debt and reduce interest charges. They will buy back stock and lower cost of the dividend. They have new software and better technology to manage inventory at a store level. They are revising their discount programs to make them smarter and better targeted. They are making their stores more attractive to customers which already is a proven way to up their same store sales, and now it will extend to over 50% of their revenue. They are bring in third party vendors to improve margins in their internet sales and increase the catelogue attractiveness to internet buyers, a very good plan that Amazon uses. They are trying more backstage offerings of other brands, and the UPthread idea could also gain more traffic. With costs coming down, internet improving and instore opportunities better controlled with productivity software, they are going to have improving results and the PPS will respond handsomely if even some of this works. The dividend still is near 10% which is another reason to consider holding this stock as they are rewarding shareholders that trying to strengthen the stock value. It is a good plan and it is going to deliver a much better result, IMO. This is a strong department store chain with good properties and good locations in malls. Great buying opportunity with the stock having been dumped and further clobbered by short sellers who have driven PPS down disproportionately to the situation, all due to a single quarter miss. The opportunity here will not last if they get their plan working. The down side risk seems to be limited to me, while the upside seems to be large potentially. Please do your own due diligence and don't rely on a message board for anything more than a few ideas that you need to check out for yourself. Especially don't listen to the short sellers that try to create fear and negative sentiment. Good luck to the longs."
Dividends will be restored soon. Keep posted.Likely the beginning of next year.
"Sell rating with a price target of double current price?? L Brands, Macy's, Dillard's rating change at Deutsche Bank L Brands downgraded to Hold from Buy at Deutsche Bank. Deutsche Bank analyst Paul Trussell downgraded L Brands to Hold from Buy with a price target of $20, down from $31. The analyst's monthly promo watch indicates promotions remain at elevated levels. He believes most investors are cautious on Retailers heading into the Holiday, despite a generally healthy U.S. consumer, given a shorter window between Thanksgiving and Christmas as well as concerns around the promotional environment leading to bloated inventories. The analyst also lowered his price target for Sell-rated Macy's (M) to $32 from $36 and for Hold-rated Dillard's (DDS) to $22 from $23"
"R is being paid by hedge funds who are short Macy's to try to get you to sell! Don't believe his lies Macy's is a great business and the shorts got too cocky! WE HAVE THEM BY THE BALLS, BUY EVERY DIP!"
"It's like the $20 support is strong (I expected we meet it again to buy) and it's a very bullish sign, the trend is far from over !"
Typical market fluctuation.
R is def the new Nomansky lol. I missed having an enemy!
I get a kick out of R thinking he has minions on this board who will follow his stock advice. I wish him the best as he moves on. He'll probably be back when M hits $20 again if any shares are available to short.
Shorts going to get SQUEEEZED BIG TIME !!!! MACY's real estate is worht $25 plus in stock priceNOW blow out earnings and raised guidance.....TO THE MOON!!!!!
Was concerned inventory loss would cost them dearly but according to call today that will not be the case. The overwhelming majority of their inventory is not seasonal. They haven't used their 1.5 billion credit facility yet which is stunning.
Just bought some Dec27 $13 Puts for a nickel each. Definitely worth a shot to make a few hundred bucks.
"I don't know much about Macy's stock, I shop there and they're always busy in Columbia Missouri. I would think this is a great buy. I also shop at Kohl's in the same town and their stock is more than twice the price of this one. I gonna buy a little bit."
Dont be surprised when they restore the dividend post covid like KSS announced today

I closed my put options why did i lose when it was down so much
"best opportunity to buy, I mean there is no more guessing left."
Buying opportunity. Vaccine supply should pick up in April and Macy's should cross 21 again....25 by May long weekend.

"Only a half of a trading left Friday before weekly options expiration clears the high call open interest at 11 strike calls. Once this clears no overhead options resistance until Jan 15, 21 at the 15 strike calls. 16 target by that date"
"One day people will figure out that Macy's mall stores will be only be n A+ malls and More importantly they will all figure out that unlike actual mall based retailers you don't actually have to ""go in"" the mall to go to Macy's they all have several outside entrances where you can go in, pickup and shop without actually going into the mall."
"Great to see the damage is limited today, but this stock is living off its fading legacy. I don’t know if they will be able to reinvent themselves in time to turn it around. Also, being locked into their existing real estate portfolio can be a negative when they can’t optimize the space effectively."
"yep Macy trade is undertminable , up on days markets are down and down on days markets are upbetter gamble on biotechs IMHO"
M will back to $24/share in 3 mos.
Time for a.....SHORT SQUEEZE !!!!!! Heading to $13!!!!
7.5 billion dollars in liquidity and major investors is all I need to know.
"TERA, I suspect you are tr uly a short, but if there is really any legitimacy to your statement, there is absolutely no chance for bankruptcy here. The wealthy doing what the wealthy do, making money tanking stocks, making money pumping stocks.Two years ago I owned MU and AMAT heavy, the analysts and the Wall Street clowns started to say, oh no Mr. Bill huge inventory of this and that, yet the companies just kept making money, stocks just kept tanking, now, they are actually in a heavy inventory situation and the stocks are flying. The wealthy make money by shorting stocks that should be doing well and pumping stocks that should be tanking. End of story."
Why is it going down?
11 usd per share in 16 days
"$50, come on, the shorts can get us there."
Duetsche Bank up to bat...swing and a miss!
M now sends me very good e-commerce adds constantly by email. This is low cost advertising with deals based on my buying patterns. Never got these before.
Going to $8.00 tomorrow
And I think i mentioned that of the 293M float 132M of that is short...45%! Within the next week or so I believe we see an epic short squeeze. This stock is oversold and extremely undervalued imo. Easy money.
"looking at starting a position here, they have the cash flow to cover the 10 % dividend. I like to buy company at 52 lows and collect nice dividends till they turn around the company."
they can keep eps plus all quarter?
will bounce back to 20 maybe not yet but it will come shortly.the numbers are great and also the dividends are nice.
Ray Dalio recently bought 300k worth.News today:And Macy's bought a stake of Klharma as well as a 5 year partnershop for their online payment services.Next quarterly report will be another huge improvement.50% of the sakes are coming from online and they have billions in cashand assets.Any questions?
I believe today's action was profit taking given the bad report from Pier 1 Imports. Most retail stocks went down hard. Hopefully Macy´s will be one of the winners from the upcoming retail shake out that might happen after Christmas. I don't see how Sears can keep going for one more year and even JCP is in a bad position.
"Go Macy’s. Long term for the 3&4. Quarter as customers can finally leave their homes in droves to buy clothes also long Term on. Restaurants like Darden , brinker and cake shop"

"1.5 BILLION REVOLVER LARGELY UNUSED. LESS THAN 40 MILLION PER WEEK OF CASH BURN, IN FACT CLOSE TO NO CASH BURN SINCE CLOSURE. ONLINE SALES VERY STRONG. NO BANKRUPTCY HERE-NOT EVEN CLOSE."
Nike doubled their earnings in digital sales & is up $10 in aftermarket. Macy's is going to travel that same road. If Amazon is going to buy them they better hurry. Macy's is going online and their sales are going to explode versus walking shopping. And when those earnings are announced the acquisition price for Macy's is going to be a lot higher.
"Good Morning longs. To invest in Macy’s, you need to be patient. Macy’s is transitioning to smaller locations in strip malls or free standing buildings, and only keeping the best mall locations. Backstage stores are being opened in strip malls to compete with TJM. Digital is exploding. In 2-3 years when there revenues grow to just $27b or $28b from the pre-COVID of $25b, they will have a market cap of $30b, which equates to a stock price of $90/share. Be patient, the numbers don’t lie. TJX has market cap of $65b with sales of about $41b. You’re going to make your money. There is very little competition left for Macy’s. Amazon will never penetrate the middle to upscale clothing and accessories markets to a significant degree. Mark my words."
"Resistance is exceedingly strong at the $7 base. It can only go up from here on. Shorts better cover soon as it will shoot up on any good news (retail sales up, whole economy reopening, stimulus, fed support, etc). And we're still a long ways to go before the pre-covid price of $15 which makes it a very attractive target by institutional investors. $10 soon! Long live Macy's and the Great American Fireworks!"
$8.00 and up tomorrow
All signs pointing towards big gain tomorrow and into next week.
Nothing to see here folks. This is going to stay between $6.50 and $6.90 all day today to prevent Calls and Puts from cashing out.
This stock could hit 20 before end of the month!!! Big short squeeze will continue to push this up. Probably 15 tomorrow.
been buying more. I also have been buying Caleres (CAL) and Designer Brands (DBI) write this down. talk to me in 6 weeks.
"Macy's reward program-Losing over 30% this year. Even if it goes up 10% tomorrow, so many people are in the hole with this one..."
Stimulus checks being cashed directly at Macy's. Hard to make this up. Buy.
"“Upon the completion of the bond offering, as well as our entry into the credit facility, we expect to have more than sufficient liquidity to fund our operations and retire upcoming debt maturities in fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2021,” Macy’s stated.No bankruptcy here; not even close."
Hey Shorties. Just to say that I bought at -10% in pre-market. Thanks for creating such artificial bargain
Here comes $29 
Extremely undervalued stock should be trading at $14-$16 range
"Macy's raises $4.5 billion to shore up funds as stores reopen, shares surgehttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-macy-s/macys-raises-45-billion-to-shore-up-funds-as-stores-reopen-shares-surge-idUSKBN23F2SK"
Upcoming earnings will trigger multiple upgrades. Stimulus package will add multiple 10%+ daily gains. This will be the stock to watch all the way to 2021 1st Quarter ER.
"however, Macy's still #1 worth investment, all high ranking things sales very bad in this winter, but it's been over, because consumer confidence rise very high in February, so this year sure be very good year, so Macy's front views very good, Macy's price too low, it's reasonable price is $36 per share, strong buy can make a lot of money, Macy's still #1 high ranking retailers,"
Load it now !!!
"Macys is worth $75/SHARE.By all metrics PE, PS, Book Value, ROA, ROE, ROIC, debt/equity, and a safe secure high dividend and massive real estate holdings this company is ridiculously undervalued. One could sell their real estate and pay off all long term and short term debt and have enough left over to buy all buy back all outstanding debt and take Macys private and still have billions in cash left over. Now that's a cheap stock and an incredible bargain.The reason for this ridiculous under valuation is due to the retail stock sector being temporarily in a bear market caused by a perfect storm of factors that are all disappearing and the sun is starting to shine again with target doubling in price, walmart hitting highs, Rite Aid soaring from $7/share to $24/share after earnings refuting Goldman Sachs sell rating and ridiculous price target of $0.75/share as well as Bbby rising from $7/share to $18/share, then Nordstrom too nearly doubling after earnings refuting those who cry brick and mortar stores are dead. They do this to profit by shorting stocks hoping to capitalize on fear and ignorance. Fact is most annual sales or 80% in 2019 was at brick and mortar stores while online sales remains a minor part of total retail sales. Fact is brick and mortar stores will always be a majority of total sales annually. We are reaching a saturation point where online retailers will soon hit a wall with their share remaining at only 20% of total sales. Fact is most items are only bought at brick and mortar. That will never change. For instance one would never buy a formal dress attire online nor many other items for a host of reasons. Online sales will never replace brick and mortar. In our modern world and in the future retail sales will simply change and instead of going out of business retailers will simply adjust their business to cater to new trends. Macys first instance will not abandon brick and mortar but rather enhance them with online sales. For centuries retailers have closed poor performing stores and moved to better locations. Target and Walmart for instance closed hundreds of stores in 2019 and opened new ones at better locations. Macys likewise is well run and highly profitable with strong annual free cash flows. They are rapidly paying off all debt, while also upgrading their stores and rewarding investors with a safe secure dividend.Soon at this rate they will have no debt at all and as this sector bear market storm is disappearing we will see Macys stock shoot back up to a fair valuation of $75/share and maybe even more soon.Macys management is soon to reveal their exciting plans for growth for the next three years on Feb 5th.Shorts will lose this treacherous game soon and can lose unlimited sums.While longs will continue to be rewarded with a handsome dividend and awesome appreciation and capital gains."
"The fact that Macy's decided to not give an update on Christmas sales in early January, and also announced many more store closures doesn't make me think they're doing fantastically."
why is it down so much premarket?
"It's trading at a sub 6 P/E, stay clam and let it sort itself out, given rising comps and revenue this is as close to a no brainer as you can find. Welcome the chance to buy more. This stock is worth mid 40's if trading at half the multiple of its peer group. IT is being punished for Sears and JCP news."
There's a reason short interest went from almost 50% to 33% and now stands at 17% at last check. Sentiments are changing for M and even the savvy investors now this. Only retail rookie investors doesn't realize a surviving M has significant value.
"Macy's 8.375% $4.5-B Collateral-Bond turns out 2b 13.19% APR Compounded for 5-years while Mortgage Rates are Low as 2%? Macy's earned an average of $850,000 in 4-of last 5-years, but agreed to Pay nearly $7-Billion in 5-years during a Possible Next Recession, Practically Giving Stores/Assets Away."
49.8M volume. Shorts got a long way to go to cover. No squeeze here? Pfft
Fellow shareholders: Pray for colder weather. - Pete
"Too late to buy, it's fully priced"
"The squeeze hasn't even started in $M, yet. Yo, $GME longs, I like to propose $M as the candidate for the next historic short squeeze. $M has 310 million shares outstanding, 108 million shares short, and a daily volume of 30 million. Short position held from $8 and below, now $M is $19."
Don't sell... we are looking at $18.50 plus.... CLOSE
Going to hold a few hundred shares for the divined in retirement.
"Signet had very good pre-announcement numbers, indicative of the strength in mall retailers."
"Zombie algo trading today, look at all retail stores all same trading pattern today. Hang on to your M if you really want to see the pop. These computers will move on to the next best thing in the next days or weeks."
43% shorted ?... back to $30.00 ?.
When Amazon buys Macy’s it will get into retail
As of today's Morningstar updated report fair value estimate of Macy's is $16.30 when share price was $6.58. It's a 5star buy so hold on tight folks for a while
The algos have been programmed to account for too many macro variables that may or may not pan out. The greatest one is that Jeff Bezos will decide what we all wear lol. Buy Macy's for lush returns over the coming two years.
Still waiting for that ex dividend plummet.... Where are all the chicken littles.... Guess the sky isn't falling huh?
soon we will see upgrades. that will push it even higher...
"M is king of the 52 week low. Headed there again, omg. Look at it go. Private equity, buybacks, dividends, etc. Notice how no one ever calls them out on their poorly ran business, bad customer service, and lame inventory? All you see are fictional hopes....will bump big? Yet no reason is given why concerning fundamentals of business. That tells you all you need to know."
Looks like Macy’s is resilient and could make a run based on technical
Scared money don’t make money. You should of bought while 99% of stocks were on sale Thursday. Macy’s 10+ soon......
"Yes, Hal has made significant contributions ... to the short sellers!"
Macy's should go to $30 next week
"S&P 500 down 0.04%/ M down 2.5% (62.5X) Gobble-Gobble-Gobble, aye Turkeys? lol"
Just jumped back in @ 16.15 been selling and buying this a lot last month. Seems to stay in tight range of high 14's to 17. Earnings will beat as expectation are so low. Going to keep buying on dips. Good luck to all the RED STARS!
15.50 calls ?
Macy's says reopened stores performing better than expectedhttps://business.financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/macys-says-reopened-stores-performing-better-than-expected-2
"I seriously consider doubling my position on M, It’s just a sector rotation, retail is to go up ."
nice squeeze today lets get back to $14 again next week
Manipulation down to give big money more time to accumulate before analysts upgrade. Should have been up today on no increase in tariffs.
"I think Maxeen Waters should run Macys. She'd probably except millions less in pay and bonuses than Gennette and wig sales would go up! We could build Macys in some of her California neighborhoods where shoplifting is the norm. We could hire snoop to fly one of Macys corporate jets. Sell Fred Sanford, Richard Roundtree and Ron O'Neil T-shirts."
If someone say buy Macy’s it will go up 300% will you buy?
"When Cramer goes negative, I go positive. Buy M. Gift under $20."
"Low volume selling, just shorts trying to manipulate you people."
"Macy's on Wednesday reported quarterly earnings that topped analysts' expectations, saying strong digital sales boosted results, while the retailer continues to make investments to improve its stores"
"Ross Stores have a Market Cap of $40B, yet only 1/2 the sales of Macy's. Macy Market Cap is $3.5B . (Ross is more than 10X the Cap). Ross net income before the pandemic was about $1.5B per year. Macy's net income before the pandemic was about $1B per year. Macy has TONS of upside!"
hmmm what impact to Macy's when corporate tax rate goes from 40% to 22% . . . great sales numbers so far . . . 67m short as of last Monday
"Short sellers lost $1.4 B after TSLA issued a surprise strong earnings report. Shorts have this little problem that they have unlimited potential losses, LOL. Additionally, the M's shorts are paying Ms longs a 10% dividend and many of them pay monthly fee to gain access to shares to short. Those guys have a lot of guts and take some really dumb risks when they attack a company like Ms that has so many catalysts and ways to turn things around."
"Going from bad to worseFrom 2015 to 2020, Macy's revenue has gone from $28 billion down to $25 billion. Struggling to get visitors into its stores, it has gone on a campaign of shrinking its physical footprint to try to match its scale to actual demand. This was all before the coronavirus outbreak started. Now, with the incredible change in circumstances, it may need to accelerate its plans to become smaller. As of Feb. 1, the company had $685 million in cash and equivalents and a whopping $5.2 billion worth of inventory. The company also tapped its credit facility, borrowing $1.5 billion. The added cash will give it more flexibility to make changes in the near-term. Still, its ability to turn that inventory into cash in the coming weeks and months will be crucial for the company. Otherwise, it may have to take substantial discounting measures if products go out of season, further complicating its troubles. Admittedly, the inventory figure is the norm for Macy's at this time of year. What's different now is that sales are going to be much lower than usual. Even though stores are beginning to reopen, the demand for clothing will likely be lower for at least a few months longer. Many schools will continue with remote learning in the fall, reducing back-to-school shopping. Businesses with employees that are capable of working from home are encouraged to continue operating remotely, similarly reducing the demand for new apparel.Under pressure from the drastic changes stemming from widespread stay-at-home orders, Macy's is moving to adapt. The problem for investors is that moving in haste increases the probability of making a costly mistake. And Macy's massive footprint with 776 locations makes it particularly more exposed to downside risk, because it's more difficult to make changes at such a large scale. What's more, even if it does handle the current pandemic well, it's still going to be competing with a difficult market for brick-and-mortar retailers in the aftermath."
Miss the last year thanksgiving day parade....Go macy's!!
"M has a low PE ratio and Value investors prefer that. Because the PE ratio is not high, already the expectations are low, and lower expectations are easier to beat. Thus the company has potential and is undervalued at this time. Take Walmart, high PE ratio, and no company can keep its growth going up exponentially.... so, a lot more is expected, and if they don't meet the mark when things slow down, the stock will adjust accordingly."
"Exciting winds took over the parade, but at least it wasn’t snowing.and seemingly everyone had fun. Well, back to business starting early tomorrow for Macy’s to make more money for the holidays. Good luck."
"So Pfizer has competition on the vaccine now: Moderna says theirs is just over 94% effective vs Pfizer's 90% effectiveness, and is easier to ship than Pfizer's version.Needless to say all this means is that these vaccines are going to be produced at incredible rates, and this year is going to involve the world's largest sigh of relief ever.https://www.npr.org/2020/11/16/935475256/update-on-a-timeline-for-when-a-coronavirus-vaccine-might-be-available-to-americ"
"Wow -- MS makes a call against the retail sector. Brave. So why now? M stock is up big over the past 6-9 months, and the PE and yield are still very attractive... Is MS just hoping for a reversal?"
M has slashed its expense's these past few years and is very well positioned for the future. The 20 to 22 ceiling everyone is predicting is a bit short sided in my opinion. I believe it has allot more room to run.
Back to the 20s very soon!Then a run for the 30s.Who will own and profit from the next upward moves?
Multiple upgrades are coming. Many sell ratings are now turning into hold.
Looks like the end of the story :D
Took a long position in M today. Said if it should get to $24 or so I'm in. 6 PE now and 6% dividend. I like those odds!
Spotted the AXE on EDGX ... blocks of 16 - 20k shares buying on a low bid and selling and a higher ask making ~1500 per shot :P
Full fledged short covering now happening. Over $20 soon!
What's the new PE at this price from the new earnings ?
I should invest in puffs or kleenex because macys longs will be using they to wipe there tears
"Macy?s is a buy, just did a few hours of research what I found the upside to this stock. 1. Macy?s plans to reopen all 775 stores within 6-8 weeks after Monday?s 68 retail openings nationwide. 2. Macy?s current priorities is simply ensuring it?s got enough liquidity to navigate an uncertain future( closure of 125 stores within 3 years ) 3. Macy?s has been working with an investment bank Lazard, there is no news on what they are doing but possibly getting bonds up to as much as 5 billion dollars. Macy?s still has 1.5 billion dollars in credit on hand. 4. Macy?s is currently exploring several possible ways to raise money, possibility of bonds backed by some of its real estate and other #$%$ets such as inventory. 5. Macy?s is exploring numerous options to strengthen their capital structure. The downside of all of this?1. 125 stores will be closed in 3 years. 2. Normal sales will be down 20% when reopening.3. They will need to invest more in online advertising and their online services. They will need to spend more time widening their range of products and exclusive products at that. This will cost them the most money in the short term but will make them stronger in the future if this issue arises again. (Cost 750 million dollars.) Overall my analysis says this is a watchlist item for a possible buy in the next week. Buy rating of a 3/5 a hold rating of 4/5."
"Laura Gurski, head of Accenture’s consumer goods and services practice, said: “Many retailers and brands still struggle to deliver a seamless experience across the integrated marketplace.”The research also showed 47% of consumers said they would be willing to pay more for an experience that exceeds their expectations every time.Gurski said: “Meeting or exceeding expectations calls for a complete rethink, all the way from developing new concepts through manufacturing to the store shelf and beyond.“And with so many consumers willing to pay more for an experience that exceeds expectations, there’s a potential pot of gold for those that get it right.”It all comes back to Macy's executing their omni-channel vision with precision and efficiency, the management team just needs to do what they say they will and do it well, please no excuses this quarter."
Freedom is that you. He is now a new confirmed member of homeless association of america. You never learned.
Hitting resistance at $30. But the pressure is building on the shorts. Get ready for another short-squeeze.
Macy’s is the icon of America... there is no way to go out of business... 
Thanks for the discount yesterday!
"Macy's total assets for the quarter ending July 31, 2019 were $20.741B, a 11.1% increase year-over-year.Macy's total assets for 2019 were $19.194B, a 1.99% decline from 2018.Macy's total assets for 2018 were $19.583B, a 1.35% decline from 2017.Macy's total assets for 2017 were $19.851B, a 3.52% decline from 2016."
"Congrats longs! You're safe now. This was the test that Macy's had to pass. The fact that it didn't tank 10% is really good. In fact it popped 10%, but due to some profit taking, it dropped. Now it's holding. Remember, vaccine development and FDA approval will be accelerated. Number of COVID deaths is also trending down. More shopping will happen toward Christmas. Fear not, this will bounce. Macy's WILL survive and the stock will recover. There is clear need to a retailer like Macy's. I don't buy the story that many shoppers (especially women) simply order everything (from wedding/prom dresses to makeup to shoes, to jewelry) from Amazon. No way. They will go to Macy's or buy from Macy's website. If on the other hand, Macy's loss was wider than expected, and the stock tanked 10+%, I would not be optimistic at all. Now I am. GLTA."
"No reason to be below at least $25, or even $30. Midpoint of guidance is above the street's for God's sake."
"A lot of talk about short squeeze on this board. In general, with the VIX going down, and the stock price rising, why would folks short the stock? Wouldn't the smarter move be to buy puts if someone is bearish? I still learning options so appreciate your thoughts."
"Honestly shocks me how little people understand earnings reports, this was an incredible quarter for Macy's. Double beat (with ease) huge increase on digital sales and not far from profit despite a global pandemic destroying the foundations of their business.It is very clear now that Macy's have utilised covid to rebuild their foundations and give their business a revamp, this is a beast brewing which will roar back to pre covid heights (and further..) sooner rather than later. Sellers I truly don't understand you, but each to their own..."
one thing I can tell you. macy's (stock and) at the backstage you can buy very valuable stuff cheaper than everywhere else
$9.00 coming
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/macys-m-upgraded-strong-buy-170005670.html
M is a moat. Buy at these levels .Macy’s online is now a game changer
Over next 2 yrs M saves 1.5B in SG&A cuts at the same time increases gross margins 600M. Total 2.1B savings next 2 yrs. Current market cap of 1.9B. Finally 2021 comp sales will show 20% growth 2020 comps so low easy to beat. 2023 price target $19.35.
I’m at the mall now. It’s insanely crowded. And Macy’s parking lot is full.

"Well did my shopping at Macy's off of some my proceeds. Not crazy busy, but not dead either. Sales were good to clear inventory and welcome people back. Employees were happy. Good clothes, reasonable prices. Don't have to worry about them falling apart like JCP junk. I live in a samller city so not sure where I would go if they folded. So hopefully they live long and prosper."
"Where will it be Thursday morning, above $15.5? I'll be happy if it's above $15.50 Thursday morning."
"How Macy’s Could Be a Windfall Hidden in Plain Sight Fashion Is Evolving Beyond AppearancesThe fashion industry is reeling as its global supply chains have been disrupted by COVID-19, international tariffs have increased, and geo-political issues have mounted. At the same time, retail consumers have become more educated and concerned about the industry overall finding the heavy pollution resulting from the sourcing of materials, the international manufacture of clothes, the distribution of, what they consider ‘an overabundance of the same, expensive clothes’ to storefronts (both physical and online) that don’t integrate with their own shopping preferences to no longer be relevant to them. For today’s consumers aesthetics are no longer the sole factor driving purchases.Sustainability Is En VogueIncreasingly, consumers want to feel confident that the clothes they purchase are not contributing to global climate change and social inequities. Specifically, the entire process from manufacture, packaging, shipment, pricing, and even marketing of fashion is being scrutinized at higher levels for how well they treat all stakeholders, including employees, the local community, and the environment. Why buy from a company that is a part of the problem, when you can buy local and have a greater, more beneficial impact? Consumers are attracted to brands that are tacking action to address environmental, diversity, and other social initiatives. How well brands are able to commit to these values and incorporate them into all of their messaging will thus determine the future of retail, especially among the largest players.Fashion as a Lifestyle Choice Current ModelFuture ModelBrick & Mortar as a Distribution PointBrick & Mortar as a Media Platform"
It’s definitely safer and warmer to shop at Macy’s than others during the holidays. Keep that in mind.
and collecting a 7 percent div in the meantime
"Okay everyone, Macy's is going to post a $1B loss, full disclosure if you can't handle that get out now! Otherwise when they post earning and show the $1B there is no surprise, so don't act like it's a surprise. EVERYONE is affected by whats going on in today's world. It will business as usual later this year or next, so hold on for the ride, Macy's will be above $20 again some day very soon, GLTA"
Vaccine will crush the tech bubble and reflate retail stocks. $20 tgt by year end
Looks like no interest acquiring M here. May be at $17.50 (my guess)
$WISH just IPOed and will be M AMZN BABA....competitor!
Where?s that #$%$ Sozzi from Yahoo! finance? Now all quiet on the Macy?s front? Boy would you have lost money listening to him for the last year!
"Calling ALL Shorts, I would like you to bring this Down to under $6. I want to load the Bus. Thanks in Advance !!"
"Not only a long term investment, a good dividend stock too. The only retailer amazon wont impact. We all love to go to MACYS and experience shopping."
Macy's pattern of supposed fixes similar to JC Penney & Sears before they filed Bankruptcy. https://www.thestreet.com/investing/macys-executives-get-bonuses-as-retailer-cuts-jobs?puc=yahoo&cm_ven=YAHOO&yptr=yahoo
40$ after the earnings
"Nice... Most of longs are new,, they are holding strong...I think M will be 100 in 2 years."
Haha..shorts literally short on what they can say.
"In for 4000 shares at $5.11. It will get much better. But I can live with 10-15 cents increase, translating $400-$500 gain, considering the effort. It is not a big play by any means. 5 fold return is within reach."
"Macy's will be cheap even if it trades at 60+, so hard to reason the current stock valuation."
6.01 USD looks like a strong bottom.
any dip like yesterday ill be adding more shares. the shorts are on the run. Check the short interest its huge
Nomansky if you had an ounce of integrity you'd disclose much much money you've lost
I have been bag holding Macy’s for over 2 years I go it caught up on it by a recommendation from a CNBC analyst (Don’t listen to them anymore) I didn’t mind holding because I was getting a good dividend. I have been buying shares lately and now hold 2000 right now I am down about $4500. I am going to hold this year and see what happens it should get better not worse.
What do you get for your money when you buy a put and the stock rises?Nothing!
I'll take $15 as the new floor for M pricing. Chart is looking great here for longs.
it makes sense to me.. Disney is higher than Covid started.Macy should go higher than when Covid started.. I got it now...
Most of you watch the market way too closely. Numbers are good for this Giant that's been around forever and not going anywhere. Even during hard times for brick and mortar stores Macys stays profitable which is the most important number.... The bottom line.... Profits. $16 and change was a steal. Easy money. While adding 9% return on a dividend. It will see $30 a share again sometime in the future. Long term. Check the stock once a week. Stop paying such close attention to its daily ups and downs and it will see $30 to $40 a share once again. Happy New Years Longs!
Macy's has been struggling and on a downward trend for the last 3 years. Their operating expense of 24 billion leaves a very low margin for error for their 25 billion in revenue. We all love Macy's but the team managing it are driving it into bankruptcy.
"Macys has strong assets and will prosper over the next few years. The CEO is one of the best ever. He is professional who knows Macys business extremely well. Sharp, sharp executive@You will see Macys stock rise in a V shaped pattern over the next few years. They are going to restore the dividend too and so just sit back and watch your investment in Macys soar and double, and triple and Quadruple in value and then the icing on the cake will be the dividend restored.Has there been a better time to buy Macys? Certainly not!"
Can anyone please tell me did the price drop today include the dividend? Thanks
can we hold 20 tomorrow?
Anyone noticed how low the volume is after that earnings? Yea bc nobody is selling but these shorts trading with themselves. LOOOONG M! 
Big sell off into earnings? Why?
Yacktman Asset Management LP bought $21M shares on 03/31/2020. Wonder what they know....
Up up and away soon. 20s sooner than you will believe!
Hold the line. Dont sell my fellow nomads
I want to buy this stock but why this price so low? The dividend yield is great.
whata crazy trade. I sold in the 9.40s but I did buy it back lower. Its going higher next week
the price action in this lost its mojo - the gooshing at close on fridays have disappeared
"Weak hands got shaken out. Now ready for a hefty rebound. Outstanding news pending. Annual shareholders meeting this Friday, 15th May 2020. Go Macy‘s go! Reopenings are increasing week by week with all 775 stores/malls to be up and running again by mid June the latest."

"Alright, BBBY has proven that by firing your entire management team that gives you at least a 12% jump in stock price based on no other fundamental reasoning, with Gennette going that would probably give us at least a 25% spike in the bag. Sorry Jeff, its time for you to go."
"Glad i listened to nomansky's advice. Made $3,190 from 20 $9 Put Contracts in 2-days. Aye!"

"Analysts are almost always late to the party, either up or down. Kind of feels like a bottom has been put in with the preliminary results and now some downgrades that aren’t causing this to crash. The downgrades give clients time to cover shorts or buy low. It’s all a game. Know how to play."
There may be just a few less shorts now. Huge day!
"One of the biggest mistakes I made is doubting the short interest data of GME, when GME was at $3. I did the same mistake with FCEL and CVNA, and to some extent with FIVE and NIO. I will not be making the same mistake with M, I'll be in M for a $50, $70, and $100 share price."
"Warren Buffet is selling businesses that benefitted from covid and buying mall based retail stores.Warren Buffet just sold every single share of Costco - a covid stock that benefited from covid.The tide has turned!Year/Year sales and earnings will continue to be positive for stores like Macys and be negative for stores like Costco, Walmart, Target and Amazon."
"Does anyone realistically believe (even without a trade deal, although i do believe there will be one) that a 25% tariff on ALL china goods can be that long lasting? Trump couldn't even keep the government shut down long enough to get his way and a 25% tariffs on all China goods will have a far greater impact on the economy than a temporary federal government shut down. That being said i cannot see M board not buying shares down here before the end of the year. Most of the excess cash has already been allocated towards the massive 1B capex they want done by the end of Q3. Once Q4 begins M will have 150 Growth stores plus 200+ Backstage and more Bluemercury stores going full force into Q4 where they are projected to earn over 600M alone. Pretty sure if the stocks still stay in the low 20s we'll see a massive share repurchase before the end of the year."
"this stock doubled some people's money. Holding long term , Corona will eventually go away. Don't care if it goes to 6."
Upgrades coming
with 3-4$ dividends over the last 2.5 years my average price is ~10$. for me amazon takeover at 13-14$ is good.
M will hit $30 this year. Lay up from here imo.
Watched this for a while and finally bought in today $6.95
17 easy. 20 by end of week mark this post
Buy @12; going much higher...
Holding up vet well considering low volume in similar retail stocks today and overall down market day. This will rise when volume and market rise.
AMAZON... PLUG & PLAY COULD BUY MACY's !!!! Todays Earnings Call$21 PLUS !!!!
"General American Investors Co. Inc. raised its stake in shares of Macy’s by 20.0% in the second quarter. General American Investors Co.

Many many negative newsflow and Macy's still quoting in the same place? Think twice. Hahahahaha
Earnings and sales incredible beat! Earnings 613 percent higher than expected!!!!!! They hit it out of the ballpark! 250 million profit! Not a loss!! This year is going to be better every quarter year/year!!@Told you stock will more than double!!
I just sold my 125 shares. Good luck guys.
"Before I see anyone flipping out, Macy’s closing down the stores is a VERY good thing. All they are doing is clearing dead weight"
"23% short interest as of most recent reporting date -- 11/30! Did not decrease at all between 11/15 and 11/30.I figured some of the recent move was short covering. Turns out I was wrong. The short squeeze has not even BEGUN!(For comparative purposes, TSLA has a 25% short interest. Macy's almost at the level.)"
Just on CNBC Former CEO is LONG ON MACY's
Tender offer extended to $525M. Less than last years $750M.
Macy's and the stock market is due for a Green Day tomorrow! Best to buy in today.
can you say manipulation so Walmart beat like Macy but they took Macy down maybe they wanted to wipe out a lot of call options
It’s becoming more apparent that Morgan downgraded Macy’s to allow a lower priced short cover. There's something happening here What it is ain't exactly clear
70 million shares short is a HUGE springboard on any postive news
"About vaccin: ''The discovery and research phase is normally two-to-five years, according to the Wellcome Trust. In total, a vaccine can take more than 10 years to fully develop and costs up to $500 million, the UK charity says.'' Don't base your investment on a vaccin."
"Among the key things that Ms needs to do to improve its operating results is to get sales rising. One key problem is they have a lot of fixed costs which are rising with inflation, so they need to have growth in sales and good margins to make enough profits to handle these costs. A central issue is that sale growth over the last three years has not been sufficient to keep profits from eroding. They need to do a better job to get sales growth going again.Another way to cut the erosion of profits is to close weaker stores. And they will likely do that. This is a complicated task do to obligations Macy's has to keep stores open, and costs to close them.Another, part of the remedy can be to increase e-commerce and on line sales, which they have been doing in the past very well. Indeed this alone could turn the tide if they gain enough sales. There are special opportunities for Macys to capitalize on that Amazon does not have without stores. It is a convenient place for customers to return merchandise and M needs to make that a reasonably quick and easy thing to do. It brings the customer to the store where they can shop for a better size or different garment and look for other things they need. What starts as an on line sale can promote traffic in various ways.But clearly, as a department store, they need more and better traffic to the stores. IMO, M completely understands the issues associated with inadequate sales growth, and they are making an all out effort to build sales and store traffic by many different changes in their stores and operating practices. Part of the problem is to make the shopping experience better for customers. However there are many elements that must be handled and M has a team that is working on this from all directions.Competition is a big factor and M needs to compete better, which they are trying to do. They really have a lot of good stores that are in good malls but there are weaker ones too. All across the board they face competition, and working out how to be more effective in competing is central to their survival. They need to start picking up some market share, and that is not easy. However, they do have the advantage of size and experience and other stores are failing and going out of business so that is one place to gain some customers. Just do a good job and be one of the survivors; but that is not enough. They need to find things they can excel at. One of those is having the large inventory for the customer to access, see and feel. On line is convenient, but it is not the best way to buy clothes that look good, feel god and fit well. Big stores have inherent advantages if laid out right as COST and WMT and TGT have shown. Once M can get the store formula right, that can help them improve traffic and sales, IMO. They are working hard on that and I think they are likely to continue to improve e-commerce sales, and their 150 stores that have been remodeled giving early indications that sales growth is occurring there, which account for more than 50% of their sales at present. Cost reduction is another part of the solution, especially debt reduction that lowers interest costs, as that falls directly to profit, but cost reduction alone is not a complete solution and sales growth is a ""must do"" for Macys. Better inventory management is possible with more technology which M is trying to implement. This can reduce discounts which are not needed to move merchandise, which heretofore has been handled in a gross regional manner. Using better technology and mining their vast data better for a better understanding of what is happening on the store level can reduce costs and reduce unneeded discounts where merchandise is moving well It can also help then decide where to ship on line orders from more efficiently.Excessive discounts also eats into profit so they need a really good line of merchandise that is sellable without excess discounts and they need a really good understanding of their data to price everything for optimum profits. They implement pre-testing of merchandise and use other ways to get good merchandise at low costs. This is part of their power of being a large buyer. Another part of the job is presenting good merchandise well in the stores, and programs that enhance the appeal of merchandise and increase the average amount their good customers will buy with better inducement, using e-commerce, to advertise it at lower costs. Their SGA has been too high compared to similar stores, so this is another place where cost savings that get to the bottom line are possible. Another potential solution is to reduce the dividend. However, it appears that M views cutting the dividend as a last ditch approach because it holds up the stock value, and that is important too protect. The next few quarters should show they are making inroads on many of these issues, and the stock sentiment will improve, IMO. Once that happens, their PE multiples will jump."
"As long as Macy’s doesn’t do anything wrong, it will continue to trend higher. Same scenario as Bed Bath and Beyond. Everyone thought it was done and low and behold...They did nothing wrong and followed the market and its up a bunch"
"Nomansky, Jeff, And Eric. See ya July 1st, “House of Pain” #shortsqueeze"
"For anyone still owning this stock, just a honest question, all the malls are closing and many retailers have filed for bankruptcy, what make you think Macy won’t follow the same footsteps and why are you still holding on to the shares? This is not trying to bash or make fun of shares holders, just want to see what is the motivations"
"I too have used online Macy's and was very pleased with finding a plastic kids helicopter about 2ft long & 12"" tall with flashing lights and a working rescue bed with motorized lift. Bough two and one had a manufacturing defect. Returned free and replacement arrived in three days. Can't say enough about how well that whole process seems to be functioning. Let's hope for some modest upside Tuesday. Issuing debt at these cheap rates is not much different than you or I shopping for best rates when buying a car.....Macy's happens to be buying cheap cash for operations."

"I speak for all millions of us on this site by asking both Jeff and Nomansky to put a comment telling us what (if anything) they are doing to make money with Macy's stock and/or options.We'd like to know, probably not to try to do what you are doing, but just so we can get the point of your comments. Thank you very much."

We have 300% of covid cases spike in NYC just today. As I predicted serval months ago the third wave is coming no matter of vaccination. More than 17k cases in NYC today. Do you still believe that covid is over?In fact we just wasted one year waiting that the problem will disappear somehow. Sending out stimulus checks and paying unemployment instead of changing our economy.
Dividend is safe. What else?
Fireworks coming today. I see $10 soon. Long the great American fireworks!
Will set to rise 20%.
M crossed above 20 day MA and is approaching the 50 DMA at $6.57. If it reaches that level does it double top and fade or break above the 50 and move to the 200 DMA at $8.31. Vote with your dollars.

Amazon buying Macy's would create the world's best in class Digital and Bricks and Mortar shopping experience. I would think M would want $15/share on a sale

I only buy at Macys and Ralph Lauren. - Pete
Just got back from Macy's and I have to say i was surprised how busy they were for a weekday. I immediately notice how busy the lines were at the online store pick up counter. It was busy when i got there and busy when i left. Just wish the fitting rooms were opened soon which an associate told me soon.
"VFC posted good numbers, yes George, it is rational exuberance. Meanwhile the big money boys are still pumping the likes of Universal Display who while also posting positive numbers, still makes only a fraction of the money that an old ""stodgy"" retailer like Macy's make. No justification for P/Es in the hundreds for tech stocks that rely on the retail sector which has P/Es in the single digits to sell their wares."
Big institutions are rushing back in do not sell your shares for cheap. This is a 20+ share.
very green close.
"Well I got in at $33.45. Even if it's dead money for a while, I'm fine with the 4% dividend. I also have dead money in FB at a cost average of $165. That's not paying me any dividend."
Time to start buying hard. Will continue to beat for the year. Great dividend to wait out the storm. Iconic brand will get stronger not weaker in the years ahead.
I guess is a good day to buy an option
"After the Dec 12 Ex Divy date there will be 11 more trading days to the end of the year. With the selling price cut in half this year coupled with a record high overall market and the distinct possibility of a potential dividend cut, I see a perfect set up for some major tax loss selling with this stock before the end of the year. Thumbs Up if you agree with me and Thumbs Down if you don't. Also, if you don't agree, please explain your reason(s) why."
who's planning on buying the dip?

You should do the same.

"Nice close:-) uptrend should get initiated at our earliest convenience.......... Macy‘s going to double-digits again, sooner rather than later.........."
Is it buying point for mid term investment ?
Every uptick coming weeks is a chance to short more above $10.
"Macy‘s occupies more than 120 million square foot of retail space nationwide (often a mall anchor). Employs more than 130‘000 persons. Opening of 68 big stores on monday fits nicely, all others to follow over the next coming weeks. Back to business, back to normal.... Macy‘s will still be here when covid is long gone.... go M go!"
"I'm backing up the truck and loading up more shares. I'm willing to bet on M in the long run. In life, the higher the risk the higher the rewards. By next year, M would be in high 30. Good luck to all."
Somebody knows when the ex-dividend date is?
How do you explain nearly 4x average daily volume and essentially flat pps....
Go Macy.....
"I certainly think Macy’s recent cost cutting announcements of closing and combining call centers, reducing corporate headcount and shutting non productive stores puts a floor under Macy’s stock. I see this as a good entry point to buy M albeit the retail sector is not for the faint of heart. I’m not an investor, I’m a trader. Only when I embraced this concept and self discipline was I able to consistently profit from the stock market. If anything, I am a lurker, waiting for the right situation to unfold for me to capitalize. GLTA."

Macys will do very well today.
"Kohl's DOES NOT = Macy's. I have a feeling that will be abundantly clear tomorrow. In fact, apart from the fact that they are like a department store on the inside and they sell the same assortment, Kohl's is a unique creation that almost verges on it's entirely own segment of retail. In terms of it's store locations, it has very little in common with traditional department stores. It's almost a Target style discounter with no food. To compare Macy's and Kohl's is a bit like comparing Tulsi Gabbard to AOC, they are completely different even thought they are both democrats."
Stock is up 216% over the last 12 months. So much for going out of business. AY DOPEY?
"$19.60 Book Value but 1 year estimate $16.19. Okay. SO, basically analysts are saying that Macy's can stand outside Herald Square on the sidewalk and sell $20 bills from their cash register for only $16.50. Okay."
"And another thing most people are probably unaware of is Macy's real estate development plans. They own huge amounts of excess parking lot land. Macy's real estate partnership with Brookfield Asset Management is kicking into high gear. Macy's and Brookfield are starting to look for tenants for new retail space that they plan to build on excess parking lot land adjacent to dozens of Macy's stores. The partners are also planning more ambitious mixed-use developments at certain Macy's properties, starting with a store in Manhasset, New York. They envision building 355 apartments as well as a hotel, offices, and additional retail space at that location.The upside from these development projects is substantial."
lets go another 20% tomorrow :P

"maybe now they will scrap the terrible decisions to pay out 80% of their profit in dividends and use the consolidation benefits on expanding blue Mercury retail stores. They need to cut dividend to .20, 10% of net, then use 60% paying down their debt."

MASSIVE gains today WOWZA
"In 2019, 26% of its $24,5 billion in sales were online sales, as its stores were closed on March 18, the percentage of digital sales total sales will have surged and may continue tobe so as the stores are reopening."

M was in the same territory/position May to November of 2017; it shot up soon thereafter. If you want something to happen over night maybe you should find another stock to play with.
Why down ???????
"Has anyone paid attention to comparable store sales of the retail sector in Q2? I mean JWN -6.5%, JWN Rack -1.9%, KSS-2.9%, DDS -2%, GAP -7%, Old Navy -5%, Banana Republic -3% and finally Macy's +.3%! Nobody is giving Macys any credit for having positive store comps, but even TJX had their weakest Q2 comp in 10 years. So how was Macy's able to pull off a positive comp when even Nordstrom Rack and Old Navy was negative? Was it Backstate at work, or Growth150? No one can say with certainty but one thing is for sure M outperformed comps sales when you look at how other retailers did. EPS can be easy to manipulate, but Gross Sales is much harder to manipulate."
I sold my target for this was 20. Bought at 10.
Stores is better then airlines and hotels

Have an instinct that this will plough through 18 and go to 18.5 before it comes down eod.
Amazon should Buy Macy’s from Barron’s blog.
"Czech billionaire businessman and lawyer Daniel Kretinsky just bought a 5% stake in the company. Speaking of other acquisitions, he recently remarked, ""we simply believe that the current market is undervaluing certain very interesting and important companies."""
"after the virus M will have much less competition. no jcp, no neiman, ascena and more...they will have revenues of more than 30b"
"M has several good headwinds here. The retail sector is doing well with consumer discretionary spending rising and the Xmas season coming up. M has several good cost saving and product enhancement programs initiated that should bring about significant improvements in operating metrics and put M on a growth path, which is going to bring a better investor sentiment towards its PPS. The PPS is way oversold based on its enterprise value and its sales and market strengths as if it were almost going BK when nothing could be further from the truth right now. And, the giant dividend yield is a big bonus to those seeing this as a ""value"" play. Good chance to see a favorable bounce back above $20 IMO. The shorts have helped the PPS get oversold and if they cover they will help it bounce, LOL."
"Ouch, lower than before investor day. We know what earnings will be. We know what dividend will be. Big boys still dont want this. Buy in $14s, short in $18s."

"Macy's is in an amazing position, has anyone been to the malls? People are out shopping, Macy's is crowded and people are buying. I went with a friend to buy work shoes that he only used to be able to get at Sears. Sears being gone, we tried Macy's, no luck. JCP had em, there were not many other choices. My question is, Macy's has a chance to step in on closings of JCP, Sears, and whoever else, where is management on this are they asleep? They are still selling godiva chocolates and pearls when people want basics that you can get in Target and used to get in Sears. How hard is this??!! Update the stores and get the online right by adding more to the offer on line, just like Amazon, Target and Walmart. Macy's has an historic brand, top quality locations, upper middleclass value, and logistics and procurement expertise. Lets go already or you will face the fate of Sears, ToysRUs, Kmart and the like."
SUPPORT Macy's --- now more than ever!
m needs to be at 20.50 this wk. at the minimum. good luck every 1.
Huge short squeeze coming with c19 vaccine imminent. Macy's will see $15 -$17 before Thanksgiving.
This nomasky guy is in every board and negative vibe . He should be muted .
"Friday technicals showed buy signal 1. Cross above 50 rsi 2. Stock crossed above 20 dma, 3 Macd crossed positive. A green day on monday closing above Friday close is confirmation buy."
Now watch as Macy's starts dropping again for the rest of the week. False Hope!

"Up 12% on heavy volume (2x average) and it's only half day! This ain't Robinhooders. Big boys are moving in. Let's take it to above 8 today, and close above 9 tomorrow!!"
"WHO knows where it will go next. But I am surprised at the level of short at this range. The call buying on 6/30 was hedging by the short position holders. Macys is bound to go up extremely high not because of its eventual return to normal, but the enormous short position who will find it hard to remain short after they have covered all their position. This is not a 5 dollar stock, the valuation suggests that. (the institutional investors who shorted this (Bofa, Morgan) ..they all used their analysts (!) to give 6-9 dollar target so they can continue to cover the enormous short position in next few months. and after tha they go long and pump it up. (If there is a strategic buyer, this stock will almost certainly skyrocket! Amazon or walmart buying this as a brand is a no-brainer...the company owns real estate that is valued 2x-4x company value and 12x when normalized."
"Seen this many times before, low volume manipulation to by mm to create max pain for options traders. Lots of bets on M's earnings leaded to options trading, well the big boys don't want to give there money or stock away. Low volume makes it easy for them to win. Good news in my opinion is that soon M will skyrocket to the the recent high of 23 at some point soon."
"Okay Macy's Board if you're listening, at $20 a share as a share holder and long term value investor i think we should consider using some of that 750M cash on hand now and buy back some shares! 500M could knock out over 8% of all outstanding shares. This would dramatically impact EPS and Dividend payout in the future increasing share holder value. Capex will just have be be toned down a bit this year bc the trade off is well worth it. Pretty sure when the board decided on the 1B capex for 2019 the stock was trading around 32. Extenuating circumstances cause for extenuating action!!!"
"Two more mall retailers, AEO and ANF have reaffirmed their guidance, looks like the Credit Suisse call for a horrible holiday shopping season is proving to be yet another false narrative being floated by analysts who have their high wealth clients' interest at heart rather than telling the truth and providing valid guidance."
"Everybody on this board talking about short term stock price movements confuses me. The question isn't what a number says in a couple months, the question is will Macy's continue to make a profit into the future and if not does it have enough assets to cover its shareholders. We are seeing significant bounces in stocks like GameStop, JCPenney, and BedBathBeyond. These companies have far worse prospects than Macy's in terms of profitability, real assets, and business model. Their p/b is lower and people think that their real assets are valuable enough to warrant. Macy's is also below p/b at current values with room to run, but I guess the market hasn't caught on yet.I just want to ask, would you feel more comfortable owning stock in Macy's or in any of the three stocks I listed because year to date the market is treating them fairly similarly when I don't find them to be very similar at all."
Czech billionaire investor Kretinsky is no cretin when it comes to investing. He just bought a 5% stake in Macy's. He is betting on Macy's rebounding.
Any bets on tomorrows low ? Should I cover my short position at 6.00 ?
"I think many people don't realize that Macy has about 100 fewer stores than a couple years back yet the total sales revenue is doing quite okay given so many store closures. Another thing that doesn't really get talked about is that Macy is spending 1B+ (cap ex) this year and last year to build and grow their blue mercury stores, backstage and growth 50 & growth 100 stores this year. Each upgraded growth 50 store is seeing better comps than the others and cost about 3 million to remodel each one. Last year they did 50, but opened 100 Back Stages. This year they will upgrade 100 stores and open about 45 backstages. Why so fewer Back Stage? That's just the trade off since back stage will have over 200 outlets already they decided to focus back on the main stores with growth 100 investments. The budget is only 1B so they can only do so much a year, plus it took a lot of hard work from management to open and oversee 100 Back Stage last year. Therefore by 2020 Macy will have 150 growth updated stores and over 200 Macy's Backstage. Earnings and Comps appears to be stabilizing and debt has been reduced from 6.5B from 2017 to 4.75B currently. If it wasn't for all the new Cap Ex investments Macys earnings will be much higher. Eventually after all the stores are opened and revenues see more growth Macy's could slow the Cap Ex investments and we can see higher EPS and even share buybacks since the debt ratio is currently at 2.9 EBIDTA without assets sales. They wanna see it between 2.5-2.8 before considering buybacks. Technically all they have to do is repurchase another 165M of debt and the ratio will drop to 2.8 all things being equal. But anyways i thought it's interesting that on April 3rd 2017 Macy was trading for 30 with 6.5B in debt and today Macy is trading for 25 with 4.75B in debt and 1.2B with cash. That 1.2B cash is earmarked for capex through this year but assuming revenue and sales meet guidance (which isn't very strong) Macy should have about 750M to deploy towards debt repurchases and or buybacks in 2019. I feel buybacks at 25 isn't a bad idea around $25 a share since it will eliminate the 6% dividend and lower share counts and Both would have an impact on EPS. At just 4.75B total debt currently Macy can afford to use cash for both debt reduction and buybacks unlike before when they used it all towards debt reduction b/c it was near 7B.. Good luck!"
Never seen Macy’s so crowded
Bought another 500 shares. Keep buying 500 shares every time it drops 5%.
I bought $15 Macy’s calls when the stock was $14.80 this morning and I’ve already more than doubled my money!
The news has probably leaked. Strong Buy!
Excellent short squeeze in history!Best prospects you could hope for.
I haven’t had this much conviction about a stock since AAPL was in the 140’s / 150’s. That turned out okay. Been through this before with M. If some type of trade deal gets done and tariffs don’t go up this will rocket. Trump has incentive to not let economy / stock market tank. So load up at these levels and have some patience while you collect a nice dividend yield.
"UBS has been wrong is just about all stocks they rated. TSLA, AAPL included. Can you honestly take their word for anything?"
"Macys had momentum prior to this covid nonsense! It would have been in the low 30s or high 20s if this had not occurred. They were profitable every quarter, consistently! And their sales were far better than expected last 4th quarterand I might add that quarter was the shortest holiday season possible with the fewest days between Thanksgiving and Christmas.Impressive Performance!Now that the dividend is temporarily suspended they will save $450 million annually! Expect better and better things ahead!Great CEO and management team! Great company! Shorts are going to into the pain train for the foreseeable future!"

"With record-low tourism, and many New Yorkers working from out-of-town locations, the retailers' pool of potential shoppers is much smaller now, even in the generally slower summer months."
it will reach the previous price $17 soon.
Already up on the shares I purchased today under $36. What a gift!!!!!!!!!
We might see $19 today. Definitely will see it by tomorrow!!!
company should reduce gennete salary
We're back baby!!!
macys bear of the day??? what's new?? should be 20$ with online sells and valuable real estate.
Up means M's economy is the Trump economy. Buy.
"Attention Macy's investors... pay attention to the other so called struggling retailers before judging M. Specifically JWN, KSS, GPS, LB, JCP, DDS, BBBY etc. I think investors will appreciate M more once every has reported."
somebody is buying shares.They can buy half the shares back if they want
"My avg is down to 16.50: where we were at FRIDAY, just 4 trading days ago. Any change we get back there again.....ever?"
"Nomansky when earnings come out, you can always switch over to scratch off tickets and try your luck there."
I love the dividend and the fact they have cash flow to pay it.
"Hello Macy longs. Another great day!!! The early action was due to big buying by institutional investors. Nice to settle above $14. Like I said this is like money in bank. It will continue to rise as they continue to execute against their digital and off mall locations strategies. I love it!!! If TJX has market cap of $80 billion, Macy’s is worth a lot more than $4 billion. The shorts are brain dead to have been so heavy when it was $5-6 per share. Risk-reward not in their favor then or now...ha ha, they will burn and end up in BK court."
Macy will do fine. They also sell on-line. But M has a one up on Amazon. You can go there to try it on.
$MACY REDDIT has ARRIVED
*This will CLOSE ABOVE $18 TODAY*
Macys is dirt cheap going into earnings release. Awesome!
"If Macy's avoid BK, and traffic goes back to normal. I think there is fundamental upside to get at least 200% higher, and then momentum upside maybe half of previous highs."
Happy day with Macy..received dividend..will be keep it for a long term..hope actually value 34$ back early..
"The board of directors of Macy's, Inc. (NYSE:M) today declared a regular quarterly dividend of 37.75 cents per share on Macy's, Inc.’s common stock, payable July 1, 2019, to shareholders of record at the close of business on June 14, 2019."
"Such a nice start to the day, down 1% already, smh. Guess shareholders want the fur to stay..."
"“Upon the completion of the bond offering, as well as our entry into the credit facility, we expect to have more than sufficient liquidity to fund our operations and retire upcoming debt maturities in fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2021,” Macy’s stated."
Amazon will buy
"Hurry Sell, Sell, Sell looks like the shorts want to cover before M goes ex dividend on Dec 12 2019 LOL,LOL I would not give them one share at this price and make them pay up for my shares LOL,LOL They take that 10% dividend right out of the shorts account on Dec 12 2019 . Get ready to have to pay again shorty. LOL,LOL,LOL"
Buy now before it will reach above 20.
$17 CLOSE !!!!Lift-OFF
Road to $20 starts here
That investor values Macy's real estate at $21 billion in 2015! If Macy's sold it to Amazon for 20 billion that would put the Share Holder at $65 ! Wow!
"Report will likely beat expectations tomorrow, and cause shorts to anti up another dividend payment. What could be better?"
Say goodbye to the Macy's parade............and hello to the Amazon delivery trucks
Look at the history of Macy’s on June 1. All UP UP UP
Fire Gennette. Scrap divi temporarily and initiate a massive share buyback with the money. Either that or take the company private. I bought this for what I thought would be a quick trade last year and it's been nothing but a headache.
just checking in on Douglas and his wise M stock advice. (hysterically laughing)
"Horrible!!!! Missed on all key metric.... BOD you are being irresponsible if you do not change management !!! Mr Ginnette may be a nice guy but under his leadership the results are unquestionably the worst in the industry ... Just chart metrics of Macy’s vs other retailers ( comp sales, gross margin, cap ex , comp earnings before asset sales, market cap decrease, stock price .... disaster!!!! The CEO has been at Macy’s for 30 years ..... Change management or change the cushy BOD members who are clearly not protecting the interest of stockholders but collecting $200k per year in supporting these ongoing feeble strategies and disappointing Quater after Gunter results ( board remuneration is appx $2 mill per year )ENOUGH, ENOUGH, ENOUGH"
Macy’s market share is increasing.
Lets say a sustainable revenue half of 2019 and improved net margins due to closing under performing stores goes to to a 7% that's about 875 millions profit. Then a p/e of 12.5 for an average company gets it to around a 10 billion company in a 5 year time. That's about 15% annual return if you buy it at 16$. At 12.5 is about 20% annually! I think the market can get this to 18 this year to fairly price it for 13-14% returns in the next 5 years.
"Anyone actually done the math. If margins come inline with previous quarters and sss only down .2 percent, we can see Q4 earning of $2.50+. Putting full year earnings way above $3. Stock would gap up 25%. Way to risky to short."
"Did you guys know that Macy's online growth is partly do to becoming a quasi marketplace? Check this out, brands can now become ""Drop Shippers"" for Macy's and add their brands to the Macy's website if approved. This is great news for companies like mine ""an exclusive importer for beauty brand from EU"" to get product and brand recognition into Macy's. Win for Macy's because of course, more sales more profit, no employees or labor needed!This system will only get bigger, will be a natural for plugins for Shopify to be produced for seamless integration for small brands like mine to add more sales and rely LESS on amazon for sales. Really makes me want to keep Macy's for much longer. I am moving forward to try to connect my brand, will let you all know how it works out."
"Do you guys see whats going on Markets Down huge, Shorted Stosk are up or little down.This is going to be a monster next week. Because GME is staying hard and in next week it is going to Zoom more making hedge funds sell all other positions to cover. So All stocks with heavy short ratios will see a huge squeeze next week like Macy.So next weekMarket Down hugeMacy will be up huge due to panic short covering.Take Positions in heavily shorted stocks and seel today the stable ones that are already run up and are bloated."
Where’s it ending up today. My price is 17.5. Wish it were more but not sure why this is tanking.
5/23/2018; 11:05:27; Bear Call Spread: Sld 10-M 25 MAY $34.00 Calls @0.28 Bot 10-M 25 MAY $35.50 Calls @ 0.03 +$250 credit (ref $33.52).
This should double the pps of Macy's. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/macy-apos-plan-fend-off-124800220.html
"People who say Macy's is bankrupt.. they still have cash on the balance, and they didn't call for chapter 11.. even though many other did go bankrupt, i'm sure not every mall will go bankrupt."
A new 52 week low today.
Thanks to Gary for all the positive comments and information. it makes me feel that there is hope that the stock would bounce back. I've been very stress since I bought nearly 5k shares at $13.
Today's decline (so far) erases about 40% of the yearly dividend.
"if m pays the full dividend or even half, how will the stock react following the announcement?"
"Div announced. Buy 10000 shares, get $15,100.00 dividend per year!"
"first day cold in New York in 11-11-2017, all clothes retailers very busy, SO I think Macy's stock sure be back to New high in this winter if weather colder than last year."
"I haven't been to a mall in over 3 months. Neither has my wife. My daughter she is 19, she buys everything online (not from Amazon) but from barely known websites that have great prices. My son who is 22 does the same thing. I think M is dying and Amazon (the commerce/retail side of the company not the cloud side) has peaked and might start rolling down a bit."
"On or before Feb. 24 Macy's will declare a dividend.It is not entirely outside the realm of possibility, that a modest increase of $0.05-0.10 may occur. Consider that Macy's earnings estimate is $3.63 at a 39-40% tax, the saving alone from a 21% tax rate would make room for a modest increase without a meaningful change in the pay-out ratio.That would surprise the shorts as it already yields 6.22% at $24.25.Stranger things have happened."
"amazon delivery system failing, pier 1 imports and many small retailers gone only the big names macys nordstrom will survive and will be busier than ever"
"macys owns 417 buildings around the united states. There trophy building is herald square > 2,5 million square feet of retail space. They just recently closed there offices in Ohio and plan on building there mailn headquarters on top of herald square on 34 th street in NYC . The building is worth 2.5. to 3 billion dollars (its probably worth more to Amazon). You can consult a real estate professional in NY to confirm) They also have a land lease on the Bloomingdales building on 59th st that u can confirm with a broker in ny (again its probably worth more to amazon) I'm not going to get into all the other prime real estate they own in san fran long island etc( not including all their sweet heart leases they own, they own some bad ones as well but many more good ones) They have a credit card business that is a huge money maker. They have 5 billion in inventory in all there stores. The have the names macys Bloomingdales and another 20 brands that could be worth 1 Billion together . They can also decide to reduce there retail footprint and decide to monetize all the real estate they own ( which they started). If they decide to closed up shop and become a REIT and sell all the different parts of the company (the credit card company the brands) and monetize the real state the stock would explode The market cap is 1.5 billion with 6.5 billion in debt . , They also get any shortfall on money from all their real estate. The real estate is worth 15 billion alone(again much more to an amazon or Walmart)."
This goes reverse to the market direction. Brutal today.
"I must buy good clothes in a store like Macys. I bought 4 pairs of shoes on line and had to send 2 pair back.When I buy a Lauren or Jones suits I want to try it on.I'm not repackaging anything, etc.. It's a pain. - Pete"
"nice way to wrap up a solid and money making week. congrats all. shorties better regroup and try next week, but with thousands In stimulus hitting accounts m is only sitting on green pastures"
"Macy's Executives Get $9 Million in Bonuses Amid Job CutsMacy's board approved bonuses for senior managers, including $3.7 million to CEO Jeff Gennette, while the retailer cuts thousands of jobs."
"Repeat of last year, they drove prices of entire retail sector down hard around the Easter timeframe and then starting to drive them hard up through the quarterly earnings report until they peaked in July and August time frame. Looks like we are setting up for a rerun of last year."
"What ever is being said at the investment meeting, must be okay otherwise the stock would be falling..."
"The past is the past and the future is NOW. Starting in August all Macys are open and operating as normal with an expectation of the first full quarter of normal operation after the covid storm has passed.Expect good things in the future for this excellent, well run retailer."
I just sold @ 38.30
Buy Buy Buy
"Guys I was in Atlanta, trying to find a parking spot at different Macy's. Checked all of the malls!! Guess what? No parking spot! Then I drove to Jacksonville, then Orlando and now I am in Tampa.. just driving for days trying to find a parking spot at Macy's. Haven't found a single parking spot!"
Macy's announced before the Chinese Virus hit that they were closing 28 of their stores and one Bloomingdales. That will increase now. They will have a ton of inventory from their Spring and Summer lines that are setting in warehouses. How will they move it when the Fall line will be coming out when they start to re-open. Their on-line presence is not that strong.
Just their real estate in New York City alone is worth 1/5 of their current market cap.
Macy's and Best Buy ~~~~~~~~both wonderful trading stocks both channel......enjoy the ride with lots of patience....
Last week basher Nomansky said Macy’s won’t close over $16
Comments to article in attached web link ... in our current high tech internet economy it’s good to see Macy’s is finally getting competitive and taking critical steps by closing more stores and reducing the work force ... most sales are moving online and robots can handle the packaging / delivery process - which will ultimately produce higher profits along with higher share price!!!https://finance.yahoo.com/news/macys-close-125-stores-cut-155434677.html
Once Sleepy Joe is KO this stock will up yo
"Dow Future is up by $110.00, that means that Macy will drop today between 0.25 and 0.50"
Good price.Buy and wait till Christmas.
The pump is complete.. time to dump
"Here's why I think Macy's will be a winning buy before the end of the year. These bankruptcies in the industry means Macy's will find it easier to make sales without rival stores competing for the same dollars (clothing,shoes,cosmetics,etc). The combination of Pent-up demand (need some new clothes) and cabin fever will strike about August (preschool season) one month before the beginning of the holiday shopping season."
"Buy Macys department store stock for the dividend. Hold it to see if they survive their 2020 year of negative $12.68 earnings per share. Sell it when they produce PR's like the First Human Capital Report. Short it when its over $10 per share, but there is always digital and e-commerce. M could catch Amazon, Wal-Mart, ebay, and countless others ahead of M."
Covid is a passing thunderstorm with the sun soon to shine. Covid vaccine are in the final stage 3 and soon will receive FDA approval. To speed the process the USA gov has paid to have them mass produced before FDA approval so they will be ready by October to give to millions of USA citizens - free of charge.Covid will soon be gone and a passing memory. Macys will be again the consistently profitable company it was prior to covid and will pay off all its debt.Prior to covid Macys was fast paying off all its debt and if covid had not occurred it would have been debt free in a few years. And they were paying a handsome dividend too while paying down the debt fast.Very impressive management.Things will just be delayed a bit.
Did they have a decent Christmas?
Macys stock holders enjoy the ride back to the 20s and the robust move to 30s
if NYC comes back and doesn't fall into a depression this is one of the most undervalued names out there.
Double beat and reiterated guidance! Give us the dividend and we see over 17.50 today
"6.12, a buy opportunity."
Still don’t know why people expect a div cut when they have cash and their payout ratio is healthy. It’s just a supremely shorted stock. To me it signals management expects or has initiatives they expect to succeed to get the share price up to a level with a more normalized yield.
"LOL,LOL,LOL Macy's the company run by DEM wits and screw ups LOL,LOL,LOL only a DEM wit would think losing $688 million dollars is good LOL,LOL,LOL look at all the DEM wits that had a CON job pulled on them by Wall Street and Macy's fake earnings they reported LOL,LOL you don't even need to make stuff up when it's all so true"
Amazing - the Dow is up 500 points and this is flat. Guess we are going to have 8 straight days of not being positive a single day. I am holding this at this point. I think it will rise over the next 3-4 months. The Macys close to me has been absolutely packed over the last few weeks. I've got to believe this is at least heading in the right direction.
"Truly a volatile stock. They did pay down a lot of debt this year, and remodeled a lot of stores. Much better shape coming into 2019 than 2018. Buy."
Message from the management: ''Sorry we are unable to reply you at this moment as we are dealing with the Covid 19 situation. Please check out website for more information.''
"As expected, online busting it out and now better margins. Going higher."
20s soon folks!!
Guggenheim analyst Robert Drbul maintained a Buy rating on Macy’s Inc (NYSE: M) today and set a price target of $44.
Bought 2000 shares today. I can take a chance and sit on them for 5 years.
where is Robert and his Amazon buyout posts?
"Numbers better than expected. 190 stores already opened, 80 more coming weekend. Traffic in opened stores higher than anticipated. Financing on track. Macy‘s ready to exit crisis as a strong company. Go Macy‘s go! Shorts better cover early..... or get burnt badly......... just a friendly advice............"
"Based on what's been written about these stock bonuses, looks like a very bad move by mgmt. Dont know if bonuses were based on meeting prior year mgmt goals, but not a good look when laying off the masses. Mgmt should understand the pushback n rescind the stock awards or set different parameters around them in order to earn moving forward"
Should I hold?
repeating 25 soon even with some analyst's having a sell rating with a 8 dollar target .The numbers coming out next week will prove how ridiculous those predictions are.
"Macy’s raises $4.5 billion, says it has ‘sufficient liquidity’ to weather pandemichttps://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/08/macys-raises-4point5-billion-shares-jump-on-additional-liquidity.html"
"Wow, last week all the Macy's were stuffed to the gills with customers, yesterday the die hard longs were talking about great retail numbers today with a big short squeeze and today we're hearing things like ""but but but gee, Thanksgiving was later than usual"" and ""the sales report is pretty much usueless to determine 4q sales"". LOL And all this from the same diehard longs who were projecting a great retail report today. Funny how things can change so fast huh?"
Macys stock holders enjoy the long term upward trend!Dividends will be restored post covid..Macys management is more conservative compared to KSS.
On the rise. Will test new resistance
"Woke up to up another 1.5%, doing better than AMZN or APPLE today. M will make you some money this year if you let it ;)..That guy that was shorting to 20, you are getting burned good now, ha."
Wow! Shorts are being shorted today! Shorts just lost half a billion dollars on this stock just the few hours the market opened at. Must be a record! More records to come!Hello short shorts! Time for us longs to bath in the sun!
I'm looking at $31 a share by Friday! Any bets?
debt restructuring doesnt help revenue which is in sequential decline. XMAS will be the knockout blow
"Macy´s is holding its ground given the sell off. Next week this sell off will turn around as the economic background around the world is the best it has been in many years and economic news are very positive in the USA. This interest rate move is the excuse to take some profits, but the bull market is pretty much alive. M is going over 28 in the next 30 days."
market rally on monday
This is priming itself for a big open tomorrow.
overpaid CEO doesn't care
"Is there any outstanding reason for Macy's spike over the past 5 days? I own no shares, I am just confused as to how it skyrocketed despite Cramer saying M is ""irrelevant""."
Never short Macy’s when it is at 52 week low. Covid19 is temporary. Shorts Cover before the stores open In future. It’s not far.
if you don't think this stock is being manipulated you are nieve. it will close tomorrow at 18. write it down. MMs are criminals and want your options money. stop buying options and buy the stock. it is cheap.
Love watching live level 2 data when the price goes down sellers stock up resistance lines like nothing other buying is not now wait for the right entry.
Huge volume in pre-market (already a million shares traded). Macy‘s will squeeze the shorts!!!
Let's hope the bounce is real. Be a nice Christmas gift at $40+.
2018 will be even better for Macy's with all that bonus money abound. All aboard!
"Carlos, the Chinese are on the brink of a much bigger reaction from their own people. It is not an election, it very well may be a revolution. Hong Kong is only the beginning, we are hearing from our vendors that there is a lot more discontent among the average, working class Chinese that obviously will not get any play from the world media as it would imply that Trump may actually be successful and we can't have that."
All done regular market early morning stock.
lots of support in the 24 area and the reason i bought shares yesterday........i plan on being patient and holding for a very nice return!!
To the moon?
"Macy's will never do ANYTHING. The sooner you realize this and sell, the better off you will be. I sold my shares at 29 bucks a long time ago. Look where I'd been if I hadn't. Will you people wise up already."
"i'll be honest with you all though, the ""powers that be"" trie d to SINK this big time about a week ago when it hit 6.89 (i sold my position at 6.90), then bought big, and they ARE going to short the living HE ""DOUBLE "" LL out of this after earnings come out....."
I want to see 6.50 today lets go
Book Value Per Share $20.64. Fear drives this market now. Buying shares.
"Sears gave us Good Craftsman Tools (Return broken they Relpace Free-on-the-spot), Kenmore Appliances & Allstate Insurance. Macy's ""fleeces"" us w/ High-Prices & Cuts Sales-Reps Wages & Benefits.."
Join the Macy‘s-train now!!!! Tomorrow before markets open Q1-sales numbers as well as CEO in fireside-chat with JP Morgan........... Go Macy‘s go!!! Whatever it takes.......... Be on board when the short-squeeze starts............
"This is going up, numbers were better than expected. Time to buy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
so next week it could go to $16-$17 and then to $20 in no time.
m was sold this weak .kss was not.why today???
"Actually I did analysis on website traffic: in the clothes section Macy's website is number 5.Probably that's catching up even more current quarter and in store sales is probably higher than the low.Factor that in your thinking.. also: I have news from China that they will produce a vaccin probably in december 2020. - at this moment I am not long in Macy's - considering sub 6 USD, but I am already happy with my position at this moment... however I see 700% potential if Macy's survives and can return to profit."
Here we go
"“Loyal” customers of Macy’s come from a melting pot with different walks of life regardless of character, religion, race, and economic status. All of them generally want their items or products associated, designed and manufactured by an established and respected “brand”. The country of where the item was made is not so important but rather more on whether the item has the genuine brand name label. Also, the special discounts and coupons provided are only supplemental perks for them in deciding to purchase their brand name items. If they like the “branded” item, it is more likely that they will buy it regardless of the price. These loyal customers have earned their money and one way to reward themselves on their hard work and accomplishment is to shop at a place like Macy’s. Lastly, if you want to get yourself in the mood for shopping during this coming holidays, Macy’s will not disappoint and will showcase its best as a “branding” attraction."
"Just bought 1100 shares more at $16.70. Hoping to get out at $17.95 today but if not I'll have a bigger dividend payment in 45 days. I wish I could stop pushing buy and sell, short and cover buttons but I'm addicted. My original buy price is $19.88 last winter of 2019. Just about 10 months, which almost makes me a long term Capital gains investor. Hurray!"
Those of yawning at or poopooing the proposal to build an office tower on top of Macy's Herald Square might want to read this article and consider the huge economic impact and add to Macy's bottom line: https://www.nreionline.com/retail/what-can-building-tower-top-its-herald-square-store-do-macy-s?NL=NREI-21&Issue=NREI-21_20190523_NREI-21_985&sfvc4enews=42&cl=article_1&utm_rid=CPG09000005661741&utm_campaign=20784&utm_medium=email&elq2=ea0143669e96473fb290227e2a9728e3
"Macy's adjusted net loss was $630 million, compared to an adjusted net profit of $137 million in the year-ago period. The loss last quarter from operations was $969 million, versus an operating profit of $203 million in the 2019 period."
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/macy-inc-announces-november-december-123000257.htmlwill close today $20 and more?
Macy's is all set to have a huge jump. Should break 15 in December due to vaccine distribution alone
"If no one sells for 2 weeks, shorts will start a bidding war for your stocks. Their game is timed. Longs have advantage over them."
"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/macy-apos-stock-could-triple-000500455.html1. M is one of 13 most shorted stocks. When it starts rebounding it will go up sharply.2. The dividend is almost 10%.3. A good buy for a stock is when it is in down turn or in trouble. M is at the multi year low.4. M never lost money although Its earnings were decreasing. In other words, it worths more than before.5. It has been implementing new technologies into the stores.6. It has been cutting cost aggressively.7. It is a bellwether stock, its fundamental is sound."
Good thing is the stock is holding really well with high volume. Looks like a bargain. Stocking up more.
Obviously the earnings report will be negative. How do y'all think that will effect the stock price? or this already priced in?
"If you’re a day trader, you should definitely check out http://stocktip.xyz. They send a watchlist covering the top pre-market movers every day before the open. It’s a great way to pick out potential trades for the day."
squeeze m?
Dividend just announced
bought more today :)
BUY FOR THE SQUEEZE!!!
Appears Macy will survive a field of fewer players. Interesting in that it itself could be scooped by Amazon. The strong will be rewarded.
This stock about to boost up. good news coming
Single digits coming soon. Might sell half and buy back later. The support at 16 tricked me. Lowering next round of purchases to $12 and $9
"All signs pointing at .65 to .85 cent gain tomorrow, followed by at least $2 to be added early next week. Enjoy!"
"Macy's Inc lies the upper part of a very wide and falling trend in the short term, and this may normally pose a very good selling opportunity for the short-term trader as reaction back towards the lower part of the trend can be expected. A break up at the top trend line at $5.15 will firstly indicate a slower falling rate, but may be the first sign of a trend shift. Given the current short-term trend, the stock is expected to fall -61.82% during the next 3 months and, with 90% probability hold a price between $-0.27 and $1.97 at the end of this period."
"The word is through out the Market people with money are buying in now and holding on these great prices! You will not be able to touch Macy's under 12.00 in the next 30 to 60 days ! With online selling! with the shopaholics, Macy's is still going to make money! Macy's has been around for along time and in some of the very finest places in the cities with plenty of loyal customers ! If their not walking there they are online buying up! Good Luck To All!"
buying the dip. higher highs and higher lows this sell is temporary
"headwinds: tariffs, mall-based, too many stores, debt. tailwinds: lower interest rates reducing debt service costs, lower interest rates increase value of M's real estate holdings, strong dollar partly offsetting Chinese tariffs and making imports cheaper from other countries, double digit online sales growth. All in all, the operational headwinds are significant, but there are favorable tailwinds, too. Most of the headwinds can mitigated to a reasonable degree. Malls need Macys more than Macys needs malls. Higher tariffs are partly offset by Chinese makers wanting to retain Macys biz (pricing power) and stronger dollar. If mall traffic is weak, Macys can close stores or reduce lease costs since malls really really need to keep their anchor stores. Management needs to execute on things like inventory mgmt. But all in all, this is a very viable biz with plenty of upside in the stock. Even if the market hates Macys right now."
"Let's have a moment of silence, I think we lost Douglas and give-me-a-break. So sad to see their passing."
Share Price vs. Fair Value:52.4% Overvalued Current Price 18.38Fair ValueUS$11.19
"dont listen to Robert , he just makes up stuff about Amazon and Macys where there is zero truth in themthose rumors been around for ten years made up by analysts that want to be on CNN and FOX business news to get exposure to their money deal firms its all hoax"
Im New. Do we sell when Macy#$%$ 20 ? Or do we hold onto it. I?m getting confused as to the ones to sell fast and the ones that are long term. Please forgive my ignorance
"No worries, Valentine Candy sales will be up!! :)"
"Goldman Sachs just purchased 3.3 million shares of Macys increasing their position by 211 percent!Obviously they are expecting this stock to soar!The largest holder of Macys stock, BlackRock just increased their huge position by 58 percent!Macys is going to double and triple in price soon."
CARLOUSE SAVE THE MONEY FOR THE EX WIFES CLUB!! GET OUTTA THE MARKET.
"Volumes are back, let's have this welcome squeeze...Happy end of year for longs on this bullish stock.."
"I am actually bullish on Macy's but I do think at least in the winter there will be another dip when people get the common cold and maybe confuse it to corona, because it is in the same group, just one being worse than the other. The sales for Q3 2020 will be up, and there's probably going to be an uptick after earnings. I'm waiting for a safer price level to enter. My broker blocked my account from trading Macy's on the day that I wanted to buy at 5.90 USD. But that's life."
"Macy's: A Christmas gift? Low unemployment, low interest rates, stock market at highs, high consumer sentiment. Daddy is going to spend his bonus this year buying Momma her favorite cashmere sweater at Macy's, don't you think?"
So a good retail number tomorrow and this goes to moon ???????????
Today's shoppers chose Macy's for their brick and mortar retail purchases. Not to mention their online purchase growth. Theyre closing the underperforming stores and without them Same Store sales are up not down the measly 0.6% they reported. Plus the stage stores grew and weren't reported on Wednesday. This quarter is going to be a huge surprise. I wouldn't want to stay short. Buy now while it's stock is on sale and celebrate with us long
"I just checked in Google Trends a comparison between Macy´s and Nordstrom relative to how many searches people are making with those two names in the last 5 years in the USA. It is interesting to see how Macy´s has overtaken Nordstrom in the last 12 months and now surpasses Nordstrom by a big margin. It appears to me that Macy´s is getting more interest in internet, probably a reaction to improved online sales at macys.com. I am attaching the link to this search, but I am not sure if it will work out."
Macy’s has no bargaining power and relevance in the retail space. All brands and labels are selling direct to consumer via e-comm. Macy’s is basically mall space &POS for these brands. Only the week low end brands will rely on Macy’s now for exposure and POS. Macy’s doesn’t have a future partnering with these low interest brands.
All my stocks are up in pre-market but the news keep talking about Joe B's new tax plan to bring corporate taxes from 21% to 28%. The politicians will probably compromise at 25%. M won't pay 2020 corporate taxes since they lost $12 per share. I suspect in 2021 they'll probably break even so no corporate taxes. Since M paid $28 million in debt for the last quarter of 2020 they'll pay at least double the interest for 2021 since we have $500 million in new bonds. This new interest will be could for not paying corporate taxes and allowing CEO Gennette to make his customary $12 million salary & bonus'.
Does anyone here know in what form did management grant themselves extra compensation? Cash or stock? I hope it was stock.
"Facebook deal in my opinion was brilliant. It instantly modernized the Macys name. I'm feeling great about the company. -Tons of great and very valuable real estate.-Online presence is getting better every day. (Macys,BLOOMINGDALES and Blue Mercury)-Brick & mortar stores are very much needed. Lots of opportunity. -Fabulous dividend.-Great leadership. Their game is just beginning!"
"Actual Macys earnings and sales will be much, much higher than their conservative guidance!!By several hundred percent!!"
Macy's is so under-priced when compared to any number of retailers. Do your research. For example: Wayfair Market Cap $25B Rev 9B Net Income -800M. Macy Market Cap $4B Rev 23B Net Income -200M. Macy could be a 5 bagger and still be a better value than Wayfair.
Nomanskt get a life you are on here 24 7. No big money maker would waste there time on here by by short can’t wait for your Margin call squeeze is coming the price is where it is with all bad news factored in we go down with market and up it goes low but then right back up next year no doubt we at 10 who wants to buy clothes on amazon some ppl wanna see it and all this lockdown stuff will get old quick and people will just risk it what are we all gonna stay in forever I think not this might help brick in mortar in long run
So what.............Real Estate is valued at $12.00 billion. Do the math!!
Pencils have to be sharpening on Macy's in private equity shops. Herald Square is now in play imo.
"I went to the mall to buy some clothes a couple of weekends ago and walked around Macy's, I was very disappointed; I.e; prices, selection, etc. I left without a purchase. I went to a few more stores and long story short, I ended up spending my money at JC Penney's"
"The only thing I like about M right now is the valuation but I'm starting to get fed up with the management. You can't make all these excuses about execution if DDS, JCP and JWN all had well received earnings."
Fluctuations can be usefull to make some extra swing trade money.Key levels buy 6.30 USD - 6.48 USD sell 6.72 - 7.20 USD. (THIS IS NO ADVICE!!!)Macy day by day in short term:
"Ross Stores $40B Market Cap (13B Revenue 1B profit). Macy's $5B Market Cap (20B Revenue .5B profit). Ross is 8X bigger than Macy's with less revenue and more profitability. Remember Macy now has tons of expense cuts/savings. Conservatively, Macy is a $20B Market Cap company. (1/2 of Ross). That is a 4 bagger as we sit today!"
"How much of a fall out will we see in retail business? How will things move forward in 2021?I'm curious to hear your guys opinion. To be honest, I'm not sure which companies and how many will survive. I personally anticipate a 25% chance of bankrupcy for Macy's in the upcomming 1 year."
"The strong survive leaving Macy's as one of 2 or 3 that will. Neiman, Lord & Taylor, JCP -- gone."
No way do 100 million shares short cover in a day. Will be weeks of nail scratching and insults. Up we go!
Breaking out..
"Thanks Morgan Stanley, bought more shares after your [$25] downgrade last week!"
"Macy's Inc. said Thursday it plans to hire 80,000 seasonal employees for the holidays, the same as in 2018.No growth."
Is today going to impact our share price Or are we gonna stay in the five dollar range?
Now that they have taken it up. They will take it down after 10ish. The bas$$$
"25,334.00+4.00 (+0.02%)As of 10:12PM EST. Market open."
Down trend broke. 50 days MA average retested and holding well above $5.80. If it continues to hold then we will have a nice trend reserve tomorrow. We are back to $7 and more soon
"Best trade at present. I’ve had a few now. 1. Large household brand name that was profitable before Covid. 2. Business trashed by Covid short term. 3. Near term debt worries. Bankruptcy gossip. 4. Massive senior notes issue making bankruptcy impossible for next couple of years. 5. Business starts to come back on stream. Rinse, repeat. You can pretty much just google “senior notes issue” and they all pop up. HTZ stumbled at 4 & 5. Many of them are probably zombie companies long term but who cares."
my goodness lots of excitement for 15 cents :))))))))
Volume tells you what you need to know.... institutional buyers are rotating into the retail sector after having made a killing in the stay at home stocks.
$30+ in 2 weeks.
10+ before Christmas it’s just obvious
HUGE 300k PLUS BUY is coming !!!!
"Analysts interests are aligned with their firms and their clients. They short the stock when they downgrade, then tell their clients to buy at lower price. They are fully aware Macy's have no place to go but up."
"I'm looking at this sector, I don't see any competition in the luxury retail market. Even if the malls go out of hand with closings, M can open their exterior doors.. Big time property owners.. online presence isn't gonna compete with amazon shoppers, but malls aren't going anywere either. I'm a new investor, up 15% in oil since March. looking to add diversity, thinking this is a 2-3 year win."
REDDIT ALERT!!!!!!$18.50 Close!!!!! BUY BUY BUY
New analysts- Underperform
6.41 percent dividend. Too cheap to buy now. Look at EPS.
Congress is planning to extend unemployment and eliminate withholding taxes.This means a huge amount of money in the consumers pocket.I see a vaccine Sept or Oct receiving FDA emergency approval and millions vaccinated that month.We will back to normal just in time for the holiday season.A full quarter with all Macys stores open and ready.Last year was the shortest holiday season on record from Thanksgiving to Christmas yet they beat on sales and earnings. I see they doing better this year with all this money in the consumers pocket and a longer holiday season and the covid nonsense will be over.HUGE 200 percent or more gains in this stock from now to then.Watch stock holders are in for a wonderful ChristmasUnless you are frightened away before then
Just sit back and claim your 0.38 dividend in 16 days... and probably a 10% gain too.
Short squeeze coming
"Tomorrow I going to be sick and I mean sick in a great way. Macy's will beat both the consensus and the whisper number. shorts will realize they are toast. with over $12billion (and that is very conservative) in real-estate and with the new direction they are going with e-commerce Macy's will quickly capture more market share. Shorts, write this down and respond back to me in 6 weeks and tell me how you feel."
"Looking like we could have a strong close, maybe 13.50. Then it’s off to the races through earnings in February"
Macy Backstage
Almost a million shares traded premarket... nice!
"Well it looks like M only needs to split into 3 companies and the stock will go up 25%...Macy's, Blue Mercury and Bloomingdale's"
"i am expecting 4.05- 4.1 EPS and revenue beat and upbeat guidance with 20% run on Tuesday. Remember they released the statement on Jan 10, there was a huge winter storm which would have definitely boosted their sales in Janurary much more that it did last year."
people still like to go out shopping and Christmas coming up this stock should be a good buy and a sweet dividend.
FOR SURE $30 WILL TOUCH SOON. GOD BLESS STIMULAS $1400 check SUPPORT YOUR GOVERMENT AND MAYCY'S
Nothing will Describe today’s performance better than the video below ...this for all the longs and you too Ark & breakmanhttps://g.co/kgs/mLrjt8
2m share buy at the close on Friday. I’m thinking stock pushes back up to 16.35 or so tomm.
OH MYGOD!
To me the fact that M increased the size of their tender offer by $150M suggests that they must not be having to bad of sales this holiday season. Going to be a blowout quarter. No sympathy to the shorts who thought this was JCP when the SP gaps up.
Nothing as symbolic as the Macy's Thanksgiving Parade. Macy's is the symbol of america's retail staying power.
Earnings next week shorts will put on a huge effort to cancel out buying volume when earnings come out Make certain you have a good to cancel sell order on your share so they cannot be borrowed by short smellers
looks JWN and M will be up 20% tomorrow..cheers...
Options expiration today and max main is at 10.50 and high call oi is 11. That is why having a hard time breaking 11 with an upgrade toady. After todays options clear we go higher.
"This quarter last year 8/13/18, estimates where $.50 and they made $.70. CEO mentioned store closings and tariffs; stock closed down $6; was down over $7. Don't put your hopes on earnings call next week. If you are a buyer, wait until 8/19 and then make your decision."
Volume is nice. A lot of big boys buying with both hands........... whatever it takes............ Double-digits come again sooner than many think............. you heard it here first........... short-squeeze WILL happen........... whatever it takes...........
With so many retailers out of the picture. Macy’s is the one giant left standing. When the dust settles it will gain tremendous market share!
20 this week!!! When they sleep  we eat 
Shorts remaining are in shock. They'll surely drive us to $20 near term.
"if Amazon buy Macy's is not surprising, because Macy's have worth $16 bln real estate and $26bln retail sales and $1.1bln profit, it's worth to buy, Amazon sales can increase 12% and make a lot money, Macy's can sell $32- $42 ."
"ALL SHORTS ARE IN THE RED! With M at 52 Week high NO ONE could have a positive return on a short (Except for this mornings blip up) SO, that's 300 MILLION short shares that HAVE TO COVER, DON'T SELL"
Let's ask Jeff how things go at the Goldie Suuchs presentation...while shares drop to 5 bucks.
bought another 500shares at 4.5. hold 3800shares...pray for good
"So called ""Longs"" telling everyone else to hold, when they already SOLD!"
"Macys have an awesome online presence, is going to announce excellent results this quarter, just hired over 5000 people, will benefit huge from the covid and flu vaccines, and is still the key partner in the big NY event! I see why they got the upgrades! Its about to break 7 fast!"
"Longs, The November retail sale report is out tomorrow, December 14th, and I expect, given the strength of the consumer, it will blow the 0.20% MoM forecast out of the water!"
"add a few..because in 2021, Macy will look good every quarter compared to 2020..."
Anyone want to guess on how high M goes before the ex dividend on Dec 12 2019. Looks Like Wall Streets try and shove M lower has failed because NO one is selling and we have MASSIVE buying. Looks like M will be going a lot higher before Dec 12 2019 You should just wait if you want out on M because your shares are worth a lot more than M is trading for today. But if you want to give them away go ahead at least do it with call options so you get more for your shares
Good thing I shorted this last Wednesday. Up almost 50% from my puts. No one will want to outside and shop with the looting going on now.
$10 soon :)
I added more
FYI No volume in M equals Max Pain for options holders. Going to be this way for a long time. Best way for MM's to take profit from consumer options traders. Good news is long trend is up so for real investors I think we have a good shot at success seeing lots of catalysts for Macys.
"2030, Macy will be celebrating 200 years birthday.Not bad for a company is almost as old as the young republic..."
"Reminder: Macy’s, Inc. Board Declares Quarterly DividendAugust 23, 2019CINCINNATI--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The board of directors of Macy's, Inc. (NYSE:M) today declared a regular quarterly dividend of 37.75 cents per share on Macy's, Inc.’s common stock, payable October 1, 2019, to shareholders of record at the close of business on September 13, 2019."
"The faster we get to $5 and base, the better it will be for longs. Next market correction will get us there. Market has had a huge run, time for a correction. August?"
"Macy's ran up several weeks ago, You Missed It! Don't listen to the false notion that this is going to $20 cause it already did. It barely broke $17 on a super green day."
Been trading Macy’s all year this is first time I became a bag holder lol.
"markets crash with huge sector rotations, Macy's flat. markets flat with low volume, Macy's flat. markets rip higher, Macy's flat. Shorts don't want it, longs don't want it. Just left for dead."
https://seekingalpha.com/article/4318064-like-macys-strategies-e-commerce-boom-and-all-time-high-dividend-yield-target-price-22_48
Macy's still has a long way to go before returning to the pre-covid price of $15. Sales should pop after reopening all stores. Snoopy will be very happy to be let out too. Longs can celebrate soon with July 4th fireworks!
Just went thru $16.69 which was Tuesdays high after correctionSeems resistance at $16.80 from Monday GO M
STAY THE COURSE SQUEEZE IS ON
"What a bunch of cheerleaders. Is there anyone else on this board with a brain or are you all just Dorothy's clicking your heals and saying ""the stock will go up, the stock will go up"". Good luck. Still no earnings and poor sales. Keep wishing for 25 and more and watch it sink back to 7."
People do actually like leaving their houses. People love going shopping. There will be some brick and mortar stores in the future.Macy's will be just fine.
purchased a lot more shares @ 10.30 thanks for the great discounts.
"The smart move is Amazon using Macys, Rite Aid, and Penny be a point of contact and point of delivery/return, etc.. Macy and Penny have the dressing rooms on site. From there people can take the product or return it for a slight fee, etc. - Pete"
is Macys considered a Value Stock for Long Term investment?
"Wow, Macy's moving opposite to the market. I want to buy more at some point but still playing watch N' see."
$M will get revenge and the best to come after earnings..Buy and hold till end of November at least..
There u go. Shorts are covering

This stock is obviously grossly underpriced due to covid.Macys stock will steadily return back to precovid prices and beyond. $30-70/share
"BOYS...BELIEVE ME. MACY'S AINT AFRAID OF AMAZON. PEOPLE WILL STILL GO TO MALLS, MACYS HAS A GROWING ONLINE PRESENCE, AND THEIR REAL ESTATE FAR EXCEEDS THE MARKET CAP. WISE UP AND RIDE MY COAT TAILS. THIS STOCK IS OVER 20 BEFORE YEAR END...BANK IT!!!!.......OHHHH, AND THE DIVIDEND AINT BAD EITHER !!!"
"I for one would wait to sell any shares of M, Why because the shorts are not going to want to pay that 10% dividend and if there are no shares for sale the shorts will drive M higher and a lot higher. By waiting I think you will get a lot more for your share in a short time frame. Do what you want . But once shorts see it going higher and they are going to have to pay 10% LOL Greed will take over and they will cover because they will be losing money LOL"
worst is over and Market is forward looking so good day for M
"Great interview with CEO of Macy's on Mad Money last night. If you didn't see it you should check it out.CEO laid out their plan for the future, which we all ready know and was very positive about current and future sales."
Bought 300 shares last night... come on junior keep climbing!
"Downgrading debt hurts, though they've already refinanced much of it to take advantage of low rates. Said it before, they need to float a convertible bond for $1+billion. Use the funds, in part, to buyback shares (interest rate much lower than dividend rate), part to get out from under any remaining higher priced debt. Perhaps 2% interest rate and a conversion price of $26 for a 5 year convertible. They have the underlying assets and cash flows to make this happen. If the stock runs anytime in the next 5 years, buyers get the shares at a discount (lots of scenarios which could see M run -- its real estate value alone makes it an takeover target)"
"To prevent the short seller from borrowing your shares:All you do is to phone your broker and put an order in saying that you wish to place your shares for sale at, for arguments sake, double today's price. As they are 'on order' they cannot be lent out by your broker and in turn you are reducing the amount of 'free shares' out there that can be used for shorting purposes."
Since M could not break through $21.1 it may test a low considering the low volume in the stock price. Let's hope it bounces off the $17.03 range. If so I would be happy with that as a new baseline bottom.
Macy’s need to take that $1.5 billion and BUY BACK SHARES NOW!!!
Double Bounce Confirmed...... Going to Rocket upward !!!!!!
Inching up before earnings must have the whopping short position here absolutely on edge. Buy.
"Timber. I really feel that Macy’s knew in December that they will not make the numbers. This type of guidance report is not written on the fly. Usually this type of reports takes several weeks to draft up and cleared up by senior management. For Macy’s to report future guidance over one month before earnings, don’t count on it. More bad news are coming. Maybe more store closures or financial restructuring. Like I said before , earnings will be dismal at best. They need to change their operations. Look at what Nordstrom is doing to survive. Macy’s needs more younger innovative executives in senior management"
"Like a Goldman downgrade noting facts in hand now for over a month really means anything. Goldman, Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse have been trashing the retail sector for nearly two years now in hopes of creating false narratives about consumer sentiment and consumer spending. All in hopes of creating another false illusion concerning an impending recession that will not be here for at least two years and maybe longer now that the European trading partners are now seeing strength in their respective economies. So Goldman must be trying to drive prices down even further in giving their clients a better entry point right before ex-div. no less. If they weren't the most corrupt financial house out there, their opinion might actually mean something."
Establishing a brand for children is a very good strategy in the long run.
Too many analysts have holds or sells on Macy's. Way too many with this report. Looking forward to all of them raising to buy!
"States will have a different opinion within the next few days, when they realize 2nd wave was blown out of proportion. Schools and business are opening and there will be sudden change of opinion on retail sector when is a sudden rush for clothing. Macy's and Nordstrom will be in a great position with competitors out of picture."
Is Macy's going to pay a dividend at the end of the month?
And still the Morgan Stanley analyst hasn't reversed her downgrade.
"Bezos is Bailing certain Mall-Buildings Formerly Anchored by JCP & Sears from Simon-Property-Group, the owners, not Macy's. lol"
"A little bump in the road. I just bought 2,000 shares on the dip!"
"I like M and always have, but that's an emotional type thing.A cold winter can help M. - Still tho when dry cleaners in New York state are closing that's bad. - Pete"
Buy at will at this level as much as you can. Give it a few weeks and months and be rewarded big time!
"Zacks is correct, earnings estimates climbing."
"Interesting, this friday's chart looks just like last friday?"
"Macy's sales affected by stock market crash in winter, American people lost a lot of money in stock market, but stock market rebound this year and keeping low unemployment rate and people income rise, so Macy's sales this year will be very good year, I think Macy's sales have over 4% growth in this year, it's profit have over $4.00 per share, all high ranking retailers stock price too low, but Macy's lower than anyone, I think Macy's can reach $62 per share in 2019 if Fed won't rise rate, in 2018: Fed rise rate too many times hurt Macy's, if Fed rise rate only 2 times in 2018, Macy's sure be $62 per share now, in June quarter and September quarter of 2018, Macy's sales have strong growth, that means people trend to shopping high ranking retailers Macy's when people have enough money, American people income will continue rise if Fed won't rise rate, so buy Macy's can make a lot of money, don't buy wmt, tgt,dg, old navy, their sales looks good, but their things are not high ranking things,their sales will slowdown if people income rise, because American economic growth will enter high ranking things growth,"
"If this starts rallying like it in did in 09 on a retail recovery, watch out. Sky's the limit. We were almost at $70 in 2015. Do you really think many more people went from Macy's to Amazon in 3 years to warrant a 300% drop? Are sales 300% worse today than 2015? Give me a break. Online shopping was very strong in 2015 just like today. If we were comparing to 2005, then I could understand. This stock was WAAAAY oversold and now it is staging another comeback. All the catalysts are in place."
SHORTS better COVER
so let's recap where we left our masked avengers : * Holiday sales to the upside* Macy's hires more to handle upside sales* Macy's buys down long term debt* Tax bill signed drops Macy's tax rate 17%
Half of staff are still laid off. No volume even in furniture department.
"The restructuring actions will take pre-tax cash charge of about $180 million in fiscal 2020, mostly in the fiscal second quarter. The COVID-19 pandemic has largely hurt the company’s business. Jeff Gennette, chairman and CEO, said ""COVID-19 has significantly impacted our business. While the re-opening of our stores is going well, we do anticipate a gradual recovery of business, and we are taking action to align our cost base with our anticipated lower sales."""
Shorts at work. Going higher. CC will push this up 3-4 bucks. Book it. Very positive results.
Way over done and will be up on anything they post for earnings. anyone who wanted to sell has sold.
Love MACY stock..will be 20$/ share before december on holiday season...BULLISH this quater
Shorts - give me one reason not to buy M after excellent results and clear long term picture.
Macy‘s WILL survive! That‘s all you need to know.............. and that every third share is sold short of course => epic short-squeeze coming........... whatever it takes!!!
"Macys is a great investment opportunity. Going, going gone!These low prices wont last!"
Cheapest stock I can think of. Dividend alone is a handful.
M is now yielding 9.8%
Retailers will cool off then some will rebound ( M is a maybe on the rebound)
"Personally, I'm amazed this stock and company are doing this well. I sold it at 8. So for more investment advice, don't follow me."
YoY results will be in the toilet but they will spin it that it was better than Q2 of course. Its great they got a mulligan to stay open but will find that revenues will decline much steeper than forecasted and debt payments more onerous to pay. Train is a mile away but Macys super glued on the tracks
Starting to come back up. Get in while discounted price lasts
Fact Check: The Math Adds Up for Trump’s Claim That USPS Undercharges Amazon!
Lets Ride!
should have sold it $7 ahhhh
"Close will be interesting today, wondering if the shorts will want to cover before the end of the day, makes no sense to short Macy's, things ARE getting better. Cover and go long, don't fight the tape! The trend is UP for the time being."
"sell every pop. Macy's, easiest short ever. Gennette is CEO, short it"
"Current dividend yield at $14.89 is over 10%. This is one of the forces that will drive M up, sooner or later. Short selling keeps pushing on a string with only small movement as shorts keep committing capital. Shorts are subject to unlimited losses and they must pay the dividend on top of any fees they pay to obtain stock to short. Shorts are in a high risk position while those taking long positions at these prices seem to have a very good stop loss position with a high potential gain for a nice, good risk/reward, swing trade potential, IMO. Do the math and your own due diligence and don't listen to shorts or based any decisions on chat board comments, LOL"
Chart looks like last year? So does that mean we get a replay of Nov-December? haha
"Stock opens at 6.90 and closes at 7.20, and that is reported as a drop of -0.11. What is wrong with this? Bullish long term, Macy's will survive, but it will take many months."
Looks like Macy’s caught the flu. Along with lots of other stocks. Best manipulation in years!!!!!!!
"April sales better than expected, especially beauty, activewear, home and furniture. Cash-burn much lower than expected, see yesterdays CNBC-interview with CEO Jeff Gennette... Macy‘s to reopen on Monday:-) Going back to normal step by step....."
Maybe Macy’s actually knows what it’s doing.
Is it going hit 11.00
"Macy's CEO sees $10 billion in retail opportunities:https://www.pymnts.com/news/retail/2020/macys-chief-sees-10b-in-retail-opportunities/Recap of yesterdays numbers:- Macy's WILL survive- Numbers bad (like everyones in times of COVID), bad BETTER than expected- Financing backed by owned real estate is on track (Macy's owns about half of its stores/malls)- Reopening of all 775 stores/malls Nationwide is on track (with another 80 openings this weekend)- About a third of all outstandig shares are sold short => Short-Squeeze getting traction- Stockprice almost on mid-March low => Huge catch-up potential- Dividends to be reinstated as soon as COVID-Crisis is overIt would be very astonishing if Macy's stockprice won't be double-digits this fall/winter 2020"
"I just doubled down here, but am now so far in margin, I cannot buy any more … geez, what a roller coaster this has been. my other big picks now are Ford, Nokia, and AU (a gold miner); I used to hold HPQ, Intel, amongst some others,"
MArgin requirement on Macy has gone up to 60 %. This will be fun now for shorts. And Good results wuill be another catalyst.
Why it is going down.. it supposed in 40s.
"Where is that guy who was yelling that bankruptcy is imminent, kinda miss him already."
"Nearly 96M shares of M stock was sold short out of 309M shares outstanding, or basically 1/3. Just something to think about."
TJX $80B Market Cap. (40B revenue 3B profit). Macy $5B Market Cap (20B revenue .5B profit). Should TJX be 16X times bigger than Macy? No. Maybe 5x to 6x bigger okay. Macy is UNDERVALUED!!!
I agree what a great time to buy with a 6% dividend yield. When do you think it will get back to 30 buck anyone.
"$5,26 and so ready for rebound......... corona will be gone in a few weeks, but Macy‘s (M) will stay and shine bright again.......... shopaholics and customers have a lot to catch-up and will crowd the malls and stores very soon.......... whatever ut takes........"
Time to sell ONLINE retailers alike Amazon and buy brick and mortar retailers like Macys.Tide is turning towards brick and mortars retailers.
"Macy’s Q3 forecast, according to Zacks, is just $0.01 per share. I expect, based on better operating metrics ie lower cost, less discounts, we will see closer to $0.10 per share. Revenue will be in line with the $5.3 billion forecasted. The SP will likely pop $1-2 dollars from the $15/share we now see then recede in the following days."
KSS almost recovers from COVID..
2021 guidance is weak. .40 cents per share? That is about 125M in profit for a $5B Market Cap. That is a 40PE. Too expensive.
Macy will go up tomorrow unlike anything we have seen before. I am looking at $30 to $40 range.
Macy's has to be a top ten vaccine trade for gains. Buy.
earnings tomorrow or May 18?
When's macys next dividend date? Help!
Today is options expiration with a short trading day. 15000 contracts at 11 strike calls have to close below 11. Dont worry about today.
"My family shops at Macy's. Nothing beats the fitting room. FYI, foot traffic is still picking up. So is mail traffic."
Can we cross in to the 13’s today? I think so
I think no longs would anticipate dividends in near future anymore? I remember getting 15% dividend with the same stock price a year ago.
This is holding pretty good in a very bad in the market...
We are heading back up to $18 and beyond. Their earnings will surprise.
Crossed the 200 day moving average Next technical event is when the 50 day crosses the 200 day moving.This is called a Golden Cross and is extremely bullish. The next favorable Technical event is when the stock fills the gap between $27-30. Expect $31 by end of January or earlier.
"If the market trades this back to retail sector multiples, it goes back up to $22-25. See this trading between $14.50 and $20 over the next couple years."
Heard on cnbc Blue Horseshoe loves M.
$8+ next week after earnings. Retail and online sales to be better than expected. Stay the course and reap the rewards. I'm definitely long on this one. Patience is a virtue. Ample opportunities lie ahead. LFGM!
I work at one of the two Macy’s D to C mega warehouses located in Martinsburg WV. I’ve been their since 2012 this is by far the busiest season I’ve been a part of since I started working here. I bought 200 shares Macys two months ago at around $15 a share just waiting for the February 4 quarter report I wouldn’t want to be a short ￼that comes out. ￼￼￼
China tariffs will wreck Amazon's and Walmart's popularity. Back into M my friends. Buy.
"I'm curious here about a post I keep seeing: I keep seeing people posting about how Macy's is such a great ""real estate"" play and how it has good ""real estate assets"". Can someone clarify what they mean? I checked financials and I see that Macy's has assets, but not much in the way of NET assets. Their debts almost completely cover their tangible assets. Just subtract of goodwill and intangibles, which are worthless for a department store anyway, and this becomes clear. The tangible book is still well under the current market cap right? The dividend is nice, and I agree they are undervalued for sales, but this is because their operating profits and earnings keep declining on average year after year. No one is sure the company can hold its capital value. I want to hear from an investor why they think this is such a good play."
Amazon buying Macy’s? OMG!!!! 100 % up overnight?!
Just added to my position. I like Macy's position here. Will be a great 2021.
"Ok, bad bet. Got out with a small loss."
"I’ve been following Macy’s for a while now and I can tell you that this is a home run stock in the making. Over the last ten years, on average, Macy’s has made about 25B in revenue and 1B in profit, which is much more than Nordstrom, yet Macy’s is about 40% cheaper. The only thing shorts are saying is that retail is dying and amazon will eat Macy’s up, yet, Macy’s online presence is growing - it’s one of the top ecommerce stores in the US. Also, there is a stimulus check coming which means more sales! Get in while you can, this is easily going 30+."
How do you like todays pre-market shorties?:-) Macy‘s (M) will teach shorties a lesson they‘ll never forget........ M going to double-digits (again) sooner rather than later......... whatever it takes........
Seriously people....pay attention to the trend....and for the past few days and general market sentiment in this sector is DOWN
this company has lost it's shine and is heading down the path of JC Penny ! so sad what their customer service does !
M stock soon will be trading in the 20s pushing towards the 30s.Why? Because stock is too undervalued and covid is ending.Covid numbers dramatically down!Michigan and California and many states lifting restrictions due to vaccines and drop in new cases!The worse is over! Most have immunity now!
Do you guys think it's worth taking shorts of 6.2 now? Are there any prerequisites for a further decline?
$20 STOCK
"Even when M goes to 18,21,28,42 (Like a year ago)....I will still be earning 10.6% on my dividends years from Now....remember the percent is Always based on purchase price..Not current price... The More Ya Know."
online numbers should be terrific
Short covering destined to take us to $30. Buy.
"They say you should never extrapolate your personal experience into a broad trend. That being said, was surprised at the amount of activity at the Macy's at the Emerald Sq. Mall outside of Providence on Saturday."
"Amazing economy, Ford investing 1.5 billion into two plants in all places, Detroit, MI. If it weren't for companies shooting themselves in the foot, and the left opposing everything at every bend, the economy would be like the post war economy of the early 50's. Boeing is definitely dragging exports and GDP down with the 737 Max debacle and GM and the UAW definitely hurt numbers last quarter with the 45 day strike, but other than the exceptions the economy is the best in a LONG time. The stock market drop last year which put a serious damper on spending going into the Christmas season merely pent up buying for a year, it looks from all reports that people are making up for the short fall from last year."
Target up 10 percent. Jwn up 1.5. This cannot be down today. It’s impossible
Alot of sellers bailing out there. Lets hope the buys come in stronger. I am holding. Been holdingong enough to see this through
"Macy's ended fiscal 2016 with 1.7B left on it's buyback authorization. They still have not bought back any shares since, but instead focused on massive debt reduction and billions on capex. They never said they were halting buyback shares (market assumes this bc they haven't), only JWN said they were halting buybacks. 500M can buyback over 33.33% of all outstanding shares.. incredible!"
Headed back to $10
Any chance this will recover tomorrow. Huge loss with this &$&!?$ stock
Cover.
Can someone please check on Nomansky and make sure he's ok?
Macys share holders the wind is at our backs! Expect huge capital gains this year! Massive short squeeze eventually but the shirts are stubborn but will eventually capitulate!!
This next quarterly report M will show a profit again.
"My response to someone earlier who was saying Macy's no longer innovates. (That person delete their comment but I don't want to waste a perfectly good highlight of some of the good things happening at Macy's regarding innovation) Just recently articles has shown Facebook popups where users can like items at Macy's stores. As well as the VR initiative for furniture shopping that I'm sure could be expanded upon. Also, the recent acquisition of STORY will present interesting plays on items in the future. Not to mention the initiative they are doing with social platforms to encourage users to share their experience, which is turn promotes their store and products. Finally, the mobile sales numbers, which I last heard was something like over a billion. I think the CEO recognizes the consumer shift and trends and is doing a awesome job at adapting to what they demand."

Let’s not forget about the dividend 2 weeks away!! Will be back to mid 30s within 2 weeks
As soon as stores start to re-open Macy's will be back to $15+. Maybe spike to $20+ with the massive 45% shorted float.
"The Wall Street Journal reported last summer that Simon Property Group, the nation’s biggest mall owner, was in talks with Amazon to turn Simon’s anchor department stores into Amazon distribution centers."

"Heads up folks.. CEO Jeff Gennette just bought 5,000 shares on May 17th at 21.96 a share."
This stock is more than doubling this year! Great year for a survivor of the pandemic!
Hands up! Who was able to buy under $5? Perfect move!
"Bought a bunch of $15 October calls, looking to capitalize on short term pop in stock price, as investors look to capture the 10% dividend, before x dividend. Payout ratio is 38%, safe."
black Friday coming. Macy's was packed last nite. look for a XMAS bonus on Macy's stock price
macy's is the most organized and cleanest store you'll ever walk into .Some people have other comments and their motives are very questionable. Macy's is not going away no matter what some analysts say. The numbers don't lie and they are going to be big. all up from here.
shorts in panic mode
"Regarding competitors, $M is holding strong..We are still in the up trend and the best to come.I would wait untill earnings before resigning on this one..Good luck to all.."
We get over 26 the flood gates will open dividend only 2 weeks away
"How often do you see companies like Macy's trying out new formats like Market by Macy's when their core business which they've been in for a century is strong and growing? They see the writing on the wall for malls and department stores. The question is how long, painful, and money losing will the transition period be from mall based department store operator to their new concept? And, of course, will they ultimately find success in this new avenue? Woolworths is now foot locker, but I'm certain the road was bumpy. They have a long way to go to become the company that they want to be. A triple since November and no word about their holiday performance, whereas they usually update in early January. I do wonder how their core business is doing? My guess is very bad!"
"This just in, “Macy’s amended 13G filing from Wednesday evening showing raised stake by Yackman asset management from 24.4 million shares at end of last quarter to 45.4 million shares”. Very bullish sign. Reported on my Ameritrade account"
8+ billion debt
GPS is near 10B market cap... We have a lot of upside to go.
if i buy the stock today do I get the dividend ex date says 12/12
"Double digit growth at BlueMercury and Bloomingdale's unfairly values M...CEO comment here just proves how underappreciated Bloomingdale's is........ In fact Bloomingdale's flagship store, 59th Street has had its best year since 2013. The renovation of the 59th Street store brought new energy, products and experiences to this great location."
Covid19 is still around who needs to go out and buy clothing? Down we go!
Will be surprised if it ends flat today. The way it’s going. Ba$$&@$
If you havnt learned to just buy 1000 or more shares around $5 and wait for your free daily 25 cent pop idk what else will save you slowly from your long losses and positions going no where for 6 months while the market flies everywhere else besides energy.
"I spent a little time re reviewing M performance in 2020 and past years.Really these guys have done an incredible job. They increased cash position, took on some extra debt but basically that went to the cash position. They have a large loss but that is mostly from write-downs, not really on cash losses. 2021 they will almost certainly hit $20B. if they just trade at 0.5 times revenue that would put them at roughly $30 a share. (I would think that would only be reached in the summer once it was obvious that they are on track to strong returns, and a path for growth from the $20B was clear for 2022.There seems to be no reason they should not be able to get back to $3.5-$5 a share profit that they saw in 2018 and 2019. Lets say they hit $3 a share with the future looking like $4 a share in 2022, That could drive a 10x multiple. Especially if they can create a story around digital sales. For examples of legacy companies that came up with modern stories look to Viacom up over 200% on release of streaming Paramount + or MSFT up 10x in the past 7 years going to cloud subscription from software sales and upgrades. M has the name, now can they figure it out? who knows. but they are in a position to ."
"Macy's have two departments, real estate development and retailers department, American economic continue growth is very good news for Macy's, it's real estate price rise and it's retailer sales rise too, Macy's stock price too low, it's worth $45 per share now, Macy's is high ranking retailers , low unemployment rate is very good news for Macy's, because people make money easy sure be trend to shopping high ranking retailers, SO Macy's can reach history high in 2years, American economic continue growth at least 4years no any problems,.SO strong buy Macy's, make stock money and get high dividend, see you in $100 per share."
"When do they start selling their store fixtures, racks, shelving, etc.?"
Added 1000 last week. JCP loss is Macy's gain
Sears sold off its real estate to put money in Eddie Lambert's pocket and keep SHLD (K mart & Sears) alive. When M starts mass selling of their real estate I'm out. Until then I'm going to enjoy my dividends that Nominsky and his boiler room buddies are going to pay. I thought with the billion of dollars Tiffany offer and M stating they were declaring their next dividend payment M would be on a tear this week. Oh well it is only Tuesday morning.
so your millionaires today ?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tU4VjGrqKE

"Average analyst target is 7.77, and lots of ubullshish analysts opinions recently. Am long from $5. Completely expected a sell off after this great week. Market is nervous today. Am planning on holding a year or more. Short squeezes will happen again, just gotta cool off the engines a little first. All the shorts posting every 2 minutes on here are hilarious. Since I know they've been short since $5, I gotta laugh at their confidence."
The only person who likes Nomanski's posts is himself! Aueee Duffy
"Forget $50! My target for $M is now $150 as I watch the $GME short squeeze. $GME is now $230 AH, ah ha ha ahhh ha ha!"
"Just a reminder:The board of directors of Macy's, Inc. (NYSE:M) today declared a regular quarterly dividend of 37.75 cents per share on Macy's, Inc.’s common stock, payable July 1, 2019, to shareholders of record at the close of business on June 14, 2019."
"5 PE does not make sense for M. That metric shows negative sentiment that is way over done. Still looks to me like a double from here is coming this year, especially as the market gets a boost from the FED and when Trump makes some sort of deal with China. Still can get a very outsized dividend yield that is relatively safe. The enterprise value is double the market value which is another helpful clue. I was looking at their on line catalogue yesterday and it is one of the better catalogs for clear display and lots of information. I like they way it is put together and think it will continue to grow their internet sales. It is a fast and responsive catalogue, and they will be adding third party vendors to make it more diverse. Prospects here seem excellent to me for anyone buying under $20. Please do your own due diligence as these are my personal opinions."
Mothers love Macy’s.
"this is a buy at this price, anyone who has been around long enough knows this as fact! just look at 2008 when the sky was falling, this will be double digits by October. mark it"
M is 50% off. This company is profitable plus their online presence is getting stronger and more profitable. Could easily double from here in my opinion.
"Gnome, you ask a valid question, Nordstrom's numbers were good as was L Brands. I think management needs to either figure out how to boost the lower tier stores or jettison them and focus on the prime locations and to start to make the Blue Mercury purchase pay for itself by growing the brand and integrating it into the stores."
traded strong today. positive sign for earnings...
"KSS already 6B market cap.. close to recovery..M still have 60% upside before year end..of course, $40 next year."
"ok, so looking at this chart, on MACYS on yahoo... on June 1st- June 8th it spiked from low $6 range all the way up to $10... but then just as quickly, within 3 days was back down in the low $6 dollar price... what was the catalyst that caused that surge...?? and is it possible to happen again after earnings release? Even if the long term prospects are not good, that short volume is massive... and i could see some big money players, talking Macys into delaying the Earnings Report.. a few weeks until they accumulated some shares and planned a short squeeze... to make some quick money... idk.. if it spiked to $10 again, those $8 calls are only like .15 cents... but then again, if some hedge funds were planning a short squeeze, wouldnt those call option volumes be way up... like in the 10's of thousands contracts... not just a couple thousand.. in the cents price range.... i just wish i knew why Macys delayed reporting their Q earnings a few weeks.."
"I can't wait to hear the good news over the weekend, I know our macy's opened back up today and they have a parking lot of cars here in Texas......"
"Now you all learned what a value trap is. You could've just listened when people told you what it is, but you decided to lose a lot of money instead. To each their own.So now the dividend you all thought was a big deal is gone. Next to go will be ""but but but they own real estate!"""
"third time's the charm (hopefully). We've crossed the 12 for 3 times the last couple of weeks, if we break through now, we're flying :-)"
Told you soooo.2021 is going to be a great year for Macys stock holders.Ask yourself are things getting better or worse. Much better is the answer!
funny how things start going up before the news comes out
just trying to get back into M after making $$$ but sold out at $15 and missed out further upside....however with NYC set to re-open by July 1 and vaccinations going very well I am now BUYING M calls in August $21...BUY M august CALLS $21!!!
IM NOT SELLING. ACTIVISTS REMEMBER ROBINHOOD. UNITE AGAINST THE HEDGES. CITRON FOLDED ITS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME IM DOWN OVER 20%. MY ENTIRE PORTFOLIO IS UP OVER 25% IN LESS THAN TWO MONTHS ANYWAYS I COULD LOSE EVERYTHING ON THIS AND ID STILL OWE TAXES AND BE GREEN THIS YEAR I AINT SELLING!!
This is definitely a short term play. Shopping centers with brick and mortar stores are all going bye bye.
Is it a legit company???
So much for the fear over losing out to Amazon. Online sales out of sight!
Forty per cent of Macy's float is sold short and has to be bought back. Hold your shares. Make the short smellers pay top dollar. It's Macy's not Wal Mart
Hold your position longs.Forget about it until Macy?s hits $10.I am.
Why would someone sell at this price. Dividend and holiday season around the corner
"I've been trading stocks for many years and I've never seen a setup like Macy's. It is poised to go much higher, even in the face of a falling market. My guess somewhere around 7.07 tomorrow and inching higher throughout the week."
This is a 40$ stock
Macy’s
"In at 25.75, lowering my cost basis quite a bit. Deal of the lifetime."
Lord & Taylor will be history soon!!! Buy Macy’s!
whats the consensus on today's financials for M? Would you load up now or wait until tomorrow to decide?
Great! Going back to pre COVID levels of $20/share before January. Retail is too cheap not to buy.
"Ex-dividend date is coming up on December 12, buy while you can to get your 38 cents per share dividend for this quarter!"
good luck everyone next week 25 soon. They won't allow the rest of my post
It will be acquired by Amazon for 30 dollars
I think it held up pretty good today under the circumstances.
Macy’s got over 3.5 billions cash and next quarter revenue up big and even or profit. Good price for long term now
Will add January puts sometime today.

"Some hedge fund managers covering short positions. 10M share trade. Remember, if you are long and own a significant amount of shares above 15, put in a GTC limit order above 19, it makes a big difference for long positions because there are less shares for fund managers to borrower for shorting"
"Follow the volumes, they are already at 35% of their daily volume within 45 minutes."
JCP is a better buy currently than Macy's. Let's watch percentage moves over next two months from (M $14.75) and JCP ($1.09).
"Is Macy’s new partner google? Google wants a brick and mortar presents for its ecosystem and possibly expand its product portfolio significantly by adding private label brands of multiple product categories beyond technology.Macy’s today announced the appointment of Torrence Boone, vice president, Global Client Partnerships at Google, to its board of directors, effective December 12, 2019."

"20-MAR 2020 37-cent $18 Put-Options worth $6.70 Today +1,800%, aye Dopes? lol"
Can we see any dividends to be paid by Macy's in the near future?
"A company I used to work for had a premise as part of their company vision, it was speed over greed. I think it is time that Macy's goes into high gear on optimizing parking lot spaces that for 90% of the year sit empty. I know they have an agreement with Brookfield to research 50 locations but I think it is time to possibly collaborate with other consumer discretionary companies, primarily Darden's Restaurant Group. At most of those locations DRI could set up Seasons 52, Bahama Breeze, Longhorn Steakhouse, or Olive Gardens in pretty quick order. It is time to utilize the real estate value even if it is not the ultimate plan that Brookfield is designing. It could very well be a win-win for Darden's and Macy's."
https://www.visitmacysusa.com/event/macys-4th-july-fireworks
TJ Maxx has a $80B Market Cap. Ross Stores has a $40B Market Cap. Ross yearly profit is not much higher than Macy's yearly profit. Macy is $5B Market Cap. Even if you split halfway with Ross at $20B...Macy is a 4 or 5 bagger from here.
"Tron, as will I and probably pretty much everyone else with the exception of the day traders and the ETFs. I wish there was a way that the churn of a stock could really be measured, the volume of a stock is pretty much meaningless, if two large brokerage houses wanted to create a frenzy either by running a stock up or down with large volumes they could easily do that by trading one hundred thousand shares back and forth one hundred times and at the end of the day that shows 10 million shares have been traded when in reality only 100,000 shares have really been traded."
I went to Macy's Saturday and it was very crowded. And the Christmas season is coming. Can we get back to $20? Selling over done.
"next stop is around 23$.hope it will close this week above that price, and with this momentum we can visit the 30's...."
Excellent! We have one less competitor..JCP files Bk Only the Strong survive. Strongest is #1 Macy's with #2 Nordstrom a distant 2nd.
"Spot on article, https://seekingalpha.com/article/4129787-kohls-macys-still-plenty-room-run"
How come company that earns $4.5 to $5 trading @ 26? This should be trading $45 to $50 and $70 if comparable PE to JWN .
800 more shares for me. Retail is back in favor. High pe growth and tech is out for now.
Macys now is within striking distance to 20 and beyond!A great year awaits for stock holders of this retailer!
"$5.5 - $6 is the bottom line.Yesterday 1m shares bought at $6.2, volumes are increasing and retail sector back in the favor of big players..As we are now touching back the 20 MA and should quickly cross over, I think we can go around $10 before earnings and pop to at least $12 after earnings mid November.A massive short covering will happens, it already started ( - 9,15% in September) and this can help put M value back to a reasonable price $12 - $16 by end of the year.My thought, do your own research.."
Just Mentioned on CNBC.... Should OPEN above $13 !!! Great Price Action and Accumulation Today
"MACY will have an up trend from tomorrow. The down today is basically technical to fill the last gap and get the bottoming. The $23.09(3/8/19), $23.31(3/22/19) and $23.54(4/30/19) are forming the bottoming line. So M will go to $26+."
Strong Buy with both hands! Go Macy‘s go! Rebound will be hefty!!!!
time to buy
"I bought lots of this Thursday and Friday. I was thinking that Macy's is OK short term because the business is stillproducing almost 1 Billion dollars per year in free cash flow; and long term the real estate is worth well more than thecurrent enterprise value which is roughly $10 billion.But, as internet shopping continues to clobber bricks and mortar stores, maybe thereal estate values plummet long term. I've already written off most ofthe suburban mall locations, but I thought central business district locations in big cities were sure to retain valueand probably go up. But, I ain't so sure.So what's worst case for the real estate?"
"When I go to Macy's, I only shop items on sales rack 40% - 85% off items! Just like the stock price is NOW!"
strong buy from here. Macy's will be like Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. up to $20 soon.
"When they start talking about future earning tomorrow, this thing is going to get slammed. It struggles to trade 6x earnings. At $2.40 forward eps, do the math. Yuck."

I am not crazy about brick and mortar retail but Macys has one of the best chances at coming back when stores open up. I don't believe it is a great long term play but rather good for the next 6 months or $10 a share whatever comes first.
lol!! Macy's short position is my number 1 performer.Shorted an additional 1000 at the open.
Thank you for the late Christmas gift buying more tomorrow.
"This is exactly the king of stock I love. It's been hard hit by something that wasn't caused by it's fundamentals, has secured funding, it is over shorted in ways I can only dream about, has established a solid bottom and has a book value that is over 3X the current price. As the economy continues to open up I expect to see a jagged grind up. Not expecting any more crazy spikes unless the shorts panic in mass which has the potential to create a huge upside. Hope the stock drops more so I can buy more. Would love to see it under $5 again although that's probably a pipe dream."
"With heavy 15 and 15.5 call options expire Friday, M will jump tomorrow and Friday"

"Earnings were OK. However, the real value of Macy's is in its real estate. If one were to value its owned stores one would realize that Macy's is dirt cheap. I am holding on to my shares until the ""smart"" money figures out how to value the shares.By the way, in my opinion the dividend is fairly safe."
Nomansky waiting till $40 to buy again
One thing is certain with Macy's. Management is aggressively remaking its stores. Buy.
"I had 20 calls which I sold when M was around 7.2. Today, I bought 10 calls again. Tomorrow I may buy another 10. The main question is whether Macy’s can survive or not. All data point to yes! Online sales, brand name and history, the fact that Macy’s fulfills a market that no other retailer does. To get into Macy’s is a no brainer! I clearly remember several years back when Best Buy was trading around 11 dollars!! Let that sink in for a bit. Everyone thought Amazon Amazon Amazon. Somehow people forgot that shopping for electronics is more than just reading Amazon reviewing and clicking. I see the exact same thing with Macy’s. Here’s my prediction: the naysayers/short sellers hope for this to go bankrupt, but in reality Macy’s will make a few jumps to 6, 7, 9 and before you know it to low teens. Then the short sellers think wow here’s an other opportunity to short more, meanwhile Macy’s will continue to rise and those who missed out will end up chasing the stock and never get in. This is once in a lifetime opportunity. I’m long and strong!"
Analysts are forecasting that Macy’s will likely report results that fall short of expectations and are also anticipating a possible cut to its full-year outlook.
if you want to hold a department store stocks the only two that we'll make it in this environment are Macy's and Nordstrom's. take your pick. Macy's has most stores in malls but they own a lot of Real Estate. Which certainly helps the bottom line. Nordstrom's on the other hand is more of a standalone stock but they do have some in malls. My bet is on Macy's.
Great news. Much better than expected!!
looks like M stock - is heading back to $12 today -
"UBS downgraded the department stores Macy's (M) to Sell from Neutral.Analyst Jay Sole cut his rating on Macy's (M) to Sell from Neutral, lowering his price target on Macy's to $3 from $6.https://www.kiplinger.com/investing/stocks/601093/ubs-downgrades-kohls-macys"

Hey macy longs how you all doing ? are all of you ready for round two of the lock down ? its coming again and this time macys will really take it on the chin hard. Macys had plenty of time to open a 2 isle grocery store which would have kept them open for business . if this shut down happens you can look for macys to be trading about 2.00 a share by xmass
I cover my short sale from 17.10 at 14 and make 17% in 3 days and sell my M puts expiring Jan 2021 for another 100%+ profit for actual profits in 1 week. Let us know how ur strategy turns out after you wait 1 year to make that 10% dividend...
Shorted at $31.7 It seems this could be the top. now it should reverse for the next week or two.
"Vesa Equity Investment, sold nearly 5% yesterday. that's why the stock take a dip. Macy's will rebound stronger than before. $20 after Christmas"
"YOU MUST BUY NOWThese stocks will be 4 times higher in 4 years This is easiest money, easiest"
"Stock is holding well. There is still a lot of upside. Remember the $4.85 - $5.25 range? This is exactly the same thing. $7.15 to $7.45 range is the new lows. GPS is down 8.5%, JWN is down 6%, KSS is down 7%. M is down 3%."
"Macys short interest rose by 9.8 million shares from mid month and is up 15.1 millions from a month ago and now totals 77,270,000 shares. It now accounts for 28.5% of the float according to Yahoo Finance. At this level it would only take a small bit of favorable news to set off a short covering rally"
"@Nomansky thanks for keeping me grounded. Sold my calls yesterday and 70 percent of my shares today. Bought in at 5.40 so it's been a good ride. Never made so much money so fast. Kept 50 shares because I do shop at Macy's and hope they continue for another 100 years. Buy of course my shares could have languished between 5 and 6. I know you made a lot more money on the way down, and I'm sure you will continue to make money in the months and years to come. You made me laugh which would have made a loss more palatable had it happend. Good luck, keep posting - aye doppies."
Buying another 500 shares. The discount on this stock is unbelievable!
"I will remember the day when I bought 10K of M @5.80 and someone said to me ""u r dumping money into the river""Well,I guess im having the last laugh...and probably more last laugh since its still going up"
"According to Sol, it will hit 6.40 today."
Macy's shares spiking to fresh session highs on headlines the company is in talks to build an office tower on top of its flagship NYC store....from briefing.comCan anyone find headlines?

"What would happen to Amazon if both Google and MSFT stopped showing Amazon in search? LOL, Would be fun to see for sure."
just look at the options for 19.3.21.
I heard about M the other day on (http://Bestplays.uno). It’s looking like an interesting play.
"Even though I dumped my positions at a loss yesterday, just in anticipation of the continuation of the drop, I still find it comical that people try and come up with ""logical"" reasons why this and the entire retail sector is dumping. The numbers coming out of the sector are all extremely good, guidance has been excellent, consumer confidence is at multi-decade highs, unemployment is at generational lows, consumer debt loading is at multi-year lows, consumers have more money in reserves than they have in years, and enthusiasm for the upcoming Holiday season is indicating record breaking numbers and increases YOY from as low as 4% to as high as 8%. The only ""logical"" reason for the sector dump is a concerted effort by brokerage houses to manipulate the sector and drop the prices to create amazing entry points. Regardless of how analysts and shorts try and convince Main Street that stocks are at ridiculous P/E levels, that is only true of a few high fliers, mainly in the tech sector and that is/has readjusted tremendously over the past month. To have one of the largest retailers in America being traded at a single digit P/E is simply amazing."
"I posted an article this morning about PUMA which should be read. It is a positive signal that PUMA, one of M's sportswear brands is doing very well. Ms carries their shoes, and a lot of their sportswear close, so one might think they will have a hot seller in this group. Nominsky does not like Puma, apparently, but I have some great tennis sportswear from them that has lasted great and looks good. Love Puma, and maybe they can give Ms something to fight LULU with. Surprised that the Market is not picking up on this development and news from PUMA."
"Congrats longs, you deserved that move today! I'm still holding my near worthless puts as a gamble in case the market crashes in March. You were right, Macy's had a decent quarter considering the challenges they were facing."
"Never bought retail until last week. But I like the chances of clothing stores for doing well against online sellers by reason of their changing rooms. And Macy's is a solid company that has really taken a Covid hit. So nice to time things right for a change. I'd really like to see this stock above 10, maybe 16. Let's hope there are a lot of pent up shoppers chopping at the bit to get there summer and spring attire thing on."
"Eventually.. there are going to be many small player with less than 1 million in disposable income who are short in Macy and can't cover when it goes up to 15USD. The lower it goes the more retail investors are short, the easier it is to squeeze for let's say.. a billionaire from Czech Republic."
"In addition to anything else (COVID19, etc.), BCRX today revealed that they expect multiple launches of their drug Berotralstat in the next few months in USA, Europe and Japan with target revenue of $500 Million annually and have hired thirty highly experienced sales staff to handle the launches. Their market cap as of this writing is about $426 Million. That means BCRX is trading beneath one (1) times their anticipated annual sales. A conservative multiple of sales to market cap is 7.3X. To reach that conservative multiple the stock must appreciate by 856%, or 8.56X, giving a share price target of $23.39 for Berotralstate alone, not including anything with COVID 19. NICE!"
I'm good as long as M stays above $15 through earnings in February 2020.
do you know how a short squeeze happens?
"M needs to hunker down and cut expenses as much as possible in the coronavirus era. It'll ruin M's biz for a quarter or two. That's the bad news. But M makes the lion's share of their operating earnings at X-mas. By then, people will be back out and about again (one hopes!!). It'll be rough on shareholders, but once the virus issue clears, M should be able to rebound. Too bad they don't have the $$ to do a buyback. Still think a low-interest convertible note for $1.5billion (give or take) would allow them to accomplish a ton. If nothing else, buying back $1billion of shares on a 2% note costs $20mil in interest. But that billion in shares costs over $100mil in dividends. Quite an annual savings. And if the shares are bought back at $12 and convert back at $20+ a year of 3 down the line, that'd be fine, too."
"Inc. (NYSE:M) (the “Company” or “Macy’s”) announced today that it is offering, subject to market and other conditions, $1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due 2025 (the “Notes”) in a private offering. Macy’s intends to use the net proceeds from the offering of the Notes, along with cash on hand, to repay all amounts outstanding under its revolving credit facility."
"M added 1 billion in debt for 2020. Now it is close to 5 billion in debt. When JCP owed 3.8 billion in 2012 it paid $240 million a year in interest. Interest rates are lower now, so M probably pays $280 million. Divide by shares outstanding and there goes .85 cents loss per share in 2021. Isn't EBITDA fun. Keep buying the rose colored water and wait for the dividend to return. It's not free to close a store and they did say they were going to sell assets. Same as JC Penney when it started the death spiral in 2013. Y'all think smaller stores are good?"
"i think in this market Macys is the best stock, you get dividend which is high and stock appreciation and trading at very low value now. If chinese stocks are delisted, all money is coming to such stocks based in US."
KSS just announced they did great and earned about $1/share in fourth quarter in the midth of severe restrictions of covid!Less competition going forward and great positive quarter/quarter for the winners like macys and kss going forward!
Buy the 7 calls that expire Friday. Volume huge. Somebody knows something. Easy 3 bagger+
"Jim Cramer talked about something I have been talking about for a while now, the issue with pre-market and after market manipulation. Gunning stock up on low volume in the pre-market and after-market should be illegal."
"Dividend is safe for now and the restructuring appears to be on track to turn Macy’s around.It appears M share price is being manipulated to close near or at 14.5, 15.0 or 15.5 by EOD Friday’s option expiration."
"short right here, 1k shares"
"Today and tomorrow are the last two days for this quarter to capture the dividend. The yield is falling as the PPS rises, so today also is the last day to capture the current yield of 8.93 if the PPS keeps rising, which it seems like it will do to me. Do your own due diligence and you will see the dividend is covered by sufficient income to be continued and that M has paid uninterrupted dividends since 2002. Personally, I think the way they plan to use technology will improve their management of inventory and generate added profits, and their third party vendor initiative will enhance their internet catalogue profit and margins. Their exploration of more discount programs in store through Backstage brands at discounts and their use of UPthreads to bring in another class of customer willing to look at used clothing also will broaden their appeal and traffic. I also like their more targeted advertising using technology and their focus on individual store inventory rather than regional focus. They have a great position in the market in malls to sell their products if they can squeeze more margin and profits which technology can help them accomplish; and if they widen out their product offerings successfully that, too, could be a big boost to profits. Even if none of that is accomplished, they are earning enough to keep paying down debt which lowers costs of debt and increases their profits. This is a company that is about to make a big improvement in sentiment and they will sport a much better PE than 5x EPS, which will translate into a higher PPS. There is so much favorable going on that the risk at the current prices is nil and the upside is easily $30/share, IMO. I like the growth stocks, but a balanced portfolio should look at this opportunity closely before you pursue only growth stocks that are selling at very high valuations. Just a suggestion which you need to evaluate for yourself."
How low can you go?
"Though I’m in M for a long haul for divi, I think the upside is limited to about $2 more from here due to holidays. There are measures that Macy’s bosses need to do to rally the stock. Right off the bat I’m thinking 1) e-commerce on line delivered goods to home or curbside pickup; 2) discount store inside M store to compete with Ross, TJ Max. What else do you think of, feel free to chip in. BTW, I’m long 3.2K shares at $19.93 avg."
"We will know how successful Macy's results are if they spend 2 seconds talking about the performance of their 500+ department stores and 90% of the time talking about their 2 Market by Macy's stores.I can't help that I have this thing called logic in the back of my head saying that a company that normally releases Christmas sales results in early January staying quiet might not be doing the best. I can't help that I have this thing called logic in the back of my head saying that a company that is mulling issuing NEW ADDITIONAL debt a year after getting $3 billion + with their real estate pledged as collateral in order to keep operating might not be doing the best. I can't help that I have this thing called logic in the back of my head saying that a company that was trading at $15 per share in Feb 2020 with a dividend might not being doing the best one year later after a year where sales fell 40% for many months, where the dividend is gone, where additional debt of $3 billion was taken on, and where they are mulling additional debt to keep operations going."
"Positive EBITDA one quarter earlier than anticipated, strong cash position, over 1.6 billion, 3 billion additional available in untapped revolving loans, digital strength improving, strong inroads into social media to include multiple affiliate marketing platforms to include LIKEtoKNOWit, continued growth with BlueMercury and their private label cosmetics, margins grew by nearly 13%, GLA costs nearly a half billion lower, they are doing the things that they need to, not only to survive Covid, to thrive in an ever changing omni-channel retail landscape. Good report at the beginning of the day."
"Well, thanks to trump's latest round of Texas, let's call them what they really are, the entire market is poised to take a dump once again on Monday morning. Question, will dump lie and say once again that the Chinese reached out to him just try and make a deal? If things stay as they are the thirteens are a very likely site early next week for Macy's."
Macy’s is a pride of America will be end of this month $25
"Picked 1,000 shares up at 15.82 and sold em at 16.82 in 2 days. With the 15.x support and the 17.x resistance i think we can do this for a while."
"""We are pleased to announce that today, Macy's stores in New York City will begin re-opening for business, ready to safely serve customers in-store, online and on the go,"" the retailer said in a statement. ""Macy's Herald Square, the company's iconic flagship re-opens featuring a curated assortment of must-have beauty, fashion, accessories and home, plus the perfect items to click and pick-up, for every occasion. Following Centers for Disease Control (CDC), as well as state and local guidance, Macy's stores in the NY Metro area are open to the public from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m., offering in-store shopping, as well as contact-free curbside pick-up."""
back to $14 tomorrow mark this post
"Once it breaks this $11 resistance (Hopefully by end of today), it'll skyrocket to $12 or $13 tomorrow. Buy now!"
We are now above the 50 as well as the 200 day moving averages. The 50 dma is now upward sloping as well. All very strong buy signals.
Company + private equity should take Macy's private. The market's rope on the stock is about two weeks time which presents a compelling case for what I'm suggesting. Buy.
"One question you need ask yourself as an investor. Would Macys business and stock price have been affected like this if covid had never had happen?Would they have had to close all their stores and cut the dividend if not for covid?The answer is this is an anomaly or a brief unusual event that is temporary in nature and present an amazing opportunity to buy this stock at a price so cheaply that otherwise you would not be able to.This covid has made Macys future far brighter long term.Many of its competitors are gone They put their online business on steroids. The dividend soon will be restored as will their normal sales and earnings.Further, I see Macys becoming a growth company due to gaining market share and soon improved margins."
"Century 21 files for BK. Saks, Norsdstrom and Urban next. More pie for Macy's"
i will wait for 20$
"Not having been in Macy’s for quite a while, I went in yesterday to use an almost year old gift card. I was shocked to see the change in the store - the atmosphere wasn’t the same. This GA store did not seem to have the volume or quality of women’s name brand clothing I remember it having in the past. Thinking today about that and as an active investor I curiously looked at ‘M’ itoday including the comments and all I can say is good luck Macy’s."
I guess a strong balance sheet and real estate portfolio don’t matter to the market anymore. Market also doesn’t seem to give them credit for their e sales and growth. Market is short sighted. Money is made when others are fearful. This will be one of those stocks.
"RIP NORMANSKY RIP most people would call him a cancer, others a lost soul. a former Macy's stock boy that was fired for insubordination . Instead of going home and getting his gun and going back to Macys to kill some of his colleagues and then himself,he decided to devote much of his time bashing any post on the yahoo message board. We caught up with his former employer manager at Mc Donalds Sunjay Gupta and he said "" Normansky was employee in training and was assigned the cleaning of the restrooms. He did a fantastic job but one day an employee caught him writing om the wall 'please don't throw cigarettes in urinals, they get wet and are hard to light."" so we had to fire him. Gupta reach out Normansky after the firing at Macy's but Normansky decline, having already committed to Burger King . Will all miss his (ebonics/retardness/Canadian ) lingo and blanket negative statements on every post. I hear a call ""DEAD MAN WALKING"" . Normansky may God have mercy on your soul and with that can i get an A Dopey I mean an AMEN?"
"BlackRock and also Pershing Square just invested in Macy's...That's confidence and follow the money. I like to follow Carl Icahn too. Just saying, these are Top Traders as We all know."
"An obvious investment decision would be for me to buy shares in WMT and forget about M.Reasons to do so include:a) I spend thousands of dollars annually at Walmart. I spend nothing at Macy's.b) Walmart's annual revenues have increased from $476 billion in the FY ending January 2014 to $514 billion in FY ending January 2019. Macy's annual revenues have declined from $28.1 billion in 2014 to $24.97 billion in FY ending in February 2019c. Walmart's quarterly dividend has grown from $0.05 in 1974 to $0.51 with an increase every year. Macy's quarterly dividend has been stalled at $0.3775 since mid-2016.WMT is fairly valued and has remained so while the share price has increased. An investor might buy WMT and put the shares away for a decade with a reasonable expectation that the share price and dividend will continue to increase in proportion to steady increases in revenue. The possible attraction to M is that M has been beaten down, appropriately so, for its failure to deliver on increased sales and increased dividends. The question du jour is whether or not M can, or will, deliver on future results sufficient for the share price to increase by four or five times while the dividend yield drops back to an historic level of two or three percent even while annual increases in the dividend rate resume.Macy's is a cyclical recovery play."
Indexes going green! Strong buy Macy‘s now! Let‘s squeeze the shorts snd catch them by surprise!
Large short volume ratio last two days. Setting up for a nice short squeeze. Getting ready for lift off.
"This virus scare , which coupled with Bernie has been a great way to gather assets."
We could close above $18 tomorrow
Warren Buffett's most important message. It's been proven time and time again that long-term investing outperforms short-term investing. Just keep buying shares for the free dividend and long term. The price shouldn't matter if you are investing long term. Once again Macy's continues to improve and make the necessary positive changes.
M reached a new 52 Week High at 35.47
ZM is down 20% because COVID is ending..M to hit $40 next year.
$20.02 shorts are nervous
Amazon potentially buying Macy's...hold on to your Macy's shares!
Large Call option volume; highly doubtful this will close the week under $7.50Nomansky did the smart thing; sold his $7 Puts (at $0.05) while they still had some value.

(Chairman and CEO Jeff Gennette said in a news release)https://www.macysinc.com/investors/news-events/press-releases/detail/1630/macys-inc-announces-restructuring-to-address-sales"
Shorts win again. Margin call selloff at 2pm should be spectacular. No bottom in sight.
"The high quality of our real estate portfolio positioned us well to execute this offering. Additionally, the continued commitment from our bank group allowed us to more than double the size of our existing revolving credit facility. Together, the notes offering and asset-based credit agreement provide Macy’s, Inc. with approximately $4.5 billion of borrowings and commitments, giving us sufficient flexibility and liquidity to navigate our current environment and fund our business for the foreseeable future,” said Jeff Gennette"
"go and buy at Macy's stores, not at Amazon."
Becca Tilley partners with bar 111 and coming to Macy's. M going after the younger crowd.
"Amazon was wow cool buy from home, brick and mortar sat on their butts, then they awoke, now their i presence is maturing, it's time for revenge of the Brick n Click"
this is the only retail stock very under priced. will pop @ the Dividend Announcement look @ $jwn (you can also look @ $tgt)
"Anybody not understanding what is going on today based on great results by Dillard's please leave the markets, you have no business putting your money at risk."
"It's undervalued, it has great real estate, they should take it private, it's going up. All things they said at 30, and then they said them at 25, and then 21 and then 18 and then 15 bucks. Notice a pattern here? It's down worse than JC Penney's YTD, get over it. Macy's is going to do nothing as long as it has hack management that couldn't run a hotdog stand."
"Chance for $4.00 - $4.50 this year, less debt, more updated stores, gazillions in real estate, and a 4% div? Buy."
DB's pt raise to $9 will be bested by another analyst raise soon enough. Buy.
THE PARKING LOT WAS FULL SAT IN THE MACY'S LOT. NEVER SAW SO MANY CARS TRUE STORY.
Black Friday in July was another Huge win for Macy's..the deals where way better then Amazon could ever offer
Strong Buy !!!
Told you guys it would test support again at $15.57 and to sell while above $17.50. If it holds it's a good sign but earnings could break it for good
This buy is not just for profit but to support the fight against retail investors vs hedge funds!
"Trying to understand the bear case hear at these levels. I don’t believe Amazon is the end all be all here for retail. I believe the pendulum has swung too far. We are seeing this with cloud computing. Everyone thought Amazon AWS was the final destination for cloud. Now workloads are coming back to private cloud and a hybrid cloud approach is being adopted. I think the same can be said for retail. You will need online but also a physical presence. Macy’s seems late to the party but have been making progress. The fact that they can pay down debt, continue to invest, and pay a dividend says a lot. To top it off they have a real estate portfolio that’s more valuable than their retail business. I like their odds. Constructive arguments are welcome."
"What kind of valuation does one of the top ten largest internet retailers, which is growing online sales growth yoy over 10%, deserve? Apparently below tangible book value."
"Macy's is building the largest LARGE parcel logistic delivery operation in the US. They will soon be able to deliver to every location throughout the US, without using common carriers. This is good!"
NEXT STOP.... $18
Big short float about to feel squeezed
Macy's has been best return in my portfolio since April 2020
"3 days ago fast money reccomended this stock, on a whim I bought and made 10% in 3 days, sold today at 17.00. thanks fast money, I'll send you a check.if I make a quick profit like that, I sell, not greedy, if it goes higher so be it, I never chase the green, I buy on red days.gl"
"I went to the Clackamas Mall in Portland Saturday, Traffic was nuts, I got into the, the Mall and Macys Store to find people everywhere. I went back the next day shopping for Disney World Shoes. The Employee said they had the largest day in 6 months or longer on Saturday."
"The second half of May ‘19, corporate officers bought 20,000 shares in the open market @ $21.37 and up. That shows confidence."
5 separate news reports out over the weekend. Top 10 companies that may not survive the Virus.Maceys was on that list.
Lululemon has a Price/Sales figure of 12.5. Macy's Price/Sales is .19. (Lower numbers are better). Lululemon has a PE of 90 and a Market Cap of 49B. Macy's Market Cap is 3.5B and has historically had a PE of 10. There is definitely room for Macy's to run. One would think post-Covid Macy could be 14B Market Cap putting the stock price around $40.
Has anyone got any insight about when and if Macys are reinstating the dividend?I got a position at $6.21 and I get a bit nervous when an investment goes this well lolI lost a load on pier 1 so karma is straightening itself out :)
Earnings and dividend report tomorrow. The dividend yield is now 10%!
Yes I will tell you I've been following this for six months I've been buying it for the past 35 years living in New York City during Thanksgiving with the parade and Christmas and it always goes on yes retail got killed I have never seen Macy's in the past eight months go down more than $0.50 and usually recover I've never seen it go down this month this much without a recovery that freaked me out and earnings didn't even come out till the morning and nobody knows the earnings cuz it's against the law they did so bad last quarter I guarantee it's like playing Blackjack that the earnings going to be slightly tiny bit better because yes with the solo and Bloomingdale's amazing and whatever it's going to go up big wanted to point site that's big for Macy's I will just come right back to 16 hopefully 18 by Christmas but today's drop was that should be for tomorrow so whatever it is telling you it's going up in the morning after earnings never seen a drop so much today I no news just nervous news I live in Manhattan Macy's Bloomingdales are snow packed and it's so cheap anyway there's no way to go but out
I'm in...bought in at 22 last go around and doubled my money...will hold til December and do the same
Not sure. I am new to investing. Not sure if I should buy at 5.00 or wait
Lots of spam on this board!
"With futures down over 400, what’s your thoughts on this today? I’m long BTW"
"Apparel needs a brutal brutal winter. People have to go out and buy warm clothes and bedding, etc.. Macys is a classy place to shop with good deals too(especially with their card).There's lots of space around you too for distancing, etc.. - Pete"
Every retail company has closed stores covid made digital retail become stronger sooner. Its not not just macys layoffs and store closures are a good thing its called consolidation macys is up up and away.......
Back to the 20s. Time for more short shorts!!
I just hit the deck
here we go... 11 closing..
"Finally feeling good about this thing. Same thing happened last year, it dipped to 20 and recovered to high 30’s. Hate to break it to you, but retail is not dead yet."
Shorts should have covered earlier but they didn't want to cause a squeeze i guess. Greed will take over and the 44.5% short in this stock will be treading on each other to cover.
"I think everyone knows that I am a long here, but you got to admit when you know it will take some time to recover its past glory. When the departure of upper management personnel helps the stock, it is indicative of a bad management team. With that said they probably need to hire someone from another brick and mortar who has been successful in navigating the omni-channel sales approach as opposed to someone who didn't even have any merchandising background. If I recall correctly, eBay is strictly a bidding site for other people's stuff, sorry, but that was a dumb placement, not only do we need to get the right people on the bus, we need them in the right seats."
"The worst is over, I see a lot more traffic on street. We are on pandemic recover phase, the market is too. Since it is caused by disease which can recover by itself without treatment for most people, everything will be back to normal soon,"
Good news!
squeeze those shorts
"Macy’s is a compelling buy at this price. Their strategy will propel their stock price. Specifically, the reduction in mall locations and investing in digital, as well as increase in new smaller format “Market” stores and free standing Off Stage stores is a great story and reason for optimism. This along with current $25b in sales, it’s going to get to $30 in about 12 months or sooner, then to $50 and $70..."
If nobody wants it then its not undervalued.
"Friday option contract expiration had 14000 call contracts open at the 7 strike cap. Today just under half of those closed. The more of the close then clearing the way for M to drift higher into the weekend. After July monthly contract expire, August high open interest has 18000 open contracts on both the calls AND puts 10 strike. M could see a $10 pin on Aug 21."
"As we approach the ex-dividend date in September, can we get back to at least $16?"
"Macy‘s WILL survive! That‘s all you need to know........... back to normal, back to double-digits........ and every third share sold short => Hefty short-squeeze coming up! Let‘s all work together and propel this great American icon to double-digits........... whatever it takes!!!"
Shorts are back. Thanks guys I'm buying
HEADING BACK TO $17 PLUS
Free money will fill the malls. Buy.
"This is the time to buy, every time it gets around 5 it goes back up"
"The future will see far fewer brick and mortar competitors leaving all their sales for the survivors like Macysand KSS to share. With Macys taking the mid to higher end sales and KSS to take the mid to lower end sales.A win-win for Macys and KSS stock holders. Expect a return to paying down the debt, conservative management, dividend restoration and stock buybacks program returning and return to consistent annual profits.Most importantly, expect a return to annual growth in sales as all the dead retailers sales are up for grabs.Fewer competitors because it is very expensive to start a new brick and mortar store to compete, but anyone can open an online business with practically no money and compete with Amazon."
If you are wondering what's going on... it's quite simple - you have been had.
"Long Macy‘s! Whenthe parade hits and holiday spending starts this will be over 8 bucks. Money in the bank. For now shorts can hold it down. Although I think earnings later in the month will puck this back to $6,50-7,50 range..... building a base/ consolidating before going to double-digits with 775 stores open nationwide again."
"Hay breakman... did you and your short groupies read this. ?????on January 2, 2018, JPMorgan Chase raised the 12-month price target for Macy’s stock to $21 from $20. On the same day, Citigroup raised its price target for Macy’s stock to $20 from $16. On January 3, Deutsche Bank raised its price target to $27 from $22.Following Macy’s holiday sales report on January 4, Jefferies raised its price target for Macy’s to $22 from $20. UBS raised its price target for Macy’s stock to $26 from $21.Q: isn’t this the same Citigroup that said MACY’S WILL NO LONGER MAKES MONEY AS A RETAILER??"
Whoever buys Macy’s will make tons of money from assets.

CommentThe technical condition of the M is strong. The chart pattern suggests that upward momentum should continue and the stock is positioned for higher prices. The stock has outperformed the market over the last 50 trading days when compared to the S&P 500. MACD-LT, an intermediate-term trend indicator, is bullish at this time. Upside momentum, as measured by the 9-day RSI indicator is positive but is beginning to slow. Over the last 50 trading sessions, there has been more volume on up days than on down days indicating that M is under accumulation, which is a bullish condition. The stock is trading above a rising 50-day moving average. This validates the strong technical condition for M."
"Patience is a virtual in this world filled with impatient people wanting instant gratification.'Peter Lynch said his greatest gains were stocks he held for 3 to 4 years and built up positions in as they moved up! Enjoy the incredible capital gains and soon the restored dividends. Management is great give them time to make the stock holders rich!!Patience is a highly profitable virtue with this stock where over 33 percent of the shares are shorted.Shorts are slowly giving in to the inevitable move upward! As usual these gloomy, sky is falling chickens will hold onto their positions even as the stock doubles and doubles again until the suddenly capitulate.You want to be long when that happens!"
Macy's should climb back to $15+...people are ready to get out and spend and with all the stimulus there should be plenty of that going on.Long and strong 5000 shares.
I think after restructuring macys will survive just like target did few years back.
Performance=Down Pattern=Bearish Rating=Sell
Barrons is suggesting Amazon buy MACY’S.
Macy will be $100. because it is cleaned up and becomes a growth company.
"It's paying a 13% return...crazy. We should treat it as a saving account if it continues to pay the dividend. The current market cap is $3.1B. In 2016, Macy's real estate was worth $16 billion. Today they valued at $10.5B. That's 3 times their current market cap. This stock can still go up to as high as $30 in the coming future."
$50 my PT on 6/15/19.
Boy the shorts are on this board strong today. Must know they are in for a hurting and want to suede the crowds
Half price sale of Macys stock ending soon! A word to the wise!Snooze you lose!
NOT SELLING!
"Wow what a day for trading! The Dow 30 up 339. M up early almost $1 now closes at -$.18, with 26 million volume. Somebody explain what happened today (profit takers maybe?), as M is still under valued. Must be the tax bill, cryptocurrancy, or the tax bill. Still M will hit $25 by next week and possible $30 by January.All you shorts, shorting this stock will get your assets burned. Have a lump of coal in your Christmas stockings.As you can tell I am not pleased with today's activity.Here's to a better day of trading coming, do well long investors."
Just bought 500 shares. Easy
CEO was confident and open with the progress so far. If something is wrong - ceo wouldn’t come on CNBC and other tv stations. He has lot of hope.
AMAZON ....price target for MACY's BUY = $26

"Looks like $21.1 is a point of resistance. If it breaks through this today then, $22.30 and above is confirmed"
Macy’s (M) Raised to “Buy” at Zacks Investment Research
Wow. Hope this holds.
"Nearly 30% of the trading volume this past Friday was short selling. Do you see this huge spike in short selling too? It's becoming very clear that the short sellers are winning this battle right now, but if we get some good news maybe we can get a squeeze going. Has to start becoming a crowded trade at some point."
Everyone is waiting for M to hit single digits even when their debt we t from 7.5B to 4.1B the last 3-4 years. M is still paying a dividend and earning hundreds of millions per year. Closing of these 125 stores with a savings of 1.5B a year definitely would not hurt considering they only accounted for 5.6% of sales. I don't know whether or not it will hit signle digits but I'm pretty confident someone is eyeing a big move on M with a 3.8B marketcap. I mean forget fundamentals for a sec and use logic. If M went to 9 its market cap would be 2.7B which means 1 year of dividend would buyback bout 18% of the shares and save it about 85M a year in future dividend payouts. What would that do to EPS going forward if earnings are projected to stay around current levels for the next few years.
"Fitch Affirms Macy's, Inc. at 'BBB'; Outlook Revised to Stable(MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones NewswiresApril 19, 2019 11:53 ET (15:53 GMT)Press Release: Fitch Affirms Macy's, Inc. at 'BBB'; Outlook Revised to StableThe following is a press release from Fitch Ratings:Fitch Ratings-New York-19 April 2019: Fitch Ratings has affirmed the Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) on Macy's, Inc. and Macy's Retail Holdings, Inc. at 'BBB' and the Short-Term IDR at 'F2'. The Rating Outlook has been revised to Stable from Negative. A full list of ratings is provided at the end of this release.The Outlook revision to Stable reflects Fitch's continued expectation that Macy's can sustain flat to modestly positive comparable store sales (comps) and stabilize annual EBITDA in the $2.5 billion range, similar to the $2.6 billion reported in 2018 which was in line with Fitch's expectation. The company has paid down over $2 billion in debt over the last two years, ending 2018 with adjusted debt/EBITDAR (capitalizing rent at 8x) of 2.6x modestly better than expectation. Macy's has committed to using 2019 FCF towards debt reduction and leverage could improve modestly by 0.1x-0.2x over the next 12-24 months."
I love the real estate and the 10% Divi's. A surprise earnings would be gravy!
Macy's Shares are cheap with a Juicy Dividend going into the Holidays!!! :-)
"Macy sells a range of merchandise, including apparel and accessories for men, women, and kids; cosmetics; home furnishings; and other consumer goods.

"I love shopping at Macy’s for the last 30 years. I was there 2 days ago, and it was almost as busy as before pandemic."
I have to laugh at the overvalued comments on Macy's..trading at 8 times earnings with a dividend yield over 5% with very low enterprise value/EBITA and real estate that is worth more then the market cap..oh yeah throw in that May's management isn't sitting waiting to diw they have made numurous strategic moves to boost business and are all working..
"This is a $20 stock. No dividend, growing e-commerce segment, back-to-normal life around the corner. Just perfect."
AMAZON BUYOUT COMING VERY SOON!!!!!!https://finance.yahoo.com/news/case-amazon-acquiring-macys-very-192007655.html
M is making a chart drop. It should bottom right around here then go for a new high
24.19 is 200 day. Break it !
"And it's whispered that soon, if we all call the tune,Then the pumper will lead us to the hereafter.And a new day will dawn for those who stand long,And the short shares will echo with laughter."
I have a question for you guys What’s the quarterly dividend Macy’s pay for the shareholders
BUY BUY BUY!!! HEADED BACK TO $8.50
Hopefully Carl Icahn steps in and forces a sale
"The recent $500 million bond sale, which M gets approximately $470 million after fees and charges will give it 12 to 18 months wiggle room to sell more real estate to stay relevant. If they have another year like 2020, they're bankrupt. I owned and shorted K Mart, Sears, JC Penney and Bradlees, so know the tell-tale signs. Employees getting paid too much but buy their own companies stock. CEO' that make $2 or $3 million but $5 to $12 million after bonus' and stock compensation. Re-shuffling top management. When top management leave within 1 year they have sold all their shares. When Wall Street has a 1000 point down day M will be down 3 to 4 dollars. Tick tock the time is here with Joe B. raising corporate taxes."

Go shop there! Macy is dead! Stimulus can’t resuscitate malls
"up from here boys and girls! hope you covered shorts! bottom is now in and it's green from here, just look at the past, it's all you need to know!"
"I guess if the market disagrees people will buy. Just makes me sick how the market can be manipulated sometimes. Nothing changed from yesterday in terms of actual company performance. If anything, positive news on clothing sales being up last month and somewhat easing trade tensions."
"If today wasn't triple witching day we'd be way above $20. Next week then, when MM are done"
close above $12.50!!!!
Macy‘s could tap government funds/loans/programs... very interesting and good news:https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/30/macys-ceo-jeff-gennette-says-the-department-store-chain-will-survive.html
Waited all through the noise yesterday and this morning to get my $15 Puts right now for ER. Options pricing in 5% ER move when last 3 consecutively have been -15-20%. I’ll take that risk/reward any day on a stock with debt downgraded to junk that’s been on a harrowing downtrend for 18 months.

What the street doesn't get is that the 20 cent reduction in the annual eps estimate could be made up in a flash. Buy.
"Do not panicMacy’s is the last man standing, in a short time it wouldn’t have much competition, The analyst from ubs is part of the short conglomerate, he simply want to trash the stock,Brands did extremely poorly by their own, marketing is a huge expense that those brands can’t carry, than there are operating expenses such as shipping, returns,and others.No brands want to operate by their own"
BUY OUT RUMOR....AMAZON!!!!!
"M's longs should be focused on potential catalysts, one of which is Brexit. Key vote in EU today that will probably extend deadline 3 months. Then UK parliament will get to work to see if they can finally agree. There are good prospects for a reasonably quick settlement and this can kick start a year end rally. M should do well if the market goes into rally mode.Other catalysts include a trade deal with China which can take some pressure off the risk that costs of goods will rise. Trump needs to get some wins to fight the impeachment problem, and I expect he will sign a phase 1 deal, another market catalyst that can help M, and all retailers.The Fed will meet soon and the odds on bet is they will further drop the interest rates another quarter point. This may be built in largely but it still will help and re-assure the markets. Another, even bigger QE factor is the FED is enlarging its bond holdings. Estimates this can have a large QE effect for the next several months as FED is adding $60B/month.The impeachment issues also are a drag on the market because they create uncertainty. As this political matter progresses, the Republicans probably will side with Trump and it will become clear that the impeachment will not succeed in removing Trump from office. Whatever you think of Trump, that still will remove some uncertainty and allow the market rally to move forward.In addition to the broad forces that will work in Ms favor, you cannot deny that M's has been sold hard for 1 year. The problem is whether you think it is oversold or not. This is pretty clear, IMO, but the shorts of course will argue the other side. One thing that is hard to understand is why the shorts will take the position M's multiple programs to ramp sales, earnings, margins and free cash flow are all going to fail in the face of a potentially good year end selling season. They have the argument that it is a shortened selling period, but that is very weak. The consumer is well employed and in a good position. If the other catalysts mentioned above strike a favorable tone, the consumer will also have the rising market to comfort and help the buying season.We already have seen that TGT, COST, WMT, HD and AMZN can achieve great sales gains. The idea that M, JWM, KSS, and other large, well capitalized department stores cannot figure out the formulas to do the same is bunk.Anyone that studies the initiatives M's has put in place should be encouraged and betting on them to achieve some or all their goals which can translate into a very big turn around in sales, earnings, margins and free cash flow. M's has a genuine chance to be a super performer from these low PPS numbers if it puts together a few quarters showing the market some success. The catalysts are in place for a big change in sentiment on Ms. No one can say how much they will succeed, but the chances are excellent and the risk here is low, IMO. Please do your own due diligence, and whatever you do, ignore the short seller that spue only FUD, as they don't have your best interest. They are trying to raise arguments that cause fear, but as JFK once said, elegantly ""the only thing we have to fear is fear itself"" and this may be an appropriate thing to keep in mind with M if you think it is way oversold."
"At least Cramer didn’t say Macy’s is “hopeless” at this point but instead gave several “hopeful” suggestions. Being a leader in providing more unique user experience, convenience and investing more advance technology to the business were the major suggestions which might work."

California is open along with other states. Macy’s will obviously sell more and increase their revenues. CEO said he will keep payroll lean. Good for the stock price.It may take some quarters to stabilize. Buying at this price is a bargain. Zoom to $16 if good numbers come out of California in 2 weeks.
"Is it good news? closing stores means less revenue but better performance on the remaining ones. They benefit both ways more profitability but most of all much less risk since a big burden of fixed costs is out. How this benefits the stock. Simple less risk means better multiple on earnings. Less stores + focusing on online sales is a good move for future survival. They do the best thing since many big companies spend till they bankrupt to not lose market share, instead the right way is to shrink and focus on efficiency and return value to existing shareholders. I think Macys can be a turn around story."

"The rumor is that Macy's had $8 Billion in total sales in 3 days, starting on Black Friday, with limited discounts on high ticket items! And that would indicate management's eagerness to announce a debt payback yesterday!"
Do not sell or put sell orders at 100Will be a massive squeeze.They should and will raise money soon

Dont understand todays price drop? Same drop on TuesdayAny one care to suggest a why?Only good is todays drop only half of last Tuesday
I just want to point out that Kohs Q4 earnings report was not much better than Macy's yet their shares are up.
"Macy's Keeps Quarterly Dividend Steady at $0.3775 per Share, Pay Date Oct. 1, Record Date Sept. 13"
Funny reading the clearly emotionally biased posts trying to justify why they are holding onto the next JCP (this is going under $1 in next 5yrs).
16.97 resistance. 16.88 support. If it breaks either. Will be explosive
I was wanting to buy this stock at 7 dollars but was turned away after reading the bearish comments and now look she’s over 20. I really need to stay off here and go with my gut. Bears are idiots on here
M shareholders standing outside a bank selling $20 bills for $15. ok25% discount to Book. okIf they closed the business tomorrow every shareholder gets a check for $20.44 per share.
"Macy's is going to come out of this covid-19 mess, just like they came out of the 2008 great financial crisis. Just look at the chart on yahoo at Max, history is going to repeat itself. Good luck to all Longs"
Macy's stock is a wonderful Christmas gift to buy myself. I can't wait for Q4 results.. I will keep buying at this point.
Just the beginning baby of a long term move up back to fair market valuation.
Right now shorties be like
Anyone want to guess MACY’S stock price on Thursday?
Macys should get a liquor license and open up a bar in some locations I remember going to a sacks in rodeo dr and it had a fancy bar up top
I like M. I don't like it without dividends.But I think it will survive.
Chart comparison- DDS vs M. See anything similar?
Macy‘s is taking all necessary precautions in order to reopen and restart the economy:https://www.macys.com/social/covid-19/Go M go!
Macy’s is up 4.6% in premarket (16.61$)
pretty sure a few months ago Cramer was talking how cheap Macy's stock was and he'd recommend buying it
"retail sales rebound in January, this rebound sure be long-term, at least 4years , so it's time to buy high ranking retailers Macy's, Macy's sales sure be very good in this year, target $48 per share in 12months, $125 per share in 3years, retail sales growth sure be turning into high ranking retailers Macy's growth, it's the trending, M worth $36 per share now."
4-5 days in red and then this cherry will pop.
"I got into this trade due to its financial metrics and management continues to disappoint me over and over. It’s hard to believe it could get any cheaper on a relative valuation front so I don’t want to sell here, but Genette has lost all my confidence."
"Shopping at bricks and mortar store, especially for clothing, is preferable to women. They get their steps in, they can try on clothes, they can “window shop“ and dream. I love it. People will be all over the malls once the pandemic is managed. Imagine a man just buying everything from Home Depot online without being able to go there and actually examine and compare. I love shopping in the malls. I get my steps in and cruise to see what’s on sale. Love it."
All I know about Macy's is ladies love it and I'm a bag holder. Awesome!
"Daily covid cases were 400,000 plus in jan but as of today only 139,000.Essentially flu cases nonexistent in usa. Better is bullish"
Guys be glad for this dip. It will bounce back up.
"Liar shorts, Macy's has $2.553 billion in shareholders equity, $1.68 billion in cash, Q4 EPS of $0.5, and 2021 revenue guidance of $19.75 billion to $20.75 billion. Admit it, you thought M was going to be easy money shorting it like other big retailers that have gone under, and like so many oil companies drowning in debt, but you were wrong, big time! You are going to pay dearly for your mistake shorting Macy's. Oh, well, live and learn, shorts, you can't win them all. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/macy-inc-reports-fourth-quarter-115500431.html"
They are releasing earnings BEFORE the market opens. Always a good sign.
"It is a good morning for M, up 2.5% and should hit $21 today and may close above that.The Holidays are here and people are buying.Shorts will not be having a happy holiday this year. Yes shorts have been naughty."
Serious question. How can M survive?
Short squeeze coming soon to theater near you. Enjoy!

I told my relatives not to give me anything from Macy's. I do not want to drive to the mall to return ti.
"If the only thing going for Macy's is that people have spent money on their homes this year, then what will happen to their guidance now that people will be spending on eating out, vacations, etc?If a trend is a benefit then once that trend ends, it can be a negative."
I would rather be short Amazon than short Macy's. The trolls are shook and the climb to $10/share starts today!!!

"Macy's sell top of the line great products. I'm expecting things to turn around for them and the stock to rebound over the long term. Besides, I shop there pretty much."

"Market is super green, all other stocks up.....except Macy's. Premarket movement for this stock is nonexistent. Yup! back down to $12 it is."

Macy's is having a storewide bag sale!
"I was bullish a year ago and took a minor loss on this stock, but there is literally nothing to like about this company anymore. The real estate likely isn’t worth what the balance sheet says given the epidemic."
Short position in Macys dropping! Was 120 million and recently down to 50 million. Still huge but even these die hard gloomy sky is falling people are facing reality.The trend for this stock is up all year!!! Expect more panic short covering in 20s and finally most will be covered by 30s!!
6-month high! who lit a rocket under this today???
I walked in a store today the store looks 10x better. Lots of Spring items and more space and really clean. I see us at 24 really soon.

facts about macy'sbiggest department store one of the top 10 e-commerce in the usa one of the heaviest shorted stocks in the market.
God help the shorters if those kids from Reddit get an itch for Macys.
"A couple of things to remember: Macy's has a plan to reduce expenses by $2B annual by 2023. About $400M in 2020, about $1B in 2021, about $1.5B in 2022. These savings will go straight to the bottom line.ALSOFood for thought....Macy's is CURRENTLY the 9th largest e-commerce company in the USA. The other top 10 players ALL have at least a $20B market cap. Macy's MC is less than $5B. They will start making roads into this with stock price steadily increasing over time!"
"I guess $14 was the bottom judging from all the recent influx of articles, etc. coming out. If the consumer is as strong as everyone is saying, the holiday season should bode much better for M."
@ironman sold my 10k shares $14k profit Oh by the way .. it’s called “trading” Drinks on me off to enjoy the early start to my holiday weekend in Miami Beach

The vaccine distribution being paused will make the retail sector drop substantially as well. It will cause a Bull trend for some time. This will also mean the next earnings will be missed. Not a good time to hold stocks long.
MMs are going to manipulate this to keep under 15 before option expiration. Buy those shares we saw the bottom with the ER. This isn't dead it's transforming.
"January's pre-announcement turns out to be bogosity lol. Co. matched estimates lol. Go ahead, tell me we're not going to retrace to $30 in short order."
macys can go nowhere but up even with the fake news trying to say they have sloppy stores.fakenews
"Despite positive sales trends, roughly stable profitability, and a massive trove of real estate, the company's shares continue to trade for just seven times forward earnings. That makes the stock a great bargain, particularly if Macy's will soon be ready to start returning more cash to shareholders.Just keep it steady..and indefinite."
15.09 buyers will rush in the morning to sell for 13.50...hehehehehehe
Shorts are hurting but not at the point to cut their losses yet.Will happen soon.Shorts are losing more and more real money with the prospects of UNLIMITED losses!Wait until Macys hits $25 again!Wow will they be crying and wishing they had returned the shares!
Stock chart looks like Ron Jeremy waking up with HUGE wood
$16.30 is a true breakout trend for Macy's. Next stop is about $18.50
"Macys will get benefits from other retails sinking... buy for the long term, you will get 500% return soon.."
Macys is now green! Trading after earnings just like KSS. These stocks are twins!
"Wow the shorts must be worried to see how the funds and analysts will react to this, never seen this much activity from the never Macy's crowd this early. I still think this will be received well by the people who control the stock market and like someone else said at the end of the day that is all that matters."
For sales to really go up the US needs inflation or population growth. neither is happening. Almost 6 dividend looks very nice..
"Just like BA. (as Jim Cramer put it) M earning will look really fantastic in 2021 when compared to 2020,$100 is possible."
"Today I covered my weekly Puts today, I collected a total of $21,252. I want to thank all the shorts for this weekly profit, the tax man will appreciate it as well. Maybe you can start shorting more for next week, I'm already making money on my 5 strike price as well as my 5.50 strike price. Another great week visiting Macy's casino..."
The Peter Lynch chart suggests the stock is cheap.
"Macy's, Kohls and Nordstroms all should be working on going private. Very difficult for retailers to put numbers up every quarter with the pressure of analysts and stock prices. M with real estate and free cash flow would be an easy ""go private"" deal with just not having to pay dividend which would save $450 million a year"
Tomorrow Macy’s will beat
"M is not in a worst position then last month, not even from last week. Sales are improving and the market is going up. M will only ride the market up after everybody realizes this stock has a lot of potential"
"$5,30 and definitely wanting to go MUCH higher! Bottom is in. Up from here. Make it a very long uptrend......... spiced with some hefty intra-short-squeezes.............. whatever it takes............ make (very numerous) shorts cover........... they deserve to lose it all............."
Bought some puts 2 weeks out at the high of the day. Stop loss if it reaches 35.7 today.
"m can reach$36 per share,because clothes sales looks rebound in September,this winter clothes sales will very strong,"
Deutsche Bank just raised M price target from $27 to $28! That makes sense!
Macy’s is a ￼ financially strong company. I don’t get the panic selling. I took this opportunity to actually buy more and to hold.
"I must admit part of me is cheering for a buy out of Macy's just to see the mafia like short sellers get absolutely hammered. Half of the Macy's float is sold short, please stick it to them Amazon. I will order Ralph Lauren through Macy's on the Amazon site forever if you do that. Lol"
I don't understand how you all think Macys is going 15-20 dollars. They were on bad shape before COVID. Look at JC Penney. Macy's is going down the same path.
I'm in. The potential is just too great to ignore with Macys
So John Harper's COO position has been eliminated. He makes $1.5 million a year before bonus'. I wonder what the real story is?
Dividends
"You shorts are in big, big trouble.Lots of financial pain is awaiting you in the future if you persist in younegativity with regard to this wonderful Macys corporation.I a new long investor who bought in at the March low prices.No one is getting my shares at this insanely ridiculously low prices.I wouldn't even consider selling for less than $39/share some of my long position.This is a long term multi-year position in my highly diversified portfolio.I fully expect more than a 700 percent return on this one investment alone.See you all at $100/share and near term back to the $20s/share.Love Macys, its management and shop there often.This is how I became a millionaire."
"Has anyone read one of the greatest most popular books on investing called ""Peter Lynch: Beating the Street"". If you did, you would have read his advise gained from decades of beating the market.Peter Lynch says "" The key to making money in stocks is not to get scared out of them. This point cannot be overemphasized. Every year finds a spate of books on how to pick stocks or find the winning mutual fund. But all the good information is useless without the willpower. In dieting and in stocks, it is the gut and NOT the head that determines the results."" This quotation from the beginning of chapter two ""The Weekend Worrier.""Here you have the words of Peter Lynch himself, one of the most successful investors of all times telling you that when you get a great bargain like Macys stock sold at bargain prices during a covid scare, to succeed all you have to do is relax, be unafraid and hold and watch the inevitable happen as it rises to precovid prices.This is a golden opportunity to what every $7 invested in KSS become $30 plus in 6 to 18 months.Ignore the short sellers who post nonsense trying to scare you away and enlarge your position as the opportunity arises.Buy Macys stock and enjoy getting richer. Soon covid will be past history as will this golden opportunity."
Suddenly Macy’s decides to follow the market.
"U.S. retail sales rebounded in October, but consumers cut back on purchases of big-ticket household items and clothing, which could temper expectations for a strong holiday shopping season.Ooops"
"Sorry, had to break. The shorts are making a bad move. There is no negative news on Macy’s and we should see a bounce. Add to it being safe with dividend and little downside issues. Perfect line on the Chart"
Sell on the news. We end the day in the red. More empty promises and losses hidden in the GAAP and EBITDA.
"Macy's can continue rise to new high, because only high ranking things and vehicles have more room to growth, others have picked, so DJIA s&p and nasdaq won't rise at least 2years, so Fed will not rise rate at least 2years,"
The good news and excellent year/year comparisons and shorts will push this stock well into the 30s. A word to the wise!
"Would be great if they announce Dividend again during earnings. Last check they didn't have to tap into the secured loans they got so, stock buy back and Dividend should be something proposed."
"In other results, Macy’s diluted earnings per share of $0.32 and adjusted diluted EPS of 39 cents in the latest quarter compared to 44 cents for diluted and adjusted diluted EPS in first quarter 2019.Excluding asset sale gains, adjusted diluted EPS for the quarter exceeded first-quarter 2019 by 4 cents."
"cheap stock, got even more valuable after earnings if they do have 3.5 EPS for the year this should be a minimum $35-40 stock with 10 to 12 multiple."
Hold for 2 years for over 100% return
Christmas is right around the corner and Macy's will be fine! Enjoy those juicy dividend!
"It's fine, a nice guy called Robert urged you that yesterday was the bottom and to buy"
Book value is over $20 per share so it sure seems like a buy at 5 $ even w/o the dividend.
"bought some macys before the pandemic mainly for the dividend and because i persoanlly like shopping at macys. have just recently broke even and am considering selling, think there are just better places to put the money than macys."
Obv it was coming down went up 50 percent in 2 days what did u guys think ride it from 5.28 to 7.49 then shorted at 7.60. 18 k shares
I really don’t get what this stock still playing under $20 despite the great ER report ..makes no sense to me ...
"So, I was thinking about what Ark did earlier and so I got in my car. I went t o all the DFW Macy's stores and guess what NO PARKING now keep in mind this is Thursday. I did not get discouraged so I headed out to Houston.....guess what?? That's right NO PARKING. I could not believe it I saw a guy standing by the street and asked him is it always this busy.. he replied 24 hours a day.So I moved on to Austin, San Antonio and went back to DFW and Houston nothing NO PARKING.So, I was dispondent sitting in the empty PARKING LOT of Sesrs and a little old man walk up to me and said Hi I'm Warren Buffett do you need a parking space at Macy's? I responded almost choking up in tears yes ...yes Mr Buffett. He responded I'll give you mine if you take a short survey about Macy's and also sigh up for a Macy's star rewards credit card?I said yes ,but I told him I had bad credit..Mr Buffett said it doesn't matter I just need to sign up one more to fill my card.The moral of the story...I helped a little rich billionaire old man who has nothing better to do."
"Tips to day traders: Typically down till noon EST, Rebound and finishes with Green!"
Kohl's fashion and brands doesn't even compare even remotely close to Macy's/Bloomingdales...Macy's/Bloomingdales far surperior
I am happy for LB shareholders.. it had been painful years...But hey.. someday clothing stocks will be more valuable than restraunt stock.. or retailer.. come and go...
jumped on another 3K @ $14.20...Didnt even blink when they dropped below $14....$20 is coming close..MORE UPGRADES coming the next few days..grab it now before it hits $17 in a few days!!!
Macy's is having a bag sale today!
"Most likely down today because of the jobs report showing decline in retail jobs. However, the jobs report may be missing some retail job growth in areas like distribution centers which are reported in the warehouse industry category. Still lots of brick and mortar closing so overall numbers will look bad. Macy’s should be one of the companies that survives. This one should reward longs at some point but it will take an earnings forecast catalyst on the next call or a little bit more time before people realize how undervalued this stock is and a shift back to value / dividend stocks and away from overpriced IPOs."
gains coming next week. get in position
"Now that M has broken through resistance at $16, it is possible it will run toward the upside gap, which it will fill in due course, IMO. If the deal with China gets signed, that should be good for another buck or two for retail stocks like M because there was some concern that upcoming rises in tariffs might force Ms to raise some prices. It will be very nice to see that phase 1 deal close and some sort of hiatus on tariffs. Go Macy!!I was telling shorts to cover yesterday, but expected only some smart ones to cover at $16.50. Some more will cover at $17.50 IMO. That could happen tomorrow if this current rally has legs. Shorts have to pay the dividends while they are giving back some profits. Some shorts are still pushing on a string and keep selling more short, but that is not a good I idea when the Market is in the year end season and making new all time highs. Some shorts are smart, but if they have not covered yet, that would mean they are setting themselves up for more losses."
$20 today or tomorrow ? Place your bets.
Wait until they announce stimulus check this will fly to $20 in no time
Someone attempted to short at the beginning. LOLThat was a buying opportunity.
Downtown Chicago Macy's just got cleaned out last night by looters
Macy’s would be better off buying its own shares than retiring debt.
Words of Wisdom.....JUST HOLDMacy's is now on AMAZON target list. I'm thinking $24 - $26 NICE!!!!!
2 hours ago — Macy's is a top contender for a potential Amazon acquisition. ...

Board Declares Quarterly DividendClick here to read the full articleIf you have any questions, or would like to contact Investor Relations, please reply to this email.Macy's, Inc.7 West Seventh Street, Cincinnati, OH 45202 United States of Americahttps://www.macysinc.comTo change your subscription preferences, please click here"
"Sold Couple a Put-Options up 1600%, got plenty-a Spares, this is like Cracking-open Fortune-Cookiez fulla $1500-Dolla-Bills, YEE HAA! lol"
"The early dividend announcement was a smart thing for the board to do. It is going to be hard for the shorts to see the dividend harvesters drive the PPS up, knowing that more shorting the PPS dow1n will only bring more dividend hunters, lol. Shorts are in a ""no win"" box because, now the PPS goes up plus the pay the dividend. The short can race to cover or not, but the last to cover pays the most. Shorting now just does not pay, or make sense. The dividend is in, and the PPS obviously is way too low, plus a year end rally will lift all boats. Just imagine what happens to the shorts if M beats expectations, for example, like TSLA just did, LOL. Credit Suisse made a garbage analysis based on a shortened holiday sales season and weather prediction, with no consideration to the fact that M already completed it's 150 store improvement, so those capx expenses are coming down, it intends to pay down debt, so those interest costs are coming down, and Macy's has a technology plan to increase productivity and save another $400 to $500 Million. Not one word about those savings hitting the bottom line; and, CS failed to even comment on whether Ms other initiaves will grow sales. CS is betting on a bad Xmas sales season, which frankly, is dead wrong. What are the shorts going to do when sales turn up and costs turn down in a year end rally with the M dividend looking like a great chance to get yield from a under priced dividend aristocrat that has not missed a dividend payment since 2002. And, what will the shorts do when Macy's board goes after them with a stock buy back program. Shorts are screwed and the smart ones are already boxed, or covering. Love that dividend announc6!!"
"Fair to say someone has a large buy order in between $16 and $16.10. Every downtrend is either started or accelerated with a weekly volume around 80M, each uptrend has started on weekly volume of 110M shares. This is too cheap and it's time to start accumulating. Reduce your holdings each week there's 80M or more in volume. It's the same funds buying and selling this over and over again"
M should test $22.10 again soon after this great interview. If it does it is poised to reach the $22.30 range again.
"nice triple top, careful"
I just can't figure out the logic behind the decision of management to forgo releasing the Christmas sales numbers at the beginning of January. Is management afraid of giving shareholders greater clarity on their performance?
Macy's purportedly has the cash to pay down the debt and re-purchase their stock thanks to the corporate tax break in this calendar year.
it will be $16 end of next week
"Again, like 10 days ago we have a strong resistance at $17.35. I sold some at this price. We may go back to $15.60"
Blowout earnings..return to profitability plus upcoming stimulus money  Good place to be
Is dividends safe?
loaded up more shares at 11.30. this baby is going up up up. strong sales and tight inventory = record q4
Some data I read into suggests that some institution are repackaging shares of Macy's into allocated funds.Anyone knows the reason?
How interesting is it that MaxPain for options tomorrow is $17Well played Wall Street
"Guys and Gals, Baron's about face is a typical game played by shorts, if you recall Carlos at the beginning was coming out as a novice asking ""legitimate"" questions about the company. The bigger the talk, the bigger the potential short. Baron rarely offered in-depth analysis or discussion, he made very vague comments but nothing that someone with a bit too much time on their plate could offer. It is always better to know. As I said prior, trade deal makes this go up fast, as the whole retail sector will climb. Even the big names that Wall Street loves have not performed well, Children's Place, Ulta, Lulu, yet many that Wall Street hates have performed well, Signet, Dillard's and Nordstrom's. At the end of the day, with or without Baron we will be just fine. And where else can you get the entertainment value that the Gnome offers us??"
"Morningstar’s take on Macy’s is weird. They rip it apart in the writing, but give it five stars."
"The short interest also worries me. People think a large short interest ratio is good ... wrong. People that professionally short stocks, especially ones where as a short they pay a substantial dividend, they usually have done substantial due diligence. That also concerns me. And to stay short at close to a 52 week, the night before earnings. That’s not good."
Looking Like:SHORT SQUEEZE!!!!!!!!!
"Ca-ching, hear the cash registers ring, at Macy’s!"
"Profit Margin (TTM)-21.79% Revenue Growth not good at all, PE n/a..10 Year Book Value Growth-8.04% Not so good as you think."
This stock is finally breaking out. Now we will make some serious money . Time to eat.
I am pretty sure that all the long term shareholders would love to see M management shock the shorts by putting out the dividend announcement early and the ex date like tomorrow. Good old shock and awe the shorts.
This is hilarious....trying to bring this thing back from the dead....It's done for! Sorry for the false hope!
If you liquidated Macy's assets valued at $19BN and divided this by outstanding shares of 309M that gives you $61.48 per share.
"Retail Stocks That Could Burn Short SellersBy Forbes.. Schaeffer's Investment ResearchSchaeffer's Investment Research, ContributorThe retail sector has found new life going into the 2017 holiday season, helped in part by headlines about record-breaking spending. Take for example the SPDR S&P Retail ETF, which has jumped almost 15% over the past six months. This recent surge could be catching a number of traders off guard, given the elevated short-interest levels seen on a handful of notable retailers, including Macy's, Dillard's, and Nordstrom.Macy's stock bottomed at $17.41 on Nov. 7, a seven-year low. But the shares have bounced back nicely, last seen trading at $25.36, taking back the 200-day moving average in the process. The price action may be partly why the security saw a price-target hike from Susquehanna to $25 from $20 on Tuesday. Still, 10 of 13 analysts recommend just holding or even selling the retailer.Elsewhere, short interest has exploded on the stock, with 70 million shares held by short sellers -- or 23% of the total float -- the most in at least 15 years. Going by M's average daily trading volumes, it would take these bears almost a week to cover their positions.As for Dillard's, the stock was last seen trading at $60.74, as it also enjoys support from the 200-day moving average. The shares have carved out a series of higher lows in recent weeks, and Susquehanna expects the trend to continue. The brokerage firm just raised its price target to $62 from $58.Short interest is elevated on DDS, too. In fact, more than two weeks' worth of buying power is dedicated to short interest, based on average daily volumes. An extended push higher could prompt some of these bears two weeks to cover.Finally, Nordstrom stock has rallied over 23% since its November low, last seen trading at $46.54. Susquehanna just upped its price target to $49 from $43, too, predicting the shares to push through recent resistance in the $48 region.Short sellers are hoping this prediction is wrong, since they control 17.6% of JWN's float. Based on average daily volumes, it would take them more than seven sessions to cover their positions."
Macy's is so much built into America. From the Christmas and News Years Parades to just saying let's go to Macy's in Huntington Beach California.
February 5 Investor Day predictions1. Closing 25 non-performing neighborhood stores (Band C) malls2. Cut dividend to $1.00 share3. Reinstate Share Buybacks at $300 million a year4. Proceed Joint Venture to build 1 million sq.ft. office tower at Herald Square
Oh to be young and short Macy's.One out of two isn't bad.
"expects $3.75, trading at 32.8 in premarket3.75/32.8 = 11.4% returnI know nothing about M, except they closed a lot of stores. That's a very high return. Their debt looks OK too. I might get price targets raised to $60 with justification. Seriously, $40 seems reasonable.eDon't take my word for it.I did say, I know nothing about M."
hope it will go to single digits soon.I just keep buying all the way down.will see you all shorty's later in year :)
"The board of directors of Macy's, Inc. (NYSE:M) today declared a regular quarterly dividend of 37.75 cents per share on Macy's, Inc.’s common stock, payable April 1, 2020, to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 13, 2020.You can but tomorrow and get the dividend."
"I'm assuming people got some cold feet after getting news of the Chief Technology officer. I personally don't find it bad and strongly believe "" M "" is still on track."
"The problem with Macy's is that underlying assets are a gold platter in front of management, the story can be improved in so many ways unlike other businesses ..while the management lacks the competency to make a strong decision, a classic situation that calls for activist investor or a private bid."
"This board is getting boring. I guess it'll be this way until next earnings or they announce a sale of a M property. Cannibalizing assets, borrowing money to produce EBITDA profits, closing stores to save money and turning digital are the answer. M pays $28,000,000 a quarter to service their debt."
"Come on baby, that $21.10 high seems to be a line in the sand, BREAK IT!"
Shorts are trying to create panic selling. They dumped on the open. If Macy's finishes green today they will start covering en masse. News is coming and one news announcement buries them. Around 40% of the float is sold short. That is immense exposure. Especially with buyout rumors and Amazon the suitor with $27 billion in cash which will represent a tax liability as high as the buyout price of Macy's if they do not do something with it before year end. A price of $10 billion for Macy's is being bantered around which would indicate an above $24 per share acquisition cost. Shorts and naysayers have fun with the post. Last laugh is the best and it will not be the shorts laughing.
Never had a six figure daily gain on one stock before. Never listen to all the haters that said sell at $5 per share.
JWN missed and TGT just missed. M Beat... just saying.
Wheahs dat squeeze
"Food, shelter and clothing. The basics in a plague infested world. Eventually everyone comes back because of pent-up demand, quality of all shoppers and prestige. Macy's is going to come back strong! Food is high volume right now. I expect shelter and clothing will be rebounding after the Southern states get a clue, causing COVID-19 cases to level off and decline."
"So happy to see things turn around for Macy’s and its shareholders. When it was below $8 a share, I said do not give up on this great company.Keep up the great effort. GLTA"
"Macy’s looks to subdivide its HQ, may sell parking garage That’s the difference between M and Sears !!Macy’s is taking advantage of every piece of land they have to strengthen their balance sheet without giving up any valuable assetsIf I remember correctly Sears sold the land their business sits on then lease it back yet kept the parking lot. !! Lol"
If you bought in the 5's don't panic. Kohls was at $12 3 weeks ago bounced to $20 2 weeks later and now 3 weeks from $12 trades 17-18. And they're not as profitable as M. MACYS will go up as things in market normalize malls just opened on Monday.
Max Pain for M options is $15
Gettin my money back
Nice try shorties... Nice try
Intetesting. I only buy clothes at Macy's and Ralph Lauren. - Pete
Good time to buy M. Macy is the retail leader and will go through this period!!!
Back under $34 by close of business tomorrow.Short initiated
Over 6 we fly!
i think macys will easily reach 20 if analysts would give it a proper evaluation.You can't possibly have sell and underperform on a stock that is clearly a buy with this kind of momentom going forward in this invironment
I wonder if the bullish people from 5 months ago are still holding? This thing looks like it's going to 10 or less. SELL.
Anyone notice how well this is tracking just below $9 on option close day? Shows we are all along for the ride based on what the big boys want to do. Oh well
"Listen Folks, nobody reading this is going to be able to influence M share prices. Individual investors like us are just gonna go for the ride whether it's up or down. That being said just keep in mind that these 125 Stores account for only 1.4B or roughly 5% of Macy's total revenue where as the top 150 Growth Stores account for roughly 12.5B or 50% of total sales. Therefore these stores are relatively insignificant to Macy's profitability, in fact i would even say closing these stores would allow Macy's to focus on those more productive stores and expect margins to improve greatly. They won't have to waste time, energy and money on upkeep on those unprofitable stores. It's a huge win and M is expected to save 600M this year alone and 1.5B a year once everything is said and done. It's a huge deal especially when you consider M's currently profit is only about 750M a year those savings are huge!"
"I hope all understand that M getting more debt means they do not have enough money for operations.I also understand that many still think (after one year when it started) that pandemic will be over soon. It will not, unfortunately. We already live in different world and in different economy. Macy's will be some day $20 but before it it will go lower single digits and probably through bankruptcy."
$40 STOCK
CLOSE ABOVE $17.50
Will it go up if stimulus deal is done?
Macy's taking all the proper precautions to open. They are going to be far ahead of the rest going forward. This stock price could easily be double by December.
"Boy was I wrong! I thought they'd meet the whisper number at most!I was wrong on EPSmildly wrong on salestotally wrong on share reaction (I thought either huge bounce or drop)Still nothing that tells me a great future, but well done to those who predicted they'd beat the whisper number!"
"Covered my short sale earlier from 15, made $7K, thank you Macy's!"
Get ready for a pop today at the open. Good news for retail sales. No reason not to see this rise.

Douglas sounds really smart right now (said nobody ever).
"LULU went to internet sale, so is M. so is NKE..I see no difference"
"wow, we may close at 10... Happy thanks giving.."
"45% returned goods on Amazon apparel, unsustainably high. Look for bricks and mortar retail to have a good holiday season."
"Hey Shorts, take Notice!, U.S. retail sales jumped 1.9% in September from August, blowing past estimates for a 0.8% gain, according to Bloomberg data. Spending at clothing stores surged 11% during the month. Sales at department stores, auto dealers and sporting goods stores also contributed to retail sales’ fifth straight monthly gain."
"Macy's reports property, plant and equipment of $6,558 millions. Some on this board assert that Macy's underreported real estate values by reporting a depreciated cost basis from purchase price decades ago which has not been updated to current market value.Macy's pays out about $465 million annually in dividends.Macy's can maintain the dividend for fourteen years while pursuing a plan of orderly and voluntary liquidation of its property, plant and equipment without earning anything on retail sales.That does not account for retail sales at leased locations or through e-sales."
"Yes, as I predicted. The shorts are going to go down fighting in flames! Right now they are fighting a tug of war! They will capitulate at much higher prices!You want to own it for the ride up and the rocket lift after they capitulate too."
Skyscraper to be built above Macy’s iconic flagship store - official. All over the news. Done deal.
"The anti-American M shorts deserve a GME-like short squeeze in M, for rooting for the downfall of an American icon, Macy's."
Looks like from the history M should report the dividend within the next 10 days and should go ex dividend around Mid Sept.
very good news on this one.
Is it time to buy Macy’s?
"The market was crushing me, sucking my cash and I was about to give up. Everything changed for me when I discovered (http://Pick-stocks.com). Join them now and count winners!"
I own the stock and I shop at Macy's.
Interesting article on how to save Macy's and JC Penney https://closeoutexplosion.com/products/how-to-save-jcpenney-macys-and-other-mall-retailers
Macy's is up 12.44% to 5.86
Morgan Stanley should fire that analyst today...Macy's at 40 is still just over 10 times earnings..that is less then normal for retailers
people still like to shop and not always on line I think it's a buy at just a great price I m added more shares .well see
"Amazon buying macy's will be just as good as Amazon bought whole food. while food was going on the wrong direction, Amazon got into brake and mortar and also saved while food. same is true with retail, we still like to see it on before buying, maybe not active ware, plus with adding few stores Amazon will grow leaps and bounds in retail, it would be plus for Amazon"
"CEO Jeffrey Gennette has made over 22 trades of the Macy`s Inc stock since 2011, according to the Form 4 filled with the SEC.

I wish I invested in Target over Macy’s. I am not feeling optimistic at all about tomorrow.
"Dillards get reported surged profits 1,000% earnings beat, here comes another short squeezer in Macys tomorrow the whole sector is going ape wild soon, appears no one travels and all they do is shop at dept stores again and again and again"
Thinking of buying M. The last 2 earnings they beat. CEO was on Mad Money a few weeks ago and it all looked great. Does it reach 20 again after earnings?
If this stock breaks $18.30 next stop is $22.30

All bad news baked in. Stock rises on a day with downgrades. No one is selling. Bottom is in. Just initiate a position. Don't forget the 10% div.
Kohl's doesn't have a Macys.com. Huge asset to Macy's. Buy.
"A lot of people aren't using their brains here. The stock is not going to zero. It may touch single digits but once this hyped up ""flu"" passes it will go back to higher teens. I don't think the stock will go past $30 again. $20s is likely. I don't think they will cut dividend. They can afford it."
"Just hold, people!Retail's recovering, so is Macy's.It's gonna drop further giving the current market sentiment, but it will be well over $20 somewhere in spring, after more people get vaccinated and overall economy improves further."
Yahoo Finance has been HACKED!!I keep seeing Macy's stock being reported as UP. That can't be correct. Macy's doesn't go up.
"If you are thinking about buying M today you will be getting a great deal. Why because M is worth a lot more than the stock is trading for plus it goes ex dividend on Sept 12 2019. Can it go lower sure , Can it go a lot higher sure. The real thing is you are not over paying for the shares at todays price. So if your out look is longer than most you will more than likely make lots of money. Buying stocks that are trading under value is a hard thing to do and most can not. All up to you what you want to do."

"Hedge Funds trying to get this bad boy caught up to retail sector in 2 days, aye longs?"
M should be $29.50 by now !
"At some point here, folks should want to start buying some. Balance sheet in good shape and you can't be sure how much was the down draft of markets in December that caused shoppers to step back from the store. Too cheap to short the stock so more of this selling is likely long continuing to eliminate positions and algorithm trading pressing momentum down. Like a fever, when it breaks, we should have a big intra day reversal which will drive algos to cover the positions. Investors much too negative on these retail names. Traffic was good all the way thru November for the year. No reason for that to have such a big turn other than temporary from the markets. Could see the retrace by end of day IMO."
"If the volume is this low starting a new month, on a green market day....what's in store for tomorrow and the rest of the week?"
"After Christmas Sale: Millennials, Xers don't like that ya gotta have a CODE now to get an extra 15%-20% off. Total 40%-60%--still Expensive while competition just gives the OFF Price, no Hassles. hehehe"

this is a reminder that GS has Apple's target price at $160. How is that going?
My wife shops Macy's a lot on line. Must be some value there...
Joining the party at 5.38 for 1500 shares Let’s get some positive news on reopening!!!!
Jack Ma from Alibaba(which Macys is there only department store partner) said this morning that they are agressively buying bricks and mortar...he said tha ecommerce companies like Alibaba need bricks and mortar retailers...They could easily buy Macy's for $40/share tomorrow with stock

"EPS will be 0Revenue 4,45 billions"
"look at XOM popping... Just telling you recovery trade in the gear.,"
Last Friday 26 blocked. This Friday 25.5 blocked. When it’s simple games makes me bullish. Nothing fundamental about this price action. Stay long.
It’s that go to the mall and Macy’s time of year!
We need to know how long they are suspending the dividend. The dividend is why I bought Macy's. If it's going to suspended longer than 1 quarter then I'm dumping this stock even at a big loss.
11.62% dividend is cash in the bank for share holders.
"Nothing but positive news and people are going to start going back in addition to online. Everyone I know is just looking for an excuse to go out and shop after so long. Forget millennials, even though they too want to go out and be active, the rest of us want to see and try products in person. I hate shopping for clothes and yet I plan to go out too in the near future. By the end of the year - big recovery."
bounce upward tomorrowvalue of real estate greatly exceeds stock value
Recently I used doordash for a quick purchase. Another way of revenue stream
"Yes, the same store sales are in decline (overall), given the fact that they have all but written off the bottom 200 underperforming stores, that really isn't too much of a surprise. As a long, I do not deny that, I actually embrace the fact. Macy's is in 41 states, Guam, the PR. Dillard's is a very similar store with a third of the store fronts and only in 31 states and they earn 5 dollars a share. At the end of the day the old adage of ""if you're not growing you're dying"" becomes counterproductive. Even the likes of Wal-mart have realized that their growth in lieu of profits was counterproductive and have become much more focused on growing in the proper areas. I am much more interested to see the details about the top 150 performing stores that they have already invested substantial funds into renovating. It does not concern me that they closed stores in downtown Seattle, downtown San Fran, downtown Chicago, Macy's has always been a great corporate and community citizen and they choose to work with downtown revitalization programs to keep their storefronts open while these cities and teams tried to bring back their downtown areas, many of these efforts have succeeded, many have not. Fortunately, Macy's has made the difficult decisions to leave very long time leases or ownership positions to focus on storefronts and locations which are growing. I would much prefer they follow the Dillard's model versus the Wal-mart model. That is what eventually took Sears down, they were too slow at adapting to the inevitable -- change. Change can be for the good and it can mean smaller revenues, but for the right reasons, higher profits."
I am not very positive about the earnings this quarter but going forward this is a recovering story. Not going to sell under 15.7 and probably will keep most of my position up to the 20's
Time to buy Macy’s soon $10 easily
Shorties better cover. It will continue rising rising until earnings. Then We will have 4th of July 3 days early.
"Everyone who is bashing this stock almost always talks about how consumers turned digital on their purchases. Honestly, when was the last time you purchased clothing online? Do you even have an idea on the size of the apperal retail market in the U.S? $368B as of 2019. Macy's is the top contender. Just honest opinions please."
Love Macys management! Well done! Love Macys friendly employees and their fun place to shop! Earnings and sales hit out out of the park!Post covid with far fewer competitors this a growth company!
"Macy's stock price target raised to $33 from $30 at J.P. Morgan7:23 am ET May 14, 2018"
"retail sales is better than last month..vaccines are coming... eaning don matt.. 2021 will be great for Macy.,"
This is for ALL the people that shorted Macy’s this week.
Gennette has taken Macy's back to 2009! ZERO return in over 10 years. Fire Gennette
Hold and don’t use any margin - it will bounce back next week - earnings date is 7-1
Turn those machines back on!
I've noticed after hours and pre-market this pops high and then day time algos bring it down and hold at midpoint. Can't hold a good stock down for long. M is way oversold and undervalued imo.
"Holding pretty well, well done longs."
hope no one sold this is going to 20 in no time
$8+ this week. Lets go Macy's!
I love Macy’s they have good deals
CEO predicts stores opening Monday will see less than 20% of normal sales. This could be a low ball number based on China's reopening data. Stock could get a boost if there is positive feedback on store traffic this coming week.
"Over reaction to actually good retail sales news. Year over year December sales were up 2.9 percent! Impressive to say the least! That is the bottom line.Of course month to month sales are down. Retailers pushed to move holiday sales early starting in October with big sales. No wonder Oct sales were higher than Nov and no wonder Nov sales were higher than Dec.This is exactly what was expected.Fact is year to year sales comparisons for Oct, Nov and Dec are all higher 2020 year versus 2019!That is very impressive considering Covid restrictions!2021 is certain to be much better with all this stimulus, The end of covid and increased jobs and increasing the min wage to $15/hour"
I thought we are heading to $6 today but I'll take $8 now.
Macy's big sell off coming soon....real soon! As usual!
M crossed above $13 today. Just the beginning folks! Love the massive short position outstanding. 'That is going to lead to an eventual short covering panic. You want to own it on that day.
I sat on the fence for 3 weeks about joining (http://Stocks-tracker.com) for their weekly picks. Big mistake. M exploded and I completely missed out. Don’t make the same mistake I made. Join them today.
My Billionaire friend sold after a quick trade for a reason!!
"BOYS......DONT CRY LATER....OH , WHY DID I NOT BUY IN THE 15S???? THE STOCK GOES TO 19S IN JANUARY...BANK IT!!! THATS WHY THEY CALL ME THE ""GREAT ONE""!!!!!"
Next stop.... Within the hour $18!!!!
Reaction pre-market is algo based. Purely machine oriented. Will close green imo.
"This pandemic causes changes to mentality about shopping at Mall as folks miss come back to brick and mortar stores because it is more fun. Being at home all of these times make them want to be back out and see the folks, friends, and families (social distancing of course). Mall will fill back up again and Macys will be there for want-to-be shoppers again. Amazon cannot replace luxury and the feeling when coming to a Macys stores. M is cheap don't you think while economy is opening back up. This stock should be trading above $7 post memorial days sales."
I think M will run up into earnings as they’ll have another down side surprise....
M will reach to $60 plus at the end of 2021 !!!
Bought Macy’s a few days ago at 29. Market cap is still less than the real estate value of their flagship stores. If competition reports good numbers Macy’s will continue to rise
Thank you Nominsky and your boiler room buddies for paying my upcoming M dividend.
"The problem Macys has being based in NY and having 75,000 workers is unions. Also in the deep South some people are still fighting the civil war (1861-1865) and think of M as a Yankee company. M can always sell another half billion in junk bonds but there kicking the can down the road like SHLD, JCP, H.H. Gregg, Montgomery Wards, Kress, Bradlees, Radio Shack et cetera."
Buy or sell ?
"Downgrade from MS, downgrade from UBS...and Macy's is on the same level than before, think twice and out of the box."
"Macy's is a $50+ stock, this is not a random opinion look at the financials. This is an easy money post covid play and there is still money to be made. Vaccines are around the corner, we've been through the worst of COVID, Stimulus approved- people have done the online shopping and are ready to go back on holiday, visit stores, shop, return to some form of normality. Look at the chart for 2008-2009, Macy dipped before and it recovered strong same will happen again. Buy it, hold it, and love it 6 months from now."
CFO told investors at a conference Sales may not Normalize until 2021 or even 2022.
"Coronavirus vaccine now exists, so the end of the crisis is at hand. We just begun the first quarter this year in which ALL of Macys stores are open for the full quarter.LIfe is the USA soon will return to normal as there will be no need to wear masks, social distance or have any restrictions on the economy going forward. This means a return to precovid sales and profits at the minimum and due to the great reduction in retail competition expect Macys to return to growth takin up the slack and $10 billion plus sales of the dead retailers. Macys is expected to see a v recovery in sales, profits and even a return to sales growth in year over year comps.This means stock gains in the several hundred percent going forward."
"Hi 35's today. 40 by late June. Not too late to get in on the action, unless you are a short, then it's way too late."
Feb 21 stock was $16.23.......today even after last two days move stock is $7.87....EASY TO SEE stock has plenty of room to run here.
"Put options15.00 strike price open intrest 14,465. They needed something to get it down to 15 today."
Ready for a hefty rebound shorties? Better be prepared! Short-squeeze will come........... whatever it takes..........
Tomorrow will be another story. Take half of the table at least
It's rebounding. This will get back to green this afternoon. The price is still a bargain. I am loading more shares.
"Shorts not cover yet. Imagine if that happened, M would be >$20, easily."
"$1,000 on $7 Puts would have returned a Profit of $1,130 @ 113% up to $1,480 @ 147%, and you'd have done that in 2-days remaining out, safe and risk free most of the week."
I have a bad feeling about this Macy’s stock - getting ready to drop harder this week - downgraded by John Morgan today
"As M reinvents its stores, refurbishes them, and pays down debt, it will earn $3.15per share this year and pay a monster dividend. If China capitulates and agrees to become more open to U.S. exports, it will make far more. Buy."
"Who will buy Macy's, Facebook or Amazon?"
"Sam, you know it was unjustified when you get the talking heads on CNBC saying the exact same thing and they properly ""explained"" the drop based on higher logistic costs which could impact margins going forward, though those same impacts will also hit all of their competition and even more so Amazon as Amazon gets hit on 100% of their on-line sales for coming and going through their distribution centers, at least with the products sold in their brick and mortar stores, which is still the majority of their revenues, that is only hit on the inbound and not the outbound. So again, I believe this was a manipulated move to create entry points for high wealth clients of the big houses."
7+ looks very reasonable today. I'm looking forward to a good squeeze soon
"dont cover yet, shorts"
"Looks like the went all out in this scam, on Macy's recovery trend. First the dump to take your shares, now Amazing a Zack's story saying how HoHum Macy's is and it's a hold. Why, well they want to buy your shares on the way up too! That's right, just like the stop loss on the way down, why not get the other shares from the people who say, I am out this is going nowhere or down. I don't make may predictions but this one is CRYSTAL CLEAR! M is in recovery mode, Trend is up, big boys are getting in before they start their pump campaign, expect M to break new highs soon. (of course as long as no market crash)If you don't know how it works yet let me give you the basics. Macy's reported a great quarter, with digital going through the roof and pandemic ending. Big boy caught off guard (As Usual, but does matter because the can bring M anywhere they want price wise) so they wait for the earnings volume to fizzle then push it down sealing regular investors stock. And then? Of course it will become a stock on the rise, everyone will want it and boom they sell their millions of shares staying rich, getting richer all based on dump retail investors. Lastly, know they will push this stock way past what it is really worth. Seen this so many times in so many sectors. Don't believe me, I purchased SHOP at $16 and had options too, sold at $120 thinking this is it, wow was I wrong about how far these crooks can push the bubble. Enjoy the ride for those with the guts."
Fort Wayne Macy’s busy still at 8pm !!
"Shorts driving down premarket. Hold, buy dips. Well known fact we are heavily shorted. We don't have to sell. Eventually shorts will have to cover. Make them pay!!!! Buying on fake dips....."
"my goodness those 6.50 calls a week ago, im speechless, a toast....to the greatest market in the world"
"i hold shares on this i only hope for a turn around. I bought 1 year before at 15 and then during covid i averaged down to 12.89. Lets be honest guys, their last report was equally horrible even if they reopened. I dont see the coronavirus thing ending soon. And it isnt easy to get back to their pre-covid results which even then , their revenues were on decline. I bought back then because their dividend looked healthy and looked easy to cover with their profits ,sales were on decline but projected they wont fall that fast and there was even time for some positive changes. It was trading at pe of 5 then. Coronavirus changed the situation a lot and they are now playing with time before they start selling their assets or continue with losses till they decide to end it of. Ofcourse there is a hope they will come back with a plan but it's only a hope. I lost a lot cause of covid. I dont sell my losers though. Good luck for all of us which are holders because this the only thing we hope now"
Well Stitch Fix is getting close to having a higher market cap then Macy's...amazing
The 20 yr chart on M looks to be a perfect head and shoulder.
Macy $20 in December
Macy's is good swing trader's stock for 5% weekly gains!
The company is planning something great. Announcement coming soon. Stock will double is 6-18 months
"Spagetti, do you remember the drops from 2009, daily blue chips dropped ten to fifteen percent. I remember buying the company that I worked for at 8.78 cents a share, the company was Johnson Controls, we were making decent money, the company was stable but I was scared to death that the company would go under. Needless to say, it didn't but what did happen is that the uber wealthy, the Warren Buffet's of the world increased their wealth dramatically and the 0.1% do so everytime there is a financial crisis. I don't think anyone really believes that Macy's will go bankrupt, they still make three bucks a share, they still have billions of real estate. Did they execute poorly this quarter, yes, and they got hammered for it, though they also executed very well the previous quarter and got what, hammered for that as well. It merely suits the desires of those who really control the markets to tank them. They did everything in their power to create fear and chaos leading up to the Christmas holiday to try and mitigate what was on track to be the best holiday season in decades, they succeeded. I personally believe the goal is two fold though currently, to dump the economy and to try and dump the sitting President. We shall see though, by the way, I sold that JCI stock at 45 before the Tyco merger."
maybe it's time to cover.
I define sub 5 as ‘blood in the streets’ so I bought for a long term hold with non margin money I can afford to lose. Looking for 15 within a year.
Is the dividend safe?
"The new up trend has now started , M should double or more from here. Why because Wall Streets rich clients all want in before the move higher. Get ready to go higher"
"The markets didn't spike higher, but Macy's did.Hmmmm...."
"I figured they would beat expectations as expectations are pretty low for these guys, and I visited the malls before Christmas and found the Macy's pretty busy. All kinds of shoppers and buyers, and that was in NJ where people were being safe about COVID. It didnt help the stock much. People just dont have faith in old school retail, but the valuation is low against the assets and their competition is less than in the past, all management has to do is be a little creative and they will be able to beat expectations. That said this management seems a bit slow to modernize and get with the digital age."

"IT is a Fact that the CHINA virus (COV19) has not killed even ONE healthy young person. Not one. It is just a flu-like virus.Who is afraid of the common flu? My family and I don't even bother to get a flu shot each year. Why? We don't need to. No healthy person needs a flu shot.In fact, it is fact that the flu shot is more dangerous than the flu to a healthy person with a strong immune system.That's a fact! Get 7 hours sleep, exercise daily and eat healthy food and one need not fear ANY flu virus at all.FACT!"

Bought a collar today. Sold OTM calls and bought ATM puts. Trade was a credit calls paid for puts. M goes up I make money. M goes down I don't lose. Will adjust after earnings.
l am afraid to say l think this will be the last week m will be in the 5.00 range
Macy's will be at $70 per share next 5 years
buy at 5 then sell at 5.3repeat
M closes at 13 tomorrow...
Few are buying before next week’s ex-dividend dateThis is disappointing
Wow there are 108M short interest today! This is about 35%. Lots of pain for the shorters coming soon.
"will buy 250 shares today, making it 3000 shares. never sold shares with lose. I can stay 5 years to sell with profit. made it 50 times already."
"DDS exceeds estimates today:-) Same thing for Macy‘s very soon: Q1 bad, bad NOT as bad as expected, plus a decent outlook and reopening of all 775 stores/malls by mid June the latest. Annual Shareholders Meeting today starts at 11am EDT. Be ready and be on board!"
"safe, huge dividend....enough said"
"85M shares sold short out of 309M. At 15 a share, things can get very interesting very fast."
"This is going down faster than you can say: ""Macy's Thanksgiving Parade"""
I wouldn't be surprised to see $22 by end of today.
"Something fishy going on here....hard to figure out. It might not should be going gang busters right now, but it ought to be somewhat keeping up with the market and other retails.............??"
This was a $17 stock before the pandemic hit. Now with the financing announced watch for a nice climb over $10. The only thing keeping this down was that no financing deal news. Macy‘s WILL survive!
Short squeeze coming up........... mark my words shorties!!!!
"the whole stock market is aapl, fb and amzn, all the rest are crashed"
"I’m bullish on Macy’s but this jump makes me concerned about the potential energy going into earnings. If it’s already pushed high, earnings will have to crush to really push it higher (or so I think)"
Bought more today. Since it past 25 I think we see a run up next week.
M was paying 465M in dividends each and every year that couldn't be reduced in fear of tanking the stock. Obviously there are no more dividends to speak of but what if things realistically can return to normal or close to normal next year? That's 465M M will now no longer have to pay out which can be then used to pay down debt etc. They already intend to keep capex at roughly 50% of what they've been investing the past few years which is about 1B. With reduced capex and suspended dividends and things potentially returning back to normal-ish. What should M do with an extra billion a year? just saying.
"Rider, you logic is very flawed. Best Buy does omni channel very well that is why they are effectively challenging Amazon. Actually electronics are essentially a commodity that translates well to on-line sales. Apparel is not a commodity item, as well as many of items that Macy's sells, fit and form for apparel are vastly different than buying a Sonos II wireless speaker or a Klipsch sound system. The real question is whether Macy's can adapt effectively to omni channel and this report confirms that they are making the necessary changes."
Like a vegetable garden let it sprout up and grow.Not time to harvest yet.

to the reddit traders .... us macy longs appreciate the help
"Obviously, the consensus is Macy is different from JCP, DDS, JWN, etc. As a leader, M is doing great job with great dividends which is worth investing!"
Heh guys could I double-check. Did Macy's really make 8.5B of online revenue? Thats huge.
Steady trade today. its doing its normal trade. love what I see
Shareholders meeting this Friday May 15th! Sharing strategy and good news on additional financing on top of their huge cash on hand.
"Current market Themes to drive up beaten down stocks:*1.8 Trillions in stimulus*vaccinations, 100million by March. *openings in restaurants, people going out, need more new clothes*Money to spend on new clothing for spring. Where do people want to spend their $1400, Target? Macys?*Shorts will have to cover creating many buyers. Longs: Hold, buy more as we get closer to earnings and beyond into the summer! For shorts I recommend to cover. This is not the time you want to short~!"
$10 soon. People will be buying with the whole economy reopening. Jobs are coming back strongly. M is still a long way from pre-covid price of $15. Lots of opportunities from other retail bankruptcies. Let's go long Macys!!
"Market wants to see Profits Now today, and, lately. Russell 2K is down while S&P is up over 1% . Market is tired of tech specs. Tech earners are fully valued and then some . I am switching to more M and more cash. By the time the first quarterly profit is reported, this will be well over 20."
"It will be struggle at around$11 and if not drop lower than$10.3, then will challenge $15 soon."
Going back to $15.
This is what is hurting all retail today...acy's (M -2.4%) and Kohl's (KSS -1.6%) both track lower after Cleveland Research warns on December trends.The research firm frequently causes ripples in the retail sector through its probing channel checks

If this stock breaks $23.31 next stop is $31.84!Don't miss out and give your cheap stock to industrial investors who are now just jumping in stocks like Macy's VALUE HERE.
Now we watch M climb to a higher close. Standing as a winner of the old guard brick and mortar retailers.
Back in the game tomorrow
"Does anyone else find it very interesting that companies like TJX (whom I personally love), Ross and Burlington are blowing up meanwhile the discount outlets for the main stream chains are also blowing up? Backstage by Macy's and Off the rack by Nordstorm and all of the others that have similar discount outlets are also blowing up. Seems like the fact that many of the main stream retailers pushing their own unsold goods would eventually cut into the merchandise available to the discount chains. Also rather humorous that it took the main stream chains so long to figure this out since L.S. Ayres out of Indianapolis came up with the same concept back in the 50s and the 60s with their Ayr-way stores."
Buy signal
all in
"Yes, Macy's is the best in class with best in class mgmt. Their setting up stores within stores was a brilliant act! Buy."
I don't know why the author of the below SA article finds it remarkable how negative shorts are about Macy's. They have a 45% of the float short stake in Macy's. It is what shorts do..short and distort. Short squeeze will be arriving here very soon i believe.
6es coming........... whatever it takes.......... and then to double-digits.......... mark my words shorties!!!
Macy's is worth easily $15 ....expect it to get there sooner rather than later.
Very confused by the price action on M; why the pop after downgrade?
"Fed cut rate can boost m sales growth in this winter, see back to school sales, if m back to school sales good, m can rise to$24 per share."
"I heard macys is looking into a second hand seller in their dept stores, is this true? Do they just launder the clothing before selling?also why do most millenials like USED items? whatever happened to NEW and fresh out of the box?"
"Look out, M in an uptrend. Way oversold under $35 in the context of likely the best retail season, ever. Buy."
"M wants to go higher. With earnings at $4 this year, we could hit $50 in a flash. In the meantime, enjoy your fat dividend."
"Seasonally strong reporting qtr. Better load up, all negatives priced in. As I said yesterday, in at $15."
There's a reason there was a big insider buy last week
Great move by Macy's to refi debt. Stores will start reopening next week in many states and eCommerce business is taking off. Management doing a great job of being prudent and Macy's (being an American Institution) will be a $40 stock in two years.
I was able to brought some more shares at $11.025. Wow
"The company was on a downward trend before the pandemic, and now it is difficult to service a huge debt, sales are worse than ever, and when the pandemic ends is still unknown, the virus quickly mutates, the vaccine may not work. It's crazy to buy it now at this price and wait for growth."
$8.50 we will closeDo you agree?
When is the bleeding going to stop.....
Can this be like GME? Let’s go to $200!
"I bet on Macys recover, and even if they shrink, they would give the money back to investors, i believe they can pay the book value to the investors as they shrink. Dont forget that Macys is one of the oldest companies in the US stock market, historic companies dont get down that easily. Also believe it or not it is still the most popular us online retailer in fashion segment https://www.statista.com/statistics/895921/share-of-voice-among-leading-fashion-retailers/"
"Where are Carlos and apostrophe? Entertainment is missing, lol."
"Nordstrom family or any LBO company, are you listening? You can pay 30% premium for M or $27.50 per share x 308 million shares outstanding = $8,470,000,000. Go private and use the dividend to pay off the loan each year with money to spare. Sell 300 stores and keep only the best. Operate the company for 5 years while paying off all the debt. Then dump the inventory, sell all the other properties except the 2 NY city locations (Macy's and Bloomingdale's) and be debt free, owning the NY buildings outright."
 diamond  hands. This is going up. Market getting hammered and Macy’s green all day. 20’s in our future. Hold on to this Winner
Real Estate value is higher than market capitalization!!!
"Too expensive for now, given the coming variants."
Here's my take on what Macy's is going to do with that 5B soon. Keeping in mind M likely has about 500M left of that 685M of cash on hand at end of the year since they haven't been shut too long ago. That being said i think they will refi 1.5B in debt due with the next 3 years so nothing is due fir 5+ years. 500M allocate towards capex this year and 3B will ensure M has plenty of liquidity for 2 years. BUT WAIT. . There 1 more B left how can M put this best to use? I'd say 500M in buybacks could trim 25% of the float is a great use of capital when share prices are so far below book. The extra 500M is just more cushion. And there u go 6B can easily include buybacks...i hope they do it quickly tho.
"Macy’s, Inc. To Report Third Quarter Results On November 14. :-)"
Go Macy’s
Case in point PFE stock today down 2 to 3 dollars! Why? Making large profits from covid vaccine and is a solid company.Reason is merely nature of markets to fluctuateLikewise M will resume rise to 20s and 30s.
Strong Buy Macy‘s at this level!
Following in GME footsteps. Shorts won’t know what happened. M will double!!!
HUGE accumulation....... Going to explode to the upside
New shorts coming in trying to cause a panic sell. Don't do it
"Tomorrow options expire, probably from Monday we should be ok. Looks like some big guys pulled out money from retail sector, all retailers are down.."
Earnings beat 6.5% dividend and more stock buy backs to come. Buy the weakness!!
"My wife bought yesterday an expensive coat at our local macy's, for 50% off.I bought expensive macy's shares for 50% off.We are both very happy!!!"
Macy’s reached a 10-year low today. Meanwhile stock market more than doubled during the same period.
Great morning for Macy's. Up over $1.00 and 4%. This sure shatters the 1 year estimate. Already $25 and heading to $26. Higher highs and Higher lows.Do well Macy's investors.Happy holiday shopping.
Chart shows $12.91 next resistance area
more fun on the way up..shorts u agree?.. :) haha
I'm guessing this will drop another $1.25 - $2 today.
"TSLA stock is still up 31% in July after June's 29% jump. AMD stock was the standout, spiking 26% last week."
"Did Macys make money last quarter if you take out one time charges and EBITDA? No, they lost money just not as much as 2020. Or maybe Roberts right, they're making money hand over fist. Gennette will be out in a year or two leaving common shareholders holding his golden parachute."
shorts completely in control here
Top Bullish Charts | April 2021  https://chart-analysis.tools/Bullish-Charts
I didn’t buy enough at the bottom
Head and shoulder pattern setting up. Price target 18.79 but could see 8.75 first.
Money keeps coming in...Downtown Macy's building sold to 3CDC for $7.5M. What company will Macy's buy next.
"The borrowing of $500,000,000 thru bonds is a pretty good deal. M can ride out a third wave of covid if it hits like Italy & Germany. When JCP borrowed $330,000,000 from Goldman Sachs (GS) in 2012 they used real estate as collateral and 2 or 3 GS employees were put on the JCP board. M was smart to borrow now while interest rates are low and bonds are in demand."
"Extended Hours | 7:13:07 AM EST Volume 14.23 -0.79 (-5.26%) 479,992 Almost half a million shares already sold in pre-market. It is going to be a beautiful day."
Trading below the $20 book value and pays a 10% dividend. Is this a value trap or what?
Another GME
"compared to others, Macys debt is manageable, this is very short term 3 months i guess till virus is in control,Macys will bounce back strong towards 14 soon. Till then they continue with online shopping site."
This will help the bottom line. Macy's inMalls in Cinncinati suburbs perform better. https://www.bizjournals.com/cincinnati/news/2018/01/03/macys-to-close-downtown-cincinnati-store.html
"Every time I ride through a Macy’s parking lot it’s packed. (NJ) I think Macy’s is taking all the closed businesses, Nordstrom, jc penny niemen Marcus. Back to work, back to school, people need clothes after gaining all that quarantine weight."
"I'm not in M one way or the other. Wondering if all the Sears and other store bankruptcies and store closing is renewing traffic at Macys. There aren't that many mall shopping options. Basically 100% of mall traffic at many malls is going to M. Even though the mall traffic is way down, it is all going to one place. Just a thought."
10 bagger
"Huge volume in the calls, every strike and every week. Someone thinks M is going higher."
"Something's not right, this should be up big today with the earnings released so as the potential for this year!"
My 13 call will look good tomorrow 
I just bought a $30 hoodie on Macys. I am hoping that will make the stock price recover.
"Stopped out for a loss on my Jan 17 15 puts.. First time this year I've lost money on puts in this name... I am happy for the longs on this board that you got a bounce, it's trying to rally back to 16s.I'm thinking, with the volume we witnessed, someone is building a large position, similar to past forced buy outs to leverage the real estate? EV is less than total Debt... Tread carefully. Also, keep in mind, hedge funds now have realtime data from specific sources, maybe they like the gross receipts during the holiday season?I will stay on the sidelines for now and see what happens. Best of luck to all."
Stocks fluctuate. Completely normal after a move up. You want to own it when we resume the huge move back to 20s and 30s.
"wow, last order over 27000 shares"
"In the next 3 years Macy's competition in Bricks and Mortar will be close to gone. I believe JC Penny as well as Lord and Taylor even Saks may not exist or if they do they will be shells. In the next 3 years of owning Macy's you will collect $4.50/share in dividend so your cost basis will be at $19.40 based on the $24/share price today. Macy's will probably cut the debt down to $2.5 billion they will continue to reinvest in omnichannel and digital sales, they will use Real Estate to there benefit by revamping stores with Marketplace at Macy's also the malls are reinventing themselves with more entertainment. If you buy Macy's today in 3 years you will have a very strong company that will reinvent themselves as you can see this by the Story acquisition and the investment in b8ta as well as Blue Mercury. I believe they have more levers too pull"
"Hard to see Macy's not blowing past earnings estimates, especially given the effectiveness of the new mgmt. team. Buy."
Nothing has really changed since Friday so I would expect a bounce in price up to Wednesday's close before the ex date on Thursday.
Shall we go for lunchbreak spikey-spikey? Oh yes! Let‘s go buyers! This is a Strong Buy! Short-squeeze coming up at our earliest convenience! Whatever it takes!
A breakout coming soon
Options fully loaded! Now let‘s exagerate in the other direction. It‘s going to be fun......... the M-rocket is on the launch-pad...... 3.......2........1........
Wooooh let’s go! Show me 30+!

What do we get out of this? https://champ.gothamist.com/champ/gothamist/news/besides-build-new-skyscraper-macys-will-spend-235-million-improve-herald-square
"Amazon is looking to expand its realestate holdings through acquisitions and is holding $27 billion in cash which will be an immense tax liability if not reinvested before year end. It is looking at Macy's as M owns the real estate it's stores are in and it will give Amazon access to clothing lines it currently cannot access, specifically Ralph Lauren (RL), featured prominently at Macy’s stores, or Canada Goose (GOOS), sold at Bloomingdale’s (which Macy’s owns). Look for an announcement before Ocrober ends, perhaps even befor September ends. The Ocrober 2, $7.00 call options are experiencing a volume increase as detailed in an article today. Amazon is also looking at JC Penney but not as good a fit or as beneficial to Amazon as Macys is. JC may be potentially acquired after bankruptcy for pennies on the dollar. Macy's is going to survive. The willingness of banks to finance them through the c19 retail collapse is testimony to that. The primary consideration when loaning money is the ability to repay the loan. Macy's was extended financing because the institutions extending the financing feel Macys has the ability to repay the debt. It is validation of Macy's strength. So if Amazon wants Macy's it will have to pay and better ooner than later. The longer Amazon waits the higher the acquisition cost will be as Macys recovers with the exonomy and at years end the $27 billion of uninvested cash sitting in Amazon's cash accounts will become taxable. The deal ( Amazon acquiring Macys happens before year end or not at all and most likely before the end of October."
"SYF, JD, AMD STMP & CMG all went down 50%+ during it's sell off and look at what happened once it hit bottom. Point is nobody's usually buying at the bottom bc pessimistism is at it's peak. Nearly a 10% dividend yield that atleast for the next 2 years can easily be covered beyond that no one really knows. But i would imagine M would still be a profitable business for the next 5 years."
Shorts are playing their last card.. better cover before $20’s
RSI 38 so not near overbought yet...
"The price is massively suppressed now. When it runs, it will let loose and run wild."
"The real unfortunate thing with Macy's is that a lot of older, retired investors have parked their live savings in this stock (as well as others who used to be considered blue chips) because they paid a very nice dividend and were a very strong player in retail. While I will be the first to say that Macy's has been slow on the uptick morphing the company to meet the new realities of e-commerce and a younger generation who may or may not shop at their mom's stores, they have really been unfairly beaten down. I also believe the fact that the beat down is continuing into today when the rest of retail has staged a bit of a recovery is indicative of the big money understanding the composition of the Macy's investors, as I said many older and retired small retail investors. So they know if they can use the shock and awe approach that will shake many of these investors out of the stock as happened yesterday, but they also know that many of those investors have seen big drops and may not have flinched off of their investments. Now if they can continue the drop while other retail improves, that will cause them to question the company and the stock. The sheer volume of shares being traded on a decent day for retail after a major over correction leads me to believe that there is a concerted effort to drive more small mom and pop retail investors out of this stock."
Is it a good buy for long term ?
"Cramer continues to mention Macy's on CNBC. Always positive now, for YEARS he was down on Macy's. Big boys game pumping Macy's finally, all to our advantage."
"10%+ this week. that is great but but but the company still has massive debt, little cash and dwindling sales and earnings. that said, why would any long be strutting around. I would have my finger on the enter button getting out of this shaky stock as soon as the price turns and turn it will soon."
"Market cap $12 billion, debt $6 billion, real estate worths $20 billion, business has turned around (earning and revenue all increased), pays 5% dividend, the fourth largest online company in the country, high tech applications to reduce cost, such virtual reality, smart phone apps and many more to come... This stock is going up!!!"
"LOOKS LIKE THE RUMOR MAY BE TRUE !!!!AMAZON MAY BUY MACY""S !!!!! $21 PLUS !!!!"
All the talk about cutting the dividend is classic spread the fear mentality.
"last year, January 10th Macy's revealed results of preceding holiday season, and for the year"
"Is a cycle but M is in the upward trend, Its sales are going up day after day"
"Everyday same. Break new low. Back up a little bit before market closed. Red after market, next day gap down and another new low."
"Some one has levered up with call option at $15 strike, So it looks like they will be pushing M higher some time between now and Nov 8 2019"
Its Friday and no one wants to hold this thing over the weekend.....
shorty
M employees play ping pong during business hours because there are no customers in the stores.
PR to 15 from a bank!
"with 2500 shares, the dividend is nice to have. but the big money will come when they will be 30$, soon."
"The short day traders have Macys wrong and they are out on the limb too with a 40 percent float of shares shorted!This is the perfect short squeeze.They will eventually relinquish!Slowly but surely they will recognize they are wrong about Macys, it management and employees and future prospects. The patient long investor will be richly rewarded for their faith in Macys."
you guys are hilarious!!! one red day and your all freeking out!! CHILL!!! it went up for a week straight!! u think it goes up forever?! totally normal that it takes a dip and rebounds.
"I feel I am part of a movie and I can't decide what to do next, long run if they survive will be good.. but i have a feeling it could drop to 5 usd.."
Macys will beat expected earnings. Will see this over 10 by Thursday mark my words
Way over done reaction... be back at $17 plus SOON!
Told you yesterday. This stock is junk. First follow Dow. And decides to move based on the market maker whims and fancies. I have decided. But calls hen it is 10% down atleast in the last few days. And buy puts the other way around. 10% up. That’s the only strategy that works as I have seen
Here comes the bounce.

"Only Short sellers are selling Macys, and they have a huge position to cover. +200% short squeeze! Thank you"
"It appears Lowe’s will definitely show up tomorrow, unlike Home Depot."
"What I find interesting is that they are using a less than stellar profit report and anticipated annual profit report by Macy's to tank the overall markets, primarily fashion and retail. The underlying numbers were actually decent, revenues met, same store sales actually exceeded both management and analysts' expectations. The issues that they used were with the exception of the international tourist shopping decline not systemic. There was poor execution by the designers and purchasers, poor inventory mix and poor design aesthetic, this just proves that the markets are being used to promote a greater narrative, that the economy is not strong and that the consumer is weak. The numbers from Capri and KTB as well as Macy's show that revenues are good to very good, how one company or even multiple companies execute is an individual issue not a sector or economic issue. The drop in international tourism sales is to be expected, prior to the recent 25 basis point drop by the Fed, the US was the only economy actually raising rates, therefore the dollar became as President Trump said, too strong."
108million shares short 1/3 of the shares squeeze and off it goes. Maybe they covered some of the shorts this morning then people took that profit and ran.
"This was the kitchen sink quarter. Sales will steadily rise from here. Macy's is not going out of business. Stock will continue to rise once all stores are open. My personal opinion is, if my local Walmart and Home Depot store's are now full of customers, Macy's customers will return as well. People will be out shopping. Time to take a position."

"Still pricy on all retails, all stock bubble still"
This has been down 8 out of the last 10 days. Today may make 9 out of 11. Bummer
You thought shorting retail outlets during the pandemic was easy. The cannabis market just entered a into bear territory. Come short #crlbf #curlf #hrvsf #tcnnf for easy money. Just take a look at the chart. Says it all.
"Really good time to buy Macy for long term at $15, look at that 9% yield...."
Short term performance outlook just got downgraded to neutral...what does that mean?
"Macy’s is the last man standing, manufacturers and brands will have no choice but to sell through Macy’s,Macy’s can easily reach $30 once the virus is dealt with,Do not let shorties and paid bashers scare you"
Vaccine will be submitted to FDA approval in days not weeks. Approval by FDA this Month. The covid storm is passing and life will be back to normal fast.Fact is 95 percent who test positive have no symptoms or it is only a minor cold!This was always way over hyped at the start.
"A buy signal was issued from a pivot bottom point on Friday November 08, 2019, which indicates further gains until a new top pivot has been found.Given the current short-term trend, the stock is expected to rise 2.3% during the next 2 weeks plus holiday shopping season.."
above 18.5 tomorrow open lol my level 2 showed me a bunch of call sweeps at 18.2 priced 0.30. The whale/hedge fund who bought that will push it above 18.50 tomorrow.
Talk is cheap. The last time I was in Macy's it was packed full of people. When I go in a Macy's and it looks like a JCP then I'll worry about it. Until then it's a bunch of noise.
"Wonder if Goldman, Morgan and Credit Suisse are pressuring Cowen and Deutsche Bank to come out with downgrades, they are the only two big boys who haven't already downgraded the stock this month. They surely will have to try and do something to try and curb the momentum."
So much bullishness on this message board... Do M long shareholders worry or even care about the $8.6 Billion in debt (and growing)? Does the debt even matter in this low interest rate environment? Is closing under-performing stores the golden ticket? Is it waiting for short squeeze or a true turnaround in the business?
Slowly but surely --> $20
Hold
Maybe will still do a Thanksgiving parade?
I declare Macy's will have a good day tomorrow!
Post covid you will be amazed how fast their earnings and sales can grow!People are suffering from cabin fever! They want out!
"You do realize the stock gets adjusted down on ex dividend date for what the amount of the dividend is, right?"
"$5,42 on decent volume and in the mood for MUCH higher stockprices........... whatever it takes.........."
Load and HOLD tightly. Load more as it goes down. Worst case still 10% dividend.

Ready to see how average investors and traders are killing it and making thousands a day just from following 1 simple pick a week? Just go to https://shr.link/Beststockalerts
Can anyone see a reason for the pre drop?
"Last year on the 10th, Macys updated the holiday season and downgraded full year guidance. Lets hope for a different outcome this time. The stock dropped 16% that day. 2019 saw management stay ahead of the game and downgrade expectations ahead of time. All of the bad news is baked in unless we see a disappointing Christmas season. I personally do not expect that."
"Macy's announces $1 billion bond offering to repay credit facility(Reuters) - Macy's Inc said on Tuesday it planned to raise $1.1 billion in a bond offering, backed by a first mortgage on some of its properties, to repay funds borrowed under a revolving credit facility.The department store chain drew down a $1.5 billion credit facility in March as it had to temporarily close stores and limit its business to its app and website due to the COVID-19 pandemic.A number of U.S. companies are also pledging their assets and properties to raise money and clear debt as businesses reopen after a long government mandated lockdown.The senior secured notes are due 2025, Macy's said."
You guys have anything for me to research for a long position?I have nothing to do now in this market.. better do some research.. :) how's your day guys?
"When the NASDQ stocks plunge, expect Macys stock to soar."
Couple quick shareholder friendly moves Macy's could make: 1. Sell Bloomingdales and the real estate to private equity (possible worth $2-4 Billion) this would pay down most or all debt 2. Sell/take private deal on the entire Macy's this would be funded by free cash flow and paying no dividend..also private equity could also sell Bloomingdales and/or Credit Card business this would pretty much get private equity Macy's/Blue Mercury for free within 3 years or sooner
Thank you Reddit! :)
"I remembered that nomansky. She was on the MNK message board when it reached 1$. She tried the same tricks making people think that MNK is done in. Mnk is more than 3 now and is holding steadily. So, waste ye time somewhere else, ye, crapbird."
Wild day. Shorted towards the top and covered at the end. I have a feeling this thing is on a trajectory up.
"M is moving higher. Chart is looking good. I don't see resistance till 31. Extremely low valuation. They are making progress on capitalizing on their real estate. Low 20s look definetely like the bottom. Should Trump finally strike a trade deal with China, M is one of the stocks that is going to jump.

I hate to say it but I think we may go to 11.
"Macy's taps Lazard to bolster finances as coronavirus saps sales.It is the world's largest independent investment bank, with principal executive offices in New York City, Paris and London. Macy's will be just fine!"

"I shorted more M today but called my parents to see if my old room is still available. M doesn't belong over $10. Their business plan failed before covid and it is still failing.

Can someone explain to me why people don't mind driving to Target or TJ max but will not drive to Macy's? Where I live there are like 1 mile apart.
"Going from bad to worseFrom 2015 to 2020, Macy's revenue has gone from $28 billion down to $25 billion. Struggling to get visitors into its stores, it has gone on a campaign of shrinking its physical footprint to try to match its scale to actual demand. This was all before the coronavirus outbreak started. Now, with the incredible change in circumstances, it may need to accelerate its plans to become smaller."
"glad I got out went it went down 10% on Tuesday, I placed a limit order today for 6000@ 11.7, accounting for 22% drop today."
Why such a low volume today?
"Time to start accumulating.It will bounce around here $14-16 for a few weeks. After all the analyst finish their downgrades, it will trend back up. With light inventory levels now, margins are going to be higher. In the next quarter, we'll see China deal compromise; has to be done before election season kicks off. The fed will lower rates by at least 50 basis points. Macys will probably restructure some of their debt; they hinted towards higher lease cost coming yup..."
"Trend line is holding strong, buy the dip and hold.Shorts knew it is reversing and affraid..let's them give us more money.Go mid term long on $M and be reward by end of November..."
57 million shorts on the wall 57 million shorts if 1 million shorts just happened to cover got to make the price rise higher
"at the current conditions it is very2 hard for macys to go up. retail jobs down , i say it will languish at $14-16. Depending on earnings and what are they doing with the earnings. If a lot of them go to shop improvements then macy is as good as slow death."
It's up 1 cent after hours. Looks like Amazon finally bought Macy's for $6.62/share.
Batten down the hatches tomorrow. But know that we are sailing for fortune in the future.
So if this lasts thru the day the shorts get crushed and this goes higher? Please confirm.....
Stock futures up....... M is so ready to move north......
Pinterest has a higher market cap then Macy's they do 500 million in revenues and MAKES NO MONEY...Macy's does $25 billion in revenues and MAKES LOT OF MONEY
amazing one person's opinion can cost the company 400 million in market cap. No new information just more of the same.
Macys is a $22 dollar play tops. The play is over now. I love the comany and missed the last top ... not this time. I also feel its extremely undervalued ($30-35) but macys isnt going past 22 any time soon.
"Amazing how M has traded flat for 6 months. You just keep burning your money, shorts, we can keep at this as long as it takes to have your borrow fees eat away all of your money."
It's not a div play. Put options expire on 6/21.
"Looks like we have a board with more ability to make changes. The board also went from 12 members to 10. The changes can be for the good or the bad but I think that it will be more good than bad on the side of innovation.Joyce Roché, age 74, will retire from the Board of Directors as of the annual meeting on May 21, 2021 in accordance with the Company's director retirement policy. Ms. Roché has served as a director of Macy's since 2006."
"Market edge went to long and strong buy from neutral.The current technical condition for M is strong and the chart pattern suggests that upward momentum should continue. Over the last 50 trading days, when compared to the S&P 500, the stock has performed in line with the market. The MACD-LT is confirming that the intermediate-term trend is bullish. Upside momentum, as measured by the 9-day RSI indicator is positive but is beginning to slow. Over the last 50 trading sessions, there has been more volume on up days than on down days indicating that M is under accumulation, which is a bullish condition. The stock is trading above a rising 50-day moving average. This validates the strong technical condition for M."
"The shorts were betting the house that M would go bankrupt. They were wrong, now they lose the house!"
"Yesterday was longs' intended consolidation and next week M will go up solidly! An up trend is formed with holidays coming and good progresses in Pandemic treatment.A new article from MorningStar ""33 Undervalued Stocks for the Fourth Quarter"" put M as a top pick in consumer sector.https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1003476/33-undervalued-stocks-for-the-fourth-quarter"
"Rolled thh Dec 6 $15.50 covered calls back to the Dec 6 $15's this morning and picked up .14 more Premium. I'm now sitting with .51 of total Premium by selling the Calls waiting for the .38 ex divy date next week. If I get called out this Friday, I'll immediately buy the stock back to get the dividend. Bought shares at $15.51 on Nov 27 and now my cost basis, including the Premiums and the forthcoming dividend, is $14.70. Shows you the power of combining the selling of covered calls with your dividends."
25 soon. Why would gurofocus post a three week old post again . detrimental to macys
Strong resistance. .75 swing back to positive boys
I saw it $17 after the drop and follwowed the '3 day rule' then it was 14.7 and still held off and its still dropping. I wonder if now is a good time to get in? Also is it better to buy calls or shares? The IV is high and the dividend is huge but I hear they could be cutting it?
People who take the profit now will regret next week. There is crazy demand on this stock. V recovery warrants stock to come back to $17. Which is weeks away. Not months.
"This is pretty comical to hear the ""why Macy's sold off commentary"". ""The stock ran up too far too fast."" I would love to hear an analyst call BS and say purely that Macy's was over-punished in the past by rhetoric of them not being able to adapt to changing climates, the nonsense of cutting the dividend, and garbage of being compared to companies going out of business. The FACTS are the Macy's had a great quarter, and they are adapting on multiple fronts. ""For the second quarter, comparable sales were up 0.5% on an owned plus licensed basis, but when adjusted for the Friends and Family shift from the second quarter to the first, comparable sales were up 2.9% on an owned plus licensed basis for the quarter.""IMO -The truth for the sell off was that large MM sold at the top to collect a nice gain so they could shift their profits somewhere else. The sell-off more than likely spooked a lot of people and also probably triggered some stop quotes, which over sold the heck out of this thing (RSI). The sell off was over done and we found a floor at the 100 day MA. I think this is a nice entry point for the next crawl up, and we will eventually get back to where we were. I like Robert Drbul's from Guggenheim Partners target of $44 as I personally (IMO) think this thing deserves a 10.5 to 11 multiple of projected earnings.

More shorts makes the coming squeeze all the better! Restructuring is expensive which means they have the money! All the negative is priced in and has been. Kepp shorting I'll stay long reinvest the dividend and we'll see who has some folding money in a year.
"Challenge is to grow online, keeping those closed store sales. Macys online is the X factor."
"You guys should really listen to @Robert..just saying, you might want to buy a put or two to cover all those shares you are buying. Macy's won't go up until the fund managers are good and ready for it to happen."

A SUPRISE PROFIT AND 420M more revenue than expected!
"Rumors are circulating that the famous French store company AlFayed is interested in participating with Macy'scan be read today in the French newspaper ""Le Monde"""
Still to many shorts. The covid has caused Macy's to chop at expenses while further strengthening their internet operations. Win-win when their stores fully open to a less competitive environment. Raising my short - intermediate term pt to $22.
ForbesHere's Why Macy's Stock Could Rebound 30% Post COVID-19
THIS STOCK will double at minimum from todays closing price!!
"I find it interesting that Macy's has not yet provided an update on their holiday sales. Usually it's in early January, isn't it? Kohl's sales decreased more than expected so I wonder what that means for Macy's? It doesn't give me much confidence that we're into February and still haven't heard a peep from Macy's."
"The ruling about sales Tax is supposed to help B&M and it will, but the market has rightfully decided that it helps more Amazon than it does to B&M. It is the medium sized companies and mom & pop sellers that are getting hit as they don´t have the infrastructure in place to deal with different sales tax in different states, so they will have to rely on Amazon to provide that for them. That Macys or JC Penny goes down with this makes no sense as they have the infrastructure in place and now consumers will have to pay more for online goods, therefore making B&M more competitive. I bought additional shares today towards the close."
"If we are green pre market futures tomorrow this is a $12 open minimum, GL everyone"
"GMTA,Shorts manipulation is nothing new, but Macy’s is there to stay and big time."
"40% in two days, feel like im on cloud 9 aye longs?"
"Brian, as I assume you are liberal millennial let me let you in on a long known little secret. Perception is reality. If the markets are able to convince the small retail investor that the economy really isn't doing well, then that causes those retail investors from investing and actually pulling money out of the market. This in turns allow the big money boys to drive the prices down even further. The news media blows up the fact that people are worried, this in turn creates the perception that maybe the economy really isn't that strong and maybe we might lose our jobs, so maybe we shouldn't spend as much money on Christmas. It is a very cyclical and logical flow that whether or not the economy is strong or not, people can be convinced that it is weak and then it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy."
The retail buzz will continue for a while so as the swings. Retail stocks are most likely continue to go up until and the norm is not good enough.
Awesome Buying OPPORTUNITY!!! $17 CLOSE
"value investing going into 2020. 10% dividend, huge hidden value in Real estate. Bottom is set and big run going into 2020."
"I just want to thank all you sheeps who sold as soon the first news of macys parade cancelation appear jajajajajaja it's not only M of course thank you apple ccl Disney Tesla ....... thanks to all you sheeps who sold just because news came out you acted just like they wanted you to lol it's ok that gave us the fearless new generation of investors the time to learn see form and catch up jejeje those big red lines dont scared me cause that only means the fakes has left and us the lions take the reing, many of you been investing for years but you weaklings instead of resisting until + day you rather jump from the window for example in M case the parade is 2 months away and look how you all act jajajajajajaja life has been so unpredictable that who knows M might do the parade, dont take this the wrong way please someone have to open your eyes .... M I believe in you"
"wow. Dividend rate was 6.28% as off yesterday. Further drop will make it 7+%. ex-dividend date is 6 weeks away. I will just leave it alone,"
"Any bets on volume today? I am betting we break 20 million shares. This is important as well, this will lead to a wide swing in prices today, I will wager that if you knew exactly when to buy and when to sell today that the spread could be as much as three dollars today by close."
"As you guys know.. the dividend goes ex on December 14th - day after tomorrow. I am just going to say something really basic here because I have noticed in other boards that folks don't know this basic stuff about dividend. Dividend is *not* free money. If M closes tomorrow (12/13) at 26.00, then it will automatically open on 12/14 (the ex date) at 25.62. 38 cents that the shareholders get as dividend is subtracted from the share price on ex date - Literally."
"Stop. Yes you, reading through the comments. Forget reading, get buying this stock. This will double post covid $20. Do your research, dont read yahoo comments. This popped today 10%, it's just the beginning"
Did they give any forward guidance? or just talking about another restructuring cost savings but no real progressSeem like alot about nothing and i would be concerned if they do not talk sales forecast?
"S&P up $30+. Other retailers doing very well.I bought this for earnings and that did not go too well.Sold half my position this morning @ $15.35.Still holding 2,500 shares at a $15.86 cost.Thinking that capital can be better deployed elsewhere."
In the future this is the long players:
Im remembering that Billionaire that bought a bunch when is went down to 4 or 5. I bet he is a happy guy today.
Macy’s (NYSE:M) Rating Increased to Buy at Zacks Investment Research
"It would be nice to see insiders, especially the CEO buy more shares at these levels. I hope the blackout period expires soon so we can see some insider activities."
"Buying M at these low prices that shorts are manufacturing is easy, when you know M has an enterprise value and realty worth more than the current market cap! Also, this company that sells $25 B annually is putting into play their latest initiatives to reduce costs and pay down the debt while increasing productivity with software, and finishing their program to improve the drawing appeal of stores with major improvements store wide on those stores that produce over 50% of their sales (and that is now complete for this holiday season), while also bringing in new low priced (Backstage) garments, and pre-warn garment deals on hot brands, plus, greatly enhancing their catalogue offerings with high margin third party vendors, and all the rest of they holiday program effort. You know their new software that will let them better manage inventory will reduce costs and enhance profits, and when this all hits the bottom like, they shares will get back to $40. For now, however, the shorts can push on a string, but the company is solid and way under priced, and no one is chasing a dividend. That dividend is just icing on the cake for a smart buyer that runs the numbers and figures out how under valued M is. I like the long side of the argument here and can wait while I collect the dividends that the shorts will be paying out if they dare to hold their short positions that long, LOL."
ALL of Macy's competitors soaring today. KSS UP 10%!! Macy's 2% struggle has longs happy lol. Give it up. Macy's is too leveraged to high interest bonds. Pre-covid profits of $1B but needs to pay $7B plus over 2.5 years.
good move closing those stores. Lean and mean is where it's at today. A lot of ideas to throw around.
"Moving too much in premarket, so may skip first trade attempt. Pivots at $6.10 and then $5.65."
"Yahoo shows PE of 4.8, is that a mistake? Payout ratio under 50%, dividend looks safe."
"When is the next dividend payout, and how much per share? Thanks..."
Periodic investing is a very sound strategy.Now is a great time to add M to your cache.
After hours action looks good.. hope the earnings follow the KSS trend and good outlook :)
Now above the 50 day moving average. My target is $18.86 to fill the gap on the chart. I think we can do that after they report earnings.
"in kings plaza Brooklyn New York, shoppers a lot more than last year in last weekend, I think Macy's have very good started in March,"
"Buy as much as you can at these prices........ Macy‘s is so oversold and in the mood to catch-up north......... Annual meeting tomorrow Friday, 15th May 2020.......... short-squeeze coming up.......... whatever it takes........."
I’ve traded Dillard’s at 3Back in March 2009 then the stock skyrotted over $10 in a matter of two months. Macy’s has better cash position than Dillard’s back in 2009
"Yes, Charles Schwab, I want to buy 1,000 shares of Macy's (M). I got an insider tip it's going to skyrocket!"
ALMOST EVERY STOCK HAS HAD A DATA BREACH AND WENT ON TO NEW HIGHS. TGT TJX DIS. ALL ABOUT EARNINGS AND FORWARD GUIDANCE.
"W hat happen to when wall street told one of their cheap writer to put a positive report on Macy's lease hold buildings that the lease hold alone would fetch $42.00 ,as usual fake news from wall street"
"UPS actually halted deliveries (temporarily) of GAP, Nike, Macy's and other high volume clients due to overload. That has to be good news for Macy's if nothing more than online volume is high!"
"hovering right around the 50 day, this is a key level to break to start an uptrend"
45% of the small 293M Float has been shorted. Just incredible #!! Can you say short squeeze?
I believe Macy's PT will be $32 by April 15th.
"think fashion and look good when you go out and see friends... do you think of Target what? Walwho? Kmart cheap cheap! Kohl who? Amazon yeah right! Do you tell your friends you bought jewelry at Walmart cheapo? No No No.... You want luxury and save face! You think of Macys and Nordstrom... At a cnigh out at club, wedding, company parties or potluck... imagine you show off driving a Toyota or a Mercedes? If Mercedes imaging you show off wearing pants and shirts and make up and jewelry you bought at Walmart or online at Amazon? I don't know about you but my wife prefer Macys and so do I.... so unless you decide to move to a 3rd world, this is America and everyone wants luxury even the homeless guy down the street asking to work for food! Ask if he prefers if given a choice from Walmart of Macys and he will tell you .... but you choose Walmart? I don't think so unless you are lying...."
"All retail stocks are down today. Again, a person should only buy Macys stock if they plan on waiting long term 1-3 yrs. Macy's is in the process of changing things for the better which doesn't happen overnight. Long term investors will make money in the end. Let the stock continue to drop; who cares at this point since you are hopefully waiting long term. If not then walk away already, lol. Go Macy's!"
I’m amazed how this market is whipping around on reports. The media feeds off of negativity and likes to hype things up. Are we slowing down a little? Probably. But overall things are not the doom and gloom being portrayed. This is where smart investors make money but you have to have a strong stomach for days like today. This has been a value trap as of late but it’s going to turn soon and make some people a lot of money. Not to mention a huge dividend right now if you are looking for income. I’m holding.
Outstanding day. No resistance until $29-30 level.
Last few days closed green plus above average volume.
Regular dividend declared.Can lock-in a 11% yield

"A 10% dividend is never safe, even if the company can afford to keep paying it, they usually won't."
"Just remember once the market anticipates good news, it's often priced in beforehand. The stock market and retail stocks including Macy's are so priced for perfection that they had better hope that retail sales beat expectations all year and that every piece of news is perfect. I wonder what will happen if Macy's misses their whisper number of $0.40 by even one penny?Market has already priced in a complete return to normal travel, shopping, employment etc later this year. Anything less could be considered disastrous by the market."
"Earnings good enough to ensure any catalysts this month have potential to drive us up—I.e. there is growing confidence in the company. If this was a poor performance, I think we would have been waiting until next earnings report with little potential for price change."
expect a great month for Macy's. Congrats to all who are getting in on the cheap.
Earnings growth and dividends. I’ll sleep like a baby tonight.
Macy’s on Michigan Ave jammed
what about buyback shares?? when if not now?
This great news!!! Sorry shorts but longs i would skim some profit off the top before a pullback... if this opens mid 10’s or even 11’s i HIGHLY recommend taking a bit of profit. That from over 20 years of trading.Nothing goes straight up without a pullback.We ALL know Macy’s will be a $20 stock again.
Is Macy’s to high too fast? Time to short this one?
shorts
will this reach 20$?
Bankruptcy is not a focus for Macy’s at this time. But the decision to take on billions in debt for the historically financially conservative company is a sign of the pressure it is facing amidst the eugenicists pandemic ;)
"hey i thought this was going to 10? where are our oracles matthew, michael, or freedom? (all the same guy actually)"
"Certainly, the next quarters from 3rd to 4th and on will be improving significantly from this covid storm ravished ones.All next year expect improving numbers. Wall Street buys in advance of improving figures and improving story like Macys."
Check the volume - very low - this is day trader shorties playing around. Wait until next week - bargain price and 7% dividend will be too hard for the big boys to ignore.
"* Earnings per share: 27 cents, adjusted, vs. 14 cents expected* Revenue: $5.40 billion vs. $5.41 billion expected * Same-store sales: up 3.3 percent, on an owned plus licensed basis, vs. growth of 2.8 percent expected"
did anyone here was expecting Macy's to beat expectation?? at least their sales match expectations which is a good signs going forward. I'm buying more shares. $16 by December
$26 to $28 by Christmas
"19.50, I will come back in, exdivy date is coming up quick. Should never have fallen below that. >:( I see a parade in the near future :)"
real estate worth much more than 10.5b
Fell sorry for any shorts left with this bullish chart.
Ready for the epic squeeze tomorrow!
"Macy's executive compensation should be performance-based, based on the difference in market capitalization between Macy's and Kohl's.If we don't reduce our debt, we will lose the company of which you are so proud."
"Broad market rally today, Friday, with DJI up .56%, the NSDQ up .70% and the S&P500 up .4%, and the S&P500 hit an intraday all time high. Personally, I think their is very strong odds in favor of a year end rally, unlike last year when the market suffered a sharp correction. I won't go into all the reasons again, but my analysis is that, if there is a rally, it is going to be up about 10% from here. So, as a speculative thought piece, which one should take with a grain of salt, since this sort of thing is just one scenario, I offer the view that M will participate with its PPS moving up in that hypothetical rally. So, how much might it move up if there is a 10% rally in the broad averages from here.In the rally today, M was up 1.23% as it closely followed the retail group represented by XRT which was up 1.07%. As you guys know I contend M is oversold and undervalued, and heavily manipulated by the short interest. So, suppose these relationships hold for such a rally. M is part of the S&P500 which rse .41% today while M rose 1.23%, or 2.86 times the amount the S&P500 rose on a day it hit a all time high. Using this sample as a talking point, that could imply that a 10% rise in the S&P500 in a year end rally could translate into a 28.6% rise in M, just going on the broad market as a catalyst for M's PPS move. Today's closing price for M is $15.58, so applying a possible 28.6% rise, that would yield a PPS for M after such a rally of about $20.03. In other words, M would close the upside gap around $18-$19 and tack on another dollar. That is a nice return, should it come to pass, especially while you earn a 9.69% dividend (which is the theoretical yield based on today's close.)Now, it happens that the M's board has just today, after the close, declared the next quarterly dividend of $37.75 payable to those owning the stock on Dec 13, as I have been contending they would do. So add that to the approximately $4.50 that I have estimated M will return in improved PPS. Very nice.Then try to figure out if M will beat expectations in the next quarterly announcement, if it will pay down the debt, improve earnings, sales, margins or free cash flow. Anything that changes the sentiment on Ms will likely double (or more) these estimates, IMO.Have a good weekend, and do your due diligence and buy M before it runs."

Wait for the dividend announcement and fly to 20!. A wonderful double beat.
"As of May 30, 2015, Macy's operated 888 total stores under the Macy's, Bloomingdale's, Bloomingdale's Outlet and Bluemercury brands. Of those, Macy's outright owns the building and the land of 446 locations. It leases the building and land for 309 locations, and four locations are stores where Macy's owns much of the building and land but there are also leased premises.That investor values Macy's real estate at $21 billion In 2015 and Real Estate has gone up since then!"
bought my ticket to the moon! good luck longs!
Easily $40 stock.... 20 billion in sales and 5 billion market cap?.... Max chart shows this trading above 60 at one point in time... I'm all in... I like macy's .... the women are hotter.... than wal=mart... or amazon.
"Macy's continues to impress. Strong opening then sold off and worked its way back above 37 for another strong day withabove average volume 9mm +. Now the midterms are over and we've passed the outer reef of political unrest, M should push higher as the Holiday Season unfolds. I'm personally long the Jan 40 calls and think we'll see a blowout Christmas season."
"WAKE UP SHORTY, COVER NOW! RED ALERT"
Short-Interest Reduced from 158.6-M to 143.7-M -9% to 46.7% while volume has all-but disappeared as the YO-YO effect continues.
Macys has regularly beaten earnings expectations quarter after quarter with great regularity and the one exception was the 2nd quarter this year. That was due to their decision to heavily discount inventory and clear it out to normal levels to position them for the more profitable 4th quarter.
you can buy same goods at Walmart or target sell Macy's
17 is coming
The run has just started for retailers and metals.
"dear god, the shorts are just giving it to this stock lately. for as bullish as everyone was on this stock last year, its pretty much the exact opposite now. the loss on the most recent inventory was definitely bad, but revenues were in line with last year and it's got half the share price. unreal. hopefully management stops sitting back idly and does something to HELP the shareholders. a div cut would not be that."
"""Are you in talks with Amazon"" - ""I'm not going to comment on that"" Macy's CEO"
The CEO is coming up on CNBC at 1pm today. Do you think this had any affect of the stock this afternoon?
Freedom says Macy's is overvalued yet the company does 25 billion in revenue. Freedom go buy some bitcoin where you can speculate about your future. Just know when you are broke a solid company like Macy's will still be here.
"As of 2015, Macy's was the largest U.S. department store company by retail sales. As of February 1, 2020, there were 551 stores (613 boxes), including 11 flagships (16 boxes) and 385 magnets (431 boxes), for a total of 396 core stores (447 boxes), and 96 neighborhood stores (102 boxes, for a total of 549 full line stores, including 212 that feature Backstage, 20 that feature Bluemercury and 36 that feature STORY), 49 furniture galleries (54 boxes), 4 furniture clearance centers and 6 freestanding Backstage stores with the Macy's nameplate in operation throughout the United States, Puerto Rico, and Guam.[1][3] Its flagship store is located at Herald Square in the Manhattan borough of New York City. The company had 130,000 employees and earned annual revenue of $24.8 billion as of 2017.Macy's has conducted the annual Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York City since 1924 and has sponsored the city's annual Fourth of July fireworks display since 1976. Macy's Herald Square is one of the largest department stores in the world.[5] The flagship store covers almost an entire New York City block, features about 1.1 million square feet of retail space, includes additional space for offices and storage, and serves as the endpoint for the Thanksgiving Day parade. The value of Herald Square has been estimated at around $3 billion. I would bet to the right business would pay twice as much 6 billion if not more for that size of property in NY! Macy's is here to stay don't let these negative articles scare you! Hold this will be around 25 to $50 in a few years! Good Luck To All!"
"While confirmed cases are on the rise in the U.S. the virus appeared to be killing fewer people than it infects, The New York Times reported Friday, which experts said could be due to testing, treatment and “a shift in whom the virus is infecting!”CNBC July 4th"
10 soon for sure in 2-3 week
"Do you wonder why it's so hard for MACY'S to go higher and who is shorting all the shares of Macy's. It's easy to see just look at the SC 13G's and it shows the Vanguard , State Street and most of the biggest Wall Street firms are all shorting Macy's and working against their own customers that own the funds that hold the shares long.Here is Vanguard, Mains Street own the shares in their funds but Vanguard is shorting all the shares for themselves against their own customer , Makes you not want to have any money in Vanguard when they are working against you. Here is State Street, Mains Street own the shares in their funds but Vanguard is shorting all the shares for themselves against their own customer , Makes you not want to have any money in State Street when they are working against you.You can see by the voting power that all the shares have been shorted.http://archive.fast-edgar.com/20200213/AV2YT222Z22XV9I2222A2ZY2DUMKZZ222222http://archive.fast-edgar.com/20200212/ASBZC22C8C22S2ZZ272A22ZZ38MTZ2T2ZB22"
The Macy’s at my local mall is full! Everyone is buying gifts for Mother’s Day
My prediction is it goes up or down 
"GME is shorted at 140%, M is shorted at 35%. Big difference. But option day is looming"
"7.4% yield. Solid balance sheet. Can monetize property if needed. Same store sales stable / slight growth. Will be one of the retail survivors which should equate to higher market position. Insiders buying at higher levels than this. Seems more like this is setting up to be a nice long term play if you can stomach the short term market pain. Hard to time a bottom. Sure, it could go lower but you’re literally a tweet away from market sentiment turning."
Insurance premiums skyrocketing for Macys. Forced to close its Chicago stores.
Macys = New GamesStop?   SNORT!!!!            
Amazon could purchase MACY's for $21
"sold some 15.50 covered calls for .37 cents, bought in at 15.38. they expire this week. I feel that I left alot of profit on the table but I wanted a little safety"
Anyone else find it so amazing how the analysts and the financial news media try and paint this bleak picture for the upcoming Christmas season for retail because of the trade wars yet they pump the heck out of Apple even though it has the greatest exposure to China for over 20 percent of its revenues and nearly all of its supply chain. Simply amazing.
Real estate alone is worth $40 per share. This gotta be the buy of the year.
company needs to add sole buybacks and this thing will pop
"shorts way over extended and good economic news in the making. Beat earnings, China trade wars getting resolved, huge Real estate value. 10% dividend. Bug buy back coming. the good news just keeps coming. $25 by the New Year!!"
Breaking good!
I keep telling you guys target and walmart both sell food A little birdy told me someone big was looking at macys
I expect a pull back tomorrow for some near term profit taking. Next week is anyone's guess though.
"Lowe’s and Target getting it done this morning. Big holiday surge coming next week, div is coming in December plus is covered. Real estate backstops stock price as collateral, debt is right sized. What’s not to like. Undervalued gem."
Macy's is doing a lot of advertising. I have noticed an up tic for a month.
No need to go below $7 cause Hot-Shots Paid $7.00 (+$0.32 Average) just to break even. lol
I like M but I and others warned everyone. The exuberance shown here caused me to buy back a very few shares regardless but.... - Pete
I had planned on selling a covered call $14 1/29. Glad I decided to install a ceiling fan first.
"We reached the bottom, get in now for the recovery"
"Seriously, Macy's should be at $30. Gift at this level. Take advantage of the street's ETF preoccupation. Not all retailers are created equal."
M= 21.65 + 37 cents dividend pay on June 14 = 22.02 . Please do not sell less than $22.02 as of now!
First time starting higher since earnings. Clear sign we're going higher. Buy.
I have been watching this lately and wanted to get in under 15. Doesn't look like I will make it. Good luck to all as I think it will head north.
what happened today?
"Well, was wrong on this one. Congrats longs. By the way, what's up with the 11.50 call option price? Is that normal?"
"It looks like a bunch of schoolchildren trying to spread the paper with their tweets. Do not be fooled, it is too early to buy it, wait for at least a report on Christmas sales, I'm afraid it will surprise you very unpleasantly, be careful, take care of the deposit."
"This is where real investors jump in, great bullish chart, earnings beat, positive change in management and plans, upgrades from analysis's. Macy's you are doing it! Best of luck to all investors."
MACY will jump up tomorrow!!! New BUY upgrade target $14! Sector leader will win!!!
We don't divvy for stock to go up... Macy is now a growth company...
Today Russia approved the first proven highly effective coronavirus vaccine in the world!It has been certified and tested and ready for use by the general public.Putin announced his own daughter was given two doses and it has worked perfectly making her immuneto the coronavirus having developed antibodies in abundance.Expect Macys and KSS and other hard hit stocks to fully recover to precovid prices as will their earnings and sales.
grossly undervalued
Macy can see $25+ by end of June 2021 with vaccines mean more people will shop including myself. M is only shy a few bucks from it resistance level of 21.75. If we can see this and it hold at this level or more. We can see $25-30 just around the corner for Macy.
But they do have a lot of real estate in valuable locations acquired many years ago.
SORRY CHARLIE AS A INVESTOR AND NOT A TRADER I JUST COULD NEVER SELL A STOCK W A 10% YIELD BRAND NAME FRANCHISE TRADING AT 5-6 TIMES EARNINGS.
"Was Tuesday ex-dividend day? I don'T follow this stock much, so this is a simple question. Does anybody know?"
Amazon.....No one saw the MGM buyout coming. No one will see the Macys buyout coming as well
"if the exact same pair of shoes cost $99 at Macy's and $79 at Amazon, would you pay the extra $20 to drive to the mall, wait in line and get the pair of shoes?"
"While the Fed discusses the overall strength of the economy and tries to justify a reason for cutting rates which I believe is completely wrong, the markets are able to drive the retail sector and fashion sector to new lows rivaling the days of the Great Recession. We have Macy's, Dillard's, Nordstorm's and Kohl's (let alone another two or three dozen major brands) selling for P/E's under 10, that is simply unbelievable. This isn't a Macy's story, this is a retail story, which completely defies logic given the strength of the economy and the consumer."
can i enter macy at this price??
As we reach the closing Bell and rapidy close in on 15.50 id like to remind all the shorts that it's cheaper to close out now
"I was just looking at last quarter's cashflow statement Macy's repurchased $1m in shares!!! While that's next to nothing for a $4.8B company, it could mean more repurchases/dividends in the future!!!"
The more the sales these retailers have the more the stock prices are flushed down the toilet. It makes perfect sense.
Likely soon an analyst raises to buy. Who will be the first?
Looks like its going to be an interesting day!
"The cut in corporate tax rate to 21% would have added 27.8% to 9 month earning. Adding in the estimate for the 4th quarter, the impact totals a gain of $0.91 if applied retroactively.The tax cut will be a big,big wind in Macy's back for 2018"
"Happy Black Friday. The stores are selling. M is doing well, the stock is up over 3% and rising. Today M will close over $21 and may even hit $22."
"Carlos, you would probably carry a bit more weight if we could believe anything that you said, your post fourteen days ago from the AMRX site:Carlos T.14 days agoIf they can keep climbing 8 cents per day for the next 24 trading days then I will break even.Reply2The stock price was around 2.80 when you said that, if it takes eight cents times 24 days to make you whole again, then you were down by 1.92 a share, so you would need a share price of 4.72, while it has made a nice move on speculation of a buy out, you are still in the red on your holdings according to your own post."
"Institutional holdings just went past 90% with latest filings. That up 10% in three months. Once their buying stops, shorts will be covering against other shorts, creating panic buying/covering."
book value is over $20 per share. Am I missing something?
Kohl drops like Macy too!
Macy's has a lot less competition now. This will help margins incredibly. Being the largest department store around is going to give huge leverage over vendors and manufacturers. Cost of goods and operations will decrease while lease agreements with landlords will be more favorable. Stock may see 40s in less than 2 years.
15 coming soon
awesome jump...
Book Value means nothing anymore not on a Collateral LOAN/Bond where Macy's hasta Pay 8.375% interest (Junk-Rates) and Lease-back their own Property for $150-Million a year.
Every dime is worth $1200 for me$1500 monthly dividends are a bonusWish me luck
"I just finished looking through \wallstreetbets on Reddit, they seems to be about 14 days of discussion on the short position of Macy's. Momentum appears to be gaining to team up against the investor who are shorting Macy's. I found it interesting that there is a lot of conversation about what a great corporate citizen is Macy's has been (examples include Parade, 4th of July, Black History month, LGBTQ, and other social responsibility initiatives). People really like this company and are pointing out how the large short position is due to a handful of hedge funds to are profiting from manipulating the stock to the short side. Reading Reddit, I learned alot about what goes on behind closed doors.They are talking about the move up from $14 to $22 last week just on the fear that there will be a short squeeze. I don't know exactly who owns large short position (34%^) but the assumption is that they will fold fast with any large concentrated buying.No target set yet, from what I can tell, go on and look for yourself and let us know if you find more. I am not great an navigating Reddit."
The share price falls until it doesn't then the dividend cuts then it will either find a way to comebackor just close uptoday it was Modells tomorrow it will be some other chain
"People are reading the report negatively.Sales at stores are down but increased online.Thanksgiving and christmas are around the corner......people usually hold off and don't buy as much in September and October.Also, we can expect another round of stimulus before elections + vaccine news.The worst case scenario which isn't very likely for Macys is that we will have to wait another quarter.We would be beating ourselves later on if we don't buy at this price."
"My wife eBuying 3 stores only, never never others.1. Macy2. Walmart3. Costco"
A great buy! Just grabbed some in pre m before price jummps up today and Monday a great deal even if it takes a bit to get back to double digits. People have to remember 20 plus million Americans are still working Corporate and office jobs from home right now who shop here and will go to the stores.
Macy's one of the top 10 ecommerce in the usMacy's one of the only retailers to survive...
"Stores closed 50 percent of quarter and revenue down only 35 percent. Great management!Not until June 15th were most open again. Visited stores. They are very attractive, modern, clean and well stocked with excellent well priced merchandise and many friendly and helpful employees.Analysts are way too negative missing fact that Macys one of the survivors of Corona has a massive opportunity to achieve huge growth in the future due to all the bankruptcies Stock holders who are patient will profit handsomely"
M hit 16.88 twice since the low trying to go back up.Will the 3 rd time be the charm and blow thru into close?????
Very rational exuberance.
shorts covering before they have to pay the dividend
"The REAL reason for the general stock sell off is stocks are generally too highly priced with crazy valuations on TESLA, MSFT,AAPL. Facebook, UBER, etc... and ALSO people are realizing that Trump is going to LOSE in 2020 and are running for cover.And they are right a Democrat will be the next President and likely it will be Sanders.President Elect Sanders 2020."
"Almost an hour now at 25.88 and 25.87 that's impressive even with almost 400k shares traded in the last five minutes, it didn't break up past 25.88. That's bearish. The longer it stays down, the more likely it'll continue down."
I’m not scared. Double down.
The sum of the parts = more than $17! No brainer.
I bought Macy gift cards this year to give out at Christmas.
"If you sell you will never see the GameStop effect. You will also be doing a disservice to all your HARD Working fellow investors. Crush hedge shorts, they can go back to Target and Costco"
"Macy's Stock Is Not A BuyMacy's stock has largely fallen since 2015, badly lagging the S&P 500. M stock is not in any kind of base to offer a potential entry. Along with the coronavirus, its traditional retail business faces threats of all kinds. Analysts forecast Macy's earnings to fall this fiscal year.Bottom line: Macy's stock is not a buy right now.Check out IBD Stock Lists and other IBD content to find dozens more of the best stocks to buy or watch."
I am in Seattle this week for business. I just saw on the morning news Macy's is closing their Downtown Seattle store. I bought more Macys yesterday at $15.20.
"News Alert: June 25 (Reuters) - Macy's Inc said on Thursday it would lay off about 3,900 employees in corporate and management positions to help lessen some of the financial strain of dwindling sales due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Macy's said it expects to save about $365 million from these layoffs in fiscal 2020."
When is ER?
will not sell before 40$
People talk about Amazon all the time if online is the way to go forward. No one king has ever ruled the entire world. This is called marketplace. Online audience is the most volatile one as they spend less time for their needs. Clearly shown today by Macy's by tapping into online online audience when they focused on it. Combination of online and offline presence is the way to go forward even Amazon understands that now
Has the market done lost it's mind.. they earned $2/share in a QUARTERwow... bought more yesterday... will be patient with this one.. will be a 4X return - no doubt
Close above 9 overcame options expiration selling pressure is very good.
"Can't imagine they will ever close all stores, the one near me is always busy. My opinion Macy's is just as good if not better than Kohl's."
"Pre-market is up:-) Go Macy‘s go! Time to regain some territory! Annual Shareholders Meeting this Friday, 15th May 2020. And all 775 stores/malls reopened by mid June the latest."
"Freedumb I am long I have own Macy's for almost 10 years. Covid was a blessing for a company like Macy's. Macy's can now close underprefoming stores. They have over 500 stores that is more then Target, Home Depot etc. The key is buy a company and hold. Most longs in Macys have a cost under $8 and are waiting for dividends to come back"
"I just bought 1,000 shares. Make Macy's Great Again!"
"Nomansky told me I was going to lose big buying my 12,000 shares at $14.40 . Do you remember me now- Nomansky? You promised $9 before $17"
KSS also was negative premarket after earnings. Some were posting here a drop of more than 30 percent down. Instead KSS soared up $3.01 at the close.Macys will likely be up on the day too!Great results!
HOW can ULTA beauty be worth more then Macy's?? $5 billion in revs vs. 25 billion..No real estate vs. 20 billion worth..etc etc etc
"NYC enterring Phase 2 on Monday with retail stores reopening. Sales will increase exponentially for Macy's & Bloomingdale's. Retail Sales are also expected to grow substantially for June & July. $10 soon. At these low share prices, Macy's is a great value with great rewards. LGM!"
"Anyone else find the drop in retail very surprising today? Sure Amazon is ""tanking"" but not because of weakness in the consumer or even because of a weak Christmas. It is tanking because of the realization that brick and mortar are not only surviving the onslaught of on-line, many are thriving and competing very well in the sector themselves. Also, we have a jobs report that almost doubled what the experts were forecasting, and even better yet we had an INCREASE in the unemployment rate, foretelling the rising job participation rate to the highest levels since 2013 and this number continue to climbs. We also saw last week that wages are again growing and that the fears of stagnation of wages is now a diminishing concern. Nothing in the news to include the very good sales numbers from both Visa and Mastercard imply that a recession is impending or that consumer sentiment is waning. This is the strongest economy that we have seen since possibly the second Reagan term."
Guys what do you make of this stock? Price looks decent but will they reopen and give dividends again after the virus ?
"Here's what I have come to realize about Macy's... a month ago I thought it's going to be a relatively easy short. I put up 2 year charts, I compared M to BBBY... and I still stand by most of it. However, I am not here to fight the market. It's clear that market agrees neither with my bearish theory nor with the bullish theory of some of you guys. IMO - an investor's biggest fight is against his own biases. I have my reasons to be biased against M but I must also realize that my theory hasn't played out like I thought it would."
Goldman Sachs bidding this down today. They have large bid they keep lowering by $.10 as the stock drops. Buy once they cancel that bid if you are day trading this. They did same thing yesterday; canceled right after 1pm.
When shorts will have to admit they've been wrong... This will be pure magic
"Went to Macy's Stamford CT yesterday, fully packed... and surprisingly most crowd was looking for formals... I guess people need well-fitted clothes as offices starting to resume"
Going back to the 20s
"Ascena will shut down its Dressbarn women’s apparel division, closing all 650 stores. The parent of Ann Taylor, Loft, and other women’s apparel brands said that despite revival efforts, Dressbarn’s profitability was still short of acceptable levels. Less competition for Macy !"
"I'm not long on Macy's still, and my positioning is complete.Macy's between 5.80 - 6.20 is interesting to me.I think Macy's will survive, and next year after a vaccin it will run up 100%-150% is my expectation. Goodluck."
The amount of Eric's in the conversations is positively correlated to the price in the next few months.
"I see that the shorts are still at it, trying to bill Macy's as a company in crisis, while nothing can be further from the truth. M's fall from over $20 was unjustified, and unexpected, but this is the way the stock market works, expect the unexpected. Buying and holding long term is the only way you win, it has always been the only way you win in the stock market."
"I got my $1400 stimulus this morning and I'm not travelling 2 hours and 20 minutes to my nearest Macys (Fayetteville, NC). I looked at their website and wasn't impressed. Nor the half a billion in bond sales. M is the next JCP. CEO should buy M shares to prove a point."
"PIR, KSS, LB, BBBY all reported worst than expected store sales this past holiday. M on the other hand reported better than expected store comps at just .7% decline. Once all said and done, M results is going to seem alot stronger in the department store sector."
The days of cheap shares are over!
Just let me get my money back 
"Another thing I saw before buying M was a drop of 6 million short shares in 30 days. Today I bought 200 more shares adding to my 500 bought early this week.My gut feeling is, in the next 12-16 months, my normal holding time, this will be a winner."
"It's not fair for it go down on a beat. If it was a miss, I understand. But why it had to go down on a beat. It's like you have a blackjack in the cards and the dealer telling you lost."
"Macy‘s at $5,12 (+6,67%) in pre-market....... oversold and so ready to spike....... trend-change on the menu......."
"I am very certain of a massive gain in Macys stock this year! Retail sales during the holiday season were record breaking during covid! Total sales during Oct, Nov and Dec 2020 were much higher than 2019 when no covid existed and we had higher employment!Very impressive!!!!!2021 we are off to the races!!"
"Board of Directors TAKE NOTE of BBB ! They recognized the need for change in leadership and brought in a dynamic leader that has vision and “IS. A AGENT OF CHANGE “ who does not “ move around the deck chairs on a sinking ship” . But, rather makes bold decisive meaningful changes that move the needle.... ( reducing inventory by 15% ... cleaning house ...increasing t/o and cash flow). Not like JG who makes small distracting moves that garner press but don’t alter the future of M ..His moves are tactical and NOT strategic! Time and opportunity are passing Macy’s by...Jeff had his chance and has proceeded to bring shareholder value down by 70%. BOD do your job and get a leader with vision that can present a meaningful strategy and execute !! BOD ‘S ITS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to protect stakeholders and add value.DO YOUR JOB!IT’S TIME !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Buy today and get dividend tomorrow. GLTA longs.
Why would M retire $500m of debt early? Doesn't make sense if it needs to conserve cash.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/macy-inc-announces-early-tender-114000045.html
"Jeff Gennette is a heck of a CEO. He's purchased shares on the open market, he is one of Macy's top shareholders, he continues to adapt to the changing climates, he pursues multiple initiatives with shareholder value in mind (Story, partnering with Facebook, Backstage roll out, lowering debt, continued work to pursue getting more value out of the billions in real estate, etc.). I predict he leads this company much higher."
Buy Macy symbol M Macy's need our help an iconic American who brings us May's pride and Macy's fireworks must be saved !!!!!! Buy Macy's stock now symbol M. Post it everywhere
52 week low coming soon at this rate. Wow.
"You know a company is really badly managed when they give ""delay in bad weather"" as one of the reasons they didn't do well. I am done with Macys for now"
"What's becoming clear from financial news/commentary is that, now that most of the major retailers have reported (we will se what JWN has to say) M is getting recognized as the only retailer to have excellent earnings and demonstrated success in adjusting to the new retail environment including making giant strides in its online strategy. And it pays a better dividend by far than any other. Shorts are going to be in for some pain, especially if JWN has good numbers."
"I guess the sale of 35,000 shares by EO Harper did not instill confidence in M ???????????"
"I am no cheerleader here. I am a new investor, not trading this. As an investor, my first buy is unlikely to be a buy at bottom action. People that go all in on their initial buy seldom buy at the bottom and then become unsettled watching it go lower. I'll wait to buy more. I will look for at least 2 more lower buys. With that, to all stay healthy and profit whether it's short or long. 12:55 PM $4.45"
"What happened to the 5 BILLION BORROWING NUMBER? They are actually cutting debt by 500 million? Seems that way, exchanging 1 billion long term for the 1.5 billion in credit facility."
"Macy today. 310 million shares x $6.76=2,095billion enterprise value. Just the NYC store is worth around 3.5 billion. All the other stores are worth and extra 15 billion. Then there is the value of the business, the credit card business etc. This company at this price is a value dream. If it goes bankrupt, the stock price increases by a multiple of 10."
"GET IN.... ""M"" is going to FLY!!!!!"

I bought some today.
"Can someone help me understand the results on MRNA/PFE? I'm a layperson, and have a hard time parsing this. From what I understand, 7 people who got the vaccine were infected with COVID and showed no symptoms. One person who got the vaccine had severe symptoms.It seems that, of everyone else who got the vaccine, no one was likely exposed to COVID in the first place, so there's no way of knowing whether the vaccine did anything for them. Is that really the case?Is the claim of 95% effectiveness based on 8 people? And how does the placebo group play a role in that conclusion?If someone could explain this to me in a respectful manner, I'd appreciate it."
Debt reduction is important.Pay it all off in 10 years.
"Macy's dividend yield almost 7 % , Walmart's 2 % !"
You all need to read this before buying this stock....www.fool.com/amp/investing/2020/05/25/2-stocks-id-avoid-at-all-costs.aspx
Macy's should just announce that although it has no plans to cut dividends in the near term as previously stated the board has decided to cut the dividend 50% and use 100% of the proceeds for just share repurchases until the stock price reaches a more appropriate valuation closer to book value (currently around 20). Pretty sure investors would be okay with that since the stock price would most likely go up more than 5% and if it doesn't that's just more shares M can buyback. Keep in mind this is not money M would have anyways since dividends are paid out anyways. It also isn't new debt so if need be can be cancelled at anytime.
You might have a few weeks times to lock in profits if you're short.Though after that if actions are taken stability can arise again.
''Ride the waves boys'' - Macy's
Macy’s just declared regular quarterly dividend. So no div cut. No rally in stock either
I think there's a good chance to thing to will pop the 17 early tomorrow
"Let's support American economy, buy your Macy's stock now!"
Ready?
very good results ..Macy is a iconic brand and it will survive and thrive as a Queen the retail sector
Cowen estimates Kohl's and Macy's have about 5 months of liquidity with 100% store closures. Be nice to have exact number from Ghetto Paula and failure Gennette
Earnings return to $2 per share as a conservative estimate.
"Investors have been wanting M to cut the 465M dividend and reduce capex for a couple of years already. Cutting dividend would have signaled weakness that would have certainly tanked the stock. However with the current situation and stock price, it's actually a blessing in disguise to investors and got exactly what they've been wanting. Now the question is will things normalize by Christmas where M makes 85% of its profits bc if it does with the reduced capex and dividend cut along with accelerated store closures and savings i could see M buying back a significant amount of shares at these levels. But that's also unlikely bc sophisticated traders can read the writing on the wall ""M is going to have alot of Cash"" real soon, expect a huge rally on Monday not a sell off."
up 5 days over 40%
Trump said he gave the Middle Class a $12 trillion dollar tax. Why aren't they spending that money?
There are those who will comment only on the days Macy's is down.. they may even criticize my call to cover my short position. Next day the stock is up and they are nowhere to be found. I just saying.
Heads up everyone. Power play coming. $10+ soon after earnings!
The only reason I Don't see this is because i know the day I do it will go to 25. :)
"Was the corporate tax cut the main reason for the last peak? The repayment of debt was the right move, but was too much create given to management? Was it just the right place at the right time situation?"
"This is a Buying opportunity. Kohls, Target, all down today due to WMT. It will be back up."
"I always liked Macy's. I like to try my clothes on before I buy. I don't like shipping things back. Besides, Macy's has good unadvertised sales. Good at Christmastime."
"Macy's will be fine, but if you want to make 10 X your investment, look at this one :There are plenty of potential ""10-baggers"" available for investors to purchase today.One such company is Omeros Corporation (Nasdaq: OMER). The company is a small-cap biopharma headquartered in Seattle, Washington. The company develops small-molecule and protein therapeutics for application against inflammation, coagulopathies, and disorders of the central nervous system.This is an important development because the continued sales and profits generated by Omidria are needed to power research into Omeros' new drug -- OMS721. Researchers at the University of Leicester discovered mannan-binding lectin-associated serine protease-2 (MASP-2). MASP-2 is a protein involved in activation of the immune system and plays a role in the inflammatory response. It is activated after tissue damage from trauma or infection. OMS721 has great potential to treat patients with lectin pathway activation. years to come -- if approved. And that's enough to kick this stock into the stratosphere."
"So starting at about 10% of store opening at an anticipated 20% of normal traffic. 100% after 6 weeks at 20% of normal. So sales for Q2, 6 weeks ave. 50% stores @ 20% normal sales + 6 weeks 100% stores @20% normal sales = 15% of normal sales per Q2."
M is rocking right now !!!
Shorts be like:
3rd quarter results coming soon :-). Earnings looking better right before 4th quarter which will be even better. Macys continues to make positive moves.
this drop with good earnings is due to slimy Jim Cramer and worthless David Faber who trashed the stock 15 minutes before opening. Faber smirked that growth was not enough and Cramer agreed.
The traders say quick rebound to 17.5 area. I will holdout for 25-35 pps. think dividends maintained and raised from time to time since 2002. so NO CUT BANK ON IT IMO.
"When a friend told me he was getting at least one solid pick every week from a certain program I was skeptical. Anyway, I checked out (http://Stocks-tracker.com) and haven’t looked back since. Join them."
it is going to hit 20 pretty soon... because vaccines are here...Stock going up anticipating future earnings...
"Amazon delivery system is broken! Takes months to get an order filled. I ordered May 21st pajamas and they said it would be delivered August 7th! Of course I cancelled the order and bought it from their competitor Macys and received delivery in 3 days. Amazon's delivery system is slow, and broken now that I could have ordered something in the 18th century and got it faster with Pony Express. Hilarious! That's how bad Amazon delivery system has become! Terrible! I am not ordering Anything Amazon again until they fix this problem. Who is going to wait weeks, or months to get something you can go in person and get immediately at your local Macys? Macys also delivers ONLINE in just a few days not weeks or months!"
$15 looks promising before the year ends. Another dip to $8 will be your LAST CHANCE before it takes off!! Positive earning is on deck for next quarterly report.Dont bet against M
"If Macy's didn't make it as a fashion and kitchen, home and bath mega-store, who will? It is the inheritor and gatherer of the large department store business, and almost all of its competitors have gone under. Kohl's shoppers have always been lower price people, Neiman-Marcus is belly up, so is Lord and Taylor, and Nordstroms and Saks are fancy people/money is no object stores. JCP and Sears were, and Target is, downscale of Macys for fashion. There's no one else in the middle anymore but Macy's. Thoughts?"
"Exit Macy's completely today. I know it's still undervalue and given market it might go to $35+ But my all stocks that I stay in keep going down. $UAA just gone down I should exit when it reach $16+ but was hoping for $18. If market sentiment change, this might go back to $22 range."
This short squeeze will continue as it approaches its pre covid price. Good luck to all.
"The fourth quarter is the time for cash flowLike most of its peers, Macy's generates the vast majority of its annual cash flow in the holiday quarter. In recent years, the company has typically generated operating cash flow of at least $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter."
"Baron, this is the same GS and MS cronies who were calling for the semi-conductor to fall into a major inventory based recessionary cycle, it never came to fruition even with trade issues and then they both came out with upgrades for the entire sector within hours of each other."
"M close on high of day is positive lets see if can follow through to friday with opex. Also technicals looking good too. Rsi over 50, price above 20 dma, and MACD turned pos today."
"I'm a bull for Macys, I'm wondering if it will report bigtime next quarter when the majority of shoppers going to the brick stores picks up. Comments? I'm considering adding more but not sure to add before or after earnings?"
"We are out of October and into November, a seasonally strong time for the markets. Halloween is over and Thanksgiving is coming, which is leading into the heart of the shopping season for gifts and discounted purchases. Black Friday is coming up. The economy looks really good, with no hint of recession. As insurance, the FED has just finished its third interest rate drop and it has taken the US economy into stimulus mode with a total .75% drop, plus it is expanding their holdings of bonds, another QE move. We know that this type of FED stimulus will lower costs and boost business profits. Whatever you might think about M's long term prospects, this is definitely not the time to push the short side agenda as the odds are tremendously favorable to M's PPS rising in this time of the year, and the chances of a December beat at the next earnings report are extremely high too.The FED action is a major catalyst for M stock appreciation, and there are simply no two ways about it. Don't fight the FED!! Shorts, you should cover as Ms is definitely about to go on a run, IMO. Due your own due diligence and don't be stubborn when the data says markets will rally. M will have an excellent xmas and you shorts are facing mounting pressures. This is the day where it becomes clear you need to cover if you want to avoid losses of profits you may have. Anyone shorting yesterday is in a dire position and needs to cover. I have a friend who is a professional trader on the short side. He is always a nervous wreck. Don't ruin your holiday season. Cover!!!"
M goes Ex dividend on DEC 12 2019 pays about 2.5% and that is more that the 30 year T bill every 3 months. They have more than enough cash flow to keep paying the dividend if they want to. I would be buying back all the shares of M they could. Someone purchased 15 million shares on the close 2 days ago.
wassup uwutube
"Nice day today for M stock. 2.2% gain on 11 million volume. Given all the positives a price of $23 is possible by the end of November. Retail sales are doing well and are only getting stronger. Shorts are going to be losing their assets soon. Higher highs and higher lows, a 2% gain each day will get the price to the correct value. $30 is a reality by the end of December.Have a great Tuesday morning everyone."
"Ok, I'll admit 17 is a positive sign. This earnings report will be more exciting to watch than the parade. That is for sure..."
"Sold all shares. Not acting right and the overall made new highs today. Love the stock, just not the overall market right now. Will be back."
5-10% gain today.
They had some interesting insights about M on http://tradenow.xyz. Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"IS IT TRUE RAD ,JCP,SEARS , MACY'S AND CVS ALL RETAIL STOCKS ARE IN TROUBLE"
"will add 300 shares today :) thanks panicked sellers :) never sold shares without profit, and this time it will be very easy, in few month."
"Miracle on 34th Street, I miss Natalie Woods. What a great movie featuring Macy's. It will make a return soon and so will Macy's stock price. Half price sale on now."
Shorts are working hard to hold the stock down. Not enough power. They will begin covering in mass this afternoon.
"The current CEO has done a great job. He is a long term veteran of Macys and knows it very well. First, thing he did was to end the wasteful, reckless use of funds to buy back half of the common stock, then he diverted that free cash flow to pay off the long term debt of the company and upgrader Macys stores. He successfully stabilized sales, even improving sales and EBITA, net earnings and last year was a great year for Macys. The current CEO also expanded its successful Blue Mercury business to near 200 locations and opened new Macys in better locations and closed poor performing stores in undesirable locations and he wisely slowly closed them as their leases expired so as not to take a hit for breaking leases. A wise retail CEO constantly evaluates all his store locations and closes poor performers and opens new ones at better locations. Retailers have been doing this for hundreds of years. Why is it that when Macys decided to close a mere 30 stores it is big news but Walmart and Target closed HUNDREDS Of stores last year as they do regularly. Target recently closed a store next to where I live. Retailers do this all the time. It is hardly new worth."
"M is way undervalued at 16.4. its book value is rated at 19.6. Management has made effort in buying back debt to increase earnings for share holders. Solid holiday sale would definitely help boosting future share's earning. Minimizing debt, Strong balance sheet, along with its real estate assets and most importantly cutting cost by closing under performed locations would definitely guaranteed its existence and help increasing share price in future IMHO."
"If you look at the technicals, there is an interesting gap between $17.22 and $18.90 which I think has a good chance of filling as we move into the fall. After listening to the CC a couple times, one thing that impressed me that I don't think has been really understood or taken into account is the very strong guidance that management has implemented very strong store metrics for guiding all sorts of decisions in the store that will enhance profitability. I think those will show up in the upcoming quarters and improve performance. These are AI types of guides for management of inventory better and for guiding how to approach issues presented in real time. Could be a big surprise to the upside if their programs work."
This stock yields over 9%. Something has to giveEither the price goes up or they cut the dividend
"I sometimes wonder if these investors realize that if you lose 30% it takes much more than a 30% gain to break even? I don't think so. I sold all of my M at 25 for a 12% loss, I just calculated, had I not sold, I would be down 41.4%. A heck of a lot of good a crummy dividend would have done. I have never once regretted getting out of this sinking ship."
Let’s just hope earnings beat just a little. 
Management team moving this in the right direction. long term this will be a winner.
Shorts have a lot of shares to buy back at this light volume trading rate and a news announcement could come any day. There is only good news from here and that is not good news for short sellers.
"Two weekends ago, I wrote my thoughts on GME and why it was undervalued at $35/share. Then last weekend, I did a follow-up commentary to explain 5 reasons why GME was still undervalued at $65/share and was going to go triple digits. Well, we all know how that turned out. Today I would like to highlight Macy’s (M) and explain why it is undervalued at $15/share.Macy’s is a department store operator with a market cap of $4.7B. If you look at its business the four years prior to 2020, it was fairly stable with revenues during that 4 year period ranging from $25.3-25.9B with EBITDA greater than $2.1B for each year during that period. They were aggressively deleveraging during this period having reduced debt from $7.6B to $4.2B (these number exclude capital leases). Then in 2020, the COVID crisis occurred and Macy’s business suffered mightily as stores were closed due to local restrictions. Management took a number of actions such as raising additional cash, suspending the dividend, cutting CAPEX, closing unprofitable stores, reducing inventory and cutting SG&A. In 2020, sales will likely end up being down about 30% to $17.8B with EBITDA being slightly positive (~$50M). But I would argue that 2020 will be the trough in revenues and earnings for Macy’s. As we move into 2021 and the pandemic mitigates, people will return to shopping in stores and Macy’s sales will start to show Y/Y positive comps as they progress through the year. Current average analyst expectations for 2021 call for M to make $0.65/share.However, I believe that Wall Street is way too bearish on this company. Currently 6 analysts rate Macy’s as a sell with one brave analyst going positive on the company in December with a Buy rating. But if you look at the last two earnings releases, Macy’s blew away analyst’s weak expectations by wide margins with upside surprises of $0.96/share in Q2 and $0.60/share in Q3. With this bearish slant, I believe M will blow away expectations again in Q4. The average analyst expectation only calls for earnings of $0.04/share in the holiday quarter. But I project they will make just shy of $1/share (ex. items) assuming sales come in about $6.7B. Part of the reason for the bearish stance is many of these analyst’s clients are short Macy’s stock.One of the biggest arguments shorts make is the Macy’s in too indebted with high interest debt. But at the end of Q3, M had $1.55B in cash on the balance sheet and had net debt of only $3.8B. The cash level will only improve coming out of the holiday quarter where EBITDA will be greater than $700M. When revenues return to normalized levels, the debt level is <2x EBITDA. With the cash on the balance sheet, they have ample liquidity to cover interest payments of $80M/quarter. Also, no significant debt maturities are coming due in the next couple years that are not already covered by existing cash and future cash flows. Some of M’s debt is secure by their real estate holdings which is valued at double the current market cap of the company.When I look at how they compare against competitors, their stock price currently is priced at a discount. Macy’s sells for a P/S of 0.24 compared with Kohl’s (0.42), Dillard’s (0.43) or Nordstrom’s (0.51). One could argue that share price should be selling for around $30/share to have comparable valuations. But I would argue that Macy’s should have a higher multiple due to their e-Commerce business which made up 38% of sales in the most recent quarter growing at a 27% Y/Y clip. Macy’s is currently the 10th largest e-Commerce retailer in the US (Amazon is #1 and sports a 4.5 P/S). If I look at those on the list that are slightly bigger players, all are brick & mortars and sport much higher P/S ratios, #7 Best Buy (0.62), #8 Target (1.04) and #9 Costco (0.91). If valued with a similar P/S ratio, Macy’s should sell for $38-65/share.Part of the reason Macy’s share price is depressed is because it is heavily shorted. Currently over 28% of the float is short the stock. The shorts are unjustifiable bearish on a company that is undervalued compared to its peer even though has a greater e-Commerce presence and will be returning to profitability in 2021 post COVID. But I think other players in the market will exploit this heavily shorted situation in the near term by pushing the shares higher. Heavy buying of Feb. 19 calls would suggest the price will be pushed higher ahead of the company’s earnings release which will likely happen late in February. If Q4 earnings exceed analyst expectations by a large margin as I expect, we could see a short squeeze due to the heavy short interest.We will see what happens with Macy’s this month and longer term. My contention is it is worth a lot more than $15/share, more realistically it is worth $30-40/share, which is why I am long."
Do not forget to do your proxy vote. There is more than one that needs to be shown the door.
"Carlos, there is a fine line definition between opportunistic selling (short sellers taking advantage of false narratives about a strong economy and a tenuous market) and panic selling. Wall Street would like the average seller to believe your statements, but when you have stocks such as Apple, who sells iPhones for over a thousand dollars, Facebook which relies heavily on advertising from retailers for their revenues, Netflix which is a subscription based video streaming product which is completely discretionary and even Amazon, granted an on-line retailer, but at the end of the day, a retailer all doing pretty decent today. That tells me that Wall Street is merely capitalizing on dropping prices, no fear, just opportunity."
Added at $37.50. Wish I bought more when it dipped last week. But I think we push toward $40 soon.
"With the 5G technology, all stocks will reach to new level high of at least 175% higher from now, which M should be at least $29.75 fair value soon."

You investors should do what Warren Buffet did. Visit the business you are thinking about investing in. I love Macys stores and business and they have excellent employees and a world class top management team. The CEO is top notch.I visited their stores and they are exceptional! Friendly helpful employees and beautiful fully stocked with the finest high end merchandise and incredible prices.This is a winner investment.
"looks like another short squeeze friday to $18 , the redditt team seems to show up every friday on this IMHO"
OK this isn't peanuts... this is about to get back your full investment in about 10 years while tripling the stock price much faster.
Longs waiting for the next week that will never happen. Sub $3 soon
Dividend? perhaps....
Macy's is even trying to absorb higher costs related to tariffs which Cuts into Margins/Profits. lol
Macy's needs an activist to start taking control of this company
"Major shareholders should take note of activist shareholders call to action at BBBY ousting a underperforming CEO..,,.. and the ensuing response to its share price !!!When will shareholders pressure the board to make a change to the leadership of Macy’s whose team has managed to tank its share price from $70 to $15 in short order...( reduced by 60% in ONE year )Shareholder value reduced by 80%... The board worries more about the correct composite of the board than it does about the performance of the management team ..., The board is drinking the cool-aid of management .... TAKE ACTION .... before its to late !!!!"
why after market seems un realistic
Tremendous short squeeze coming!
"And next round of heavy buying starts now! Over $6, then 7, 8, 9, double-digits again.......... Macy‘s WILL survive............ whatever it takes.........."
"If this stock is valued like Tesla of Retail, this stock would be $3000. Just saying."
"Buy M because of the Polaris strategy. It is one third smoke, mirror and borrowing. This combined with digital and Zack's popcorn farts articles will get us over $20 per share again. You've gotta love EBITDA and GAAP Capitalism."
I guess we r at a turning point! No premarket trading. HMMMM
"BOYS....SOMETIMES I EVEN AMAZE MYSELF. 18S BY THANKSGIVING. 20S BY FEBRUARY. BOYS...HOW DO I DO IT??? BRILLIANCE , I GUESS!!! THATS...WHY THEY CALL ME THE ""GREAT ONE"" !!!!"
"People here talking about how MACY'S will survive because it is a part of America. I recall another Department store that was American as apple pie. It was called SEARS. Sentimentality has nothing to do with how Capitalism works. What MACY'S should have done is convert the company into a Real Estate Investment Trust. Now that they have used some of their real estate as collateral for a 5 billion dollar loan, they can't convert into a REIT."
M now becomes a much more attractive target.. :)
"You gotta look at that chart, and say $50 is coming, you just gotta..."
Don't be surprised if a major player surfaces to buy us out -- especially with retail ops improving. Buy all you want below $25 imo.
Does anyone find it strange that the market is tanking but M shot up early and weathered the storm on Friday. Also dipped along with GME and AMC when certain platforms limited trading on Thursday. Foreign investors will soon join the Wall Street game. Something interesting is going on. The M Feb. 18 calls are smoking hot. M's short interest is over 40 percent.
still undervalued waiting for institutions to bid this up before next earnings
will this go up?
"Just don't SELL, keep buying more in chunks...this will be pushed much higher.."
I’m scurred to wake up tomorrow and check lol I have 1000 shares at 6.10 so I think I’ll still make money and hold unless otherwise but let’s just keep it going up cool? Cool
"In Herald Square, a busy intersection just blocks away from Madison Square Garden and the Garment District, hundreds of looters forced their way into a Macy's department store in the presence of police. Several were taken out the retailer's New York flagship store in handcuffs."
M opens at $17.25.....flying day for Macy's......big move up indication
Remember these days... when it hits $40 it will feel that much better. There is no pleasure without pain!
"Post Covid will be a shopping time for everyone. No more online purchase and returns. People would like to come out and have a wonderful shopping experience after the break. This will subsequently increase this stock beyond the 52 week maximum price. Long term investors - continue to hold. For sure, as per my analysis, this will cross $20 by Feb 2021"
People forget how wildly profitable retailers like Macys can be!
"Here’s some info Nomansky: the Harold square property alone is valued at $3B, the entire market cap today is $1.8B. Book value is over $20 a share, the share price today is $6. Also Macy’s has been a profitable company every year for the past 10+ years. Need I go on?"
"Not too worried here, shorts better cover, this will continue to rise. Might not be overnight but will continue to over $30. Way undervalued. Really happy with earnings and restructuring."
The new plan to increase for traffic in malls WILL work!
I predict a nice spike into todays close........... Big boys have Macy‘s on the radar now. And want this to go to double-digits. You heard it here first..........
I love my position in Macy's.
"WHY SELL, GET THAT 10% DIVIDEND."
"Very undervalued, online sales booming, retail sales booming, this price is an insult."
Any guess on price of this when they report earnings in may?
Time to buy! good entry point
Always buy the dip below $40 imo. Macy's will again raise guidance for the third quarter.
Should go much higher imho. I find that the women who shop at Macy's also like Tjx and Target. perhaps should hire some people from TJX down the road. Another thing I notice is that some stores have a nice Fur department and they will store them in the warm weather months for you at a small fee. Woman I know got a great price on a fur coat. Finally seeing some nice M commercials. The bar seems to be set low and Xmas season is coming so I expect good results from the current pps.
I'm looking forward to my $3200 dividend on 2 January 2020. Shorts will be paying it.
"Good Morning longs! Hang tight for 24 months and you’ll be rewarded 10 fold. The numbers don’t lie. Anyone that follows analysts will never make real money as they are ALWAYS LAGGING the market. TJX has sales of $42b and market cap of $65b. Macy’s has sales of $24b and market cap of $3b. Once they turn around their sales trends, and they will, their market cap will be at least $25b... so price will equate to $75 plus. Analysts are brain dead and are rarely right. Look how wrong they were with NIO, SNAP, TUP and on and on. If you’re waiting to buy based on analysts, you’d be better off in a money market account!!!"
Leveraged buyout rumors. Cowen says real estate is worth 5-8b
Just ordered a Apple Watch from Macys
Just went in on 1000 shares after selling in the high 6’s last week.... let’s see
"Well, here Macy is always empty and there is no stock on the shelf. I just don’t see how they are making money."
"Here are a few reasons why I think Macy's will survive and flourish in the long term (or get bought by a giant e-commerce like Amazon): Macy's serves a market segment that isn't served by any other retailer. Think about all the young folks shopping for prom dresses, suites, makeup, wedding gifts, shoes, brand clothing, etc. that are a few notches higher than Target, but not as expensive some boutique stores. For all the stuff I mentioned above, Macy's is like a natural go-to place. Some other high-end retailers have already gone bankrupt (Neiman Marcus for example). JCP is already a goner. Macys' has far less competition now than it did a year ago. I think there is always need for a retailer like Macy's (not too expensive, and not too ""ordinary"" like Target/Ross/Marshalls/TJmax, etc.) for makeup, brand name clothing, and shoes. To serve this segment, Macy's is already there. Either it survives as a business, or perhaps get bought out by Amazon (or some other giant). The important point is there is demand for the kinds of stuff that Macy's sells, and no other retailer quite fit that bill. BTW, today's drop was on very low volume. Nothing to worry about. I know it seems like the end of the world as if COVID will never disappear, but fear not, things will come back to normal, and soon enough there will be a vaccine. Macy's will go up and people will start shopping. You cannot shut down an entire country for years. Mark this post, Macy's will pull through this."
There is no reason for this good stock to be trading at such a low PE ratio. Macy`s is a great American anchor store with a very good dividend and a great CEO. Very good time to invest in this stock. The sky is not falling
M will continue to sell off until those hedge guys feel there's nobody else to sell then they'll start buying it back. It's just a big game. Until of course M suprises with a beat followed by share buyback announcements. A one two punch to knock those manipulating the stock out.
HOW Low does the stock have to go before Ichan or some other hedge fund buys a significant stake and forces management to take full advantage of owned real estate?too much value to be ignored.
To all the H8ters saying this was a bad buy at $5/share (yes I'm talking to your Trollsky)
"M no reason down after earnings report, because retail sales very bad, but M comparable stores sales have growth, that means people shopping trending going higher, so M sales can keeping growth,"
I really didn't expect this to be my best performing stock when I bought. My airlines and casinos are on a tear but Macy's? Who knew?
Probably some downward pressure from tax loss harvesting
some big buys there at the bell!
$14 opening?? what happened shorts?? kindly explain 
It’s going to be a LOVELY day!!!
4th of July rally coming. Fewer dips.
"Whoa what do I know, my 6 dollar option expire last Friday and now the stock is below 6 dollars. You tell me there is no manipulation at play here"
The lines are back at the checkout counter inside the Bloomingdales where I live in PA. Buy the dipper!
LOL WOW look at M go higher and higher I think I would wait to sell any as the shorts get squeezed into the ex dividend date next week . You might even get $2-3 dollars more for your share just by waiting a few days.
"Macy’s CEO bought 546,757 shares of company"
The DEM wits at Macy's are now wasting the last of the real estate money making ads that don't sell anything to make some DEM witted point . They will blow all the money then have to file bankruptcy Again . Bankruptcy is nothing new Macy's already F over the shareholders once before . Sell Macy and buy 1000's of other stocks that really have a future and not Bankruptcy
Hold tight people!! No need to panic after one has went up this high this fast a little bit of a pull back is normal keep that in mind before you just panic and sell it￼
I opened a small position here
"Both M and DDS are traded near BV even with great earnings, steal prices! But M has much higher dividend rates and revenues. Certainly M is the leader and top pick! Frankly I just buy M as much as I can, sweet!"
HAPPY THANKSGIVING ALL!
macy's post poned earnings until July because their excutives are dumping shares or getting ready to do so also preparing for chapter 11 :-)if m reported earnings share price would nose dive.
macy's gains while the market dips what you need to know. _ all you need to know is Macy's is the winner in it's category and will become huge once JCP Pier1 and Sears are gone
52% loss in less than 12 months. 72% loss in under 2 years. How does Gennette still have a job?
If your short SAY OH NO the float is to small for use all to cover. M going a lot higher
"People are going to mob Macys all year after covid ends. Even now, people are getting used to wearing masks and shopping like normal. Soon people will wear masks like putting on shoes before going out!When this ends and it will soon, because an expert on covid like diseases said it is so contagious with most having no symptoms that likely as much as 50 percent of the population now have immunity so we only need to inoculate another 20 percent of the population to have herd immunity!!That equates to 34 million vaccinations are needed to end this covid nonsense!!That could be done in a month!! Post covid people are going to mob the malls and stores like Macys."
Now that Malls are open for business.. Visited the Macy's in the neighborhood and it was full with customers. Didn't feel like there is on-going pandemic. I would say business is better than normal for this time of the year. Holidays are around the corner and surely the customers want to spend the cash they saved during last 6 months.
LOL LOVE THIS STOCK I AM MAKING A TON IN DIVIDENDS!! its all about the pps that you buy in. 40 no 15 yes.
I think with the results from Amazon we will see M report good numbersM moved into on line and if my memory serves me it was good for them in last reportThink it will be better this timeLooking for 18 soon and a strong move to 20 after earnings ??
"Amazing how the shorts are up in arms now, they can't use their typical line of a dividend cut coming. Wow, a nearly ten percent yield, the stock is going into its strong quarter, everything is pointing to a strong ""Santee Claus"" rally both in the markets and in retail sales. On-line sales dropped for the first time EVER in October, meanwhile we already are seeing very good numbers from retailers and fashion houses. Carters had great numbers last week and they fall right into the demographic that shops in Macy's. Huge short positions as the Gnome mentions they are naked shorts. Nearly a buck thirty off of 52 week low, but over 50% down from 52 week high, so upside potential is much greater than downside. Secured dividend was the move that the board needed to take, now the likes of J are saying they should raise it after saying they would cut it for about six months now. If a trade deal comes down the pipeline, the markets will explode, S and P over 4000 is a distinct possibility and retail and fashion will explode and shorts will go down in flames and they know. That is why they are upping their game now. Guess what, no dividend cut Gnome and J and our new shorts sneaking in under new aliases."
Good Riddance CFO!
Beats from DDS and now JCP. Encouraging for M longs!
Why the drop ? Any news ?
"in 2016-2017 was high ranking retailers baddest time, but it's been over,all high ranking retailers earnings very good in 2018, l think high ranking retailers sales will very good in 2h 2019,because very low unemployment rate and people income strong growth, people go out more and more, so on line sales will slow down and maybe decline,so all high ranking retailers will continue growth in future, M jwn and JCP have huge room to growth,Amazon will down to $900 per share, the sidewalk have a lot of people walking in weekend and good weather."
"Good Morning, Looks like profit taking going on. Still Macy's is doing well up 2.5 to 3.5% on 4 million volume in the first 15 minutes of trading.M should hit and close above $25 this week. 4 weeks of holiday shopping, dividend payout January 2, 2018 ($0.38) as of December 14, 2017 (holders). These are very positive, and shorts should be having margin calls by now. Have a great investing day."
Nomanski hedge fund is smart. They know that there is more money to be made going long M. All about risk reward.

You must a TOTAL DEM wit to think losing $688 million dollars or a loss of $-2.21 per share is a good thing when Q4 is the best Q of the year to make money. The business channels are pulling a CON job on you because for sure they did not report Macy's true earnings for Q4

"I started buying Macys in Nov 2020 and am up 38.88% in that same time period cash in the bank yielded roughly 1%. Now Cramer is pushing the play for Tuesday, you tell me !!!!"
"I wrote a note on things that will be a catalyst for M a few weeks ago. Some of them are M specific and some are market specific, but both types will drive M up. I think it is pretty clear that we are seeing the start of the year end rally as the market is primed to go higher. It will take the retail group up, and M is going with the market, IMO. This time I don't expect resistance at $16 to hold M back. Great value here if M is going to turn things around, and I believe they are going to ring two big bells: 1. Sales growth, and 2. Cost reductions = Nice beat on EPS. Load the boat as shorts will be unwinding their position, IMO."

"With store closures throughout retail and a weakened inventory in the survivors, Macy's is really posed to capture massive market share in retail. They got the liquidity to keep a high quality inventory of merchandise. People need and want clothes and rivals like Amazon simply don't have the brands to compete. Macy's mid $20's by year end is a very likely possibility. The bears in here and other places have done zero research on this stock, all they do is say bankrupt and post memes. While the facts say Macy's was very profitable prior to covid and will be more profitable after covid."
"Someone's shorting the stock, there is no point in pumping this stock up to near $10 a share 2 days ago only to cut the price nearly in half days later."
"my strategy simple i bought at 15, i'll take the 10% dividend yield, if it goes at 13,5 i'll average down. Then in the event of dividend cut i will still have 5 yield, if in the future manage to rebound i will have gains in capital appreciation. Also the stock has a very low p/b ratio compared to it's peers. The businesses is big in America and has a history. Tell me why a value investor wouldnt buy it. It's not like they are many opportunities out there. To be honest i wish the stock to be shorted to buy at even better discount."

"Like most of you, I was worried at the open this morning but held fast to my believe that it would reverse course before the end of the day. Now I am happy a turned away from the screen as it approached $8.00. 40% of the outstanding shares of M are still short but it is shrinking, it went from 6 to 5 days to cover. Which means that over the next 5 trading days I expect the share price to increase. History also confirms a high price 10 - 20 days from now, based on earning surprise. I don't just trade M, I also believe in their get well strategy prior to Covid. https://content-az.equisolve.net/_945010ad0f792d34a09e8033ab1a2e2e/macysinc/db/361/6425/pdf/Macys+Third+Quarter+2020+Earnings+Deck+11.19.20+FINAL.pdf"

I know they had sufficient cash to cover the dividend in the last earnings, but is it very well possible they have to suspend the dividend if the additional tariffs do in fact hurt the bottom line and they no longer have sustainable cash flows?

These additional tariffs have completely ruined my investment thesis on this stock even though I did consider it as a potential risk...but we're getting one step forward ad two steps back."

Watching Macy's languish like it is is testament why most in stocks know nothing about how to invest. Buy this titan of retail with real estate galore paying a rich dividend. 2019 with a FED in retreat is a positive. Quite the opposite of that which we saw in the 4th qtr.

"Oh my, the uber wealthy and their minions, the financial analysts and news media just crack me up. Create a big scare about manufacturing activity dropping, meanwhile failing to mention that the majority of the drop was due to the GM strike and the idling of dozens of plants, both GM and suppliers, let alone the drop in shipping of parts. Well, people made a bunch of money today, wonder what crisis they will create tomorrow to scare the little investors away."
M couldn't have kept the online business going? it's a small fraction of the total but better than nothing.this would have been an opportunity to grow it. Of course it would have taken some thought to protectthe few centralized employees and thought is rare in management.
"I think i have posted here before that I follow @Macy's on twitter. This summer lots of complaints about conditions of stores, late deliveries etc. Now a majority of the tweets are positive, good customer experiences. I believe sentiment is changing due to ramp-up in holiday help and the store upgrades"
"Macys will likely be one of the most profitable Investments of 2020 with it likely tripling this year and a safe 10% dividend too.Soon they wont have any debt at all at the fast rate they are paying it off from the annually strong Free Cash Flows. Not to mention their massive real estate holdings worth enough to retire all their long and short term debt and enough left over to take the company private. All metrics scream that this is a ridiculously cheap stock. PE, PS Book, ROA, ROE, ROIC all at ridiculously cheap values."
Cleaned me out. This is a tough work day.
"Bankrupt jcp has multiple offers in the 1.5 to 1.75B range, Macy's market cap is 1.87B, this a no brainer buy with far more valuable real estate than jcp, what's your counter argument namsky dopey"
$9B in market cap gone in two years. You guys like Gennette and his plans? Market cap currently less than $4B.
What Time do they Report Earnings Tomorrow before or after the bell??
Still holding $20 average 2k shares !!! My kids college funds ..Macy’s to my family is iconic American brand
why is today's volume low? Do you predict the price will go up next week?
Why is the stock down after earnings? I thought the sell off was in Tech.
"There Were `118,000,000 shares SHORT97% Indy ""owned""$8.75--$9.25 near term"
"Macy's CEO expected full year EARNINGS per share $3.59- $3.69,so Macy's reasonable price is $36 per share, it's p/e =10, Macy's high dividend could keeping, don't forget tax cut will add fuels for Macy's, SO Macy's front view are very good, strong buy Macy's, don't sell, you sure be make a lot of money and get high dividend in 2018,"
"Some positive developments, some headwinds: https://finance.yahoo.com/video/why-traditional-retailers-likely-close-172434051.html"
And here come the upgrades -- UBS $21 to $26 which means $30.
Get ready for after hours and tomorrow another way up six flag ride guys. The stock is calming itself down for a takeoff.
Wonder what this board thinks on next ER? 10% dividend and almost all time low.. Macys isnt going anywhere
"Kids graduating need a nice suit , dress and shoes, accessories for job interviews . Timing is good"
Load and hold
"Q1-sales numbers totomorrow Thursday. I say bad, but BETTER than expected. Go Macy‘s go!"
Heading to $13 PLUS
"So my puts that I sold this morning in good shape, I picked up about 5k in premium. Nothing but cash.."
How does everyone forget that there 1.1 million sqft herald square location is worth as much or more than there market cap?
"when Cramer said buy,I sold the s... out of this stock- taking my money to the BANK-maybe go long."
at least Buy some puts to protect yourselves. $8 puts are only a 10 cent premium atm
This is just great! What a feeling!!!!
Retail report out today and said retail sector dropped 1.2% in December. This is bullish for M bc everyone blamed them for weaker performance in December but this proves all along it wasn't a Macy's issue.
Appears from their 10k they own approximately 70 million square feet of space. Let's exclude Herald Square and allocate 1 million sq ft to it and say it's worth 2 billion. That leaves 69 million sq ft of space for which is valued at 3 billion roughly. 5 billion current Enterprise Value less 2 billion for Herald Square. Not sure if this is reasonable but lets assume 100 per sq tt value. That's 7 billion. Not mentioning fact they generate 1.5 billion in cash flow.
"Macy's can easily pop over $35, after the shorts' gets toasted!"
if you believe M will be higher by years end good time imo to add. Volatile stock. Dividend secure and bar set low so I like the current risk reward.
Shopping day everyday at Macy's!
"When Penney and Sears go under, those old lady shoppers will migrate to Macy. They don't know how to find Amazon."
"Macy's 10 largest locations by square feet are:New York, Herald Square, 2,172,000 square feet;Chicago, State Street, 2,048,000 square feet;Downtown Minneapolis, 1,276,000 square feet;Downtown Pittsburgh, 1,158,000 square feet;Brooklyn, 1,012,000 square feet;San Francisco, Union Square, 925,000 square feet;Seattle, 864,000 square feet;Downtown Miami, 485,000 square feet;Paramus, N.Y., 485,000 square feet;Los Angeles, North Hollywood, 475,000 square feet. Of those, Macy's outright owns all but the Miami, Paramus and North Hollywood locations, which are leased. The Union Square location has mixed ownership."

"MACY'S is good. COTY is good, better earnings per share. Citi upgraded to $10"
"In Las Vegas and wanted to check out the Fashion Show Mall this afternoon. Talk about incredible (not only the mall) but the Macy Store inside. Two floors, jam packed full. If they don’t have it, you don’t need it. Fur coats running between 4,000 to 6,000 dollars the few tags I decided to check. As I continued to walk, I noticed on the other side of the mall *another* a just as big Macy Men’s store that was also two floors jammed packed full."
"BOYS...THE PROCEEDS FROM THE DOWNTOWN SEATTLE BUILDING LIKELY TOPS THE TWO BEST YEARS OF PROFITS THAT LOCATION EVER GENERATED. I WILL TAKE THAT, NOT TO MENTION THE REDUCED EXPENSE IT ENTAILED. BOYS.....THIS IS GOOD NEWS, REAL ESTATE IS SKY HIGH NOW, AND I LIKE THE TREND. SELL MORE BUILDINGS AND REDUCE DEBT. ONLINE SALES WILL PICK UP THE SLACK. AVOID HEADLINES AND THINK BOYS....THIS IS ALL A PLUS !!!!"
"This will be over soon. Last year 12/18, there was a big drop.This year 12/2019, interest rates are 100 basis points lower.Might drop another 25 basis points, Santa’s surprise.Plenty of time to shop."
Online sales are up 97%!
"M announcing the div to be reinstated, would definitely make the shorts sweat a bit... :-)"
Retail is back! TGT
Sell off from $41 was a machine meltdown. Jobs and consumer confidence providing M the best back-drop for business likely in its history. Buy.
I visit 30 macys store sale are down people are not buying
Good buying opportunity!!!
I would like to have a rental facility and a rooftop bar above Herald Square.
Thinking on the otherside of $11 are algo buy programs galore.
Next week will be the most wonderful time of the year to invest in Macy’s. The last two quarters resulting in an earnings surprise that will continue into the 4th quarter.
M is about to pop! 30 by the Fall.
"0.6% Less Sales is LESS SALES no matter what was Expected, plus heavy Seasonal Discounting to Cut-Margins, therefore, especially Year-Over-Year Earnings will Lose, lol ."
This is a consistent stock. Regardless of the stock going up or down you can count on Macy's to go down.
"I would love to buy this on this dip but I'm skeptical. 2 Years ago I bought when it was at 20 I believe, I rode it up 10 bucks and dumped it. It was at that time Target and Walmart were also tanking because EveryONE was going to buy on line so the street was saying. There was hope for JCP and others then too. Today, JCP is almost gone, Nordstrom is in bad shape, lots more other retailers in bankruptcy, TARGET and Walmart stocks are hitting new highs. Macys stock is again in the toilet with it's stock price worth about what it's realestate is worth. Seems like a Huge BUY Buy BUY. But did the people who bought Sears Stock when it was worth the realestate make any money? I don't know, I love Macys store and buy a lot of stuff there but it has to Make Money. They probably will end up cutting the dividend soon becasue 10%, come on they need the cash and one way is to chop the div."
"Macy's is the top 10 online shopping site, it is also the only apparel store made to the top ten list. Closing the physical stores should not affect its revenue. All it needs is a good product or two, and it can be done with its size, brand and financial power compared with other apparel stores.https://disfold.com/top-e-commerce-sites-us/"
"Post from 'Robert' earlier today. Guess he deleted it but here it is.""IT WONT GET BACK ABOVE 21 TODAY"" - your words Robert. And it did get back over 21. ""FAILED AT 21"" - your words Robert. Closed at 21.01 You are 100% wrong both counts."
Estimates started trending upward for Macy's.
4.6% dividend tells me it should be priced at 50-55
"comp grown was higher than kohls lol, the stock is cheap... they were conservative to slower the guidance..."
Memo to analysts: please no more upgrades. One more of them and M will go into single digits.
Governor of our state just announced receiving a large shipment of covid vaccine and they are planning to begin giving it to priority people in about a week or right after FDA approval.

"''Retail sales in the US surged 7.5% month-over-month in June of 2020, following an upwardly revised record 18.2% rise in May. Figures beat market forecasts of a 5% gain as more businesses reopened and domestic trade continues to recover from a slump in April due to the coronavirus lockdown. The biggest increases were seen in sales at clothing stores (105.1%); electronics and appliances (37.4%); furniture (32.5%); sporting goods, music and books (26.5%); food services and drinking places (20%); miscellaneous (17.7%); and gasoline stations (15.3%). Sales also increased at motor vehicle dealers (8.2%); health and personal care (3.5%); and general merchandise (2.7%). In contrast, sales fell for nonstore retailers (-2.4%); food and beverages stores (-1.2%); and building material and gardening equipment (-0.3%). Year-on-year, retail sales went up 1.1%.''

I'm rich the dividend has been declared and I'm getting 11% on my money. $4000 on 1 April 2020. Thank You shorts for the cheap shares and paying my dividend! See you at $18 with the short squeeze.
"Why don't we just face the reality here, none of us can guess or even forecast if that is a better term what this stock will do day to day or even month to month right now. The markets are grossly manipulated to create wealth for the uber wealthy and to try and tank the economy to further discredit a President who is under constant attacks from the media, analysts, other politicians, etc.. There is no need to discuss next logical moves for this company or for that matter any company under the auspices of helping share holders or even the overall markets. Everything that is happening in the markets has been scripted but in such a way that there is no linkage or even trends to allow a small investor to make intelligent investing decisions. Case in point, Macy's report crashed the stock for several days, Nordstorm's comes out with a similarly weak and unimpressive report, they dropped a fraction of the fall that Macy's had and it started to recover almost immediately. Yesterday we saw Signet report and the stock losses a quarter of its value and is still weak today, today Tiffany comes out with a similarly weak report and poor guidance and the stock goes up. The same is true throughout retail and for that matter every sector in the market. Bed, Bath and Beyond has a lack luster report, after multiple downward revisions and their stock pops. ANF has a decent report and their stock tanks. So for anyone to tell me that any of this is reasonable, logical or anything other than pure manipulation I would love to hear your thesis."
"Can get to 25 easy, its flirted with 25 a few months ago. Remember it was at $40 in 2018!"
You got to love when analysts make their call right before earnings to try and manipulate the stock. Good one Standpoint
Huge. Buy.
"Macy's planned to downsize before this pandemic. They plan to close 125 of their 775 stores and invest more in Ecommerce websites and aps.Crucially what a lot of people do not know is that Macy's owns a lot of it's retail outlets. They are valued up to $20,000,000,000!!!!!!!!!!!! That is $20BN! Talk about a shareholder safety net. In my opinion anything under $20 a share is a super strong buy."
Too much of a bargain.... AMAZON WILL PULL THE TRIGGER AND BUY!!!!!!Announcement eminent.
Let’s do a quick consensus on where the stock is going from here until its earnings report. Imo it’s
"Markets at nearly all times highs again and Macy's trading at 2 decades low. Should tell you everything you need to know. If it doesn't, how about the $5 loss they'll report this year. Trade it to 10x next years earnings and you have a $4-5 stock. Nothing but lower highs coming."
Kevin from shark tank likes Macy's. but at what price?
Making another run at $21.1
Retail should pick up by May long weekend. Be calm.
It's pretty clear that Macy's is killing it in Retail..that's because they started its turnaround years ago. They invested in digital by hiring Hal Lawton and Jill Ramsey from Ebay and the head of Home Depot digital team. They closed stores that needed closing they own their own real estate and transforming the locations..most Macy's are in A rated malls which have all transformed from malls to destiny locations with food and entertainment. They bought Blue Mercury and expanding and Bloomingdales is the most underrated of Macy's portofolio it is killing Nordstroms and Macy's is killing JC Penny and Dillards...By 2020 Macy's and Kohls will be the last left at the middle end. Macy's credit card business is bigger the JC Penny..Macy's is a gift at these levels
Announcing the closing of its stores and B00m g0es the dynamitewhat choice now but to either buyback or cut dividend or both?
To anyone else that hasn't bought in you know that you only have a small window left to make huge gains in Macy's
So the big money boys have stopped driving the price down as can be seen from the fact that this is the first day in almost two weeks that the volume was actually below or near average daily volume. So that means that they will start to buy into the stock and lay low for awhile during their accumulation phase of the manipulation cycle. Once they have acquired a very large stake they will have their analysts (yes their analysts as they own the brokerages - if not literally at least figuratively) start to bring out upgrades citing improving economic conditions and improving market conditions and then they will drive the price upward to the upper 40s - lower 50s. Then they will start to sell their positions with a cool 100% return.
Looks like $36.00 is holding up very strong as support! Glad I bought at $35.77
Bonds of Macy’s will be eligible for the Fed individual corporate bonds program?https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-09/federal-reserve-s-fallen-angel-bond-buying-won-t-catch-them-all
I see an ascending wedge...and we are at the very tip. This could start a great momentum into earnings. BUY!
Can't fight market sentiment. Under normal market conditions this would be above 15. Great opportunity for huge return to those with patience.
I TOLD THIS BOARD WEEKS AGO TO SHORT BYND IN THE 160 AREA. AMAZING HOW OFTEN THAT I AM RIGHT. YACKTMAN IN BIG AT 18.50 THIS PRICE IS GRAVY IMO.
"Macy’s, strong buy, because of JCP bankruptcy"
"Shorts be afraid, very afraid."
Macy's just hired thousands of employees! That means that something big is coming along with huge gains! Just bought 2000 more.
Back to the 20s faster than you realize! Then 30s! Blink and you miss out!
"This stock has so much upside room, it's unreal. Take a look at 2008 recovery. $5 > $25> $40> $60. All 2 years apart. Current price has already factored in the worst scenario, and then some."
"So is it possible to buy shares of Macy's on December 10 before the ex-dividend on the 12th, then get out on the 14th in order to cash in on their dividend?"
"This will be the first holiday season where Target’s same-day delivery service Shipt is live at all of its 1,500 stores. Whare's dat Macy's catalyst &/or innovation they wuz talkin' 'bout, eh? lol"
"I was almost about to toss this, but if GS says to sell, then maybe I should hold... or buy more."
a sell rating weeks after the guidance cut and right before ex div you say?
"Short Macy's if you say it's dead. People said that about Bestbuy 10 years ago and Bestbuy limited stores increased e-commerce. Macy's has been limiting stores while increasing ecommerce. Clothes,makeup designer wear all good, but Macy's has increased sales in Furniture which has huge margins. Haters can't afford Macy's so they hate on the stock."
"Bought the dip, back to $10 for easy money!"
The trajectory of this stock is downward over past 5 years. I agree there is money to be made short run but to think its going to $20 or $30 when it was slowly declining from $20 pre covid is not likely. There’s a reason all the big box clothing retailers are not making it...
"Yacktman Fund's 3rd-Quarter Portfolio Update,GuruFocus.com•October 15, 2019The Yacktman Fund (Trades, Portfolio) made only one new buy during the third quarter - GrafTech International Ltd. (NYSE:EAF). Its more significant updates include increasing its holding of Macy's Inc. (NYSE:M) and reducing its positions in Procter & Gamble Co."
"ROFL, now it's up. The robots made over 2% in less than 30 mins there, lol."
Anyone hiring? I lost all myMoney snorting Macy’s. Will clean toilets too
"Sold all 1,000 in the premarket. Made money but will lose on the puts. The guidance was weaker than I expected. Inventory glut persists though it's not as bad as it was one quarter ago. If you back out asset sales, implied performance of stores will be in line with expecatations. I saw potential for upside. The yield seekers will prop this up though. I don't see a ton of downside but my hope that it will rip will not come to pass."
"Remember I told the board at $17+ ,eveything above $15 was an easy short and on our way to $10?Keep going M,keep going (down)."
"Strong jobs report this morning with high job creation and very good yoy wage growth. Only about 15% of retail sales is made online, the rest is made at brick and mortar stores. A rising tide of consumer spending lifts all boats. Seen this setup by markets before, retail stocks look red premarket but will finish in the green when investors realize people will continue to spend their incomes. M’s dividend looks even stronger. Sector rotation out of overvalued tech and into stable income stocks will occur in the next few weeks. Seen this before and will see it again. Increased my M holdings to over 12,000 shares by buying on the dip to $21 on Wednesday."
"Today you will see the real value of M when it is not suppressed by Market Makers. High volume makes it hard for them to keep M down. Anytime there is good volume it's usually a good day for M. Best of luck to all longs on Monday!As for you Matthew, I hope M opens at $30 on Monday and your brokerage firm calls you for margin."
"Like I said, pre-market mired in algorithmic trading. Will close in the green imo."
Just THINK.... about Macy's Possibilities!!! They are HUGE!!!!Perhaps they AQUIRE NORSTROM as part of FUTURE AMAZON DEAL!!!!!This is clearly the way AMAZON THINKS.... AMAZON will now have RETAIL along with additional Satelite Warehouses!!! WIN WIN for ALL
where is Harry Krishna ?
"The broad market is getting ready to explode upward for a start of a year end rally. Earnings are looking good, and this wind will fill most all sails. I sure would not want to be short M during a year end rally. The entire retail group is going to move up as consumer discretionary is rotating into favor. Watch the shorts scramble and cover, LOL. IMO, M is perfectly situated now to participate in the market up move. a Brexit solution could be a catalyst this week. The new Macy's look for Mens fashions looks good to me, and I think it will be rolling out to key stores. Please do your own due diligence before you buy."
"M is currently Trading at $1.31 above it's all time low.(Due to the Corona Shut Down) It was at $18.57. So you have to ask yourself, Do short this hoping for $1.31 a Share, or do you go Long hoping for $12.41 a Share. I believe it will go Up. Bankruptcy is off the Table, and will Not Happen !!"
"Corey, ten percent tariffs will be split with their Chinese manufacturing partners at a 50/50 split that has been true with all of the other sectors which have been dealing with tariffs now for months. The remaining 5% will probably be split between the company absorbing 2 to 3% and passing 2 to 3% on to the consumer. Do they risk losing some revenues, sure, but with the current increase in payrolls running at a 3.1% rise this past report, the consumer should be able to afford the rise in prices. The consumer stocks such as Clorox, Proctor and Gamble, Unilever have raised prices anywhere from 2 to 5% on most products and their earnings this quarter have been very good implying that consumers have not switch away from their products or stopped buying their product."
I am looking forward to Macys earnings report in two days.Exciting moves up!
great numbers. bunckropcy??? :) forget it. they will increase dividends
"I bought KM in 2001 when it was going bankrupt. Bradlees before that and each day was a 20-30% gain/loss. There is just too much retail in America. EBITDA can be manipulated so companies appear to look better, then they actually are. Now that K Mart, Sears, et cetera are gone and Belks, JC Penney are bankrupt and a shadow of there former self maybe M will rise from the ashes. There is a lot less competition around. The common ground of all the failing retailers I mentioned is: they all said e-commerce was going to save them."
"A caravan South of the border has 4300 migrants ready to cash their stimulus checks at Macys. You can't make this up, although I just did. The stimulus checks and saving money by closing 30 stores in 2021, $500,000,000 bond sale is already baked into this stock. Digital and e-commerce will save M from bankruptcy like it did SHLD, JCP and Montgomery Ward. Maybe M should sell life insurance?"
Online sales expected to increase 14.1 percent this year. 143.7 billion.
AMAZON ON THE HUNT ! Great recent earnings.... GREAT TIME TO ANNOUNCE AQUISITION!!!! https://www.dallasnews.com/business/retail/2021/04/05/amazon-is-considering-home-goods-and-electronics-discount-stores/
In 2020 Macy's got $4.5 billion in financing ($3.15 billion pledged against it's real estate) to avoid bankruptcy. Does that sound like a growing retailer who deserves a forward earnings multiple of 20+?
$14.20 Will be the Low for the next 5 years
"Macys looks undervalued compared to Gap, Kohl's and Nordstrom. Macys Enterprise Value/Revenue = 0.53 Gap=0.93 ,Nordstrom= 0.78 Kohl's= 0.56 average: 0.7 Macys at average: 21.42Average Market cap 5,536 that would give price for Macys 17,84"
"The thing about borrowing on margin is that you only need to borrow 50% of the amount of your money to lose 100% of your money, when the value of the asset you are invested in falls 66% in value. To clarify, I have $100 and borrow $50, and buy $150 worth of stock A. If stock A then goes down 66%, a common occurrence in the stock market, I lose all my money, and the brokers and market makers will be happy."
"LOL,LOL,LOL Max, Eric, Mathew, Robert , DonDraper, Ed have been pumping this Bankrupt company and now are going to lose all their money LOL,LOL NEVER EVER invest in DEM wit screw ups like the ones that run Macy's because all they know how to do is waste money and never learned how to make money"
Macy's due to GME is lining up for it's own run at a short squeeze. M has been unfairly criticized by the market and the media and failure to recognize there strong online sales and shift to off mall will cause a massive increase in price once this change is recognized.
“We experienced another quarter of double digit growth in digital “. Bullish bullish
No it doesn't took less then 2 weeks to ship the Furniture. I want to know where else I can buy Furniture that is as good of quality as Macy's? All the Furniture stores by me are out of business now and I dont rent or put things on credit card.
M price target $23 for now .. will adjust up soon ..
At some point the market has broaden beyond FANG to sweep up stocks like M. Too cheap to be ignored much longer.
KSS trade in unison nearly always.KSS up after earnings up surprise and dividend news.Macys is going to have great news tooMacys is going to turn in a growth stock with all the competition gone.
"It can't tell by visiting one mall but Macy was the most crowed department store in my neighbor (Live near Cerritos Mall in CA) . JWN was not that busy. BTW, I don't own any M or JWN but it looks very cheap to me and I heard the news about massive amount of put (shorts) options traded before the earning. I hope they are wrong."
"M, GME, AMC..Operation Save The Malls"
Where can you find a company that paid 5.02% dividend with P/E of 6.14? M pricing will be 40 by year end.
Who sold under $16?
MORE GREAT NEWShttps://libn.com/2019/05/28/major-mixed-use-makeover-planned-for-macys-site/
We should be hitting the 20 range again to retest that zone. The volume and popularity is picking up for this stock ! Get in at 15$ for a buy done. Not financial advice
above average volume at the time when the market volume has been dead....people want that 10 percent dividend
VACCINE RECALL! No one will be shopping Macy's now. Good luck to any longs holding today...Game Over!
LB is already recovering to $40M will be 40 next year..Have a happy thanksgiving..
Boy did I pound on the table hard at IEP for Macy's stock! Mr Icahn is a great value investor and I am confident that he will see the current value in M stock. if he takes a stake imho the stock doubles fast.
Eric what are you saying there is accounting fraud going on at Macy's now ? Why would they report a loss of 688 million to the SEC if it was not true.
I want sell my shares at 20.50 again. :D
Macys is going to more than double from today's closing price!!! Sure beats a cd rate!
"When JCP and Sears file Bankruptcy , Macy’s will be back to $80, like I predicted back at $20"
Macy's is the best store to buy good quality clothes for the whole family plus great home goods. Don't have lots of money but buying 100 shares at a time on drops.
Macy’s P/E is lower than its yearly earnings... has that ever happened before?
"Oh look, #2 on the list!!!https://www.cheatsheet.com/money-career/15-big-box-stores-will-probably-disappear-soon.html/2/"
"$20 around the corner, and more"
M a buy with price target $27 by year end.
"Pre-market is $5,60 (+7,49%). I smell big news about financing backed with real estate. Short-squeeze will propel this through the roof with every third share sold short:-) Reopenings are picking up nationwide. Go Macy‘s go!!!"
100$ stock
"Sourcing Journal reported that retailers are already planning 1,800 store closures in 2019 in the apparel sector alone."
"Everything will rebound today while Macy's closes at new lows. If they hint towards flat to slightly higher full year numbers, this should be pretty good buy after earnings reaction. Should form a technical bounce at $19ish. Buyer at $19 and $18. Seller if it goes to $17."
Time to buy??
$14-$16 is the range for this stock once stores are all open.
I worked for Macy's Technology center in Atlanta Georgia USA in 2015 and then again 2020. The tech project always went through hiccups managed by people who lacked vision and few women who looked like zero talent in business mind rather looked like going to a nail spa to groom themselves. I saw bright talented technology experts getting fired left and right and they failed to retain best talent. Their SFO technology office was shut down and also Atlanta office went through flip-flop start-shut plans. I love Macys in general as it is a classic company with nostalgic and festival feeling. Just they are lacking good management at some level that I am not sure what it is.
If it's true that M's real estate is worth $16 billion then the stock trades at roughly half of breakup value. Add the 7% dividend and it's easy to understand why financial talking heads said it was a screaming buy back at 25 and now its 21.64!!
"BlackRock Inc. disclosed the acquisition of more than 10 million shares of Macy's ! Thus, the hedge Fund owns on may 8: 38,951,151 shares of Macy's, Inc. (NYSE: M),which is 12.6 percent of the company's ownership. In its previous registration dated February 5, 2020, BlackRock Inc. reported that it owns 28,870,763 shares, indicating an increase of 34.92 percent."
No reason for kohls trading at 9 + billions and Macys at 5 billions. Going to 30's
"Macy given its Partnership with Brookfield asset management which will create revenue from M’s lucrative properties, innovation with its Colors program designed to lure Customers to its stores and ongoing profitability will draw an Analyst upgrade soon. IMO."
"Fact is Macy's was busier than it has been in a long time. I would wait to sell any shares , because I think M will be going higher, Ex dividend is on Dec 12 2019 and I think you can get more for your shares just by waiting to sell them, But if you need to at least sell them with call option so you get more for your stock. As low a M is now trading I would be buying and not selling. Trading way under value and has big upside. M has great cash flow and can keep paying the dividend. I would for M to be over $20 again soon."
"At the end of 2015, Macy's stock was at ~35. They reported a drop of 4.7% in Holiday sales in January 2016 and a drop of 2.1% in Holiday sales in January 2017. This year they reported a gain of 1% but they are still far behind overall (-4.7% - 2.1% + 1%). Now - *if* Macy's was doing something dramatically different... I can understand that shareholders expect Macy's to keep improving but that's just not the case."
Good day to add or get in before the Atlanta rally. Fundamentals are great and 4.5% dividend. Moving up into the end of the year.
"What happened to the ""Macy's BK' ? Macy's should take market share from other retail failures look beyond 2020 this is a long term play. Covid19 declining dramatically in NY etc. possibly a vaccine new 5min testing kits. Bashers hurry up i need cheap shares !!!! Yes shorts or put option callers say its going $3."
Macy's emerging as the best of breed in department stores. Buy.

There’s plenty of value here! That’s for sure!
Now the positive earnings are released. So much potential on this gem moving forward...
Huge volume looks like we could have a strong close setting up tomorrow for another big up day. Let’s go!
i'm long but only today amzn market cap went up 10 times the entire market cap of macys. so congratulations to the management for bringing us to this 
"Macy's should report earnings on November 13th. Estimates are for 0.04 cents, which is ridiculous in my opinion. It should be more like 0.28 cents, which is a twenty four cent beat, and that should start the rally in the share price. With retail stocks, all the money is made in the fourth quarter. In normal times a retailer like Macy's should be 59.50 a share based on a P/E of 16 which is realistic."
Shocked the street has kept us so contained. Macy's emerges out of covid with a much brighter future aka online and reduced mall competition. Buy any dips if we get them below $15.
"Bought this a year ago at $20, rode it to $42, now back at $23. Huge value here. Just not sure if I want to buy more if it gets back down to $20. Same company it was at $42. Gotta love Wall Street."
I commented last night that I bought 300 shares.. wow that was a good decision ! 
"Buy buy bUY. Macy's is going to the moon! Great time to buy. Buy before it reaches $15.76 per share. You'll have a great tax deduction for your winners. Reddit brought this over $14. Shorts know the financials. Get out before M is $9 per share. Digital and e-commerce was JCP, SHLD, Bradlees and Montgomery Wards answer and they're all bankrupt."
"Remember what i told you last week?I said sell it today or tomorrow, and buy back when it's $17-18.I hope you did listen to me. ;)"
"From CNBC article: ""Shechtman said Story has gathered ""tens and tens of thousands"" of email addresses since the nationwide rollout. And 80% of those people are new to Macy's, according to Shechtman. ""Now think about how qualified they are,"" to go on and buy something from Macy's, she said."" They are sending out very effective e-mail blasts, lowering advertising costs, and pulling in new customers. This may be one of their best ways to gain new e-commerce customers, plus new traffic to stores from top prospects."
I took profit on a few positions Got my capital ready Fully committed to the pump tomorrow and this week as much as I can LETS DO IT GUYS
Wassup utube!
Heavy losses for shorts! Bad time to short retailers.
"Macy’s haven’t announced the next dividend; until they do, I wouldn’t count on it. Cutting the dividend could bump up the price or stabilize it. If price continues its downward momentum which is very powerful according to chart indicators then any buyout would bump the stock. As they say, nowhere to go but up or zero. In any case, the dividend won’t make the risk of M worthwhile until the price churns a bit longer."
Every time I tried to buy something at Macy’s I have to look and chase down the cashier to pay. 
"I'm confused, how do you own over 100 stocks but can only afford to pick one out of two? Something don't add up here bro...lol"
"""Retail sales in August were stronger than expected, consumer sentiment also came in solid."" (Quote From Barrons) IMO, This climate is just right for Macy's new initiatives to work to improve traffic for the holiday season. With the widely observed trend towards lower priced value stocks away from the higher priced growth stocks, it is harder to find one more fitting than M with a solid $25 B in sales year after year, a high sustainable dividend well over 8% (at the current price, but that won't last long if the PPS keeps rising), consistently large earnings per share between $3 and $4, and possibly higher if their current plans work, and good free cash flow to reduce debt, which cuts cost substantially and enables higher profits (something they have been doing every year lately), and with over 40 quarters of improvement in their internet parts of the sales platform which is a key metric for this Amazon age (plus they have started an Amazon type initiative to get high margin third party vendors added to their internet offerings for more diverse products and addition internet income). They also are working on more ways to reach out to their communities and bring more customers into the stores by a major, now compete program to upgrade the key stores that account for 50% of their total sales (which they already know is working to improve comparative store sales), and they a opening more Backstage sections which brings in other bargain offers, plus now they are experimenting with a new trend towards offering pre worn close at a large discount for those that want a deal a well known brands. So much going on, and they still plan to buy back stock to further reduce the cost of dividends and keep them as an important part of shareholder appeal (and M has already become a steady dividend payer that has not missed a dividend since 2002 so we can expect this will continue unabated). For a stock that fell from last years $40 PPs on on a bad quarter, this is now a ""value stock"" with a good risk reward ratio and in step with the current market rotation. Please do your own reviews and due diligence, but IMO it is a strong buy."
Indexes turning green....... Macy‘s to follow with determination! Annual Shareholders Meeting tomorrow with BIG news......... preparations are done and PR is written in this very moment......... be on board when the rocket lifts-off............
Giddy-up giddy-up.... in a few months and years you‘ll be smiling at todays entry-price.... stockprice will soon return to normal... Macy‘s is reopening next monday.... go M go!
Enjoying watching the volume sells....they will not bring Macy's down...
Let’s get our money back. Hold strong peeps
Figures i buy puts this morning then starts going up. Oh well just a hedge have not sold any shares still going up.
Going to open $17.50 Plus on MONDAY!!!!Today was Options Expiration
Y’all watch for nomansky he’s probably on suicide watch rn lol M is UP UP & AWAYYYYYYYYY double digits soon
HOLD and GO LONG.... LOAD THE TRUCK!!!!! Either way Macy's will be to $10 plus soon...1) Possible buy out target2) Real Estate Holding Company... probably worth min. of $12 with current real estate market values3) Macy's sales are shifting to online.... lean and mean for higher profits..... smaller players dropping out will naturally add to their future success!!!!
"Are you realising that 95% of the population is under lockdown,People are fantasising of going shopping in malls and department stores.Online shopping will be devastated after opening, There is a limit to this viral solitary confinement,Macy’s will be one of the few survivors and the leader in this industry"
"I can agree to a certain point that Gennette has not made a great impression, two and three quarters ago when he came out with the same excuses that annoyed me, now though with a very good report and finally a definitive plan in place, I think he is doing a very good job. How the markets react with all of the stupidity that is associated with Corona virus are irrelevant. When the uber wealthy want to tank the markets, they will succeed, they own 80% of the world's wealth. If you want to see an activist investor, great, what are they going to do? Demand the company be put up for sale, okay, assume best case, fifty percent premium, that puts the acquisition price at 17, do you really believe that is a fair valuation for the company? Also, the company does seem to be making moves, even the announcement of the new line up from Bernstein, they are looking at and introducing omni channel marketing/sales, she is a very big Insta-gram influencer, that is the wave of the future for retailers. So overall, a very good move, probably need to bring on about seven or eight others, pick the top three or four after a one or two year period and dump the rest. May even need to cycle through different influencers. I don't think it would be prudent to invest the huge sums of money that Coty did to acquire a controlling position in Kylie Jenner's cosmetics company. I saw that move as a fourth and goal from the twenty yard line with ten seconds left in the game by Coty. I see our position as more like third and ten on the 30 with two minutes to go, need to expand their social media face, but do so with a eye to the future not out of desparation. I think Coty overpaid by at least fifty percent, though who knows, maybe it pays off, but usually the pioneers die. At the end of the day, Gennette is doing what he needs to right now, the markets will do what the markets do, just keep buying and reducing your cost average, that way if private equity does make a move at a less than stellar premium your covered."
I felt sorry to whoever sold M too early today!
"Hehe,told you if Cramer said don't buy - you buy with both hands!He will recommend once this hit $50"
"Go try and buy a piece of furniture and see why it takes so long for delivery, then decide if you want to invest your $ . Have vendors decided to no longer extend payment term because of fears of bankruptcy ?Sometimes getting back to basics is better than all the smoke and mirrors"
Finally some respect for the cheapest stock in the sector
Macy's is a GREAT company and I love the products that they sell. Top of the line.
"My feeling is that this stock wants to go up and will continue, probably through the end of the year. I'd cover your short position on any small dips because right now almost all retail is heading higher including still undervalued Macy's! Probably hits 15 by the end of December and will beat estimates again this quarter with a larger than expected profit. I wouldn't be surprised if they reinstate their dividend with an announcement at the end of this quarter, dividend beginning in the second half of 2021. Macy's online sales will continue to grow, and this is what Wallstreet is looking for."
Macy’s has an awesome app!! Could take on amzn!!
This is not for the faintest heart. Huge swings throughout the day is the new norm. Too much manipulation is being made by big boys. SEC is sitting there and watching all of this. Absolutaley no good reason for the stock price to take dip today. Patience will be rewarded.
"M no longer have a debt issue in my opinion, having paid down 2.5B in the past 2 years. It now has 4.75B in debt and 1.2B in cash which they choose to use to renovate stores and open more Backstages. They could have chosen to eliminate even more debt or use it to buyback stocks. The debt is low enough that anyone can reasonably see that even if M stagnants or even continues to slows a bit the debt will continue to get lower. M can also as a last result choose to eliminate dividends (ignoring stock prices) and pay off that debt even quicker or accelerate asset sales again. That won't happen bc M's debt is now reasonably low enough and M is still making twice the amount it pays out in dividends. That being said M should be at the very least be a $30 stock and still paying over 5% dividend. It makes no sense for M to be trading at $24 priced as if it's going out of business within the next few years. That's just not the case. M real estate far exceeds it's enterprise value at these levels. With just 4.75B in debt and 1.2B in cash and making $3 a share a year and paying $1.51 a share in dividends plus some prized real estate assets i don't reasonably see how M can even go backrupt. M could decide to use 1.2B in cash now to pay down another 1B in debt and also eliminating dividends and using all profits to pay debt could make M debt free in about 3 years. I just don't see M deteriorating that quickly, as a matter of fact they look like stabilizing if anything. Then when debt is paid off you are left w a profitable company that has 0 debt and 15B+ in real estate value. AT 15B marketcap and 0 debt M is abiut a $50 stock folks. But what if it's assets are wirth 20B? However which way you reasonably see it M is too cheap it's not as if their debt is 8B and M is losing money!"
Is Macy's a potential acquisition target? Thoughts?
"I guess M CEO does not believe in the Christmas Bounce since he sold 1/3 of his shares back in September. If he was expecting a ""bounce"" he would have purchased ""a boat load"" at this level but he is ""unloading his boat"" instead."
"PE ratios in retail are at historic highs in the mid teens. If you think Macys will come at 4.2 EPS, and take a PE of 12, the stock should be about mid 40s."
Just booked a beautiful cruise paid for by my $4500 dividend that will be paid shortly. Thank you Macy’s.
Going to green soon
Wiring money to my trading account to buy more. This is insane. Thanks for the gift here. It may go down a little more but I guarantee I’m going to win over the next few months.
"Oh so sorry I didn't get out on the last surge, but not sorry Im still holding from $5. If you leave your house and go shopping you will see that shopping is very much back to normal. People are getting comfortable with the new norm and living life. I see no reason this won't be back to $10 with good sales reports. Cant wait to see those, I know they are coming."
I NOTICE HOW 15 HOLDS UP VERY WELL!!!!! AND ME THE RICH GETR RICHER!! I BUY ON FEAR LIKE MY MENTOR WAREEN BUFFETT!!

"Easy Robert NO ONE is going to go to Macy's that is the last place on earth they will go after being locked up for a year. They will just keep buying online and go to the beach or to dine out , but they will not be going to Macy's"

"And I remind you the risk that shorts are taking during these manipulated times in the markets, mainly in regards to retail sector. Michael's traded down to 4.96 on August 27th, within fourteen calendar days the price had spiked to 10.07 intra-day. A gain of 104%, again in 14 days."

"Volume, wow...lots of trading"
It's impossible to justify a $1.6B market cap for a company that makes over $2B in revenues per month. With this much market share and real estate holdings.
Anybody really think that closing 125 stores and taking a charge of $300-$400 million won't affect the 2019 results???? What's going to happen to the 9% dividend that some of us bought this for??? Obviously there is no real spectacular new magic in the pipeline like maybe with a pharmaceutical company or something in computer tech. Let's see what if anything the 2/25 dividend result will be.
"Through my brokerage account, I can see the Short interest continue to decrease with now 4.7 days to cover vs 6 days before M beat expected earnings fundamentals. I expect M to have another positive day today, per the technicals. With expectations low and online growth demonstrated I expect Macy's stock to recover to the Feb'20 price by the end of the year, even if the S&P trades even or slightly down."
"Employment numbers showed solid for workers and no signs of recession, but durable goods orders showed continued weakening in manufacturing. Market still worried, and definitely could use some help. The earnings reports this morning were mostly weak with a few bright spots. Market still very nervous and taking some stocks to the woodshed. Waiting for AMZN to report. Retail getting clocked again this morning as all broad averages are moving down so far. M is one of the weaker players as it is dragged down with the other retailers, despite some fairly good news overnight from PUMA indicating sales are doing well. October, a volatile month, so this is par for the course. Expect more volatility as the market needs a catalyst to move up."
Picked up 500 shares at 15 will dump it the day after it goes ex-divi - hopefully pick up a point and the divi.
what will happen after ex div ?
This is a strong long term hold. Great management especially with regard to their focus on increasing online sales. That coupled with stores returning to normal soon (due to vaccine) this will go way up in the next year.
Differnce between M and GME is that macys longs are going to hold it ling term as its a g9od company with huge revenue and will emerge stronger.So guess GME squeeze is just a trailer.With Macys it will be leap folds
Macy’s Beats Holiday Sales Expectations in a Miracle on 34th Street: https://www.barrons.com/articles/macys-stock-holiday-sales-51578496005
Each time we reach $16 the shorts come en masse in the arena. Until they're squeezed
Volume much lower at this point than it was the last 2 days.
"OK. I run the numbers. TTM EPS are minus $11.82. FTM EPS are minus $0.95. Share price is $6.99. That means PE ranges from minus $0.59 to minus $7.35 over next 12 months. Reward? Don't see it. Risk? I see dead money, except for day trade timing reward. I'm thinking short sellers are covering so they can short again, cover again, short again, cover again..."
"Hear that Macy's? That is the sound of really bad Holiday sales metrics, it is the sound of your inevitability. Maybe you can get the Santa's back in your stores in time to help save December. Don't drink the covid kool-aid like everyone else......"
AMC is worried that it's going to go bankrupt. Hmmm....
"mike, for someone who realizes that 80% of the S&P are at 52 week lows or nearly so, you seem to be obtuse to the fact that the situation is a positive for markets, not a negative as you want to imply. Yes, we have a technology sector to include the FANGs at ridiculously high levels, some having P/Es above 100, such as AMD, which makes less than a quarter a share a year, Macy's makes that every three weeks. So while we will have a reckoning within the current leadership of technology, we will also experience a sector swap into those badly beaten up areas. So while it is now apparent, the Democrats have come to the blaring conclusion that they only have one way of defeating Trump in 2020, a major recession. So the liberal Wall Street boys (who give 3 dollars to liberal candidates for every one dollar to a conservative), the uber wealthy (look at Forbes list of top 50 billionaires, other than the Koch brothers who hate Trump, all are liberal), the news media (do I really need to explain that one), and the financial banks (mostly run by liberals) analysts will do whatever necessary to make that a reality. So we need to be prepared for every story, whether factual or not to be blown out of proportion, just as the PMI reading was yesterday. Other than Cramer, no one mentioned GM and Boeing issues."
Retail is strong today but M is still in the dog house
Is it just me that thinks this is under valued? Now Wall Street bashes M for poor in store offering (true) When will they spin how M has ramped up and improved online sales infrastructure (also true)This is when I want to get in on M.
"Macys like BBBY has been left for dead. I remember a few months ago articles stating BBBY is running out of time and soon will declare bankruptcy - that was Dec 2019.The stock was left for dead and went to low single digits.Then covid hit and it was left for dead.Now, it is up and going higher - about $12 now. What happened to all those rumors of bankruptcy?Same for the Gap, it went to low single digits and now is at about $25 from $3 a few months ago.Same for JWN and so on. Look at KSS was at $10 and now is $21 and will soon be $30.The retail sector has been unfairly hit by this covid nonsense and will completely recoverMacys if it weren't for covid would now be in the $30s/share. IT will be too again very soon.People, their store were closed for about 3 months - of course that affected the 1st and second quarter sales and earnings as it did every other retailer that had to close forcibly by the government.KSS and Macys and JWN and all of them are seeing sales resume at last year levels upon opening.We are now in the 3rd quarter and all of Macys stores are open and will be for this whole quarter so expect normal sales results equivalent to 2019 and same for 4th quarter 2020.Macys is going to post excellent sales and profits this 4th quarter similar to last two years.Wow! is the pessimism way overdone with regard to Macys."

Macys stock appreciation today beating out the NASDAQ index.
Macy's earnings is Thursday before market opens..........Christmas is next month......Covid-19 kept everyone at home........savings money.........every household will go BIG on Christmas presents and shop till they drop.....online and instore..........so MACY'S will be $$$UP UP$$$
"I wouldn’t be surprised if someone was looking to buy out Macy’s. Very valuable brand, excellent cash flow, leader in their space, room to add more debt to juice returns. Maybe Amazon, as Robert keeps saying, or maybe private equity, as all of those facts fit their typical playbook. Lots of money on the sidelines in private equity right now that needs to be invested."
I was in Macy’s Yesterday bought comforter sheets etc store was packed with stock and most importantly shoppers place was packed had a lot of Christmas trees decorations well stocked face book now in Macy’s time to buy more plus this stock pays a good dividend
"Possibly another trap. Downgrade, trick people into believing it has no effect and then they pull out the rug. We will see come tomorrow and the rest of the week."
"Debt to equity ratio comparisonNordstrom 2.3JCP guess it's over 7 nowMacys less than 1 (.95). ..which is very healthy..with more store closings and savings..they will be able to buyback more debt..although I don't see why they even need to reduce debt, ..question of selling assets should not even arise, the stock is a crazy value, selling at 4.5pe and div if 6%, seriously..should be 35 easy."
"Sure is a lot of sorry losing shorts on this board, cover and stop the pain."
"So interesting to see people from AMC and GME boards talking about how to make short squeeze to the roof by spreading around the world about SHORT SQUEEZE of stocks with high % short, such as AMC, GME in FB, Youtube, Tweeter, Instagram, social medias. Only buy some and do not sell for 3 days then short will start to cover. Also for option at the expiration they do not have shares to assign for CALLs because no shares to buy. It seems like they know how to break the hedge funds/institutionals 's software :)"
Both JCP and M are both down 7%. Looks like today was orchestrated to be a down day regardless of results.
"When UBS says sell, I say buy! When UBS says sell, I say buy! When UBS says sell, I say buy!"
Silence. Nobody knows what to do. Too afraid to buy and too afraid to short.
"Vaccine will receive Sept to October approval by FDA and will be given to millions of Americans ending this covid nonsense soon.Macys will have a great holiday sales season this year even better than last year.A surprise earnings and sales combined with ending of this covid nonsense will send this stock upfor a massive 200 percent gain or more.Remember they put a sell rating on RAD with a $1 price target days before it shot up from $5 to $11 and ultimately hit $24 in a few days after earnings Dec 2019.Wow were they wrong!Sell ratings often mean the stock is at the lowest price and thus the best time to buy.Covid is nothing. If Jack Nickolaus and his wife being in their 80s who just had it said his wife had no symptoms at all and he only had a mild cold, sore throat for a few days before totally recovering with no medical assistance needed, then how much of a threat is it to healthy Americans who are much younger?The answer is Covid on threat to most Americans, only the weakest and oldest like those in assisted living facilities. When NY had its highest deaths most or 60% came from assisted living facilities.They would have died from one thing or another anyways.My family and I wont be taking the new Covid vaccine when it comes out as we are healthy and covid is no threat to our health at all.This covid scare nonsense will all be over soon. So will the advantage shorts have now."

I was in Macy’s on Thanksgiving day and the place was mobbed!!!￼
Do I get dividend if purchase shares today?
When they sleep we eat.
lets the squeeze begin
"Macys stock is an incredible opportunity. Most certainly Macys management will achieve a return to profitability by 3rd and 4th quarters this year and implement growth strategies that \will expand its business, pay off all debt and restore dividends in just a few years.I see Macys stock rising to $100/share in the 2-5 year holding period.This means $70,000 invested today would become a cool million dollars in less than 5 years!Now thats an impressive return! Try getting that return anywhere else!"
"Macy’s said Monday it has raised roughly $4.5 billion in new financing to help it weather the coronavirus pandemic. The stock, which is valued at $3 billion, is down about 44% this year. LOL , Borrowed more than they are worth!"
Keep loading M !!!
"I noticed that Macy's regularly reports a gain on sale of property. The gain is added to the quarterly income.Perhaps Macy's should consider an IPO of ""Macy's Real Estate Investment Trust"" which would take ownership of most, or all, of Macy's real estate and then lease the properties back to the parent company. Doing so would take a lot of fixed capital assets off Macy's books. Arguably, that can be a good thing.The dividend would likely be paid by Macy's REIT.Proceeds of an IPO could be used for working capital (short term cash assets) and to pay down debt."
Good news for M.https://finance.yahoo.com/m/ba45cc09-1c6b-3802-b421-acf2d530d83d/foreign-investors-hunt-for.html

UP is Macy's new direction.(I think it could reach a new all time high in less than 2 years)
Macy's is getting lose we shall see $18.5 eod and $20+ by Thursday
"If you buy it today but later sell it tomorrow, do you still get the dividend payout on Jan 2. 2020?"
Downgrade at CFRA to $22 from $28.
"Well, if these States would of done what NY is doing the Corona Cases wouldn't of been so high"
"Soon the virus will be gone as well as Macy's mall competitors. Add in a fierce fighting machine online, and bam. Back up to $30."
June retail numbers will be massive M will share in a bump.
"I believe short, long, and neutral watchers can be united. We can all agree that earnings will not be as good as last year but won’t be as bad as bankruptcy YET."
"Macy's should return to it's reasonable price $36 per share , because American economic can keeping continues growth, so Macy's sales sure be very strong in this year,so Macy's future very bright."
For a second there I thought we were going to be part of that AMC & Gamestop runup 
When I bought M before earnings I was hoping it would act the way Nordstrom is acting right now
wayyyyy better than expected!!
At this point the only thing that can help increase sales are topless sales associates.
"Shorts are covering because earnings next week will be better then expected, this company is going to be back to 10-12 a share within a year. Company doesn't have to worry about raising much money..."
"very undervalued, went to macy's on saturday took me an hour just to find parking."
"I just bought 1,000 shares of this goldmine! Wish me luck."
"Relax. Stock is going higher. Macy's is remaking the department store before our eyes, and we'll all be better off for it. Buy."
A steady ascent ahead. The trend is certainly upward! Ask yourself are things getting better or worse? Better by a wide margin!!
CEO for M is making some tough decisions. It is a good sign. He is willing to do what it takes to right the ship. The posit results will begin to show up in the numbers.
Still can‘t believe Macy‘s is trading only at 4% of yearly revenue and 1 times yearly profit. This will change at our earliest convenience. Epic short-squeeze coming..........
"BOYS....MARIA IS A WISE INVESTOR AND CLEARLY AGREES WITH THE ""GREAT ONE"" !!!! 17S BY THANKSGIVING....19S BY FEBRUARY....BANK IT!!!!"
The stock market used to have volatility defined as up and down movement. Value buying used to get rewarded. Ie providing liquidity and benefiting from that. Now it’s all one way flow. All momentum. Not a traders market. This down 20 percent and analysts cutting price targets by 50 percent on earnings down to 4 from 4.15. I’m sorry that’s absolutely ridiculous.
"Pop, pop, pop! July 4th Fireworks to celebrate Macy's reopening and profits!"
"If you haven't figured it out yet, low volume on any popular stock means MM's will crush options and inflict max pain. As usual they will be making a ton on worthless options for Macy's. If you want to be involved with this stock don't by options the stock price is too inexpensive! Monday we start over again. Volume dictates where this stock goes."
"By Friday Nasdaq will be 11,200. M will be $13. It was nice volatility last couple of weeks. It will end soon."
News report says that owned same store sales down .6 % quelling fears of a more dramatic fall for the crucial shopping season.
dividend declared or not ?
Earning going to be inline with 2010-2011 earnings. This is a buy at $16 and sell at $24.
beat Sp 600% stock still playing under $20... makes no sense
"Fair is fair. While I am never short going into earnings, I will gladly admit that I was wrong about Macy's quarter. SS sales 1.3% increase is pretty good and nothing I expected to be honest."
"Shorts are a stubborn gloomy group of people not easily moved to close their positions. Eventually they will panic and capitulate! Not yesterday or today! From the moves yesterday and today it is clear they added to their positions and the smaller private investors closed out their short positions.Most of these institutional short positions will hold as the stock rises into the 20s and only then will they start to capitulate! After all, its not their money they are losing!When the real capitulation occurs this stock will move fast from the 20s to 30s!!YOU want to be long Macys when that happens!!"

"Time to buy, all those naysayers will regret not getting it cheap."
The Motley Fool article entitled 1 Retail Stock to Avoid No Matter What is seven articles back on M' yahoo summary page. This explains the pain Macys is in to reinvent themselves. When M misses they tend to go down 30% to 50% that day. The Herald square neighborhood $235 million dollar proposal is building infrastructure around their flagship store because NYC is failing. You don't hear about Macys faults until earnings and you have to look for them. Gennette isn't going to be negative or he'll lose his $10 to $12 million a year salary and stock options of which he dumps onto the market. Wake up people!

"I went to a Macy’s in Bellevue Washington yesterday afternoon to see for myself after watching a yahoo finance guy tear Macy’s apart. He accused them of understaffing the jewelry counter and his dislike for the new floor layout. He said that he saw one clerk covering 7 registers at their jewelry counters. He stated that Macy’s is understaffing stores and losing sales. I saw 7 behind the counters, a couple might have been managers. And I liked their new layout over the past. While looking at kitchen merchandise, a clerk even asked me if I needed help. There was plenty of staff everywhere. The only thing that I noticed that was disappointing was the absence of colorful art glass. I really like art glass and I always looked at it there. But it probably wasn’t a big seller. That’s my view of Macy’s in a less busy Monday afternoon."
"KHC, MO and bank stocks. Thats all I need to know about you, another hack dividend investor."
Election year. New York New York 4th of July fireworks. Thanksgiving day parade. There’s no way that Donald does not find a way to help Mrs survive and flourish through this time. He will lose the presidency if Macy’s fails
"""Shaggy"" OK, I finally checked out the ""technicals"" for your Big M. The Short-Term Support Level is $15.11 a share. I should point out it's the same value, $15.11 for Long-Term SL too. As others have pointed out M's current pps is under Book Value. The RSI is just a hair under 40. However, this is why one must check multiple indicators, the Stochastics are around 9, when you average Fast & Slow Stochastics. Clearly an oversold condition currently. Hmm, an undervalued stock, not so quick everyone. In the last 10 trading days only (3) green candlesticks (buyers not in control). Five of the last candlesticks were all below the 20-Day Simple Moving Average, and Volume is what traders call ""Resting"". My retail pick, Amazon, sorry Shaggy, has been stuck sideways to down too. Also, a very bad 6+ months of performance...I don't like retail, yet, I hoped AMZN would do much better. I believe (M) & (AMZN) will pop soon the ""holidays"" after all, in addition the TV folks just told us, we had ""huge Wage Growth"" in 2019, LOL. **The Fed Chair, Mr. Powell, said that about Wage Growth not me!"
Unless you day trade this isnt about day to day. No stock goes straight up nor straight down. If you believe M will be higher in December then you hold... if not you sell.
Is Macy going to have to file bankruptcy today at the rate they are losing money should be just about out of money
holding until the end of the month. If no activity will sell.
Shopify does $1 billion in revenues and Macy's does $25 billion Macy's pays a dividend Macy's makes more money then Shopify does in revenues Macy's owns approx.$12-20 billion in real estate..Shopify has a market cap of 4 times of Macy's
$15 will take out the shorts And on to $18.5
Macy’s shorts be like......
Charts indicate oversold and a bottom. Refuses to trade below 5. Technically speaking this is a very Bullish signal.
I DON'T THINK THAT SHORTS REALIZE HOW QUICKLY M CAN GO MUCH HIGHER. 30% IN TWO OR THREE TRADING WEEKS ARE DOABLE IMO. LOOKING FORWARD TO IT. BAR SET LOW I AM LIKEN THAT!...LOL
And there is our 7.50 broken
What I see is Macy's emerging with a much stronger online sales presence. Short term pain may indeed lead to long term gain. Buy.
https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/05/11/macys-continues-reopening-stores-today-attracts-a.aspx?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&yptr=yahoo
We might hit $6 a share today.... Interesting making money....
"I believe Macy's people is smarter than I am , and they are working to survive. this share is totally undervalued.Load M now in stock discount promotion period."
"TGT is recovering well today, M is lagging. Looks like it's going to be a slow climb."
Lets keep it up over 3% all day and not do the usual trickle down to up $.03 by end of day.
"sad to hear, Macy's has phone app, I placed 2 orders just recently"
"OMG, What is going on. Is it actually going up. lol"
"Going up good today, it's about time. Let's check back around 3pm though. I don't think the overall market will finish in the green today."
"Last 4 days up/ 9%, 9% , 20% , 5% today? My guess 3 to 4 weeks 8.00 to 10.00!"
"If you want to 'hurt' the 'shorts' on this board, do not rate their posts, and do not reply to their posts.This will demonstrate to their bosses that their efforts here are 100% ineffective, and they won't get paid. ;)"
I bought at 6.66 usd; 6.48 usd and 6.42 usd. I still think today it can go to 6.20 usd. Around there I'll add more.Goodluck everyone. Congratz to the shorters!
"The chart is telling me that we could possibly see 5.50 usd in a week.. I think I'm just going to let this ship continue what it does, and do some treasure diving.. what do you guys think?"
"Went to Macy's website and all I saw were ""Closeouts"" and clothes not even my dead grandmother would want to wear."
https://walletinvestor.com/stock-forecast/m-stock-prediction
"Buy at 8-10, still over bought"
Macy’s was mentioned on squeak box Friday and nothing good was mentioned other than their huge debt
"clothes sales decline 2years, I think this. 2h year will strong rebound, covid-19 is free fall now,it sure be finished soon,so m won't bankruptcy,m sure be returning to history high,Macy's things still#1,people carrying Macy's shopping bags looks more than last year in Brooklyn,I visited Macy's kss bby and modell,their business not bad, it looks as same as last year,"
"Just bought 10000 shares, way too cheap at this level. The yield is incredible. GLTA."
"BOYS...TOMORROW MORNING WILL CONFIRM MY ""GREATNESS"". I READ THIS LIKE A BOOK. GOOD 3RD QUARTER, BUT THE KICKER WILL BE FOR AN IMPROVED 4TH QUARTER.....BANK IT!!!!"
hope amazon will buy macys at the end
"I hold 2100 shares of this store with avg price of $11 and I'm not planning to sell below $25. In 7 months will age 21 y.o. and just going to sell covered calls with strike 25 for my holdings of M. Maybe I'm a bit optimistic, but knowing the insanity of modern markets, institutions can easily pump this stock up to 50 in next 5 years and even higher, so I feel calm about this stock. What about the actual business, Macy's brand has loyal customers who are willing to spend their money in exchange for a great shopping experience.Have a nice ride, guys!"
100 percent gain is a few months! You betcha! Over 10 percent today alone!
I thought the earnings call got postponed until July 1st.
"I'm surprised the market liked the news of closing more than 100 stores after a few weeks ago M announced closing 37 Macy's and 1 Bloomingdale. I wouldn't be surprised if we don't move above $20 before earnings. With a 9% dividend most shorts won't mess with M as they'll end up paying the dividend if they hold long enough. My M dividend was $3472.00 on 02 JAN 2020 and I look forward to 02 APR 2020. I have only stepped foot in an Macy's once in Columbia, SC on Two Notch Road in 2005. Looked at their website for a rolex and they had a nice selection but I didn't want to pay the sales tax. I guess I should check if M has a store in SC as if they don't the sales tax doesn't apply."
Macy’s is best risk reward stock on reopening trade
Once Macys stock reaches 30s I expect most of the shorts to have covered. Then the stock will be less volatile. Rising gently and consistently over a long period
"M has been flat since morning, my guess is that before market closed today, it will go deep either direction. Either $5.25 or $4.8"
38 by next week.. today was unjustified drop
"Just a thought: Why would a chain like BURL have 2x the forward PE of Macy's? Ever walk into a BURL? Not a pretty sight to say the least. Don't get it it at all. As far as a retail chain goes, regardless of M carrying more debt, total shares, etc. - there is just no comparison as to which store one might want to step into if one is going to venture out into brick and mortar."
can't believe this - my bad feeling with M stack became real - drop harder
Low volume today. Same thing happened with GME right before it started moving higher.
Short-squeeze going by the script/manual:-) taking traction slowly but steadily........ and then suddenly some hefty intra-lift-offs. It‘s very important NOT to sell then. Let‘s all keep our nerves and prop Macy‘s back todouble-digits again. This American icon WILL survive............ whatever it takes............
"I see a green close today........ mark my words shorties! Macy‘s is going north......... whatever it takes........... 5ish, then 6ish, then 7ish, then 8ish, then 9ish, then double-digits and beyond......... whatever it takes.........."
"Before anyone calls me a short. I'm someone who has bought puts on Macy's because I believe it is overvalued and I want to make money. If I thought it was undervalued, I'd buy calls to make money. I don't want Macy's to fail, I want to make money on opportunities where I think things will fail. If my valid points that I've made annoy you and you dismiss them without considering whether they are valid or not, then perhaps you aren't trading Ior investing based on facts or trying to ascertain the facts, but purely on emotion. Take it from me, that doesn't end well. You must be prepared to consider both the pros and cons of a stock without dismissing one side of the argument as heresy if you want to make an informed decision."
Better than expected retail sales data just released for June. Wonder if that will show up in the top and bottom line for retailers like Macy’s.
Hey longs were getting close to 6.00
"No one cares what Joe B says. Vaccines and stimulus checks equal lots of people at the malls. Old people (Like Me, ok not that old) full vaccinated soon and like stores like Macys, spring coming. Many people either gained weight or lost during covid, need new things to wear. PLUS, just plain miss walking around with a red star shopping bag in their hand. All good for Macys share holders."
i'm not for the dividend. dividends are only bonus for me. great day for shorts to cover
"Comments from Vietnam confirmed the facts that Corona virus is merely a strong strain of the flu, all cases have recovered and no new cases found, mortality rate is zero percent. News media attempting to create false narratives in further hopes of creating havoc and panic hopefully leading to tanking the economy for obvious political reasons."
"I'll love that the shorts are claiming victory here. I like most value investors are incredibly discipline, we have a long term time horizon and view pullbacks of 7% as a buying opportunity. Macy's core businesses hasn't changed one bit since Friday. Mr. Market, I thank you for this opportunity!!!!"
If Amazon buys Macy’s that will be at a price of 30 dollars a share. Great synergies
Yahoo's bot says : Bullish pattern detected Double Moving Average Crossover
If biden wins he will lock down again and macys will test new lows .eventually bk
this is not good
"Just stay put, I have averaged down on this. My cost basis is 19. I owned this from the last low. I would have liked to have sold it in the high 30s, but I was waiting for the 1 year mark for taxes. This company will get the kinks worked out. They are righting the ship. They have good sales. Many companies will be revising earnings. Just stay put and don't let fear get you. Don't even think about the real estate M owns, it is working on upping it's revenue from sales of merchandise. It is hard staying in something that has gotten beaten up, but stay the course. If I remember correctly I think they were the number 5 retailer online as well this past Christmas."
maybe some big news on the way... AMZN buying Macys or some collaboration ...
"I was just lying about being long, I shorted this at 15.35 - 15.29 6000 shares, LETS GO!!!!!"
Starting my Christmas shopping on line for first time ever and Macy's is my choice.
"I don't know what's happening, but I like it a lot!!!"
"Carlos, never knew you were a liberal, should have guessed it given you always cite NYC store traffic though. Here is the rest of the story, actually finishing the quote that you pasted in your post.Official’s ViewLynn Franco, director of economic indicators at the Conference Board, struck a more optimistic note: “Expectations weakened slightly as consumers expressed some concerns about business conditions and job prospects,” she said in a statement. “However, confidence levels remain high and there are no indications that consumers will curtail their holiday spending.”I like how you cherry pick. Very progressive liberal of you."
I shop at Macy's.
Macy’s is still sponsoring fireworks. That means Macy’s bottom line is fine. Better shorts cover.
"There is something you need to understand in the markets right now. If you hold stocks, sell a day before er and buy it back 3-4 days later if the er was excellent. Take s look at companies that recently posted er. Appl, amzn, nvda, wmt, ttwo, irbt, amd, iq, the list is a very long one. Look at the charts they share something in common. Their stock plunged after er, regardless of beating or not beating, raising guidance or not. The market is irrational right now good earnings don’t matter. Another common thing with these stocks is that 3-4 days later, almost all of them start retracing back to pre earnings level"
They have $7.5 billion dollars of liquidity....This is a Strong Buy
"The 12 Month Price Target for Macy's Inc (M) was decreased to $ 3.00 by CFRA on May 23, 2020."
Even the schools are opening in California. Kids will buy at a higher price with such low inventory. Zoom to $12 in few weeks.
Now below 50 day!
"$10 closing ,,, Like GE.."
"tax cut will boost real estate price rise, Macy's would benefit, plus tax cut for consumers too, Macy's sales would rise, SO Macy's double win."
"As of February 2, 2019, the Company had $1,716 million of authorization remaining under its share repurchase program. The Company may continue or, from time to time, suspend repurchases of shares under its share repurchase program, depending on prevailing market conditions, alternate uses of capital and other factors."
"Right now the big money boys are playing with the stocks in the tech sector that they drove down to the single digits. Just look at how MU has been trading of late, it was the white elephant of the entire tech sector and now they are blowing it up. They will do the same for Macy's but it will be awhile, until then they will drop prices."
Frankfurt 11 % up.
"Shorties are getting desperate. The stock won't budge. A lot of new users dumping all the negativity into the forum to get everyone to sell. Remember, they want the stock to suffer. Your interests are not aligned with theirs."
"$5,20 and definitely wanting to go higher! Much higher ladies and gentlemen.......... whatever it takes (just look at DDS today: bad but better than expected - same thing with Macy‘s Q1). Go M go!!!"
"Not giving Jeffrey a free pass, looked like another weak report. He forecasted less net sales this year than the last 2, revenues down, eps down bad, comp sales down. Other than very low expectations beat, nothing to be thrilled over. Jeffrey is a disappointment!"
"Macy's call volume above normal and directionally bullish Bullish option flow detected in Macy's with 28,805 calls trading, 4x expected, and implied vol increasing over 3 points to 102.51%. 5/22 weekly 5.5 calls and May-20 5 calls are the most active options, with total volume in those strikes near 20,600 contracts. The Put/Call Ratio is 0.20. Earnings are expected on July 1st."
Probably will go back to $29 soon - when people realized that amazon junks won't sustain.
"There will be a Macy's parade next week after earnings, target is $32, let's go."
A tax cut will lift spirits for sure...look at Ford and Macy for superior yields...
"J. crew, Newman Marcus, JCpenny and now Sears is in trouble. Macy’s will get most of those customers. M is going up and up...."
"At least its not giving yesterdays gains back,,,,the beat wasn't a surprise to street it seems...M lost allot of trust cutting the div and it will take more than a few good quarters for it to prove itself again. I believe in M and am long but do not expect this to move much more for the time being...hope I am wrong..."
If Reddit is supposed to spike this to $21.....Now is a GREAT ENTRY POINT
I just bought macy because of diviend yield $ 0.38 per share (5%).. Today is last chance. Easy money making.
There comes a point at which this company becomes appealing as a target to be taken private. The balance sheet doesnt tell the whole story. The real estate assets are highly undervalued and if this continues to hover around the mid $20s then a buyout isnt out of the question. IMHO
"Shorts not yet covered. If that happened, this would be >$20 in no time."
"Tomorrow LB reporting monthly sales numbers, big boys are preparing for it in advance. Not sure why retailers reports monthly numbers, it likes inflicting wounds to yourself.."
New retail era under Trump. Macy's is the right bridge between online and brick and mortar revs..
Some profits before the next run to 15 !
"Macys, Khols and most retailers with higher P/E ratio is positive today. TLRD is way over sold. We need an announcement of an external candidate being hired as CEO. Given the low P/E ratio of TLRD and huge revenue of $3.7 Billion, it is easy to get the stock price in the $25 range."
why is it so cheap
"Longs, where you at"
Evercore investment rated M a buy with a price target of $22. I hope we can get some more
"High PE growth stocks are still out of favor; and rotation into low PE, good earnings, high dividend stocks, still looks like it is in. M is going to see some serious interest when the ""market"" realizes that its initiatives are working. Just be patient and the market will catch on to the positive story that M now presents. Strong fundamentals, debt reduction that yields cost reductions, better use of technology that yields higher productivity and margin increase, better stores that account for 50% of sales, better e-commerce app, better offerings with third party sellers developing, strong dividend that M will continue, big improvements in inventory management with shift to store level, better programs on shipping that reduce shipping costs, cost cutting announcement coming. This is going to be a good xmas season with consumer in good shape and discretionary spending will be one of the leading sectors. M is in the sweet spot, and shorts will help us when they decide to cover. Pluses possible if Brexit and;/or phase 1 trade agreement with China gets done. The interest rate drops and the Fed program to enlarge its balance sheet are already in, with another Fed rate drop probable. There is no recession likely, so it is looking like a good year end rally is developing, IMO. Risk is reduced when you get a 10% dividend for just holding. We should see another attack on $16 resistance, and once it gets through that, it can run a couple of dollars. Perfect time to be buying, IMO, but please do your own due diligence and thinking. Whatever you do, don't listen to short sellers who absolutely do not have your interests at heart, LOL>"
"What a great morning for Macy's stock. Up 5.5% and over 4 million volume in the first 20 minutes. Looks like a shortage sweat. Macy's is very strong right now and still under valued.Do well everyone in a long position. Wish you could party with me, unrealized earning of close to 30K.Happy holidays to all."
What could be better? M is taking an ax to costs with brick and mortar while crushing it online. It could be one of the top performers this year. Buy.
Right now is a bargain basement price. You guys better get in to ride the up tick Monday. Hedge funds will likely grab big chunks with this low price.
"270 stores open for Memorial Day weekend......... Macy‘s going back to normal, back to double-digits............"
https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/31/macys-to-be-replaced-on-sp-500-by-carrier-global.html
What is the Polaris strategy which Macy’s is going to provide an update in the earnings call?
"Eric shorted this stock at 6.90......he's still in the red.....once earnings are out in a week, M will go back to around 7.75....mark my words....in store and online sales are huge, better than precovid...."
"So our CEO is on 'Mad Money' tonight with Jimmy Cramer. I love the show and 90% of the time Jimmy loves retail as his Father was in department stores. Should be favorable for M. 10% of the time the CEO is a flop and the stock takes a hit. Wells Fargo's CEO Stumpf during the scandal was a flop. Gennette will be trying to sell his digital strategy and e-commerce. Talking about the half billion dollar M bond sale. Store closings in under performing Malls. Polaris theory should go over well. Have faith in Macy's, Bloomingdales and Blue Mercury."
Amazon Hostile BUY OUT COMING
According to Yahoo as of 10/14 almost 30% of the outstanding shares or float is short.
Macy’s For Christmas
You can look at the graph that indicates a positive upward direction. Don't get excited about negative scenarios
this stock should be up 4 dollars today
"Whole economy reopening with retail sales doing better than expected. NYC / NJ / CT already in Phase 2/3 with retail stores reopening. Macy's spectacular July 4th Fireworks is still on display this summer. If you are a true American, you would root for Macy's and support it! We need American companies like Macy's to keep the American family traditions alive and thriving as we know it - July 4th Fireworks & Thanksgiving Parade! Looking forward to a great 2nd half of the year with Macy's. $10+ soon. LFGM!"
i see a lot of interest for call options between 11-11.5 and very little interest on puts
"I went to Macy's and Bloomingdale's and besides it being a completely unacceptable behavior and hostile environment, with employees wearing masks it was empty. Stock is exactly like the Analysts said. Overvalued."
"11.5% up on a day when market is tanking. This will hit 9-10 dollar range in no time! Shorting a hyped up fluff stock like TSLA is one thing, shorting Macy's at 6-7 dollars is hoping for bankruptcy. If Macy's went bankrupt, think about all the jobs that will be lost. All the investors that will lose. I short stocks that are super high and not justified to be at those prices. I never short a good company hoping that it will go bankrupt just so that I can profit a few thousand. Shorts will lose!"
High target of $27!!!!!At this price Macy's is a HUGE BUY-OUT TARGET....Hold and BUY MORE!!!!!
Very bullish sign if we can keep $16 level
"Macy's showed last week that they can double in a week, so lets hope for another show"
Building a base! Much higher soon!
"M goes ex dividend in what 3 weeks. .3780 cents,helps mitigate the recent pain"
Confessions. I just enlarged my Macys position. An awesome safe dividend and tremendous upside capital gains potential.Selling unbelievably way below book value. The real estate alone makes this a steal today.
very very undervalued
"Macy's Q4 results will turn off all the negative comments. Btw, Macy's had such a good black Friday that they are paying even more of their debt off. Just wait for Q4 results while you get an easy 4% dividend for waiting long term."
$20 Stock
"So, today I was close to buying some Macy's. But instead I bought some ambev sa (beer brewer in Brasil), I know I know.. I love little disasters. The underdog.The Czech guy did he completely sell out? Anyone got a link? Thank you."
"Closing stores and breaking leases isn't free. Hence, the $500,000,000 in bond sales. What the heck, M is a growth stock as they shrink by 40 stores a year. E-commerce didn't save SHLD, Brooks Brothers or JCP but they spent millions on growing that part of their business. M to the moon baby!"
It’s quite obvious what some people in particular are doing to create negative sentiment on this stock. Never seen two people so concerned with the demise of a company. Go green Macy’s
"Been trying to get a rough valuation of Macy's Herald Sq. venture. They describe the upcoming project for 1.5m sq ft. For something similar, Empire State REIT has about 10million sq ft under management, some of it prime Manhattan area including the Empire State bldg, but some in other places. The market cap for ESRT is $5billion. Which makes M's real estate at Herald Square probably worth well over $1billion, perhaps closer to $2billion. It is prime location and one expects a new skyscraper will be more modern and get higher rents than the Empire State Bldg. M has a market cap of $5billion, so the real estate value alone at Herald Sq alone is probably 1/3 of the market cap."
"Macy's has not formally confirmed its next earnings publication date, but the company's estimated earnings date is Wednesday, August 12th, 2020 based off prior year's report dates."
$8 closing..Hopefully $10 before holiday
M reached a new 52 Week High at 32.22

"Bullish option flow detected in Macy's with 16,525 calls trading, 3x expected, and implied vol increasing almost 2 points to 35.36%..."
"My Visit to Herald SquareI took a tour of Macys' flagship store. The Christmas windows are as wonderful as ever. The main floor was a bustling, vibrant showcase. Visually it is very stimulating, edging on bedlam. There were many shoppers on a Friday night. Every major high-end brand has a sign, a kiosk, a little shop of its own - Coach, Vuitton, Tag Heuer, an entire Apple Store, etc ad infinitum. Everything is brightly lit, full of video and color, and of course, there is another glazing of Christmas decor on top of it all. The second and third floors were brightly lit and sharp-looking. Again, major brands had their own little sections all around. In fact, many brands such as North Face have more than one mini-store in the store.Some of the older sections, on upper floors, have scarcely changed. I easily recognized the counter where I bought my first Braun electric razor many decades ago. It still has Braun appliances stacked all around. The idea of ""destination shopping"" is in evidence, but not yet fully developed. You can take cooking lessons there! There are many places to eat and drink, including a gelato shop. The children's floor even has a McDonalds. Know that each floor of Herald Square has more retail space than my entire local mall. In a few short hours, I didn't see everything. Conclusions: the Christmas season looks to be going well. Throngs of energetic young salespeople were selling to throngs of shoppers on the main floor. All your favorite brands are available for purchase. But some areas, on the upper floors, were quite quiet. Redecoration and redesign proceed apace, but large areas remain untouched."
Vaccine News raising AFTER HOURS.... High $10.27 so far...... OPEN above $11 tomorrow
M is strong
Larger AUM fund mangers realize the potential value that Macy's still has:https://ir.stockpr.com/macysinc/sec-filings-email/content/0001104659-21-018560/tv01320-macysinc.htm
"So any state or municipality retirement fund manager could plunk half of their assets between Macy's and Signet and basically ensure an average return of 11% on just yield alone and hold the stocks for years as they both will eventually return to graces.

Macys an Amazon company. should buy the brand and be done with this one at 17.50- 18.00 and be done with it.
Covid News: Canada now has enough doses for the entire country's population. Hopefully this will be the same for our friends in the USA and the economy will boom including Macy's
"I received my $1887.50 Div today for my 2000 shares,stock will bounce back soon,no problem."
"I love how goldman downgrades to sell and the stock springboards up, their opinion seems highly regarded lol."
what is the future of the dividend ?
"I feel so sad for those who will wait through this long weekend, only to find that Macy's has dropped down to $12 again."
M to the moon...
Macys stores are absolutely gorgeous and they are packed with incredible merchandise.I love shopping online and in person at their stores.Shopping at Macys stores in person is so much fun!Helpful employees that make it a joy to shop at and their prices are awesome.That is why I am a customer and stock holder.
There are junk stocks and junk companies and Macy is the worst of them All because it is run by DEM wits that screw over the shareholders to line their own pockets. They have stolen billions from the shareholders just to keep getting pay checks when they should have shut the company down before they wasted all the money. Now the only thing left you get to lock forward to is the DEM wits telling you they wasted all the money from the real estate and have to file bankruptcy
when will the fall stop?
I’m enjoying my $6 price average
They do not want this green..
DEM wits running Macy's right into bankruptcy as they lined their own pockets with all the shareholders money.
$30 before June. Way oversold and low market cap. Time is on my side.
I think retailmaggedon picks up steam tomorrow. Also contagion is likely. get some Index puts for tomorrow.
Macy's needs a Miracle on 34th Street
Macy’s will return big and powerful company. Just hold on the stock and you will be rewarded in to the future. My local Macy’s is packed with shoppers with no end in sight. It’s like Christmas in May. God bless America and Macy’s stock holders.
People on Reddit talking about squeezing Macy's look for volume.
I have been watching this stock and am finally all in. The dividend in the past was great and they are aligned to double over the next few months
Agree with Morgan Stanley PT 27.
20s are coming to a station near you soon!
"Hundred underperformance stores will be, and e-commerce worth 25% of sale. So Macy’s near future revenue will likely decline but profits should be big. As Macy’s on line getting better over time then overall revenue will increase. Just saying!"
"Okay who wants to buy Macys. We pay a premium for the company or $27.50 per share x 308 million shares outstanding = $8,470,000,000. Go private and use the dividend to pay off the loan each year with money to spare. Sell 300 stores, pay off the leases and some debt, and keep only the best properties. Operate the company for 4 years while paying off all the remaining debt. Then dump the inventory, sell all the other properties except the NY Macy's and Bloomingdale's buildings and be debt free owning the buildings outright - 5 billion profit at least."

Algorithmic trading going to pump up the volume on this stock soon. Has to happen based on the bounce.
All I can say is Macy's valuation is ridiculously UNDERVALUED based on the rest of retail that trades 12-20 times earnings
Nice day! Huge gap-up tomorrow! Short-squeeze has just started.......... Big boys will bring this back to double-digits again.......... whatever it takes...........
"Fed will not rise rate this year and maybe don't rise rate next year, so Macy's sales can return to growth soon, Macy's still very healthy no sick,"
"Looks like I picked the wrong retail stock. Target, Walmart or Nordstrom would have been nice."
Hey shorties can you Short JWN or KSS ..would like to start a position there
"real estate is going up, stuff they sell going up, traffic on stores is going up, online sales going up, at the same time they are saving costs."
"And 5ish again! Now keep up the strong buy power! Tomorrows Annual Shareholder Meeting, many many stores/malls reopening and shirt-squeeze getting more and more traction......... whatever it takes........."

I looked at the boards and I see so many shorts sellers. The first thing come to my mind. THIS IS BUY SIGNAL
Watch the after hours. Big boys will be buying
Lots of Accumulation this afternoon.... by big players
M can easily hit $10 with a short squeeze. This kind of action just feeds on itself. Be ready for the big pop in the coming days.
You guys think we see 30s this week?
Nomansky was buying shares at over $40. Never forget and never listen to his 20 accounts on this message board.
"accumulating and stockpiling M shares below $8/share. hope to add another 10,000 shares at lower prices throughout the week."
"They should have bought back $450M in STOCK, not cheap debt..."
low 14.50 and high 16.00 today
"M going the way of Gamestop , AMC and Best Buy?"
"Six dollar drop based on (below) seems a bit extreme.""sales will grow about 2 percent, down from a previous outlook of at least 2.3 percent, the company said in a statement Thursday. Profit will be as much as $4 a share. It had previously forecast as much as $4.30."""
How many Discounts upon Discounts has Macy's given & U Still Expect Same Margins? lol
"Debt certainly encourages growth. However, the debt of this company is too large.The company should change course and focus on increasing gross profit, reduce the debt to less than 1B, and then give back to customers and maintain the brand. Dividends can be paid later.Japanese style. Create and invest cash rather than debt.It is the responsibility of the company to make all eps positive at least for the quarter."
"This pandemic really was good for Macy's as it forced them to reinvent their business model. Growth looming, $20 soon."
"I dare say predictable. They try to sell some good news, get people to buy on hysteria and then it turns out the good news isn't as good as Wallstreet wants and boom. This is how they make the big bucks ;)"
"dividend over 5%return over 11%sounds pretty goodgot rid of a lot of poor stores, maybe they are healthy now?"
The shorts have a long way to cover . macys going a lot higher. Thanks for the gift .50 drop . bought more in the 7.49 ish
Macy's closed over $27.Wow!
Anyone see the jobs reports released this morning? Normalcy returning quicker than expected and with avengence.
"M has paid regular dividends since 2003 without fail. Will they stop or reduce the dividend when they are expected to earn around $3/share? Unlikely. The dividend probably is safe, and they even might do some stock repurchasing too if they think the PPS is too low. If M continues the dividend, gets costs down, pays down the debt - a lot of iffs, I would think the stock is way oversold. Just keeping the current dividend going should make this an attractive income play; and the forward PE is very low right now. I wonder how the Christmas season sales will go with employment being low and the consumer spending apparently strong. There is potential here for a nice turn around from these levels. Obviously, the PPS might go lower if Trump keeps piling on the tariffs and that raises costs, but, on the other hand, it could get a nice boost if Trump and China agree to roll back some of the threatened tariffs over the weekend. Hard to predict the near term, but I think M will get some cost reductions and the profits will come back up. You have to remember that sales increased year over year and the factors that hurt profits can be changed. M has a growing on line presence and a lot experience in their business. Will management improve the profit picture this Christmas? I don't know but, this is a very out of favor stock right now and things could change. I think the institutions will stop selling soon since the PPS is in a very realistic place right now; and then, in a few weeks it could see a nice bounce from here."
"You know it is rather humorous how the dumpers come on to the site to trash the company and stating that all of the other retailers are up today. Well have any of them looked at the volumes of this individual stocks? Macy's consistently has volumes which exceed their daily average shares traded, meanwhile the other retailers are at half or even less than daily averages of shares traded. This leads me to believe that there are forces at play here which are attempting to drive this price down. Is it computerized trading, is it large funds working in unison to try and tank the price, not sure, but the volume discrepancies between Macy's and the other major retailers seems to be a red flag that some form of manipulation or control is in play."
I am a value investor. I buy all the dips I can handle.
I still have all my shares. I bought puts before earnings i case it did not go well. Long shares doing great today and rolled up my puts to 10 strike. My share cost basis is 9. So my max risk is a 1 profit.
CBS NewsCBS News@CBSNewsTotal retail sales this holiday season added up to a record $598 billion dollars — up $33 billion from last year ..
Lots can happen over the weekend... exercised PUTs might cover the short position or continue to hold the short position...
"Small investor shakeup. No need for panic. Stores are opening, losses are less than expected. Positive impact of stimulus packages will be more apperant when everyone goes back to work. I don't think this will ever see 4s again. 2 weeks time we will see 6s."
"buy Macy's and kss can make huge money,because clothes sales and shoes sales looks very strong in Brooklyn,in their stores the shoppers looks more than last year, see nke reach history high."
"Volume 10,300,871"
"Big week coming up for the broad market, with a good chance S&P500 can move to a new all time high. If it rallies, odds are good that the retail group will move up, and, of course M will be included. Watch how M does relative to the other retail stocks now that it has pre-announced its high dividend yield. Looks like another chance to take out resistance at $16, IMO."
"Last year this time Macy's had less debt, more shareholder's equity, a dividend, and expectations of EPS of $2.It was trading roughly at this level.Fast forward a year and it has more debt, less shareholder's equity, no dividend, and the whisper number is $0.40. It is hard to believe that this can trade at 20 times forward earnings and the same level it was last year this time!To top it all off, Macy's management refused to give any guidance in November and no sales update in early January as they did in year's past. That combined with hundreds of store closures doesn't give me confidence."
"Okay Baron, I'm all in, but this is it. I've lost my shirt following your advice on M, T and MO. Do you mean it will be $20 very soon or $.20 very soon? Please clarify"
"Ah, the bleeding is not done. Between the real estate value, 1.39B Free Cash Flow, 6.18% dividend with a 27% payout ratio; The upside far outweighs the downside here."
"Remember when Jim Cramer was living in his car ? Now he is a stock guru telling people back in 2010 to sell Starbucks at $5 bucks and now he says buy Starbucks at $78 bucks a share. Someone should ask him to show his charitable trust holdings on the air, and ask him why he is still working at 70 years old."
"KSS portends categorical downturn. Data breach means M online buying is unsafe & will pile on slipping sales. Called ~$14 last time & I WAS RIGHT. M going to $14~ish soon, &  churn there awhile until it is dumped ex-div. "
"By April when Noobz get their 1st Peanut 38-cent divvy, M gonna be down in the $12's, aye Hypsterz? lol Dec-09-19 Downgrade Goldman Sachs Neutral → Sell $19 → $12Oct-18-19 Downgrade Cdt Suisse Neutral → Underperform $19 → $12"
the real value is much more than $20
"Sell used clothes, rofl....they cant even move the inventory they have and want to add more? The customer experience isnt there, they dont get it. Of course, when a Lampert is being pulled you dont care...Will continue going down. Not one great dividend investor is recommending M, even with 9% yield. It is the laughing stock of Wallstreet."
This is a n 8 dollar stock at best. Look at all the PUTS being purchased..LOL..... Its a broken biz model that needs severe overhaul. Being anywhere near 17 is a gift to sell. Will be 12-13 in a fe w weeks when market corrects.
Who wants to be a millionaire?Buy Macys while it is a fraction of it's TRUE value.
"Notice how CNBC ignores talking about M, only when it's bad news. Big boys are still short in this thing and their buddies (CNBC) trying to help them at the old game. Also notice how MM's can hold this down on great volume? All of these things tell the truth about M stock. Heading up my friends."
"Retail Sales, especially clothing improving much faster than expected with whole economy reopening. $10 soon. Let's go long Macy's!"
"All stocks are down, minus well buy Macy’s to make some money while it’s up"
Macy's will entered a $2.0 billion asset based revolving credit facility soon...stock pop +40%

"the more shorties post here, the more likely ER will beat by vast amount, could see 18-19 today! What do yall think?"
Investors in tech that went from a $1T company to a 2T company in less than a year is going to be in for a big surprise once normalcy returns. Things do eventually return to normal think 911.. think financial crisis.... maybe some minor changes but nothing worth going from 1T to 2T market cap type of changes.
See how that works? Bounced off the projected low (within a few cents) and now just in a few days on low volume big boys were able to accumulate millions of shares on the cheap pushing the stock down and grabbing all those stupid people with stop losses set up. Same game for decades!
Only 3 trading days left to capture M's next quarterly dividend which goes ex-dividend on June 13. Based on Friday's close it has an annual yield of 7.4%.
"M can reach new high in short-term if Fed cut rate in this meeting, because Fed raise rate too many times hurt high ranking retailers last year, so cut rate can boost Macy's sales strong growth and it's real estate price going up ,"
Time to buy!!
"M has much more value than Nordstrom in regards to its real estate, high dividends to share holders and low P/E. Yet its share price is much lower than Nordstrom. Management is buying back shares and refinancing debts. No doubt M will reach upper 30 by year end."
Bad omen up 6.66%
Closing above nine and climbing over ten next week. Time to buy up shares while they are cheap. Sorry Short Man
Get in when it’s $17-18. Safest below $16.
went to Macys' again ... very messy clothes everywhere
"Amazon needs brick and mortar to compete effectively and put Costco, Walmart and Target out of business.Macys has one of the best real estate locations in the USA and would be a great addition to Amazon."
"smoke and mirrors. this is the short of the year. who do they think they are kidding? oh yes, the Robin hood and other basement dwelling newbies. very sad"
MANY HUGE GREEN BARS.... ON the Way!!!!
"really good buying on big relative volume so far today... not sure what's happening, but I'll take it."
Shorts money
"45-Million Shares Sold, -16%. Weeeeeeeeee!Bot 24AUG $35.50 Calls @0.95 last 3-minutes.Zumbody said buy the 'dip,' HEE HAW! lol"
Seems like dividend announcement is overdue....what gives????
Stock is heading to 20s in a few short weeks. There is no competition left for Macy's. It will see 100s in less than 2 years. Things are developing rapidly on the vaccine and treatment front. Digital sales will be a major part of the revenue.
Macy's is worth $47 a share!
3000 shares after hours Hope it’s worth it... New here
"You look at Costco and TGT. If gov allow customers to go big box stores with masks, I see no reason why you can't malls with masks.In fact, here in Oregon, we have malls opened and everyone wears masks."
Wednesday am possible Holiday sales update by Macy's and Kohls...JCP just posted after the bell
It’s a miracle if this finishes green today
This is PANIC sell off ...once.weak hands are gone we should see $17 in a very short mins
"Why is there not more volume on the options with this stock for next week? If big money anticipated a huge run up in price, looks like the $8 $8.50 $9 strike price calls would be heavy in trading.. likewise. I fall in price, one would think the $6 puts would be heavy in volune.. nope.. even at .11 cents per contract. There is nobody buying them up ?? So. This means the earnings report is not going to affect the stock price one way or the other??"
sell it going be painful the next 6 earnings call
Toodays action shows you how hard shorts worked on Thursday to hold macys down. As this post it is up $1.00 on five million shares. On Thursday this traded 60 million shares and closed up twenty cents. On that volume it should have been up three to six dollars. Shorts will be getting pay back from this point on. Make sure your shares have a gtc sell order at $15 or higher. This prevents shorts from borrowing the shares to short more and means they will have to cover at higher prices.
"Wow M is onsale now, all week high was $23. It is now under $8 with potential dividend like in the past!"
buy buy buy up up up
I’m not invested but I hope this company recovers post coronavirus - Amazon Day Parade just doesn’t sound right
"$20 billion worth of real estate, $6.82 billion market cap, $7.91 billion of debt. Unlike the other retailer, it never lost money. In another word, it worth much more than it was a year ago when it was $41/share. 7% dividend, Price/book = 1.08, P/E = 6.22, it will continue to make money although the growth is predicted to slow down. What if it starts to grow again? Why not? Economy is good and is getting better. It is not just a brick and mortar store now. It is the fourth largest online company in this country."
I see Macy’s and Kohl’s advertisements online . These two are very competitive online. Based on the pricing and sales I see Macy’s and Kohl’s are in a better place than last quarter. UBS got it wrong.
Buy zone is almost over. You wont find it this prices :D Besides November is always the Macy's month. November 20 M is above $12.
2-hrs ago' lol; https://finance.yahoo.com/news/retail-sales-declined-in-december-153022812.html
"If the market crashes again I think I'm gonna buy Macy's. It's apparent Macy's cannot be killed, lol. How in the hades is this thing still hanging on?"
"Chad, Valuehoud - Macy's is 29.05 now. Is this surely the lowest it will go and I should cover now? Please advise."
#1 Department store operator.... Amazon will want to buy them while stock is dirt cheap and offering a premium to todays stock price would still be getting them dirt cheap.Remember Amazons goal is to dominate retail and buying up all the competition is a way to do it. Macy’s has a 5 billion online sales which would fold neatly into Amazons business.
Today I do my Christmas shopping at Macy’s - let’s see how my $5000 spend impacts the share price
OPENING DAY TOMORROW. Macy’s WILL OPEN STORES ON MONDAY. Stock will open $8-$10
Should start moving back up later today after scared shares are sold and we get back to squeezing the shorts. Just hang in there and you’ll be rewarded later this week.
OPTION ACTIVITY HUGE... NAJARIAN MENTIONED ON CNBC
M just posted Q2 earning call Sept. 2 bmo. Not this week.
Huge short interest increase not going to work out well for shorty. great time to get in or double down.
After being ripped off with cheap/junk almost defunct amazon products (no quality control) I moved to Macys. Never had an issue and a lot of the women like their makeup store. Blue Mercury.
"10 Stocks Seen as End-of-Year Bargains as Tax-Loss Selling SurgesM gets the well deserved label, ""bargain"" and recommended as depressed oversold stock ripe for a year end buy by those expecting a nice recovery in the coming year. If right, M also sports a great dividend to cushion risk and add to gains."
Glad I jumped in yesterday. This will go up all the way until summer.
What's wrong with this picture?The stock is down 40% over the past 6 months and the longs are taking a victory tour.
Hoping it would be the beginning of BULL trend!
Low volume in tight range. Expect Santa to come early. Next week will be a great week for Macy's!!
"I told you guys when it was even $47.90 it is going to $34 this week and $30-33 next week. Macy’s going to is normal price which is $30-33, unfortunately. I love Macy’s, I go there buy clothes for me and my girlfriend and when I see it is full of people like in Christmas in New York I sell you that they will have a lot of sales and stock goes from $24 all the way to $44, you just need to wait. But when Macy’s sales decline I tell you sell the stock for now because it is long process for it go get back where it was. I won’t be surprised if in couple of weeks it will stabilize at $25 - 28. I think I will stop buying Macy’s until next quarter."
"JCP's gonna to BK, but M will survivehttps://www.fool.com/investing/2020/04/27/why-macys-stock-is-rising-today.aspx"
If M traded like Kohls we would be at 45 and if we traded like Nordstroms we would be over 60
I just went to Macy’s in 34 th Street in manhattans and it is full of people. So I bought 10000 shares
"Well managed, less mall competition, fatigue from shopping at Walmart and Target, and a vaccine before the holiday season kicks off will send us to $15 before year end. All aboard!"
Panic and lose out. 2021 is a green year - big time for Macys.
"It’s important to get your daily serving of SHORTS, I get mine with this handy juicer I just bought from Macy’s."
"Shorts Look what's just Breaking: Macy's Is Turning 2 Stores Into Fulfillment Centers: Here's Why, Both stores will serve primarily as fulfillment centers. Macy's says that this is to meet the surge in e-commerce demand it has experienced lately. (Digital sales jumped 53% year over year last quarter.)"
to the moon!!!
The pain will end when all longs are broke and forced to sell giving shorts easy shares to buy.
No reason to be down today with that good beat
looks good :)
"Tomorrow will be interesting, to short or to buy?"

What time do they release earnings?
R stands for Rectuum
Where is everybody ?
"Been following this thread for awhile. 1) regarding the shorts: pigs get slaughtered, who stays short into this massive of a drop and into potential positive news tomorrow? 2) Since we are into corporate socialism vis a vis billions to banks back in the 2009 and then now with stimulus for other industries in the trillions, why not give to retailers? By way of lockdowns and other draconian measures, the govt is effectively creating a unlevel playing field where Amazon wins big and box stores go bankrupt. It is capricious and arbitrary. I'm in for couple thousand shares of M."
"Ready between the lines folks. Basically flat sales which means all things being equal, closing 29 more under performing stores means less overhead and more profits!"
"I started buying at $40.00 and bought al the way down. My average price now, $13.00. Looking forward to dividends again."
Still have plenty of room to growth. Strong buy guys.
"Breaking news! This just in...Macy's stock price spikes, then falls again...guess that's just old news, my bad."
"For those of you wondering...YES, this is going to sell off AGAIN!"
New and improved Macy's
It's like the whole world is shopping at Macy's today.
Csn Macy's prosper in an Amazon world!?
Out of insanely overpriced NASDAQ to beaten up sectors!! Rotation in full swing!
Macys. Love it as a customer and investor!Bright days are getting brighter
"What Macy's needs to do is simply perform as expected. It is funny how the shorts will come out and claim they are on the verge of collapse and that they will be bankrupt in a matter of months, yet it is funny that they said the same thing about Bed, Bath and Beyond. It hits its 52 week low on Aug. 15, yesterday, almost ten weeks later, based on a decent report but not a stellar report, its price is up almost to the penny, 100%. So give me a break with all of the bashing, this has nothing to do with performance or concerns about bankruptcy, it has everything to do with the narratives that Wall Street is promoting that are economy is imploding and that a recession is imminent and that all brick and mortar retail is doomed, that is, until Wall Street wants to profit from it as they have done in the case of BBBY."
Insiders bought 10000 shares At 29.2
Freedom sorry your Puts are going to expire worthless.Chalk it down to a life lesson.Buying and selling options isnt investing it is gambling You obviously need to do your homework before going out on the limb like that. Macys is in an improving situation. Not the opposite. Macys is very undervalued! Bad stock to short or buy putsNo chance puts worth anything!
http://www.al.com/business/2020/07/macys-black-friday-in-july-sale-offers-up-to-75-percent-off-includes-huge-daily-deals.html
I agree. It seems we may finally have broken out of a holding pattern. Could blast up from here if shorts start covering:
Does the closing of many JCP stores mean more sales for Macy’s?
"It should settle at a new range, I'm not sure what range we will be trading next. My expectation is the 5.20 - 6.20 USD range. What do you guys think?"
"Hoping for a 3 for 3 at earnings. An earnings beat, a raise in guidance, and a healthy share repurchase announcement."
Get ready for a 10 cents qtrly. dividend which will accurately reflect shrinking profitability.
I could fire a cannon inside Macy's and not kill anyone.
The credit sector will give Macy's a tailwind.
going to disappoint big time. retail stores are history
Macy's is a long term winner they have improved their digital sales once COVID is contained shoppers will return
"Go Macy‘s go!!! Want‘s to close 5ish.......... And then BIG spikey-spikey coming! REALLY BIG!!!! It‘s so overdue........ Big news out any minute....... Annual Shareholders Meeting this Friday, 15th May 2020.....,,..."
will we see $15 this this year?I think so
Good sign!https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/macys-m-recently-broke-out-above-the-20-day-moving-average-2021-04-28
"Just picked up some more at $4.68 to average down below $5. Long term, this is a bargain!"
Just like BBBY recently had a quick 30% upside move I expect the same for M. under 6 times earnings and a low bar says it all.
"I'm long, but a 1000 point up day in the Dow and this is up $.04 kind of makes you wonder whats really going on.....?"
"The analysts seem to really like Children's Place, LULU, Restoration Hardware, Nordstorm's, Ulta, Target, Wal-Mart, Best Buy, etc.. So is it true that ALL retail stocks are in trouble, no, just the false narrative that many of the shorts would like to portray. Amazon will fail miserably with their Whole Foods experiment, they will spin it back off as an independent grocer again by the end of 2020 in an IPO at half the value that they paid for it. If it were not for the AWS business Amazon would have already declared bankruptcy. Eventually the FTC will go after them as violators of anti-competitive pricing regulations. They have lost money in retail business since inception."
"Wow what explains the 2 pops at 12 and 12:20??I see 30 plus block trades but don,t know time they were done? I see price is slowly coming back downMy thoughts are it will close down today??"
Sears lost JC Penny lost. The winner is Macy's . Macy's is the winner in the Retro shopping experience. there really was only room for 1.
Long since $10.73. Was nice to see we were up 40% and was looking to sell but my broker (trading 212) has been down since market open
"Good report and the price objective of 30 was achieved this morning. The easy money has been made, at 19 it was a steal. I sold half my position this morning at 30.5 and will keep the rest for my long term account. I believe Macy´s will do fine. Today turn around I believe has to do a lot with a former CEO of Bloomingdales talking BS on Bloomberg. Sounded like an angry ex employee."
Maybe we can drive the DEM wits at M to ZERO. LOL Sense M management wants it to drop so they can reprice their own stock options Jets see if we can drive it to ZERO to help the out. Pure DEM wits at M for not protecting their shareholders.
"Earnings! 9/02/20. Surprise to the upside, with or without creative accounting! Look at all the Form 4's. Upper level management has been paid with stock grants since June. No sells yet! Restructuring, yes! BK no!Look for much negative news/innuendo because of the inevitable short squeeze! Macy's is an icon! If Macy's fails then America fails. The fed will back stop them as long as they move forward! (just my thoughts/reasons for going long at $6.33 today!) Best wishes!"
"There isn't any doubt in my mind that Macy's is a fantastic store to visit. I always enjoy being there. Visually impressive and when the sales are there I always buy. Not like the ""discount department store. Walmart, Target etc all dire. This is why I will continue to hold onto my share (I have also bought more). Macy's has plenty of store in states that don't have increasing virus cases. All stores should turn away customers without face masks and they should be reported to the police."
"See, I told you, KING of the 52 week low. Going to 14 next, smh."
"The end of COVID-19 will not come early and easily, maybe next year. But I believe there are still lot of people want try their clothes on before they pay the bill. Macy’s will survive and it will go up, hopefully... But when..."
Many stocks up today except our Macy's. Sad day.
I was at the mall yesterday in LI NY and it was packed. Macy's was busy. I have a hard time believing the doom and gloom blanket statements that all brick and mortar is dead.
"20 soon, maybe today"
"This stock has done absolutely nothing all day. Let me guess, it will drop even lower by close."
"Macy's is now a ""Fully Compressed Spring"".....Any good news will cause this to ROCKET!"
"Probably going back to high 4's low 5's, then will rip higher. A lot of crazy program trading going on to lower the market. That and the media is pumping out fakenews of covid-19 surges, when in fact, it's more people going out and getting tested. The numbers have always been higher than what was shown officially."
"Q1-sales numbers out tomorrow before markets open. My take is bad (like almost every company in times of COVID), but BETTER than expected. Tomorrow Macy‘s-CEO also in a fireside-chat with JP Morgan. Will be very interesting. Also of interest is the reopening of all 775 stores/malls by mid June the latest. Every third outstanding share is sold short. I smell an epic short-squeeze......... EPIC............ whatever it takes........."
forget the div no one is going to malls macys will sales will be down 80 percent next qter if not worse stock goes to 5 maybe
Tough buying a falling knife.
"Macys, Buy Online And Pick Up In Store!Macys online, has been visited by 100K+ users in the past month.It's going to be a GREAT Holiday Season !!!"
25 by May long weekend
Low volume gives MM's the opportunity to do two things. Shake out long term investors and compress profits on options. Totally normal. Important to see if it holds in the high $16's and bounces or if it is going to test a lower number. I am thinking bounce.
The poor sap that bought at 5.07 today.....smh
"Macy's is reopening stores for Memorial Day weekend:https://eu.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/05/21/coronavirus-reopening-macys-memorial-day-weekend-shopping/5234732002/Back to normal slowly but steadily, back to double-digits……..."
"Let's go Macy's, get up there. It will be back at 30 in no time."
Looks like Trump is making a deal with China and no new tariffs and even rolling back old tariffs 50%. Anyone who's been following retail knows what tariffs are doing to the retail industry stocks prices this past year. Can you imagine the time and effort admin has to spend worrying about how to mitigate these new tariffs looking for other sources etc just to maintain the botton line... now they can breathe a little easier and focus more on the business and be more competitive with pricing and while maintaining better margins with this this. Look for M to trade back above 20 by years end.
Wow never seen so many posters bash a stock like this...the true numbers of Macys has a good outlook. Did anyone see there earnings report? They crushed it...IMO Macys is a good buy because with all these other high end stores closing it's just pushing more shopping at Macys. The competition is closing up and Macys is the beneficiary. The only reason it's this low of course is the pandemic. Low balling the value once the pandemic subsides is well over 14. People are chopping at the bit to go shop and get out of the house. Hopefully J&J vaccine is effective and this will return to normal.
Apple using Corona virus as reason for missed revenue. I guarentee Gennette is thinking how great that excuse is right now. $1k he uses it during earning release.
"I have a Q guys, how could a stock with 1.4m float, trade with 3.2m shares in one day? Thank you"
Brad never learns. Keep shorting M and you will never move out of mom’s basement.
"State Street Corp bought 16.6m shares FRIDAY, their NOT buying that short people...If their putting $87M into Macy’s feel secure about our lunch money..."
"In light of the growing risk of pandemic virus' a swing over to internet sales activity by management is probably a good idea. If you go out to shop at WalMart you run a greater risk of getting coronavirus or whatever because poor people shop there and can't afford medical services. Macy's attract a different crowd. Shopping there I am less worried. In order to keep up that image, Macy's only needs to keep up a number of stores while making the web pages awesome as well. Do they keep up with the store front image? I think so."
I'll sit on my 10 % dividend for a few years..... sure beats my 1.8% savings account
Buy Macy's now!!! Keep until atleast mid-November too see price back up to $25-30 a share!
Let's ask Reddit to help us )
It's obvious that mid-December holiday sales trailed off due to overall market action. When people see their account balances in freefall they don't go splurging in department stores. This is a major overreaction. Numbers are still solid.
Macy's must have hired good accountants.
"This is a trading vehicle and nothing else atm until proven otherwise in the long-term future. As of right now, treat it as such. Massive bounce before an equally large pullback."
"Will Macy's continue to support their high dividend yield when tariffs and the lower consumer confidence rate hit both their top and bottom line? After Friday's comments, the 2nd half of the year could be a lot bumpier that anyone has anticipated."
45.06% of float is short
If you think Macy's will survive then load up. I can't believe it can get to this point but here we are. I am selling puts here.
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/valuation-macys-properties-170952570.html
Macy should buyback shares instead of paying dividends ! Seams the dividends do nothing for the stock price .
Patience. This will pass too.Greener pastures soon.
M can see 15.75+ this week and 20+ is just around the corner now that shopping mall are able to open up again and the 1.9 trillions is approved over the weekend.
"Imagine buying a stock at a third of the price it was trading at 3 months ago. Stores are reopening, money coming in, debt being paid. This baby could pop at the slightest amount of good news."
ZERO investor confidence
Sold at $6.77It wouldn't be the first time CNBC is recommending and next day big drop.Be carefull guys. (!)
"Outside the box thinking: places like planet fitness are clamoring for real estate. find enterprises in which services are looking for spots, lease them, attempt to cater to the lessees’ service product offerings (sportswear for planet fitness for the sake of this example) while also drawing in foot traffic. do maybe special promotions on certain days. Try to monetize this plethora of real estate with some sort of product/service that can be a mutually beneficial relationship. I honestly have been thinking about that for a decent period of time. Smart real estate trusts that have retail have recently been going this route with gyms and other services in which draws people via their core business and cannot be substituted by online commerce. But I don’t know if that’s a possibility but I hope management is exploring everything. Not like they’d read this board."
"gary did you check out the Dillard numbers last week? Or did you see how Cato Fashions reported this morning? Of course not, you are part of the traders' block trying to drop the retail sector prices yet again before the big holiday season."
remind me please to sell at 30$
"There are many longs on this board that cannot read or understand financials and only see the 30+ stock price of a year ago and expect it to return to those levels. The problem is that Macy's is in deep debt and deep trouble. After initial holiday results in two weeks, Macy's will sink to about 13."
Just break 8 ffs shorts will have to cover and this is 8.50 easy
What can CEO say?--Virus contagious while still in incubation stage. Hehehe
"After buying at $30.00 and cost averaging as the stock dropped, I am in the black on Macy's for the first time. I almost want to sell it because it ticked me off for so long and I wanted it out of my portfolio for so long. I think I'll keep it for awhile. Will there be a dividend again?"
"Average price target is a tripple seven $7,77....... seems rather conservative to me. I say Macy‘s going to double-digits in coming weeks and months. Several catalysts in the cards........"
"In many ways M is like AMZN that has its Cloud Segment supporting its Merchandising. Likewise, Macy's has its R/E Segment (Selling-off Properties) Supporting its Merchandising Segment. lol"
"Imagine Macys stock at $100/share. Wow! Would that be massive profits for the long stock holder! $70,000 becomes $1,000,000. People you need to set your sights higher. This company is extremely well managed. This isn't a dream, its reality. In the short term expect precovid share prices in the $20s and up."
$18 or $19 close..... today..... AMAZON!!!!
Only 20% sales decline in Pandemic.. This is fantastic ! Holiday quarter will be much better.
"Lol, whole two days, holding on to my Macy 400 share’s , made 20 dollars . Bought at 7.50 , sold at 7.55"
$75/share target set for Macys post covid years!

Almost all the Gains This year are in Online-Sales. High In-Store Traffic didn't convert to more Sales. StUckers got emotionally high on PPS anticipating Results b4 #'s became available. lol
M is my largest holding. I keep buying but am now out of cash. What happened to an earnings surprise and short squeeze?
Let’s hope M stock will sky rocket soon to $12 and join me To sell my 4025 shares at a higher price
"CEO Gennette made $11.1 million in 2020 a 7,5% rise from the previous year. His salary went down by $300,000 but he made up for it with a $7.5 million stock option. He sells the his M shares every five months for years on average. Who is worth $11.1 million? As revenue shrinks so should his salary."
"Macys announces the first quarter dividend historically between Feb 22 and Feb 28 with the dividend EX date being March 14th.Dividend will then be announced by this Friday at latest.Macys has a fair market price of #75/share per all metrics PE, PS etc..."
LOOKING GOOD!!!! Lots of Target Upgrades... Macy's 10 Billion Online business is growing everyday and not talked about enough....They are big in the GAME 47% of their business.... and as the economy gets in gear people want to shop....
"Glenn, not sure about your term low volume, 33% of daily volume in an hour, indicative of a day that will easily surpass typical daily average, even double it assuming we stay at this pace."
"Yahoo didn't allow me to post my reaction on Macy's so trying a shorter version. If we all place a GTC limit order to sell, shorts will have less shares to borrow against"
Annual shareholders meeting today 11am EDT. Let's hope for something positive.
"Extreme investing inherent to Macy's. Regardless, the company is even stronger today than a year ago. Trading at a paltry 6 times earnings will entice another big vulture to appear. Maybe Amazon. Too much to like imo."
I’m glad to see Matthew went LONG
This would have made a run already if it was going to. No one excited about the opening of stores. Still have to wait and see how those stores do.
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/macys-m-stock-undervalued-now-131001720.html
Normal stock fluctuations. Macys is in a long term upward trend.Traders are going to be sorry. The really big money will be made by the long term investors.
https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/08/26/macys-stock-could-triple-over-the-next-few-years.aspxTRIPLE
we need volumes
M beat estimates the last 2 quarters when the stores were closed.The squeeze has just begun.
People are afraid that Macy’s will have a poor conference call and the stock has been down everyday for the last weekWe will know Thursday pre-market when Macy’s reports
"AMC up huge, and AAL up huge. Give me one good reason why M shouldn't be up huge as well. Like others have noted here already, there is huge pent-up demand for people to roam the malls again, especially regular go-to places like Macy's."
https://www.macysinc.com/investors/news-events/press-releases/detail/1622/macys-inc-provides-preliminary-first-quarter-2020
$3.11 and $3.21 per share in 2017? 8X earnings with 6% div yld.? Buy!
by +2% to -3%...negative today too...
Buy opportunity!!!
https://finance.yahoo.com/amphtml/news/options-market-predicting-spike-macys-141902665.html
This goes to 16 very soon but then flops again....
Looks like the GS downgrade could not move this lower than $36. Good sign!
"The whole market is bearish at the moment. Do you really think Macy will go to 10,11 or 13 now? I am optimistic about the future of this stock, but not on short term"
Imagine what would happen to M if a trade deal is announced... just saying 
"Short squeeze coming, still time to buy or cover."
hey phillip wheres the sell off i was promised yesterday
Macys upgrades will continue.As always it is a lagging indicator.
"The real fact is Macy's GAAP earnings for Q4 was a lose of over 600 million dollars or a lose of -$1.95 a shares which make Macy worth 600 million less today than it was on Dec 31 2020, That Fact is you would have saved 600 dollars if Macy closed the doors and did not operate at all in Q4"
Massive over reaction to great retail news Friday! This week we resume crushing the shorts
see you soon $ 20 folks
"GO Macy's... Most women love to shop, and love to try on clothes, not everything is going to be online shopping... but Macy's is trying to adjust. Kohls, and Macy's are my long retails..."
"I last posted 5 points ago, but now that the quarter is half over, the sales are amazing. That is a fact. Malls are dead ? You r lucky to get a parking spot after driving around for a half an hour. Expect some shocking results from Macy's, great inventory management., strong sales = a big surprise not only for this quarter but future quarters also. Macy's on line business also strong and with new management will become more efficient and deliver even faster growth. A little healthy pull back, but now will push toward 30."
Trying to right size the debt to lower revenues won’t stop the inevitable. Future grim
just the beginning
It lost over half the dividend in one day. Unbelievable.
"Positive adjusted EBITDA of $159 million achieved one quarter sooner than expected • Positive unadjusted EBITDA of $113 million• Finished the quarter without drawing from asset-backed credit facility• Strong liquidity position with approximately $1.6 billion in cash at the end of Q3• Omnichannel sales of approximately $4.0 billion, a decline of 20.2% on an owned-plus-licensed comparable basis•••• Gross •• SG&A •Some sales pulled forward into Q3 from Q4• Industry and Macy’s experienced earlier-than-normal holiday demand in October• Shift in start of Friends and Family event from November into OctoberStore sales declined approximately 36% versus LY Strong digital year-over-year growth of approximately 27%• Penetration rate of ~38%, up more than 14 percentage points over LY margin rate of 35.6%, down 440 basis points from LY but up significantly from the Q2Inventory down 29% year-over-year; entering fourth quarter in a clean inventory position expenses of $1.7 billion, an improvement of 21.6% from LYSG&A rate increased by 70 basis points year-over-year, to 43.3%"
People are finally able to go out!!!! Apparrel shopping is done in person.
Same exact move after earnings as KSS. Started red and finished deep green.
"Another positive move by Macy's ""Macy’s, Inc. Announces Debt Tender Offer"""
Also remember that PM and AH pricing is so easy to manipulate.
Even CNN is bashing Macy's or stating the obvious. Is management making the right decisions for its shareholders? Are the investors/part owners being taken advantage of?https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/21/business/target-stock-earnings-retail-walmart/index.html
Why???
"Interesting mall visit yesterday afternoon. Crowded. The average age? I’d have to say that it was less than 30. Young families and couples. No children older than 10 to 12. The average child age of less than 5. Why were these young people shopping at a mall instead of the internet? Because mall shopping has been on a comeback for awhile. People are getting tired of returning internet purchases. They want to see, feel, and try on merchandise. A new generation of mall shoppers have started. And yes they were shopping Macy’s too. It was far from dead. By the way, I stopped at a local goodwill later in the afternoon. I picked up a pair of west German vintage nutcrackers and a pair of vintage wrought iron window planter frames. Why buy Chinese junk when you can buy high quality vintage at a better price. Donation dumping was unbelievable. They were blocking one parking lot exit completely. They were making lots of room for their new Christmas toys."
"Doubled down at $31 today, glad that I did."
"Macy's is still putting on the fourth of July fireworks, must mean funding secured!"
Price has already factored in the bad sales and more. This feels like a small investor shake up. Retail in the news have been beaten to the ground. Tomorrow's numbers will bring the stock higher.
"Macy’s expects full-year revenue in the range of $21.73 billion to $22.23 billion, up from its previous projections of $19.75 billion to $20.75 billion."
"Today really showed why Macy's stock has underperformed so badly. It's not about earnings or anything the company has done. It's about a massive 2 way momentum trade where mainly hedge funds and some retail traders kept push buying stocks like TSLA,AAPL,HD,ZM etc and were pound shorting stocks like CCL,M, KSS etc..."
WHY IS THIS STOCK DOWN
Obviously no buyers here. 5-6%; could easily see $13.70s today. Market is not trusting 2020 guidance. It's currently trading 6x lowest forecast earnings.
were running to ten easy. load the boat with 1000 share blocks
Just saw a Macy's commercial on ESPN.
Bluemercury will add 5 billion of market cap to Macys. 55 new stores to open in 2019. Look at Ulta market cap of18 billion. I visited 6 stores in the bay area CA and the managers claimed sales are great with year over year growth.Macys management need to talk up this story and break out some growth numbers on this gem.
"At 6 plus percent dividend, close to 52 week lows and expectations low I’m moving my cash from money market into Macy’s stock and I will get paid while I wait."
"Macy‘s with preliminary Q1-sales on Thursday, 21st May 2020 Follower by Macy‘s CEO in a fireside chat with JPMorgan analyst. Big news just around the corner. Week by week more stores and malls reopen with all 775 nationwide to reopen by mid June the latest. Can‘t wait to go shopping and going out. Back to normal, back to double-digits........... whatever it takes.........."
i believe in Macy's
"For all those comparing this to JCPenney just because they're both in retail, please go look at JCPenney financials, they've now gone 6 yrs with negative eps, Macy's and jcpenny, kmart, and Sears are not the same lmao"
Kohls and Nordstroms trade at 15 times earnings...Macy's at only 9
