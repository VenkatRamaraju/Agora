"Does GDDY host it's own webservers or do they use someone like AWS ? If they host their own hardware etc., what sort of history does GDDY have regarding unilateral take down of websites ? Just interested in light of the Parler take down by AWS."
"Go Daddy Operating Company, LLC -- Moody's assigns Ba1 to GoDaddy's incremental term loan; affirms Ba2 CFR; outlook stable"
"No doubt they are growing, and had a much better quarter then the last one, but does predicted free cash flow growth of 18-20% a year warrant the mind boggling P/E ratio of 160.9 ($0.45 eps reported for full year 2018)? It’s basically priced in that the company will need to keep growing cash flow by 20% a year for the next 15 years. That’s a risky assumption. This stock would be expensive if it was worth half as much."
"EARNINGS REPORTGoDaddy reports $0.41 earnings per share, analysts' consensus estimate was $0.36Good day lets go!!!"
"in for the win, 1500 shares at 70.15"
"Thing is, GDDY is a great company. Great products. Great service. Great RECURRING REVENUE. New products being implemented. Price should be higher, but who knows. I’m adding more here. Long term should be a big winner."
Missed today. Clearly overvalued and carry a lot of debt relative to cash.

"Recently, Rosenblatt Securities analyst Mark Zgutowicz reiterated a Buy rating on the stock and increased the price target to $120 (44.6% upside potential) from $100."

"GoDaddy surpasses 20 million customers, sees record customer growth12% constant currency bookings growth in Q2Announces settlement of TRA"
"RBC Capital’s Mark Mahaney is singing the praises of web hosting company GoDaddy. He reiterated his buy rating on August 5, while boosting his $93 stock price forecast to $98. With shares up 10% year-to-date, the new price target indicates 25% upside potential lies ahead."
I hope Go Daddy goes broke for removing pro-life website because they don't like the new Texas law.
i kept buying over $70. volumes drying up
"how is ther Over %101 of shares owned by institutions? Look under statistics, I have no idea how that is possible. Can someone please explain this to me? Every time I ask this question people just give it a thumbs down and noone answers my question. Is this because no-one really knows how institutions could own over %101 percent of a stock? Please can someone explain?"
Great entry point
