Is this a long term stock to hold?
Got more at $60.88 today!
Whats the % of their BBB holdings and below? Difficult to make money on new sales with zero rates.
"What makes insurance companies such great investments is that in boom or recession, people still make premium payments. Warren Buffet is credited with the premise on why they make great use of cash."
is MET reporting today or tomorrow???
Had to buy some today. Hard to find a better bargain. Bought PRU and BUD and RDS.A to.
"With a 5% dividend, share buybacks, and a low p/e, these shares look very enticing. Might add some more here."
Will buy at $61.00 tomorrow
I've bought three stocks in the past 8-months - one being MET. That's the only one that's been profitable lol. Now they beat their earnings and plan to buy back stock. Glad that I resisted the temptation to sell at $50
two billion dollar Share Buy-Back just announced.
I've owned this stock for years along with manulife through computershare. Great dividend and stability.
"Earnings beat by 52 cents, lovely!"
Company down as a result of the entire market being thrashed and all other insurance companies as well.In 2008 company traded as low as 11 bucks and took no tarp money.Company is just as solid any of the insurers.Fed will bail these companies out as well if necessary.
"Nothing against MET, in fact I would like to buy some BUT....when I look at a 5-year chart I get discouraged from pulling the trigger. Consider the following June 1, 2015 MET share price was almost $50. February 2017, we hit a high of $54. This stock has traded between $41 and $54 for a 5 year period. Why (or HOW) does it get to $60????"
"MetLife to buy Versant:https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200917005404/en/MetLife-to-Acquire-Versant-Health-Owner-of-Davis-Vision-and-Superior-Vision#:~:text=NEW%20YORK%2D%2D(BUSINESS%20WIRE,in%20an%20all%2Dcash%20transaction."
met will buy back another 3 billion dollars worth of shares. What's not to like?
"Morgan Stanley comments:""“We view the announcement today of MetLife’s planned acquisition of Versant health positively. Not only is the transaction consistent with its strategy of growing low capital intensive non-medical health operations, but it also demonstrates management confidence in their current capital position, with the company also announcing plans to complete their existing buyback plan this year, implying roughly $0.5 billion of buybacks by year-end,” said Nigel Dally, equity analyst at Morgan Stanley""."
One of Dodge and Cox funds largest holdings.
interesting.... what does PE actually mean.. as in MET-PE? Seems like a good price and yield?
I bought today in good price below 34
"Old reliable right here. I've owned this since inception. If you go by PE and fundamentals, this is a 70 dollar stock."
Met share buy back will be very effective
ANAT is also way below book value will follow MET as the positive benefit of rate increase is showing in the insurance sector now.
Why is MET sitting on so much CASH ? Could be for a large acquisition. Any clues ?
5 Day cup has formed. Handle at $52.53 To breakout higher we need a close above $52.60 to get to $53 and higher
Bought at $60.75 and $60.58 last week
loving MET all day long. Positioned established between 26 and 36 during covid hit.
is there a number to call to sell shares I inherited?
Earnings look good hope market doesn't dive?
In at $61.35
"I’m sitting in At 296 shares, I know it’s not allot but it’s enough for me to say that the dividends are GRAVY GOOD! I regret not buying more during the COVID drop. I’m still at green I can sell and make a profit but I plan to keep forever! I have MetLife insurance, they covered 80% of $8500 for medical work for for me and dental work for my 3 kids. I’m happy with them. I’m slowly buying more shares while it’s still cheap."
"Met sold it's home and auto Ins. business in 1st quarter 2021 for 3.94 billion to Farmers Ins. Hurricane Ida should not have made it go down today, I suppose some just assume Ins. in the name and they are scared off without knowing."
"Now people realized the pension news was only 1 million dollar settlement. Yet the stock price was dropped disporportionally due to that news not knowing what it involved. LOL, it should go back up over 50 with positive rate hike."
"Stable dividend and outlook as indicated by CEO, too cheap not to add some more,"
Good session today
"METLife is one of the strongest insurance co. in the State. Steay Eddy, It should catch up with the broader banking sector as bond rate has risen again surpassing 3 %. I expect Met to rise after earning surprises and can pass 50 easily short term. ."
"Support @58, resistance @60 thinking next special dividend gift or out right dividend increase should send stock price dramatically higher"
this stock will lose value come earnings day next week
"It is ""shameful"" that you can't even trust CNBC to FAIRLY represent the movement in a stock. They ""accurately"" reported that in the after hours trading today 1/8/2019, that MET stock fell 7% before recovering and appeared to make this look like it was related to the change in CEO. What they failed to mention is that there were over 127,000 shares traded in the after hours and 18 shares were traded at that 7% lower price.......EIGHTEEN!! It had nothing to do with the CEO which by the way is a positive. This was ""sensationalism reporting"". I hope none of you lost money after hours with stop orders. FYI...I don't use stop orders."
Increase dividend is positive
"Actually if you look at the 6 month chart a Cup and Handle formed at $51. On top of that you have Jon Najarian promoting the options for March 55 because of huge volume today. 49,125 new options today and some were ours. Previously there were 2243 in play. That is a HUGE increase and someone is betting 3,33 million USD that this is going to move at least $2.75 by March 20 expiration date."
"After fundamental analysis, business / industry research, and a conservative DCF estimation I was fully prepared to jump in but... Hubbard, R. Glenn is in the board of Directos. Was this guy not involved in de-regulation of derivatives going into 2008? Any opinions?"
"I imagine that the Covid pandemic worldwide, especially in countries where there is not much of a social safety net, will force many heads of household to reconsider the financial fate of their families should they succumb, and consequently to purchase more traditional life insurance."
MET was $53 pre-Covid. Once everyone realizes that people are not dying more significantly than prior years- then it will go up- a 30% gain from where we are now. Meanwhile collect the dividend from this incredibly solid company.
Large hit is resultant from crono-virus and the fact that interest rates are going to zero. Large liabilities upon deaths of customers; with interest off t-bill earning nothing means there are few places to invest that will make money for insurance companies
this is a 50 dollar stock !
"Normally I would like insurance companies for the ""stability"" and high dividend yield. But I am learning that these companies tend to be value traps. YES you will get your dividend but share price appreciation is ""AWFUL"". On June 1 2014 price per share was $49.52, today (3/23/2019) its $41.79 with the S&P 500 only 5% off its all time high. Time to face the facts Insurers are not good longer term investments, (maybe a good trade). By the way......same story with Prudential and Principal Financial, it's NOT just MET."
Bought today waiting for 50
"From Conference Call held yesterday:""As always, we carefully weigh every use of capital against the alternatives. Our goal is to achieve the right balance between investing in growth and returning capital to create long-term shareholder value. With Versant, our confidence could not be higher that we are making the right investment at the right time in the right business.As noted in our press release, we are also pleased to announce that we are resuming share repurchases. By the end of the year, we expect to complete the remaining $485 million on our current buyback authorization. Last but not least, we are financing this transaction 100% with cash on our balance sheet.As we noted on our Q2 earnings call, we ended the quarter with cash and liquid assets at holding companies of $6.6 billion. Even after the transaction and the completion of our buyback authorization, we still expect to continue to be above our target range. We are moving forward and targeting to close on the Versant acquisition by year-end""."
Consensus estimate is $1.30/share. Anyone care to guess? I'm going with $1.35.
Gonna buy under $60 today
Morgan Stanley put 73 PT on Met July 15th. We will see earnings soon and get a positive direction move up.
"Great company. Why is it so cheap? Low P/E superb ev. Pays dividend. Purely statistics based business.Cons, yes if suddenly insurance cost go up big time they might lag a bit in increasing there premiums."
watch tomorrow. Major boost in stock price. Great dividend stock. It's definitely a long term investment.
"Bought 2 weeks ago at $33.15 and doing great.Should be a $50 stock easy. Biden or Trump will not hurt them unlike Sanders would have, extremely undervalued."
NIce earnings. Expect a bigger pop tomorrow to maybe $53 or $54
"Is the Dividend safe with declining revenue, profit, and investment losses?"
Forward P/E 7.84 is amazingly cheap. I am collecting the juicy dividend while I wait for MET in continuing paying me dividend and buy back shares. It should worth a lot more and can easily double
"Life insurance companies getting hit hard. Not sure why. Fear of extra death benefits to be paid? Interest rate moves cut both ways. Existing bonds worth more, newly purchased ones will yield less, but premiums can be adjusted."
