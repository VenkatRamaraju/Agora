AMAZING NEWS WILL POP TO 2.5 AT LEAST!!!
I was late I got it @ $1.84
Harvard having Graduation this week with a principal World Health Organization (WHO) member providing keynote speech.TYME-19 is aligned to this.Where's the World Health Organization at in COVID Cure?Interesting article citing efficacy of cloroquin and other earlier trials.International COVID-19 Trial to Restart with Focus on Immune Responseshttps://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01090-zPeace to All
Exciting Company here. With current patents and R and D this puppy is about a year or so away from real success but its the early birds that make the biggest gains. This should be trading in the $3.00 to $4.00 range by year end. Good luck all
"The posters are up on the company website. I encourage any interested party to read all four. I came away more impressed with the performance of the compound. Will post some more detailed reaction later, but for now I will just say I am disgusted with the conduct of Matthew Herper and Adam Feuerstein. It is because of people like those two that companies do not want to accept third line PANC patients into clinical trials. These are patients who DO NOT RESPOND - period. Literally, their response rates in clinical trials is ZERO. Yet the tyme trial enrolled third, fourth and fifth line patients - these were 85% of the patients on drug. Yet rather than focus on the hopelessness of the patient profile, the strong evidence of clinical benefit, and the compelling (albeit not definitive due to no control arm) evidence of survival benefit, these two focus instead on the fact that ORR was modest. Well no kidding it’s modest - look at the patients! Not to mention that ALL patients were measured at 2 months - before they time that this drug has started to show responses in other trials. These guys are more keen to pick apart a title of a press release then they are to do a responsible analysis of whether a new compound is showing serious signs of promise in an impossible patient population. End of rant. I am doubling down on tyme."
This is going to take 8 months before we see 4-5 dollars barring some fda approval. I’m waiting but damn I would love the triple up. Big potential just need to hold. Willing to hold for 2 years to make 10x good fundamentals good path higher financing
Getting tougher to remain optimistic on this one; down 60% over the last 6 months..down to $1 today.
Just cannot seem to hold on to it’s climb to success. Profit takers prevent the stock from going higher. Hopefully one of these days the positive news will be to good to sell and maybe we make it to $2.50 and higher.
One piece of advice for the Longs of TYME -- bring your kneepads and grease for Tues. activity!
hold!!this will be 5$
"Some serious questions. 1] Is it correct that Hoffman personally owns all pertinent patents and not TYME ? 2] Demurjian left the company [ unexplained, why? ] and owned 26 million shares while TYME had 111.95 shares outstanding? 3] Demurjians lock up period expired when TYME presented it's 2018 annual report? 4] Is/Will Demurjian unwinding , liquidate, his position?Disclaimer , I had been building a position because I Like the scientific side of TYME. Presently until the above FINANCIAL issues are addressed , ie who will step in and absorb 25% of outstanding should he [ continue? ] liquidate, I have to question TYME's short term prospects and viability on the finance, pps side. Will any good news be met with heavy selling? Will Hoffman support ? IMO TYME presently has a serious financial overhang that needs attention. A good update might bring in a big whale, institution or pharma company to help alleviate this problem but will the patent situation be a problem?. Any opinions, insights or thoughts welcomed."

"TYME currently is valued at $125 million, has aprox $25 million in cash , is burning $5-6 million a quarter aprox, no revenue generating products , has a pipeline of products very promising but none of which have completed an FDA phase 2 trial let alone set up a phase 3 yet. IMO TYME needs to get thru a phase 2 trial with strong positive results before a Big Pharma will make an offer. The offer will be anywhere from $ money to help finance thru the trials for a % of company to a direct take out or anywhere in between, anybody's guess. If TYME tries to raise money before a completed trial, or some other strong positive event it will be disastrous for stockholders. Anybody care to venture a timeline on when TYME might set up a FDA phase 3 trial or a possible FDA fast track trial ? IMO until TYME announces something strong , positive and concrete the speculators will have a field day with the valuation and the resulting PPS. TYME is at the point where they will need top financial people at the helm to weather the storm. Science , data , promising ideas , and the like are one thing but this is the stock market not the pharmacy aisle. Downside $1.11 upside $5-10 within a year. Any opinions ? Place your bets...………."
I give trying to explain to you people. I am still going to invest in them and know they will possibly cure some cancers.

it's still so early 
Patent on tech revolutionary to treating cancer? Here’s all my money!
"So just to chime in, in support of Mike and DRE, I am long (a lot) and I actually think both positions have merit.The long term of the stock seems good based on the clinical data we have (which Mike has mentioned repeatedly before this latest frenzy, and DRE has now reiterated), and it is a good thing that TYME has used the latest patent grants to raise capital. History has shown that this stock pops up on good news, and then deteriorates over time, while we wait for those clinical trials to complete. So, could it go to $1? Maybe, it has before. Is the long term potential as high as $50? Maybe, depends on the trial results.My one wish would have been that they announced the stock placement and the patent results simultaneously, so we would have seen $2.50, without this manic runup to $3.90 and the associated conjecture about where the stock is going in the next week.If you read my prior posts, you will see this is a ""story stock"" and a longer-term play.The best news is now they have the capital to complete the trials and get the COVID trial done, and hopefully all the dilution is now behind us.Warren Buffet says in the short term the market is a voting machine, but in the long term it is a weighing machine.You can vote all you want today, tomorrow or next week. We will see what this thing weighs in the longer term.For what it is worth."

"Based on what I read so far, it looks like Tyme is an innovator in the field of cancer treatment. I bought tens of thousands of shares this year because I believed they will come up with something outstanding like this. We all know though that innovators tend to struggle in the short-run because they will be ""drawing the map while walking in the forest"", but the payoff will be huge in the long-run."
"On average, Wall Street analysts predict that Tyme Technologies's share price could stay at $9.50 by Nov 13, 2021. The average Tyme Technologies stock price prediction forecasts a potential downside of N/A from the current TYME share price of $1.22."

"TYME presently has $180mm Market Cap priced at $1.05 per share.It also has $101mm in Cash & Investments So.... TYME's Intellectual Technology, a first-in-class CMBT compound which to date, clinical trial data has shown that SM-88 has achieved confirmed tumor responses across 15 different cancers, both solid and liquid tumors, including pancreatic, lung, breast, prostate, sarcoma and lymphoma cancers with minimal drug-related serious Grade 3 or higher adverse events... SO it's potential is presently valued at less the $70mm ?and That valuation doesn't even take into consideration TM-18, TM-19 nor the value of the pending clinical trials that are presently underway.... northe working relationships with Eagle Pharma, The Mayo Clinic, NYU Langone Health, The Pancreatic Cancer Action Network, The Joseph Ahmed Foundation, Georgetown University etc........Take a look at the people sitting on TYME's Scientific Advisory Committee ! even mebers of the Board of Directors Beyond impressive.This stock is so undervalued.

"I don't think it SM-88 kills, so much as prevents growth and metastatic progression while weakening its defenses. I think is would be great to see this as an complement to 1L and 2L treatments. Allowing effective treatment with lower doses of existing drugs. Does anybody have an idea of how quickly a cancer cell incorporates tyrosine ( or other components), that is to say does a cancer cell normally take a day, week, or month to start using tyrosine. I would presume the cell would reach a tipping point and stop being able to grow and metastisize, follow by degradation and death."

The greatest advantage to owning tyme or itrm Is that you get to sell it and use the loss against your gains made in good company’s￼￼
there's a ton of support at this 1.70 level. it's not done from here (today or long term). tho prly not reaching $2 again today.
I can’t wait for the squeeze
Nice little bump on solid volume.... Market Cap should be somewhere closer to $350mm - $400mm. Come on Richie share some good news !!! Any interesting collaborations in the works ????

Bullish here going forward...take a look also ATNM
"Been playing TYME for almost 2 years. Love the science. It could prove to be the Holy Grail of cancer therapy and since this metabolic approach applies to ALL solid tumor types (and maybe hematological as well, ultimately) if it proves efficacious this could be the biggest story in the history of cancer meds. Having said that, a dose of reality here; a US patent adds nothing to the likelihood of an FDA decision. USPTO only looks at the novel MOA and says it's ""different"". The science still has has to work to get FDA approval. With no FDA IND until mid to late 2022 this is dead money until early 2023. I'm selling here and will be buying back lower because or will be $1.20 or lower at some point in the next few months. The patent is only great once the science gets approved and others want to license it. Good luck all!"

I need $3.60 to break even
"Listened to doc call today sponsored by Evercore ISI. Docs from Dana Farber and Weill Cornell. Both docs are very impressed and intrigued by SM88. Basically, nothing works well in panc. Chemo benefit is very transitory and highly toxic. By the time patients get to 3L or even 2L they are very sick and and many can’t handle the toxic chemos out there. And there is basically nothing that works in 3L.Both Docs called the survival data very impressive and intriguing for these mostly 3L+ patients. And the fact that it is an oral pill (ease of use advantage) and non toxic with intriguing OS make it a truly unique compound like nothing else out there. (The safety cannot be understated. It is a huge differentiator). The MOA is totally unique.The Dana Farber doc is heavily involved in PanCan and is on the steering committee that selected SM88 as the first compound in the precision promise trial. The doc confirmed the obvious - the Fact that PanCan selected sm88 was due to enthusiasm/excitement among docs on the selection committee. Committee felt sm88 was “ready” for the trial. The selection process was “rigorous”. Doc confirm that precision promise is a registrational trial. I.e., compelling data and sm88 gets approved. PanCan picks up bunch of the costs of trial - another indicator of the high bar that sm88 passed.In terms of TYMEs own effort in 3L, docs obviously don’t know what the fda will decide in terms or whether it requires a control group in the next leg. But they did emphasize that there could be room for the FDA to compromise given that there are no standards of care for 3L and whatever one gives to these very sick patients is likely too toxic.The docs also confirmed that the CTC data is quite interesting."

"Okay so if Mike wants to go I can go too. First off I'll address their latest press release about their ongoing trials: So I think it’s a good play especially because it isn’t a vaccine based off of the structure of covid for the Tyme 19 study, which is different than the ones that are showing low effectiveness recently. As for the ss 88 study, I took a look at their data and they have little to no minor adverse effects and no major adverse effects so that’s really a key point in their progress and good indicator. Also the novelty of the study is impressive bc it’s a modernized approach of fetching health data from wearable devices to validate the their study which has generated more data points and gives you more assurance toward a successful filing with FDA. Second off: They have 100 million more in cash now and which if we go off their burn rate this year gives us 4 years of debt free . Additionally they have a Former JNJ exec on their board and former National Director of Gynecologic Oncology for Cancer Treatment Centers of America on their management team. All I focus on is biotechs and I have done extensive DD on TYME and all indicators are positive for me. I think once the offering closes Monday we will see a lot of green days. My short term target (a month from now) is $8 dollars. Good luck to all and ignore spammers like Mike. Beat them with good research."
$NRXP is running on good news
Do technical analysis 
At least it is consistant. Looks like we have a $1 stock until there is some positive results and/or news.
"This should biopharma has just left a conference picking up 3 more analysts. Their reports should push this up fast, and without warning. too much cash on hand vs free cash flow. one day this will jump 100%-300% almost over night, or over a weekend. The institutional investment here knows when they try to kick up the SP that retail investors short, or take profit. If the investors that are on this thread would stop selling, and shorting on small spikes every TYME, we would see continued growth."
Up 2.5 pennies.... Oh boy... Old Vulture Cap Boy must be at it again ! Hahaha.........
8.50 price target end of year this is just the beginning
Tyme Technologies .. now have 2 analysts covering the stock with the consensus suggesting a rating of ‘Strong_Buy’.

"Until we get some really good news TYME is going no where and as I have said before. will hang between .85 and 1.20 so just stay calm and do not get so excited over these small premature pops as we have a good while( probably 2022) before we even scare the $2 and $4 marks people are talking about.

"Tumor metastasis (spreading from one site to another in the body) is responsible for an estimated 90% plus of cancer deaths. CTCs carry the tumor throughout the blood stream and play an important role in metastasis . The fact that TYME has shown profound ability to reduce CTCs is incredible. And it obviously shows that SM88 is working!!!!! Not only for prostate and panc cancers, but potentially it can work for all cancers. One day the market will wake up and realize that TYME May be onto something truly revolutionary. A highly effective cancer fighting agent that is non toxic is truly uniqueTyme will be releasing preclinical data later in the year. They have already alluded to stunning early results. This data could/should serve as an important catalyst for the stock as it serves as further proof that TYME is onto something really HUGE.All patients in the PANC 88 trial had rapidly progressing disease. The fact that 44% of the patients scanned were SD on SM88 further shows that the drug is working. And the fact that almost all of those patients were still alive is further validation of efficacy. TYME very well could be sitting on a gold mine. At some point the market will wake up to this fact."
This stock double then dropped 50% so we are back to $1.

"I have no idea when this builds to $2.00 + but i know for sure it should be trading above $2.00 now. Interest will increase the more investors learn about TYME. I also know I am long and strong here, keep buying at these prices TYME can be the small guys big win cause it is affordable and under priced right now but that will change soon and you will regret now owning this stock."

"Was wondering if anyone had any thoughts about TYME 18 ?• TYME-18: Pre-Clinical TrialIn addition to SM-88, we have been conducting pre-clinical studies in TYME-18. This is a novel intra-tumoral delivered therapy designed to increase the permeability of cancer cells while delivering an agent that will have a selective cytotoxic effect on the tumor. TYME-18 is distinct in composition, but like SM-88, it is designed to decrease the viability of cancer cells in a toxic tumor microenvironment, while minimizing the impact to normal tissues.In initial preclinical xenograft mouse studies, TYME-18 was able to completely resolve over 90% of established colorectal cancer tumors in test animals within 12 days, observing that 11 of 12 test animals were tumor free on day 12 of treatment. This is compared to an average of over 600% growth in the control treated animals during the same time period. The Company plans to continue with the development of TYME-18 and plans to provide details of an IND-enabling program over the coming months."

"The data themselves are compelling. Of the 28 evaluable patients, 24 were third line and beyond, where historical response rates are in the 0-1% range. In other words, obtaining a response in this patient population was all but impossible. And the OS benefit looks compelling, all the more so with the side effect advantages. I have heard Dr. Picozzi comment on other studies and drugs before with much more measured comments than he used to describe his reaction to this one - he is not a rah-rah type when it comes to early stage data and he was clearly genuinely excited here - and genuinely looking forward to seeing what the drug can do in Pancan Phase 3 starting in a few months. Having said all that, the company did overstretch with the title of the press release, and the data presentation was sloppy and internally inconsistent. But this should not be confused with the data themselves being lackluster, as Feurstein and some other folks seem to be doing (without much actual analysis of the patient population nor the actual survival data - Feurstein seems to prefer just establishing that he is clever enough to detect (or retweet) an internal inconsistency)."
Closing above $3 call interest spiking
TYME shooting up on high volume in the last few minutes. Hope something good is in the wings!
Headed under $1.00 again!!
Tyme fell through the first support level
"The last run didn't even create a new support level. Right back to where we were. I got in a 1.17 last run and out a 1.60. I am putting my spare change into Tyme when it drops below $1.00. She likes to run on news, but can't hold its value."
"Sold $1.14, time to load up here soon. Thanks for the $$$. Round trip # 3 or go long?"
"I listened to the webcast. I picked up the following: º Company now fully financed for at least three years.º Company making more bottom-line ROI decisions influencing this: - Shift away from third-stage PanCan study and settle for second-stage because that's where the market is and ROI. - SM-19 still viable as a therapy for COVID but in a very competitive market with tons of competition. - OASIS study to focus on breast cancer. Again, where the market is and ROI.º Much more experienced staff now with history of transitioning drugs to market.º No discouraging clinical results, just discouraging pandemic-driven slow progress.And on the down side . . . º Richie and others still unable to speak in simple English terms that investors can understand. Evidently still have to sound like scientists that nobody understands,"

Not worried here at all. As usual NO NEGATIVE NEWS. Very light volume. May pick up some more at this price point. Current avg share price in the mid $1.20 range. Think I will. Not a doubt in my mind this will bounce back again. Just need that little kicker of GOOD NEWS from Richie Cunningham to bounce this into the $2.00 range and get this off the garage floor ! :-) Come on Richie whatcha say.... give us little guys a little love !

"Ellen Degernous just bought 4million shares, this thing. is easily going to 2000/share"
"I see no reason Tyme can’t enjoy the benefits of rising markets like many other companies. I may be missing something, but to this point I see no new data that makes me think is cause for this jump. However, one could argue there was no data precipitating the decline to sub 1. The last funding & the free share conversion represent most recent px benchmarks to me. Perhaps the move comes as CEO Mr Hoffman has got close to the max 2 million share sale where he has already sold over 1.5m shares."
I know this is a long way off but I will keep a small position in support of their efforts...I hope they make some progress and are able to help people beat various types of tumors with less invasive treatment!

"Let us have your prediction on what is likely to be the high print for TYME in the Sept. and Oct. (roughly two-month) interval. I will stick my neck out and predict a high of $1.29 (with a probability of 0.8), but will also note that $1.63 is likely (with a probability of 0.4). I have invested a substantial sum with these figures in mind."
TOMMY: You could certainly be right but at any moment news could strike and this stock price will POP. Do not think Richie C. is just sitting on his hands waiting for clinical trial data to arrive !
I am not a big fan of Andy Marsh sell every two weeks. Is he that broke? Take some pride in your own stock and let it grow.
If anyone understands the mechanism of sm-88 what this patent allows is the attachment of a chemotherapy that will only be released inside of cancer cells. It will reduce the toxicity to non cancerous cells.
Our pumpernickel DavidNIO has been gone for almost 2 years now mates. He move to #tyme and changed his name and picture to a girl FightingIrishTYME. She’ll make us monies daily. I wonder what her prediction is for TYME IN 7 DAYS? where’s my pumpernickel DavidNIO at

"Read the stories about SAVA. There are apples to apples comparison of a stock, a biotech stock, began at a couple of bucks share price a year ago surged suddenly to around $9. Many sold had a nice profit and now today rue that decision. SAVA it's on the verge of making medical history with its product to combat alheimérz. So. it's currently a $135 stocks many think will run to $900 a share when it's done. Let that be a lesson for those of us here at TYME. I've never heard the SM-88 approach doesn't work against a variety of cancers. Proving it takes time. But when it happens the share price will explode. You won't be able to react fast enough if you're not already in it and that is the risk."
"Honestly I'm still bullish about the stock. This stock had good news regarding TYME-19, a good projected forecast, and it has the potential chance to be a merger. With stocks like these, I'll run it into the ground before I sell. I'm not confident enough to be buying at dips, but I'm overall still confident with TYME'S projected earnings. I guess we'll see though "

"Been saying this all day. These Small Cap Pharma companies do not shoot the moon because of a patent. Contrary to belief Patents are not hard to get. The trials are what will move this stock. You will end up holding if you don't get out when you can. Look at what IGC did last week. They got a patent approved, it pumped, and has been dumping since... Leaving Bag Holders in its wake. Be wary of these people who are saying things like ""rockets and shooting the moon"" and offer no evidence to back it up. The moving averages have this stock at $1.55 - $1.63."

Insiders set to sell again on Friday.
TYME stock action suddenly came back into action in late Friday trading. The stock has been sliding steadily for a long time; so Friday's price action is most unusual. Maybe it foretells a major move in the coming week or two.
"Look, they had a 40 million share direct placement at $2.50 a share. They raised $100 million that fully funds them through phase 3 trials. When this stock surges, past experience is that it explodes. Insider sales are a drop in the bucket. I think they are more a function of available income to insiders who know it will likely be a couple years before promising clinical trial data can lead to FDA approval and the company is able to turn a profit. Personally I consider the 2.50 per share to be a baseline below which I will likely never sell my shares. That means anyone buying here will likely see 100 percent return as a minimum. IMO, only a complete reversal of years of positive data in future late stage clinical studies could change this. I'll risk that unlikelihood and stay long TYME. The major flaw with the company is their extreme focus internally -- where insiders dominate -- and their tendency to share good news with each other but not with the public or their retail shareholders. Good communicators they are not."
today going up like rocket 
"I am invested in TYME: long term as this is 5 years from showing any business growth. At this stretch of low price I wonder if they need a reverse split, especially to stay on NASDAQ."

"Yesterday I posted this ""Doing research on $tyme over the weekend I found something VERY INTERESTING.TYME's new CEO ""Mr. Cunningham also brings significant experience in mergers & acquisitions, business development, strategy development, therapeutic launches, contracting, managed care, and sales & marketing. Most recently, Richie served as CEO at Icagen, leading the company through two transformational acquisitions, acquiring assets and talent out of Pfizer and Sanofi. While CEO at Icagen, he successfully negotiated and signed multiple licensing deals with Roche, Sanofi and the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation""What I want you to pay attention to is the very first part, Mergers and acquisitions, their cash burn rate is so low so why do an 100 million dollar offer? Could we be looking at a possible merger or acquisition? Is that why the offer was for so much money? Their cash burn rate last year was about 20 million for the year so not why do a 20 million offer or 25 something like that? We have seen mergers with other small biotechs like OBLN and JAGX that worked out very well. Could we be looking at something huge here?? Just throwing some ideas out there, anyone else have opinions on this?""And then today in the closed offering article it says""TYME may also use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire or invest in businesses, products and technologies that are complementary to its own, although it has no current plans, commitments or agreements with respect to any acquisitions as of the date of this communication.""VERY INTERESTING, COINCIDENCE?????"

"INFO ONLY. Questions submitted too late for Earnings call and considered a distraction if covered in Annual Meeting/ Proxie Vote Earnings Call.ANSWER FROM INVESTOR RELATIONS IN ALL CAPITAL LETTERS*****************************************For next Tuesday's Investors Meeting and Proxy Vote, I'm asking for clarification on several topics.Has our collaboration with LineaRX/APDN for molecular detection of invasive Circulating Tumor Cells (iCTCs) been replaced by our bio-marker collaboration with Evotec?CTCS WERE BEING EXAMINED IN PROSTATE CANCER MAINLY. HOWEVER, AS PART OF OUR STRATEGIC REVIEW, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT WE WERE NOT CURRENTLY GOING TO FOCUS ON PROSTATE, AND THAT WE NEEDED TO FOCUS ON BROADER MORE TRADITIONAL BIOMARKERS THAN JUST CTCS. WHILE THIS DOESN’T MEAN WE MIGHT NOT USE THEM IN THE FUTURE, CURRENTLY WE ARE FOCUED ON THE EFFORTS AT EVOTEC MAYO AND OTHER PLACE, AS WELL AS USING CIRCULATING TUMOR DNA IN OUR BREAST CANCER TRIAL THAT ALL THE KOLS SAID WAS A MORE VALIDATED BIOMARKER THERE.As of Evotec's own investors' meeting there is no mention of us within their meeting's video stream, or on pharma-partnerships.EVOTEC IS A SERVICE CORPORATION AND WORK WITH HUNDREDS OF COMPANIES, INCLUDE THE LARGEST PHARMA COMPANIES AND SMALL BIOTECHS LIKE OURSELVES. I DOUBT THEY WOULD LIST ALL OF THEIR CUSTOMERS. EVOTEC DOES HAVE AN INVESTMENT ARM WHERE THEY CAN INVEST IN COMPANIES OR SUPPORT RESEARCH. (A VERY SMALL PORTION OF THEIR ACTIVITIES.) I BELIEVE THAT IS THE LINK THAT YOU FORWARDED. THIS IS NOT THE TYPE OF RELATIONSHIP WE HAVE WITH EVOTEC CURRENTLY. NCT03512756 - TYME's self-sponsored clinical trial with some collaboration with LINeaRX and Eagle Pharma, from milestones graphic below updates are due now-> end of September (1H22). To summarize, data listed on the Clinical Trial site was Last Update Posted : June 21, 2021. In our collaboration with Eagle RX:Jan 7, 2020 Tyme Technologies and Eagle Pharmaceuticals Announce Strategic Collaboration///////OUR MILESTONE PAYMENT CAVEATS\\\\\\\\\\\\\In addition, TYME will receive a $20 million MILESTONE payment upon the successful completion of the first to occur of the following three events:(1) Achievement of the primary endpoint of overall survival in its TYME-88-Panc pivotal trial;.....or(2) Achievement of the primary endpoint of overall survival in the PanCAN Precision Promise? SM-88 registration arm;.....or(3) U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of SM-88 in any cancer.This payment would be split into a $10 million milestone cash payment and a $10 million investment in TYME at a 15% premium to the then prevailing market price. Eagle’s shares will be restricted from sale until the earlier of three months following the milestone event or the three-year anniversary of the agreement.THIS SEEMS CORRECT. SINCE THE 3RD LINE TRIAL OF PANCREATIC IS BEING SHUT DOWN, (NCT03512756) THE REMAINING EVENTS WOULD BE THE ONES TO FOCUS ON. FOR PANCAN YOU SHOULD NOTE THE EVENT IS THE PRIMARY ENDPOINT AT THE END OF THE TRIAL. THIS WOULD BE BASED ON SURVIVAL RESULTS FROM ~175 PATIENTS TREATED WITH SM-88. PRIOR TO THAT “FINAL” DATA, THERE IS A “GRADUATION” FROM THE PHASE 2 PORTION OF THE TRIAL ~100 PATIENTS, TO THE CONFIRMATORY PHASE 3 PORTION ~75 ADDITIONAL PATIENTS. WHILE WE BELIEVE IT WOULD BE ENCOURAGING THAT SM-88 GRADUATES TO THIS “CONFIRMATORY” PORTION (MAINLY BECAUSE THERE WOULD APPEAR A BENEFIT THAT NEEDS CONFIRMING), THIS GRADUATION WOULD NOT TRIGGER THE MILESTONE. AS PRECISION PROMISE COME OUT OF THE PANDEMIC, OPENS UP ITS ADDITIONAL SITES, WE MIGHT HAVE A BETTER IDEA OF WHEN THESE EVENTS COULD OCCUR, BUT TO BE CLEAR- WE ARE BLIND TO THE EXACT ENROLLMENT OF OUR ARM AND THESE ARE BASED ON OUR ESTIMATES OF SOME OVERALL ENROLLMENT AND OTHER ITEMS THAT WE USE TO TRIANGLATE THE POTENTIAL STATUS OF OUR ARM. Hoping the trial status and working collaborations be fully discussed. If our therapeutics (i.e. SM-88, SM-18, et al) are now being manufactured by EVOTEC, please expound. Updates on our working agreements with EAGLE and LinEARX also requested. WE CAN’T REALLY SAY MUCH MORE ON PARTNERSHIPS THAN WHAT IS IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN. EVOTEC – WE HAVE SAID WE HAVE STARTED WORK WITH. LINEARX WAS MAINLY A TRIAL THAT IS NOW COMPLETE OR STOPPED. EAGLE, THE ONLY THING WE CAN REALLY SAY IS THAT THIS WAS MORE OF A COMMERCIAL AGREEMENT, SO ACTIVITIES WOULD NOT REALLY HAPPEN UNTIL CLOSER TO COMMERCIALIZATION. OTHER THAN THAT, YOU CAN LOOK AT THEIR HOLDINGS AND SEE IF THEY HAVE SOLD SHARES (I DON’T BELIEVE THEY HAVE.) Also from the milestone schedule:NCT04720664-OASIS_Breast_Cancer, Last Update Posted : May 27, 2021, from the graphic: First Patient Enrolled 3Q21 (Oct -Dec 2020) is well passed.We are currently nearing the end of 1H22. Reporting on our current NCT03778996 - Joseph Ahmed Foundation trial."

"Mike (and Fighting Irish), Kick me, but I sold RFL earlier in the week for a decent gain at $18.75, not expecting the ""Fast Track"". Obviously I'm not an insider huh?? I'm no biochemist either, but it seems TYME's two prong approach to inhibiting a cancer cell's metabolism might be more sound than singular RFL approach of targeting the Krebs Cycle so I went much heavier on TYME. I do think (hope) success by any one of the CMBT players such as RFL, CALA and TYME is a success for all of them because it validates, for the first time ever, that you can kill or significantly slow down cancer metastasis by focusing on impairing the metabolic respiration of a cancer cell. The three of them have different MOAs for sure (TYME focusing on Tyrosine for glucose uptake and the mucin layer build, RFL focusing on the Krebs Cycle, and CALA focusing on inhibiting glutaninase which cancer cells use energy). While different, they are all synergistic. I think where all this could go is merge or partner them all and have one super CMBT (oraland safe) approach that literally gums up the entire energy respiration function of a cancer cell. Just my 2 cents, and again I'm not a degreed biochemist by any means, but I do research this stuff pretty carefully. Would love to hear other persepectives to see if i'm totally off my rocker because I have a boatload invested in TYME and a just mere pittance invested in the other 2. Hopefully we hear good news on or about the 16th in the next earnings. We could use it. It's been a very trying 4+ months. Best to all!!"
What's everyone brought at?
"I am long on TYME and I believe the science is amazing and one day we are all going to see tremendous rewards from this company both financially and medically! Having said that, this is the second time I have been burned by a financing deal done thru HC Wainwright. The first was a company called MBOT. Both have great technology and had a need for funds. In both circumstances they employed that financial company who created an offering at 3/4 share value with warrants that provided their prefferred investors with an opportunity to short the stock with very little exposure. With TYME the pending news and tremendous science may prevent the fate of MBOT. But in their case, the short sellers destroyed the stock until they had to do a reverse split and then the same financing company did the same offering again. It's frustrating. If anyone from TYME is reading this......Please, Please, Please partner with a big pharma on this if possible. Protect those of us little guys who believe in you."

"I'm bullish but Richie Cunningham needs to start defending the positive potential of this company with periodic updates on progress of ongoing trials and explanations on its unique approach in treating a list of cancers and as a therapeutic for COVID. The offering at $2.50 is over and Cunningham needs to support those investors along with the rest of us longs with a little more effort to tell a positive story about Tyme and its potential therapeutics. It's not pumping it's well-earned bragging, so let's hear it."
"The message here is exactly what you should have expected if you've been listening the last few months to the updates. While there is no bad news there's also an absence of any good news as well. This is dead money for at least the next 12 months. How could you have expected anything more? But with that said, this could end up be the best story in the history of cancer therapy. Since they have funding thru the end of this process there is very little downside risk to playing a stock that has such huge upside."
"Such negative Nelly's posting here on this board....... Bottom line someone with Dr. Van Tornout pedigree doesn't join a Company like TYME for the money.... he joins because he believes in TYME's science. Stay patient longs this stock is going to payoff in a HUGE way. Richie Cunningham has a vision he is putting the people in place to get it done. Awesome sauce, Loving it. :-)"
"The only thing I hate more than this company is myself, for thinking I was buying on a run up and not at the peak like I apparently did."
"Insider buy, finally, Van Tornout Jan M, a whopping 1K shares for $1.05 registered on EDGAR near close. Probably kept us above a $buck."

@#IAMNOTSELLING = The TRUE FRAUD ! TYMEBusiness Partners w/: -Eagle Pharmaceuticals-Pancreatic Cancer Action Network-Joseph Ahmed Foundation - Massachusetts General Hospital and the Weill Cornell Medical CenterTYME Just added $100mm in cash to the balance sheet from existing institutional TYME investors.Providing a cash run way into late 2024. IN the last 3 months Brought on board top Pharmaceutical experienced leaders: CMO ( Dr. Jan M Van Tornout ) and CFO ( Frank L. Porfido ) Not to mention an experienced Bio Tech CEO in the second half of 2020. If this is not a company setting up for major league success I do not know what is !
"The potential here alone should put TYME @ $500mm Market Cap ! Over $100mm in cash, multiple late stage trials in the works, Entering the Breast Cancer market place...... WE ARE GOING MUCH HIGHER $2.50 PLUS in the short terms !!!!!!!!!"
I think this company is legitimate. FDA trials. Patents. Held by large institutions???
"I have been looking closely at the presentation survival curve. TYME is constrained in how they can present and discuss the data. Witness the law-suits developing.As individual investors we have the luxury of interpreting the data any way we wish. Ultimately the trial must satisfy the FDA, but we can often get hints to possible success by doing our on analysis, so here goes.I'm looking at the survival curve. Let's keep in mind that these 3L+ patients are in desperate situation with literally a few months to live. TYME attempts to recruit these patients into the trial. Before they can even be randomized 5 die, within the first two weeks of the trial another 5 die or drop out. That’s how sick this population is.So, of the initially selected 10 fall out before the drug even has a chance to act. We are now left with 28 patients actually on drug. Within in the first three months 9 patients die at a fairly constant rate. Then something amazing happens. The remaining 19 stop dying. These living patients are on trial from a range of 3 months out to 8 months so far. BUT. NO new deaths shown after the first three months. You can see that on the curve because there are NO step downs after three months.One interpretation of this is that very very sick patients die because they are beyond any medications-terminal, this includes those in pre-drug and early drug patients (2 week phase). Then there are those who die early in the trial because the drug cannot overcome their cancer (it’s just too late). This is the first 3 month period. Note the regularity of deaths, about one every couple weeks.Then there is the group (19/28) where the drug has time to work and they stop dying. Again, NO DEATHS AFTER 3 months on the drug. A key to this is the 3-4 month period. Based on the first three months, a patient died about every 2 weeks. Then from month 3-4 no one died even though there should have been 2 or 3 deaths in this tme period. The remaining survivors are already beyond 4 months on trial (double the historical 2 months).Regardless of the statistical models, if TM-88 can keep half of the 3L+ patients alive for 4+ months (5.5 months post termination of last treatment) it a winner.Keep in mind that 10 patients plus the 9 likely died because the cancer was just too advanced for any drug.This suggests that TM-88 may have even more fantastic results in 1L and 2L trials.Disclaimer: This is my speculation. I know I am breaking many of the statistical rule, but I don’t believe there is enough data to play with statistics. Open to counter arguments. I may be too excited to see my reasoning flaw."
"TYME is going up today ! Hoping close to $2.00.All good stuff. $107.5mm in cash providing a run way into 2025.Even ending the TYME 88 Panc trial makes total sense given the similar enrollment time line as the Precision Promise trial and the earlier action of treatment w/ respect to disease progression. Late stage Panc cancer sadly is pretty much a doom and gloom scenario. The Precision Promise trial is for patients who have only failed one prior line of chemotherapy. Love this statement from Richie C. "" We believe that the market opportunities in HR+/HER2- breast cancer, second-line pancreatic and soft tissue sarcomas are incredibly compelling and increase the total addressable market of the pipeline.""Anticipated Upcoming Key Clinical Events (calendar year timelines):First patient enrolled in OASIS breast cancer trial - 3Q21Complete enrollment for HoPES Sarcoma Phase 2 trial - 1H22Precision Promise 2nd line pancreatic Phase 3 advancement determination - 2H22OASIS breast cancer trial status update - 1H23Given present cash position, burn rate, positive results of the recent sarcoma trial, entrance into the arena of Breast cancer TYME's market cap should be no less than $350mm - $500mm. JMHO. Anyone holding TYME at this price point is going to be very happy a little ways down the road."
Short term technical analysis: Yesterday we had that .20 surge that I mentioned would be coming soon last Friday. We had nice follow through today which is expected since our near term target is 2.68. We may hit it early in the am tomorrow and fall back a dime or two for some healthy sideways trading. If we can surge past 2.68 that will indicate that the buying is stronger than most realize. That may propel us to 2.86 for our next near term target. I didn't want to mention it last week but it was extremely important that the stock never traded below 2 within 2 or 3 days of that huge drop on news. That would have given the shorts the upper hand and potentially destroyed the chart. Slow and steady wins the race!Let's do this!!!

"TYME IR response to questions on our Sarcoma trial. Info only:********************************Hello Mike,Lisa might have responded, but it is not really accurate that there have been no updates on this.In June we presented interim data from this trial at ASCO (link).Also in June, as part of our strategic overview, we highlighted this as an area of continued focus for us. I believe we said the trial had enrolled 16 of the 24 patients, and we guided for completion of enrollment by 1H next year. (link) Given that sarcoma is a pretty rare cancer, and this trial is really out of the one site, the enrollment is not bad. This site normally has patients travel from across the US, but this was obviously reduced during COVID. Based on what we know today, we believe our guidance for completing enrollment is achievable.I hope this helpsJon"
"One week now till proxy vote/annual investors' meeting. Several very promising projects/trials are due NOW out to end of September for 1st Half of 2022 MILESTONES (FYI, Fiscal Year 2022, from April 1st 2021-March 31st 2022).My questions to Investor Relations Rep I'd like to have covered. May raise some questions of your own:For next Tuesday's Investors Meeting and Proxy Vote, I'm asking for clarification on several topics.Has our collaboration with LineaRX/APDN for molecular detection of invasive Circulating Tumor Cells (iCTCs) been replaced by our bio-marker collaboration with Evotec?As of Evotec's own investors' meeting there is no mention of us within their meeting's video stream, or on their presentation @https://www.evotec.com/en/innovate/pharma-partnerships.NCT03512756 - TYME's self-sponsored clinical trial with some collaboration with LINeaRX and Eagle Pharma, from milestones graphic below updates are due now-> end of September (1H22). To summarize, data listed on the Clinical Trial site was Last Update Posted : June 21, 2021. In our collaboration with Eagle RX:Jan 7, 2020 Tyme Technologies and Eagle Pharmaceuticals Announce Strategic Collaboration///////OUR MILESTONE PAYMENT CAVEATS\\\\\\\\\\\\\In addition, TYME will receive a $20 million MILESTONE payment upon the successful completion of the first to occur of the following three events:(1) Achievement of the primary endpoint of overall survival in its TYME-88-Panc pivotal trial;.....or(2) Achievement of the primary endpoint of overall survival in the PanCAN Precision Promise? SM-88 registration arm;.....or(3) U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of SM-88 in any cancer.This payment would be split into a $10 million milestone cash payment and a $10 million investment in TYME at a 15% premium to the then prevailing market price. Eagle’s shares will be restricted from sale until the earlier of three months following the milestone event or the three-year anniversary of the agreement.Hoping the trial status and working collaborations be fully discussed. If our therapeutics (i.e. SM-88, SM-18, et al) are now being manufactured by EVOTEC, please expound. Updates on our working agreements with EAGLE and LinEARX also requested.

"As usual, the small run up recently has brought the small profit takers to the surface and they taking their short term profits and headed to the barn. You can count on this to short stop any further rixe untils some positive news in the upcoming events( June 4-8) June 10. If we can get some positive news it will take off and the profit takers miss the boat or have to buy back in at a higher price. GLTA"
"TYME Technologies is a new biotechnology company that develops “cancer metabolism-based therapies” or CMBTs. These treatments are designed to work across a wide range of diagnoses, solid tumors, hematologic cancers and more. The stock is trending higher after receiving patent notification for its metabolomic technology platform."
Look at SAVA and read some of the rueful posts of those who made a profit but sold way too soon after the first surge in SP. It's a useful lesson.
When TYME was trading today in the $1.80s I told you MOMO amateurs to sell ... cause TYME would continue to sell-off into the close and end the day in the $1.30s !!!! Where'd TYME close??? In the $1.30s

"been holding for months, best time to get in"
"Again, thank you for the $$,$$$. Either your bosses are awesome or $2pid$. BOTH?"
"IMO TYME shares are a gift right here right now. Highly likely that pending next phase of PANC-88 trial proves highly effective at showing significant superiority in OS vs the current nonexistent standards of care which basically amount to a 2-3 month death March for those patients. And with benign (ie, basically none) serious side effects and an oral regimen, the 10,000 3L patients seeking treatment will crash the gates to gain access to sm-88. And with potentially $500 mm plus in Revs for 3L panc alone, tyme could be conservatively be worth $2.5 B just on 3L panc. There are currently 103 mm shares outstanding. The knock on TYME is that they need cash. Fine. But i estimate that they can complete their own trial plus PanCan 1L and 2L trials after raising another $40-50 mm. And not all of it has to be in straight equity. But let’s assume conservatively that they raise $50 mm at $2.50. Then share count would rise to 123 mm but let’s call it 125 mm. So $2.5 B/125 mm shares equates to $20 a share stock price. AND JUST FOR 3L PANC alone. Obviously there would be huge halo effect and higher valuation when considering 1L and 2L panc plus the 14 other cancers they have shown efficacy in.And what if TYME updates the data from first stage of panc-88 that shows median OS surpasses best in class 6.1 months achieved by the highly toxic onivyde in 2L. I suspect that it will. Such an update could come very soon as 68% had survived 4.3 months at Jan 6th and 79% of 3L patients had survived 4.7 mos (so they could already be beyond 6.1 months). What might the stock do if TYMe shows such compelling OS survival data? It sure seems to me that it should go up a lot meaning that they could issue fewer shares than noted aboveThe 10 mm shorts are playing with fire. They are counting on an equity deal to bail them out. But what if they get shut out from allocations? And what will the stock do once this overhang is resolved? Skyrocket!! One should think upside/downside scenarios. Let’s say downside is a little more dire. Call it $2.00. But what is upside? $20 very conservatively. I will take $20 upside versus $2.00 downside in a $2.75 stock all day long."
"Listen, we need TYME to be 3 digits… $120 meme guys capitalize this on the good news!"
"I've darted in and out of several of the hot ""Covid stocks"" the last few months. They've all jump upon milestone announcements such as ""full enrollment"" etc. Covid study are quick to show results. They either show efficacy compared to a 15 day placebo or they don't, and the results are generally disclosed within about 30 days after. Much more cut and dry compared to pancreatic cancer studies (ha). So as troubling as this last 2 months of weakness has been to us all HOPEFULLY we'll see some positive news events in the next few weeks that should move this stock. And who knows, maybe TYME-19 may actually work against the virus. If so, we're all dancing in the streets fellas!! GOOD LUCK LONGS!!"
Its not a sell till $15. The stock has strong fundamentals and technicals. Don't regret it selling early for quick profits.
lets get this thing to 2million a share
"Last week, US-based biotechnology company Tyme Technologies announced a new oral treatment for the coronavirus that could prove pivotal in the fight against COVID-19.The drug, named TYME-19,could be given to patients that test positive for COVID-19 before they are hospitalized, and could also be taken by front line health care workers and high-risk individuals to minimize the chance of infection, said a representative from Tyme Technologies.TYME-19 is made from synthesized antiviral bile acid and has proved efficient at fighting COVID-19 in preclinical trials, the firm said at the time. Tyme Technologies partnered with doctors from the Massachusetts General Hospital and the Weill Cornell Medical Center for clinical trials of the drug.Read the latest updates in our dedicated coronavirus section.“TYME-19 is the only agent in this class of metabolic-based medicines derived from bile acids. It has a unique mechanism of action modeled after the body’s own defenses against virus infection. TYME-19 is oral and instant, differing from all injectables including vaccines,” Steven Hoffman, co-founder, chief executive, and chief science officer of Tyme Technologies told Al Arabiya English on Wednesday.Here’s everything you need to know about the new treatment:Does TYME-19 stop the coronavirus?So far, clinical trials have proven successful, with TYME-19 stopping COVID-19 from replicating in treated cells without causing damage.“In preclinical testing, TYME-19 repeatedly prevented COVID-19 viral replication without cytotoxicity in treated cells. Previous preclinical research has also shown select bile acids like TYME-19 have had broad antiviral activity,” Hoffman added.However, Hoffman added that further testing is necessary, and highlighted the importance of the firm’s partnership with Massachusetts General Hospital and Weill Cornell for further testing opportunities. A new proof-of-concept study is set to take place to evaluate the effectiveness of TYME-19 versus a placebo in newly diagnosed patients with high-risk factors. The study is set to take place before the end of 2020.“Positive results from the proof-of-concept study could lead to a development program in which TYME-19 is studied as a potential new oral treatment for patients with COVID-19 before they require hospitalization, and/or as prophylaxis for high-risk individuals and front-line workers,” Hoffman explained.￼A Flourish bar chart raceHow was TYME-19 developed?Tyme Technologies developed TYME-19 based on experience the firm had in developing a different type of bile acid, TYME-18, for its anticancer products.“TYME-19 is part of a family of metabolic agents called bile acids that have previously been associated strictly with liver disease but recently are recognized for their potential utility to treat multiple diseases. Bile acids are important regulators for many cellular functions throughout the central nervous, cardiovascular and metabolic systems,” Hoffman said.Viruses attack the ability of the body’s cells to make proteins and lipids, instead using this process to replicate itself. TYME-19 has been shown to prevent viruses from doing so, Hoffman went on to explain.“In preclinical testing, TYME-19 has been shown to counteract these effects, preventing viral replication, by reducing ER stress. In addition, TYME-19 is believed to physically degrade viruses by solubilizing the protective lipid layer and other structural components, which prevent a virus from binding to and infecting a cell,” he said.For all the latest headlines, follow our Google News channel online or via the app.How is TYME-19 different from other COVID-19 medications in development?Hoffman highlighted the company’s belief in TYME-19's safety as a COVID-19 drug, noting that it can be taken orally and is stable at room temperature – thus lowering the risk of the drug degrading through improper care.TYME-19 will also be “relatively inexpensive to manufacture,” Hoffman said – an important factor to consider given the global need coronavirus treatment. The drug can also help protect front line health workers and high-risk populations, crucial to slowing the spread of the virus before a cure and vaccine can be developed, he said.“Doctors need more tools between hospital care and vaccines. Until there is a cure (not just a vaccine), doctors will need multiple medicines for their treatment regimen … Vaccines are a key part of the solution for a pandemic, but there needs to be better therapies available while the vaccines are being developed,” Hoffman added."
What to buy in at?
"Like I said yesterday, if this drops under $2.5 I will liquidate my account and go all in on tyme. THEY WILL HAVE TO GIVE ME A SPOT AT THE SHAREHOLDER MEETING. All jokes aside I have never been this confident in a stock and I have been adding every dip. $2.5 and under I will go 100% in."
"This should not surprise anyone! Nothing positive is going to happen until Tyme has some meaningful positive and documented success and is able to share and confirm same, everyone get over the disappointing action of this stock as nothing is going to change for a long time and just be prepared to hang out between .85 and 1.30. I know is boring and frustrating but it takes real results to make it go up and that is not happening anytime soon. Best you can hope for most likely is something good in the first quarter of 2022. Those are my thoughts and I have almost quit watching it period and certainly so have others and the POST are far and very few between."
Lets get our profits by spring 2022 Price target is 1year not by end of year
"Does Tyme partner with drug companies that they are testing their products/ delivery system with? Seems those companies should be contributing to the testing as they benefit. Very long term bullish, short term yawn."
"Got a good perspective piece over on Seeking Alpha published yesterday.Tyme Technologies: The Market Missed The Bullish MemoCovers everything we've gone over here. Despite the brilliance here, Seeking Alpha gets a broader reading audience. GLTUA"
"Sold high cost at $1.14; plenty of time to play with this until Nov, then go long for the result release in late Dec / Jan."
"Well, have to admit these guys really stretch the envelope when it comes to being communicatingly challenged. That was probably the most boring and unenlightening conference calls I've ever heard. They certainly checked the block on every cliche imaginable. ""We're expediting our actions to react quickly . . ."". Really? I got absolutely nothing out of it. They literally could have called that one in. Oh wait that's what they did. The highlight was coming in withe the entire CC under 20 minutes, the lone substitute covering analyst question notwithstanding. The good news is that they are somehow able to convince folks like us to pony up 100 million dollars at $2.50 a pop in support of what they're doing. but I wish they would act a little more thrill about what they're doing than what we're doing, at least during a conference call. Still long here, but totally unimpressed with Richie and the Fonz, et al, and their communication skills."

"Well nuts,Today's telecon/10Q kind of an abbreviated rehash. Not close to expansion of programs I was hoping for.It did shed light on our collaboration with EVOTECH, largely a European bio tech, and use of biomarkers vs. PET scans (e.g. Invasive Circulating Tumor Cells (iCTCs) ) in monitoring clinical effect of therapies.With my first notice of EVOTECH collaboration.Question arises on whether our SM-88 may be in used over in European Clinical Trials, coincidentally, EVOTECH is having their own investor meeting tomorrow:On to 24 August, proxy vote and telecon. No change to ballot announced today. Was hoping for addition of voting on buyout offer. AHHHH, not happening.GLTUA"
lets get past 2 before lunch.
barcode... why?
Recent Stock price action is giving me new hope !!! Nice volume and upward movement since the New CEO was announced. Very happy to see Hoffman stepping aside from the CEO roll. Love the fact that the NEW CEO who is from Icagen Inc they were a wholly owned subsidiary of Ligand Pharma ( whom has a strong history of partnering with smaller bio tech companies . Richie Cunningham also has strong knowledge of efficient partnering strategies with large Pharma's and experience spanning from pre-IND drug discovery through the commercialization and launch of over a dozen therapies in oncology.About TYME we have a REAL Clinical Stage BIO TECH CEO at the helm............
"If you strip out the 10 4th and 5th line patients (5 of whom are dead), which are the type of patients whose survival is expected to be 1-2 months at most and who nobody but Tyme allows into a clinical trial for PANC, then the survival data look pretty compelling. 14 out of 18 second and third line patients (14 of whom are third line, where historical survival data suggests 2-3 months) remain alive. Median overall survival will not even be measurable until 5 of these patients have died - which we hope for their sake and their families is many months or even years away. The final median OS number - which is already extremely solid in this patient population - could end up being very impressive indeed. The fact that the drug appears this potent in the third line setting bodes very well, in my view, for its future performance in the Pancan trial, which will be limited to second line patients where historical survival rates are much longer than in third line. Separately but relatedly, the one image in the poster of the 4th line patient who achieved such an impressive tumor response is in some respects all one needs to see. This is a patient who had a Zero percent chance of achieving a response based on data from all other analyzed 3rd line and beyond trials. Yet on sm-88 she achieves a partial response and a reduction of 90% in CA-19.9, all without side effects."
"Mean daily step count during the first 2 weeks of treatment with SM-88 (racemetyrosine) was found to correlate with overall self-reported quality of life (QoL) in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer, according to the results from a preliminary exploratory analysis from part 2 of the phase 2/3 TYME-88-Panc trial (NCT03512756) presented during the 2021 Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium."
"More insiders filing to buy in. $2 January calls siting at .20 seems like an easy 200%-300% grab next 2 weeks, with a catch net catalyst coming in November. Dont see how this play isnt just easy money. I picked up 20 contracts today. Thoughts?"
"Mike, thanks for getting the update from IR on the Mass Gen and Weill trials. And look at you, you're on a first name basis with them. I'll just start filtering questions thru you (ha). I have to imagine if/when these trial approvals are announced it should provide a nice pop to the stock (at least for 20 minutes, which is 5 mins longer than the covid news held for). This weakness is nerve wracking to say the least. Do we average down on an already over-exposed postion?? Wow, tough call !!"
get in now!
"Looks Like ""Thomas"" is going to get his wish( 5 days ago post) for TYME to go below $1"
"I mentioned in the past there's 3 CMBT focused stocks that I know of TYME, RFL and CALA. , They each have different MOAs but they are worth watching from the standpoint that they're each focused on proving the efficacy of attacking cancer from within the mitochondria. CALA just announced this morning they missed their end point and stock is down 55% in pre-market. Again, completely different MOA than TYME and as they are focusing on inhibiting Glutaminase. Also they took on different cancer types (renal cell) than TYME and RFL. It is rather unlikely this will prove to have relevance or impact on TYME's science ultimately but worth watching but clearly one CMBT did not work. 1 down 2 to go. Good luck here longs!!"
"Just about 3 weeks left in FY2021 for TYME. Annual earnings released in May. FY2022 begins April 1st.Take that anyway you want. Trader's link to Seeking Alpha article is. A real gem if you came on with the bull rush on COVID patent. Our Proof Of Concept as a COVID treatment was promised this quarter. Probable recovery time for the flippers here.Fourth Quarter was our target for reporting on cancer clinical trials. That got slipped to 2022 using COVID as the cause.That starts April. They've been on target on their milestone projections always on page 5 of the Corporate Presentation. Last one released November 2020. Next one coming with 2021 Earnings, this May.The recent financining timed to the COVID pump. As a long holder and accumulator, we've had a large OPEN SHELF offering out. for at least a year.Now closed. The pump SEEMS to. have provided a method to reduce long holders dilution. I'm OK with it.Within the open shelf, there were numerous ""CHOKE"" provisions requiring a 6-month period to pass before purchased warrants placed within DTCC short registration.Registered warrants available for short term trades had a recent 40% increase. Retail volume ZOOMED up.TYME has NO INCOME. Every product is on Clinical Trial status. Anticipated announcements before April are start of trials in COVID, breast and blood born cancer treatments.Possible expansion to 3d stage prostate and update to on-going trial in Sarcoma.Doubt if this will drop to $1. Whom knows. See it really climbing till May earnings.My thoughts. GLTUA"

"This stock to me is not about turning a profit. It is about fighting cancer. It sounds to me as though they are trying. All of you trying to short or pump amd dump, I have no words!"
Awesome news today. The new era has begun. It's GO TYME !
"2021-9-23; 5 PM EST. Something big happening with TYME. It is up 4 cents after hours on exceedingly high volume of 381,000 shares. Note that it only traded about 655,000 shares all day. Does anyone have relevant news?"
"Doing research on $tyme over the weekend I found something VERY INTERESTING. TYME's new CEO ""Mr. Cunningham also brings significant experience in mergers & acquisitions, business development, strategy development, therapeutic launches, contracting, managed care, and sales & marketing. Most recently, Richie served as CEO at Icagen, leading the company through two transformational acquisitions, acquiring assets and talent out of Pfizer and Sanofi. While CEO at Icagen, he successfully negotiated and signed multiple licensing deals with Roche, Sanofi and the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation"" What I want you to pay attention to is the very first part, Mergers and acquisitions, their cash burn rate is so low so why do an 100 million dollar offer? Could we be looking at a possible merger or acquisition? Is that why the offer was for so much money? Their cash burn rate last year was about 20 million for the year so not why do a 20 million offer or 25 something like that? We have seen mergers with other small biotechs like OBLN and JAGX that worked out very well. Could we be looking at something huge here?? Just throwing some ideas out there, anyone else have opinions on this?"
"I think the real story here is from those in the industry showing real confidence in the science behind this stock and the ability of those running things to eventually bring it to fruition with a pipeline of marketable therapeutics. Eagle Pharmaceutical and the most recent targeted $100 million offering. They all voted with money, lots of it. And that is as bullish as it gets. I'm sitting 40K shares at 1.46 and have been in over a year and certainly patient enough for another year if need be to see an 8- or 10-bagger here."
will this run to 3$
49 K @ 1.72 
"Where is the annual filing? Really taking a while...Anyhow, some thoughts: Current cash appears to be sufficient to fund them through fiscal year end 2020, although it’s tight. If 3L trial starts in the next couple of months and enrollment accrues at a similar pace to their last trial, then in addition to release of the full updated Panc data, updates on sarcoma and prostate trials, they may actually have a realistic chance at getting to prelim data on at least 1 of their Panc registrational trials before needing to raise more funds - or at least price a deal. They’ve been steadily increasing their market/industry appearances and should be cultivating new potential relationships with prospective investors as well as continuing to develop those relationships with the few existing investors. Right now Tyme is very tightly held and still significantly insider owned. It’s volatile and risky in its own right. Broadening the investor base will be important to continue the company’s transition toward their great aspirations. A $12m funding deal cratered the pps. Perhaps it won’t take much to make it soar."
"IMHO, 21st of April's S-8 registration of 6 million shares with a strike price of $1.50 is our best indicator of what may be in store for us.It comes out to approximately a $10 million funding exercise replacing previously awarded options/ warrants to insiders. Those warrants came out averaging $3.40. More factors to consider. Annual report must be filed no later than June.

"A little shout out to: SM-88 (racemetyrosine)Pancreatic cancer market to reach $4.1 billion by 2029: GlobalData Resource Apr 25, 2021Growth in pancreatic cancer therapy market will be driven by the introduction of drugs with novel mechanisms of action, across several lines of therapies, which are poised to meet high unmet need in the US and 5EUThe pancreatic cancer market has seen the launch of premium-priced therapies in the last three to four years in late-stage pancreatic cancer patients, resulting in current valuation at $1.9 billion in 2019. GlobalData forecasts an increase to $4.1 billion in 2029 at a moderate compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.2 per cent with the expected launch of nine pipeline products across the eight major markets (*8MM).The company’s report, ‘Pancreatic Cancer – Opportunity Analysis and Forecasts to 2029’, reveals that CP-613 (devimistat), developed by Rafael Pharmaceuticals, and Masiviera (masitinib), developed by AB Science, will be the lead candidates in the first-line from a clinical and commercial standpoint. Launches for NTRK inhibitors, Vitrakvi and Rozlytrek, in the **5EU and ***ASPAC will provide further market growth and diversification. This forecast period will likely also see the introduction of novel agents, namely CORT 125134 (relacorilant) and SM-88 (racemetyrosine) in the third-line setting, where currently no specific treatment exists, and supportive care is heavily relied upon.Aarohi Rede, Oncology Analyst at GlobalData, comments, “Pancreatic cancer is primarily a chemotherapy dominated market, which includes low priced generic drugs currently forming the backbone of the treatment paradigm. Growth in pancreatic cancer therapy market will be driven by the introduction of drugs with novel mechanisms of action, across several lines of therapies, which are poised to meet high unmet need in the US and 5EU.“Market growth trends are indicative of shift in market consumption from chemotherapy to use of targeted therapies, and a shift in the treatment paradigm towards personalized medicine approaches between 2019 and 2029. Kinase inhibitors, comprising several classes of pipeline agents currently in development, are expected to be the frontrunners among the pipeline agents over the forecast period, occupying roughly 22 per cent of market share by 2029.”Pancreatic cancer is characterised by expression of several genetic mutations and tumour biomarkers, many of which, such as NTRK gene fusions, PD-L1 expression, and elevated levels of microsatellite instability (MSI) levels, are considered actionable mutations and have been utilised to target tumour cells by recently launched targeted therapies. Although applicable in a small percentage of populations, key opinion leaders (KOLs) interviewed by GlobalData have identified targeted drugs such as immune checkpoint inhibitors and PARP inhibitors to be revolutionary in pancreatic cancer from a clinical standpoint.Rede continues, “Pancreatic cancer has historically been an indication with high unmet need with delayed detection of the disease, rapid progression, lack of effective therapies, high clinical trial failure rates, and poor survival outcomes. With targeted therapies gaining more acceptance and popularity among treating physicians, there is a growing emphasis around biomarker testing and early detection.“Additionally, GlobalData’s analysis highlights that the transition of pancreatic cancer staging from the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 7th edition to the 8th edition has led to further categorisation of patients into later stages of the disease resulting in higher proportions of advanced cases. That, combined with high trial failure rates, has left this indication difficult to tackle. These agents provide unique opportunity for patients expressing these biomarkers to obtain superior clinical results in combination with other established agents.”Pancreatic cancer is a high-need, high-opportunity oncology indication with growing incidence globally. GlobalData has identified urban China as a high growth market in this indication, being classified as a one of the largest pancreatic cancer markets along with the US and Japan in 2029. The US, however, is still expected to be the market leader in 2029, being valued twice as much as in 2019, thus highlighting interesting market dynamics for this indication based on incidence rates, clinical approaches and product commercialisation."
"Couple excerpts from yesterday's PR from PANCAN, we're partnered in with on Clinical Trial NCT04229004Pancreatic Cancer Action Network Announces Groundbreaking Clinical Trial Platform Transforming Development Of Treatment Options for World's Toughest Cancerhttps://www.tmcnet.com/usubmit/-pancreatic-cancer-action-network-announces-groundbreaking-clinical-trial-/2020/10/13/9236684.htmWe're joined in this with Rafael Pharma and their Cancer Metabolism Based Therapy (CMBT) platform/Drug CPI-613Difference (in my limited understanding) is CPI-613 disrupts the cancer cell's mitochondrial metabolism, SM-88 disrupts metabolism in several cellular processe including waste disposal (authphagy) and any Tyrosine required process, which triggers events. Who T? am I though. LOS ANGELES, Oct. 13, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- The Pancreatic Cancer Action Network (PanCAN) announced today the launch of Precision PromiseSM, the first of its kind adaptive clinical trial platform for pancreatic cancer patients. PanCAN's Precision Promise was envisioned with a nationwide team of leading clinicians, researchers, and diagnostic and drug developers to test novel treatment options for pancreatic cancer patients quicker and cheaper and get them to patients faster, transforming the way clinical research is done........ PanCAN's Precision Promise platform was designed to be smarter, faster and cheaper than traditional clinical trials.PanCAN's Precision Promise clinical trial is designed to develop new pancreatic cancer treatments more efficiently.Every pancreatic cancer treatment available today was approved through a clinical trial; however, standard trials are slow, costly, and have only had a 10 percent success rate over the last 20 years. PanCAN's novel clinical trial platform is designed to enable the development of new treatments more efficiently than standard pancreatic cancer trials by testing multiple experimental therapies at the same time. Through Precision Promise, metastatic pancreatic cancer patients may have the opportunity to receive both first- and second-line treatment options in one clinical trial......PanCAN is grateful to its generous donors as well as its Scientific & Medical Affairs Industry Members who help make research initiatives like Precision Promise possible. Industry members include: AbbVie, AstraZeneca, IPSEN, Pfizer, Rafael Pharmaceuticals, Tempus, TriSalus Life Sciences, and Tyme Technologies, Inc._________________________All I got. Been thinking for a while SM-88 and CPI-613 can co-exist.This may help us getting out of the cellar here.GLTUA"
It will be a nice day when TYME hits 4.00 very soon. Do your on DD. Just my opinion.
There appears to be some opportunist institutional buying going on ! Decent sized blocks being acquired. Nice to see.... Hope some good news soon.
dont sell this will fly.
All in ! I will hold overnight.

"Hi,I am looking into TYME and I like their approach. Can you please help me to identify next catalyst? When do you expect it to take place?"
"Tmrw is end of February. That is 1.8 months from Jan 6th, the date when the OS survival data was measured. Recall 68% of all patients had survived 4.3 months at Jan 6 and 79% of 3L patients had achieved 4.7 mos of OS. And significantly all patients in the study who had achieved 3 plus months OS were still alive at Jan 6th ( from 3 mos to around 8 mos). Point being that if the drug has had the time to work in these very sick patients, it showed very impressive efficacy (along with amazing safety) as the survival curve had flat lined from 3 months on (which is highly unusual).I believe that there is a very good chance that tyme has not yet hit median OS in either the overall group or the the 3L subsegment. If true, that would mean it has achieved 6.1 mos (4.3 +1.8) overall and 6.5 months for 3L. That would be amazing. That cannot be overstated. These patients expected to live 2 mos. There are no viable treatment options for the 10,000 3L patients seeking treatment. In 2L panc, the highly toxic onivyde has shown the best OS with a median of 6.1 months. There is a very good chance we match that tmrw and surpass that with every passing day.The company is informed fairly quickly when patients die. So they should know within a few days of month end if they have matched or surpassed onivyde. Hopefully they share such potentially amazing news with the market. Which could put the fear of god into the shorts who are actively manipulating the stock. And also attract lots of long only buyers. Fingers crossed "
Big boom tmrw morning. Look where they were in Feb.
"If you just bought this without knowing anything about it, the thesis is simple. TYME believes (and has some clinical evidence to support) the idea that they can kill cancer cells without killing the surrounding cells by inhibiting the cancer cells ability to replicate and feed themselves. Read their studies, and the mechanism of action. If they are right, it's a complete game-changer for cancer treatment (and I guess COVID/viruses, but we'll see...) If they are wrong, their cash burn rate is a very fast fuse toward bankruptcy. So their future looks pretty binary. Read the science and decide if you believe them. It's purely a ""story stock"" at this point. I'm (very) long, but you need to decide for yourself.The current (this week) hope is that the preliminary results from the pancreatic cancer trial they started back in January last year are in, and positive. If that turns out to be the case, big upside. If not, well it'll drift back to $1 while we all continue to wait."
This is huge news buy hold
