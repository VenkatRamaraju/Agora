Any potential new collaborative agreements in the works ? What else are you guys doing other than sitting back and waiting for feedback from your CMO's ? Your shareholders are hungry for news / an update ! Come on Richie it's past dinner time !"
"Monday November 8th, Press conference"
why are insiders selling??? Steve Hoffman- 156250 shares... what's going on?
Insiders set to sell again on Friday.
"For Sesen Bio (Biotech company) - ticker SESN. It is NASDAQ company which dips below $ 1 right now. In the yahoo board discussion, someone post below message. ""Something all shareholders should be aware of is that NASDQ will soon send a warning to SESN about their sp. If management are not able to get the price above $2 their only recourse will be a reverse split. I have been involved in 2 small biotechs that this has occurred and from an investor perspective this is not beneficial.""What are the chances that we also fall for same issue here? Is it possible? If not, why not?Only serious feedback please.Thanks."
Nice little bump on solid volume.... Market Cap should be somewhere closer to $350mm - $400mm. Come on Richie share some good news !!! Any interesting collaborations in the works ????
Where’s my pumpernickel FightingLeprechaun at? He said this “stock price will pop any moment now!”?
"This should not surprise anyone! Nothing positive is going to happen until Tyme has some meaningful positive and documented success and is able to share and confirm same, everyone get over the disappointing action of this stock as nothing is going to change for a long time and just be prepared to hang out between .85 and 1.30. I know is boring and frustrating but it takes real results to make it go up and that is not happening anytime soon. Best you can hope for most likely is something good in the first quarter of 2022. Those are my thoughts and I have almost quit watching it period and certainly so have others and the POST are far and very few between."
"This should biopharma has just left a conference picking up 3 more analysts. Their reports should push this up fast, and without warning. too much cash on hand vs free cash flow. one day this will jump 100%-300% almost over night, or over a weekend. The institutional investment here knows when they try to kick up the SP that retail investors short, or take profit. If the investors that are on this thread would stop selling, and shorting on small spikes every TYME, we would see continued growth."
"TYME IR response to questions on our Sarcoma trial. Info only:********************************Hello Mike,Lisa might have responded, but it is not really accurate that there have been no updates on this.In June we presented interim data from this trial at ASCO (link).Also in June, as part of our strategic overview, we highlighted this as an area of continued focus for us. I believe we said the trial had enrolled 16 of the 24 patients, and we guided for completion of enrollment by 1H next year. (link) Given that sarcoma is a pretty rare cancer, and this trial is really out of the one site, the enrollment is not bad. This site normally has patients travel from across the US, but this was obviously reduced during COVID. Based on what we know today, we believe our guidance for completing enrollment is achievable.I hope this helpsJon"
"Let us have your prediction on what is likely to be the high print for TYME in the Sept. and Oct. (roughly two-month) interval. I will stick my neck out and predict a high of $1.29 (with a probability of 0.8), but will also note that $1.63 is likely (with a probability of 0.4). I have invested a substantial sum with these figures in mind."
It will be a nice day when TYME hits 4.00 very soon. Do your on DD. Just my opinion.
Why is tyme down?
"Do not think anyone posting on this board has ever mentioned the Tangible Book Value of this Company is $1.72 which is usually considered positive from the standpoint that the stock is trading a good bit below it's book value. In simple terms, it is trading at a value .72+ less than what the book value per share is at $1.72. The current stock price is obviously undervalued at the current trading prices."
Nice pre-market. Sarcoma data updates due by 30 Sept. Short holdings have half-day to cover:).GLTUA
This is going to take 8 months before we see 4-5 dollars barring some fda approval. I’m waiting but damn I would love the triple up. Big potential just need to hold. Willing to hold for 2 years to make 10x good fundamentals good path higher financing
"Thinking there's a plan. Tyme insider David Carberry broke the string of 5 days below a buck back in September. Have to go 30 straight trading days to only BEGIN the process of NASDAQ de-listing.And, from FDC's Clinical Trial records, the possibility of GOOD NEWS in the last two months of calendar year 2021 are encouraging.*************************************************************NCT03778996 – Ewings Sarcoma, Joseph Ahmed FoundationEstimated Primary Completion Date October 31, 2021 (Final data collection date for primary outcome measure)*************************************************************NCT03512756 Pancreatic CancerEstimated Study Completion Date December 31, 2021 (ICMJE**) International Committee of Medical Journal Editors********Ewings Sarcoma is a small trial, 1 medical center, not a lot of patients.Pancreatic cancer trial was/is the TYME self-sponsored trial Cunningham told us WILL BE shutting down. Suggesting patience is needed now.MHOGLTUA"
Where is the “pop” our pumpernickel FightingLeprechaun talking about? LOL
I can’t wait for the squeeze
Awesome news today. The new era has begun. It's GO TYME !
"Voyager Therapeutics Stock, a Beaten-Down Biotech, Soars on Pfizer License DealI can see this in our future ! Come on Richie C. I know you got it in you !"
"been holding for months, best time to get in"
"Contacted Investor Relations about update of Ewings Sarcoma Clinical Trial Update (HOPES Trial, CT ID = NCT03778996). Not getting an update till October at the earliest. I wasn't misled, I just misinterpeted.So it goes. Here's some data. My apol Interventional (Clinical Trial)Estimated Enrollment : 24 participantsAllocation: Non-RandomizedIntervention Model: Parallel AssignmentMasking: None (Open Label)Primary Purpose: TreatmentOfficial Title: A Phase 2 Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of SM-88 Used With Methoxsalen, Phenytoin, and Sirolimus (MPS) as Response Maintenance Therapy Following Standard Treatments for Patients With Ewing's Sarcoma or as Salvage Therapy for Patients With Clinically Advanced SarcomasActual Study Start Date : January 3, 2020Estimated Primary Completion Date : October 31, 2021Estimated Study Completion Date : October 31, 2023"
Its a yoyo
price target 9.50$ go up!!$TYME
"When the company finds a less harmful and revolutionary cure for cancer, the stock will go over $ 100. now we just have to wait"
"SM-88 will have a break through in these trials, only a mater of time. plus look at the Financials of this company, easiest investment ever, get in now or regret later"
"Until we get some really good news TYME is going no where and as I have said before. will hang between .85 and 1.20 so just stay calm and do not get so excited over these small premature pops as we have a good while( probably 2022) before we even scare the $2 and $4 marks people are talking about. It stinks but it is reality so ""stay cool, calm and collect"" and wait for 2022."
"Sold $1.14, time to load up here soon. Thanks for the $$$. Round trip # 3 or go long?"
"2021-9-23; 5 PM EST. Something big happening with TYME. It is up 4 cents after hours on exceedingly high volume of 381,000 shares. Note that it only traded about 655,000 shares all day. Does anyone have relevant news?"
At least it is consistant. Looks like we have a $1 stock until there is some positive results and/or news.
"Hello Mike and the rest of this board, Look at RFL this morning, another cancer metabolism based therapy failed in 2 trials, one pancreatic and AML. The stock is down 75% today to $7 but it had been at $50 several weeks ago. They got no pipeline left. This is the second cancer metabolism approach that's failed. CALA failed in theirs last year. What does it mean for TYME?? Either TYME will own this space all to themselves if their different MOA shows efficacy OR they go the same way as CALA and RFL because cancer metabolism just isn't the answer. This is either a massive home run for us or it goes to zero. There's no in-between here. I've was not in CALA or RFL. I always believed the TYME MOA (as did Mike) was more logical and a more multi-faceted approach than the others but we'll see over the new few months. Good luck longs!!!"

What is making it go back up ?
Not worried here at all. As usual NO NEGATIVE NEWS. Very light volume. May pick up some more at this price point. Current avg share price in the mid $1.20 range. Think I will. Not a doubt in my mind this will bounce back again. Just need that little kicker of GOOD NEWS from Richie Cunningham to bounce this into the $2.00 range and get this off the garage floor ! :-) Come on Richie whatcha say.... give us little guys a little love !
"More insiders filing to buy in. $2 January calls siting at .20 seems like an easy 200%-300% grab next 2 weeks, with a catch net catalyst coming in November. Dont see how this play isnt just easy money. I picked up 20 contracts today. Thoughts?"
