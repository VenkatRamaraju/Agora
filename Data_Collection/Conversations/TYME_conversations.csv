"One week now till proxy vote/annual investors' meeting. Several very promising projects/trials are due NOW out to end of September for 1st Half of 2022 MILESTONES (FYI, Fiscal Year 2022, from April 1st 2021-March 31st 2022).My questions to Investor Relations Rep I'd like to have covered. May raise some questions of your own:For next Tuesday's Investors Meeting and Proxy Vote, I'm asking for clarification on several topics.Has our collaboration with LineaRX/APDN for molecular detection of invasive Circulating Tumor Cells (iCTCs) been replaced by our bio-marker collaboration with Evotec?As of Evotec's own investors' meeting there is no mention of us within their meeting's video stream, or on their presentation @https://www.evotec.com/en/innovate/pharma-partnerships.NCT03512756 - TYME's self-sponsored clinical trial with some collaboration with LINeaRX and Eagle Pharma, from milestones graphic below updates are due now-> end of September (1H22). To summarize, data listed on the Clinical Trial site was Last Update Posted : June 21, 2021. In our collaboration with Eagle RX:Jan 7, 2020 Tyme Technologies and Eagle Pharmaceuticals Announce Strategic Collaboration///////OUR MILESTONE PAYMENT CAVEATS\\\\\\\\\\\\\In addition, TYME will receive a $20 million MILESTONE payment upon the successful completion of the first to occur of the following three events:(1) Achievement of the primary endpoint of overall survival in its TYME-88-Panc pivotal trial;.....or(2) Achievement of the primary endpoint of overall survival in the PanCAN Precision Promise? SM-88 registration arm;.....or(3) U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of SM-88 in any cancer.This payment would be split into a $10 million milestone cash payment and a $10 million investment in TYME at a 15% premium to the then prevailing market price. Eagle’s shares will be restricted from sale until the earlier of three months following the milestone event or the three-year anniversary of the agreement.Hoping the trial status and working collaborations be fully discussed. If our therapeutics (i.e. SM-88, SM-18, et al) are now being manufactured by EVOTEC, please expound. Updates on our working agreements with EAGLE and LinEARX also requested. Alsofrom the milestone schedule:NCT04720664-OASIS_Breast_Cancer, Last Update Posted : May 27, 2021, from the graphic: First Patient Enrolled 3Q21 (Oct -Dec 2020) is well passed.We are currently nearing the end of 1H22.

"Ellen Degernous just bought 4million shares, this thing. is easily going to 2000/share"
Who’s driving this rocket ??
"The last run didn't even create a new support level. Right back to where we were. I got in a 1.17 last run and out a 1.60. I am putting my spare change into Tyme when it drops below $1.00. She likes to run on news, but can't hold its value."
were almost there
Our pumpernickel DavidNIO has been gone for almost 2 years now mates. He move to #tyme and changed his name and picture to a girl FightingIrishTYME. She’ll make us monies daily. I wonder what her prediction is for TYME IN 7 DAYS? where’s my pumpernickel DavidNIO at
Power hour and AH
"Monday is up swing on the trade. Tuesday news: milestone payments, partnership agreements with evotech Europe. Coupled with the patent development, and further development in SM-88. a lot of social media lift on this as well. GL we go up from here!!!!"
"We’ll, thank you for the $$,$$$ bosses"
$27 Million invested early by the Institutions means they are confident and so we should be
"Strap in bois, it’s TYME"
"Tomorrow’s Fat Payday Friyay is so green! My pumpernickel DavidNIO said #NIO will be $70 in 7 days! Have you seen him?Did you follow the money and bought #tyme at $1.05? You could be up 8% now, AND “someone” said it will be at least $5 bucks on January 21Still holding #itrm and #otlk? Hang in there, you’ll get your money’s back. You’re holding "

"New the TYME. Fresh from the TNXP disaster. Be mindful Patents are not as hard as you may think to get. The drug trial results are what makes Pharma stocks move. I still bought 1,000 shares at $1.63. I am comfortable there. But of you think this stock is breaking $2.00 today... The data and history just doesn't support that."
$2 Monday! $5 by the end of the month! last week to get in under $2! GL TYME Nation!!
"100 million float, I doubt there will be any halts."
GAP UP TO 2.50 IN AM

"Listen, we need TYME to be 3 digits… $120 meme guys capitalize this on the good news!"
Given solid financial condition ( CASH RUNWAY into into 2024 ) and this great news this stock should be trading around $500mm market cap !

crazy volume
"TYME Technologies is a new biotechnology company that develops “cancer metabolism-based therapies” or CMBTs. These treatments are designed to work across a wide range of diagnoses, solid tumors, hematologic cancers and more. The stock is trending higher after receiving patent notification for its metabolomic technology platform."
there's a ton of support at this 1.70 level. it's not done from here (today or long term). tho prly not reaching $2 again today.
"Search about cancer problem, then spread fud  due dd. Don’t just tailor BS"
"Interesting: Pfizer Inc., maker of a top-selling Covid vaccine, will buy all the shares of Trillium Therapeutics Inc. it doesn’t own, gaining the immune cancer drugmaker for an equity value of $2.26 billion.Things that make you say hmmm ?"
That is fantastic news. No doubt. That is what we needed. Hopefullygood things will continue.
it's amazing how all these predictions etc. now going to 6 etc. You don't know anything about how the market will react. If you did you would be on a yacht and not typing on a Yahoo finance chat line
Thumbs up if think closing in green...thumbs down red..What do you think?
Is anyone taking about this on Reddit? What’s the thread?
I give trying to explain to you people. I am still going to invest in them and know they will possibly cure some cancers.
WE HAVE A RUNAWAY TRAIN TO 2.50!!!
i hold for 10 years
This is huge news buy hold
"This stock to me is not about turning a profit. It is about fighting cancer. It sounds to me as though they are trying. All of you trying to short or pump amd dump, I have no words!"
"24 August has been set for our Annual Investors Meeting with proxy vote on critical matters. No reverse split, no buyout offer. We have been removed from the Russell 3000 evidently due to the wild swings around our offering sale of $100 Million. That occurred 18 June. Link to Russell delistings here:https://content.ftserussell.com/sites/default/files/ru3000_deletions_20210618.pdfThis is NOT that big of a deal. We are not tied to a full index rise or fall. ahhhh not much else to say.Our 1st Quarter earnings report are due AT ANY TIME. No earnings to speak of, it will be around our CASH BURN.Most of the noise here would be included within our proxy ballot which eligible shareholders have received.We have 5 active trials currently at https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=&term=sm-88&cntry=&state=&city=&dist=&number=Link.Have a great weekend all.'"
lets see 150% gain today. buy whike still cheap.
Wish I got this earlier... currently holding at 1.85 - dipping in and out of the red zone
Time to TYME short term of $2.00 long term of $3.50 by Jan
After 1pm will fly! Will see
"Ellen Degenerate and Chief Keef gonna make it hit at least $8,000/share in the next ten min"
thinking if this will have a few day run to go up to double digit.
HOLD AND BE REWARDED TOMORROW
What's everyone brought at?
SUPPORT TYME. IT MAY SAVE A FAMILY MEMBER OR A DEAR FRIEND.
It is only a matter of TYME! 
"A trader earns regardless of market fluctuations, I started investing using Brian Scott signals in June of last year, he shared his commercial techniques and helped me achieve my goals and now the profit rate is exponential. TeIegram> @Brianfxtrade"
I'm @1.45 
"I pray not one of you get cancer! However, if you do if you are betting against a company fighting against it, hmmm, this is not a pump and dump. Help this company beat cancer. I beg you.  I have seen too many pass with this and Irs not pretty. You will beg for research such as this if you are dying from it!"
Let's wait till earnings Burn the shorts
"The entire market is red, but this is green!"
"Let us have your prediction on what is likely to be the high print for TYME in the Sept. and Oct. (roughly two-month) interval. I will stick my neck out and predict a high of $1.29 (with a probability of 0.8), but will also note that $1.63 is likely (with a probability of 0.4). I have invested a substantial sum with these figures in mind."
Tyme fell through the first support level
"The last patent pushed the stock to 4.99 , today patent pushed it to 2 dollars, next patent will be 10 cents "
Last 15 mins 1.68+
TYME stock action suddenly came back into action in late Friday trading. The stock has been sliding steadily for a long time; so Friday's price action is most unusual. Maybe it foretells a major move in the coming week or two.
I bought this on Friday and just sold it. Will pick it up again when it goes back down.
"I have no idea when this builds to $2.00 + but i know for sure it should be trading above $2.00 now. Interest will increase the more investors learn about TYME. I also know I am long and strong here, keep buying at these prices TYME can be the small guys big win cause it is affordable and under priced right now but that will change soon and you will regret now owning this stock."
dont sell this will fly.
"GUYS, 3$+ EASY TODAY"
today is the just start .. its gonna fly and beat the last time highs of 5s in just matter of time
Today was a great day for the company. Period. We have the patent we needed for this company to get one step closer to a viable business. Just because the stock doesnt do what you want dont whine. Whine at the scared investor that gets pushed like a baby each time. Company is doing everything expected to succeed. Hoping for more good news in the coming days..
It goes down faster than the Titanic...
Platform model will be a huge hit. Looks at how MRNA has been able to transform themselves with the platform model. Opportunities are unlimited with AI !
"Again, thank you for the $$,$$$. Either your bosses are awesome or $2pid$. BOTH?"
Gonna just through $2
Closing above $3 call interest spiking
Tyme been around for 2015 i am long for this as biotech will only grow and this is where your $$$$$ should be parked if you want compound growth
"Haha over 100million in shorts, with .6 days left to cover. Oh yeah squeeze is on!"
GAP UP TO 2.50 TOMORROW!
"Been playing TYME for almost 2 years. Love the science. It could prove to be the Holy Grail of cancer therapy and since this metabolic approach applies to ALL solid tumor types (and maybe hematological as well, ultimately) if it proves efficacious this could be the biggest story in the history of cancer meds. Having said that, a dose of reality here; a US patent adds nothing to the likelihood of an FDA decision. USPTO only looks at the novel MOA and says it's ""different"". The science still has has to work to get FDA approval. With no FDA IND until mid to late 2022 this is dead money until early 2023. I'm selling here and will be buying back lower because or will be $1.20 or lower at some point in the next few months. The patent is only great once the science gets approved and others want to license it. Good luck all!"
One piece of advice for the Longs of TYME -- bring your kneepads and grease for Tues. activity!
game changer end of the year 
"Reminds me of an old wives tale, Buy the Rumor, Sell the News."
"This over-inflated pump-n-dump fell -32% in the final 3 hours .... outlook for Tues. -- PAIN, it's going lower!!!"
Its TYME to buy TYME. This is the bargain of a lifeTYME. Load up longs
was it halted?
Ready for another run somethings coming
Been here since the beginning. Definately not a good feeling. Hoping for the best.
"The volatility of this stock: ie: going from $1.10 to over $2.00 on relatively innocuous news just goes to show how ready this stock is to really blasting off. The slightest bit of positive clinical trial results / news and this stock is going off the charts..... Cant wait for the OASIS Breast Cancer Trials with Georgetown University to get started. In the initial studies of SM-88, there were encouraging tumor responses in the HR+/HER2- patients, including complete responses or complete resolution of their tumor. The OASIS trial is aimed to confirm this activity and possibly identify the next step in the development path in this setting for SM-88.Only a matter of TYME....... and believe me you will want to be onboard before blast off occurs ! GLTAL !!!!!!!!!!!"
"Look, they had a 40 million share direct placement at $2.50 a share. They raised $100 million that fully funds them through phase 3 trials. When this stock surges, past experience is that it explodes. Insider sales are a drop in the bucket. I think they are more a function of available income to insiders who know it will likely be a couple years before promising clinical trial data can lead to FDA approval and the company is able to turn a profit. Personally I consider the 2.50 per share to be a baseline below which I will likely never sell my shares. That means anyone buying here will likely see 100 percent return as a minimum. IMO, only a complete reversal of years of positive data in future late stage clinical studies could change this. I'll risk that unlikelihood and stay long TYME. The major flaw with the company is their extreme focus internally -- where insiders dominate -- and their tendency to share good news with each other but not with the public or their retail shareholders. Good communicators they are not."
"For Sesen Bio (Biotech company) - ticker SESN. It is NASDAQ company which dips below $ 1 right now. In the yahoo board discussion, someone post below message. ""Something all shareholders should be aware of is that NASDQ will soon send a warning to SESN about their sp. If management are not able to get the price above $2 their only recourse will be a reverse split. I have been involved in 2 small biotechs that this has occurred and from an investor perspective this is not beneficial.""What are the chances that we also fall for same issue here? Is it possible? If not, why not?Only serious feedback please.Thanks."
Patent news!!
"I am invested in TYME: long term as this is 5 years from showing any business growth. At this stretch of low price I wonder if they need a reverse split, especially to stay on NASDAQ."
Candlestick analysis indicate tyme will close around the 2.20 mark
ph gonna take this away
SHORTS ARE BASHING. THATS A GREAT SIGN AS TYME HEADS NORTH FROM HERE. LOOK FOR POP AS SHORTS START TO COVER THIER POSITIONS
"Big move here next week, all bullish indicators are coming together. Heavy shorts Friday coupled with $1call options volume should see 1.30 next week. GL"
after market 4.5$$tomrow open 7$$
Risk is there for any biotech company. The upside is massively huge. Just bought 1000 more @ 1.06 to average down. Rome was not built overnight. Patience will win.
Analyst price targets at $9
Ricky should have spent all his buying power smh
lets get this thing to 2million a share
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1WgtT62gzY
Let’s go to $3 today at least
There appears to be some opportunist institutional buying going on ! Decent sized blocks being acquired. Nice to see.... Hope some good news soon.
this will be 100$ stock within 2 years
JW Vulture Puke Spreak Engrish you Foo ! Phony boy JW the big institutional trader likes to spend his days mulling around on yahoo message boards with all the other institutional big-guns HAHAHA.......... He also needs to take a remedial Engrish crlass. So peoples understrand his messrages..... Time to put the useless Meathead Phony on ignore. Buh bye JW Phony Boy..... Think of us all here on this TYME Yahoo message board when you are riding your bicycle home this evening.
GAP UP TOMORROW MORNING ON GREAT NEWS ON CANCER PATENT. THIS WILL SAVE MANY LIVES. SUPPORT TYME.
I like what just happened …let’s do it again 
When TYME was trading today in the $1.80s I told you MOMO amateurs to sell ... cause TYME would continue to sell-off into the close and end the day in the $1.30s !!!! Where'd TYME close??? In the $1.30s
I was late I got it @ $1.84
cancer breakthrough is always good
hoping to see $3 today
"The only thing I hate more than this company is myself, for thinking I was buying on a run up and not at the peak like I apparently did."
Buy the dip
it's still so early 
"Thank you for the $$,$$$ cuz it’s Fat Payday Friyay. Where’s my pumpernickel FightingLeprechaun at? $2.50 in 7 days? #NIO $70 in 7 days"
"Based on what I read so far, it looks like Tyme is an innovator in the field of cancer treatment. I bought tens of thousands of shares this year because I believed they will come up with something outstanding like this. We all know though that innovators tend to struggle in the short-run because they will be ""drawing the map while walking in the forest"", but the payoff will be huge in the long-run."

"INFO ONLY. Questions submitted too late for Earnings call and considered a distraction if covered in Annual Meeting/ Proxie Vote Earnings Call.ANSWER FROM INVESTOR RELATIONS IN ALL CAPITAL LETTERS*****************************************For next Tuesday's Investors Meeting and Proxy Vote, I'm asking for clarification on several topics.Has our collaboration with LineaRX/APDN for molecular detection of invasive Circulating Tumor Cells (iCTCs) been replaced by our bio-marker collaboration with Evotec?CTCS WERE BEING EXAMINED IN PROSTATE CANCER MAINLY. HOWEVER, AS PART OF OUR STRATEGIC REVIEW, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT WE WERE NOT CURRENTLY GOING TO FOCUS ON PROSTATE, AND THAT WE NEEDED TO FOCUS ON BROADER MORE TRADITIONAL BIOMARKERS THAN JUST CTCS. WHILE THIS DOESN’T MEAN WE MIGHT NOT USE THEM IN THE FUTURE, CURRENTLY WE ARE FOCUED ON THE EFFORTS AT EVOTEC MAYO AND OTHER PLACE, AS WELL AS USING CIRCULATING TUMOR DNA IN OUR BREAST CANCER TRIAL THAT ALL THE KOLS SAID WAS A MORE VALIDATED BIOMARKER THERE.As of Evotec's own investors' meeting there is no mention of us within their meeting's video stream, or on pharma-partnerships.EVOTEC IS A SERVICE CORPORATION AND WORK WITH HUNDREDS OF COMPANIES, INCLUDE THE LARGEST PHARMA COMPANIES AND SMALL BIOTECHS LIKE OURSELVES. I DOUBT THEY WOULD LIST ALL OF THEIR CUSTOMERS. EVOTEC DOES HAVE AN INVESTMENT ARM WHERE THEY CAN INVEST IN COMPANIES OR SUPPORT RESEARCH. (A VERY SMALL PORTION OF THEIR ACTIVITIES.) I BELIEVE THAT IS THE LINK THAT YOU FORWARDED. THIS IS NOT THE TYPE OF RELATIONSHIP WE HAVE WITH EVOTEC CURRENTLY. NCT03512756 - TYME's self-sponsored clinical trial with some collaboration with LINeaRX and Eagle Pharma, from milestones graphic below updates are due now-> end of September (1H22). To summarize, data listed on the Clinical Trial site was Last Update Posted : June 21, 2021. In our collaboration with Eagle RX:Jan 7, 2020 Tyme Technologies and Eagle Pharmaceuticals Announce Strategic Collaboration///////OUR MILESTONE PAYMENT CAVEATS\\\\\\\\\\\\\In addition, TYME will receive a $20 million MILESTONE payment upon the successful completion of the first to occur of the following three events:(1) Achievement of the primary endpoint of overall survival in its TYME-88-Panc pivotal trial;.....or(2) Achievement of the primary endpoint of overall survival in the PanCAN Precision Promise? SM-88 registration arm;.....or(3) U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of SM-88 in any cancer.This payment would be split into a $10 million milestone cash payment and a $10 million investment in TYME at a 15% premium to the then prevailing market price. Eagle’s shares will be restricted from sale until the earlier of three months following the milestone event or the three-year anniversary of the agreement.THIS SEEMS CORRECT. SINCE THE 3RD LINE TRIAL OF PANCREATIC IS BEING SHUT DOWN, (NCT03512756) THE REMAINING EVENTS WOULD BE THE ONES TO FOCUS ON. FOR PANCAN YOU SHOULD NOTE THE EVENT IS THE PRIMARY ENDPOINT AT THE END OF THE TRIAL. THIS WOULD BE BASED ON SURVIVAL RESULTS FROM ~175 PATIENTS TREATED WITH SM-88. PRIOR TO THAT “FINAL” DATA, THERE IS A “GRADUATION” FROM THE PHASE 2 PORTION OF THE TRIAL ~100 PATIENTS, TO THE CONFIRMATORY PHASE 3 PORTION ~75 ADDITIONAL PATIENTS. WHILE WE BELIEVE IT WOULD BE ENCOURAGING THAT SM-88 GRADUATES TO THIS “CONFIRMATORY” PORTION (MAINLY BECAUSE THERE WOULD APPEAR A BENEFIT THAT NEEDS CONFIRMING), THIS GRADUATION WOULD NOT TRIGGER THE MILESTONE. AS PRECISION PROMISE COME OUT OF THE PANDEMIC, OPENS UP ITS ADDITIONAL SITES, WE MIGHT HAVE A BETTER IDEA OF WHEN THESE EVENTS COULD OCCUR, BUT TO BE CLEAR- WE ARE BLIND TO THE EXACT ENROLLMENT OF OUR ARM AND THESE ARE BASED ON OUR ESTIMATES OF SOME OVERALL ENROLLMENT AND OTHER ITEMS THAT WE USE TO TRIANGLATE THE POTENTIAL STATUS OF OUR ARM. Hoping the trial status and working collaborations be fully discussed. If our therapeutics (i.e. SM-88, SM-18, et al) are now being manufactured by EVOTEC, please expound. Updates on our working agreements with EAGLE and LinEARX also requested. WE CAN’T REALLY SAY MUCH MORE ON PARTNERSHIPS THAN WHAT IS IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN. EVOTEC – WE HAVE SAID WE HAVE STARTED WORK WITH. LINEARX WAS MAINLY A TRIAL THAT IS NOW COMPLETE OR STOPPED. EAGLE, THE ONLY THING WE CAN REALLY SAY IS THAT THIS WAS MORE OF A COMMERCIAL AGREEMENT, SO ACTIVITIES WOULD NOT REALLY HAPPEN UNTIL CLOSER TO COMMERCIALIZATION. OTHER THAN THAT, YOU CAN LOOK AT THEIR HOLDINGS AND SEE IF THEY HAVE SOLD SHARES (I DON’T BELIEVE THEY HAVE.) Also from the milestone schedule:NCT04720664-OASIS_Breast_Cancer, Last Update Posted : May 27, 2021, from the graphic: First Patient Enrolled 3Q21 (Oct -Dec 2020) is well passed.We are currently nearing the end of 1H22. Reporting on our current NCT03778996 - Joseph Ahmed Foundation trial."
See you in 10
The moving averages do not justify this price. Sell on the next pump if their is one. Remember this is only a patent. This is far from a trial result. These Pharma stocks will turn you into a bag holder.
here we go!
"Well, have to admit these guys really stretch the envelope when it comes to being communicatingly challenged. That was probably the most boring and unenlightening conference calls I've ever heard. They certainly checked the block on every cliche imaginable. ""We're expediting our actions to react quickly . . ."". Really? I got absolutely nothing out of it. They literally could have called that one in. Oh wait that's what they did. The highlight was coming in withe the entire CC under 20 minutes, the lone substitute covering analyst question notwithstanding. The good news is that they are somehow able to convince folks like us to pony up 100 million dollars at $2.50 a pop in support of what they're doing. but I wish they would act a little more thrill about what they're doing than what we're doing, at least during a conference call. Still long here, but totally unimpressed with Richie and the Fonz, et al, and their communication skills."
"The message here is exactly what you should have expected if you've been listening the last few months to the updates. While there is no bad news there's also an absence of any good news as well. This is dead money for at least the next 12 months. How could you have expected anything more? But with that said, this could end up be the best story in the history of cancer therapy. Since they have funding thru the end of this process there is very little downside risk to playing a stock that has such huge upside."
Exciting Company here. With current patents and R and D this puppy is about a year or so away from real success but its the early birds that make the biggest gains. This should be trading in the $3.00 to $4.00 range by year end. Good luck all

"The potential here alone should put TYME @ $500mm Market Cap ! Over $100mm in cash, multiple late stage trials in the works, Entering the Breast Cancer market place...... WE ARE GOING MUCH HIGHER $2.50 PLUS in the short terms !!!!!!!!!"
This will also help for a buyout in the future.
"Another gem in the making here. If you missed the run up over at #CNSP #ITRM and most recently #OTLK#NIO tribe, have you seen my pumpernickel DavidNIO? Can someone contact him on WhatsApp. He has made more millionaires compared to crypto scammers lurking everywhere. We need 3X here at least!*This is for entertainment purposes only. Do not copy me. But you can certainly Follow the Money otherwise YOMO"
"17M Pre market we will buy all the way to $2.50 today ""Mark my Word"""
Looks like I'm bag holding this #$%$ forever.
"Does Tyme partner with drug companies that they are testing their products/ delivery system with? Seems those companies should be contributing to the testing as they benefit. Very long term bullish, short term yawn."
Merger merger 
200% today!!!!
I think she will come back...nicely to 2...may be
"Got a good perspective piece over on Seeking Alpha published yesterday.Tyme Technologies: The Market Missed The Bullish MemoCovers everything we've gone over here. Despite the brilliance here, Seeking Alpha gets a broader reading audience. GLTUA"
Trying to average down but have to wait for two days to settle my stock sale. Ahhhhhhhhh next week I’m averaging down.
What to buy in at?
Getting tougher to remain optimistic on this one; down 60% over the last 6 months..down to $1 today.
$NRXP is running on good news
tyler fr one more comment and ill pluck your ip
"On average, Wall Street analysts predict that Tyme Technologies's share price could stay at $9.50 by Nov 13, 2021. The average Tyme Technologies stock price prediction forecasts a potential downside of N/A from the current TYME share price of $1.22."
This is the action tyme gets after a virtual healthcare conference presentation??
this is such a disappointment
"Been saying this all day. These Small Cap Pharma companies do not shoot the moon because of a patent. Contrary to belief Patents are not hard to get. The trials are what will move this stock. You will end up holding if you don't get out when you can. Look at what IGC did last week. They got a patent approved, it pumped, and has been dumping since... Leaving Bag Holders in its wake. Be wary of these people who are saying things like ""rockets and shooting the moon"" and offer no evidence to back it up. The moving averages have this stock at $1.55 - $1.63."
Folks not looking good my position is so red. I hope it goes up again
barcode... why?
"Well nuts,Today's telecon/10Q kind of an abbreviated rehash. Not close to expansion of programs I was hoping for.It did shed light on our collaboration with EVOTECH, largely a European bio tech, and use of biomarkers vs. PET scans (e.g. Invasive Circulating Tumor Cells (iCTCs) ) in monitoring clinical effect of therapies.With my first notice of EVOTECH collaboration.Question arises on whether our SM-88 may be in used over in European Clinical Trials, coincidentally, EVOTECH is having their own investor meeting tomorrow:On to 24 August, proxy vote and telecon. No change to ballot announced today. Was hoping for addition of voting on buyout offer. AHHHH, not happening.GLTUA"
"This company found an amino acid specific to cancer and can target it? I just don’t know why everyone is not supporting this company. I know they are small, but I will. Their treatment is non intrusive? I guess none of you no anyone that has cancer?"
This stock double then dropped 50% so we are back to $1.
Do technical analysis 
Look at SAVA and read some of the rueful posts of those who made a profit but sold way too soon after the first surge in SP. It's a useful lesson.
I am loving this Monday and much love  to $TYME
Hold on boys .. we're launching
I dont understand why this keeps going down?
"Read the stories about SAVA. There are apples to apples comparison of a stock, a biotech stock, began at a couple of bucks share price a year ago surged suddenly to around $9. Many sold had a nice profit and now today rue that decision. SAVA it's on the verge of making medical history with its product to combat alheimérz. So. it's currently a $135 stocks many think will run to $900 a share when it's done. Let that be a lesson for those of us here at TYME. I've never heard the SM-88 approach doesn't work against a variety of cancers. Proving it takes time. But when it happens the share price will explode. You won't be able to react fast enough if you're not already in it and that is the risk."
"Where’s my pumpernickel Irish who thinks his bosses know better than JW?As always, thank you for the $$,$$$, bosses! Just in case you didn’t know JW, *this is for entertainment purposes only. Do not copy me. But you can always Follow the Money"
1.20 today
"TYME presently has $180mm Market Cap priced at $1.05 per share.It also has $101mm in Cash & Investments So.... TYME's Intellectual Technology, a first-in-class CMBT compound which to date, clinical trial data has shown that SM-88 has achieved confirmed tumor responses across 15 different cancers, both solid and liquid tumors, including pancreatic, lung, breast, prostate, sarcoma and lymphoma cancers with minimal drug-related serious Grade 3 or higher adverse events... SO it's potential is presently valued at less the $70mm ?and That valuation doesn't even take into consideration TM-18, TM-19 nor the value of the pending clinical trials that are presently underway.... northe working relationships with Eagle Pharma, The Mayo Clinic, NYU Langone Health, The Pancreatic Cancer Action Network, The Joseph Ahmed Foundation, Georgetown University etc........Take a look at the people sitting on TYME's Scientific Advisory Committee ! even mebers of the Board of Directors Beyond impressive.This stock is so undervalued. I just convinced myself to buy more share again at these prices ! GLTAL ! Truly only a matter of TYME !"
Soon 200 million in volume
Headed under $1.00 again!!
I know this is a long way off but I will keep a small position in support of their efforts...I hope they make some progress and are able to help people beat various types of tumors with less invasive treatment!
Here we go!! Cancer patent is so solid news.
it has boken 1.78 last high befor fall
"This should not surprise anyone! Nothing positive is going to happen until Tyme has some meaningful positive and documented success and is able to share and confirm same, everyone get over the disappointing action of this stock as nothing is going to change for a long time and just be prepared to hang out between .85 and 1.30. I know is boring and frustrating but it takes real results to make it go up and that is not happening anytime soon. Best you can hope for most likely is something good in the first quarter of 2022. Those are my thoughts and I have almost quit watching it period and certainly so have others and the POST are far and very few between."
"Hi,I am looking into TYME and I like their approach. Can you please help me to identify next catalyst? When do you expect it to take place?"
I am not a big fan of Andy Marsh sell every two weeks. Is he that broke? Take some pride in your own stock and let it grow.
"Insider buy, finally, Van Tornout Jan M, a whopping 1K shares for $1.05 registered on EDGAR near close. Probably kept us above a $buck."
Big boom tmrw morning. Look where they were in Feb.
Volume dried up. Guess im stuck waiting it out 
"Yahoo's killing post holding a link to this article:Do Institutions Own Tyme Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:TYME) Shares.Yahoo FinanceThat should get you there using it as a search of. Nice overview of Outstanding Share (O/S) ownership. Distribution.Just a general coverage. Interesting insight. Retail holders are a slight majority.Nice things to know.GLTA"
I've said this before: The only difference between the sinking of the Titanic and the sinking of Tyme stock is that the band was playing when the Titanic went down.
"Only bought a measly 100 shares. If it goes up, I'll make money, otherwise meh"
Looks like no one was impressed with the conference call.
"While delivering the unusable tyrosine, which is the basis of the metabolic attack on the cancer cell, they can also bring other drugs to that cancer cell in a highly targeted manner.Since tymes cocktail has basically no harmful side effects, this opens the door to a lot of possibilities.Wow."
Let's see 9$ boys
2.5 price target for today!!!
Lets get our profits by spring 2022 Price target is 1year not by end of year
Patent is patent. 
If anyone understands the mechanism of sm-88 what this patent allows is the attachment of a chemotherapy that will only be released inside of cancer cells. It will reduce the toxicity to non cancerous cells.
"This should biopharma has just left a conference picking up 3 more analysts. Their reports should push this up fast, and without warning. too much cash on hand vs free cash flow. one day this will jump 100%-300% almost over night, or over a weekend. The institutional investment here knows when they try to kick up the SP that retail investors short, or take profit. If the investors that are on this thread would stop selling, and shorting on small spikes every TYME, we would see continued growth."
They're scaring the weak hands to buy their cheap sharesBEWARE!
Nice support low risk area
will this run to 3$
I am in. Thanks!
round 2
why the drop ?
Back in 45k shares at 1.25Gl
Just cannot seem to hold on to it’s climb to success. Profit takers prevent the stock from going higher. Hopefully one of these days the positive news will be to good to sell and maybe we make it to $2.50 and higher.
Can you TYME buying $TYME?
HA! At least we know have a little room from THE double digits............. just a little. We need some good news....
Buy..buy.. only 100% markup..great deal
it should hit $5 by tomorrow! good luck
