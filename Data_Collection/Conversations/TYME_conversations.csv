why are insiders selling??? Steve Hoffman- 156250 shares... what's going on?
"When the company finds a less harmful and revolutionary cure for cancer, the stock will go over $ 100. now we just have to wait"
I am not a big fan of Andy Marsh sell every two weeks. Is he that broke? Take some pride in your own stock and let it grow.
"TYME IR response to questions on our Sarcoma trial. Info only:********************************Hello Mike,Lisa might have responded, but it is not really accurate that there have been no updates on this.In June we presented interim data from this trial at ASCO (link).Also in June, as part of our strategic overview, we highlighted this as an area of continued focus for us. I believe we said the trial had enrolled 16 of the 24 patients, and we guided for completion of enrollment by 1H next year. (link) Given that sarcoma is a pretty rare cancer, and this trial is really out of the one site, the enrollment is not bad. This site normally has patients travel from across the US, but this was obviously reduced during COVID. Based on what we know today, we believe our guidance for completing enrollment is achievable.I hope this helpsJon"

"Again, thank you for the $$,$$$. Either your bosses are awesome or $2pid$. BOTH?"
TYME shooting up on high volume in the last few minutes. Hope something good is in the wings!
I believe our pumpernickel is celebrating now?
Uhhhhh.... Duhhhhh....
TYME stock action suddenly came back into action in late Friday trading. The stock has been sliding steadily for a long time; so Friday's price action is most unusual. Maybe it foretells a major move in the coming week or two.
Where’s my pumpernickel FightingLeprechaun at? He said this “stock price will pop any moment now!”?
$2 Monday! $5 by the end of the month! last week to get in under $2! GL TYME Nation!!
Up 2.5 pennies.... Oh boy... Old Vulture Cap Boy must be at it again ! Hahaha.........
"2021-9-23; 5 PM EST. Something big happening with TYME. It is up 4 cents after hours on exceedingly high volume of 381,000 shares. Note that it only traded about 655,000 shares all day. Does anyone have relevant news?"
"Monday November 8th, Press conference"
"Monday is up swing on the trade. Tuesday news: milestone payments, partnership agreements with evotech Europe. Coupled with the patent development, and further development in SM-88. a lot of social media lift on this as well. GL we go up from here!!!!"
"Well nuts,Today's telecon/10Q kind of an abbreviated rehash. Not close to expansion of programs I was hoping for.It did shed light on our collaboration with EVOTECH, largely a European bio tech, and use of biomarkers vs. PET scans (e.g. Invasive Circulating Tumor Cells (iCTCs) ) in monitoring clinical effect of therapies.With my first notice of EVOTECH collaboration.Question arises on whether our SM-88 may be in used over in European Clinical Trials, coincidentally, EVOTECH is having their own investor meeting tomorrow:On to 24 August, proxy vote and telecon. No change to ballot announced today. Was hoping for addition of voting on buyout offer. AHHHH, not happening.GLTUA"
"I have no idea when this builds to $2.00 + but i know for sure it should be trading above $2.00 now. Interest will increase the more investors learn about TYME. I also know I am long and strong here, keep buying at these prices TYME can be the small guys big win cause it is affordable and under priced right now but that will change soon and you will regret now owning this stock."
JW Vulture Puke Spreak Engrish you Foo ! Phony boy JW the big institutional trader likes to spend his days mulling around on yahoo message boards with all the other institutional big-guns HAHAHA.......... He also needs to take a remedial Engrish crlass. So peoples understrand his messrages..... Time to put the useless Meathead Phony on ignore. Buh bye JW Phony Boy..... Think of us all here on this TYME Yahoo message board when you are riding your bicycle home this evening.
Nice pre-market. Sarcoma data updates due by 30 Sept. Short holdings have half-day to cover:).GLTUA

Looks like no one was impressed with the conference call.
"The message here is exactly what you should have expected if you've been listening the last few months to the updates. While there is no bad news there's also an absence of any good news as well. This is dead money for at least the next 12 months. How could you have expected anything more? But with that said, this could end up be the best story in the history of cancer therapy. Since they have funding thru the end of this process there is very little downside risk to playing a stock that has such huge upside."
Big news coming in September price target 9.50 end of year let’s goooo
TOMMY: You could certainly be right but at any moment news could strike and this stock price will POP. Do not think Richie C. is just sitting on his hands waiting for clinical trial data to arrive !
"Sold $1.14, time to load up here soon. Thanks for the $$$. Round trip # 3 or go long?"
"We’ll, thank you for the $$,$$$ bosses"
What is making it go back up ?
Nice little bump on solid volume.... Market Cap should be somewhere closer to $350mm - $400mm. Come on Richie share some good news !!! Any interesting collaborations in the works ????
"HELLO............. Richie Cunningham, what is going on over there behind closed doors in NJ. How about an update of some of the progress you are making with your new initiatives ? Any potential new collaborative agreements in the works ? What else are you guys doing other than sitting back and waiting for feedback from your CMO's ? Your shareholders are hungry for news / an update ! Come on Richie it's past dinner time !"
Trying to average down but have to wait for two days to settle my stock sale. Ahhhhhhhhh next week I’m averaging down.
Not worried here at all. As usual NO NEGATIVE NEWS. Very light volume. May pick up some more at this price point. Current avg share price in the mid $1.20 range. Think I will. Not a doubt in my mind this will bounce back again. Just need that little kicker of GOOD NEWS from Richie Cunningham to bounce this into the $2.00 range and get this off the garage floor ! :-) Come on Richie whatcha say.... give us little guys a little love !
Its a yoyo
Risk is there for any biotech company. The upside is massively huge. Just bought 1000 more @ 1.06 to average down. Rome was not built overnight. Patience will win.

"The only thing I hate more than this company is myself, for thinking I was buying on a run up and not at the peak like I apparently did."
"This should not surprise anyone! Nothing positive is going to happen until Tyme has some meaningful positive and documented success and is able to share and confirm same, everyone get over the disappointing action of this stock as nothing is going to change for a long time and just be prepared to hang out between .85 and 1.30. I know is boring and frustrating but it takes real results to make it go up and that is not happening anytime soon. Best you can hope for most likely is something good in the first quarter of 2022. Those are my thoughts and I have almost quit watching it period and certainly so have others and the POST are far and very few between."
It is only a matter of TYME! 
Lets get our profits by spring 2022 Price target is 1year not by end of year
"Yesterday I posted this ""Doing research on $tyme over the weekend I found something VERY INTERESTING.TYME's new CEO ""Mr. Cunningham also brings significant experience in mergers & acquisitions, business development, strategy development, therapeutic launches, contracting, managed care, and sales & marketing. Most recently, Richie served as CEO at Icagen, leading the company through two transformational acquisitions, acquiring assets and talent out of Pfizer and Sanofi. While CEO at Icagen, he successfully negotiated and signed multiple licensing deals with Roche, Sanofi and the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation""What I want you to pay attention to is the very first part, Mergers and acquisitions, their cash burn rate is so low so why do an 100 million dollar offer? Could we be looking at a possible merger or acquisition? Is that why the offer was for so much money? Their cash burn rate last year was about 20 million for the year so not why do a 20 million offer or 25 something like that? We have seen mergers with other small biotechs like OBLN and JAGX that worked out very well. Could we be looking at something huge here?? Just throwing some ideas out there, anyone else have opinions on this?""And then today in the closed offering article it says""TYME may also use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire or invest in businesses, products and technologies that are complementary to its own, although it has no current plans, commitments or agreements with respect to any acquisitions as of the date of this communication.""VERY INTERESTING, COINCIDENCE?????"
Our pumpernickel DavidNIO has been gone for almost 2 years now mates. He move to #tyme and changed his name and picture to a girl FightingIrishTYME. She’ll make us monies daily. I wonder what her prediction is for TYME IN 7 DAYS? where’s my pumpernickel DavidNIO at
"Got a good perspective piece over on Seeking Alpha published yesterday.Tyme Technologies: The Market Missed The Bullish MemoCovers everything we've gone over here. Despite the brilliance here, Seeking Alpha gets a broader reading audience. GLTUA"
soooo any news to talk about?share with the team buyers please
"Interesting: Pfizer Inc., maker of a top-selling Covid vaccine, will buy all the shares of Trillium Therapeutics Inc. it doesn’t own, gaining the immune cancer drugmaker for an equity value of $2.26 billion.Things that make you say hmmm ?"
Who’s driving this rocket ??
"This should biopharma has just left a conference picking up 3 more analysts. Their reports should push this up fast, and without warning. too much cash on hand vs free cash flow. one day this will jump 100%-300% almost over night, or over a weekend. The institutional investment here knows when they try to kick up the SP that retail investors short, or take profit. If the investors that are on this thread would stop selling, and shorting on small spikes every TYME, we would see continued growth."
"Let us have your prediction on what is likely to be the high print for TYME in the Sept. and Oct. (roughly two-month) interval. I will stick my neck out and predict a high of $1.29 (with a probability of 0.8), but will also note that $1.63 is likely (with a probability of 0.4). I have invested a substantial sum with these figures in mind."
"Insider buy, finally, Van Tornout Jan M, a whopping 1K shares for $1.05 registered on EDGAR near close. Probably kept us above a $buck."
today is Tyme Day
"TYME presently has $180mm Market Cap priced at $1.05 per share.It also has $101mm in Cash & Investments So.... TYME's Intellectual Technology, a first-in-class CMBT compound which to date, clinical trial data has shown that SM-88 has achieved confirmed tumor responses across 15 different cancers, both solid and liquid tumors, including pancreatic, lung, breast, prostate, sarcoma and lymphoma cancers with minimal drug-related serious Grade 3 or higher adverse events... SO it's potential is presently valued at less the $70mm ?and That valuation doesn't even take into consideration TM-18, TM-19 nor the value of the pending clinical trials that are presently underway.... northe working relationships with Eagle Pharma, The Mayo Clinic, NYU Langone Health, The Pancreatic Cancer Action Network, The Joseph Ahmed Foundation, Georgetown University etc........Take a look at the people sitting on TYME's Scientific Advisory Committee ! even mebers of the Board of Directors Beyond impressive.This stock is so undervalued. I just convinced myself to buy more share again at these prices ! GLTAL ! Truly only a matter of TYME !"
game changer end of the year 
"Hi,I am looking into TYME and I like their approach. Can you please help me to identify next catalyst? When do you expect it to take place?"

Nice overview of Outstanding Share (O/S) ownership. Distribution.Just a general coverage. Interesting insight. Retail holders are a slight majority.Nice things to know.GLTA"
"Until we get some really good news TYME is going no where and as I have said before. will hang between .85 and 1.20 so just stay calm and do not get so excited over these small premature pops as we have a good while( probably 2022) before we even scare the $2 and $4 marks people are talking about. It stinks but it is reality so ""stay cool, calm and collect"" and wait for 2022."
"Well, have to admit these guys really stretch the envelope when it comes to being communicatingly challenged. That was probably the most boring and unenlightening conference calls I've ever heard. They certainly checked the block on every cliche imaginable. ""We're expediting our actions to react quickly . . ."". Really? I got absolutely nothing out of it. They literally could have called that one in. Oh wait that's what they did. The highlight was coming in withe the entire CC under 20 minutes, the lone substitute covering analyst question notwithstanding. The good news is that they are somehow able to convince folks like us to pony up 100 million dollars at $2.50 a pop in support of what they're doing. but I wish they would act a little more thrill about what they're doing than what we're doing, at least during a conference call. Still long here, but totally unimpressed with Richie and the Fonz, et al, and their communication skills."
This is going to take 8 months before we see 4-5 dollars barring some fda approval. I’m waiting but damn I would love the triple up. Big potential just need to hold. Willing to hold for 2 years to make 10x good fundamentals good path higher financing
"Hello Mike and the rest of this board, Look at RFL this morning, another cancer metabolism based therapy failed in 2 trials, one pancreatic and AML. The stock is down 75% today to $7 but it had been at $50 several weeks ago. They got no pipeline left. This is the second cancer metabolism approach that's failed. CALA failed in theirs last year. What does it mean for TYME?? Either TYME will own this space all to themselves if their different MOA shows efficacy OR they go the same way as CALA and RFL because cancer metabolism just isn't the answer. This is either a massive home run for us or it goes to zero. There's no in-between here. I've was not in CALA or RFL. I always believed the TYME MOA (as did Mike) was more logical and a more multi-faceted approach than the others but we'll see over the new few months. Good luck longs!!!"

"Does Tyme partner with drug companies that they are testing their products/ delivery system with? Seems those companies should be contributing to the testing as they benefit. Very long term bullish, short term yawn."

"INFO ONLY. Questions submitted too late for Earnings call and considered a distraction if covered in Annual Meeting/ Proxie Vote Earnings Call.ANSWER FROM INVESTOR RELATIONS IN ALL CAPITAL LETTERS*****************************************For next Tuesday's Investors Meeting and Proxy Vote, I'm asking for clarification on several topics.Has our collaboration with LineaRX/APDN for molecular detection of invasive Circulating Tumor Cells (iCTCs) been replaced by our bio-marker collaboration with Evotec?CTCS WERE BEING EXAMINED IN PROSTATE CANCER MAINLY. HOWEVER, AS PART OF OUR STRATEGIC REVIEW, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT WE WERE NOT CURRENTLY GOING TO FOCUS ON PROSTATE, AND THAT WE NEEDED TO FOCUS ON BROADER MORE TRADITIONAL BIOMARKERS THAN JUST CTCS. WHILE THIS DOESN’T MEAN WE MIGHT NOT USE THEM IN THE FUTURE, CURRENTLY WE ARE FOCUED ON THE EFFORTS AT EVOTEC MAYO AND OTHER PLACE, AS WELL AS USING CIRCULATING TUMOR DNA IN OUR BREAST CANCER TRIAL THAT ALL THE KOLS SAID WAS A MORE VALIDATED BIOMARKER THERE.As of Evotec's own investors' meeting there is no mention of us within their meeting's video stream, or on pharma-partnerships.EVOTEC IS A SERVICE CORPORATION AND WORK WITH HUNDREDS OF COMPANIES, INCLUDE THE LARGEST PHARMA COMPANIES AND SMALL BIOTECHS LIKE OURSELVES. I DOUBT THEY WOULD LIST ALL OF THEIR CUSTOMERS. EVOTEC DOES HAVE AN INVESTMENT ARM WHERE THEY CAN INVEST IN COMPANIES OR SUPPORT RESEARCH. (A VERY SMALL PORTION OF THEIR ACTIVITIES.) I BELIEVE THAT IS THE LINK THAT YOU FORWARDED. THIS IS NOT THE TYPE OF RELATIONSHIP WE HAVE WITH EVOTEC CURRENTLY. NCT03512756 - TYME's self-sponsored clinical trial with some collaboration with LINeaRX and Eagle Pharma, from milestones graphic below updates are due now-> end of September (1H22). To summarize, data listed on the Clinical Trial site was Last Update Posted : June 21, 2021.

Eagle’s shares will be restricted from sale until the earlier of three months following the milestone event or the three-year anniversary of the agreement.THIS SEEMS CORRECT. SINCE THE 3RD LINE TRIAL OF PANCREATIC IS BEING SHUT DOWN, (NCT03512756) THE REMAINING EVENTS WOULD BE THE ONES TO FOCUS ON. FOR PANCAN YOU SHOULD NOTE THE EVENT IS THE PRIMARY ENDPOINT AT THE END OF THE TRIAL. THIS WOULD BE BASED ON SURVIVAL RESULTS FROM ~175 PATIENTS TREATED WITH SM-88. PRIOR TO THAT “FINAL” DATA, THERE IS A “GRADUATION” FROM THE PHASE 2 PORTION OF THE TRIAL ~100 PATIENTS, TO THE CONFIRMATORY PHASE 3 PORTION ~75 ADDITIONAL PATIENTS. WHILE WE BELIEVE IT WOULD BE ENCOURAGING THAT SM-88 GRADUATES TO THIS “CONFIRMATORY” PORTION (MAINLY BECAUSE THERE WOULD APPEAR A BENEFIT THAT NEEDS CONFIRMING), THIS GRADUATION WOULD NOT TRIGGER THE MILESTONE. AS PRECISION PROMISE COME OUT OF THE PANDEMIC, OPENS UP ITS ADDITIONAL SITES, WE MIGHT HAVE A BETTER IDEA OF WHEN THESE EVENTS COULD OCCUR, BUT TO BE CLEAR- WE ARE BLIND TO THE EXACT ENROLLMENT OF OUR ARM AND THESE ARE BASED ON OUR ESTIMATES OF SOME OVERALL ENROLLMENT AND OTHER ITEMS THAT WE USE TO TRIANGLATE THE POTENTIAL STATUS OF OUR ARM. Hoping the trial status and working collaborations be fully discussed. If our therapeutics (i.e. SM-88, SM-18, et al) are now being manufactured by EVOTEC, please expound. Updates on our working agreements with EAGLE and LinEARX also requested. WE CAN’T REALLY SAY MUCH MORE ON PARTNERSHIPS THAN WHAT IS IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN. EVOTEC – WE HAVE SAID WE HAVE STARTED WORK WITH. LINEARX WAS MAINLY A TRIAL THAT IS NOW COMPLETE OR STOPPED. EAGLE, THE ONLY THING WE CAN REALLY SAY IS THAT THIS WAS MORE OF A COMMERCIAL AGREEMENT, SO ACTIVITIES WOULD NOT REALLY HAPPEN UNTIL CLOSER TO COMMERCIALIZATION. OTHER THAN THAT, YOU CAN LOOK AT THEIR HOLDINGS AND SEE IF THEY HAVE SOLD SHARES (I DON’T BELIEVE THEY HAVE.) Also from the milestone schedule:NCT04720664-OASIS_Breast_Cancer, Last Update Posted : May 27, 2021, from the graphic: First Patient Enrolled 3Q21 (Oct -Dec 2020) is well passed.We are currently nearing the end of 1H22.

It will be a nice day when TYME hits 4.00 very soon. Do your on DD. Just my opinion.
"Thinking there's a plan. Tyme insider David Carberry broke the string of 5 days below a buck back in September.

At least it is consistant. Looks like we have a $1 stock until there is some positive results and/or news.
Getting tougher to remain optimistic on this one; down 60% over the last 6 months..down to $1 today.
There appears to be some opportunist institutional buying going on ! Decent sized blocks being acquired. Nice to see.... Hope some good news soon.
"Sold high cost at $1.14; plenty of time to play with this until Nov, then go long for the result release in late Dec / Jan."

"Do not think anyone posting on this board has ever mentioned the Tangible Book Value of this Company is $1.72 which is usually considered positive from the standpoint that the stock is trading a good bit below it's book value. In simple terms, it is trading at a value .72+ less than what the book value per share is at $1.72. The current stock price is obviously undervalued at the current trading prices."
I should have sold at $2 last week
I can’t wait for the squeeze
What’s with the AH spike?
sad. Not going anywhere for a long time

Awesome news today. The new era has begun. It's GO TYME !
