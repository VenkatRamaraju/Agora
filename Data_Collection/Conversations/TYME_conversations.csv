"@Njeri according to my lifelong best friend dontbeagullibledumbfuq the price should actually hit 10,000 by close today so buy more"
Bullish here going forward...take a look also ATNM
All in ! I will hold overnight.
"The last run didn't even create a new support level. Right back to where we were. I got in a 1.17 last run and out a 1.60. I am putting my spare change into Tyme when it drops below $1.00. She likes to run on news, but can't hold its value."
Big news coming in September price target 9.50 end of year let’s goooo
"Yesterday I posted this ""Doing research on $tyme over the weekend I found something VERY INTERESTING.TYME's new CEO ""Mr. Cunningham also brings significant experience in mergers & acquisitions, business development, strategy development, therapeutic launches, contracting, managed care, and sales & marketing. Most recently, Richie served as CEO at Icagen, leading the company through two transformational acquisitions, acquiring assets and talent out of Pfizer and Sanofi. While CEO at Icagen, he successfully negotiated and signed multiple licensing deals with Roche, Sanofi and the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation""What I want you to pay attention to is the very first part, Mergers and acquisitions, their cash burn rate is so low so why do an 100 million dollar offer? Could we be looking at a possible merger or acquisition? Is that why the offer was for so much money? Their cash burn rate last year was about 20 million for the year so not why do a 20 million offer or 25 something like that? We have seen mergers with other small biotechs like OBLN and JAGX that worked out very well. Could we be looking at something huge here?? Just throwing some ideas out there, anyone else have opinions on this?""And then today in the closed offering article it says""TYME may also use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire or invest in businesses, products and technologies that are complementary to its own, although it has no current plans, commitments or agreements with respect to any acquisitions as of the date of this communication.""VERY INTERESTING, COINCIDENCE?????"
"Got a good perspective piece over on Seeking Alpha published yesterday.Tyme Technologies: The Market Missed The Bullish MemoCovers everything we've gone over here. Despite the brilliance here, Seeking Alpha gets a broader reading audience. GLTUA"
Acquisition target.
"More insiders filing to buy in. $2 January calls siting at .20 seems like an easy 200%-300% grab next 2 weeks, with a catch net catalyst coming in November. Dont see how this play isnt just easy money. I picked up 20 contracts today. Thoughts?"
What's everyone brought at?
barcode... why?
will this run to 3$
"TYME IR response to questions on our Sarcoma trial. Info only:********************************Hello Mike,Lisa might have responded, but it is not really accurate that there have been no updates on this.In June we presented interim data from this trial at ASCO (link).Also in June, as part of our strategic overview, we highlighted this as an area of continued focus for us. I believe we said the trial had enrolled 16 of the 24 patients, and we guided for completion of enrollment by 1H next year. (link) Given that sarcoma is a pretty rare cancer, and this trial is really out of the one site, the enrollment is not bad. This site normally has patients travel from across the US, but this was obviously reduced during COVID. Based on what we know today, we believe our guidance for completing enrollment is achievable.I hope this helpsJon"
"One week now till proxy vote/annual investors' meeting. Several very promising projects/trials are due NOW out to end of September for 1st Half of 2022 MILESTONES (FYI, Fiscal Year 2022, from April 1st 2021-March 31st 2022).My questions to Investor Relations Rep I'd like to have covered. May raise some questions of your own:For next Tuesday's Investors Meeting and Proxy Vote, I'm asking for clarification on several topics.Has our collaboration with LineaRX/APDN for molecular detection of invasive Circulating Tumor Cells (iCTCs) been replaced by our bio-marker collaboration with Evotec?As of Evotec's own investors' meeting there is no mention of us within their meeting's video stream, or on their presentation @https://www.evotec.com/en/innovate/pharma-partnerships.NCT03512756 - TYME's self-sponsored clinical trial with some collaboration with LINeaRX and Eagle Pharma, from milestones graphic below updates are due now-> end of September (1H22). To summarize, data listed on the Clinical Trial site was Last Update Posted : June 21, 2021. In our collaboration with Eagle RX:Jan 7, 2020 Tyme Technologies and Eagle Pharmaceuticals Announce Strategic Collaboration///////OUR MILESTONE PAYMENT CAVEATS\\\\\\\\\\\\\In addition, TYME will receive a $20 million MILESTONE payment upon the successful completion of the first to occur of the following three events:(1) Achievement of the primary endpoint of overall survival in its TYME-88-Panc pivotal trial;.....or(2) Achievement of the primary endpoint of overall survival in the PanCAN Precision Promise? SM-88 registration arm;.....or(3) U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of SM-88 in any cancer.This payment would be split into a $10 million milestone cash payment and a $10 million investment in TYME at a 15% premium to the then prevailing market price. Eagle’s shares will be restricted from sale until the earlier of three months following the milestone event or the three-year anniversary of the agreement.Hoping the trial status and working collaborations be fully discussed. If our therapeutics (i.e. SM-88, SM-18, et al) are now being manufactured by EVOTEC, please expound. Updates on our working agreements with EAGLE and LinEARX also requested. Alsofrom the milestone schedule:NCT04720664-OASIS_Breast_Cancer, Last Update Posted : May 27, 2021, from the graphic: First Patient Enrolled 3Q21 (Oct -Dec 2020) is well passed.We are currently nearing the end of 1H22.

Do technical analysis 
this is such a disappointment
"Monday is up swing on the trade. Tuesday news: milestone payments, partnership agreements with evotech Europe. Coupled with the patent development, and further development in SM-88. a lot of social media lift on this as well. GL we go up from here!!!!"
Candlestick analysis indicate tyme will close around the 2.20 mark
Buy below a dollar #$%$
"Look, they had a 40 million share direct placement at $2.50 a share. They raised $100 million that fully funds them through phase 3 trials. When this stock surges, past experience is that it explodes. Insider sales are a drop in the bucket. I think they are more a function of available income to insiders who know it will likely be a couple years before promising clinical trial data can lead to FDA approval and the company is able to turn a profit. Personally I consider the 2.50 per share to be a baseline below which I will likely never sell my shares. That means anyone buying here will likely see 100 percent return as a minimum. IMO, only a complete reversal of years of positive data in future late stage clinical studies could change this. I'll risk that unlikelihood and stay long TYME. The major flaw with the company is their extreme focus internally -- where insiders dominate -- and their tendency to share good news with each other but not with the public or their retail shareholders. Good communicators they are not."
I see 3 dollars anytime soon
LET IT POP 
Let's see 9$ boys
I think she will come back...nicely to 2...may be
Closing above $3 call interest spiking
"Just about 3 weeks left in FY2021 for TYME. Annual earnings released in May. FY2022 begins April 1st.Take that anyway you want. Trader's link to Seeking Alpha article is. A real gem if you came on with the bull rush on COVID patent. Our Proof Of Concept as a COVID treatment was promised this quarter. Probable recovery time for the flippers here.Fourth Quarter was our target for reporting on cancer clinical trials. That got slipped to 2022 using COVID as the cause.That starts April. They've been on target on their milestone projections always on page 5 of the Corporate Presentation. Last one released November 2020. Next one coming with 2021 Earnings, this May.The recent financining timed to the COVID pump. As a long holder and accumulator, we've had a large OPEN SHELF offering out. for at least a year.Now closed. The pump SEEMS to. have provided a method to reduce long holders dilution. I'm OK with it.Within the open shelf, there were numerous ""CHOKE"" provisions requiring a 6-month period to pass before purchased warrants placed within DTCC short registration.Registered warrants available for short term trades had a recent 40% increase. Retail volume ZOOMED up.TYME has NO INCOME. Every product is on Clinical Trial status. Anticipated announcements before April are start of trials in COVID, breast and blood born cancer treatments.Possible expansion to 3d stage prostate and update to on-going trial in Sarcoma.Doubt if this will drop to $1. Whom knows. See it really climbing till May earnings.My thoughts. GLTUA"
Analyst price targets at $9
"The only thing I hate more than this company is myself, for thinking I was buying on a run up and not at the peak like I apparently did."
I am not a big fan of Andy Marsh sell every two weeks. Is he that broke? Take some pride in your own stock and let it grow.
It is only a matter of TYME! 
"Big move here next week, all bullish indicators are coming together. Heavy shorts Friday coupled with $1call options volume should see 1.30 next week. GL"
Not worried here at all. As usual NO NEGATIVE NEWS. Very light volume. May pick up some more at this price point. Current avg share price in the mid $1.20 range. Think I will. Not a doubt in my mind this will bounce back again. Just need that little kicker of GOOD NEWS from Richie Cunningham to bounce this into the $2.00 range and get this off the garage floor ! :-) Come on Richie whatcha say.... give us little guys a little love !
thinking if this will have a few day run to go up to double digit.
Patent on tech revolutionary to treating cancer? Here’s all my money!
nice 
"Listen, we need TYME to be 3 digits… $120 meme guys capitalize this on the good news!"
"Sold $1.14, time to load up here soon. Thanks for the $$$. Round trip # 3 or go long?"

WOW......... Going to blow through 100mm shares traded ! +50% bump..... That is going to grab some attention.
Hopefully she opens at least at 2
Tyme fell through the first support level
"Insider buy, finally, Van Tornout Jan M, a whopping 1K shares for $1.05 registered on EDGAR near close. Probably kept us above a $buck."
"Hi,I am looking into TYME and I like their approach. Can you please help me to identify next catalyst? When do you expect it to take place?"
8.50 price target end of year this is just the beginning
Looks like no one was impressed with the conference call.
$NRXP is running on good news
Just cannot seem to hold on to it’s climb to success. Profit takers prevent the stock from going higher. Hopefully one of these days the positive news will be to good to sell and maybe we make it to $2.50 and higher.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1WgtT62gzY
lets see 150% gain today. buy whike still cheap.
Volume dried up. Guess im stuck waiting it out 
There appears to be some opportunist institutional buying going on ! Decent sized blocks being acquired. Nice to see.... Hope some good news soon.
"Again, thank you for the $$,$$$. Either your bosses are awesome or $2pid$. BOTH?"
there's a ton of support at this 1.70 level. it's not done from here (today or long term). tho prly not reaching $2 again today.
Last 15 mins 1.68+
This is the action tyme gets after a virtual healthcare conference presentation??
Risk is there for any biotech company. The upside is massively huge. Just bought 1000 more @ 1.06 to average down. Rome was not built overnight. Patience will win.
get in now!
Back in 45k shares at 1.25Gl
That is fantastic news. No doubt. That is what we needed. Hopefullygood things will continue.
"Haha over 100million in shorts, with .6 days left to cover. Oh yeah squeeze is on!"
"This company found an amino acid specific to cancer and can target it? I just don’t know why everyone is not supporting this company. I know they are small, but I will. Their treatment is non intrusive? I guess none of you no anyone that has cancer?"
I should have sold at $2 last week
"INFO ONLY. Questions submitted too late for Earnings call and considered a distraction if covered in Annual Meeting/ Proxie Vote Earnings Call.ANSWER FROM INVESTOR RELATIONS IN ALL CAPITAL LETTERS*****************************************For next Tuesday's Investors Meeting and Proxy Vote, I'm asking for clarification on several topics.Has our collaboration with LineaRX/APDN for molecular detection of invasive Circulating Tumor Cells (iCTCs) been replaced by our bio-marker collaboration with Evotec?CTCS WERE BEING EXAMINED IN PROSTATE CANCER MAINLY. HOWEVER, AS PART OF OUR STRATEGIC REVIEW, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT WE WERE NOT CURRENTLY GOING TO FOCUS ON PROSTATE, AND THAT WE NEEDED TO FOCUS ON BROADER MORE TRADITIONAL BIOMARKERS THAN JUST CTCS. WHILE THIS DOESN’T MEAN WE MIGHT NOT USE THEM IN THE FUTURE, CURRENTLY WE ARE FOCUED ON THE EFFORTS AT EVOTEC MAYO AND OTHER PLACE, AS WELL AS USING CIRCULATING TUMOR DNA IN OUR BREAST CANCER TRIAL THAT ALL THE KOLS SAID WAS A MORE VALIDATED BIOMARKER THERE.As of Evotec's own investors' meeting there is no mention of us within their meeting's video stream, or on pharma-partnerships.EVOTEC IS A SERVICE CORPORATION AND WORK WITH HUNDREDS OF COMPANIES, INCLUDE THE LARGEST PHARMA COMPANIES AND SMALL BIOTECHS LIKE OURSELVES. I DOUBT THEY WOULD LIST ALL OF THEIR CUSTOMERS. EVOTEC DOES HAVE AN INVESTMENT ARM WHERE THEY CAN INVEST IN COMPANIES OR SUPPORT RESEARCH. (A VERY SMALL PORTION OF THEIR ACTIVITIES.) I BELIEVE THAT IS THE LINK THAT YOU FORWARDED. THIS IS NOT THE TYPE OF RELATIONSHIP WE HAVE WITH EVOTEC CURRENTLY. NCT03512756 - TYME's self-sponsored clinical trial with some collaboration with LINeaRX and Eagle Pharma, from milestones graphic below updates are due now-> end of September (1H22). To summarize, data listed on the Clinical Trial site was Last Update Posted : June 21, 2021. In our collaboration with Eagle RX:Jan 7, 2020 Tyme Technologies and Eagle Pharmaceuticals Announce Strategic Collaboration///////OUR MILESTONE PAYMENT CAVEATS\\\\\\\\\\\\\In addition, TYME will receive a $20 million MILESTONE payment upon the successful completion of the first to occur of the following three events:(1) Achievement of the primary endpoint of overall survival in its TYME-88-Panc pivotal trial;.....or(2) Achievement of the primary endpoint of overall survival in the PanCAN Precision Promise? SM-88 registration arm;.....or(3) U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of SM-88 in any cancer.This payment would be split into a $10 million milestone cash payment and a $10 million investment in TYME at a 15% premium to the then prevailing market price. Eagle’s shares will be restricted from sale until the earlier of three months following the milestone event or the three-year anniversary of the agreement.THIS SEEMS CORRECT. SINCE THE 3RD LINE TRIAL OF PANCREATIC IS BEING SHUT DOWN, (NCT03512756) THE REMAINING EVENTS WOULD BE THE ONES TO FOCUS ON. FOR PANCAN YOU SHOULD NOTE THE EVENT IS THE PRIMARY ENDPOINT AT THE END OF THE TRIAL. THIS WOULD BE BASED ON SURVIVAL RESULTS FROM ~175 PATIENTS TREATED WITH SM-88. PRIOR TO THAT “FINAL” DATA, THERE IS A “GRADUATION” FROM THE PHASE 2 PORTION OF THE TRIAL ~100 PATIENTS, TO THE CONFIRMATORY PHASE 3 PORTION ~75 ADDITIONAL PATIENTS. WHILE WE BELIEVE IT WOULD BE ENCOURAGING THAT SM-88 GRADUATES TO THIS “CONFIRMATORY” PORTION (MAINLY BECAUSE THERE WOULD APPEAR A BENEFIT THAT NEEDS CONFIRMING), THIS GRADUATION WOULD NOT TRIGGER THE MILESTONE. AS PRECISION PROMISE COME OUT OF THE PANDEMIC, OPENS UP ITS ADDITIONAL SITES, WE MIGHT HAVE A BETTER IDEA OF WHEN THESE EVENTS COULD OCCUR, BUT TO BE CLEAR- WE ARE BLIND TO THE EXACT ENROLLMENT OF OUR ARM AND THESE ARE BASED ON OUR ESTIMATES OF SOME OVERALL ENROLLMENT AND OTHER ITEMS THAT WE USE TO TRIANGLATE THE POTENTIAL STATUS OF OUR ARM. Hoping the trial status and working collaborations be fully discussed. If our therapeutics (i.e. SM-88, SM-18, et al) are now being manufactured by EVOTEC, please expound. Updates on our working agreements with EAGLE and LinEARX also requested. WE CAN’T REALLY SAY MUCH MORE ON PARTNERSHIPS THAN WHAT IS IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN. EVOTEC – WE HAVE SAID WE HAVE STARTED WORK WITH. LINEARX WAS MAINLY A TRIAL THAT IS NOW COMPLETE OR STOPPED. EAGLE, THE ONLY THING WE CAN REALLY SAY IS THAT THIS WAS MORE OF A COMMERCIAL AGREEMENT, SO ACTIVITIES WOULD NOT REALLY HAPPEN UNTIL CLOSER TO COMMERCIALIZATION. OTHER THAN THAT, YOU CAN LOOK AT THEIR HOLDINGS AND SEE IF THEY HAVE SOLD SHARES (I DON’T BELIEVE THEY HAVE.) Also from the milestone schedule:NCT04720664-OASIS_Breast_Cancer, Last Update Posted : May 27, 2021, from the graphic: First Patient Enrolled 3Q21 (Oct -Dec 2020) is well passed.We are currently nearing the end of 1H22.

Patent news!!
Merger merger 
They're scaring the weak hands to buy their cheap sharesBEWARE!
Price target $8++ Today target 500%
I give trying to explain to you people. I am still going to invest in them and know they will possibly cure some cancers.
200% today!!!!
Big boom tmrw morning. Look where they were in Feb.
and now the rocket upward!!
up to 3.5$ soon
TOMMY: You could certainly be right but at any moment news could strike and this stock price will POP. Do not think Richie C. is just sitting on his hands waiting for clinical trial data to arrive !
"Yahoo's killing post holding a link to this article:Do Institutions Own Tyme Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:TYME) Shares.Yahoo FinanceThat should get you there using it as a search of. Nice overview of Outstanding Share (O/S) ownership. Distribution.Just a general coverage. Interesting insight. Retail holders are a slight majority.Nice things to know.GLTA"
"Until we get some really good news TYME is going no where and as I have said before. will hang between .85 and 1.20 so just stay calm and do not get so excited over these small premature pops as we have a good while( probably 2022) before we even scare the $2 and $4 marks people are talking about. It stinks but it is reality so ""stay cool, calm and collect"" and wait for 2022."
"TYME presently has $180mm Market Cap priced at $1.05 per share.It also has $101mm in Cash & Investments So.... TYME's Intellectual Technology, a first-in-class CMBT compound which to date, clinical trial data has shown that SM-88 has achieved confirmed tumor responses across 15 different cancers, both solid and liquid tumors, including pancreatic, lung, breast, prostate, sarcoma and lymphoma cancers with minimal drug-related serious Grade 3 or higher adverse events... SO it's potential is presently valued at less the $70mm ?and That valuation doesn't even take into consideration TM-18, TM-19 nor the value of the pending clinical trials that are presently underway.... northe working relationships with Eagle Pharma, The Mayo Clinic, NYU Langone Health, The Pancreatic Cancer Action Network, The Joseph Ahmed Foundation, Georgetown University etc........Take a look at the people sitting on TYME's Scientific Advisory Committee ! even mebers of the Board of Directors Beyond impressive.This stock is so undervalued. I just convinced myself to buy more share again at these prices ! GLTAL ! Truly only a matter of TYME !"
price target 9.50$ go up!!$TYME
TYME shooting up on high volume in the last few minutes. Hope something good is in the wings!
$27 Million invested early by the Institutions means they are confident and so we should be
5k more at 1.23 50k totalLets do this!!
Pipe dreams
"New the TYME. Fresh from the TNXP disaster. Be mindful Patents are not as hard as you may think to get. The drug trial results are what makes Pharma stocks move. I still bought 1,000 shares at $1.63. I am comfortable there. But of you think this stock is breaking $2.00 today... The data and history just doesn't support that."
2.5 price target for today!!!
Thumbs up if think closing in green...thumbs down red..What do you think?
Nice little bump on solid volume.... Market Cap should be somewhere closer to $350mm - $400mm. Come on Richie share some good news !!! Any interesting collaborations in the works ????
Insiders set to sell again on Friday.
"I am invested in TYME: long term as this is 5 years from showing any business growth. At this stretch of low price I wonder if they need a reverse split, especially to stay on NASDAQ."

If management are not able to get the price above $2 their only recourse will be a reverse split. I have been involved in 2 small biotechs that this has occurred and from an investor perspective this is not beneficial.""What are the chances that we also fall for same issue here? Is it possible? If not, why not?Only serious feedback please.Thanks."

Its TYME to buy TYME. This is the bargain of a lifeTYME. Load up longs
Why is tyme down?
"The message here is exactly what you should have expected if you've been listening the last few months to the updates. While there is no bad news there's also an absence of any good news as well. This is dead money for at least the next 12 months. How could you have expected anything more? But with that said, this could end up be the best story in the history of cancer therapy. Since they have funding thru the end of this process there is very little downside risk to playing a stock that has such huge upside."

Gonna just through $2
"The entire market is red, but this is green!"
Who’s driving this rocket ??
game changer end of the year 
When TYME was trading today in the $1.80s I told you MOMO amateurs to sell ... cause TYME would continue to sell-off into the close and end the day in the $1.30s !!!! Where'd TYME close??? In the $1.30s
after market 4.5$$tomrow open 7$$
"Read the stories about SAVA. There are apples to apples comparison of a stock, a biotech stock, began at a couple of bucks share price a year ago surged suddenly to around $9. Many sold had a nice profit and now today rue that decision. SAVA it's on the verge of making medical history with its product to combat alheimérz. So. it's currently a $135 stocks many think will run to $900 a share when it's done. Let that be a lesson for those of us here at TYME. I've never heard the SM-88 approach doesn't work against a variety of cancers. Proving it takes time. But when it happens the share price will explode. You won't be able to react fast enough if you're not already in it and that is the risk."
I believe our pumpernickel is celebrating now?
35 k shares 1.39Let’s goo
This is going to take 8 months before we see 4-5 dollars barring some fda approval. I’m waiting but damn I would love the triple up. Big potential just need to hold. Willing to hold for 2 years to make 10x good fundamentals good path higher financing
why are insiders selling??? Steve Hoffman- 156250 shares... what's going on?
"The potential here alone should put TYME @ $500mm Market Cap ! Over $100mm in cash, multiple late stage trials in the works, Entering the Breast Cancer market place...... WE ARE GOING MUCH HIGHER $2.50 PLUS in the short terms !!!!!!!!!"
"On average, Wall Street analysts predict that Tyme Technologies's share price could stay at $9.50 by Nov 13, 2021. The average Tyme Technologies stock price prediction forecasts a potential downside of N/A from the current TYME share price of $1.22."
"This should not surprise anyone! Nothing positive is going to happen until Tyme has some meaningful positive and documented success and is able to share and confirm same, everyone get over the disappointing action of this stock as nothing is going to change for a long time and just be prepared to hang out between .85 and 1.30. I know is boring and frustrating but it takes real results to make it go up and that is not happening anytime soon. Best you can hope for most likely is something good in the first quarter of 2022. Those are my thoughts and I have almost quit watching it period and certainly so have others and the POST are far and very few between."
AMAZING NEWS WILL POP TO 2.5 AT LEAST!!!
Getting tougher to remain optimistic on this one; down 60% over the last 6 months..down to $1 today.

One piece of advice for the Longs of TYME -- bring your kneepads and grease for Tues. activity!
This stock double then dropped 50% so we are back to $1.
Our pumpernickel DavidNIO has been gone for almost 2 years now mates. He move to #tyme and changed his name and picture to a girl FightingIrishTYME. She’ll make us monies daily. I wonder what her prediction is for TYME IN 7 DAYS? where’s my pumpernickel DavidNIO at
Look at SAVA and read some of the rueful posts of those who made a profit but sold way too soon after the first surge in SP. It's a useful lesson.
Power hour and after hours 
"Voyager Therapeutics Stock, a Beaten-Down Biotech, Soars on Pfizer License DealI can see this in our future ! Come on Richie C. I know you got it in you !"
"Well, have to admit these guys really stretch the envelope when it comes to being communicatingly challenged. That was probably the most boring and unenlightening conference calls I've ever heard. They certainly checked the block on every cliche imaginable. ""We're expediting our actions to react quickly . . ."". Really? I got absolutely nothing out of it. They literally could have called that one in. Oh wait that's what they did. The highlight was coming in withe the entire CC under 20 minutes, the lone substitute covering analyst question notwithstanding. The good news is that they are somehow able to convince folks like us to pony up 100 million dollars at $2.50 a pop in support of what they're doing. but I wish they would act a little more thrill about what they're doing than what we're doing, at least during a conference call. Still long here, but totally unimpressed with Richie and the Fonz, et al, and their communication skills."

"Let us have your prediction on what is likely to be the high print for TYME in the Sept. and Oct. (roughly two-month) interval. I will stick my neck out and predict a high of $1.29 (with a probability of 0.8), but will also note that $1.63 is likely (with a probability of 0.4).

Today was a great day for the company. Period. We have the patent we needed for this company to get one step closer to a viable business. Just because the stock doesnt do what you want dont whine. Whine at the scared investor that gets pushed like a baby each time. Company is doing everything expected to succeed. Hoping for more good news in the coming days..
Headed under $1.00 again!!
Awesome news today. The new era has begun. It's GO TYME !
"Well nuts,Today's telecon/10Q kind of an abbreviated rehash. Not close to expansion of programs I was hoping for.It did shed light on our collaboration with EVOTECH, largely a European bio tech, and use of biomarkers vs. PET scans (e.g. Invasive Circulating Tumor Cells (iCTCs) ) in monitoring clinical effect of therapies.With my first notice of EVOTECH collaboration.Question arises on whether our SM-88 may be in used over in European Clinical Trials, coincidentally, EVOTECH is having their own investor meeting tomorrow:On to 24 August, proxy vote and telecon. No change to ballot announced today. Was hoping for addition of voting on buyout offer. AHHHH, not happening.GLTUA"
close @ 2.03. call interests confirmed

It will be a nice day when TYME hits 4.00 very soon. Do your on DD. Just my opinion.
"This should biopharma has just left a conference picking up 3 more analysts. Their reports should push this up fast, and without warning. too much cash on hand vs free cash flow. one day this will jump 100%-300% almost over night, or over a weekend. The institutional investment here knows when they try to kick up the SP that retail investors short, or take profit. If the investors that are on this thread would stop selling, and shorting on small spikes every TYME, we would see continued growth."
Time to TYME short term of $2.00 long term of $3.50 by Jan
Going under $1.00 soon
"Based on what I read so far, it looks like Tyme is an innovator in the field of cancer treatment. I bought tens of thousands of shares this year because I believed they will come up with something outstanding like this. We all know though that innovators tend to struggle in the short-run because they will be ""drawing the map while walking in the forest"", but the payoff will be huge in the long-run."
Looks like I'm bag holding this #$%$ forever.
"Been playing TYME for almost 2 years. Love the science. It could prove to be the Holy Grail of cancer therapy and since this metabolic approach applies to ALL solid tumor types (and maybe hematological as well, ultimately) if it proves efficacious this could be the biggest story in the history of cancer meds. Having said that, a dose of reality here; a US patent adds nothing to the likelihood of an FDA decision. USPTO only looks at the novel MOA and says it's ""different"". The science still has has to work to get FDA approval. With no FDA IND until mid to late 2022 this is dead money until early 2023. I'm selling here and will be buying back lower because or will be $1.20 or lower at some point in the next few months. The patent is only great once the science gets approved and others want to license it. Good luck all!"
"TYME Technologies is a new biotechnology company that develops “cancer metabolism-based therapies” or CMBTs. These treatments are designed to work across a wide range of diagnoses, solid tumors, hematologic cancers and more. The stock is trending higher after receiving patent notification for its metabolomic technology platform."
Platform model will be a huge hit. Looks at how MRNA has been able to transform themselves with the platform model. Opportunities are unlimited with AI !
"This stock to me is not about turning a profit. It is about fighting cancer. It sounds to me as though they are trying. All of you trying to short or pump amd dump, I have no words!"
"The posters are up on the company website. I encourage any interested party to read all four. I came away more impressed with the performance of the compound. Will post some more detailed reaction later, but for now I will just say I am disgusted with the conduct of Matthew Herper and Adam Feuerstein. It is because of people like those two that companies do not want to accept third line PANC patients into clinical trials. These are patients who DO NOT RESPOND - period. Literally, their response rates in clinical trials is ZERO. Yet the tyme trial enrolled third, fourth and fifth line patients - these were 85% of the patients on drug. Yet rather than focus on the hopelessness of the patient profile, the strong evidence of clinical benefit, and the compelling (albeit not definitive due to no control arm) evidence of survival benefit, these two focus instead on the fact that ORR was modest. Well no kidding it’s modest - look at the patients! Not to mention that ALL patients were measured at 2 months - before they time that this drug has started to show responses in other trials. These guys are more keen to pick apart a title of a press release then they are to do a responsible analysis of whether a new compound is showing serious signs of promise in an impossible patient population. End of rant. I am doubling down on tyme."
"Another gem in the making here. If you missed the run up over at #CNSP #ITRM and most recently #OTLK#NIO tribe, have you seen my pumpernickel DavidNIO? Can someone contact him on WhatsApp. He has made more millionaires compared to crypto scammers lurking everywhere. We need 3X here at least!*This is for entertainment purposes only. Do not copy me. But you can certainly Follow the Money otherwise YOMO"
The greatest advantage to owning tyme or itrm Is that you get to sell it and use the loss against your gains made in good company’s￼￼
5 Dollar
Lets get our profits by spring 2022 Price target is 1year not by end of year
"I'm bullish but Richie Cunningham needs to start defending the positive potential of this company with periodic updates on progress of ongoing trials and explanations on its unique approach in treating a list of cancers and as a therapeutic for COVID. The offering at $2.50 is over and Cunningham needs to support those investors along with the rest of us longs with a little more effort to tell a positive story about Tyme and its potential therapeutics. It's not pumping it's well-earned bragging, so let's hear it."
"GUYS, 3$+ EASY TODAY"
soooo any news to talk about?share with the team buyers please
"Been saying this all day. These Small Cap Pharma companies do not shoot the moon because of a patent. Contrary to belief Patents are not hard to get. The trials are what will move this stock. You will end up holding if you don't get out when you can. Look at what IGC did last week. They got a patent approved, it pumped, and has been dumping since... Leaving Bag Holders in its wake. Be wary of these people who are saying things like ""rockets and shooting the moon"" and offer no evidence to back it up. The moving averages have this stock at $1.55 - $1.63."
hold!!this will be 5$
This is our this week's $NURO
Exciting Company here. With current patents and R and D this puppy is about a year or so away from real success but its the early birds that make the biggest gains. This should be trading in the $3.00 to $4.00 range by year end. Good luck all
I know this is a long way off but I will keep a small position in support of their efforts...I hope they make some progress and are able to help people beat various types of tumors with less invasive treatment!
If anyone understands the mechanism of sm-88 what this patent allows is the attachment of a chemotherapy that will only be released inside of cancer cells. It will reduce the toxicity to non cancerous cells.
"We’ll, thank you for the $$,$$$ bosses"
I was late I got it @ $1.84
"I cannot envision how cheerful my life is correct now since I met the best broker on message, his systems and procedure is so justifiable and uncommon yea, I began exchanging with 1BTC presently I'm acquiring 4BTC week by week, Mrs Rhonda I'm always cheerful and appreciative for everything you do folks you can contact her on Telegram @rhonda_J and have an euphoric future"

Given solid financial condition ( CASH RUNWAY into into 2024 ) and this great news this stock should be trading around $500mm market cap !
"I pray not one of you get cancer! However, if you do if you are betting against a company fighting against it, hmmm, this is not a pump and dump. Help this company beat cancer. I beg you.  I have seen too many pass with this and Irs not pretty. You will beg for research such as this if you are dying from it!"
Is anyone taking about this on Reddit? What’s the thread?
"Strap in bois, it’s TYME"

"Ellen Degernous just bought 4million shares, this thing. is easily going to 2000/share"
"17M Pre market we will buy all the way to $2.50 today ""Mark my Word"""
"The volatility of this stock: ie: going from $1.10 to over $2.00 on relatively innocuous news just goes to show how ready this stock is to really blasting off. The slightest bit of positive clinical trial results / news and this stock is going off the charts..... Cant wait for the OASIS Breast Cancer Trials with Georgetown University to get started. In the initial studies of SM-88, there were encouraging tumor responses in the HR+/HER2- patients, including complete responses or complete resolution of their tumor. The OASIS trial is aimed to confirm this activity and possibly identify the next step in the development path in this setting for SM-88.Only a matter of TYME....... and believe me you will want to be onboard before blast off occurs ! GLTAL !!!!!!!!!!!"
Shares short here ? Squeeze this big news down road
Where’s my pumpernickel FightingLeprechaun at? He said this “stock price will pop any moment now!”?

"Tomorrow’s Fat Payday Friyay is so green! My pumpernickel DavidNIO said #NIO will be $70 in 7 days! Have you seen him?Did you follow the money and bought #tyme at $1.05? You could be up 8% now, AND “someone” said it will be at least $5 bucks on January 21Still holding #itrm and #otlk? Hang in there, you’ll get your money’s back. You’re holding "
TYME stock action suddenly came back into action in late Friday trading. The stock has been sliding steadily for a long time; so Friday's price action is most unusual. Maybe it foretells a major move in the coming week or two.
I like what just happened …let’s do it again 
Up 2.5 pennies.... Oh boy... Old Vulture Cap Boy must be at it again ! Hahaha.........
JW Vulture Puke Spreak Engrish you Foo ! Phony boy JW the big institutional trader likes to spend his days mulling around on yahoo message boards with all the other institutional big-guns HAHAHA.......... He also needs to take a remedial Engrish crlass. So peoples understrand his messrages..... Time to put the useless Meathead Phony on ignore. Buh bye JW Phony Boy..... Think of us all here on this TYME Yahoo message board when you are riding your bicycle home this evening.
"Looks Like ""Thomas"" is going to get his wish( 5 days ago post) for TYME to go below $1"

"Interesting: Pfizer Inc., maker of a top-selling Covid vaccine, will buy all the shares of Trillium Therapeutics Inc. it doesn’t own, gaining the immune cancer drugmaker for an equity value of $2.26 billion.Things that make you say hmmm ?"
GAP UP TO 2.50 TOMORROW ON AWESOME PATENT NEWS
dont sell this will fly.
Nice support low risk area
it's still so early 
Been here since the beginning. Definately not a good feeling. Hoping for the best.
Wish I got this earlier... currently holding at 1.85 - dipping in and out of the red zone
Buy and hold for real money lads and ladies
Trying to average down but have to wait for two days to settle my stock sale. Ahhhhhhhhh next week I’m averaging down.
"I have no idea when this builds to $2.00 + but i know for sure it should be trading above $2.00 now. Interest will increase the more investors learn about TYME. I also know I am long and strong here, keep buying at these prices TYME can be the small guys big win cause it is affordable and under priced right now but that will change soon and you will regret now owning this stock."
"Does Tyme partner with drug companies that they are testing their products/ delivery system with? Seems those companies should be contributing to the testing as they benefit. Very long term bullish, short term yawn."
1.20 today
