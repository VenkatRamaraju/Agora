Taking into account that TikTok is valued at 75 Billion dollars. Since 2016 more than 2 billion people have downloaded the serious app of much long-term advantage for Yj
Up up after the big announcement after closing. Must have been leaked earlier but moving now
The way this is holding I could see someone buying quite a quantity of this over night
"SC 13G filed reporting Fasturn Overseas Limited own 7% of Yunji, is this positive news for investors...?"
Should be super good news!!!
Yunji is down 8.03% to 1.26
Yunji is up 22.93% to 2.84
YJ will have a big jump by this Friday.
"EPS improving, exponentially growing sector, collaborations with the biggest social platforms, what else should I add to it?"
it's revenue is almost the same as PDD. price should be much higher
Pump and dump ponzi scheme.
"Once the day traders exits, this will fly back over 5.00 today and tomorrow will double or tripple from there. Look at the volume. Low float."
Lost 40 k but I am going to hold it
This stock is the next jmia! Mark my word
It should hit $10 today
TMROG on a kamikaze mission
"Eight months ago I posted Yunji would reach $30.00 in 2021, with earnings of $2.00.Too optimistic. Revise that to $20.00.Hoping for earnings of $0.05 tomorrow. (Analyst call is $0.00).Analyst calling for $0.28 next quarter."
"okay, i have no clue what will be the trigger to have this stock re-rated but i'm in just below 2 "
"Confucius say: He who sell, feel well."

This week will be a good week to accumulate. 1 year from now this stock will be much much higher.
Yunji is down 20.28% to 3.93

$YJ Volume surge up today to 320K shares. Often a surge in volume forecasts a jump in $YJ share price.
"Slow churn down below 2. It will take about 1-2 months...May pop with any news, but unlikely way the company is being run....Good Luck to all and do your due diligence.."
some of you don't know how to read the earnings. considering how much this company makes it shouldn't be trading at these current levels. This is an aggressive growth story. don't be surprised if this is trading over $30 in 6-12mths. I know companies with less earnings trading much higher.
Okay guys and gals.... where do we go from here?
Yunji reached a 52 Week high at 6.01
what happened to the deal with Tik Tok?
12$ coming people YJ it’s a great company
This will fly like JMIA
What will we see tomorrow? I'm holding 400 shares! ?
Holding. Guessing this would go above $18
Anyone know what's really going on
What’s the plan for tomorrow
do you think this will even hit 6 by next week??
In 3.99 Out 5.81 Nice AH profit. Might back in on a dip. Glta
Yunji is up 9.56% to 3.10
YJ single's day sales is RMB￥2.8billions. Why doesn't it help stock price?
ready to take off ? lunching time
"Newbie question, do they open in pre-market hours? I just got up so early today to check because I worried so much for the prices going be...."
Guaranteed bad earnings tomorrow..Friday will tank 50% or more......
Sorry for your loss...
It’s going to b 20$ in January
$YJ reports earnings on Monday.Yunji had strong  singles day sales. Looking for a Great report with best quarterly results to date.Yunji set to roar!!I like the stock...Clear the launch pad...
"Q2 2020 results: revenue cut in half, still making a loss.Q1 2020 results: revenue cut in half, making a loss.Not looking so good, I was following YJ for a while."
Tic Tok.
After hours sours!
"After Friday´s Earning Call, this stock will be double digits. Getting in now will pay out next week.Good Luck everyone!"
POWER HR....
Buy buy strong buy stock is going to green otherwise too late
What kind of company does a conference call and nobody has a single question to ask?
Hold people going up up soon
Doesnt move fast because investors are keeping their shares and wont sale before ER. That is why price is keeping the same level. My opinion.
"Last summer, JFIN went from $2 to $30 in two days. I am wondering if this will do the same. Just be careful trading."
Starting to roll over after week of straight up...Is it a trap???Good Luck to all and do your due diligence always...
Well support at 2.00 possible. based on where it goes from here is just an educated guess. I feel by the sales of third quarter that we will see upside coming into the new year 21' Online sales have not slowed down. This is a great jumping point for YJ to get the new business model up and fully profitable. Wait and see. Keep shares. Spike of news will blast it based on the ten day down average. Heck. negative news could adversely move it up at this point.
I’m staying long
"For all haters of yunji, yah yah the price will drop till $0.8 per shares. Lol. Nuts."
There is a vote on congress about it ADRs so give this a break till next Friday or Monday !

(YJ), an eCommerce platform in China, today reported its fourth quarter and fiscal year 2020 unaudited results after which the YJ stock price fell by 9.13% to drop at $2.39 a share as of this writing. YJ stock seemed red at the previous closing with a 3.31% drop and $2.63 per share price. Let’s analyze the earnings to understand the drop.https://stockstelegraph.com/2021/03/22/yunji-inc-yj-stock-is-down-today/"

Company is worth nothing lol
Bat Eater special
This stock might go down below $1 as per the current support levels.
YJ is up
What your price point guess for tomorrow. Mine is $7
People obviously don't know how to read an ER. The company has shifted away from product cost billing and are moving to a percentage model like Amazon. This is why Gross Revenue is down by 60% or so and Net Earnings are up substantially. This is a very good thing! Buy.
"@4.77, staying long"
This Chinese stock will green
"Sell yunji, Buy cctr, htds, millions to see"
8$ coming Friday babyyyyyyy
60% drop in rev quarter to quarter comparison from last year!Nothing more need to be said!GLTA in stock casino!
"seems to me that this is the next JMIA: dirt cheap e-commerce player that was out of favour, waiting for a trigger to at least trippel and then still cheaper than peers"
Litb is a much better value than yj. They doubled their revenue last quarter and beat earnings by 800%.
I’m telling you guys it’s going to blow
i think they set up for the 4th quarter to make more in revenues.. with free subscriptions because of Covid.. Online buys will go up.. I'm going to Hold my and see if this passes 5.50
Going to be a bloodbath unfortunately Friday...AH determined that.
"The target price will $10 in 6 months.Finvolution ($FINV) is a low risk Fintech, E-Commerce with payday advance loan in China. FINV is an online lender that generates 1.04 revenue in a year. However, the current stock price is $2 because nobody knows this company yet.

As of September 30, 2020, the Company had over 112.8 million cumulative registered users. If you miss the boat with $YJ, consider this as an alternative."
When is the next quarter results for Yunji?
horrible earnings....I have shares and was hoping for the best but looks like it will tank....
does anybody else see a bullish pattern developping here ?
we are going up now after long wait..
Why is this going up? Wait after earnings
"its gonna at least 10x in next 3 years, Chinese amazon"
Followed TTG advice on YJ and lost money.
Be careful during AH
Watch this guys.
"$30.00 stock in 2021, with earnings of $2.00/share."
"Got in at $4.50, not worrying about the paper loss looking at the potential. Only regret is i should have split my entering point"
Yunji is up 9.26% to 1.77
shorted some at 5
Any news here guys?
Halted but why
Trades around $1.75 on Friday...Sell premarket
Is anyone here think that it is going up to 5 today again?
I added some early today. Hope we get profit
Another chinese high flyer...Backup and load up all you can...Good Luck to all and do your due diligence always...
Spoke too soon. Broke through 4...Now at 3.97 and headed down...Should have took the lumps and moved on before damage gets too great..Good Luck to all and do your due diligence always...

Yunji is up 7.19% to 1.49
"Everyday I am surprised from the stock price, everyday going down, anybody know why?Any expectations?"

Still having hope that this stock will go up
Everchanging landscapes for product movement create opportunities for Businesses to morph into something better. This is clearly the case with YJ. Keep long. It will pay well.
Yunji is down 7.76% to 1.07
Yj had revenue 1.4 bilI expect next year revenue will be 5 bil usAnd it is only market value is 1 bilSomething is wrong Manipulation
"Withthe share price starting to curl upwards above the 52 week low of 1.67, and the 52 week high being 6.05, is now the time the sell in panic? Or is it now time to buy, with the stock on the way back up to a more reasonable valuation? The chart speaks for itself- don't be scared by short-sellers into 'panic selling'. Now is the time to 'buy low'', so that you can soon 'sell high' for a hefty profit. For those who have unfortunately lost money here, now is the time to buy more, in order to regain lost ground as the SP cimbs back up."
I’m new in stocking so is it really going up ??
What do u guys think. Up or down
Bought at 5.33. Should I sell it at loss or wait??
It's going to shake the weak hands and end up closing the say at $5.20.
ER is solid !!! better than Q2 report... GMV is growing... active members are growing... and revenues are down because of the shift from selling own products to taking a commissionswould be surprised to see a big selloff because of the earnings
Nah. It’s going down. 
Very low valuation. This is on the radar and will move like other Chinese Ecoms
I think this will cross $20 today. We Shall See!
"If we beat the following numbers on Monday...PPS will surpass $14/ share. Numbers to beat = US$157.1 million on this 4th Quarter earnings report. Extreme analysis mode tells me there could be a 10-bagger here coz it's YJ is in its infancy. New brands, Chinese new year, Covid resistant, etc. YJ will pop on Monday March 22nd."
Can slowly buy in
this will act like yesterday AH around 3pm today
"share buyback , they have bilon in cash they can aford it, and finaly they changed buinissnis and made net profit clean... i think and still belive this gona go back above 1$ + very soon..."
Volume is going very high. $6 today.
Good time to buy in now? What price is their expected EPS?
Price target $35.50
Accumulation needed. Soon we will never see these lows.
the earnings were pretty decent overall considering the pandemic. if the restructuring if they're selling platform actually pays off in the long run other people will see that as an opportunity growth. I'm staying long.
A CORRECTION was made on their heading page!
"Here is the bottom line guys. YJ are changing their business Model to become more profitable. Instead of manufacturing and selling their own brand , YJ opted to opening their platform to big and exclusive brand. GMV2 increased and so GMV1. The revenue went down and so did the cost because they scaled down on manufacturing and opted to Amazon model. EPS is awesome and the company is heading on the right direction for both short and medium term. Remember all the good stuff happened in September."
is it worth to hold this?
Bought 4.71 omg losing so rapidly
"Looks like we are at the bottom, good to buy right now"
$YJ check out Financial Times site under 'Company Announcements'
"""Our third quarter financial results demonstrated the effectiveness of our cost control measures. On a year-over-year basis, we narrowed our loss from operations by 79.3% and our net loss by 14.9% in the third quarter. We also continued to improve our cost structures, maintain our strong cash reserves, and advance towards our goal of achieving healthy, profitable, and sustainable growth."" that's all you need to know. losses are decreasing big time - market will like that. the reason for a drop in revenue listen to their earning podcast - more detail"
I bought at 5.33 I am in a great loss
how is going?
"Yunji is an e-commerce company that still has a very interesting future ahead of it. Minimal debt, effective financial flow management, highly sought after products and further works on the development of its products under its own brand. We haven't heard any negative (unfortunately or positive) information for a long time. However, this is very good news, because the best news for each agency is ... This stock will very soon show us a rocket rise, close to its maximum values. The minimum daily trades only confirm this. Given the total number of tradable shares - 2,133,265,412 and the 11.48% share of these shares in the hands of ""inseders"", this is also good news. I'm buying. The pleasant future of this company is approaching express."
is nasdaq open friday half day?
"Well, quarterly results were reasonably OK ... stock gives songs of a double bottom at 2,50 ... And the ompany is in the most attractive segment of the market, dirt cheap and hasnt moved yet ... seems everything is there to support a buy"
Hold and sell at 20
This stock reached the bottom $ 0.70 and bounced from thereIMO it will never go below $ 0.70Now it will start going up gradually and it will settle above $ 2
earnings call today?
"$1.90 is the strong resistance point for YJ. This would be where I place my last buy order. I personally dont think it will drop back into the 1s, but its anyones guess really"
The manipulation in this stock is staggering
what thats it ? i won't get chance to buy more at 0.5 before ernings?
"what i still dont grasp with this one that it is at a run-rate of 5bln in GMV and has a market cap of 0,5bln while a company like JMIA has a run rate in GMV of 1bln and a market cap of 4bln ..."
$YJ planning a trip this week?????????????
YJ only offer 11m shares for it IPO. That is not much for company with over $2B market cap. I expect this company to sky rocket after the quiet period.
Holding $5.03 position
Yunji is up 24.34% to 3.76
"well, more than 20% growth in transacting members ... seems ok  ... it illustrates that their strategy to stop charging for memberships and focus on growth is gaining traction... if they can re-accelerate GMV growth coming out of COVID, there seems to be an investment case..."
"Looks like its holding up well, interesting..."
Yunji is down 21.00% to 3.01
still buying more
"Yep, it sure kept going, hated to see that but I made way to good profit to leave on table. Just could see a drop any moment and Profit is profit."
This has been quiet until today. Bought 1k shares a month ago and had been red up until today. Lucky me...
"I had a feeling about this stock prior when it was sub 2 USD, but I couldn't buy it based on the fundamentals.Congratz to all longs."
"This is a strong and stable company. A lot of people are investing on some garbage companies, but here you can be relaxed."
"Come on man, this won’t even break $10...."
"it will become $18, just guessing, i am holding right now"

"Holding all $BABA (ER!) Picked up some $YJ on super sale, nice to have something going green."
This is going to sky rocket
Friday going to fly
When is the next quarter
see the drop...
moon and back 
Strong support at $2.60. Time to accumulate and check back every quarterly. This is going double digits soon.
YJ is going to explode friday and into next week 
"announced that it plans to release its third quarter 2020 financial results before the market opens on Thursday, November 26, 2020. The earnings release will be available on the Company’s investor relations website at"
The report actually was positive for the company. Many people are blindly investing on many garbage companies which don't make any profits. This is a solid company and their shares will be $10+ soon.
Strong buy
"Like I said a week ago, $2.50 was the bottom. We are in accumulation now. This is the best time to get in. Anything under $3 and you will 3x at a minimum. Long-term this stock will be in the $20s"
Obvious someone knows a great ER is coming.
Next Sky Rocket $YJ
that's some rough earnings
"I'm going to do a survey, what they agree on will go up tomorrow, give me a little hand up and on the contrary"
Who bought at $6? You've been scammed.
Will YJ behave like REDU which went from $3 to $10 in three days..
"New products under the Li Ba Tian brand will go on sale on February 2, 2021, more positive news will surely come soon and Yunji will fly up. The company has almost no debts, has a strict strategy for managing internal flows and finances. last chance to buy at this price."
Any predictions/info on its Earnings report this week?
Will hold it till $11. The big shark investor are just playing with it. Have confidence in this stock.
Look like tomorrow is going to be a good day since YJ beats the estimate.https://www.chartmill.com/stock/quote/YJ/earnings-estimates
Looks like great outlook for the company overall !
Best kept secret out there $YJ No one talking about Yunji
Cannot go by todays action on the market. It's a shortened trading day in the U.S. Shorts will not be happy come Monday as YJ moves ahead.
contact in China told me watch for another big news release. 
Great chance to take some profits by buying it right now
"Guys, be aware, before end of may , this will fly again. Be prepared."
Take your losses or profits and move on!check ER and Rev is down over 60%GLTA In stock casino!
right now seems like an okay buying opportunity
It's on the move.
"Interesting ER. Gross Earnings were down a good amount, but they became incredibly more efficient and profitable at the same time. For the long run, their ability to gain positive net earnings is greatly increased, they just need to get Sales up more."
Yunji is up 8.61% to 0.82
Do you think this stock will be delisting?
YJ is down 9.59% to 3.30
Lol.. This message board is reason to short the stock. Just be happy I didn't tank.
Trading volume is very good. The baby is going up.
going to stable 20$ within 2 months.
We will hit $10 this week.
Something is happening? 4x the normal volume with 10% gain.
Rev down over 60%. Nough said!Go check ER PR!
"exhausted now, prepare to short again"
"This is the last oppotunity to buy this low, next year it will go up much higher with Doyin cooperation."
Strong support at 4...More margin selling on Monday considering the price action this week...Talk about 60% drop in Rev this quarter and PPS is up over 200%...Good Luck to all and do your due diligence always...
