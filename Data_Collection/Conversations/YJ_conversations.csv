"Here is the bottom line guys. YJ are changing their business Model to become more profitable. Instead of manufacturing and selling their own brand , YJ opted to opening their platform to big and exclusive brand. GMV2 increased and so GMV1. The revenue went down and so did the cost because they scaled down on manufacturing and opted to Amazon model. EPS is awesome and the company is heading on the right direction for both short and medium term. Remember all the good stuff happened in September."

"Like I said a week ago, $2.50 was the bottom. We are in accumulation now. This is the best time to get in. Anything under $3 and you will 3x at a minimum. Long-term this stock will be in the $20s"
"After Friday´s Earning Call, this stock will be double digits. Getting in now will pay out next week.Good Luck everyone!"
"New products under the Li Ba Tian brand will go on sale on February 2, 2021, more positive news will surely come soon and Yunji will fly up. The company has almost no debts, has a strict strategy for managing internal flows and finances. last chance to buy at this price."

the earnings were pretty decent overall considering the pandemic. if the restructuring if they're selling platform actually pays off in the long run other people will see that as an opportunity growth. I'm staying long.
ER is solid !!! better than Q2 report... GMV is growing... active members are growing... and revenues are down because of the shift from selling own products to taking a commissionswould be surprised to see a big selloff because of the earnings
"""Our third quarter financial results demonstrated the effectiveness of our cost control measures. On a year-over-year basis, we narrowed our loss from operations by 79.3% and our net loss by 14.9% in the third quarter. We also continued to improve our cost structures, maintain our strong cash reserves, and advance towards our goal of achieving healthy, profitable, and sustainable growth."" that's all you need to know. losses are decreasing big time - market will like that. the reason for a drop in revenue listen to their earning podcast - more detail"
