CEO says 2019 will be “a historic year for dividend growth”. I guess you need to figure out what that means. It’s pretty clear to me. :-)
$1.68 annual NFFO. That’s incredible. MPW can easily raise the dividend by 20%.
Look at it fold near the end of the day. A complete bum stock!
it's dropping because our hospital beds are filling up with covid deniers that refuse to get the shots. What did Ron White say?
"I had looked at this onesometime back. The reason I didn’t buy was because it’s Diluted EPS shrank from $2.01 in Q3 of 2018 all the way down to $0.21 in Q4 and has remained $0.20 in Q3 of 2019. Something fishy here.Also their liabilities are $6,479m much higher than $5,972m, or half a billion$ more. Is this still worth getting into?"
"Getting worse, how many dividends in share price will it lose??"
"Not what you hope for right after earnings.Medical Properties Trust Downgraded to Sector Perform From Outperform by RBC, Price Target Trimmed to $23 From $2405/03/2021 9:18:22 AM ET - MT Newswires"
"would you rather MPW pay down debt , or buy back shares ?"
I assume the institutions that bought the $17.30 secondary shares are happy. This bodes well for future large deals......that management says are currently in the pipeline. :-)
Any update on earnings?
Next div announced at $0.28 (as expected) and paid on July 8th. Ex-Div date is June 16th.
"Just added little bit more, thank you"
Should see a dividend hike soon. Plenty of FFO. :-)
"Yes, I listened to the conference call. I Don’t know how you get anything but bullish out of it. Management is extremely positive. It seems to me that this stock will rip higher as they close these $2.5 Billion in deals in 2019. And another $2.5 Billion in the pipeline. Just my opinion. :-)"
Go Joe go.
"Same price it was two years ago, but oh, that lovely dividend. Below the 50 DMA, next stop 19.40."
I bought more today - and not finished buying yet.
"Relentless, have you bothered to look at the chart? Say a 2-10 year one? Look at April through June, it went up a lot. Stuff can't always just go up. Just put it in your retirement and don't look at the day to day so much. It's income with pretty decent stability. What it's doing this past week will not make two cents of difference in two years, lol."
this thing holding great for a 400 pt loss on DOW. good sign of sp strength. we go higher very soon.
getting my chance to add more. My original buy was at 17.72 in my ROTH. I dont see a reason why its down? Income long stock for me. Beats the heck out of any MM or bond etc..... They collected over 95% during the worst of this pandemic. I say its safe and a good bet for long term core holding. My guess is it will get to 20+ shortly.
"""Medical Properties Trust Is Hitting All Cylinders And More"" is the title of anther great article posted today at seekingalpha."
MPW hit a new All Time Record High today. Looks like mid-20s trading range. :-)
$1.72 to 1.76 per share annualized NFFO guidance. :-)
"New debt sale is a very good thing!The one thing I really dislike about MPW is the equity dilution over the past couple years. Collectively it is quite substantial and has held back equity price gains. This new debt offering is a much better alternative to fund ongoing growth. We should do much MORE of this and tap the US debt market in a big way soon again.Sure there is cost to this debt, but MUCH LESS than the dilution we have been seeing.Good progress MPW!"
Last week Argus research raised their PT to $28
Why does the market hate a company that earns money and pays dividends? A tech stock can boast about revenue and not one cent in profit and the stock goes sky high Has all logic gone though the windows?
"Often overlooked is the fact that over 10,000 Baby Boomers are retiring every day in the US and most other places around the world. And this will continue for the next 8 years. Not only do these people need to rebalance to high yield income producing investments…….they need hospitals for new elbows and hips and heart attacks. MPW really is in a good place. :-)"
New to the board but not to this stock I started a position a few months ago bought some today on the dip I plan as using this stock as part of retirement divi is excellent and Management sees rock solid. Any thoughts?
"Same price it was Dec 2020, bum stock!"
MPW will be down another 30-50c tomorrow as ex divvy date hits stock
I’m worried that Kenneth may panic and sell his 5 shares. He needs to know that MPW is where Institutions park their money. They are the tail that wags the dog. Higher interest rate talk always hurts MPW.
"The consensus price target for MPW is $23.63. So there’s plenty of room to go higher on the share price. There will be a payout increase soon, while interest rates seem to be dropping. It’s all good. :-)"
"At the end of the day, I guess a 5.3% dividend is pretty good. Since I bought almost all of my shares at about $13……I guess the dividend yield on my original investment is now about 9%. FCPT has done even better for me. They have been very shareholder friendly. They’re buying a new property about every 3 days. :-)"
"So correct me if I’m wrong but they’re selling 50 million shares for 700 million. That’s $14/share. Pretty bad undercut to current shareholders, no?"
"Will be interesting to see if it slides further tomorrow or reverses. Looking to buy a handful of more shares, these corrections are fine by me :)....I have more REIT's issuing more shares and their prices are sliding a bit as well, as they buy more properties, etc."
BofA Securities Downgrades Medical Properties Trust to Neutral From Buy; Price Target is $21.5007/06/2021 6:55:13 AM ET - MT Newswires
"Shouldn't this stock be going through the roof now with this crisis? We need more hospitals and more testing etc, seems like a perfect company. Thoughts?"

So happy I own this. I was worried after that secondary but it's amazing how fast the price recovered. Buying more before the div announcement
"What about that lovely dividend, lol. Omg, what a disaster."
"Hard to imagine the effort put into the pump and dump on this stock when it is owned 80% by institutions and the short interest is about 4+. It seems like the effort wouldn't gain that many more shares from the little people, there are a lot of shares out and some institution wants them all. Sooner or later they will have to start buying to cover shorts and change direction. Of course anybody that put in a stop loss or bought the stock on margin got hammered. Should be over soon. A sure sign will be when Zacks and the Motley Foolstart changing the story."
"Any ideas where yahoo finance gets a negative 24 percent yearly gain in earnings for the next 5 years? I’d predict positive 10 percent plus based on babyboomer health woes, not negative growth? Your forecast?"
WARNING! Just make sure you fully understand the tax treatment of this and other similar investments before you buy. These stocks can look great.... until you read the fine print. They can be very expensive traps that are not what they appear to be. I'm neither bullish no bearish. The devil is in the details.
"In 12 days alone it has lost more than the dividend in share price, omg."
If I buy in now will I receive this years Dividends?
BUY at $19-$20 coming soon in September draw down
Something must be wrong here
Mizuho says to buy with a $23 PT
"Rapid dividend growth in the second half of the year is moving the stock now. When the dust settles, I expect MPW to be in the low $20s and still paying out a solid 4.3% +. This will make for a wonderful total return for investors. MPW really is in a sweet spot. :-)"
Get your cash ready to lock in a 6% yield. Just 60 cents down from here with a 2 cent dividend hike early next year.
"At least one and I suspect most Hospitals are starting to feel the cruch. Beth Israel Deconess Hospital cutting bonus to save cost. Donot think they are an MPW hosiptal .Emergency room physicians affiliated with Boston-based Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center were told that their quarterly bonus pay will be withheld, according to The Boston Globe.The bonus pay, which physicians say is analogous to overtime pay, was slated to be paid out March 30. The bonus money often adds up to tens of thousands of dollars and is paid out to physicians who pick up extra shifts or see more patients in the ER. The pay cut is in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Beth Israel, like many health systems in the U.S., has suspended elective procedures to free up bed space and supplies to treat COVID-19 patients. As a result, the system has lost a large portion of its revenue, according to the report."
PE-Backed Hospital Chain Got Help From Major Landlord as Losses Mounted.
MPW delivers great earnings again. Very solid. 36 cents FFO. Expected FFO of $1.44 this year. Plenty of room to raise the payout again!
New 52 week high today. :-) MPW should be trading in the $20s.
"I just picked up 2,000 more shares. 8% is just fine. :-)"
"Just checking in, look at this bum fold, tried to tell you. Enjoy that dividend."
"went from 20.33 to 20 is no time; dumped over 1.6% just like that. Must be some really bad news, smh."
Below 20? Big buy
Excellently ran. Little signs of weakness. Happy to get in around 16 but this range is fine for adding to the long term position
I am a present holder of MPW and it when droped below 12 (because of ETF action) I bought significantly more shares. If it drops to 11.5 I will buy even more.This stock will continue to be a dividend paying monster.
"MPW will announce the next quarterly dividend on, or about, August 26th."
"Last year, MPT had a FFO of 1.30 for the year and the stock finished the year at almost $21 per share. Before the market dislocation, the stock went to $24 for a 14% increase. The first quarter results MPT had a FFO of $0.37 share and the company reafirmed a FFO in the $1.60 to $1.65 range for. $1.60 for 2020. This FFO is a 23% increase over the previous year. Yet the stock is trading at $16.50 or 21% lower value than the first of the year. The hospital operators are paying their rent. This stock appears to be way undervalued based on the projected minimum FFO of $1.60. BTW the first quarter FFO would have been about $0.40 per share if the new lease rate was applied to the English hospitals that were recently purchased. This stock hopefully will be trading back at $24 before the end of the year."
"MPW up 1.3% on Friday. For some reason Blabberwonky could not find time to post. Oh, that's right....."
"Healthcare is getting hammered. Interest rate sensitive stocks getting hammered. Real Estate getting hammered. It’s a Triple Whammy. One more day of this and I’ll pick up 3,000 more shares. I’ll Thaler the 6% dividend. :-)"
"haha, this stock will never do anything."
Great Article today.....MPW goes to low $20s with a breakout. :-)
"MPW’s short position went from 17 million shares in July, to 10 million shares in August. :-)"
"Most REITs have been going down lately after a long rally. Seems like basic consolidation, below 20 is good for accumulation here imo."
"10,000 Americans hit 65 every single day now. They rebalance their portfolios to overweight high dividend stocks and stocks that raise that dividend. And they also spend much more time at the hospital. This puts MPW in the triple sweet spot. The number of people in the US over 65 will double over the next 6 years. MPW is the perfect stock for this massive demographic shift. FCPT,, who owns 400+ Olive Gardens is another. Olive Garden is the #1 casual dining choice for seniors. FCPT also pays a high dividend and raises that dividend. :-)"
Blabberwonky has not commented for a week. Must be embarrassed.
This stock looks like to have great upside potential with great earnings!!
Did my DD and really love this name. Evaluation a little high but love the business. Opened a small position and will add significantly on any weakness.
"Is this down leg on MPW related to the recent selling pressure on health care stocks, or did a deal fall out of the MPW 2019 forward pipeline? Either way, when to put in another buy?"
6 million shares traded today. That’s a lot for a week where so many people are already on vacation. I think MPW will move solidly into the $20s soon. :-)
Based on jump in NFFO this business should be at least $25 by Q2 this year. Div increase will follow once the dust settles. MPW is opportunistic on acquiring new assets when valuations are attractive today. Why distribute more when you can make accretive acquisitions today!
Do you think the dividend is safe?
Not that they will……but MPW could raise the quarterly payout by 2 cents instead of one cent in January. With their FFO of $1.84……..a $1.20 payout is very reasonable. Sure would help getting the stock to that $26 price target. :-)
"MPW is on every Baby Boomer list of stocks to buy I’ve seen. Income and income growth. 10,000 Baby Boomers are retiring in the US every day. This is a powerful demographic......and MPW is right in the thick of it. Dominion “D” is on those lists too.....and their stock is trading $2.00 above 52 week price targets. I think MPW is headed to $18.....and will still have a big payout. Keep this one."
BUY BUY BUY
6% yield doesn't mean much when your TOTAL RETURN is seriously negative.
"Same price it was 2 yrs ago, look at it go, bwahhh."
"Lets see! in April the pps was 22.64, in June it was 21.97 in early Sept it was 21.92. We had the Motley Fool pumping the stock every day and now the pps is 20.21. Does anybody else see what a massive pump and dump this was. Then you have all the o called stockholders saying how much they enjoy the dividend. Well they got $1.12 per shre in dividends and the pps went down $2.43. What a great deal!. The morale of the story is when you see Motley or Zacks pump a particular stock, in my opinion, run for your life."
Institutional ownership has grown a lot this year.
"Around 7% in price appreciation vs over 36% for the market last 52 weeks. You can count those dividends until the cows come home, but this will still be a lame-o performer."
Why does this stock fall on good news? What does management have to do to get a little capital gains for the shareholders?
Medical Properties Trust to Invest $950 Million in Behavioral Health PlatformAnyone know how Mpw is paying for this? Stock or credit?
"Is Jefferies right this time? MPW was upgraded by Jefferies Financial Group from a “hold” rating to a “buy” rating in a research report issued on Wednesday with $23.00 target price up from their previous target price of $18.00. Jefferies last down graded MPW to ""buy"" from ""hold"" on 7/17/2018 when it was trading at 14.18. So are they right this time? They were wrong last time. What say you?"
MPW already pays a 6% dividend......and they have the FFO to raise it. Investors will figure this out. MPW should trade in the mid-$20s. :-)
Jon Najarian mentioned MPW for unusual option activity. Look at the Dec 19 calls. It's rare to hear the Najarians pick up on a REIT.
A new intra-day high. I wonder if the 2019 deal pipeline is paying out. On the last call Aldag said “We have begun 2019 by immediately executing the growth plans .... we expect to (have) several major acquisitions in 2019. We have continued growing our acquisition pipeline and look forward to capitalizing on diverse and accretive opportunities through the coming year.”
Not a stock you will get rich quick on... and I'm fine with that. Low risk at this price.
Over 21 mil shares short on the wrong side of this trade! Should see $23

"Deutsche Bank Adjusts Price Target on Medical Properties Trust to $27 From $25, Maintains Buy Rating06/03/2021 8:18:53 AM ET - MT Newswires"
Argus Research just raised MPW price target to $27.00 per share.
Has anyone heard from Blabberwonky?
Averaging in. My last batch at $13.11. I'll keep this for the long term.
"So my 2 favorite REITs are MPW and FCPT. Both play off of the aging population demographic shift. Both have great management, investment grade books of business......and so on. Anyhow.......FCPT is trading over $30 per share, having a nice $1.20 per year payout. MPW is trading at $23 with a nice $1.04 per year payout. But MPW has more FFO than even FCPT. Maybe I’m being too simplistic......but MPW can easily run the payout up to $1.20 per year and trade at $30+ too. When’s the next dividend announcement? :-)"
I expect if there were a problem we would have seen a cut in the divi. With an increase in elective surgeries and many returning to see their drs face to face is certainly a positive. Wouldn’t mind if Reddit cashes in on the caves short position!
I have been in MPW since the low 11'2 several years ago. I have always felt it should be much higher as the hospital business seems to me to be an essential piece of everyones life. I am long
"Bought some today, seems like it is time for the good stocks to recover. Apple Kroger Clorox doping well. Not everyone is going down the tubes, some will make record profits"
Wait for $16 folks it will be here before you know it !
"For a 2 week period during the Arab Oil Embargo, you could buy a 5 year Jumbo Bank CD that paid 17.5%. I know this because I went with my father as he bought 5 of them. I still have the free beach towels he got with each one. A week later the same Jumbos we’re paying 8%……5.5% a year later. Always be ready for unusual market opportunities. :-)"
MPW kicks A5&....10 days down
"With FFO moving to over $1.60 per share, MPW can raise their payout substantially. I think the market will figure this out and take the stock to the mid $20s.......where it belongs. :-)"
"Motley Fool says""MPW Medical Properties Trust is much healthier than it looksThe medical profession was particularly hard-hit during the COVID-19 pandemic, but hospitals continued to pay rent. That's why Medical Properties Trust's shares are up slightly over the past year. The company, a real estate investment trust (REIT), owns and leases hospitals, and is the second-largest owner of hospital space in the United States. It owns 390 properties in 34 U.S. states and nine countries.Anyone who bought stock in the company at the beginning of 2008 and sold it at the beginning of 2011 would have seen a return of 43.9%, counting dividends. And as for the 2020 recession, the company said revenue through the first nine months was $538.2 million, up 53% year over year. More importantly, funds from operations (FFO) were a reported $565 million, up 51% over the same period in 2019, and adjusted FFO was $476 million, up 49.7%. While many stocks plummeted between Feb. 12 and March 12 of last year, Medical Properties Trust fell just 18%.Investors have done well with Medical Properties Trust. Since the company's initial public offering in 2005, its stock has returned 454% (including dividends). That's compared with the S&P 500's 286% in the same period. The dividend yields 5.14% and has been increased every year for the past eight years.In its third-quarter report, the company said it has collected 100% of its fourth-quarter rent and interest payments from tenants. Most of the company's leases are long-term absolute net leases, in which the tenants bear all costs -- maintenance, repairs, utilities, and taxes, as well as regular inflation-based rent-price increases."""
"REITs are taking off. Look at FCPT. Investors are beginning to move into income and income growth stocks. MPW offers both, plus rapid growth, which should bring share price appreciation........and a wonderful total return. :-)"
Still making acquisitions and adding more to portfolio at attractive valuations (assuming covid had any impact). No gloomy outlook or risks on liquidity.
6 months lows today. Might double my position if it falls further 
"I think my hospital is making tons of money on Covid. They are doing free 3 day results tests, and $285 fifteen minute results tests. Everybody is doing the $285 test. I think they are doing at least 600 per day with 4 people working the business in a tent in the parking lot."
OT Good co i made some money over the years on MPW and sold last year. Tony a smart guy likes this stock. But for yield and cap appreciation now i would prefer ABBV at the current pps who now has a yield of 5% and likely will hit 125-130 next years as investors realize that their drugs in the pipe line will offset imo Humira coming off patent in 2023 plus in 7yrs time their being Abbv dividend will likely double again which in today terms would give you a yield of 10% cost basis. As always please do your own DD.
Back to $18-$20 in 1 month. Yield is too compelling at these levels for Medical Properties that are in demand and stable leases.
Why do I hold this?
"REITs are going get more attention......Our Fed will probably cut rates 50 basis points in September or maybe even sooner. 6% dividends, especially if they are growing, will be what investors will be looking for. :-)"
"Down again. Almost 11 months of doing nothing now....but, that great dividend, lol."

"Bought my first ever piece of MPW today at $20.27. That gives me a nice 5.5% dividend yield to start with. I like the global diversification from MPW a lot. 57.6% US, 22.4% UK, 6.3% Germany, 6.0% Switzerland, 4.7% Australia, 1.0% Spain, 2.0% other. Will buy more. Just getting started."
"Have been in this for years.....yes it fluctuates, depending on news and other factors, including the price of tea in China it seems. But have never regretted buying it, and I buy the dips like anyone with a brain would with a hospital-related stock.....and I totally enjoy the divs."
"Amazing, the monuMENTAL lack of financial acumen coming from some who claim to be invested in the markets. Instead of realizing a ""buy the dip"" opportunity as MPT takes full advantage to expand their footprint and scale their business for reasonable prices, just the opposite is expressed. Hopefully the weak hands will move on and their idle jibber jabber with them. GLTA longs who know this is a cornerstone company."
"Most REITs pay out about 80% of their FFO to their shareholders. MPW’s FFO is projected by the company to be $1,57 per share. $1.57 x 80% = $1.26. I think we are headed for “Historic Dividend Growth”."
"Looking good, rofl."
Time to buy. $1.84 per share NFFO. Improved balance sheet.
Just received my $2800 dividend.
"It’s been a good year for MPW. They have addressed some important credit quality issues.....and 2019 should be good too. The CEO says dividend growth in 2019 will be “historic”. I’m excited about that. 10,000 Baby Boomers are retiring Every Day in the US. They not only need income and income growth, but they will also fill up MPW hospitals. It’s a double demographic dip. :-)"
First ever print with a $17 handle tomorrow? I think that would be very nice.
And like clockwork I will be paid dividends tomorrow....ahh the peace of dividend stocks 
"MPW should be yielding about 4.4% based on the credit quality of their partners and tenants. With a $1.08 annual payout.....the stock should trade for about $24 per share. FCPT is investment grade, pays out 4.1%, ($1.15) and trades for $28 per share."
"Not a typical boring REIT, this company is focused on growing their healthcare property portfolios. Could be an excellent bounce back year as Covid wanes and all the surgical procedures put on hold, come back with a vengeance. Stay long."
"I don't think MPW execs ever expected to get $1.3B at 3.5%. Hold your shares, this is going higher."
Jabberwonky's portfolio is 10% MPW. he knows he loves this company. That's why he's on this board 24/7. Buy and HOLD
MPW will announce the next quarterly dividend in 3 weeks. Maybe they will surprise everybody by raising it a Penny. You never know. They certainly can afford to do it…….for the Widows and Orphans. :-)
"omg, basically flat over the last year...but that big dividend, haha."
"Dividend is very high, I can only buy more under 20$,just like the Swiss National Bank does"
"I have this and OHI, down on both, wondering when I should double my position (DCA)"
A lot of wonderful stories on the stock. But it goes nowhere!!! and that is where the rubber meets the road￼￼
There is no visible reason for this continued dropping of the PPS anymore than there was for unusual rise a few weeks ago ahead of this sell off.
"With a $1.08 dividend and 4.2% yield, MPW would be trading over $26 per share. See FCPT as a comp. FCPT trades at $29.50 with a $1.15 dividend and 4% yield. :-)"
I think by Thanksgiving MPW stock price will smash through its all time high

"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/simon-property-misses-3q-sales-123705275.html...and this is BEFORE the current US nationwide C19 explosion. An amazing short at this altitude. And for those who were ready to hang their hat on #SPG with rumors of a flip to AMZN fulfillment centers, perhaps check into what sq. ft. valuations look like for active retail anchors vs warehouse space. I do think this will be a profitable spec @ $US40-50 if they can weather the challenges of the next year. They are well positioned IF they can stay afloat. No way is the principal risk worth the dividend. Seek current income in a less volatile, more diversified REIT like #MPW."
I’ve owned this stock for a couple years now. Question for the group: does anyone run a stop loss or is this a hold forever and to just buy the dips? As long as management continues to make good decisions of course.
99% rent collection. 38 cents per share FFO. Fantastic. :-)
"I tried to tell you months ago to sell, it was folding. This hack dividend stock is the same price it was in 2019, lol."
"Every couple of years, MPW inexplicably drops until the yield is 6%. That’s the signal to load up for the next wave up."
Check out the time stamp on these texts. Lol
"Based on the information MPW released yesterday, you have the financing complete for the Australian deal and headed for a May vote and closure in about 6 weeks. $2.5 Billion to be added to the book of business. They say $1.56 NFFO for 2019, after 31 cents in Q1. This would put the quarterly NFFO at 40 cents per quarter for the next 3 quarters. Based on an 80% payout of the 1.56.......MPW could, if they wanted to, raise the dividend to $1.25 and still be within customary guidelines. That would be “Historic Dividend Growth”. And on top of that, they say they have another $2.5 Billion in deals in the pipeline to fill this up. I assume The Analysts following MPW know all this. I expect to hear some positive comments. FCPT pays out 80% of NFFO.......$1.15 per year. FCPT stock trades for $28.50. Maybe MPW should too. :-)"
Today’s pump! Look at OGN
Big Boyz are out and dumping the more the Fed speaks. Chart is broken as is all REITS. Heading down to $16 level.
Why so much debt?
This is just a savings account for me.
Please take MPW to $18 (200 day MA) so I can load up the truck !! My truck bed is open
I own 13 REITs and they all ignored the recent correction. They have also ignored rising interest rates.
"Am I calculating it correctly that the expected #$%$500 gain on the German joint venture announced this morning will add $1.61/share of earnings for the current quarter? I got that using the current Euro-US rate of 1.18 Dollars per Euro then dividing by the 364,737,000 shares outstanding (that's the last share count I can find). If I got that correct, this is going to be a fun few days to watch MPW share price and I can't wait to see whether they increase the dividend next time around or maybe declare a special dividend later in the year after the deal closes in Q3."
Read the CC transcript. This is a growth company. They’re smashing it. :-)
The sell-off tomorrow will be even worse. Still dropping after hours.
MPW going to incur a long term gain of $1.20/share on this deal.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/medical-properties-trust-macquarie-infrastructure-120000148.html
"MPW has increasing FFO, increasing dividends, and currently yields 8%. And there is room for futuredividend increases. What's not to like? I own a decent number of shares and am trying to figureout what is negative about MPW that should stand in my way of buying more. Anyone know of any reasons thatshould prevent me from buying more?"
There are fundamental changes taking place with MPW that will take the share price to the $16 range. You’ll see. :-)
Dividend increase to 28 cents per Quarter.......$1.12 per year. Thanks for the 4% raise. Twice the rate of inflation. Let’s do this again in September.
"Do any of you investors in MPW know who is Steward Health Care is? FYI-They are the largest physician-led, private, for profit health care network in the U.S. They also operate the largest number of MPW owned hospitals in the US. These are the guys paying rent to MWP."
The CEO sold some shares no big deal as they all do regularly. The coming slowdown in the economy will not touch MPW because of their triple net rentals (No liability for maintenance) in Medical buildings only is rock solid. The Baby Boomers are now using more and more medical services as the age curve becomes older and the US population also continues to grow. Expansion in Australia and elsewhere is also a big plus. Buy lease back collect rent its a powerful simple formula when the underlying real estate is Medical Buildings. Dividend is secure and will rise with acquisitions.
"I want to buy more MPW, this is a Good conservative bet!"
"This is one of my “nothing fancy” holds to keep me from gambling all my chips. Good div, sound biz. I’m long."
MPW is like a 5.25% bond with a 4% annual cost of living adjustment. It’s perpetually undervalued........which makes it easy to add more. :-)
"75% of MPW is owned by institutions. Most REITs are like this. With 10,000 Baby Boomers retiring every day, needing income and income growth I expect more individual investors will enter the REIT space. MPW is one of my favorite stocks. I own 24,000 shares now. The total return has been fantastic."
Best stock right now in my portfolio good growth and dividend what else can you ask for!
Most recent?
MPW closed the UK Hospital deal. Now they can begin collecting rents to boost their FFO and raise their payout.....to me. :-)
"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/medical-properties-trust-declares-regular-201000908.html#MPW is the go-to in a market awash in uncertainty. Surprised that analysts have not jumped on this in a larger way. Consistent price action, cheap relative to the market, a dividend of close to 6% and a sector that will survive and thrive in C19 land. Forget retail and park your cash in this healthcare facility REIT. Solid and room for growth."
Argus maintains Buy rating on MPW......raises Price Target to $26.00 per share.
There’s a global search for yield and income growth. MPW offers both. :-)
"I think MPW will be trading at $23 to $24 by the end of August. The dividend will be $1.08 per share, and the dividend yield will be about 4.3%. The quality of MPW’s earnings and counterparties do not warrant a 5.5% dividend. We are in a low interest rate environment. 4% is an exceptional dividend yield."
I just love the 8% payout here. MPW has a very solid book of business. I have no idea why the stock trades at such a huge discount. But it has for years and years. Baby Boomers should be eating this up. :-)
MPW has raised the payout the last two years in March. Probably to be announced in late February. Should find out what “historic year for dividend growth” means. :-)
MPW is in a very sweet spot. There is high demand for income and income growth. If MPW just uses some of that nice new $1.60 FFO to boost their payout.....the stock will be at $25 per share very quickly. :-)
"Blackrock & Vanguard hold over 230 M shares. I realize they have to puttheir cash some place. I'm 71 yrs. old, of my friends that are still alive, ourconversations always, and I can honestly say always, discuss health issues.Can you guess if I'm sort or long?"
21 mil shares short! Who is selling?
"MPW will announce the Q1 dividend on or about February 18th. Everybody is used to the one penny per Quarter increase……..but MPW is running $1.84 NFFO. Just a payout of 70% is $1.29. MPW currently pays out $1.12. So yes, I’m looking for 2 cents per quarter. I’m a loyal MPW shareholder. Sharing is Caring."
Analysts are paid to upgrade/downgrade stocks!
"There's a concern about losses from Steward--""Steward accounted for 30% of Medical Properties Trust’s revenue last year. Steward lost more than $400 million in 2020 and reported nearly $1 billion of unpaid supplier expenses and other bills, the documents show. The company also faces audits by the Internal Revenue Service and state authorities."""
6.2% yield......and the CEO says 2019 will be a historic year for dividend growth. The share price should be headed much higher. :-)
"Is there news that this stock is reacting to, can seem to find anything and buying more without understanding the drop is not something I am comfortable with."
"getting ready to retire in 4 years. I have 1000 shares of MSFT , 2000 shares of V and 3,800 shares (and counting) of MPW"
CEO says 2019 will be a Record year for Dividend Growth.......Yikes! This should be trading in the $20s.
Tough day. Fed Speak. Average price target for MPW raised from $21.88 to $22.08 today. That good. :-)
"MPW has plenty of NFFO to raise the payout substantially. At some point, they will do this. Right now, knowing that they can will need to provide that good feeling. :-)"
"Bought 5 shares today, I'm excited to own this REIT and add a medical REIT to my portfolio. I feel this could easily go to $26 in the future or even $30. I'll buy some now and just average down in the future (Hold for the long term and hopefully get a sweet 10% yield on cost in about 20 years)"
"I get it it. MPW has rapid growth, high dividend income, and high dividend growth. This is the stock for the 10,000 Baby Boomers who are retiring every day. And I think it’s still undervalued compared to their peers. Great Company. :-)"
MPW is looking good. I sense a Fed Rate Cut coming. Probably 2 before the end of the year. :-)
"Wait and buy it at $17 bucks, haha."
"This has the post-dividend blues, but such an extremely highly rated stock cannot stay down for long. Bargain price at this point..."
"Numbers out 1.65- 1.68 ffo projected looking good for the promised historic dividend growth. Promises made, promises kept?"
So if you bought today you got the divi?
"If MPW raises the quarterly payout one cent every 6 months, I would be very happy. :-)"
"What about that dividend, amazing. This thing needs to learn the meaning of total return."
"Yes, the UK purchase looks good. Yes I'm bullish. No, I'll wait to add, as history suggests they'll imminently move to fund the needed $2 Billion in some fashion. Bonds, preferred shares, common shares, no matter how, the price will be squashed a bit temporarily. That'll be your cue to add shares."
Low volume = few buyers and sellers = takes les volume to sway price up or down—-VZ MILLIONS AND MPW THOUSANDSVOLUMNE
"got in around 5 years ago at 12.54 and keep adding every time drop at least $2.00....safe stock,good dividend and baby boomers means $$$$"
Am I missing something here? Its headed all the way back to the lows again before the great news? Okay MM's please help.
"Take advantage of a dip below 20. If you cancel out the noise and doing some actual research on the company, you will find it's a screaming buy long term."
Regular Dividend Declared……..28 cents. No increase. Shelter in place. Next Quarter.
Getting worse as day goes on. Tried to tell you to sell when all of that volume came in with large sell orders. This will do good to finish flat this year.
Smells fishy today ! MPW tanking for no reason?
on Friday MPW made up for my losses from Microsoft and Visa
"10,000 Baby Boomers are retiring every day just in the US. They need income. They also need hip replacement and bypass surgery. MPW is a Win-Win stock as simple demographics puts it in the sweet spot of the exploding aging of America play. :-)"
OT Tony some of your near term picks enb and abbv have not worked out so well truth be told. I know you made money long term but remember you saying abbv should be 30 points higher at 80 then you recently sold some. Enb just goes straight down.But your tech picks are stellar.
Soooooo cheap compared to others in the sector!
Quality earnings. I think bonuses are tied into stock performance. Looking for 20+ by years end imho. Good luck.
Guess we will not be hearing from Blabberwonky today.
"Wow, some fussy and pessimistic posts for an up day. Sound like unhappy Rumpers. I'm getting 6+ % div on my original investment, some cap gains, and a reasonably optimistic future. What's not to like? Long term hold for me."
MPW’s niche market and 15 year net lease contracts make it a huge buy at these levels. Solid company in medical properties with minimal exposure to short term rate changes. https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/kenkam/2017/06/29/top-reit-manager-sam-miklosko-evaluates-medical-properties-trust/amp/
"This is a $20 stock,just hang in there. I bought t at $10. Holding on to a load of it. Get a great dividend just sitting back and enjoying it!!! How can you miss.Best wishe, Lou"
MPW always sells off when they announce a big transaction. It always recovers quickly. They said today’s Billion dollar deal will be accretive from day one. That’s good. :-)
Average price target now $24.62. High target $27. :-)
Investors are adding MPW for the excellent income and income growth. Total return is the name of this game. :-)
"Have had this on and off for years. Yes, the thing fluctuates, but it is generally up, and the div is nice. I have regretted it every time I sold. It is a staple in my retirement divs."
MPW up nearly 1% today. Blabberwonky can take the weekend off to heal his wounds.
"For this to go wrong, you need to believe that hospitals will fail on rent payments. They are under a little stress given revenues form covid-focused treatment. But that’s not a catalyst for a collapse of a hospital. This thing will maintain value long term. And funds are flocking into healthy Reits, partly because it’s a safer bet than any other place industry."
"Oh look, it's down again. Imagine that. Enjoy ;)"
"Anybody notice the CEO, COO, and CFO selling hundreds of thousands of shares in the last couple days? I have a good number of shares so I haven't added or reduced my position in many years, except for div reinvestment. I always thought management had a good understanding of the business so the recent selling has me worried. I would hate to shed any shares right now without a legit reason to do so. Does anyone know of issues (maybe overseas) that might be affecting our tenants?"
Be looking for news on 2 joint ventures over the next few weeks. The CEO believes they will increase the credit quality of MPW’s portfolio and show how undervalued MPW’s stock is. I’m all ears. :-)
This is just a long term hold. Be sure to reinvest dividends.
"I own several REIT-type investments, MPW, NLY, OHI, NMFC. All took a beating today, so I have to believe this is all about sector rotation, which may continue for a while. These are all good companies, with solid track records and experienced managers. Not worried about the divs, but the price dips are unnerving for sure."
"A large amount of REIT stocks are held in ETFs. When those funds are faced with overwhelming redemption requests, they must sell their REIT stocks at any price. They have no choice. That’s what’s been happening. This is why the markets are tanking. :-)"
"37 cents NFFO......96% of April rents collected and the CEO sees that 96% continuing. That’s really, really good. No reason for MPW to be under $23.....IMO. Best of Class company and tenants. Very Cool."
should we load up today for Monday open
"Shorts in control with Market Makers in cahoots. Have you ever seen a MM force the price up until somebody sells. No! It is always force the price down until somebody sells. There job is to force trades tokeep Nasdaq happy. I think that is the way it works, I could be wrong.However, when a company continually pays out more than they make eventually the shorts will pounce and it looks like that is what happened here."
"Next stop 19.40....get ready for an even bigger dividend yield, haha."
Wells Fargo upgraded MPW yesterday. :-)
"Big day tomorrow. Should see a dividend increase......and learn more about the Australia deal. MPW is now a major player in the US, Germany and Australia."
"You all just thought it was gonna stay green, look at that huge sell-off at days end. This thing folded bad."
"FCPT reported NFFO of 38 cents. Pays a $1.29 dividend, and trades for $29 per share. MPW reports 43 cents NFFO. Pays $1.12 dividend and trades for $20. That’s Crazy."
if it drops to 19.6 I will add to my position. This will be well above $20 next week.
"Have held this for several years....cost basis around $10 per share. I have a feeling hospitals will still be around after COVID-19. That ""aging population"" thing is not changing. Good luck."
All time high very soon
Comments on earnings?
Over 22 mil shares short leaning heavily on share price as they got whipsawed when co. Raised earnings guidance! The VNQ is only down 0.77% and MPW is down 1.90%. Buy more . Ex divi 9/14
Sure looks like take-off time. $1.60 in FFO. This stock should be trading in the mid-20s. Or higher. :-)
Today is going to be interesting after Friday
"It's went down 13% since I told you all to sell. Remember, I said it was going to 19.40, and look at it flop. Might as well face it, this one is a goner."
With 95% rent collection this should not be this low. Belongs in the $20's.
"They declared a dividend, haha. What they should do is declare some Total Return."
"Healthcare is far from struggling ! Their only struggle is to keep up with the never ending job of healthcare and as far as this stock is concerned there is no Good reason this stock shouldn't be at $21.00 at this time ! I get the Corona has made an impact but has not stopped MPW from collecting their rent and should be in a great financial situation strapped with loads of cash while also paying off and debt they might have incurred because of the Covid ! Most people have either returned to work or are working from home and businesses such as healthcare has not suffered a downturn but an upswing in higher volume added to the normal everyday business of healthcare ! MPW is in a great buisness with a service that has not had to deal with losing revenue ,if anything they were in a great position compared to other reits that own Movie theaters and gyms that lost out during the pandemic ! MPW owns only medical property's and in a society of peoples well being this is by most one of the best investments to be in in my opinion because of it,s solid portfolio and business model and the need to have more Sq footage for Medical related campuses throuout not only the U.S. but in also different parts of the world !"
Another giant dividend check coming in April. Thanks! I love this yield. :-)
Also added yesterday. That is what multi millionaires do which is add on weakness. Looking for a big raise this year in dividend income from MPW. Best of luck to all longs.
"Should we be concerned about the recent big sales by the CEO, COO, and CFO?"
"Curious. Down 2% on a day when we get the first analyst upgrade this year?I hope I am wrong, but I fear another dilutive secondary in the wind.I am a long term holder, generally happy with their performance but rank their lack of public information a D+.Transparency is not important to Mr Airbag."
"REITs provide natural protection against inflation. Real estate rents and values tend to increase when prices do, due in part to the fact that many leases are tied to inflation. This supports REIT dividend growth and provides a reliable stream of income even during inflationary periods."
Have a buy in at $12.40. Long term hold.
MPW is being revalued after improving the credit quality of their book of business. Compare MPW to FCPT. (investment grade) MPW should be trading in the $20s.
"The MPW 5.2% yield is mentioned today in Barron's Cover Story ""How to Generate Income in Retirement With Dividend Stocks"""
I am really amazed that this healthcare REIT has held up so nicely. Other healthcare REITs haven't fared so well.
"The current consensus for MPW is “Outperform” with a price target of $20,65........up from $19.40 two months ago. :-)"
12% of the stock in short position. 14 days to cover. And the CEO says the stock is significantly undervalued.
Bought this in the mid teens and very happy with the total return. I’m guessing a divi hike next year and a move to mid $20’s.
Lets see! A year ago MPW was $17 and the yield was over 6%. So an 18+% share price gain AND a 6% divi !!Total (return) THAT up!!!Measure in years not weeks or months. A pump and dump? seriously? Try another lie-ne.GLTA longs who have been generously rewarded year after year after year.Ignore the blind naysayers.
"So,what price are they offering to sell the 50mil shares at? Market? Discount?"
This is a $1.2 Billion deal. That will yield 8.6%. MPW grows. Any stress to the shareprice will be short lived. This is how MPW grows its FFO. :-)
