Why does this stock fall on good news? What does management have to do to get a little capital gains for the shareholders?
"REITs are taking off. Look at FCPT. Investors are beginning to move into income and income growth stocks. MPW offers both, plus rapid growth, which should bring share price appreciation........and a wonderful total return. :-)"
"They declared a dividend, haha. What they should do is declare some Total Return."
"A large amount of REIT stocks are held in ETFs. When those funds are faced with overwhelming redemption requests, they must sell their REIT stocks at any price. They have no choice. That’s what’s been happening. This is why the markets are tanking. :-)"
"Most REITs have been going down lately after a long rally. Seems like basic consolidation, below 20 is good for accumulation here imo."
"Basically the same price it was in Sept 2019, talk about Total Return.,."
MPW has raised the payout the last two years in March. Probably to be announced in late February. Should find out what “historic year for dividend growth” means. :-)
Below 20? Big buy
Lets see! A year ago MPW was $17 and the yield was over 6%. So an 18+% share price gain AND a 6% divi !!Total (return) THAT up!!!Measure in years not weeks or months. A pump and dump? seriously? Try another lie-ne.GLTA longs who have been generously rewarded year after year after year.Ignore the blind naysayers.
BUY at $19-$20 coming soon in September draw down
"9-30-2020 One year ago today share price was $17.40-60s.Now add in the dividends.That's called 'total return"""
"FCPT reported NFFO of 38 cents. Pays a $1.29 dividend, and trades for $29 per share. MPW reports 43 cents NFFO. Pays $1.12 dividend and trades for $20. That’s Crazy."
MPW will be down another 30-50c tomorrow as ex divvy date hits stock
"Long term holder. Over 7 years. Just increased common by 25%. I expect another modest dividend increase at anniversary of last and continued free cash flow growth.Fully expect $25 within 6 months, once this is fashionable again."
"I am pleased with the news of the Euro bond offering. We replace 4% debt with <1% debt. What is not to like?Also pleased with the rate, seems like MPW for the first time is benefiting from an improved profile of a heavyweight. Curious why we seem to do this better in Euro world than US market?Far better alternative to a never ending supply of common that comes along with 5% div cost.I hope we can do more of this. Even with longer maturities. Both US and Euro.Good job guys!"
"Yes, the UK purchase looks good. Yes I'm bullish. No, I'll wait to add, as history suggests they'll imminently move to fund the needed $2 Billion in some fashion. Bonds, preferred shares, common shares, no matter how, the price will be squashed a bit temporarily. That'll be your cue to add shares."
"I own several REIT-type investments, MPW, NLY, OHI, NMFC. All took a beating today, so I have to believe this is all about sector rotation, which may continue for a while. These are all good companies, with solid track records and experienced managers. Not worried about the divs, but the price dips are unnerving for sure."
This stock looks like to have great upside potential with great earnings!!
"When you check insider selling the officers have been selling off big time for most of 2021. Obvious to me the officers don't give a damn about raising the value of MPW to its investors. This and the fact that they pay a dividend that is more than earning was certainly picked by the shorts. How low this might go, I don't know, but management, IMO, is certainly not helping"
Looking so great with that juicy dividend. haha. This thing looks like it needs to go to the hospital itself…
"Based on the information MPW released yesterday, you have the financing complete for the Australian deal and headed for a May vote and closure in about 6 weeks. $2.5 Billion to be added to the book of business. They say $1.56 NFFO for 2019, after 31 cents in Q1. This would put the quarterly NFFO at 40 cents per quarter for the next 3 quarters. Based on an 80% payout of the 1.56.......MPW could, if they wanted to, raise the dividend to $1.25 and still be within customary guidelines. That would be “Historic Dividend Growth”. And on top of that, they say they have another $2.5 Billion in deals in the pipeline to fill this up. I assume The Analysts following MPW know all this. I expect to hear some positive comments. FCPT pays out 80% of NFFO.......$1.15 per year. FCPT stock trades for $28.50. Maybe MPW should too. :-)"
"Just added little bit more, thank you"
"Motley Fool says""MPW Medical Properties Trust is much healthier than it looksThe medical profession was particularly hard-hit during the COVID-19 pandemic, but hospitals continued to pay rent. That's why Medical Properties Trust's shares are up slightly over the past year. The company, a real estate investment trust (REIT), owns and leases hospitals, and is the second-largest owner of hospital space in the United States. It owns 390 properties in 34 U.S. states and nine countries.Anyone who bought stock in the company at the beginning of 2008 and sold it at the beginning of 2011 would have seen a return of 43.9%, counting dividends. And as for the 2020 recession, the company said revenue through the first nine months was $538.2 million, up 53% year over year. More importantly, funds from operations (FFO) were a reported $565 million, up 51% over the same period in 2019, and adjusted FFO was $476 million, up 49.7%. While many stocks plummeted between Feb. 12 and March 12 of last year, Medical Properties Trust fell just 18%.Investors have done well with Medical Properties Trust. Since the company's initial public offering in 2005, its stock has returned 454% (including dividends). That's compared with the S&P 500's 286% in the same period. The dividend yields 5.14% and has been increased every year for the past eight years.In its third-quarter report, the company said it has collected 100% of its fourth-quarter rent and interest payments from tenants. Most of the company's leases are long-term absolute net leases, in which the tenants bear all costs -- maintenance, repairs, utilities, and taxes, as well as regular inflation-based rent-price increases."""
"10,000 Baby Boomers are retiring every day just in the US. They need income. They also need hip replacement and bypass surgery. MPW is a Win-Win stock as simple demographics puts it in the sweet spot of the exploding aging of America play. :-)"
Will it hold?
Low volume = few buyers and sellers = takes les volume to sway price up or down—-VZ MILLIONS AND MPW THOUSANDSVOLUMNE
"It's went down 13% since I told you all to sell. Remember, I said it was going to 19.40, and look at it flop. Might as well face it, this one is a goner."
"Ultimately, imho, private equity owns this. Must make them sick seeing that dividend payout that could go into their pockets. Timeline 5-10 years."
6% yield doesn't mean much when your TOTAL RETURN is seriously negative.
Stock dilution is here
"The games played on this stock are interesting. First several of the board recommend it for its solid dividend, positive earnings, good growth etc along with, I believe, Zack and Motely. So I am sure several people followed the lead and bought. THE PUMP! But a funny thing happened. Insider transactions were negative and large, nobody was buying and for a company whose stock is owned 80% by institutions you would think, if the stock is so great, some would be buying. Nope! didn't happen. The pps just kept slipping.Shorting shows up as a sale so the more an institution shorts the more it looks like their selling. I am unaware of a way to get daily up to the minute shorting info, but I imagine it increased. THE DUMP!Happens over and over again. I own another stock that Motely has began to push. I will be selling out soon!"
I’ve owned this stock for a couple years now. Question for the group: does anyone run a stop loss or is this a hold forever and to just buy the dips? As long as management continues to make good decisions of course.
The CEO sold some shares no big deal as they all do regularly. The coming slowdown in the economy will not touch MPW because of their triple net rentals (No liability for maintenance) in Medical buildings only is rock solid. The Baby Boomers are now using more and more medical services as the age curve becomes older and the US population also continues to grow. Expansion in Australia and elsewhere is also a big plus. Buy lease back collect rent its a powerful simple formula when the underlying real estate is Medical Buildings. Dividend is secure and will rise with acquisitions.
"Not a typical boring REIT, this company is focused on growing their healthcare property portfolios. Could be an excellent bounce back year as Covid wanes and all the surgical procedures put on hold, come back with a vengeance. Stay long."
"I tried to tell you months ago to sell, it was folding. This hack dividend stock is the same price it was in 2019, lol."
Regular Dividend Declared……..28 cents. No increase. Shelter in place. Next Quarter.
The sell-off tomorrow will be even worse. Still dropping after hours.
"This is one of my “nothing fancy” holds to keep me from gambling all my chips. Good div, sound biz. I’m long."
"Is Jefferies right this time? MPW was upgraded by Jefferies Financial Group from a “hold” rating to a “buy” rating in a research report issued on Wednesday with $23.00 target price up from their previous target price of $18.00. Jefferies last down graded MPW to ""buy"" from ""hold"" on 7/17/2018 when it was trading at 14.18. So are they right this time? They were wrong last time. What say you?"
"Is this down leg on MPW related to the recent selling pressure on health care stocks, or did a deal fall out of the MPW 2019 forward pipeline? Either way, when to put in another buy?"
Why do I hold this?
Some ppl just can’t handle losing money. There is one on every board.
WARNING! Just make sure you fully understand the tax treatment of this and other similar investments before you buy. These stocks can look great.... until you read the fine print. They can be very expensive traps that are not what they appear to be. I'm neither bullish no bearish. The devil is in the details.
Bought this in the mid teens and very happy with the total return. I’m guessing a divi hike next year and a move to mid $20’s.
MPW will announce the next quarterly dividend in 3 weeks. Maybe they will surprise everybody by raising it a Penny. You never know. They certainly can afford to do it…….for the Widows and Orphans. :-)
No one is losing money Kyle unless you panic and sell.  it’s time to buy MPW as it’s on sale. Very few opportunities arise with this kind of drop. Buy Buy Buy
"Bought my first ever piece of MPW today at $20.27. That gives me a nice 5.5% dividend yield to start with. I like the global diversification from MPW a lot. 57.6% US, 22.4% UK, 6.3% Germany, 6.0% Switzerland, 4.7% Australia, 1.0% Spain, 2.0% other. Will buy more. Just getting started."
"I'm in! Picked up my first 500 @ $19.90 this morning. I'm looking for a total stake of 900, so I will add if there is another pullback to sub $20. I plan on this being a core holding for income and modest growth for a long time."
"Shorts in control with Market Makers in cahoots. Have you ever seen a MM force the price up until somebody sells. No! It is always force the price down until somebody sells. There job is to force trades tokeep Nasdaq happy. I think that is the way it works, I could be wrong.However, when a company continually pays out more than they make eventually the shorts will pounce and it looks like that is what happened here."
"Any ideas where yahoo finance gets a negative 24 percent yearly gain in earnings for the next 5 years? I’d predict positive 10 percent plus based on babyboomer health woes, not negative growth? Your forecast?"
All time high very soon
Soooooo cheap compared to others in the sector!
$1.68 annual NFFO. That’s incredible. MPW can easily raise the dividend by 20%.
"Lets see! in April the pps was 22.64, in June it was 21.97 in early Sept it was 21.92. We had the Motley Fool pumping the stock every day and now the pps is 20.21. Does anybody else see what a massive pump and dump this was. Then you have all the o called stockholders saying how much they enjoy the dividend. Well they got $1.12 per shre in dividends and the pps went down $2.43. What a great deal!. The morale of the story is when you see Motley or Zacks pump a particular stock, in my opinion, run for your life."
Based on jump in NFFO this business should be at least $25 by Q2 this year. Div increase will follow once the dust settles. MPW is opportunistic on acquiring new assets when valuations are attractive today. Why distribute more when you can make accretive acquisitions today!
Have been in this for many years. Never regretted it....it's solid.
Go Joe go.
"If you look at the transactions by the officers you see they are a big part of why the downward pressureexists. When management sells it is hard to justify buying in.Also 0ver 80% of the float is owned by institutions. Maybe some are trimming their investment in MPW, but you have to ask why. It would seem that the working model for MPW would be good even during an inflationary period. Why MPW can't get traction I don't know, but signals from management aren't helping."
getting my chance to add more. My original buy was at 17.72 in my ROTH. I dont see a reason why its down? Income long stock for me. Beats the heck out of any MM or bond etc..... They collected over 95% during the worst of this pandemic. I say its safe and a good bet for long term core holding. My guess is it will get to 20+ shortly.
"Last year, MPT had a FFO of 1.30 for the year and the stock finished the year at almost $21 per share. Before the market dislocation, the stock went to $24 for a 14% increase. The first quarter results MPT had a FFO of $0.37 share and the company reafirmed a FFO in the $1.60 to $1.65 range for. $1.60 for 2020. This FFO is a 23% increase over the previous year. Yet the stock is trading at $16.50 or 21% lower value than the first of the year. The hospital operators are paying their rent. This stock appears to be way undervalued based on the projected minimum FFO of $1.60. BTW the first quarter FFO would have been about $0.40 per share if the new lease rate was applied to the English hospitals that were recently purchased. This stock hopefully will be trading back at $24 before the end of the year."
"This has the post-dividend blues, but such an extremely highly rated stock cannot stay down for long. Bargain price at this point..."
Dividend increase to 28 cents per Quarter.......$1.12 per year. Thanks for the 4% raise. Twice the rate of inflation. Let’s do this again in September.
Just bought another 500 shares this morning under $20 ! Keep em coming.
Jabberwonky's portfolio is 10% MPW. he knows he loves this company. That's why he's on this board 24/7. Buy and HOLD
Over 22 mil shares short leaning heavily on share price as they got whipsawed when co. Raised earnings guidance! The VNQ is only down 0.77% and MPW is down 1.90%. Buy more . Ex divi 9/14
Guess we will not be hearing from Blabberwonky today.
Get your cash ready to lock in a 6% yield. Just 60 cents down from here with a 2 cent dividend hike early next year.
"Not what you hope for right after earnings.Medical Properties Trust Downgraded to Sector Perform From Outperform by RBC, Price Target Trimmed to $23 From $2405/03/2021 9:18:22 AM ET - MT Newswires"
"I have this and OHI, down on both, wondering when I should double my position (DCA)"
"MPW seems stuck in the clutches of shorts. Short volume has increased by ~5MM shares from mid-Aug to mid-Sep, from ~22MM to 27MM.That's a crazy increase and doesn't make sense, so hopefully earnings and forward guidance will induce a short squeeze."
"MPW is on every Baby Boomer list of stocks to buy I’ve seen. Income and income growth. 10,000 Baby Boomers are retiring in the US every day. This is a powerful demographic......and MPW is right in the thick of it. Dominion “D” is on those lists too.....and their stock is trading $2.00 above 52 week price targets. I think MPW is headed to $18.....and will still have a big payout. Keep this one."
"Amazing, the monuMENTAL lack of financial acumen coming from some who claim to be invested in the markets. Instead of realizing a ""buy the dip"" opportunity as MPT takes full advantage to expand their footprint and scale their business for reasonable prices, just the opposite is expressed. Hopefully the weak hands will move on and their idle jibber jabber with them. GLTA longs who know this is a cornerstone company."
it's dropping because our hospital beds are filling up with covid deniers that refuse to get the shots. What did Ron White say?
"Same price it was 2 yrs ago, look at it go, bwahhh."
"MPW just put $6,000 in cash into my brokerage account. Thanks MPW. Let’s do it again in 3 months. :-)"
Last week Argus research raised their PT to $28
Next week on the 14th can’t wait for my huge dividend e payment 
"MPW YTD....hey, look at this great 5% dividend I got....oh, never mind, I lost 5% in share price. Nice sleight of hand there..."
99% rent collection. 38 cents per share FFO. Fantastic. :-)

should we load up today for Monday open
Institutional ownership has grown a lot this year.
Jabberwonky must be the worse stock predictor in the universe. The guy is always wrong :(
"Next stop 19.40....get ready for an even bigger dividend yield, haha."
I'm buying this under 20 and selling portions of my position this over 21 over the past months.
"haha, this stock will never do anything."
"You all just thought it was gonna stay green, look at that huge sell-off at days end. This thing folded bad."
Wait for $16 folks it will be here before you know it !
So if you bought today you got the divi?
I bought more today - and not finished buying yet.
I have been in MPW since the low 11'2 several years ago. I have always felt it should be much higher as the hospital business seems to me to be an essential piece of everyones life. I am long
"Just checking in, look at this bum fold, tried to tell you. Enjoy that dividend."
"Have been in this for years.....yes it fluctuates, depending on news and other factors, including the price of tea in China it seems. But have never regretted buying it, and I buy the dips like anyone with a brain would with a hospital-related stock.....and I totally enjoy the divs."
Check out the time stamp on these texts. Lol
if it drops to 19.6 I will add to my position. This will be well above $20 next week.
"One year return on a Total market etf is over 31%, compare that to lame MPW’s return. Talk about Total Return underperforming…"
"Dividend is very high, I can only buy more under 20$,just like the Swiss National Bank does"
"omg, basically flat over the last year...but that big dividend, haha."
"Hard to imagine the effort put into the pump and dump on this stock when it is owned 80% by institutions and the short interest is about 4+. It seems like the effort wouldn't gain that many more shares from the little people, there are a lot of shares out and some institution wants them all. Sooner or later they will have to start buying to cover shorts and change direction. Of course anybody that put in a stop loss or bought the stock on margin got hammered. Should be over soon. A sure sign will be when Zacks and the Motley Foolstart changing the story."
"Wait and buy it at $17 bucks, haha."
MPW always sells off when they announce a big transaction. It always recovers quickly. They said today’s Billion dollar deal will be accretive from day one. That’s good. :-)
Today is going to be interesting after Friday
Time to buy. $1.84 per share NFFO. Improved balance sheet.
"Every couple of years, MPW inexplicably drops until the yield is 6%. That’s the signal to load up for the next wave up."
"Anybody notice the CEO, COO, and CFO selling hundreds of thousands of shares in the last couple days? I have a good number of shares so I haven't added or reduced my position in many years, except for div reinvestment. I always thought management had a good understanding of the business so the recent selling has me worried. I would hate to shed any shares right now without a legit reason to do so. Does anyone know of issues (maybe overseas) that might be affecting our tenants?"
"The consensus price target for MPW is $23.63. So there’s plenty of room to go higher on the share price. There will be a payout increase soon, while interest rates seem to be dropping. It’s all good. :-)"
1 year dividend growth is 3.7%…won’t even keep up with inflation.
"REITs provide natural protection against inflation. Real estate rents and values tend to increase when prices do, due in part to the fact that many leases are tied to inflation. This supports REIT dividend growth and provides a reliable stream of income even during inflationary periods."
Smells fishy today ! MPW tanking for no reason?
"For a 2 week period during the Arab Oil Embargo, you could buy a 5 year Jumbo Bank CD that paid 17.5%. I know this because I went with my father as he bought 5 of them. I still have the free beach towels he got with each one. A week later the same Jumbos we’re paying 8%……5.5% a year later. Always be ready for unusual market opportunities. :-)"
"I get it it. MPW has rapid growth, high dividend income, and high dividend growth. This is the stock for the 10,000 Baby Boomers who are retiring every day. And I think it’s still undervalued compared to their peers. Great Company. :-)"
BUY BUY BUY
"Healthcare is far from struggling ! Their only struggle is to keep up with the never ending job of healthcare and as far as this stock is concerned there is no Good reason this stock shouldn't be at $21.00 at this time ! I get the Corona has made an impact but has not stopped MPW from collecting their rent and should be in a great financial situation strapped with loads of cash while also paying off and debt they might have incurred because of the Covid ! Most people have either returned to work or are working from home and businesses such as healthcare has not suffered a downturn but an upswing in higher volume added to the normal everyday business of healthcare ! MPW is in a great buisness with a service that has not had to deal with losing revenue ,if anything they were in a great position compared to other reits that own Movie theaters and gyms that lost out during the pandemic ! MPW owns only medical property's and in a society of peoples well being this is by most one of the best investments to be in in my opinion because of it,s solid portfolio and business model and the need to have more Sq footage for Medical related campuses throuout not only the U.S. but in also different parts of the world !"
"New debt sale is a very good thing!The one thing I really dislike about MPW is the equity dilution over the past couple years. Collectively it is quite substantial and has held back equity price gains. This new debt offering is a much better alternative to fund ongoing growth. We should do much MORE of this and tap the US debt market in a big way soon again.Sure there is cost to this debt, but MUCH LESS than the dilution we have been seeing.Good progress MPW!"
"as im watching this trying to time the market to load up, I'm scared this won't go lower, buy buy buy"
"MPW’s short position went from 17 million shares in July, to 10 million shares in August. :-)"
Today’s pump! Look at OGN
"MPW will announce the Q1 dividend on or about February 18th. Everybody is used to the one penny per Quarter increase……..but MPW is running $1.84 NFFO. Just a payout of 70% is $1.29. MPW currently pays out $1.12. So yes, I’m looking for 2 cents per quarter. I’m a loyal MPW shareholder. Sharing is Caring."
Not that they will……but MPW could raise the quarterly payout by 2 cents instead of one cent in January. With their FFO of $1.84……..a $1.20 payout is very reasonable. Sure would help getting the stock to that $26 price target. :-)
Am I missing something here? Its headed all the way back to the lows again before the great news? Okay MM's please help.
Not a stock you will get rich quick on... and I'm fine with that. Low risk at this price.
"This stock is owned 80% by institutions. Has a short interest close to 5%. The 20% so called ordinary investors are now caught in year end selling. Also a couple of shorting specialists trying hard to push it down as is obvious by following the conversations on this board. Until the officers, BoD, some fund starts buying, or the shorts feel they hafe made enough and start covering it will drift even lower.. Either peddle it or wait for the year to end. IMO, it will be back into $22 to $25 area in the near future."
"Same price it was two years ago, but oh, that lovely dividend. Below the 50 DMA, next stop 19.40."
"Bought 5 shares today, I'm excited to own this REIT and add a medical REIT to my portfolio. I feel this could easily go to $26 in the future or even $30. I'll buy some now and just average down in the future (Hold for the long term and hopefully get a sweet 10% yield on cost in about 20 years)"
"I don't get it .... 12 Q's of Increased revenue, solid cash flow and positive earnings. 6% Dividend that has steadily increased and 18X Forward looking PEI just bought more ... Why haven't you ???"
"Rapid dividend growth in the second half of the year is moving the stock now. When the dust settles, I expect MPW to be in the low $20s and still paying out a solid 4.3% +. This will make for a wonderful total return for investors. MPW really is in a sweet spot. :-)"

"Curious. Down 2% on a day when we get the first analyst upgrade this year?I hope I am wrong, but I fear another dilutive secondary in the wind.I am a long term holder, generally happy with their performance but rank their lack of public information a D+.Transparency is not important to Mr Airbag."
Argus Research just raised MPW price target to $27.00 per share.
Why so much debt?
"went from 20.33 to 20 is no time; dumped over 1.6% just like that. Must be some really bad news, smh."
Why does the market hate a company that earns money and pays dividends? A tech stock can boast about revenue and not one cent in profit and the stock goes sky high Has all logic gone though the windows?
"So my 2 favorite REITs are MPW and FCPT. Both play off of the aging population demographic shift. Both have great management, investment grade books of business......and so on. Anyhow.......FCPT is trading over $30 per share, having a nice $1.20 per year payout. MPW is trading at $23 with a nice $1.04 per year payout. But MPW has more FFO than even FCPT. Maybe I’m being too simplistic......but MPW can easily run the payout up to $1.20 per year and trade at $30+ too. When’s the next dividend announcement? :-)"
"Same price it was Dec 2020, bum stock!"
Blabberwonky has not commented for a week. Must be embarrassed.
"Wow, MPW technically I know its not a trade but charts show a huge double bottom formation now."
Medical Properties Trust to Invest $950 Million in Behavioral Health PlatformAnyone know how Mpw is paying for this? Stock or credit?
"Haha, took a dive at the end of the day AGAIN!"
"Last post for the day. Book value about $13.50+. I hope it doesn't go that low, but if it does I will certainly load up!"
I’m worried that Kenneth may panic and sell his 5 shares. He needs to know that MPW is where Institutions park their money. They are the tail that wags the dog. Higher interest rate talk always hurts MPW.
Best stock right now in my portfolio good growth and dividend what else can you ask for!
"In 12 days alone it has lost more than the dividend in share price, omg."
"Oh look, it's down again. Imagine that. Enjoy ;)"
MPW up nearly 1% today. Blabberwonky can take the weekend off to heal his wounds.
"Sell on strengths, buy on weakness.Short $Tsla $Aapl $nio $Spy Long $Riot $Plug $GE $Mara $Mpw $Vix"
"At the end of the day, I guess a 5.3% dividend is pretty good. Since I bought almost all of my shares at about $13……I guess the dividend yield on my original investment is now about 9%. FCPT has done even better for me. They have been very shareholder friendly. They’re buying a new property about every 3 days. :-)"
Sure looks like take-off time. $1.60 in FFO. This stock should be trading in the mid-20s. Or higher. :-)
"Deutsche Bank Adjusts Price Target on Medical Properties Trust to $27 From $25, Maintains Buy Rating06/03/2021 8:18:53 AM ET - MT Newswires"
"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/medical-properties-trust-declares-regular-201000908.html#MPW is the go-to in a market awash in uncertainty. Surprised that analysts have not jumped on this in a larger way. Consistent price action, cheap relative to the market, a dividend of close to 6% and a sector that will survive and thrive in C19 land. Forget retail and park your cash in this healthcare facility REIT. Solid and room for growth."
"September 21, 2021--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Medical Properties Trust, Inc. (""MPT"") (NYSE: MPW) today announced that it has entered into an agreement to lease substantially all of its Utah hospitals to HCA Healthcare (""HCA Healthcare"") (NYSE: HCA), following an agreement by HCA Healthcare to purchase the operations of five Utah facilities from Steward Health Care System (""Steward""), for which the financial terms of the sale will remain confidential. MPT’s purchase price of $1.2 billion for the Utah hospitals represents approximately 5.0% of the Company’s total pro forma gross assets, which will place HCA Healthcare among the five largest tenants in the MPT portfolio. Following completion of this agreement with HCA Healthcare and closing of other recently announced transactions, the percentage of MPT’s portfolio represented by Steward assets is expected to decrease to approximately 17%.Since the acquisition of the Utah hospitals in 2017, MPT has recorded more than $300 million in real estate rent and interest from these properties. Upon completion of the transaction between HCA Healthcare and Steward, MPT and HCA Healthcare will enter into a new 15-year master lease for the five Utah hospitals, with no change to the cash rent payable to MPT under the existing Steward master lease. The lease agreement will include five extension options of five years each, and rental payments will increase annually at CPI, subject to a 2.0% floor and 5.0% ceiling. HCA Healthcare will have certain options to purchase the facilities starting in 2028, while MPT will have certain options to sell the facilities to HCA Healthcare. The purchase price under either option scenario will not be less than fair value."
Yup! good news on debt and the pps goes down. Seems as if you invest in anything that isn't hi-techwith PEs in the stratosphere you have a hard time making money. Go figure!
"Often overlooked is the fact that over 10,000 Baby Boomers are retiring every day in the US and most other places around the world. And this will continue for the next 8 years. Not only do these people need to rebalance to high yield income producing investments…….they need hospitals for new elbows and hips and heart attacks. MPW really is in a good place. :-)"
OT Good co i made some money over the years on MPW and sold last year. Tony a smart guy likes this stock. But for yield and cap appreciation now i would prefer ABBV at the current pps who now has a yield of 5% and likely will hit 125-130 next years as investors realize that their drugs in the pipe line will offset imo Humira coming off patent in 2023 plus in 7yrs time their being Abbv dividend will likely double again which in today terms would give you a yield of 10% cost basis. As always please do your own DD.
MPW going to incur a long term gain of $1.20/share on this deal.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/medical-properties-trust-macquarie-infrastructure-120000148.html
