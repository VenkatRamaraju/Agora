Great day.Took profit from $tsla $bkkt $mark and $dwac All in $mpw. Long term play.
Bank of America upgraded to Buy today. Interesting that two firms are upgrading/initiating as a buy/strong buy the week of earnings release. I think it is entirely within the realm of possibility that this sees a new 52 week high in the next 10 trading days. Also much more volume the past two days than this stock has seen in some time.
Owned this for many years. Cost per share now under $5.00. Getting 20% on cost. NO COMPLAINTS
"My first purchase was in 2017 at $11.68. I reinvested all dividends. Have three purchases totaling 221 shares that are in the ""red"". Otherwise, now approaching 11k shares, all except the 221 DRIP shares are profitable. Little price movement for the last two years. I feel the dividend is extremely secure and will be increase again. Could have done better, but also could have done much worse. No complaints"
Raymond James maintains strong buy on MPW and raises PT to $26.
"BofA upgraded to $24 + Raymond James initiates at $25BofA analyst Joshua Dennerlein upgraded Medical Properties Trust to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $24, up from $21.50 as part of a broader research note on Healthcare REITs. The analyst states that as labor cost concerns grow, Medical Properties is well positioned to since hospitals can better handle rising wages given their higher margins. Dennerlein adds that the REIT's leases offer inflation protected growth as the company has made two recent transactions that diversify its tenant roster.Raymond James analyst Jonathan Hughes initiated coverage of Medical Properties Trust with a Strong Buy rating and $25 price target. Medical Properties Trust benefits from investing in an asset class characterized by solid lease coverages, attractive yields, and plentiful external growth opportunities both domestically and internationally, Hughes tells investors in a research note. Management's strong capital allocation acumen, along with deep operator relationships, should generate strong earnings, NAV, and dividend growth for shareholders for the foreseeable future, the analyst contends."
Heading back down to $19.60 then time to buy again and ride back up towards next ex dividend. LOL
I see a 2 cent quarterly dividend hike in our near future. The NFFO is through the roof. :-)
"One nugget from the conference call that I thought was a plus was lease payments being tied to the CPI, thus allowing a hedge against inflation. They said the rates would be adjusted in January so I think with the adjusted lease rates they will do better than expected for first quarter 2022."
"If all their acquisition are truly accretive and they have reduced debt service in 1/3 of debt by over 200 bps, how come these improvements are not reflected on the dividend?"
At the present time my broker has listed a PE for MPW of about 22 and a book value ratio of 1.48. These show against industry figures of 70 and 7 respectively. Looking at forward earnings for 2021 of approx. $1.76 this stock should be at least $35 based on a PE of 20.So is there something else going on that is negative or is MPW just subject to massive manipulation by the shorts.
This is really overdue. Very strong FFO. Enough to support a much larger payout. The stock should be over $25 per share.
Almost 27 mil shares short caught on the wrong side of this trade. They will not get my shares! MPW is quite cheap. Should see $23+ by yrs end
Annualized NFFO is $1.86 per share. Just paying out 80% of it would be $1.40 per share. There should be a large increase in the payout coming.
"Well, the games continue. We have upgrades, stock should go to $24 or $25, blah, blah. Then a huge article on how many hedge funds are selling, some have sold out completely, which they wouldn't do if it was going to the prices mentioned.. This stock is a pain just because of the manipulation, but of they can hold or increase their dividend maybe it will settle down."
"MPW just put $6,000 in cash into my brokerage account. Thanks MPW. Letâ€™s do it again in 3 months. :-)"
"Market is worse than a casino - solidly run businesses with strong cashflow get minimal notice, while the momentum stocks fly with minimal link to fundamentals!"
Raymond James gives a strong buy rating and $25 target. Check that pre market price.
Why the big sell off today???
You have to admit these guys are good. Accumulation/ distribution positive. So while the the stock is eing bought more than sold the price has dropped about 30 cents. Now that is good manipulation.
