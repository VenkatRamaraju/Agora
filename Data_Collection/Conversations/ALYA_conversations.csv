Price lower than before merger. Makes no sense
"No. Edgewater stock has been basically the same price for 20 years. Thanks to having the same management and directors that in my opion are just ""hanger ons"" and cant find a job with any other company."
I'm interested in the company. In the news release for Q4 they stated they lost less money than the corresponding quarter last year. What I don't understand is why they're not making a profit. Can anyone explain this to me? It's not just Covid-19 as the chart has been going down hill since before the pandemic.
bigger player making a offer?
Results out tomorrow morning

"Alithya has over 2,000 data scientists and IT specialist on their payroll. They also have partnerships with Microsoft, Splunk, Rapidminer, OSISoft, Oracle, SAP, Amazon, PTC, Snowflake. Additionally, they are on an M&A craze and their top market focus is the Americas. They could become a serious contender for a takeover from an Accenture or a Hatch"
Never buy stock early in the morning; wait until 10 AM; especially these small companies
"Buy the dip, this company now will have real growth, huge multiple expansion coming"
600 million in revenue? This is a NICE setup!

"Just bought some more @ $2.30. There is 5000 listed shares to buy on the bid at a time. It keeps getting bought out and then immediately replenished @ $2.30. So, if you want to buy, put your order in @ $2.30. Someone is sitting heavily on the bid. The bad news is that someone keeps selling at that price, too. So, the transaction for buying and selling appears to be at $2.30."
Buying the dip! Closing of the acquisition will be announced in the coming days
