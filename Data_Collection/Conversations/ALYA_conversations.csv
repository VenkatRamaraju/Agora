Is it a fact that majority Canadian Toroanto exchanged companies tends to become a bust eventually? from Northern Telecome to many many mining stocks. they tend to grab investors money and run
"Someone is just sitting on the bid buying all the shares that constantly keep being dumped. The good news is this could be the bottom. I suspect it is. The bad news is that IF this buyer steps out of the way, it could drop like a rock. A major transaction now appear to be going on. I put a buy order in @ $2.30 and got filled there. I think they are masking the buys under the bid. ALYA: $2.30b $2.31a pre-market. 348,000 shares traded so far."

Any clue what's going on?

"ALYA need to replace all the old directors from Technisource, Intellimark, Charlesbank days. This stock has not gone anywhere in 20 years. It was at $25 in 1997. Gambelli fund is stupid to hold shares. What are they thinking???"

30% more shares issued for an extra 60M/year in revenue? Doesn't sound all that amazing but hopefully we get some more financial details soon
"I sold this garbage too; they pumped up in the morning by buying and selling some shares and then they dump later. In addition, all those who bought at low prices, they sell too. lesson learned."
I hope Stevie Bova is not still involved in the management of this company. IMO he is a washed up Alltell mid manager with no management skills or talents. He is worthless imo.
"2,000 technical consultants on staff means its still a very small player in the business. Since probably 1/2 of them are on 6 month contracts, and will be working for another company, a different project in 7 months, you must be careful with the numbers. There are also 3 month contracts too. Thats the consulting biz. Not all is what it seems. Plus I never liked Steve Bova who was associated with this firm at one point."
I'm waiting for the short covering that is probably coming any moment now . . .ALYA: $2.51b 45.5 mil shares traded so far with 1.75 hrs to go. I'm ready now.
huge vol. sell off probably 1 or 2 institutions using the pop as liquidity to exit a position. Betting they will get cleaned up at some today since i-ownership is 40% of float and we nearly traded 35% of that already. Watch for a block trade
Buying the dip! Closing of the acquisition will be announced in the coming days
"Revenue goes up $30 Million, but cost of revenue and expenses went up $30 Million. Where's the PROFIT????"
$2.53 and $2.57 are going to be some interesting trigger points. They will run like a herd of cattle IF we get a decent pop in the general market for these micros. Many beaten down stocks are basically holding steady now. But fear can turn into hope quickly. This is an interesting time.ALYA: $2.50b

"Alithya has over 2,000 data scientists and IT specialist on their payroll. They also have partnerships with Microsoft, Splunk, Rapidminer, OSISoft, Oracle, SAP, Amazon, PTC, Snowflake. Additionally, they are on an M&A craze and their top market focus is the Americas. They could become a serious contender for a takeover from an Accenture or a Hatch"

"Hope Steve Bova isnt associated with this company anymore. He is the kiss of death for a company in my opinion. In my opinion he ruined technisource and intellimark by hiring Mary McCarthy who shut down the Dallas branch and demoralized all staff. And Jim Pagan, the training dude - he never trained us or anyone else I knew of. What was he doing on the payroll? His rock band ""The Pagans"" was a joke too. In my opinion Bova was a poor performer from Alltell who couldnt find a job anywhere but Intellimark"

I'm interested in the company. In the news release for Q4 they stated they lost less money than the corresponding quarter last year. What I don't understand is why they're not making a profit. Can anyone explain this to me? It's not just Covid-19 as the chart has been going down hill since before the pandemic.

"Alya is a recycle of Technisource, Intelliamark and Edgewater trash that crashed and burned 20 years ago and never went back up. Gambelli is dumb enough to hold this junk for over 20 years. Quick call Credit Swiss and get a meeting to see if there are syenergies with any other failing companies they service. Ben please call Rachael, Ben please call Racheal - she is in her hotel room waiting"

"No. Edgewater stock has been basically the same price for 20 years. Thanks to having the same management and directors that in my opion are just ""hanger ons"" and cant find a job with any other company."
"no sure what to make of it. I mean taking profits on a 100% spike is normal since there no news to support it. May pop again tomorrow, who knows!?"
"Shorts are having fun today, but now they have to get out. I'm here specifically for that event. If I'm wrong, I'll cover, but I suspect they will be the ones covering, but we'll see. ALYA: $2.50b 45,665,000 shares traded. Vol should take a nice spike at some point IF I'm right."
"Just bought some more @ $2.30. There is 5000 listed shares to buy on the bid at a time. It keeps getting bought out and then immediately replenished @ $2.30. So, if you want to buy, put your order in @ $2.30. Someone is sitting heavily on the bid. The bad news is that someone keeps selling at that price, too. So, the transaction for buying and selling appears to be at $2.30."
Y was it up

"This is a staffing company. used to be Edgewater technologies, before that it was Staffmark, run by Clete Brewer and his dad. In my opinion its a dog of a stock and its just made up of a bunch of failed staffing companies dressed up all pretty and sold to someone for syenergies that never really existed. IMO, Steve Bova, the top executive didnt run any of them right, Edgewater ignored ""Mucko"" and employee who shot and killed 6 employees right before Xmas day in 2000 - read up on the Edgewater Massacre - he was bringing guns to work and keeping them in his locker - and he was a programmer! A comedy of errors!"
