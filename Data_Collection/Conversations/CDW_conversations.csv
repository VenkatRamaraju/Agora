Why is this on a free fall?
CDW projected to hit $95/share by EOY.
buy the dip.
No change in earnings estimates noted. No reason to panic.
"CDW going to $150 and then will rest! This company can not stop, my kid works there busier than ever, world wide! Lets their employees work from home 2-3 days a week! Great work place, makes happy employees, makes profit."
Whoever listens to these id... analysts are id...s themselves. Today MS downgrades CDW to underweight and downgrades IBM to equal weight. I have been doing this for a long time and these guys have no more of a clue than anyone else!!
They had some interesting insights about CDW on (http://Pick-stocks.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
Blue Horseshoe loves CDW.
LETS GO CDW $175+!!!Gotta be a blowout earnings when everyone is ordering technology for the lockdown.
"Morgan Stanley downgraded CDW today to under weight. Price target 124. The stock was punished on this news, losing over 7 points. I guess MS predicts lower earnings and revenues this quarter. There is still 13 points of downside action to get to MS target of 124."
Congrats CDW Team! A $1B Buyback AND Blowout earnings??!! Nice Work!
Why is there zero talk on this board? This company is stellar.
CDW has NOT FAILED ANY Earnings call since IPO PRICE @ $24.00 Congrats CDW just steadily goes higher.
$CDW Downgrades Morgan Stanley Equal-Weight USD 208 Â» USD 196 Upgraded by JPMorgan Chase Hold USD 200
what a gift!
I bought more today.
Upgrades today? $110 PT? It really surprises me that a $14B is so ignored by Wall Street and the public. Especially since the stock has been such a solid growth and value play. Wonder why?
not sure what's causing the selloff or the dip. Does anyone have any insight?

Nice Breakout from a double top! Go CDW!
One of the best charts out there. Just steady ramp up in price since ipo..
Congrats CDW!
Never have held a stock where 94.93% of the float is held by institutions. A good reason why this message board is so silent. This stock seems like a hidden gem out performing the S&P almost every year. Glad to be a shareholder who is not an institution.
CONGRATS ALL LONGS GREAT COMPANY WITH MASSIVE GROWTH
Why the drop?
anyone getting in for earnings tomorrow?
Morgan Stanley now moves CDW to underweight from equal weight. This is a buy signal.
Aiming for $100 by end of the week
Congrats passing $100 mark
"CDW has never had a bad quarter will keep running and running up! It wil split 2 for 1 possible to get the price down and then keep moving up slowly like a freight train, Choo choo!!"
When's the last time CDW had a miss on earnings??? It's a sure bet.
"Credit Suisse raises target to 155 today, 1-21-2020."
Buy the dips
Rising with good volume. Bullish technical indication. http://www.stoxline.com/stock_chart/CDW.gif
CDW STRONG!!!
So happy this dipped below 100 so i could scoop up some shares. Now lets run run run
"Beat earnings, record 4th quarter and record full year net sales, raises dividend. $160/share here we come."
time to buy?
"91% of shares owned by institutions, this is a very strong company and when you work there you can't just float around, looking like your working,actual doing the work =financial growth Company."
Another GREAT CDW quarter! Congrats CDW!
