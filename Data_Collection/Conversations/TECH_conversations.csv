"I don’t know why people don’t talk on here nor it seems like they investing into this company, this company so good for both short term and long term"
"Hi Dr. John. As you have probably seen, MDXG getting beat up. Based on an accounting review of possible irregularities. Is this changing your position. Are you adding? Selling any? I'm torn. I think the shorts will continue to swarm all over this. But if there is nothing there, it could be a huge buying opportunity...."

"Just a follow up on Corvus (CRVS), a immuno-oncology company (--> Adenosin pathway) I mentioned about 3m ago (share price then 2.35, share price now 4.0, MC 112m, cash 65m, no debt). CRVS has a very seasoned executive team (having been involved in the development of ibrutinib and rituximab). CRVS' CEO, R.Miller was the CEO of Pharmacyclis. The stock popped recently not because of oncology news, but because one of their clinical compounds, CPI-006 could have a role in the TTT of Cvoid -19. I mostly shun away from covid-19 companies, but this one looks very promising to me, especially in the light of CRVS' tiny market cap. CPI-006 is a humanized mab directed against CD73, an epitope on naive B-cells. CPI-006 induces B-cell activation (--> Plasmablasts, Plasma-cells, which secrete (polyclonal) immunoglobulins) and induces the long lived memory B cells. Other biotechs have also compounds against CD73 in their (pre-)clinical pipeline, but it seems that those act mainly via the adenosin pathway and that CPI-006 is the only one with the unique B-cell activating properties. Cpi-006 has been tested in Corvus' oncology program already in ca 90 patients so far, and it has been shown, that CPI-006 significantly increases markers of Plasma-cells (CD27), and of CD69, a signal for B-cell trafficking to the lymph nodes. What's more CPI-006 induces a switch to memory B-cells (by a factor of 2-3), as evidenced by IgD negativity and CD27 positivity. Corvus is not aware of any other company having a similar compound in clinical testing and intends to use CPI-006 as kind of ""therapeutic vaccination"" for Covid 19 (ie boosting immune response and antibodies in Covid19 patients). They plan to do a dose escalating study with mild to moderated Covid19 patients (PCR positivity <7d is required) and endpoints will be anti-Covid 19 IgM and IgG titers at 21 d, with follow up for 6m. Therefore first results will be ready in 3-6 m. Treatment will consist in a single ""shot"" of CPI-006. What's especially interesting is a very remarkable single case record (I know, n=1 does not prove anything, but the case is remarkable enough to merit attention). A 69 y old patient with COPD and NSCLC (this group of patients usually have a 40% mortality with Covid 19) was tested PCR+ for Covid 19 on the first day of being given CPI-006 in the context of one of Corvus' oncology trials. Despite being at high risk for serious disease/death due to covid19, she not only remained asymptomatic, but mounted extremely high anti SARS-Cov-2 antibody titers (IgG >1:100'000, IgM 1:3200 by week 6) which is not only unusually high, but especially unusual for a patient with NSCLC. By w6 the patient was PCR negative. Taken altogether, I think the rationale for treatment with CPI-006 is sound and the limited anecdotic evidence was compelling enough for me to triple my stake in CRVS today (at 4.02 USD). What I like with the CRVS-story is, that I initially bought it because of their oncology assets (which are more promising than 1 year ago), but now there is an additional, unexpected twist, adding to the story.Dr JohnPS: what else? Arrowhead (ARWR, currently at 48.5 has been a steady and stellar performer since I mentioned it a few weeks ago at 36USD. The story is getting more attention. Well deserved! Base-editing company BEAM (Beam 26.5USD, MC 1.3b) has also been performing very well, since I mentioned it 3m ago at 16, while k-ras company Revolution Medicine (RMED, now at 28, MC 1.65b) which I mentioned 3m ago at 22 more than doubled to 46, but came back to the current 28 (also because of a secondary offering). I continue to hold both, but do not add to my position.Finally, I reentered Acceleron (XLRN currently at 99, MC 5.9B (my average buying price ca 95USD)), an old time favourite of mine, which I sold some time ago. I bought into the stock mainly because of the promising results of its pulmonary hypertension program."
What just happened....
"Hi Dr. John. So I finally had a chance to go over the Phase 1/2 results that J&J released from their Covid candidate (which is now in phase 3). And they are really accelerating these trials. They claim they will have some Phase 3 results by the end of the year. This could make it tougher for CPI-006 to 'catch-up' in the Covid 'race'. Though not impossible. Not to mention CPI-006 may have opened many other doors for itself. Anyway, below is the key points from J&J trial results:Immune Response Data""Seroconversion (the development of detectable antibodies) was observed in 99 percent of participants aged 18-55 years of age. 98 percent of participants were positive for neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 at day 29 post-vaccination. The Janssen COVID-19 vaccine candidate elicited strong antibody responses, strong T cell responses, and a Th1 response, believed to be protective against the risk of vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease.Immunogenicity (the ability to trigger an immune response) data from participants aged 65 years of age and above were available for the first 15 participants at the time of this post, with strong humoral and cellular immune responses elicited in all elderly participants who received a single dose of Janssen’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate.Immune responses were similar across the age groups studied, including older adults.Safety and Tolerability DataInterim safety data from the Phase 1/2a trial indicated that the majority of adverse events reported were mild to moderate (grade 1 and grade 2) in severity and generally occurred on the day of vaccination with symptoms generally resolving that day, or the following day."""
buy now?
"Congrats Dr John! One of your top 10 holdings; ALXN, got bought out this morning."
"Hi Dr. John, I noticed that after-hours yesterday, AUPH announced they failed the dry-eye candidate they were developing. I only have a very tiny current position in AUPH. Would now be the time to add on weakness? Or would you just hold? Or do you think it is time to sell and move on?"

is TECH a good value at this price?
"Bye bye 2019, part 1... We are not yet quite there, and who knows if we'll not have a decent biotech selloff before NY? What I witness now is the usual pattern of a ""melt-up"", where in the last phase forgotten and decimated small and micro caps have an explosive revival, without significant news (pex: JNCE, CRVS, CLVS, OVID...). Which does not mean, however, that some of these names have not excellent intrinsic potential, irrespective of the melt -up (such as p.ex OVID).My long-term favorite, BioTechne (TECH, 217 USD, EV 8.7B, EV/EBITDA 42.5(!), P/S 11, P/E ca 40) has outstanding underlying strength, due to the flawless execution of the CEO and his team. TECH's future is bright, and it's valuation is accordingly high (see above). However, TECH is performing and it's Protein Simple division is in the starting blocks to compete against SIMOA from Quanterix ((QTRX, ca 24 USD, EV 660m, growing revenues at 30- 40+%), another of my favorite holdings, albeit more of a niche player and less diversified than TECH. QTRX has had a good year, although its valuation has come down since summer. The same goes for Nanostring (NSTG), where I profited from the depressed share price an upped my position some 2 months ago (NSTG, 26 USD, EV 920m USD). Like QTRX, NSTG continues to have very appealing long term potential: above all GeoMX DSP, and looking more out into the future, tapping into the infectious disease rapid diagnostic and AST market (which might make offering such as those from Accelerate Diagnostics (AXDX) ultimately obsolete).The BIG NEWS for me, however came in during the last week: Outstanding ph3-study results from 2 of my large, long term biotech holdings, namely Chemocentryx (CCXI, ca 28 USD, MC 1.6 B)),which quadrupled, and, today, from Aurinia (AUPH, currently 17USD, MC 1.6 B). CCXI (ca 28 USD, MC 1.6 B), which so far doubled today. Both scored wins in the same field, i.e autoimmune mediated nephology indications (Lupus nephrtitis and ANCA vasculitis respectively). Both had top notch, highly significant results both in primary and all secondary endpoint, results without any fly in the ointment. The icing on the cake is, that both companies have a promising pipeline in mid-advanced stages (From a market potential point of view, CCXI's next big thing will be hidradenitis suppurativa (HC), while Aurinia had amazing ph2 results in the billion dollar market for dry eye syndrome). IMO, both companies are by no means overvalued with a MC of 1.6B. While I sold 40% of my CCXI at 32 and change, I might add again, once they decide to do a secondary offering. I did not sell any AUPH. For comparison, look at a company such as Allakos (ALLK). ALLK (125USD, MC 6.1 B USD). ALLK had it's own excellent results in gastrointestinal hypereosiophilic syndrome. This is a large basket of diseases which range in severity from mild symptoms (the majority) to more severe symptoms (the minority). I think the 6 B MC is very high, especially if you consider the fact that most of the GI-hypereosinophilic syndromes are not life threatening, in contrast to ANCA or lupus nephropathy. Granted, ALLK has the lure of label expansion into chronic urticria etc, but again, I doubt that payers and doctors will be willing to pay for/prescribe an utra-expensive monoclonal ab for all but the most severe forms of these conditions. Therefore, while ALLK's 6B MC might be on the high side, CCXI's and AUPH's mc of 1.6B is definitively on the low side and I expect the SP to gradually increase.-> to be continuedDJ"

Dr John wonder if you could give any observations or thoughts about this latest data released by CRVS? Thanks.
manav you still in...?
"I see that CRVS diluted Dr John. It’s scary because I’ve followed you for over at least 10 years now. And I’m getting good and figuring out if one of your ideas might be too early. Not always though! And I don’t doubt your long-term thesis on CRVS! I may start to nibble. Might wait to see if I can get it in the low 3’s or high 2’s. I’m expecting the market to have a tough soon. I think all stocks, good and bad might get a haircut."
strong moves..growing their business..
"This & thatThe market is hot and biotech was not left behind. The takeover of Immunogen (IMMU) by Gilead for ca 20 B USD was very high, my guess is: too high. Not so the 13 B paid by Bristol Myers for Myokardia (MOYK), which has first class science and, unlike Immunogen, is in a field with limited direct competition. I was, of course, very pleased about the deal, since Myokardia has been one of my large holdings (I first wrote about it in 2019, when it was ca 48 USD, and sold today at 220, +/- the takeout price). MYOK's allosteric inhibitor of myosin has consistently shown excellent results in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Also apart from Myokardia, the year 2020 has been kind to me, rewarding my largest positions with markedly higher valuations: TGTX (TGTX, ca 30.5 USD, MC 3.85 B USD) has almost tripled this year, thanks to positive news flow and Wall Street seeing the glass suddenly as half full. Due to this gain, TGTX has in my portfolio overtaken even Bio-Techne (TECH). Close behind TGTX (and before TECH) comes Turning Point Therapeutics (TPTX, ca 118 USD, MC almost 5B USD). Its lead drug, Reprotrectinib has the ingredients to become the leading ROS/TRK Inhibitor out there. I mentioned TPTX shortly after its IPO, somewhere in the 30's, and this year alone the share price doubled from 60 --> 120. Aurinia (AUPH, ca 15.5, MC ca 2B) on the other hand, lost (21-->15.5) during the year (after the big run-up end of last year). The company deserves more credit for Voclosporine, especially if the dry eye syndrome trial will be positive (which I expect). I bought more AUPH in spring in the high 13's and continue to hold.I established two large new positions during the second half of the year: On is Arrowhead (ARWR, 46 USS, MC 4.7B). The CEO is very smart (and knows it). A couple of years ago he bought Roche's and Novartis' RNA-interference pipeline/intellectual property, a smart move. I think, ARWR is by far the most promising si-RNA company out there, and all results published so far have been stellar, most recently in Alpha1 AT-deficiency-associated liver disease, paving the way for a lucrative deal with Takeda. My average buying price is about 37, and I expect the company to be be worth considerably more than the actual share price of 48, for those willing to wait. (BTW, I sold today10% of TPTX, TGTX and QTRX to increase my cash position, and bought 10% more of ARWR). In order to buy ARWR, I sold my positions in NBIX and XLRN (not that these names are not attractive at current valuations....)My second new large position, is Corvus (CRVS, ca 4 USD, MC ca 110 m USD), which has been discussed here recently several times, reason why I will not repeat my bull case for the company. It stays stubbornly undervalued, which is great for those, like me, who want to pick up shares. Corvus continues to deliver amazing results with CPI-006 in Covid-19 and the compound has a very large field of potential indications, but the street is either missing the point, or not believing it (an enigma to me). My average price for CRVS is +/- the current price.I decreased a midsize position in Ovid (OVID, 5.5 USD, MC 350m) to a small position (at a good gain). Ovid-935, a C24H-inhibitor showed positive results in a midstage trial in rare epilepsy syndromes, placing it squarely between the results published earlier on by GW-Therapeutics (GWTX) and Arena (ARNA). Ovid has a very good CEO and has further upside potential with Ovid-101, but I preferred to put the money into Corvus.Then there has been rewards in my 2 large Medtech holdings (spart from BioTechne) as well. Quanterix (QTRX, 44 USD, MC ca 1.4B) doubled this year so far, and Nanostring (NSTG, 40.5 USD, MC 1.5B) is up by 50% (see older posts in 2018,2019). I continue to hold both. I reduced my positions in most of my O&G holding, some at a good gain and was lucky enough to do some lucrative trades pex Core Labs (CLB), tripling from a low of 9 to 27 (now back at 16). However most of the remaining O&G positions are well in the red (SLB, FANG, sold out of WPX today), while RPC (RES) is mildly in the red. March2020 was good for some beaten down names, such as Viacom (VIAC my average price 15, now 28), or Bed,Bath&_Beyond (BBBY, my average price 8, now 21), however my long term looser, International Game Technology (IGT, currently at ca 11USD, my average price ca 16) is still in my portfolio...Taken altogether, what would I buy now, at current prices? CRVS, ARWR and probably -again- some O&G outfits (SLB, CLB, FANG) when the weakness continues.Dr John"
"What's up? Well, for one, Bio-Techne had another stellar quarter. Quite impressive how this team delivers! Could not think of a better longe term holding (for me it is indeed: bought my first shares in the last century).Then, Quanterix (QTRX, ca 35 USD, MC 1.1B) and Nanostring (NSTG, 38 USD, MC ca 1.4B) are delivering as well, despite Covid19. Still plenty of room ahead for both, especially for QTRX.For a change, my large ""pure"" biotech positions are all doing well. Chemocentryx (CCXI, 54.5 USD) came back some 20%, which is deserved, because the stock got ahead of itself at 65 (Isold 20% and bought more AUPH instead). Aurinia (AUPH, 14.5 USD) is too cheap at a MC of 1.8B. The same goes for TG Therapeutics (TGTX 22.5 USD, MC 2.85B), even though the stock is doing ok this year. Ovid (OVID) did well since I first mentioned it 8 months ago (then at 3.9USD, now at 7.9, MC 450m). I continue to hold my shares, since I am in mainly because of the epilepsy program. But it is a risky position: Angelmann trial results should be out relatively soon. If they disappoint, the stock will take a heavy beating (if the are positive: the contrary)The biggest disconnect between share price and pipeline value is in Corvus Pharmaceutical (CRVS, ca 4USD, MC ca 110m): I do not understand, how the financial community does not appreciate the potential of CPI-006 in Covid-19. Is it because Corvus is seen as a Oncology company? Is it just flying below the radar? As I said before, I usually shy away from ""Covid stocks"". Sure, we have only very scant results for CPI-006 in Covid19. However these results are both remarkable and outstanding. Index patient: Advanced NSCLC, tested positive for acute Covid infection, mortality risk with Covid expected to be 40%: Receiving CPI-006 (oncology study), produces anti SARS-Cov-2 titres of >1:50'000 (including domain binding region (DBR), clears virus in 1 week, remains asymptomatic. This patient could be an outlier, for sure. However, the first patients in the recently started phase 1 study (CPI-006 in Covid 19 infected patients with PCR results positive <7d), showed exactly the same pattern: production of massive anti-virus titres, including against the RBD within 7 days, increasing even more at 14 days. BTW, these patients were receiving the lowest dose of CPI-006, which was >50times lower than the dose given to the NSCLC patient. Titres of the magnitude of 1:100'000 are bound to contain significant amount of neutralising abs, and I just cannot imagine how these titres should not have a significant influence of the speed of virus clearing, and consequently a positive impact on outcome. If this were not the accepted thinking, why would Regeneron & Co develop monoclonal abs against the RBD of the spike protein? What Corvus is doing, is giving a one shot immune booster (activating CD73), which, in turn, activates B-cells, ""transforms"" them into memory B Cells and Plasma-cells (which are secreting abs against SARS-Cov2). CPI-006 could not only be used in early stage (or even late stage) Covid 19, but would also make tremendous sense also as adjuvans to vaccinations, or used in the preventive setting with populations at risk. I have been sorely wrong before, p.ex. when I bet a large sum on Mimedx (MDXG), just to see it fall from 15 to 1. (Well I had bought my first shares at 1, and bought again when the new management team came in at average 4. Now we are again >6, but still a long way to go). However, with Corvus I take again a large but calculated risk, making it in my 4th largest ""pure play biotech position"" (average price at about 4.1 USD)(The 5 largest positions are: TGTX>AUPH>TPTX>CRVS>CCXI). If, as I expect, most patients in the phase 1 study will show large increases in anti-SARS-CoV2 titres (results will be due in November), then the market cap will not be 100mill but 1B. And that's only for starters...We'll see....Dr John"
"@ByeHI: as to EDAP (a medtech company based in Lyon, France) which you mentioned earlier (EDAP, ca 8.7USD, MC 250m, Rev 2019 ca 40m, earnings 1.5m, rev 2020 (Covid) ca 20 less, but good last Q'20).EDAP has 3 lines of revenue: a) ESWL, a mature market with good cashflow, b) distribution of equipment of other companies (pex of high performance US machines made by Exact Imaging, which it tries to bundle with its own HIFU technology) and c) Focal One, a HIFU (high frequency ultrasound) treatment device, being used in the noninvasive treatment of localised prostate cancer (PC), and with early studies to treat rectal endometriosis. Over the years, EDAP's management team has done a very solid job: They have worked tirelessly to gain approval of Focal1, first in Europe, then in the US, then gaining Medicare coverage (class 1 CPT code). Now they are trying to gain coverage of commercial/private payers covering the majority of eligible patients, something which might take quite some time (years?). Ultimately, EDAP -somewhat optimistic- believes that 25% of new PC cases might be treated with HIFU and 75% thereof by EDAP (Focal1). This leads them to a hypothetical future revenue of about 600m USD (whereof roughly one third comes form new machines, servicing and consumables each). While these projections are optimistic, recent interim topline results of a large French study, comparing HIFU with radical prostatectomy (RP) were reassuring in that HIFU resulted in more 24m-recurrent-free survival (not needing salvage TTT or additional medical TTT) (p<0.001) and in significantly less urinary incontinence (p0.005) and MED. While the current coverage by medicare is at favourable terms (doctors earn about 1000 USD per HIFU as compared to ca 730 USD for cryotherapy or brachytherapy and 1300 USD for radical prostatectomy). EDAP does the right thing, trying to bundle Focal 1 with Exact Imaging's high-perfomance US equipment, giving the urologist access to both diagnosis and therapy. for 2021/2 they concentrate on gaining commercial coverage and to publish (or have published) high quality data regarding HIFU at large academical centres.Taken altogether, while the path to (ultimate commercial) success might be quite long, EDAP is a solid company with a thoughtful management team, good products, and a solid business plan. If they continue to work tirelessly as they did so far, they should have a good chance of success. In that light the current SP (ca 6x sales) seems rather moderate, especially especially considering the frothy market as we witness.Dr John"
yahoo 3month chart ...amazing.....
nice move today...
Dr John i wonder if you can comment on the Moderna (MRNA) Phase 1 results? These are the 1st results I've seen since this pandemic began that give me huge hope a vaccine is closer than we think. I know this was a very small and early phase 1. But it did trigger the antibody response you want to see!!!
"Dr John, have you had a chance to look at VERU and their Phase 2 Covid results? Curious as to what you think."
"so far so good, pt 2:...and the biotech sector continues to be ""en vogue"", at least in selected sectors. While many large cap biotechs and more traditionally oriented mid-large caps (such as Alexion or Neurocrine) are treading water at best, selected ""targeted""oncology companies and some gene editing outfits are red hot.Since my last post 3 weeks ago (somewhat ""buried"" in an answer to LMP), Oric (ORIC) has been performing very well (then 25, now 35), as did Crisper (CRSP: then 106, now 148), while Mersana (MRSN) is still trading at ca 23.5 USD (Interim top line results in rr-Ovarial Cancer should be released soon).I have repeatedly mentioned (and added to my position) Beam (BEAM, now at 67) and Fate (FATE, now at 83), which have been outstanding performers, as was ALXO which I increased significantly in size. All have shown impressive new (proof of concept-) data and, aprtly due to the SP-appreciation, all three figure now among my ""top 10"" biotech holdings (my top 10 positions being: CRVS >TGTX >ARWR >TPTX >BEAM >FATE >AUPH >KOD >ALXO >MRSN=ALXN)for quite some time, I owned a rather small position in the opthalmology biotech Kodiak (KOD) (initial purchase price at ca 50, now at 124). Only recently I woke up and increased my position significantly. For some reason I did not appreciate the true value of their pipeline and the strategic brilliance of KOD's top management team. (I strongly suggest to listen into their MorganStanley Healthcare conference presentation).As to these Zoom-Healthcare conferences: For me as an investor it is extremely helpful to see/judge how the top management team of different biotech companies is responding to questions. You feel immediately who is top notch/ with whom you'd like to invest (provided the stock is still reasonably priced). Examples being: Beam, Fate, KOD, ORIC, KROS. I also strongly suggest to look into the Jefferies London Healthcare conference and specifically listen to those Zoom ""fireside chats"", which were hosted by Michel Yee from Jefferies, an extremely bright analyst asking very informative questions (he interviewed, pex Beam, Fate, Oric, Alxo, Kron, Akro, amongst others). Access via the respecitve biotech hoempage)Three large long term medtech-/life science positions of mine (which I have repeatedly written about) have shown a very nice performance in 2020: Nanostring (NSTG: beginning 2020: 27 USD--> now 63) and Quanterix (QTRX: beginning 2020: 23 USD --> now 47) and Natera (NTRA: beginning 2020: 35 USD --> now 90). I recently bought a midsize position in Illumina at ca 295 (ILMN , now ca 340USD), because I think their acquisition of GRAIL is a long term winner in the liquid biopsy space. Grail with its methylation based NGS platform is IMO superior to Thrive (also an interesting company, recently acquired by EXAS) and at least equivalent to Guardant Health (GH).Taken altogether: Moments like now are dangerous: You look back on a very decent portfolio performance, to say the least, and pat yourself on the shoulder, thinking you are sooo shrewd. However, in the end, 3/4 of it is the ""flood lift all boats""- effect (you happen to be in the right sector). I am still positive, but there is no reason, why all these wonderful biotechs could not trade 50% below the current valuation. Therefore, I increased my cash position again.FWIWDr JohnThere are some very very promising ""next-gen"" companies in the biotech/medtech space, which, unfortunately are too expensive most of the time, such as Ten-X Genomics (TXG), Berkley Lights (BLI), Schroedinger (SDGR), or Relay (RELY). (I won small amount of BLI and SDGR)."

"Bye bye 2019, part2...While 2018 has been a annus horribilis for me, 2019 is it's counterpart, the annus mirabilis (heck, the huge loss inflicted last year by an abysmal MDXG performance has more than evened out in only 11 months).My long term NASH-holdings (and log term laggards!) Intercept (ICPT, currently back up to from 70 to 118 USD, MC 3.8B) and Madrigal (MDGL 118 USD, EV 1.3B,MC 1.8B) are finally getting back the respect they deserve, and more is to come. In the end they are amongst the few remaining NASH companies with unequivocally positive results in mid stage to late stage trials, while most of its contenders collapsed on the way... Then there is Myokardia, (MYOK, 66.5 USD , MC 3B, EV 2.6B, SP-performance YTD 44--> 66 USD). MYOK has shown thats its allosteric inhibitor of Myosin significantly improves several clinically important parameters in certain cardiomyopathies, a large and underserve market. Elegant science, no me too products. A mid-autumn selloff was completely unwarranted, the SP is on the upswing again, and I expect good long term appreciation (see previous posts). The same goes for Ascendis (ASND, 110 USD, MC 5.4 B), which is the man left standing when it comes to slow release growth hormone replacement, with a pilpeline to boost (see previous posts).Amongst the most exiting biotechs, however, is Turning Point (TPTX, 2 USD, MC 1.9B, EV 1.55B), one of my largest pure play biotech holdings (IPO in April 2019 at ca 25 USD). Great CEO and CSO (the women behind crizotinib and sunitinib), potential best in class ROS1/TRK/ALK and RET inhibitors. The market cap is till quite modest (LOXO was taken out for >7B). I added during the late-summer depression, and will continue to add during periods of weakness.My Rodney Dangerfield long is: OVID (OVID, SP ca 3.9 USD, MC 190 M, EV 150 m). The CEO is Jeremy Levin (ex BMY top executive, ex TEVA executive (not responsible for the actual mess)). Great CEO with significant ownership in the company. I have written on OVID on this mb before, have owned and sold small amounts of shares , but only recently took a significant position (average price ca 2.9 USD). While OVID has a OV101 in ph 3 for Angelmann syndrome (with decent chance of success), my attention was re-ignited by OV 935, a cholesterol hydorxylase inhibitor, showing amazing results in rare epilepsy syndromes. Although a small , early trial only, the fact that seizure control became better, the longer patients were on OV935 is really noteworthy, with seizure reductions up to 90 % in a very hard to treat population. I think OVID will be a big winner, but one has to be patient. Last, but not least, of course, my nemesis Mimedx came back from the dead (MDXG, current SP ca 7.4, EV 750m, P/S still only 2.7, YTD SP-performance: 2.7-->7.4). I took a brutal hit last year, sold almost all at low prices, bought back at averaged 4.4 USD and before I know, MDXG has again become my largest US holding (larger even than TECH)... let's hope the good days last.However, I think that we are in for a good correction, especially in biotech, therefore I have a good amount of cash on the sidelines.FWIWDr John"
"Good bye 2018, hello 2019...For most of us, 2018 has been an ""annus horribilis"", for me even more so (due to individual judgment errors with performance shattering consequences (pex: MDXG), broad based declines in the biotech sector (pex FPRX) and in the cyclical sector (pex: HUN), which could not have been overcome by the stellar performance of individual stocks (FMI, NOVT, GHDX, BGNE (sold at 150-180), NBIX (sold at 108, reentered at 79) SGEN, CELG (re-entry short before buyout).I continue to be happy with big long term holdings, such as Bio-Techne (TECH 163 USD) or Becton Dickinson (BDX 242 USD).Taking advantage of the low prices end 2018, I have started (or added to) positions in Danaher (DHR, 105 USD, my buying price ca 96), Mettler Toledo (605 USD, my buying price ca 560), or -again- Gilead (GILD 69 USD, my price 69, after nomination of O'Day as CEO). I also bought (again) a moderate amount of Sage (SAGE 139 USD, my average price 102), Sarepta (SRPT 120 USD, ca my entry price) Madrigal (MDGL ca 117 USD, slightly above my entry price) and NBIX.Outside of healthcare/life science I initiated (or added to) some of my larger positions (many of them still in the red): Global Payment (GPN, at 114, my average price 120), Huntsman (HUN, ca 22 USD, m average price 24.5), International Game Technology (IGT, currently at 15, my average price 21(!): I don't quite understand the extent to which IGT has been decimated. It is a solid cash generator, can service its debt, trades at 7.2x EBITDA and is currently yielding 5.2%.Whats new on the horizon for 2019?Above from all the companies mentioned above, I'd like to mention 2 more companies in the molecular diagnostics/molecular research business: Nanostring (NSTG, ca 20 USD, MC 625m, cash 95m, debt 50 m, revenue 110m, EPS still negative) and Quanterix, which I mentioned here before at 16.5 USD (QTRX, ca 20 USD, MC 460 mill, revenue 2018 ca 33mill, cash 50 mill, debt 7mill, EPS still negative). both companies have intriguing products on the market with best-in-class features and a significant untapped market in front of them. --> more details on NSTG and QTRX to be followed in next postsFWIW Dr John"
"good bye 2020 - hello 2021 (part3)5. My dermatology pick is Arcutis (ARQT, ca 28 USD, MC ca 1.22B, 190m cash). Long-timers of this message board might remember Anacor (ANAC), a dermatology company being bought by Pfizer in 2016 for 4.5B USD. ANAC had a Boron-based topical PDE-4 Inhibitor for atopic dermatitis, and PFE was expecting a blockbuster. However, even though effective, Eucrisa (R) has not been very successful, due to poor tolerability (itching most probably due to Boron, unpleasant feel of the vehicle on the skin, etc) and sales are below 200m USD/y. Enters ARQT, which has its own topical PDE4-Inhibitor Roflumilast cream/foam in advanced clinical studies for Plaque Psoriasis, Atopic dermatitis, Seborrheic dermatitis. Tolerability and efficacy (up to now) of Roflumilast are excellent, and I think this topical drug will ultimately garner the revenue PFE hoped for with the acquisition of ANAC (i.e sales of 1.5-2.5B/y). I expect ARQT to be a very promising long term winner. My average buying price is ca 29 USD/Sh and I have now accumulated a rather large position, which I might increase in the coming months.6. I will not repeat my post from ca 3 weeks ago about companies which are involved the cell based development and development ecosystem and synthetic biology (pex BLI, TXG, TWST, Ginko Bioworks (private)) and computational driven drug discovery (pex SDGR). I would like to own them all, but currently have only a moderate-size position in SDGR (ca 79USD/share, Mc ca 5.5B) and a small position in BLI (89USD, MC 5.9B). These companies are almost prohibitively expensive, but -alas- I expect them to stay so for the foreseeable future, reason why I intend to build/extend positions on any weakness.7. Last, but not least: My very large Rodney Dangerfield position in Corvus (CRVS ca 3.55 USD, MC ca 100m) did not change. There seems to be no investor interest at all in this stock, which I find remarkable, since it has not only several compounds in the clinic, but in addition a very promising drug with CPI-006, a polyclonal B-cell stimulator inducing high titres of AG-specific IgM- and IgG-antibodies, B-memory cells and AG-specific T effector cells. CPI-006 is all the more appealing now, with new variants of SARS-CoV2 spreading around the world, which might not respond to vaccination. -Enough Blabla from my side! -Remember those tried-and true Words of Wisdom: ""When Dr John becomes logorrheic, there must be an imminent market-peak.""-Or, as a certain US-President uses to say: ""Sad, so sad"".

"BioTechne has become expensive (P/S 11, P/EBIT 36!), but so are many other life science companies as well. IMO, it makes sense to hold long term on high quality companies, such as TECH, even if valuations sometimes get rich. (okay, unless valuations become extreme, such as in 2000).One competitor of Techne's Protein Simple business unit is Quanterix (QTRX, currently at 16.7 USD (first mentioned on this mb about 1 m ago, at ca 15 USD), MC 370m, EV 290m). Quaterix' SIMOA assay/technology allows for an increased sensitivity of 3 orders of magnitude of detecting proteins (and in future also RNA, DNA) in the blood. SIMOA (=single molecule array) allows to detect trget molecules at fg/ml level, due to the ability to trap molecules in femtoliter sized wells of its array, thus allowing for detection of single molecules. Why is this interesting? Because it allows for ""non-invasive"" measurement of molecules (proteins) in the blood at levels, which up to now could not be measured with conventional instruments (due to their lower sensitivity, ie at pg/ml -ng/ml level). Therefore, markers for pre-symptomatic diseases states can be followed, which up to now were not accessible. This is promising not only for academic R&D, but may -almost inescapably- play a prominent role in future drug trials, disease follow-up, etc. Neurology, with its blood brain barrier (BBB) is on of the most interesting fields: tiny elevations of brain derived proteins pex Nf-L, Tau, Beat amyloid...), which in a disease (especially at early/pre-symptomatic levels) are elevated in the spinal fluid can now be measured in the blood as well (at fg/ml levels), thus giving a new opening to doing R&D and clinical follow up of some of the most important neurological diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), Alzheimer's (AD), brain concussion, etc. An recent publication in Brain shows the potential of the SIMOA technology in MS: Nf-L measurements in the blood correlated not only with disease activity, but also with brain and spinal cord atrophy up to 5 years later (brain atrophy and spinal cord atrophy are the most important predictors of disability in MS). Importantly, Nf-L measurements predicted disease course as well or better than brain-MRI does (and at lower costs). Taking the example of MS, it is likely that in future Nf-L SIMOA measurements will be ""mandatory"" not only for drug studies, but also in the clinical practice for monitoring patients and in the decision process whether to escalate treatment in a given MS- patient. Similar scenarios are likely in the dementias (pex AD).QTRX has a sound management team an BOD (including ex-Fisher Scientific and ex Bayer CEO M.Dekkers). It's growth has been accelerating (40-50%) and will do so even more in future due to increasing scientific publications, such as the Brain paper mentioned above. Revenue is:a) 40% consumables, 35% instruments; b) 60% US, 30% Europe, 10% Asia; c) 60% Pharma-Biotech, 40% Academia; d) 70% Neurology, 15% Oncology, the rest inflammation, cardiology etc; Head count is ca 150, whereof 40% in commercial/sales. Half year 2018 revenues were 16 m (vs 10.5 in the first half 2017) and the company expects to grow in the next couple of years by at least 40%. They are not yet cash flow positive. They have ca 60+ mill cash and no significant debt. The CEO owns ca 900'000 shares, Biomerieux 2 Mio shares. I think the path to success is quite clearly written, but it will be the long term story which is particularly interesting. A word on my big loosers: I added some 15-20 % of TSRO at 27.5. At ca 32 it is unbelievably cheap im eyes. Wait&see.With MDXG, I'll not add or sell unless there is news of a) new CEO and b) audited results. I still believe that the business is sound and 90% of what the old management team did was ok, but it is hard to keep confidence, when the top 3 had to quit.A while ago I sold my Radius (RDUS) at ca 36 (at a loss). Now I bought some back at 20.5. Also too cheap to ignore, IMO. By the way, BB-Biotech added to both, TSRO and RDUS at higher prices in the first Q. As to Five Prime (FPRX, ca 14 USD): continues to trade at a deep discount IMO, but the outlook is promising as ever.Luckily, not all is bleak: Novanta (NOVT) is continuing its stellar run (now at 76; excellent growth company, diversified markets & end customers, excellent management team), so does Neurocrine (NBIX, currently at 120 USD). Globus Medical (GMED, currently ca 52 USD) had good Q results as well and is a good quality company. Seattle genetics (SGEN, currently at 76) is doing just fine as well (could be had not long ago for 50 USD).All in all a horrible 2018 for me (down almost 15%), took my portfolio to the beginning of 2017... ah well, as the Austrians use to say: It's catastrophic but nothing serious.What else? Took positions a while ago in the 3 CRISPR companies (CRSP >EDIT = NTLA). Long term holdings. Too much potential to stay aside...regardsDr John"
Dr John thanks for the recent updates. You have thrown out some interesting ideas to look into. Good call so far on ARQT. And I will second congratulating ByeHl on the SAVA call. Truly outstanding. Dr John I just read your post on the CRVS board about the revenue Lilly had in the 4Q from its ‘anti Covid-man’. My only thought is timing. Don’t you think it is too early with CRVS? Let’s assume trials continue to go well. At minimum isn’t the CRVS candidate 2 or 3 years away? That has been my concern from the first time you mentioned CRVS. Anyway thanks for the updates Dr John. And cheers to yet another great quarter by TECH!!! The one we could always count on.

"Talk about resilience and quality: While the biotech sector (at least the mid and small cap sector) and some of the more speculative medtech stocks have been in a bear market for some weeks, BioTechne is reaching new highs. Actually, it is fair to say that small and midcap biotechs are having one of their well known crashes, which come about with annoying (and nevertheless predictable) regularity. I recently started to add to some of my positions, such as Kinsika (KNSA, currently at ca 15.5), which I bought into at exactly the wrong moment (average buying price ca 22 USD), but think that the company is worth considerably more than 1B. I also bought back a large portion of my stakes - which I sold at considerable higher prices- in Kodiak (KOD, currently ca 115) at ca 106, Crisper (CRSP , currently 118 USD) at 102, Beam (BEAM, currently at 72.5) at 73, and Quanterix (QTRX currently 61 USD) at 64. Thinking of adding to Turning Point (TPTX) in the mid 60's, of Arrowhead (ARWR) in the 50's if ever they come down to that level, or add to Arcutis (ARQT, currently ca 27USD) in the low 20's. I also added to smaller positions, such as Akero (AKRO currently ca 27.5 USD), Oric (ORIC, ca 21.5 USD), and Avidity (RNA, ca 20.5 USD), and started a small Position in Prelude (PRLD currently at 32.5) at current prices. I did not, however, add to those small positions in highflying medtech stocks (all in solidly in the red), such as Berkley Lights (BLI) Twist (TWST) or Seer (SEER), which are still expensive, nor did I add to Schrödinger (SDGR), where I was lucky enough to sell most of my position before the fall.FWIWDr JohnBTW: Avidity (RNA) and Oric (ORIC) are both early stage (preclinical --> clinical), but very promising companies, with excellent scientists at the helm and top execs with a proven track record."
"Hi Dr. John, I just wanted to stop in and see what your plan of action has been on a couple of stocks. Namely TSRO and AXDX. Are you adding, standing pat, selling any?"
