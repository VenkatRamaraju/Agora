Bio-Techne reached an all time high at 342.98
"It has been a good year so far ( I needed this after ""annus horribilis 2018"").-I put a good amount of money into life science/ genomics stocks, all with good results (NSTG, NVTA, NEO, NTRA, GHDX), sometimes trimmed positions, sometimes added (recently I trimmed).-I bought a midsize mount of Catalent (CTLT at ca 48 (now 54.5), after they bought Paragon: gene therapies are here to stay.-I continue to have a good run with QTRX, NSTG and of course with TECH (Bio-Techne). -I bought early enough into Turning Point Therapeutics TPTX (average price 30 USD, now 41), but sold MRTX too early (the theme in both: presonalized cancer therapy/origin agnositc cancer therapy. In this space, there was Loxo (bought by Lilly) and Ignyta (bought by Roche), ad there is Blueprint (BPMC) MRTX and TPTX left. -I had a good run with SRPT and with some SGEN and INCY trades, but fared less well -so far- with NASH companies ICPT and MDGL (that is, after having been lucky enough to sell MDGL at 280 a year or so ago) -GPN (Global payments), my second largest holding, continues to do extremely well and IGT (International Game Technologies continues to disappoint (has now a 6% dividend).-Recently I raised again my cash position significantly.My current largest holdings in the US are: TECH, GPN, MDXG, BDX, QTRX, DHRMy largest Biotech holdings are: AUPH, ICPT, MYOK, ICPT, TGTX, CCXI , MDGL (I sold SRPT, one of my large Biotech holdings today).-I am very comfortable with BioTechne (TECH, ca211 USD) (C.K. does ll the right things, almost all of his recent buys were just spectacular, not to forget Liquid biopsy company Exosome Diagnostics). TECH is pricey, yes, and I sold some 10%, but it's a great long term holding. Speaking of lofty prices: I sold today my last shares of Novanta (NOVT), a great company (see previous posts). Probably a mistake to sell, but then again...)-I am equally comfortable with the midterm-long term outlook for Quanterix (QTRX (now ca 30 USD, I mentioned it here around 20, I think). The application of their serum biomarkes at pmol quantity (SIMOA) has been exploding and will continue to do so. I am equally positive about Nanostring (NSTG (ca 28 USD, I mentioned it at around 20 USD, I think). I sold all of my AXDX and I think NSTG will be the main competitor for them in a couple of years, rather sooner than later. I won't sell QTRX or NSTG, but will add on any significant weakness.As to biotech: Myokardia (MYOK) has great science and so far showed excellent study results in HOCM, and -IMHO- is undervalued at 48 USD, (i.e an EV of 1.7B USD). I also think, that NASH-leader Intercept (ICPT) is vastly undervalued at 78.5, (ie an EV of 2.5B USD) and that NASH competitor Madrigal (MDGL) is trading at attractive levels at ca 100 USD, (ie an EV of just a little bit over 1B USD).I bought again back into healthcare software company Inovalon (INOV) and built a decent position. I owned it earlier (& wrote about it here) but performance has been poor due to several roadblocks which seem now behind.I have built up a large MDXG position - again. I continue to think that the company is having superior products, that PP did a lot of stupid things but still was a excellent strategist. The new board is fine, the CEO seems to be ok as well, and MDXG is now very cheap. For comparisons, look at the multiple at which Osiris was sold to S&NregardsDr. JohnPS: and I am dippig the big toe again into O&G: bought some Diamondback Energy (FANG), some Corel Labs (CLB), RPC (RES) and added to my loosing Schlumberger (SLB) position...."

"LMP, I'll post my reply to your question here in a separate (Yahoo lives up to its reputation ""making things worse is what we do best"": since the mb have been ""upgraded"" one does not see anymore t one glance, which message has been posted most recently...)As to your question concerning the valuation of Accelerate Diagnostics (AXDX, currently at 28 USD, MC ca 1.5 B USD): I don’t use DCF-spread sheets in my decisions to buy or sell shares in a certain company. I use an amalgam of quality/integrity of top management (and BOD), my perceived value of the intellectual property (including moat), balance sheet and market potential and growth prospects/profitability.AXDX top execs have a excellent track report. The Pheno Systems is way ahead of the competition (even though competition is alive and kicking). AXDX’s balance sheet is fine. As to the market opportunity/growth potential: Speaking of the global market which AXDX is targeting, there are about 20’000 instruments installed, which means that AXDX is tapping into a market representing ca 2 billion instrument revenue, ie non-recurring revenue. The 3 large player in this market are BD/Becton Dickinson (which is a large long term holding of mine), Danaher (which is a medium large long term holding of mine) and Bio Mérieux. These are fine companies and they don’t sleep. However, we should not underestimate AXDX’s first mover advantage. There is a 5 year replacement cycle in those instruments. Once labs/hospitals have been convinced to use the Pheno System, they will most likely stick to it for some time. New entrants will have to show that they are significantly better than the Pheno System, which is much more difficult to prove, than what AXDX is doing now, namely showing that the Pheno System is superior to traditional methodology relying on naphalometry. Switching to recurring revenue: There are about14 millions tests done yearly on theses 20’000 instruments, representing a 2.5 Billion recurring revenue stream. Taken altogether, AXDX wants to take as much as it can of a this combined revenue. I cannot predict, how fast the Pheno System will be adopted. I guess that after some initial hesitancy there will be kind of a push for other hospitals/labs to follow the lead (quite similar to the Da Vinci story: Nowadays, hospitals MUST offer surgery by Da Vinci). Now to the valuation: Let's attribute AXDX a EV/sales multiple of 8-10 (which is generous, but not unusual in fast growing medtech companies). Let’s assume the total market is 2.5 Bill. consumables plus 400 mill instrument revenue (1/5 of the 2 Billion instrument market assuming a 5 y replacement cycle), ie roughly 3 Billion. 10% of this market is 300M, 15% 450mill 20% 600mill. Applying a 8-10x EV/R ratio this gives you an enterprise value (or market cap, assuming no debt) of 2.4-3B (10% market share), 3.6-4.5 B (15% market share) or 4.8-6Billion (20% market share). Assuming AXDX achieves this goal in 5 years and we buy AXDX today at 28 USD/share, we’ll look into a CAGR in stock price of 15%-30%, (ie a doubling to quadrupling of the stock price within 5y), good enough for me…regardsDr John"
Bio-Techne reached an all time high at 289.95
Dr John i wonder if you can comment on the Moderna (MRNA) Phase 1 results? These are the 1st results I've seen since this pandemic began that give me huge hope a vaccine is closer than we think. I know this was a very small and early phase 1. But it did trigger the antibody response you want to see!!!
TECH is down 8.69% to 164.01
"Dr John, I noticed that ARCT was getting hit hard after hours. I wonder if you can compare ARCT’s covid19 vaccine candidate with Corvus. I remember watching a presentation on YouTube in which a representative from ARCT said that out of 78 participants that received the vaccine in the early trial; that 77 of them had positive results in terms of antibody and T-cell response."
Dr John---- it has been awhile since I posted. As I took on a new job and literally moved 2 time zones away. Hope all is well. I just wanted to drop in and say that I see that TSRO got bought out today. 60% premium. I know this had been one of your favorites in the past!

"Dr. John, I left some replies to you below. But I want to make an observation. I have been reading your stuff for years and years and years. When it comes to Healthcare there is nobody better. I have used your great insights to make much money over the years. But I also noticed you are still trying to average in some oil and gas stocks. For the life of me I don't understand your angle their. You oil and gas plays over the years haven't been nearly as successful as you healthcare plays. Oil and gas is like a mine field. It is Russian roulette. I don't want anything to do with that industry. I've seen them all DESTROYED over the last year or so..."

"@Dr John, I just increased my TECH position by 70% this week! That is how bullish I am on this company for the long-term. Also, would you be buying more QTRX? Seems NSTG is having a better go in terms of stock price, lately."
"So far, so good.Bio-Techne had another stellar quarter and is finishing another stellar year, thanks to a shrewd acquisition strategy. To think of 1: All (or almost all) or the companies Biotechne acquired during these past 5+ years have turned out to be stunning winners. Kudo to CK and his team. To think of 2: One could buy shares in February at a price of 160-170 USD. The SP almost doubled since then."
$75 billion market share and we will gain a large part. #fast #tech
"Thoughts about three appealing high risk biotech companies (which I have been buying lately).One two three: Let’s start, in desecending order, with te most risky one: Arcus (ACRS, currently ca 14 USD, market cap 300 mill USD, whereof 50% cash, no debt) is led by former Pharmacyclis-top execs (CEO, CFO). CRVS in an early stage biotech, which, together with Arcus (private, ex Intermune guys) and to some extent with Halozyme (HALO) focus on the Adenosin-cancer axis, a promising „new“ IO-traget in cancer treatment. CRVS develop Adenosine A2A Receptor antagonists and anti-CD73. While we deal here with a very early stage biotech (=risky), I like the combination of CRVS’ focus on Adenosin Cancer pathway, coupled with top pharma execs and a reasanoable valuation. THE BOD has an okay mix of VC guys and Genentech execs. Syros (SYRS currently ca 11 USD, EV 160 mill USd, 90mill cash, no debt): top execs from Medimmune, Vertex and Infinity. Focusing on the „regulatory genome“ ie the 98% of non-protein coding genome, especially on regulatory transcription factors in oncology, such as RAR-alpha-agonists and CDK7 inhibitors. Their lead product SY-1425, a selective oral RAR-alpha-agonist, has already been approved in Japan since 2005 as Amnilake (=tamibarotene) for APL (acute promyelocytic leucemia) with RARA gene fusions. With over 1000 treated patients, the side effects (moderate) are well known. SYRS-1425 is now being studied (proof of concept ph2) together with a RARA- biomarker discovered by SYRS for more targeted therapy for RARA-biomarker-positive AML and MDS patients. About 25% of the 30’000 patients with AML and MDS each (incidence in USA, Canada Europe) are RARA positive. Future plans include (possible) expansion into RARA+-breast cancer.SYRS-1365, a highly selective CDK7-Inhibitor which does not significantly bind to other cell cycle-CDK’s such as CDK9. CDK7 is a key player in driving transcription; inhibiton of CDK7 decreases expression of oncogenic transcription factors, thus inducing aptoptosis preferentially in cancer cells. SYRS-1365 is in IND enabling phase 1 studies for solid tumors (ovarian cancer, TNBC, SCLC). SYRS also has several preclinical candidates in the pipeline and plans for one new IND every other year. While SYRS is a bit more advanced than CRVS, it is still an early stage biotech with all its inherent risks. However, as with CRVS, I like the focused approach and the seasoned management team. The BOD has amongst others, seasoned scientists such as Nobel laureate Phil Sharp, but –unfortunately- also controverse figures such as S.Bancel from Moderna.LOXO (LOXO, 45 USD, EV 830 mill USD, 150 mill cash no debt) is developing targeted kinase inhibitors. A very targeted approach usually means a small patient population with increased chance to respond to the targeted drug and a shorter development cycle form IND to NDA. Loxo-101 (larotrectinib) is a highly specific kinase inhibitor (much more specific, pex., than ponatinib or than Ignytas kinase inhibiors). It is being studied in 2 ph1 and ph1/2 tirals with pediatric and adult patients with TRK fusion cancers across tumor types (breakthrough designation for unresectable or metastatic tumors with NTRK fusions). Top line data are epected in the scond half of 2017. NDA submission is expected in late 2017/early 2018. The company expects about 1500-5000/y eligible patients (in the US, with similar numers in Europe and Japan). LOXO-195, a next gen, specific TRK-kinase-inhibitor might be especially active against several acquired mutation resitances and will enter ph1 in mid 2017, as will LOXO 292 a highly specifit RET inhibitor.Unlike CRVS and SYRS, LOXO had a good run up lately, but I consider it still appealing now (we might of course see prices down by 50% in the next biotech shakeup). By the way, Blueprint Medical (BPMC) is somewhat similar to LOXO has quite impressive exectutives and a market cap in the range of LOXO’s. Compare the two.regardsDr. John"
TECH reached a new All Time High at 146.39
"BioTechne has become expensive (P/S 11, P/EBIT 36!), but so are many other life science companies as well. IMO, it makes sense to hold long term on high quality companies, such as TECH, even if valuations sometimes get rich. (okay, unless valuations become extreme, such as in 2000).One competitor of Techne's Protein Simple business unit is Quanterix (QTRX, currently at 16.7 USD (first mentioned on this mb about 1 m ago, at ca 15 USD), MC 370m, EV 290m). Quaterix' SIMOA assay/technology allows for an increased sensitivity of 3 orders of magnitude of detecting proteins (and in future also RNA, DNA) in the blood. SIMOA (=single molecule array) allows to detect trget molecules at fg/ml level, due to the ability to trap molecules in femtoliter sized wells of its array, thus allowing for detection of single molecules. Why is this interesting? Because it allows for ""non-invasive"" measurement of molecules (proteins) in the blood at levels, which up to now could not be measured with conventional instruments (due to their lower sensitivity, ie at pg/ml -ng/ml level). Therefore, markers for pre-symptomatic diseases states can be followed, which up to now were not accessible. This is promising not only for academic R&D, but may -almost inescapably- play a prominent role in future drug trials, disease follow-up, etc. Neurology, with its blood brain barrier (BBB) is on of the most interesting fields: tiny elevations of brain derived proteins pex Nf-L, Tau, Beat amyloid...), which in a disease (especially at early/pre-symptomatic levels) are elevated in the spinal fluid can now be measured in the blood as well (at fg/ml levels), thus giving a new opening to doing R&D and clinical follow up of some of the most important neurological diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), Alzheimer's (AD), brain concussion, etc. An recent publication in Brain shows the potential of the SIMOA technology in MS: Nf-L measurements in the blood correlated not only with disease activity, but also with brain and spinal cord atrophy up to 5 years later (brain atrophy and spinal cord atrophy are the most important predictors of disability in MS). Importantly, Nf-L measurements predicted disease course as well or better than brain-MRI does (and at lower costs). Taking the example of MS, it is likely that in future Nf-L SIMOA measurements will be ""mandatory"" not only for drug studies, but also in the clinical practice for monitoring patients and in the decision process whether to escalate treatment in a given MS- patient. Similar scenarios are likely in the dementias (pex AD).QTRX has a sound management team an BOD (including ex-Fisher Scientific and ex Bayer CEO M.Dekkers). It's growth has been accelerating (40-50%) and will do so even more in future due to increasing scientific publications, such as the Brain paper mentioned above. Revenue is:a) 40% consumables, 35% instruments; b) 60% US, 30% Europe, 10% Asia; c) 60% Pharma-Biotech, 40% Academia; d) 70% Neurology, 15% Oncology, the rest inflammation, cardiology etc; Head count is ca 150, whereof 40% in commercial/sales. Half year 2018 revenues were 16 m (vs 10.5 in the first half 2017) and the company expects to grow in the next couple of years by at least 40%. They are not yet cash flow positive. They have ca 60+ mill cash and no significant debt. The CEO owns ca 900'000 shares, Biomerieux 2 Mio shares. I think the path to success is quite clearly written, but it will be the long term story which is particularly interesting. A word on my big loosers: I added some 15-20 % of TSRO at 27.5. At ca 32 it is unbelievably cheap im eyes. Wait&see.With MDXG, I'll not add or sell unless there is news of a) new CEO and b) audited results. I still believe that the business is sound and 90% of what the old management team did was ok, but it is hard to keep confidence, when the top 3 had to quit.A while ago I sold my Radius (RDUS) at ca 36 (at a loss). Now I bought some back at 20.5. Also too cheap to ignore, IMO. By the way, BB-Biotech added to both, TSRO and RDUS at higher prices in the first Q. As to Five Prime (FPRX, ca 14 USD): continues to trade at a deep discount IMO, but the outlook is promising as ever.Luckily, not all is bleak: Novanta (NOVT) is continuing its stellar run (now at 76; excellent growth company, diversified markets & end customers, excellent management team), so does Neurocrine (NBIX, currently at 120 USD). Globus Medical (GMED, currently ca 52 USD) had good Q results as well and is a good quality company. Seattle genetics (SGEN, currently at 76) is doing just fine as well (could be had not long ago for 50 USD).All in all a horrible 2018 for me (down almost 15%), took my portfolio to the beginning of 2017... ah well, as the Austrians use to say: It's catastrophic but nothing serious.What else? Took positions a while ago in the 3 CRISPR companies (CRSP >EDIT = NTLA). Long term holdings. Too much potential to stay aside...regardsDr John"

"Dr. John, there is a post of your from about mid February, in which you listed 3 promising 'high risk' bio-techs. ACRS, SYRS and LOXO. It appears they have all been up HUGE. Once again, you always manage to find diamonds in the rough, Dr. John.... As an aside, did you see Clovis(CLVS) got a 50% bounce up today?"
"Dr John, we are finally seeing some M&A activity in Biotech. And I think that is why TSRO and TGTX were up huge today! JUNO getting bought by Celgene. And Sanofi also made a purchase. Though, with Sanofi spending that kind of cash, that may eliminate them from buying TSRO. All in all, it has been quite a while since we have seen the whole Sector get a bump. MDXG also had a very good day. Many companies have a bunch of cash on their Balance Sheet. I wouldn't be surprised to see more M&A activity come our way. Hopefully TSRO is on that list. Or even a RDUS for that matter."
"Congrats Dr John! One of your top 10 holdings; ALXN, got bought out this morning."
TECH is down 4.91% to $174.37
"This & thatThe market is hot and biotech was not left behind. The takeover of Immunogen (IMMU) by Gilead for ca 20 B USD was very high, my guess is: too high. Not so the 13 B paid by Bristol Myers for Myokardia (MOYK), which has first class science and, unlike Immunogen, is in a field with limited direct competition. I was, of course, very pleased about the deal, since Myokardia has been one of my large holdings (I first wrote about it in 2019, when it was ca 48 USD, and sold today at 220, +/- the takeout price). MYOK's allosteric inhibitor of myosin has consistently shown excellent results in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Also apart from Myokardia, the year 2020 has been kind to me, rewarding my largest positions with markedly higher valuations: TGTX (TGTX, ca 30.5 USD, MC 3.85 B USD) has almost tripled this year, thanks to positive news flow and Wall Street seeing the glass suddenly as half full. Due to this gain, TGTX has in my portfolio overtaken even Bio-Techne (TECH). Close behind TGTX (and before TECH) comes Turning Point Therapeutics (TPTX, ca 118 USD, MC almost 5B USD). Its lead drug, Reprotrectinib has the ingredients to become the leading ROS/TRK Inhibitor out there. I mentioned TPTX shortly after its IPO, somewhere in the 30's, and this year alone the share price doubled from 60 --> 120. Aurinia (AUPH, ca 15.5, MC ca 2B) on the other hand, lost (21-->15.5) during the year (after the big run-up end of last year). The company deserves more credit for Voclosporine, especially if the dry eye syndrome trial will be positive (which I expect). I bought more AUPH in spring in the high 13's and continue to hold.I established two large new positions during the second half of the year: On is Arrowhead (ARWR, 46 USS, MC 4.7B). The CEO is very smart (and knows it). A couple of years ago he bought Roche's and Novartis' RNA-interference pipeline/intellectual property, a smart move. I think, ARWR is by far the most promising si-RNA company out there, and all results published so far have been stellar, most recently in Alpha1 AT-deficiency-associated liver disease, paving the way for a lucrative deal with Takeda. My average buying price is about 37, and I expect the company to be be worth considerably more than the actual share price of 48, for those willing to wait. (BTW, I sold today10% of TPTX, TGTX and QTRX to increase my cash position, and bought 10% more of ARWR). In order to buy ARWR, I sold my positions in NBIX and XLRN (not that these names are not attractive at current valuations....)My second new large position, is Corvus (CRVS, ca 4 USD, MC ca 110 m USD), which has been discussed here recently several times, reason why I will not repeat my bull case for the company. It stays stubbornly undervalued, which is great for those, like me, who want to pick up shares. Corvus continues to deliver amazing results with CPI-006 in Covid-19 and the compound has a very large field of potential indications, but the street is either missing the point, or not believing it (an enigma to me). My average price for CRVS is +/- the current price.I decreased a midsize position in Ovid (OVID, 5.5 USD, MC 350m) to a small position (at a good gain). Ovid-935, a C24H-inhibitor showed positive results in a midstage trial in rare epilepsy syndromes, placing it squarely between the results published earlier on by GW-Therapeutics (GWTX) and Arena (ARNA). Ovid has a very good CEO and has further upside potential with Ovid-101, but I preferred to put the money into Corvus.Then there has been rewards in my 2 large Medtech holdings (spart from BioTechne) as well. Quanterix (QTRX, 44 USD, MC ca 1.4B) doubled this year so far, and Nanostring (NSTG, 40.5 USD, MC 1.5B) is up by 50% (see older posts in 2018,2019). I continue to hold both. I reduced my positions in most of my O&G holding, some at a good gain and was lucky enough to do some lucrative trades pex Core Labs (CLB), tripling from a low of 9 to 27 (now back at 16). However most of the remaining O&G positions are well in the red (SLB, FANG, sold out of WPX today), while RPC (RES) is mildly in the red. March2020 was good for some beaten down names, such as Viacom (VIAC my average price 15, now 28), or Bed,Bath&_Beyond (BBBY, my average price 8, now 21), however my long term looser, International Game Technology (IGT, currently at ca 11USD, my average price ca 16) is still in my portfolio...Taken altogether, what would I buy now, at current prices? CRVS, ARWR and probably -again- some O&G outfits (SLB, CLB, FANG) when the weakness continues.Dr John"
"Well, well well, nowadays those biotech crashes do not seem to occur every 4 years, but every 4 months ...Just when you dug yourself out oft hat dark hole and started to enjoy the view ...boaff!! you’re covered by yet another avalanche. Many of those winners turned to loosers again (first of all RDUS from 58 down to 37), and those which started to recover from their ultra low lows fell to newer mega lows (such as TGTX). Only one single shining star (SGEN) continues to climb from one high to another.Have there been any fundamental, company specific changes (other than Clinton/Trump, which are not company specific fundamental changes), which justifies the sell off? Not that I know of, certainly not for RDUS, NBIX, VSAR or SAGE. Some companies even had good news to tell: INCY (good sales momentum, good pipeline news), CCXI (will be advancing a CCR5-antagonist into the clinic for NASH (remember, that AGN bough PCRX for the NASH indication only for about 650mill), etc. (MDXG reported better than expected earnings and their future is bright, but the stock dived from 9 to 7.8 in a few days).TGTX had some mildly negative news and fell, amongst other, because they amended one stud protocol, (main reason: poor enrollment due to too many competing tirals), which I expected already a long time ago. I (still) think that TGTX is ridiculously cheap at 5.1, but since I already have a large position I don’t (yet). I wrote on PTCT when it was 12, and about 2 days later it tanked 40% because of a continued negative stance of the FDA regarding their DMD-drug. I decided to sell intraday at 9 and change (bought in the 6’s, therefore still a nice gain) and was amazed to see it fall further so much (now at 4.5!). However, I actually mentioned PTCT not because of DMD, but because of tis SMA program (see previous post), and that story did not change. Still, in view of the louse sentiment towards biotech I don’t take new risky positions at present.I did learn a LITTLE BIT from those past downturns and managed to raise considerable cash before the downturn by selling “non core” position, such as PGNX (at 54-58), ALDR (at 29-30), MGNX (sold at ca 30, and now bought back between 23 and 20) and ICPT (at 160, now bought back at ca 107) and sold some NBIX at ca 47. Besides those buys just mentioned I added some VSAR (at 10), GILD (at 72.6), RDUS (at 36.7) and I started a smallish position in SRPT (at 36-38). In the low 7’s I might add more to MDXG in the high 30’s I might add again to NBIX, and to FPRX in the low 40’sAm thinking about starting a position again in Qiagen (QGEN ca 26USD) and PDCO (ca 43 USD), but not quite yet.regards Dr John"

"This was posted on CRVS page, I know there is CRVS talk here so thought you might like ECRMC TO PARTICIPATE IN IMMUNOTHERAPY CLINICAL TRIAL FOR COVID-19October 1, 2020EL CENTRO, CA – October 1, 2020 – El Centro Regional Medical Center (ECRMC) has announced it will be participating in an additional clinical trial to battle COVID-19. The trial, which is run by Corvus Pharmaceuticals, Inc., studies the use of a novel immunotherapy for hospitalized patients with COVID-19.Christian A. Tomaszewski, M.D. will be the lead investigator for ECRMC. “We’ve seen a great deal of challenges in COVID-19 treatment,” said Dr. Tomaszewski. “But the potential for new treatments is there and ECRMC is pleased to be able to help study these treatments.”The purpose of the trial is to study a novel humanized monoclonal antibody, designated CPI-006, as an immunotherapy for mild to moderately ill COVID-19 patients that require hospitalization. CPI-006 activates B cells leading to the production of antigen-specific immunoglobulin (IgM and IgG), as well as increased levels of memory B Cells, which are responsible for long-term immunity.The overall goal of this trial is to determine CPI-006’s potential to enhance antibody responses to COVID-19, improve clinical outcomes, and prolong immunity. This trial has been enrolling COVID-19 patients and so far, preliminary results indicate that CPI-006 boosts immunity to the virus.“The finding of increased anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in patients with COVID-19 treated so far is encouraging and a good reason to study this further,” said Dr. Tomaszewki. “We want to find a way to boost antibodies to attack the virus and to encourage long-term immunity and recovery.”The study will enroll up to 25 inpatient participants. Potential participants are at least 18 years old and have mild to moderate COVID-19 related illness that requires hospitalization. If successful, this treatment will increase the immune response to the COVID-19 infection and may lead to faster viral clearance, shorter recovery time, less complications and longer lasting immunity. In the future, it is also possible that it can assist healthy people by improving the efficacy of vaccines."

"1st QUARTER THOUGHTS...The year has been rather friendly up to now. Finally MDXG (ca 11.75 USD) is getting back the respect it deserves (I added another 5% when it went below 8 a couple of weeks ago). Pete& team continue to deliver as promised. To think of it, MDXG has become twice a large position as Techne (ca 100 USD), partly because I trimmed my TECH position during the years now and the a bit, but of course also because of MDXG’s better stock performance.Investors are still in wait&see mood when it comes to Accelerate diagnostics (AXDX, ca 25USD). The share price hovers about 10% above where it was just prior to the FDA marketing authorization of the Pheno System. If 1Q sales are good (which I expect), I predict a significant upward move in AXDX’s share price. CEO Mehren indicated that the most difficult persons to convince are not the doctors or the hospital administration, but the Head of Laboratories. The Pheno System will be a success. It is not excluded that the Lab Chiefs need some more time to be convinced, (which would spell opportunity to load up more shares), even though I think ramp up will go nicely. I did not add to my holding, but migh do so after Q1 release.I was kind of relieved to see the much deserved doubling in TGTX' share price (now 10.3. EV 540Mill, still not expensive). There was so much negativism about the stock (many doubters are still out there), including BB and RA Capital selling share (at the wrong moment), that you needed to maintain your cool. When TGTX became my largest Biotech holding (at 14) I sold about 40% of my shares at a nice gain (between 12-13.5). I keep the remaining 60%, still a considerable holding.GILD continues to lag, and I bought 10% more at about 66.5 (cheaper now at 65.9). Gilead WILL make an acquisition, and I still guess it will be Tesaro (TSRO ca 136 USD). Which leads us to TSRO: I sold some 20% at 175+, bought them back at ca 145 and added another 10% at the end of last week at ca 137. Yes, there is some competition (AZN, PFE/MDVN, CLVS), but TSRO has the broadest label and the best results. GILD will not buy a Ford such as CLVS, but usually sticks with the Bentleys.I (as many others) did not expect a CR for Incyte’s/Lilly’s baricitinib (INCY ca 123 USD). The CR shaved about a combined 6.5 Billion USD from LLY and INCY market cap. (To compare: TSRO’s EV currently is 6.5B. A buyout will be at north of 8.5 B IMO). I did not trade any INCY shares, but I sold some 15-20% of Seattle Genetics (SGEN ca 65 USD) about at current prices.As I have indicated before I have built quite a large position in Beigene (BGNE, ca 36.7USD), which did not do much since I last mentioned the stock. It is a long term holding, its pipeline is early and midstage, but very promising.In my last post I mentioned three risky stocks Corvus (CRVS, then 14, now 9.7), Syros (SYRS, then 11, now 15) and Loxo (LOXO, then 45, now 47.5). I sold CRVS, definitively the most risky of the three, at a loss, after the disappointing results for its lead drug A2AR-antagonist surfaced. The still have some potential left, but I move on to more promising pastures…. ...Such as Five Prime Therapeutics (FPRX, currenlty ca 33 USD, market cap of a bit over 900 m USD but with almost 50% of it cash, FPRX spots an EV of only 485 m USD. FPRX is a R&D powerhouse dedicated to immune-oncology, has already signed several deals, amongst others with BMY and has an albeit early, but very large and promising pipeline. It’s a long distance runner, not a sprinter, but the current low shares price is IMO an excellent possibility to build a position. (I started buying at higher prices and thus am >10% in the red, which however does not bother me. I build quite a large position in FPRX, larger than CCXI, a position which I trimmed by about 40%. CCXI is solid and all, but at some point I thought that my position in it might be somewhat too large, compared to other alternatives.RDUS is still fighting with the doubters. Will abaloparatide experience baricitinib’s fate and end up with a –surprise!- CR-letter? I dunno, but –of course- don’t expect this to be the case (otherwise I’d sell m shares). I have a large position, mildly in the red, and a CR would be significant hit to the portfolio performance…In the ""non-biotech space"", my three underperformers from last year, the healthcare data platform company Inovalon (INOV, currently 11.6 USD), waste recycling company Stericycle (SRCL (currently 86 USD) and avionics company Esterline (ESL currently 87.5 USD) all showed promising signs of a business turnaround, which I hope will continue to strengthen. Barge operator Kirby (KEX, ca 70 USD), one of my top 5 holding is continuing it’s slow uphill move (with some O&G prices related mood swings), but will be an excellent long term investment. Mining/O&G-workforce accommodation company Civeo (CVEO, ca 3.25 USD), finally surged >40% this year, and out of a loosing position came a winning one. I sold about 30% at current prices and continue to hold the rest for the long term. CVEO’s share price was >20, when it was was spun off Oil States International (OIS). I started to buy at 12, then at 6, then at 3 and then, “big again” at <1… In the end a profitable outcome…but is it worth the stress…?)RegardsDr John"

"Drr John, we are getting a very nice run on MDXG! Also AXDX having a very nice day as well. Both up almost 7%. I've been tracking many of your mentions from your last several posts. Most of them are doing very nicely! TGTX gave us a great bounce about a month ago! Hope all is well. And I look forward to your next visit to this board. I wonder if you might be buying more AXDX?

"Wow Drr. John, you sure know how to pick them! AXDX never goes down. I got in about 4 weeks ago, and I'm not sure the stock has been down more than 2 days, that entire time! LOL! They had earnings yesterday. Wow! Am I ever impressed. You can just see how this technology is going to save hospitals, patients and society alot of money! AND, they hinted at some respiratory test(seems a little hush hush) they are developing that will produce results in something like 10 hours vs the current norm of 48 hours. My goodness! Would you be adding Drr. John, or hoping for a pull-back? It's hard to tell if the stock is getting ahead of itself. But, it is also hard to determine what kind of market cap would be appropriate for AXDX. As an aside, do you think this would be a decent time to pick up some cheap RDUS shares. I don't have any position, and even though I don't love the osteo space, it seems the market is discounting RDUS too much?"
"Hi Dr. John, I just wanted to stop in and see what your plan of action has been on a couple of stocks. Namely TSRO and AXDX. Are you adding, standing pat, selling any?"

"good bye 2020 - hello 2021 (part3)5. My dermatology pick is Arcutis (ARQT, ca 28 USD, MC ca 1.22B, 190m cash). Long-timers of this message board might remember Anacor (ANAC), a dermatology company being bought by Pfizer in 2016 for 4.5B USD. ANAC had a Boron-based topical PDE-4 Inhibitor for atopic dermatitis, and PFE was expecting a blockbuster. However, even though effective, Eucrisa (R) has not been very successful, due to poor tolerability (itching most probably due to Boron, unpleasant feel of the vehicle on the skin, etc) and sales are below 200m USD/y. Enters ARQT, which has its own topical PDE4-Inhibitor Roflumilast cream/foam in advanced clinical studies for Plaque Psoriasis, Atopic dermatitis, Seborrheic dermatitis. Tolerability and efficacy (up to now) of Roflumilast are excellent, and I think this topical drug will ultimately garner the revenue PFE hoped for with the acquisition of ANAC (i.e sales of 1.5-2.5B/y). I expect ARQT to be a very promising long term winner. My average buying price is ca 29 USD/Sh and I have now accumulated a rather large position, which I might increase in the coming months.6. I will not repeat my post from ca 3 weeks ago about companies which are involved the cell based development and development ecosystem and synthetic biology (pex BLI, TXG, TWST, Ginko Bioworks (private)) and computational driven drug discovery (pex SDGR). I would like to own them all, but currently have only a moderate-size position in SDGR (ca 79USD/share, Mc ca 5.5B) and a small position in BLI (89USD, MC 5.9B). These companies are almost prohibitively expensive, but -alas- I expect them to stay so for the foreseeable future, reason why I intend to build/extend positions on any weakness.7. Last, but not least: My very large Rodney Dangerfield position in Corvus (CRVS ca 3.55 USD, MC ca 100m) did not change. There seems to be no investor interest at all in this stock, which I find remarkable, since it has not only several compounds in the clinic, but in addition a very promising drug with CPI-006, a polyclonal B-cell stimulator inducing high titres of AG-specific IgM- and IgG-antibodies, B-memory cells and AG-specific T effector cells. CPI-006 is all the more appealing now, with new variants of SARS-CoV2 spreading around the world, which might not respond to vaccination. -Enough Blabla from my side! -Remember those tried-and true Words of Wisdom: ""When Dr John becomes logorrheic, there must be an imminent market-peak.""-Or, as a certain US-President uses to say: ""Sad, so sad"". Dr John"
"@ByeHI: as to EDAP (a medtech company based in Lyon, France) which you mentioned earlier (EDAP, ca 8.7USD, MC 250m, Rev 2019 ca 40m, earnings 1.5m, rev 2020 (Covid) ca 20 less, but good last Q'20).EDAP has 3 lines of revenue: a) ESWL, a mature market with good cashflow, b) distribution of equipment of other companies (pex of high performance US machines made by Exact Imaging, which it tries to bundle with its own HIFU technology) and c) Focal One, a HIFU (high frequency ultrasound) treatment device, being used in the noninvasive treatment of localised prostate cancer (PC), and with early studies to treat rectal endometriosis. Over the years, EDAP's management team has done a very solid job: They have worked tirelessly to gain approval of Focal1, first in Europe, then in the US, then gaining Medicare coverage (class 1 CPT code). Now they are trying to gain coverage of commercial/private payers covering the majority of eligible patients, something which might take quite some time (years?). Ultimately, EDAP -somewhat optimistic- believes that 25% of new PC cases might be treated with HIFU and 75% thereof by EDAP (Focal1). This leads them to a hypothetical future revenue of about 600m USD (whereof roughly one third comes form new machines, servicing and consumables each). While these projections are optimistic, recent interim topline results of a large French study, comparing HIFU with radical prostatectomy (RP) were reassuring in that HIFU resulted in more 24m-recurrent-free survival (not needing salvage TTT or additional medical TTT) (p<0.001) and in significantly less urinary incontinence (p0.005) and MED. While the current coverage by medicare is at favourable terms (doctors earn about 1000 USD per HIFU as compared to ca 730 USD for cryotherapy or brachytherapy and 1300 USD for radical prostatectomy). EDAP does the right thing, trying to bundle Focal 1 with Exact Imaging's high-perfomance US equipment, giving the urologist access to both diagnosis and therapy. for 2021/2 they concentrate on gaining commercial coverage and to publish (or have published) high quality data regarding HIFU at large academical centres.Taken altogether, while the path to (ultimate commercial) success might be quite long, EDAP is a solid company with a thoughtful management team, good products, and a solid business plan. If they continue to work tirelessly as they did so far, they should have a good chance of success. In that light the current SP (ca 6x sales) seems rather moderate, especially especially considering the frothy market as we witness.Dr John"

"The reward of conviction: More often than not it pays to stick to your conviction and to cut out the negative noise (which can come in very convincing disguise). There was a ton of negativity about HGSI (Human Genome Sciences) before GSK bought the company (to be fair: in hindsight GSK might have paid too much). There was a ton of negativity with INCY, when the stock was trading between 13 and 18 USD/share. ""Jakafi will never sell"".... ""pipeline too risky""...aso. Now INCY is at 120. There is a good deal of negativity about RDUS (Radius, now ca 43 USD/sh), especially about how abaloparatide sc will sell in relation to AMGN's drug which has to given less often but is also less efficacy when it comes to the important non-vetebral osteoporotic fractures. Moreover, RDUS has a transdermal version in the pipeline which IMO has a good shot at success. I think RDUS will be a success story. There has also been a ton of negativity about TGTX (currently at ca 5.8USD: see my previous post) and two very influential investors (BB and RA Capital) seem to have become more negative as well. Still, I think that TGTX's story remains intact (PI3Kdelta-inhib with only minimal GI and hepatic side effects and a glycosylated (chimeric) mab against CD20, as well as a combination of the two). However, I have also been skeptical when it comes to CEO Weiss' push into the crowded MS-market. I hope, he's right and I am wrong. The jury is still out on RDUS and TGTX. Finally there was ample and well publicized negativity about my long term holding Accelerate diagnostics (AXDX, currently 24.75 USD, see previous posts). The (in-)famous short seller outfit Citron (they were the first to short Valeant) still has a 1 USD target on AXDX's stock. I preferred to believe in the story, which AXDX's management/BOD has been telling and watching the slow but steady success the company makes. AXDX's top management/BOD are guys with a proven track record (Ventana Medical Systems, Stericycle...). Finally, AXDX made it and received FDA Marketing Authorization for the Pheno System. Let's see how the stock reacts, there are plenty of shorts out there... regardsDr John"

"Don't we have a nice downward motion? Stocks such as Fibrogen (FGEN, 55.5 USD, EV ca 4B) or Neurocrine (NBIX, ca 83 USD, EV 7.2B) saw their SP climb day after day... a bit of a breather is just ok. MDXG, having spiked from 12 to 18 due to short covering is also taking a rest, which is ok with me.I would never have thought that TSRO (MC 3.2B/EV 2.9B (!!)) touches 59 again (otherwise I would not have restarted my position in triple digits :-)). What changed since TSRO was trading near 200? Not much actually, but for a change in ""perception"". However, TSRO still has the Nr 1 PARP inhibitor, a drug class which is just starting to gain traction and has plenty of label extension potential (breast, Ca, NSCLC). TSRO has 2 approved products, a decent IO pipeline and half a billion USD cash. With an EV of 2.9B is is valued about the same as LOXO (LOXO) or Blueprint (BPMC). LOXO and BPMC are both excellent companies with highly targeted products aiming at small subsets of cancers, which, however, will never have the market potential of TSRO's PARP inhibitor. Remember that Ariad was taken out at 5+ B USD. Remember that SAGE (just for the sake of comparing oranges to apples) has an EV which is more than double TSRO's EV. ... For me a reason to throw more good money after bad, water my ""weeds"" while being quite comfortable that in fact I am watering roses (or at least tulips).I have a hunch that TGTXis being re-evaluated (on the upside) by the Street. Considering that it has a promising (although Jonny come late) pipeline an EV of <700 m USD is cheap.I also think that Chemocentryx (CCXI) is being re-evaluated. People seem to recognize that the glass is more than half full. CCXI (9.5USD, EV of 350 USD) is making nice and steady progress on all fronts and is still very cheap. Patience.And, of course, Techne continues to sail steadily as always...Dr John"

TECH is up 5.17% to 196.03
"With the year 2017 almost over, a few random thoughts. Biotech continues to be maniac-depressive, and we had enough of both, even though more depression lately especially in the small and mid cap space, where many, if not most companies saw their valuation decimated without much reason, but ""shift in sentiment"". The medtech space had fewer ups and downs, apart from individual stories, such as Mimedx (MDXG, currently at ca 12.5 USD), which is firing on all cylinders, but suffering from a prolonged short attack.As to my personal portfolio, in 2017 good decisions outweighed bad ones, even though I did make enough of the latter, such as buying back into Tesaro (TSRO, ca 77USD, EV 3.85B). I still believe that PARP-inhibtor is a space where BigPharma would like to be. While I might have underestimated the competition by AZN, CLVS etc, I still think that TSRO's Zejula/niraparib is best in class, and that TSRO will be bought in 2018 at rather 6B than the current 4B, reason why i added at 78.5 and 77.5. I took the opportunity to add to stocks in my portfolio, which got decimated for no good reason, such as AUPH (AUPH, currently ca at 4.8 USD, EV 225m USD) , or Five Prime (FPRX, currently ca 21 USD, EV 265m USD; FPRX had a ""disappointing"" trial results of its lead drug). Both are way too cheap. As to my three ""high risk"" suggestions mentioned earlier in 2017 i.e Corvus (CRVS), Syros (SYRS) and Loxo (LOXO), all three played out in the short term gaining between 50 and 200%, but only Loxo plead out long term, since CRVS and SYRS had underwhelming trial results of their lead drugs. I sold all three, Loxo with a wonderful gain, the other two with a combined mild loss. I cut my position in my largest Biotech holding, Beigene (BGNE, currently 95.5, EV ca 4 Bill USD) by 50%, after it almost tripled, it still is in my top biotech holding, but only by a small margin now. I have good feelings about recently discussed Novanta, and added ca 2/3 to my position when it had a hiccup from 54 to 44 USD 8currently 52 USD, EV ca 1.9 B). NOVT continues to outperform and raise guidance, something which is rare. I am also glad about re-entering Foundation Medical at 48 not long ago (FMI, currently at 64 USD, EV 2.2B), which is in the right space.Two other recent additions I did not mention are in the orthopedic space: I bought Globus Medical at 36 (GMED, currently 39 USD, EV 3.4 B, P/EBITDA 16, net profit 17%, R/E 12.5%, good balance sheet). I bought GMED mainly because I think they have a probable hit coming with their recently approved Excelsius Robotic Guidance navigation system for orthopedic back surgery (a comparison: Mazor robotic (MAZR) has sales of 60mill and an EV of 1.6 Bill, GMED has sales of >600M and an EV of 3.4 B). In the biotech space I bought (back) into 2 rare disease plays: Biomarin at 87 (BMRN, at 90.5, EV 19B ) and Ultragenyx at 45.3 (RARE, currently at 46.5, EV 1.5B) BMRN had outstanding results for hemophilia A gene therapy and RARE has just become cheap again, considering its quality of pipeline, CEO, balance sheet. Yesterday I sold about 35% of my Medtronic position and bought into Zimmer Biomet at 120 USD (ZBH, currently at 121 USD, EV 33B, P/EBITDA a modest 11.9). The reason for my buy (I used to be a long term Biomet shareholder) is the appointment of the new CEO coming from Covidien-Medtronic, an excellent choice. While we are at it: the new CEO might want go expand ZBH's offering and go into robotic surgery (as did his competitors: Medtronic has a collaboration with Mazor, and remember Stryker buying MAKO?). Why not buying Globus Medical (GMED: see just above)?Taken altogether, I think for the long term investor, there is (at todays valuation)plenty of good stuff in the biotech sector out there. such as AUPH, FPRX, TSRO, probably RDUS, CCXI, jut to name a few.FWIWDr John"
"Dr John, as I'm sure you have witnessed, TSRO has been really beaten down as of late. The latest drop coming on the news of some side-effects on VARUBI(rolapitant). Are these side-effects enough for you to now change your stance on TSRO? Or do you think it is an overreaction? I think I'm going to start a small position in TSRO...."
"Hi Dr. John. As you have probably seen, MDXG getting beat up. Based on an accounting review of possible irregularities. Is this changing your position. Are you adding? Selling any? I'm torn. I think the shorts will continue to swarm all over this. But if there is nothing there, it could be a huge buying opportunity...."

"Hi Dr. John, some big ups and downs lately. I did see that AUPH issued more shares to raise 200 million dollars. Do you have any thoughts on that? I will admit that took me by surprise. Because I thought i remember them saying before this that they had enough cash to last over 2 years with no revenue? So it was a little confusing. But I guess you can look at it as a buying opportunity. With this big money raise it seems they want to go it alone; if they get approval."
"Hi Dr. John, I noticed that after-hours yesterday, AUPH announced they failed the dry-eye candidate they were developing. I only have a very tiny current position in AUPH. Would now be the time to add on weakness? Or would you just hold? Or do you think it is time to sell and move on?"
Bio-Techne is down 4.97% to 230.91
"Bye bye 2019, part2...While 2018 has been a annus horribilis for me, 2019 is it's counterpart, the annus mirabilis (heck, the huge loss inflicted last year by an abysmal MDXG performance has more than evened out in only 11 months).My long term NASH-holdings (and log term laggards!) Intercept (ICPT, currently back up to from 70 to 118 USD, MC 3.8B) and Madrigal (MDGL 118 USD, EV 1.3B,MC 1.8B) are finally getting back the respect they deserve, and more is to come. In the end they are amongst the few remaining NASH companies with unequivocally positive results in mid stage to late stage trials, while most of its contenders collapsed on the way... Then there is Myokardia, (MYOK, 66.5 USD , MC 3B, EV 2.6B, SP-performance YTD 44--> 66 USD). MYOK has shown thats its allosteric inhibitor of Myosin significantly improves several clinically important parameters in certain cardiomyopathies, a large and underserve market. Elegant science, no me too products. A mid-autumn selloff was completely unwarranted, the SP is on the upswing again, and I expect good long term appreciation (see previous posts). The same goes for Ascendis (ASND, 110 USD, MC 5.4 B), which is the man left standing when it comes to slow release growth hormone replacement, with a pilpeline to boost (see previous posts).Amongst the most exiting biotechs, however, is Turning Point (TPTX, 2 USD, MC 1.9B, EV 1.55B), one of my largest pure play biotech holdings (IPO in April 2019 at ca 25 USD). Great CEO and CSO (the women behind crizotinib and sunitinib), potential best in class ROS1/TRK/ALK and RET inhibitors. The market cap is till quite modest (LOXO was taken out for >7B). I added during the late-summer depression, and will continue to add during periods of weakness.My Rodney Dangerfield long is: OVID (OVID, SP ca 3.9 USD, MC 190 M, EV 150 m). The CEO is Jeremy Levin (ex BMY top executive, ex TEVA executive (not responsible for the actual mess)). Great CEO with significant ownership in the company. I have written on OVID on this mb before, have owned and sold small amounts of shares , but only recently took a significant position (average price ca 2.9 USD). While OVID has a OV101 in ph 3 for Angelmann syndrome (with decent chance of success), my attention was re-ignited by OV 935, a cholesterol hydorxylase inhibitor, showing amazing results in rare epilepsy syndromes. Although a small , early trial only, the fact that seizure control became better, the longer patients were on OV935 is really noteworthy, with seizure reductions up to 90 % in a very hard to treat population. I think OVID will be a big winner, but one has to be patient. Last, but not least, of course, my nemesis Mimedx came back from the dead (MDXG, current SP ca 7.4, EV 750m, P/S still only 2.7, YTD SP-performance: 2.7-->7.4). I took a brutal hit last year, sold almost all at low prices, bought back at averaged 4.4 USD and before I know, MDXG has again become my largest US holding (larger even than TECH)... let's hope the good days last.However, I think that we are in for a good correction, especially in biotech, therefore I have a good amount of cash on the sidelines.FWIWDr John"
"Drr John, you probably saw AXDX earnings release yesterday. And listened to the conference call. And as we suspected, the roll-out and getting a system installed and placed takes longer than many thought. I guess that's just the nature of the beast. But other than it being an agonizingly painfully slow process; did you have any thoughts about what you heard? I did like some of the solutions they brought up to decrease the time an evaluation takes. Such as letting hospitals use more than one machine during evaluation, to get it completed quicker."
"Talk about resilience and quality: While the biotech sector (at least the mid and small cap sector) and some of the more speculative medtech stocks have been in a bear market for some weeks, BioTechne is reaching new highs. Actually, it is fair to say that small and midcap biotechs are having one of their well known crashes, which come about with annoying (and nevertheless predictable) regularity. I recently started to add to some of my positions, such as Kinsika (KNSA, currently at ca 15.5), which I bought into at exactly the wrong moment (average buying price ca 22 USD), but think that the company is worth considerably more than 1B. I also bought back a large portion of my stakes - which I sold at considerable higher prices- in Kodiak (KOD, currently ca 115) at ca 106, Crisper (CRSP , currently 118 USD) at 102, Beam (BEAM, currently at 72.5) at 73, and Quanterix (QTRX currently 61 USD) at 64. Thinking of adding to Turning Point (TPTX) in the mid 60's, of Arrowhead (ARWR) in the 50's if ever they come down to that level, or add to Arcutis (ARQT, currently ca 27USD) in the low 20's. I also added to smaller positions, such as Akero (AKRO currently ca 27.5 USD), Oric (ORIC, ca 21.5 USD), and Avidity (RNA, ca 20.5 USD), and started a small Position in Prelude (PRLD currently at 32.5) at current prices. I did not, however, add to those small positions in highflying medtech stocks (all in solidly in the red), such as Berkley Lights (BLI) Twist (TWST) or Seer (SEER), which are still expensive, nor did I add to Schrödinger (SDGR), where I was lucky enough to sell most of my position before the fall.FWIWDr JohnBTW: Avidity (RNA) and Oric (ORIC) are both early stage (preclinical --> clinical), but very promising companies, with excellent scientists at the helm and top execs with a proven track record."
"Doc,What are your thoughts on how the new dictatorship will affect us little retail investors? Thanks as always for posting your investing thoughts....love your posts as always."
"Dr John, you are always giving us some ideas. I may have one for you. Check out VECL. They are up 30% today on one of the better Quarter's I've seen any company report. They seem to have very nice growth. And the cash balance increased. Margins are good. I would love to hear what you think? As an aside, they may eventually compete with MDXG in some areas...."

"This and that....I don't know if Yahoo will be accepting&keeping this message, since my last attempts to answer LMP's Q were unsuccessful (message deleted for whatever reason).-Even though I try to have a large cash position, I could not help but double down my position in Tesaro (TSRO, ca 135 USD) again.

"So far, -at least for my portfolio- 2018 has been a tale of two cities: the BIG losers and the BIG winners.The loosers: Looser Nr 1. MDXG (currently at ca 7.2 USD, MC 800m, EV 720 m P/S 2.6). 2018 performance 13--> 7.2. I'll not dwell on the very public reasons for this dismal performance, suffice it to say that I took the ""dip"" (euphemism) as an opportunity to very significantly increase my position. My thinking, as laid out in previous posts: The main business is sound, no major SNAFU, but likely some relatively minor bad behaviour by some mid to lower level execs, which might have been tolerated by some upper level execs. I guess a fine, but nothing which should significantly impair the future of the company (If am wrong, it will hurt. A LOT). I expect that medium term, the SP will resume its course to the North Pole, surpassing previous highs.Looser Nr 2. Tesaro (TSRO, currently at 59, MC 3.2B, EV 3.1 B, 640m cash, but also 430m debt (which I don't like). 2018 performance: 75--> 59 (TSRO's worst performance was in 2017). I don't think that TSRO should be valued the same as LOXO or BPMC (both excellent companies, but serving niche markets). I don't think that TSRO should be valued at 2/3 of Sarepta (SRPT), half of SAGE, and a fifth of Nektar (NKTR, BTW: I completely missed out on NKTR). While niraparib's peak potential might have come down, I still think, TSRO deserves a SP >100. Looser Nr 3. Five Prime Therapeutics (FPRX) (concerning FPRX --> read a more recent post on this MB). FPRX, 16.1 USD, MC 560m, EV 160m (!!), cash 300m (!!), no debt. 2018 performance 22.5--> 16 (as with TSRO 2017 was even worse). Excellent science, R&D based, board pipeline (early stage), waaaay undervalued IMO.The Winners:Winner Nr 1: TG Therapeutics (TGTX, currently 16 USD, MC 1.15B, EV 980m, 85m cash (might soon need a secondary). 2018 performance 4.8--> 16. In one sentence: TGTX is slowly getting the respect it deserves. Still much, much room to grow. Winner Nr 2: Beigene (BGNE, SP ca 170 USD; MC ca 9B, 830m cash). 2018 performance 100-->170. When I first mentioned BGNE on this MB (soon after the IPO) it was trading at ca 30, which makes it a > 5 bagger. Its recent steady rise is almost irreal. So far I sold 3 times some shares: at 85, at 130, at 150. Still a large position, but of course I wish that I'd never sold one single share...; The Celgene deal was great, its pipeline as well. Has the stock become too expensive? Hmm, not sure...Winner Nr 3: ChemoCentryx (CCXI, ca 14USD, MC 690m, EV 570m, cash 125m, no debt). 2018 performance 6 --> 14. Good, old CCXI, well done! As with TGTX, CCXI is finally getting a bit closer to the valuation it deserves, considering the pipeline. Still plenty of room to grow. Again, a company with good basic science, an excellent and modest CEO with significant stock ownership, and a diversified pipeline with early and late stage compounds, mostly for rare disease niche markets.Joker:As Joker I'll mention again Aurinia (AUPH, ca 5.4 USD, MC 450m, EV 305m, cash 170m), 2018 performance 4.8--> 5.4. While being a ""one trick pony"", AUPH has shown extremely encouraging ph2-lupus nephritis (LN) data for voclosporine. Remember that LN is a notoriously difficult-to-treat condition. I think the current ph3 will repeat the ph2 success. The CEO, a low key science guy, knows his turf: He was the person behind Aspreva, leading the development of blockbuster drug Cell Cept. I think in not too distant future AUPH MC will be well over 1B USD.FWIW and regardsDr John"

"Dr John, could you provide any opinions about CIFORADENANT trial or ESMO data released by CRVS? Thx."
"This and that, pt 2:An off topic post, therefore you might skip...For those interested, I briefly mention two promising biotech companies: Denali (DNLI) and Avidity (RNA). Common to both companies is their focus on how to deliver their ""payload"" (=drug) to the target organ. Denali (DNLI, SP ca 56 USD, MC, ca 6.8B, cash 1.4 B(!), debt ca 75m) is dedicated to the central nervous system (CNS) and has to overcome the blood brain barrier (BBB), while Avidity (RNA, SP ca 21.5 USD, MC 815m, cash 300m, no debt) strives to deliver RNA-therapeutics (oligos, or siRNA) to tissues other than the liver, especially to the muscle, which still is a problem. Both companies chose the broadly expressed Transferrin Receptor (TfR) as suitable transport vehicle to bring their respective ""payloads"" to the target organ (brain, or muscle). Both companies have a top notch scientific team (much of DNLI's crew came from Genentech, while Avidity has Art Levin at the helm, an authority in oligo-research). DNLI's transport vehicle is an Fc-antibody fragment binding to the TfR, and can be transported via the TfR across the BBB, either as a full fledged mab or as a mab-fragment loaded with an enzyme, oligo or protein. In a ph 1/2 study of patients with Hunter's syndrome, DNLI showed target engagement and pathway engagement, and therefore proof of concept that the technology works (reason why their MC is high, ie >6B USD). Of course, DNLI does not only address orphan diseases, but has the eye on large indications, such as Alzheimers, Parkinson, and FTD. Their approach focuses on engineered brain delivery, genetic pathways and biomarker driven development. DNLI has important collaborations, p.ex with BIIB. IMO, DNLI is the most promising biotech focused on the CNS.Avidity (RNA) has during years of development engineered their own AOC (antibody oligo conjugate), a field where many companies have tried to succeed and failed before. As with DNLI's approach, their antibody (with inactive Fc portion) is also able to dock onto the TfR. A siRNa or an oligo is connected to the ab via a proprietary linker. In preclinical nonhuman primate models, they showed target and pathway engagement with very promising results, being able to reduce expression of the culprit DMPK gene (which is responsible for Myotonic dystrophy (DM1)) and therefore dramatically reduce the amount of the toxic mRNA. In DMD (Duchenne muscle dystrophy) models their approach resulted in a much higher degree of exon skipping than seen up to date with competing compounds. Avidity is starting their ph1 study in patients with DM1 in the 2nd H 2021, and intend to submit an IND for their 2nd AOC candidate in FSHD (facio-scapulo-humeral muscle dystrophy) in 2022, followed by their exon skipping AOC candidates for DMD, also in 2022. I strongly suggest to view the ca 40 min webcast of Avidity's R&D day of May 19, 2021, which can be found on their homepage. I also suggest to view some webcasts on the DNLI website, pex the most recent fireside chat.Both companies are still ""early stage"". However, both have shown enough convincing results to foresee an excellent chance of success in clinical trials. I have owned a small portion in DNLI for many years, and have increased my position to a quite large one more recently. I have bought shares in RNA about a year ago and significantly increased my position yesterday, so that it has become a quite large one. It goes without saying that both stocks are long term plays. If the current biotech bear market continues or intensifies, their SP will probably crater more than the SP of companies with a more advanced pipeline.Dr John"

"Hi Dr. John, an early Happy New Year to you. Hopefully 2020 will be kind to us all. So you already gave us a 2019 wrapup below. With some of your current holdings going into the New Year. I was wondering if you can take a quick second to further put your best ideas into 'buckets'. What i mean by that is can you list your holdings that you think have the best short-term chance of success, intermediate chance of success and more long-term chance of success? If we get a correction in 2020, I want to be sure I'm positioned best for the short-term, intermediate term and long-term. Thanks again Dr. John!!!"
"Good bye 2018, hello 2019...For most of us, 2018 has been an ""annus horribilis"", for me even more so (due to individual judgment errors with performance shattering consequences (pex: MDXG), broad based declines in the biotech sector (pex FPRX) and in the cyclical sector (pex: HUN), which could not have been overcome by the stellar performance of individual stocks (FMI, NOVT, GHDX, BGNE (sold at 150-180), NBIX (sold at 108, reentered at 79) SGEN, CELG (re-entry short before buyout).I continue to be happy with big long term holdings, such as Bio-Techne (TECH 163 USD) or Becton Dickinson (BDX 242 USD).Taking advantage of the low prices end 2018, I have started (or added to) positions in Danaher (DHR, 105 USD, my buying price ca 96), Mettler Toledo (605 USD, my buying price ca 560), or -again- Gilead (GILD 69 USD, my price 69, after nomination of O'Day as CEO). I also bought (again) a moderate amount of Sage (SAGE 139 USD, my average price 102), Sarepta (SRPT 120 USD, ca my entry price) Madrigal (MDGL ca 117 USD, slightly above my entry price) and NBIX.Outside of healthcare/life science I initiated (or added to) some of my larger positions (many of them still in the red): Global Payment (GPN, at 114, my average price 120), Huntsman (HUN, ca 22 USD, m average price 24.5), International Game Technology (IGT, currently at 15, my average price 21(!): I don't quite understand the extent to which IGT has been decimated. It is a solid cash generator, can service its debt, trades at 7.2x EBITDA and is currently yielding 5.2%.Whats new on the horizon for 2019?Above from all the companies mentioned above, I'd like to mention 2 more companies in the molecular diagnostics/molecular research business: Nanostring (NSTG, ca 20 USD, MC 625m, cash 95m, debt 50 m, revenue 110m, EPS still negative) and Quanterix, which I mentioned here before at 16.5 USD (QTRX, ca 20 USD, MC 460 mill, revenue 2018 ca 33mill, cash 50 mill, debt 7mill, EPS still negative). both companies have intriguing products on the market with best-in-class features and a significant untapped market in front of them. --> more details on NSTG and QTRX to be followed in next postsFWIW Dr John"

"This is what I wrote in May 2016 on the old message board : ...""Which are the best risk/reward situations in biotech now? Like many others, I think that one should focus on mid caps with either a mature pipeline (one/several drugs (with possible blockbuster potential) which have just been approved, or have great odds of a near term approval). Or on companies with a solid line of approved products, such as SGEN, (or MDVN). Therefore, I have large/rather large positions in Radius (RDUS: osteoporosis; good competitive position), Seatlle Genetics (SGEN: Adcetris, leading ADC-platform, relatively cheap; my average buying price 34), Neurocrine (NBIX: uterine fibroids, endometriosis, tardive dyskinesia. A long term holding; average buying price ca 20USD), and -yes again!- Incyte (INCY: MPS, immnunooncology;average buying price ca 79 USD). New medium size position are Alder (ALDR: Migraine prevention, good competitive position; average purchase price ca 26USD), Acadia (ACAD: recently approved pimavanserin/nuplazid for Parkinson psychosis; average buying price ca 29USD). Today I bought a smallish position Intercept (ICPT: PBC, NASH) at ca 141 USD. Of course I continue to hold onto my large position in TGTX (currently at a lousy 7.8) and Fibrogen (FGEN: oral anemia market, fibrotic pipeline, currently selling at a meager 18.5 USD). I still own but downsized my positions in SAGE (SAGE: epilepsy) and Celldex (CLDX). Not really fitting my focus list, but very promising are my long term holdings CCXI, XLRN, PRTA and MGNX. CCXI's (ca 4.5 USD) performance has been more than abysmal, but it more than doubled after having struck a deal worth some 600mill USD (current market cap 200 mill!) for its oral CCR5a antagonist. Prothena (PRTA, currently at 45 USD: PD, Amyloidosis) is the brainchild of D.Schenk, one of the top scientist in neurodegeneration (average buying price 34). Acceleron (XLRN, ca 34 USD: anemia, cancer) is run by seasoned ex Genetics Institute execs....""What has changed since? Not much. I still think that the mid cap advanced stage companies are the place to be. Since May many good things happened: my large positions such as RDUS (now 55), SGEN (now 53), MDVN (sold at 80.5), NBIX (now 54) went up considerably. TGTX (now 7.1) is still lagging and, IMO, dramatically undervalued. Medium size positions such as ALDR (bought at 27 now 33), MGNX (bought at 20,now 31) also had a decent run. CCXI (ca 4.3) had another setback (expected) with so-so results in pancreatic Ca and Acceleron (XLRN, ca 34) is not moving much. Tokai (90% loss, sold out at 1.3 was a very small position but a super bummer). Luckily I did not own NVAX.On the other hand I did again add some 20% to MDXG in the low 7's just in time before the recent run up and i am particularly pleased with Accelerate diagnostics (AXDX) progress (and with its share price performance which doubled since i last added to my position).What's new?I took (again) a position in orphan disease company Ultragenyx (RARE) at ca 67 USD, took a new position in Versatis (VSAR) at ca 12.2USD (long acting growth hormone, good chances at positive ph3 results, good niche, not too much competition, good buyout candidate, good balance sheet), again in Gilead (GILD) at ca 80 USD, and added to SAGE (SAGE) at current prices. I took a quite large stage in Inovalon (INOV) at ca 18 (now 16) and moderate stakes in Foundation Medicine (FMI) at ca 18 (now ca 22) and Myriad low cost-competitor Invitae (NVTA) at 9 (now 8). I sold Prothena (PRTA at 54 (now 55)). I sold most of my Range Resources (RRC between 38 and 43) and WPX (between 11-12) and Atwood (ATW at 11), but recently bought back into ATW (at 8 now 6.7: will add more soon, if the share price drops more) and started a position in Apache oil (APA) (after the news of the large new reservoir at 55 (now 57)...regardsDr John"

"Buongiorno! da alcuni giorni sto sottoponendo questo documento ufficiale relativo a cura SARS s dichiarazioni ufficiali di scienziati già nel 2005… Mi chiedo perché nessuno lo prenda in considerazione…Cloridrato di cinanserina: gli scienziati già nel 2005 dichiarano essere efficace contro SARS covi…Diffondete queste informazioni anche via radio e tv Il gruppo di scienziati provenienti da Cina, Danimarca, Germania e Polonia ha analizzato 15 farmaci che risultavano efficaci nella prevenzione della SARS, ma dopo attenti studi patologici la cinanserina è stata scelta come unico medicinale pronto all'uso contro il virus. Progetto del 6PQ trova la cura per la SARSPOLITICHE E DIRETTIVEUn gruppo di scienziati europei e cinesi ha scoperto che un farmaco attualmente utilizzato nel trattamento della schizofrenia inibisce in modo efficace il coronavirus della sindrome respiratoria acuta grave (SARS). La cinanserina è stata utilizzata nelle terapie delle malattie mentali sin dagli anni '70. Adesso, scienziati del progetto SEPSDA (Sino-European Project on SARS Diagnostic and Antivirals), finanziato a titolo del Sesto programma quadro (6PQ), l'hanno qualificata come farmaco pronto all'uso per curare la SARS. ""La cinanserina potrebbe essere prescritta direttamente per prevenire la SARS o trattare i pazienti affetti da tale sindrome nel caso in cui l'epidemia dovesse ripresentarsi"", ha dichiarato Peter Kristensen dell'Università danese di Aarhus. Il gruppo di scienziati provenienti da Cina, Danimarca, Germania e Polonia ha analizzato 15 farmaci che risultavano efficaci nella prevenzione della SARS, ma dopo attenti studi patologici la cinanserina è stata scelta come unico medicinale pronto all'uso contro il virus. Gli altri 14 farmaci dovranno superare lunghi test sugli animali prima di potere essere impiegati sugli uomini, ha affermato il dottor Kristensen. L'attività antivirale della cinanserina è stata valutata in campioni di tessuto contenenti il virus della SARS e ha rivelato una forte inibizione nella replicazione del coronavirus a concentrazioni farmacologiche atossiche. ""Questi risultati dimostrano che il vecchio farmaco cinanserina è un inibitore della replicazione del coronavirus della SARS e agisce molto probabilmente inibendo la proteinase 3CL"", ha dichiarato il dottor Kristensen. Nel periodo compreso tra febbraio e giugno 2003 la SARS, una polmonite atipica altamente contagiosa, ha colpito 32 paesi. Sono state infettate circa 8.400 persone e più di 800 sono decedute a causa della malattia. Sebbene la SARS sia attualmente sotto controllo, gli scienziati ritengono che possa riemergere. Secondo gli scienziati del progetto SEPSDA, la rapida trasmissione attraverso gli aerosol e l'elevato tasso di mortalità (fino al 15 per cento) fanno della SARS una potenziale minaccia globale. Nei prossimi due anni il progetto SEPSDA studierà altri 50 composti chimici per il trattamento della SARS.Paesi Cina, Germania, Danimarca, Poloniahttps://cordis.europa.eu/article/id/24006-fp6-project-finds-cure-for-sars/ithttps://www.fishersci.com/shop/products/cinanserin-hydrochloride-tocris-2/046010https://www.tocris.com/news/introducing-bio-techne#main-content"

"DrrJohn, could you give some opinions about relationship between CPI-006 (anti-CD73) and macrophage. I know that many companies, like FTSV, TRIL etc. target CD47-macrophage. Thx."
dr john is a moron ignore his stupid rants and ramblings
"Explain this to me. We drop $9.27 today because some hedge funds sell, but then we are up $10 a share in after hours trading. What is this about, or is it the new normal for TECH."
TECH is down 5.34% to 188.83
Hey DrrJohn - you ever look outside of the US? Do you think there's a future for Acrux Limited?I don't hold but not much has to happen right for this to go up sharply I'd imagine.Cheers.
TECH is down 5.91% to 169.91
"What's up? Well, for one, Bio-Techne had another stellar quarter. Quite impressive how this team delivers! Could not think of a better longe term holding (for me it is indeed: bought my first shares in the last century).Then, Quanterix (QTRX, ca 35 USD, MC 1.1B) and Nanostring (NSTG, 38 USD, MC ca 1.4B) are delivering as well, despite Covid19. Still plenty of room ahead for both, especially for QTRX.For a change, my large ""pure"" biotech positions are all doing well. Chemocentryx (CCXI, 54.5 USD) came back some 20%, which is deserved, because the stock got ahead of itself at 65 (Isold 20% and bought more AUPH instead). Aurinia (AUPH, 14.5 USD) is too cheap at a MC of 1.8B. The same goes for TG Therapeutics (TGTX 22.5 USD, MC 2.85B), even though the stock is doing ok this year. Ovid (OVID) did well since I first mentioned it 8 months ago (then at 3.9USD, now at 7.9, MC 450m). I continue to hold my shares, since I am in mainly because of the epilepsy program. But it is a risky position: Angelmann trial results should be out relatively soon. If they disappoint, the stock will take a heavy beating (if the are positive: the contrary)The biggest disconnect between share price and pipeline value is in Corvus Pharmaceutical (CRVS, ca 4USD, MC ca 110m): I do not understand, how the financial community does not appreciate the potential of CPI-006 in Covid-19. Is it because Corvus is seen as a Oncology company? Is it just flying below the radar? As I said before, I usually shy away from ""Covid stocks"". Sure, we have only very scant results for CPI-006 in Covid19. However these results are both remarkable and outstanding. Index patient: Advanced NSCLC, tested positive for acute Covid infection, mortality risk with Covid expected to be 40%: Receiving CPI-006 (oncology study), produces anti SARS-Cov-2 titres of >1:50'000 (including domain binding region (DBR), clears virus in 1 week, remains asymptomatic. This patient could be an outlier, for sure. However, the first patients in the recently started phase 1 study (CPI-006 in Covid 19 infected patients with PCR results positive <7d), showed exactly the same pattern: production of massive anti-virus titres, including against the RBD within 7 days, increasing even more at 14 days. BTW, these patients were receiving the lowest dose of CPI-006, which was >50times lower than the dose given to the NSCLC patient. Titres of the magnitude of 1:100'000 are bound to contain significant amount of neutralising abs, and I just cannot imagine how these titres should not have a significant influence of the speed of virus clearing, and consequently a positive impact on outcome. If this were not the accepted thinking, why would Regeneron & Co develop monoclonal abs against the RBD of the spike protein? What Corvus is doing, is giving a one shot immune booster (activating CD73), which, in turn, activates B-cells, ""transforms"" them into memory B Cells and Plasma-cells (which are secreting abs against SARS-Cov2). CPI-006 could not only be used in early stage (or even late stage) Covid 19, but would also make tremendous sense also as adjuvans to vaccinations, or used in the preventive setting with populations at risk. I have been sorely wrong before, p.ex. when I bet a large sum on Mimedx (MDXG), just to see it fall from 15 to 1. (Well I had bought my first shares at 1, and bought again when the new management team came in at average 4. Now we are again >6, but still a long way to go). However, with Corvus I take again a large but calculated risk, making it in my 4th largest ""pure play biotech position"" (average price at about 4.1 USD)(The 5 largest positions are: TGTX>AUPH>TPTX>CRVS>CCXI). If, as I expect, most patients in the phase 1 study will show large increases in anti-SARS-CoV2 titres (results will be due in November), then the market cap will not be 100mill but 1B. And that's only for starters...We'll see....Dr John"
"Markets hit new highs, not so Pharma and Biotech (and not my portfolio for that matter). Medtech is faring better. My large long term holdings such as Techne (TECH, at 132 USD) Becton Dickinson (BDX, currently at 226), Medtronic (MDT, currently at 82.5) are near new highs. Techne had a very nice Q, so did BDX and MDT. I like BDX's acquisition of CR Bard and MDT is doing well with their own acquisition of Covidien. My largest holding, Mimedix (MDXG, at 10.85) is in a downward spiral of a very public short seller attack. I don't know why, but for some reason I often choose companies which have to climb a BIG BIG wall of worry (HGSI and MAKO at the time being; INCY, when it was at 20-30... ). I seem to be particularly fond of companies which are exposed vicious short seller attacks: About 2 Years ago it was Accelerate Diagnostics (AXDX, ca 26 USD), now it is MDXG. In both instances A.Left from Citron Research suggested a fair share price of something between 0 and 1 USD... Oh yeah, and the top execs are scrooges and the technology does not work etc... Well, since then AXDX has its Pheno-System approved, and the sales process is slowly getting traction. MDXG, however, is currently under siege, despite the fact that they post one stellar Q after the other. A.Left, Mr. Cohedes and other short sellers play their game. Not always easy to keep a cool head&mind, I must admit. But in the end: the style (of the attacker and the defendant) gives a lot of information about who is lying and who is not. Long story short: With both (AXDX MDXG) I believe in the top management and in their integrity/business acumen. Short attacks, in the end, give a good opportunity to increase one's position. I roughly doubled my position in MDXG since the attacks have started (added another 5% today). Biotechs had a lousy 6 weeks, or so. I recently added some 20-30% to Tesaro (TSRO, ca 85 USD) at ca 85 and to Aurinia (AUPH, ca 5.1 USD) at ca 5.2. and TG Therapeutics (TGTX ca 7.4 USD) at ca 7.6 USD. TSRO now has an EV of just a bit over 4 Bill USD, which is not pricey, considering that it has the best in class PARP inhibitor and its own immuno-oncology pipeline. I sold >1/2 of my TGTX at 11-15 and bought back now, when shares are cheap. 450m USD for a two de-risked ph2-3 compounds targeting large (though crowded) markets? I take it.Another nice company I bought into earlier this year is Novanta (NOVT, ca 54 USD/share) I started to buy at 37 and added ++ after the outstanding last Q (at 49). Some numbers: EV 1.9B, profit margin 13.5%, R/E 20%, Price /EBITDA 23 ). It produces photonics components (especially laser sources/components) used in Medical robotics/minimally invasive surgery and high end Tech equipment. NOVT also has a precision motion segment and vision segment, again with various high end applications for the Medtech industry. During the last 3-4 Q's NOVT each time surpassed their own guidance and repeatedly increased revenue and sales guidance significantly. The stock chart is a beauty. The stock is not cheap (forward PE of 31) , but in view of its growth track record and future growth potential not expensive either. A bonus: NOVT is under followed by analysts. I also ""bought back"" into Foundation Medicine (FMI, 51.5 USD), which I wrote about (and owned) in the past. As you might remember, FMI provides molecular information/tests in oncology and Roche bought 50% of the company at ca 50USD a couple of years ago. I bought again at 19, sold at 40 and bought recently again at 47.Gene therapy is the ""new"" hot spent, now that it transpires that Gene technology actually does work (see BLUE, ONCE, AVXS). A name which does not yet figure on every buyer's list is Abeona Therapeutics (ABEO, ca 16 USD, EV 630mill USD, cash >100mill USD). It has a promising AAV platform & pipeline, aiming at rare neuro-metabolic diseases and, IMO most interesting, has outstanding clinical success with gene therapy of a rare pediatric blistering skin disorder. Some kids could recover >80% of their chronic, debilitating hereditary skin disease (infantile epidermiolysis bullosa (EB)). One thing we know already: ABEO's gene therapy works in EB.On a side note: For once my perennial ""cyclical"" favorite, International Game Technology (IGT, ca 28.5 USD) is treating me well. Not long ago the stock could be bought at 18 USD (plus a 3% dividend as an extra).FWIWDr John"
"Dr John! We may need to reevaluate. Did you see the news today on Berkshire, JP Morgan and Amazon forming a nonprofit that will compete to lower employee healthcare costs? We need to reassess which stocks we can still own and which we can't. A company like AXDX may be okay. Because it sounds like this new 'group' is going to stress technology advancements that save costs. However, how this may affect a RDUS or a TSRO? I'm not sure. After you get a chance to digest, I would love to hear your thoughts! I can't stress enough how big this is! Insurer stocks are getting hammered premarket. Same with CVS, Walgreens, AmerisourceBergen, etc......"
"This and that....BioTechne (TECH) had another outstanding Q, ""firing on all cylinders"". All business segments had a steeper growth curve than I expected: The Diagnostics and Geonomics segment, pex, grew 17% organically, and ACD (tissue pathology franchise) seems to be particularly promising. Exosome diagnostics is suffering a somehwat from the Covid fallout and will need some time to show its full potential. The leader, however, was the Protein Sciences segment, growing overall 24% organically. Within this segment, the Proteomic and Analytical Tools subsegment was especially noteworthy. Talking about Simple Plex and Simple Western, Chuck Kummeth made some interesting comments: The industry is opening up, he said, there is a urgent need for highly sensitive multiplexing immunoassay systems, and there are only two companies out there providing sufficiently sensitive technologies: Quanterix (QTRX) and BioTechne, and both beat estimates for the Q. On he went, saying (as in previous CC's) that BioTechne's offering was 10 times smaller and 10 times cheaper, and that TECH was ""catching up"" to QTRX"", but that there was room for both (He did, however, omit the fact, that QTRX's Simoa technology is more sensitive). Speaking of industry trends he said: ""It really comes down to biomarker discovery"" ...""it's just...it's going to get big"". Could not agree more. Taker an example and fast forward to June/July when the FDA will decide on Biogen's (BIIB) aducanumab for Alzheimer's disease (AD). I think the drug should not be approved, but probably will be approved. My ""secret"" way to play the approval is not by holding BIIB or ACIU (which would profit from an approval as well), but by holding (and adding during the recent weakness) a large position in QTRX. QTRX has the leading technology to screen for AD-related biomarkers in the blood and it is to be expected that those measurements will become mandatory not only for patient screening (which AD patient could benefit from the therapy?) but also for the follow up of patients taking amyloid-targeting drugs. Of course, this is by no means the only reason why I hold QTRX, but it's a nice ""add on"".As medntioned previously, we are witnessing a severe Biotech correction (in the small and mid cap segment at least), and several companies have become attractive again at current valuations. I added to several positions (many of which I had reduced earlier in the year), such as Crisper (CRSP, currently 106 USD), Kodiak (KOD, currently 84 USD), TGTX (currently at 34 USD), Arcutis (ARQT, currently 25.5 USD), or Kinskia (KNSA, ca 14 USD). Not only Biotech, but also companies in the genomic life science segment are cratering. I reduced positions in Nanostring (NSTG) and Natera (NTRA), bought more QTRX, bought (again and a bit too early, adding during the downturn) Invitae (NVTA, ca 27.5USD), and consider buying Exact Sciences (EXAS, ca 97 USD) which has become more interesting from a valuation point of view and which recently did a string of excellent acquisitions.Then there were some company specific disappointments: a) Chemocentryx (CCXI, ca 10.5 USD) lost about 70% of its value, witnessing a reversal of sentiment concerning the ""approvability"" of avacopan. Luckily I sold my shares i nteh 4Q20 and 1Q 21 (because of valuation concerns), but bought back a small position at 24 (a cool 50% looser in a coupe of days). b) Then Aurinia (AUPH, ca 11 USD) posted disappointing sales numbers for Lupkynis for lupus nephritis, and investors wonder (probably too early) if this tiny company is up to the task to get traction. I sold a large part of my residual holding , which might be a mistake.Otherwise, I continue to be happy with my long term O&G plays, thinking that certain small caps in the O&G service sector are still undervalued (pex RPC (RES at 5.8 USD), or Oil States international (OIS at 6.6), but also larger companies such as Core Labs (CLB at ca 34USD) or Schlumberger (SLB at ca 32.5 USD).After a rare breather last Friday, it is possible that the bear market in biotech continues, therefore let's keep some powder dry...Dr John"
"Dr John, TGTX is really doing well. I'm loving the gains I'm seeing in my account, on that!!!! It is turning out to be one of my best investments in many years. Thanks to you!!!!!"
strong moves..growing their business..
Bio-Techne reached an all time high at 403.89

Bio-Techne is up 5.26% to 357.95
"This and That....2018 has been rather eventful so far, and the value of some important biotech companies has been reevaluated. My two cents on three companies:1)What about Celgene (not long ago >140, now around 80)? CELG has an EV of ca 70mill USD and some metrics look cheap (P/E <9) or okay (P/EBIT 12). I have always been impressed by CELG's managers, especially because of their willingness to make lots of interesting deals with promising start ups/small cap biotech's. While these deals are still there, the big picture has changed: Mongersen is gone for IBD, Ozanimod is being pushed back for RRMS and will almost certainly not fulfill the high hopes CELG has in this drug: the competitive landscape is changing rapidl, Roches' ocrelizumab is strong, Novartis' fingolimod is still a trusted leader and in near future will come off patent, i.e. generics looming. CELG's buy-in of Impact Medical (Jak inhibitor feratinib) does not inspire me and while the Juno-acquisition might be okay in the long run, it will take time to become an important contribution (The same goes for Kite/GILD. I don't own any GILD anymore for >6m)2) Incyte: a year ago, or so, INCY was trading >140, now at 85. A buy? I am not sure (meaning: not for me, at the moment). While Ruxolitinib is the ""JAK-inhibitor to go"", and might have some additional indications (cGVH) , other companies -while not being an acute danger- are slowly catching up. But what's around, apart from Jakafi? Epocadostat is ""dead"", baricitinib will enter an already very crowded field with profits being shared with LLY. The FGFR1/2/3 inhibitor in ph2 might be interesting (PFE just released a promising abstract with its own FGFR inh). Of course there is a rather broad early stage pipeline, which is worth something, but.... As for INCY's PI3Kdelta inhibitor: well I prefer TGTX's own inhibitor (TGTX has a EV of 800mil). Taken altogether: an EV of 13 B USD looks still expensive to me for ""Jakafi- plus unknowns""3) Alexion (was at 205 in mid 2015, now at 120): ALXN has an EV of 29B USD, essentially for one franchise: Terminal complement inhibition by eculizumab (soliris). Soliris is a great franchise, accounting for >95% of revenue, but will go off patent in 2027 at latest. The recent positive study results with ALXN's next generation (sc) ALXN-1202 has significantly solidified ALNN's position in PHN ans aHUS, a big positive. Still, we deal basically with a one product company targeting 2 indications, and this at a price of almost 30 B USD. A lot of money, IMO. I think the expectation for additional indications (therapy refractory Ach-R-positive MG and NMOSD) are too high. What's more, Ablynx-spinoff Argenyx (ARGX) has a very interesting compound for those same additional indications: Efgartigimod (ARGX113), which basically is an engineered IgG having a higher affinity to the neonatal Fc receptor (which ""prevents"" that IG is degraded rapidly), than pathogenic IgG in autoimmune diseases, thus leaving those pathogenic IgG ""out in the cold"" for degradation. Nice concept and it works. Another interesting company in the complement space is a second Europe-based company named Apellis (APLS, ca 23.5 USD, EV ca 1.3 B). APL-2 is blocking the complement cascade more upstream, i.e. at the C3 level, and is testing APL-2 for geographic atrophy (GA / a form of macular degeneration) as well as for eculizumab resistant-PNH (and as add-on TTT). Results for GA so far have been excellent with responses becoming more pronounced the longer the drug is given. Also the add on TTT to Soliris is promising since APL-2 seems to increase Hb to normal levels in those 15-20% of eculizumab treated patients where this is not the case. So while APLS is not a direct competitor to ALXN it might be a goo tuck-in acquisition candidate. One danger with blocking the complement system upstream at C3 level is the increased risk for side effects (infections etc). So far APLS has not reported anything to worry about, but those Se might become evident with longer exposure only. This has to be kept in mind. BTW, Chemocentryx (CCXI, currently ca 12.5 USD, EV 450m), one of my favorite long term biotech holding, is choosing exactly the opposite way: Blocking the complement system as downstream as possible, at the C5aReceptor level.(I own some APLS (bought at ca 25, i.e. higher than the current 23.5) but no ARGX). Taken altogether, although the company has made progress, ALXN at 29 B EV is too expensive for me. (BTW: The Wilson acquisition is ok) FWIWDr John"
"Dr John, looks like TGTX may have a big day. They stopped the Unity trial early. Met the endpoints!!! Once again you were right on it Dr John. Good call!"
"Hi Dr. John. So I finally had a chance to go over the Phase 1/2 results that J&J released from their Covid candidate (which is now in phase 3). And they are really accelerating these trials. They claim they will have some Phase 3 results by the end of the year. This could make it tougher for CPI-006 to 'catch-up' in the Covid 'race'. Though not impossible. Not to mention CPI-006 may have opened many other doors for itself. Anyway, below is the key points from J&J trial results:Immune Response Data""Seroconversion (the development of detectable antibodies) was observed in 99 percent of participants aged 18-55 years of age. 98 percent of participants were positive for neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 at day 29 post-vaccination. The Janssen COVID-19 vaccine candidate elicited strong antibody responses, strong T cell responses, and a Th1 response, believed to be protective against the risk of vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease.Immunogenicity (the ability to trigger an immune response) data from participants aged 65 years of age and above were available for the first 15 participants at the time of this post, with strong humoral and cellular immune responses elicited in all elderly participants who received a single dose of Janssen’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate.Immune responses were similar across the age groups studied, including older adults.Safety and Tolerability DataInterim safety data from the Phase 1/2a trial indicated that the majority of adverse events reported were mild to moderate (grade 1 and grade 2) in severity and generally occurred on the day of vaccination with symptoms generally resolving that day, or the following day."""
"Good Bye 2016....hello 2017!Concerning the stock market (and biotech in particular), 2016 has been a disappointing year (at least for me). Lets talk Life Science and Biotech: Sure, there were positives: the MDVN buyout and plenty of opportunity to buy shares of good companies at cheap prices, such as SGEN in the 30’s (now 56 after hitting 65 earlier on), INCY in the low 80’s (now ca 115), CCXI at 4 and change (now 8+), or the possibility to buy TSRO even after they announced the positive results of their PARP inhibitor at <100 (now > 140), just to name a few. But there were also negatives, such as the poor performance of some of my large holdings, foremost of TGTX (hovering again at 5, I still think it is one of the cheapest biotech stock out there!) or RDUS (which had a spike to 58 but is again in the low 40’s). The up and down swings were a great opportunity to trade names such as ALDR or MGNX (but at 20, sell at 30), even though both names might be even better suited as promising long term holdings. My biggest portfolio change has been the constant build up of my GILD position, which now has become the second largest position (after MDXG, before TECH) and currently hovers around my averaged buying price of ca 76. Yes, quite some of their R&D efforts blew up in smoke, but with two leading infective franchises, an excellent balance sheet with >15B cash, an EV/EBITDA of only 5.6, and a dividend yield of 2.5%, GILD is very very very cheap. Therefore, I’ll sit back and let the stock price take care of itself. I usually like it, when everyone despises a stock (which, of course, does not mean that I would buy into Valeant), or even when a whole sector is hated, such as was the case with the O&G sector in 2015/1H-2016. In fact, it was in good part due to my O&G stocks, that my 2016 performance was not THAT bad (good wins in RRC (sold out 90%), WPX (sold out completely), ATW (bought and sold out completely 2x) and NOV (sold 50%), while CVEO is still 20% in the red) . Back to Biotech. What will be interesting in 2017? Apart from watching GILD’s stock price appreciate, the theme, I guess, is the same as it was in the beginning of 2016: Keep a portfolio of mid caps with an advanced pipeline and at least one recent and important pipeline success and have some more risky small caps as turbo-booster (or bomb). Presently my US-biotech portfolio looks about like this (largest holding first): GILD >> TSRO > RDUS > about same size position in: INCY, SGEN, CCXI, TGTX > NBIX> BMRN (new), > ACRS (new) > SAGE, RARE, FGEN> BGNE, XLRN, SRPT, VSAR (see previous posts and see below), ALXN, and some other, smaller holdings, such as ASND (see below), Novan (NOVN,ca 25.5 USD, EV 365 mill, antivirals/dermatology: positive proof of concept in both treatment of acne and genital warts), or Cidara (CDTX , ca 10.5 USD, EV 100mill; early stage anti-infectives/antifungals, ex Trius-management). Some notes on individual positions: I don't have to repeat the story of a stock such as INCY, SGEN, TSRO or RDUS, TGTX, CCXI or NBIX (see previous posts) A new holding of mine (again after some years) is BMRN (I bought today at ca 89, after the reassuring new interim top line results for Hemophilia A were released). Why? I continue to like the rare disease space, BMRN is the largest independent rare diseases play out there, and Hem A is a unique and large market. Whether being bought out or staying independent, BMRN (EV of 14.5 mill USD) should do well over time. The same goes for Ultragenyx (RARE, currently at ca 74 USD, EV 2.75 mill, broad portfolio of (ultra-) orphan disease drugs in early to late stage trials, good CEO/scientific team). BTW, I now also own some SRPT, which at 29 has a EV of ca 1.3 B USD, which is rather cheap, considering that it has the only US-approved drug for DMD. Despite its questionable efficacy, etlepirsen prescriptions to DMD patients will continuously rise over time.Let's move over to Aclaris (ACRS) I just bought at ca 29 USD (ie current price), EV ca 550mill. ACRS has a promising dermatology pipeline with exceedingly positive interim ph 3 results for topical A-101 (high concentration hydrogen peroxide) in seborrhoic dermatitis (a large market with no real helpful drug on the market). A 101 is also in ph 2 for common warts, and ACRS has licensed a JAK inhibitor, which might have a good shot at improving some autoimmune forms of regional hair loss and pigmentation changes (vitiligo), amongst other indications. While I don’t want to proclaim ACRS as the “next Anacor”, I think the stock could be a big winner over the next years. Then there is Versartis (VSAR, ca 15.5, EV ca 400 mill, see also older posts). VSAR is developing a long acting version of hGH (human growth hormone). The hGh market is estimated to be around 3Billion (80% coming from pediatric and 20% from adult GH deficiency). Several large Pharma have hGH on the market, which, however has to be given daily as s.c. injection (→ poor compliance), as opposed to VSAR’s long acting hGH which can be given every other week, comes in an auto-injector, can be stored at room temperature and has a 29 gauge needle as opposed to the larger 30-32 gauge needle needed for the daily injections. VSAR has >2.5 y follow up on its long acting hGH (ph 3 and several ph 2 studies in pediatric and adult GH deficiency), which shows non inferiority to the daily hGH. Ascendis (ASND, ca 20 USD, EV ca 430mill USD) is also a fine company with its own technology and a rather equivalent product as VSAR. VSAR’s pipeline is somewhat more advanced, but ASND’s technology has the potential to a broader application to other proteins (p.ex PTH parathhormone). Korean based Genexine has it’s own version of a long acting hGH as well, but is even more behind VSAR. OPKO-Health, finally, just fell out of the race, when its own version of long acting hGH did not live up to expectations in a recent trial.What’s interesting outside biotech? Avionic company Esterline Technologies (ESL ca 88) recovered nicely from its lows and I am now even. I continue to hold onto the stock, thinking that 2017/8 might be even better; the new management team seems to have made its homework and the company could be taken out by a large company such as TransDigm Group (TDG). With two large holdings I am still some 25% in the red: First, hazardous waste company Stericycle (SRCL, currently at ca 79 USD): I don’t doubt that SRCL will regain its footing and hold onto the stock. I am also in about 25% the red with Inovalon (INOV, currently at ca 10.5 USD) INOV has over 3 USD net cash on hand, EV 1.1B, rev 450 mill, 9% profit margin, EV/EBITDA ca 11. INOV is a proprietary medical data company which helps to cut costs in the health system (hospital, doctors, etc) I doubled my position at ca 9+, when the stock dived because of short term road blocks. Patience.Kirby (KEX, currently at ca 66 USD), the largest US inland barge operator, came back nicely from it’s lows (but is still far below the high of 120 in 2014). KEX, one of my large positions (and solidly in the black), is a bet on the growing US economy and a long-term holding (when I think of it, it would be a stock Warren Buffett would lie to buy…)What else? Well of course staying the course with MDXG, TECH and also with Accelerate Diagnostics (AXDX) which continues to swing up and down (from 13 → 30 → 20). 2017 will be the year of reckoning….Regards Dr John"
"good bye 2020 - hello 2021 (part 1)As outlined in the ""so far so good"" message one month ago, 2020 has been a good year for biotech, (especially for hot sectors such as gene editing (in my portfolio BEAM, CRISPR), gene silencing (in my portfolio ARWR), cellular therapy (in my portfolio FATE) and targeted oncology (in my portfolio pex TPTX, ALXO) and many life science companies, especially those somehow involved in genomic analysis, single cell analysis and ultrasensitive biomarker assays (in my portfolio pex NSTG, NTRA, ILMN, BLI and QTRX, TECH). I expect this trend to continue in 2021, but would not be surprised, if the recent correction will continue after a possible short-lasting NY-uptrend. What might be areas of interest in 2021?1. Of course (and as widely advocated by Cathy Woods of ARK) the genomics space will continue to gain traction. I am thinking less of viral mediated gene therapy, but of Gene editing (BEAM, CRISPR) and top notch siRNA companies such as ARWR, as well as , p.ex., those life science companies mentioned above.2. Targeted protein degradation (TPD) has been another hot area in 2020, especially since Arvinas' (ARWR) showed proof of concept, that its PROTAC's can not only degrade the androgen receptor (AR) but also the estrogen receptor (ER), both important oncology targets. In an nutshell, TPD companies develop oral (usually once daily) treatments which target intracellular protein-hemostasis, mostly with the goal of degrading a specific target protein (pex the AR or ER), which is another way to come to the same results as, pex. the siRNA-technology tries to do. However TPD has the advantage of faster onset of action and oral administration. TPD is usually been done by heterobifunctional degraders (or PROTACs), where one part binds to a Ligase (mostly the E3 Ligase cereblon), linked to another binding domain which binds to the target protein. The E3-ligase transfers ubiquitin to the target protein , which in turn is degraded by the proteasome system. Then there are the monofunctional degraders, or ""molecular glues"", which change the ligase conformation, so that it sticks to the taget protein. For a long time the >600 human ligases have been considered as ""undruggable"" but this has changed now, and there is a lot of competition of private and recently IPO'ed companies. To my knowledge there are four public ""pure play"" TPD-companies, and I own them all in my portfolio. I first invested a rather small position in the TPD-""granddaddy"" Arvinas (ARVN, ca 85 USD/share, MC ca 4B) earlier this year, when the stock was in a slump (at ca 23). I recently bought shares of the other 3 companies (admittedly exactly at the wrong moment, when their stock price was higher than now, but added considerably during the downturn), and have a large position in Nurix (NRIX ca 32.5USD, MC ca 1.25B), a medium size position in Kymera (KYMR ca 62 USD, MC ca 2.75B) and smallish position in 4C (CCCC, ca 33 USD, MC ca 1.5B). I have been especially impressed by the top execs of NRIX ( CEO Arthur Sands) and think their (preclinical) BTK-degrading pipeline has a lot of evident potential. What's more NRIX does not only harness target proteins, but its technology can also inhibit degradation of target proteins, thereby increasing their concentration, such as in CBL-B an intracellular ""immuno-oncology""- signalling protein (downstream of the T-cell receptor), and upregulation of CBL-B by NRIX's preclinical compound shows monotherapy anti-tumor activity. KYMR, on the other hand, might have a CEO who is a trifle too promotional. The company is aiming to build a human E3-Ligase whole body atlas, which would indicate amongst other things organ-specific or cell-type specific ligases, which of course is intellectually alluring when it come to develop targeted therapies with little side effects. KYMR has an intriguing (preclinical) pipeline, and (as does NRIX) lucrative alliances with Big Pharma. I usually shy away from preclinical companies without clinical proof of concept, but I make an exception in the TPD-space. I think that these companies are platform companies, ie with a large area of application of their technology/drugs.to be continued in part 2"
"Dr John, I want to bring you a post(you can also find it on the AXDX board, which is where I found it). I bring this to your attention only to see if you have any reaction. I know what your past response has been, when I brought up this issue. But these TTOO's posters won't stop. They seem to be wagering a campaign against AXDX. See below:""This is a ""guest post"" from a T2 biosystems shareholder reacting to the recent controversy between the two companies, mostly caused by your CEO ditzing T2. I went back and listened to to the Accelerate CEO's 2017.06.14 Accelerate Diagnostics at William Blair and Company, and found him to be misleading and dishonest when discussing the competition. Here were my objections:1) The slide showing the competition places them all into a chart. The rows sort into faster/slower and the column sort into ID only/ID+susceptibility. My first beef here is that T2 is faster than all of the tests there, including Accelerate's, because it operates pre-culture. Mehren is being overly-generous to his own test to put it in the same speed category as T2. T2 returns a positive/negative result in 3-5 hours, before any of the other tests can even be started, if ever, given that blood culture has a 40-50% false-negative rate. T2 will be of great use in the emergency department, whereas the patient won't even be in the ED anymore when a positive BC comes back. Another beef is that Mehren mentions speeds of the non-T2 so-called ""rapid"" tests, omitting to mention that T2 is the fastest. In doing so, he tries to draw attention away from T2, which is evidently the one he fears the most.Furthermore, it is not even clear that T2 and AXDX are competitors. The tests do different things at different times. 2) Mehren states ""if you don't do susceptibility you don't get an intervention"".This is simply dishonest. The pathogens covered by T2bateria were specificly chosen to include species for which you have a substantial risk of death if you are left on emperic broad-specturm antibiotics. (E. Coli was included because it is common, however.) If T2candida shows you have a fungal infection and you are on a broad-spectrum antibiotic then your doctor will treat with an antifungal, because candida is not bacteria and is currently about 40% lethal. The choice & dose of the antifungal depends on the single or multiple species detected. 3) Mehren states ""... if you don't get an intervention you don't save money.""This is multiply deceptive. First of all, there have been customer reports at medical conferences of T2candida saving money by withdrawal of unnecessary antifungals above the cost of the test. This is a saving without an intervention. Candida is currently 40% lethal, so physicians treat many patients on tenuous suspicion of candida, for ""CYA"" purposes.Furthermore, T2 can also save money because earlier and appropriate treatment is cheaper than waiting until a patient has multiple organ failure, brain damage, and a long-term stay in the ICU.4) Mehren says ""physicials are loath to change treatment until they get a susceptibility device"".See (2) and (3) above. To be clear: I'm not trying to evaluate whether AXDX is a good investment or estimate how many lives it will save. Clearly, there is an urgent need for susceptibility testing. My point is just that dishonestly belittling T2 simply makes Mehren look bad, and it a testiment to T2's technology that Mehren must resort to deception."""
Did anyone see that TECH and NSTG are teaming up?
"Dr John---good news, I scored a winner with CVRS. I had a cost average of 1.80 and it was bought out by Siemens for 4.28 today. I'll take it!!!"
"Dr John, it seems I'm getting some feed-back from the TTOO board. I don't think they are my biggest fan. I went to inform them that AXDX might have a better system. This is the reply I received, I wonder if you agree?""@LUCKYMASHEDPOTATO You need an education in how the two systems differ - AXDX's system works off of a ""positive blood culture"" - that means until a positive blood culture that takes on average 2-3 days and misses 30%-40% of infections is generated, AXDX's system doesn't even come into play. The T2 system works directly off a blood sample - the result is 5-8 hours at 90%+ accuracy vs 2-3 days plus whatever AXDX system time takes at less than 70% accuracy. Try again, sparky!"""

"so far so good, pt 2:...and the biotech sector continues to be ""en vogue"", at least in selected sectors. While many large cap biotechs and more traditionally oriented mid-large caps (such as Alexion or Neurocrine) are treading water at best, selected ""targeted""oncology companies and some gene editing outfits are red hot.Since my last post 3 weeks ago (somewhat ""buried"" in an answer to LMP), Oric (ORIC) has been performing very well (then 25, now 35), as did Crisper (CRSP: then 106, now 148), while Mersana (MRSN) is still trading at ca 23.5 USD (Interim top line results in rr-Ovarial Cancer should be released soon).I have repeatedly mentioned (and added to my position) Beam (BEAM, now at 67) and Fate (FATE, now at 83), which have been outstanding performers, as was ALXO which I increased significantly in size. All have shown impressive new (proof of concept-) data and, aprtly due to the SP-appreciation, all three figure now among my ""top 10"" biotech holdings (my top 10 positions being: CRVS >TGTX >ARWR >TPTX >BEAM >FATE >AUPH >KOD >ALXO >MRSN=ALXN)for quite some time, I owned a rather small position in the opthalmology biotech Kodiak (KOD) (initial purchase price at ca 50, now at 124). Only recently I woke up and increased my position significantly. For some reason I did not appreciate the true value of their pipeline and the strategic brilliance of KOD's top management team. (I strongly suggest to listen into their MorganStanley Healthcare conference presentation).As to these Zoom-Healthcare conferences: For me as an investor it is extremely helpful to see/judge how the top management team of different biotech companies is responding to questions. You feel immediately who is top notch/ with whom you'd like to invest (provided the stock is still reasonably priced). Examples being: Beam, Fate, KOD, ORIC, KROS. I also strongly suggest to look into the Jefferies London Healthcare conference and specifically listen to those Zoom ""fireside chats"", which were hosted by Michel Yee from Jefferies, an extremely bright analyst asking very informative questions (he interviewed, pex Beam, Fate, Oric, Alxo, Kron, Akro, amongst others). Access via the respecitve biotech hoempage)Three large long term medtech-/life science positions of mine (which I have repeatedly written about) have shown a very nice performance in 2020: Nanostring (NSTG: beginning 2020: 27 USD--> now 63) and Quanterix (QTRX: beginning 2020: 23 USD --> now 47) and Natera (NTRA: beginning 2020: 35 USD --> now 90). I recently bought a midsize position in Illumina at ca 295 (ILMN , now ca 340USD), because I think their acquisition of GRAIL is a long term winner in the liquid biopsy space. Grail with its methylation based NGS platform is IMO superior to Thrive (also an interesting company, recently acquired by EXAS) and at least equivalent to Guardant Health (GH).Taken altogether: Moments like now are dangerous: You look back on a very decent portfolio performance, to say the least, and pat yourself on the shoulder, thinking you are sooo shrewd. However, in the end, 3/4 of it is the ""flood lift all boats""- effect (you happen to be in the right sector). I am still positive, but there is no reason, why all these wonderful biotechs could not trade 50% below the current valuation. Therefore, I increased my cash position again.FWIWDr JohnThere are some very very promising ""next-gen"" companies in the biotech/medtech space, which, unfortunately are too expensive most of the time, such as Ten-X Genomics (TXG), Berkley Lights (BLI), Schroedinger (SDGR), or Relay (RELY). (I won small amount of BLI and SDGR)."

"Finally, the expected biotech correction seems to have arrived (or started :-)).While I sold some ""less conviction-positions"" last week, I currently do not intend to become active. I have never been an excellent market timer, and I think that the positions I wrote about in my last post (pt1-3) will continue to do well in the long run.One major move I made about 1 week ago, by tripling again my AUPH position, which I had progressively reduced in the months before. After having listened to the CEO's JPM-presentation my confidence had increased not so much, that voclosporin will be approved (there was not much doubt about that), but more so that AUPH is capable of doing a launch on its own. Besides, at 13.5 USDF its share price was way too low. I must admit that I am somewhat underwhelmed by the rise to 17 and change, but this will change over time and I'll not complain. For those interested, I add a copy'n'paste piece I posted on the Corvus board regarding Gritstone oncology (GRTS).Gritstone's (GRTS, currently ca 20 USD) recent spectacular rise in its share price is no hype, IMO. One can of course discuss, whether the SP overshot in the short term, but GRTS is an very interesting, serious company, which I have followed for quite some time because of its capacity of detect cancer neoantigens (including tumour specific epitopes arising form gene fusions), which might be given together with checkpoint inhibitors. GRTS has a powerful antigen delivery and T-cell epitope prediction technology, which comes in handy when dealing with mutation variants of the SARS CoV2 virus.GRTS's vaccine candidate has a broadened set of antigens (including strictly conserved epitopes, which should also be present in mutant variants, and, possibly in a majority of other Coronaviruses). Unlike other vaccine developer, which use either viral vectors or m-RNA, GRTS chooses a heterologous boost-prime regimen, i.e. a two pronged approach, optimised to induce strong T-cell, as well as antibody responses.: A first vaccination is using the ChAd-viral vector (similar to the adenoviral vector AZN uses in tis vaccine candidate), while the second vaccination is being done by self-assembling RNA (SAM). Non human primate studies show that it is harder to achieve robust antibody titres using the adenoviral ChAd vector, as compared to SAM (not surprisingly, AZN's vaccine candidate showed less robust results than other vaccines), while the ChAd-vector primes T-cells better than does SAM. A combination of the 2 modalities might therefore be the optimal solution.Dr John"

Dr John- I left a post just below as well. But I want to ask if you have any observations to make about this Global Pandemic. And how it is affecting your investing decisions? So I'm close to Admin in several hospital systems. And in March and April they had very big net losses. No elective surgeries. And if that continues; and people don't come back out (either too scared or they now figure they don't need the procedure) and have elective surgeries; many healthcare workers will be unemployed. That isn't 'baked' in to the unemployment numbers in the U.S. yet. So would it be wise to continue to invest in healthcare? Or maybe shift the 'types' of healthcare companies that one should start looking at given the new world reality? I'm so interested to hear your thoughts on this.

"Bio-Techne Corporation (TECH)Annual Report, 2019 Available from SEC on 10-Khttps://sec.report/Document/0001437749-19-021760/"
"Bye bye 2019, part 1... We are not yet quite there, and who knows if we'll not have a decent biotech selloff before NY? What I witness now is the usual pattern of a ""melt-up"", where in the last phase forgotten and decimated small and micro caps have an explosive revival, without significant news (pex: JNCE, CRVS, CLVS, OVID...). Which does not mean, however, that some of these names have not excellent intrinsic potential, irrespective of the melt -up (such as p.ex OVID).My long-term favorite, BioTechne (TECH, 217 USD, EV 8.7B, EV/EBITDA 42.5(!), P/S 11, P/E ca 40) has outstanding underlying strength, due to the flawless execution of the CEO and his team. TECH's future is bright, and it's valuation is accordingly high (see above). However, TECH is performing and it's Protein Simple division is in the starting blocks to compete against SIMOA from Quanterix ((QTRX, ca 24 USD, EV 660m, growing revenues at 30- 40+%), another of my favorite holdings, albeit more of a niche player and less diversified than TECH. QTRX has had a good year, although its valuation has come down since summer. The same goes for Nanostring (NSTG), where I profited from the depressed share price an upped my position some 2 months ago (NSTG, 26 USD, EV 920m USD). Like QTRX, NSTG continues to have very appealing long term potential: above all GeoMX DSP, and looking more out into the future, tapping into the infectious disease rapid diagnostic and AST market (which might make offering such as those from Accelerate Diagnostics (AXDX) ultimately obsolete).The BIG NEWS for me, however came in during the last week: Outstanding ph3-study results from 2 of my large, long term biotech holdings, namely Chemocentryx (CCXI, ca 28 USD, MC 1.6 B)),which quadrupled, and, today, from Aurinia (AUPH, currently 17USD, MC 1.6 B). CCXI (ca 28 USD, MC 1.6 B), which so far doubled today. Both scored wins in the same field, i.e autoimmune mediated nephology indications (Lupus nephrtitis and ANCA vasculitis respectively). Both had top notch, highly significant results both in primary and all secondary endpoint, results without any fly in the ointment. The icing on the cake is, that both companies have a promising pipeline in mid-advanced stages (From a market potential point of view, CCXI's next big thing will be hidradenitis suppurativa (HC), while Aurinia had amazing ph2 results in the billion dollar market for dry eye syndrome). IMO, both companies are by no means overvalued with a MC of 1.6B. While I sold 40% of my CCXI at 32 and change, I might add again, once they decide to do a secondary offering. I did not sell any AUPH. For comparison, look at a company such as Allakos (ALLK). ALLK (125USD, MC 6.1 B USD). ALLK had it's own excellent results in gastrointestinal hypereosiophilic syndrome. This is a large basket of diseases which range in severity from mild symptoms (the majority) to more severe symptoms (the minority). I think the 6 B MC is very high, especially if you consider the fact that most of the GI-hypereosinophilic syndromes are not life threatening, in contrast to ANCA or lupus nephropathy. Granted, ALLK has the lure of label expansion into chronic urticria etc, but again, I doubt that payers and doctors will be willing to pay for/prescribe an utra-expensive monoclonal ab for all but the most severe forms of these conditions. Therefore, while ALLK's 6B MC might be on the high side, CCXI's and AUPH's mc of 1.6B is definitively on the low side and I expect the SP to gradually increase.-> to be continuedDJ"

"Just a follow up on Corvus (CRVS), a immuno-oncology company (--> Adenosin pathway) I mentioned about 3m ago (share price then 2.35, share price now 4.0, MC 112m, cash 65m, no debt). CRVS has a very seasoned executive team (having been involved in the development of ibrutinib and rituximab). CRVS' CEO, R.Miller was the CEO of Pharmacyclis. The stock popped recently not because of oncology news, but because one of their clinical compounds, CPI-006 could have a role in the TTT of Cvoid -19. I mostly shun away from covid-19 companies, but this one looks very promising to me, especially in the light of CRVS' tiny market cap. CPI-006 is a humanized mab directed against CD73, an epitope on naive B-cells. CPI-006 induces B-cell activation (--> Plasmablasts, Plasma-cells, which secrete (polyclonal) immunoglobulins) and induces the long lived memory B cells. Other biotechs have also compounds against CD73 in their (pre-)clinical pipeline, but it seems that those act mainly via the adenosin pathway and that CPI-006 is the only one with the unique B-cell activating properties. Cpi-006 has been tested in Corvus' oncology program already in ca 90 patients so far, and it has been shown, that CPI-006 significantly increases markers of Plasma-cells (CD27), and of CD69, a signal for B-cell trafficking to the lymph nodes. What's more CPI-006 induces a switch to memory B-cells (by a factor of 2-3), as evidenced by IgD negativity and CD27 positivity. Corvus is not aware of any other company having a similar compound in clinical testing and intends to use CPI-006 as kind of ""therapeutic vaccination"" for Covid 19 (ie boosting immune response and antibodies in Covid19 patients). They plan to do a dose escalating study with mild to moderated Covid19 patients (PCR positivity <7d is required) and endpoints will be anti-Covid 19 IgM and IgG titers at 21 d, with follow up for 6m. Therefore first results will be ready in 3-6 m. Treatment will consist in a single ""shot"" of CPI-006. What's especially interesting is a very remarkable single case record (I know, n=1 does not prove anything, but the case is remarkable enough to merit attention). A 69 y old patient with COPD and NSCLC (this group of patients usually have a 40% mortality with Covid 19) was tested PCR+ for Covid 19 on the first day of being given CPI-006 in the context of one of Corvus' oncology trials. Despite being at high risk for serious disease/death due to covid19, she not only remained asymptomatic, but mounted extremely high anti SARS-Cov-2 antibody titers (IgG >1:100'000, IgM 1:3200 by week 6) which is not only unusually high, but especially unusual for a patient with NSCLC. By w6 the patient was PCR negative. Taken altogether, I think the rationale for treatment with CPI-006 is sound and the limited anecdotic evidence was compelling enough for me to triple my stake in CRVS today (at 4.02 USD). What I like with the CRVS-story is, that I initially bought it because of their oncology assets (which are more promising than 1 year ago), but now there is an additional, unexpected twist, adding to the story.Dr JohnPS: what else? Arrowhead (ARWR, currently at 48.5 has been a steady and stellar performer since I mentioned it a few weeks ago at 36USD. The story is getting more attention. Well deserved! Base-editing company BEAM (Beam 26.5USD, MC 1.3b) has also been performing very well, since I mentioned it 3m ago at 16, while k-ras company Revolution Medicine (RMED, now at 28, MC 1.65b) which I mentioned 3m ago at 22 more than doubled to 46, but came back to the current 28 (also because of a secondary offering). I continue to hold both, but do not add to my position.Finally, I reentered Acceleron (XLRN currently at 99, MC 5.9B (my average buying price ca 95USD)), an old time favourite of mine, which I sold some time ago. I bought into the stock mainly because of the promising results of its pulmonary hypertension program."

Got a question for you guys.I heard that Recombinat ACE2 can be a remedy for COVID 19 and the medicine is in a phase 2.And Bio-Techne Corp (TECH) are on a research about Recombinat ACE2 Is that true?
moving up again ...not just some static company selling the same old inventory....
Dr John thanks for the recent updates. You have thrown out some interesting ideas to look into. Good call so far on ARQT. And I will second congratulating ByeHl on the SAVA call. Truly outstanding. Dr John I just read your post on the CRVS board about the revenue Lilly had in the 4Q from its ‘anti Covid-man’. My only thought is timing. Don’t you think it is too early with CRVS? Let’s assume trials continue to go well. At minimum isn’t the CRVS candidate 2 or 3 years away? That has been my concern from the first time you mentioned CRVS. Anyway thanks for the updates Dr John. And cheers to yet another great quarter by TECH!!! The one we could always count on.
"good bye 2020- hello 2021 (part2)While I think it is a good moment to buy those TPD-companies mentioned above, one has to bear in mind that, apart from ARVN, these are all preclinical companies, meaning significant news flow might be sparse during the next 6-12m, and I expect the share price to fluctuate considerably. 3. I continue to hold onto most of my large long-term holdings, which I have written about many times and expect them to continue to deliver, such as:a) for biotechs: ARVN, TPTY, BEAM, FATE, ALXO, ASND. Revolution Medicine (RVMD, ca 39.5 USD, MC 2.6B) is a leader in the RAS-space with a diversified pipeline, but has been a laggard as of recently, what I expect to change in 2021 (my average buying price ca 41). Then, there is of course TGTX, (52 USD, MC 7.15B), the outstanding performer in 2020 (quintupling form 10 to >50 USD), thanks to the (expected) positive ph3 data of ublituximab in RRMS. I sold a good 50% of my TGTX at current prices. At a valuation of >7B there is less room of safety than before, especially since TGTX's B-cell pipeline, while with good results, is swimming in a pond with more and more innovative competitors. Ublituximab, on the other hand, might be a trifle more effective than other anti CD20 in RRMS. However, with Roche's Ocrevus now being approved for administration over 2 hours, the ""one-hour advantage"" of ublituximab is not spectacular anymore. I sold about 2/3 of Aurinia (AUPH, ca 13.8 USD, MC ca 1.75B), which recently performed less well than expected, and still hold a moderate-size position of my long term winner Chemocentryx (CCXI, ca 62USD, MC ca 4.25B)b) in life science/medtech space my large long term holdings continue to be: TECH, QTRX, MDXG (currently at 9USD, MC 1B, P/S ca 3.8 which is very low --> expect further significant SP-appreciation), BDX, NSTG, NTRA, MDT.4. in the pulmonology space I have a rather large position in Acceleron (XLRN 128USD, MC 7.7B), where I expect Sotatercept to become a pillar in the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension. For the treatment of Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (and other fibrotic diseases) I am looking at the selective Integrin portfolio of Pliant (PLRX, ca 22.5USD, MC 800m, cash 290m), in which I have a moderate size position (ca at current price levels). However, both XLRN and PLRX will not have significant news flow for most of the year (or at least 1H2021), meaning, that the SP might linger during the next couple of months (I don't care). While Pliant also has a NASH-program (partnered with Novartis), my NASH pick is AKERO (AKRO, 25.8 USD, MC ca 900m, cash 290m). AKRO's EFX (Efruxifermin), a FcFGF21 fusion protein has shown a best in class fibrosis reduction and NASH improvement profile, (also compared to the 2 other companies (Bristol Myers and 89Bio) which have pegylated versions of FGF21 in earlier stage clinical studies than AKRO. AKRO's low valuation is best explained by a continued nervousness of investors when it comes to the NASH space (due to ICPT's CR-letter earlier this year). One negative point to keep an eye on are non trivial GI-side effects at high doses of EFX. As it is the case with XLRN and PLRX (and with the TPD-companies), AKRO will not present crucial news for most of 2021, since the ph3 is just being started.to be continued in pt 3"
