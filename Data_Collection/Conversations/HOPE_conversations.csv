"HOPE stock is taking a terrible beating without much bad news on the bank. It will take some exciting news for the price to climb ouy of this rut. When was the last time anyone heard ""exciting"" announcement from HOPE? I'll watch from sideline until a new base is formed. Good luck to all"
"NNOX leadership composition alone gives me solid #HOPE #BELIEVE. To hell with Citron Research! Andrew Edward Left is an activist short seller, author and editor of the online investment newsletter Citron Research. See? He is the real scammer and fraud! Dipping price and buying."
The drop today is equal to about a whole year of dividends .14 X 4 = .56 AND WHERE DOWN .50 CENTS ON no NEWS. Every bank stock is taking a big hit today regardless of earnings. It is like there pricing in a coming recession today before it gets here. I did not see think hope would drop this low or see this coming 30 days ago.
sell while you still can
"Where is the trust and estate services division at HOPE? Korean Americans don't know about Americanized trust and estate services because of the legalese and cultural differences. HOPE is in the best position to offer it to them, and they are the best name to trust. It seems that HOPE management has too many deposit and lending guys, and not enough non-interest income stream guys like wealth management, trading, estate and trust etc. It's time to grow up and play ball in the big leagues. You've grown too big for the sand lot."
New to this stock stuff . I brought some of this CEI because of the 52 week high. #hope # clueless
get ready for a nice surge in this stock after the Aug 2nd release of earnings come out ! #hope so !
Korean companies are flocking to the US to set up shop here because of TRUMP. http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/tech/2019/05/693_268834.html

"SHIBA INU doesn't stop until we do. If we don't stop, this could be another AMC or Gamestop move. Who knows, make the odds possible. People say that's impossible, well I guess you haven't seen the world so dedicated to want to to feel the same financial freedom as you. This is what it looks like to work hard for what you want. Motivating others to pursue the same dream is a blessing. Its what helps this world be a little kinder. #hope"

"There has not been any bad news or down speculation from analysts on HOPE, but the stock is down about 40% in such a short time. It feels like a free fall. Is there a parachute that's about to open? Perhaps all these sellers know something I don't... what's going on here?"
"IMO, HOPE revenue downturn is due to a big chunk of the bank's clients losing business in China. There is good chance of Q2 result being uglier than the downturn exposed in Q1. I don't see any near term upside for HOPE. GLTA"
"If the Customer Deposits number goes up, is it considered Organic growth if you strong armed your customer into doing so?Seems to me as that would be considered mafia-like and a fradulent way to improve those numbers."
OSCAR.... WHERE IS MY DIVIDEND YOU OWE ME?! #hope
HOPE diving like a sub under attack. Any good news on the horizon?
"Hope is holding onto their MBS now. If rates go down, that means the market value of their securities goes up!"
Hope Bancorp reached a 52 Week low at 10.87
I think it's great that HOPE is doing warehouse lending and increasing their mortgage securitization business.
"Again, lower rates are good for HOPEs MBS trading desk. Lower rates means higher Mortgage values they sell into the market. Gains will be booked as securitization income. This is why bank diversification of product lines is good."
"any opinions on how much of a re-rating is in order here? gotta figure that hope, HAFC, CATY, EWBC etc get a demographic tailwind without the president actively trying to strangle immigration. I'm thinking we shojld be able to someday get to 80% of tangible book. hard to believe these immigrant banks used to regularly trade at a premium to book pre financial crisis"
"I’m feeling great about INO. In the US, we are known for our robust military program. In regards to health implications, we are positioned to supply the top vaccine in the world once health authorities in each country give the green light. Dr. Kim once used the analogy about how Inovio’s DNA vaccine generates T-cells in your body. Dr. Kim noted “you can think of T-cells as the military units in your body combating the bad cells.” #INOVIO #INO-4800 #HOPE #SAFE #EFFECTIVE #IMMUNOGENICITY #NEUTRALIZING #STRONG"

I'm all for the pump and dump. But don't get caught up in hype as other make money off you. this will eventually go back down and you have to decide how much money to keep before then. I bought at 7 and sold at 14. great job for those who have held but you make nothing until you sell. #hope everyone wins
I bet HOPE's corporate treasury business will take it to the next level.

"In this volatile market environment filled with uncertainty, HOPE seems to be lost in abyss. Major revenue stream for the bank is independent trading/manufacturing companies with business ties in China. I'm curious what percentage of HOPE's commercial loans to these merchants are in danger of default. It's true corporations like Under Armour, Nike, etc. are moving their manufacturing away from China, but smaller merchants don't have the resources and luxury of time to relocate their business so rapidly. HOPE management needs to expand revenue streams if it is to succeed in long term. HOPE stock is down below $12 and it still does not feel like bottom. I'm staying on sideline until next earnings report. I'm leaning towarfs HOPE coming up short on its earnings. Good luck to all!"
"A big chunk of biz loan clients at HOPE do biz in China, which might put a dent in HOPE's 3Q & 4Q earnings. JMO"
was there any mention of the msb's in the last conf call?
