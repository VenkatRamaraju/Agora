"So 10-K earnings are on May 12, 2017...anyone have an idea what the outcomes are gonna be like? Looking to discuss"
I'm all for the pump and dump. But don't get caught up in hype as other make money off you. this will eventually go back down and you have to decide how much money to keep before then. I bought at 7 and sold at 14. great job for those who have held but you make nothing until you sell. #hope everyone wins
"OK, so....selling at a large discount to tangible book decent balance sheet, capital ratios etc. so IMHO will withstand the hit to the loan book that's coming.presumably continuing their buybackmakes about .01 per share every few days when there's not a pandemicand most importantly, covid-19 peaked in South Korea Feb 29, so presumably some of the loan book now has some improving fundamentals, esp with SK being a likely beneficiary of the US/China trade troubles. I mean, I get it that this is a shock out of nowhere and that things will suck short term but I'm with Michael Levitt on the progression of the virus - things will likely be better in a few weeks, and most bank stock, including this - HAFC too - will recover. Risk / reward at this point seems really favorable. Waiting to hear someone tell me I'm an idiot"

"Where is the trust and estate services division at HOPE? Korean Americans don't know about Americanized trust and estate services because of the legalese and cultural differences. HOPE is in the best position to offer it to them, and they are the best name to trust. It seems that HOPE management has too many deposit and lending guys, and not enough non-interest income stream guys like wealth management, trading, estate and trust etc. It's time to grow up and play ball in the big leagues. You've grown too big for the sand lot."

"There has not been any bad news or down speculation from analysts on HOPE, but the stock is down about 40% in such a short time. It feels like a free fall. Is there a parachute that's about to open? Perhaps all these sellers know something I don't... what's going on here?"
The drop today is equal to about a whole year of dividends .14 X 4 = .56 AND WHERE DOWN .50 CENTS ON no NEWS. Every bank stock is taking a big hit today regardless of earnings. It is like there pricing in a coming recession today before it gets here. I did not see think hope would drop this low or see this coming 30 days ago.

"any opinions on how much of a re-rating is in order here? gotta figure that hope, HAFC, CATY, EWBC etc get a demographic tailwind without the president actively trying to strangle immigration. I'm thinking we shojld be able to someday get to 80% of tangible book. hard to believe these immigrant banks used to regularly trade at a premium to book pre financial crisis"

"I’m feeling great about INO. In the US, we are known for our robust military program. In regards to health implications, we are positioned to supply the top vaccine in the world once health authorities in each country give the green light. Dr. Kim once used the analogy about how Inovio’s DNA vaccine generates T-cells in your body. Dr. Kim noted “you can think of T-cells as the military units in your body combating the bad cells.” #INOVIO #INO-4800 #HOPE #SAFE #EFFECTIVE #IMMUNOGENICITY #NEUTRALIZING #STRONG"

Hope has a business model that I think has better growth prospects along with a more enduring moat than nearly all other US banks. I also think Hope is a better business overall than most US businesses. The stock price around $18 is reasonable and a better buy than most stocks today by a long shot. A lower entry price would be fantastic of course.
"HOPE stock is taking a terrible beating without much bad news on the bank. It will take some exciting news for the price to climb ouy of this rut. When was the last time anyone heard ""exciting"" announcement from HOPE? I'll watch from sideline until a new base is formed. Good luck to all"
was there any mention of the msb's in the last conf call?
"Hope is holding onto their MBS now. If rates go down, that means the market value of their securities goes up!"
"IMO, HOPE revenue downturn is due to a big chunk of the bank's clients losing business in China. There is good chance of Q2 result being uglier than the downturn exposed in Q1. I don't see any near term upside for HOPE. GLTA"

"In this volatile market environment filled with uncertainty, HOPE seems to be lost in abyss. Major revenue stream for the bank is independent trading/manufacturing companies with business ties in China. I'm curious what percentage of HOPE's commercial loans to these merchants are in danger of default. It's true corporations like Under Armour, Nike, etc. are moving their manufacturing away from China, but smaller merchants don't have the resources and luxury of time to relocate their business so rapidly. HOPE management needs to expand revenue streams if it is to succeed in long term. HOPE stock is down below $12 and it still does not feel like bottom. I'm staying on sideline until next earnings report. I'm leaning towarfs HOPE coming up short on its earnings. Good luck to all!"
