"Look at the hitjob from Lucia Maffei. Not a single mention of IRBT beating earnings estimate by 126%. Instead its all yadda yadda yadda about tariffs and supply chain issues. Truth is, the 126% earnings beat came in spite of these headwinds. So just think what will happen in 2022 when these issues will go away. Plus I think Terra will launch before next summer. Go longs!"
Irbt purchased over 1m shares @ 83.56. This stock is easy $90-110. This is going to explode tmo. Load up! I will be
IRBT NTLA BA SAVA INMD SRPT have been down so much guys. We must go up from here...
"Need your help. 2 quick questions on short stock: (a) IRBT has about roughly the same number of shares outstanding and float: approximately 28 million. Yet, Yahoo (as well as other sites) reports short stock as 44% of float and 26% of outstanding shares. Shouldn't short stocks be the same percentage of both outstanding and float in this instance? (b) Approximate 92% of IRBT's outstanding shares are held by institutions and about 2% of the IRBT outstanding shares are held by insiders. That is, 94% of the shares are non-retail. How does then one explain that the short sales are 26% of the outstanding stock? Only 6% of the outstanding shares are then available to cover the short sales of 26% of outstanding shares. Correct? Am I reading the numbers correctly? Request your input. It wouldn't make sense for the institutions that are holding IRBT shares to also short them. Does it? One holds shares only if one expects the share value to appreciate. One shorts shares only if one expects the share value to decline. So, it wouldn't make sense to both hold and short the same stock at the same time not even for hedging purposes, would it?"
"Highly shorted, low float, sold performing company......Very tempting to take a long position today pre-earnings, though thinking hold off to post and buy if it dips. Easy to assume the chip shortage will somehow damper the forecast."
Good sign AH is stable. I think it will go up by 10% after conference call
Did they release ER?
Why so many shorts in this stock?
Get in while the stock is so cheap. Buy as much as you can. It is on sale. Once and a lifetime opportunity. You will never see it this cheap again.

Easyyy money enjoy longs. Best part about heavy shorted stocks. In times of un comfort the shorts blow!!
sooo earnings.... what to expect.... numbers are hard to predict with this chip shortage for this qtr. stock has been pretty much flat the last 3 months after it was beaten down... historically we get a run into earnings and then a beat down... but i dont see any significant run happening before oct 27th... so curious how we get treated after... like seriously if they get beat down another 10-15% after earnings this I want to personally take a loan out buy them and take them private myself lol...
today release raport?
They beat both eps and revenue. It should be green at any moment.
"What a discount buy, thanks"
Most people remain poor only because friends and relatives discouraged and advise them against investing and trading BTC while the wise ones kept investing and growing higher financially
"Forecast haircut due to '21 tariff relief expecations reductions + shipping costs increase tarnish otherwise stellar Q (beat on rev and EPS handily). Long term execution in place. No reason to sell, although could see headwinds in short term due to forecast (which has been our bogey man forever)."
Back to December 2020 price!
Stack the shares for when the short go pop— massive cash position this stock is in my top 10 for the last few days.
"Man, I still don't get why IRBT lags!! I believe it's just a question of time..."
"If this company continues to be so ""un-loved"" for its performance and leadership position, it will bet bought out for 1.5 to 2x easy. The IP portolio alone is worth it. This company prints money and has no debt. Robot-as-a-service is awesome constant rev stream. It is ridiculous that it trades for around 2B. Easy snap-up for Amazon, Apple, MSFT, others looking to get further into home automation. 100+ by end of Q1'22 due to buyout or recognition."
Can anybody figure out why this company has such high short interest?Little to no debt. Plenty of cash. 5.4% yield on income. Leader in their product category. What am I missing?
The flush on chips price future rise (+20% according to manufacturers)

In addition to highlighting our vision and strategy, our leadership team plans to share greater insight into the many exciting initiatives that will underpin an updated set of long-term financial targets. Stay tuned for more details on this event."""
Not very good not bad. I love the no debt. Cash in hands down from last Q because the buyback of shares. Let see tomorrow if we can stay on green.
This stock is a strong buy. Low share count. No debt. Clear path forward once supply chain issues alleviate next year. Subscription service making iRobots more affordable for lower-income folks is genius. This thing is literally trading at 1.5x price/sales. Insane.
"Interesting, normally rallies into earnings, then gets short attacked and drops after earnings. Is this setting up to do the opposite- trading down pre release and then spike after earnings. Never can tell with IRBT. Waiting on the lawnmower release"

This stock needs to make rounds on CNBC and Youtube. The volume today after an ER is disastrous.
