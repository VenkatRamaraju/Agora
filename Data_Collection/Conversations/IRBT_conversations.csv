"Shorts, please feel free to criticize the following. This stock is undervalued. Balance sheet is phenomenal. $264 million in cash plus an additional $57 million from the tariff expense (total of $324 million). They also have access to $150 million in credit. That would bring its liquidity to ~$500 million dollars. The market cap of this company is only ~$1 billion dollars. Combine this with a $200 million stock repurchase program at which a quarter of this was executed at the 52 week low. Talk about perfect timing. This 83% short float is just a ticking time bomb to get hurt."
"...and another thing! Colin talks about the chip shortage (like everyone else) and the resulting increase in component costs. This is not altogether bad news for the company. Though I dislike artificial constraint of competition, IRobot is in the strongest position to weather the spike in component prices. This is going to be difficult for the company's one legitimate competitor (Roborock) to negotiate as LIDAR is already very expensive, they have no self-emptying feature and they simply do not have the market penetration or economies of scale to hang. The cost spikes may, additionally, drive bottom-dwelling patent infringing toy makers (Shark, etc.) out of the robotics business altogether.Like to steal intellectual property and slap together junk knock-offs and then try sell that junk based on price alone? That just got much harder. Good luck."
"Bad planning on chips--everyone saw this coming; should have been played better. Logistics leadership is weak apparently. Look at Ford....just beat w/ same general problem. That said, there is nothing fundamentally weak w/ the business model or demand....so this is really short term pain only. Investors, as always, have no patience for this company and cut it no slack...so it will be down significantly on the miss and the lowered 2021 expectations. I will hold....nothing has changed long term. Will be interesting to see what new products get announced as noted....look for lidar integration into Roomba line....but can they even source given what they just reported? Terra is probably on back burner for now...perhaps late 2022. In short, they need a real leader in ops to get control over this semi issue....can't be just fielding ""the dog ate my homework"" and be reactionary....need to actually own it and find alternatives."
Getting this new factory up and running early is GREAT news. Much needed.
"Irbt is no “meme stock” ...numerous patents, very profitable, minimal debt and half a billion in cash with double digit revenue growth ...I’ll take those metrics over some 1000 PE meme stock"
How is this trading at less than $100. Forward PE is approaching 10. This used to sell in a PE range of 22-25.
are revenues reported today?
"Going to initiate a new position of about 10k next week. I’m a big fan of the genius platform and think it has incredible potential to keep customers happy. Irobot is a leader and continues to stay that way. Would like to see the excess capital invested into more growth initiatives or returned to shareholders. In any case, this is a business that will be around for the long haul and they have proved that. Plan to be a holder for a minimum of ten years and maybe longer. Home robotics have been slow to take off, but they are reaching their breakout moment. Incredible 76% revenue growth. Driven by the purchase of premium robots, this company will continue to lead the way forward in this segment of the market. If customers are kept happy, irobot has massive growth potential. I trust the management to do that."
"What a discount buy, thanks"
When is the Terra robot coming out?
the low for this stock could be for ever a nice round $44.00(but could be up more than 200% shortly)

"I just don’t understand how a company with these fundamentals — earnings growth, little debt, and a leader in their industry — trades at such low multiples in regards to SP. Is there something keeping this down? Perhaps a barrier for further growth? The competition is good, not going to lie, but I haven’t really seen any reviews that don’t say that the Roomba S9+ or i7+ is the best home robot money can buy. All I know is, if Colin and co ever get the Roomba to climb stairs I’ll be a millionaire."

Blackrock inc. invested 4.4M shares (exceeds 5% of common stock) reported on 2/3/20 by SEC form 13G (13d-1(b)
So undervalued. Is the company buying back stock? Seems like a takeover target at these levels.
I am going to be up to buy in this. All great news with repurchasing stocks and overall nothing but positive news. Def is a buy
Curious as to why the PE ratio is so low on this. Any thoughts??

Why isn’t this at $120+ or at least close to fair value.

Companies do not lose 1/4 of their value on an insignificant miss on a Q1 Revenue number that didn't even come form the company. It came from ""an average of analysts"", some of whom may be involved in the short-selling. This needs to to be looked into."

"IRBT is in ‘buy the dip’ mode now with earnings and guidance confirming a profitable future. Growing top line at the current pace must be rewarded at some point. The fundamentals are solid and yet the market is trading this as if there is an earnings issue. The lawnmower headline will be a major adjustment to revenue at some point, but just the fact that another accelerant to revenue growth is out there should propel the pps - especially after stellar earnings. The doom-n-gloom analyst’s bs that oversold IRBT last year was never an accurate assessment of the company."

"Looks like the company has already reduced prices across the board as a result of the tariff exemption and the ability to give its customers what it was once giving the treasury.So, it appears that pricing flexibility is back and that is a big deal, especially with new products coming. It's been a full year since the company was shackled and now the old ball and chain is cut off and it is, once again, free to run (sorry).Interestingly, the entry-level Roomba 675 has been sitting at the top of Amazon's Robotic Vacuums since the tariff exemption. I like to look at the entire Vacuums category here and, also, the broad Home and Kitchen category because it is there that you can see who's really moving product. This category has a huge number of $4.99 items so if you're highly ranked here you're moving product. So, the difference between #1 and #2 in ""Robotic Vacuums"" may be a large difference in actual volume.So, the 675 ($219) is right now (8:30 PST) sitting at #156 in Home & Kitchen (which is impressive). The next bot is the entry-level Eufy ($179) but it sits at #414 in Home &Kitchen. So, the volume differences between the two is going to be substantial. It's important to remember that Mr. Angle cited the tariffs as a material barrier to moving product at the low-end, especially at Christmas, as the tariffs were letting the bottom dweller toy makers severely undercut the company. That no longer appears to be the case.This is very important not only for short-term revenue but because IRobot dominates the high-end (with that domination continuously increasing) and it's very important to get new customers to the brand early, at the entry level.As the saying goes, ""all that and a dime will get you a cup of coffee."" (Obviously an old saying)."

"During all this the company is still doin' it. For many months prior IRobot got down to approximately (4) of its products in Amazon's Top 10 for Robotic Vacuums (including mops). Prior to that it had reliably been (5) or (6) in the Top 10.Since this COVID it has been solidly in the (6) to (8) products range and pretty well controls the ""anything over $300"" category. Even the S9+ seems to have worked its way into the Top 10 consistently at $1,100.Since the COVID, the cleaning solution for the mops has been out of stock with availability shown as mid April. It would be really helpful for everyone if the company could add a couple of elements to the solution to make it a true ""disinfectant"" and not just a ""cleaner"". Could even offer it at a discounted price. Anyway, they're still doin' it and could really help in all this with its current and future products.Keep it tight, everybody, and God Bless you."
"OK know I see..""HONG KONG -- iRobot has broken off ties with the Hong Kong company which for years helped develop and produce the robotic vacuum Roomba in the latest fallout from the U.S.-China trade conflict.Without mentioning iRobot by name, Kin Yat Holdings said in a premarket exchange filing Tuesday that a ""significant customer... which is a leading American technology company specializing in robotic floor care products"" was ending its service contract, noting the customer accounted for 55% of total revenues for the year ended March 2020.Kin Yat said the termination stemmed from its client's desire for more geographic diversification of production and rising production costs in China, where Kin Yat's factories are concentrated. Kin Yat shares then tumbled on the Hong Kong exchange, ending down 16.9% at 94 Hong Kong cents.iRobot has been shifting production gradually out from China amid rising tensions between Washington and Beijing.""Our plan is to substantially increase our production in Malaysia over the course of this year,"" Julie Zeiler, executive vice president and chief financial officer, told analysts during a results call in February. ""By the end of 2021, we estimate that Malaysia manufacturing will have sufficient capacity in place to support the vast majority of our 2022 North American volume requirements.""By making this shift, the company said in its annual report also released in February, ""we believe that we will substantially reduce and potentially eliminate our exposure to current U.S. tariffs, and mitigate the geopolitical risks associated with concentrating production solely in China.""In her comments, Zeiler noted that Washington had reinstated a 25% tariff on Roombas imported from China at the start of the year, which she said would increase the company's costs this year by $41 million to $43 million.iRobot's reference to geopolitical risks suggests security may have factored into its production shift amid worries in the U.S. and allied nations about the possibility of China-made gadgets being used to covertly transmit sensitive data.Nikkei reported on Tuesday that NTT, Japan's largest telecom carrier, has started to restrict the use of drones made by China's DJI, which has already been blacklisted by the U.S. government.China's O-Film Group last week reported a net loss for 2020 of 1.94 billion yuan ($300 million) as a result of one-off charges from the loss of contracts producing iPhone camera and touch module components. The company was added to another U.S. blacklist last year in relation to alleged involvement in human rights abuses toward the China's Uyghur Muslim minority.According to iRobot's website, Roomba production also involves factories in southern China run by three other companies: BYD, better known for its electric vehicles; Hong Kong's Simatelex Manufactory; and U.S.-based Jabil. iRobot's annual report mentioned that one of the partners had started production in Malaysia in 2019.Kin Yat has itself been expanding to Malaysia. Its annual report noted the relocation of motor production there from China for an unnamed Korean customer and said it would look at increasing its presence in Southeast Asia, including possibly Myanmar, ""with a view to reducing the adverse impact of the Sino-U.S. trade dispute.""Cheng Chor-kit, Kin Yat's founding chairman and chief executive, said in November the company would also ""continue to diversity its customer portfolio to reduce its concentration risk, particularly to develop clientele in some other countries and high-potential markets outside of the Sino-U.S. trade disputes.""Based on figures from Kin Yat's disclosure Tuesday, its reliance on iRobot peaked in the year ended March 2019, when its key U.S. customer accounted for 65% of total revenue, or 2.66 billion Hong Kong dollars ($342.47 million). That fell to HK$1.7 billion the following year.Kin Yat, which began as a toymaker, started moving its production from Hong Kong into the adjacent mainland city of Shenzhen in 1985. According to its website, it began collaborating with iRobot on the development of the Roomba in 2007.""Contributing our manufacturing and technology expertise in this production partnership with iRobot, we have been delighted to witness very positive results since this consumer robot's market debut,"" the website says.While the company has been shifting some of its manufacturing operations further inland in China due to rising factory wages -- first to Shaoguan, which like Shenzhen is in Guangdong Province, then to the interior province of Guizhou -- high-value production has remained in Shenzhen."""

Wowser...35% of float is short as of 07/15?! Poised for a big move after ER tomorrow. I’m in.
Take it easy folks! It will go up again. Solid company with great management.
"Can anyone explain to me why it is necessary to allow the shorting of stocks? How does this add value? Statements like: ""Next week it will go down into the 20s"" are not informative or helpful. Since when has the stock market just become a place to bet whether a stock will go up or down. If you think a stock will go down, why is it not good enough just to sell your shares or just not buy shares? Stocks represent the manner in which we make possible the public ownership of companies. Stocks should not represent a bet. I so appreciate the honest investors who are here to help inform their investment. The rest should leave."
"Did you know, if they reduced R&D by just 10% that be an extra 60 cents on the bottom line to earnings.

I just dont see people being as hard on other companies in worse positions."
Can people not do math. There is a .41 adjustment for tax law. So earnings should be around .57. +54% Rev growth yoy
this stock may reach to 70 by the end of this week 
stock went public at $34 in 2005. only up $11 in 14 years with massive revenue and earnings growth? Mr. market has lost his marbles
I just listened to the Citi Conference where Colin A. confirmed he will be launching new product tomorrow at Disrupt SF Conference! Stay tuned guys.
Price history: they report earnings. Stock plummets 10% and then recovers losses in the next two days and is making higher highs. Great balance sheet plus short float at 80+%. I think we march on over to $90. Might want to consider getting in before we see $90.
"The stock market is clearly manipulated. And individual investors do not move the market. Clearly it is a combination of crooked and incompetent analysts along with crooked and incompetent fund managers. IRBT is just one example of this. A brief look at recent history is sufficient. Trump told all that he was going to put China tariffs in place. In Jul 2018, he initiated 25% tariffs on $50Bil of imports. In Sep 2018, he put 10% tariffs on an additional $200Bil of imports. Everyone saw this happening, with an expectation that it wasn't going away anytime soon. In fact, they fully knew that an additional 15% tariff was coming on that $200Bil worth of goods. These goods of course included IRBT vacuums which are produced in China. And that additional 15% came in May 2019. But in Apr 2019, IRBT stock was up to $130 per share. When tariffs had been put in place and more were threatened. Since then the stock has been on a slide down to $40. The reason for the decrease in said to be tariffs. The same tariffs that everyone knew about in April of this year when the stock reached its high. The market competition was also well known early in 2019, certainly before April. Now, the reason for the decrease is said to be competition (Shark, etc.). But you can see in the recent legal case that if Shark would have been making a comparable technical product, they would have had to remove it from the shelves. Instead they had to admit that their vacuum is not comparable and they are guilty of false advertising. Still the market says that this is one of the reasons for the $40 price. Nothing has changed about the competition since the IRBT price was $130. This is just incompetence combined with pure stock manipulation. Just look at the change in price and the stated reasons. Look at the lawsuits and the stated reasons. But this is the market we live in. When others are fearful, you must be brave. Tariffs will end. Consumers will compare products and IRBT will win. New products are coming in markets larger than vacuums. You decide."

"I’m glad everyone on this board is baffled just like me, I thought I was going crazy seeing the company beat and raised EPS and still dropping. But eventually the machines will let up right?"
To any and all shorts out there. I am curious at what price you would be willing to close your position. What economic or company specific factors are you waiting for in order to have a turnaround? To me at this valuation this stock is an obvious buy over a long time horizon. Just looking for someone with a good argument why it will continue to drop...
"2019 Plan called for $1.28 to $1.31 billion and now $1.2, Op Income was supposed to be $108-118MM and now at $75-80MM and EPS was planned at $3 to $3.25 and now $2.60 to $2.80. Since January 1st stock has now cut itself in half in AH $85 to $42. Stock hit $128 in the interim on April 16th (which we see was too high given the tariff environment).So, the company is off its plan which is concerning for a growth company but a 25% tariff on each and every one of your products will do that. Last year Colin Angle said the company was at an ""inflection point"" and that seemed accurate. In the company's application for an exemption to the tariffs this year it also said ""we are in a period where winners and losers will be determined"". Worldwide demand for RVC's seems to remain robust enough. The big question, then, is did the tariff headwinds hold this company down long enough for competitors to kill it? Well, there are a lot of Chinese bottom dwellers selling cheap plastic and they have never been a threat. Hoover and Dyson have both tried and been disposed of in the marketplace and in court. Shark made a recent attempt and may well suffer the same fate. Who's left? The company continues to have the only (non patent infringing) self-emptying vac on the market. It's the only company manufacturing true wet floor care bots. It is certainly the only one that has the vac and wet bots talking to each other as team members. Further, this company is the only one that is gonna make these products truly better with its research and new tech. So, everything appears in tact. Will the company bounce back once 1) tariffs are removed (maybe APEC in Chile Nov 16-17 or 2) Malaysia comes on line in January. It would give the company its pricing flexibility back. It seems the answer is in international markets which are not under tariff and, here, Irobot is CRUSHING...worldwide.So, my opinion is the everything is in tact and that it will roar back once the tariff issue is resolved through either govt. action or manufacturing diversity in January. Until then, this is a small company and a lightly traded stock and is going to have WILD swings due, largely, to manipulation. Could it be $100 or higher by late 2020? I would expect that it might. Keep your powder dry."
"What's stopping this company from making séx robots for commercial use? Like bars, streets, gas stations?"
They better be buying back now.
"OK, so everything depends on your investing strategy. I don't believe this stock will go much below its current price. I would sell today if I thought this was a likely outcome. But if I'm wrong and it does, this definitely presents a buying opportunity. This is a long term investment for me. I believe in 2022 or 2023 with Robot taking at least 50-70% of the robotic lawn mower market (like they did with the robotic vacuum cleaner business), this stock could go to $300 per share. This is the upside."
This company will make me rich. This will have a market cap of 10 billion in some years
"So riddle me this...how is it that Amazon is going to manufacture a robot when they do not have the 1. manufacturing, 2.technology patents. Won't happen...and if it does the product won't compete."
"cash position is up, still no debt, shares bought back at 37. decent .. cost-cutting measures, tariff exemptions.. I'm satisfied :):)"
Going up on real buying. Investors are shifting out of leisure and gaming stocks and buying up cleaning and tech companies. IRBT is perfectly positioned as a profitable long hold IMHO.
"Roomba robots occupied 8 of the top 10 best-selling RVC models in the U.S., 6of the top 10 in EMEA and 9 of the top 10 in Japan."
"Things are looking good for IRBT and sales appear to be doing well. Margins may be compressed but regaining Market Share is key to regaining growth. Based on the Amazon news, it looks like the entry level Roomba is selling well. That will afford future upselling opportunities.We won't know the results of Q4 until early February, but so far so good."

"Nice rally on China news. I established a beachhead position at $45 and will add much more, I expect it may go to new lows before 12/31 due to tax loss selling. I will be buying heavily if it does, expecting to see $50 in January and $80 by end of 2020. The fact that the new Roombas have software that can be updated is huge, and the mop and lawnmower will greatly expand the total market. When the tariff issue is resolved, $100+ is possible."
"It's been fun following irbt over the past few years. I believe in the short term over the next 6~12 months irbt can fluctuate between $105 ~ $130 and more towards the upper end with some Q1 & Q2 earnings beats. It won't be until longer term 2022~2025 until home robotics really get mainstream. As the CEO mentioned robotic vacuum household penetration is only around 10% levels. Those that are pessimistic or critical of irbt were right to be worried as more and more competitors came into the markets in 2015~2018 however by now if competition were to really be a threat it should have done so by now with heavy losses for irbt in market share to competitors. If anything irbt has made vacuuming even more automated to where the larger manual push vacuums will soon become replaced as the technology, capability, and price of RVCs gets better and better.So the three major drivers 1) Roomba household penetration upwards of 20% by 2022 2) Growing revenue streams into new products like the robot lawn mower, growing into mopping robots, and other new product categories 3) Global reach and growth into Europe, Asia, and the rest of the Americas it's not unrealistic for irbt to become a $12 Billion dollar company in market cap. IRBT is currently a $3.4 B dollar company so there is still 3x growth potential within in the next 4~5 years. I would not be surprised to see irbt get up into the EPS of $10 per share x 40x PE = $400 per share price or a larger tech company making an acquisition deal."
"This little company keeps getting tossed on waves from all points of the compass but keeps sailing on. Love it.On the call, Colin confirms a new Roomba before the end of the year and says it has remained on schedule despite most working from home. I have to think it's a significant hardware development of some sort. There is one development that would BURY competitors. IRobot has done it in the past with other robots. We shall see."
"https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/IRBT/irobot/revenueThis is all you have to know. We are growing, so will the stock price."
Maybe some good news to come out of two upcoming Investor conferences. Need a boost as SP has been languishing.
"Also from the call, expectation of the tariff exclusion being extended 1 year from the current August 2020 expiration."
"I agree completely with Checkmate's comments about Yahoo publishing every class action suit.. But I believe there is so much about the market that is stacked against the average investor. Not only can the shorts file suit for a couple hundred dollars and help drive down the stock price, but in addition analysts can get their clients out, downgrade a stock, then later get their clients back in and upgrade the stock. I believe to a certain extent the market itself is corrupt in the short term. However, they cannot change the long term performance of a stock. This is the salvation of the long term investor - the truths of market attractiveness and the company's competitive advantage will win out. Try to calculate the market growth along with the possible sales and financials of the company over the next 5 years, not the next 3 months. Be diligent and truthful to yourself and you will see above average returns over the long term - just like Peter Lynch. If you do not believe in the future growth of consumer robotics and iRobot's competitive technology position - get out now. Otherwise, invest carefully and for the long term in the company and stay in until the strategic story changes dramatically."
I started buying IRBT at 85$ ... even then I thought IRBT intrinsic value was around 75. So you know the story. I’ve been doubling down with each new low and now have 50% of my portfolio in IRBT. Not a very comfortable place to be but not willing to take a loss. What would you do ?
TSLA misses both revenue and earning and the stocks is down only few bucks. IRBT misses revenue and the stock is down 30 bucks. What's happening here.....SEC take notice
"Just bought two Roomba i7s bundled with Automatic Dirt Removal from Bed Bath and Beyond on sale for $699 compared to Amazon price of $899 and suggested retail of $999. This Roomba is 10X as powerful as our old 960 and quieter and with room identification, and automatic dirt dumping, etc. Our kids have old Roombas which they will keep to clean upstairs floors. I would consider us a normal family and not be surprised if we will be seeing this consumer behavior coming up. We all have wood floors and also need the Braava mopping soon as possible. I also will purchase a Terra Robot lawnmower soon after it becomes available. I all cases, there is no competition. Consumers who buy the Shark products are just simply uninformed. There is no comparison. You can buy iRobot cleaners at any budget, from top to bottom. Shark and company continue to misrepresent their products in their advertising and then pay individuals for high ratings on websites like Amazon. This will eventually end. IRobot has the best products for the money and all the moat they need for protection. I am a long term buyer of this stock and the products. I know and defend this company, not as some ignorant investor but as a knowledgeable consumer. This is so Peter Lynch."

"Let's review. The company does not sell to China in any significant volume (as no U.S. company does after the Chinese figure out how to make a cheap knock-off). It manufactures in China so that tariffs impact the U.S. segment of its revenue (45% of total). Its growth trajectory here has been moderately restrained due to the price increases this has necessitated. However, its IP moat and product generation remain as robust as ever. It's the only company is the space that has robots that empty themselves and that work together. It also is the only one with significant consumables sales (cleaning solution, wet/dry pads, bags, etc.)...and so forth.Stock has lost more than 1/2 it's value in the 52 week range. It's P/E Ratio is now 21 versus S&P index ratio of 22 and Dow or 19. It's being priced like the maker of nondescript grain cereal or doorstops. The revenue from the Braava Jet cleaning solution alone commands a higher price than $65 (small exaggeration).There is no longer any logic underpinning the valuation of this stock and, as a result, no foreseeable bottom. Maybe we get into the $30's...$20's. It's impossible to tell because there is no rhyme or reason. I've owned the stock for a long time but I have to admit there is a part of me that wants to see it drop to $15 just for the sheer spectacle of it."
"Imagine, they won‘t get their chips for the crucial Christmas quarter quarter…"
"Are manufacturing factories planned to moved to Vietnam, Philippines or Malaysia? It is a great company with double digit growth rate and beating earning reports last 6 quarters.Investors are too fickle minded and too worried about growth. If trade war lingers, they will definitely diversifying manufacturing hubs to other countries. Sales side should be OK, it be affected similar to other consumer tech companies. IRBT's price action is ridiculous. However, it is also a great buying point, considering all sorts of negative outcomes are priced in and oversold in huge way."
They got the exclusion through 12/31/2020...check out the USTR website for the announcement.
"This company has grown and grown and grown year after year. Innovated new amazing products, and has navigated insane geopolitical environment. Over reaction, bought 300 shares at $90.65."
Q4 officially ended on 12/28. Over the next 5 weeks we'll be eagerly awaiting any updated news.IRBT has the hurdle of the large Amazon Q4 sales order that was moved up into Q3 results.I would like to see IRBT find a trading range that it can sustain for a few weeks.
someone should start a Facebook group for IRBT Share holders need to create some diamond hands here... like whos selling at under $90? whats your reasoning? is youre selling at 90 here tell me the stock you are buying and what thier value proposition is to value it more than irbt at 90?
so has everyone left this for dead? lol... still holding to 2024... :P
"Very cheap stock here everyone. With Tariffs being lifted, Malaysia production facility up and running and a continued increase in revenue this has nowhere to go but up near term. Should be around $75 without questions so there plenty of room to run. We need to break $50 first and continue to uptrend from there. Good luck, cheers!"
"sourced from q3 earnings report on investor relations page:The company made continued progress with its manufacturing diversification initiatives.Ahead of schedule for Malaysia facility, to be production ready in January 2020Why is this not getting the attention it deserves"
"This stock doesn’t get the love it deserves. They’re leading in an industry where the sky is the limit for growth and expansion.I understand the short term challenges posed by terrible trade policies, but they are diversifying their supply chains while still holding a commanding position in the home robotics market. As a long term investment, having this stock in your portfolio is like having Ford stock in 1915."
"Love it at this levels, if it drops more ill buy more "
I love this company. Buying in 50s.
"Interested to see more detail about this vision/roadmap for the smart home. By far the Roomba interms of ""smart home devices"" is the smartest excluding the google home/alexa/siri etc. which was a big mistake imo they should have built in those capabilities into the roomba... the advantage of roomba is that it gathers and interacts more with the household to gain much more data than alexa or google home could ever get. Lets see this road map..."
"We likely revisit the recent high of 96 seen before q3 earnings for the month leading up to earnings. That is another 10-15% up from current levels, adding to the great performance seen today. iRobot is not a very popular stock, but due to the ever increasing interest in smart technology (AI) by retail investors, it is only a matter of time before iRobot is ""discovered"" by the retail crowd. Due to 43% rev growth in Q3 with a YOY rev growth number in Q4 likely higher than seen in Q3, retail investors popularizing this stock would not be that surprising. Furthermore, it has experienced investor mania before, after Q4 2017 earnings, where the stock more than doubled in a few months. Volatility towards the upside (ATH reached in Feb of 2019) lasted until the China tariffs were announced. The China tariffs are not gone; however, they have been mitigated, and the scary headline of 25% tariffs will no longer scare away investors. The catalyst for making iRobot a popular stock again will likely come from revenue growth and commentary from the management team regarding acceleration in smart home technology adoption by consumers in Japan, the US, and EMEA. The investment in technology makes it easier for people to automate routine cleaning tasks or tell their smart assistant to have the robot clean a specific spot is a game-changer. Colin and his team saw this as an emerging need and did a great job investing in the infrastructure to build smarter robots that make the customer's life easier. Machine learning allows for the utility of robots to improve over time. Anybody can build the hardware, but iRobot is investing in the technology to make the robots even smarter. They are the leader in the industry, and management is doing an amazing job keeping them there. Q4 numbers are going to be really good and more than likely will provide guidance. A lot of those stimulus checks will be used to purchase items like what iRobot is selling. I would not be surprised at a 25% pop after earnings. And after that, I would expect a new run within the next year to revisit the ATH seen in Feb of 2019."
"bought 350 at avg of 60, sold 300 at 91, have 50 still...how low can this go? Whereis the growth coming from?...smart home?...terra? Is it a tech company or a consumer product company?"
check out mar 2020 12 calls. this is why the price is moving.
Any reason for the sudden jump? I don't see any news
"If you listen to the call, the inventory balance they have is Terra (the lawn mower). They just haven't launch it."
"IRBT is currently at 52 week low. I am considering selling 40 strike Put with expiration June 19th 2020. What is the chance we will see prices below $40 (and below $35) per share? To me it seems like a slam dunk with a company with cash on hand, that makes money and have no debt! However, there is of course a reason for the expected drop in profit due to Shark. My only fear is that it COULD be like GoPro. I would love to hear your inputs on this - I do see a lot of positive comment on this board. Thanks a lot in advance!"
"Colin Angle in the Q2, 2021 call: ""Our confidence in our strategic direction and our ability to achieve our ambitions over the next several years is underscored by our upcoming plans to execute a $100 million accelerated share repurchase agreement. We will share greater insight into our business later this year when we host a Virtual Investor Day event. In addition to highlighting our vision and strategy, our leadership team plans to share greater insight into the many exciting initiatives that will underpin an updated set of long-term financial targets. Stay tuned for more details on this event."""
"Congrats to all the irbt Longs who waited since like April of last year for a good quarter, looks like our patience is starting to be rewarded, when irbt goes up, it goes up fast lol"
"At some point the US Administration would be coming out strong against China. There needs to be no emotion attached to this as it was inevitable whether you are pro or con this administration. This will be multilateral, it already is and will continue to be as the globe comes out of lockdown in regards to China. Questions will be asked.Better to have a market correction now after a steep climb.Of note:""The U.S. Commerce Department, State and other agencies are looking for ways to push companies to move both sourcing and manufacturing out of China. Tax incentives and potential re-shoring subsidies are among measures being considered to spur changes"" the current and former officials told Reuters.They are now in Malaysia and can further aggressively pursue their manufacturing footprint there.Tariff exemption is all the more timely considering Trump's Tariff comments last night. Perhaps the heavy investment plan quoted on the earnings report could potentially allude to both software AND a more prominent manufacturing move into Malaysia and perhaps the USA/Europe this year."
Amazon’s new home robot…https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/why-amazon-built-a-home-robot/amp/
"Does anybody know when is the IRBT investor day scheduled that the CFO talked about in the Q2, 2021 earnings call? Thanks."
"Amazing how sentiments change in such a short period of time. All longs (including me) witnessed this getting slaughtered on good earnings report for past 3 times. Great if you guys picked up when it hit 50s,60s and 70s. I did. I also feel management did better job recently voicing their confidence in the company and put money where their mouth was (bought back $50 million worth of company stocks in its 60s). Every metric of this company is undervalued considering what is on the horizon for them. Some will argue their P/E does not make sense. I would counter that with the fact 20%+ growth for next decade, no debt, very profitable business (GP - 50%+), short ratio more than 50%. Moreover, all the hype about Dyson and other competitors have almost vanished. Going into the holiday season, this looks to hit $150 by EOY."
Most excellent recovery from the post/ pre market Roller coaster and holding stong with the weight a million monkey shorters on it's back. This stock has great legs under it.
So many new buyers and sellers that bought low 40’s taking profit. When it all shakes out we run through fifties into earnings. A good call brings us into the 60’s+.
"Shorted stocks were approx 9.2M a week ago. There has been a 15% increase from the 9.2M in the short position since then.In addition, I would really like to know what exactly the 'Business Arrangement' is with Ecovacs Robotics. If in fact this is true?"
"They just upgraded the guidance on q2. Looks like they will have almost 50% more revenue than expected. Was up over 8 points in premarket. The market opening lower will pull it back, im guessing, but this is really good news."
"Guys, this the 3rd time I made this comment as for some reason it got deleted. Does Yahoo sell the Admin for IRBT thread/ forum to Shorts? Be careful of what you read here including my comment. All and even the ones pretending to be Bulls are Shorts. They want you to think short term, and have second thoughts of your current positions so you may sell now or soon, and they can cover their shorts at low price. ~50% of float are shorted/ borrowed and regardless of the condition of the company the Shorts will need to buy mountain of shares soon. Remember, robotics is the future and IRBT is no. 1 on the market and they are expanding further. Hold your shares for the next 10 years, and no question if will be a fortune. hold your shares tight."
IRBT moving up last few days with low volume. Intriguing. Any idea why?
Yo this is squeeze ready
"Can't post the link but ""Everything Money"" on YT had an interesting take on IRBT."
"Man, I still don't get why IRBT lags!! I believe it's just a question of time..."
A company with a history of growing and another thing that’s very important: spending big money on R&D. Statistics show that companies who spend more on this do better!
Anybody knows whether IROBOT tried earlier to offer to be a platform for professional cleaners?After introduction of the I7+ and S7+ the technology seems to be mature enough to be used by professional cleaners (as an addition). I could image that Irobot would develop an special app +platform for this. So that cleaners can make schedules (and forbidden zones). Irobot could sell more robots and create an extra income stream (from licences for the platform and services fees)
I own many shares ...please to all those saying this stock is going to “explode” within the next few months ...how does this stock “explode” without a tariff reduction ? Is it the 2020 $40m gash in the bottom line ? The couple dozen lawsuits outstanding ? The first round loss to “Shark”? Love to be convinced
at the end fundamentals always win
"I am currently projecting the following. Tariffs: 2019 Partial, 2020 Full, 2021 None. Sales Growth: 2019 10%, 2020 12%, 2021 25% (Includes very limited effects of lawn mower in 2021). Earnings: 2019 $2.68 , 2020 $2.08, 2021 $5.95. Stock Price based on 20PE and 1.3 PEG: 2020 $53.98, 2021 $154.73."
Basically all the downside is priced into IRBT already. doing great relative to the market today.
"Not enough volume for all shorts to be out of their trade. They need shares in this range desperately, but that earnings rocked their world. It was unfortunate that the large short position was so unaware of the company’s cash and eps. I would tell them to hang in there, and maybe do some more research next time."
Feb 5th will be the only thing that matters. Q4 earnings and the 2020 forecast.
"Looks like tariff exemption was granted April 22nd.https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/enforcement/301Investigations/%24200_Billion_Exclusions_Granted_April_2020.pdf62) Robotic vacuum cleaners designed for residential use, each with a self-containedelectric motor of a power not exceeding 50 W and dust bag/receptacle capacity notexceeding 1 L, whether or not shipped with accessories (described in statisticalreporting number 8508.11.0000)"
Initial reaction on earnings miss was overblown. Guidance and additional $100M buyback are key and as absorbed moving SP back up.
"$IRBT #mosthated “When everyone agrees with you when you make a decision, you get paid linearly. When everyone agrees with you after the fact, you get paid exponentially.” …"
"Most important technical indicators are looking bullish, needs to break thru $50 -$51 resistance levels."
"Some bean-counters never can never see beyond their accounting 101 books and chant learned dogma like """" Inventory increase"""" ...well yes they are building the robotic lawn mower and sales have not really started yet, so yes inventory and parts have increased. Furthermore, the company issued new guidance for fiscal 2019, predicting it will book just under $1.3 billion in sales this year (about 18% more than last year) with earnings of $3 to $3.25 per share. ,In what CEO Colin Angle described as ""a phenomenal finish to 2018,"" iRobot reported 24% sales growth in its robots, thanks in part to the company's decision to ""absorb"" the effects of President Trump's 10% tariff on robots imported from China -- keeping its prices low enough to attract buyers in the crucial holiday sales season. Despite these tariffs, iRobot managed to report an operating profit margin of ""nearly 10%,"" with the result that per-share profits soared 450% to $0.88 (for the quarter) and 73% to $3.07 (for the year)."
"Touch less iRobot Roomba s9+ is sold out on amazon, best buy and irobot’s website. This confirms the thesis that it is a pandemic stay at home play."
"lol ok so down 16% on no report... so this proves the theory, report or no report it dives 20%"
Wat agreat buying day 
"Been an investor here for over a year now, in around $40 initially and added during March lows and on the way up. Just purchased a roomba vacuum and I must say they are very cool. Will definitely be confident in purchasing future products in a year or two. Love this balance sheet, love this stock. 100+ by year end wouldn’t surprise me. Also, anyone see the roomba deals on Amazon Prime day? You telling me you don’t think tons of people bought a robot vacuum for $199?? Get out of town. Those numbers will be reflected in next Q results."
Any idea why the weakness today. Can find no news and volume is weak so doesn't seem to be a fund dumping a lot. But this is a pretty extreme move down when most of market is green and no corresponding news. Any tax selling would have been done last year. Just don't get it
Have a feeling it will open green tomorrow. Over reaction for nothing. Don’t mind picking up some cheap tickets in 60s or 70
Here's hoping during the CC later this month we hear at least one of the below:* Launch of Terra this year* Acquisition of another Co* Malaysia Operations are now ahead of schedule* Q1 was a bumper Sales Quarter similar to Q3/Q4 (Historically the Best Q's)Tail winds instead of head winds....Any thoughts on this board?
Exited. Still believe in company. However dead money as SP has been going no where. GLTA as this will probably rally now that I sold
"Ben Rose.Okay. And a question for, Colin. If you could share with us your vision longer term for the Roomba specifically as you look out over the next couple of years. Do you think the primary focus will continue to be on home cleaning exclusively or perhaps could we see some additional functionalities built into the Roomba as we see it today.Colin Angle.Certainly, the Company’s ambition extends beyond Floorcare and the role that the Roomba plays today in the home, while limited to right now vacuuming and then mopping with the Braava is also serving as a platform for us to gain the type of home understanding necessary to increase the sophistication of what we’re able to do in the home.As we’ve talked before, growth in AI is important growth in the awareness of what is going on in the home. So that AI can have the context required to succeed is really at the cutting edge of technology. And so we are on a long journey to build the robots that we were promised growing up as kids. I think we’re at a very exciting place where we’re starting to be able to understand the context to extend what we’re capable of doing. And the iRobot Genius Home Intelligence really is a very ambitious long-term commitment to building a home AI capable of doing very sophisticated work in the home.So it’s a – we’re just still at the beginning of the industry. We’re still at the beginning of what the smart home will evolve into and iRobot is very excited about the role we will play in the home in both delivering physical work, but also delivering the context required to have a home that understands the type of things, you want to have happen enabling your home, not just your robot to be a strong partner as you address the challenges of the increasingly complex role the home is being asked to play.Ben RoseOkay, thanks very much. It’s very helpful.Colin Angle.You’re welcome.(credit seeking alpha)"
"Tomorrow’s conference call script is posted on their website. I have to think there will be an accelerating upside move after the call. Nothing but good news and positive guidance. No telling what will occur during the q&a, but with results and forecasts like this, one can only think it will be filled with congratulations and be followed by upgrades and target increases. With a bunch of holds and modest targets currently in place, there’s plenty of room for the analysts to buy into the IRBT performance and meaningfully increase their targets."
"Did everyone miss the most critical portion of the IRBT announcement yesterday: ""Countering the challenging macroeconomic climate, iRobot has learned that its request for an exclusion for its Roomba robot vacuum products from Section 301 tariffs has advanced to ""stage 3"" of the exemption process. Stage 3 focuses on determining whether an exclusion would be administrable. The company views the progression of its exclusion request to stage 3 as an important milestone and a validation of its rationale for an exclusion."" So this means that IRBT has passed the most important Stage 2. This is the Substantive Review stage that determines whether the request for exclusion should be granted. Stage 3 is only a review with U.S. Customs and Border Protection to determine if they can administer the exclusion. This means that not only will IRBT be excluded from the 25% Tariff shortly, but their competitors will not, because they have no exclusion. Wake up!"
I see 4 consecutive quarterly beats. Why should it be any different this Q? Just trying to figure out why the incredibly high short interest. Any ideas appreciated.
"I love the Optimism on this board but let’s be realistic. We’ll get there but it will take a little time.When the short squeeze hits, we’ll know it. There will be a price jump on heavy Volume. It will be at least 3 times the current daily average of 1.5M.On the Technical side, closing above $50 was nice but volume was below average. We will get some pullbacks. $52 is the technical hurdle that IRBT needs to get past on strong Volume. If we get past $52, we have a path to $59. Of course, there will be some pullbacks along the way. The good news is that we’re headed in the right direction. I’d welcome some pullbacks to acquire additional shares."
wow short interest is crazy high
"Let's take a moment to go back to the Original Plan for 2019, given in January of last year, before tariffs and ""increased competition"" at lower price points...so, before the craziness. The Plan numbers for the full year 2019 were: $1.28-1.31B for Revenue, $108 to $118M for Op. Inc. and $3.00-$3.25 for EPS. The Actual full year 2019 for those parameters were: Revenue of $1.214 (off 5% from low end of planned range), Op. Inc. $86.6 (with stated tariff impact of $37.9) and EPS of $2.97 per share (right there on the low end of the planned range). If we add the $37.9 million back to the Op. Inc. we get $124.50 million (beating the high end of the planned range). To me, that says despite the tariffs and the resulting price adjustments that were ultimately put into place, everything is still proceeding apace for the long term. The demand is still very strong in the categories and IRobot is still the 800 lb gorilla (and getting bigger and stronger and more differentiated every day). As to the tariffs, that's lost money but these may have resulted in much improved patent protection in the Phase 1 deal which, in the end, will crush the short-term cash impact of the tariffs themselves. Also, this got the company to diversify its manufacturing base (to Malaysia) and that is healthy in any environment. Further, a number of factors have quickly eroded any leverage that China has and they may become much more malleable vis a via a deal beyond Phase 1. We'll see...A word about the ""increased competition"", some still seem worried about the Shark ""Self Empty"" product. This is a flimsy knock-off that works not at all. It does almost nothing it purports to do, as the legitimate reviews have told. The Best Buys in my area isn't even displaying it any longer. This has turned out to be nothing more than a commercial for the i7+. Roborock and the other Lidar bots are sure to attempt a self-empty product soon but IRobot continues to differentiate through connected wet floor bots and the new IFTT deal and etc...always innovating. There is no real innovation by any other would-be competitor.I think the company is sand bagging a little with the 2020 Plan numbers and that these should be easily beaten even without an unexpected product or break out of some sort.Those are the thoughts of an old noodle head. God Bless party people!Let's see what happens...should be fun.I'll wrap this up by saying"
"So I read the transcript for the conf call, and the lack off holding gains may be due to the comments about many challenges for the first half of 2020. Guidance showing a decrease in Q1 revenue, and overall lower guidance on bottom line earnings for the full year. They are saying this is a transition year, ramping up production in Malaysia and other investments, to have a blowout 2021.This is all assuming that tarrifs remain in place for all of 2020. If those get dropped at any point, or if they are successful with their exemption, this should see some nice movement this year.Unfortunately it might look like we are set up for some more waiting...."
"“iRobot management told investors earlier this year that growth rates would be highest in the second and fourth quarters because of the timing of new product introductions. And during this quarter's subsequent conference call, iRobot insisted its first-quarter growth was in line with its own expectations -- helped by strong demand for its high-end Roomba's despite recent price increases to offset the impact of tariffs -- and reiterated full-year guidance for 2019 revenue to increase roughly 17% to 20% from 2018.”"
"A fair value market cap of 5.56 billion including 10 % discount rate and with current cashflow plus growth of 10-15%/yr. - With a PE of 15 and because the company is debt free, that gives me a fair price of 160 dollars. I want margin of safety 25 % and that leaves me with a target price of 120 dollars. (It is currently trading around 100 dollars)."
What makes a 10/100 bagger? Consistently increasing revenues and share buybacks. Add consistent innovation fra this company and I no longer really care about temporary semi conductor shortages. Adding shares on bad news and compounding. - GL to all the longs
Great low price for those who missed last week - this may be the last opportunity to get this stock at a bargain! Huge value play!
$98 resistance due to market drop. I see $105-$110 after ER
"Management have stated they are going to initiate a $200 Million Share Buyback. Since the announcement put a conservative average price $40 per share gives you 5 Million shares bought back reducing outstanding shares to 22.87 Million. How would Wednesday Trading be affected should they announce on the conference call they have been successful in completing the program? I cannot see a reason to not be buying back throughout March.They are also predicting minus 40 million less revenue compared to 1st quarter 2019. Here's hoping the Tariff exemption is confirmed, passing the 200 MDA is enough to send the shorts scrambling for cover."
Awesome to hold a stock where your only hope of a gain is the next short squeeze.
This is a solid company not like some of the other hyped garage out there but they have gotten pushed up with all the short squeeze craze. I am waiting until after earnings and share price comes back down to reality to increase my position. I am expecting post earnings we get back down to around the $80 mark and start to see a more reasonable appreciation from there over the long term.
I too shall be buying more
"During the CC tomorrow morning I have a feeling that Colin will talk about avoiding the Tariffs through the new Malaysia production hub for 2 mins and barely touch upon what an achievement it has been.... Yet he will spend considerably more time tapering any prospective appetite for the co by going on and on and on for considerably more time about the current global chip shortage.Just saying.....That being said fingers crossed re any news on an acquisition, terra, other new products and a share buy back."
They crush earnings every time. Can someone tell ceo to write optimistic earnings call transcript. Why create doubts when stock is already down? Not good for shareholders and the company.
"If I were shorter, I would be really really worried.The IRBT daily share volume is so low. Basically no people want to sell at current price. If situation goes in opposite direction, where I can buy stock to cover the borrowed shares.It will take 14 days (at current daily trade volume) to cover all the short interest (5.8 million)."
"Technically, I have not seen a stock of a company with such strong financial position so low. At least since the minor crush last December. In fact, if IRBT can pull off 10% growth with 25% tariffs, I think it is definitely under valued and I consider adding here a substantial position. I can't seem to understand the recent drop relating to Trump comments. The new tarrifs have nothing to do with IRBT: They are already at the maximum of 25%... Yes, a trade war is a major concern for growth, but IRBT seem to be punished far more than other companies with the same relative risk. At least we know that just as it goes so quickly down, on any good news it goes up abruptly as well. We have seen recent climbs of over 70% in less than 3 months and I expect that with some good news on the trade war and new products released we will see a nice return. I wouldn't hold my breath, though. It might take a while..."
This Co were somewhat flat footed just prior to the trade tariffs and they had to adjust over a 2-3 year period. Important to note they did adjust and have diversified. The same can be said re the chip shortage but then this is a problem across many and all industries right now. It will be important to learn during the CC what the extra circa $100M went to pay for.... Finalize Malaysia? Big spend on Software perhaps?
"So, there's one new robot...J7+. Where's the second one?"
Strong support yesterday and we move to another positive close today. Certainty not out of the dark but yesterday’s support in 43 range and closing up after more trade rhetoric today is impressive.
Seems mainly positive to me? Am I missing something besides a minor miss on EPS?
"Entered today with 800 shares starting position at 47.60. What is everyone's average? I see a strong reversal here, Looked at book numbers, YoY, revenue and institutional ownership at near 98% of whole ownership."
"Max Levchin , the $PYPL paypal co-founder talks about consumer habits at CNBC!! 40 seconds into the clip he says that IRobot sales has DOUBLED !!!!!!! This is absolutely crazy info. Think we will be above $100 before summer is over. Think this will 3X within a year from current levels. Watch the clip and do your own due diligance! Youtube ”Max Levchin CNBC ” its a 5 minute 56 second long video posted april 9th."
"Amazing, what a cheap discount buy. Shorts will cover eventually"
"Ever since 2016 IRBT has been exceeding quarterly analyst expectations and with share prices mostly ranging from $50s up to $107. The P/E ratios have fluctuated from 30~50. I think IRBT will again exceed analyst estimates and should hit the upper range of $2.35 EPS and management will probably revise the EPS upwards to $2.45 as they have a history of under promising and over delivering. But for possible share price examples we'll use the $2.35P/E 30 x $2.35 = $70.5P/E 40 x $2.35 = $94P/E 50 x $2.35 = $117Analysts and investors are worried about competitors taking market share away from IRBT but I don't think the cheaper chinese brands that have flooded the market will have a sustained or long term impact. Just go read the Amazon reviews on Ecovacs, Eufy, and Shark ninja. Filter the verified purchases and look at the 1 & 2 star ratings. Most are customer complaints of product failing within 4~6 months. Sure they work well and clean at first but they don't hold up to iRobot quality and reliability. See you guys at the $100++ price."
"Whats stoping this company to make cleaning products for commercial use?Like shopping malls,streets and roads"
"Long way from $128. We're getting close to the price where i began acquiring shares many years ago. ""Do not wear yourself out to get rich; be wise enough to restrain yourself. When you glance at wealth, it disappears, for it makes wings for itself and flies like an eagle to the sky."" (Proverbs 23:4-5)I am continually amazed at how the Bible has it all. Maybe I should spend more time reading it and less time looking at the market."
"They handled tariffs better than the last call since they have a plan, but it will affect them:""The pressure brought to bear by rising labor costs, forced technology transfers and intellectual-property theft, coupled with the imposition of tariffs and potential for them to increase, has changed our view and accelerated our plan for supply chain and manufacturing diversification. This initiative is expected to negatively impact our gross margin in 2019, during the initial investment phase and 2020, when we start production, until we reach scale in the new facility as well as identify lower-cost component suppliers outside China.

Everyday i been looking at this stock and I wished I had more money to average down from my $70 entry point. Especially when it hit $55 I never even panicked
I have a feeling that shorts will get squeezed tomorrow after CC.
"iRobot Corp at Raymond James 2019 Technology Investors Conference 12/10/19 3:00 pm EST Questions to be answered:1) How were iRobot's sales during the holiday week? Ahead of forecasts, in-line or trailing?2) How were iRobot's margins on the sales?3) Did iRobot gain back lost market share due to the price reduction for the 25% tariff being absorbed?4) How did the Shark Ninja knockoff sell during the holiday week?5) Have the other competitors gained any market share on iRobot?6) How are negotiations for 2020 going with iRobot's suppliers?7) Is iRobot seeking additional revenue opportunities? (i.e. Commercial version of Roomba to hotels etc)"
"Listened to the call. Trying to negotiate longer contracts with existing suppliers to be ""the first in line"". This shortage is going to last for a while with the backlog probably still building. Giant players in several industries also trying to be ""first in line"". Really unclear how our little company is going to fare. We'll see.The $17 million orders sound like they're moving now so just timing and it doesn't sound like sell through has been impacted much yet by logistics or chip shortage. Holiday period will be the problem.Malaysia on track. Including tariff exemption based on broader legislation seems aggressive. However, Malaysia should make the point mute beginning in 2022.No one asked about the Shark ITC case to be heard at the end of the year but I assume it's still on track.My overriding concern was the two new Roombas and it sounds like these are still on track for the holiday period with chips/components prioritized and provided for and advertising/marketing allocated. Sounds big.Some have guessed these are LIDAR robots. I don't believe that's correct. IRobot chose VSLAM long ago and there is absolutely no reason to include LIDAR. They've made VSLAM work great (as our S9 attests). LIDAR would be duplicative and it's very expensive. It would increase the price substantially while adding no functionality. It's gotta be something else. Ben Rhodes from Battle Road asked Colin at the very end of the Q&A kind of what features make sense to include. Colin gave a great answer and said many times it's just ""adding stuff"" and unnecessary complexity. He's not a great salesman but he's got common sense and he wants to know what is useful to consumers and he gives them what they want. This is how you become dominant.I don't know what these new ones do but I'm sure interested. If it's substantially differentiating it would do a lot to put down these macro-level systemic headwinds.Stay tuned, boys!"
"Looking at the technical charts, short term (2-6 weeks) $58-$62 seems likely."
