I can’t believe I got in at 41!
"Envision is the leading of EV charging, government requires full clean energy charging and envision has it all and will be first option for EV infrastructure network *Solar day and night energy *All day light Adjustable panels trackers*High energy storage capacity *Flood proof ARC patent *Wireless charging patent *Fast charging performance *Solar tree any size to any place*Solar PV to replace gas station roof"
Wow!! This truly is great buying opportunity for Longs. Clean balance sheet and huge upside potential. Patience = profits.. Stock Up.
A good buy next dip $26.75 little over bought right nowput a bid in at 26.75
Remember even if you build a large capacity battery ( 1000 mpg ) you will still have to charge it! With their patents . Products and experience the EV industry and gasoline pump industry will drive BEEM to a value that you -well I really can’t imagine!
"lets be serious here guys. This company is set, all the numbers make sense and they are primed for this upcoming revolution. time will prove that you made a great investment."
Earnings out.https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/beam-global-reports-fiscal-2020-200500901.html
An analyst on TipRank has just raised his target for BEEM from $45 to $90! As I said we are just starting this rocket ride! Some smart people or ????? are buying and the light weights are trading! Look at today’s trading-opens $66+drops to $57 then closes to another high level!
Larry Jones said buy in January. Funny he hasn’t mentioned it since
don't give them your previous shares. DONT DO IT. What is happening is tried and true social science. we act in a predictable way and we are pushed this direction and that. Its a good company with a great future that has HUGE support. this #$%$ is in place to fleece us of our share of the pie.
All charging companies are up big today. People getting ready for infrastructure projects!?
"With such a small float, the cool product offering and the new contracts, I see this share price soaring here soon."
I can not fathom the amount of shares that are short! Any large orders or extraordinarily good news could send this stock up and I mean way way up!
One of the most shorted stock
"Creative promotion is a valuable asset -- so I applaud Beam's aircraft charging show. It seems like a lot of short hops and Beam's system is a slow way to charge batteries -- and someone had to truck systems to each airport. I continue to look for (but not see) larger orders of systems. The last we heard, there was $5 mm pipeline that was to be delivered in Q2 and Q3 -- this is not enough sales to support the current valuation, IMO."
Patience = Profits. Long Beem!
just read the news! this company keeps on delivering great things. I would recommend you too think about buying now on this level before big investors start adding this too there portfolio.
These days like this will really test your conviction as staying the course! Remember markets are NEVER wrong ; opinions often are! The weak and gutless are bailing out! Patience is the best game!
75 million in pipeline. 25 million increase in a single quarter.
"Warning: I just bought 250 shares of BEEM, and everything I buy tanks right after so y’all watchout "
After the fantastic news yesterday why is this down 6$ ? Anyone know
"I live in California and “envision solar”￼ now know as beem are putting these charging stations up every where. In the long term this company is extremely bullish with out a doubt in my mind due to the extreme increase in the demand of Evs, which will only raise in the up coming years. This company will most likely monopolize thought the US and hopefully internationally. ￼￼￼￼"
Hurricane in NORTH EAST OF AMERICA! Possible electric power outage? What are the corporate and government leaders waiting for? Electric cars need fuel! Beam Global has the answer.GO BEEM
"I have been a stockbroker and analyst for over 51 years! This company, EVSI, has a potential I believe to be as big as Tesla. Look at the fundamentals. Six million shares outstanding, no debt, three major patents and no competition. Look at the news and orders! Look at the articles on electric cars and the need for charging stations across this country and the world. Go to their website and see for yourself. I believe in 3 years revenue will jump from 2 million to 50 million. Once the lightweight traders are weeded out and the institutions start to lockup the float you will see exponential growth in the stock price and value!!"
Seem to be at an important juncture here. EVSI has turned out some decent sales. Made inroads at some new potentially significant customers based on press releases issued and upped the valuation by 50%.Management must now keep the pedal to the metal. No letting up. There is a window of opportunity for EVSI to make some significant improvements to its financials. It then becomes a drip in the bucket for larger player to just bolt the company on and plug the products into a broader based energy portfolio. Upside from higher revenue and the opportunity to cut OpEx.
"This is an excerpt from an article on Fox News regarding the Infrastructure bill. “ A bigger national network of charging stations is also seen as key to alleviating fears of range anxiety, or running out of charge on the highway.Providing those solutions will require balancing a long list of interests, from industry, political parties, unions, environmentalists, regulators and local governments, among others.""That’s a Rubik’s cube of complexity,"" said Larry Burns, a former GM executive and adviser to Alphabet Inc.’s self-driving affiliate Waymo. ""And this scale is massive. So we have to have collective will to make this happen."""
You might want to check out the Yahoo Finance S & P Global Market Intelligence report on overly short consumer companies. BEEM is mentioned. We may see some upside activity!
Beam will soon reach 100 dollars :)
Let’s do it
"New contracts and still sliding down, why??"
This might just be the most undervalued company on the board. Top notch ceo and board. I have no idea what some posters are talking about. The earnings report/conference call might have been the single best call I have ever been on. Monster orders are coming and the govt infrastructure bill calls for ev arcs. They never need cash again. They will file a shelf because all smart companies should have one on file. Desmond said on call he will only raise if it from a strategic partner that will be certain to add shareholder value. My gut tells me that when the stock gets to about $15-$20 they might use the shelf because they will use the cash to fund the massive purchase orders.
Here comes 0.31 !
Holding long waiting for the next update from EVSI. Can't imagine things aren't improving. Management needs to put up a few strong growth quarters so the stock can set $1 as the new floor. If not able to do that it is time for the Board to put new Management in the driver's seat.
"I just listened to the UBS Global Energy webcast with Beam Global‘a CEO D. Wheatley! Amazing information about this company and it’s future. Patents, leader in the charging stations industry. Patience is the best scenario!"
"The little plane is so cute, and the 20 minute airtime is a lot longer than Kitty Hawk but I believe the Solar Impulse plane flew around the world which is more impressive."
"Next year, revenue is expected to jump 265% to $21 million as the per-share loss falls dramatically to $0.20. In 2022, revenue continues growing to $35.5 million, and the company is projected to produce its first annual profit at $0.52 per share.By 2024, revenue is expected to reach $88 million – a 15X increase in just four years. it is expected to turn profitable and then grow the bottom line at a rapid pace. Earnings could be close to $3 per share by 2024.Blink Charging is another company that focuses on EV charging stations. Blink is valued at $357 million, reported $2.6 million in revenue last year, and is expected to bring in $7.1 million this year. The company probably won’t turn an annual profit until 2023, and a small one at that – $0.05 per share.Based on traditional valuation metrics, Blink trades at 25.2X forward sales. There is no P/E ratio until a company makes a profit, but based on 2024 earnings estimates of $0.20 per share, the stock is trading at 55X times that.Now back to Beam. If it were to trade at the same 25X forward sales, it would put the valuation at $529 million – nearly 7X its current size. And if Beam were to trade at 55 times 2024 earnings estimates, it would be a $150 stock, or 12.5X higher than current prices.If Beam can achieve those admittedly lofty goals in the next four years, the stock should be valued at 55X times earnings in 2024, if not more. That would give the company a valuation of about $1 billion, or 11X sales. Both are huge numbers, but they are also realistic for a company with such high growth in a niche trend"
"Just some food for thought. I want people to take a look at the link below NOT to promote or buy the stock BUT to understand how things or fortunes could change quickly in this environment. Ultra life Corp is about an indentical or comparable company as you get to Beem. In terms of it's stock & industry. As with Beem, this company has a VERY low float (Beem BTW is even lower), doesn't trade much and it's been under the radar of most for quite some time. Then BANG out of the blue, they get an enormous Gov't contract. A contract of that magnitude only reinforces the idea how Gov't will continue to work with great companies who provide excellent products & services which is in dire need. I STRONGLY believe it will happen in the same fashion for Beem also. As Beem has shown to be an invaluable, reliable partner for both local & State Gov'ts over the years. One day what happened to Ultra life, will be a reality for Beem Global also. Hold strong & stay patient folks, those are the only ingredients required here for s/h to profit greatly in the coming months.https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/ultralife-corporation-awarded-idiq-contract-200100651.html"
Slow and steady progress I think
District of Columbia Deploys First Beam Global EV ARC EV Charging System in Nation’s Capital
Could someone tell me what it would cost you to hook up to one of these devices and charge your car?
Time to reverse
"Every town in this country needs an electric vehicle charging station, Envision can install it by approaching the local government entity and offering free installation and then funding it by selling the advertising in the media they have built in the stations, super smart idea already in the works, go to their. website and read the presentation"
This is why BEEM will Winn the world infrastructure race https://www.concordia.ca/news/stories/2021/04/20/charging-thousands-of-electric-vehicles-simultaneously-will-be-a-big-challenge-for-cities-writes-concordia-researcher.html

"Well it appears to me that the price range I kept suggesting you wait before buying which is between $36 and $48, has a very good chance of hitting today. I would be accumulating while it’s in that range, I know many bought a bit prematurely, but those purchases should do fine in a matter of a short time."
"Buy dips, this company's buildout will be spreading across the US and internationally. JMHO"
"Desmond is better at generating orders than delivering units to customers. Production last quarter was 2-3 ARC units per week producing just over $2 mm of revenue for the quarter. Desmond told investors the current facility has the capacity to do $4mm per quarter. Is it running at this rate? How will the company deliver on $75 mm backlog if constrained to $4 mm per quarter? The answer -- find an equipment fabricator to contract manufacture the units. Meanwhile ChargePoint and Blink are doing land grabs on EV chargers, so Desmond needs to act fast. The next few years should be great from a percentage revenue growth perspective -- but if they keep selling the units at below cost, this will be risky. COmpanies like Bloom and Capstone sold equipment below cost (negative gross margin) for several years before getting to scale where they could get positive (but hardly great) margins. Beam has a sexy story, but ultimately ROIC matters. There are lots of ways to charge EVs and the ARC system is one alternative that fits a nice niche."
Other EV companies can only dream of a government contract. BEEM is going to at least 50 by the end of the year
"Apparently no real investor conviction in this one... this stock ebb and flows w/ the other junk EV stocks... Disappointing... But if the company is never gonna demonstrate production expansion or product evolution, she may be a one trick pony? Long but waning..."
28% enough down to jump in?
"As predicted short interest topped 2 million shares in the last half of March...Only 8 million in the float, institutions own 33%, and 25% short...Could get real hard real quick to find shares to cover..."

"Massive order from 1 county in California (Ventura). ITS STARTING! The flood gates are starting to open. Other customers will see and be motivated to get BEAM GLOBAL ‘s products! 10 X $50,000 = $500,000! Do the math. 10 more customers same order = $5,000,000. This will be opening the eyes of the future potential customers ( government, city, state and FEDERAL) . These Memes traders who are short will be destroyed!"
I have been wanting some stock in his company. two days dropping and I am collecting shares
"A little odd that after the news of being added to an index it tanks over 2. Nothing fundamental has changed but the volume allows for some ""manipulation."""
BEEM is a great company. Not only delivering great charging solutions but also investing alot in future innovations. As soon as bigger institutions starts too invest in this company we will see 3 digit numbers on the stock.
"Making all-electric, mobile, off-highway equipment viable is a complicated engineering proposition. One of the key building blocks of such an approach is devising a way to recharge the vehicles’ batteries. Using a diesel generator doesn’t make sense when one of the overarching goals of the all-electric concept is to come up with a greener approach with a minimal carbon footprint.https://www.hydraulicspneumatics.com/hydraulics-pneumatics-blogs/article/21138579/taking-solarpowered-recharging-to-the-work-site"
"Only 280M market cap... every country in the world need this products, they should have better marketing"
"I just listened to a UBS conference call forum on EV charging systems! This forum is week long line of unique products, companies and technology that will be able to deal with the tremendous growth of electric vehicles. I won’t give you the names of these companies because I do not wish to pan them. They all have one thing in common; c how to put power into a EV. , car, bus or truck. I want to know what the future is going to be for putting electric electric power in a EV. Truly there is a lot of creative delivery systems - pumps, plates, wireless etc, etc!! But and I do mean but what all these companies have to still do is connect with the Power grids; public or private companies and institutions. Tremendous potential costs for people, companies and governments!! Bottom line is and this is so important BEAM GLOBAL (BEEM) is the only one that does not need the grid! It is the best “GREEN “ power potential for the electric vehicle industry. It also has great potential for a power source that can be portable in unexpected disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes and firestorms!"
Officially in the R2k... momentum back and up through $40... nice exposure at Electric Mobility Symposium at Miramar...
Bought 50 more shares
Hi Guys anyone knows why Beem is down too much today?
"@ $26 it's late to get in , i just found out this company through YouTube ? Anyone inputs thanks How long to charge a USV DC or AC out put from solar arc ?"
Just upgraded to $21 strong buy (see link)Check out EVSI Analyst Price Target $21.00 on TipRanks http://www.tipranks.com/ios/pages/stocks/EVSI/price-target
"Wall St firms have been putting a noose around Beam Global's (BEEM) stock since December. Raising the requirement from 50% to 80-100%. This has pushed the price down by forcing accounts to cover maintenance calls to keep surplus at a required level. This policy keeps the rogue and day-traders at a minimum. These policies have dimmed the performance of BEEM. I suspect there maybe some coercion on the part of ""HedgeHog"" players who like to keep the public at bay and acquire stock. They also have been shorting BEEM to drive price down to where they can make huge profits from low entry levels. I also fear that a takeover of his company by a major player looking to cash in on the big future of EV industry. Using a shorting strategy can set their price offer at a lower price."
"We are under the radar right now. Once we are discovered by the general investing public (coupled with the upcoming revolution to electric vehicles, the building out of the EV infrastructure and EVSI’s very cool product offering), this share price is going to soar (especially given the small float). Could easily see a $500MM market cap or $75 per share by year end and maybe double that within a year from now. Buying stock on the back page before they show up on the front page in high growth companies is how you want to invest. Can't wait to watch this one soar!"
"I wish I knew this stock earlier. But Base on the volume, I think I was not too late yet. Thank god!!Low outstanding volume, big trends in 2020, good balance sheet, rebrand itself to target globally, no competition. Passionate leader. I just can’t see Beem would go down for few years. Seamless investment here."
"Time is the key. I won't need the money invested in BEEM stock for 10 years. Don't worry about dips except for buying more on such dips. Time....... Let this fishnet soak for years, and the catch with be spectacular in my humble opinion."
This is a hidden gem lads. Get ready for it to run to $80 when Biden works on the infrastructure bill

Pretty big short on this with a low float. Squeeze coming?
No news/videos came out of the flight event which could have been a massive marketing boost but nothing at all
"This company has been under the radar until now. Now there are two analyst price targets recently which will put this one on the radar for sure. Once this gem is discovered by the general investing public (coupled with the upcoming revolution to electric vehicles, the building out of the EV infrastructure and EVSI’s very unique product offering), this share price is going to fly (especially given the small float). Could easily see $30 per share by year end. As another poster said buying stock on the back page before they show up on the front page in high growth companies is how you want to invest. Probably an easy double from here in the near-term."
I thought it would touch 35 today
"Special toast tonight to the longs, especially the locals, from the OTC days. Wasn't there a reverse merger or something way back then?"
"Solar is up, EV is up. Expecting a green day!!"
The march towards $25 per share in the near term started yesterday...should be fun to watch.
Stocks are valued at the future valuation most of the time. You can’t tell me this in 5 years is worth 220M. Analysts are projecting 400M in revenue in only 5 years. I think this product has so much potential not only in the charging industry but the portable solar panels are already helping so much
I really really hope they get the manufacturing process scaled so they can mass produce these units and bring costs down. Every home in the country will end up having this.
"Isn’t it funny how Youtubers (Larry Jones and others) were pushing this when it was at $55, now they don’t mention it? How very strange (sarcasm intended)"
"BEEM will be a big beneficiary of the infrastructure spending and the company is not as wildly over-valued as many other green companies, but I am still believe companies have to earn a ROIC. Capstone and Westport have great products but have not been so great for investors."
"Should I hold, I got in at about $14"

"Just as a follow up to my post yesterday, this is my take going forward. As mentioned prior to earnings release, i didn't expect any surprises on the numbers on either the downside or upside. And this is ""almost"" exactly what we got with the report yesterday. With one exception of course, which had nothing to do with sales, earnings or the balanse sheet. So what was it? It's what was said in terms of the company going forward. Contracts, product development and their involvment with local & State Gov'ts. This is why the stock is up a few bucks today and not down. Big investment money sees the same thing i see or we see. Nothing but blue sky ahead.Like i mentioned previously, concenttrating soley on those earning numbers whould be a grave mistake by investors, for several reasons, one of the big ones being that this is PAST HISTORY for the company. As well as this being a brand new venture with many & large upfront R&D expenses. Anyone who denies this or brushes this fact aside in favor of focusing on ""great earning numbers"" is either not knowledgeable or completely cluess with regards to this sector.So with this earnings report out of the way and with what was said going forward with guidance & product development/status, i stand by my predictions of ~$200 per share sometime around mid year. I can't see anything that will derail this unless the economy crashes like in the 30's or a super large meteor hits the planet. Both of which i would say the odds are quite nil......for now."

Has anyone talked with the company to get an update? Where are we at with this offering? Has it been pulled?
nice!
"the day $BEEM goes over $100, I will quit my job"
"Sooner or later. Beem Will breakout. When it happens, the investors that bought the dips, will be grinning!"
"The next three months will open the doors of huge opportunities for Beam Global! AOC, Joe B.and Climate change elites will light this candle!"
When is everyone buying back in?
"usually when a stock like this goes down this much %, it has a huge green day after. $50 is the buy area."
"Prepping for a possible acquisition? Hmmm..... that would be very unexpected to say the least. At least for me anyway, not sure about anyonese else here. Would have definitely thought the complete opposite here and an eventual exit strategy by Mr. Wheatley at some point in the next 24 months. But it seems that Desmond might have some other plans here and intends to expand the company quite substanitally. Question would be what type of acquisition he intends to make? If he intends on staying on for the long haul and if i was in his shoes, i'd probably be looking to secure a large production facility able to produce Beem's entire productline with scalability AND that has it's own additional GREEN productline already being produced & sold on a large scale. I wonder who can fit such a description? Anyway, read the news release below and make your own assumptions what this means for Beam going forward. It would at least explain some weakness in the stock recently if this is the case.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/beam-global-introduces-innovative-governance-120000209.html"
"This company has the most innovative products that will be in such high demand. These products really have revenue caps of 10B+.The main issue with this company is PRODUCTION. The company needs to upscale QUICKLY. Beam Global can make 2200 units in their current facility if they upgrade to full capacity. ($140M Revenue)Desmond indicates 10 more plants need to be built. He says then they can create 20,000 units a year. (1.4B in revenue)How quickly can they grow? I believe it’ll have to be QUICK. They need MONEY to do so. I’m curious to how they will finance this increase?"
"I am disappointed to see PR about the sale of a single unit -- we need to see bigger orders. A one-z is often a tester, which can lead to future multiple units if the customer is satisfied and has the budget for this, but currently Beam has the capacity to fabricate five units per week which results in about $4 mm revenue per quarter -- they seem to be well under this level of sales/production - at least that's my interpretation of today's PR. Nice product, but the company needs to ramp up sales big time or they will be a niche product."
I love to this company but i hate the stock.the valuation is out of this world and i have been tracking it for months now.buying in at $12 and will average down at $8good to see it sell off finally...
"No surprises here. Great company, great products and an execellent b/s. With the Dems in power & the hard push for Green solutions, this should bode very well for this type of company. The current global environement is extremely conducive for Beam and we should see their share price way above $100 very soon. The stock right now is very cheap compared to the lucrative business these guys will bring in by mid year. Their Arc divison alone should be enough to justify that level. My prediction for Beam is $200 by July and at least a 5 for 1 split soon after."
When the sinking will stop i keep buy the dipth but it keeps goes down more and more im officaly -47%
"Not sure how much this is worth.....release below.....in terms of bottom line BUT it's another front where the company can increase sales & potentially extract more revenue . So at the bear minimum, another notch in the company's belt & another step forward for company recognition across the world.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/beam-global-issued-chinese-patent-120000474.html"
Something is not right about BEEM....This stock price is not sustainable.....Could drop to the low 50's.in the next few weeks.......
50% own by institutions Blackrock also own it
Each day this company’s stock is locked up more and more !the Robin Hood traders will regret the so-called day trading that has been taking place in Beam Global. Take a look at TSLA’s chart for the last 5 years. See how many shares are in the float! Remember NO debt! The Green new deal is real and it‘a technology will explode. The fuel costs of the world’s population both individually and corporate transportation could translate into trillions !!!!!!!
Beam Global paid for Christmas this year. I almost wish I didn't sell but I was starting to become uneasy with how much of a stake I had in this company (over 4x initial investment!). Wish for the best for those who keep holding! Merry Christmas!
Nice PR this morning. Record monthly revenue in January. Sure the base is small but the key is implied growth. Much easier to put up significant growth if they just keep doing what they are doing. The great thing is as EVSI continues to execute performance will continue to improve and it will get even more attractive from an M&A standpoint. Either way valuation increases.

Maybe even do what GME did at some level, like Anthony's post suggests. Keep holding folks only more good things to come from these guys. I personally wouldn't sell ANYTHING until at least $100-$150.

Really nice volume and nice consolidation over 0.20 - should be able to trade higher from here. Could be setting up for a week of new closing highs which will help!
Short Interest just came out for March! Over 2 million shares short! 24+%! Who would do that? With a total of 8 million shares outstanding and 25% institutions holding that means a lot of buying to cover! Am I missing something here? When this BEEM turns green it will be upside scary!

"Okay,,, I don’t get what is happening? Maybe traders are getting impatient or something? I have put all the ingredients together and it spells monster! I guess I am not as patient as I should be! Or someone knows something I am not aware of!"
"Long at $35 today... With just 8 million shares outstanding and the shorts eclipsing 1.6 million on March 15, I think this is very interesting... With the short volume ratio above 20 since the 15th, we'll probably see 2+ million short for March... Will double down on any irrational dips going forward..."
"How many car manufacturers are going electric? Answer = LOTS!! How many charging stations companies? 3 maybe? How many gas stations in the world? What will Shell, Chevron, BP etc do with their stations when EVs replace combustion engines? You can’t afford to charge at home! 120 amp can’t cut it! The energy industry is going to panic very very soon! Green energy is here and Big energy and big Auto will have to address the potential situation of lots of sail boats but NO wind!"
More Revenue in Q1 than in any FULL year prior! Nice. Sure it is a small base but it is a small base that is becoming bigger. They are successfully growing the business. Kudos to the CEO and Team. Keep it up!
Does Mr. Wheatley plan to sell shares every three months?
"So, just in case you hadn’t noticed, the flood that is coming popped a tiny hole in the dike. There’s going to be tons of money earmarked for Government agencies to go green. Buying electric pickups for rural USFS and NPS would logically require a method of charging. BEEM fills that easily. Don’t have to worry about tying into the grid (lots more paperwork, big hassle and slowdown deployment of said new rig(s).The future is bright. Think of all those remote NP and USFS scenic roads that will need a couple...That’s why that GSA contract was HUGE! Doesn’t matter your agency, it’s GSA approved. Go get it."

"Some more news of more orders, link below. So what's really new here? This is nothing new to shareholders BUT i'd like to highlight a few critical points in the release. ""The system was funded in part by grants from the Santa Barbara County Air Pollution Control District (APCD) and California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services (Cal OES), and was purchased through California Contract #1-18-61-16 which simplifies the procurement process and ensures best pricing.""""The City of Goleta’s EV ARC unit is equipped with a ChargePoint Dual Port charger and can power up to 265 e-miles of driving in a day.""As most of you are aware, Practically 100% of their orders & customers are some form of Gov't. Therefore i assume that when that humongous infrastructure bill is passed, it should green light EVERY local/State Gov't in the country & give themv the go ahead to purchase one of these systems. Another interesting thing to note here, It's a ChargePoint system....again! From a ChargePoint stance, this would be a very attractive & accretive acquisition for them in the future.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/city-goleta-ca-orders-beam-120000024.html"
"I am hopeful that Q3 will be the breakout quarter where Beam solves the production bottlenecks and delivers more than 2-3 units per week for measly $2.1 mm revenue. This should drop the unit costs so the company isn't selling units at 13% below COGs. The company is doing a nice job lining up orders -- adding $25 mm to the pipeline, but that's meaningless if you only produce $2 million. I chalk these issues to ""growing pains"" as they go from crawling to toddler to walking and then running. Tesla had to work out supply chain and fabrication issues -- and shareholders have been rewarded. With a deluge of infrastructure money about to rain down, Beem is a good investment."

I see us hitting a 20% more gain before New Years. From there on we will trade sideways until the big corporation is announced or a big contract. Now if this thing was named Blink we’d already be in the billions. Keep playing this “underdog” (I know it hasn’t performed like one but it’s valuation still is) until that news gets released then consider your options.

"Hedge Funds Getting Interested In Envision Solar International, Inc. (EVSI)https://www.google.com/amp/s/finance.yahoo.com/amphtml/news/hedge-funds-getting-interested-envision-223937382.html"
Can’t wait for this company to get the patent for the wireless vehicle charger. Just listened to the last earnings call. Can I remind you guys that the EV standard that is patented by beam is suppose to be the HIGHEST volume sales we will see. These are being built as we speak and contracts are going to be announced.The Solar Tree in the future will be the future of truck stops and local government truck fleet charger.
"As long as these charger stations start to go in bulk it is all good. It makes sense on paper worldwide, but a larger number of units need to go out the door. Based on your average micro-market cap, the desirability for this one is real. They have multiple solar products for large scale solutions."
This EV revolution is just beginning so make sure you analyze the potential winners. BEEM is one of them.
"Thought I'd make an account here for the people who don't use stock twits. The authorized shares that people are worried about aren't actually going to be released unless they plan to acquire other companies look who they hired onto the board. Beam has incredibly low float compared to competitors and if they want to compete in this new sector they need flexibility. Think about it electric vehicles are going to soar within the next decade and this charging sector is in its infancy we are already supplying Electrify America with ARC's who are partnered with JEEP. We have the EV standard which is my personal favorite product and can't wait for it to be released and drone charging is just in the works for now but I can't wait for the long-term potential of this company. Also, we have a pending largest order that will destroy past Rev albeit there is no time frame currently for when the order is processed Desmond is very confident the order will go through"

Beam Global enthusiasts please check out the Barrons article on electric charging companies last week! WOW!!! $$$$$$$$$$$
"Another day, another order, link below. These last few contracts may not be large BUT at least the company's products are in high demand, by MANY customers. I suspect the lack of LARGE sales by clients is due to a couple of factors. One, the cost of these items is not cheap & quite substantial. even for local Gov'ts & cities. Two, most of these State or city run entities just don't have the money or funding to commit a very large investment into these NEW GREEN technologies. I exepct this will change when the infrastucture bills & similar laws gets passed in Congress to increase the budget for these items. At which time they will receive the money to purchase these much needed products in this new environmental paradigm shift. The demand IS there, unfortunately the cash to purchase these items at this time is not. Lastly, i figure MANY clients are probably hesistant with both budget constraints & making large commitments towards new UNPROVEN (lets be clear on this... WE know Beem's products are great BUT many people are not as informed as we are, even in Gov't) technologies. So i figure when the flood doors are blown wide open on ALL thse fronts, this is the time the large orders will start coming in AND Beem's shafre price will explode. For now, the MM's are just content to trade this in a tight range & are happy to keep shorting it at will when hits ~$40.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ventura-county-ca-orders-ten-120000424.html"

"This is my green tech investment. I do believe for EV infrastructure to be universal, BEEM should become a leader. My opinion"
Is it too late to invest in this company? I’m a long term kind of guy. New to investing though.
$0.21 Yeah! Finally!
"How does a company with a $50 million backlog at the start of the quarter deliver just $2.2 million of revenue for the quarter? Furthermore, they continue to sell the systems for materially less than COGs. There is an odd disconnect here. Wheatley says the company has capacity to fabricate about $4-$5 mm of systems a quarter - so I was looking for news about production expansion. Customers are ordering the charging stations but the company appears to have problems fabricating and delivering more than 2-3 units a week. If they can solve the production and cost problems, this will be a great investment -- but for now the jury is still out. I am betting the infrastructure funds rain business on BEEM, so am bullish. If the price falls below $20, the company will be gobbled up by ChargePoint or Blink."
"The state of California just said give us all you have and then some. That might be incentive to quadruple production, for now, until you produce 10-fold the current number of units. This isn’t a bad problem to have for EVSI. A bigger fish or two will need to take a look, includes patent portfolio."
"Important information, yesterday BPT passed the resistance level. recommendation to buy at current prices. potential 350% !!! buy and hold !!!"
"Compared to ChargePoint and Blink, Beam is a ""bargain."" By any conventional measure, the first two are ridiculously and unfathomably overvalued, so makes BEEM seem cheap. Enjoy the ride; make sure to get off before the music stops."
I was so scared about this dip until I came on here and was reminded that this is a buying opportunity for a solid company with a great future. Thanks guys.
Unable to contact Investor Relations. I went to the investor relations link. It sent me to a third party. I filled out the form. It said unable to send message try again later. Apparently they don't want to hear from their investors. I would like to know how we can have a shareholder vote on current management.
Q2 Now out. Record results. Still a low base but key indicators are all improving. Management is doing a great job now we need greater scale. Stock should not be trading at 0.20. Still long and see this as a no risk takeout for the technology.

While its stated plans are ambitious, on a global or even nationwide basis they still seem modest. What are your thoughts on this? Thanks in advance."
"Beam Global enthusiasts! I looked at Yahoo Finance holder information today to discover that over the last 6months institutions acquired 24% of BEEM shares. TODAY, Invesco Ltd acquired for their own portfolio 12.6% / 1,010,000 shares under 13-D filing with the SEC/US Government. Ladies and Gentlemen, this isa major move for BEEM's stock. See for yourself by going to Yahoo Finance / Holders."

"More news and what do you know?......More orders. This is becoming so much a daily occurrence & almost common place with Beam that's it's desensitizing investors towards the company's huge potential. How many companies do you guys know that receive orders on a steady weekly basis? Yeah, i know what some of you guys are going to say, it's only one unit orders, small contracts.....BUT i'll say this to counter that argument. Even if these cities or small local communities are only ordering one unit each, how many of these communities or cities are in California alone let alone that whole country? Thousands! That's how many.I think this is just a ""dip your toes"" phase for most of these cities or communities and if they like what they see & how the tech works including having the budget for these items.......these orders will most likely substantially increase in volume in the not to distant future. On another note, i also noticed that ChargePoint is getting the lion's share of having their chargers being tacked on them. How long do you guys think it will take before one of these large EV charging companies like ChargePoint, Blink or even Tesla start to notice the trend.....and Beam?https://finance.yahoo.com/news/city-racine-wi-deploys-beam-120000872.html"
Their seems to be a recognition that whatever EV companies win it won't matter for BEEM as the fueling of these vehicles are going to be imperative! They are a leader and will be expanding the service. The necessity of this and the strong need soon is obvious.
this is beautiful

"Beam will get favorable publicity next week as the recharge system for a small electric plane making five 30 mile puddle-jumps between Fresno to Sacramento. Not exactly heroic like Lindbergh or ground breaking like Solar Impulse, but news fodder nonetheless. I'm more interested in hearing about orders -- which result in revenues a quarter or two out. The issue for Beam is that the Arc system is quite expensive and provides relatively little electricity and the company has been selling the units for less than cost. Like Capstone and Westport, they are likely to get to a positive gross market in a year or two, but it's still an equipment sale with tight margins. Adding ads could be a game-changer, similar to Citibike, so hoping to hear progress on this in the CC in a few weeks."

"There are 145 Million shares. If the stock were $1.00 per share, the market value of the company would be like 12 times SALES (not earnings). Management is fine, doing a great job with strategic focus on government and corporate agencies able to order multiple units."
"I am considering investing in a long position with this co. I see their main advantage over Blink, EVgo etc is the speed of implementation. From their website:""The excessive time, money and effort traditional EV charging infrastructure calls for is illogical and impractical to support the mass adoption of EVs executively ordered by many governments across the globe. Installation of grid-tied EV charging stations requires a timeline of 9 to 12 months, serious planning, invasive construction and extreme costs.""This seems like a great exploitable advantage to use versus other proposals they are bidding against, like in NYC. If a parking garage building wanted to turn their typical concrete lot into an EV charging level, it would be easy and fast to do it with these. But a grid-attached system, probably 9-12 months as this statement says, and much more expensive.Thoughts yea or nay?"
