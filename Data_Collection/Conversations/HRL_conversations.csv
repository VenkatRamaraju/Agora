Always bet on Spam
Toro!
I wish Hormel would stop buying companies and stock pile some cash or increase the dividend.
Fails on earnings expectations
This company would probably do better. If they would produce more product!
"The CEO said that SPAM sales are ""on fire"" during this pandemic and on pace for a sixth consecutive year of record sales! Combine that with other popular products such as Skippy peanut butter, sound fundamentals, and this looks like a great buy."
Very interested in this company
HRL is down 4.97% to 45.87
Near 52 week high. Onwards and upwards.
HRL is down -5.66% to 36.33
"Hey Hormel, if you're listening, send me a case of Spam! Take care of your shareholders!"
Next order $43.75
"Our resident Debbie downer David is back. Right on cue. Cas is right on his heels. The sky is falling since it dropped a couple bucks. The sky is not falling and it is simply consolidating a bit after this run. After this consolidation, it will go higher. I strongly doubt we see 35."
"Other stocks are getting destroyed in this huge market drop. HRL has barely dropped in comparison, which illustrates its strong defensive characteristics. Circus performers David and Cas will say or do anything to get you to sell your shares. Ignore these paid bashers."
I need to be spoon fed chili. FEED ME!
"I'm watching Hormel closely. I'm not buying yet, but possibly soon."
HRL reached a new 52 Week High at 40.76
Anyone know who changes stock price when data does not support the change. It is stock manupulation fraud as I see it. HRL did that on Friday and into Monday.
40 hit. Beautiful thing to see.
Hormel Foods is down 4.92% to 47.57
Spam is king!
I am going to delete this Hrl from my list .
"""Underwood Ham"" potted BGS foods. forward thinking BGS."
I love this stock!!!
Technical analysis makes no sense without fundamental analysis and the current environment factor! HRL is below 49 on Monday! The broad market is big green next week! There are tons of discounted great deals out there for institutions before the discounted price gone!
I am drinking a Steel Reserve 211 42oz beer on the can. How awesome is that?
HRL reached a new 52 Week High at $43.98
This is not a short term gainer. The dividend is like clockwork and it typically also increases a small amount each year. It grows steadily over time and then seems to split and that is where the gains come in. Hoping it splits this winter. With this drop in price it could be a time to ad.
Established food company. People gotta eat no matter what. It’s a buy! No brained!
"Ha!!!!! CRTD just got in the Mac and Cheese game !!!! We sneakin veggies into your kids food now. Were making you healthy. Gluten free you pastry eatin' chicken clucks. Kids love it, parents love it, the WORLD will love some healthy, no GMO Mac n Cheese. Invading your kitchen space while taking your kids on a healthy frolic through cheddarville. Better than Annie's and fake Kraft Mac!!! Hittin shelves soon. $KHC $GIS $KR $ACI $HRL"
Analyst on CNBC just said there's no reason to buy Hormel. Said it has been going down all year and he feels it will only continue. He said that the type of food Hormel sells simply is not what people tend to buy any more.
You better look at this close. This Aristocrat can't be beat at this bargain price. I had to have my piece of this pie with a whole lot a room to go up up up and make money
"I liked HRL but recently sold out, which could be a mistake. However, Jennie-O is proving to be a continuing mistake by HRL management. Processed turkey is just as harmful as other processed meats. Five years ago the profit on turkey was 23% so, that seemed good then. Now there is a glut of turkey. HRL"
I did not realize Hormel owns Dinty Moore beef stew! I love that stuff. Did you guys see tha Applewood smoked bacon? I am obsessed with Applewood flavor.
Screw Zach’s

"Hormel will be around for the next hundred years plus, selling quality products, with excellent margins, and making money. The rise is steady ,the results, and dividends support my opinion, not to mention acquisitions. I feel the company is a very solid investment and safe haven."
I love this stock
Hormel buying Planters Peanuts for 3 billion dollars! That's not peanuts!
"Rough day for holders, great day for shorts!"
What a beautiful stock!
Hold hold buy hold show em who's boss!!.. oh wrong thread lolololololol go pepperoni and spam! And bacon! Yes BACON HORMEL!!!
"That said, the company envisions earnings in the range of $1.77-$1.91 in fiscal 2019. Give a generous PE of 20, put the stock sub-$40."
#HRL Indicators are looking bullish at stoxline. On watch for clear above 37.22. Target: 43.47.
"Bought at $43.25, $43, and $42.75"
Longer shelf life; Spam or this stock?
Muscle Milk NEVER made any sense.
Bought @ $43.31
I think I know why stock is falling -- the market is concerned that new Trump policies will result in deportation of a majority of Hormel's work force. Hiring legal citizens will raise HRL labor costs.
"HRL due for a haircut, just like TSN. PE 25 exceeds industry norms (PE 10 to 17)See you in the high $30s tomorrow."
Let's go! Time to get it in gear Hormel.
"New high hit today. Wonderful for us longs. FYI, I am the original Roy that regularly posts."
Is $46 a good entry?
Pandemics is aweful but good for HRL as people hoarding cans and package foods. Folks like me for one can't cook I buy them all the times especially during these time.
Man beans taste good
I love this Anonymous guy. Change your name so U can identify you. You crack me up breh!
Boom  $43.50 order executed!
I have big gains in this company. I bought it for safety but got way more than I bargained for. Not buying anymore here but I'm going to hold onto my position.
"want to move on HRL again start with large first tranche, but no cooperation from hfc and bots. just no hope yet for low 40's family trust funds can't take a flyer at 47 or 45. of course, you know better so guess you better pick up your first 5K sh today. wait, you're broke and can't. well, keep strong with comments then."
HRL is up 4.95% to 44.40
Media should mention Skippy Peanut Butter is also a Hormel brand....and they never do.
This company gives me bad gas.
I saw Marty sitting on the carpet and scooting. He didn't wipe very well. Must have been itchy huh?
I hope the next earnings report is better than expected from people having less money and also wanting to store foods with shelf life. Did they announce the divi increase yet?
I'm seeking a way to purchase the first share of HRL w/o using a broker. HRL requires owning one share to enter their DSPP plan. Any sugestions???
Doing end of month review. This low key stock has made me 24% in first 4 months. Holding a core position and selling calls and puts $1-$2 out of money. Every week. Besides it has quarterly divy. Did the same with another boring stock - CAHI got CALLed out of CAH but not before booking 17% profit in 2 months. Looking to get back in CAH (around $55) as well and sell weekly Calls and Puts. Long term HRL is here to stay and make investors money.
HRL reached a 52 Week high at 46.62
Laid some strips of Spam on my face. Hello Clarice...
HRL is up 5.04% to 44.78
"Hrl.. is no long my cup of tea, although management had been doing good jobs during the COVID-19. share price stays at range bound $34 - $50 since pre-covid. Especially, not much sale growth Turkey meat among all food categories."
No negative news yet!
I finally found a use for spam that I don't recommend. As an ice cream topping. it's much better fried on a sandwich with lettuce and pickles.
HRL is down 5.55% to 37.30
When is this stock going to gain some positive growth? It has been sitting around these numbers for sometime!
"Here's a tip for you David. Check the dividend. Buy at 2%, sell at 1.9%. Clockwork."
"Hormel will beat earnings, buy now."
Hormel Foods is down 7.24% to 39.33
What a beautiful stock
"Wait until after the earnings to buy, the entire packeged food sector has been slammed. While record sales did appear for many of HRL's competitors like Tyson and Sysco, it was isolated to only the grocery segemnt of their buisness. Tyson saw 30-40% sales growth in consumer groceries, but a 25% drop in foodservice revanue. That differnce was enough to cause a total 15% loss of income for the quarter. Same thing with Sysco. The loss in the foodservice industry is simply too great to overshadow. 3 quarters from now this will be above the $50 line for sure as restauraunts and production plant open again, but as for earnings tommrow (5/21), the numbers don't lie."
everything is falling apart and this is still overpriced lol
https://traders-ideas.com/winningscalls
We were doing so good.
Dividend Superhero!
Forward PE of 24. PEG of 7? 
someone has been averaging down nicely. think it can trade between the 47-47.50 next week due to options open interest?
"Nice balance sheet, but horribly High PE in this enviroment!"
"Technically speaking, this scrip has crossed an important barrier last week. Can hold for long term."
When will this stock start moving up? Good management team and products.
Everyone's having a good time cooking at home now!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jx7QERoVty4
What a beautiful stock 
I bought some Spam in the Habib mart today no joke. Smoked Spam. That's what it says. It's so #$%# good. I love this company.
Great SHORT.
Big earnings miss today. Is this another buying opportunity or do we head to $30?
the turkeys at a major turkey farm are endorsing spam for Christmas dinner
Hormel is a very stable company. The company has a quick ration of 1.9 and a current ratio of 3.00 of cash & accounts receivables to current liabilities. The companies overall profit margin of 9% is not bad but trailing some other food companies. The thing that is slowing the growth of Hormel and it's stock price is growth in sales. The company pays out 57.3% of cash in dividends. This company is stable.
There 269 ways to eat Spam
I need Spam! LOTS OF IT!
HRL at 33 and then HRL will cause my attention. too many other staples offering bargains. ymmv.
Interesting it has a negative Beta.It is rarely seen..
Hormel chilli. It's the only food in the world that looks the same going in as it does coming out. Great business model.
"This stock has made me money in both good and bad times. It is by far the best performing stock on Wall Street right now besides maybe Walmart. I am in love with this stock. The dividend is stable, has been consistently raised throughout the years, and is projected to a grow at a whopping 8 percent over the next few years. Demand for their products is inelastic, etc. What's not to like? I only wish I owned more of it."
Glad I got in today at $46. I will average down when there is blood in the water
I like Spam!
market down almost 200 points but hormel is up...ha ha ha
Hormel Foods is up 4.98% to 48.26
"Up >21% in just over one month. Sold $30 put for three years worth of dividends up front. Dividend hike coming next quarter. Not too shabby! Simple, if you keep it simple.."
HRL is down 4.96% to 44.88
it's 5pm do you know where your spam is?
HRL BE READY FOR $ 35 STOCK
"Hormel is a stable company with great management. I love that the company headquarters and management team are in a small town of 26,000 in southern Minnesota. (Austin) Managements children go to the same school as the SPAM line workers."
Next order $43.25
"I am either going to be rich, or eating SPAM the rest of my life, maybe both!"
Hurricane in Hawaii should have a big run on Spam. Spam is a big seller in Hawaii. up it goes
Shareholders of record will be receiving a SPCI dividend from Hormel this qtr of one case of spam original sent to the address on file. I heard.
Will hit 40+ in the coming days/weeks.
Doing my research the owners feel very confident in this company seeming how they have loss millions and continue to buy more when the price drops. This could be Bullish
HRL is down 4.99% to 42.61
I invested here because stag chili is hands down the best
HRL is down 5.16% to 40.09
"Here we go, we just need more volume."
Can't find bacon flavored spam! somebody's not doing their job!
Guess nobody loves a great value stock anymore. HRL not flashy but consistent and stable. Don't know what they need to do to get this stock moving. Stuck in neutral unfortunately. Great products though!
"Spam, special sale today only in Piggly Wiggly"
Resistance point has been $38.00. The real question is whether HRL closes above that point today.
"Spam, tastes even better after a nuclear be blast"
Every peak is for HRL insiders to cash out! March 17th and today again! Cliff down on Monday when the report is released!
Spam muffin?
Traded basically sideways for 2 1/2 years. Somebody please wake these guys up and let them know the stock market is leaving without them!
"Based on my chart analysis, this stock shows bearish signals; even the execs are selling. Expect a downturn"
"HRL might earn $2, but the PE should be about 15, so HRL is over-priced at $36. Soybean prices up, therefore, HRL costs are up. The tax cut will help profits, but $2 per year is the high end seem to me. Revenue is flat, and the outlook is likely to be not very rosy due to cost increases (labor, feed, transportation). Going to $30 is likely."
Dead money. Low 40s is about where this stodgy stock should trade.
Hormel Foods is up 4.92% to 49.23
Not able to hold any gains.As soon as it gets near $42 it retreats.
"DJ up 780, HRL up .02. What’s wrong here? Investor relations?."
"This is a great stock that was hammered by the virus, but will be fantastic over time. It's the kind of stock you buy and keep, just reinvesting your dividends and growing them until you need them after retirement. This is not a speculative play. Plus, Spam!"
HRL is down 4.92% to 42.90
Why do we continue to go down after good earnings? $34.30 now wow! Looks like a good entry here.
Overvalued at p/e of 30
HRL reached a new 52 Week High at $45.59
Planters is a shell company!
Back up nicely thus far.

Like what this stock has been doing lately. Keep moving up slow and steady and I will continue to be happy.
Why are we dropping off today 1/24?
seems very plateaued.
Hormel is overvalued... not the worst pkg food holding but way down on the list
"Glad I do not depend on equity research companies for investment advice;....if you know the company I'm speaking about..... Hormel will continue to grow and strive as a result of sound fundamentals ,an excellent product line and a visionary approach to consumption."
$44.00 executed!
Tough time breaking $50.
Can someone explain why HRL deserves a PE of 24 when peers have PE closer to 15 or less?
Does anyone else love planters honey roasted peanuts on their hickory smoked spam!

"Hormel is solid. Buy on this dip, you will make money."
This stock went down Friday for no reason. How did Chinese tariffs news made it go down ? I sold out just like some others.
Tyson foods dragging sector down it seems.
You guys miss me? I love SPAM. I am SPAM. Spam goes in and out with the same consistency. Gross but I love it.
this will become a 60 to 70 dollar a share stock shortly in my opinion..They just introduced vegetarian pepperoni for instance and they bought some of Planters Peanuts. Peanuts are a rich source of protein
Hormel Foods is down 5.16% to 40.09
"Announcing dividend increase on the day before earnings, and after hours on top of that, suggests desperation to prop up share price, before likely very #$%$ earnings announced."
Crypto-Turkey-Burgers
Looks like $40 at best..
had my spam I today how about you
bit expensive
"Hormel will close out the year the end of October,there is always a big push to sell and collect;additionally, the company is gearing up for the Holidays.Hang tight and you will see a considrable increase in stock price over the next couple of months."

When will they give out their dividend
Quality all the way with relevant brands positioned to grow in value over time. Hormel Foods is the perfect company to keep long term. A true winner.
why is the minor pop today?

Perhaps a short-term pull back is more likely before the next rally on HRL? have you guys heard of awe-someSTOCKS. i started receiving their allerts and so far i am happy.
HRL is one of my favorite dividend growth stocks. I talk about dividend growth stocks on my youtube channel. The channel is really focused on new and beginner investors looking to invest in dividend growth stocks and ETFs. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrg6IDPf4a7pUKTN90n6syg
What’s the deal here.
Hormel looks like a buy at these levels. 10.5 % Off sale ............GL
kHc and tsn are better plays in the processed meats space.. stay away from hornet bgs and cpb
Going all in today on this dividend aristocrat!
"Got orders in for 35.75, 35.50, 35.25"
$HRL great long stock!
Steady dividend vehicle
What a beautiful stock with a beautiful dividend growth rate!
Anonymous? I can't keep coming here like a guilty pleasure begging for your attention. You are hilarious. Get a handle. Move up and come see me in the mj stocks. I am famous. People know me. I am Rafi.
I hate David
"Great company, just look at total return for the past 20-30 years averaging around 12% per year. Up 25% this year alone. Be a buyer for long term and be happy."
when will this split? In the past anytime it hits these numbers they split.
sold the few shares I had today at 11% increase. I will be back at some point as I really Liked HRL. I know if I had held a few more weeks I would have gotten the divi but I didn't own very many shares.
Bought up puts easy win come earnings
HRL is down 4.92% to 46.06
Wow never looked at the conversations on hrl before . So many from one guy. So strange
I can expect this poor stock performance from CAG & BGS? Whats going on here?It must mean the market does NOT like the peanut deal.
I'm curious what the planters acuisition will add to the value.
Hrl superior to Tyson and ConAgra. Strong most around their brands. Don’t buy commodity.
this runs to 60 after ER
"Apparently, there's been some trouble at the plant. CNN is reporting that the weenies blew up Crematorium #3."
Got some at $41.78
11% of float shares are short. margins look good. current ratio is good. The huge short ratio seems to be proving out with the price direction. Dividend is modest 2%. Think I will pass for some diversified closed end funds instead.
EAT SPAM AND LIVE FOREVER!!!

"This is an excellent long-hold stock, product is superior, manage is very good, cash flow is plus...buy and hold."
"who was that masked man? it was Spam, the guardian of the Galaxy"
They had some interesting insights about HRL on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
Great buying opportunity today!
Cramer just wore a mask with spam pr
12% dividend increase. This stock keeps getting better. Stay the course long term.
"Hormel honestly has such clean financials, and all signs to this company being fundamentally undervalued at the current price point. Future economic catalysts include worsened economic conditions which will lead to an uptick in demand for Hormel products."
HRL needs topline growth to reach new ATHs as revenue has been stagnant for the past few years.
Haven't been this low since Feb/Mar of '20. Time to reload.
The guy who liked Spam Can?
Large short interest in HRL. The big boys bet this stock is going down.
Playin kick the Spam right now in the street. CAR!!!
"This is the stock to buy during disasters. However, people buy Spam to save it just for when there are no fresh meat around. TSN is better to buy right now."
I've been watching awhile now. I bought in back in the low 30's. Sold near 40 and it had some ups and down and I bought in again and now its at 45. This company raises its dividend every year like clockwork and make acquisitions of pretty large proportions on a regular basis. This is just wishful thinking but based on previous track record I am hoping for a split in 2021
I don't see anything in the news about HRL and it is up over 3% and the market is down 3%???
What happened to the idiot thinking this was an anchor bringing down the ship? When a fundamentally sound food company reinvests in itself that is never a bad thing. Hoping for even more gains and hopefully a split this year. Love clockwork!
