Got some at $41.78
Maybe I can buy this under $40
What a beautiful stock…gonna be a great Q4 with all those turkeys 
I wish Hormel would stop buying companies and stock pile some cash or increase the dividend.
"I am either going to be rich, or eating SPAM the rest of my life, maybe both!"
"Why is this stock such a dog? Great products, and there is a need!"

"Food Stocks are the Tech Stocks of the future. Right now, people clamor to buy iPhones, laptops,etc, in a few years, after the world population goes over 8 billion , people will be clamoring to buy food. P.S. i am sure you heard those news reports saying Bill Gates has been buying up farmland.Out of all the food stocks, HRL and ADM are my two favorites."
It's been a rough year for our stock. It'll be nice to get back to our regular performance!
Next order $43.75
We have been in a downtrend for 15 months at this point. The last pullback in HRL lasted 20 months before going on a multi-year run! We are getting closer to the reversal and investments at this point will be handsomely rewarded!
Beautiful buy here at $41.00
Why is there no Oscar Meyer products on the shelf at Walmart? Supply issue?
Is it time to replace upper management? Terrible performance for shareholders.
Will buy when p/e = 15
Order in today for $42.00
The cash flow model says the stock is at a 17% discount to fair value. That implies the stock should be trading closer to $48.50.

What a beautiful stock dividend play at these levels…maybe it will drop below $40 so I can continue to load up
It’s turkey  time! Jennie-O …let’s goooooooooooo
