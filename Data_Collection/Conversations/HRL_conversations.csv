Great buying opportunity today!
Tough time breaking $50.
"This is an excellent long-hold stock, product is superior, manage is very good, cash flow is plus...buy and hold."
You guys miss me? I love SPAM. I am SPAM. Spam goes in and out with the same consistency. Gross but I love it.
Hormel is overvalued... not the worst pkg food holding but way down on the list
"I am either going to be rich, or eating SPAM the rest of my life, maybe both!"

Anyone know who changes stock price when data does not support the change. It is stock manupulation fraud as I see it. HRL did that on Friday and into Monday.
"Here's a tip for you David. Check the dividend. Buy at 2%, sell at 1.9%. Clockwork."
this is a 70.00 stock
I love this stock!!!
Bought up puts easy win come earnings
"Food Stocks are the Tech Stocks of the future. Right now, people clamor to buy iPhones, laptops,etc, in a few years, after the world population goes over 8 billion , people will be clamoring to buy food. P.S. i am sure you heard those news reports saying Bill Gates has been buying up farmland.Out of all the food stocks, HRL and ADM are my two favorites."
Quality all the way with relevant brands positioned to grow in value over time. Hormel Foods is the perfect company to keep long term. A true winner.
I have general mills. I am thinking if I should buy HRL. any opinions?
"Hormel will close out the year the end of October,there is always a big push to sell and collect;additionally, the company is gearing up for the Holidays.Hang tight and you will see a considrable increase in stock price over the next couple of months."
I did not realize Hormel owns Dinty Moore beef stew! I love that stuff. Did you guys see tha Applewood smoked bacon? I am obsessed with Applewood flavor.
"Hey Hormel, if you're listening, send me a case of Spam! Take care of your shareholders!"
"This is a great stock that was hammered by the virus, but will be fantastic over time. It's the kind of stock you buy and keep, just reinvesting your dividends and growing them until you need them after retirement. This is not a speculative play. Plus, Spam!"
This is not a short term gainer. The dividend is like clockwork and it typically also increases a small amount each year. It grows steadily over time and then seems to split and that is where the gains come in. Hoping it splits this winter. With this drop in price it could be a time to ad.
Planters is a shell company!
I invested here because stag chili is hands down the best
When will this stock start moving up? Good management team and products.
I love this Anonymous guy. Change your name so U can identify you. You crack me up breh!
Media should mention Skippy Peanut Butter is also a Hormel brand....and they never do.
Near 52 week high. Onwards and upwards.
Looking good for higher prices. Looking for breakout at 38.42 for a run up to 47.84. Buy rating: 7 at 9trading
11% of float shares are short. margins look good. current ratio is good. The huge short ratio seems to be proving out with the price direction. Dividend is modest 2%. Think I will pass for some diversified closed end funds instead.
"The CEO said that SPAM sales are ""on fire"" during this pandemic and on pace for a sixth consecutive year of record sales! Combine that with other popular products such as Skippy peanut butter, sound fundamentals, and this looks like a great buy."
12% dividend increase. This stock keeps getting better. Stay the course long term.
David and Cas while on Hormel bashing tour.
Resistance point has been $38.00. The real question is whether HRL closes above that point today.
Like what this stock has been doing lately. Keep moving up slow and steady and I will continue to be happy.
"Glad I do not depend on equity research companies for investment advice;....if you know the company I'm speaking about..... Hormel will continue to grow and strive as a result of sound fundamentals ,an excellent product line and a visionary approach to consumption."
Steady dividend vehicle
#HRL Indicators are looking bullish at stoxline. On watch for clear above 37.22. Target: 43.47.
Meat processing business is getting hurt by 2 ways!1. Shutdowninfect=No Production2.VaccineReopen=Nobody wants to eat SPAM chemical mix
"Spam, special sale today only in Piggly Wiggly"
Hormel Foods is up 4.92% to 49.23
"Spam is awesome. The stock might not be performing, but Spam is still the GOAT!"
"After a pretty good quarter, the stock is down while the market is up. Think Hormel has an investor relations problem? Terrible."
Hormel Foods is down 7.24% to 39.33
Boom  $43.50 order executed!
HRL is one of my favorite dividend growth stocks. I talk about dividend growth stocks on my youtube channel. The channel is really focused on new and beginner investors looking to invest in dividend growth stocks and ETFs. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrg6IDPf4a7pUKTN90n6syg
HRL reached an all time high at 49.48
Next order $41.50
"Bought at $43.25, $43, and $42.75"
This stock went down Friday for no reason. How did Chinese tariffs news made it go down ? I sold out just like some others.
Not able to hold any gains.As soon as it gets near $42 it retreats.
No negative news yet!
"Got orders in for 35.75, 35.50, 35.25"
Glad I got in today at $46. I will average down when there is blood in the water
Haven't been this low since Feb/Mar of '20. Time to reload.
"Hormel is a stable company with great management. I love that the company headquarters and management team are in a small town of 26,000 in southern Minnesota. (Austin) Managements children go to the same school as the SPAM line workers."
"Great company, just look at total return for the past 20-30 years averaging around 12% per year. Up 25% this year alone. Be a buyer for long term and be happy."
I wish Hormel would stop buying companies and stock pile some cash or increase the dividend.
"Horrible chart and sentiment on this name. High 30s coming soon, before stock can put in a base and then turn around..."
what is going on with this yahoo message board some of the post are over a month old
HRL reached a new 52 Week High at 40.76
Hormel Foods is up 5.03% to 42.10
Big earnings miss today. Is this another buying opportunity or do we head to $30?
What a beautiful stock

Shareholders of record will be receiving a SPCI dividend from Hormel this qtr of one case of spam original sent to the address on file. I heard.
"Hormel is solid. Buy on this dip, you will make money."
this runs to 60 after ER
I've been watching awhile now. I bought in back in the low 30's. Sold near 40 and it had some ups and down and I bought in again and now its at 45. This company raises its dividend every year like clockwork and make acquisitions of pretty large proportions on a regular basis. This is just wishful thinking but based on previous track record I am hoping for a split in 2021
Wow never looked at the conversations on hrl before . So many from one guy. So strange
Cramer just wore a mask with spam pr
had my spam I today how about you
i found out my grandson is addicted to their pepperoni- eats it instead of candy-who knew.
Next order $42.33
"Highest price in 5 years only $51 bucks. Price has dropped 5% past 30 days. P/E 28 not great. Good products, but I will pass on Hormel"
Buy more Spam.
Guess nobody loves a great value stock anymore. HRL not flashy but consistent and stable. Don't know what they need to do to get this stock moving. Stuck in neutral unfortunately. Great products though!
I bought some Spam in the Habib mart today no joke. Smoked Spam. That's what it says. It's so #$%# good. I love this company.
Established food company. People gotta eat no matter what. It’s a buy! No brained!
Analyst on CNBC just said there's no reason to buy Hormel. Said it has been going down all year and he feels it will only continue. He said that the type of food Hormel sells simply is not what people tend to buy any more.
HRL at 33 and then HRL will cause my attention. too many other staples offering bargains. ymmv.
the turkeys at a major turkey farm are endorsing spam for Christmas dinner
Traded basically sideways for 2 1/2 years. Somebody please wake these guys up and let them know the stock market is leaving without them!
Longer shelf life; Spam or this stock?
Maybe I can buy this under $40
Everyone's having a good time cooking at home now!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jx7QERoVty4
this will become a 60 to 70 dollar a share stock shortly in my opinion..They just introduced vegetarian pepperoni for instance and they bought some of Planters Peanuts. Peanuts are a rich source of protein
Muscle Milk NEVER made any sense.
Why do we continue to go down after good earnings? $34.30 now wow! Looks like a good entry here.
This chart is ridiculous btw. I want to kiss management. Lets be honest there products are not exactly top notch. Most people don't know what is in them. But they make a billion dollars year after year. Amaze-ballz.
I finally found a use for spam that I don't recommend. As an ice cream topping. it's much better fried on a sandwich with lettuce and pickles.
Going all in today on this dividend aristocrat!
Hormel buying Planters Peanuts for 3 billion dollars! That's not peanuts!
Hormel looks like a buy at these levels. 10.5 % Off sale ............GL
What a beautiful stock dividend play at these levels…maybe it will drop below $40 so I can continue to load up
Hrl superior to Tyson and ConAgra. Strong most around their brands. Don’t buy commodity.
Forward PE of 24. PEG of 7? 
Always bet on Spam
"Why is this stock such a dog? Great products, and there is a need!"
This company would probably do better. If they would produce more product!
HORMEL needs to a make an acquisition and diversity they need a new life in the product line. either that they should put the company for sale
Technical analysis makes no sense without fundamental analysis and the current environment factor! HRL is below 49 on Monday! The broad market is big green next week! There are tons of discounted great deals out there for institutions before the discounted price gone!
40 hit. Beautiful thing to see.
I think I know why stock is falling -- the market is concerned that new Trump policies will result in deportation of a majority of Hormel's work force. Hiring legal citizens will raise HRL labor costs.
"That said, the company envisions earnings in the range of $1.77-$1.91 in fiscal 2019. Give a generous PE of 20, put the stock sub-$40."
$44.00 executed!
Looking to buy under $44 on Thursday
Hormel Foods is down 5.16% to 40.09
I like Spam!
$HRL great long stock!
Hormel is a very stable company. The company has a quick ration of 1.9 and a current ratio of 3.00 of cash & accounts receivables to current liabilities. The companies overall profit margin of 9% is not bad but trailing some other food companies. The thing that is slowing the growth of Hormel and it's stock price is growth in sales. The company pays out 57.3% of cash in dividends. This company is stable.
EAT SPAM AND LIVE FOREVER!!!
Why are we dropping off today 1/24?
Is $46 a good entry?
Hormel Foods is down 4.92% to 47.57

Perhaps a short-term pull back is more likely before the next rally on HRL? have you guys heard of awe-someSTOCKS. i started receiving their allerts and so far i am happy.
"This stock has made me money in both good and bad times. It is by far the best performing stock on Wall Street right now besides maybe Walmart. I am in love with this stock. The dividend is stable, has been consistently raised throughout the years, and is projected to a grow at a whopping 8 percent over the next few years. Demand for their products is inelastic, etc. What's not to like? I only wish I owned more of it."

"Let’s go management, the market is treating Hormel as a totally defensive stock. Let’s be positive. Being green is great, but remember green is also the color of money"
Very interested in this company
Interesting it has a negative Beta.It is rarely seen..
"Apparently, there's been some trouble at the plant. CNN is reporting that the weenies blew up Crematorium #3."
Fails on earnings expectations

"if you are ever feeling down about a food stock, like this one or any other you own, just go to ""world population clock"" and you will feel VERY confident about the future prices of food stocks- remember, if people don't eat, they will die."
"be charitable, send a case if spam to the Grand poo pa of Isis"
I'm curious what the planters acuisition will add to the value.
Dead money. Low 40s is about where this stodgy stock should trade.
Dividend Superhero!
When is this stock going to gain some positive growth? It has been sitting around these numbers for sometime!
Doing end of month review. This low key stock has made me 24% in first 4 months. Holding a core position and selling calls and puts $1-$2 out of money. Every week. Besides it has quarterly divy. Did the same with another boring stock - CAHI got CALLed out of CAH but not before booking 17% profit in 2 months. Looking to get back in CAH (around $55) as well and sell weekly Calls and Puts. Long term HRL is here to stay and make investors money.
Great SHORT.
I can expect this poor stock performance from CAG & BGS? Whats going on here?It must mean the market does NOT like the peanut deal.
kHc and tsn are better plays in the processed meats space.. stay away from hornet bgs and cpb
"want to move on HRL again start with large first tranche, but no cooperation from hfc and bots. just no hope yet for low 40's family trust funds can't take a flyer at 47 or 45. of course, you know better so guess you better pick up your first 5K sh today. wait, you're broke and can't. well, keep strong with comments then."
"Technically speaking, this scrip has crossed an important barrier last week. Can hold for long term."
I found a new island to hide on. It's a volcanic island spewing chili. Hormel is my home now. Chili and Spam.
Can't find bacon flavored spam! somebody's not doing their job!
someone has been averaging down nicely. think it can trade between the 47-47.50 next week due to options open interest?
Toro!
The cash flow model says the stock is at a 17% discount to fair value. That implies the stock should be trading closer to $48.50.
This will recover faster than it normally does.
Next order $43.75
Hurricane in Hawaii should have a big run on Spam. Spam is a big seller in Hawaii. up it goes
"Rough day for holders, great day for shorts!"
"Spam, tastes even better after a nuclear be blast"
Beautiful buy here at $41.00
What a beautiful stock!
I love this stock
I don't see anything in the news about HRL and it is up over 3% and the market is down 3%???
HRL reached a new 52 Week High at $43.98
why is the minor pop today?
"HRL might earn $2, but the PE should be about 15, so HRL is over-priced at $36. Soybean prices up, therefore, HRL costs are up. The tax cut will help profits, but $2 per year is the high end seem to me. Revenue is flat, and the outlook is likely to be not very rosy due to cost increases (labor, feed, transportation). Going to $30 is likely."
"David, David, David, I was hoping you would be right this time, I have been looking to get back in at a bargain price but it just won't give it to me."
"Up >21% in just over one month. Sold $30 put for three years worth of dividends up front. Dividend hike coming next quarter. Not too shabby! Simple, if you keep it simple.."
Back up nicely thus far.
"I'm watching Hormel closely. I'm not buying yet, but possibly soon."
Doing my research the owners feel very confident in this company seeming how they have loss millions and continue to buy more when the price drops. This could be Bullish
"who was that masked man? it was Spam, the guardian of the Galaxy"
Will hit 40+ in the coming days/weeks.
I hope the next earnings report is better than expected from people having less money and also wanting to store foods with shelf life. Did they announce the divi increase yet?
Where is tha funny guy here?
Can someone explain why HRL deserves a PE of 24 when peers have PE closer to 15 or less?
"Other stocks are getting destroyed in this huge market drop. HRL has barely dropped in comparison, which illustrates its strong defensive characteristics. Circus performers David and Cas will say or do anything to get you to sell your shares. Ignore these paid bashers."
"Based on my chart analysis, this stock shows bearish signals; even the execs are selling. Expect a downturn"
"Hormel has a history of excellence, it will continue to shine..... good company ,good products, good management...a safe and profitable investment."
seems very plateaued.
"This is the stock to buy during disasters. However, people buy Spam to save it just for when there are no fresh meat around. TSN is better to buy right now."
Does anyone else love planters honey roasted peanuts on their hickory smoked spam!
"Here we go, we just need more volume."
Go long...50 by year's end.
"Announcing dividend increase on the day before earnings, and after hours on top of that, suggests desperation to prop up share price, before likely very #$%$ earnings announced."
a day without Spam is like _____a day without spam
sold the few shares I had today at 11% increase. I will be back at some point as I really Liked HRL. I know if I had held a few more weeks I would have gotten the divi but I didn't own very many shares.
Spam is king!
Dividend King 
"HRL due for a haircut, just like TSN. PE 25 exceeds industry norms (PE 10 to 17)See you in the high $30s tomorrow."
"I liked HRL but recently sold out, which could be a mistake. However, Jennie-O is proving to be a continuing mistake by HRL management. Processed turkey is just as harmful as other processed meats. Five years ago the profit on turkey was 23% so, that seemed good then. Now there is a glut of turkey. HRL"
Laid some strips of Spam on my face. Hello Clarice...
HRL is down -5.66% to 36.33
Is it time to replace upper management? Terrible performance for shareholders.
when will this split? In the past anytime it hits these numbers they split.
HRL reached a new 52 Week High at 39.04
bit expensive
Hormel chilli. It's the only food in the world that looks the same going in as it does coming out. Great business model.
Got some at $41.78
I have big gains in this company. I bought it for safety but got way more than I bargained for. Not buying anymore here but I'm going to hold onto my position.
"Hormel, set it and forget it. Retirement stock."
Hold hold buy hold show em who's boss!!.. oh wrong thread lolololololol go pepperoni and spam! And bacon! Yes BACON HORMEL!!!
"Hormel honestly has such clean financials, and all signs to this company being fundamentally undervalued at the current price point. Future economic catalysts include worsened economic conditions which will lead to an uptick in demand for Hormel products."
Why is there no Oscar Meyer products on the shelf at Walmart? Supply issue?
We were doing so good.
They get bought and taken private within 12 months. Like Smithfield. Ride along.
"Our resident Debbie downer David is back. Right on cue. Cas is right on his heels. The sky is falling since it dropped a couple bucks. The sky is not falling and it is simply consolidating a bit after this run. After this consolidation, it will go higher. I strongly doubt we see 35."
Hopefully institutions don’t take profit too fast! Let us longs exit first
Will buy when p/e = 15
This stock seems to always go down in price.
Playin kick the Spam right now in the street. CAR!!!
Pandemics is aweful but good for HRL as people hoarding cans and package foods. Folks like me for one can't cook I buy them all the times especially during these time.
market down almost 200 points but hormel is up...ha ha ha
Next order $43.25
Screamin short.....
I'm seeking a way to purchase the first share of HRL w/o using a broker. HRL requires owning one share to enter their DSPP plan. Any sugestions???

Love the stock; but getting a bit over-anxious for the next split. Any thoughts?
"Ha!!!!! CRTD just got in the Mac and Cheese game !!!! We sneakin veggies into your kids food now. Were making you healthy. Gluten free you pastry eatin' chicken clucks.

Bought @ $43.31
"Hormel will be around for the next hundred years plus, selling quality products, with excellent margins, and making money. The rise is steady ,the results, and dividends support my opinion, not to mention acquisitions. I feel the company is a very solid investment and safe haven."
What’s the deal here.
"Wait until after the earnings to buy, the entire packeged food sector has been slammed. While record sales did appear for many of HRL's competitors like Tyson and Sysco, it was isolated to only the grocery segemnt of their buisness. Tyson saw 30-40% sales growth in consumer groceries, but a 25% drop in foodservice revanue. That differnce was enough to cause a total 15% loss of income for the quarter. Same thing with Sysco. The loss in the foodservice industry is simply too great to overshadow. 3 quarters from now this will be above the $50 line for sure as restauraunts and production plant open again, but as for earnings tommrow (5/21), the numbers don't lie."
"New high hit today. Wonderful for us longs. FYI, I am the original Roy that regularly posts."
HRL needs topline growth to reach new ATHs as revenue has been stagnant for the past few years.
HRL is up 4.95% to 44.40
Large short interest in HRL. The big boys bet this stock is going down.
