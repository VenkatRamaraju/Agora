HRL needs topline growth to reach new ATHs as revenue has been stagnant for the past few years.
"Bought at $43.25, $43, and $42.75"
"This is a great stock that was hammered by the virus, but will be fantastic over time. It's the kind of stock you buy and keep, just reinvesting your dividends and growing them until you need them after retirement. This is not a speculative play. Plus, Spam!"
I have big gains in this company. I bought it for safety but got way more than I bargained for. Not buying anymore here but I'm going to hold onto my position.
Beautiful buy here at $41.00
Order in today for $42.00
"Hormel, set it and forget it. Retirement stock."
Tough time breaking $50.
sold the few shares I had today at 11% increase. I will be back at some point as I really Liked HRL. I know if I had held a few more weeks I would have gotten the divi but I didn't own very many shares.
$HRL great long stock!
Bought @ $43.31
"Up >21% in just over one month. Sold $30 put for three years worth of dividends up front. Dividend hike coming next quarter. Not too shabby! Simple, if you keep it simple.."
"Hormel has a history of excellence, it will continue to shine..... good company ,good products, good management...a safe and profitable investment."
Hormel Foods is down 4.92% to 47.57
Hormel buying Planters Peanuts for 3 billion dollars! That's not peanuts!
Doing end of month review. This low key stock has made me 24% in first 4 months. Holding a core position and selling calls and puts $1-$2 out of money. Every week. Besides it has quarterly divy. Did the same with another boring stock - CAHI got CALLed out of CAH but not before booking 17% profit in 2 months. Looking to get back in CAH (around $55) as well and sell weekly Calls and Puts. Long term HRL is here to stay and make investors money.
"Announcing dividend increase on the day before earnings, and after hours on top of that, suggests desperation to prop up share price, before likely very #$%$ earnings announced."
The cash flow model says the stock is at a 17% discount to fair value. That implies the stock should be trading closer to $48.50.
11% of float shares are short. margins look good. current ratio is good. The huge short ratio seems to be proving out with the price direction. Dividend is modest 2%. Think I will pass for some diversified closed end funds instead.
I think I know why stock is falling -- the market is concerned that new Trump policies will result in deportation of a majority of Hormel's work force. Hiring legal citizens will raise HRL labor costs.

Go long...50 by year's end.
Fails on earnings expectations
Will buy when p/e = 15
Spam is king!
had my spam I today how about you
It’s turkey  time! Jennie-O …let’s goooooooooooo
Going all in today on this dividend aristocrat!
Hrl superior to Tyson and ConAgra. Strong most around their brands. Don’t buy commodity.
Maybe I can buy this under $40
Will hit 40+ in the coming days/weeks.
"Spam is awesome. The stock might not be performing, but Spam is still the GOAT!"
Planters is a shell company!
HORMEL needs to a make an acquisition and diversity they need a new life in the product line. either that they should put the company for sale
"HRL due for a haircut, just like TSN. PE 25 exceeds industry norms (PE 10 to 17)See you in the high $30s tomorrow."
#HRL Indicators are looking bullish at stoxline. On watch for clear above 37.22. Target: 43.47.
"Davey you better put some Spam in your rockets gas tank if you want $55 by the end of the month. Just buy some gas or oil related stocks, Biden will make you rich in the next 12 months."
HRL at 33 and then HRL will cause my attention. too many other staples offering bargains. ymmv.
Dividend Superhero!
"That said, the company envisions earnings in the range of $1.77-$1.91 in fiscal 2019. Give a generous PE of 20, put the stock sub-$40."
"Hormel is a stable company with great management. I love that the company headquarters and management team are in a small town of 26,000 in southern Minnesota. (Austin) Managements children go to the same school as the SPAM line workers."
"I am either going to be rich, or eating SPAM the rest of my life, maybe both!"
"Hormel will be around for the next hundred years plus, selling quality products, with excellent margins, and making money. The rise is steady ,the results, and dividends support my opinion, not to mention acquisitions. I feel the company is a very solid investment and safe haven."
Boom  $43.50 order executed!
"Why is this stock such a dog? Great products, and there is a need!"
I'm seeking a way to purchase the first share of HRL w/o using a broker. HRL requires owning one share to enter their DSPP plan. Any sugestions???
Next order $43.75
Next order $41.50
We have been in a downtrend for 15 months at this point. The last pullback in HRL lasted 20 months before going on a multi-year run! We are getting closer to the reversal and investments at this point will be handsomely rewarded!
Dividend King 
HRL is one of my favorite dividend growth stocks. I talk about dividend growth stocks on my youtube channel. The channel is really focused on new and beginner investors looking to invest in dividend growth stocks and ETFs. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrg6IDPf4a7pUKTN90n6syg
Hormel is overvalued... not the worst pkg food holding but way down on the list
this will become a 60 to 70 dollar a share stock shortly in my opinion..They just introduced vegetarian pepperoni for instance and they bought some of Planters Peanuts. Peanuts are a rich source of protein
Where is tha funny guy here?
Muscle Milk NEVER made any sense.
market down almost 200 points but hormel is up...ha ha ha
"After a pretty good quarter, the stock is down while the market is up. Think Hormel has an investor relations problem? Terrible."
Not able to hold any gains.As soon as it gets near $42 it retreats.
Quality all the way with relevant brands positioned to grow in value over time. Hormel Foods is the perfect company to keep long term. A true winner.
Shareholders of record will be receiving a SPCI dividend from Hormel this qtr of one case of spam original sent to the address on file. I heard.
"Hormel will close out the year the end of October,there is always a big push to sell and collect;additionally, the company is gearing up for the Holidays.Hang tight and you will see a considrable increase in stock price over the next couple of months."
Looking to buy under $44 on Thursday
Laid some strips of Spam on my face. Hello Clarice...
Cramer just wore a mask with spam pr
"Earnings-Reaction to Watch Thursday $MCK , $WUBA , $EGHT , $BBY , $ADSK , $BRC , $DECK , $HRL , $DXC , $LXFT , $GPS , $LGF-A , $MDT , $NTNX , $RY , $QSII , $SAFM , $ROST , $THR , $SCVL , $TTC , $SPLK , $TD , $VEEV , $VSAT , $YRD , $ZOES http://crweworld.com/Earnings-Calendar"
"want to move on HRL again start with large first tranche, but no cooperation from hfc and bots. just no hope yet for low 40's family trust funds can't take a flyer at 47 or 45. of course, you know better so guess you better pick up your first 5K sh today. wait, you're broke and can't. well, keep strong with comments then."
I wish Hormel would stop buying companies and stock pile some cash or increase the dividend.
Meat processing business is getting hurt by 2 ways!1. Shutdowninfect=No Production2.VaccineReopen=Nobody wants to eat SPAM chemical mix
"Here's a tip for you David. Check the dividend. Buy at 2%, sell at 1.9%. Clockwork."
I finally found a use for spam that I don't recommend. As an ice cream topping. it's much better fried on a sandwich with lettuce and pickles.
"Great company, just look at total return for the past 20-30 years averaging around 12% per year. Up 25% this year alone. Be a buyer for long term and be happy."
"This stock has made me money in both good and bad times. It is by far the best performing stock on Wall Street right now besides maybe Walmart. I am in love with this stock. The dividend is stable, has been consistently raised throughout the years, and is projected to a grow at a whopping 8 percent over the next few years. Demand for their products is inelastic, etc. What's not to like? I only wish I owned more of it."
This will recover faster than it normally does.
Back up nicely thus far.
this is a 70.00 stock
Is $46 a good entry?
"Based on my chart analysis, this stock shows bearish signals; even the execs are selling. Expect a downturn"
"Highest price in 5 years only $51 bucks. Price has dropped 5% past 30 days. P/E 28 not great. Good products, but I will pass on Hormel"
They get bought and taken private within 12 months. Like Smithfield. Ride along.
Next order $42.33
Why is there no Oscar Meyer products on the shelf at Walmart? Supply issue?
Near 52 week high. Onwards and upwards.
what is going on with this yahoo message board some of the post are over a month old
"I liked HRL but recently sold out, which could be a mistake. However, Jennie-O is proving to be a continuing mistake by HRL management. Processed turkey is just as harmful as other processed meats. Five years ago the profit on turkey was 23% so, that seemed good then. Now there is a glut of turkey. HRL"
No negative news yet!
Traded basically sideways for 2 1/2 years. Somebody please wake these guys up and let them know the stock market is leaving without them!
Hormel Foods is up 4.92% to 49.23
I love this Anonymous guy. Change your name so U can identify you. You crack me up breh!
I've been watching awhile now. I bought in back in the low 30's. Sold near 40 and it had some ups and down and I bought in again and now its at 45. This company raises its dividend every year like clockwork and make acquisitions of pretty large proportions on a regular basis. This is just wishful thinking but based on previous track record I am hoping for a split in 2021
It's been a rough year for our stock. It'll be nice to get back to our regular performance!
Love the stock; but getting a bit over-anxious for the next split. Any thoughts?
Longer shelf life; Spam or this stock?
"Spam, special sale today only in Piggly Wiggly"
"This is the stock to buy during disasters. However, people buy Spam to save it just for when there are no fresh meat around. TSN is better to buy right now."
Hormel chilli. It's the only food in the world that looks the same going in as it does coming out. Great business model.
Hold hold buy hold show em who's boss!!.. oh wrong thread lolololololol go pepperoni and spam! And bacon! Yes BACON HORMEL!!!
What’s the deal here.
Dead money. Low 40s is about where this stodgy stock should trade.
"if you are ever feeling down about a food stock, like this one or any other you own, just go to ""world population clock"" and you will feel VERY confident about the future prices of food stocks- remember, if people don't eat, they will die."
the turkeys at a major turkey farm are endorsing spam for Christmas dinner
i found out my grandson is addicted to their pepperoni- eats it instead of candy-who knew.
I did not realize Hormel owns Dinty Moore beef stew! I love that stuff. Did you guys see tha Applewood smoked bacon? I am obsessed with Applewood flavor.
Is it time to replace upper management? Terrible performance for shareholders.
What a beautiful stock…gonna be a great Q4 with all those turkeys 
Guess nobody loves a great value stock anymore. HRL not flashy but consistent and stable. Don't know what they need to do to get this stock moving. Stuck in neutral unfortunately. Great products though!
This stock seems to always go down in price.
Hormel Foods Corporation (HRL)Annual Report Available on 10-Khttps://sec.report/Document/0000048465-19-000057/
Wow never looked at the conversations on hrl before . So many from one guy. So strange
https://traders-ideas.com/winningscalls
I hope the next earnings report is better than expected from people having less money and also wanting to store foods with shelf life. Did they announce the divi increase yet?
Technical analysis makes no sense without fundamental analysis and the current environment factor! HRL is below 49 on Monday! The broad market is big green next week! There are tons of discounted great deals out there for institutions before the discounted price gone!
Haven't been this low since Feb/Mar of '20. Time to reload.
"Ha!!!!! CRTD just got in the Mac and Cheese game !!!! We sneakin veggies into your kids food now. Were making you healthy. Gluten free you pastry eatin' chicken clucks.

I have general mills. I am thinking if I should buy HRL. any opinions?
40 hit. Beautiful thing to see.
Screamin short.....
Established food company. People gotta eat no matter what. It’s a buy! No brained!
"Glad I do not depend on equity research companies for investment advice;....if you know the company I'm speaking about..... Hormel will continue to grow and strive as a result of sound fundamentals ,an excellent product line and a visionary approach to consumption."
Steady dividend vehicle
Big earnings miss today. Is this another buying opportunity or do we head to $30?
What a beautiful stock dividend play at these levels…maybe it will drop below $40 so I can continue to load up
$44.00 executed!
"New high hit today. Wonderful for us longs. FYI, I am the original Roy that regularly posts."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrnT7DxwYDo ..... HRL + Top 2021 Gainer AABB. = $$$ ??
spam is food of the gods
Bought up puts easy win come earnings
seems very plateaued.
"The CEO said that SPAM sales are ""on fire"" during this pandemic and on pace for a sixth consecutive year of record sales! Combine that with other popular products such as Skippy peanut butter, sound fundamentals, and this looks like a great buy."
This company would probably do better. If they would produce more product!
when will this split? In the past anytime it hits these numbers they split.
"David, David, David, I was hoping you would be right this time, I have been looking to get back in at a bargain price but it just won't give it to me."
This is not a short term gainer. The dividend is like clockwork and it typically also increases a small amount each year. It grows steadily over time and then seems to split and that is where the gains come in. Hoping it splits this winter. With this drop in price it could be a time to ad.
Playin kick the Spam right now in the street. CAR!!!
"Let’s go management, the market is treating Hormel as a totally defensive stock. Let’s be positive. Being green is great, but remember green is also the color of money"
"Horrible chart and sentiment on this name. High 30s coming soon, before stock can put in a base and then turn around..."
"This is an excellent long-hold stock, product is superior, manage is very good, cash flow is plus...buy and hold."
someone has been averaging down nicely. think it can trade between the 47-47.50 next week due to options open interest?
EAT SPAM AND LIVE FOREVER!!!
Why are we dropping off today 1/24?
Got some at $41.78
I love this stock!!!
Always bet on Spam
When will this stock start moving up? Good management team and products.
Everyone's having a good time cooking at home now!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jx7QERoVty4
"Wait until after the earnings to buy, the entire packeged food sector has been slammed. While record sales did appear for many of HRL's competitors like Tyson and Sysco, it was isolated to only the grocery segemnt of their buisness. Tyson saw 30-40% sales growth in consumer groceries, but a 25% drop in foodservice revanue. That differnce was enough to cause a total 15% loss of income for the quarter. Same thing with Sysco. The loss in the foodservice industry is simply too great to overshadow. 3 quarters from now this will be above the $50 line for sure as restauraunts and production plant open again, but as for earnings tommrow (5/21), the numbers don't lie."
Why do we continue to go down after good earnings? $34.30 now wow! Looks like a good entry here.
David and Cas while on Hormel bashing tour.
What a beautiful stock!
Next order $43.25
Can't find bacon flavored spam! somebody's not doing their job!
Very interested in this company
Hopefully institutions don’t take profit too fast! Let us longs exit first
Like what this stock has been doing lately. Keep moving up slow and steady and I will continue to be happy.
"Spam, tastes even better after a nuclear be blast"
When is this stock going to gain some positive growth? It has been sitting around these numbers for sometime!
Glad I got in today at $46. I will average down when there is blood in the water
Looking good for higher prices. Looking for breakout at 38.42 for a run up to 47.84. Buy rating: 7 at 9trading
"HRL might earn $2, but the PE should be about 15, so HRL is over-priced at $36. Soybean prices up, therefore, HRL costs are up. The tax cut will help profits, but $2 per year is the high end seem to me. Revenue is flat, and the outlook is likely to be not very rosy due to cost increases (labor, feed, transportation). Going to $30 is likely."
12% dividend increase. This stock keeps getting better. Stay the course long term.
I don't see anything in the news about HRL and it is up over 3% and the market is down 3%???
"Food Stocks are the Tech Stocks of the future. Right now, people clamor to buy iPhones, laptops,etc, in a few years, after the world population goes over 8 billion , people will be clamoring to buy food. P.S. i am sure you heard those news reports saying Bill Gates has been buying up farmland.Out of all the food stocks, HRL and ADM are my two favorites."
I like Spam!
I am drinking a Steel Reserve 211 42oz beer on the can. How awesome is that?
Hormel is a very stable company. The company has a quick ration of 1.9 and a current ratio of 3.00 of cash & accounts receivables to current liabilities. The companies overall profit margin of 9% is not bad but trailing some other food companies. The thing that is slowing the growth of Hormel and it's stock price is growth in sales. The company pays out 57.3% of cash in dividends. This company is stable.
"Here we go, we just need more volume."
"Hormel will beat earnings, buy now."
this runs to 60 after ER
Hurricane in Hawaii should have a big run on Spam. Spam is a big seller in Hawaii. up it goes
"who was that masked man? it was Spam, the guardian of the Galaxy"
Great buying opportunity today!
"be charitable, send a case if spam to the Grand poo pa of Isis"
"Technically speaking, this scrip has crossed an important barrier last week. Can hold for long term."
Resistance point has been $38.00. The real question is whether HRL closes above that point today.
I bought some Spam in the Habib mart today no joke. Smoked Spam. That's what it says. It's so #$%# good. I love this company.
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nia87no6uJ4 ... HRL + ALPP... 11 Companies in 1..Up 7,700 % Yr..??"
Buy more Spam.
Media should mention Skippy Peanut Butter is also a Hormel brand....and they never do.
What a beautiful stock with a beautiful dividend growth rate!
"Our resident Debbie downer David is back. Right on cue. Cas is right on his heels. The sky is falling since it dropped a couple bucks. The sky is not falling and it is simply consolidating a bit after this run. After this consolidation, it will go higher. I strongly doubt we see 35."
"Hormel honestly has such clean financials, and all signs to this company being fundamentally undervalued at the current price point. Future economic catalysts include worsened economic conditions which will lead to an uptick in demand for Hormel products."
