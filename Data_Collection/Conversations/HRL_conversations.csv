"Hormel honestly has such clean financials, and all signs to this company being fundamentally undervalued at the current price point. Future economic catalysts include worsened economic conditions which will lead to an uptick in demand for Hormel products."
"David, David, David, I was hoping you would be right this time, I have been looking to get back in at a bargain price but it just won't give it to me."
"want to move on HRL again start with large first tranche, but no cooperation from hfc and bots. just no hope yet for low 40's family trust funds can't take a flyer at 47 or 45. of course, you know better so guess you better pick up your first 5K sh today. wait, you're broke and can't. well, keep strong with comments then."
"Spam is awesome. The stock might not be performing, but Spam is still the GOAT!"
Perhaps a short-term pull back is more likely before the next rally on HRL? have you guys heard of awe-someSTOCKS. i started receiving their allerts and so far i am happy.
Hopefully institutions don’t take profit too fast! Let us longs exit first
market down almost 200 points but hormel is up...ha ha ha
"Why is this stock such a dog? Great products, and there is a need!"
"Wait until after the earnings to buy, the entire packeged food sector has been slammed. While record sales did appear for many of HRL's competitors like Tyson and Sysco, it was isolated to only the grocery segemnt of their buisness. Tyson saw 30-40% sales growth in consumer groceries, but a 25% drop in foodservice revanue. That differnce was enough to cause a total 15% loss of income for the quarter. Same thing with Sysco. The loss in the foodservice industry is simply too great to overshadow. 3 quarters from now this will be above the $50 line for sure as restauraunts and production plant open again, but as for earnings tommrow (5/21), the numbers don't lie."
Love the stock; but getting a bit over-anxious for the next split. Any thoughts?
HRL reached a new 52 Week High at $45.59
Where is tha funny guy here?
Hormel looks like a buy at these levels. 10.5 % Off sale ............GL
"Hormel, set it and forget it. Retirement stock."
Wow never looked at the conversations on hrl before . So many from one guy. So strange
Hormel is a very stable company. The company has a quick ration of 1.9 and a current ratio of 3.00 of cash & accounts receivables to current liabilities. The companies overall profit margin of 9% is not bad but trailing some other food companies. The thing that is slowing the growth of Hormel and it's stock price is growth in sales. The company pays out 57.3% of cash in dividends. This company is stable.
"Announcing dividend increase on the day before earnings, and after hours on top of that, suggests desperation to prop up share price, before likely very #$%$ earnings announced."
when will this split? In the past anytime it hits these numbers they split.

"if you are ever feeling down about a food stock, like this one or any other you own, just go to ""world population clock"" and you will feel VERY confident about the future prices of food stocks- remember, if people don't eat, they will die."
bit expensive
Fails on earnings expectations

"HRL due for a haircut, just like TSN. PE 25 exceeds industry norms (PE 10 to 17)See you in the high $30s tomorrow."
Will hit 40+ in the coming days/weeks.
"Let’s go management, the market is treating Hormel as a totally defensive stock. Let’s be positive. Being green is great, but remember green is also the color of money"
"This is an excellent long-hold stock, product is superior, manage is very good, cash flow is plus...buy and hold."
Haven't been this low since Feb/Mar of '20. Time to reload.
You guys miss me? I love SPAM. I am SPAM. Spam goes in and out with the same consistency. Gross but I love it.
"Hormel will beat earnings, buy now."
Hurricane in Hawaii should have a big run on Spam. Spam is a big seller in Hawaii. up it goes

HRL reached a new 52 Week High at 40.76
HRL needs topline growth to reach new ATHs as revenue has been stagnant for the past few years.
Buy more Spam.
Boom  $43.50 order executed!
Dead money. Low 40s is about where this stodgy stock should trade.
I've been watching awhile now. I bought in back in the low 30's. Sold near 40 and it had some ups and down and I bought in again and now its at 45. This company raises its dividend every year like clockwork and make acquisitions of pretty large proportions on a regular basis. This is just wishful thinking but based on previous track record I am hoping for a split in 2021
I am drinking a Steel Reserve 211 42oz beer on the can. How awesome is that?
Can someone explain why HRL deserves a PE of 24 when peers have PE closer to 15 or less?
I finally found a use for spam that I don't recommend. As an ice cream topping. it's much better fried on a sandwich with lettuce and pickles.
I found a new island to hide on. It's a volcanic island spewing chili. Hormel is my home now. Chili and Spam.
What a beautiful stock
Looking good for higher prices. Looking for breakout at 38.42 for a run up to 47.84. Buy rating: 7 at 9trading

someone has been averaging down nicely. think it can trade between the 47-47.50 next week due to options open interest?

It’s turkey  time! Jennie-O …let’s goooooooooooo
"After a pretty good quarter, the stock is down while the market is up. Think Hormel has an investor relations problem? Terrible."
Traded basically sideways for 2 1/2 years. Somebody please wake these guys up and let them know the stock market is leaving without them!
This chart is ridiculous btw. I want to kiss management. Lets be honest there products are not exactly top notch. Most people don't know what is in them. But they make a billion dollars year after year. Amaze-ballz.
$HRL great long stock!
Hormel chilli. It's the only food in the world that looks the same going in as it does coming out. Great business model.
Planters is a shell company!
Will buy when p/e = 15
We were doing so good.
Back up nicely thus far.
"This stock has made me money in both good and bad times. It is by far the best performing stock on Wall Street right now besides maybe Walmart. I am in love with this stock. The dividend is stable, has been consistently raised throughout the years, and is projected to a grow at a whopping 8 percent over the next few years. Demand for their products is inelastic, etc. What's not to like? I only wish I owned more of it."
11% of float shares are short. margins look good. current ratio is good. The huge short ratio seems to be proving out with the price direction. Dividend is modest 2%. Think I will pass for some diversified closed end funds instead.
Is it time to replace upper management? Terrible performance for shareholders.
This stock seems to always go down in price.
Hormel Foods Corporation (HRL)Annual Report Available on 10-Khttps://sec.report/Document/0000048465-19-000057/
"HRL might earn $2, but the PE should be about 15, so HRL is over-priced at $36. Soybean prices up, therefore, HRL costs are up. The tax cut will help profits, but $2 per year is the high end seem to me. Revenue is flat, and the outlook is likely to be not very rosy due to cost increases (labor, feed, transportation). Going to $30 is likely."
"Here we go, we just need more volume."
Got some at $41.78
HRL is up 4.95% to 44.40
"Apparently, there's been some trouble at the plant. CNN is reporting that the weenies blew up Crematorium #3."
Like what this stock has been doing lately. Keep moving up slow and steady and I will continue to be happy.
40 hit. Beautiful thing to see.
"Our resident Debbie downer David is back. Right on cue. Cas is right on his heels. The sky is falling since it dropped a couple bucks. The sky is not falling and it is simply consolidating a bit after this run. After this consolidation, it will go higher. I strongly doubt we see 35."
I'm curious what the planters acuisition will add to the value.
I love this Anonymous guy. Change your name so U can identify you. You crack me up breh!
I don't see anything in the news about HRL and it is up over 3% and the market is down 3%???
"Hormel has a history of excellence, it will continue to shine..... good company ,good products, good management...a safe and profitable investment."
Beautiful buy here at $41.00

"This is the stock to buy during disasters. However, people buy Spam to save it just for when there are no fresh meat around. TSN is better to buy right now."
Dividend King 
I did not realize Hormel owns Dinty Moore beef stew! I love that stuff. Did you guys see tha Applewood smoked bacon? I am obsessed with Applewood flavor.
"Ha!!!!! CRTD just got in the Mac and Cheese game !!!! We sneakin veggies into your kids food now. Were making you healthy. Gluten free you pastry eatin' chicken clucks.

"who was that masked man? it was Spam, the guardian of the Galaxy"
I have big gains in this company. I bought it for safety but got way more than I bargained for. Not buying anymore here but I'm going to hold onto my position.
Doing end of month review. This low key stock has made me 24% in first 4 months. Holding a core position and selling calls and puts $1-$2 out of money. Every week. Besides it has quarterly divy. Did the same with another boring stock - CAHI got CALLed out of CAH but not before booking 17% profit in 2 months. Looking to get back in CAH (around $55) as well and sell weekly Calls and Puts. Long term HRL is here to stay and make investors money.
What a beautiful stock…gonna be a great Q4 with all those turkeys 
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nia87no6uJ4 ... HRL + ALPP... 11 Companies in 1..Up 7,700 % Yr..??"
The cash flow model says the stock is at a 17% discount to fair value. That implies the stock should be trading closer to $48.50.
Does anyone else love planters honey roasted peanuts on their hickory smoked spam!
"Hormel is a stable company with great management. I love that the company headquarters and management team are in a small town of 26,000 in southern Minnesota. (Austin) Managements children go to the same school as the SPAM line workers."
Anyone know who changes stock price when data does not support the change. It is stock manupulation fraud as I see it. HRL did that on Friday and into Monday.
Technical analysis makes no sense without fundamental analysis and the current environment factor! HRL is below 49 on Monday! The broad market is big green next week! There are tons of discounted great deals out there for institutions before the discounted price gone!
Next order $43.75
Large short interest in HRL. The big boys bet this stock is going down.
When will this stock start moving up? Good management team and products.
Longer shelf life; Spam or this stock?
i found out my grandson is addicted to their pepperoni- eats it instead of candy-who knew.

I invested here because stag chili is hands down the best
Very interested in this company
"Hey Hormel, if you're listening, send me a case of Spam! Take care of your shareholders!"
Hormel Foods is down 7.24% to 39.33
Bought @ $43.31
I like Spam!
We have been in a downtrend for 15 months at this point. The last pullback in HRL lasted 20 months before going on a multi-year run! We are getting closer to the reversal and investments at this point will be handsomely rewarded!
This is not a short term gainer. The dividend is like clockwork and it typically also increases a small amount each year. It grows steadily over time and then seems to split and that is where the gains come in. Hoping it splits this winter. With this drop in price it could be a time to ad.
Resistance point has been $38.00. The real question is whether HRL closes above that point today.
Hormel Foods is up 4.92% to 49.23
this runs to 60 after ER
Big earnings miss today. Is this another buying opportunity or do we head to $30?
What a beautiful stock dividend play at these levels…maybe it will drop below $40 so I can continue to load up
Guess nobody loves a great value stock anymore. HRL not flashy but consistent and stable. Don't know what they need to do to get this stock moving. Stuck in neutral unfortunately. Great products though!
Always bet on Spam
What a beautiful stock 
"Spam, tastes even better after a nuclear be blast"
spam is food of the gods
#HRL Indicators are looking bullish at stoxline. On watch for clear above 37.22. Target: 43.47.
They get bought and taken private within 12 months. Like Smithfield. Ride along.
"I liked HRL but recently sold out, which could be a mistake. However, Jennie-O is proving to be a continuing mistake by HRL management. Processed turkey is just as harmful as other processed meats. Five years ago the profit on turkey was 23% so, that seemed good then. Now there is a glut of turkey. HRL"
Is $46 a good entry?
Shareholders of record will be receiving a SPCI dividend from Hormel this qtr of one case of spam original sent to the address on file. I heard.
No negative news yet!
Bought up puts easy win come earnings
"Rough day for holders, great day for shorts!"
Toro!
I wish Hormel would stop buying companies and stock pile some cash or increase the dividend.
Hold hold buy hold show em who's boss!!.. oh wrong thread lolololololol go pepperoni and spam! And bacon! Yes BACON HORMEL!!!
https://traders-ideas.com/winningscalls
12% dividend increase. This stock keeps getting better. Stay the course long term.
Great buying opportunity today!
"Bought at $43.25, $43, and $42.75"
I think I know why stock is falling -- the market is concerned that new Trump policies will result in deportation of a majority of Hormel's work force. Hiring legal citizens will raise HRL labor costs.
Doing my research the owners feel very confident in this company seeming how they have loss millions and continue to buy more when the price drops. This could be Bullish
Great SHORT.
"Other stocks are getting destroyed in this huge market drop. HRL has barely dropped in comparison, which illustrates its strong defensive characteristics. Circus performers David and Cas will say or do anything to get you to sell your shares. Ignore these paid bashers."
Next order $42.33
Screamin short.....
"New high hit today. Wonderful for us longs. FYI, I am the original Roy that regularly posts."
this is a 70.00 stock
This will recover faster than it normally does.
Glad I got in today at $46. I will average down when there is blood in the water
Near 52 week high. Onwards and upwards.
sold the few shares I had today at 11% increase. I will be back at some point as I really Liked HRL. I know if I had held a few more weeks I would have gotten the divi but I didn't own very many shares.
this will become a 60 to 70 dollar a share stock shortly in my opinion..They just introduced vegetarian pepperoni for instance and they bought some of Planters Peanuts. Peanuts are a rich source of protein
"The CEO said that SPAM sales are ""on fire"" during this pandemic and on pace for a sixth consecutive year of record sales! Combine that with other popular products such as Skippy peanut butter, sound fundamentals, and this looks like a great buy."
Steady dividend vehicle
HRL at 33 and then HRL will cause my attention. too many other staples offering bargains. ymmv.
What a beautiful stock with a beautiful dividend growth rate!
Hormel is overvalued... not the worst pkg food holding but way down on the list
I can expect this poor stock performance from CAG & BGS? Whats going on here?It must mean the market does NOT like the peanut deal.
Quality all the way with relevant brands positioned to grow in value over time. Hormel Foods is the perfect company to keep long term. A true winner.
HRL is one of my favorite dividend growth stocks. I talk about dividend growth stocks on my youtube channel. The channel is really focused on new and beginner investors looking to invest in dividend growth stocks and ETFs. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrg6IDPf4a7pUKTN90n6syg

I'm seeking a way to purchase the first share of HRL w/o using a broker. HRL requires owning one share to enter their DSPP plan. Any sugestions???

HRL reached a new 52 Week High at 39.04
Established food company. People gotta eat no matter what. It’s a buy! No brained!
Why do we continue to go down after good earnings? $34.30 now wow! Looks like a good entry here.
"Hormel is solid. Buy on this dip, you will make money."
Interesting it has a negative Beta.It is rarely seen..
I hope the next earnings report is better than expected from people having less money and also wanting to store foods with shelf life. Did they announce the divi increase yet?
Cramer just wore a mask with spam pr
What’s the deal here.
"Hormel will close out the year the end of October,there is always a big push to sell and collect;additionally, the company is gearing up for the Holidays.Hang tight and you will see a considrable increase in stock price over the next couple of months."

I have general mills. I am thinking if I should buy HRL. any opinions?
Hormel buying Planters Peanuts for 3 billion dollars! That's not peanuts!
Media should mention Skippy Peanut Butter is also a Hormel brand....and they never do.
This stock went down Friday for no reason. How did Chinese tariffs news made it go down ? I sold out just like some others.
"Based on my chart analysis, this stock shows bearish signals; even the execs are selling. Expect a downturn"
What a beautiful stock!
"Food Stocks are the Tech Stocks of the future. Right now, people clamor to buy iPhones, laptops,etc, in a few years, after the world population goes over 8 billion , people will be clamoring to buy food.

"Here's a tip for you David. Check the dividend. Buy at 2%, sell at 1.9%. Clockwork."
"This is a great stock that was hammered by the virus, but will be fantastic over time. It's the kind of stock you buy and keep, just reinvesting your dividends and growing them until you need them after retirement. This is not a speculative play. Plus, Spam!"
"That said, the company envisions earnings in the range of $1.77-$1.91 in fiscal 2019. Give a generous PE of 20, put the stock sub-$40."
Hormel Foods is down 5.16% to 40.09

Laid some strips of Spam on my face. Hello Clarice...
This company would probably do better. If they would produce more product!
"Hormel will be around for the next hundred years plus, selling quality products, with excellent margins, and making money. The rise is steady ,the results, and dividends support my opinion, not to mention acquisitions. I feel the company is a very solid investment and safe haven."
"I am either going to be rich, or eating SPAM the rest of my life, maybe both!"
HORMEL needs to a make an acquisition and diversity they need a new life in the product line. either that they should put the company for sale
Going all in today on this dividend aristocrat!

It's been a rough year for our stock. It'll be nice to get back to our regular performance!
I bought some Spam in the Habib mart today no joke. Smoked Spam. That's what it says. It's so #$%# good. I love this company.

Maybe I can buy this under $40
