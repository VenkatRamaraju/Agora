"""LPL Faces Challenges as It Mulls Alternatives4:57 pm ET October 12, 2016 (Dow Jones) By Michael WursthornLPL Financial Holdings Inc.'s decision to explore a possible sale underscores how brokerages that rely heavily on commissions are struggling with how to comply with and make a profit under new rules governing retirement savers.LPL, the biggest of the so-called independent brokerages with more than 14,000 advisers, faces big challenges in the coming months once new rules requiring brokers to put the interests of retirement savers ahead of their own begin to take effect in April. Independent firms, whose brokers are independent contractors who own their own practices but pay the brokerage for various services, already operate under tight profit margins, and the new retirement rules are expected to squeeze them even further, analysts and industry experts say.LPL's net profit margin at the end of June was around 4.8%. Expenses around complying with the rule and shrinking revenue tied to commission-based retirement accounts are expected to weigh on that, according to analysts.""The entire wealth-management industry is facing massive revenue erosion of about $20 billion of the next few years,"" said Uday Singh, a partner in the financial services practice of consulting firm A.T. Kearney. ""Independent brokerages will be the hardest hit. They'll see a 20% decline in their revenue base.""LPL is considering strategic alternatives, including a possible sale of the firm, and is being advised by Goldman Sachs Group Inc., according to a person familiar with the matter. Reuters earlier reported on LPL's sale process. ..."" (Google the author and title toread the balance of the article, but you get the idea)"
