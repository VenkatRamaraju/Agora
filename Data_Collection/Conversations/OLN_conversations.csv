This is such a classic move to the $60s it give me such a warm fuzzy feeling when strong hands are moving it. In other news its the Wild West with Trumps media stocks DWAC/ PHUM playing with house money on those.
"With an earnings beat and the market wanting to go higher into the end of the year, after this consolidation since July we could see $70 EOY. Long with stock and options "
Resistance at 50.65. A move in trading above this at the close could be the move to the $60s has started.

What’s up with the big drop today?
Abulurd sell today I want your shares sweetie.
Nice volume this morning breaking a new 52 week high. $60s is coming
What can I say this is boring after buying a big block of DWAC yesterday at $10.80. Some very smart people are here excluding me but at least OLN will pay my beer tab this weekend.
Nice bounce off the day low under 47.50 on some decent volume. It will be interesting to see how this trades Tuesday after a 3 day break when new money is put work. Economy is opening up despite what the media is saying you can go massive size concerts and even watch a tennis match in NYC. This is more about using up vaccines in the USA then actual Cov data.
"$OLN maker of winchester ammo, is on a tear. Glad I loaded up on the dip yesterday. And $swbi is on the move too. Feeling green today, hope it sicks."
Predicated institutional move on earnings day it’s like watching paint dry.. Disappointing they did not raise the dividend but at least they are buying shares back .Sticking around it might pop on the bill compromise.
"The chemical maker’s revenues surged 62.8% year over year to $2,340.1 million in the (3rd) quarter."
Olin is up 5.40% to 54.35
Is anyone aware of a technical reason for why this won't go/stay over $50? I can't think of a reason.
