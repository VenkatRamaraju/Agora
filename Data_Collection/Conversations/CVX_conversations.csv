"Everyone wants price appreciation in CVX, but I'm here for the dividend. Owning this stock has to be about the long game. I'm ignoring all the ""world is going electric"" BS, as long as China is drinking up all it can get hold of."
We are sitting right at the 200 MDA today and its ex dividend day. I added at $98.45

Did I step In Front Of A Train Last Week. This Stock Is Dropping Like A ROCK.! What Did I Miss.??
Any idea about price tomorrow? up or down?
why is oil crumbling?
"Who bought CVX recently will be very happy!PUBLISHED SAT, AUG 28 20213:07 PM EDTOil firms slash U.S. Gulf of Mexico output by 91% ahead of powerful Hurricane Ida"
Oil is so plentiful we just had to sell 20 million barrels out of reserves...Or is it not quite as plentiful as they want us to believe
"Boom, there it is, 93.60 wish me luck!"
bought it last week.
CVX CRM BA are on CNBC a minute ago - FYI!
cvx thanks for my dividends.
Let's see if sleepy Joe asks OPEC for more Free Oil this coming week. LoL
"I wish I could get excited about the energy market right now, but the fundamentals just aren't there yet. I guess I could take a gamble that demand will pick up, but I'll wait until they can show me the money. Right now I'm writing DOTM XLE puts, which has CVX and XOM as their largest holdings and playing the energy sector that way."
Crude oil prices surged and nary a whisper.
"got in at 95,got my div. will sell at 120.00."
"its all about the virus delaying the re opening. simple supply n demand. hopefully, virus peaks in a couple weeks and the re opening commences. oil will go from high 60's to the 70's and 80's. By summer of 2021, $100 per barrel is real and oil stock will be up 30%. That's my guess."
"It's weird, when oil was at middle 70s, CVX went into a slide and now oil is going down and it's still going down. What needs to happen for it to go up. Had great earnings and still continued going down. I took profits at 113 and collected the dividend for a year. I exited today because it looks like its stock price is going back to the 80s."
We need more oil ..... not Ego Musk and his hype and lies.
"Those who think the price of this stock is directly tied to the price of WTI is in lala land. Were it that simple, we’d all be oil tycoons"
May see $95 - $96 tomorrow guys....oil is up 60c/barrel!
Back to $111 soon guys!
Can anyone tell me why 93 and change is not a good entry point?
"This week will see CVX go up higher than it started last week. A combination if factors will make this likely: Pfizer full approval, supply down in US, demand will pick up in China and Saudi will CNN cut back enough to get the oil price back to 70 dollars. Lock in and watch oil go to 100 and Chevron go to 130 before year end. Count on it. Buffett is."
"WTI's weekly chart shows a ""Golden Cross"" - Only done that TWICE in 20 years!It is indicative of 20% to 50% oil price rally in the horizon.""A golden cross occurs when an asset’s shorter-term moving average crosses above its longer-term moving average and is broadly seen as a signal of further upside.""$OXY $CPE $RIG $OIH $SU $XOM $CVX $VET $EOG $CNQ $LPI $CLR $CDEV $CPGSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/26/oil-has-only-done-this-twice-in-20-years-it-could-mean-a-50-percent-rally.html"
#'s cases of covid-10 has been dropping significantly in the U.S last 5 days in a row so CVX BA will rise fast!
"HUGE spike Monday, with IDA in play…"
.......Xom in the Green and Your down under $100......Buy Xom for the win...
Oil is headed to 100. Golden cross is confirmed and it’s only happened in twenty years.
"dividend pay day 9/10, will add more shares."
"hello guys whats your price tag for the company? bought it last week, tech' i think 100.5 , however fund' i believe the oil sooner or later will reach 80$"
Oil is up huge…over 5% today. $65.23. Stock going higher from here. Too funny to read those ALL CAP end of the world and markets posts on a huge up day. LOL. Where else in this world would you put your money? Banks paying 0.1% ?
"What a difference a week makes. Or does it? Once the Delta spike levels off and rolls over the conversation will switch from “the sky is falling” to “the future looks bright”. Investors are fickle and always extrapolate current conditions into the future. Right now they can't look beyond Delta, they believe it will carry on well into the future when in reality it is going to peak and level off and that worry will subside. People will start to focus on fudamentals again. Oil prices don't need to be $80, at $60 to $70 oil companies are making good money and will continue to pay down debt, buy back stock and pay dividends. We are still well within that window. And more than likely once this Chicken Little fear induced sell off is over prices will stabilize and rise back into the $70's. If anything this will cause no new production to be pursued and it may even cause OPEC+ to pull back on increasing supply. The headwind of a rising dollar may persist, but longer term with our deficits we could see a structurally weaker dollar as Jeff Gundlach has pointed out ""the dollar is doomed""."
Who cares about retail sales ...... people still need to put gas in their tank and heat and cool their house.
"Chevron call volume above normal and directionally bullish (TheFlyOnTheWall)BY The Fly— 3:25 PM ET 08/17/2021Bullish option flow detected in Chevron ( CVX Loading...Loading...) with 45,762 calls trading, 2x expected, and implied vol increasing over 1 point to 25.40%. Sep-21 90 calls and Aug-21 95 calls are the most active options, with total volume in those strikes near 6,200 contracts. The Put/Call Ratio is 0.27. Earnings are expected on October 29th."
wrote Nov 115 calls in July at a 1.58 premium. Think of buying them back below .50 today wait for the stock to run back up in a week or so and then write them again.
"My thoughts: 1) The company's financials are in a much better position than before, with debt and operating costs significantly reduced. The share buyback program which was off before has restarted which will add to the price from now on. 2) The current price of oil isn't bad when considering the break-even price stated by the company, the limited supply available, and the inevitably increasing demand the more things re-open (Which are bound to, since even the most irresponsible governments have stated that they have no intention to kill off economic activity the way they did before). 3) Politically speaking, considering 'recent political events' in the US, there is an increasing chance of a more oil-positive administration once this term is over. 4) When it comes to energy transition, I genuinely don't think the Big Oil is caught sleeping. I think everyone who is a realist out there with basic understanding of engineering knows that the transition is not happening yet. When the time comes, with big pockets available, Big Oil will simply buy-out and partner with promising market leaders and out-bid the currently struggling transition-energy start ups and other companies. There have been complains about that already in some articles concerning mostly European oil companies. 5) Concluding, I see the fears exaggerated, and the future not near as grim as painted out to be. I will be happy to add and be there at the climb once the 50% up volume in short positions settles down. PS: I had to self-censor any politically related parts because my previous comment was deleted. I guess I should not be surprised that yahoo is not troubled by bitcoin bot comments, but deletes anything politically sensitive about the situation in the United States and 'you know who'. Sad."
"Chevron and BrightmarkE announce 2nd expansion of joint venture to own projects across the U.S. to produce and market dairy biomethane, a renewable natural gas (RNG). This boosts Chevron's objective to increase RNG volumes 10x by 2025 over 2020 volumes."
