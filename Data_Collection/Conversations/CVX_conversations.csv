I'm life long democrat but yesterday hearing made me determine to defeat the dangerous leftist extremists next November. It was so repulsive to observe such acting in front of the cameras. They didn't have any logical argument except throwing tobacco labels with no connection what so ever!!!!
Healthy inside pullback for CVX on a very bullish chart!
i bought some oil. The inflation is high and energy is shortage around the world... holiday travel....so it is worth taking some oil stocks
Cvx reported big profit and revenue beat. Shares only up $1. Puzzling market reaction.

CVX hits new 52-week high at $114.23!
Cramer said CVX had a dividend boost? what's he talking about?
I could give two s**ts about this quarters earnings. Maybe they will surprise...maybe not. Honestly don't care. I didn't buy this for now. Laredo is in a transition stage. I bought this for mid/long term. 2022 & beyond. Oil is staying high for the foreseeable future. You can take that to the bank. I want to see what they have to say for hedge prices & percentage that is being hedged. 2022 has potential to be a monster year for LPI. If natural gas stays high as well that is just icing on the cake. $LPI $CPE $FANG $CVX

"If $XOM was trading at the same multiple as $CVX, the price should have been $73 today. And $CVX is undervalued today, it should more be trading at $140+."

"Instead of buying back shares (no more financial engineering please!!), how about issuing a special dividend to all those loyal stockholders who held and added to their positions during the so called pandemic??!! Now that would kick CVX's price up at least 5% or more!!!!"

"The next two weeks are very big for all of us. Tons of earnings coming up. Congratulations for all those who continued to buy over the past three years.

"Wow $8.7B in FCF with $70 oil in Q2. With $82 oil and basically no hedge in place , shall we assume $12B in Q4? And with $12B in FCF should't the company have a market cap of at least $400B?"
I thank Biden for keeping the oil prices high and the oil companies in business.

"“Congressman, our products are taxed, not subsidized,” Chevron CEO Michael Wirth responded. “And I can tell you that a number of the policies that get described as subsidies are very similar to those available to other industries and other companies, and they're important for American energy security, American energy investments, and American energy supply.”Mike Wirth is my new Hero!"

Best in eighth years?! We should be getting ATHs with Chevron…cmon!
"""Crude prices continue to rise and pleas to OPEC to increase production continue to fall on deaf ears. The only thing that will get OPEC+ motivated is if private U.S. operators signal, they will increase production,"" said Edward Moya, senior market analysts at OANDA, noting ""a jump to $90 oil seems likely.""Goldman Sachs said Brent was likely to push above its year-end forecast of $90 a barrel, while Larry Fink, chief executive of the world's largest asset manager BlackRock, said there was a high probability of oil reaching $100."
"Blackstone Inc. co-founder Stephen Schwarzman said the world is facing energy shortages so severe they could cause social unrest.His comments were echoed by Larry Fink, who said there’s a high probability of oil soon reaching $100 a barrel, especially with many governments and investors pushing back against investments in fossil fuels.“Inflation, we are in a new regime,” said Fink, chairman of BlackRock Inc, the world’s biggest asset manager.“There are many structural reasons for that. Short term policy related to environmentalism, in terms of restricting supply of hydrocarbons, has created energy inflation and we are going to be living with that for some time.”Several analysts have said that European countries could halt gas exports to neighbors if winter’s colder than normal and prices keep rising.$SU $CNQ $ENB $COP $BP $OXY $VET $XOM $TOT $CVX $MPC $EOG $CLR $EPD $E $KMI $PSX $HAL $PTR $SNP $WMB $BKR $EC $IMO $CQP $MMP $TRP $XOG"

"$3B in net earnings increase vs Q2 with $5bb Brent price increase (up from $69/b to $74/b see slide 20 of Q3 presentation). Assuming $85/b in Q4 I would not be surprised to see another $6B increase in net earnings or $12B net income in Q4. If we multiply times 4 quarters, at 10 PE we would have a market cap of $480B or $247/share. There is something terribly wrong in how the market is undervaluing Chevron (and other big oil), also considering that oil price will probably keep increasing."
CVX is the gold standard of oil stocks. Have owned it for years.
"U.S. refiners set for higher earnings on fuel demand strengthBY Reuters— 1:00 AM ET 10/18/2021By Laura SanicolaOct 18 (Reuters) - U.S. refiners are expected to show higher earnings for the third quarter as margins to sell gasoline and diesel have improved despite the surging cost of crude oil, analysts said.After more than a year of depressed fuel demand, gasoline and distillate consumption is back in line with five-year averages in the United States, the world's largest fuel consumer. That has boosted margins on refined products to more than double what those companies were making at this time a year ago"

Thank you CVX for the growth and dividend and also for the production of cleanest oil and gas in the world.
Anybody see what the CEO Jack Dorsey has said! Expecting hyperinflation and we are going to get it good in this sector. Reminds me of 2006 all over again!!
