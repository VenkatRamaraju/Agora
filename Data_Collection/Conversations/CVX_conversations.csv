"Warning: Environmental activists may be hazardous to your health.The IEA (International Energy Agency) and the activists that support it simply don’t understand the dangerous path they’re pursuing.They see a problem that they want to solve (climate change) using supply and demand and they’ve chosen to attack the SUPPLY side (big oil) with no regard for the demand side (energy for us to survive).This strategy is appropriate for vices like smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol (because they’re not required to live) but not for essential commodities like food and energy.Here, on the east coast of the US. there is an ongoing fuel shortage caused by the shutdown of the Colonial pipeline. Now imagine that the activists get their way and fossil fuels are unavailable because energy companies were forced to go out of business after exploration and extraction were outlawed...Sure, it’s easy to say that renewables are the solution when the simple reality is that they’re not (yet anyway).Just to be clear, I fully support green energy and a transition away from fossil fuels as quickly as possible; but, that change MUST be accomplished by reducing the DEMAND for fossil fuels by making alternative, renewable energy more affordable, practical, and easily available.The activist’s reckless strategy is both foolish (they literally can’t see the forest for the trees) and unwarranted (fossil fuel providers adjust output to meet demand already). And companies which rely upon fossil fuels (and that includes the electric grid) must be able to continue unabated at supplying our modern world’s energy needs until the time those fuels are no longer required (and not one minute before).Frankly, I’m appalled by the tyrannical approach of these narcissistic pundits: which is analogous to ending world hunger through starvation and death rather than providing new sources of food.Unfortunately the environmental activists have righteously declared themselves the HAMMER of change and big oil is the NAIL; but, it will be the rest of us who will have to bear the burden of that cross."
Great price to start buying back shares

"BARRONS 4/3/2020: ""For investors who want some exposure to oil and gas, Chevron (CVX) is the most attractive stock on a relative basis. Its balance sheet is strong enough to protect its 7% dividend yield and the company has made commitments to slow drilling and preserve cash. Should oil prices shudder again—a likely outcome—Chevron can continue on its current path. If other producers start looking to sell, the company should have enough capital to take advantage and possibly buy valuable acreage at a discount.“We’re focused on fortress balance sheets at companies that will survive,” says Jeff Wyll, an energy analyst at Neuberger Berman. “Chevron is one name—a survivor with a fortress balance sheet.”"

"Oil demand at new record as inventory rapidly declinesThu, July 8, 2021, 3:17 PMPavel Molchanov, Raymond James Energy Analyst, joins Yahoo Finance to discuss the OPEC+ meeting, demand in oil, and oil production.This is an excellent Video Transcript- I want to ask about US crude, if you think that we could see an uptick there in that production.PAVEL MOLCHANOV: Well as far as supply in the US and, indeed, just about anywhere outside of OPEC, that's not likely at all in the next six months. Capital budgets across the board this year by oil companies are the lowest they've been in decades. Maybe that will change in '22. We will find out at the end of the year.But as it stands, we're not looking for US supply or Brazilian supply or North Sea supply to pick up for quite a while. The entire industry is so fixated on discipline-- capital discipline, supply discipline. So OPEC countries have the ability to ramp production back up at their discretion, but in the US the rig count is at a level where there's just not going to be production growth in the foreseeable future.- And just last one for you here. I think this is the question that so many folks are really wondering because a lot of consumers have been paying a lot of attention to what's been happening to oil lately because they've been feeling the pain at the pump, so to speak. So let's just ask, how much longer you think that that could continue?PAVEL MOLCHANOV: Well, I'll take a step back and say that US consumers actually have it really good when it comes to fuel prices, globally speaking. Yes, of course, prices are higher than they were a year ago or two years ago. But compared to what their counterparts pay across Europe, in Japan and Australia, it's much cheaper. Even in California, the most expensive gasoline, it's cheaper.So if demand gradually recovers to pre-COVID levels by, let's say, next summer and OPEC continues to ramp production back up, we think that the price of crude, the main determinant of gasoline, obviously, will be flattish to slightly up from current levels. And it's worth pointing out, the commodity market is actually signaling that prices will go down from current levels. We disagree. We think prices are more likely to be higher, not dramatically, but maybe a little higher by the end of the year than they are today.IIII$CDEV $XEC $SM $MTDR $SU $OXY $MRO $LPI $KOS $VET $CVX $XOM $SUN $WLL $OAS $EOG $COG $APA $RIG $CVEO"

"(Bloomberg) -- Gasoline demand surged to a a record high as Americans took to the road for the July 4th holiday weekend.Gasoline supplied, a proxy for demand, rose to 10 million barrels a day the week ended July 2, the highest in data going back to 1990, according to the Energy Information Administration.Demand has regained its footing as vaccinations and easing economic restrictions propel more Americans to resume their pre-pandemic lifestyles. Oil prices have risen almost 50% this year as U.S. refineries run close to full-bore to keep up with fuel demand. While the U.S. recovery quickens, the world’s largest oil producers can’t agree on how to supply the market with Saudi Arabia advocating for tempered supply increases given the potential headwinds that still exist.“Demand is bucking with the price spikes and summer driving, but with high gas prices and inflation, the picture in September may look different,” said Trisha Curtis, co-founder of PetroNerds.The moving average for demand also climbed higher, reaching the most since late 2019. But on a seasonal basis the figure was still about 150,000 barrels a day short of July 2019, suggesting the market still has some room to recover.U.S. motorists hit the road in large numbers despite contending with the highest gasoline prices since 2014.

"This week will see CVX go up higher than it started last week.

"Most headlines are saying that the market is worried about inflation. CVX would do well in an inflationary environment, thus it is more likely that a resurgence of COVID is what has the market spooked.

"Oil Extends Gain From 2018 High With Saudis Upbeat on DemandBen Sharples: Tue, June 1, 2021, 8:37 PM(Bloomberg) -- Oil extended gains after closing at the highest since October 2018 as OPEC+ provided an upbeat assessment of the demand outlook and the prospect of a speedy return of Iranian barrels to the market waned.Saudi Arabia’s Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said demand “has shown clear signs of improvement” as the alliance ratified an output boost for July. His Russian counterpart also spoke of the “gradual economic recovery,” with the comments driving West Texas Intermediate up by 2.1% and pushing Brent above $70 a barrel at the close for the first time since 2019.Adding further support to the market was an indication that talks to revive a 2015 nuclear accord with Iran has been delayed for now. An Iranian official said a deal is now expected to be finalized in August.Oil is up around 40% this year as the recovery from the pandemic in the U.S., China and parts of Europe boosts the outlook for fuel consumption, despite a Covid-19 resurgence in countries such as India. Global demand may rebound to levels seen before the outbreak in a year, according to the International Energy Agency, signaling a quicker comeback than its previous estimates.The prompt timespread for Brent was 41 cents in backwardation -- a bullish market structure where near-dated prices are more expensive than later-dated ones. That compares with 9 cents at the start of last week.OPEC+ ministers agreed Tuesday to press ahead with an increase of 841,000 barrels a day in July, following hikes in May and June, although the group didn’t give any hints on future supply moves. There’s reason to be cautious about the second half of the year, with the outlook dependent on two hard-to-predict factors: the coronavirus and nuclear talks between Iran and the U.S.Diplomats had hoped to fully restore the nuclear deal before Iran’s June 18 presidential elections, after which the presidency of Hassan Rouhani will wind down. An agreement is expected to result in a lifting of U.S. sanctions and an increase in Iranian oil exports, although there are varying estimate on how much crude could return to the market.DIAMOND HANDS!IIII$CDEV $XEC $WES $SM $MTDR $FLNG $SU $OXY $MRO $LPI $KOS $VET $CVX $XOM $SUN $WLL $OAS $EOG $COG $APA"

"REMEMBER HOW THE BRILLIANT EUROPEANS WERE GOING ALL IN ON WIND AND SOLAR?Gas Is So Scarce in Europe That Coal Is Making a ComebackVanessa Dezem, Jesper Starn and Isis Almeida: Tue, June 15, 2021, 2:00 AM(Bloomberg) --Europe is so short of natural gas that the continent -- usually seen as the poster child for the global fight against emissions -- is turning to coal to meet electricity demand that is now back to pre-pandemic levels.Coal usage in the continent jumped 10% to 15% this year after a colder- and longer-than-usual winter left gas storage sites depleted, said Andy Sommer, team leader of fundamental analysis and modeling at Swiss trader Axpo Solutions AG. As economies reopen and people go back to the office, countries like Germany, the Netherlands and Poland turned to coal to keep the lights on.Europe has long been at the forefront of the battle to reduce global warming. The continent has the world’s largest carbon market, charging the likes of utilities, steel producers and cement makers for polluting the environment. But even with record carbon prices this year, low gas reserves mean burning coal -- the dirties of fossil fuels -- has become more widespread again.“Energy demand has been pretty strong in Europe and we have seen a recovery from the pandemic,” Sommer said in an interview. “Gas storage is so low now that Europe cannot afford to run extra power generation with the fuel.”The return of coal is a setback for Europe ahead of the climate talks in Glasgow later this year. Leaders of the world’s biggest economies failed to set a firm date to end coal burning at the meeting of the Group of Seven at the weekend in Cornwall, U.K.Europe faced freezing temperatures earlier this year, boosting demand for heating at a time liquefied natural gas cargoes were being sent to Asia instead. Russia sent less gas to the continent via Ukraine ahead of the start of the Nord Stream 2 link to Germany, expected later this year.All of that mean that European storage is currently 25% below the five-year average and benchmark Dutch gas surged more than 50% this year. Futures are currently trading near their highest level for this time of the year since 2008.“People thought Russia was going to book more capacity via Ukraine and that just hasn’t happened in a meaningful way,” said Trevor Sikorski, head of natural gas and energy transition at consultants Energy Aspects in London. “The market is super tight, it’s trying to get less gas into power.”Electricity demand, which crashed as the coronavirus locked down cities from Frankfurt to London, is now back. Usage in countries including Germany, Spain and the Czech Republic are above the five-year average, while demand is flat in Italy and France, Morgan Stanley said in a report Monday.With gas supplies already tight amid heavy maintenance cutting flows from Norway, utilities have turned to coal to keep the lights on. While the price of carbon is trading near a record, many have hedged it years in advance. That means burning coal could still be profitable.Generators with “highly efficient” new plants can probably manage to produce power from coal until 2023, even with high carbon prices, Axpo’s Sommer said.The G-7 recognized that coal is the single biggest cause of greenhouse gas emissions in its final communique. But the group promised only to “rapidly scale-up technologies and policies that further accelerate the transition away from unabated coal capacity.”“It’s not a great a message to be sending,” said Ursula Tonkin, portfolio manager of the Whitehelm Capital Low Carbon Core Infrastructure Fund, the Australia-based company that has $4.4 billion of assets under management in all of its funds.While it would be “fantastic” if politicians came to a deal, coal is likely to be phased out anyway by 2030, 2035, said Tonkin. “Politics are important, but you also have the economics of the transition really kicking in within that timeframe,” she said.DIAMOND HANDS!IIII$CDEV $XEC $SM $MTDR $SU $OXY $MRO $LPI $KOS $VET $CVX $XOM $SUN $WLL $OAS $EOG $COG $APA"

"Gas prices are set to climb another 20 cents a gallon this summerStephanie Asymkos: Tue, July 6, 2021, 7:00 PMPump prices are climbing with summer travel in full swing with little relief in sight.Through August, motorists could see the national average rise another 10 to 20 cents, according to AAA, putting the national average over $3.25 per gallon this summer.“Robust gasoline demand and more expensive crude oil prices are pushing gas prices higher,” said Jeanette McGee, AAA spokesperson.The predictions come after U.S. gasoline demand set a new pandemic-era high over the Fourth of July, with national demand rising by 4.7%, according to GasBuddy. The national average is up over 3 cents since last week, and as of Tuesday, the national average stands at $3.12 per gallon, according to GasBuddy.U.S. gasoline demand set a new pandemic-era high over Fourth of July, with national demand rising by 4.7%. (REUTERS/Mike Blake)U.S. gasoline demand set a new pandemic-era high over Fourth of July, with national demand rising by 4.7%. (REUTERS/Mike Blake)“Gasoline demand over the holiday weekend certainly did not disappoint as millions of Americans flooded the roads for the long weekend, guzzling down gasoline at a clip not seen in years,” Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis for GasBuddy, said in a press release. “In the process, we could have set new all-time records for consumption.”Aside from demand stateside, geopolitical tensions are putting upward pressure on prices for crude oil, the raw material used to make gasoline. The meeting among the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries was canceled this week after a dispute between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates over the cartel's oil production.“We had hoped that global crude production increases would bring some relief at the pump this month, but weekend Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) negotiations fell through with no agreement reached,” McGee said. “Crude prices are set to surge to a seven-year high.""Another factor that could affect prices is the June-to-November hurricane season in the Atlantic when the U.S. crude oil market moves when there are interruptions in Gulf Coast production.For the country’s cheapest fill-up, southern states Mississippi ($2.73), Louisiana ($2.75), and South Carolina ($2.79), lead the way. The country’s most expensive gas can be found on the West Coast: California ($4.29), Hawaii ($3.96), and Washington ($3.79).“For now, with imbalances in supply and demand continuing, motorists will continue digging deeper to pay for gasoline as prices are likely headed nowhere but up until global supply starts to catch up with the surge in demand,” said De Haan.DIAMOND HANDS...HODL!IIII$CDEV $XEC $SM $MTDR $SU $OXY $MRO $LPI $KOS $VET $CVX $XOM $SUN $WLL $OAS $EOG $COG $APA $RIG"

"""Market Thirsty For Oil""Thomas Hum: Yahoo FinanceThu, July 15, 2021, 11:58 AM·As for longer term expectations for energy as the world economy recovers from the pandemic, Tsakos Energy Navigation (TNP) COO George V. Saroglou said that he remains hopeful for the oil market, citing OPEC’s diligent management of the collapse in demand, continued restoration of oil barrel production levels, and a market “thirsty for oil.”“Oil demand is recovering from the monumental losses of last year. And after a strong demand growth year in 2021, experts now see a return to the pre-COVID demand levels by next year,” Saroglou said.The International Energy Agency (IEA) forecasted in June that global crude oil demand will return to its pre-pandemic high during the final quarter of 2022. Subsequently, carbon emissions have seen a significant rebound, in spite of many wealthy countries accelerating their push towards greater wind and solar utilization.Thomas Hum is a writer at Yahoo Finance.

"What a difference a week makes. Or does it? Once the Delta spike levels off and rolls over the conversation will switch from “the sky is falling” to “the future looks bright”. Investors are fickle and always extrapolate current conditions into the future. Right now they can't look beyond Delta, they believe it will carry on well into the future when in reality it is going to peak and level off and that worry will subside. People will start to focus on fudamentals again. Oil prices don't need to be $80, at $60 to $70 oil companies are making good money and will continue to pay down debt, buy back stock and pay dividends. We are still well within that window. And more than likely once this Chicken Little fear induced sell off is over prices will stabilize and rise back into the $70's. If anything this will cause no new production to be pursued and it may even cause OPEC+ to pull back on increasing supply. The headwind of a rising dollar may persist, but longer term with our deficits we could see a structurally weaker dollar as Jeff Gundlach has pointed out ""the dollar is doomed""."

"Why Oil Keeps Rising Even as Other Commodities Pull BackAvi Salzman: June 2, 2021 11:09 am ETPrices of commodities like steel and corn have pulled back from the highs they hit last month, but oil has continued to climb, buoyed by signs of increasing travel around the world and new pressures on supply.Brent crude futures, the global benchmark, were trading 0.4% higher, to $70.56 a barrel, on Wednesday. West Texas Intermediate futures were up 0.3%, to $67.94 a barrel.Oil has risen for some of the same reasons as other commodities — the speed of the reopening and supply shortages in some areas.But other factors are also at play that may prolong the oil rally even as some other commodity prices have begun to decline. Morgan Stanley analyst Devin McDermott wrote in a note published Wednesday that political dynamics were likely to cap the growth in oil supply even as demand continues to rise in the years ahead.The International Energy Agency recently wrote that oil-and-gas companies would have to keep their capital expenditures at or below 2020 levels for the world to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050. McDermott expects public company shareholders will demand that companies adhere to this rule. Exxon Mobil (ticker: XOM), Chevron (CVX), and Royal Dutch Shell (RDS. A) all faced reckonings last week over their climate impacts, and the pressure will only grow.Demand, however, may not drop as much as supply — though there is a robust debate going on about whether demand has already peaked or could keep rising for at least another decade.Morgan Stanley oil strategist Martjin Rats expects demand will keep rising to 107 million barrels a day by 2033, from 100 million barrels at the start of 2020. To satisfy that increasing demand, Rats expects state-owned oil companies and private firms will have to ramp up production, and oil prices will need to rise to fund that expansion. Currently, public companies account for about half of oil supply. Prices might even have to rise to $80 a barrel to induce private companies and state-owned ones to cover the gap. Rats increased his long-term Brent price target to $60 from $50.McDermott thinks that different stocks will outperform depending on oil prices. At $60 West Texas crude prices, APA, formerly Apache (APA), Diamondback Energy (FANG), Ovintiv (OVV), ConocoPhillips (COP), and Devon Energy (DVN) look attractive, he says.At $70, those stocks still look good, as do companies with more financial or operating leverage like Murphy Oil (MUR), Occidental Petroleum (OXY), and Continental Resources (CLR).DIAMOND HANDS!IIII$CDEV $XEC $WES $SM $MTDR $FLNG $SU $OXY $MRO $LPI $KOS $VET $CVX $XOM $SUN $WLL $OAS $EOG $COG $APA"

"March 31, 2020Dear Stockholder,Normally this proxy statement comes to you in a new year amid market conditions that bear some resemblance to those of the prior year. Clearly that is not the case in 2020. We want to update you on how Chevron is responding to the unprecedented challenges the world is currently confronting.We recognize investors have concerns about the broad decline in equity markets globally, and the uncertainty and turbulence created by the global pandemic. In our industry this exogenous demand shock is exacerbated by an unanticipated supply surge, creating an abrupt imbalance and a sharp downturn in commodity prices. As chairman and lead director, we want to assure you that your Board of Directors is fully engaged, and the company is taking decisive actions in response to these dynamic market conditions.Your company is positioned to be resilient during these difficult times. Chevron entered this period of turbulence with a strong balance sheet, a low dividend break-even and a disciplined approach to managing capital and costs. We purposely built options into our plan to respond to unexpected conditions, and we’re activating these now.We are reducing our 2020 capital and exploratory spending guidance by 20 percent by deferring short cycle investments and pacing projects not yet under construction. To maintain balance sheet strength, we’ve suspended our share repurchase program and expect to complete assets sales signed last year. In addition, the company is taking action to deliver $1 billion in cost improvements by the end of 2020.These moves reflect our long-standing financial priorities and are focused on protecting the dividend, supporting the balance sheet, and prioritizing capital that drives long-term value for stockholders. Even in the face of the current headwinds, we intend to clearly demonstrate Chevron’s resilience to you, the stockholders whose investment supports everything we do.Sincerely, LOGO Michael K. WirthChairman and CEO"
I expect oil to be well over a $100 a barrel this summer. I bought cvx at around $102 a share and expect $150 is around the corner.
"Chevron and BrightmarkE announce 2nd expansion of joint venture to own projects across the U.S. to produce and market dairy biomethane, a renewable natural gas (RNG). This boosts Chevron's objective to increase RNG volumes 10x by 2025 over 2020 volumes."
Oil flat shares down 1.5%. Why?
"Solar panels use petroleum.The photovoltaics, which turn sunlight into energy, are typically sandwiched between layers of copolymers. One of the petrochemical building blocks common to many of the copolymers is ethylene—a petrochemical derived from oil and natural gas."
"dividend pay day 9/10, will add more shares."
Great quarter. Starting buybacks again. The need for oil isn't going to stop overnight. Put money into it every month automatically in a DRIP. Retire at 62. Investing is easy.
"Sell Exxon Stock Ahead of Earnings, Buy Chevron ConocoPhillips, Says Goldman -- Barrons.com10:18 AM ET 7/1/20 | Dow JonesRelated Quotes 12:44 PM ET 7/2/20Symbol Last % ChgCOP42.09 3.31%CVX89.17 1.76%XOM44.43 1.65%Real time quote. By Teresa RivasGoldman Sachs takes a look at the oil majors ahead of second-quarter earnings, and the firm's advice is simple: Buy Chevron and ConocoPhillips stock, and sell Exxon Mobil. Why? It all comes down to cash.Analyst Neil Mehta updated his estimates for Chevron (ticker: CVX), ConocoPhillips (COP), and Exxon (XOM) on Wednesday, ahead of the energy giants' coming earnings reports, and warns that the results will reflect a challenging quarter. Companies are dealing with weaker pricing margins, and while lower production and cost-cutting efforts can offset that pressure to an extent, there could still be some pain evident in the numbers.Yet perhaps the most important metric to watch is free cash flow -- or the minimization of free cash burn -- as this will be key to the companies' debt profiles. ""We expect ConocoPhillips and Chevron could see net debt broadly unchanged at quarter-end, thanks to capital discipline and boosted by asset sales closed during the second quarter, while Exxon could see large debt builds,"" Mehta writes.That fact informs part of his bullish calls on ConocoPhillips and Chevron. He reiterated Buy ratings on both (ConocoPhillips is also on his Conviction Buy List), with price targets of $56 and $112, respectively, and notes that both look well leveraged to an oil recovery, whenever that may be.As for Exxon, Mehta has a Sell rating on the stock and lowered his price target by $2 to $42. He sees the ""shares as expensive on valuation, relative to U.S. majors, as well as see free-cash-flow generation and dividend coverage as challenged,"" and even with their year-to-date decline, he's too concerned about the near-term risks to its recovery to recommend it to bargain hunters.It isn't hard to see why Mehta and others are focused on cash: Energy companies had been struggling with low commodity prices for years, well before the pandemic, and now the threat of dividend cuts amid capital crunches may be driving some of the longest-suffering investors away from the stocks. (Shareholders certainly aren't there for big gains -- Exxon stock today essentially trades where it did in early 2004.)Oil prices have been making some strides recently, but investing in theenergy sector has remained quite difficult. Yet while Exxon and ConocoPhillips are each off about 35% year to date, Chevron stock has only fallen 26%, helped in part by its strong balance sheet, although some warn that's not enough to compensate for the industry's woes.Write to Teresa Rivas at teresa.rivas@barrons.com> Dow Jones Newswires"
nearly time to buy more. I like 95 as an entry point.
"This April, Forbes reported that Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) was the first major US oil company to invest in a renewable energy project through its investment in an offshore wind power project this year. This July, Mizuho raised its price target on Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) to $135 while retaining its Buy rating, and Truist has a $144 price target on the stock with the same rating"
Heatwave coming = Chevron natural gasWanna recharge those ugly electric cars = Chevron natural gasTrains airplanes fire trucks construction trucks bulldozers military tanks = ChevronEverything made of plastic = Chevron petroleumThe left is lying to you
Have to be long I love oil add to dips
"Realistically, EV and other alternative energy methods are decades away from making a dent in big oil companies. Once the pandemic is over, big oil is back and all you on tree huggers are going to be sorry you are ""woke."""
$75/barrel now guys and good news on oil from OPEC if you watch CNBC 2 mins ago.
Any idea about price tomorrow? up or down?
May see $95 - $96 tomorrow guys....oil is up 60c/barrel!
This market is a joke lol
"Guys, I think sticking to the Wall Street shorts is the right thing to do. For too long this has been a manipulated market. I am definitely concerned that some of you will be left with nothing.Do the trade, but don’t get emotionally attached to a trade. Get out and take your profits and invest them into actual companies with assets who pay dividends.Think $GE $XOM $CVX $HD $GEL $ET there’s a ton of very good companies out there. Don’t get too attached to options and being over leveraged. GROWTH IS NOT A VIABLE BUSINESS PLAN WITHOUT PROFITS AND CASH FLOW. Please remember this - get into good companies with profitable well run businesses."
"Gas prices are up. Oil usage is up. Planes, cargo ships, fire trucks, military, const. equip., etc ....don't run on electricity. EV tax credits, windmills, solar panels, etc ..... seems like a crony scam ..... you guys remember theObama Crush a Clunker ? costs us more in Carbon emissions and dollars to crush those cars VS just leaving things alone.

"The thing is that oil companies across the globe have been doing a lot less drilling, even with the increase in price. Normally the price goes up, oil companies increase spending, drill more to meet the higher price and then the price comes down. For the first time, that hasn't happened. So it doesn't matter what the Saudis and anyone else want the price of oil to be at, or what effect it will have on the economy. Once the existing wells are at full capacity that's it until more wells are drilled. That takes time, not just money.DIAMOND HANDS!IIII$CDEV $XEC $SM $MTDR $SU $OXY $MRO $LPI $KOS $VET $CVX $XOM $SUN $WLL $OAS $EOG $COG $APA"
When oil was $61 ppb before the pandemic Noble energy was over $25 and CVX was over $121. Now oil almost $70 and demands improving it should move CVX significantly higher. Any thoughts on how much noble should potentially contribute to CVX share price?
Price of gas is still increasing. One would think the SP for CVX would also rise. CVX must be making some money now. The market confuses me how it works sometimes.
Report is already out. It was an earnings and revenue beat!
"BofA Merrill's Doug Leggate thinks ""the upside from synergies, significant asset sales and de-risking of several aspects of APC's mix such as LNG development will transfer much of the remaining value uplift"" to CVX; the firm upgraded CVX to Buy from Neutral with a $140 price target."
Winter just around the corner...Oil and Fuel oil will be in demand.
OPEC still holding firm and not increasing production. World economys ahead of predicted reopening...airlines still tamping...all travel increasing rapidly....oul to $90 by June. Can't wait...
"My thoughts: 1) The company's financials are in a much better position than before, with debt and operating costs significantly reduced. The share buyback program which was off before has restarted which will add to the price from now on. 2) The current price of oil isn't bad when considering the break-even price stated by the company, the limited supply available, and the inevitably increasing demand the more things re-open (Which are bound to, since even the most irresponsible governments have stated that they have no intention to kill off economic activity the way they did before). 3) Politically speaking, considering 'recent political events' in the US, there is an increasing chance of a more oil-positive administration once this term is over. 4) When it comes to energy transition, I genuinely don't think the Big Oil is caught sleeping. I think everyone who is a realist out there with basic understanding of engineering knows that the transition is not happening yet. When the time comes, with big pockets available, Big Oil will simply buy-out and partner with promising market leaders and out-bid the currently struggling transition-energy start ups and other companies. There have been complains about that already in some articles concerning mostly European oil companies. 5) Concluding, I see the fears exaggerated, and the future not near as grim as painted out to be. I will be happy to add and be there at the climb once the 50% up volume in short positions settles down. PS: I had to self-censor any politically related parts because my previous comment was deleted. I guess I should not be surprised that yahoo is not troubled by bitcoin bot comments, but deletes anything politically sensitive about the situation in the United States and 'you know who'. Sad."
Oil is going crazy if oil stocks follow over the next quarter this stock will hit 120 easy
"CVX should continue it's upward trend, they have a great balance sheet, revenue is great and will continue to be better as we go forward, excellent dividend that appears to be sustainable for the future. CVX was trending much prior to the pandemic and now that the economy is starting to open the stock price should be much higher."
"Great comment below from Alex concerning the thought police. They know they are protecting the greatest fraud in the history of the country, but as libs they don't care. They think we'll all run on solar. Even the master bungler agrees."
"In case nobody noticed, oil is actually up today. Buy don't sell CVX"
Big Oil is King. Greta Thurnburg does not present a good case. She's washed up as an advocate for the planet.
We all know it's a blowout quarter compared too the last
"I bought 20 shares of CVX stock Monday and Tuesday at 95 and 99 bucks, yah me... I want more but not at these prices, if it dips I'll buy 20 more shares maybe even 30 more. When Warren Buffett began buying more Bank of America last summer I bought BAC just because he did, and I'm up about 40% now, BUT there were bad dips in that stock after he bought. I'm hoping for same with CVX. Right now it's hot, so I won't chase it, but if it dips, I'll get more."
Sell some 90 puts and forget it.
"RCL/CCL/NCLH cruise ships start sailing, all flights are full, travelers towards July 4th will reach 15-month record after 15 months of COVID so CVX will be over $110 soon guys - IMO"
Anyone in here on Cdev?
All the talking heads were saying buy buy buy.
"Post covid-crisis the oil prices will be much higher than today. Air travel, road travel, manufacturing, production etc. all picking up nicely. Buy early and be rewarded next year. CVX & XOM are both in a lot of funds/etf's and are ready to rise. Meanwhile enjoy nice dividends and rising stock prices."
Only CVX NIO XPEV LI BLNK are green in my account!
Buy the oil and buy the tires too
