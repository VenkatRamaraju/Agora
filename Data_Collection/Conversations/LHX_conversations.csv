"This puppily is going back to 230.lolWho cares, if goes down before, still collecting dividends, this is a stock to buy and hold, and once war breaks out with china, be up over 500."
More upgrade $260 low $205 High $260 average $233 13 buys 6 strong buys .
Hope it keeps going...
"welp, this is one of those long term aerospace holds with runway growth opportunities. i bought about a yr ago as a long term hold for my kids. i project 400+ 5 yrs from now, as long as the aerospace sector continues to innovate. space will be one of the biggest growth area in the coming years, and LHX is one of the big players that will benefit greatly."
"They take pensions away from all salary employees and then give bonuses in retrospect to division presidents because they lost their pension so they go through the SEC to subvert limits and give some people $257,000 put into their 401(k) per year tax deferred"
Nothing but Great news and down $5?
"Jay Malave spent all the buyback authorization just for Bill Brown back in February. Had he truly acted on behalf of shareholders, there would be buy backs occurring now. But Bill now has his retirement set with over $100 million. Employees perform, Brown and Mulave and the board get all the rewards."
"Goldman is dead wrong. I've owned this company for a very long time and have seen this kind of downgrade come and go, but they have ALWAYS been wrong. LHX is a master of underpromise and over deliver, and all signs says that will continue."
Chart technicals look very strong. If it can plow through the $228 5Y high it can run for a long time. Don’t sell! The stock wants to run…so let it run!
6bn share buybacks + 20% dividend raise. This is awesome!Long LHX!
Came close to $225 this week… maybe next week.
LHX was like a fortress today. Dow was down 1100 points and LHX didn't even flinch or dip more than 1%Love it. We may even close green
"Recent divestures have helped, just like when they dumped the semiconductor division years ago."
Not complaining but why the upsurge???
I've owned L3 since it opened in 1998 and continued buying it since and have never sold 1 share. It's been a great performer since the IPO date. Obviously I'm a long termer! Ha
First time investor. Bought this morning because I may never ever see these prices again.
145 millions accumulated Short Volume in $LHX shorts squeeze Next week can hit $300.
Merry Christmas Everyone!
LHX settled 133 alleged violations of US arms export controls with $13million just days after its CEO sold off $30million in personal shares.https://www.pmddtc.state.gov/ddtc_public?id=ddtc_kb_article_page&sys_id=384b968adb3cd30044f9ff621f961941
UBS upgrade from neutral to buy is todays catalyst
"I think the fun is just starting at LHX. Earnings will continue to surprise to the upside because of improving margins from the integration of key divisions, expense reduction from eliminating duplication, opportunities to divest underperforming assets, refinancing the high cost debt (9%j at L3 and market share gains at the DOD. All of these activities will accelerate even more share buybacks and dividend increases. Even better the defense budget has been locked in for 2 years so all the idiotic prattle of the Lame St Media about an imminent recession does not matter because the programs they supply and will add are locked in regardless of the economy or the lying, cheating, Commie Chinese. Finally there are major brokerage firms who are asleep at the switch that have yet to start covering LHX and because of all the potential Investment Banking business available you can bet the opinions will be positive or they will be locked out. So when Bunk of America finally gets around to recommending it with a $250+ price target, let’s review the bulge bracket firms to see who is still out to lunch."
we finished the week with a new 52 week high! Why are a few suggesting the stock is dead?
Excellent!
"Jim Cramer, CNBC, just made a couple of comments that L3X is one of the key companies needed to defend these attacks due to their radar technology. He also mentioned RTN as a good play on this."
why is it down today?
All I can say is wow! NOC and HRS are 2 of the Best buys in the market right now!
"July 8, 2020. Great company but currently trading like a falling knife. I like a bargain as much as the next guy, but the Defense sector is out of favor as the Nasdaq hits new all time highs every day. If L3 announced that they were buying a “Cloud” company, the stock would jump Ten Percent. That’s how irrational the market is right now."
One step forward and two steps back....
This stock doesn't make any sense to me. Down on up days?....not good. RTX is a better buy.
"Tension in Myanmar ,news from cnn, Told you this thing going pop to 300 this week"
Why do LHX investors complain so frequently about the company’s CEO? Can someone provide some insight?
For a tech/defense company this this sure trades like an airline/financial company.
Defense spending will not change regardless of who is in charge of the executive branch. Hard times like we are facing can make rational actors do irrational things. All the more reason to be strong on defense.
Thanks for the cheap shares. I added more today at $143.55
Makes no sense that this stock is not down in line with the rest of the Defense sector at a fraction of a %. For some reason its down over 2% for no reason and no news.
Why are we down $5.51???
CEO Bill Brown is still hurting his employees. This quarter he banned L3Harris stock purchases inside our 401k brokerage link. And the percentage you can own in the basic plan is restricted to 20%.
"October 05, 2021--(BUSINESS WIRE)--L3Harris Technologies (NYSE:LHX) will modernize the U.S. Air Force B-52 aircraft to protect aircrew from enemy radar threats under a new 10-year, sole-source $947 million IDIQ contract.L3Harris will enhance the aircrafts’ AN/ALQ-172 electronic warfare (EW) self-protection system, providing a combat proven integrated radio frequency system that can simultaneously counter multiple electronic spectrum threats that interfere with aircraft operations. L3Harris has an opportunity to expand the scope of work on the program from software sustainment to hardware upgrades. NICE "
"Headline: 'L3Harris Technologies Has Gifted Shareholders With a Fantastic 169% Total Return on Their Investment'. Gee, what am I missing here or is someone enjoying way too many edibles????"
They gave out 10 shares to every employees
"the stock has been almost straight down since June 10, yet i can't find any news anywhere. Anyone have any idea why? Covid doesn't seem a valid reason for this kind of drop."
Nice earnings and nice outlook.
Positive technical buying signal at 9trading. Looking for breakout at 151.23 with a short term target of 188.31.
I know this isn’t a political site but vote Trump or this stock along with other defense stocks will TANK!!!
LHX to the moon! No wait... to Mars!!!!
"L3Harris Technologies (NYSE:LHX) declares $1.02/share quarterly dividend, 20% increase from prior dividend of $0.85."
Hope next week is the same with this stock
Bill Brown goes bye bye after Q2. The market will view this favorably as it did when Kubasik was announced as CEO of L3.
Didn't expect anything else. Business as usual. Down on an up day.
"This stock is going to go through the roof, huge buyback, and business ramping way up, should be back over 230 before summer."
Search short interest. Look at the Fintel page under Ownership tab. Price action makes no sense. A lot of investment buyers and very few sellers.
220 short term target by end of aug
220 is coming
"My wife retired from this company after 38 yrs. did some merger consulting work. We have a substantial position and not selling, as long as Brown at the helm. Good prospects, model and dividend."
What happened today to this stock was up then ended down?
More after hours buying...nice.
Why is this stock so volatile???
Congratulations to L3Harris on An impressive win as PRIME contractor on the MUSV Medium Unmanned Surface Vehicle. With all option exercised almost 300 M.Huge strategic growth area in unmanned maritime systems.
Added more at $165.30
Why is this stock going down???
typical algo takedown after a headlineI suspect it will be back to $230 tomorrow if the markets pump in the slightest. Those $230 and $240 october 15th calls looked nice so i snagged some
About time LHX got the love it deserves
"This is a great company, my brother and dad work at harris and I went on the recent family day and the satellite antenna department is really exciting"
This is far overblown. Republicans aren’t the only party that spends money on defense. It’ll be a part of the budget no matter who wins the election.
Disappointing price action today but future is bright
Market up over 200 and this stock is only up .28 ???
Anyone have any advice on what I should do? My cost average for this is 186. I bought on friday literally minutes before wave 2 news came out. Im not sure if it will reach that point again or higher in the future and not sure if I should take the loss or hold
Defense stocks dipping but likely remain bullish on $LMT $RTN $KTOS $SSTI $PAT.TO $LHX while the markets figure themselves out https://alltrades.market/DefenseStocks
Any chance at a dividend increase?
Up again after hours on good volume
"ALL-TIME HIGH TODAY! Congrats longs! It's taken some time, but we have surpassed pre-pandemic levels and have set a new company record! "
screaming buy at these levels. many people don't even know these companies merged and the synergies they created.
This stock needs a statement from management and/or the BOD.

"You can thank your CEO Brown for price not moving upward with company results. His options are in place, along with company stock buy backs. How luck did that work out for him."
What does the coronovirus have to do with this stock???
"CEO silence, a sign he doesn't care about the owners nor the employee equity. He'd rather give profits to racist groups like Souther poverty law crappers."
Any chance of a stock split if we hit $250?
Any thoughts on earnings?
"This is one strange stock. When the market goes down this thing goes up. When the market has a big rally, it goes the opposite way and has a big down turn. You would think it was a bond the way it is acting."
"The CEO has sold off 417,852 shares since September 5th. Taking home $74,349,200 before taxes. Shows a lot of faith in the company. One ""senior"" director has been granted almost 250k shares to buy his obedience. Caveat Emptor."
Like lmt a bastion of innovation a realTech stock
I just added at 169. Was just 209 two weeks ago. Was kicking myself for not adding more last time the stock pulled back. Not this time!
Why is the market up over 200 and this stock is stagnant???
"If it was not for the CEO, we would all be better off as far as stock price. Sold over 60 million worth of shares over a week period."
Will we end the year over 200???
Here comes yet another meltdown!!
Wish this stock wasn’t so volatile
Awarded space force contract !!What is the deal with our stock price....SMH
"Looks like Mulave and Brown were kissing again. Brown exercised over 250,000 options last week, while buybacks conveniently happened to make an alltime high. And SEC doesn't care. $41 million payday for the shister Brown."
If Trump gets re-elected will this stock SURGE???
L3Harris is up 4.90% to 182.07
"Tremendous quarter, solid numbers. Love the synergies!"
GD buying CSRA Harris could be in play! We'll see. Definitely would have to carry a nice premium.
Well-diversified play with top tier management. We all know defense spending will go up. Ologopolies are the investors biggest friends.
This stock was around $220 few month did well in Q2. what's wrong now?
This fall in price doesn’t make sense!
Obviously something going on behind the scenes here that has nothing to do with the company outlook. I look at this price as a great opportunity.
this stock seems like it goes down every time the market goes up.
Why is every other defense stock up over double digits and this stock is up only $3.00???
"Brown, Kubasik Mulave, Lalwani, Mikuen, doing nothing for equity holders."
I bought this stock when I worked for Harris it kept splitting invested $750.00 now worth over 100 grand. Yes it was a long time ago lol.. It's really funny when the market is down L3 goes up don't know why?
If LHX becomes part of this new ARK ETF 
Any predictions if this stock will be at 245 by December?
"L3Harris Technologies, Inc. (LHX) reported second quarter 2021 revenue of $4.7 billion, up 5.0% versus prior year, and up 6.2% on an organic1 basis. GAAP net income was $413 million, up 49% versus prior year. Adjusted EBIT3 was $869 million, up 7.3% versus prior year, and adjusted EBIT margin3 expanded 40 basis points (bps) to 18.6%. GAAP EPS was $2.01, up 55%, and non-GAAP EPS3 was $3.26, up 15% versus prior year.GUIDANCE - ""Attempts to contain and reduce the spread of COVID, such as mandatory closures, ""shelter-in-place"" orders and travel and quarantine restrictions, have caused significant disruptions and adverse effects on the U.S. and global economies, such as impacts to supply chains, customer demand, international trade and capital markets. L3Harris' response has involved increasing its focus on keeping its employees safe while striving to maintain continuity of operations, meet customer commitments and support suppliers. For example, the company instituted numerous types of precautions, protocols and other arrangements designed to protect employees from COVID infections and to comply with applicable regulations and has also maintained an active dialog, and in some cases developed plans, with key suppliers in an effort to mitigate supply chain risks or otherwise minimize the impacts from those risks. The U.S. Government response to COVID has included identifying the Defense Industrial Base as a Critical Infrastructure Sector and enhancing cash flow and liquidity for the Defense Industrial Base, such as by increasing progress payments and accelerating contract awards, which enabled the company to keep its U.S. production facilities largely operational in support of national security commitments to U.S. Government customers (as part of the Defense Industrial Base) and to accelerate payments to small business suppliers, which it expects to continue while the U.S. Government’s responsive actions remain in effect.Although the company believes that a large percentage of its revenue, earnings and cash flow that is derived from sales to the U.S. Government, whether directly or through prime contractors, will be relatively predictable, in part due to the U.S. Government’s responsive actions described above, the company's commercial and international businesses are at a higher risk of adverse COVID-related impacts, and the company cannot eliminate all potential impacts to its business from supply chain risks, such as longer lead times and shortages of electronics and other components. For example, the severe decline in global air traffic from travel restrictions and the resulting downturn in the commercial aviation market and its impact on customer operations has significantly reduced demand for flight training, flight simulators and commercial avionics products in the company's Aviation Systems segment.The company’s 2021 guidance reflects the company’s current expectations and assumptions regarding COVID-related impacts, including on the U.S. and global economies. These assumptions continue to include a measured assessment of the downturn in the commercial aerospace business and in demand for public safety solutions, as well as additional potential risks from facility shutdowns, supply chain disruptions and international activity weakness. The company’s current expectations and assumptions could change, which could negatively affect the company’s outlook. The extent of these disruptions and impacts, including on the company's ability to perform under U.S. Government and other contracts within agreed timeframes and ultimately on its results of operations and cash flows, will depend on future developments, including further COVID-related impacts and associated containment and mitigation actions taken by governmental authorities and consequences thereof, and global air traffic demand and governmental subsidies to airlines, and potential impacts to the company’s business from supply chain risks, all of which are uncertain and unpredictable, could exacerbate other risks described in the company’s filings with the SEC and could materially adversely impact the company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows."""
Will the debacle in Afghanistan mean more investment into defense stocks…especially since Biden needs to look tough now
awesome earnings :)
"Great stock for the long term!Some patience is required, but investors should get rewarded for this!"
"Everything go up except $lmt, $noc, $lhx anybody knows why?"
WTH is going on.... 2 steps forward 3 steps back....

hoping for a breakout. No reason we shouldn't close that gap up to $235
there is no reason this stock goes down practically everyday. they are growing their CPS they are increasing guidance but are flying under the radar of the Millennials who are more interested in Chipotle Aurora cannabis and Bitcoin. That's because they haven't experienced a war yet but they will very soon.
"If you think aero-defense and cyber will gain traction given all these global tensions and you think government will grow over the long term, you stay invested. If you don't, you don't."
"I bought Harris in the 90s 200 shares $25 it split 2 for1 some years later and unfortunately I,sold most of it for uber $50 A share. I,still have, some. A great, stock. Goes up in value"
"Guys, L3Harris announced today that they have become a prime contractor to design, build, and launch an entire constellation of spy satellites. Before this, they only contributed sensors and components to other prime contractors. This is big news for the stock and nobody seems to be noticing.https://spacenews.com/l3harris-developing-a-constellation-of-small-spy-satellites-for-u-s-air-force/"
"LHX is a stock not many even know about. The senergies of the 2 companies that merged are paying of and will continue to do so. This is a long hold stock, not a day traders gamble."
Wow - HRS knocked it out of the park
Upgrade Morgan Stanley $259 target.
Buy buy buy tomorrow is pop $20 boxs date. Will hit $260 in two week.
"I'm buying at this level. 13 days till earnings and then we'll get a nice pop. I admit I was concerned when the CEO dumped shares, but the $13 million ""fine"" is just a blip, and this company is winning contracts all over the place."
Cashing out today !!
"That little uptick to $212 w/e 4/23 was Mulave rewarding the board members for their 885 shares each becoming vested, buybacks are only for boardroom privilege. See Form 4 filed with SEC."
Goldman upgrade. $240 price target!
If it ever reaches 240 again I'm selling all of it...
"Anybody understand Friday's massive volume, modest move?"
"Been waiting for this to pop. I loaded up on shares during this pullback and it now makes up the largest position in my portfolio. Don’t look now, but this is the beginning of a move to the next resistance level, around $211."
Do NOT sell to the MMs. Keep for years as they are a bohemith and under the radar.
"Morgan Stanley coverage initiated, overweight PT 248"
$LHX vs $LDOS ?
"I'm glad I stuck to my GUNS (haha...see what I did there) on this stock. The defense sector has been the best value throughout this pandemic. The reason this tanked, being the notion that a Democratic president will not spend on defense, is ludacris. LHX is the growth play on the ever-reliable defense sector. Now let's get up in the $200's where this belongs after that last fantastic quarter."
Bought ahead of earnings. More after earns which I think will be very good.My theory is that defense spending will tend more to communications products than hardware.
Great numbers posted. Wow they blew it out of the park!
Malave hates emoloyees. Does buybacks only for Bill Brown to pad his option exercise. $10 down in just two days.
This stock is super undervalued
above average volume today as well (8/08/21). That's a very good sign! Everyone enjoy your weekend!
"Will this stock hit $225, this week?"
Maybe this company is a little overvalued compared to its peers such as Lockheed or Northrop. Why should it deserve a substantially higher multiple?
Market up.... but LHX down... Something needs to change... Did so much better as L3/LLL My stock is still negative 11k since the merger...
"Not sure whats happening but nothing is wrong. As an employee, when I see a sale like this I increase my 401k contributions."
"Hey, Bill. Those company buyback dollars would come in handy right now. Oh, I forgot those were your"
Nice day for L3 shareholders. Especially compared to the rest of the market.
"Tomorrow is dividend day. Free cash for a good steady stock. This stock is being held down for some reason but in the long run, it's a winner."
News on 900 M contract from US Airforce. No link was in my feed w more info to come ...
why are we down after that great report? We should be up $7+
we got a new 52 week high!
GS issued new PT at 207. I unloaded alot over the last week. Will be back in at a better price
The only bright spot in my portfolio today lol. Stock is still way undervalued.
Why are we down over $8 today? Is there a problem with the merger?
Typical - up in pre-market hours and then it predictably does down during trading hours. What's up with that?
"Great, just great. Wasn't this thing supposed to go to $200, $220 or even $300. LMAO!!!!"
Is this a good time to get in?
"Yahoo censors at work, trying second time.Form 4, November 6, says Scott Mikuen exercised 20,000 options to buy at $77, then sold for $184 on Nov. 5. Now you know why buybacks were used again to drive up price last week."
Thanks to the new regime the only thing going up is oil.
Merger with L3 is imminent. Should help share price.
L3Harris reached an all time high at 240.82
L3Harris and all defense companies have not been shut down to my knowledge so can someone explain the stock price drops? Work has not changed in our area. I guess our CEO and his associates have dragged the price down.
What happened AH? Day trading profit taking from the big guys?
No stock price continuously gravitates northward. Company buy backs suggest strong cash position. Increased dividend suggest healthy company. IMOStock prices always drop faster and in a shorter period of time verses slow steady increases in price over time. Buy a few shares on the dip. This company ain’t going anyway anytime soon. Talk to me in 5 years.
Wow! Earnings most have been good.
