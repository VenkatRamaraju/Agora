"Guess with NOC and LMT going down big, this one is next"
Who is buying on the dip heading into earnings? Seems like a nice time to pick up some more right here..
Any predictions if this stock will be at 245 by December?
L3Harris reached an all time high at 240.82
I’m frankly treating it as a play that “something “ will happen around the world in near future that’ll send def/aero stocks spiking back up. China doesn’t actually have to do anything at this point to send Taiwan into major defense mode. Can you say semiconductors?
Total manuliptation in premarket. 3.5k traded down $7? Don't sell your valuable shares till after 10am or add 2 your position.
Definitely prefer $LHX vs. $LMT!
Maybe tomorrow we can buy around $200 if they have a short fall.
You guys riding this forever or is it getting near your target sell price? I was always looking at $245 - $250 range as the target since the merger a couple years back.....
"Goldman is dead wrong. I've owned this company for a very long time and have seen this kind of downgrade come and go, but they have ALWAYS been wrong. LHX is a master of underpromise and over deliver, and all signs says that will continue."
Just added at $234.75
"This stock is almost back to its 52 week high and it reports next week, is that a good sign? "
"Earlier this year:20% Dividend Hike$6,000,000,000 in share buybacksSince August:$393M for Navy Training$947M from Air ForceOrder for 1,000 Team Radios for Army$121M Space Systems ContractI dunno, you decide. My opinion they just keep crushing."
nice beat. On our way back up to those highs I hope!
What’s the reason behind the drop?
Dividend payout caused drop??
L3Harris reached an all time high at 244.79
Market up and LHX down.....every time.
above average volume today as well (8/08/21). That's a very good sign! Everyone enjoy your weekend!
