after 2 plus years uber below its ipo price what a success story
"While analysts are cautiously optimistic about DoorDash, they are bullish about Uber.Based on the upside potential over the next 12 months, Uber certainly seems to be a better Buy."
"Buy low, sell high."
A block of 45M shares of $UBER is reportedly being offered via Goldman Sachs according to Bloomberg
UBER is back to $60 with 80% vaccination rate and reopening.
I own shares in UBER and plan to add on any continued dips. 1-3 year minimum outlook.
I strongly believe this will be 300billion dollar company by 2025…3x from here
Not a terrible report. In at $38.65 in AH

Come on UBER… you are a safe haven. Lets go up today.
Not a $60.00 company. Cost of running this company puts it at $42.00 to $44.00 tops unless customer numbers improve in the Fall.

"Judge: California ride-hailing law is unconstitutionalEconomy Aug 21, 2021 2:06 PM EDTLOS ANGELES — A judge Friday struck down a California ballot measure that exempted Uber and other app-based ride-hailing and delivery services from a state law requiring drivers to be classified as employees eligible for benefits and job protections.Alameda County Superior Court Judge Frank Roesch ruled that Proposition 22 was unconstitutional.Voters approved the measure in November after Uber, Lyft and other services spent $200 million in its favor, making it the most expensive ballot measure in state history.Uber said it planned to appeal, setting up a fight that could likely end up in the California Supreme Court.“This ruling ignores the will of the overwhelming majority of California voters and defies both logic and the law,” company spokesman Noah Edwardsen said. “You don’t have to take our word for it: California’s attorney general strongly defended Proposition 22’s constitutionality in this very case.”He said the measure will remain in force pending the appeal.The judge sided with three drivers and the Service Employees International Union in a lawsuit that argued the measure improperly removed the state Legislature’s ability to grant workers the right to access to the state workers’ compensation program.“For two years, drivers have been saying that democracy cannot be bought. And today’s decision shows they were right,” said Bob Schoonover, president of the SEIU California State Council.Proposition 22 shielded app-based ride-hailing and delivery companies from a labor law that required such services to treat drivers as employees and not independent contractors, who don’t have to receive benefits such as paid sick leave or unemployment insurance.Uber and Lyft threatened to leave the state if voters rejected the measure.Labor spent about $20 million to challenge the proposition.The Honest Truth is Dara has had no clue how to make Uber profitable. Loses keep piling up for 12 years:The state Supreme Court initially declined to hear the case in February — mainly on procedural grounds — but left open the possibility of a lower court challenge."
"at 39.2966, it hits bottom for good. Be prepared for upside slowly but surely into years to come. My future target price for Uber (3-5 years) $160.00 per share at normal full recovery."

"A study by two economists at the University of California, Berkeley examined the impact that Uber, specifically, has had on alcohol-related traffic deaths and total traffic deaths in the US. They sought to investigate a simple question. By providing people with a safe, convenient, and relatively inexpensive alternative means of transportation, would Uber reduce drunk driving and traffic deaths? According to their findings, the answer is a resounding yes.Uber has reduced alcohol-related traffic fatalities by 6.1 percent, the study finds, which equates to roughly 214 lives in 2019. Similarly, Uber reduced overall traffic deaths by 4 percent, likely by reducing other forms of dangerous driving such as driving while very tired."
We are still on the ground floor of Uber stock. Think GOLD! on this one...GOLongDummy!

"It appears Uber is exiting another money losing adventure, selling stake in Yandex back to the Russians. The report indicates that in 2018 the joint venture valued Uber's share at 3.8 billion, but the sale is for 3.1 billion, at most. The last two thirds will only be valued and bought by Yandex at some future date, if ever. So, it seems Uber has lost, at least, another 700 million + on ""investments"" that may be further depreciated. Another write-down coming that will be disguised or offset through some financial hocus pocus. Uber’s stake in the ventures, excluding the self-driving business, is worth $3.1 billion, according to Degtyarev and Reshetnev.Uber merged its operations in Russia and neighboring countries with local leader Yandex in a deal that closed in February 2018 and valued the unit at $3.8 billion. Since the deal, the venture expanded into other businesses such as food-delivery and autonomous vehicles."
"Looks good guys, I have bought some more at these prices!""Gordon Haskett analyst Robert Mollins picked up coverage of both stocks, starting Uber with a Buy rating and $65 target price—which would be a potential return of about 50%"""
After a year of holding sold it all for Didi
"2aug After Morgan Stanley and Stifel Nicolaus gave Uber Technologies (NYSE: UBER) a Buy rating last month, the company received another Buy, this time from Bank of America Securities. Analyst Justin Post reiterated a Buy rating on Uber Technologies today and set a price target of $71.00. The company’s shares closed last Friday at $43.46."
so far for september 17th expiration the action on puts and calls is higher.

Uber is trading at IPO price. It has a much better outlook now.
Not the greatest call... Uber will have to deal with increased competition... Don't think it will drop under 39 tomorrow though
If ubers interest in Russian transportation company is worth $3b how is this valued at only $70b. Uber is worth a lot more if you look at all its components.

"Is the overhang simply the valuation of DIDI?It seems UBER is a strong reopening play, especially with car prices so high wouldn’t it make some sense that when possible UBER is an alternative?"
"Did anyone keep their shares of UBER after the big sale by Softbank?? It was written that the shares would drop on earnings, No one is buying not until Sept. so don't expect an appreciable bounce."

"""For Lyft, money spent on incentives grew an eye-popping 92% quarter over quarter, while revenue rose just 26%. An incredible $375 million was used to attract drivers, which is quite substantial given sales were only $765 million. The situation for Uber is no different, as evidenced by its higher expenses. In the second quarter, the cost of revenue (which includes driver payments and incentives), accounted for 53% of sales, higher than the 48% it was in the prior-year period. Additionally, the company launched a $250 million stimulus in the first quarter to boost driver earnings."" Still a broken business, no profit, ever."
Typical California liberalism. Bunch of regulations and job destruction. Uber n Lyft should just freeze operations for a few weeks and see who needs who more
Uber is at its low. I see it at $65 to $70 oil the next couple of months.
the only thing that makes sense here is that UBER shoots straight up to like $50 because their massive loss and DASH's horrible forecast.... so the only thing that makes sense is straight up.

They had some interesting insights about UBER on (http://Thetraderguide.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
Down on no volume. Earnings in November should be big. Should be in the 50s in no time
"Like all the gig companies, the thing that concerns me is how drivers are being bent over by the insurance companies to cover them requiring a commercial policy. For the low pay, that’s a tough hurdle and the reason high turnover will always be a thing. These gig companies rely on high turnover, which I’m not sure can be a good thing for a business model."
"The city of Chicago filed a wide-ranging lawsuit against DoorDash Inc. and Grubhub Inc. on Friday, accusing the meal-delivery platforms of engaging in deceptive and predatory business practices.The lawsuit alleges the companies' practices harm consumers, delivery workers and restaurants. The city claims DoorDash (DASH) and Grubhub deceive consumers by advertising a lower upfront cost for delivery and sometimes misrepresenting the cost of items at restaurants, which the city calls a ""bait and switch"" because in most cases consumers are too invested in an order to back out when they see additional fees at the end of a transaction.For example, according to the suit, ""During the ordering process, DoorDash and Caviar withhold the existence and amount of the Service Fee, Small Order Fee, and Chicago Fee on the Platforms until the checkout screen.""The $1.50-per-order ""Chicago Fee"" isn't imposed by the city, but rather a reaction by some delivery companies to an earlier attempt by Chicago to rein in the apps' fees. The lawsuit says DoorDash is trying to recoup some of the money it lost from a 15% commission cap imposed by the city, which like other cities around the nation has tried to limit what huge companies like DoorDash were collecting from struggling restaurants during the coronavirus pandemic.""DoorDash has experienced tremendous growth on the backs of restaurants andconsumers,"" the lawsuit states, noting that DoorDash, including its Caviar division, grew its market share in Chicago during the pandemic from 38% to 57%."
well every analyst has target after the report...between 51 - high 70s
Uber will be $60 this year
"Bought in at $41.30 for 4,850 shares hold for $60 again."
"Bottom Line on Uber StockUber looks to be on the path towards profitable growth. Don't let recent cash bleed numbers cloud the long-term story, which still looks very much intact.Undoubtedly, a lot needs to go right over the next 18 months for the stock to climb out of its rut. As management looks to improve upon its operating margins by taking advantage of further M&A opportunities, there will be no telling just how high the stock is capable of flying.Uber stock has stalled out for now, but may just be a matter of time before it can put its foot to the gas."
"Uber in unstoppable. This drop is simply a GIFT. Uber will be the first one to offer driverless taxis. While at it, I bought Lyft as well. It took a dip too."
Uber is NOT offering any shares. Goldman is offering 45 million shares that one of it's cluents had to sell due to margin requirements. That's it. The transaction is done. According to Bloomberg it was completed at prices between $44.15 and $46. Get it now. There is no dilution. It was a Goldman client failing to cover margin. Stop spreading lies ppl. Shorts are just trying to scare you now. Load the dip cause it won't last once regular market hours open up tmrw and you know it.
Why is UBER tanking today?
Not sure why this hasn’t touched $100
the amount of analysts who are bullish on this stock makes me worried. usually when that happens its a sign of trouble lol.
https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/08/24/early-uber-investor-bill-gurley-on-what-the-prop-22-ruling-means-for-uber-and-lyft.html
"It needs to be asked, if the earnings will be ok, then why did Softbank and Goldman make this sale BEFORE the financial report? Why not wait till next Thursday? Did Softbank need the money this week?It raises the suspicion that the earnings report will be negative, and they wanted this done before that. Opinions from traders?"
UBER is the World brand people know and as we open up travel will take off.
"Repeat, the Q2 loss was only -509 million because they marked up the value of their Didi stake by 1.4 billion, and Aurora stake by 440 million. Otherwise it was another 1.9 billion loss. Didi stake was marked to market on the 30th of June, at the ipo price of 14. Today Didi is trading below $8. Down another 1.5 billion market cap today, down 28.8 billion since June 30th, and Uber owns 12% of that, and have been trying to sell it for years. No one wanted it then, and the certainly don't want it now. Didi"
"100D, 150D and 200D average are being created for weekly. 100 is $40. Once we get out of this 100D weekly the next levels for daily are upward direction."
This stock will surprise in the next 24 months. Stock price 80 to 100!!!
Might go green?
Nicely undervalued.
"Uber's quarterly profit came from marking up the value of its Didi stake by 1.4 billion and Aurora stake by 450 million. So what will the markdown of the Didi stake be next quarter? Didi shares are falling fast. Softbank now down by 6 billion, Uber now down by about 2.8 to 3 billion. Ouch.Uber's timing of the tricky mark up was superb. The IPO was June 30th, the date used to calculate the value of the stake. Didi now down 40% from there."
This company was sailing before the pandemic on a path to profitability. Why would it not do the same once the UI benefits are shut off and and covid cases peak?
"My prediction following earnings is taht UBER will gap down to $38.62, uts not going gto be pretty regardless of what they say."
"Uber’s stake in Didi has also dropped by $2bn as China looks to publish US-listed firms.Softbank’s stake in Didi, which was made through its Vision Fund, is its largest single bet on Chinese tech.However, it has shareholders in a string of other Chinese companies, leaving it exposed to shifting regulatory pressures in the country.Authorities have since turned their focus to Softbank-backed Full Track Alliance, sparking a 43 per cent fall in its share price since the start of July."
Great ER!
"so the question is.. will having riders pay more to pay for drivers' benefits impact business more by 1) reducing riders, or 2) eventually increase business by attracting more drivers.?"
I’m expecting 10% pop tonight after Lyft reports…then $55 after Wednesday night
congrats to those who bought yesterday for 38:30 after hours
There are no buyers yet.
Someone explain how DASH is worth as much as UBER. Uber does the same delivery but then has the largest ride share software on the globe. It’s insanity.
"It has been painful to hold this one. But I will keep my 2000 shares. The chart will move slowly with time toward 80s. It was expensive when IPO came out and therefore, it's not moving crazy compare to Social media IPOs which came out the same timeline. Also, its becoming part of our daily life like FB and Google are."
"Reversal today, buying with everything I’ve got."
"Danny CrichtonFri, August 20, 2021, 6:18 PMIn a late Friday night blow to Uber, Lyft and other gig worker-centered companies, a superior court judge ruled that California’s Proposition 22, which was passed in 2020 and designed to overrule the state’s controversial AB-5 law on the employment status of gig workers, violates the state’s constitution."
This stock is completely broken. It’s so ready to dive into high 20s in the next few weeks. Everyone is selling.
Uber is great!

"Didi has to preform well from here or else Masason gets another margin call and has to sell another block. I think a bigger SoftBank unwind is on the way, they didn’t have 2B on hand? Too much leverage?"

"again.... after bad news.... a complete hard reversal directly to max pain.... for like the 10th time in the last month... where you end up with headlines like:""Shares of Lyft, Uber move higher after court says gig worker push is unconstitutional"""

Come back to $37 and then back to $50
Uber is a longterm hold so I don’t care if the price moves a few bucks down. I’m buying more at 30. Great time to buy just yet.
Best time to buy is when you are most scared to buy. Pandemic won’t last for ever but transportation will.
Bought some puts
my opinion they still have stock to sell from the other day and to clear up the option positions from Fridays expiration. got a nice initiation this morning though with a price target of 65
"As I said, going to $38!"
"Here come the 's. Longs get it, but remember, we're long."

we will be $50 soon . when you see to much negative that means hedge are accumulating......

Gap up 48?
Looks like we are back to do a GAP Fill from $36-$39 area. Looking to get in at $37 if it comes down a bit more. About 92% of the time gaps will get filled on charts. Waiting for the exact same thing on Moderna $260ish levels
$45 this month
Adding more shares 5000

Uber is in the same position as amzn was 2009. Income statements look eerily similar past 3 years compared to Amazon in 2006-2009. MC about the same as well. Oh Amazon is just a book company. Oh Uber is just a cab company. We know what ends up happening
my last post today. I'm watching either a lot of buying or covering on the trades. some big blocks going off.

The year is 2030 and this is Travis Kalanick who has just returned as Uber's CEO. Uber still loses money every year. [Great revenue ONCE AGAIN THIS QUARTER. wHY STILL NO PROFITS? We are waiting on our great platform and market powers to make us EBIDTA PROFITABLE BY 2035...
"I really this will create a huge buying pressure tmr for the fund managers to load up, I would buy this at the open if I had more cash….it’s going to create a huge buying spree for Uber investors."
volume is soaring veri fast

7 Uber Analysts Break Down Q2 Earnings: 'Risk Is Passing And Stock Oversold'
Right now uber is super undervalue. long term super confident :)! target price 60$ next year.
$25 by Christmas
"Where do we draw the line with gig workers? Pretty soon everyone will be a gig worker and no one will have any benefits or rights. The California govt is right to stop this now. People say go work at Wendys, what is the fast food joints only want gig workers as well? Where does it stop. We can not all be robot or AI engineers."
"SoftBank aims to sell 45 million shares with a price range of $44.15 to $46.14, according to people familiar with the details who asked not to be identified discussing private information. Uber shares fell 5.1% in post-market trading, while rival ride-hailing firm Lyft Inc.Jul 28, 2021Whichever genius fund bought the 45 million shares is not down about 11%, or $ 237 million, so far."
"hopefully, my call 42$ for Friday will succeed. still, uber is super undervalue for the long term."
$40 for 4 miles in a big metro area….sustainable business model?
They had some interesting insights about UBER on (http://Multistockalerts.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
Any pull back in September and I add 500-1000 more shares. This is a 300.00 stock in jist a couple years.
Sold my AMZN shares for UBER
"So it is about 1mm shares. Uber (NYSE: UBER) shares traded lower after-hours, falling over 4.5%, Initially, it wasn't clear what was causing the decline but chatter soon surfaced of a large block trade. Bloomberg later confirmed the chatter, reporting that a block of 45 million shares was offered via Goldman Sachs. The block was offered at $44.15 to $46.15 each. Bloomberg cited a person familiar with the matter."
"Very good turn around from the after market lows from yesterday, should be up to $50 by the close tomorrow."
a big bunch of 40 dollar calls and puts this week. perhaps that's the drag here today
iSUN received contracts for 16 new projects in VT and NH should see a nice move north for these shares this morning
"Earnings will go well, strong reopening numbers to come. Uber has wisely acquired companies that add innovation to their underlying business model. Very similar to Amazon spreading their hands into many companies. Uber will be a travel conglomerate in the future. The US gov also needs companies like Uber to compete internationally against Didi. Even though Uber has an ownership stake US Gov doesn’t want CCP owned companies becoming the norm here. Uber is an American gem and represents a highly successful American startup internationally. institutional ownership is heavily entrenched in Uber as well. Yes this is not a hyper growth company, But you should’ve known that. However, Uber 100% has the potential to become a trillion dollar conglomerate of transportation services."
"Buy now, it will fly soon."
Jist grabbed 500 more
hoping my order at 38 might gets filled at the open
Told y’all last week at $41 $uber was gonna go up

When you base your entire business model on HOW LOW CAN WE PAY THESE PEOPLE and you still can't make money then obviously the problem is not the cost of labor but waste in the corporate structure.
Wow. Held this less than 7 hours and Google already flooded thumbnails with delivery driver horror stories.
(http://Thetraderguide.com) is a must for any trader. Their watchlist which covers pre-market movers is one of the best researched in the industry. I don’t start trading without reading their daily email each morning!
"Uber's stake in Didi, which they marked UP to create a Q2 loss of only -509 million, is now down by 3.88 billion since July 1st. The write down next quarter will be huge. Taking the losses back down to seem like the good old days of 2019, when Uber lost a billion each month."
Lyft posted great results and is now 5% down... Let's hope this doesn't happen to us tomorrow
I think UBER is a BUY at this price level. Loaded up last night and will hold long. This stock will start to climb up very soon.
