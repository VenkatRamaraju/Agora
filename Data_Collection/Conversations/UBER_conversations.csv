"Drivers get paid to drive, Ron added, and the more transportation gets disrupted, the more drivers wait around at warehouses for loads that aren't ready or for shipping containers that have yet to be unloaded.Uber Freight has one million drivers on its platform and uses its app to make every driver as efficient as possible. Instead of waiting, Uber tries to find shipments that are ready now and get them on the road as quickly as possible."
"$Uber As an uber driver when I look at my earning and uber's earnings from my trips, I see a lot of money . In addition to that, we have more than enough drivers so promotions are gone in my region ( south east), which means higher earnings for Uber. While others try to find labor, uber has more than enough drivers. Therefore, the $uber stock price should not be here. Thanks for selling me Uber stock for last 2 days. You keep selling and I will keep buying it at these low prices (less than $45). November 4 is its earnings day and November 8 is the day when the USA will lift international travel ban. I suggest everyone stay calm and keep buying $Uber. Thanks!!"
"I have big beef and Uber will continue running into year end to $75. Rippin bhos, yo"
"If UBER has a standout solid earnings report coupled with upbeat forecasts, we will see the same twenty point move up as last year post earnings…"
"This stock is massively undervalued. I predict a move towards 50 before the ER, and then a steady increase to 60s following ER. Buy while this is still on discount."
Bought for 40$. now it is 44.74. Time to re-enter.
UBER will be $49.00 today ..it is a buy stock..
The minute I sell up it goes.. It is right on the 20 day support
"More people trying out Teslas through Hertz = more people buying Teslas for themselves and using future autonomous capabilities in lieu of Uber. If you don't think optimism in TSLA is fueling pessimism in Uber, you're wrong. That and the thousands of options contracts sold for free premiums by large holders make for a bleak outlook for Uber shares."
45$ for that is cheap could go to 100-120
Most people remain poor only because friends and relatives discouraged and advise them against investing and trading BTC while the wise ones kept investing and growing higher financially
"Rental car company Hertz Global will supply up to 50,000 Tesla cars to Uber drivers, with drivers for the ride-hailing group offering services with the rented electric vehicles in the U.S. as soon as next week."
"Uber, Tesla, Hertz. What a trifecta!"
"It will be interesting to hear how Uber freight did with cargo bottle neck. Were there more drivers or less? The 24/7 port unloading won't show up till the Q4 but my guess it was good for their freight business. I know its just a part of their overall business but one I expect to be a major part moving forward.. The SP in 40's will be a ""I shoulda"" moment in the coming future."
You need all the weak hands to sell for the washout. A quick read of the schizophrenia today and I think we just shook the last of the weak hands. See you at $65!
I bought at 40 . has been good bar one dip. This is probably a genuine dip
"Guys what's stopping Tesla from reaching fully autonomous robotaxis and taking huge chunks of Uber/Lyft's business. Obv won't happen overnight but when Musk can raise endless piles of cash with virtually zero cost of capital, I wouldn't lean too heavy into a barely profitable business in Uber longer term. What can rideshares do when TSLA gains the entire industry's market cap in one day?"
options from 44 or 45 to 50 will expire worthless tomorrow. all damage done on the stock and no volume today says wait until monday. frustrated but not selling 1 share
"$42 next week, then closes gap at $40 after earnings. I'm now net short beef!"
Next Thursday is judgement day for UBER shareholders.
Great company . I am making great money. Thanks UBER>>
Uber Freight with all these shipping issues sky's the limit
Been watching Uber for sometime. Do you guys think should I wait to buy it under $40 or after ER or wait to confirm $50? Or take chance and buy half position now at market price? I installed the app and order a meal at one of Vancouver hotels day ago and I liked the experience. Never used Uber driver though.
You should by now earnings are going to go through the roof
50 today ?
"More outdoor events, concerts everywhere in the country especially Vegas, sports season, more air and sea travels etc., UBER will be busy to take their customers to and from place to place from now through the great Holidays seasons... stock expects to go higher"
"Look at this volume and action. Just algos trading against themselves at this point. The big slurper has stopped the vacuum in advance of earnings. I can't predict the future, however, I would be very surprised if this doesn't rip one way or the other. I believe its going North when guidance for growth and profitability are super juicy...muy jugo!"
"As gig economy companies work to woo drivers back to their platforms, they have been making some expensive promises. Breaking them could prove even more costly.On Tuesday, the Federal Trade Commission said it sent a notice of penalty offenses to more than 1,100 companies, warning that those that mislead people about potential earnings could incur fines that can exceed $43,000 per offense. For gig economy companies, this includes ""pitching a steady second income"" for drivers that may prove to be less than advertised, the agency said. Uber Technologies (as well as Uber Eats), DoorDash, Instacart and Lyft all received the notice."
Any news stock is moving after hours ?
The YouTubers don't know about the Tesla deal. They will all be talking about it tonight.
"Only thing that matters is earnings. You see the volume drying up. These are just programs trading against themselves right now. If they have good earnings and strong guidance then bumhos will be ripped like the salmon of Capistrano my friends. Forward guidance will be very strong, bumhos will be very sore. We have a date Thursday!"
Waiting for a similar FORD EV announcement shortly…
Owned since first month and dollar averaged more to position till largest holding... avg cost ~ 34. After today... IDK
the trends.... run up into earnings. selloff after good earnings... the another run up. not sure what pathUber will take but it will be higher at year end. 
BUY NOW IT IS CHEAP>
"It's mind-numbing the lack of information being pursued regarding the acquistion of Transplace this past summer. The leading private 3PL in logistics and freight contracts with Nike, Michelin, Novolex, etc. They were the largest private 3PL. Now they are public with Uber under Uber Freight. Competitors consist of Knight/Swift, CH Robinson, XPO, etc. With Uber acquiring Transplace under their umbrella they will blow these competitors out of the water. Uber's days of being a ""rideshare"" company at the forefront are over. This company is now LOGISTICS that will encompass the entire industry. Transplace was/is highly profitable year over year and growing. The mobile applications Uber is able to create in conjunction with Transplace that will be in the pockets (cellphones) of shippers and truck drivers is going to run the competitor brokerages out of business.BUY NOW AND THANK ME LATER."
This will be a $200B plus company. I will not miss the mark on this one and sell out. This is a core near mega cap holding of too many institutions to fail.
i still think we get close to 50 before next weeks earnings on thursday the 4th
Snooze . No volume options scare off
So Uber is going to buy/LEASE 50K Teslas so drivers can now use them instead of their own car plus paying them etc. Why be so disingenuous. The real truth is these Teslas will be robotaxis with no drivers.
