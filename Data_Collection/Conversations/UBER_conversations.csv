Snooze . No volume options scare off
They had some interesting insights about UBER on (http://Multistockalerts.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
This will double.
"A report came out showing that Uber has widen the gap with Lyft on both time and money. It's pretty much 13% quicker and cheaper. That's a huge improvement and a great gap to be filled. It's a gap now widely seen by customers. All the macrotrends are now positive for Uber, the next year will be great and the stock price will appreciate. A lot."
Fading. Everyday.
"they did it again over 50,000 option contracts were written today from 46 to 50. nightmare"
UBER seems like it really wants to take off! 50 soon.
"Question for the Longs of the Board - I like to here your thoughts and opinions.What are you expecting from ER on Nov. 4 will they finally exceed expectations and move North toward targets? The analyst appear to be all over the Map with a few saying Overperforming and others says Sell?I was also reading about the Tesla / Hertz deal after Hertz bankruptcy filings and thoughts about the deal?There RSI is above 50. The MACD is positive and above its signal line. The configuration is positive. Moreover, the stock is above its 20 and 50 day moving average (respectively at 46.3545 and 42.9608) The stock is said to be positive at $44.00 support.Any thoughts and advise from longs would be appreciated.Thanks,VR"
$55 after earnings. That is two weeks from tomorrow. Get it now brochachos or miss the bus. Super low vol right now so this recent price action don't mean doodie. Follow the fat Crowe and buy now or you'll miss it.
UBER is experiencing the same stock price fluctuations as before third quarter 2020… this predicts a potential significant upside in November…
"Pressure is building. This is going to explode after earnings when the market realizes that UBER is going to have 3 profitable and growing business segments in ride hailing, delivery and freight. So juicy"
Blue Horse loves UBER 
"I have big beef and Uber will continue running into year end to $75. Rippin bhos, yo"
"5 star strong buy , scale, margin expansion from cost cutting and raised guidance. I WOULD BUY TODAY RIGHT NOW."
Great job UBER. LYFT is up today vs UBER is down!
UBER LYFT BA RCL NCLH will be up at least 20-30% from here after all travel ban will end Nov. 8 for international visitors....big boys were taking the travel sector badly last 2-3 weeks which is their best game guys.
"The slurp may be back, brohams!"
"It's mind-numbing the lack of information being pursued regarding the acquistion of Transplace this past summer. The leading private 3PL in logistics and freight contracts with Nike, Michelin, Novolex, etc. They were the largest private 3PL. Now they are public with Uber under Uber Freight. Competitors consist of Knight/Swift, CH Robinson, XPO, etc. With Uber acquiring Transplace under their umbrella they will blow these competitors out of the water. Uber's days of being a ""rideshare"" company at the forefront are over. This company is now LOGISTICS that will encompass the entire industry. Transplace was/is highly profitable year over year and growing. The mobile applications Uber is able to create in conjunction with Transplace that will be in the pockets (cellphones) of shippers and truck drivers is going to run the competitor brokerages out of business.BUY NOW AND THANK ME LATER."
"Guys what's stopping Tesla from reaching fully autonomous robotaxis and taking huge chunks of Uber/Lyft's business. Obv won't happen overnight but when Musk can raise endless piles of cash with virtually zero cost of capital, I wouldn't lean too heavy into a barely profitable business in Uber longer term. What can rideshares do when TSLA gains the entire industry's market cap in one day?"
a boatload of 45 and 46 puts written today for friday. these traders are able to have their way with the stock until a clearer picture going forward is established. there is very heavy resistance in the 48's from those who were trapped on the last collapse. earnings report can't come soon enough
Whales starting to pile in... watch the volume trade
i wouldn't be surprised if stock hits 50 by next weeks the 15th options expiration

"Uber, Tesla, Hertz. What a trifecta!"
Whats wrong with this thing good news and still down
RIP Uber
Do you guys follow http://the-alphatrader.com/? It seems way better than all the spam on the UBER board - The alerts have been great!
Well this is disheartening
Big Beef? Buy UBER
Uber - Cheers! Uber Completes Acquisition of Drizly
"Next catalyst is earnings. If this is where we are after the tax bill and dilution press release then we are going to see a big move post earnings. If good it will rip you a secondbho, if not, then explosive ria. Either way, watch your cornhole as it’s going to be explosive"
Owned since first month and dollar averaged more to position till largest holding... avg cost ~ 34. After today... IDK
U.S will officially open for tourists worldwide starting 11/11 guys!
I just want to ask you guys how much did you make from the stock since IPO?
"It will be interesting to hear how Uber freight did with cargo bottle neck. Were there more drivers or less? The 24/7 port unloading won't show up till the Q4 but my guess it was good for their freight business. I know its just a part of their overall business but one I expect to be a major part moving forward.. The SP in 40's will be a ""I shoulda"" moment in the coming future."
Check today’s volume. Whatever weak hands were left have sold. Big boys still buying otherwise we wouldn’t see the support being firm likemyjohnson and volume so light. The slurp remains intact!
Seeing people just bashing the bid on the $48 strike calls expiring this week.
a good amount of volume written today at 47 and 50 for both this weeks expiration and next weeks
Great company . I am making great money. Thanks UBER>>
UBER >$47 will happen in November. Hang in there.
Uber will be featured on Jim Cramer’s Mad Money tonight ￼
"This stock is massively undervalued. I predict a move towards 50 before the ER, and then a steady increase to 60s following ER. Buy while this is still on discount."
Hope uber comes out strong. Next Thursday . Big day. Go longs
"More outdoor events, concerts everywhere in the country especially Vegas, sports season, more air and sea travels etc., UBER will be busy to take their customers to and from place to place from now through the great Holidays seasons... stock expects to go higher"
drizly deal done so the government approval must be done.
Waiting for a similar FORD EV announcement shortly…
48 today
$50 today
The Long haul freight squeeze will act as a massive catalyst for UBER Freight to rapidly gain market share and stand shoulder to shoulder with ride and eats/last mile ...
Most people remain poor only because friends and relatives discouraged and advise them against investing and trading BTC while the wise ones kept investing and growing higher financially
May bumhos rip into earnings. $60 in November Beefamaniacs!
"in at 45.70 for $5,000. Time to start building this position."
"Now down about 11% from a couple weeks ago. Strap in y'all, probably gonna be another 11% until this thing bounces"
50 today ?
"Look how much it cost to park at these venues and then you come out to your car after the game it's been broken into ,the future is uber all you need is money and patience"
So Uber is going to buy/LEASE 50K Teslas so drivers can now use them instead of their own car plus paying them etc. Why be so disingenuous. The real truth is these Teslas will be robotaxis with no drivers.
BUY NOW IT IS CHEAP>
"If UBER has a standout solid earnings report coupled with upbeat forecasts, we will see the same twenty point move up as last year post earnings…"
so much for last fridays breakout .
"Look how low that volume is. Consolidation has occurred, new hands now own, move over $50 is on the horizon. High likelihood of running to $60 if we break $50..."
Shorts are about to give up on max pain today…$47 on the way. Everyone left is in wait and see mode so earnings are going to be a monster catalyst one way or the other
lots of 46 put protection put on today for friday. we stuck in the mud.
"Now we run, bruhs!"
"$Uber As an uber driver when I look at my earning and uber's earnings from my trips, I see a lot of money . In addition to that, we have more than enough drivers so promotions are gone in my region ( south east), which means higher earnings for Uber. While others try to find labor, uber has more than enough drivers. Therefore, the $uber stock price should not be here. Thanks for selling me Uber stock for last 2 days. You keep selling and I will keep buying it at these low prices (less than $45). November 4 is its earnings day and November 8 is the day when the USA will lift international travel ban. I suggest everyone stay calm and keep buying $Uber. Thanks!!"
And now we slurpslurp to green
"Judge shoots down law that kept Uber and Lyft drivers from being employees11:17 pm ET October 1, 2021 (MarketWatch) PrintBy Jeremy C. OwensAppeals court rules that law backed by record-breaking millions from Uber, Lyft, DoorDash and other gig companies is unconstitutional for barring future legislative moves on workers' compensation, collective bargainingA judge late Friday shot down a law that would have allowed app-based companies to continue treating drivers as contractors instead of employees in California, ruling unconstitutional a proposition passed by voters in 2020 after a record-breaking campaign.I am still looking for the court and judge ruling in this appeals decision released Friday evening in California. Can anyone help?"
Ok let's go up now?
All roads lead to Uber
Don't ever under estimate the power of pricing. This will be a blow-out quarter.
"Strong resistance at 48, if we break it, 50 is easy."
"We will see $50 next week. Just wait until upgrades start rolling in and you have to wear sweatpants to work because you have a permanent UBERboner from the price ripping bhos. Slainte, beaches!"
"Building a base, brohams. We will see $55 in 3 weeks time...$65 by YE. Buy, buy, buy!"
WTRH Let’s see shorts lose 500% or more. See them buy their borrowed shares at a $7 to $10 range…. $GRUB $DASH $WTRH $UBER $LYFTMORGAN STANLEY owns almost 13 million shares of WAITR. M&A buy what acquirer do you foresee???
That’s a big tax bill 
Wait till you see how much money is made when the driver and all his baggage is removed from rideshare.
Max pain is $46 for Friday. Down on good news and average volume…this is just traders trying to protect their option positions. The real near term challenge is that demand for the stock has been pretty light. If Dara can make the pitch on the 4th then this will blow a new hole in ya bumcheeks as sellers have been primarily traders.
"Drivers get paid to drive, Ron added, and the more transportation gets disrupted, the more drivers wait around at warehouses for loads that aren't ready or for shipping containers that have yet to be unloaded.Uber Freight has one million drivers on its platform and uses its app to make every driver as efficient as possible. Instead of waiting, Uber tries to find shipments that are ready now and get them on the road as quickly as possible."
You should by now earnings are going to go through the roof
"Only thing that matters is earnings. You see the volume drying up. These are just programs trading against themselves right now. If they have good earnings and strong guidance then bumhos will be ripped like the salmon of Capistrano my friends. Forward guidance will be very strong, bumhos will be very sore. We have a date Thursday!"
"Looking at the huge call wall at 46 and 47 that are expired on tomorrow and next Friday, we can almost be sure that Wall Street wouldn't let this thing go above 47 in two weeks. Meanwhile, huge put wall is also preventing thing thing form going below 45. What a manipulated stock"
The YouTubers don't know about the Tesla deal. They will all be talking about it tonight.
"This is not your grandfather's stock market. Mergers, patents, and any positive news never make stock prices go up in value."
The reason Uber driver becomes staff instead of freelancer is due to the state being too weak to accommodate free market economy.
"Taking a flying taxi? Uber and Boeing join forces and want flying city transport within 3 yearsJoby Aviation is developing flying taxis together with Uber and Boeing and wants to open the first skyports within three years. The skyports will be places that act like a bus stop, but instead of getting on the bus, a flying taxi will take you to your destination. ""We want to install at least 200 functioning 'mini-airports' for these types of taxis within a few years, but in fact there should be many more."""
"Sports, Concerts, Holidays, Airports, Cruises, Train are pack with travelers. I think $60 or more by the year end is reasonable. Let's go UBER and investors."
"Switched back 1,000 shares of Uber. After reading Uber is going to do well on earnings"
Uber has to come out strong this quarter with earnings .. for the stock to move
Bummer. Trimmed a lot myself today.
I bought at 40 . has been good bar one dip. This is probably a genuine dip
Anyone knows why down after hours?

Uber Freight with all these shipping issues sky's the limit
who ever sold those 48 strike calls today made a ton and kept their stock to boot
"Environmentally, I see the advantages and medium term--3-5years--I see the synergies between Uber and Tesla joining hands in matrimony one day especially including the next step to autonomous driving. Is this a perpetual rent 52 weeks in the year? Generally speaking, EV energy savings are about one third to 40 percent of gasoline powered vehicles annually excluding registration fees. Plus, the initial capital outlay of installing chargers in their homes. I would like to see how Uber presents this model to their drivers as ""cost savings""? It's clearly a rent or own which is cheaper example, but even if the driver can't afford to own, the cost of renting will no doubt eat into his or her margins. A full year's rent is over 15K at the rates being initially touted before electrifying."
options from 44 or 45 to 50 will expire worthless tomorrow. all damage done on the stock and no volume today says wait until monday. frustrated but not selling 1 share
45$ for that is cheap could go to 100-120
Only UBER has the market weight to drive deals for EV like today’s HERTZ announcement… economy of scale baby!!
All major indices are trading above resistance and that is great news
Any news stock is moving after hours ?
Market needs to get behind Uber this will be a huge economic indicator for the next few quarters to determine the vibrancy of the recovery
This company has had what a 1-2b cash burn and has roughly 7b left. what about the past three years on their finances has been impressive. Real tech has great margins. This company is 10 yrs old and has arguably the worst margins in the world. This ones gonna pop and lead a bunch of others with it.
need to hit $55 today lol
"$42 next week, then closes gap at $40 after earnings. I'm now net short beef!"
"I am a huge fan of this stock, I added today and like the outlook. I use uber eats often and even with the promos its definitely more money but so convenient and I think they will continue to so great in this space. So much potential for profit here in my opinion."
You need all the weak hands to sell for the washout. A quick read of the schizophrenia today and I think we just shook the last of the weak hands. See you at $65!
DRIP DRIP DRIP. Absolutely no buyers
"So if Domino's, Pizza hut, and Papa Johns can't find drivers and they pay hourly wage, + tips and commission, compared to Uber whom pays a measly $2 per delivery, how will Uber attract drivers?"
"Anyone seen the size of Tepper's UBER? He has one of the biggest UBER's on the street. Sell now and miss the run, beaches!"
"In transition to EV from ICE autos, a large percentage of auto buyers will pause and turn to ride share while waiting for the EV price and availability to meet their needs... buy up UBER as a lot will never continue to auto ownership..."
My sources told me Dara has told big shareholders to pack not one but two pairs of extra skivvies for the earnings call because the Freight numbers are going to blow some nuclear skid marks out ya bumcheeks
"Rental car company Hertz Global will supply up to 50,000 Tesla cars to Uber drivers, with drivers for the ride-hailing group offering services with the rented electric vehicles in the U.S. as soon as next week."
UBER will be $49.00 today ..it is a buy stock..
"Look at this volume and action. Just algos trading against themselves at this point. The big slurper has stopped the vacuum in advance of earnings. I can't predict the future, however, I would be very surprised if this doesn't rip one way or the other. I believe its going North when guidance for growth and profitability are super juicy...muy jugo!"

The minute I sell up it goes.. It is right on the 20 day support
It's a time to bounce up!
"Richard, you could also face billions in fines if you mislead investors on this chat forum. It's a trade off, don't you see...?"
"A decline of 2.3 billion of market cap today, cannot be explained by one value added tax assessment from the Saudis of 100 million. It really means that no one knows how many backward looking assessments from other countries will appear. Maybe a lot. Uber didn't pay these taxes because they insist on calling their drivers contractors. Well, that argument has been lost in the UK and much of the EU. Now the taxes must be paid, and there will be tonnes."
the trends.... run up into earnings. selloff after good earnings... the another run up. not sure what pathUber will take but it will be higher at year end. 
"If you’re a day trader, you should definitely check out (http://Pick-stocks.com). They send a watchlist covering the top pre-market movers every day before the open. It’s a great way to pick out potential trades for the day."
Bought for 40$. now it is 44.74. Time to re-enter.

"Mortimer, we're back!!!"
Lol so predictable
Uber could face billions in fines if they mislead drivers about their compensation. Would Uber do that?
"More people trying out Teslas through Hertz = more people buying Teslas for themselves and using future autonomous capabilities in lieu of Uber. If you don't think optimism in TSLA is fueling pessimism in Uber, you're wrong. That and the thousands of options contracts sold for free premiums by large holders make for a bleak outlook for Uber shares."
this shouldve been 100+ already.
i still think we get close to 50 before next weeks earnings on thursday the 4th
FedEx recently announced it will kick off a collaboration with @aurora_inno and PACCAR to test Aurora’s autonomous driving technology in PACCAR state-of-the-art Autonomous Vehicle Platform (AVP) equipped trucks within @FedEx linehaul trucking operations.
"If UBER closes above $49 today, UBER will be poised to duplicate the upside surge seen this time in 2020. The represents a twenty point + move... and this gets UBER back to the all time high back in Feb-Mar..."
Lol some brave soul buys a couple million shares midday and it just gets sold and sold on a green market day…
Next Thursday is judgement day for UBER shareholders.
Been watching Uber for sometime. Do you guys think should I wait to buy it under $40 or after ER or wait to confirm $50? Or take chance and buy half position now at market price? I installed the app and order a meal at one of Vancouver hotels day ago and I liked the experience. Never used Uber driver though.
"Holidays, travel, events, sports, winter.... so many catalysts it's bonkers. $60 by year end totally reasonable."
Share count went up by 50+ million today......
