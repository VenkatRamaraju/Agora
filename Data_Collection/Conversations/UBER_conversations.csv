"The city of Chicago filed a wide-ranging lawsuit against DoorDash Inc. and Grubhub Inc. on Friday, accusing the meal-delivery platforms of engaging in deceptive and predatory business practices.The lawsuit alleges the companies' practices harm consumers, delivery workers and restaurants. The city claims DoorDash (DASH) and Grubhub deceive consumers by advertising a lower upfront cost for delivery and sometimes misrepresenting the cost of items at restaurants, which the city calls a ""bait and switch"" because in most cases consumers are too invested in an order to back out when they see additional fees at the end of a transaction.For example, according to the suit, ""During the ordering process, DoorDash and Caviar withhold the existence and amount of the Service Fee, Small Order Fee, and Chicago Fee on the Platforms until the checkout screen.""The $1.50-per-order ""Chicago Fee"" isn't imposed by the city, but rather a reaction by some delivery companies to an earlier attempt by Chicago to rein in the apps' fees. The lawsuit says DoorDash is trying to recoup some of the money it lost from a 15% commission cap imposed by the city, which like other cities around the nation has tried to limit what huge companies like DoorDash were collecting from struggling restaurants during the coronavirus pandemic.""DoorDash has experienced tremendous growth on the backs of restaurants andconsumers,"" the lawsuit states, noting that DoorDash, including its Caviar division, grew its market share in Chicago during the pandemic from 38% to 57%."
Why is UBER tanking today?
"Uber or Lyft should find a way to deliver kids to school. With the national shortage of bus drivers that’d be a money maker! Apparently, city bureaucrats can’t handle it, give capitalism a try. Look what is done for Waste Management."

"Judge: California ride-hailing law is unconstitutionalEconomy Aug 21, 2021 2:06 PM EDTLOS ANGELES — A judge Friday struck down a California ballot measure that exempted Uber and other app-based ride-hailing and delivery services from a state law requiring drivers to be classified as employees eligible for benefits and job protections.Alameda County Superior Court Judge Frank Roesch ruled that Proposition 22 was unconstitutional.Voters approved the measure in November after Uber, Lyft and other services spent $200 million in its favor, making it the most expensive ballot measure in state history.Uber said it planned to appeal, setting up a fight that could likely end up in the California Supreme Court.“This ruling ignores the will of the overwhelming majority of California voters and defies both logic and the law,” company spokesman Noah Edwardsen said. “You don’t have to take our word for it: California’s attorney general strongly defended Proposition 22’s constitutionality in this very case.”He said the measure will remain in force pending the appeal.The judge sided with three drivers and the Service Employees International Union in a lawsuit that argued the measure improperly removed the state Legislature’s ability to grant workers the right to access to the state workers’ compensation program.“For two years, drivers have been saying that democracy cannot be bought. And today’s decision shows they were right,” said Bob Schoonover, president of the SEIU California State Council.Proposition 22 shielded app-based ride-hailing and delivery companies from a labor law that required such services to treat drivers as employees and not independent contractors, who don’t have to receive benefits such as paid sick leave or unemployment insurance.Uber and Lyft threatened to leave the state if voters rejected the measure.Labor spent about $20 million to challenge the proposition.The Honest Truth is Dara has had no clue how to make Uber profitable. Loses keep piling up for 12 years:The state Supreme Court initially declined to hear the case in February — mainly on procedural grounds — but left open the possibility of a lower court challenge."

"Bottom Line on Uber StockUber looks to be on the path towards profitable growth. Don't let recent cash bleed numbers cloud the long-term story, which still looks very much intact.Undoubtedly, a lot needs to go right over the next 18 months for the stock to climb out of its rut. As management looks to improve upon its operating margins by taking advantage of further M&A opportunities, there will be no telling just how high the stock is capable of flying.Uber stock has stalled out for now, but may just be a matter of time before it can put its foot to the gas."
"Where do we draw the line with gig workers? Pretty soon everyone will be a gig worker and no one will have any benefits or rights. The California govt is right to stop this now. People say go work at Wendys, what is the fast food joints only want gig workers as well? Where does it stop. We can not all be robot or AI engineers."
Uber is a longterm hold so I don’t care if the price moves a few bucks down. I’m buying more at 30. Great time to buy just yet.
Someone explain how DASH is worth as much as UBER. Uber does the same delivery but then has the largest ride share software on the globe. It’s insanity.
