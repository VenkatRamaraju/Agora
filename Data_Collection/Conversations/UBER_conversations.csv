"If you’re a day trader, you should definitely check out (http://Pick-stocks.com). They send a watchlist covering the top pre-market movers every day before the open. It’s a great way to pick out potential trades for the day."
Last push of the shorts to see if they can get down to max pain of $46. Lot of trading games happening right now. Will bounce back into end of day
So slurpy these days…
"Today is mark to market day for investments, 30 Sept. Can anyone with an accounting background help here? Uber marked the value of their 12% stake in Didi on 30 June, when Didi's market cap was 67 billion, so about 8 billion?Then two days later Didi starts to fall to its current market cap of 38 billion, making Uber's 12% worth 4.56 billion.On the last earning report, Uber reduced the appearance of its losses by marking up the Didi stake by 1.47 billion. Will it now have to mark the value of that stake down, and by how much? 8 billion - 4.56 billion= 3.44 billion? Or what?"
"All that the Drizly acquisition signifies is the current management is helpless to grow to profits in mobility, and are throwing more money at buying revenues in delivery. I think everyone can agree that delivery is a money losing business, with very low margins in the best of cases, and ruthless competitors in DoorDash. Dara K is lost, in charge of a lost cause. He is very good at looking into camera lenses and promising fake adjusted ebidta profits soon, very soon. Those, however, don't include stock based compensation, and a long list of other costs. BS."
Painful... a drop below 44.5 and I think we're in for more than a routine consolidation after a leg up
"in at 45.70 for $5,000. Time to start building this position."
We have gone erect…prepare for explosion…$100 by year end
$50 today
The Long haul freight squeeze will act as a massive catalyst for UBER Freight to rapidly gain market share and stand shoulder to shoulder with ride and eats/last mile ...
who ever sold those 48 strike calls today made a ton and kept their stock to boot
"$UBER feels like one of the simplest plays on the waning of the current covid/delta variant. While uber has indicated a robust return to ridership it is still deeply affected by the US current cases. In order to profit off of declining case counts I believe UBER - regardless of economic noise, will see accelerating share price.I like to keep it simple. $UBER is a layup over the next 2-6 months ( somewhat dependent on our current curve flattening out)"
"I feel a hundo. I feel a hundo, babe…"
So much for 50 tho...
"California Supreme Court Judge Frank Roesch ""Ruled that that the entirety of Proposition 22 is unenforceable"""
Uber is not looking back .. last chance to catch that train!
This is the most underappreciated growth stock in the market right now. This name will pay off big time for an a patient investor willing to hold for the long term.
"My take away for this week is that UBER ended the week coupled to the market... I see next week with significant upside potential as long #$%$ the Market opens strong and gains... if so, we will move past the 50..."
need to hit $55 today lol
And now we slurpslurp to green
"I should of kept it and not sold, I would be a millionaire today. blah blah blah. Just buy it and keep it."
100 End of the year 2021 big winner for buy and hold
"UBER has reconnected to the S&P 500 track, it is no longer divergent… it will now float upwards with the major indices…"
Looking for UBER +50 this week if we are to track in a similar curve to last spring...
"If UBER closes above $49 today, UBER will be poised to duplicate the upside surge seen this time in 2020. The represents a twenty point + move... and this gets UBER back to the all time high back in Feb-Mar..."
Really is the best value play in the entire market
"$120 each way from Daytona Beach to the Orlando Airport, are they crazy? Neighbors will drive me there for FREE or a local community person doing the trip for a fee will do it for $40, bye Uber"
It’s a sign! Uber trips to airports soar by 328% as Brits get a taste for travel
Bank of America names its top stock picks for the fourth quarter UBER
When this is a hundred dollar stock remember you had the opportunity to get in while it was still cheap.
If Uber can drum up a positive EBITDA 3rd or 4th Q while we're still in pandemic mode just think what explosive earning power they will have when the world opens back up in full throttle mode. They might even be sandbagging quarter estimates. This is one to hold close to your chest for many years!
"Awesome, this is gonna explode....."
$AFRM has a 38B market cap with $870m in revenue -- losing -$300M on said revenue. $SNAP has a 120B market cap with $3b in revenue -- losing -$570m on said revenue.$UBER has a 90B market cap with $13B in revenue -- losing -$3.8B on said revenue. ======$WISH has a 3B m cap with $2.8B in revenue -- losing -$750m on said revenue. ========BUY WISH GET RICH

buy Uber before is too late
Look at that slurp...
When growth stocks come back in vogue Uber will go to $100

i wouldn't be surprised if stock hits 50 by next weeks the 15th options expiration
Afternoon sell off. Earnings should be good in a few weeks potentially showing a break even or a profit EBIDTA. Should get a nice boost then just as LYFT did when they showed similar results
Volume is slowing...sellers are exhausting...spiking will commence...your bho will be ripped
"Low volume, wait for the slurp to turn back on. This is going to rip into the end of the year after they report. Just hold on for the ride"

What’s happening AF?
Time to eat !
"With the coming inflationary economy, owning a personal automobile will be expensive… more and more will come to depend on rideshare and public transport which UBER has a commanding presence…"
47 dollar call sellers for this lose their stock
"A report came out showing that Uber has widen the gap with Lyft on both time and money. It's pretty much 13% quicker and cheaper. That's a huge improvement and a great gap to be filled. It's a gap now widely seen by customers. All the macrotrends are now positive for Uber, the next year will be great and the stock price will appreciate. A lot."
"Breakeven point with profit , market will see uber differently!!! Ready for 1 trillion market cap in 10 years!"
Seeing people just bashing the bid on the $48 strike calls expiring this week.

Parabolic intraday move
"Bruhs, we’re going hundo…don’t fight the tape just make a lot of money and be happy"
someone just purchased 300 k in shares. Hello Fund
"So is Uber stock a buy at current levels of $46.50 per share? I think it is. Uber trades at just about 5.5x projected 2021 revenues, while its smaller ride-hailing rival Lyft LYFT trades at a slightly higher 6x multiple, and food delivery rival DoorDash trades at around 16x. Both companies are likely to grow revenues at a slower pace compared to Uber Revenues over the next year. Moreover, Uber stock also remains down by about 8% year-to-date and by almost 25% from its February 2021 highs, compared to the broader Nasdaq-100, which is up by about 21% over the same period, potentially presenting a good entry point for investors. I value Uber stock at about $50 per share, marking a 7% premium over the current market price."
Bummer. Trimmed a lot myself today.
"Long term, this company is bound to fail. Neither employees nor customers are treated fairly. And one piece of advice for customers - don't enter your tips and driver rating until AFTER the driver has completed the customer rating! As it turns out, most drivers base their passenger rating on the amount of tips they get!"
I bought 924 at $29 and 1000 at $37 adding more after this big run up.hihi

Uber among BofA's top ideas for Q4.
"Uber's 8 billion stake in Didi, valued on June 30th with Didi value at ipo price of 14.14 per share at 68 billion, is now 12% of Didi's current valuation of 38 billion, down 45% since the ipo. Will be an enormous write down on 30th Sept. Ouch."
Glad I held my shares.
UBER finally reaching profitability. That’s what investors have been waiting for since the IPO in 2019. The stock has much more room to the upside!
Uberbonerized my portfolio today
Don't miss the Uber Bus to Profitability!
A taxi company worth 80 billion that loses money yah makes a lot of sense
tentative date for earnings report is november 4th . i think we can get to 50 by then. jmho
Institutions are Positioning to Profit From Uber's (NYSE:UBER) Turnaround
Wouldn't be long this will be $100 per share.
"Pressure is building. This is going to explode after earnings when the market realizes that UBER is going to have 3 profitable and growing business segments in ride hailing, delivery and freight. So juicy"
In.....
"The slurp is on, beaches..."
Rough 6 months but this will be a $200B plus company in time
Good news: We get a new CTO.

"Judge shoots down law that kept Uber and Lyft drivers from being employees11:17 pm ET October 1, 2021 (MarketWatch) PrintBy Jeremy C. OwensAppeals court rules that law backed by record-breaking millions from Uber, Lyft, DoorDash and other gig companies is unconstitutional for barring future legislative moves on workers' compensation, collective bargainingA judge late Friday shot down a law that would have allowed app-based companies to continue treating drivers as contractors instead of employees in California, ruling unconstitutional a proposition passed by voters in 2020 after a record-breaking campaign.I am still looking for the court and judge ruling in this appeals decision released Friday evening in California. Can anyone help?"
The taxi companies went out of business because of uber lets be real.
didn't get my 38 buy so i bought today.
Here we go
Lol how will it be profitable with 9 billion in debt?
UBER is fre@king way undervalue compared to LYFT.....Stock should be trading @54 right now.
Uber will be playing a mammoth role in logistically moving America’s freight while the country digs itself out of the supply constraint nightmare triggered by Covid along with antiquated systems.
Uber - Cheers! Uber Completes Acquisition of Drizly
Profits are coming soon. Do not sell a share. Still on the ground floor and GOING UP!

Where are all the cry babies crying about uber losing money lol looks like iam on my way to being billionaire
Pull the trigger on UBER for DCA of 46.42 today!! Mistake or not??
Uber will be featured on Jim Cramer’s Mad Money tonight ￼
Well this is disheartening
get it now. $50 by end of day. Upper 50s by next Friday!!!
"Rippin bhos, brohams. Here comes $50 "
Yuuuuuuuuuuuuuuge slurp going on right now. Big whale trying not to #$%$ the market. This is about to rocket.
Ok let's go up now?
Guys sooooo much slurpage here! Do you not see the vacuum on? Whales are gobbling up your shares like they were krill. There is so much slurpage we can’t even take a pause. We might even break a hundo before YE.
tomorrow’s prediction ?
"This is the kind of stock you buy and look back 10 years later. The sky is the limit, now is the time to get in!"
"I hate the stock market. In 2020 I sold Tesla at about 160 right before takeoff. I sold the airlines ($UAL $DAL $AAL) in January, after which they gained 50% or so. Later this spring I sold $TWTR right before it popped. Then I sold $Uber at 52 right before it went to over 60. Now I sold $GM below 50 at a 15% loss...and today this. What a mess."
Market needs to get behind Uber this will be a huge economic indicator for the next few quarters to determine the vibrancy of the recovery
$60 stock
Some people are concerned with the short term price fluctuations. I’m not really. There are momentum factors working against the stock right now. Regulatory issues such as employee vs contractor. These are short term issues that obscure the long term thesis. A market leader is a high growth industry this is a long term winner. $200 in 3-5 years is very possible. Don’t make the mistake I made with Facebook and sell too early when this hits $64. Sure it’s always prudent to take some profits but this will be a core holding for me.
"Look how low that volume is. Consolidation has occurred, new hands now own, move over $50 is on the horizon. High likelihood of running to $60 if we break $50..."
It always pops when no one is paying attention. GO LONG!
goldman buy $64 issued this morning
this idea for all transportation cars should be EV only for the climate and gas and the fares will be reduced and good for everyone I think free idea for uber can start it and make top money
