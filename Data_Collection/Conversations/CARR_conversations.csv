CARR should easily trade in the $40’s. At $35 it is selling at a 25% discount. Easy pickings by the machines when the market has a strong sell off day ahead.
I’m glad I bought when it was at $14.49 
in the engineering/HVAC industry. well know well respected Brand. They have great stuff and great building management system. it will only add to the innovations moving forward on indoor air quality control in post covid era. Definetely buying this up.
Q3 earning beat !
Looks like some profit taking. Legit future growth stock with huge upside
"First the bad news: Missed the buy of a lifetime anywhere under 30 when CARR hit the market back in the Spring as a spearate entitiy.Now the good news: Started building a position in the low 30's as a core holding in my portfolio. This is one of those opportunities that comes along only 4 -5 times in a lifetime. You'll understand what this means when CARR is north of $100 buy the end of 2021, if not sooner. FWIW - I've traded for over 40 years. The markets are now 90%+ set up for trading vrs. investing. CARR is in that 10% of 'buy & hold' for the long term. Do your own DD and you'll see what I'm talking about."
Added at $49.97 the other day!
$CARR the march to $50 is officially on!
This stock will reach $27 in 5 months. I have been working in HVAC industry for 10 years and I know Carrier is going to be one of the golden horses for investors.
$CARR and $DKNG make up 75% of my portfolio
Okay. Lets do 43+ now
Don Jr. loves Carrier!
Summer A/C sales breaking records maybe. So this keeps going up. One of my customer rental houses has a Carrier for over 15yrs running still.
"70% ROI so far for me, way better than my savings account."
So here comes $23. Shocked! $30 by 8/1.
Big stuff happening for CARR. Accumulate and hold on.
"Chicago school district spent over $100 Million on Ventalation and other covid saftey proticals,,,and CARR went public almost at peak decline at start of COVID lockdowns. So many buildings to have HVAC retrofitted. Schools, Public buildings, buildings that AMAZON is going to buy (retail malls) ect. I see a double this year"
"RBC lifts CARR PT to $51 from $43; raises it to “outperform” from “sector perform.” Cites HVAC re-rating, ESG investor demand. Reported by MT Newswire. Nice."
Let’s go!!!
"1 bil + in income every quarter, most of institution holds for backup, plus they paid div.. this is ez 100+ stock, just the matter of time."

A great buying opportunity!
do not sell on this manipulation. very low volume.
"HVAC is in a megatrend. Politics, inflation, covid, are not going to overwhelm the need for indoor temperature control and ventilation in a climate change world. If CARR increases its acceleration toward green technologies, the stock will outperform and continually boost dividends along the way."
Discount time. Loading the train car HARD.
"Matt Dontino, of Dontino Enterprises, is a Buyer!"
Bought in at 26.60. Will add more in the future. Hope to see some dips along the way.
I feel like this is the best kept secret on the market
$47 PT today from KeyCorp
"This industry and stock seems to be flying under the radar in a massive way. I don;t hold stock (yet) but it appears that CARR is positioning itself to become a major player in an industry that is demanding products that CARR manufactures. The world is getting hotter = CARR cools on all levels from residential, commercial, transportationFires are going to get worse = CARR develops air purifying systems and fire preventionGovernments requiring increased efficiency = CARR has a massive R&D division to expand and improve their productsI can only see this company and stock price growing. Hope to start a position Monday!"
Who thinks the price will go up after earnings
Isn't it the most popular air conditioner company? why it has so low price

Buy the dip.

"itll hit $33 soon enough..great stock..i won't sell this gem. I think we will get a huge boost from covid requirements in hospitals, offices, government buildings when they require special filters and scrubbers and uvc lights and modifications to existing hvac systems."
global warming
Could be a good long time investment.
CARR is up 4.90% to 38.94
"Considering the entire west coast now needs air conditioners, I believe CARR is going to do quite well this coming quarter. I hate global warming, but it’s here and it’s only going to get hotter…."
This is going up high so much potential.
My posting about Cramer was removed as was someone else's. why does Yahoo censor inoffensive opinion???
"Not sure if you have checked your brokerage account - it says Odd Lot holder , either u need to sell if you dont own shares or buy at 50 to make to round of 100 shares. something is cooking up"
"What do you guys think. Little feedback would be nice. Thinking of selling my position of riocan. $8k. And put that all in carrier. I’m starting to invest more in the nyse side. So far arkk, and. Pltr. Now I want in on Carr. Lmk guys. Would be appreciated."

will be adding more in the $14s
The reason to get in before was hopefully CARR will go up... now the reason to go in is even more solid! CARR will go up! Not only will it now be a good idea to upgrade the HVAC - it will now be LEGISLATED IF YOU WANT TO BE IN BUSINESS!! CARR is going to be the #1 benefactor and for good reasons!!
"Dividend was just declared $0.08 per share paid quarterly according to a news release I just received. Ex-div June 26, 2020."
"Apologies to all, I bought into CARR recently and FYI, most everything I buy does poorly. I was poised to buy CARR back in April. Then Barron's puts out an article saying that CARR is so undervalued that it's a lifetime buying opportunity. Boom! The stock takes off. I decide not to chase, as the stock climbs quickly from 15 to 24. I wait for a dip and I'm in at 21. The debt level is high but the company generates significant cash flow. Good luck to all Longs. I see CARR as a long-term investment, not a trading vehicle."
The CEo of CARR was on CNBC showing the refrigeration Boxes used to SHIP the Covid Vaccines that require Uniquely Low freezing temperatures to store. They are the size of trailer trucks {40 feet long] storing 1 MILLION vaccines.
$CARR You’re simply best! Better than all the rest!
Let Us Elevate...
Climb started to 42+
Last chance to get this under $30
I just jumped in today while everybody is looking at ABNB & DOOR
I read an alert this am stating carrier received a bid for their security division and one other division. Wanted to read into it further but can’t find any news now?
"2 years time, this price will be like a joke, like spin off price"
What are we expecting from earnings report? Any surprise announcements coming to push share price higher?? Would love to see $50 hit by March!
added more @51. have another limit order for same price
"Let's admit it, global warming is a thing. This is where CARR comes. Target price will go a lot higher. Probably just me, but my prediction is that it will go up to $100 within 3 years or so."
Been in this bad boy from the beginning. I'm just a buyer and holder. Great picture so far
Why are we down today?
Look at that volume!

"What a nice company, look at what healthy growth the stock graph shows. Fore sure at the end of the year we see $60. Go CARR!"
Buying Opportunity!Great Entry Point!
CARR has great momentum and will be going much higher based on their growth projections. I've been in this one from the beginning and I keep buying more. I see CARR going to $70 by year end. Simply an amazing stock.
"Peter Cabot, has a new target price of $75 for Carr."
I just started a position today. I missed on the early gains but I believe this company has a lot of room to grow. Their air purifier will be an essential product for schools and business to reopen safely due to Covid19.
slow and steady up till $200
This will be 80 by years end
New High $27 up up up we go
Added at $51.50

$CARR is the HVAC king!

"Originally bought at 16. Didn’t sell at the peak. Sold at 22. I honestly did not see this stock dropping much. I’ve worked in the HVAC industry for 15 years. I’m very bullish at start of summer, plus they just announced dividend date so get in before June 26th. I have a bunch of 7/17 calls that I got caught in. Need a rally next week. Carrier is a solid company. I sell and install Bryant products which is owned by carrier. This is honestly one of the safest stocks. This company has been around for a lonnnnng time and they are everywhere in the industry. Their chillers are everywhere. I just put in the 19 seer inverter system in my house. They make a 26 seer inverter that is really nice that is due to be available mid June when I talked to my regional rep. Inverter technology is just like the little mini split ACs that use a variable capacity compressor typically 25%-100% capacity depending on demand. All the big brands have them now, but Carrier is one of the best known brands to consumers. I have had tons of success installing carrier products with little warranty."

post covid play. not many great post covid plays still exist. time to take advantage is now
Exactly what time is earnings ? Anyone know?
CARR has a PE of 19 while JCI has a PE of 49...This can go up almost 2.5 times..

Let’s go to...fitty.
"You cannot keep this stock down for longThere is still so much upside building into the back half of this year as all the divisions will be hitting on all cylinders. Not a rocket stock, just a grinding winnerKeyless Security/HVAC aftermarket and Refrig/COVID mitigation-Air filtering systems and retrofitsThis is a stock for the next 3-5 years with powerful growth to unlock now that they are a stand alone company and can redeploy assets faster while shedding costs simultaneouslyI have been buying up since April and I feel very good about the future of CARR holding many thousands of sharesHave a good Labor day boys and girls"

Shame on you sellers.James Dontino says buy Carr.
"Trane revenue at 13B, 13k employees . Carrier revenue at 19B, and 50k employees. Trane stock at 84 and carrier at 16. Carrier stock could get to 45? Possible?"

Patience is a virtue

Wow! Haven’t seen this kind of drop for Carr for a long to ne!Time to load up!

Carr has great future. All office buildings will hay new air quality requirements. There's going to be many readjustments to current air quality conditions. $CARR has systems which will be able to control air quality and temperature automatically and with IoT. Old buildings will have to comply. Carr will generate huge revenue.It is a great time to buy solid company right now..They do business all over the world.
Best balance sheet out there in the sector. $2B in FCF..... The growth is going to be a promise.
time to buy more shares
Why is this still cheaper than $TT. Could easily argue there is more upside.
Above $30 in pre-market. Good sign
Should I buy at this price?

"What Our Model SaysPer the Zacks model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that’s not the case here.Carrier Global has an Earnings ESP of +6.70%, but a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).what am i not seeing here ???"

"CEO on CNBC a few minutes ago was very impressive. “We are putting the V back into HVAC. Healthy well ventilated buildings will be important in getting back to work in offices and factories etc. additionally when your home AC or Furnace breaks down, you replace it. Carrier is the leader and the brand. He appears fiscally responsible and solid. Glad I invested yesterday."
headed 42+
any chance this will go 60?
Do we think Carrier will match Trane Technologies value at any point?
that a girl. Love this play.
Large hedge funds could start buying CARR!Lohr Charitable Foundation adding to their position(as per Matthew Lohr).
"Earning on Nov 4 2021, should be very good result."
Carrier has ended green 9 days in a row. If it ends green today it will be the 10th day.
I have worked for Carrier for the past 24 years. Seeing a big positive change since splitting from UTC. More has happened in the last 6 months than ever before. Reorganisation makes sense and investment is flowing. Personally up 100% since April and I am very confident more upside to go.
