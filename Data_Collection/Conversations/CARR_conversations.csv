Carrier has ended green 9 days in a row. If it ends green today it will be the 10th day.
"I can tell this company is strong, with all the red days for 2 weeks it's still holding within the price."
CARR. the gift that keeps on giving!
"itll hit $33 soon enough..great stock..i won't sell this gem. I think we will get a huge boost from covid requirements in hospitals, offices, government buildings when they require special filters and scrubbers and uvc lights and modifications to existing hvac systems."
"Scooped a few more shares Friday. Thought I was gonna break Robinhood since I was buying something other than GME, AMC, etc.. *Unrelated, I will be leaving Robinhood for an actual brokerage account in light of the recent events and how Robinhood handled itself"
Let’s go!!!
Could be a good long time investment.
Increase in divvy would be nice.
Added twice today under $55.35
p.s. I added shares at 55.85 support level....
Epic earnings are forecasted.
Best balance sheet out there in the sector. $2B in FCF..... The growth is going to be a promise.
Buying Opportunity!Great Entry Point!
CARR is up 4.90% to 36.82
ohh yeah baby!
"While traders are trying to beat the shorts at a number of stocks, investors are quietly and patiently getting wealthy buying and holding quality stocks like Carrier. Buy the dips and hold, it will be rewarded."
Over $40 coming. Then $45. Growth. Patience. = Winning.
Got an ODD OFFER LOT on my account since I have less then 100 shares. ANyone else? I don't want to buy more shares at this moment. Any insight?
I’m glad I bought when it was at $14.49 
$48-$49 next level to add. China is going to put some pressure on companies that deal a l lot of business in China. Just temporary problem.
CARR reached a 52 Week high at 27.34
CARR reached a 52 Week high at 18.94
Earnings beat
A great earnings report!
Dividend increased to .12 per share
added at $25.60 in the pre-market
Okay. Lets do 43+ now
Buying more this AM.
this thing is up almost 500% since spinoff.....what a monster
"Fortune released its annual Fortune 500 rankings today, which include Carrier for the first time since UTC acquired the business in 1979. Carrier is ranked #171, making it the highest ranked “newcomer” and third in the Industrial Machinery category."
Shame on you sellers.James Dontino says buy Carr.
"when you sell this on any price, you will be regret.."
So here comes $23. Shocked! $30 by 8/1.
"What Our Model SaysPer the Zacks model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that’s not the case here.Carrier Global has an Earnings ESP of +6.70%, but a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).what am i not seeing here ???"
Above $30 in pre-market. Good sign
"A company that has such a steady and constant climb, that is proportional….seems odd."
headed 42+
CARR reached an all time high at 32.89
Undervalued
"Dividend was just declared $0.08 per share paid quarterly according to a news release I just received. Ex-div June 26, 2020."
Let Us Elevate...
"This company is very very popular, I will keep adding shares still I drop."
"alot of CARES $$ is being spent on Air Purifiers which qualifies for Covid related expenses. Plenty of Public Entities such as Libraries, Schools, Hospitals and gov't buildings are doing this. cause what they don't spend goes back to the Feds. cha ching across the nation!!"
"Larry Cabot, new target price of $65per share by Christmas."
Who thinks the price will go up after earnings
in the engineering/HVAC industry. well know well respected Brand. They have great stuff and great building management system. it will only add to the innovations moving forward on indoor air quality control in post covid era. Definetely buying this up.
We going to 60 soon!!!
I have worked for Carrier for the past 24 years. Seeing a big positive change since splitting from UTC. More has happened in the last 6 months than ever before. Reorganisation makes sense and investment is flowing. Personally up 100% since April and I am very confident more upside to go.
"Billy Dunkin, is a buyer of CARR!"
"Had about 90% gains on this gem. Are you still buying at these prices, my people?"
Carr has great future. All office buildings will hay new air quality requirements. There's going to be many readjustments to current air quality conditions. $CARR has systems which will be able to control air quality and temperature automatically and with IoT. Old buildings will have to comply. Carr will generate huge revenue.It is a great time to buy solid company right now..They do business all over the world.
It's crazy to me how quiet this board is. This stock is the best kept secret on the market.
This stock will reach $27 in 5 months. I have been working in HVAC industry for 10 years and I know Carrier is going to be one of the golden horses for investors.
The CEo of CARR was on CNBC showing the refrigeration Boxes used to SHIP the Covid Vaccines that require Uniquely Low freezing temperatures to store. They are the size of trailer trucks {40 feet long] storing 1 MILLION vaccines.
"RSCF --- cold chain logistics and storage solutions! currently working with gov. ows and air carriers!Debt free, robust IP, low O/S, low float. $TMO"
What are we expecting from earnings report? Any surprise announcements coming to push share price higher?? Would love to see $50 hit by March!
"After recent nervous n unnecessary sell-off, CARR is regaining its mojo. Very nice price action today in a strong market, am very comfortable in waiting for $50 a share, IMHO."
CARR has great momentum and will be going much higher based on their growth projections. I've been in this one from the beginning and I keep buying more. I see CARR going to $70 by year end. Simply an amazing stock.
"Considering the entire west coast now needs air conditioners, I believe CARR is going to do quite well this coming quarter. I hate global warming, but it’s here and it’s only going to get hotter…."
do not sell on this manipulation. very low volume.
35 by Aug 21
Every time I look at the chart I think of the Price is Right game with the dude climbing the mountain.
"wow, both earnings and revenue beat!!!!!"
75 new price target
Scot Bradley target for CARR $65 per share.
"Carrier makes the most reliable units on the market, as global warming continues, manufacturing returning, the population compounding a/c is a necessity, this is common sense that this is like a consumer staple that you have to have."
"What a nice company, look at what healthy growth the stock graph shows. Fore sure at the end of the year we see $60. Go CARR!"
wish I bought more at 17....
"Let this come down and settle from the Cramer pump. Then buy and hold onto it. Ac is the greatest invention in history, behind actual discovery of electricity."
"Trane revenue at 13B, 13k employees . Carrier revenue at 19B, and 50k employees. Trane stock at 84 and carrier at 16. Carrier stock could get to 45? Possible?"
Been in this bad boy from the beginning. I'm just a buyer and holder. Great picture so far
CARR should easily trade in the $40’s. At $35 it is selling at a 25% discount. Easy pickings by the machines when the market has a strong sell off day ahead.
$47 PT today from KeyCorp
I will add more at $56.50
Still on growth trajectory. Not just an ac company. Makes the units that cool the vax too. Great quality ceo.
"2 years time, this price will be like a joke, like spin off price"
Bought in at 26.60. Will add more in the future. Hope to see some dips along the way.
Watch this pop back big!
Why is this still cheaper than $TT. Could easily argue there is more upside.
Builder Don Jr. utilizes CARR on all his hotels.This news per Business Chronicle.
"CEO on CNBC a few minutes ago was very impressive. “We are putting the V back into HVAC. Healthy well ventilated buildings will be important in getting back to work in offices and factories etc. additionally when your home AC or Furnace breaks down, you replace it. Carrier is the leader and the brand. He appears fiscally responsible and solid. Glad I invested yesterday."
"B of A Securities Initiates Coverage On Carrier Global with Buy Rating, Announces Price Target of $57"
Large hedge funds could start buying CARR!Lohr Charitable Foundation adding to their position(as per Matthew Lohr).
spoke too soon
I just started a position today. I missed on the early gains but I believe this company has a lot of room to grow. Their air purifier will be an essential product for schools and business to reopen safely due to Covid19.
My posting about Cramer was removed as was someone else's. why does Yahoo censor inoffensive opinion???

"First the bad news: Missed the buy of a lifetime anywhere under 30 when CARR hit the market back in the Spring as a spearate entitiy.Now the good news: Started building a position in the low 30's as a core holding in my portfolio. This is one of those opportunities that comes along only 4 -5 times in a lifetime. You'll understand what this means when CARR is north of $100 buy the end of 2021, if not sooner. FWIW - I've traded for over 40 years. The markets are now 90%+ set up for trading vrs. investing. CARR is in that 10% of 'buy & hold' for the long term. Do your own DD and you'll see what I'm talking about."
Look at that volume!
How this is down today in baffling...
$CARR the march to $50 is officially on!
"Starting to buy some shares now. Spin offs get overlooked, be patient!"
CARR is up 4.90% to 38.94
This stock is worth $200.
This will be 80 by years end
"Dust is still settling this week. The long term debt makes me nervous, but this stock has tremendous upside at this current share price. Plus they’re known well for their donations towards green sustainability and are looking for new ways to keep innovating. Buying in around $11, but I love the upside regardless. Good luck everyone!"
Exactly what time is earnings ? Anyone know?
Let’s go to...fitty.
2.6 billion in 2019 and trading at 29? Is this the best kept secret on the market?
global warming
"Dontino Enterprises, continues to Buy Carr!"
Where are all the its going to $100 cheerleaders lol. I love and own it but come on. At this point I will take $50. And BTW just added more at $36.64
"Two recent upgrades with targets in $50s and general theme of massive construction + replacement of air systems in schools, etc. It's definitely been percolating."
"This industry and stock seems to be flying under the radar in a massive way. I don;t hold stock (yet) but it appears that CARR is positioning itself to become a major player in an industry that is demanding products that CARR manufactures. The world is getting hotter = CARR cools on all levels from residential, commercial, transportationFires are going to get worse = CARR develops air purifying systems and fire preventionGovernments requiring increased efficiency = CARR has a massive R&D division to expand and improve their productsI can only see this company and stock price growing. Hope to start a position Monday!"
"Apologies to all, I bought into CARR recently and FYI, most everything I buy does poorly. I was poised to buy CARR back in April. Then Barron's puts out an article saying that CARR is so undervalued that it's a lifetime buying opportunity. Boom! The stock takes off. I decide not to chase, as the stock climbs quickly from 15 to 24. I wait for a dip and I'm in at 21. The debt level is high but the company generates significant cash flow. Good luck to all Longs. I see CARR as a long-term investment, not a trading vehicle."
Climb started to 42+
"Originally bought at 16. Didn’t sell at the peak. Sold at 22. I honestly did not see this stock dropping much. I’ve worked in the HVAC industry for 15 years. I’m very bullish at start of summer, plus they just announced dividend date so get in before June 26th. I have a bunch of 7/17 calls that I got caught in. Need a rally next week. Carrier is a solid company. I sell and install Bryant products which is owned by carrier. This is honestly one of the safest stocks. This company has been around for a lonnnnng time and they are everywhere in the industry. Their chillers are everywhere. I just put in the 19 seer inverter system in my house. They make a 26 seer inverter that is really nice that is due to be available mid June when I talked to my regional rep. Inverter technology is just like the little mini split ACs that use a variable capacity compressor typically 25%-100% capacity depending on demand. All the big brands have them now, but Carrier is one of the best known brands to consumers. I have had tons of success installing carrier products with little warranty."
So many people suffering from the heat and humidity. Doesn't that push Carrier's products out the door in droves and provide moisture for watering the plants. It seems from the experts that change is making this more intense in the future. How can investing in carrier not be a no brain move for the long term. Am I wrong?
"Overall solid plan, cutting costs, keeping projections. I am glad with the results, lets see now new 52 weeks highs"
"clean healthy buildings and hundreds of new orders, only matter of DAYS before active investors start buying and call for proxy votes,buying every share i can afford $28 real soon"
Looks like some profit taking. Legit future growth stock with huge upside
Summer A/C sales breaking records maybe. So this keeps going up. One of my customer rental houses has a Carrier for over 15yrs running still.
CARR has a PE of 19 while JCI has a PE of 49...This can go up almost 2.5 times..
"James Dontino, has a strong Buy rating on CARR!"
$CARR is the HVAC king!
"You cannot keep this stock down for longThere is still so much upside building into the back half of this year as all the divisions will be hitting on all cylinders. Not a rocket stock, just a grinding winnerKeyless Security/HVAC aftermarket and Refrig/COVID mitigation-Air filtering systems and retrofitsThis is a stock for the next 3-5 years with powerful growth to unlock now that they are a stand alone company and can redeploy assets faster while shedding costs simultaneouslyI have been buying up since April and I feel very good about the future of CARR holding many thousands of sharesHave a good Labor day boys and girls"
Added at $51.50
Should I buy at this price?
What was the share price for CARR when it was spun off from UTX on April 3rd?
What are the 12 month predictions for this stock?
why dropping so hard today?
"Great! After Cramer makes a big deal about CARR, then UBS cuts it to neutral. Will I ever learn?"
"Let's admit it, global warming is a thing. This is where CARR comes. Target price will go a lot higher. Probably just me, but my prediction is that it will go up to $100 within 3 years or so."
"Bitter sweet investing in $CARR. I feel with the world heating up , we will be see more and more air conditioned facilities"
Carrier manufactures refrigeration units used in the transport of Covid vaccines
Why are we down today?
Added at 54.95
The reason to get in before was hopefully CARR will go up... now the reason to go in is even more solid! CARR will go up! Not only will it now be a good idea to upgrade the HVAC - it will now be LEGISLATED IF YOU WANT TO BE IN BUSINESS!! CARR is going to be the #1 benefactor and for good reasons!!
A great buying opportunity!
Added at $49.97 the other day!
Bought the dip.
"David Marcetti, senior manager of Woodcrest Group,has a strong Buy rating on Carrier."
Patience is a virtue
Big stuff happening for CARR. Accumulate and hold on.

Don Jr. loves Carrier!
"Matt Dontino, of Dontino Enterprises, is a Buyer!"
slow and steady up till $200
"Carrier is a company that is on the same level as, if not better than, Trane. Carrier's market cap will follow Trane. I didn't see any issue about this. Add more Carrier shares at any dips."
New regulations for energy in 2023….sell before. Infrastructure of manufacturing sites can’t support and sustain quality.
CARR is up 4.96% to 35.04
CARR reached a 52 Week high at 26.33
Can't be . Cramer was negative on this stock
Do we think Carrier will match Trane Technologies value at any point?
"Don't ya' love it when a stock drops after posting good results? Why do I bother? Even when I win, I lose."
Isn't it the most popular air conditioner company? why it has so low price
Will be well over $100 in 12-24 months. You got patience for that? I do.
"HVAC is in a megatrend. Politics, inflation, covid, are not going to overwhelm the need for indoor temperature control and ventilation in a climate change world. If CARR increases its acceleration toward green technologies, the stock will outperform and continually boost dividends along the way."
This stock is going to surge to $50 with the COVID-19 vaccine refrigeration distribution news. Be ready guys!
"Trane is near a 52 week low, Carrier near a 52 week high. Interesting."
I read an alert this am stating carrier received a bid for their security division and one other division. Wanted to read into it further but can’t find any news now?
I think easy 50 start of next year
"Inherited shares from the UTX spin-off. Does anyone know the cost basis for UTX, CARR, and OTIS?"

Carrier is the hogzilla of the HVAC world. $CARR
"Unfortunately for those in the path of IDA, it just contributed to the HVAC division of CARR"
May have dropped but still at a higher low from last week. Just a slight pull back. Will continue to make new highs. Good stock to hold
New High $27 up up up we go
This is going up high so much potential.
CARR paid off $1B in debt and announced share buybacks. What else was good in this report?
I feel like this is the best kept secret on the market
People should be piling cash here!
January calls for covid vaccine $PFE december 10. Hope they get approved
42 is on the horizon
I hope they get their act together and push more equipment out of the factories. This has been the worst summer ever for getting equipment. It’s just not carrier either. Every major manufacturer is behind.
As goes $CARR so goes $MOD. Looking strong in HVAC and with Biden’s approach to American made $MOD is a strong winner now and in the foreseeable future.
Stock is a Buying Opportunity!
I just jumped in today while everybody is looking at ABNB & DOOR

"Chicago school district spent over $100 Million on Ventalation and other covid saftey proticals,,,and CARR went public almost at peak decline at start of COVID lockdowns.

I'm expecting great news tomorrow but regardless how the stock reacts this is a long hold and win.
