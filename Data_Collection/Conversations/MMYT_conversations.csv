"Very dark clouds on the horizon. MMYT just filed an ominous Form 12b-25 with the SEC. The annual report will be late.""The Company anticipates that its Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting will contain disclosure of a material weakness in internal control relating to controls over the development and review of forecast financial information including related assumptions used in goodwill impairment testing that did not operate as designed to address the related risks of material misstatement. It is also anticipated that the report of the Company’s independent auditor on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2020 will be adverse. Also, the anticipated conclusion of management’s evaluation of its disclosure controls and procedures is that these disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at March 31, 2020 as a result of this material weakness in internal control over financial reporting.""""The Company’s business and results of operations have been adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and the nationwide lockdown implemented by the Government of India in late March 2020. The Company expects that its Annual Report will reflect an impairment charge of goodwill of approximately $272.2 million related to its Goibibo business as a result of the significant negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the travel industry, its stock price and market capitalization."""

HeyNo one have anything to say about this stock ?
"Many people are seeking for stability in this unstable crypto space and even the stock market, A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now. I'd say it's wrong to just sit back hold and wait maybe incur some losses along the line, that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making profits should be the way of life that being said, the market is still majorly about BTC at the moment and I'll advise current investors and newbies to take advantage of the Mr. Arthur's copy Trading platform, a platform that handles people who lack understanding on how to maneuver the crypto space and stock market, to help them recover loss from the crash and also accumulate more positive returns, with this platform i went from having 1.4btc to 7btc in just 9 weeks.

"MMYT released its 295 page annual report today, showing a $447.5 million loss for fiscal year 2020 (ended March 31, 2020) or a $4.26 loss per share. These dismal numbers only include the very beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic's effect on the worldwide travel industry. The April through June quarter will likely be a bloodbath. Here's where to find the 2020 annual report: https://investors.makemytrip.com/investors/financials/default.aspx"

Anyone buying calls on this?
Guys if you are looking to put your money in this stock then take a look at YTRA. It has atleast 50-60% upside if not more compared to MMYT. MMYT is expxecting 680M revenue in 2019 with 150M losses and has a cap of 2.9 Billion. YTRA has 150M revenue with only 20M losses and growing at 40%. Would be a take over candidate by MMYT only for 2 to 1 stock swap valuing YTRA for atleast $15.
"Technically, a potential good entry point here. Strong bullish indication at stoxline. Long over 31.83 for a run up to 37.18."

$3.20 loss for the quarter. $30.8 million setaside for litigation. 31% reduction in current assets year-to-year. 36% drop in shareholder equity year-to-year. And this is just the beginning. It reflects the year and quarter ending March 31 -- when the Covid-19 economic blowback had only begun. Imagine the numbers that will arrive in the quarter ending June 30? Wow.

"interesting opinion.what was the negative in the 3q 21results yday, that has led to a 9% fall on high volume today?Did you hear anything unusually negative in the results - I thought they sounded positive...!or is the drop today related to some other news than the results?thanks in advance"
"$mmyt is struggling mightily in June, 2020. The company has hundreds (thousands) of customer complaints on social media for nonpayment of cancelled flights, hotels and other transportation. With 20% of their Asia business down or gone there must be a serious cash-flow problem developing so that would explain the reluctance to refund their customers cancelled flights. The company laid off 350 in May, 2020 but there are credible reports that this number is much higher over 1000 per some sources. Will ctrip double down on this company? Either way at over $17 a share this stock is grossly overvalued having lost over $500mm in the past 4 years. I see this stock under $10 by August and possibly a zero by November, 2020 when cash runs out."
