"Overvalued at $30, This acquisition will increase the operating expense for MMYT significantly. I would take my profit here and run. New money be very careful in investing here which is already 50% UP. Hotel booking is already over saturated. So what will happen in future? Higher operating expense and lower profit margins may push for dilution for cash. Reading between the lines makes it more clear, than the hype:Naspers and Tencent, through their jointly owned holding company (91% owned by Naspers and 9% owned by Tencent), are selling ibibo Group to MakeMyTrip in exchange for an issuance of new shares by MakeMyTrip. Upon closing of the transaction, MakeMyTrip will own 100% of ibibo Group. Naspers and Tencent will become the single largest shareholder in MakeMyTrip, owning a 40% stake, and will contribute proportionate working capital upon closing.Additionally, prior to closing , the US$180 million, 5-year convertible notes issued by MakeMyTrip Limited to Ctrip.com International, Ltd. (“Ctrip”) (NASDAQ: CTRP) in January 2016 will also be converted into common equity, resulting in Ctrip having an approximately 10% stake in the combined entity.The transaction is expected to close by the end of December 2016 and is subject to approval by MakeMyTrip shareholders and regulatory approvals."

$3.20 loss for the quarter. $30.8 million setaside for litigation. 31% reduction in current assets year-to-year. 36% drop in shareholder equity year-to-year. And this is just the beginning. It reflects the year and quarter ending March 31 -- when the Covid-19 economic blowback had only begun. Imagine the numbers that will arrive in the quarter ending June 30? Wow.

Guys if you are looking to put your money in this stock then take a look at YTRA. It has atleast 50-60% upside if not more compared to MMYT. MMYT is expxecting 680M revenue in 2019 with 150M losses and has a cap of 2.9 Billion. YTRA has 150M revenue with only 20M losses and growing at 40%. Would be a take over candidate by MMYT only for 2 to 1 stock swap valuing YTRA for atleast $15.

"Very dark clouds on the horizon. MMYT just filed an ominous Form 12b-25 with the SEC. The annual report will be late.""The Company anticipates that its Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting will contain disclosure of a material weakness in internal control relating to controls over the development and review of forecast financial information including related assumptions used in goodwill impairment testing that did not operate as designed to address the related risks of material misstatement. It is also anticipated that the report of the Company’s independent auditor on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2020 will be adverse. Also, the anticipated conclusion of management’s evaluation of its disclosure controls and procedures is that these disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at March 31, 2020 as a result of this material weakness in internal control over financial reporting.""""The Company’s business and results of operations have been adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and the nationwide lockdown implemented by the Government of India in late March 2020. The Company expects that its Annual Report will reflect an impairment charge of goodwill of approximately $272.2 million related to its Goibibo business as a result of the significant negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the travel industry, its stock price and market capitalization."""

"$mmyt is struggling mightily in June, 2020. The company has hundreds (thousands) of customer complaints on social media for nonpayment of cancelled flights, hotels and other transportation. With 20% of their Asia business down or gone there must be a serious cash-flow problem developing so that would explain the reluctance to refund their customers cancelled flights. The company laid off 350 in May, 2020 but there are credible reports that this number is much higher over 1000 per some sources. Will ctrip double down on this company? Either way at over $17 a share this stock is grossly overvalued having lost over $500mm in the past 4 years. I see this stock under $10 by August and possibly a zero by November, 2020 when cash runs out."

"Most populous country in world with millions now with mobile phones. Much easier to penetrate than needing a pc for internet connections. They will dominate and explode in growth once country continues to develop...similar to what happened in China. also, CTRP, china's dominant travel site, owns a piece of MMYT! In a few years, this thing will be well above $50."
$YTRA #2 in the market and undiscovered. To compare revs and market cap to $MMYT would be $20-$30

"Shareholders barely make much money if you invested in this company since September, 2010. Based on my humble opinion, this company is at excellent position in business of India Online Travel Agent. To me, the problem is that the management, executives, even investor relationship are all incompetent. For example why not announce the quarterly financial report on 7 am, 8 am, or even 9 am of Easter time? If we have a NEW competent management team, then MMYT might become CTRP in China, PCLN and EXPE in USA very soon. Should shareholders take any action to shake out the incompetent management?"
