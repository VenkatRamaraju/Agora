inflation going crazy not buying a EV tomorrow or next 10 years gonna save up for a ribeye steak.
"The earning report is out. BLNK did much better than expected. Be prepared for a short squeeze. See the number yourself.Short Interest 12,264,706 sharesShort Interest Ratio 6.26 Days to CoverShort Interest % Float 34.62%I am adding more BLNK shares to my portfolio. GO LONGS, GO."
It is amazing how this company got trashed with all the great hopes and dreams. Is it short sellers? or the result of not making any money and keep increasing compensations? Any way they out to be caustious not to get sued as they seem to be dancing on the ice.
"How can any long be okay with this statement:""Net loss was $13.5 million or a loss of $0.32 per basic and diluted share compared to net loss of $3 million or a loss of $0.11 per basic and diluted share in the second quarter of 2020. Second quarter 2021 net loss is primarily attributable to an increase in compensation expense"""
Strike $33 Call Strike $0.13 Exp Sept 17 21 :)
shorts getting crushed...add and hold..
"Looking ahead to earnings, here are my estimates. Revenue $3.2M mostly fallacious Cyprus sub and Amazon re-sales. Losses $10M mostly due to management compensation and headquarters admin expenses. But hey almost everyone will have an electric car in 5 years and they will need to re-charge it somewhere, right ?"
I own blink shares (1400) with an avg cost of 3.30. what do you think I should do?
BLNK Charging station all faulty never worked. That is the reason more loss reported . Out look Doomed
I'm looking for $ 23
"Be ready for a Short Squeeze. As of right now, BLNK Short Squeeze Score is 53.89, according to Fintel. BLNK is one of the most shorted stocks. BLNK Short Shares Availability is less and less. At the same time, BLNK Short Borrow Fee Rate (%) is 13.26, and the interest rate is going higher and higher. No one wants to borrow shares with a very high interest rate.BLNK is doing well in all sectors. EV is the future, and without EV charging stations, we cannot think about EV. I believe the Infrastructure bill will pass soon, and there will be other good news to come. So, BLNK is the future oil for me. I am holding all my shares and adding more when I can."
They didn't grow revenues from last quarter. Interesting to see if they have any growth this quarter. BLNK is supposed to be a high growth company but it looks like they put the car in reverse. We'll find out in 2 days. If they disappoint again I could see the stock drop at least 12 % that day.
"These guys are claiming charging spots near residential areas, which few will use as at home is free. They just flip a buck on the dumb store owners, meanwhile make 500k on electricity middleman business. This is a billion dollar hotdog cart for sale. Can I interest you in a taxi medallion for NYC Bhim or Hashbulllove?"
"Infrastructure chargers winner is Proterra, I spread some money on some car chargers but many of them not profitable and will loose market"
"A year ago, that stock was $1.5/share. What changed between then and now to bring the valuation to $1.5B? As much as I’m all for green technology and eager to get into the EV wagon, one needs to explain the rationale in investing at that valuation"
this stock is starting to feel squezzy .. predict pain for the shorts.. im all in..
Man I really hope the “EV is duh footure” level of analysis folks push this back over $35 so I can short back to $30 again.
"Bad earnings, gonna be bad tomorrow"
why high salaries to attract? Doesn't anyone believe in Blink enough to just join a winning company on normal executive salary or do they feel it's only temporary employment with no future?
nice
The 7 Best Stocks Under $1 To Buy Right Now! - For details https://youtu.be/4aG71WK3S1s
We can only hope that the compensation pays off with the hiring on new mgmt. team. Hopefully their expertise and knowledge will expand accordingly. Would like to see more in the US and not just focus in Europe where growth is expanding faster. Good luck to us longs.
Interesting! Anyone know why stocks at 1:18 took a dive? I was looking at $ICLN $PLUG $INO $BLNK $NOK. I'm sure more stocks have done this.
what is happening .....it is going down......oh more stations to lose money on LOL
down over 30 % for the year ...if this breaks $ 29 then it is going to $22....just broke $29....goodbye
How can you make 4 million in revenue and have 13 millon in losses?Company is blaming compensation and administration expenses?Still blaming covid 19 for shortfall.
"Down 6 % so far, longs are wavering due to the enormous loss due to compensation and admin costs in Q2. Hey why not lower salaries. Does Farkas really need $25M . Someone in his position should be under $500K a year?"
They had some interesting insights about BLNK on (http://Rightpicker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
Stock will drop below 32 today. We will probably see another 7% decline considering the market is tanking and blnk is realistically worth $5.00 a share.
"I am attending all Quarterly earings calls of the companies where I own stocks in my portfolio. I hold a minor investment of BLNK. Yesterday's earnings call was one of the most embarrasing and unpprofessional calls I have ever attended. Connections lost, the CEO participating on the call while travelling on an airplane, passing on questions to one of his colleagues who his caught on the left foot. Terrible call. I wonder how this company wants to prosper in the future. BLNK's revenues are ridicolous and one wonders how this company can have a market cap of $ 1,5 Billion. I am happy to take a loss here and invest my money into other more credible companies. No wonder the short interest here is over 30 %, this will definitely increase after yesterday's call."
is this stock a long term hold and buy as needed or a daily watcher since it doesnt pay a dividend
I’m bearish Blink because I’m bullish EV. Miss allocating capital to these carney shows like Nikola and Blink can do real damage
They had some interesting insights about BLNK on (http://Multistockalerts.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"Have owned BLNK for a year.. also just bought CHPT, Oppenheimer raised CHPT to $40 and outperform, double what it trades at after their ER.. another good opportunity in EV world."
"Heavily shorted at 35%, need WallStreetBets to  "
Blnk could own all the EV chargers in the world and they're still not going to grow into their current market cap of $1.5B.
BLNK is no CHPT
Ride from 64.5 to 29.82 in 7 months. Who are the people who bought at those astronmical prices? It is a fairy tale!
BLNK ...KABOOM! 70.00+ in the blink of an eye  loading
This stock will be back in the high 30’s again soon.
Blinkie winkie is only down 25% for the year......let's see if we can get to 30 %......Go BLNK
shortssuk........you should post 2 images of your rocket today and maybe it would go up in price.......although I doubt it
"FYI- Electric cars don't use spark plugs, that's pretty cool."
I’m surprised this has held up as well as it has given the broader market sell off.It’ll be bumpy but I see this sub-$20 by year end. They miss earnings each quarter and are running out of potential catalysts upward.
"Here what it says on 10 Q regarding compensation. Google 10q BLNk. “Compensation expense increased by $9,498,266, or 215%, to $13,918,471 (consisting of approximately $9.9 million of cash compensation and benefits and approximately $4.0 million of non-cash compensation) for the six months ended June 30, 2021. Compensation expense was $4,420,205 (consisting of approximately $4.1 million of cash compensation and approximately $0.3 million of non-cash compensation) for the six months ended June 30, 2020. The increase in compensation expense for the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 was primarily related to increases in personnel and compensation in executive, marketing, sales and operations departments as a result of the anticipated growth of the Company. In addition, compensation expense during the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared the same period in 2020 increased due to additional personnel in conjunction with the acquisitions of BlueLA and U-Go made during 2020 which were subsequent to June 30, 2020 and the acquisition of Blue Corner which occurred in May 2021. Also contributing to the increase in compensation expense for the six months ended June 30, 2021 is the new employment agreement with our CEO which included increases in cash and equity compensation as well as one-time awards and payments in satisfaction of his 2020 bonuses of $1,280,000, restricted stock grant of 19,504 shares of common stock, granted of 23,862 in stock options, and a salary catch-up since the expiration of his prior agreement in June 2020 of $294,575. Included in non-cash share-based compensation for the six months ended June 30, 2021 was $1,911,538 related to the special four-year performance stock option for the CEO of the Company.”"
 Trying to decide: BUY MORE or SELL & Buy EVGO based on their Huge GM alliance & they are much larger
BLNK getting their share of New York's charging stations! This company is looking to double and triple earnings in the next 12 months. $50 price target is being conservative!
their revenue did not grow that much......they bought another company
Blnk is going to sink. Huge 13 million loss in the quarter. -.32c a share.Hard to justify a 1.6 billion market cap with that kind of income statement.
the company ONLY sold 944 chargers in the qtr.....of which 775 were sold on Amazon to individuals for their garage and own use.........they only added 169 to their network......so for the year so far they have added 329 chargers to their network and lost $ 31m+ doing it .......still waiting on the 10Q to see how many sales went to their Greece joint venture....good luck to the longs.....you are going to need it
"35% Short interest, If short squeeze happens then  to 100!!"
here we go.. time for shorts to feel the pain.
Not sure how I ever traded without (http://trademarketview.tech)! Their daily emails give me all the info I need to make the best decisions when it comes to trades!
thumbs up if you got a margin call today.
Good thing they have world class personnel. Compensation and office expenses are $10M per quarter ? A large part probably goes to Farkas. He definitely takes down $25M a year.
Blink analyst predicts
Blinkie not so good today for the longs.
As requested one of the articles referencing Tesla open network next year. https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/cars/tesla-to-open-superchargers-up-to-other-evs-later-this-year-3316939%3famp

Conference call now on announcing new mgmt team which mean more compensation.
luv it
"Unless they produce their own energy, I can't see them making a worthwhile premium over the price of electricity to ever be profitable. Payback must take 20 years for every charger installed and that is if the charger lasts that long in the elements."
can anyone say short squeeze?
"You shorts are broken records, saying the same thing on every new contract. This contract is too small, yadda yadda yadda. Funny that you look at each one individually but dont put the pieces of the puzzle together to see the big picture. Short sighted tunnel vision I guess."
Roth only fake analysts using Monday night football strategy analysts. Needham uses real analyst.
No earning no revenue loss more reported
Second quarter 2021 net loss is primarily attributable to an increase in compensation expense and general and administrative expenses.
BLNK hiring lots of people a lot software and R/D people. It is very impressive.
with hiden in charge even AMC and Gamestop don't stand a chance. longs will be burnt.
their numbers look big but remember they acquired a Belgium company the beginning of May so they are not showing you an apples to apples comparison. wait for the 10Q
"just so you can't erase itEd10 minutes agoShorts will be squeezed, like it or not.We will be at 40 by next Tuesday.Reply1"
Looking at the investors there is more filings for buying than selling. It looks like the price is aiming for 40-41
on Reddits radar. perfect stock to short squeeze. think about it.
"Of all the stock advice services I have used, I find (http://Fairstox.com) to be one of the absolute best! Their advice is well researched, helpful, and up to date. I don’t know how I ever went about day trading without reading their newsletter first!"
$chpt and $evgo both taking it on the chin today... $blnk is surprisingly acting better despite such high valuation!
"CEO of BLNK takes a $500,000 raise and stock options. Thanks all you bagholders for the 9 million in compensation on 4 million in revenues."
"As electric vehicle charging companies replace legacy IGBT power switching tech with the next generation switching devices, they will benefit from smaller, faster, more energy efficient chargers. Ideal Power is the leading company with a revolutionary bi-directional power switch offering a 5X improvement in conduction losses vs. old IGBT tech. TAM is expected to be $11B by 2025. Go long IPWR...you're welcome.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ideal-power-signs-b-tran-123000125.html"
This stock received no juice from the infrastructure bill. All priced in. Any funds from the deal (if any) are years away from hitting blink's revenue stream.
"In poker, it's well-known that a ""tell"" is a little quirk or seemingly insignificant gesture that gives away the whole picture of the player's strategy. Blink too had a ""tell""...that press release in Feb. where they bragged about installing 2 charging stations in a condo in New Hampshire. Wow, think of the cash flow. That's a ""tell,"" folks, and it speaks volumes about the hype and promotion of this company."
trading at 81x sales...thats EIGHT ONE TIMES SALES....not earnings....not a PE....SALES!!!!!Even if this thing grew at 10x in the next year....its still 8x sales....and no doubt holders would think its should go up 100x .
"When will chargers be needed by more than a handful of people? 2025?Obviously it isn’t now, as shown by the poor performance of the various charging stocks."
Missed earnings targets again. Lost .32c/share vs. -18c loss expected.Lost 13 million vs 3 million last year. Losses are getting bigger with no end in sight.
only 5 but the idea is less chargers the better. means less money lost.

does Needham give reasons for the BUY ratings?
"This stock always trends up. Sure it may fall a bit sometimes, but then it bounces back higher. It Performs and better than other charging companies."
Good job Reddit.
"At this pace, this stock will be in the 20's by the end of next week. Buyer beware."
"Allego in the Netherlands is going public through a SPAC, 26k ports and valued at 3.1 billion."
Can someone explain to me how this company's business model will ever make a profit. Everyone loves EV but only 2% of car buyers buy EV and the chance of them going to a blnk charger and paying extra over the price of electricity to charge does not sound feasible. How many charges would it actually take to break even and make a profit on a charging station? How many years per charger to get payback? Anybody know? Are they bringing any charging revenues now? I did not here any discussion of this in the conference call.
Yo! Why dis down so much? Amazon sell shares?
"Up over 4% pre-market, down over 5.5% 20 minutes after open. What the $%#@ is up with the market and this stock???"
Down another 5 % this week.
"In their latest ""press release"" they say most drivers drive under 40 miles per day....if that is the case then why would anybody need to charge at a pizza shop, a Burger King, or anywhere else that BLNK has put a charger.....I forgot all the Walgreens.....people will charge at their homes for a quarter of the cost"
pretty much floor traders play the emotions of retail traders and investors.
the share price is now lower than before the infrastructure announcement....down to $ 10
"13 months ago today Blink shares were at $2.50, with 10% fewer shares outstanding. Since then, the business has lost money (not made a profit), sold a total of approx $7 mil in revenues / sales… and raised $220+ mil by diluting their shareholders by 10% (at least they did it at an elevated share price). Now they sit still with a market cap of $1.4 billion. 13 months ago the market cap was under $100 mil, still terribly overpriced for a company at the time with no cash doing $5 mil a year in total sales and zero profits… crazy stuff. What in the world makes guys think blink won’t be at $2.5 again in the next 12 months? In 12 months all that $220 mil will be gone with nothing to show for it…"

"Just to put this in perspective. For the company to justify its current market cap, they would need to sell and install 416,000 units. 500 units in Belgium over 4 years? Is that the big news?"
No money spent on R & D yet they can give each other 9 million in raises and stock options. Blink's Management Stinks.
while Blink missed earning many know these analysts were wrong the none reported analyst felt this was inline next earning will be much improved. toe a high surprise.
"had to exit. couldn't exacerbate a 23% loss. its going down, financials aren't good"
"Gas Diesel on way out that's a fact doesn't matter what administration is in charge, no pun intended. World will always need more and more chargers. Room for multiple companies."
I love BLNK CEO - Michael is a great manager who is super intelligent knows the buisness exteremely sensitive who has suffered major family sufferings in his life.
market gonna crash and all things in it. If you don't see it with the Hiden and Harry administration in charge (no pun) you should not be playing the stock marker.
At the rate they require cash for compensation and admin expenses they only have 4 years of cash or $188M left.
"""What goes up must come down"" ...Sir Isaac Newton. This stock's valuation is still in the stratosphere."
"Seems the norm these days is sell BLNK (down another 2 1/2 percent today) and buy CHPT (up 4.30 percent). Which makes no sense considering they made a another deal last week (any deal is a good deal for them) Really want to see action here in the US. That's where we need to start with some deal making like set ups at Walmart, Costco, Home Depo or Lowes etc etc etc... Until then hate to say could be dead money for a long time. FYI I am long for the record for now. Good luck to us longs."
Hey when does BLNK get their share of the $6B charging infrastructure money?

Here are some facts about RMO and why we should see it go much higher. 1. Market cap $650M (was $5.2B!!)2. Cash on hand $267M ( enough for 3yrs without making revenue) while they expect to bring rev in Q3.3. have their own patents + working factury4. 32% held by insiders + 28% held by institutions 5. short % of float around 30%6. cash and revenue should start coming from Lion Electric7. new sharp CEO with impressive resume! 8. production for Paccar long term contract is about to start.IMO the risk reward ratio and current price is laughable and its a strong buy in my opinion. its just too good to be true. I am super bullish! do your own DD.$XL $BLNK $FSR $RIDE
DA Davidson initiates BLNK with neutral rating and price target of $ 31.........wow a lot of conviction in that call.....some broker wanted their analyst to cover it so they kept some institutional business
Are you a day trader? Then you need to check out (http://trademarketview.tech). Their daily watchlists are highly researched and take note of the latest stock market news. A must for any investor!
Blink is all about heavy self promotion for the benefit of large selling insider holders. They could care less about putting effort into building a non existent business.
A nice RED day for the greenwashers. WTG!
Worth $0
Missed earnings targets for the last five quarters. I am going out on a limb and guessing that they will miss again. Call it a hunch.

"With earnings later this week I don't have a problem with them missing eps, that's all part of growing, but if revenue does not explode and the short interest over 35% this could be a rough week"
You all know your buying a company with an inflated valuation of 1.6 billion... right?
Blowout
Blinkie moving higher today. The shorts getting creamed. No one cares if they lose money hand over fist and the CEO makes more salary than they have revenue.
Moving farther and farther away from profitability.
My belief as a nobody is you should not have to increase compensation for new hires to gain their interest to join a company. They should join because they actually believe in the company and want to be with a winner. Maybe wait to compensate until they prove themselves thu earnings. That's how a real CEO would do it.

"don't forget Dan said back in Feb when Blnk was $56....'easy swing trade to $60"" with supreme confidence-Dan has been quiet-"
hey they installed 5 chargers that they don't own and won't be on their network........what a great press release.....sarcasm.....SCAM
Does this outfit make money selling/installing charging station s or actual charging (e.g. $10 per charge) or both.
Some one playing with this stock almost 3 million trades was down 35 cents then all of a sudden a quick pop and its was up 35 now down 40 cents again. Why is CHPT up 62 cents as of this writing? Would of though that BLNK would be up today if there is going to finally be a separate infrastructure bill rather than a piggy back with the other one.
shortssuk......looks like your rocket ran out of fuel
I believe as competition increases many will not be able to catch up or take over market share. This also increases a chance for big pockets to buy out Blink.

"This stock is too expensive, go Evgo"
Analyst Needham says Buy BLNK on Yahoo finance.
Blink has and sells home chargers and nice looking ones at that.
This stock has been dropping since Feb. Last earnings were the final straw. No catalyst to turn this stock price around. Will continue its downward trend.
How many of you Approve the Compensation question in Proxy votes? We should all Disapprove every one of them unless the executives and Board Members actually made you money YoY. I guess this is what you get from SPAC's
"Does anyone know how much it costs to fully charge an EV at one of these stations and figure out how many charges it would take for BLNK to get paid back for a charging unit install? Do they own the chargers, rent, or sell them. Trying to determine how they will ever make a profit or does nobody care because it's EV and it's hip right now to own EV stock."
CHPT is taking off AH
"According to the news, it costs FLA $250,000 per charging station? That seems kind of inflated."
Just went long on this. Just 80 shares. Plan is to keep adding on the way down. These guys are claiming charging spots in areas that are convenient and desirable and upgrading existing charging points. Looking to hold 400 shares when I’m done
"Nice report, BUT, what's up with this statement - ""Second quarter 2021 net loss is primarily attributable to an increase in compensation expense and general and administrative expenses.?"" Re they paying the C suite people far too much? Hmmmm"
CHPT is soaring and roarong after hours due to strong revenue growth and BLNK by far more creative and majore sofware and harwarre design amd research oriented.
"how is it that this is up premarket, once the markets open it just drops like a sack of potatoes...."
Can someone explain why they believe this company deserves a market cap over a billion if it's going to do 15-20 million in revenue over the next 4 quarters
At home charging daily for 80% of owners. Locations within 150 miles of home are useless to regular consumers who will only use if free. Blink could try going after Tesla long distance network I guess 
Wow only 81 charging stations total in New Jersey. How is the company worth 1.6 billion again? How can they possibly sustain themselves.
I miss Pehzman's posts. Anyone know where he went?

How are y’all voting ? For the proxy
looks like another down day for blinkie-winkie
Havent been looking but it's true only chargers I've seen in my city and surroundings are Blink chargers.
buy and hold to 100 burn shorts
"the good news is they have a level 2 charger at a barbershop in Lansing , MI that costs $ 0.20 per 60 seconds.......that in my book is an expensive hair cut"
"BLNK may benefit from a new disruptive tech that is beginning to be commercialized. BTRAN from Ideal Power is a patented bi-directional power switch that reduces conduction losses by 5X vs. legacy IGBT devices. A major player in the charging space is demonstrating this new tech internally...do your homework on IPWR and you'll see. You're welcome.Full disclosure: I am LONG IPWR and I will continue to add because in my opinion, this is a 10-bagger in the next 2 years (provided they don't get bought out sooner)."
"it does not matter if the double there earnings when it seems like they are hemorrhaging cash. look at their losses vs 1 year ago? what changed? what will change to retain more of their earnings. A company can not work to loose cash or even break even. This is a young growth company, which is expected to have initial losses before becoming profitable but the high change in YOY losses makes me believe there is something wrong. No real news on the direction of this company. The US infrastructure bill will not turn this company around."
"I’m all in with Blink…Also Picked up more EVGO….Electric cars are what cell phones were in 1997..The nay sayers complained about battery life, connect ability…They now are using those same devices trying to push down the price on charge stations .."
BLNK go to $25 to $30 tomorrow

"ACRX up 9%, way oversold, ACRX add to watch list 300% in 2022! ABML $BLNK $FCEL my top alternative energy picks!!!"
"Around six weeks ago I bought both $RKLB and $MNTS, as I felt deep pocket players were going to heavily jump back into the space sector prior to the end of this year and that the (relatively) smaller space companies would see the greatest gains.Companies like $SPCE have, in my opinion, played out, while RKLB, MNTS and others have yet to run up. I believe this week's bounce is just a fraction of where these stocks will be trading weeks/months from now.Last year TSLA ran up big, and the rest of the EV sector soon followed; to include companies like $BLNK. The same is going to happen here with these small cap space stocks; and especially so with SpaceX now having a $70B market cap. (And a Starlink IPO somewhere on the horizon.)Now is the time to buy stocks like RKLB, MNTS; etc., as they are going to see huge gains in a relatively short amount of time."
buy hold buy hold come on Reddits
Waiting for Farkas to sell more shares. He's doing a terrific job with the NRs. Worth $20M per year .
"not sure why $evgo is singled out to fall today... while $CHPT and $BLNK doing well... Even the volume has dried upbut my stake is much higher in EVGO, so, of course!"
"""Blink Charging Co. (Nasdaq: BLNK, BLNKW) (“Blink” or the “Company”), a leading owner, operator, and provider of electric vehicle (EV) charging equipment and services, today announced the deployment of five fast IQ 200 Level 2 AC EV charging stations at the Holiday Manufacturing Inc. facility in Framingham, Massachusetts.The purchase and installation of the host owned Blink IQ 200 chargers were made possible by the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection and Eversource (New England’s largest energy provider), which provided funding to support this deployment via the MassEVIP Workplace and Fleet Charging program, as well as the Eversource Make-Ready program.“As we continue to grow our northeast market share, we are pleased that small businesses like Holiday Manufacturing understand that the future of transportation is all electric and have the foresight to deploy our IQ 200 EV charging stations, knowing they won’t fall victim to the planned obsolescence of other Level 2 chargers,” remarked Blink’s President Brendan Jones. “This agreement is a testament to the forward thinking of Holiday Manufacturing and its desire to lead by example by providing its employees and the general public with accessible EV charging. As one of only three EV charging station locations in Framingham, we applaud Holiday Manufacturing for its role in expanding EV charging in the region.Holiday Manufacturing is a family-owned bow and ribbon wholesaler headquartered in Framingham, Massachusetts. It manufactures hand-made bows and ribbons for a variety of occasions and sells them online directly to customers. Like Blink, Holiday Manufacturing is a flexible and nimble company which can accommodate both stock and custom orders.Erik Simon, President of Holiday Manufacturing, commented on the deployment as follows: “We are pleased to offer the public and our staff access to EV charging with Blink’s IQ 200 chargers. We are committed to reducing our impact on the environment and deploying these state-of-the-art EV chargers at our facility is a significant step towards accomplishing that goal.”For the installation of the charging stations, Holiday Manufacturing upgraded its electrical infrastructure to 100amp circuits for each charger, allowing it to provide up to 65 miles of range per 1 hour of charge, the fastest Level 2 charging on the market"""
expect some profit taking then expect the ones that took profits to buy back in at higher price.
shorts can not hold this down for long ..
You see.I told you the Reddit is going to take action; you didn’t believe me!!
"Any of y’all live in northern virginia, DC area? Free chargers up here in the mall parking lots! Sponsored by Cox communications. I told you ev charging will be free in the long run. Convenience stores, auto manufacturers, they want your business, they can sell sponsorship contracts… the idea there is money in a company that doesn’t even produce an EV product is laughable…"
December Blink will be in black with earnings then to the moon.
The EV market is currently about low 2% of the market with executive order even at a modest 10% of the market This stock is work 5 times more or about 170-180 a share. What a deal?
