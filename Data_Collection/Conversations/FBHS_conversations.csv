"Eventhough PE is average on S&P, dividend is stoo small for the current PE"
"CEO, Chris Klein, was just awarded 48,000 shares (approx $2.25MM) on February 9. It couldn't possibly be for the company's 2018 performance, could it? The Compensation Committee of the Board needs to be taken to task for opening up the purse for such putrid performance. If you were in sales and your sales volume dropped ~40% in one year you sure as heck wouldn't get a bonus. You'd be lucky to retain your job. How Chris Klein is able to not only hang onto his job but be rewarded so handsomely is a travesty of the highest order."
"Quote from the article ""huge debt remains a problem"". Increasing interest rates and ever-increasing, huge debt is a recipe for disaster as servicing the huge debt becomes more costly. Chris Klein's smoke and mirrors are fogging up...https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fortune-brands-fbhs-prices-600m-135001725.html"

So much talk about the debacle happening at GE. Down 27% since January. Simply awful. But did you know that FBHS is down 35% since January? Makes GE seem like AAPL in comparison.
"A few excerpts from the article below:""The company has a dismal earnings surprise history. In the trailing four quarters, its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate once and missed thrice, the average negative earnings surprise being 4.54%. Notably, in the last reported quarter, the company posted earnings of 93 cents, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.05 by 11.43%.Over the past six months, the company’s shares have lost 25.8%, wider than 11.5% decline recorded by the industry it belongs to.""https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fortune-brands-home-security-inc-110505171.html"
Don't believe me about insiders selling? Check this out.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dont-ignore-fact-insider-just-115118307.html
"Declining revenues, declining profits, another earnings miss and the refrain continues... How on earth is Chris Klein still employed, much less being compensated as preposterously as he is? Mind boggling."
FBHS reached a new 52 Week Low at $43.70
"Well, well, well. Look what showed up today. Chris Klein sells another $6MM. So, revising the totals I posted yesterday; IN THE PAST 3 WEEKS, insiders,especially Chris Klein, have sole 229,000+ shares totaling $14.5MM+! Yep, you read that correctly. See the link for yourself.https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FBHS/insider-transactions?p=FBHS"

"See my previous post from yesterday as a foretelling. Chris Klein lowers guidance again. Makes it easier for him and executives to reap bonus $ while laying off rank and file workers. Dude is a lousy CEO, to understate the situation. Can't forecast markets or trends and cannot execute his business plan. Wonder if he lowered any of the FBHS divisions' plans or just his? Rhetorical..."

"Stock price is down 27% from 52 week high. Miserable performance. FBHS is also under-performing its main competitor, MAS, based on any timeframe one could look at, back to when FBHS went public. How on earth does Chris Klein continue in his position and why is he allowed to siphon off millions of dollars when, by any benchmark, the company, as evidenced by share price, is not merely under-performing but has been a terrible investment? Hey, many investments in the past 8-10 years have been lifted by a broad-based rising tide. Market conditions for FBHS have been and continue to be ideal, yet the stock price is beaten down. Conditions are still ripe and it is time for some improvement. Where is Bill Ackman when you need him?"
FBHS underperforming relative to the market and competitors. Look at 5 year chart of FBHS and MAS. If you worked for them you would be on thin ice or already gone. Why in the world is Chris Klein still the CEO?
"Several divisions of FBHS have laid off employees. Management cutting expenses, yet again, to prop up their pay incentives. A company cannot continue ad infinitum to purchase other companies and cut the fat from the acquisitions to inorganically generate profits. The cautionary example for all to behold is Kraft-Heinz. Chris Klein is blindly leading FBHS down that very path at the expense of folks who have been employed in their jobs far longer than he. His misguided evaluation of the housing market, on which the company is utterly dependent, is famously WRONG again. New home construction? Down. Remodeling? Down. Caveat investor."
anybody notice CEO selling? $42 million in past year. Does he know something we don't?https://finance.yahoo.com/screener/insider/KLEIN%20CHRISTOPHER%20J

Been saying it for years (you can go back and read my posts on this board). Chris Klein has used FBHS as his personal ATM machine. Now you can see for yourselves. 15 trades since 2012 when stock was at highs. No selling at lows. Impeccable timing. https://wallmine.com/people/34046/christopher-j-klein
"Hello all, I haven't posted here in quite a while but I just wanted to bring everyone up to date on the wheeling/dealings by Christopher Klein. Y'all remember him, right? Well, I was just reviewing some filings and thought some of you might be interested to know HOW MUCH MONEY HE HAS CASHED IN since November 2019. Keep in mind that his FBHS stock sales in 2021 have been nil so, actually the sales were predominately in 2020. Ready, try $70,320,974! Now, my issue isn't that he sold shares. My issue is what in the world could he have possibly done to warrant that kind of compensation? And it isn't all accumulated over the years. If you look back I have been posting his sales for quite some time now and the compensation is mindboggling. The Compensation Committee is rubberstamping it. And now that Fink is more or less in charge you can tell from his recent and accelerating stock sales that the Committee is still permitting obscene executive pay (although not as much as with Klein). And here's the real rub with respect to Klein's compensation. Just take a look at the chart since FBHS launched compared to MAS, the hated main competitor to FBHS. Yep, you guessed it; underperformance vs the competition. That kind of longterm performance would have gotten you the ax in any of the individual companies under the corporate umbrella. So, take solace in the decent performance of your FBHS shares, I do. But never lose sight of the extravagant compensation given to the executives of this company and for goodness sake vote your proxies, especially with respect to executive pay. Oh, and just let me leave you with this number again. 70,320,974! In the past 24mo alone..."
"Another insider/director selling. I'll save you the math...in the past 3 weeks insiders have sold 132K shares totaling $8.2MM. And make no mistake, these shares were either given to them or optioned at hugely discounted purchase prices. They did not and do not have a skin in the game. Nevertheless, the insider selling is accelerating. Make of it what you will... Maybe they need it for Christmas gifts, who knows?https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FBHS/insider-transactions?p=FBHS"

New 52 week low today. Oof
I have been saying this for years (see posts to this medium). Now it is being written about. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/worry-fortune-brands-home-security-105925328.html
Zack's has a Sell Rating on FBHS going into earnings announcements.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fortune-brands-fbhs-disappoint-earnings-141502381.html
FBHS is down -7.69% to 64.45
Inching downward toward 52 week low. Isn't share price a significant measure of CEO performance? Where is Bill Ackman when you need him?
"CEO, Chris Klein has lost control over the company. Cannot generate revenue growth, much less bottom line increases from existing businesses. Must continue to search for ways too acquire companies to coax any kind of decent looking financial results. In addition he has stooped to share buybacks that serve only to artificially inflate EPS which is how he is compensated. Worst kind of management activity. Should be investing in CAPEX and the workers."
"FBHS raises dividend. Sound good? Think again. It is nothing more than a feeble attempt to placate investors so Chris Klein can keep a hold of his job. Here are some excerpts from the article;""Weak sentiments toward the stock can also be seen from the downward revision in earnings estimates for 2018 and 2019. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share is currently pegged at $3.43 for 2018 and $3.86 for 2019, reflecting the decline of 5.8% and 7% from the respective tallies 60 days ago"" Got that? 60 days ago!And this, ""Further, the company’s stock price has decreased 22.2% in the past three months compared with the industry’s 15.5% decline"". 22% decline in share price over the PAST 3 MONTHS! AND lagging the industry, in other words, sever under-performance vis a vis competitors and their markets in general. Oh, btw, stock is down 45% since January and down on a ytd, 1yr, 3yr and 5yr timeframe. That, friends, is a marked TREND.Cutting budgets, laying off workers, pandering to shareholders. All desperate acts of a CEO who has utterly FAILED the business."
FBHS is up 4.94% to 56.63
"In January 2018 the share price was $73+. Now it is $53. Down 27% in 8 months. All three major indices (Dow, Nasdaq and S&P) are up comfortably. Main competitor, MAS, is down during same time frame but only 10%. Anyone else have a problem with the CEO's compensation?"
