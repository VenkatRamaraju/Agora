Just getting up to speed on this situation... Anyone know why this is trading so low other than the fact they are operating in an inflationary environment in Argentina? Looks like a solid company. Oaktree (Legendary Mr. Howard Marks) seems to have sold his position in this company recently. Not a financial advisor and cannot be held liable for my remarks.

"Has TEO announced an orderly dividend payout quarterly? If so, what months will be dividend months?Looking pre-merger, the dividends stacked up at the end of 2017 and again in first qtr, 2018.Perhaps those were last payouts to shareholders of TEO before the cable merger?Thanks for any responses. Just trying to map out what months dividends might show up."

"Furthermore, what are TEO shareholders thinking of the Vodafone agreement to share best practices?Vodafone has the cable-cellular model and is huge. In any case, reaching out for sharing of business development strategies seems very smart for a company so recently merged with another company. It gives a higher intelligence to how to go forward perhaps in Argentina with cable and cellular together.Anyone think this might be a precursor to a buyout of TEO by Vodafone?One of the few continents Vodafone does not play is South America, and I don't believe they play in North America either."
