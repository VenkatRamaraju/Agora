"Furthermore, what are TEO shareholders thinking of the Vodafone agreement to share best practices?Vodafone has the cable-cellular model and is huge. In any case, reaching out for sharing of business development strategies seems very smart for a company so recently merged with another company. It gives a higher intelligence to how to go forward perhaps in Argentina with cable and cellular together.Anyone think this might be a precursor to a buyout of TEO by Vodafone?One of the few continents Vodafone does not play is South America, and I don't believe they play in North America either."

"Has TEO announced an orderly dividend payout quarterly? If so, what months will be dividend months?Looking pre-merger, the dividends stacked up at the end of 2017 and again in first qtr, 2018.Perhaps those were last payouts to shareholders of TEO before the cable merger?Thanks for any responses. Just trying to map out what months dividends might show up."
