"Has TEO announced an orderly dividend payout quarterly? If so, what months will be dividend months?Looking pre-merger, the dividends stacked up at the end of 2017 and again in first qtr, 2018.Perhaps those were last payouts to shareholders of TEO before the cable merger?Thanks for any responses.

Just getting up to speed on this situation... Anyone know why this is trading so low other than the fact they are operating in an inflationary environment in Argentina? Looks like a solid company. Oaktree (Legendary Mr. Howard Marks) seems to have sold his position in this company recently. Not a financial advisor and cannot be held liable for my remarks.
