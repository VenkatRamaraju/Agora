There is a small possibility someone else could have been studying the idea of acquiring RAVN and would make a move (offer a higher price) at the last minute. This happens often enough that I think a 1% premium might be justified even though there are few companies who might be interested. The timing becomes more likely as we get closer to the shareholders meeting and a potential acquirer must make a decision or give up all chance of buying them.
"Absolutely love this stock, when you do the research, what this company does is incredible"
I heard about RAVN the other day on (http://Multistockalerts.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
Getting too pricey too quickly.PE Ratio (TTM) 54.811y Target Est 31.67
"Anyone have any real reasons why this continues to trade above $58. Voting done/in progress, etc. seems like $58 price is about cemented as it gets..."

Cheers! A (virtual) toast to other long-term RAVN holders.
Glad I bought this at $32.80 about a month or so ago.
"Looks like it is a done deal. Still saying in Q4, but the vote passed.SIOUX FALLS, S.D., September 15, 2021--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Raven Industries, Inc. (the Company; NASDAQ:RAVN) announced that, at a special meeting held on September 15, 2021, its shareholders voted strongly to approve the pending transaction with CNH Industrial N.V. (NYSE: CNHI / MI: CNHI). More than 71% of the outstanding shares of Raven voted, and of the shares that voted, over 99% voted in favor of the transaction with CNH Industrial."
"Well, the earnings report tonight was a little weaker than I expected. Revenues were $2M less than my guess, but earnings were .15 less than my guess. Conference call tomorrow at 10 AM, but I would expect to see shares drop to $32 or $33 over the next couple weeks or so."

Raven should be a few billion-dollar company by now.
Stock is being accumulated by the big boys & girls (I see you Cathie Wood). Mid 40’s should be in the cards in the next 2-3 months or less.
Bought today at 32.80. Good long term holding IMO.
"Space News (1/21, Subscription Publication) reports that Alphabet’s Loon subsidiary announced Thursday that it is shutting down. Loon used high-altitude balloons to deliver internet connectivity to areas with limited connectivity, such as rural areas and regions affected by natural disasters. Loon began as a project under X, Alphabet’s “moonshot factory,” then spun out into a subsidiary in 2018 after test deployments. Astro Teller, who leads X, said in a blog post that the company will wind down operations in the coming months because “the road to commercial viability has proven much longer and riskier than hoped.”"
Why would RAVN go up to $59.40 at the close today? They announced a sale later this year for $58.
"ARK buys 23,201 more shares yesterday. Cathie knows something."
"Down 60% from the recent highs. Is it a bargain? I have no idea, but am adding around $20. Hoping that it will be a double 2 years from now if there is anything left of the company, or country for that matter. Good luck to all of us."
