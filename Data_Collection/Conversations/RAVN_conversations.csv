"Any theories on what happened on March 19, 2021? 4th quarter results were off but for the year, the company reported a profit of $18.9 million, or 52 cents per share. Sales down 5.94% and project Loon is winding down. What was the reason for the big sell off on Friday March 19, 2021 ahead of the actual report on March 22, 2021?"

"And, interesting to see they plan to stop doing conference calls after this one. The PR today was pretty informative and might be as good as a CC, but I really like to hear management live on the call. You can learn quite a bit about how they handle themselves on the calls.Investor Communications:With the changing sell-side research dynamics and the decline in analysts covering small-cap equities, the Company intends to change the format of its quarterly investor relations communications. These changes will entail a more detailed earnings release that will incorporate what has typically been provided by our executives in their comments on the Company’s investor conference calls. This quarter’s earnings release serves as an example of what investors can expect going forward. In conjunction with this change, the Company no longer intends to host investor conference calls in the traditional manner on a quarterly basis. The Company will replace the traditional conference call with scheduled one-on-one calls from interested investors and analysts but may host a traditional conference call from time to time on a less frequent basis. To schedule a one-on-one call, please contact Bo Larsen, our Director of Investor Relations. His contact information is provided at the end of this earnings release and is also on the Company’s website. In addition, the Company expects to align the timing of its quarterly earnings releases going forward with the timing of the filings of its Form 10-Q. This new approach will streamline investor communications and more efficiently provide the same level of detail and insights that the Company’s investors have become accustomed to receiving historically."

"Can't believe the spin on the release. The suspension of the dividend to focus on aggressive growth means they are not comfortable with cash flow going forward.

"Just a couple of thoughts on the Q2 results. Overall, looks like a decent report. They beat my estimates and had records for earnings and revenues for any Q2. Still, the share price is at all time highs, so I wouldn’t expect a big move up and there may even be some profit taking. Cash was up $14M to $65M or almost $2 per share, so that’s a nice bump. EF had revenues of almost $59M and AT was only $30M with Aerostar bringing up the rear at $13.5M. Never thought EF would be the horse pulling the wagon. Still, the profit margin for AT is almost twice that of the other two divisions. But, R&D spending is 65% AT, 25% AS and 10% to EF. No mention of Google Loon in the PR."

Maybe I was wrong. I am now watching the Investor Day presentation and it's very impressive. I feel much better about holding the shares for the longer term. I think my loss of dividends will pay even more dividends down the road.
Longs: At what price point would you sell?
There is a small possibility someone else could have been studying the idea of acquiring RAVN and would make a move (offer a higher price) at the last minute. This happens often enough that I think a 1% premium might be justified even though there are few companies who might be interested. The timing becomes more likely as we get closer to the shareholders meeting and a potential acquirer must make a decision or give up all chance of buying them.
