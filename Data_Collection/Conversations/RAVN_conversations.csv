"And, interesting to see they plan to stop doing conference calls after this one. The PR today was pretty informative and might be as good as a CC, but I really like to hear management live on the call. You can learn quite a bit about how they handle themselves on the calls.Investor Communications:With the changing sell-side research dynamics and the decline in analysts covering small-cap equities, the Company intends to change the format of its quarterly investor relations communications. These changes will entail a more detailed earnings release that will incorporate what has typically been provided by our executives in their comments on the Company’s investor conference calls. This quarter’s earnings release serves as an example of what investors can expect going forward. In conjunction with this change, the Company no longer intends to host investor conference calls in the traditional manner on a quarterly basis. The Company will replace the traditional conference call with scheduled one-on-one calls from interested investors and analysts but may host a traditional conference call from time to time on a less frequent basis. To schedule a one-on-one call, please contact Bo Larsen, our Director of Investor Relations. His contact information is provided at the end of this earnings release and is also on the Company’s website. In addition, the Company expects to align the timing of its quarterly earnings releases going forward with the timing of the filings of its Form 10-Q. This new approach will streamline investor communications and more efficiently provide the same level of detail and insights that the Company’s investors have become accustomed to receiving historically."
"Looks like it is a done deal. Still saying in Q4, but the vote passed.SIOUX FALLS, S.D., September 15, 2021--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Raven Industries, Inc.

(NYSE: CNHI / MI: CNHI). More than 71% of the outstanding shares of Raven voted, and of the shares that voted, over 99% voted in favor of the transaction with CNH Industrial."

"And finally, a NT 10-Q filing. Doesn't sound that significant.Raven Industries, Inc. (the “Company”) has identified two deficiencies in the design and one deficiency in the operating effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting each of which existed as of October 31, 2015, January 31, 2016 and April 30, 2016. The design deficiencies relate to i) verification and monitoring of the Company’s inventory cycle counting process and ii) management’s testing over the reliability of system-generated information used in its financial reporting process. The deficiency in operating effectiveness relates to the development and review of estimates used in the cash flow forecasts related to the fiscal 2016 goodwill impairment assessment for Vista Research, Inc. (“Vista”). The Company has determined that the two design deficiencies are material weaknesses and is continuing to evaluate the severity of the operating effectiveness deficiency which could also result in a material weakness.Management is diligently assessing any potential effect on the Company’s previously issued financial statements with respect to the goodwill impairment. It is possible that through this process the Company will determine that the amount of the goodwill impairment recorded in fiscal 2016 could be adjusted, and such adjustment could be material. The Company previously determined that the goodwill of the Vista reporting unit was impaired by $7.4 million. At the end of fiscal year 2016, the remaining goodwill amount related to Vista was $4.1 million.On September 12, 2016, the Company determined that it will file an amendment to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016 as well as to its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended April 30, 2016 and October 31, 2015 to reflect the conclusions by the Company’s management that internal control over financial reporting and disclosure control and procedures were not effective as of those dates. As a result of the continuing analysis of these matters, the Company has not been able to finalize its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended July 31, 2016. The Company will file such Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q after the Company completes its analysis."
"NT-10Q filed today.We currently anticipate that the results of operations for the quarter ended October 31, 2016 will be significantly different from the corresponding period for the last fiscal year on a reported basis based on improved operating results driven by sales growth and margin improvement in both the Company’s Applied Technology and Engineered Films Divisions, offset by weakness in the Aerostar Division’s performance. These trends in the Company’s operations are consistent with performance trends experienced for the period ended July 31, 2016. However, until the Company has completed its review of the matters impacting restatement of prior periods, and completes procedures with respect to current period matters, the Company is unable to estimate the results of operations for the third quarter. Until the Company has completed its review and files its amended reports, the Company will not be reporting financial results for the period ended October 31, 2016."

"Just a couple of thoughts on the Q2 results. Overall, looks like a decent report. They beat my estimates and had records for earnings and revenues for any Q2. Still, the share price is at all time highs, so I wouldn’t expect a big move up and there may even be some profit taking. Cash was up $14M to $65M or almost $2 per share, so that’s a nice bump. EF had revenues of almost $59M and AT was only $30M with Aerostar bringing up the rear at $13.5M. Never thought EF would be the horse pulling the wagon. Still, the profit margin for AT is almost twice that of the other two divisions. But, R&D spending is 65% AT, 25% AS and 10% to EF. No mention of Google Loon in the PR."

"First time I've looked in and found some activity. We've had similar changes in the past and gradually I've become accustomed to how it works, but always seems like a step backward at the time.I find the jump for both Raven and Daktronics this morning to be inexplicable. Had forgotten about the inclusion, but don't see why that should make any significant difference anyway. Daktronics is up 24% on EPS which just look average or worse to me. I'm sure tempted to make a jump here and believe I have some calls on offer for sale at $20. I'm sure when I look I'll find they've popped."

There is a small possibility someone else could have been studying the idea of acquiring RAVN and would make a move (offer a higher price) at the last minute. This happens often enough that I think a 1% premium might be justified even though there are few companies who might be interested. The timing becomes more likely as we get closer to the shareholders meeting and a potential acquirer must make a decision or give up all chance of buying them.

Labor in farming will be an even larger component of cost. So I have confidence in RAVN solutions but uncertainty is too high. The lack of tests is hard to swallow. Somebody really screwed up on that count.Personally, age and compromised inmune means a big concern, but still believe we will come out of this and hopefully the leaders will live up to their post hereon out."
Stock is being accumulated by the big boys & girls (I see you Cathie Wood). Mid 40’s should be in the cards in the next 2-3 months or less.

"Space News (1/21, Subscription Publication) reports that Alphabet’s Loon subsidiary announced Thursday that it is shutting down. Loon used high-altitude balloons to deliver internet connectivity to areas with limited connectivity, such as rural areas and regions affected by natural disasters. Loon began as a project under X, Alphabet’s “moonshot factory,” then spun out into a subsidiary in 2018 after test deployments. Astro Teller, who leads X, said in a blog post that the company will wind down operations in the coming months because “the road to commercial viability has proven much longer and riskier than hoped.”"
"Down 60% from the recent highs. Is it a bargain? I have no idea, but am adding around $20. Hoping that it will be a double 2 years from now if there is anything left of the company, or country for that matter. Good luck to all of us."
Nice pop this morning from Raven's inclusion in the S&P small cap 600. I would expect it to fade away pretty quick.

"RAVN was supposed to report earnings after the bell yesterday but didn't. Usually when they are good the company can't wait to get the earnings out but when they're bad they usually try to time to lessen the damage, like maybe releasing after the market closes the day before Thanksgiving. Bad omen."

This sure is different. Will take some getting used to a message board like this and Investor Village is so easy to use.
Pretty good results really. Disaster films were a nice bonus also. $8M last Q and about the same expected for the current Q. I was looking at some real estate pictures on Zillow from the Keys and there are many houses with blue film on the roofs.

"Can't believe the spin on the release. The suspension of the dividend to focus on aggressive growth means they are not comfortable with cash flow going forward. A more honest wording would have been, we have decided a better return for investors is in the company's future growth and are ceasing the dividend distribution policy."

Longs: At what price point would you sell?
Does anyone know if they are ever going to post a replay of the last earnings call? I like the direction of this company but their IR team needs to get it together.Last quarter nobody seemed to even know they were reporting earnings until the day it occurred. Haven't encountered before that since I have been investing.
