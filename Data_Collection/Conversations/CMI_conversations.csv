"ha, another red day for this overvalued stock."
I am surprised a company like Berkshire Hathaway has not bought out CMI yet . Seems like great fit especially since CMI expanded into hydrogen in a strong way .Multiple very profitable divisions .
dividend coming soon. China deal soon. Earnings very good and stock has moved up very nicely. I keep the 175 target.
Wow can't believe the people and machines selling Cummins today. Why? Because a car company that can't even produce its main business cars on time and in promise volumes announces basically a proto type
On the way to $228 level.
Cummins 20 year joint venture with Westport Fuel System expires at end of year. No sure if Cummins is comfortable with Westport as a business partner. Cummins will provide top grade natural gas for a long time
"Funny how a stock bouncing off it's all time high is considered a dog. The company has solid fundamentals, gives clear (and usually conservative) guidance, and despite being cyclical, has an industry leading growth rate."
"Bought a 1995 dodge 2500 new with 5.9 liter Cummins diesel. Used only full synthetic delvac mobil one 5w-40. Still running well today with 1,000,000plus miles. Also, original transmission and rear end; again using only synthetic oil in them as well. Log book tells the tale."
Anyone know why stock up so much today?
Is this new 15L natural gas engine spark ignited or compression ignited? Is this a Westport engine?
Told you all year it was overvalued…buy back much lower.
I own CMI as a cheaper way in investing fuel cell technologies.
Hydrogen is the future. Management here need to get acquainted with FC applications within the real market in order to foreseen the future.
It’s a great company to work in. Great management and solid market share. Have quite a lot in natural gas and electric engines.
Ouch! What’s happening here! 
Earnings + Dividend +China settlement + revenue gain = 175
Sold swing trade position as CMI is near the upper Bollinger Band.
"I have been following CMI for years and its P/E ratio has always been around 12-14...today the stock price was 220.80 and its P/E ratio is about 19.6. That would mean if the P/E ratio today were 14, the stock price should be 158. Can someone please explain this to me or offer any insight???"
"Amazon $AMZN has ordered more than 1,000 natural gas-powered trucks for its U.S delivery fleetThe engine will be supplied by a joint venture between Cummins $CMI and Westpoint Fuel $WPRT"
"CMI was just downgraded by Goldman Sachs. Glad I sold the other day. Had a feeling this was going to happen. It just couldn't seem to gain any ground. Cummins (CAT, DE etc.) seems to be in a down turn. Not sure how long it will last, and didn't want to stick around to see. GLTA"
