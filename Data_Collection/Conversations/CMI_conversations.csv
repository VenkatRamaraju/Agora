not too many companies give you a yearly 15% raise!
"Q2 Earnings preview? Anyone think this group may have an unpleasant surprise? But, on the other hand, estimates are way down so is it an easy beat coming up. I think they will pre-announce to lower expectations a bit more. Of more concern is cycle recovery. Could be years recall after 2009..."

"Eric, why are you so negative on CMI? Cash flow is fine, shareholder equity has increased, dividend is growing...is it because you think its overvalued and its been going down?"
$8 million dividend this quarter ($20 million for the 9 months) from the Cummins Westport joint venture!
"CMI 25d SMA is about to cross 50d SMA, if it does, it's positive for the upside. RSI is about 70 (80 will be overbought) and OBV is on the uptrend which is positive. Will hold the stock and may sell out when RSI hits between 70 and 80."
Buy this dip earnings Feb 6
really cheap..22 pe...hydrogen fuel cell. ev...could triple
CMI recently purchased Hydrogenics. They'll be making hydrogen fueled truck engines soon.
Cummins (CMI) will not be able to improve its offer shareholders will not be willing to pay 2 or 3 billion dollars for Hydrogenics (HYGS).that will plunge the diesel engine manufacturer into crisis.
"loop energy. best in class hydrogen fuel cell manufacturers, part owned my cummins. "
I am surprised a company like Berkshire Hathaway has not bought out CMI yet . Seems like great fit especially since CMI expanded into hydrogen in a strong way .Multiple very profitable divisions .
This is now up 10 a share and will add when it dips. Long
Moving nicely as I predicted 2 days ago. Should move to 150+ soon.
OH NO......PLEASE BUY TO KEEP IT PUMPED....BUY BUY BUY
"“Piper Sandler says the next six to twelve months will be crucial for Tesla ($TSLA -0.6%) in regard to the company's prospects in truck-related markets.Analyst Alexander Potter warns that ""temporary selloffs"" could be seen if the truck initiative sees production delays.”One reason more to believe that natural gas is the only option, and $cmi knows it $hyln"
CMI is helpless stock. DOW up 240 points last two days and this POS is up like $.40and that's after being down $21
I don't understand why CMI is down so much today. Is there some news I missed?
Cummins reached an all time high at 225.84
Vaccines if approved helps trucking
Cummins 20 year joint venture with Westport Fuel System expires at end of year. No sure if Cummins is comfortable with Westport as a business partner. Cummins will provide top grade natural gas for a long time
First Q earnings on 4/28 Dividend announcement 5/12 payable 6/4 . Making dividend announcement for Q@ in front of earnings not usual and concerns me . I think we going to get chance to buy this top notch company much cheaper before that August 21st deadline .
I own CMI as a cheaper way in investing fuel cell technologies.
Anybody know why CMI keeps going DOWN
"Benjo, maybe you should go back to COHR and RH boards, the only calls that you are even remotely correct on and RH being one of your few long positions with Tesla, CMG, W and Net Flix. So you better stick with your few winners."
charging? refers? electric grid? How about this one - fuel tax loss to build the roads the trucks drive on????
Never saw CMI go up in the last 2 weeks all it’s doing is goin down. Can someone tell me when this dog gunna go up?
There is a rumor Cummins will be supplying Tesla with engines & drivetrains for their EV freight trucks.
"Keep sliding, need a nice entry point here."
Manipulated market. Buy more
"During this melt up If this can get above $194.18 Jan 29th 2018 high , Citigroup $200 target might be a magnet . Eventually this will correct ."
no news on a split?
"Bought a 1995 dodge 2500 new with 5.9 liter Cummins diesel. Used only full synthetic delvac mobil one 5w-40. Still running well today with 1,000,000plus miles. Also, original transmission and rear end; again using only synthetic oil in them as well. Log book tells the tale."
Pls don’t drop further. 
should cmi buy-out nkla?
152.15. I tried to tell you people
"Kevin, interesting concepts, I think he stays away from buying an airline, he may like to be invested in them, but I don't think he wants to run one. CMI actually could fit into his wheelhouse, yet he prefers to buy companies being offered at fire sale prices and right now we aren't in that category, though off more than ten percent off of our 52 week high."
"These markets are so manipulated and being controlled by computers which are being programmed to create these ridiculous swings, this stock has gone from being down almost eight dollars to rightfully being up by three dollars and really should be up more than that."
"eric, I will have to question whether you are ""more"" long than me with Cummins. First I own stock, not futures, so I am fully invested. Secondly, I don't make statements that resonant for with shorts than longs. I quote, CMI is helpless stock. DOW up 240 points last two days and this POS is up like $.40and that's after being down $21I understand frustration, but those statements are again not indicative of someone who is long the stock. Also that is a typical ploy of shorts, act like they are long and then flip-flop on there statements to imply that they either made a mistake buying a company or that something dramatic has changed and now the company isn't worth what the price is. Just sayin'."
Warren Buffet / Berkshire Hathaway have $128bl in cash to spend . What will it be this time an airline an engine maker he has rail . Maybe he picks off some of GE's low hanging fruit . What price would he have to pay if he wanted CMI ? He always buys fundamentals and quality and we fit in his world of ownership .
The market cannot hold a good company down too long
Dividend raise coming !!!!
You fellas need to think long-term. The yield is attractive and dividends are raised annually. The company has a strong balance sheet and sound financial performance. Buy the stock and call me back in 30 years...........
Great earnings
It’s a great company to work in. Great management and solid market share. Have quite a lot in natural gas and electric engines.

I bought this stock in the mid $80 right before Christmas and sold earlier this year in the mid $160's. I had thought about selling when it was hitting those highs and did not pull the trigger. I wish I had. I am not sure it get back to the $80's again but if gets around $100 I am back in and will ride it up again. Maybe next time I will have better timing when it comes time to sell.
Buy dips to 150.
Done dealhttps://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/08/29/1908614/0/en/Hydrogenics-Corporation-Shareholders-Approve-Transaction-With-Cummins-Inc.html
Unh crushed earnings and is now below where it was when it crushed earnings. Cummins on the other hand will miss big time mark my post I promise you. And yet it’s up daily. Backwards markets
Where are all the naysayers now?
Buy this dip
Well hopefully this latest earnings report will start the climb in stock price back up where it rightfully belongs...$175 ish

"The reason for the Hydrogenics. Purchase Can Hydrogen Trucks Kill Diesel Demand?By Irina Slav - Sep 19, 2019, 3:00 PM CDTHydrogen, once touted as the fuel of the future and then slipping into near oblivion as electric cars gained popularity, may still have a future as a fuel, just not for passenger cars. Hydrogen, it seems, could become the preferred fuel for a category of vehicles that currently account for a significant share of oil demand: long-haul trucks.S&P Global Platts Analytics recently made the case for hydrogen fuel as an economical replacement of diesel in semi trucks by arguing that it was potentially a cheaper alternative to both electric trucks and compressed natural gas vehicles.The author of the analysis, Zane McDonald, argued that hydrogen technology was the only one that could achieve price parity with diesel engines by 2030, not least thanks to help from the federal government, which has a comprehensive hydrogen program spanning everything from power generation to fuel cells.Right now, McDonald notes, no alternative to the diesel engine is competitive on cost or performance. Yet like its competitors, hydrogen technology for cars is developing. To be fair, so is diesel technology, with substantial fuel efficiency improvements expected in the next decade, up to 30 percent. Yet hydrogen is gaining prominence.German Bosch, for example, recently said it had invested in a hydrogen truck manufacturer—Nikola—and had started work on components for hydrogen powertrains. Bosch is the world’s largest supplier to the automotive industry and has stayed out of the hydrogen space until now. This makes the announcement all the more significant, boosting the credibility and potential of hydrogen fuel cell tech.If a single company, the largest in the industry, is not enough of an example, there are three large economies with ambitious hydrogen vehicle plans, too. China, Japan, and South Korea are all betting big on the fuel cell for the future."
I'm not sure how diesel engine sales will be but I know the CWI nat gas engines will be a blow out!anybody have a prediction for the # of CWI units sold in the 2nd qtr??? GLTA
Ouch
Wow those were some ugly numbers they just reported. Missed on top and bottom line.
I just want a positive close today in the green lol. Come on CMI
"Just sold 295 shares @ 258.64, bought 200 yesterday for $255.44 and 95 for $257.00Still holding 62 shares"
CMI has been hammered since the announcement by Tesla of the big semi truck with batteries! Must be some merit to the announcement! CMI Executive silent! Time to dump this POS. Actually time to exit the market. Makes no sense when CMI posted great earning and stock has been hammered.....Done with CMI
Cummins reached an all time high at 213.54
Likely to disappoint tomorrow and definitely lower guidance given the market and geopolitical environment.
"Hopefully, the positive earnings announcement will stop the slide. If investors are not appreciative of the company's stance on social issues, by all mean state your displeasure, divest, and move on. However, making unfounded accusations about or misrepresenting said stance is inappropriate and advocating for violence against employees because of the stance is abusive."
"I am surprised and pleased that this is not part of the warren buffet portfolio. It fits his criteria with good mgmt, well capitalized, and an industry leader. A gold star for management team at cummins, A+"
A blind rookie can read this chart. If you know how to use Fibonacci Retracement you will have the answer. Too valuable to trade here fundamentally and the bottom was tested this week. Next stop 150.Look for better than expected earnings and a 5% increase in the dividend is a tell.
The drop is possibly because the US doesnt look like the greatest place to invest in right now...
Looking good today. Don't have a position yet. Good time to buy here at $141? Or wait for a bit of a pullback being up $4 today?

Plug has nothing to do with Cummins. Use hydrogen fuel cells for fork trucks in factories and warehouses. Poor business model even with Amazon collaboration. Nothing that provides synergies to Cummins.
Trucking crucial crucial. CMI much needed to keep transportation moving.

"Wow, that is some downgrade, that is still nearly a ten percent gain if it does hit 180. That is some testament to what Goldman thinks the market will return next year, when a stock that will (according to them) will return slightly over 9% and that makes it a neutral or hold position. Really? What do they expect to downgrade any stock that doesn't have at least a 20% return (again, according to them)? That is insane. They are building in unrealistic expectations."
"I know people are desperate for dividends and CMI has been very consistent and great balance sheet but , 23.42 x forward earnings seems a little rich ."
What's a good entry point? This company is doing very well but it continues to go down and get thrown out with the bathwater. What would be a good entry point? $160?
"man o man this board is very LOOOOOW on comments. Thinking of buying CMI but why did it fall from 270 to 230 area in short time ??? Today in red even tho nasdeq is big green.

i think alison transmission is a better pick. engines can change but transmission stay same
It looks like CMI almost recovers all the loss due to Tesla announced the new truck. I believe the CMI price is around $170 before the announcement. It is a good decision to buy then.

"With a 45% DPS/EPS payout, I’d love to see a dividend increase."
Well this stock lost all its momentum it had gained in the move from 160 to 171. It has close below the 50 SMA 2 days in a row and the 10 SMA is turning flat. Macd may crossover and the Dow was up like 11 of 13 days.Let just say tomorrow will decide the direction of this stock for the next 5-10 days or basically the rest of 2017. A break and close below 167 tomorrow means another trip to 160

The market is Total BS. Companies reports good earnings and raise forecast and still get creamed. BS
They made dividend announcement early . Normally 10 to 15 days after earnings . Last year I think it was Aug 11th or 12th for holders around the 21st of AUG and payable first Sept . Didn't raise and announced earnings may be a red flag for earnings day .
In today on the dip. Lots of demand for Onan generators & NG engines! PT 300 by September. Good time to get in.
Interesting that there is no pre-market activity. That is rather unusual and the numbers were very nice.

I was on the sidelines with $TSLA stock seeing price targets all over... I am hanging my hat with the bulls on this new semi truck market... $CMI is screwed trying to catch up now to what $WMT is going to use going forward more than likely... HUGE play here highest recent PT was $500 with averages around $360 or so low way down at around $200 I believe ALL these need to be revised to give investors a real idea of what Tesla is worth going forward with this new announcement today.
"$TSLA puts out a new semi truck product, $CMI and others are worried now as they have entered their markets. $WMT preorders trucks to test, would $TGT $BBY and maybe even $AMZN doing the same?"

Why is Cummins in red today! Really doesn’t make sense! 
"Should have bought more while it was under 150. I think this is one of the most undervalued stocks right now. I bought this when I was in college back in '09 and should have held all the shares through today. Lesson learned, this is a lifelong position now"
when does the profit warning come from Cummins (CMI)?A lot will change before money is earned with hydrogen and fuel cell systems.Cummins is still big enough to tribe the question how much longer do shareholders have their doubts so there are price reductions.
"Oh look, it appears 160 might be the next target."

"I have been following CMI for years and its P/E ratio has always been around 12-14...today the stock price was 220.80 and its P/E ratio is about 19.6. That would mean if the P/E ratio today were 14, the stock price should be 158. Can someone please explain this to me or offer any insight???"
"So, very good earnings, good guidance, giving out big dividend, and stock barely budges. I tell ya, this market is just dumb sometimes!"

CMI holding up well because well run . This is the kind of company that Warren Buffet admires and that's not a bad thing either . The lower rates go and investors reach for a safe yield in shares of companies like CMI .
Does this stock ever have a good day? Very depressing!
The combustion engine will go the way of the Dodo.Cummins is shifting to take advantage of electrification. I am bullish on this trend and like a little company in Texas that has a patented revolutionary new bi-directional power switch for electric vehicles...IPWR...do your homework and I think you'll agree that it has HUGE potential.
Hydrogen is the future. Management here need to get acquainted with FC applications within the real market in order to foreseen the future.
"Right, I guess only Tesla knows anything about electric. being that's all they do - on a much much much smaller scale than everybody else in the business.

"Hydrogen fuel cells: why did Cummins put in an offer to purchase all the shares of Hydrogenics???My opinion is that they want to protect their future when Asia and Europe ban diesel fuel in favor of 0 emissions technology. In long haul trucks, trains buses and Marine applications.."
"I like CMI a lot but I hate it for those that bought at 180, no way this should stay there after that report. I'll buy more after it creeps back down to where it ought to be. Of course, ya never know, tomorrow it could go up 4% on nothing."
Anyone know why stock up so much today?

"COLUMBUS, Ind.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Hydrogenics Strengthens Cummins’ Fuel Cell Capabilities & Adds New Hydrogen Production TechnologiesCummins Inc. (CMI) today announced that it closed on the previously announced acquisition of fuel cell and hydrogen production technologies provider Hydrogenics Corporation.“We are thrilled to welcome the Hydrogenics employees to the Cummins family,” said Tom Linebarger, Chairman and CEO, Cummins Inc. “Hydrogenics is one of the world’s premier fuel cell and hydrogen production technologies providers and their expertise and innovative approach will strengthen Cummins’ fuel cell capabilities. This is another step forward as we continue to invest in a broad range of clean, fuel-efficient and high-performing products and technologies that deliver value to our customers.”Cummins began developing its fuel cell capabilities more than 20 years ago and the acquisition of Hydrogenics with Air Liquide’s support accelerates Cummins’ ability to further innovate and scale hydrogen fuel cell technologies across a range of commercial markets. Owning both fuel cell and hydrogen generation from electrolysis capabilities will enable the company to offer a full, differentiated hydrogen solution, from start to finish, seamlessly integrated for customers.""Air Liquide and Cummins have a shared vision of the key role that hydrogen plays in the energy transition. As a shareholder, and more widely as a company, Air Liquide is highly supportive of a hydrogen-based society,” said Pierre Etienne Franc, CEO, The Hydrogen Company. “The two global companies, leaders in their sector, have complementary expertise in the development of hydrogen energy. Thanks to Cummins’ investment, we believe Hydrogenics technologies will be able to accelerate significantly their development.""Hydrogenics will report under Cummins’ Electrified Power Business Segment, led by Thad Ewald, Vice President – Corporate Strategy, and its operations will continue to be headquartered in Mississauga, Canada. Founded in 2018, the Electrified Power business designs and manufactures fully electric and hybrid powertrain systems along with innovative components and subsystems to serve commercial markets as they adopt electrification. To date, the business has introduced complete electrified powertrain solutions in six markets across seven applications and continues to launch market leading products with customers across the world.The acquisition was completed for $15.00 per share, representing an enterprise value of approximately $290 million and follows the approval of Hydrogenics shareholders, the receipt of approvals from the Ontario Superior Court of Justice, and satisfaction of other customary closing conditions. Air Liquide will own approximately 19 percent of the company while Cummins maintains an approximately 81 percent ownership and will fully consolidate the entity in its financial statements. Hydrogenics will be delisted from the Toronto Stock Exchange and the NASDAQ upon receipt of the final required approvals.Cummins continues to project that the company will return 75 percent of operating cash flow to shareholders this year in the form of dividends and share repurchases."
"CMI was just downgraded by Goldman Sachs. Glad I sold the other day. Had a feeling this was going to happen. It just couldn't seem to gain any ground. Cummins (CAT, DE etc.) seems to be in a down turn. Not sure how long it will last, and didn't want to stick around to see. GLTA"
"Rough day but I just came across this. Was not aware Cummins had their own ""rollout"" of electric semi but not class 8.

Ouch! What’s happening here! 
I’m liking the long term view of this stock. Great company and tech for the upcoming green wave.
"Elon is the best salesman to come along to the business world since PT Barnum. If Wal-Mart actually had any realistic belief that he would ever design, produce, qualify and sell the proposed truck they would have placed an order much larger than 15 units. Elon is a snake oil salesman, look here, no look there, its a rabbit, no its a squirrel, no a dog. Well actually it is a dog, Tesla will be bankrupt by 2022."
CMI is down -4.92% to 170.21
"Buy at 150-160, not here. It will get back down there soon enough."
I can’t understand why there is no mention of CMI purchase of Hydrogenics. It is the future of clean mobility to replace diesel powered trucks trains and to some degree consumer cars.As well as the ability to provide power storage from renewable sourcesThey partnered with Alstrom and Air liquide to further the technology.
America is open for biz
"I'm not as sure as others here that a) there will be a big infra-structure push as early as next year (Jan.) and b) that if there was one that it would really benefit Cummins that much. I am more interested in some kind of push into the electrical grid, if that is what you are implying by infra-structure than yes it would definitely be beneficial."
Earnings and revenues beat the street expectations . Should go green if market stays green. Strong dividend . undervalued and oversold
This stock is whistling past he graveyard lol. No worries here. Class 8 orders have totally collapsed. Data coming on soft and yet Cummins up 5 the last two days. Funny market
"The miss was completely associated with Class 8 engines, not too much of a surprise given the recent general weakness in freight pricing, I think this is just an one off anomaly that corrects itself. The P/E for industrials is still very reasonable. Though there may be some longer term competition in the engine business as well as Paccar expands internal production and if the team up with Volkwagen continues to bear fruit for Navistar, they may need less Cummins engines as well, Volvo is also picking up market share as well as Daimler (Detroit Diesel). Overall, all truckers and fleet managers I have spoken with prefer the Cummins for the most part unless it is in the tanker business and they are adamant Mack fans."
dividend coming soon. China deal soon. Earnings very good and stock has moved up very nicely. I keep the 175 target.
CMI in my opinion is the safest and best way to participate in the coming “Blue Gas” revolution.

"Tesla does know how to design good looking transport, but their execution is horrible. I guess today is based on some investors euphoria on what the future would look like. The reality is that TSLA will not deliver again as all they have NEVER met their own goals. Doesnt that tell you something.Btw no testing has even been done with these semis, those companies bought a few trucks to see if they perform as Claimed. It’s only R&D"

"Hey Eric, where you at hack? It looks like 170 is in the near future."
Cummins better start getting into Batteries or they will become the KMART of engines
One of the reasons for the Hydrogenics purchase
I think CMI might have reached its upward limit and that a pullback may be possible. Ive been struggling with this stock lately. Some of my other trades have been from awesom-eSTOCKS which are working out pretty well.
Look at it go back to 150...yep
This is a deal right now. I like it.
Very simple thesis in a nut shell earnings growth

TSLA will go BK a long time before CMI noticed any competition.

Cummins raises dividend 7%. Very nice.
"CNBC - new IPO comming called Zikola (Teslas' first name), Hydrogen powered big trucks. Thoughts? Will CMI ply catch-up?"
Seems these tesla bs won't leave this stock alone. About every 2-3 weeks some meant is going to announce they are ordering tesla trucks. Whether those ever get delivered or prove beneficial won't matter. The market wants to believe the tesla bs
"eric, I trust this price assuming we close at or near here should give you some reason to be thankful. Definitely outperformed CAT today."
"Hydrogen energy – an exciting vision of the future By Rob Cockerill on Jul 15, 2019 FEATURETurn the clock back a decade, and a very different mindset existed where the idea of a hydrogen economy was concerned. It was certainly a shiny new concept, it promised a bold and brave new world away from the shackles of a fossil fuel-based society. It was a blue-chip dream for a world waking up to its need for green tech systems.Ten years ago, it felt as though the notion of a hydrogen economy was losing ground to the hybrid engines that were changing the face of the automotive sector. The intent was there, the best efforts of various multinationals was there, and the technology was fast-progressing – but there appeared a lag in wider confidence or conviction.Today, however, there is conviction and realisation. The time is now for a hydrogen economy which has moved far beyond its original aim or definition, with mobility now allied with power and the whole hydrogen supply chain in driving this forward. There exists a credence and a gravitas now in the hydrogen economy, it’s palpable, and that’s why it has accelerated so far beyond words and wishful thinking.We’re firmly moving beyond the chicken and egg conundrum that dogged hydrogen mobility for so long. Progress is in evidence. But where is the mass message about this transformation? Where is the hydrogen case being fought and won in the public domain? Part of the problem in the past has been the public perception when it comes to hydrogen as an energy vector. We now need to win over the masses and instil confidence and conviction.With the launch of H2 View, we have a dedicated hydrogen publication to press home this progression, to champion the challenges and opportunities it faces, and the exciting vision of the future.Our aim is to keep you at the forefront of the latest developments in hydrogen energy applications and technologies as they evolve, and we hope you’ll become stakeholders with us in this mission, as subscribers, advertisers, contributors and advocates of this clean technology revolution.Many believe in the role that hydrogen has to play in decarbonising major sectors of the economy and the future energy transition as a whole, such are its characteristics as a versatile, clean, and safe energy carrier.Hydrogen is versatile in its application; it can be used as fuel for power or mobility, or in industry as a feedstock, and can be combusted or used in fuel cells to generate heat and electricity. Hydrogen is also versatile in its production and supply; it can be produced from (renewable) electricity and from carbon-abated fossil fuels, and can be stored and transported at high energy density in liquid or gaseous form. And its end product is inherently clean; hydrogen produces zero emissions at the point of use.All of which means the hydrogen economy continues to evolve at a rapid rate and is fast gaining the credibility to match. Built around three core pillars of Mobility, Power and Technology that we believe underpin the expanding notion of a ‘hydrogen economy’, H2 View aims to enhance the visibility around these applications and solutions, and provide the platform for further discussion and debate.We will be an advocate for the important role of hydrogen technologies, and we will build the narrative around this important transition ABOUT THE AUTHOR Rob Cockerill, Managing Editor Rob Cockerill is the Managing Editor of H2 View. Rob has 12 years of experience from the gases/chemicals industry and heads up all editorial in his role as Managing Editor."
So why are we down? Comments please...
So the industrial earnings missed have nothing whatsoever to do with Cummins? Hmmm how convenient and how false. That’s ok the more Cummins goes up the more it has to fall when they report the miss
It takes only 60 minutes to bring down more than $5.00?
CMI is one of my best buy and hold stocks that I bought 6 years ago. Don't have to worry about loosing money on it . It usually gives me a 15% a year return .
Down 4% because of TSLA ? Really ? ........... We'll all be retired the day our highways only have electric semis.......like we have today 100% diesel....... TSLA cannot even produce the cars it promised..........leave alone any truck.
CMI is about a perfect Berkshire buy as one can hope to find in the industrial sector.
Down over $6 today.?? I don't see any news. Buying opportunity?
DIESEL!!
"Navistar got Volkswagen investment, perhaps a competitor to CMI being strengthened rather than the continued decline in Navistar's business"
BUY BUY BUY....PUMP IT UP NEVER SELL......
k is going back to $150+ very quickly. Strength in technicals ; coupled with value play. Easy gain the premiums on future calls already have it built in. Buy get a nice dividend and a capital gain. Better return than any bond for this year.
This is a strong opportunity and a nice dividend to boot.
"Ben, not sure of numbers, but do agree that the Nat. Gas market has been a definite bright spot, believe the diesels are going to show well also, the Class 6-8 truck market has definitely improved and the trucking sector is extremely hot, though with supply issues finding qualified CDL drivers I think many truck lines are limiting their buys for now. The CAT story yesterday has me a bit concerned though, great numbers, good guidance, up very nice early to only end down and starting down today as well. Not sure what caused that kind of activity but hope we don't repeat, of course I hope we repeat the good numbers though."
CMI is down -4.91% to 145.75
Anyone else see the note about CMI changing their bylaws? They are reducing ownership requirements from 25% to 10% for calling special meetings. Not sure what impact this would have since the most recent filings show only institutions approaching 10%-- unless someone has been buying a huge position between reporting periods that they know about.-Dan
Follow the clueshttps://www.google.com/amp/s/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKCN1UE1YU
if you find the Hydrogenics (HYGS) deal good then always go and buy as many Cummins (CMI) stocks as you can afford. small business big problems big business no problems.
Does Cummins have a plan for LNG/RNG engines. Sounds like diesel will be history
"PespiCo — An executive for the soda maker said PepsiCo has reserved 100 of Tesla's new Semi trucks, marking the largest pre-order of the vehicles to date. CMI goes down big."
Cummins truck end market is in shambles yet the stock and its manipulators don’t care about it. Buy buy buy buy
"The only thing holding this stock down is the fear and an irrational one at that of trade wars. This thing is a beast, all they do each and every quarter is surpass earnings and revenue estimates."
I bought in at $142 and feel better since this up-tick today. Up over 2%.
"If I was holding CMI from 5-18-2021 and still have CMI as of 5-20-2021, will I get the dividend?And what if I sell tomorrow?"
$CMI Upgraded by Jefferies Hold » Buy USD 325
should be infrastructure play
"Wooooowww, what a Blow Out Quarter: CMI reported adjusted earnings of $4.14 per share in second-quarter 2018, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.67!! Revenues also easily surpassed expectations. My short term CMI price target is now 150 bucks!!!"
"Bets on them tanking this tomorrow, three pretty decent days, that is just extremely odd for Cummins. Usually someone comes out to trash talk the industrials because of trade fears. May sell at end of day, don't trust this nice run."
Still sliding...
Everything melting up for next couple weeks before we get correction .
"Yet they keep pumping the technology sector, markets are so rigged right now, well actually all of the time. Worse market since 1929, for something that at current levels has killed 15,000 WORLDWIDE. We lose up to 52,000 people every year to the flu, will we start to do this every year now, or just when Trump is in the White House? This is the big money's last hooray, before the French are able to report on the wide spread use of HydroxoChloroquine and the Z pack, they are going to full scale use on people who are hospitalized. If the data holds out from the original three dozen patients that the French doctor treated, we should see major improvement by the end of the week, viral loading should approach zero for all who receive the drug by Sunday (six days after treatment begins)."
Calmer and wiser heads are seeing that an analyst got over his skis .Still a very good quarter year over year. Good dividend yield. I am buying this dip.
"The overall market has also turned negative, I believe a lot of traders of dumping (all stocks) to prepare for a long holiday weekend. Not too unusually. The Deere news did give us a nice bump though. I still say, 175 by end of year, maybe back to all time highs."
This an excellent time to begin a new investment on CMI. It is undervalued and pays a strong dividend. EPS and PE are solid for value. The time to buy is when there is blood in the streets. Be wise start with 33% of your standard purchase and ladder up gains of 2% BY 33% UNTIL FULL. The chart is looking good and the bottom appears to be in. Strong candle formation is forming.
"Cummins Inc. CMI recently closed the acquisition of Hydrogenics Corporation, a Canadian fuel cell and hydrogen production technology provider. Notably, Hydrogenics’ expertise and innovative approach will help strengthen Cummins’ fuel-cell capabilities.On Jun 28, the company entered into an agreement to acquire the outstanding shares of Hydrogenics for $15 per share in cash. The enterprise value of the deal totaled $290 million. Cummins owns 81% stake in Hydrogenics, while Air Liquide will keep 19%.Cummins started developing fuel-cell capabilities more than two decades ago. Further, the acquisition of Hydrogenics, with Air Liquide’s support, will boost its ability to further innovate hydrogen fuel-cell technologies across commercial markets. Moreover, the latest acquisition is in line with Cummins’ strategy to invest in a broader range of clean, fuel-efficient and high-performing products and technologies.In fact, the company will be able to offer a full, differentiated hydrogen solution to customers by retaining fuel cell and hydrogen generation from electrolysis capabilities.Hydrogenics will now report under Cummins’ Electrified Power Business Segment, which designs and manufactures full electric and hybrid powertrain systems, innovative components and subsystems for commercial markets.Cummins is focused on enhancing shareholder value through aggressive share repurchases and increasing its dividend payouts. For 2019, the company has set a target to return 75% of full-year operating cash flow to shareholders in forms of dividends and share repurchases. Cummins focuses on introducing innovative products and strategies, such as partnerships in order to deliver higher returns. Besides widening its product portfolio, the company signed separate partnership deals with Hyundai Construction and Isuzu Motors last October. It will jointly develop an electric-powered mini excavator with Hyundai. The Cummins-Isuzu Motors team will discover opportunities in the powertrain area. Further, it has joined forces with Russia’s KAMAZ to supply electrified power solutions for KAMAZ’s latest line of battery-powered vehicles."
Earnings + Dividend +China settlement + revenue gain = 175
"James, another false narrative, trucking is in a major recession. I would have you look at specific trucking stocks to disavow that statement, XPO which lost over half of its market cap when Amazon ended their final mile contract with them, they have completely regained those losses, without Amazon as a customer. Heartland, Saia, Werner, Landstar all doing very well. Of that 6,000 jobs that were lost, half of those were accounted for by the Celadon Group bankruptcy, half, Celadon went out of business not because of low shipments but rather management malfeasance, do a little research on the company and look up the names Eric Meeks, Paul Will and the CFO Peavley can't remember his first name. Also, the 6,000 jobs lost didn't account for the 20,000 created earlier in the year, actually if you add up all of the numbers for all twelve months, the gains far outway the declines. In most of the bankruptcies seen last year the problem was mismanagement as in the case of RRTS and dozens of other smaller carriers, though RRTS still is in business I believe. The other factor that people aren't addressing is the major shift away from truck lines doing LTL household deliveries going to Amazon and other contractors working for Amazon, these deliveries are being accomplished by Sprint vans and therefore not TRUCK drivers, just delivery people."
"Which of these stocks would be most benefited from fuel cell vehicle revaluation?. $PLUG , $BLDP , $BE , $CMI. Appreciate your inp"
On the way to $228 level.
This seem very strange. To continue downward after those earnings make no sense. This should be climbing back to the 250s.

"Funny how a stock bouncing off it's all time high is considered a dog. The company has solid fundamentals, gives clear (and usually conservative) guidance, and despite being cyclical, has an industry leading growth rate."
"Has leadership team of Cummins heard of PLUG POWER???....It will be a perfect addition for their future growth strategy as Diesel engines go on a downhill path, Hydrogen Fuel Cell maker like PLUG POWER will be a good mix for Cummins."
Have any of the analysts factored in the unbelievable shortage of truck drivers that is getting worse everyday as they age out and retire ? I know they make great trucks but don't they need someone to drive them?
Price targets raised....174 to 180. Smh
Looking good CMI
