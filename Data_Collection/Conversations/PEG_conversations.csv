"From $63 to $57, this is a big drop. Guru cited $30s or $40s possible. This is weird. If PEG is so overvalued, entire utility, also entire equity market is overvalued. Why single PEG out?"
"Good news, let's get that green back today!!https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pseg-1q-earnings-snapshot-115732585.html"
"Great, offshore windmills. That should be a real moneymaker! Sheesh!"
Any reason for PEG being down so much?
I would love to see stock split 2 for 1. go back to 30.00
"This is high for PEG, but I wouldn't leave it yet. Dividend coming in a week. A good management in place. As long as Izzo runs the show the company will be profitable and most probably increase div payout. When he retires, which could be in the next year or two then I'm not sure. Rumors are Mr LaRossa will be next in line and although a good company man, I don't know what his leadership will bring. Not saying to count him out, we 'll have to see. And now Dave Daly is in at PSE&G. Another good man...Price should be at 60-65 by end of year. With all the money the company is making they should increase their dividend. They have a lot of pending capital projects planned and should increase revenue and profit.One issue I see is that the company is getting very top heavy. Not in the President or VP ranks but a lot of Executive Sr Directors, Executive Directors and Directors. Lots of chiefs and not enough Indians to run the company. Lots of income going to these folks. High salaries I'm sure....."
earnings before the bell tomorrow .. not very promising day. better buckle up
"Increase in dividend!!! Going to $.45 from $.43, a 4.7% increase!!!"
What happens to the price of the stock and dividends if they are accused and found guilty of causing the fire in California?
Time to either split or raise the dividend
This is a all time high for pseg that means ever.
Its time for a >>>>
"Another all time high today!! Yeah!! Love this stock, inherited it from my Mom, God rest her soul!!"
PEG stock split history was 3for1 in 1987 and 2for1 in 2008. Is there any talk or possibilities of another split in near future?
Peg is a great solid company. I have owned 500 Share since 1974 and have collected divys for 44 years ith steady price appreciation. Good buy now at 54.53 with 60$ price target..........You see what its done for me in a very positive way. Now its your turn to benefit !!!!
divey payout day Dec 30.. yeah baby ! happy new year dennie.. lets get peg back to 60's and beyond for 2020...
Inherited a bunch of these shares so I've been watching daily fluctuations. For a utility it seems very volatile. What makes PEG so jumpy?
first time i bought this PEG in my account
BUY AND HOLD
$PEG Maintains BMO Capital Markets Market Perform USD 65 » USD 67 Maintains Wells Fargo Overweight USD 75 » USD 73 Target Lowered by Mizuho Securities Buy USD 67 » USD 66
All time high and still climbing! NICE!
"started a position in $PEG yesterday in the $$37 range. Can't believe how far it's fallen, this is 2014 prices! Park sit eat lunch go home, ain't going nowhere!!"
"Since 1988 I have seen PSEG grow and now as a retiree I used the dividends on traveling and would buy more if a split occurs! Own 2,644.129 shares and will add hundreds over the coming years.Lois"
latest write up. earnings expected to grow ..with the stay at home worker. environment now people use more gas and electric . so I think they beat .
Dividend Increased 6.2% or $.02 to $.49 per quarter Congratulations to all the longs.
why is this stock not splitting its share price is higher than the last time it split
Why is this down so much .
Stock Split...They can readily do a 3 for 2 stock split now but can't do a 2 for 1 split because they are a little short of the authorized shares that would needed.
"See ya at 45.33, the next support level. They paid too much for this company."
"Another new high closing, EPS beat by $.01 helped the increase"
"PEG is great!! With 2,644.129 shares and enjoying the dividend as a retiree I love it. Now I wish it would split.With $63.00 per share I would buy more on a split!Lois"
"Here's to a great Thursday! Electric cars hummmm, who's going to power all these plugin stations?"
PEG just.announced an INcrease in dividend of $.04 per quarter starting in first quarter of 2022. My question is the first quarter of 2022 in the next quarter report???
PEG closed above $60 for the first time and is up a little in the afternoon trading.
"I have dollar cost average this stock for at least 20 years. started at zero shares now have 1750. I have a basis point on this at 33. my broker wanted me to sell. I love the dividend, I like the management team here. don't know about a split, I think the company may have a restriction on number of shares allowed. After the merger with Exelon, they Board of Directors had to vote on an increase in allowable number of shares. Approved and a split happened. Very nice indeed.So don't look for a split to happen quickly, but I agree with oilup12345 it would be nice."
PEG is a no brainer. first stock my children own in there first portfolio. helped pay for college. direct purchase dollar cost average. money
started buying summer of 1990. by 94 had about 240 shares .. I was gonna sell em use the money to buy something .forget what . had the stock certificate issued and sent to me ..240 shares never sold them ..so couple months later called employee stock purchase plan said I want to put them back in the plan ..they said can't do that they will have to go in a desperate account . they couldn't go back in the plan .oh well so I sent certificate back and it went into separate account never sold 1 share those 240 shares have now compounded into 1300. plus shares in that account .. power of compounding is amazing .. and I continue to buy every week in the employee stock purchase program. today . in fact when see a rookie walking around I grab em and give him the info. paper work form I printed 30 of them keep them in my truck for the ESPP. so that they start young. buy at a 5% discount and get a 3% divey on top your making 8% right outta the gate . no brainer . god bless everyone keep compounding
"What am I missing here. Their selling the bulk of their plants. Who decides who becomes a customer of who? Who handles distribution? This sounds like a mess in the making. Same is occurring at SJI. It sounds like they don't want to be in the gas business, and want cow farts to create its supply."
Its a great dividend stock - Buy each month through employee share program. It is a bit overvalued at this point(not complaining) in all honesty as PSEG is moving towards a more expensive and risky renewable energy profile - partnering with OSW which faces a lot of regulatory challenges and faces revenue concerns over pending unfavorable proposed challenges to nuclear ZECs - which are essential to its profitability in that market. Recommend hold (unless you are buying at employee discount price 10%) - Expect a bit of a reversal back to mid upper 50's soon - then buy it.
Peg is Stagnant on a up day of 590 points. Need to drink some JAVA coffee<<<< Great company hopte for a stock split soon....
