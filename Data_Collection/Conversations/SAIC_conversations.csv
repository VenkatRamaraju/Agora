why is SAIC down by 6% after market with earnings reported to beat the estimates.
"Wondering if retirement of CEO is a sign of trouble with the Engility acquisition? I hope not, however we will find out when SAIC reports earnings on March 27....https://finance.yahoo.com/m/594c82e7-dab5-301e-b8e5-43557e48f4ba/saic-ceo-to-retire-at-end-of.html"
"Science Applications: Tough one; downgrading to Hold on valuation downside risk -- Stifel (78.12 -17.77)Analyst Joseph DeNardi noted, ""SAIC reported softer than expected F4Q21 results and provided FY22 guidance below expectations, continuing a trend seen across the industry over the past few months (except for KBR!). Interestingly, SAIC's sources of missed expectations were varyingly unique, being driven by lighter bookings at the end of FY21 (somewhat unique), a more meaningful impact from COVID (not unique), and a significant and surprising de-booking of backlog (unique). We need to better understand the nature of the de-booking and the degree to which margin and sales growth expectations have changed (messaging around both appeared more bearish to us). We rarely downgrade a stock on bad news but the confluence of factors against an already softish backdrop for the industry contributes to our more cautious view. Our revised $90 TP is based on shares trading at 12x FY22 EBITDA, vs. prior 13x, to reflect a softer outlook for sales growth and margin expansion."""
"Under $70 today with a forward PE under 10. Almost all tech stocks have been going up, and this one keeps going down. What’s going on?"
under the radar stock...will slowly move up to $100
no one here waiting for the EC ?
What a SUPERB earnings and sales report from SAIC yesterday afternoon!! Raised guidance big time as well!! Hot D_mn!!!
why it drop so much ?
Heading back up to $90 ??
"SAIC stock may continue to exhibit weakness due to the impact of the government shutdown also costs of theEngility Merger, If SAIC provides an upbeat earning report the stock will surge, else we may continue to see a short term weakness in the stock. However I think SAIC is a good long term investment. Good luck!"
Bought 85 April 16th $85 strike calls. Easy money
A lot to like out of the earnings report. Increased EBITA margins and raised 2022 guidance.
Oversold. Buy.
"Okay, here's the news thats fit to print: For fiscal 2022, SAIC expects to generate revenues in the range of $7.1-$7.3 billion, which is lower than analysts’ forecasts of $7.63 billion. Its adjusted earnings guidance range of $6-$6.25 per share also fell short of Street estimates of $7.21.So they missed earnings and revenue forecasts big time!! Took that info ran in and bought more shares at 81 and change, after re-buying just a few shares recently at 96 and change. As they say in the Bible: This too shall pass!!!"
Finally back over the 200 day average!! Chart looking healthy again!!
"THE SHARE PRICE COULD BE 1000,,,,,,"
I bought today at $80 on the revenue growth potential. The only thing that concerns me a bit is the large debt load at $2.6B. I hope that doesn’t increase.
"VERY Painful....I have 500 shares, so this was an expensive day. Did just double my position. I expected a selloff, but not this. Seems to me to be way overdone. At $6 EPS, this is cheap. And they seem to be conservative in their FY 2022 forecast. Time will tell. Good luck longs."
Science Applications is down 4.93% to 85.60
"Sep 3, 2021 - Candlestick shhoting star with following days reversal. Possibly portending a fall into the mid-70s. Never expecting a straight line decline."
