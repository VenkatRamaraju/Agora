"Peraton acquirer Perspecta with help from venture capital firm Veritas Capital.Both Peraton and Perspecta CEO were on the Veritas Capital board or affiliated with Veritas Capital.On Twitter an analyst that predicted the Peraton - Perspecta hook up also cited SAIC as a takeover target.Who would be the acquirer?Not Raytheon, busy merging with United Technologies. How about Boeing?Other acquirers might be to small to be the acquirer.Is SAIC CEO Nazzic Keene on the board or affiliated with Veritas Capital or any other venture capital firm?Meanwhile, Value Line has a 3 to 5 year target price of: $130 to $195.If bought out that might happen sooner than later."

"Science Applications: Tough one; downgrading to Hold on valuation downside risk -- Stifel (78.12 -17.77)Analyst Joseph DeNardi noted, ""SAIC reported softer than expected F4Q21 results and provided FY22 guidance below expectations, continuing a trend seen across the industry over the past few months (except for KBR!). Interestingly, SAIC's sources of missed expectations were varyingly unique, being driven by lighter bookings at the end of FY21 (somewhat unique), a more meaningful impact from COVID (not unique), and a significant and surprising de-booking of backlog (unique). We need to better understand the nature of the de-booking and the degree to which margin and sales growth expectations have changed (messaging around both appeared more bearish to us). We rarely downgrade a stock on bad news but the confluence of factors against an already softish backdrop for the industry contributes to our more cautious view. Our revised $90 TP is based on shares trading at 12x FY22 EBITDA, vs. prior 13x, to reflect a softer outlook for sales growth and margin expansion."""

"SAIC stock may continue to exhibit weakness due to the impact of the government shutdown also costs of theEngility Merger, If SAIC provides an upbeat earning report the stock will surge, else we may continue to see a short term weakness in the stock.

"Okay, here's the news thats fit to print: For fiscal 2022, SAIC expects to generate revenues in the range of $7.1-$7.3 billion, which is lower than analysts’ forecasts of $7.63 billion. Its adjusted earnings guidance range of $6-$6.25 per share also fell short of Street estimates of $7.21.So they missed earnings and revenue forecasts big time!! Took that info ran in and bought more shares at 81 and change, after re-buying just a few shares recently at 96 and change. As they say in the Bible: This too shall pass!!!"

Heading back up to $90 ??
I bought today at $80 on the revenue growth potential. The only thing that concerns me a bit is the large debt load at $2.6B. I hope that doesn’t increase.
I am hoping this goes up from here in coming weeks.What do you guys think?
They are merging with Engility which is a poor excuse for a company. TheCEO Chair will take over SAIC. SAIC shareholders are getting diluted. Prforma earnings going down 40%. This merger is a mistake and we are out.

"VERY Painful....I have 500 shares, so this was an expensive day. Did just double my position. I expected a selloff, but not this. Seems to me to be way overdone. At $6 EPS, this is cheap. And they seem to be conservative in their FY 2022 forecast. Time will tell. Good luck longs."
Science Applications is down 4.93% to 80.14
3rd purchase of 75000 stock at the end of trading day today. A major institutional investor has been buy SAIC during the last three days.
I wish there were capital punishment for the stock market manipulators that make a stock drop on record good news.
Am I missing something? This seems like a crazy over reaction.
"Just doubled my position...I don’t see how this doesn’t get over $100 after ER, especially given the nice contract wins for Q1 2021."
