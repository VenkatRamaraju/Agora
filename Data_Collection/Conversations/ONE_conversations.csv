GERN has got a drug that's going to have more than $ONE BILLION$ revenues every year for the next 10 years and that's just for MF and MDS. Wait till they get started with AML. Then you can double that money. You got $20 BILLION lock up in one drug. Any big pharm knows buying GERN at $10 BILLION is a huge 50% discount for a cutting edge drug. Buyout coming. Easy money. BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY!!!!!JMHO

As of today the NASDAQ gave them 6 months or they will be delisted unless they could remain over $1 a share I think with next quarters earnings in November at roughly 80% higher revenue estimates. they should naturally be around $2 to $4 range

"Could EDAP be valued at ONE BILLION DOLLAR ($1.0B) Market Cap this year, the answer is YES. I have been studying the market and the preposterous, ridiculous, and absurd valuations of so many bio-med companies, most of them valued at multiple $billions with products still in trials, negative EPS and no revenues to call for, it's all about future prospects even though in many instances these prospects are about 2-3 years to be materialized if so. In EDAP we have:1- Very fundamentally sound company, with enough cash on hand to continue commercialization of Focal one2- Very minimal to no debts3- Technology in HIFU/ Focal one is state of the art/ best in the market, superior to all other competitors4- Endometrioses trials, phase II (huge market), it wouldn't be long because HIFU is a proven technology to FDA, this is by itself is worth $ONE BILLION, 5- Revenues and EPS to increase exponentially in 2021 and beyond6- Low float/ number of shares available to be acquired by big investors/ institutionsThen what are we missing, in my opinion, nothing really fundamental, we are missing recognition by Wall Street large investors and Institutions, BTW, it started happening in EUROPE and I'm sure it will follow same very soon in the US"

"$MTEX holds much more upside then $TAL $EDU $GOTU $ONE or $DAOYes current shareholders have been beat terribly by the change in regulations but $MTEX didn’t take it lying down.Basically they added 200% more shares but got a big whack of cash. This will allow them to diversify into crypto and mining in Canada and USA as a hedge.What else were they supposed to do? The Chinese government Imperilled their entire education business. It wasn’t a failure of the company it was the enterprise factors around it. So they leveraged for cash and are putting forth another division in the west to do crypto, as a hedge.This is smart. The people who bought at .30 will probably holdA long time. Or even if they dumpFor a small profit, the market will absorb that like nothing. That’s one good day of high volume trading in a stock like this. Then the rise will begin. And who cares if they reverse split to reduce share price down the road the company will be financially healthy.This will roar soon"

Ok, the other positive is that it is holding above the last significant resistance preceding the break out. Other than that, this company needs some buyers to come back in to the market."

"UBER has 1.7 BILLION shares of common stock outstanding.At $100/share = $170 Billion Market CapitalizationAt $500/share = $850 Billion Market CapAt $600/share = $ONE+ TRILLION Market CapDo any of you realize that AAPL, AMZN, GOOG - NONE are valued at $ONE Trillion Market Cap, and they each have incredible revenues, incredible bottom-line profits, and incredible positive cash flows. So to those of you who believe this stock is going to $500-$1,000 per share, it's reality check time. You really do need to understand something about Shares Outstanding and Market Capitalization Valuation, EPS, and cash flows, before tossing out what the stock price should be for any stock you own or follow. The UBER analysts have price targets of $45 - $60 per share inside 12 months, which are rather high market caps for UBER, considering its Negative Cash Flow and Losses. But those valuations are at least somewhat reasonable based on Revenue growth, especially after witnessing the insanity of BYND. Long UBER. Good luck to all longs."

"Many people are seeking for stability in this unstable crypto space and A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now .
