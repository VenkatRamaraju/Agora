"Yesterday was a sucker gap up after three days up. Classic short setup. The only consolation bag holders can take away from today is that the stock is down on (so far) less than the ten day average volume of 1.2m, inflated by the last two days of 11m shares. Ok, the other positive is that it is holding above the last significant resistance preceding the break out. Other than that, this company needs some buyers to come back in to the market."

This is my post from yesterday morning —> bnb 40% stmx 35% profit.@Zero DD - only Reddit I’m patient but on coins with actual future potential such as $one $bnb $chr and $stmxDoge is a very bad long term investment. Only if Elon decides to accept doge to buy a tesla it may have a chance to go to $.50. To invest in it right now is just a stupid decision. Go make your money elsewhere and once some good news comes out go back to Doge. For now it just doesn’t make any sense for this to go up.

Education is the main priority in every Chinese family. This stock should not have been less than $2.5 at any point in time. It’s going up there slowly but surely.
As of today the NASDAQ gave them 6 months or they will be delisted unless they could remain over $1 a share I think with next quarters earnings in November at roughly 80% higher revenue estimates. they should naturally be around $2 to $4 range

"Without The Fed And Treasury Bailouts, Stocks Would Be Down 50-80%The US Treasury has unlimited credit. The Federal Reserve, infinite paper. No currency can match the dollar. Yet, from another all-time high in the S&P 500, the pinnacle of global power, the US has plunged into a depression of unknown duration.The president announced a ‘whole-of-government’ response. The Federal Reserve and Treasury implemented a breathtakingly unprecedented suite of monetary and fiscal programs, without which stocks would surely be down 50-80%.#One River Asset Management"

"$MTEX holds much more upside then $TAL $EDU $GOTU $ONE or $DAOYes current shareholders have been beat terribly by the change in regulations but $MTEX didn’t take it lying down.Basically they added 200% more shares but got a big whack of cash. This will allow them to diversify into crypto and mining in Canada and USA as a hedge.What else were they supposed to do? The Chinese government Imperilled their entire education business. It wasn’t a failure of the company it was the enterprise factors around it. So they leveraged for cash and are putting forth another division in the west to do crypto, as a hedge.This is smart. The people who bought at .30 will probably holdA long time. Or even if they dumpFor a small profit, the market will absorb that like nothing. That’s one good day of high volume trading in a stock like this. Then the rise will begin. And who cares if they reverse split to reduce share price down the road the company will be financially healthy.This will roar soon"

"UBER has 1.7 BILLION shares of common stock outstanding.At $100/share = $170 Billion Market CapitalizationAt $500/share = $850 Billion Market CapAt $600/share = $ONE+ TRILLION Market CapDo any of you realize that AAPL, AMZN, GOOG - NONE are valued at $ONE Trillion Market Cap, and they each have incredible revenues, incredible bottom-line profits, and incredible positive cash flows. So to those of you who believe this stock is going to $500-$1,000 per share, it's reality check time. You really do need to understand something about Shares Outstanding and Market Capitalization Valuation, EPS, and cash flows, before tossing out what the stock price should be for any stock you own or follow. The UBER analysts have price targets of $45 - $60 per share inside 12 months, which are rather high market caps for UBER, considering its Negative Cash Flow and Losses. But those valuations are at least somewhat reasonable based on Revenue growth, especially after witnessing the insanity of BYND. Long UBER. Good luck to all longs."

"Could EDAP be valued at ONE BILLION DOLLAR ($1.0B) Market Cap this year, the answer is YES. I have been studying the market and the preposterous, ridiculous, and absurd valuations of so many bio-med companies, most of them valued at multiple $billions with products still in trials, negative EPS and no revenues to call for, it's all about future prospects even though in many instances these prospects are about 2-3 years to be materialized if so. In EDAP we have:1- Very fundamentally sound company, with enough cash on hand to continue commercialization of Focal one2- Very minimal to no debts3- Technology in HIFU/ Focal one is state of the art/ best in the market, superior to all other competitors4- Endometrioses trials, phase II (huge market), it wouldn't be long because HIFU is a proven technology to FDA, this is by itself is worth $ONE BILLION, 5- Revenues and EPS to increase exponentially in 2021 and beyond6- Low float/ number of shares available to be acquired by big investors/ institutionsThen what are we missing, in my opinion, nothing really fundamental, we are missing recognition by Wall Street large investors and Institutions, BTW, it started happening in EUROPE and I'm sure it will follow same very soon in the US"
