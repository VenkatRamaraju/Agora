"Musk is scared that NKLA, will out sell Tesla in the sale of electric trucks.Elon has reason to worry, NKLA, a great company."
"This company has lost a lot of the founders original idea. This used to be a people company but no more. The management team at Monroe Ohio should be ousted. They have an Ops manager that twice has had to defend one of his hand picked managers from sexual harassment claims. Eventually both women who made the claims were removed. During the pandemic they released multiple long term employees.....loyalty means nothing to the group now running the show in Monroe. The EHS manager cares about nothing but his own promotion. He has let safety slide if it hinders production at all. He will not listen when employees tell him something is dangerous, he knows more than anyone. This comes from a guy who used to sleep in the lunchroom on midnights when he was in maintenance, and would brag about it. The HR manager is a two faced slime who backs his Ops manager regardless of what tripe falls from his lips. The attitude in Monroe is if you care yo wont last. Come in, head down, do job.....hope you dont anger an underling."

WOR owns 5.5% of NKLA. That stake is worth $1.2B today as NKLA is up 66%. Total Market Cap of WOR is only 2.2B. Why isn't WOR up more today?
Great way to get into Nikola deal is through WOR. I believe their public deal gets approved next week. Should see a big ripple here.
Is this still a buy/hold?
"Strangely, $WOR and $CNHI have yet to run in step with $NKLA, yet they own almost as much of the Nikola company. They will have to catch up soon."
"Not too happy with the large bonuses the executive leadership gave themselves.And, looks like other investors aren't either from how the stock price has been responding."
Owns over 5% of NKLA; NKLA manufactures electric trucks.Should another 2 billion to market cap.
What's crazy is $CNHI just disclosed they own 7.5% of Nikola Motors and $WOR disclosed they own 5.5%. $NKLA only owns 6.4% of Nikola Motors. People don't seem to understand this fact. It's on their website! People rushing into the wrong trade IMO!
"When will $nkla investors come to realize that $cnhi and $wor have essentially the same amount of Nikola Motors as the publicly traded NKLA. NKLA owns 6.4%, WOR owns 5.5% and CNHI owns 7%. BUT, the increase in valuation has yet to rip through WOR and CNHI. Strange, but true."
"WOR has just seen the last of the selling. Looks like a potential push higher is in store. Yo you should really check out awesom-eSTOCKS, they seem on point with their stocks."
"From Twitter: ""Strange, but true: Nikola Motors is owned by $NKLA 6.4%, $WOR 5.5% and $CNHI 7% , plus a bunch of privately held shares, such as 40% for CEO/founder. I wonder when people will understand this. It's on their website."""
"This is important. I suggest you consider the ownership stakes in Nikola Motors. Below is from their website. The key fact is $NKLA will own 6.4% of the company. But, from other press releases $WOR will own 5.5% and $CNHI 5%. So, while there is valid excitement for NKLA shares, possibly the better trade (or certainly one with less volatility is WOR and/or CNHI. Assuming no redemptions, current public VectoIQ shareholders will own approximately 6.4%, and VectoIQ sponsor shareholders will own approximately 1.9% of Nikola.Post-merger, existing Nikola shareholders will own approximately 77.1%, and PIPE investors will own approximately 14.6% of Nikola. ""Shareholder Group Number of Shares* % Ownership*Current public VectoIQ shareholders 23.0 million ~6.4%VectoIQ sponsor shareholders 6.6 million ~1.9%Existing Nikola shareholders 277.0 million ~77.1% (private)PIPE investors 52.5 million ~14.6% (private)Shares Outstanding** 359.1 million ~100%*Shares and percentages are approximate.**Shares outstanding do not include warrants or employee stock options."

"Am i missing something.... Couldn't you short NKLA and go long WOR for an arb trade? It seems like the Palm Pilot trade from the Dot Com era. If Worthington really has 19M shares, wouldn't that be worth about $1.5B right now and their total market cap is only about $2B. What am I missing?????"
"Something doesn't add up. If their $nkla investment is worth over $800 million (up like 25x) and the mkt cap of $wor barely moved. In fact, it's lower than it was 2 quarters ago. People aren't doing the math on this?"
What the actual?!They are epic earnings
I recommended a professional broker to you guys sometime ago can I get a person who invested with him?
