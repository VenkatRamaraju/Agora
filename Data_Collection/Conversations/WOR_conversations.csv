Dropping along with NKLA.
I recommended a professional broker to you guys sometime ago can I get a person who invested with him?
Well god damnit... here I am again! Why can’t I convince myself to sell when things are good!
Do these guys own Taylor Wharton? Anybody feeling the H2 play?

Great way to get into Nikola deal is through WOR. I believe their public deal gets approved next week. Should see a big ripple here.

"This is important. I suggest you consider the ownership stakes in Nikola Motors. Below is from their website. The key fact is $NKLA will own 6.4% of the company. But, from other press releases $WOR will own 5.5% and $CNHI 5%. So, while there is valid excitement for NKLA shares, possibly the better trade (or certainly one with less volatility is WOR and/or CNHI. Assuming no redemptions, current public VectoIQ shareholders will own approximately 6.4%, and VectoIQ sponsor shareholders will own approximately 1.9% of Nikola.Post-merger, existing Nikola shareholders will own approximately 77.1%, and PIPE investors will own approximately 14.6% of Nikola. ""Shareholder Group Number of Shares* % Ownership*Current public VectoIQ shareholders 23.0 million ~6.4%VectoIQ sponsor shareholders 6.6 million ~1.9%Existing Nikola shareholders 277.0 million ~77.1% (private)PIPE investors 52.5 million ~14.6% (private)Shares Outstanding** 359.1 million ~100%*Shares and percentages are approximate.**Shares outstanding do not include warrants or employee stock options."

"Am i missing something.... Couldn't you short NKLA and go long WOR for an arb trade? It seems like the Palm Pilot trade from the Dot Com era. If Worthington really has 19M shares, wouldn't that be worth about $1.5B right now and their total market cap is only about $2B. What am I missing?????"

"When will $nkla investors come to realize that $cnhi and $wor have essentially the same amount of Nikola Motors as the publicly traded NKLA. NKLA owns 6.4%, WOR owns 5.5% and CNHI owns 7%. BUT, the increase in valuation has yet to rip through WOR and CNHI. Strange, but true."
"Not too happy with the large bonuses the executive leadership gave themselves.And, looks like other investors aren't either from how the stock price has been responding."
"They can now/soon sell 7 million more shares in NKLA. This would leave them with 7 million shares. Combined with the June sale, this would give them about $500 million in cash. What should they do with the funds? Buy back shares? Eliminate their LTD? Make acquisitions?"
