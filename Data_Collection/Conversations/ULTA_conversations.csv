"Used to be an Ulta shopper, however, no longer. Their service is non existent...I like service. Also their hair salon and operators are substandard."
why did it tank ?not in this yet
"Collaboration and partnerships with Target and Google, along with projected growth. Great to see how headlines drive the price of a great business down so significantly, have to love an even better price to buy at. Company will win out long-term, some people have no patience."
Added at $362;12
"Seems to me the 'street' has it wrong on the claims made on Investor Day, Oct. 19. ULTA gets an A on execution, growth and vitality. With the change in CEOs, perhaps there is a learning issue in marketing the company and how institutions react. Yet to effect the bottom line is the outcome of new Target shops; it could be huge! This seems like a buying opportunity."
people will continue to buy cosmetics and scents....

"The price of this was lower less than 2 weeks ago when things were ""good"" with the company - hardly a reason for panic. (Although I like panic...)"
"Bald male Yahoo analyst gets haircut at ULTA, complains that his hair (singular) didn't look good."
This is way overdone for no reason. If you follow the company you know that Target Store sales and new facilities going up will keep ULTA as the premier beauty company. All this BS is shorts taking advantage of a nothing story. Sometimes it's best not to give the shorts ammunition. Given the current price I am adding to my position.
Let the Gamblers and ARTHRITIC HANDS leave then scoop up CHEAP!
Amazon announced a beauty event starting in October. I believe it’s an overreaction but it could take market share. Amazon typically doesn’t do well with premium customer bases so I’m not too worried. I will be looking to see what is offered during the event. If it’s cheap stuff like they usually push I think this is a non-event.
10k will make you 800 tomorrow.
"I have been following, trading and shopping in ULTA for many years. They began to offer many cruelty free brands before it was popular. The stock took a 10% hit yesterday. For me it's a great time to buy...and that's just what I did. ULTA long term."
What is happening??? Why down 4% in pre market??? :(
lookin' good AH at $367 from $363 close life is good $$$
You know the curious thing about this is ....If your NOT an END OF THE WEEK Options Gambler....The guidance is for low Double Digit Earnings! They earned 12.96 most recently and trade at a P/E of 29. The streets been OK with a 30-32 multiple on this stock for quite some time now. Then take into account 50 NEW STORES...The deals with Target & Google make this a Blip Like NON EVENT......AKA a Buying Opportunity!!!
beauty got dumped today cheap on sale price toward eod
"ULTA is a main target of all the ""Lift and Leave"" shoplifters who are brashly stealing without recourse from police. Until ULTA gets serious with security and local police gets serious about arrests this Theft Budget Loss Line will only increase.Nobody is stealing bread or milk, just high end merchandise. What a World we have become>"
Told you folks the fake pop was artificially pumped by market makers who planned to dump today one week ago!
