Thanks for the easy entry. Everyone hates retailers in November to create upside for December.
Mom’s/wife’s love their Target and Ulta (including mine). Smart partnership.
What's the deal w/the book value/share of this company? At less than $33#$%$ is a bit less than I would have expected from a co with a valuation of 19.5B. Then again it is valued at only 7B more than its' competitor COTY which has a per/sh price of $7.81 compared to $345.01/sh for ULTA. Can you say overvalued or am I missing something? TIA
"Where are the analysts upgrades.....come on supposed experts get with it. ULTA is one of the ultimate stocks for the re-opening trade. Make up and fragrances have huge pent up demand, and why the guidance was so strong. The ER results also indicates higher demand.........so wake up, and upgrades PLEASE.The high estimate is $456 or so, so meet it half way and $400 is reasonable.UPGRADE.......UPGRADE.......UPGRADE"
ULTA is up 4.94% to 291.92
ulta's business is recession proof....both men and women will eat value meals but they won't skim on makeup to look good.
I usually don’t post on this board but unclear of all the negativity / bashing at these price levels. This is still a well growing company overall. It’s not like they are in a dying business or something that is being threatened by a technology disruption. You may have a little short term pain but savvy investors will realize the opportunity down here.
I can't believe how negative this stock has been on nothing but positive news and opinions. The lawsuit is frivolous and should not take billions off the market cap.
"As a WOMAN and part of this target market I’ll explain why Amazon isn’t a threat to Ulta’s market share. I prefer shopping online, but when it comes to my hair, skin and overall beauty I NEED in-store. And let me stress that I buy most things online. Before Ulta I had to shlep it all the way to the mall just for my makeup and fragrance alone. Hair care products were purchased at the salon where my stylist recommended products to me. Now I can go to either of 2 Ulta locations within a 5 mile radius for any of these feminine staples (including services which are compellingly included in their loyalty program). Admittedly there are some DIY beauty products I may buy from Amazon or Sally’s, but high end products are something I need to see and test in person before buying for the first time. Even those items that I know and buy repeatedly, I am wary of the quality of on Amazon."
Analyst trying there hardest to push this down closer to 200 dollar range so they can buy low dirtiest trick in the book but hey it works cause the market always listens to the analyst and panic sells
Selloff tomorrow big time
I do not own ULTA currently. Good concept and a passionate CEO. They have pulled the weeds. I am a former Target executive and saw the deal announced. I was going to buy but watching Kramer last night it occurred to me that it may be a better deal for Target than ULTA. Has anyone reviewed store lists for crossover cannibalization to ULTA ? Why has it dropped two days in a row ? Target gets brands and some increased traffic and whatever their income share agreement is but what does ULTA get ? Increased outlets. What else ?
ULTA director Charles Heilbronn bought $58M worth of stock. This is huge!https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1259566/000156761919018892/xslF345X03/doc1.xml
"$ULTA Ulta Beauty, Inc. (ULTA)Total Debt (mrq) 1.88B$ULTA Ulta Beauty, Inc. (ULTA)Book Value Per Share (mrq) 33.49"
What's so disappointing about the release?
"$ULTA Ulta Beauty, Inc. (ULTA)Total Debt (mrq) 1.88B"
"It is not shocking that there are two upgrades by analysts. This is a CYA to by time to allow your institutional clients out of the stock. Missed earnings, revenues, store comps, suspend stock buy back, no guidance going forward, and a total unknowable situation with Covid 19. In addition, with many workers staying home, and economic devastation people are not worried about looking pretty to stay home and work. When the CEO talks about people buying because they will be doing ZOOM meetings - that is reaching deep for something positive to throw out. This stock could easily retest sub 190's over the summer."
How are the shorts at 200 doing ? Ulta just continues to rally even as the rest of the market sells off.Will be looking to see what happens between 265-285 but I easily see this running to 300+ looking longer term.
"I think it's selling the news, not about guidance. these Yahoo article always find a reason to justify the market action."
ULTA was downgraded today by an analyst.
"ULTA CHRISTMAS SALE, BUY TIME"
"After all of the positive news, Why ULTA is down today? Any comments. I am a newbie, so I am trying to get some idea from you guys."
Looks like no more posts for the shorts or bashers since market open. hahaha
"Beaten down stock trading at less than 20X next years estimates (even when factoring in AH increase) and growing at 10% per year plus share repurchases. Yes, please. Pretty optimistic about $285 soon. $400 will take some time (and improvement in fundamentals)."
"Missed on revenue, same store sales decreased year over year, and......the stock is up 18% in after hours so far....Got it."
Resistance @270If we move over you could see 300+ easy
Time for a big buy back by management at this range. Becoming oversold. Started a small new position at 229.
"Last time when ULTA hit around 227 then SPX was around 2750 when the recession fear was at the peak in 2018 Dec.Now SPX is around 2980 and we are seeing ULTA at the same panic levels of Dec 2018.Whenever ULTA falls huge it also recovered fast, see the charts if you don't believe, charts don't lie."
"I don't think it's short selling, I think some fund manager dumped a chunk today."
"Raymond James initiates with buy and an outperform rating, target $395. Yet ULTA is down, makes no sense. Lets STOP with this threat and fear mongering by this administration on continuing Covid and Variant scares and shutdowns.This is crazy to purposefully hurt people and economy for political gain."
"Folks keep saying it will reach $350. It was at $366 back in July. By July 2020 it will reach $400! Why you ask? Revenue is up, earnings are up, and the growth is still there. Last quarter was a HUGE buying opportunity, but don't lose out on today. This will surpass $400 by July 2020, especially as the Shorts run for cover. Do your research and understand this simple fact. Women love looking beautiful! You can't try on lipstick via Amazon. How about that new foundation? Maybe the latest perfume? Nope! This is why Ulta is here to stay. It is all about the experience. If you doubt me then ask a woman. I did, and the response was crystal clear. The answer every time was ""I love that place!"" It just reaffirmed my research."
ULTA is very cheap compared to EL and other competitors.
4-26Soon it will be May 2 and the end of the lawyer's advertising for lead clients for their failed lawsuits. Hooray!
"EL PE ratio is 34 and ULTA PE is 19, now you do the Math. 95% of shares are held by the institutions for a reason.ULTA will see 280-300 in the coming weeks, shorts overreacted during the last week and will now cover soon, before they get margin calls."
"I'm hanging onto this one no matter what the BEARS put out. Make-up is not going away and in the Facebook world, everyone wants to look fabulous."
"Wow. 6.6M unemployed just this week (double the estimate I had 2 days ago), and those are the ones who managed to actually file. It doesn't count the people who tried to file, but couldn't because the system was overloaded. ULTA is hanging in there admirably, but I can't see it hanging on to this price for very long. That's a good chunk of their customers who now have no expendable income."
Wasn't a big part of their success the total store experience ... offer services to get foot traffic and then they purchase products while in the store? The customers try new products while there in the store vs just reordering. This model seems challenged short term post COVID. Also their digital sales are still small % and if it just a reorder game they will lose to Amazon. Makeup usage is way down and while some businesses are opening up ... increased work at home is going to be prevalent short term and will be a greater % of work time long run. Many folks use less makeup when working from home vs. if they plan to go to work. I don't think they will return quickly to the same value and growth rate if ever. I don't see the same profitability/growth without pivoting or refining their current business model. This is no different than a large % of U.S. businesses will be facing.
Cramer loved this stock until price went down. I am a buyer at this level. Downgraded earnings growth rate is still more than 10%.
"1.7B of selling cosmetics and providing beauty services is itself mindboggling. We will back above 300, don't lose your hope and don't sell your shares cheap to institutions."
Need two good days in a row. If that happens it will shoot higher. $240 tomorrow?
Not selling below 300!
wow.. at 199 this is a huge buy buy buy and put away for a month..
Shorting with both hands
I love this stock. Personally used their online services during the height of the Pandemic. Saw what a great company they are and decided to invest in them. Bought at $227 a year ago and just sat back and watched it go up and up. I tend to invest for the long term and in this case it was definitely the right decision. Plenty more room for growth here.
A fully priced business
AH at least 250s
Heading to $230
should I sell it or wait?
There couldn't be a worse time to report positive earnings.
Wouldn’t want to be short going into monday
"Going into earnings $40 off its highs and it was selling even when the market turned up today. For once I'm seeing it sell hard into earnings. Did something leak? For years I have done very well buying into earnings. This time seems different, even with the markets near all-time highs. It should be running like SHOP, MELI and ROKU but it's tired and losing steam with earnings only 2 days out."
qq- Why Company is not buying back the stock ? They are at the best price ever they can get .
"I understand the analysts views, but here is my simple question. When the stock hit $366 why did their price targets sit in that range? Not one analyst had a price target of $235, which is where I bought in knowing the huge overreaction was a buying opportunity. My point is the analysts merely follow the price swings and adjust to Mr. Market. Revenue is up. Earnings are up. 4th quarter is always the strongest. Look at the charts. Simply stated, it will reach $366+ next year and the analysts will simply follow our lead. Be bold, invest in solid management, and go long. This stock will reach $400 next year which is a mere 10% increase over the $366 seen back in July. Revenue and earnings will be up 10%+ and they are still doing massive share buybacks. All the pieces are in place, so I will trust my research over the analysts any day of the week. Long and strong!! See you at $400!!!"
Ulta should consider stock split
"Am I the only one who thinks Amazon could buy ULTA for similar reasons they bought Whole Foods? Consumers often prefer to see, smell, touch and sample cosmetics at a physical store - just like food. Amazon bought Whole Foods 2 years ago for $13.7B which is about ULTA's market cap, and ULTA's net income is significantly higher than Whole Foods back in 2017."
Bought bunch at 202. Thanks Flynn
Why should ppl go to ULTA when Sephora is everywhere? Everyone just needs the best one for both skincare and makeup products! All top brands go Sephora! Low quality brands go ULTA! This is not a secret now!
Peter people don't stop buying make up...!
"During the third quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company repurchased 529,404 shares of its common stock at a cost of $128.6 million. During the first nine months of fiscal 2019, the Company repurchased 1,639,438 shares of its common stock at a cost of $506.9 million. As of November 2, 2019, $388.8 million remained available under the $875.0 million share repurchase program announced in March 2019."
"ULTA is just such a well run company I cannot understand how anyone would be bearish on it. It is a steal at this price.Think about it, they have compounded revenue at 20% for 15 years in an almost linear fashion. They have done this basically using no debt, who else can you find growing this fast with no debt? They have increased gross margin and operating margin every year since 2003.They had no slow down during the 2008 recession. And they did this in retail brick and mortar, one of the worst performing industries in the past years.The company is just too strong to have outside factors effect it, any negatives in the industry will hurt their competitors more then Ulta just giving Ulta more business."
"dropped my wife off at ULTA this past weekend, she said it was so busy it was like they were giving stuff away"
"I guess the street wants to make investors feel these numbers are bad, but in reality they are not bad and are good for the environment that we are in."
"Ulta is going to have a big day soon, this feels very undervalued right now. Good P/e and forward P/e, good sales growth and balance sheet, no debt, well positioned in the industry."
Big congrats to longs. We earned this moment.
"Bought the dip, im in for long!"
"shorts if you haven't covered, today would be the day. only up from here."
Each store has about $6M in annual sales. With 80 more set to open revenue jumps from $7.4B to roughly $7.9B. My point here is growth is not dependent on in-store sales growth. When in-store sales jump from 3% to 6% it will be the cherry on top!
"Release Your Inner Algo visit our live education stream & on demand Youtube, Reddit, Twitter."
The pop is because CNBC chartist said that ulta tomorrow earnings will pop up 15.00
This stock has continued to go up despite recent market turmoil. It was at $200 in April and now is at a 52 week high. Same store sales growth has continued to be good.
I guess the ladies spent money on Lulu yoga outfits instead of makeup
I'm glad I didnt sell when the earnings were released... mkt is Forward Looking after all
Be careful when trading ULTADOW up 4 days straight and over 1000 points from low 25000
Congratulations Ulta longs ! I considered buying a call yesterday but they’re so expensive .. and now I regret it !
They posted news about some stores recycling used cosmetics back as new. Thats why we're down.
BOOM!!
"I think ULTA is worth around 38 Times Earnings. As the largest retailer in the US, ULTA only has 4 percent of the market. The upside potential is incredible. I am a buyer."
Bought more
I would not be shorting this stock going into Q4.
The real beauty here is revenue growth was accomplished while maintaining massive profits! I give management credit for an incredible job! Soon the share price will reflect the value as well.
Nice AM action. Take some profits here ! Thank you.
"I sat outside an ULTA for two hours on Sunday. While Best Buy, and even, Bed Bath and Beyond were busy, Ulta only had three customers go in in two hours. How is this stock trading at almost $300?"
"Ulta has a lot of potential lately, very good strategy to buy now imo!"
I nailed this one yesterday up 10 percent in a little over 24 hours
I go to the store with my wife. Always good customer flow.
ULTA nice gain today (1.87%) on improved (but below average) volume when the market was down. Still in the 228 - 255 trading range but a possible game changing event coming in the next month.Stay posted.
"If you’re a day trader, you should definitely check out (http://Fairstox.com). They send a watchlist covering the top pre-market movers every day before the open. It’s a great way to pick out potential trades for the day."
UlTA might be a lil volatile but it has been the healthiest stock ever. safe place to invest 
very low volume today around 33% of typical average volume. Good sign very few selling down here.
What are the details on the Raymond James upgrade?
"A few more hours to the ER after market close. Retailers has been strong this quarter, expect ULTA to also be strong. Back to work and going out under the re-opening of our cities, pent up demand is here.So get that lipstick on, those nails polished, smell good and get out on the town to celebrate ULTA windfall for us patient shareholders. Lets get back to $340 in AH and run to $350-$360 soon after."
Sorry to be negative but who buys these expensive products when you can go to bargain store like Walmart and others to buy cosmetics? ??
"is anyone else confused about the misleading earnings news? missed consensus esp by .02 or .03? revenue up 23%, but completely in line with estimates? Q1 net sales guidance is either lagging, in-line or guided below consensus? 2.43 v 2.66 estimates on 1.51 B v 1.52 B expected...can someone cut through the noise?"
I feel sorry for all the experts that sold today. (not)
"Should it be easier now for Ulta to at least meet earnings this quarter since they have already adjusted down, $2.14? Earnings Whisper $2.17. The bad news already priced in the current price. I am just saying that stocks I have owned in the past that have taken hit most of the time at least met their next quarter numbers."
Took my daughter to ULTA on Thanksgiving. Store salesperson told her they sold out of the Lip Kits within 30 minutes! The store was packed. Target is close by and was also packed. Hope this is the start of good news for retailers this season.
"So they missed their guidance by $100million, and the stock decline removes $1.2 billion in market cap. This is an overreaction and $250 or so is a great time to buy back in"
This company is overvalued when looking at the P.E…. It may continue accretion until after earnings. Shorting before earnings will be a very intriguing position.
"nice move today, wonder why"
"Asked my Dental Hygenist. She was excited to explain to me why she only goes to Ulta and that she does not buy makeup on Anazon because you have to see the colors on your skin and she can't buy the same products as Walmart, Target, and CVS. she loves the free samples and usually spends 100.00 every time she goes. And she doesn't wear much makeup."
Serious investors should watch Episode 1 of Broken on Netflix! The counterfeit cosmetics are all sold online and primarily Amazon. Eye opening documentary and clearly shows why Ulta is here to stay. Must see TV!!
I'm ready for $400
"Share price drops, share buyback goes up, and now we rocket to $300. Those that doubt the CEO are not doing their research. She plays to win!!"
Repeat after me : I will never buy another stock before earnings that has run up !!!
"Bought shares of Ulta 2 days ago. Since it is in Target or have a deal , this was a brilliant move. Many plastic surgeons in Boston are doing expensive facial procedures. They are booked solid. People want to look good. Good for the beauty industry."
Is anyone on this board...very quiet
positive run in the works .....Xmas sales will be huge
https://investorplace.com/2020/04/5-retail-stocks-sell-stores-remain-closed/
2013 levels. 7 years of share price evaporated. Just wow
Wife and daughter went to one of the stores they say it was very crowded and a lot of stuff was sold out and this was on December 26.
Way overbought
"no more sellers shorts covering going into predicted strong holiday season, KKW press release alone in teh next week or so will drive this into the 240's"
Sold for a quick 20 percent profit. Thanks for coming
rebounding from 52-week low stock action looks very strong
"I concur. ulta and lulu are a ladie's best friend. I should know cause I'm a lady! Don't own any retail stocks except these two. Only regret is I didn't buy more ulta, have only 25 shares but plan on buying on dips."
Major trend line resistance at $413.80 this thing is notorious for gaining prior to reporting then selling off after killer earnings. Great time to short right now. Safest bet to cover back at $390 or could hold it longer and I would bet we make it back down to the MEAN trend line price which right above $360
"Tax bill passed ULTA tax bill just dropped from 38% to 20%, cash flow just increased dramatically and likely stock buybacks."
"A five cent beat does not equal the insane after hours pricing we are seeing now. While I love this company it is IMHO going to get crushed tomorrow and give back all the after hours gains plus another $10 to $20. here is how it works. The accountants and so many more people already knew what the beat was. Their friends front ran the news and that's why you have the age old and accurate saying ""buy the rumor sell the news"". It happens to all companies. Watch and learn. This after hours gain will evaporate quickly and probably tomorrow it closes in the $290's. Nothing unusual here, it happens all the time."
"Too soon to buy, especially before the weekend. Interesting that all the Kylie Cosmetics hype couldn't save the quarter."
"Nice reversal 10 minutes before the earning. Regardless of the outcome of the earning, this definitely is a good long term retail play."
"The fiscal second quarter wasn't bad. In fact, revenue rose at about the same pace as in previous quarters, with rising customer traffic supporting a 6% increase in comparable-store sales. The expanding store base allowed overall sales to rise 12% compared to 13% last quarter. Profitability was also healthy, with gross profit margin ticking up to 36.4% of sales from 36% a year ago.ULTA has been doubler almost every year since 2012. And always seems to ""reset"" in the summer for even better buying opportunities. 6% sales growth instead of 7%. Steady profit. And trading at peg ratio of 1.6. All without LTDebt. Wake up Warren from his nap. This is clearly on BRKA buy screen."
Likely 20-40 downside risk with 100+ upside. I'll take that bet. They will either thrive or be bought out in 1-2 years.
"Can’t wait to tomorrow earnings, predict a good 20-25 point drop in the stock. Buying in my Put contracts tomorrow, Easy Money!!!"
Jan. 7 Ulta is up about $15.00; is this because of Lady Gaga's planned line of makeup products?
I believe the ominous Target retail report is hurting this stock today. Not much correlation but I think it’s the driver
"Not sure where to get off, would like to see a squeeze up to $215"
ULTA is down -4.92% to 207.80
"Last earnings December 8, Ulta went from $306 to $229 in a month on a slight miss."
Increased price target today by Telsey Advisory Group to $475. More to follow with increased rev projections and continued strength into the holiday season.
"$ULTA opening 40 new stores in 2021, per ER call. Expansion = More Revenue = More Profits. I bought at 315.Keep buying. Keep holding."
Credit Suisse Group initiated coverage on shares of Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA). The firm issued an outperform rating and a $245.00 price target. Also said ULTA’s valuation is an eye-watering outlier when compared with 53 other retail stocks.
Feels like this thing is going to switch levels very soon.
going above $380 by EOD
"Never heard of this company until a buddy told me about it .Got in at 239, Wish I would've bought a lot more"
TGT stores also create many head winds for ULTA! Higher return rates and lower margin!
"Using the new numbers, I value ULTA at $257.50"
Bottom in above 209 and shorts get squeezed Tax cut is if plus here as there rate is 37%2nd half of 2018 will see margins start to turn up again. Market anticipates this 6 to 9 months before
"Now that it's going up, it's an awesome opportunity to short. I just loaded up on put options! Earning are right around the corner....May 28th will be a bloodbath....plus there is the extra projected cost of doing business....masks, distance, taking customers one at a time...disinfecting...etc.....it will certainly hurt the bottom line! I can't wait until May 28th....I can smell the sweet money!"
"I like ULTA because my girlfriend is a frequent online shopper. I started shopping at ULTA when I realized the prices for men's products were the same or better than Amazon. ULTA also has frequent promotions for discounts and free samples and products which make it even a better value than Amazon. ULTA seems to have loyal customers. The customers that purchase at ULTA would not buy at Walmart or Target in my opinion. Nevertheless, I do not own the stock yet. Trying to figure out why retailers like LULU are hitting new highs but ULTA is down almost 40%. I almost bought yesterday at 205.49. I will pull the trigger when the time is right."
"Told you there's no correction. It was manipulated opportunity. Otherwise, all of these stocks would've stayed at the bottoms they hit. Today's gains:$NIO up 11% $NNDM up 18%$XPEV up 14%$PLUG up 12%$RBLX up 7% today (I bought for 64.50 and holding)A new one I've added after market is $ULTA. This is way oversold and getting an overreaction from the ER just released. This has a gap up to 350+. Right now it's under 315 and, so lots of upside. With services opening up in the next 3-6 months with more vaccines being administred, ULTA will come back very strong. Consider investing and go long. Highly recommend.Hopefully you bought the rest of stocks I've mentioned below the levels I gave you over the past few days. See previous posts. Longs still ahead. Keep buying. Keep holding."

"its so flat today, I guess it will be skyrocket next week since its already oversold"
or Amazon does to Ulta what it does to all it's other competitors and Ulta trades back to $50 bucks. If there were talks of a sale do you think management would have just sold a quarter of billion dollars or so at prices below where it is now?
"Should ULTA acquire SKIN?I bought more Ulta today,and added to my SKIN position too."
and we are here as been saying the right level for ULTA is $340. Strong guidance should propel us to $360 near the old highs. Tomorrow easy $20 plus jump based on the AH moves.
"I don't like catching falling knives, but I'll try to catch this one. I'm in at $243 for 500 shares."
"Isn’t Estée Lauder better for the price? Why pay > $220 for Ulta? Asking truthfully, looking for a position"
Never underestimate the capacity of women to spend money.
I have never seen a stock going down $100 !!!!!! a share in 1 day. wow!!!Guess everything is possible in the stock market...
Guys this stock range is from 220 to 350 .. So this was a big one drop and now turn to gain some momentum back to 290.
anyone care to give an opinion on what the price will do over the next several days?
Kylie upward guidance will send this stock into a frenzy! Expect a big movement tomorrow.
Time to buy
Based on my projection ULTA should be able to take around 6% of market share by 2025 in the beauty realm. If thats the case then this company should be worth around 30-45 billion by then. which gives up a 700+ stock price. international expansion will be key starting with canada.
"Expect movement going into earnings... any good news and $280+.... low number of shares and float allows big movement in the share price.6% shares short of float, so could be interesting."
Cowan raised target up to $490 today!

people will continue to buy makeup and want to smell good....!
"Amazon also knocked off West Elm furniture lines when they introduced their own private label furniture lines Revit and Stone and Beam. The knock offs, didn't even come close to carrying the same look or quality, though WSM did sue them. The only positive review for the Revit or Stone and Beam lines came from Business Insider, their Insider Picks section claimed how well the products were and that they were very comparable to CB2 and West Elm items. Then when you read the disclaimer at the bottom of the article you see that Business Insider gets a commission for any sales generated from the article. It is called Affiliate Marketing. Companies or businesses to include magazines which do reviews (yes, possibly even something like Consumer Reports) will link your account with cookies or tracking URLs. If someone then goes on to the ""advertised"" products website and buys something the reviewer gets credit based on sales price and written contract. Usually bloggers now all do it as their primary source of revenue. It makes you really question the authenticity of ""independent"" reviews. Actually sales improved for both RH and WSM after Amazon introduced their private label brands. It also pushes the federal government closer to taking action against Amazon as having monopolistic powers."
check out the stores. there are women young and old. I love the stores!
Company need to do damage control and announce stock buy back ASAP.
"I am reasonably certain that Ulta will most likely end higher - tomorrow. This trend of afterhour selling at low volume had occurred in previous two earnings release as well. Despite good results , stock gets pounded triggered by confusing articles -possibly influenced by short sellers. But ULTA comes back with vengeance the next day.CEO sounded very confident - “The Ulta Beauty team delivered a strong performance in the second quarter, reflecting rapid growth in prestige boutique brands, mass cosmetics, skin care and fragrance, offset by continued moderation in the growth rates of a few of our large color cosmetics brands,” said Mary Dillon, chief executive officer. “Our flexible business model continues to support healthy retail comps, excellent new store productivity, and high growth for Ulta.com, resulting in significant market share gains across categories.”Company has solid growth plan for 2018 - including opening 100 new stores: ""For fiscal 2018, the Company plans to: increase total sales in the low teens percentage range; achieve comparable sales growth of approximately 6% to 8%; grow e-commerce sales in the 40% range; open approximately 100 new stores and execute 15 remodel or relocation projects; deleverage operating profit margin rate in the range of 50 to 70 basis points; deliver diluted earnings per share growth in the low twenties percentage range, including the impact of approximately $500 million in share repurchases and assuming a 24% effective tax rate; and incur capital expenditures of $375 million in fiscal 2018, compared to fiscal 2017 capital expenditures of $441 million""."
Oh yea snowflake pops $15 today after yesterday’s earnings but not ulta? You kidding me
cash flow doesn't end with earnings report...people will continue buying cosmetics and scents...!
"CFRA MAINTAINS BUY OPINION ON SHARES OF ULTA BEAUTY, INC.12:22 pm ET June 24, 2019 (CFRA) PrintAmazon launched Professional Beauty Store, according to a June 24 blog post by Steve Kann, Director at Amazon Business. The store offers professional stylist supplies usually found in spas & salons. Despite AMZN's growing penetration (Fast Beauty and Find), we don't see AMZN giving the industry a makeover anytime soon. According to CFRA, AMZN's Share of Voice in ""skincare"" stands at 0.7%, compared to ULTA's 7.7%. AMZN's ""makeup"" Share of Voice stands at 1.6%, compared to ULTA's 15.2%. Share of Voice by Alexa Internet is percentage of searches for a keyword in search engines that sent organic traffic to site. We keep our 12-month ULTA target at $390, 30.2x our FY 20 estimate of $12.91, above ULTA's three-year historical forward P/E average, reflecting its impressive ability to drive exclusivity and newness by forming partnerships with key influencers and investments to drive the next frontier of loyalty (personalization and customization), which we think make ULTA 'Amazon-proof'."

The only hope now is to be acquired
Bagys jumping off buildings faster than you can count today. SPLAT! hahaha I love it
It’ll continue rising with TGT together next week!
Get the ULTA app. Go to sale items. Sort by most popular. Compare prices to AMZN.
87 million of insider buy on open market.
I still value ULTA at $287.
So is this a buy ? Or should I wait for it go more down?
Michael has the right idea...
So stock runs up - newbies put stop loss orders - algo computers takes them all out. It’s just that simple - watching trades 3 - 4-1 - 25 shares etc - those are retail
Ulta said it lost $1.39 a share from revenue of $1.17 billion in its fiscal first quarter. Analysts’ financial models had pointed to 67 cents in earnings per share and revenue of $1.27 billion. This is pretty bad
"Can we have the ladies comment please, what do you think about Ulta? Is this fall justified?"
"Ulta is now in a crowded industry. Every Tom, #$%$ and Harry is selling their make up brand nowadays. Youtube is full of sellers. Yahoo advertisers for make up sales are aplenty. My daughter was once a huge Ulta fan. Now she buys online from some YouTube business. Free 2 day shipping and no sales tax. How can Ulta compete with them?"

"This is a ""reopening"" stock. As long as reopening looks possible ULTA will succeed. As long as reopening looks unlikely, it probably will drop in value"
Looks like a solid consolidation after the spike doesn't want to go below 237. Very healthy!
Perfect... my guess to buy some puts on this overvalued company is paying off. Should be under $200 and that is being generous.
Just bought 11 shares for earnings gain. Opinions...
anyone know what is going on? why is it tanking? i was going to buy some more put options because i thought it would tank during earnings in a few weeks.

"Based on the daily moves, do you think we will see green soon? It does not seem to be oversold yet and it seems the only reason for the last week jump was the insider buy and now we are heading south again. With no news, do you think it will go up again?Thanks in advance for sharing your opinion"
98% traders lose money cause lack of patience. Stock don't make U turn just like that. I would wait until $360 and $365 area.
Sales will not drop.. Women love ULTA.. my girlfriend is there twice a month at-least.. always busy in that store. Her and all her friends buy a ton in there ..
this will be big time green tomorrow
Any guesses on beauty industry consolidation. Will Amazon or Walmart buy Ulta?
"ulta will do well, target initiative was smart, people buy makeup, stimulus boosts.."
"If this goes back under $240 I’m buying more, or maybe some calls. This was over $360 4 months ago and will return."
"BAFFLING, why this dropped today. This should be at least $350 based on ER and guidance, retail sales are going up as people heading back to the office and going out. Personal care products, fragrances and make-up are all beneficiaries of the post Covid trade."
$240 in 2 weeks
Always a bad idea to bet against the CEO! She knows it is undervalued.
why did it tank ?not in this yet
When amazon wanted to get into food they bought while foods for 13 billion. Now they are trying to get into makeup and the disrupter in the market is ULTA which consitdebtely has a market cap of 13 B. Is a buyout from amazon far fetched ?
"After earnings I thought we’d get up to $285 and we are now close. The 200-day is in the mid 290s without a clear near-term catalyst to breach it. $285-$290 may be good opportunity to pocket some gains if we don’t breach the declining 200-day. If we do breach, I’d expect a climb to the $320s before earnings. Good luck to all."
Why the drop today?
going to 600!
"Goldman Sachs upgrades ULTA with a price target from $399 t0 $437. GS cited realized strong growth in Bath and Fragrances, and now see's cosmetics coming on strong in each category: eye, lipstick etc. I would expect price action back to over $360 leading into ER, and if these numbers from GS beauty trackers holds true in ER, ULTA will start approaching $400. Unfortunately we have to wait until EOM for the ER."
Have been eyeing this stock for awhile but not purchased any shares as yet. Any long term holders of this stock have opinions on a good entry price? Thanks in advance.
ULTA will fall 10% after earnings .
"This one is way oversold, I am thinking buying this stock and because 2 things, ""Black Friday"" and ""Christmas Holiday"". Remember we have a strong job market and we have more spending power than ever before."
Lol I bought this in 2014!!!!!!!

Wow beast day for ulta up $16
Going under 200......
Ulta Beauty reached a 52 Week high at 313.65
"How has this stock not cratered. Are girls so vain the use makeup to sit at home or do a conference call? Restaurants closed, theaters closed, remote learning for school, working from home, why are beauty products selling?"
"$ULTA Blount Sally E., Director of Ulta Beauty, Inc. bought 250 shares on 2020-06-26. https://formwhispers.com/s?t=ULTA"
Awesome day today. Bet we do good tomorrow. I will take a 8.5 gain any day.
this is Friday and day traders are gonna take profit around 10-11 AM so expect a big drop then too
"Correction is over, Ulta price got way ahead of itself last year and the market oversold it. All the bad news is out with nothing else left to hold the price back, will be seeing $300 by the end of the year and beyond. History repeats itself just like ULTA in 2014 where ULTA proceeded to double in price within a year from the same point we are at now."
Monday rip to $400
Extremely overpriced @ $191+ for current state of business affairs
What’s driving the price increase? What news? It’s up over 30 points in a week!
"I started buying shares from $205, great company and stock. Shares aren’t even that expensive at around 25x this years earnings plus double digit growth. A matter of time before it goes higher and holidays coming"
"I recently bought shares based on the technical levels but have not been following the stock, do longs think the announcement of new Kardashian line will cause a meaningful bounce?"
"About to cross the 20 day moving average, right after breaking below the 50 day in the same day. I wouldn't be surprised if ULTA tests the 200 day soon, around $300.We were $355 a week ago, and still do not understand this move.....I do not buy its Covid Variants! We have a vaccine and very positive numbers and no deaths. This is about the economy, inflation and gov't incompetence."
I’ll be glad when this quarter is better than expected and the sellers/shorts will need makeup to cover all their bruises.
No growth company? The numbers tell the truth! Cover now Shorts!
Algo computers crashing stock today. Back to 234 it seems
"Check out last year’s short interest at this time to now, almost identical and then a massive squeeze in Q4. Expect the same thing shorties!!"
Ulta Beauty is up 5.92% to 413.00
Retailers are in for a big shopping season. When the numbers are released ULTA will be seeing it’s way back to 300
"Here's how Ulta has handled current event.... paid all employees in full up till 4/19. At that time they furloughed any employee who will actually take home more money each week from unemployment and care act than they their avg weekly over last 13 pay periods. Ulta will also be paying for those employees health ins. during the entire time they are closed. All other employees, mostly management, will be paid in full until reopenings. Brilliant move. All employees are being taken care of. Ulta will explode upon re-opening and they wont miss a beat with a well oiled machine intact. My wife is management, this is all first hand factual info. They already have a plan and have prepared themesleves for it. 1.3 Billion in cash on hand will more than allow them to weather the storm. Play it as you will..."
presence in target a good thing...!
"two years ago I had $100K worth leading up to earnings, sold off 20% after earnings and I sold for a loss.. two years later the stock went from $80 to $368 effectively costing me $250,000+ in profits.. lesson learned.. this stock is a monster and will bounce back hard and fast.."
"For Ulta, same pattern happened during last quarter results. Current results are for Nov, Dec, Jan which are very critical for retail. Ulta beefed up its online presence and its rewards program should keep Ulta very competitive.Again you never know. I made money during last quarter and I am risking that now. Good luck to all."
300 tomorrow
Ultra is up almost 30 percent this year....only reason why its down abit..business is still doing well ....with long term interest rates very low it makes sense to keep holding ULTA
"Perfect example of why trying to time the market is a waste of time. Last quarter ER drop was a gift and instead of panicking and selling, those that were patient and held or bought more are being rewarded."
"So, eight brokers raise price targets for ULTA and one Wells Fargo downgrades opinion to Equal Weight. The result is a price drop of about $8 that is well under the latest mean expected price. Go figure!"
"what is holding ULTA down, strong retail sales number, back to work post covid should be a boost to ULTA sales. I expected at least $340 at this point and surpass old highs above $350 with May ER."
Just love how all the men comment about the prices. It is very rare that I have ever seen a man in that store. Also for those of you who comment that you can get the same thing cheaper at Walmart....you cannot get prestige brands at Walmart or Walgreens or Target....I love Ulta and they have a great rewards program and coupons on prestige items...nobody else will give that.
"Dillon, the CEO of Ulta, bought $300,000 worth of shares in September. It was her first open market purchase since the 2014 buys."
"this chart looks strong, stayed above the Pivot. could gap in AM"
Finally!
Anyone know why the drop this morning?
"tomorrow it will skyrocket for sure , it will be close at 232"
"Today was a very bearish candle print for ULTA. It looks like the markets may be headed for a correction, which should drag everything down."
We eating good tonight
They addressed their bottleneck with this Target deal.
"No need to buy makeup if you can’t leave the house, I am loading up short on ULTA"
It got downgraded but the average target is still over $300. This is a huge opportunity for us to get some cheap shares
1st time trading this stock... got a put for $305 right before ER
I bet it opens over $425
"Great report, the down trend makes no sense at all."
"Stay patient ULTA holders, only more days till earnings."
Should be interesting next few days...as of right now the market is calling a 2 cent miss a non-event.
Expecting a big beat. Retail on a tear. Good numbers this could see 300 due to the amazon overreaction taking this down.
anyone out there know what happened today to drop ULTA 3% down.... this should be over $360 by now....what is pulling this down?
