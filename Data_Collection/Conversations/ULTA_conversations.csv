TGT stores also create many head winds for ULTA! Higher return rates and lower margin!
"Raymond James initiates with buy and an outperform rating, target $395. Yet ULTA is down, makes no sense. Lets STOP with this threat and fear mongering by this administration on continuing Covid and Variant scares and shutdowns.This is crazy to purposefully hurt people and economy for political gain."
Selloff tomorrow big time
Cowan raised target up to $490 today!
people will continue to buy makeup and want to smell good....!

"Should ULTA acquire SKIN?I bought more Ulta today,and added to my SKIN position too."

"About to cross the 20 day moving average, right after breaking below the 50 day in the same day. I wouldn't be surprised if ULTA tests the 200 day soon, around $300.We were $355 a week ago, and still do not understand this move.....I do not buy its Covid Variants! We have a vaccine and very positive numbers and no deaths. This is about the economy, inflation and gov't incompetence."

This company is overvalued when looking at the P.E…. It may continue accretion until after earnings. Shorting before earnings will be a very intriguing position.

"If you’re a day trader, you should definitely check out (http://Fairstox.com). They send a watchlist covering the top pre-market movers every day before the open. It’s a great way to pick out potential trades for the day."
A fully priced business
I love this stock. Personally used their online services during the height of the Pandemic. Saw what a great company they are and decided to invest in them. Bought at $227 a year ago and just sat back and watched it go up and up. I tend to invest for the long term and in this case it was definitely the right decision. Plenty more room for growth here.
ULTA was downgraded today by an analyst.
"Today was a very bearish candle print for ULTA. It looks like the markets may be headed for a correction, which should drag everything down."
Michael has the right idea...
"$ULTA Ulta Beauty, Inc. (ULTA)Total Debt (mrq) 1.88B$ULTA Ulta Beauty, Inc. (ULTA)Book Value Per Share (mrq) 33.49"
Increased price target today by Telsey Advisory Group to $475. More to follow with increased rev projections and continued strength into the holiday season.
"So, eight brokers raise price targets for ULTA and one Wells Fargo downgrades opinion to Equal Weight. The result is a price drop of about $8 that is well under the latest mean expected price. Go figure!"
Nice AM action. Take some profits here ! Thank you.
Ulta Beauty is up 5.92% to 413.00
98% traders lose money cause lack of patience. Stock don't make U turn just like that. I would wait until $360 and $365 area.
Why should ppl go to ULTA when Sephora is everywhere? Everyone just needs the best one for both skincare and makeup products! All top brands go Sephora! Low quality brands go ULTA! This is not a secret now!
cash flow doesn't end with earnings report...people will continue buying cosmetics and scents...!
Wow beast day for ulta up $16
why did it tank ?not in this yet
"Goldman Sachs upgrades ULTA with a price target from $399 t0 $437. GS cited realized strong growth in Bath and Fragrances, and now see's cosmetics coming on strong in each category: eye, lipstick etc. I would expect price action back to over $360 leading into ER, and if these numbers from GS beauty trackers holds true in ER, ULTA will start approaching $400. Unfortunately we have to wait until EOM for the ER."
going above $380 by EOD
"$ULTA Ulta Beauty, Inc. (ULTA)Total Debt (mrq) 1.88B"
Oh yea snowflake pops $15 today after yesterday’s earnings but not ulta? You kidding me
Major trend line resistance at $413.80 this thing is notorious for gaining prior to reporting then selling off after killer earnings. Great time to short right now. Safest bet to cover back at $390 or could hold it longer and I would bet we make it back down to the MEAN trend line price which right above $360
Monday rip to $400
