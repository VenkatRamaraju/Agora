Yahoo! has been so bad lately - especially the UAL board. I like using http://alert-sounds.com/ now instead for my daily research.
Everyone including big funds know aviation sector has improved and airlines are ready to take off to new horizons. And that's the problem. Big guys know that retail investors will buy the stock at the current price thnking to make quick profit. So they have already pumped the stock. Any airline is not going to smash the Earnings as more than 50% revenue comes from business class. This category is not making enough money to show big profits. I think in the next few quarters stock price movement i(n any airline) will be decided by the big guys and not the earning reports.Good luck
I don't want to cut my losses and sell because if I do I'm sure this stock will rise from the ashes. Time is money with investing and this is just dead money now as it's not gaining value. My average is $57 and I have some Jets ETF which is also in the red.
"The travel demand is very high right now, and it will continue all the way until end of next year, the only thing that pull back all airlines stock is just the fuel price - it's more like an excuse for the analyst to cast a gloomy future for airlines stock, airlines company will hedge fuel price for sure, they are not first day in business. Besides, fuel price is something that government can interfere, this is not pandemic, OPEC has to do something about it. $AAL $UAL $DAL are all in bargain price now, buy at this price and just hold on to it, and you will have handsome return next year."
"""United Airlines says unvaccinated pilots costing airline $700,000 a week""No, UAL you are costing yourselves this amount of money with illegal mandates of medical tyranny. Short these people into BK.....This is about freedom of something that as a whole is benign. You are causing this and no one should take a medication that increases strokes and heart attacks."
"indices are growing every day, and the entire aviation sector is falling for 13 days in a row, why?"
I’m in.. 5000 shares 46.20
I just loaded more a couple hundreds of UAL shares. I still believe that it will turn around within 3 months.
"""Every single year for the past 5 years the airlines ETF Jets and other airline companies have ran up in November.

"India is the source of the latest mutation - covid delta, where the vaccination rate of the population against covid19 is less than 20 percent. morbidity and mortality are at their lowest levels. buy!"
"Let put it this way, the fuel cost rise because the demand is high, demand is high because border has been re-opened soon and people eager to fly, that's also means airlines company is selling more tickets and the business is good. So why is it a bad thing? Does market hope for fuel price is low due to supply over demand? That suppose to prop the stock price? Btw, minimum wages is increasing, money is printing, people are now asking for 4th stimulus check, child tax credit, strike all over country asking for higher pay and benefits, the government keep pouring money into the economy - remember 3.5 trillions spending plan? All commodity cost is inflated and you expect oil to stay low? Once people realize oil price hike is inevitable, all airlines stock will roaring back. $UAL $AAL $ DAL"
Airlines & Cruise lines stocks & BA have been shorted by big bad boys before all the tourist restrictions lifted on 11/11.
"Oct. 19, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- United Airlines (UAL) today announced third-quarter 2021 financial results. Despite the impact of the COVID-19 Delta variant in the third quarter, the company remains confidently on track to achieve the range of longer term financial targets laid out as part of its United Next plan earlier this summer, and to reduce CASM-ex1 below 2019 levels next year.Citing the rebound in premium leisure travel, re-opening of European borders next month, continued recovery of business travel and early indications of loosening travel restrictions in key Pacific markets, United also announced plans to increase international capacity by 10% in 2022 - while keeping domestic capacity flat to 2019. The plan will capitalize on already improving international margins and United's ideally situated coastal hubs that have powered the airline's recent success in launching new routes to Africa and India. Expected flying at record levels to Europe, Latin America, India, Africa and the Middle East in summer 2022, will be enabled by the anticipated return of United's Pratt & Whitney-powered Boeing 777s to the fleet in 2022, which - when combined with already announced approximately $2.2 billion in structural cost reduction and planned gauge growth - will allow United to keep CASM-ex1 in check as it continues on the path to recovery.""The recovery was delayed by the Delta variant, but the United team remains focused on our long-term vision – and not getting sidetracked by near-term volatility – meaning we're solidly on track to achieve the targets we set for 2022,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby. ""From the return of business travel and the planned re-opening of Europe and early indications for opening in the Pacific, the headwinds we've faced are turning to tailwinds, and we believe that United is better positioned to lead the recovery than any airline in the world. Our recovery will be supported by investments in technology and other efficiencies that will give our employees the tools they need to take great care of our customers - and keep costs under control. I am grateful to our United team members for their continued commitment to our customers, because it has been essential to our ability to weather the pandemic, and it will fuel our success in the years ahead.""Third Quarter Financial ResultsReported third quarter 2021 capacity down 28% compared to third quarter 2019.Reported third quarter 2021 net income of $0.5 billion, adjusted net loss[2] of $0.3 billion.Reported third quarter 2021 total operating revenue of $7.8 billion, down 31.9% compared to third quarter 2019.Reported third quarter 2021 Total Revenue Per Available Seat Mile (TRASM) of down 5.1% compared to third quarter 2019.Reported third quarter 2021 operating expenses down 32.2%, down 20.9% excluding special charges (credits)2, compared to third quarter 2019.Reported third quarter 2021 Cost Per Available Seat Mile (CASM) of down 5.6%, CASM, excluding fuel, profit sharing, third-party business expenses and special charges (CASM-ex)1 of up 14.9% compared to third quarter 2019.Reported third quarter 2021 pre-tax margin of 7.8%, negative 6.1% on an adjusted2 basis.Reported third quarter 2021 adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) margin2 of 7.4%.Reported third quarter 2021 ending available liquidity3 of approximately $21 billion.

What I learned from investing in UAL is the most expensive lesson ever in my life
"I’m holding since June and I have averaged down to $54.25 8800 shares. With losses of nearly $100,000.00 at times I’m now at $75000.00 loser,yes it’s been hard at times but I still believe in the next 3 or 4 months I will break even and possibly profit a few thousand. I’m holding on for $65,00 and realize a $90,000.00 profit. Until then I’ll sit back and enjoy this chat room and wait patiently for $6500 a share. That’s gonna give me about 25% profit. Pretty good return but I’ll be glad to be done with this venture. It’s been a long time coming but overall it’s been a pretty good year. I’ve put over $50,000.00 in the kitty. Life is good. Now could I get some good advice on the next stock to roll the dice on. Serious advice only. Thanks again and GLTA"
"Great earnings call, happy to see the big jump AH. I must confess I was not expecting it, nonetheless I am pleased and glad with how this is now trending. Good to have kept and consolidated my position over the months."
"TSA numbers yesterday 1,927,041 and in 2019 was 2,047,910. Getting back up there !"

"Zacks Consensus EstimateThis airline is expected to post quarterly loss of $1.49 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +81.7%.Revenues are expected to be $7.81 billion, up 213.7% from the year-ago quarter."
tax manipulations are over today. The incidence of covid-delta-plus is only increasing in eastern Europe. my opinion - is that in the near future there is no obstacle to the way to the top. strong buy
-3% day end just watch 
close green pleaseeeee!!!
Oil dropping and so are airlines. Does not make any sense
"To protect themselves, and sometimes to even take advantage of the situation, airlines commonly hedge their fuel costs. They do this by buying or selling the expected future price of oil through a range of derivatives, thus protecting them from rising prices."
Buy airlines. I was watching Florida YouTube yesterday- airports are full.
"SPY went up 10 points and UAL down $2 in last 3 days even though travelling is picking up as COVID is under control, don’t know what it needs to push the stock price higher"
"The risk to reward for airlines at these levels is amazing, incoming catalysts below:- Massive influx of demand on November 8th as international travel ban is lifted by the US- Holiday season demand will be higher than usual as many weren't able to travel last holiday season- Oil prices have peaked short-term and is beginning to downtrend a bit- As demand increases pricing power of ticket prices will combat elevated oil costs.$DAL $UAL $AAL $LUV $JETS $BA"
not the most loved stock in the world...new PT of $78 by Cowan and it barely moves. Come on UAL. Giddy up already
My airline stocks are dead weight in my portfolio at a time when everything else is marching upwards.

COME ON LET'S GET BACK INTO THE 50'S
I’m guessing for the next two weeks we see some pretty good strides made. I’m going to just make a guess at 3 points sometime this week or next.
"we are seeing a consolidation of a low base. we expect news on the further dynamics of the epidemic with the new mutation covid delta-plus. I bet that the development of a situation with an epidemic similar to the Idian case will not happen. As for the long-term prospects, United Airlines is, in my opinion, the most advanced innovative airline in the United States (Paypal payments, supersonic aircraft, etc.) I would not be surprised if they start accepting crypto payments in 2022. I already wrote about deflation, and I am very pleased that Katy Wood shares my views). we see thousands of ships stranded unloading in ports, this barrage of goods will soon pile on the American market. I believe the price of united airlines will double from these levels by February 2022 (if there is no war, and I believe that there will definitely not be a war until the new year))"
Cowen up price target to $78 from $72.
"The fact that my bro was furloughed as a UAL pilot, called in for retraining, and now flies non-stop......I'm all in!!"
You will never see UAL at this level again BUY if you want to double you investment in few months
I have a feeling earnings will be fine and we’re going higher going forward despite the oil price hike. Only the retailers sold today!
