I believe we are swimming at the support level 44-47 waiting for delta cases to drop down and then the take off
Soon to give up
Shorts are getting shredded. Wait until capitulation by end of day.

"the war on inflation has acquired a positional character - the rise in prices fizzles out, while the corresponding increase in supply has not yet affected the markets. The question is - what will happen when it reaches the consumer, in parallel with the reduction of the balance sheets of central banks, the depletion of benefits accumulated during the covid period and the growth of rates? Do we not see deflation at a distance of 2-3 years in a foggy distance than 10 years ago, and how to combine this vision with a gradual verticalization of the risk-free asset yield curve? choose a company with a stable cash flow."

Such a good week. I’ve gained almost half of my losses $95000.00. Another $115000.00 and I’ll see green It’s been a long hard pull and whoever says this is easy money just don’t have a clue. I’ve shed blood sweat and tears holding on airline and cruise shares. I’ve got a long way to go but now I can sleep

Just flew back to Nashville from Fairbanks. Delta to Anchorage American from Fairbanks to Nashville .Flights to and from were full. American cancelled flight from Chicago to Nashville due to flight crew deficiency. What a cluster Fxxx. that was.getting home.

hope that we end green today. 50 is cominggg
Why such a bad drop today?
CNN gave a 12 month average price target of $60. if it gets to $57 I've at least broken even. Would be nice to make a little profit but at this rate selling not at a loss would be good for me.
"Looks like we are in for another ugly week folks. I hope to be proven wrong by Wednesday but when you’re down 1.5% on a Monday following a Friday where you lost 4.5%, that’s a signal of lost trust in the near term from the investors community. I was expecting a rebound today. Anyway, GLTA"
I am in this long term so I am picking up positions during the dips. I can see how short term investors are making money as the stock fluctuates between 45 and 47.
Back on track - let's close the week strong folks! GL all
What tomorrow $60?

"Here are my reflections on the day, as it relates to airline stocks...UAL closed at a solid +1.39%, which may seem like peanuts if you think it was up 4% an hour before close. However, a stock that has been hammered like the airline industry has in the last 2 months, is unlikely going to close any higher than 2% on a single day (unless there is a huge catalyst). Day traders who have bought the dip will take their profits before the bell rings. Which is exactly what happened today.Ultimately the industry will be back as soon as vaccinations start being at a good level and infections drop below an acceptable one as well. If you are looking to make a quick profit with the likes of $UAL, $AAL or $DAL, you are in the wrong place. But if you are looking for growth in the next 3 or so months and have bought in at July - August prices, you will be doing well.Anyway, good luck to you all."
"I can patiently wait for 2 years for recovery, but this sjt please dont drop anymore. So frustrated."
"The airlines shares were doing better during the first stage of the pandemic, the market was more green and just a single positive story will rocket the shares to the sky, now we read all positive news about airlines with no huge jump as it used to be last year. $UAL $DAL $LUV"
3% drop is really a real pain.

"If you’re looking for a short and sweet guide to the day’s biggest news, I recommend (http://Pick-stocks.com). They breakdown the most important pre-market news and it only takes a few minutes to read."
"I’ll buy back in under 35. Otherwise, forget it."
"Airlines stocks are terrible to invest in and only good for trend and day trading; each day you hear on the news how they airlines causes their own problems, then blame the customers. Well, the customers decide it's not worth being harassed by the attendants and just don't fly. My last flight recently was terrible, they treat you like cattle. Most of us have flown several times in our lives, and now there is nothing friendly with airlines these day."
"Any takes on why UAL is barely green (for now), while DAL and AAL are 1.3% up?"
"Maybe I'm wrong, but I'm followed others in months ago and just exit all positions as others i know recently did. I'll buy some popcorn watch from the sidelines."
"When Covid no longer becomes a major threat, people are going to want to travel to places. SO of course UAL is going to go up. I mean, basically, all airlines will eventually go up at some point. It's only the time that some people don't like."
"Stock price of 92.00 in Nov of 2019 before Covid hit in 2020. The airline was very successful and the best on the planet. Now, stock price 44.45 with half as many potential customers and a facist relationship with the government. Opportunistic management is using covid as an excuse to purge their higher paid older employees in the name of safety. The unions are complicit in doing the democrats dirty work. That's all you get with this one folks and congratulations, your vaccine is already obsolete."
They had some interesting insights about UAL on (http://Rightpicker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
Technical showed $54-$55 trading range by the end of this month... We should bounce back $60 level by the of this year...
"I don’t want to know the politics of airlines but now I do , so I will fly others and buy stocks of others that was easy."

"everything will be fine. everyone loves to fly on airplanes. the market wants to fall, but it can. waiting for what Jerome will say on Friday."
The science says firing 232 people will stop the spread! Laughing out loud.
Get ready for that 50% gain coming!
united stock is lined up for epic contraction. They have alienated 1/2 of the flying public with their draconian treatment of their employees. Hard sell on this dog.
Higher oil and people costs. Business travel years away. Next earnings will bring the price back to low 40's.
ughhh :(
"UAL received 20,000 applications for 2,000 open flight attendant positions recently and 700 applications for 400 other various roles at a recent job fair. So much for those saying they are going to be short staffed and have an outflow of employees due to vaccine mandates LOL. There are some real Einstein’s on this board I must say…..Jeff. Poor fella!"
"SPY went up 10 points and UAL down $2 in last 3 days even though travelling is picking up as COVID is under control, don’t know what it needs to push the stock price higher"
Covid case is declining for last seven days in a row. We have passed the delta variant peak.
We've been here before and NO we're not going back to what happened after the country closed down. The Delta variant will run its course and hopefully the million shots in the arm last week will expand as more of the reluctant public gets tired of getting sick and seeing their loved ones or friends dying. We will see more variants of the virus and face booster shots. Air travel will pick up as people get used to the fact that we will have to adjust to virus environment for several years and learn how to be safe and responsible. So add to your portfolio slowly as the rest of the investing public runs for cover. There is no hurry here.
covid new cases going down significantly( no more fear of delta variant); UK more soft travel rule ..... UAL may come back to $60 soon. My prediction
"Why don’t we stay home 24hrs? No jobs, no food and wish money come from government for free? Come on get on with the reality. The vaccines will turn it look like common cold and people who already got it will not threat life’s…. Get on with your life."
Wow futures are down 324. Wonder what is going on. Kinda scary  I’ve got a lot riding and too heavily on the margin side. This could get nasty really fast. How low do y’all think this could go. Serious post only please
60 possible in Oct
Tsa numbers are in pre-pandemic level with severe delta variant. Don’t understand why delta variant is underperforming?
Covid cases in Asia is decreasing daily now. Vaccine has been vamped up over there. Expect international travel to come back soon
5% today is just mind blowing for a company loosing money. There is nothing to indicate it should go up like that except someone with a lot of money manipulating the stock price.
Sit tight... UAL will double in a year. So will most airlines and cruiselines.

This is a bit of an absurd trend. Airline stocks are truly stuck. I struggle to find an explanation that holds water for today’s blood bath
"The travel demand is very high right now, and it will continue all the way until end of next year, the only thing that pull back all airlines stock is just the fuel price - it's more like an excuse for the analyst to cast a gloomy future for airlines stock, airlines company will hedge fuel price for sure, they are not first day in business. Besides, fuel price is something that government can interfere, this is not pandemic, OPEC has to do something about it. $AAL $UAL $DAL are all in bargain price now, buy at this price and just hold on to it, and you will have handsome return next year."

Can’t believe I actually felt like I made a good trade yesterday when I bought 500 shares @ $48.68 I actually felt good about it. Averaged down and I think I’ll make some quick $$$ on it
Can't understand the problem with bad passengers on planes. Simply should be banned from flying anymore simple as that. And if there is any assault involved severe fine and jail time.
I would walk before I flew on United Airlines.
Yesterday felt like a “there and back” trip. Hopefully today’s early tradings’ gains stick. GLTA
cant wait to see 80 soon
well look at that. United screws over their employees in the name of covid and lands a huge government contract. who knew?
Covid numbers dropping in virtually every state in the US over the past week. Media doesn't like to post good news. It doesn't attract viewers apparently.
"Don't fret the recent selling...big institutions want in on the action that's coming. International flights open up in November, which is a big revenue boost for UAL. Pre-covid, this was trading near $90."
Airlines needed to fly people out of Afghan

"According to ihme software, us delta variant covid case will get the peak within weeks and then it will slowly come down. Ihme software is very reliable.

Once big money step in, it will be too late for retail investors."

"This is back at the price when the vaccines were initially announced. Its absurd to think that with TSA numbers so high compared to November last year and with populations in US and Europe more than 50% vaccinated that we are still at this price. The Vaccine may not have been as effective as we thought but mortality rates are much lower in Europe than pre-vaccine and US is lagging behind due to the anti-vax movement, not because of the vaccine."
Let see this stock gonna drop 2% tmr. Hopeless.

"As for Covid in my neighborhood, a lot of people are getting it some are dying vaccinated and not vaccinated. IMO this is just another disease that is capable of killing us. No different than flu cancer heart disease and the list goes on.We have vaccines and treatment. Whether or not you choose to take it is or should be your choice. Me personally have gotten my vaccine. It makes me feel a little bit more safe. I think herd immunity is the real answer"
