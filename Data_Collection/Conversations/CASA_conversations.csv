"CASA will report earning March 6,2018 AMC."
I'm interested in the stocks reaction to earnings today. The last earnings report resulted in a big jump. Hoping for the same this time around. I will be adding today before earnings. Good luck
This is a domestic 5G player. Wouldn't the new federal policy help its business against Huawei and foreign competitions?
"Cramer was asked about casa last night, said he had to do some homework on it."
It looks like CSCO wants to buy CASA-----40+ soon
"I called investor relations today and they will have positive guidance out in a couple of weeks, she said."
is this going to be like twlo and ntnx and rebound?
$9.99 opening tomorrow
Tomorrow $12 plus year end $20Way undervalued stock
Should be $30's at the end of year 2018.

Casa Systems reached a 52 Week high at 8.70
I like that casa has bizness outside US because I keep hearing the big spending by carriers into 5g is starting next year due to mergers and acquisitions this year. I would like to hear others opinions.

Annual reports coming Feb 18. Get in before this thing shoots up.
Just wait for the calm(bottom) then reload
Disappointed with this drop.... makes no sense...
"the secondary is priced at $25, so not sure why it's dipping below that"
The CFO left the ship.
Needs to clear 18 soon.
"Should I get in now or wait for pullback? Like the company, may be not the stock price :)"
Momentum and relative strength is gonna move this. Has anyone notice the huge increase in volume. I’ll bet it hits $40 by next earnings.....past is best predictor and they blew earnings away this quarter
"What's the old Buffett saying, buy when there's blood in the streets or something like that? I'm getting some more if I can get it in the low 8's."
casa got on blowstocks stock site.
Shhhhhh... don’t let our little secret under the radar stock be know to Wall Street yet until I can buy even more shares. This thing has enormous potential
Huge buying opportunity!!!
Analyst UPGRADE this morning caught my eye. Interesting Company. Opening a new position here. Good luck to fellow posters.
"Fantastic earnings results! Their investments in wireless are showing results. Strong backlog, strong guidance. After many years of poor performance, 2021 should be a very good year for this stock. I expect many larger companies in telecom will be looking to Casa as an acquisition candidate to enter or expand their wireless offerings."
Looks like it has touched its bottom. It will go up. The swings in CASA are high. It’s a good time to buy
Gotta love it. I will load if they somehow walk this down below 8. Pure gold.
CASA is down -15.85% to 20.92
Yesterday traded at 5x the average volume. Should be some good positive momentum to follow. Premarket up .10.
looking like some profits are being taken. probably settle around 11 today and then $12 next week
Very nice! CASA up while the market sells off big time. This ones a holder
August 14th ER After the bell.
Casa up 12% WHY?
"It’s been 1 week since I said 26 in three weeks, 5 bucks to go in next 2 weeks, hang in longs"
"Just buy all the 25.6M float for $294M at $11.50 a share. Or even better go private. Now that it is in the $11s, this is a bargain to go private at $20 after buying all the float."
strong earning report and strong growth ahead...
PE for CASA is 15's but 40's as indicated. Price = $15; Earning $1 = 15/1 = 15. The PE average for sector is: 30's. SUPPER CHEAP.Just needing PR (Publish relation).
It looks like Arris wants to buy CASA. What's the premium sell price? Any thoughts?
Still trying to eliminate trace amounts of FUD that kept me from buying at opening.
Remember when this company had a share buyback? Is it still ongoing? Haven't followed it that closely but quickly looked at its earnings disappointment. What a scam of a poorly run company with overpaid executives???
Looks like the reversal is in full swing
"Bought 1000 shares, acquisition likely in the near future."
"Good fundamentals. When it's breakout, its going to fly."
This stock is so frustrating to follow..... seriously thinking of cutting my losses......
when is the FDA report?
"Hoping for good earning, will hold it for 1 year, Great products, worldwide business"
I wish casa had options available
CEO and Head of investor relations should be fired. No news and the allow for stock held by insiders to sell at share price 6 to 7 dollars less then market price at time they made this announcement. Company has lost my trust and I'm sure others. Hoping earnings and guidance is good or here comes lower share price.
"Were holding in there, just building a base before the next surge up."
"this stock shocked investors by 1,000% and it fell to 20% buy now!!!!!"
I think there is very little downside with an earnings miss and a potentially 30% upside with good call.
"The fact that the CFO has been with the company for many years and he leaves now tells me that he just wanted to cash out his chips and retire. I don't think there is anything sinister going on which would warrant yesterday's large pullback, and the market seems to be realizing it today. This stock is extremely attractive for a long-term investor. I expect the revenues to reach $600 million in 2 years and EPS to exceed $2. The stock would deserve a high multiple if Casa shows that they are a technology leader not just in cable but also in wireless (5G). The current forward P/E of 11x will not stay for a long time."
Earnings report next Thurs..
Competition in fixed wireless access is fierce. CASA seem to be well position.
CASA is number 12th on investors daily top 100.
I'm in on the high side 31.24 but I'll make it up tomorrow.
"Got in today at 29.50, looks like a runner"
Casa Systems is up 7.06% to 8.04
"Pssst! Hey CASA management and board of directors, you do realize it’s YOUR job to promote the company publicly…don’t you?"
"I think the additional offering at 25 caused free fall. Soon it will stabilise and we all will good about our investment, since according to IBD this company has solid fundamentals."
what's going on with casa? it's stuck around 18.please some body enlighten me.
"I was very close to buying before the close, thank goodness I didn’t."
"Ladies & Gentlemen. CASA Systems is firmly ensconced in the 20-21 area. What do you suppose will happen if the stock ever hits again the 25-26 area? Remember, there was a secondary offering at $25 of 7 million shares. Do you think any of those folks would not like to sell and get their money back?"
"$CASA in play. MACD, Stochastic oscillator and RSI go green, according to stoxline."
.88 book value. nuff said
"Casa stock cut in half since its secondary stock offering back in April. None of the proceeds went to the company. Morgan Stanley took part in it, then issues an upgrade shortly followed by the CFO departure. Nice timing."
"To earn money, short it. It has a very long way to push wireless product to the market. Its cable business is in down trend, not a high margin market any more. Short CASA to win"
"Added another thousand ay $7.76, not worried about today, I doubt this lasts, seems like manipulation...we'll see."
What is the down side if earnings miss
"Of all of my Nasdaq stocks, this is the most steady and dependable. Holding long."
Lot of news coming;law firms lining up with lawsuits. Go after the secondary offering I find that suspicious that none of the proceeds went to the company???
Good report! Should be going up!!!
CASA strong earning report and strong growth right?
"TIM, Ericsson and Qualcomm Set World Record for Long Distance Speed With 5G mmWave Applied to FWAGlobeNewsWire - 04 Dec+2share stock news with friendsThe companies, in collaboration with Casa Systems, have for the first time reached on mmWave frequencies the speed of 1 Gbps over a 6.5 km distance from the radio antenna The companies, in collaboration with Casa Systems, have for the first time reached on mmWave frequencies the speed of 1 Gbps over a 6.5 km distance f"
"CASA do not have a good Management, if they are loyal they should inform early about this earning and forecast. sorry for all long term investors, we all have to wait year or more to get our price back."
"Yes, CASA reported spectacular earnings!! Should be 20% up tomorrow."
Going to take my loss tomorrow. I learned my lesson on that one. Never invest in the stock market unless your liquor cabinet is already fully stocked.
it's a boatload of shares to unload and there is only 1.7M volume this morning. I'll stay on the sidelines until the knife stops falling.
glad I got in on this @15. This thing is gonna pop next week again. yeah$$$$$

Bought 4K at $19 sold at $15.90 avg. The key to successful trading is knowing when to take a loss and move on. I should have sold down 10% around $17.25 but I lost focus and I paid for it. Having said that. I nibbled here at $11.30
Should be now $10we are raising our revenue guidance to reflect our anticipation of continued success in the fourth quarter.”

Good Article on CASA. https://seekingalpha.com/article/4198745-potentially-exciting-undiscovered-gem
"Huge volume today....4 X the average. I bot some more at 17.77, and am hoping the selling is just about over for CASA."
Are we heading under $7.00?
"In all, Casa raked in $316.1 million in revenue and $88.7 million in net income in fiscal 2016 — up 16% and 30.5%, respectively, from the prior year — as outlined in its IPO filing. The bulk of overall revenue, more than 88%, came from sales of its broadband products. It derived the rest from services. The pursuit of wireless markets is just one part of a multi-pronged growth strategy outlined in Casa's IPO filing. Management also highlighted plans for research investments, selling more products to existing customers, expanding its base and making ""selective acquisitions.""Accumulating capital for possible mergers might be one reason Casa went public, wrote Ader, as it envisions expanding beyond its existing cable customers.""With the industry going through significant and ongoing consolidation, there should be growing opportunities to acquire interesting technology assets that could fit well with Casa's business and broaden its broadband access and aggregation product portfolio,"" he wrote."
is this a real business?
Swimming against the negative current today. Wonder how it will react when the market recovers.
"The S&P 600, an index of small-cap stocks, rose 2.9% Friday, more than triple the percentage-point gain on the large cap The leap came after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell reassured markets that the bank is in no rush to raise interest rates. The average one-year forward earnings multiple for stocks in the S&P 600 is about 0.75 times that of the average for the S&P 500, according to The Leuthold Group. Usually, when small-cap profit forecasts are growing faster than those for large-caps, the small stocks outperform, Leuthold’s data show."
Any idea where this stock is heading?
I love when stocks go up because of earnings. I buy puts every time and always pays out. The price goes up then right back down. I seen it happen EVERY time.
I'm in at 31. Nasdaq is up 100 points and here we are down 7%. I'm not very smart. I take that back. I am smart at losing money.
Opinions are appreciated on at what price to get a starting position. Will we see this go below 20?
what's going on
I really don't see much A/H volume...couple sales is about it at this low price. I wonder what the impact will be at the open....anyone ?
"I bought 1500 shares at 23. Lets hope this is the bottom, ill buy more if it dips at 22.80"
This stock makes me want to go to mi casa and drink beer.
Looks like target met 30 smackers
Stock will rise gradually to $20 plus by summer time in July
"Don’t want to sound overly optimistic, but at this pace we could hit $40 next week."
Very strange move after a good ER!
I’m adding with a volume breakout
is the market looking for a bad news tomorrow?
I do not understand why CASA is going down although there is no bad news. At this price CASA is very undervalued.
"Now is the right time to buy, great software company"
"It was an informative conference call. They have very strong profit margins, which indicates a strong position in the market. They said they are in 30 lab trials for wireless in addition to the 3 major customers they signed recently. There seems to be a long runway for growth both in cable and in 5G. If they can sustain the ~20% growth rate in Ebitda a few years out, the stock price can double in a couple of years."
I bought at 25 then again at 22. I have my next order set for 20. I think averaging down will turn out good in the long run. This should turn sooner than later I hope. Good Luck everyone.
"That was risky, but a good trade. Bought a month ago and just sold. If it has a pull back. to high 8's... I'm back in!!!"
Someone knows what's wrong with this stock? Everyday a new low...
"Here's earnings summary.Casa Systems (CASA) reported 2nd Quarter June 2018 earnings of $0.24 per share.

June 13th is the end of the lock-up don't expect a lot of Insider selling they've just received a hundred and fifty million dollars from The Six Million shares to institutions insiders already cashed out so they don't have to sell on June 13th they can hold the remainder of their shares long-term and watch the price go up and cash at a later date
I’m done with this.Insiders got rich.
back to its way to $30 after ER
do I get back in or is it a bad sign to lose all gains after upgrade
Yup time for THE move
"Casa already has institutional investors lined up to gobble up 7.35M shares at $25. None of us plebes on the message board will get a sweetheart deal like that. Why is it a such a sweetheart deal? Because at daily volumes of 0.2M to 1.0M, if the institutions tried to buy 7.35M shares on the open market, they're drive the price to $40+. The institutions know whats going on, hence the huge demand for the stock. Draw your own conclusions."
Does management work two jobs? The company and shorts?
"This was the best conference call CASA has had since their IPO. They should make the interim CFO the permanent one, he was very clear and reassuring with his answers, unlike all the previous CFOs who all seemed timid to talk. The results and the outlook look very good, with a lot of conservatism which is needed since they have disappointed multiple times. This stock could be a double from here with some traction in 5G."

"If earnings are great, the stock will double in a couple of months."

Something is up with CASA. This stock will not drop is slowly moving up even with the market unstable.
Fantastic fundamentals. CASA systems definitely is a major player in the 5G and wireless industries. Expecting a nice ER tonight. Can we make it back to profitability? I really believe it is possible today.
Is there a buyout rumor? Over 1 million traded in the first hour..
"I got a CASA Pebble, free from Sprint. Works excellent! Sprint is buying them. I don't see where earnings can be anything but good."
"If I were a financial analyst, I would rate CASA a strong BUY with a target price of $12."
Question... I’m in at 29 still. I wanna have balls of steel but this is frustrating watching it go thru this lol. What yal think? My belief is it’s a strong company with big potential but right now it’s tempting me to sell lol sum advice would be nice
Today's action shows more gain to come.
Why is Mr. Jerry Guo paying himself 1.66M? May be he will answer to all lawyers.
earnings today ?
investor relations says the 7 million shares were sold in just a few days to institutions will before they invested over 300 million dollars in the shares they were shown the long-term prospects of the company and they chose to buy them probably hold the shares for the considerable future are not looking to get their money back or day trade
Casa is back. 4Q will be much better than they were doing when the stock was over $6.
"""$100 billion would be used to build high-speed broadband networks throughout the country. The goal would be for broadband to become universal for all Americans and to drive down the costs for internet."" Wonder how much of that will fall into the bottom line of CASA. Will move the needle for sure!"
looks like even with slight guidance missed analyst have not downgraded or change their one-year Target good thing
"My exchange with Qualcomm Investor Relations following the Ericsson, Qualcomm, US Cellular mmWave news on Friday, 9/18/20:Me: In the article published today, it states "" The milestone was achieved by applying extended-range software to commercial Ericsson hardware – including AIR 5121 and Baseband 6630 – and a 5G CPE device powered by the Snapdragon X55 5G Modem-RF System with the Qualcomm QTM527 mmWave antenna module.""

Upgrades coming SOON. Back to 30+
is this the lock up
