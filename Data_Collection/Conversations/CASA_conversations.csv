I do not understand why CASA is going down although there is no bad news. At this price CASA is very undervalued.
"Casa already has institutional investors lined up to gobble up 7.35M shares at $25. None of us plebes on the message board will get a sweetheart deal like that. Why is it a such a sweetheart deal? Because at daily volumes of 0.2M to 1.0M, if the institutions tried to buy 7.35M shares on the open market, they're drive the price to $40+. The institutions know whats going on, hence the huge demand for the stock. Draw your own conclusions."
Just wait for the calm(bottom) then reload
Casa Systems is up 7.06% to 8.04
"Hoping for good earning, will hold it for 1 year, Great products, worldwide business"
Someone knows what's wrong with this stock? Everyday a new low...
"Earnings and revenue surpass estimates, and 2020 revenue guidance is raised. But CASA is down after hours. WHY?"
Bought 4K at $19 sold at $15.90 avg. The key to successful trading is knowing when to take a loss and move on. I should have sold down 10% around $17.25 but I lost focus and I paid for it. Having said that. I nibbled here at $11.30
The selling seems to be over. This is a good company. I'm placing my bet now that this goes back to at least 30. Easy 50% win. Lets see if I'm right.
is this the lock up
CASA reached a new 52 Week High at 26.16
"Holding nicely, if the naz can turn around we could make new highs again"
"HELLO, I don't understand, the report came out great, Everything is GOOD! they had an excellent earnings report, why selling off"
"Casa stock cut in half since its secondary stock offering back in April. None of the proceeds went to the company. Morgan Stanley took part in it, then issues an upgrade shortly followed by the CFO departure. Nice timing."
"What's the old Buffett saying, buy when there's blood in the streets or something like that? I'm getting some more if I can get it in the low 8's."
back to its way to $30 after ER
CASA is up 11.83% to 4.35
Looks like the reversal is in full swing
Annual reports coming Feb 18. Get in before this thing shoots up.
This stock makes me want to go to mi casa and drink beer.
Casa upgraded from overweight to buy......
Needs to clear 18 soon.
exactly what you want to see when earnings due AFTB
Casa no news just keeps dropping.

I'm in on the high side 31.24 but I'll make it up tomorrow.
Analyst Sarah Hindlian cites the Q2 disappointment and notes a decline in visibility going forward.
I think there is very little downside with an earnings miss and a potentially 30% upside with good call.
"Extended from 22 big move since, very normal, healthy pullback"
"That was risky, but a good trade. Bought a month ago and just sold. If it has a pull back. to high 8's... I'm back in!!!"
CASA is up 14.33% to 4.15
Competition in fixed wireless access is fierce. CASA seem to be well position.
Casa Systems is up 25.00% to 10.65
26 in three weeks
looks like even with slight guidance missed analyst have not downgraded or change their one-year Target good thing
it's a boatload of shares to unload and there is only 1.7M volume this morning. I'll stay on the sidelines until the knife stops falling.
what's going on with casa? it's stuck around 18.please some body enlighten me.
This seems like a bargain.......
Going up that's why I brought this one casa
what's going on
Very strange move after a good ER!
"Good fundamentals. When it's breakout, its going to fly."
"Bought 1000 shares, acquisition likely in the near future."
Upgrades coming soon. $33 Target to be raised.
Add it if you can. reward later on
is the market looking for a bad news tomorrow?
Casa Systems reached a 52 Week high at 8.70
"It was an informative conference call. They have very strong profit margins, which indicates a strong position in the market. They said they are in 30 lab trials for wireless in addition to the 3 major customers they signed recently. There seems to be a long runway for growth both in cable and in 5G. If they can sustain the ~20% growth rate in Ebitda a few years out, the stock price can double in a couple of years."
Something is up with CASA. This stock will not drop is slowly moving up even with the market unstable.
"Added another thousand ay $7.76, not worried about today, I doubt this lasts, seems like manipulation...we'll see."
Casa Systems is up 8.94% to 5.12
Word is out that CASA is a buyout target. 30+
Swimming against the negative current today. Wonder how it will react when the market recovers.
I like that casa has bizness outside US because I keep hearing the big spending by carriers into 5g is starting next year due to mergers and acquisitions this year. I would like to hear others opinions.
Wow... $11's
"Do we ever see CASA at $20's again? YES. Pretty sure within year 2019 CASA will turn around and stay at $20's. It's 5G/future company. ""Wait and See"""
Remember when this company had a share buyback? Is it still ongoing? Haven't followed it that closely but quickly looked at its earnings disappointment. What a scam of a poorly run company with overpaid executives???
I love when stocks go up because of earnings. I buy puts every time and always pays out. The price goes up then right back down. I seen it happen EVERY time.
.88 book value. nuff said
"this stock shocked investors by 1,000% and it fell to 20% buy now!!!!!"
2250 before announcement of last earnings which were good only miss guidance by a few million and still the shares were ridiculously hit bounce back is coming now
I believe huge earning is due during the week of July 30.
"That’s old news, came out 3/6. New news: CASA is releasing 7.35M shares, which is why we’re down AH."
management in this company so crooked. I'm very disappointed
Good report! Should be going up!!!
Are we heading under $7.00?
This is a domestic 5G player. Wouldn't the new federal policy help its business against Huawei and foreign competitions?
Looks like target met 30 smackers
It looks like CSCO wants to buy CASA-----40+ soon
"I bought 1500 shares at 23. Lets hope this is the bottom, ill buy more if it dips at 22.80"
Just took my 12k loss and sold. No future...
With such a small float it’s easy to manipulate.
"Of all of my Nasdaq stocks, this is the most steady and dependable. Holding long."
"The fact that the CFO has been with the company for many years and he leaves now tells me that he just wanted to cash out his chips and retire. I don't think there is anything sinister going on which would warrant yesterday's large pullback, and the market seems to be realizing it today. This stock is extremely attractive for a long-term investor. I expect the revenues to reach $600 million in 2 years and EPS to exceed $2. The stock would deserve a high multiple if Casa shows that they are a technology leader not just in cable but also in wireless (5G). The current forward P/E of 11x will not stay for a long time."
I bought at 25 then again at 22. I have my next order set for 20. I think averaging down will turn out good in the long run. This should turn sooner than later I hope. Good Luck everyone.
Telecoms spending that much on hardware right now? Might be a problem for casa.
"And we indeed turned a profit. $0.01 versus expected ($0.03), 83.4 million versus expected 77 million. Fantastic report!!!! Very nice cash flow as well."
"I fought and fought and won. Sold 5k at $13.25 to make make $8600 back out of the $11,500 i booked after selling prior to earnings. Happy and moving on"
Anyone knows if CASA still holds IBD recommendation ?
Today's action shows more gain to come.
2019 this thing roars! Gotta be patient!
I’m adding with a volume breakout
"In all, Casa raked in $316.1 million in revenue and $88.7 million in net income in fiscal 2016 — up 16% and 30.5%, respectively, from the prior year — as outlined in its IPO filing. The bulk of overall revenue, more than 88%, came from sales of its broadband products. It derived the rest from services. The pursuit of wireless markets is just one part of a multi-pronged growth strategy outlined in Casa's IPO filing. Management also highlighted plans for research investments, selling more products to existing customers, expanding its base and making ""selective acquisitions.""Accumulating capital for possible mergers might be one reason Casa went public, wrote Ader, as it envisions expanding beyond its existing cable customers.""With the industry going through significant and ongoing consolidation, there should be growing opportunities to acquire interesting technology assets that could fit well with Casa's business and broaden its broadband access and aggregation product portfolio,"" he wrote."
I m not sure why they are buying their own shares when their business is still lagging and just recently bought $75M at much higher price.. Not a smart management.
I really don't see much A/H volume...couple sales is about it at this low price. I wonder what the impact will be at the open....anyone ?
Waiting for Earnings release announcement - anyone have an idea of the date?
Volume good
"New CFO is coming from FactSet which is a much larger company than Casa. I listened to the last FDS earnings call to get a feel about this guy. He seems to be very good and knowledgeable. He was praised by the FactSet CEO for his contributions, so it looks like Nicolelli was looking for a new challenge, and hopefully also more upside with a smaller company. This is good for CASA, as the guy is experienced, yet dynamic. I think he will add much needed experience to a relatively green executive team (when it comes to running a public company). He also seems to be experienced in deal-making which is always a good skill. All in all, the new CFO seems to be a great catch for Casa. We'll see what the market thinks over the next few weeks."
"WORKING TOGETHER TO TRANSFORM NETWORKINGIn 2017, Intel brought its vision to two innovative partners, Casa Systems and Kyrio, a wholly owned subsidiary of CableLabs. The three companies collaborated on a unique proof of concept (PoC) that employs a virtualized, converged, and distributed network. The PoC is built around an open source-based platform running software from Casa Systems and Kyrio that brings together several access-related virtualized network functions (VNFs) into the same management domain"
"My exchange with Qualcomm Investor Relations following the Ericsson, Qualcomm, US Cellular mmWave news on Friday, 9/18/20:Me: In the article published today, it states "" The milestone was achieved by applying extended-range software to commercial Ericsson hardware – including AIR 5121 and Baseband 6630 – and a 5G CPE device powered by the Snapdragon X55 5G Modem-RF System with the Qualcomm QTM527 mmWave antenna module."" Can you disclose what CPE device powered this testing? Because it wasn't disclosed, speculation is that this was a Chinese manufactured device. Can you provide more information?""Qualcomm: ""Great to meet you.Yes, the CPE device is a Qualcomm powered CPE reference design.

The recent downward pressure on CASA shares falling from $5 to below $4 is possibly an effort by an acquirer to get the best price.One to keep an eye on......"
Me likey very much.
"Ladies & Gentlemen. CASA Systems is firmly ensconced in the 20-21 area. What do you suppose will happen if the stock ever hits again the 25-26 area? Remember, there was a secondary offering at $25 of 7 million shares. Do you think any of those folks would not like to sell and get their money back?"
"Pssst! Hey CASA management and board of directors, you do realize it’s YOUR job to promote the company publicly…don’t you?"
CFO jumping ship
Why is Mr. Jerry Guo paying himself 1.66M? May be he will answer to all lawyers.
E-Trade shows that earnings will be out in the PM on Aug 8th.
Casa Systems reached a 52 Week high at 8.05
they are projecting net loss for 2021 when compared to profit in 2020. how is this a good news?
Casa is back. 4Q will be much better than they were doing when the stock was over $6.
Any idea where this stock is heading?
"Glad I sold months ago I took a $10,000 loss! The stock was the biggest mistake I ever made."
CASA strong earning report and strong growth right?
"I got a CASA Pebble, free from Sprint. Works excellent! Sprint is buying them. I don't see where earnings can be anything but good."
Why is anyone selling this stock?
Broke through resistance. Let’s go.. close this bad boy at 18!
Should be $30's at the end of year 2018.
"Yes, CASA reported spectacular earnings!! Should be 20% up tomorrow."
"Huge volume today....4 X the average. I bot some more at 17.77, and am hoping the selling is just about over for CASA."
This stock is so frustrating to follow..... seriously thinking of cutting my losses......
Yesterday traded at 5x the average volume. Should be some good positive momentum to follow. Premarket up .10.
"I think the additional offering at 25 caused free fall. Soon it will stabilise and we all will good about our investment, since according to IBD this company has solid fundamentals."
Casa up 12% WHY?
5g just a dream?
Not sure that I like the +$.15 EPS non-GAAP vs the -$.31 EPS GAAP loss. Could not find their reconciliation between the two to be complete. Would possibly be less concerning if another CFO hadn't just left there. Feeling a bit suspicious.
"To earn money, short it. It has a very long way to push wireless product to the market. Its cable business is in down trend, not a high margin market any more. Short CASA to win"
"It’s been 1 week since I said 26 in three weeks, 5 bucks to go in next 2 weeks, hang in longs"
"Don’t want to sound overly optimistic, but at this pace we could hit $40 next week."
"Morgan Stanley upgraded Casa Sytems, Inc. (NASDAQ: CASA) from Equalweight to Overweight with a price target of $23.00.Analyst Meta ..."

"Were holding in there, just building a base before the next surge up."
25% Drop next quarter 0.04 profit = $5.99
Ouch
Weasel management selling shares at the expense of people who work for a living???Not even to raise cash for operations? Diluting at shareholder expense .
"why so much drop,"
Casa Systems is up 13.64% to 4.25
The CFO left the ship.
It looks like Arris wants to buy CASA. What's the premium sell price? Any thoughts?
"Just buy all the 25.6M float for $294M at $11.50 a share. Or even better go private. Now that it is in the $11s, this is a bargain to go private at $20 after buying all the float."
This company should've never been allowed for IPO.
is this going to be like twlo and ntnx and rebound?
Still trying to eliminate trace amounts of FUD that kept me from buying at opening.
Back to 30+
Question... I’m in at 29 still. I wanna have balls of steel but this is frustrating watching it go thru this lol. What yal think? My belief is it’s a strong company with big potential but right now it’s tempting me to sell lol sum advice would be nice
Nice candidate for M&A in 5G. Looking for 16.50 on a buyout. GLTA.
Casa Systems Inc's Quiet Period Will End on January 24th

Yup time for THE move
"I called investor relations today and they will have positive guidance out in a couple of weeks, she said."
"Now is the right time to buy, great software company"
casa got on blowstocks stock site.
"Here's earnings summary.Casa Systems (CASA) reported 2nd Quarter June 2018 earnings of $0.24 per share. The consensus earnings estimate was $0.20 per share on revenue of $90.3 million.The company said it now expects 2018 non-GAAP earnings of $0.80 to $0.88 per share on revenue of $330.0 million to $350.0 million. The company's previous guidance was earnings of $1.08 to $1.19 per share on revenue of $380.0 million to $395.0 million and the current consensus earnings estimate is $1.14 per share on revenue of $389.5 million for the year ending December 31, 2018."
Huge buying opportunity!!!

"Should I get in now or wait for pullback? Like the company, may be not the stock price :)"
based on the offering filling and one year estimate remaining at $33 shares seem to be worth at least $25 right now
Lot of news coming;law firms lining up with lawsuits. Go after the secondary offering I find that suspicious that none of the proceeds went to the company???
"I think lockup expires tomorrow 6/13. Which typically causes a pull back...... we'll see. If so, that's when I plan on getting back in. Good luck all... well not all..... only longs :-)"

Going to take my loss tomorrow. I learned my lesson on that one. Never invest in the stock market unless your liquor cabinet is already fully stocked.

looking like some profits are being taken. probably settle around 11 today and then $12 next week
I wish casa had options available

I’m done with this.Insiders got rich.
earnings today ?
I'm interested in the stocks reaction to earnings today. The last earnings report resulted in a big jump. Hoping for the same this time around. I will be adding today before earnings. Good luck
it looks like forward guidance was below consensus. I guess that is why it is falling?
"Check out this article in lightreading.com (enter Casa Systems in the search option) regarding Netcomm and Casa Systems. ""DIY 5G: In the Future, You Might Install Your Own Cell Tower""."
CASA is such a well positioned company for the present and the future. One hiccup and everyone panics!? Haha! Thank you for the buying opportunity! 
Opinions are appreciated on at what price to get a starting position. Will we see this go below 20?
Shhhhhh... don’t let our little secret under the radar stock be know to Wall Street yet until I can buy even more shares. This thing has enormous potential
Looks like it has touched its bottom. It will go up. The swings in CASA are high. It’s a good time to buy
Looks encouraging that the downturn is over. I expect the recovery to be gradual but I think it's coming. At the present time my feeling is to hang on with the belief that their long term prospects are probably pretty good.
Back in @ 29.25
I will not be surprised if Verizon buys out CASA for $25 to $30.

"$CASA in play. MACD, Stochastic oscillator and RSI go green, according to stoxline."
CEO and Head of investor relations should be fired. No news and the allow for stock held by insiders to sell at share price 6 to 7 dollars less then market price at time they made this announcement. Company has lost my trust and I'm sure others. Hoping earnings and guidance is good or here comes lower share price.
Is there a buyout rumor? Over 1 million traded in the first hour..
"This was the best conference call CASA has had since their IPO. They should make the interim CFO the permanent one, he was very clear and reassuring with his answers, unlike all the previous CFOs who all seemed timid to talk. The results and the outlook look very good, with a lot of conservatism which is needed since they have disappointed multiple times. This stock could be a double from here with some traction in 5G."
"Will be $10's at the end of this month:1) After today, the dust will settle down. With NO news, NO PR... 2) Law suits at the corner. See you again at $10's"
