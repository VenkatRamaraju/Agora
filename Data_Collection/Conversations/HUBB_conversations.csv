"Big firm news today, HUBB announced its detailed performance in the past year. Unlike cash flows, the reported earnings include “accruals”, which is the forecast of benefits not yet collected. see http://www.financial-education-hub.com/1/HUBB. The forecast, however, may have errors. Some companies can even use accruals to manipulate their earnings. As a result, accruals may not be fully realized, leading to high accruals associating with low subsequent cash flows. From this perspective, the higher accruals in a firm’s reported earnings, the more likely it will record poor future earnings."
