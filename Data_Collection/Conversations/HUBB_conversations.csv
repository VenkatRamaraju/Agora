"There is a great deal of utility damage in Florida. Hubbell has all the connectors, insulators that are used by utilities to repair the distribution. It should have a sharp increase in orders right now. The wallboard and insulation companies will have great replacement business too, but it will get those orders months from now, when contractors are available. UTility trucks from all over the country are in Florida right now utilizing all kinds of Hubbell's products. Good time to add."

"Big firm news today, HUBB announced its detailed performance in the past year. Unlike cash flows, the reported earnings include “accruals”, which is the forecast of benefits not yet collected. see http://www.financial-education-hub.com/1/HUBB. The forecast, however, may have errors. Some companies can even use accruals to manipulate their earnings. As a result, accruals may not be fully realized, leading to high accruals associating with low subsequent cash flows. From this perspective, the higher accruals in a firm’s reported earnings, the more likely it will record poor future earnings."
