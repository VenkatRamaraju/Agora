November will be a strong month for stocks and KSS should do well. Clear $50.00 first and $52.00 should come quickly.
"Interesting comments in the new Value Line write-up dated 10/22...Efforts to revamp the women’s business are ongoing. This important category has been underperforming for much of the past two years. It has been feeling the impact from supply chain challenges more acutely than other departments since 70% of the business is private label, and the purchasing team was conservative in its inventory planning early on in the pandemic. This setback was amplified by global supply chain disruptions. As a result, new products are being delayed, which contributed to overall inventory being down about 25% in the fiscal second quarter. In an attempt to right the ship, the leadership team has been changed completely, and Kohl’s severed ties with 10 brands in order to focus on more successful ones."
I am moving my banking from BOA and investment with Merrill next week. I think all KSS shareholders should if you are doing business with BOA.
"It's been a while since I went to Kohls and noticed a big ""big and tall"" mens section. Maybe that's to help fill the extra brick morter space. Not sure how this plan will pencil out. On a side note, quality of clothing is steadily declining over past decade. I've been trading this for years as you know is will have 15 point swings every 6 months. I'll be in around 35 again."
"$92 price target from CFRA today. They're not wrong, plenty other retails have PE's in the 20 range after all.12:00 PM EDT, 10/18/2021 (MT Newswires) -- CFRA, an independent research provider, has provided MT Newswires with the following research alert. Analysts at CFRA have summarized their opinion as follows:We raise our 12-month price target by $42 to $92, based on 13.5x our FY 23 (Jan.) adjusted EPS estimate and a slight discount to KSS's 10-year average forward P/E of 14x. We keep our FY 22 adjusted EPS estimate and raise our FY 23 adjusted EPS estimate by $1.11 to $6.80. In August, Kohl's ( KSS ) posted Q2 adjusted EPS of $2.48 vs. ($0.25), well ahead of the $1.26 estimate. KSS's beat was driven by higher gross margin from tightly managed inventories and a greater percentage of full price selling. The company reduced debt by $1B and repurchased $301M of its shares during the quarter as they continue to improve the balance sheet. We see the company as the top pick in the Department Store sub-industry because of its push towards athleisure, strong digital penetration, 95% of stores off-mall, and much improved balance sheet. The company has also partnered with Sephora to bring the cosmetic retailer to 850 stores (73.1% of store base) by 2023, which should bring more customer into stores and drive top-line sales."
"Not a KSS investor. However, I’m here to note that Lorraine Hutchinson’s analysis are highly suspect. She’s the one at BofA that gave the double downgrade today. She’s also the one that had a PT of $4 on M that was based on made up evidence and she has been eating crow for the past 1-2 years. Has KSS actually said that there are supply chain issues or is she just making this up, too? The SEC and DOJ should take a hard look at her. Her analyses are highly suspect and I think she belongs in jail."
"Kohl's spin-off news, very interesting. this stock should move to 55 fairly quickly"
Amazon destroyed Whole Foods they stopped their Pharmacy division they are lost in the health care area
A few years ago Amazon partnered with BOA (google it). Now BOA downgrades KSS. Amazon to make it's move soon? Perhaps.
Picked up 180 shares in ah
Remember end of month money in flow next week. And generally into first week.
I am wondering what other analyst says about Kohls. I was surprised no rebound for this great company this morning.
"Free Cash Flow per share is strong here. Over 14 per share. Stock trading 3 to 4 times free cash flow. Valuation is cheap. The company should continue to buyback shares and hold a decent Debt/Equity level. I haven't read the analysis from BofA analyst, but if it isn't company specific all retailers will likely see some sales drop vs. 2020/2021 and supply challenges."
unfortunately the stock is going to remain at these levels till the next results unless of course there is some other news item that moves the stock up before that.
$55 by Friday. :D
"OK, before you all tell me I need to learn to take a profit, I know. I'm still ahead in KSS and I'm holding for the EP in early November. The quiet from management is not at all comforting but I'm hoping BofA is generalizing and exaggerating the supply issues. Any thoughts?"
Long KSS through holidays and new year - into Jan. Should be back at $57-60 area.
Supply shortage bs. Kroger Target Walmart kss gps all have goods even bby has 80 percent availability in a week even cost has goods. It’s the little retailer that can’t get goods mom and pops.
Looks like it will reach $40 in next week
"Good day for KSS, more signs of recovery. clear $50.00 and will do nicely into earnings..."
"It appears to me perceived supply constraints are the main reason for the recent downdraft. As ports free up (news item this morning about several CA ports now working 24/7 to relieve the bottlenecks), we'll see SP appreciation here. Nothing wrong fundamentally with the company."
Around 5 million shares retired last qtr
This is an easy $55 by Thanksgiving!!!!!!!!!! Went to a Kohl's today to check things out and plenty of things stocked.
Green on a red day. It's good to buy when oversold.
July 31 2021 qtr kss bought back 258 million dollars in stock
"ALAN, the quality of clothing declining over the past decade? perhaps you should add 20+ more years.Kohl's now has the brands that they couldn't get back in the 80's 90's early 2000's simply by being so to speak last man standing. So their representation is what was once called Main floor, without depts that those long gone dept stores had to have for their reputations and the way the stores had been constructed"
So who come M gets a 14% bump today?? What about these alleged “supply chain issues” for them? Why does KSS have to take a beating instead?
"The company has great earnings, increased guidance and now an analyst manipulates the price to buy in lower. Bring on the lawsuits"
"Went to Kohl’s website to see the supply chain issues cited by BoA. All items I looked for were in stock. If Kohl’s has supply chain issues, it was not apparent from their website."
kohls parking lot was packed and all those weren't az. returns. strong buy. with a nice dividend
"Good time to remain calm and rational. This is BOA, not KSS management making this call. If reasonable portfolio diversification permits, add to lower your basis and hold for a strong retail climate in 2022."
manipulation by BOA bringing retail sector down. Load up cheap today
"Wow big guys buying up shares like crazy,, they know something"
good time for kohls to buy back some stock at this low price. it's will go up from here I added on.
6.50 eps at 13 pe gives u 84 price target spy trading at 20-28 pe.Buy 92 woooooo hoooooo for next year. Share buy backs predicted around 600-800 million bucks until then.
An easy $50 by the first part of November. The 100 cargo ships waiting to unload and the Macys drop today will ease up.
"If Kohl's is worth more than $45, then where is the management? Are they authorized to buy back the stock?"
Supply problems are fixable. Substitutions can be offered etc. Demand problems are more worrisome but that is certainly not the issue here. I just don't know why the board hasn't restored the dividend 
Any reason - relentless selling since last 4 days with no news except for fear of supply constraints?
go go go 48 :)
