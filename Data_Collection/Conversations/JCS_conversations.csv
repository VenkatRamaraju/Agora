"U R ABSOLUTELY CORRECT Basem, shareholders must HOLD thru Oct 15th to receive dividends. I VERIFIED with 2 brokers, call your brokers and mentioned the special 25% or higher stock dividends and ask brokers to research the special rule."
have anyone received the dividends? thx
"Guys, why selloff if we need to wait until 10\18 to get div. Any idea please?"
Any body with E*TRADE got their Div?
"Which is more important ex-date or record date?Dividend ex-date is much more important when it comes to buy or sell of that particular stock, and it affects the dividend benefits from that stock. The record date is only a date, from which the management of the company would get to know the list of the shareholders who will receive the latest announced dividend.It seems, If you sell before 10-18-2021, you may receive the dividend with DUE bill and need to pay back."
Possible. Ex. date is 10/18/2021 and whoever selling now may end up getting due bill.
no divvy in my account today. my broker said it will show up on monday next week due to clearing house process.
"Have anyone with TDAMERITRADE RECEIVED the dividends? I'm with TD and have not seen the dividends..so I can recover some PAPERS loss, thanks guys"
"So tomorrow the price is going to TANK... I can see why people are selling right now, but realize that you might miss the special dividend :/"
" I told folks last month the SP was going to TANK by more than the actual dividend on the day the dividend is paid, because that is how dividends work, especially big ones. Buying a stock and hoping to ""dump"" it right after the dividend is a LOSING strategy because everybody else is trying to do the same thing. So, people paid $8 -$10 to get a $3.50 dividend on a stock now worth $5  Most people took a LOSS or made s few pennies at best just as I predicted. A teachable moment."
"Read the filing https://sec.report/Document/0000897101-21-000760/Furthermore, we have also been pursuing transactions for our real estate and other holdings and recently entered into an agreement to sell our real estate in Hector, Minnesota that we expect to close in October 2021. Like any transactions entered into prior to the closing of the CSI-Pineapple merger transaction, 100% of net proceeds of this real estate transaction will inure to the benefit of the pre-merger CSI shareholders.‚ÄùPossible another dividend coming in October. Just Hold and let shorts pay ..."
"Go to earn div 10 cents per share each month instead of every quarter 10 percent a year no bad, not much change in stock price either"
"Guys, what is happening today? Selling instead of Buying? Any idea?"
"Guys, do you know by any chance if I buy today would I be eligible for div?"
"someone received the dividends, see link https://stocktwits.com/symbol/JCS"
3.50 dividend paid today thus the price drop
Couldnt wait bought back in at 3.75 ;)
"TDAMERITRADE broker said people that bought JCS today could still receive dividends if their brokerage sends in a letter, have u heard this?"
Got my dividend. Great opportunity to buy at 4:90 today
"A dividend worth 50% of the previous close of $6.75 from a company dissolving and 'reverse merging'/morphing into an entirely unrelated line of business (IoT/IT to Solar panels?)? Sounds like a good way to lose money. Buying before ex-dividend then trying to 'dump' right after is not a unique strategy when everybody else is trying to pull the same trick. Everybody else had the SAME idea this morning, judging from the volume. What follows is a massive sell-off when the SP suddenly drops by 50%+ on ex-dividend date, combined with additional 'panic' selling when people that don't understand how dividends impact share prices wake up to find the SP down by $3.50-$4.00 or more (https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/buy-before-dividend-then-sell/). So, pay $8-9 to get a $3.50 on a stock that be worth $3.50 or less on ex dividend. Usually results in lost $$ for everybody but experienced day traders/shorts and algorithm machines - or stocks actually worth HOLDING well after the dividend. I wouldn't go anywhere near this"
"Crazy holding, lost dividend and another 25% to add up..."
anyone received your dividends and what's your platform Broker?
"Per E-trade, today buy is eligible for upcoming dividend."
If I purchase stock on Monday Oct. 11 will I still be in time to receive the dividend?
"ALL,I have confirmed w with 2 Brokers that u have to hold JCS thru OCT 15TH to receive the $3.50 dividends because this is special 25% higher than stock price dividends"
"Basem, what make you believe that JCS is $7 in how long?"
what price is JCS showing on your platform?
"Special Dividends: ""Due Bill"" ProcessIn some cases, special dividends may have different rules than regular dividends concerning the ex-dividend date. If a special dividend is less than 25% of the stock price, standard rules apply regarding the ex-dividend date (ex-date is before the record and pay date). However, if a special dividend is greater than 25% of the stock price*, the ex-dividend date will be after the record date and pay date.In the case of a regular dividend or a special dividend of less than 25% of the share price, one would need to own a stock by the record date in order to be entitled to the dividend. However, this is not the case for special dividends that are more than 25% of the stock price. If one were to sell a stock after the record date but before the ex-dividend date, they would no longer be entitled to the dividend. The shares would be tagged with something called a ""due bill"" which means that the seller is obligated to pay the dividend to the buyer. Likewise, if one were to buy a stock after the record date but before the ex-dividend date (and hold it through the ex-date), they would be entitled to the dividend from the seller.*Please note, the 25% or more rule is a general rule and will not apply in all cases. Certain foreign stock dividends will not follow the rule and some domestic stocks are granted an exclusion. For information regarding regular dividends, please reference KB 47."
"I am with TDAMERITRADE & haven't seen the dividends, any of u have and what's your brokerage?"
"It is my understanding that when this special dividend is paid the share price is reduced by the 3.50 after the close on the 30th. If anyone has better info on this, please let us know."
JCS has $12 Price Target https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/JCS/price-target/
just confirm that you have to hold JCS into Mon 18th or they will revert the dividends
Is this worth holding beyond Monday 10/18?
Etrade has not paid any dividends on this anyone else?
Just backed up the truck.
It seems MM's are holding and processing limited trading. Big Manipulation and just HOLD tight.
"Basem,If I receive dividends on 15th at 5am, can I sell JCS at 6am on 15th? thank u"
this confuses me... it's up in after hours but expected to tank the same amount as the special dividend... so why are people buying???
"today is the last day for shorts to cover if they want to avoid paying the dividend, I won't be surprised to see a significant spike today , Mark this and watch "
JCS provided 35 million for dividends SO their Earnings in 10 days will be GREAT...buy the DIP
