Just imagine if WallstBets and Reddit army jumped in this before September 30 and gets $3.50 a share premium above that. and then sells we all will make bank. Lambos Everyone￼
This is selling like the company like the movie pretty women breaking it up read day trade don’t think about div can’t get out

Tommorrow we hit 10 later in week or next week least 12 . Plan buying more
Rumor circulating that a secondary offering is coming right after that dividend is paid. And that secondary offering it’s going to be 4 to 5 dollars lower after that 3.50 dividend is paid￼. If it sounds too good to be true. it is . nothing is easy in the stock market￼

You get sept 30 due date two weeks can’t go above 11 or bag holders if you no div
Wow
Communications Systems is down 9.12% to 6.58
September 30 is on a Thursday. Here’s what you do. back up the truck September 29 wait for the DIVI. to go into effect and then dump everything the next day. that’s the smart play￼￼
FYI you can sell on the ex dividend date of 9/29 and still be eligible for the shares. I made thr mistake of holding on too long in MMAT and got screwed over. Not this time!
Dilution machine After merger
"Must buy JCS...if u buy at $10 & JCS drops to 6.50 , WHICH IS UNLIKELY, U STILL BREAK EVEN"
Communications Systems is down 6.13% to 4.82
The smart play is buy one day before the September 30 expiration because it will be down much further than today’s current price. back up the truck and load up. then get that 3.50 divi. then sell immediately take the profits. That’s a smart play￼
"Hahaha so funny how clueless Kids these days are dont know 1 #$%$ thing about DOING SOME DD. This will drop? Never. They just released a PR that they are talking about adding there technology to a HUGE phone company for there smartphones and tablets. The partie they merger with already has contracts with APPLE AND SAMSUNG. so you Kids can guess wich of the two it is. This stock has a 7 million oustanding float. When the merger is complete, the combined stockprice is 24 bucks already. Thats only about the combined revenue!! This company is valued 5x lower now. This thing will reach 20 bucks this week. It will skyrocket in AH. Want more info about the merger and smartphone contract, for god sake look at other sites then yahoo full of reddit kids and chasing gamblers. This stock is real. And everything below 15 dollars is absolute steal. And what you think happens when the PR drops about a partnership with Samsung or Apple.. this thing will go to 50 and higher. But ok, you Kids jeep talking about $gme and $amc and let the real investors stay with real stocks. This is a goldmine."

"Investigation on this mergerTo all new traders it's not worth betting on this stock. This has a very high chance of plummeting. Wait till tomorrow atleast before investing. If you are already in at a loss, just take it and wait. This just happened to two other stocks I watched last two weeks and they both dropped huge right afterwards. This is up only from optimism.

Can somebody explain to me how can They give you $3.50 per share if you have shares up to September 30? Does this mean they’re going to plummet the stock the next day over 50%? Replies would be much appreciated￼
"I expect ZERO future sales to government (See Glassdoor comments). Managment's only choice is to rationalize production then immediately sell assets...and do it SOON...before penny purgatory. They have no sales, no R&D, employees abandoning ship, and MBA/6-sigma monkeys at the helm. I bought a few shares on the belief that management correctly understands the situation, but this investment is highly speculative because of management's extremely poor historical performance."

"It is my understanding that when this special dividend is paid the share price is reduced by the 3.50 after the close on the 30th. If anyone has better info on this, please let us know."
What's the special dividend condition?
Must be a misprint? Are they gonna closed the doorsright before pay day? How could a 50 % dividend make sense?

Mottley gave this a 27 dollar PT. Once they drop the PR after the call today, maybe AH, this will run 100% in AH. Just watch it. Seen this a million times before. There is MEGA news coming and its about Samsung or Apple. Both will push this 100% this is a verry easy buy and a absolute steal below 15 dollars. I'll load up as many as i can."

"Perfect cup&handle if you want to make some money today, do it. You can still earn about 10% if you join now. I already made a 20. Good for daytraders..."
"A dividend worth 50% of the previous close of $6.75 from a company dissolving and 'reverse merging'/morphing into an entirely unrelated line of business (IoT/IT to Solar panels?)? Sounds like a good way to lose money. Buying before ex-dividend then trying to 'dump' right after is not a unique strategy when everybody else is trying to pull the same trick. Everybody else had the SAME idea this morning, judging from the volume. What follows is a massive sell-off when the SP suddenly drops by 50%+ on ex-dividend date, combined with additional 'panic' selling when people that don't understand how dividends impact share prices wake up to find the SP down by $3.50-$4.00 or more (https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/buy-before-dividend-then-sell/). So, pay $8-9 to get a $3.50 on a stock that be worth $3.50 or less on ex dividend. Usually results in lost $$ for everybody but experienced day traders/shorts and algorithm machines - or stocks actually worth HOLDING well after the dividend. I wouldn't go anywhere near this"

"They are planning to sell the company piece by piece pre merger. I wonder if they are going to announce next that the merger offer has been withdrawn. If so, this is going to turn into an 'asset play' stock: total price of the existing assets sold piece by piece which will likely put the stock at 5 dollars, or 6 dollars max."
Unusual call option activity $15 calls plus a 3.50 dividend how come nobody’s buying and how come everybody is selling?￼
after hour we'll rumble in the low teens
I heard about JCS the other day on (http://Multistockalerts.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
Are you kidding me? we hit the lottery today my advice to you people. close out your savings accounts all your investments take all that cash put them in this stock . you can’t lose 3.50 dividends are you kidding me above the current price ?we’re going to be rich￼. Even if this goes down much further before September 30 load up back up the truck September 29 buy if it’s low and then hit that sell button and take profits that’s the smart play￼
