"very simple reason that JCS dropped 12% today b/c it skyrocketed 46% yesterday and people just take profit. Just remember, it is impossible for JCS to reduce 35% , people have to buy in to receive $3.50 dividends. It's guaranteed free $$"
we will see a new day high watch it!
Communications Systems is up 6.02% to 4.40
Will close less than $7Just a hype
i've just called my brooker and thry told me that i shold not sell before 18th of Oct to recieve the divedend although the record date is 30th of SEP .. keep this in mind guys .. good uck
no divvy in my account today. my broker said it will show up on monday next week due to clearing house process.

Got in at 8 for the run up next week.
JCS reached a new All Time Low at $2.26
Yield trap day trade let div pass
another divy soon and it might be more than 3.5 bucks/share
Rumor circulating that a secondary offering is coming right after that dividend is paid. And that secondary offering it’s going to be 4 to 5 dollars lower after that 3.50 dividend is paid￼. If it sounds too good to be true. it is . nothing is easy in the stock market￼
", I want to know why JCS  besides it's recovering from last week?"
"got divvy etrade, gotta sell stock"
This stock is goi g to fly
Wow
Communications Systems reached a 52 Week low at 3.63

"FOMO JCS of dividends , jump in before 13"
"Special Dividends: ""Due Bill"" ProcessIn some cases, special dividends may have different rules than regular dividends concerning the ex-dividend date. If a special dividend is less than 25% of the stock price, standard rules apply regarding the ex-dividend date (ex-date is before the record and pay date). However, if a special dividend is greater than 25% of the stock price*, the ex-dividend date will be after the record date and pay date.In the case of a regular dividend or a special dividend of less than 25% of the share price, one would need to own a stock by the record date in order to be entitled to the dividend. However, this is not the case for special dividends that are more than 25% of the stock price. If one were to sell a stock after the record date but before the ex-dividend date, they would no longer be entitled to the dividend. The shares would be tagged with something called a ""due bill"" which means that the seller is obligated to pay the dividend to the buyer. Likewise, if one were to buy a stock after the record date but before the ex-dividend date (and hold it through the ex-date), they would be entitled to the dividend from the seller.*Please note, the 25% or more rule is a general rule and will not apply in all cases. Certain foreign stock dividends will not follow the rule and some domestic stocks are granted an exclusion. For information regarding regular dividends, please reference KB 47."
Made more playing the stock than div when it goes down
fami bro...you should buy $jcs instead famijcs announced special dividend of $3.50 per share
" I told folks last month the SP was going to TANK by more than the actual dividend on the day the dividend is paid, because that is how dividends work, especially big ones. Buying a stock and hoping to ""dump"" it right after the dividend is a LOSING strategy because everybody else is trying to do the same thing. So, people paid $8 -$10 to get a $3.50 dividend on a stock now worth $5  Most people took a LOSS or made s few pennies at best just as I predicted. A teachable moment."
its warming up ..
Dividends erode stock price. Expect a $3.50 drop by 4:15 today

The smart play is buy one day before the September 30 expiration because it will be down much further than today’s current price. back up the truck and load up. then get that 3.50 divi. then sell immediately take the profits. That’s a smart play￼
benefit from the special dividend. I for one just enjoying the trading.

Setting up for a pop to the mid teens tomorrow in pre-market

This will rip next week. Got my price target in check.

Communications Systems is up 13.83% to 4.28
What's the special dividend condition?
your thoughts for EOW price ? mine is 14$
Sept 30 is the date you are supposed to hold to get the div. Oct 15 is the date you will see the money. People hare are morons who are suggesting to hold at least till Oct 15 to get the div. At least as per the Company communication.
"Hahaha so funny how clueless Kids these days are dont know 1 #$%$ thing about DOING SOME DD. This will drop? Never. They just released a PR that they are talking about adding there technology to a HUGE phone company for there smartphones and tablets. The partie they merger with already has contracts with APPLE AND SAMSUNG. so you Kids can guess wich of the two it is. This stock has a 7 million oustanding float. When the merger is complete, the combined stockprice is 24 bucks already. Thats only about the combined revenue!! This company is valued 5x lower now. This thing will reach 20 bucks this week. It will skyrocket in AH. Want more info about the merger and smartphone contract, for god sake look at other sites then yahoo full of reddit kids and chasing gamblers. This stock is real. And everything below 15 dollars is absolute steal. And what you think happens when the PR drops about a partnership with Samsung or Apple.. this thing will go to 50 and higher. But ok, you Kids jeep talking about $gme and $amc and let the real investors stay with real stocks. This is a goldmine."

what price is JCS showing on your platform?
"Which is more important ex-date or record date?Dividend ex-date is much more important when it comes to buy or sell of that particular stock, and it affects the dividend benefits from that stock. The record date is only a date, from which the management of the company would get to know the list of the shareholders who will receive the latest announced dividend.It seems, If you sell before 10-18-2021, you may receive the dividend with DUE bill and need to pay back."
I heard about JCS the other day on (http://Multistockalerts.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
JCS reached a new All Time Low at $2.72
"I am happy for every share being sold from now till Oct 18th because this will make our dividend bigger, you sell now you do not take dividend and who buy now doesn't get it too , it goes for us the holders from Sep 30th to Oct 18th"
"I expect ZERO future sales to government (See Glassdoor comments). Managment's only choice is to rationalize production then immediately sell assets...and do it SOON...before penny purgatory. They have no sales, no R&D, employees abandoning ship, and MBA/6-sigma monkeys at the helm. I bought a few shares on the belief that management correctly understands the situation, but this investment is highly speculative because of management's extremely poor historical performance."

"OFFICIAL MESSAGE so no more confusion: Special Dividend – Ex-Dividend Date October 18thPosted by CSI on September 23rd, 2021On September 13, 2021, Communications Systems, Inc. (“CSI”) issued a press release announcing that its board of directors had declared a special dividend of $3.50 per share payable on October 15, 2021, to CSI shareholders of record at the close of business on September 30, 2021. Because the dividend exceeded 25% of the market price on the day we announced the dividend, we have been advised by Nasdaq that the ex-dividend date will be October 18, 2021, the first business day after the October 15, 2021 payment date. Our paying agent processes dividends based on the September 30, 2021 record date and then Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (“DTCC”) will handle any situations where the stock trades hands after the record date and prior to the ex-dividend date. As the issuer, CSI does not control this process, and will not give any legal advice about market rules. We recommend you contact your market professional or contact Mr. O’Neil Blake of Nasdaq at 203-926-3518 with any questions you may have about this processhttps://www.commsystems.com/2021/09/23/special-dividend-ex-dividend-date-october-18th/"
"5.4 million shares where are they going, a lot of day traders"
Load up September 29 and dump all your shares the day after the dividend is paid also plays Bearish puts the week before $4to 5 dollars lower than the current price there you go ! you win both ways￼
JCS is down 8.32% to 8.70
Dividend don’t kick in till sept 30
100$ end of September
people are holding and new investors are getting in .. being green in such day is huge !!!!
"Crazy holding, lost dividend and another 25% to add up..."
It seems MM's are holding and processing limited trading. Big Manipulation and just HOLD tight.
"So Isn't there a ""redemption due bill date"" that is the FINAL day to get in for this special dividend?I ask because my broker told me ""You will get the special dividend if you buy on the pay date and hold for ""X"" amount of time"" for RVI's special dividend and its a few days after its paydate and ex-date any reason why this is?I'm Canadian so maybe that's why??? who knows"
JCS provided 35 million for dividends SO their Earnings in 10 days will be GREAT...buy the DIP
https://trendytoros.com/stocks/opinions/jcs/
"A dividend worth 50% of the previous close of $6.75 from a company dissolving and 'reverse merging'/morphing into an entirely unrelated line of business (IoT/IT to Solar panels?)? Sounds like a good way to lose money. Buying before ex-dividend then trying to 'dump' right after is not a unique strategy when everybody else is trying to pull the same trick. Everybody else had the SAME idea this morning, judging from the volume. What follows is a massive sell-off when the SP suddenly drops by 50%+ on ex-dividend date, combined with additional 'panic' selling when people that don't understand how dividends impact share prices wake up to find the SP down by $3.50-$4.00 or more (https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/buy-before-dividend-then-sell/). So, pay $8-9 to get a $3.50 on a stock that be worth $3.50 or less on ex dividend. Usually results in lost $$ for everybody but experienced day traders/shorts and algorithm machines - or stocks actually worth HOLDING well after the dividend. I wouldn't go anywhere near this"
Not even 200 reactions yet…. Just wait till tomorrow…t-minus pre market
Sold the stock should at reached 13 but never did .
After hour will see above $10+
"U R ABSOLUTELY CORRECT Basem, shareholders must HOLD thru Oct 15th to receive dividends. I VERIFIED with 2 brokers, call your brokers and mentioned the special 25% or higher stock dividends and ask brokers to research the special rule."
I don't predict a big sell off .. we might keep between 7.5 to 8 till after payout then it will climb again for the 2nd special dividend
"The problem is if you can get out of the stock fast enough, had it happen to me, called a yield trap, I day trade these stocks, be careful"
