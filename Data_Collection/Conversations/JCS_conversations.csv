if you read the article puplished on Aug 3rd you will see clearly that there are more sales and dividend are on the way
Reminds me dks. Ran from 118 to 149 7.5 dividends. So point is least 14 or more before ex dividend
feeling hopeful
"today is the last day for shorts to cover if they want to avoid paying the dividend, I won't be surprised to see a significant spike today , Mark this and watch "
"So tomorrow the price is going to TANK... I can see why people are selling right now, but realize that you might miss the special dividend :/"
I'm thinking JDL and Transition are on the block.

"Special Dividends: ""Due Bill"" ProcessIn some cases, special dividends may have different rules than regular dividends concerning the ex-dividend date. If a special dividend is less than 25% of the stock price, standard rules apply regarding the ex-dividend date (ex-date is before the record and pay date). However, if a special dividend is greater than 25% of the stock price*, the ex-dividend date will be after the record date and pay date.In the case of a regular dividend or a special dividend of less than 25% of the share price, one would need to own a stock by the record date in order to be entitled to the dividend. However, this is not the case for special dividends that are more than 25% of the stock price. If one were to sell a stock after the record date but before the ex-dividend date, they would no longer be entitled to the dividend. The shares would be tagged with something called a ""due bill"" which means that the seller is obligated to pay the dividend to the buyer. Likewise, if one were to buy a stock after the record date but before the ex-dividend date (and hold it through the ex-date), they would be entitled to the dividend from the seller.*Please note, the 25% or more rule is a general rule and will not apply in all cases. Certain foreign stock dividends will not follow the rule and some domestic stocks are granted an exclusion. For information regarding regular dividends, please reference KB 47."

"Guys, do you have any idea why is it dropping so much instead of growing amid dividends?"
"Hahaha so funny how clueless Kids these days are dont know 1 #$%$ thing about DOING SOME DD. This will drop? Never. They just released a PR that they are talking about adding there technology to a HUGE phone company for there smartphones and tablets. The partie they merger with already has contracts with APPLE AND SAMSUNG. so you Kids can guess wich of the two it is. This stock has a 7 million oustanding float. When the merger is complete, the combined stockprice is 24 bucks already. Thats only about the combined revenue!! This company is valued 5x lower now. This thing will reach 20 bucks this week. It will skyrocket in AH. Want more info about the merger and smartphone contract, for god sake look at other sites then yahoo full of reddit kids and chasing gamblers. This stock is real. And everything below 15 dollars is absolute steal. And what you think happens when the PR drops about a partnership with Samsung or Apple.. this thing will go to 50 and higher. But ok, you Kids jeep talking about $gme and $amc and let the real investors stay with real stocks. This is a goldmine."

Wow

https://trendytoros.com/stocks/opinions/jcs/
The smart play is buy one day before the September 30 expiration because it will be down much further than today’s current price. back up the truck and load up. then get that 3.50 divi. then sell immediately take the profits. That’s a smart play￼

"Guys, what is happening today? Selling instead of Buying? Any idea?"
This will rip next week. Got my price target in check.
I don't predict a big sell off .. we might keep between 7.5 to 8 till after payout then it will climb again for the 2nd special dividend
"just REMEMBER, If U SELL IT FOR QUICK PROFIT, IT WILL BE LESS THAN $3.50/SHARE U getting in 2 weeks or U HAVE TO BUY BACK"
"U R ABSOLUTELY CORRECT Basem, shareholders must HOLD thru Oct 15th to receive dividends. I VERIFIED with 2 brokers, call your brokers and mentioned the special 25% or higher stock dividends and ask brokers to research the special rule."
this extreamly low float can take us to 30 bucks in no time yuppppeeeee
Must be a misprint? Are they gonna closed the doorsright before pay day? How could a 50 % dividend make sense?
Load up September 29 and dump all your shares the day after the dividend is paid also plays Bearish puts the week before $4to 5 dollars lower than the current price there you go ! you win both ways￼
Anything goes up everything will fall back to new low
"I expect ZERO future sales to government (See Glassdoor comments). Managment's only choice is to rationalize production then immediately sell assets...and do it SOON...before penny purgatory. They have no sales, no R&D, employees abandoning ship, and MBA/6-sigma monkeys at the helm. I bought a few shares on the belief that management correctly understands the situation, but this investment is highly speculative because of management's extremely poor historical performance."
"Which is more important ex-date or record date?Dividend ex-date is much more important when it comes to buy or sell of that particular stock, and it affects the dividend benefits from that stock. The record date is only a date, from which the management of the company would get to know the list of the shareholders who will receive the latest announced dividend.It seems, If you sell before 10-18-2021, you may receive the dividend with DUE bill and need to pay back."
why wouldn't a whale buy up the entire float if they're guaranteed $3.50 per share?
Can somebody explain to me how can They give you $3.50 per share if you have shares up to September 30? Does this mean they’re going to plummet the stock the next day over 50%? Replies would be much appreciated￼
"So Isn't there a ""redemption due bill date"" that is the FINAL day to get in for this special dividend?I ask because my broker told me ""You will get the special dividend if you buy on the pay date and hold for ""X"" amount of time"" for RVI's special dividend and its a few days after its paydate and ex-date any reason why this is?I'm Canadian so maybe that's why??? who knows"

"OFFICIAL MESSAGE so no more confusion: Special Dividend – Ex-Dividend Date October 18thPosted by CSI on September 23rd, 2021On September 13, 2021, Communications Systems, Inc. (“CSI”) issued a press release announcing that its board of directors had declared a special dividend of $3.50 per share payable on October 15, 2021, to CSI shareholders of record at the close of business on September 30, 2021. Because the dividend exceeded 25% of the market price on the day we announced the dividend, we have been advised by Nasdaq that the ex-dividend date will be October 18, 2021, the first business day after the October 15, 2021 payment date. Our paying agent processes dividends based on the September 30, 2021 record date and then Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (“DTCC”) will handle any situations where the stock trades hands after the record date and prior to the ex-dividend date. As the issuer, CSI does not control this process, and will not give any legal advice about market rules. We recommend you contact your market professional or contact Mr. O’Neil Blake of Nasdaq at 203-926-3518 with any questions you may have about this processhttps://www.commsystems.com/2021/09/23/special-dividend-ex-dividend-date-october-18th/"
Made more playing the stock than div when it goes down
Sept 30 is the date you are supposed to hold to get the div. Oct 15 is the date you will see the money. People hare are morons who are suggesting to hold at least till Oct 15 to get the div. At least as per the Company communication.

Will close less than $7Just a hype
"A dividend worth 50% of the previous close of $6.75 from a company dissolving and 'reverse merging'/morphing into an entirely unrelated line of business (IoT/IT to Solar panels?)? Sounds like a good way to lose money. Buying before ex-dividend then trying to 'dump' right after is not a unique strategy when everybody else is trying to pull the same trick. Everybody else had the SAME idea this morning, judging from the volume. What follows is a massive sell-off when the SP suddenly drops by 50%+ on ex-dividend date, combined with additional 'panic' selling when people that don't understand how dividends impact share prices wake up to find the SP down by $3.50-$4.00 or more (https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/buy-before-dividend-then-sell/). So, pay $8-9 to get a $3.50 on a stock that be worth $3.50 or less on ex dividend. Usually results in lost $$ for everybody but experienced day traders/shorts and algorithm machines - or stocks actually worth HOLDING well after the dividend. I wouldn't go anywhere near this"
"Per E-trade, today buy is eligible for upcoming dividend."

stock price wouldn't fall by corresponding amount. Read how dividend get funded.
There is the jump... matter of time before PR Apple/Samsung drops. This will be a 20+ dollar stock this week qith a 7 million shares outstanding float haha. This can co CRAZY.
Rumor circulating that a secondary offering is coming right after that dividend is paid. And that secondary offering it’s going to be 4 to 5 dollars lower after that 3.50 dividend is paid￼. If it sounds too good to be true. it is . nothing is easy in the stock market￼
"You all have not seen that the new Ex-Div date is Oct 18th? 3 days after they pay you the Div? You must be shareholder of record on Sept 30th. Then if you do not have on Oct 18th, you will pay back that Div. Good luck!"
