" I told folks last month the SP was going to TANK by more than the actual dividend on the day the dividend is paid, because that is how dividends work, especially big ones. Buying a stock and hoping to ""dump"" it right after the dividend is a LOSING strategy because everybody else is trying to do the same thing. So, people paid $8 -$10 to get a $3.50 dividend on a stock now worth $5  Most people took a LOSS or made s few pennies at best just as I predicted. A teachable moment."
Are you kidding me? we hit the lottery today my advice to you people. close out your savings accounts all your investments take all that cash put them in this stock . you can’t lose 3.50 dividends are you kidding me above the current price ?we’re going to be rich￼. Even if this goes down much further before September 30 load up back up the truck September 29 buy if it’s low and then hit that sell button and take profits that’s the smart play￼
Dividends erode stock price. Expect a $3.50 drop by 4:15 today
this confuses me... it's up in after hours but expected to tank the same amount as the special dividend... so why are people buying???
Can somebody explain to me how can They give you $3.50 per share if you have shares up to September 30? Does this mean they’re going to plummet the stock the next day over 50%? Replies would be much appreciated￼
What's the special dividend condition?
"I am with TDAMERITRADE & haven't seen the dividends, any of u have and what's your brokerage?"
everyone is alive? This thing gonna pop hard with 3.5/share dividend
"Must buy JCS...if u buy at $10 & JCS drops to 6.50 , WHICH IS UNLIKELY, U STILL BREAK EVEN"
"power hour push, lets gooooooo!"
in fact why are people trading JCS the last 7 days?
There is no such thing as free money we knew that dividend had a catch with it￼.
Loving the low volume when markets so terrible. Just roll through to divedend baby at around this price and will be a happy camper.
"Come on no divv it will drop 4,points and you can’t get our not a shortly day trade"
JCS will do settle in 10 days after the dividends volatility https://fostersleader.com/2021/09/28/communications-systems-inc-jcs-keep-paying-attention-to-its-insider-activity/
still waiting on my divedend to buy more!
The smart play is buy one day before the September 30 expiration because it will be down much further than today’s current price. back up the truck and load up. then get that 3.50 divi. then sell immediately take the profits. That’s a smart play￼
"Blaine they already closed deal selling assets my thought only, read article close, maybe I’m not right but thats how I understand it, closed deal in aug"
"Guys, why selloff if we need to wait until 10\18 to get div. Any idea please?"
"tik tak tik tak .. time is running , shorties will pay the divedend if they do not cover before 30th"
Etrade has not paid any dividends on this anyone else?
", I want to know why JCS  besides it's recovering from last week?"
Is this worth holding beyond Monday 10/18?
"It is my understanding that when this special dividend is paid the share price is reduced by the 3.50 after the close on the 30th. If anyone has better info on this, please let us know."
JCS has $12 Price Target https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/JCS/price-target/

"OFFICIAL MESSAGE so no more confusion: Special Dividend – Ex-Dividend Date October 18thPosted by CSI on September 23rd, 2021On September 13, 2021, Communications Systems, Inc. (“CSI”) issued a press release announcing that its board of directors had declared a special dividend of $3.50 per share payable on October 15, 2021, to CSI shareholders of record at the close of business on September 30, 2021. Because the dividend exceeded 25% of the market price on the day we announced the dividend, we have been advised by Nasdaq that the ex-dividend date will be October 18, 2021, the first business day after the October 15, 2021 payment date. Our paying agent processes dividends based on the September 30, 2021 record date and then Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (“DTCC”) will handle any situations where the stock trades hands after the record date and prior to the ex-dividend date. As the issuer, CSI does not control this process, and will not give any legal advice about market rules. We recommend you contact your market professional or contact Mr. O’Neil Blake of Nasdaq at 203-926-3518 with any questions you may have about this processhttps://www.commsystems.com/2021/09/23/special-dividend-ex-dividend-date-october-18th/"
"The problem is if you can get out of the stock fast enough, had it happen to me, called a yield trap, I day trade these stocks, be careful"
anyone received your dividends and what's your platform Broker?
Communications Systems reached a 52 Week low at 3.63
"So Isn't there a ""redemption due bill date"" that is the FINAL day to get in for this special dividend?I ask because my broker told me ""You will get the special dividend if you buy on the pay date and hold for ""X"" amount of time"" for RVI's special dividend and its a few days after its paydate and ex-date any reason why this is?I'm Canadian so maybe that's why??? who knows"
Load up September 29 and dump all your shares the day after the dividend is paid also plays Bearish puts the week before $4to 5 dollars lower than the current price there you go ! you win both ways￼
all analysts suggested BUY on JCS
I couldn’t be happier with the daily emails I get from (http://Fairstox.com). They give me the best daily advice based on stock market news and help me make wiser decisions when it comes to investing. An absolute must for any investor!
people are holding and new investors are getting in .. being green in such day is huge !!!!
Do not listen to Rick or anybody because NOBODY knows how stock will turn out...
"very simple reason that JCS dropped 12% today b/c it skyrocketed 46% yesterday and people just take profit. Just remember, it is impossible for JCS to reduce 35% , people have to buy in to receive $3.50 dividends. It's guaranteed free $$"
benefit from the special dividend. I for one just enjoying the trading.
there's good news in the making FOR SURE
Rumor circulating that a secondary offering is coming right after that dividend is paid. And that secondary offering it’s going to be 4 to 5 dollars lower after that 3.50 dividend is paid￼. If it sounds too good to be true. it is . nothing is easy in the stock market￼
This is selling like the company like the movie pretty women breaking it up read day trade don’t think about div can’t get out
Unusual call option activity $15 calls plus a 3.50 dividend how come nobody’s buying and how come everybody is selling?￼
"Basem, what make you believe that JCS is $7 in how long?"
JCS provided 35 million for dividends SO their Earnings in 10 days will be GREAT...buy the DIP
"If you’re looking for a short and sweet guide to the day’s biggest news, I recommend (http://Rightpicker.com). They breakdown the most important pre-market news and it only takes a few minutes to read."
no divvy in my account today. my broker said it will show up on monday next week due to clearing house process.
"today is the last day for shorts to cover if they want to avoid paying the dividend, I won't be surprised to see a significant spike today , Mark this and watch "
Communications Systems is up 13.83% to 4.28
thanks for playingsee you later
Dilution machine After merger
"Have anyone with TDAMERITRADE RECEIVED the dividends? I'm with TD and have not seen the dividends..so I can recover some PAPERS loss, thanks guys"
190k shorted shares still not covered .. the free float is just 3.5 Ml shares most of them are on hold because of the dividend.. we might see something huge here .
"TDAMERITRADE broker said people that bought JCS today could still receive dividends if their brokerage sends in a letter, have u heard this?"
Just backed up the truck.
Ru kidding me? B? 3.50 DIVIDEND. For each share? We are all going to be rich and Lambos for everyone will be paid for in cash￼! We will all be cruising together
$3.5div plus another $2? Once they sell rest of assests? Can anyone confirm?
what price is JCS showing on your platform?
I had a PT of 12 but it might rip pass that by Monday. Fun times ahead!

"5.4 million shares where are they going, a lot of day traders"
I don't predict a big sell off .. we might keep between 7.5 to 8 till after payout then it will climb again for the 2nd special dividend
 Top Bullish Charts | September 2021 https://stockreport.tips/Bullish-Charts
I hope I’m wrong but at a average 6.50 to 7.00 dollar stock 3.50 div don’t make sense
Communications Systems is down 38.98% to 5.15
fami bro...you should buy $jcs instead famijcs announced special dividend of $3.50 per share
Why is the pre going down? ??
Dividend don’t kick in till sept 30
4$ level incoming…
"They are planning to sell the company piece by piece pre merger. I wonder if they are going to announce next that the merger offer has been withdrawn. If so, this is going to turn into an 'asset play' stock: total price of the existing assets sold piece by piece which will likely put the stock at 5 dollars, or 6 dollars max."
"am still on my word , this will go back to +7 so quickly .."
"A dividend worth 50% of the previous close of $6.75 from a company dissolving and 'reverse merging'/morphing into an entirely unrelated line of business (IoT/IT to Solar panels?)? Sounds like a good way to lose money. Buying before ex-dividend then trying to 'dump' right after is not a unique strategy when everybody else is trying to pull the same trick. Everybody else had the SAME idea this morning, judging from the volume. What follows is a massive sell-off when the SP suddenly drops by 50%+ on ex-dividend date, combined with additional 'panic' selling when people that don't understand how dividends impact share prices wake up to find the SP down by $3.50-$4.00 or more (https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/buy-before-dividend-then-sell/). So, pay $8-9 to get a $3.50 on a stock that be worth $3.50 or less on ex dividend. Usually results in lost $$ for everybody but experienced day traders/shorts and algorithm machines - or stocks actually worth HOLDING well after the dividend. I wouldn't go anywhere near this"
"So tomorrow the price is going to TANK... I can see why people are selling right now, but realize that you might miss the special dividend :/"
After hour will see above $10+
"Crazy holding, lost dividend and another 25% to add up..."
day traders are outget in here
"I am happy for every share being sold from now till Oct 18th because this will make our dividend bigger, you sell now you do not take dividend and who buy now doesn't get it too , it goes for us the holders from Sep 30th to Oct 18th"
this extreamly low float can take us to 30 bucks in no time yuppppeeeee
"U R ABSOLUTELY CORRECT Basem, shareholders must HOLD thru Oct 15th to receive dividends. I VERIFIED with 2 brokers, call your brokers and mentioned the special 25% or higher stock dividends and ask brokers to research the special rule."
"Per E-trade, today buy is eligible for upcoming dividend."
Stock is holding up despite the market is getting pounded by the China Evergrande fiasco. We're gonna make some bread.
Got my dividend. Great opportunity to buy at 4:90 today
why wouldn't a whale buy up the entire float if they're guaranteed $3.50 per share?
Quick question can you sell sept 30 in after hours trade and it count
This will rip next week. Got my price target in check.
cover them now…ex date is mon next week
"Guys, do you know by any chance if I buy today would I be eligible for div?"
It seems MM's are holding and processing limited trading. Big Manipulation and just HOLD tight.
It's about to squeeze.. get in before it goes nuts!

I heard about JCS the other day on (http://Multistockalerts.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
Couldnt wait bought back in at 3.75 ;)
3.50 dividend paid today thus the price drop
"Go to earn div 10 cents per share each month instead of every quarter 10 percent a year no bad, not much change in stock price either"
"Div on 10/15, ex date 10/18, own by 9/30"
Got in at 8 for the run up next week.
Wow! 0 shares to borrow
I'm a buyer again at 3.5
Fidelity Confirmed open @ 4.94!!
JCS price 4.94https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/goto/evaluate/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=JCS&type=sq-NavBar
"latest updates shows 300k shorted shares , they should cover before th ex date otherwise they'll pay the dividend too .. this is another reason why I expect a spike before the 18th .. Mark this"
"3.9$ may be a good entry point, still risky."
Sept 30 is the date you are supposed to hold to get the div. Oct 15 is the date you will see the money. People hare are morons who are suggesting to hold at least till Oct 15 to get the div. At least as per the Company communication.
That volume..
No one is selling here. It seems shorts are selling here to scare us. Just hold and squeeze the shorts with in 2 weeks.

Overreacting sellers can make you MONEY! Time to Load Up :)
"It will not go down They will pay 3.5 dividends so never will go down or else how they will pay the dividends 3.5 dollars per share, wake up folks it is time to hold"
Buy. Buy. It may reach $35 before 09-30-2021
just confirm that you have to hold JCS into Mon 18th or they will revert the dividends
"Should you accumulate JCS - Communications Systems, Inc. Stock Today? See details: https://goo.io/Investing.com"
If I purchase stock on Monday Oct. 11 will I still be in time to receive the dividend?
Just imagine if WallstBets and Reddit army jumped in this before September 30 and gets $3.50 a share premium above that. and then sells we all will make bank. Lambos Everyone￼
Any body with E*TRADE got their Div?
buying me least 1000 shares today love 3.5/share dividend at 9 dollar stock never hear nice payoff
a short squeeze in any day next 10 days
"Mcafee had a 4.50 one time div, look at their price before and after I think around aug 12 but not sure, ori same 1.50 special div this week"
stock price wouldn't fall by corresponding amount. Read how dividend get funded.
"Guys, what is happening today? Selling instead of Buying? Any idea?"
FYI you can sell on the ex dividend date of 9/29 and still be eligible for the shares. I made thr mistake of holding on too long in MMAT and got screwed over. Not this time!
They wait for Retail holders to sell then they bring it up￼
"You all have not seen that the new Ex-Div date is Oct 18th? 3 days after they pay you the Div? You must be shareholder of record on Sept 30th. Then if you do not have on Oct 18th, you will pay back that Div. Good luck!"
"Which is more important ex-date or record date?Dividend ex-date is much more important when it comes to buy or sell of that particular stock, and it affects the dividend benefits from that stock. The record date is only a date, from which the management of the company would get to know the list of the shareholders who will receive the latest announced dividend.It seems, If you sell before 10-18-2021, you may receive the dividend with DUE bill and need to pay back."
Not even 200 reactions yet…. Just wait till tomorrow…t-minus pre market
"Special Dividends: ""Due Bill"" ProcessIn some cases, special dividends may have different rules than regular dividends concerning the ex-dividend date. If a special dividend is less than 25% of the stock price, standard rules apply regarding the ex-dividend date (ex-date is before the record and pay date). However, if a special dividend is greater than 25% of the stock price*, the ex-dividend date will be after the record date and pay date.In the case of a regular dividend or a special dividend of less than 25% of the share price, one would need to own a stock by the record date in order to be entitled to the dividend. However, this is not the case for special dividends that are more than 25% of the stock price. If one were to sell a stock after the record date but before the ex-dividend date, they would no longer be entitled to the dividend. The shares would be tagged with something called a ""due bill"" which means that the seller is obligated to pay the dividend to the buyer. Likewise, if one were to buy a stock after the record date but before the ex-dividend date (and hold it through the ex-date), they would be entitled to the dividend from the seller.*Please note, the 25% or more rule is a general rule and will not apply in all cases. Certain foreign stock dividends will not follow the rule and some domestic stocks are granted an exclusion. For information regarding regular dividends, please reference KB 47."
