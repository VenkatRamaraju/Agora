"Huge questions going into earnings...can they show a reversal of revenue growth declines. This stock is going to move, one way or another on that question. What will be left in the overhang of the government investigations...resolve those on the heels of a good quarter and this is a $30 stock. Lots of big ""if's""! I still feel like this Board is primed to offload this baby given the chance."

"CSII beats eps, misses on revenue due to pandemic issues at hospitals. If this pandemic hadn't hit, they were on their way to over $70MM in qtly revenue, a big beat. The company is doing well in this environment , has fantastic management , is conservative with their projections and guidance and is a critical care company. Give it 5-10 years and it will be a MUCH bigger company ."
