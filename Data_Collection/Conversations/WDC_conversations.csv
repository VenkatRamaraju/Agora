"After yesterday, WDC was defo a good tax loss selling candidate.Got even better today"
Buying opportunity. Paid down close to a billion in debt a few days ago.
"Wells Fargo analyst Aaron Rakers lowered the firm's price target on Western Digital to $80 from $100 and keeps an Overweight rating on the shares. While the analyst is frustrated following the Q1 results, Rakers tells investors in a research note that he is unable to overlook the valuation disconnect presented in shares, and thinks this should catalyze a ""something needs to give"" call."
"What are the predictions for earnings, revenues, guidance, and other ideas of consolidation prospects?"
Gotta say David and Bob are 2 of the poorest commentators and trying to put a positive spin on lower Guidance Q-on-Q.Unless they're deliberately trying to sandbag the quarter.Tomorrow is going to hurt.I see people hear talk about averaging down.....I'd probably wait until after the next ER. They didn't seem too convincing the current qtr was going to be the bottom.Man....I'm stuck in this for another 12m before I breakeven.
I would think we get some kind of rally here before earnings tomorrow. Just guessing at least some shorts would want to cover and some others speculating on blowout results
"I've added to my position on Friday at $ 50.16 and I regret I haven't add more.IMO Friday's price collapse was very irrational.Look at WDC earnings on Jan 28, 2021 :the price before earnings - $52.65earnings results - rev. $3.94B, EPS $0.69guidance - rev. $3.95B, EPS $0.65The next day WDC opened at $58.65 (+11.4%) , in the next 4 weeks price reached $72.98.And now compare these numbers to the latest ER - rev. $5.05B, EPS $2.49 and guidance - rev. $4.8B, EPS $2.1.The guidance, which is lower than actual quarter's numbers, is at first look dissapointing, but it cannot justify such a low price. If the guidance is correct, it's still ttm EPS $7.77, after the next quarter even more than $8.5."
"After analysed the report, my supercompute raised the target of WDC from $60 to $95"
"Earnings beat, with lukewarm guidance... particular to HDDs.... and the throng runs for the door like a house on fire, leaving their coats behind. Meanwhile several of the levelheaded setup shop and started selling coats. RSI 35. Would be interesting to know who is doing all the buying."
"So are our GM in the HDD segment expected to be opposite to STX?If not, then I don't see why the following narrative wouldn't apply to WDC(released a couple of hours ago)Loop Capital analyst Ananda Baruah raised the firm's price target on Seagate to $110 from $100 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares. The company generated a ""very clean"" Q1 earnings eat and he sees an opportunity for the stock to re-rate ""materially higher"" in 2022 when its gross margins strengthen, the analyst tells investors in a research note. Baruah adds that in speaking with investors, the potential for a Seagate valuation re-rating is not their ""current mindset""."
"At Wells Fargo, analyst Aaron Rogers said that Facebook's (FB) capital expense plans are likely to been seen as positive for cloud-based spending and companies providing the technology behind many cloud-based enterprise efforts. Rakers cited hard-disk drive makers Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) and Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) as beneficiaries of Facebook's cloud expansion strategy."
I guess it won't matter much if WDC earns more than STX.
STX guided 3.1bn mid point for next qtr. WDC didn't flatly deny 2.25bn for HDD. STX is guiding to bag almost 900m more over the next qtr.WDC losing market share? O wrong mix?
"Report looked good, my be the forward statement was on the light side. Also, looked like they had C-19 disruptions that hurt production because of lack of some materials. Time to buy more.Way under valued! Data centers are still red hot, they will recover!!"
"We survived the wave of selling at the open and now only down about 9%. In no way suggesting any down day is positive, but this setup is very similar to what happened when Micron reported. Big down day following announcement and over the course of the next few weeks it has recovered everything it lost. Let's see if this repeats here. As someone else said, several lowered price targets but have not seen any downgrades yet this morning so maybe people are realizing how cheap the stock really is at these levels. We'll see."
"Funny thing about that call was, most of the questions centered around the HDD business, and that it seemed over 10pc weaker in the next qtr. Bob and Dave pretty much nodded to everything the analysts tried to attribute the weaker guidance towards. In fact on more than one occasion, I think they actually made things worse.There's only 2 players in HDD. Why didn't STX paint a similar picture? Better relation with their supply chain partners to secure controllers ahead of WDC? NAND actually looks flat if not stronger.Is STX painting an overly optimistic picture?"
What am I missing ? All analysts have maintained their buy ratings with prices between $70-100
"For WD, debt $7.7 billion & cash about $ 3 billion.For STX, debt $ 5 billion & cash less than one billion.So what is the reason for not paying any dividend?"
Looks like we get a move higher here??? Option prices for calls have ratcheted up. Maybe we follow stx higher?
"None of this makes any sense on a valuation perspective. Even if estimates get cut from the current $10+ down to $8 and you give it the same 8x multiple you are giving to Micron, we are still way off from where this stock should trade. I know markets can be irrational, but this type of selling pre-earnings is really hard to understand. Either they are trying one last push to flush all the weak hands, or someone knows something ominous about tomorrow's release."
