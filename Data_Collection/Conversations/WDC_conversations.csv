"In other relevant news, the Chinese boogeyman ain't so big and bad as it's been portrayed:YMTC sees low yield rates for 128-layer 3D NAND flashChina's Yangtze Memory Technologies (YMTC) continues to suffer from low yield rates for 128-layer 3D NAND flash manufacturing, which are estimated at only 30-40%, according to market sources.https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20210824PD210.html"
"3Q21 NAND projections: Moving on UP""Moving into 3Q21, clients in the data center segment will gradually become the main growth driver as they expand procurement of high-density enterprise SSDs. Furthermore, notebook demand is expected to remain at a fairly high level in 3Q21, thereby sustaining NAND Flash demand bit growth and the ongoing rise in contract prices of NAND Flash products. Hence, TrendForce currently forecasts that the quarterly total NAND Flash revenue will not only again register a QoQ increase but also hit a record high for 3Q21."""
"Seagate, Western Digital weakness attributed to Edgewater Research report 11:41 STX, WDC The weakness in shares of Seagate Technology (STX) and Western Digital (WDC) is being attributed to a report from Edgewater Research analyst Kevin Rottinghaus. The analyst wrote, according to Bloomberg, that he is taking a ""more cautious stance"" on both companies given the ""multiple risks"" to hard disk drive demand in the third and fourth quarters. Rottinghaus says the ""messy"" supply chain makes it difficult to determine real end demand and that Seagate is likely to continue ceding share in the near-term. Shares of Western Digital are down 3% to $60.14 while Seagate is down 7% to $85.67 in midday trading."
"Once again, we bemoan the apparent undervaluation of WDC to it's kin. Having done this several times in the past, why not again? What should WDC be valued at?The HDD segment may be the most straightforward. From STX, let's just use a revenue comparison and factor from EV. STX rev last qtr was $3Bill, WDC HDD rev was $2.5Bill. STX EV is $23.63Bill. Therefore, WDC HDD segment EV might be $23.63Bill*2.5/3 = $19.7Bill EV. Since WDC is about 50/50 between HDD/Flash, take out 50% of the debt to get a WDC HDD MV = $15.5BillThe Flash segment is a bit more subjective. Let's use the 3 data points most comparable: Intel, MU and the $20Bill 50/50 number being thrown out around Kioxia.Intel sold their 6.7% market share for $9Bill to SKH. WDC NAND market share is 14.7%. Therefore, based upon INTC, WDC NAND segment might be worth $9Bill*14.7/6.7 = $19.7Bill. This is MV. MU is about 24% NAND with a 11% market share. MU MV is $82Bill. Therefore, WDC NAND based upon MU might be ($82Bill*.24)*14.7/11= $26.3BillThe number being thrown out around Kioxia is $20Bill for a 50/50 company split. I don't know if that $20Bill takes into account Kioxia debt, which makes it $20Bill of MV. That's not very different from the Intel valuation.So just use a WDC Flash MV of (19.7+20+26)/3 = $21.9BillThe combined MV for WDC should be 15.5+21.9 = $37.4Bill or ~ $119/shr. Even if you subtract the remaining $4.1Bill in debt not already substracted, that leaves $33.3Bill or ~$106/shr."

Any idea what would happen to WDC shares if merger occurs? Name change( Woxia)? Westoxia?
"For those that were not around in 2017, the leaks from Japan were notorious. While Toshiba was trying to arrange the sale of TMC (which became Kioxia), every 3 or 4th day, there was a rumor about WDC or this company or some deal or no deal. The whipsawing of the stock was nauseating. We may be in for the same action again.@vsor: the release of this rumor coupled with the seemingly irrational sell off of WDC over the past few weeks ... there are no coincidences. Only the appearance of coincidence. If these events are correlated, who will stand to gain the most? Follow the money.The trick will be to see which IB(s) pull there opinions on WDC ... that tells you who's working the deal.Whether this winds up being good or bad depends upon the conditions of any eventual deal. But a couple questions/observations:I have a hard time accepting that Japan, Inc. will give up majority ownership and control of their crown jewel.Does a stock deal cash out Bain? Toshiba? Our understanding was they wanted their cash back.Is there anyway China will approve this? Or will WDC be stuck with MOFCOM shackles for 5 years ... again?"
"Benchmark Co. analyst Mark Miller maintained a Buy rating on Western Digital on Wednesday, setting a price target of $92"
"Merger would make Western Digital 'strong #2' in NAND, says Mizuho Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh keeps a Buy rating on Western Digital (WDC) with a $92 price target after the Wall Street Journal reported the company is in talks to potentially merge with Kioxia in a $20B-plus deal. Regulatory approvals ""remain a key stumbling block,"" Rakesh tells investors in a research note. He believes the merger would establish Western Digital as a ""strong #2"" global NAND supplier at 30% share after Samsung at number one with 35% share and Micron (MU) third at 15% share. Consolidation in memory could improve pricing stability, benefiting memory suppliers and wafer fab equipment suppliers including Western Digital, Micron, Applied Materials (AMAT) and Lam Research (LRCX), says Rakesh."
They had some interesting insights about WDC on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"Deutsche Bank analyst Sidney Ho is ""generally positive"" on the idea of a merger between Western Digital (WDC) and Kioxia following the Wall Street Journal's report that the companies are in late-stage talks."
"Bloomberg, Reuters both pointing out substantial hurdles the WDC/Kioxia merger. Seems like deja vu when I think back to the MOFCOM opposition of the past."
"In a report released today, Mark Miller from Benchmark Co. maintained a Buy rating on Western Digital, with a price target of $92.00."
Shelf registration??? So this pretty much confirms the rumors. Now how about some details?
"Let's forget about the current FY22 P/E of SIX, the valuation of this stock is nonsensical.STX and WDC have similar enterprise values around $24 B. STX' HDD sales are 10% higher than WDC's HDD sales, implying a value of just $2.4 B for WDC's NAND business.Micron's enterprise value is $80 B, 30% of Micron's sales are NAND implying a value of $24 B for Micron's NAND business, 10 TIMES MORE THAN the implied value of WDC's NAND business.If you want to argue WDC's debt level, that should come down substantially over the next year. Last quarter, WDC generated $1 B in cash from operations. Similar if not higher cash flows expected over the next four or five quarters. My conclusion is that most fund managers have SFB and or those who have been complaining for years about the trading cartel manipulating WDC's shares have a legitimate gripe!"
big jump in short interest. I guess no one believes the 6x next year's earning forecast
"Interesting. Stocks of acquiring companies usually fall, not rise. And WDC would be using its very cheap stock for the purchase. Something doesn't make sense here, but I don't care. I bought calls two days ago. Can someone explain the stock's reaction to this news?"
"Several points made by Rottinghaus:Demand is softening: based upon those famous unverifiable channel checks. My observation; there ain't any inventoryDemand softening due to PC supply chain issues. Hey, this has been going on for 2.5 years.Cloud Titans will reduce purchases to digest. WAIT! They just started repurchasing last qtr. WDC talked about multi-qtr procurements. Since it takes more than 1 qtr to make a drive, they can't flip this on and off every qtr.Chia waning: both STX & WDC said this was insignificant going forward.This was basically noise for the sake of noise."
"I am highly doubting the motivation of the analyst's research report at this specific time. Those analysts just made a report based on guess/prediction not facts . SO do not completely trust analyst but trust yourselves. No matter what, WDC is one of the cheapest S&P 500 companies now.Hold WDC tightly and will be rewarded beautifully later."
