How can Seagate be so high if Western Digital is growing Nand and hdd with the same customers and there are therefore more opportunities? Wdc is able to give better innovation with Toshiba anyway
Get ready for WDC to go much higher! The Nand business is worth 20-30 B and the HDD is also worth 20-30B. Two to Three times sales.
It seems like this stock is going to plateau at $100.00 a share in November.
This could turn higher on a dime! The forward earnings look to be at least $2.50 per quarter. That is enough growth to get Western Digital positive AH.
"The analyst from ubs is lost in space. Stocks that perform better for about a year, likely do worse the following year and Vice versa. So ubs is lost in space and that doesn’t even count the mental aspect."
hey look everyone markets at all time highs again today....WDC not so much
"Who wants to bet we're heading down again today?Latest article :The Covid-19 Delta variant is disrupting global supply chains, so much so that companies have started citing the complications it’s caused for their supply chains.Some factories are implementing safety restrictions. For others, it’s a port issue—the closure of one of the globe’s busiest ports in China is just one example. Ultimately, these problems make it hard for companies to access supplies, raise their costs, hamper their ability to meet demand, and force them to increase prices. U.S. stocks have started feeling the pain. Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 282.12 points, or 0.8%, while the S&P 500 fell 0.7%. “[The] Delta variant continues to plague markets,” writes NatAlliance Securities’ Andrew Brenner.Companies at home are now mentioning their concerns about supply chain bottlenecks. Here are 5 such companies that strategists at RBC Capital Markets highlighted as concerned about the supply constraints. Western Digital (WDC): The company, which has a market cap of $19 billion, acknowledged the impact as well on its Aug. 4 earnings call. “We have to continue to work through the COVID situation from a factory perspective and supply chain perspective,” said CFO Robert Eulau. The stock is down 20% from its 2021 high, hit in early June."
OK....WHY IN THE EFFF is it down today?????
"(Disclaimer: I'm not a native speaker, so I apologize for my mistakes. Feel free to correct my grammar though.)In today's post, I'd like to discuss a little bit about Chia. I know some people here think this cryptocurrency is just a fad, and they might very well be correct in their assumptions. Still, it's interesting to observe some development that has been going on recently. As you might know, since June, Chia price (XCH) has been slowly going down, but it was still in the $300 to $200 range in the last weeks. However, before that, the price peaked mid of May, surging above $1600. This was the same period of time when WDC price went from about $64.5 to $77 per share (only to drop again a few days later.) I'm not sure there's a real correlation here, but it's interesting how quickly it went up (and down.)The most interesting piece of information, though, is the netspace. On May 16, Chia had a netspace of about 6 EiB. In the last days, it's been in the 32 EiB range! This is a huge increase in the space allocated to Chia, and this netspace must translate to physical devices somewhere. In that sense, it could potentially have had an impact on WDC sales. Of course, that netspace could very well consist of old HDDs that were just lying around, or Seagate HDDs that have been recently sold, or previously unused cloud storage. In other words, it's difficult to assess whether WDC has actually benefited from this 6 to 32 EiB increase. However, if you visit the Chia subreddit, you'll see many people showing their setup, which often consists of WDC disks. Even though this is just anecdotal, it might still be a good indicator that at least some WDC HDDs have been sold for the sole purpose of Chia coin farming.Also, in the last 24 hours, XCH surged from about $200 to $280, while the trading volume went up 170%! Sure enough, this might just be market manipulation; it's difficult to judge at this point. It could be the beginning of something big, or just the last breath before death. In any case, it's still an interesting development.Thanks for your attention! :-)"
"In a Capt. Obvious moment, I think we can see that near-term stock prices are being disconnected from near-term profits. I think spot 3D NAND hit a 52-week high overnight. 30%-35% more demand (vs last year) plus higher prices combined with 10%-15% lower costs will work wonders on the bottomline for the flash segment. HDD probably saw the low point over the last qtr or two and is probably sold out through the end of the year - at better margins. So the 2nd half of CY21 will look very good for WDC.But it appears, as speculated over the past couple months, that the current agenda is to discount the present and connect the stock price to a much more downcast 2022. It does not matter that WDC EPS estimates for FY22 are currently over 100% above FY21. The trading agenda is that it does not matter - either it is fake or FY23 will be worse. While I've seen no evidence to support that FUD, that has to be what is being whispered."
"Seeing more risk than reward entering the late memory cycle, Morgan Stanley downgrades Micron (NASDAQ:MU) from Overweight to Equal-Weight and cuts the price target from $105 to $75.In a research note titled ""Winter is Coming,"" the firm says its cycle indicator has shifted from mid-cycle to late cycle for the first time since 2019, a historically challenging backdrop for forward returns.Pricing is still moving higher but ""the rate of change is approaching peak as supply is catching up with demand,"" says Morgan Stanley.The firm prefers NAND and NDR stocks over DRAM, which is expected to have higher sustained rates during the cycle. Stocks ""will tell us when it's time to buy, once they stop declining in reaction to bad news"" but that ""bad news"" for DRAM ""has to come first.""Along with Micron, Morgan Stanley downgrades Naya Tech and Winbound to Equal-Weight.

WDC may be the lowest valued high tech stock on the planet. At these prices we could see a play for them.Maybe our only hope now! Good luck longs!!
It’s coming
MU initiates a $0.10 quarterly dividend
"Finally, a big buy just before noon. We need to see more of this if WDC is to reverse the downtrend it has been in for the last few months. The short covering rally last week did nothing as the shorts simply resumed their selling rather quickly as it became clear that the Koxia rumor wasn’t going to change the trend."
"Micron 'record' NAND sales bode well for Western Digital, says Benchmark After Micron (MU) reported quarterly upside, including ""record"" NAND sales, and guided higher, Benchmark analyst Mark Miller said the report, guidance and commentary that the NAND market is expected to remain tight into 2022 all bode well well for Western Digital (WDC). Miller keeps a Buy rating and $92 price target on Western Digital shares following Micron's fiscal Q3 report."
Just bought at 67.80 for a quick trade.

"This stock certainly has had A LOT od bad bad days. But I think this one truely takes the cake.

"3Q21 NAND projections: Moving on UP""Moving into 3Q21, clients in the data center segment will gradually become the main growth driver as they expand procurement of high-density enterprise SSDs. Furthermore, notebook demand is expected to remain at a fairly high level in 3Q21, thereby sustaining NAND Flash demand bit growth and the ongoing rise in contract prices of NAND Flash products. Hence, TrendForce currently forecasts that the quarterly total NAND Flash revenue will not only again register a QoQ increase but also hit a record high for 3Q21."""
@bigbear wow how much inaccuracies can you put in a few sentence post??? someties better to write nothing you know what i mean?
sold my 67.70 shares middle of the position to lower cost average. thanks
Surprised no company announcement one way or another.
Must be downgrade coming. No reason for this to be trading down here. Volume picked up too
I loaded up today and last week. Preparing for a great report. GLTA 
Loaded up at 65 in anticipation of good earnings and guidance.
"well, pretty much gave up all of yesterdays pop. CONGRATS LONGS!!!!!"
Somehow the better WDC does financially (even outperforming STX now) the wider the gap in share price between STX and WDC becomes.
"If stx dudes have good earnings do these wdc dudes rally or go up??? Or tank like the titanic.?? These analyst guys said $90-160. Ever since these upgrades it's been flushed down the toilet. I thought management had a plan for sustainable earnings and growth. If we tank on earnings fire them, the board of directors."

"The innovation at WDC is in ssd with Toshiba and this part of the company is worth a whole lot more. The combined companies (Sandisk and western digital HDD) allows better marketing and helps the innovation according to the ceo. So the potential for Wdc is far greater than Seagate. So what if it is down right now. The market made a mistake. However, today the stocks is higher."
"Folks, dont kid yourselves, WDC is a 80-85 dollar stock all day long, and you can Own it in the LOW 60s...this is a HUGE BUY at this Price point, DO NOT BOTTOM FISH here, You SNOOZE , Youll LOSE...BUY into EARNINGS, not AFTER, WDC will POP $5-$10 after earnings....opinion only g luck"
"Bloomberg, Reuters both pointing out substantial hurdles the WDC/Kioxia merger. Seems like deja vu when I think back to the MOFCOM opposition of the past."

Merger
"I guess we shouldn't feel so bad. Everything seems to be beating earnings and going down. Look at AMAT. Then again AMAT is up like 400% the last 5 or so years, WDC not so much.........."
Could be $70 by earnings release
Any chance this gets to $55?
Who’s selling it with so much positive news and reviews. They either don’t trust the analysts or merger talks or the shorts trying to shake the tree even more.

"P/E and other numbers on this site are misleading, because they are based on GAAP earnings. In many cases non-GAAP numbers are telling much more , because they exclude non-cash expenses (e.g. amortisation of intangible assets), the cost of aqusitions and other irregular expenses.And P/E based on non-GAAP earnings is 13.99, when you take into account projected next earnings, P/E after earnings date cuold be 10.04.The other important number, operating cash flow, is also very good. This number clearly mirrors the ability to generate cash. WDC generates 1.9B/y, while its market cap is 19.38B.Try to find other tech company with such a positive numbers."
"Did WD mention any discussions of becoming more intimate with Kioxia, Tosh and WD during the earnings call? This just seems so sudden. It seems like something that they would have mentioned at that time, so apparently this fairly new. Besides, how can MOFCOM say 'No' to a deal like this. They aren't Nancy Reagan."

Do not worry. STX first down to 80$ after earning and then back to 90$ soon.
I sold my MU at 78 just before the dividend announcement. It has been on fire for 2 days now and they only announced a 10 cent dividend (first dividend since 1998). Imagine what a 50 cent quarterly dividend for WDC would do tonight. I added 30k shares (net) to my WDC position since the MU announcement just because of what MU did.
"STX had an excellent report, and issued significant upside guidance. Looks like the fix was in from the trading cartel before the report. What else is new?"
"I just ran across this headline (not directly WDC-related, but close enough) from The Street, Aug 10:“Micron, Chip Stocks Fall on Report Citing Delays: A report from Susquehanna Financial Group says that the order-filling time for chipmakers now exceeds 20 weeks…The gap already stood at the highest in the four years that Susquehanna has compiled the numbers.”Maybe these are the same analysts who recently discovered why WDC shares were down: management had low-balled earning guidance."
There is no cartel! WDC will go much higher.
Made a video on why Western Digital is an opportunity: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwrVRwWKr_M&t=154s&ab_channel=SafeInvesting-predicted possible mergers...-possible dividends in future as well
Non-gaap 1st quarter is $2.25-$2.55. That means WDC could be at $3.00 per quarter.
The real tragedy (irony) is WDC was on the cusp of breaking out from its years long asset write-offs with the very real potential of reporting real earnings of $9-$10 a share which most certainly would have driven the stock over $100! With the merger we can expect years of asset write-offs again. On the plus side is this acquisition won't happen for at least a year (if at all) as we wait for Communist China approval so maybe the stock will be valued in the next year on its actual earnings.
Kioxia 20Billion
"Seems like I hear the same thing everyday.....""markets hit another ALL TIME HIGH"". Meanwhile this stock goes down."
can't wait til that investor conference thursday. I'm sure the stock will just rocket upward like we have never seen before as soon as the management starts talking because they are such a great bunch of guys.
Bought premarket 64.01.I've spoken to this in the past - I think WDC may be done with their write offs. GAAP actually matters. When GAAP can approximate non-GAAP this stock will go up. If they earn GAAP $9-10 this year 2022 this stock is NOT going to be sitting at $64. Of course WDC does have a history of over paying things and have recently alluded to doing more of the same in the future!
"I guess it went up to much after beating earnings by 45% and raising guidance even though every analyst thinks that that raised guidance is still sandbagging bigtime. Certainly shouldn't have gone up, surprised it not at $59 already."
Today was a relatively good day
Also their FABs are mainly in Japan not China. I looked at their FAB in Japan huge complex. This will be a Home Run!! Smoke over the Pix's from this link..https://www.kioxia-holdings.com/en-jp/about/glance.html
"More news on chip shortages, supply chain problems etc...demand will be good. They will need storage to store data they hack. Chips to replace inventory. This is a buying opportunity. A launching pad for the spring to 80 after next earnings call when you hear another beat on top and bottom lines. And still good guidance plus debt paid down. It's a waiting game."

"I'd love to say today was down to options expiration, but the straight line down all day, together with yesterday, suggests otherwise,.Why is STX less volatile?"
"Chia has been at about this level for about 6 weeks now. Actually it was around $180 a few weeks ago and its almost $100 more now. After all this time he decides to downgrade today?? AND BY THE WAY, Edgewater says Seagate ""is likely to continue ceding share"". Isn't that good for WDC???? I mean, can you have a worse stock that acts more irrationally than this thing?"
"sure acts like there will be a miss or bad news tomorrow, even though no one is expecting it...."

"Isn't it amazing (and sad) that the company can beat every estimate, and guide well above estimates for next qtr, and still trade down."

Dividend. Lots of posts lately forecasting resumption in the next 4-5 quarters. WDC's decision to pull the plug was personally painful but I did then and still do understand their objective. Not sure why reinstating the dividend would even be considered. Comments appreciated.

It is hard to believe that Craig Hallam has $120 on Silicon Motion! The latest silicon motion conference call was a lot of hype! The products are average and Western Digital has factories with Toshiba. Silicon Motion has to use TSM and their shannon was no competition for Sandisk!

Thinking of buying more here. Keep thinking about all the profits I can make before or after earnings report.
"WDC mktcap was about $25B a few weeks ago with stock price around $76.. Since then earnings and revenue were a blowout and so was guidance, yet mktcap is now $20B. Somebody is trying to push this stock down for the merger."

So STX reports tomorrow before the bell.They already upped their Q4 guidance.Fingers crossed there's no surprises on the downside to pull us down with them.Need many more like us to get back above $75

I think every time someone said congratulations on the great results it went down 10 cents.....
WDC's PT raised to $92 from $90 at Mizuho SecuritiesAlso raised to $88 from $85 at JP Morgan
I expect WDC to reinstitute a 50 cent quarterly dividend tomorrow that they suspended last summer. This should bring back the dividend investors and get us to the 70s by end of week.
"Several points made by Rottinghaus:Demand is softening: based upon those famous unverifiable channel checks. My observation; there ain't any inventoryDemand softening due to PC supply chain issues. Hey, this has been going on for 2.5 years.Cloud Titans will reduce purchases to digest. WAIT! They just started repurchasing last qtr. WDC talked about multi-qtr procurements. Since it takes more than 1 qtr to make a drive, they can't flip this on and off every qtr.Chia waning: both STX & WDC said this was insignificant going forward.This was basically noise for the sake of noise."
"It is the turn of undervalued companies like WDC, MU and many small cap semi-conductors like KLIC, SIMO and HIMX"
WDC shareholders should be outraged.Using a significantly undervalued stock (100%) as currency to pay twice the value of a company!You shareholders should hope and pray this merger doesn't happen.
"From Barron's article today:Western Digital, at around $61, is a leading maker of flash memory. Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore is upbeat on its prospects, giving the stock an Overweight rating and a $88 price target. He thinks the stock is too cheap given that he expects earnings of $10 a share next year."
Other than a buyout what can make this stock go up? What else can be reported positive that hasn't been the last 3 months that would spark this thing? Anything????
And they beat STX. So why isn't WDC trading near $90?I don't expect any rational answers to explain situations like this in this market.
ends in the green on a Friday. Bravo WDC.
"Problem with WDC is, its dropped so much that any relating news such as a Buyout (never thought I'd say it) or upgraded guidance or new product release, would propel this stock higher. Is it going BK? Nothing points to that. So $0 is off the table. Accounting fraud. Unlikely, but not impossible. Even though it trends lower on no news, any positive news or sector trends wouldcarry this higher. So, whilst I should sell here and take the loss, the upside is getting stronger. Why was the PT's given around ER and 3 months before not valid any longer on no news?You could argue someone knows something and we're witnessing the start of a great downturn (check out oil from 2015 to 2020..COVID doesn't count).Oil dropped based on massive supply surplus? Nope. But the whole thing was manipulated. Whilst oil was in surplus, we all kept driving, flying, burning etc.Tough call here. We may be about to turn a corner on no news and go back up to 90, or we could linger in the $50's. Doesn't affect the business fundamentals thankfully. They'll still bag over $2 next qtr."
Where are all the analysts that have price targets 100%+ above current levels defending this thing?
"Wow, that AMD sure has ripped up $20 in a week. MU moving higher. Stx ripping. Wdc is next!!"
"Once again, we bemoan the apparent undervaluation of WDC to it's kin. Having done this several times in the past, why not again? What should WDC be valued at?The HDD segment may be the most straightforward. From STX, let's just use a revenue comparison and factor from EV. STX rev last qtr was $3Bill, WDC HDD rev was $2.5Bill. STX EV is $23.63Bill. Therefore, WDC HDD segment EV might be $23.63Bill*2.5/3 = $19.7Bill EV. Since WDC is about 50/50 between HDD/Flash, take out 50% of the debt to get a WDC HDD MV = $15.5BillThe Flash segment is a bit more subjective. Let's use the 3 data points most comparable: Intel, MU and the $20Bill 50/50 number being thrown out around Kioxia.Intel sold their 6.7% market share for $9Bill to SKH. WDC NAND market share is 14.7%. Therefore, based upon INTC, WDC NAND segment might be worth $9Bill*14.7/6.7 = $19.7Bill. This is MV. MU is about 24% NAND with a 11% market share. MU MV is $82Bill. Therefore, WDC NAND based upon MU might be ($82Bill*.24)*14.7/11= $26.3BillThe number being thrown out around Kioxia is $20Bill for a 50/50 company split. I don't know if that $20Bill takes into account Kioxia debt, which makes it $20Bill of MV. That's not very different from the Intel valuation.So just use a WDC Flash MV of (19.7+20+26)/3 = $21.9BillThe combined MV for WDC should be 15.5+21.9 = $37.4Bill or ~ $119/shr. Even if you subtract the remaining $4.1Bill in debt not already substracted, that leaves $33.3Bill or ~$106/shr."
"This just is not sustainable. The underperformance of WDC vs STX, the Nasdaq, the market cannot keep going like this if the damn company is making close to $3 per share per quarter in earnings and half the analysts on wall st have a price target almost 100% above it's current share price. This will come to an end sooner or later one way or another!!!!!!! Just don't know how or exactly when, but I think it will be soon. I don't care how ""powerful"" the ""trading cartel"" is, you can't hide this much value discrepency in plain site forever."
It's really funny - pre-market -3.21% on volume 3 shares. Somebody couldn't wait till market opens and sold his 3 shares to cash 181$.
"I do not believe in UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri. How can he accurately predict 2023 earnings for WDC? However, I believe in myself. WDC is trading at 1x sale and forward PE less than 10. Data storage is the future for cloud, AI, EV, etc"
They had some interesting insights about WDC on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"bought more, this should be up not down"
The power of the trading cartel: a little old shop out of NC with a negative opinion that nobody ever heard of can cause more reaction that the largest IB in the world with a positive opinion. Was it just last week MS spoke glowingly about STX? Things don't go sideways in a week. There is only so much data available that can be gleaned about HDD demand (and it is shockingly little data). Much of the really important demand (cloud titans) is completely invisible to outsiders. But hey - the negative nellies got their frontman.
Susquehanna has our Western Digital price target at $155 way up there compared to Seagate at only $95. Medhi Hosseini sees better visibility from Western Digital.
"This stock was over $78 3 months ago. In the meantime there have been several upgrades, countless positive headlines, positive earnings or pre announcents from related companies and its down over 10%. I guess that's better tan being down 30% on 3 years while the rest of the market has doubled. Oh and it finished negative again today after more earnings raises from BAML this moring and reports that Apple is massively increasing orders. Can't make this stuff up....."

I still think we hit 71 by next Friday.
Who in their right mind puts a $155 pt on this stock? Almost a 200% gain. How do these analysts have jobs? Very serious question!
"Seagate, Western Digital weakness attributed to Edgewater Research report 11:41 STX, WDC The weakness in shares of Seagate Technology (STX) and Western Digital (WDC) is being attributed to a report from Edgewater Research analyst Kevin Rottinghaus. The analyst wrote, according to Bloomberg, that he is taking a ""more cautious stance"" on both companies given the ""multiple risks"" to hard disk drive demand in the third and fourth quarters. Rottinghaus says the ""messy"" supply chain makes it difficult to determine real end demand and that Seagate is likely to continue ceding share in the near-term. Shares of Western Digital are down 3% to $60.14 while Seagate is down 7% to $85.67 in midday trading."
"How does benchmark ""initiate"" coverage every 48 hours? I thought you can only ""initiate"" once."
Benchmark Co. analyst Mark Miller maintained a Buy rating on Western Digital today and set a price target of $92.00. The company’s shares closed last Tuesday at $61.14.
Its all abt eps for next year. Est are all over the place but moving higher. 2022 could be $9/ shr. Or much more….
"Probably hits 70 this week barring down market. Writing covered calls a little higher to get some change we are missing from no dividend. All is well after earnings reaction, thankfully. For a little bit I thought they might sell it off. GLTA"

"Deutsche Bank analyst Sidney Ho is ""generally positive"" on the idea of a merger between Western Digital (WDC) and Kioxia following the Wall Street Journal's report that the companies are in late-stage talks."
"I go away for a few hours and all .... breaks loose. I didn't think WDC would pursue this. If I'm wrong, I'm wrong. But as pointed out below, a stock deal using their vastly undervalued stock is disappointing. However, think back to last week concerning one of my conspiracy theories about why WDC stock was being sold down. Methinks Japan leaks inside information like a broken dam."
"WDC the best ""value"" stock out there!"
"Seagate, Western Digital research report brings buying opportunity, says Stifel analyst Patrick Ho."
This is the best deal on Western Digital shares since Feb. 10. All aboard!
The pawn may be the HDD business.
Good news is it may pop 20% on earnings. Bad news is that will put it at $65. This is getting a little concerning now.
"Merger would make Western Digital 'strong #2' in NAND, says Mizuho Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh keeps a Buy rating on Western Digital (WDC) with a $92 price target after the Wall Street Journal reported the company is in talks to potentially merge with Kioxia in a $20B-plus deal. Regulatory approvals ""remain a key stumbling block,"" Rakesh tells investors in a research note. He believes the merger would establish Western Digital as a ""strong #2"" global NAND supplier at 30% share after Samsung at number one with 35% share and Micron (MU) third at 15% share. Consolidation in memory could improve pricing stability, benefiting memory suppliers and wafer fab equipment suppliers including Western Digital, Micron, Applied Materials (AMAT) and Lam Research (LRCX), says Rakesh."
"Be very wary of letting yourself or your fund manager sell Western Digital now. “Sandisk” revenues will soon be at $10,000,000,000 (billion) a year and they can really make anywhere from 1-$2.5 billion in net profit(10-25%) depending on the cycle. So they can make $4-8 a share on SSD and $4-10 on HDD. So $8-16 a share is going to be the earnings potential going forward. It is important to stay long since earnings of $12 a share could fetch $120 or more per share."
"The latest in a planned monthly series of data-tracking updates in the IT hardware sector from Morgan Stanley offers some of its most important takeaways, including channel info for hard-disk makers, the iPhone in China, and what to make of some decelerating printer-hardware growth.For hard disk drives (HDD), the data is still getting better, write Katy Huberty, Erik Woodring and team: ""We see clear evidence that HDD vendors are refilling the channel with higher priced inventory.""Comparable average selling prices are increasing despite ""little to no"" demand related to Chia, the cryptocurrency valued by the amount of drive storage it takes up. (Some observers estimated Chia alone would be responsible for a 10% increase in disk prices in 2021.)ASPs are up 4% in the past two weeks and up 7% over the past three months, Morgan Stanley notes. And inventory is hanging around all-time lows.""As a result, we believe the tailwind from channel refill will likely persist for several quarters,"" the firm says. ""Moreover, the robust ASP growth helps confirm our view that Chia will have a lasting impact on the HDD industry, which some investors still have doubts around."" One of its top ideas in the space is still Seagate (NASDAQ:STX), with 30% upside to its base case and ""a compelling 1.4 to 1 bull/bear skew."""
"So this makes it ""official"" when Barron's run's the cover fire for the trading cartel (you may find the whole article online today):""Here Are the Cheapest Stocks in Each Sector. Some Deserve the Discount, Others Look Like BargainsHere are the three cheapest stocks in all 11 S&P 500 sectors:Hewlett Packard Enterprise (ticker: HPE), Micron Technology (MU), and Western Digital (WDC) all go for less than 8 times next year's estimated earnings -- compared with a 29 times 2022 price-to-earnings for the tech sector on average. That's a big gap, but it isn't unreasonable.Micron and Western Digital both sell into the highly cyclical memory chip market, with periods of intense demand and high sales tending to be followed by slumps of oversupply and weaker pricing. Right now, the industry is in boom times. After a year of working from home boosted demand for PCs, smartphones, and cloud infrastructure, memory inventories are low and customers are paying up. Analysts expect near-record earnings per share for Micron in its fiscal 2022, which ends in August, but the stock price hasn't kept pace.That's what tends to happen to cyclical stocks: Multiples contract toward the top of the cycle, because investors worry that things are as good as they're going to get and the current level of earnings won't be sustainable. That makes Micron and Western Digital stocks look cheaper than they really are."""
wdc is very under appreciated. It is time to go up.
Writing covered calls closer to the current price. I originally thought we could hit 70/71 by August 20th option expiration but it doesn't look like it and may not hit that by end of Sept. Seems like only positive to get stock price higher is good earnings reported for next qtr. Or a buyout of it's business which I don't know who would buy. Maybe we can go back to 66 where it was last week I'd take 64.
"While the trading mafia usually sells STX on the report, there was one reason for concern. The guidance for high single-digit sales growth in FY22 in combination with guidance for $3.1 B in September quarter sales, indicates a frontend loaded year. Data center capex is typically cyclical and STX could be hedging its bets that data center spending stays high throughout FY22."
I think $71 Aug 20th is off the table.
Should of bought more under 60. Nice reversal.
"UBS upgraded STX ($30 above WDC stock price, used to be reversed) and DOWNGRADED WDC today......sweet!!!"
"Chet, we have liftoff!"

"WDC, who started all this ruckus is down nearly 4%"
Excellent quarterly results! Handily beating estimates.. beating estimated EPS by about 30%!
"I wonder if we're trying to follow the 3% gain by SKHynix and Samsung?Mu also doing well, but that might be down to Tim Arcuri giving them a positive note."
Down $2.86 after hours according to yahoo. They really are working hard at pushing this down.
tomorrow will be more telling when those who don't watch stocks heavily see this blowout report.
It's already dropped from the high much more than it'has gained today. If it keeps this up it may finish red.....which would be pretty fitting for this stock.
"Paid down debt by 150M already in the fiscal first quarter. I take it that this was the 50 cent dividend that I expected. So, no dividend this quarter."

"For those that were not around in 2017, the leaks from Japan were notorious. While Toshiba was trying to arrange the sale of TMC (which became Kioxia), every 3 or 4th day, there was a rumor about WDC or this company or some deal or no deal. The whipsawing of the stock was nauseating. We may be in for the same action again.@vsor: the release of this rumor coupled with the seemingly irrational sell off of WDC over the past few weeks ... there are no coincidences. Only the appearance of coincidence. If these events are correlated, who will stand to gain the most? Follow the money.The trick will be to see which IB(s) pull there opinions on WDC ... that tells you who's working the deal.Whether this winds up being good or bad depends upon the conditions of any eventual deal. But a couple questions/observations:I have a hard time accepting that Japan, Inc. will give up majority ownership and control of their crown jewel.Does a stock deal cash out Bain? Toshiba? Our understanding was they wanted their cash back.Is there anyway China will approve this? Or will WDC be stuck with MOFCOM shackles for 5 years ... again?"
Volume has been pretty impressive today. Daily average volume reached already.I don't think Employees are selling their vested RSUs. STX fallen harder today. Be a coincidence if both STX and WDC open their stock selling windows on the same day.

"The source of Arcuri's ""I hate NAND""Some of you may remember 4 months ago, I mentioned that somebody always wants to be the first to ""call"" the end to the memory cycle. In particular, the NAND cycle. Four months ago, the cycle was barely started yet somebody was calling the peak. It was Arcuri. He didn't go public with his downgrade, but he was the Oz behind the curtain.It started with the LRCX CC in late April. Based upon rules of thumb provided by LRCX in March, 2020 and the NAND WFE capex associated with LRCX, Arcuri extrapolated that the NAND industry was adding bit supply at a rate of about 45%. When demand is increasing at a 35% rate, that is a significant oversupply. So he began his behind the curtain crusade.Late last month, LRCX had their last CC. And Arcuri picked up right where he left off in April. Quote Arcuri:""So if you sort of look at where NAND is running right now, you just sort of conclude, well, maybe you're adding more like mid 40s bit growth. But I know you've also said, hey, those numbers don't really hold anymore, because capital intensity has gone up as well.""LRCX responded by stating that the numbers he's using are not current and need to be updated. LRCX:""And you're right, the observation that over time, capital intensity grows in that device architecture and NAND. And when we gave those numbers that were kind of broad averages over long periods of time to try to be helpful, and it's not a static number. So I agree with you, we do need to update it, I'm not ready to do it on the call right now.""So even though Arcuri knows that the basis for his extrapolation is wrong, he's running with it anyway."
The volume has started out better again to today Rambo. That is an indicator the stock is ready to reach $80.
Wake me up! Is this actually up?
"Well it's trading at 5 times forward consensus earnings now, and at 4X one guy's estimates. So do we go for 4X consensus???? Is that where these vultures want to take it???

What's our relationship with Bain capital?Friend or foe?I see there's some past relating to Toshiba spinning out their chip business and the NAND portion becoming Kioxia.

"onesurfed09:54 AM@Loveleaps55 W St can't forget the Milligan disdain for analysts, for one. Yes, it's petty. It makes them feel powerful, though. Eventually WDC will get some respect. Capitalization is too large to benefit from a ""meme"" trade, which is kind of a bummer."
The WDC board members are dead wood as far as I'm concerned. Collecting their half million + dollars/options a year to show up or call in once a month. One of their main jobs is to represent the shareholders. IMHO
"It's really sad, but today's investing is totally distorted by hedge funds' manipulations. It's frustrating, but you have to keep in mind HF cannot manipulate the share price indefinitely.There is nothing wrong with WDC, the share price is undervalued in all possible measures, but WDC is still going down without any reason.So why are HF doing it? They know it's undervalued and they see potential profits as you see it. But keep im mind, every transaction in the market needs two sides : buyer and seller. Retail traders are buying, so HF have no chance to open big long position at good price. So they have to convince retail traders to sell. It’s all part of their psychological manipulation toolkit, the more you are frustrated, the more you want to give up and sell your shares. And that's exactly what HF need : to find the other side of their trade - sellers.I'm simply ignoring these short term fluctuations, WDC will go up to its fair value."

Western Digital WDC-NasdaqOutperform Price $64.94 on Aug. 4by WedbushWestern Digital [a maker of hard drives] reported fiscal fourth-quarter and fiscal 2021 results well ahead of the Street consensus. WDC also realized operating cash flow of nearly $1 billion. With cash generation set to continue, we see Western Digital as likely achieving targeted net debt levels in the first half of 2022.

"Kinda funny. On the earnings call they just had, some were accusing CEO of sandbagging guidance. They raised next qtrs guidance. So if they are sandbagging, do they beat next qtrs estimates?? This kinda drop happens when they guide down. Plus with paying down the leverage they should get a better multiple not only for up cycles but also down cycles. I think we bounce back.

Last quarter, WDC generated $1 B in cash from operations. Similar if not higher cash flows expected over the next four or five quarters. My conclusion is that most fund managers have SFB and or those who have been complaining for years about the trading cartel manipulating WDC's shares have a legitimate gripe!"
