"Joe has been bearish since it was on the 40's. I really hope you weren't shorting this stock. Great company, fair value now but it will keep going up. Mark my words."
Great! Now we are only $20 below where we were a few month ago and only $40 from our highs of 2017.
￼ Demand for RVs is increasing due to rental demand increase. More people are taking road trips than staying in hotels or Airbnb￼￼s
I guess a $14 billion dollar order backlog for their RV’s is a bad thing? Might be better to invest in a company that has never made a profit but is well liked by Reddit?Just joking. I’m going to hold and wait till next earnings report.
I just drove by a Lazy Days RV dealer. Their lot was 100% full. What are they talking about low inventories??
"I rage-deleted all my YF posts during one of the recent market selloffs, but I'm coming here second to start over. $WGO is my favorite holding, but it has underperformed this year. I'm not sure why. I suspect people think the RV boon is over and everyone is going back to cruising tomorrow, or the next day, or the next day, which still hasn't happened. 30% of the US isn't vaccinated. A grand total of ZERO American kids under 12 are vaccinated.But none of that really matters, because families have picked up new hobbies and vacations over the last year. They rented and purchased RVs, boats, ATVs, golf clubs and other outdoor sports. I've RVed with my kids for almost 10 years. I have neighbors and friends coming up to ask how we like it, how to tow, where we go, etc. This isn't a dying fad. It's the new norm. $THO just blew out estimates and cited increasing demand, but then offered stock which shows why Winnie is a significantly better investment IMO. Plus WInne has diversification with Chris Craft and Barletta Pontoons. Plus Winnie makes a better product than Jayco. And on the back of most boats is a Mercury thanks to $BC. $PII $CWH $HZOSupply chain issues for all of these companies may exist, but will abate. People aren't going to stop buying toys for their lake properties or camping trips. In fact, every time we've bought an RV, we've wanted the next size/step up. We went from pop up to hybrid to travel trailer. So people are basically lifelong customers."
Wait for capitulation.. Not there yet..
Can we expect bigger dividend increases going forward?
Took my .99. Gas money for the boat this weekend.
Who has owned a worse stock than THO over the last 5 years? Is Thor the worst stock in your portfolio over the last 5 years?? Anyone care to answer??
What ever happens I hope the management gets big bonuses for doing this type of deal. I believe the CEO should get an additional 30-40 million in the year the deal gets completed and the 10- 15 million each and every year after until retirement.
Loss from the previous quarters are expected due to recent acquisitions. Debt paid off with seen cash flow. Great guidance for later of this year’s remaining quarters!! Will add few more before it goes back to $60-$70s!
The chart says 108.50 is next level of support. Will buy for a bounce with a tight stop. Let's see if it holds.
THO adds another Billion to their debt. Now we have a 6 billion market cap with 3 billion in debt. Just another nail in the coffin. More bonuses please....
"I'm getting tired of the headlines that state that the ""RV sales are on fire"" or ""This is the best year for RVs"" How can this be true if Thor is trading $55 below it's highs of the last cycle? Thor has doubled in size and went global since. Something is not right."
"Hey Moonshot, what does the 45 second chart look like today? lol"
"With the debt getting closer and closer to the market cap of this company, can someone explain how Thor does not go bankrupt."
It's funny that the management remains silent while the shares collapse. Thor pays it's PR department a lot of money to do nothing. I wonder if Thor got caught up in the same scam Hymer North America was caught doing. This is a bigger problem then what we see in the surface. This is so wrong...
"Forward PE is under 10. The rate that Thor is losing market share is alarming and scareing off investors. Thor does not grow organically, they shrink organically. The savvy investors know that when Thor loses this much market share, they go and purchase another company with debt to try and grow the market share again. The problem is, is this company is run so poorly that this strategy always leads to bankruptcy somewhere down the road. You can not just spend your way to prosperity."
market up another 400 points and THO down another $2.50. POS!
"Not bad, only $25 below where we were a few months ago."
"Joe, how come that Camping World and Winnebago are also correcting? I don't think this is idiosyncratic to Thor. Only profit taking, we've tripled since March."
"If you would have sold into these analyst recommendations, you would have bailed at $160. see you at $40 where I will be loading up the truck.."
Big boys dump. Little guys get scared and sell. Price drops. Then big boys buy back 10% cheaper.
Need some opinions on whether to sell Thor high at some point when the cycle is about to peak out or to hold this long term. Time horizon 20+ years.
Biggest over reaction to some whale putting on a bunch of puts (Nov) that I’ve have ever seen. Buy!
"Shorting the RVs, like joe is doing, makes as much sense as jumping out of a plane without a parachute. RV stocks like THO are in such fertile soil for growth and still trade at reasonable valuations. The run for RVs is far from over. Short at your own peril."
"Look at the THO towables as well as the bigger classes. In this segment THO has 45% market share. Gas prices are the big delta for demand in addition to demographics and quarantines. We are a wandering populace that finds ways to satisfy that itch albeit the stock price has rallied strongly. Estimated growth is a bit over 8% with a dividend yield of 1.5%. With Hymer, THO is the largest producer and should continue to expand. I’m a patient long term holder."
THO - Ready to take off!
Joe looks like you are the only one who keeps posting on this board? It appears you don't own it so why are you here? just curious
Shorts like Joe/Kevin sure are quiet. Sux watching everyone make money while you're living on gov't handouts.
Patience has paid off for long term holders of THO. The RV industry is an unprecedented up/cycle with a lot of growth ahead.
It was a downgrade. Thor Industries Cut to Neutral From Buy by Northcoast Research. A crazy analysis did it for short sellers. Both THO and WGO got hit. The news must have been leaked if you see trading patterns in the few days. I think people overreacted. They will recover grounds if companies coming out to defend. They both have big and healthy booking lists. Market is healthy with rich people spending more discretionary income for things like RV’s.
No posts for 9 days ??????? Everyone must be counting their gains.
Zacks calls THO a Construction stock. Why would it be in that group?
"Because their forward EPS this the highest ever $2.56 a share next quarter. They must have these earnings already in the bag, as January and Feb are behind us already! Up-grades will be coming!!"
Watch for resignations and retirements in the next 18 months . Got to get the parachutes while the getting is good.
Should see $124 or better today
"Just think, when THO drops to the $20's on any hint of bad news, the dividend will be like 6% if they don't cut it."
"RV’s will be one of the few safe ways to travel while maintaining social distancing, and gas prices haven’t been this low in ages."
Ever wonder why Thor never has a share repurchase plan and pays a measly 1% dividend? These guys in charge know exactly they are doing.
"I wonder if Thor will get ahead in the EV, RV market internally or will they just spend more billions on some mediocre company that puts an EV/RV sign in their window? Everyone of Thors brands needs to jump on this internally. The company can not afford to put itself into bigger debt. These guys in charge need to do some work."
"Ryan, the CEO makes over 10 million a year. The company has gone from 0 debt to 2 billion in debt all the while losing market shares."
"Dennisk, looks to open around $116. Will you be buying back the shares you sold to Moonshot for $124?"
Does anyone besides Joe have a thought as to where SP will go today?
I was just kidding about the $11.. Let the collapse continue.
$14 swing so far today to the down side in a 500+ day for the market?
"If you’re looking for a short and sweet guide to the day’s biggest news, I recommend (http://Thetraderguide.com). They breakdown the most important pre-market news and it only takes a few minutes to read."
"Internal growth is not even in this management teams vocabulary. A monkey could over pay for acquisition to look good to a novice. Not if, but when there is a downturn in the RV industry just the opposite happens and you have billions upon billion you need to pay back. Enjoy this morning but people will figure it out over lunch.."
I love it!!! This is the episode where they argue about how high a stock is going to go as the company goes bankrupt!! Nuk nuk!!
"""joe"" (who is commenting) is the last person i'd listen to for advice. THO is looking like a great investment throughout earnings at the end of next month."
I'm shocked!
"As the cycle slows, it will be clear where this stock is headed as if it weren't clear already.."
Market is having a historic 5% move up and THO is having a historic collapse to the down side. Im not sure what's going on? I sure hope management is not being investigated by the government for stealing from their employees again. They have a habit of doing bad things.
What's going on in THO? Didn't they just have great earnings and raised divi?
Low volume today. There's only about 1% of shares available to retail investors. 99% of float is institutions. Keeps the day traders away.
"Duuuuh... You should cheer for your stock when it preforms bad, not criticize it.. Duuuuh .. Who am I ?"
He drives a four well raised truck to make him self fell bigger
"The action on THO, given their financial results, is stunning. The only negative I have heard is that inventories are too high and there is a slowdown coming. If that is the case, why would THO's backlog increase? There is no way if there was excess inventory on dealer's lots that they would be ordering more!"
Absolutely nothing to do with aluminum pricing.
"$9 may have been an underestimate. Great report and I know the news is gonna be great. If Thor just keeps paying off their debt and becomes debt free once again, this train is gonna keep on rolling all night long. See everyone in the $320-$360 range sooner then could ever imagine. This company is a cash cow.."
I hope so! 3 LARGE earnings beats in a row!!
"I think Joe works for Winnebago. The stock was highly touted when I bought it as one with huge growth potential. Did my own due diligence and read professional stock reports. Also watched an interview the CEO gave to professional investors. I bought, it started its plummet. Bought it in IRA (dumb) so I can’t even take a loss if I sell. I must say, however, that I haven’t found anyone (who is a professional) as to why the stock keeps dropping and known fundamentals don’t explain it. I’m baffled. It should be going up or at least remaining level, not dropping."
Acts like a stay-at-home stock. But it really isn't exclusively. Growth will continue and debt will be paid down.
Massive long opportunity
how does a 14 million dollar a year CEO stay silent?
This is at least a $160 stock
If they do the right stuff. Chart could be forming a cup and handle. Breakout to 160.
Chaos in Germany! Hymer stoppt production and the CEO in prison!!!!
Market is up over 1000 in the last 2 days and Thor has lost 15% of it's value.
The absolute Blow Out numbers mean absolutely nothing when everyone knows that this is a $10 sometime in the future. You can't even buy and hold for the measley dividend. Hurry up and file...
Is Thor Industrie bankrupt???
Did Thor ever repurchase the shares that were created to purchase Hymer yet? They were supposed to? Anyone know??
Interesting commentary on Thor earnings. Mentioned labor costs moderating but expected higher raw costs due to potential tariffs. But the other thing mentioned was increased warranty costs. From my observation most of these rv's are cardboard junk coming out. Even Marcus mentioned with Thor. in 2008 they made a change in marketing to go after the younger crowd and also lighter units that could be towed with smaller vehicles. That means lightweight junky models that don't hold up. I expect the warranty expenses to be high for a very long time on Thor and all these companies pushing these small lightweight units.
Probably won't see a stock perform worse then THO today.. Just saying..
2 weeks from today Thor announces their earnings. What will be the comment that sends THO into the gutters?
"10 hours away from decapitation. I think keeping Thor's market cap above 5 billion is key. If we can't hold 5 billion, we won't hold 4. If THO has lost over 1/3 of it's value in a month on no real news, this stock could disappear in another month. I guess throwing billions around like nickles was not a good idea and taking away dividends and not repuchasing shares turns out to be not so good either. Look out below!"
"Joe, I feel like you're being dishonest here. Like, you keep saying $2 billion in debt like it means something, rather than debt/equity, where THO is lower than half the industry. PEG and P/S are lower than almost all of the industry. THO is undervalued by almost every metric. Do you have anything more to offer, or did you just buy some FD puts?"
I predict an $11 up day tomorrow.
A 2 year backlog on RV’s already purchased can’t be a bad thing. I’ll hold.
"Eventually, investments will rotate to cyclical stocks as THO. I'm holding long. Short term, 3 month timeframe, we should see a bounce back to $110 to $113, not sure about $150s. Dont listen to the naysayers. They said the same thing about ROG and ROKU."
Why is Thor paying 4% when interest rates are under 2%? Anyone know? It seems that they are refinancing at a higher rate. Would you refinance your mortgage to a higher rate?
"Just read a cryptic article that said there is this RV company that sells luxury recreational vehicles which millenials will start to use more and more over the next 3 years given their rising wealth. Not sure if they were referring to THO, but this company checks that box. Thinking of going long the stock soon. Why the swoon in stock, given it looks so attractive based on FCF, Ev/EBITDA, PEG and Fwd P/E metrics? What does wall street not like here?"
Joe is not the brightest bulbCompany reports killer earnings and Joe panicks and sells
"No doubt high gas prices and droughts in the West will be a negatives on the stock. But, the huge order backlog and big earnings beats in last 5 quarters should offset that. Not to mention the runaway prices of houses should help sales. But the thing that jumps out the most for me is this company is trading at ONLY .59 sales that is Super cheap! Especially with the huge backlog. Started to scale buy today."
"With them reporting 4th qtr results by end of Dec, I can not imagine this stock not being $150 or more by Jan 1"
"One more thing.. While you have made nothing except for the 1% dividend over the last 5 years, the CEO has made over 55 million. Just saying..."
I sold my shares in early Aug for 123.1 for a nice profit. I've been tempted to buy back. Glad I didn't pull the trigger. Down another 3 bucks in early trading...yikes!!
"Well, I told you a month ago it's all about aluminum pricing. AA confirmed that yesterday. You can only swing trade this now, no more buy and hold."
Congratulations on the great THO earnings report and thanks for the pin action on LCII.
Perhaps rising raw material costs like steel or aluminum and rising gas prices?
Not sure why THO earnings release beat all consensus estimate below and received a HOLD rating from CFRA analyst. Did he misread the data release this morning?EPS: 2.14 vs 1.37Revenue: 2.32B beat 2.29B estimate.Backlogs: 5.74B vs 2B from the prior year.
"Given the turmoil in the markets for the past five days, this thing is not even down 3% during that time. That is rather interesting, indeed."
No predictions?? Anyone?? Only 19 hours to go..
2018 we will see capitulation to the upside for THO. $300 is not out of the question. I'm not saying 2019 will not be a good year but you will want to own THO over this next year. Just saying...
"Let's play a game on this board. Everyone list the most rediculous excuse that they can think of, that we will hear next Tuesday on why Thor failed. Feel free to post more than one. I'll start... The hurricane season took its toll on the RV industry."
"Since the end of 2017 THO has gone from $164 to $115., that's about a 28% loss. The RV market since 2017 has had record setting quarters non stop. The RV market has never been stronger in the history of its existence. The DOW is up over 103% since THO has started it's collapse from $164. The dividend is miniscule, The debt has become unmanageable and the CEOs compensation has ballooned to over 10 million dollars a year. I believe that when management is finished milking the cow they will start to resign and retire with parachutes that will put the final nail into Thor. I see no future where Thor can survive and prosper. I believe Thor will not survive the next inevitable downturn in the RV industry. They are having a hard time trying to survive in the best of times. Does anyone see it any different? If so let's here how you think Thor can turn it around without a bankruptcy in it's future?"
"Lots of negativity on this board. For those wondering why it's going up, maybe do a little research rather then regurgitate yahoo and zacks headlines which are mostly bots designed to generate traffic with absurd headlines and stats, many of which are not even accurate."
"With Grand Design, Nexus, Winnebago and Forrest River around, why would anyone even stop by any of Thor's brands, even to look? The buzz at the RV shows is not good. Thor is the AMC of the RV industry. This story has a very unhappy ending I""m afraid. Last quarters blow out numbers sent this stock into a free fall. If they miss Tuesday this could be the end of this company I'm afraId. Should have sold 3 years ago."
Why was Thor up so much yesterday and up in AH? Did I miss news? Thank you.
"Dave, You think Thor is ""Riding the wave""?? It's down over 35%. Do you not understand this? Unless ""Riding the wave"" means collapsing, I don't believe you have any idea what you are talking about."
Wow - what a recovery.
If you go to their website it says GET OUT THERE. Wise words right now.
"Key level of support right here… In my opinion, the news that sent it down quite some time ago is being double counted. A few days left to run into earnings… I like the set up a lot"
look at my post from last week where I predicted the collapse to $104. Scarry huh.. My bankruptcy prediction by the end of 2023 is a solid prediction too. This is an ugly way to take a company private. Let's see if anyone goes to jail.
What's the matter? You don't like 5% dividend increases?
"Cup and handle, cup and handle.. Yup yup!! Where did you guys go??"
Bought 1000 @ $92 plus sold 10 90 puts for $4 so I'm in at $88. It's not supposed to be this easy. Gotta love those headline reading algos. If you get in at the open you can print money.
"DennisK, Why don't we talk about Thor? This is a Thor opinion board. I just give my opinion. Either everyone has me on ignore or I am being blocked? Not one person on this board disagrees with what I'm saying but nobody voices their own opinion. I only have 25% of my original position and just sold November 110 calls with what I have left and I hope they get called away."
"the demand for RVs is still massive but will probably peak next year. thor can ride the wave another year but after that it might become challenging. also their product quality is and has been bad, unfortunately I know first hand."
I expect a high volume and closing price near 
Why is this share so cheap?!
"2.5 years ago Thor bought Edwin Hymer. They exploded the number of outstanding shares by 20 million and took out a $2 billion dollar loan to make the $2 billion dollar acquisition. They promisedf to buy back the shares and pay off the debt as quick as possible. Well, 2.5 years later they still have 55 million outstanding and $2 billion in debt, they have done neither?? CEO still gets his 10+ million for some reason?? Why did Thor raise $4 billion dollars to buy a company for $2 billion?? Was the price for Hymer $4 billion dollars or $2 billion???"
There were lots of activity on Oct 15th (tomorrow) put $120 and $125 strike. Is it just because of option?
"Thanks for those $116 shares. Yes, you can buy them back for $118."
Wow!!! This company is in such a sweet spot right now. What a great earnings report! Outlook was worded well and conservative but that’s to be expected and undoubtedly they will blow it away.
The 14 second chart says $123.05-$123.07. Since the stock was $164 in 2017 I guess $130 in 2021 is something to wish for??? I don't think you realize how good the RV market has been over the last 5+ years and how cyclical this sector is. The down cycles are very brutal and the upsides are supposed to be the opposite but they are not. Lots of pain is right around the corner.
"Last year on October 20, there was also an 8% drop in front of dividends, is history repeating itself?"
Too bad it's a market sell off. THO would be up $20.
Did anyone resign? Is management baleing like I predicted?
Now it's down $3? DOW still up over 400 points??
I was reading that the CEO in 2018 made 14 million dollars?? Every company that Thor has acquired has a CEO. We are paying at least 19 CEOs and how much you want to bet most of these guys went to grade school together. I also read that the CEO has a liberal arts degree from Perdue. What does he know about billion dollar deals?? Yikes!!!
Cramer says Thor will have great earnings but don't buy the stock mmmmmmmm
The fear of a recession in October drove the stock down since THO is strongly related to the market's cycles. Seems that investors who think they can time the market still exist... long term (5 years plus) will always be the successfull approach not to be affected by yearly fluctuations like this one! Important not to forget that the dividends alone offer better yield than normal bank accounts.
Imagine if Tho joins with Tesla in making electrical RVs?
Great buying opportunity coming up @ $40...
Time of change! CEO and Chairman resign!Lousy dividend and high salaries!
"I feel like a school teacher with a class full of imbicyles. The lesson for today is that the 4 and 8 minute charts do not mean anything. Take a deep breath and look at the 6 month chart, grab a hanky and wipe your eyes. This is reality..."
I would advise everyone to go to YouTube and search Thor Industries. There are things from as many as 10 years ago. It is interesting to see how wrong the 10 million dollar a year CEO is wrong and has been wrong. Almost commicle if it weren't true.
"THO moved their release date to the 28th. They got some splaining to do, gonna come with a slide show on their website. I think they are going to splain the cup and handle theory.. lol"
"Market up 250 in premarket, THO down another $1 in premarket."
Pay the money back management!!!!!!!!
"Some grumblings appear to be happening in this whole trade-war thing. I expect the pair of (insert your favorite name here) leaders of Trump and Xi to soften trade tariffs in a combined effort to lubricate world economy and trade, again. But they'll make sure their friends are bought-into the market prior to that. This could spell a boost to such industries as RV. I would expect a bounce to $78 for THO and 31 for WGO."
Sales collapse...
When gas prices dropped to record low prices Thor's stock lost $120 per share. Now that gas prices are going up Thor's stock is getting clobbered. Can't win with this company.
"Anyone know how many ""joe""s there are posting on this thread?"
The pocket of the management are full!!!!
"Have been studying this stock for the past few months. read about it in Value Line, and watched the price fall over the past few months. I am having a hard time finding things I don't like about this company....No debt, decent Div, trading way off its highs, the only thing that makes me leery is that it is , or has the potential to be, very economy dependent...I can see a co like THO getting hammered during any downturn, which it in fact did over Q4 2018. That being said, this looks to me like the kind of company Warren Buffett likes to buy....solid financials, industry leader, growing....I am considering investing about 15-20% of my portfolio's worth in this company over the next few months...Am I missing anything here? any of you who have been following the company have any insights?Bob"
"huge miss on earnings, why is this showing up PM?"
Tuesday will be so disasterous that they will have to halt trading. This is how people react to a 5 billion dollar company that managed to rake up 3 billion in debt just before the industry is headed to the biggest slowdown in it's history. I believe we will do a dance in the $40's in the very near future and then bankrupt by the end of 2023. Does anyone see it any different?
"Outdoor companies are doing great look at $THO, up 9% after earnings announcement. I'm buying more $VSTO when it makes sense for me to do so. Betting $VSTO will beat estimates and pop on Nov 3. IMO"
"Thor makes every conceivable type of RV right now. They need to stop acquiring companies and start taking business away from their competition by building better RVs. Create a new name for gods sake. Instead of buying the competition, beat the competition."
"No deal, no debt. Will it be seen as a good thing for the stock?"
"Why a company would have to raise 500 million in this environment is beyond me, especially at 4%? If I were going to go bankrupt, I would buy all my friends company's for billions more then they are worth. Raise as much cash as I possibly could, even if I had to pay 4% and pay myself $14 million a year. That's what I would do."
"This is like riding the biggest roller coaster in the world. Tic Tic Tic Tic Tic Tic.. Slowly to the top, almost there..."
down 3 bucks in premarket per yahoo going under a 100 soon? yikes
"Thor could be $150 by Friday IMO. 51% Avg EPS growth, 34% Revenue growth, amd low Forward PE of 11. This stock is way way undervalue. Upgrades and new Price target should be rolling in the next few days."
"what is the rationale that the Northcoast analyst gave for his downgrade? the economy is fine, the stock market is up, more people are retiring why would the RV market be extended? his/her rationale does not compute."
"If Steven is right, I think investors need an education - and hopefully Happe addresses this on the earnings call. $THO makes use extensively of aluminum for their travel trailers. My RV is like that. Most they sell are aluminum. They are cheap, light and extremely popular. In fact, they claim the Jayco SLX is the best selling travel trailer in the country for like 20 years running. Most RVs you see out there are aluminum. Coleman, many Jayco, many Zinger, most Salem, everyone uses this design.$WGO on the other hand is almost exclusively fiberglass sided. So is Grand Design. In fact, between the two, I think there are only two trailers that come in aluminum siding - the Transcend Xplor and the Hike or Hike 100. The rest are fiberglass. It's one of the reasons they are more expensive, better quality and quieter interior.I'm talking primarily trailers. Class B are vans, so are probably steel, and Class A and C are a mix of fiberglass and steel. So I think this whole aluminum pricing thing is completely overblown."
May trade down to the mid 70's and have to wait for the earnings and debt reduction announcement. THO traded at $160+ when they were 1/3 the size they are now.
"5 years ago when Thor was trading in the $164 range and the DOW was at 17000, Thor seemed like it was set up for a great run. Since then the DOW has more then doubled to 35000 and THO has lost almost 40% of it's value and has taken on billions in debt. The CEO has pocketed over 50 million in compensation all the while the company was collapsing. You can put a fork in Thor. The RV industry will never have a 5 year run as great as the last 5 years have been. This is a $20 stock at the next down cycle before the bankruptcy. Who sees it any different and why?"
looks like 102.38 is next level down based on the chart. Should have some buyers step in there. $100 is likely a solid floor for the next 3 months.
"What happens to the George and Charley show? I miss those guys, they crack me up."
It pulled back because of closing of senior notes for $500 million....CEO is note a criminal . shorts on this board are desperate because they are loosing there pans even after the resent pull back
Citigroup upgrade to a buy with 150 target?
GREAT! Now we are only down $28 from where we were just a few months ago. The 30 minute chart does not tell the same story as the 6 month chart. Watch and try to learn something.
It will not be long before the debt is larger then the market cap. Welcome to bankruptcy!
"I think I get now about Joe. He lost his shirt on this stock, and now he has become a relentless specter haunting the message board in an attempt at revenge as he shows how brilliant he is. Since THOR is not going to $40, at some point, when his rancor wears him out and he can no longer breathe - Joe disappears like a wispy cloud on the wind."
is Joe talking to himself?
"From Joe on Winnebago site- joe2 days agoWGO in will be much better then Thor. I would like to see Thor buy WGO. Don't say it can't happen.From Tho website- joe yesterdayThor makes every conceivable type of RV right now. They need to stop acquiring companies and start taking business away from their competition by building better RVs. Create a new name for gods sake. Instead of buying the competition, beat the competition.Hmmm....."
We are very close to where we were 5 years ago according to the charts. I'm looking for a $60 down day in the not to distance future. It will crash long before they announce the you know what..
Every RV raises the loss! Its all about Alu!
Adding today. What a GIFT!All THO lines working 4 shifts full time. Best production ever in history.
Zack's says that Thor and the RV industry as a whole is #6 out of 250 sectors. What can they possibly be talking about? Their up revisions in their earnings forecast make Thor a #1 strong BUY??? Actually Thor is imploding and is trading at 6 month lows down 30% while the stock market is trading at all time highs. What Thor are they talking about? Can anyone else make sense to what Zack's is trying to say it do???
boy there sure isn't much trading volume for THO. Reason for wide swings. Good for day traders
https://go.trade-ideas.com/SHAj
THO has dropped 37% in less then 3 months on great news? It was a pretty good beat that set this stock into collapse mode.
"If Thor currently makes every conceivable type of RV, why would they feel the need to acquire more companies and not just compete? Every company they acquire comes with a CEO salary. This makes no sense to be paying 23 CEO salaries. The cost of business is not making any sense. The CEO of Airstream, Jayco, Heartland etc.. all make millions. I think it's time to bale and never look back."
"If there was some sort of stock repurchase plan going on like at any other profitable,public company, maybe we could avoid these $7 swings every day? Why would this stock be doing what it is doing? They announce a major expansion so I'm guessing there is not a demand problem. I am guessing it is the lack of effort in management to enhance shareholders value."
En route to 110 fast. where's the joe?
How can Thor have a market cap of only $5 billion when they spent close to $10 billion buying companies to create this $5 billion dollar company? Is this even possible?
E Z Money. Go baby !
Thor owns aluminum extrusion company that all RV manufacturers need. Thor also owns OEM supplier that every RV manufacturers need. Thor is $50 below their highs of 2017. The debt is approaching 3 billion.
I cant find why THO is tanking today.
"I’m still trying to understand the extent of the impact of tariffs on aluminum and steel for Thor. As far as exports, Thor sells internationally only to Canada so tariffs on exports is minimal. The entire industry tanked with Thor so it is an industry-wide issue. Also, institutional ownership is better than 90%, so in the thinly traded market, an exit would not be smooth. Finally, high gas prices did the industry in back in the oil crisis days but I don’t think we are there now. Finally, Zacks continues to downgrade the stock based on tariffs and rising costs of employment.At its current multiple and growth prospects, the stock appears to be fully discounting the risks (unless I am missing one that Joe will point out) and I am still positive."
Thinking of taking a long position here but don't have deep knowledge about the company. Just wondering if THO is taking any steps to electrify its motor fleet. Thank you!
OMG! Now Winnie just announced a $200M stock buyback program to replace their previous $70M program. Basically at the same time $THO issued $400M in new notes. I love Winnie so much both as a quality product and an unbelievably well run organization.
"Not even 2 years ago RVs were some of the most hated stocks in the market. Bargain basement level stocks. I sank money into them and for a long time nothing happened. But I held on and eventually the rally I was hoping for came. Own LCII, THO, and WGO. Big gains on all three and it appears the sky is the limit now. Be patient and you will be rewarded. That's the key to making money in the market. Almost 8 years of investing behind my belt and I've learned so much since I first started. Go RVs!!!"
"Steven, Is this another even bigger gift then the last 3 big gifts??"
"The CEO of Thor makes almost 3 times what the CEO of Winnebago makes, just saying..."
You need to go through the earnings more carefully. Camping World projects growth in the RV industry to be in the single digits vs double digits projected by the RV manufacturing companies.
IBD printed their article with a mistake in their earnings; I e-mailed them last night and I see they corrected the article to an EPS of $1.92 on earnings! This may be the problem.
"Thor is cheap. They carve out works for them. Cut out the fraud and withink a segment they would have wanted to totally write down anyway. And they reduced the purchase price by about 200 million and about 200 million reduced obligations, so a major discount to purchase price to remove a part of the business you would have trashed anyway, and now you don't have to worry about those fraudsters sabotaging things. German ops are probably cleaner, being that Hymer runs them and is staying a shareholder. https://seekingalpha.com/article/4237822-thor-industries-undervalued"
No more work @ Hymer!!!!!Beim Wohnwagenfabri#$%$en Hymer in Bad Waldsee (Kreis Ravensburg) versammelten sich laut der Gewerkschaft IG Metall 1.300 Menschen zu einer Demonstration.
We will more dividend!!!!!!!!!!
"So, THO beat on revenue and on EPS; one time non re-occuring charge: So, they beat on EPS by 10 cents at 1.92.On a per-share basis, the Elkhart, Indiana-based company said it had profit of $1.51. Earnings, adjusted for pretax expenses, were $1.92 per share. Seems this info was on the cloudy side of the report, another great quarter. And now we all know that the dumb down grade was based on a distorted month of December, which was the coldest Dec. on record in the south part of US. With this new info the ""cloud"" has been cleared and now it is full steam ahead. On ward and up ward.I also advise put the ""RANTING JOE"" on mute!! He is all over the map!!"
Inching up from after market dip of yesterday. This is a great time to buy and add positions. Next week in 110s
"If $2 billion in debt dropped the stock from $152 to $109, what will $3 billion in debt do? We will know soon, any predictions?"
Is the police sleeping? Bob Martin has to go to jail!!!!
Soon we will actually be lower then we were before the blowout quarter. Thor needs to just file already. I'm not sure if 11 or 13 is the way to go.
"Just got back from camping. It was wall to wall and the only RV's that are out there are Jayco, Grand Design, Keystone and Forrest River, in that order and I did see one Hymer..."
Hahahaha Hahahaha to you who doubt me..$96...
$250 million share buyback. Stock should hit $108 this week
and now $4 almost all of the gains from the great earnings release have vanished. I'm guessing under $100 by the end of the month.
BUY BUY BUY!
60.19 down
Hymer factory will no more produce RV! The union has burnt it down!!!
Wow ... Reported $2.05 EPS vs. $1.56 expected on revs of$2.54B vs. $2.37B expected. I told you sales are through the roof.
Looks like Moonshot is left holding the bag. Hey how are you at musical chairs??
10% straight up despite worsening fundamentals. Congrats to the longs.
You can always count on Joe for the glass empty outlook in here! I think he may be the only guy that posts he ran everyone else out lol.
"I would not be holding this through earnings next week or any other time. Nobody will be buying the excuses that come out of the 10 million dollar mans mouth. The debt and the margins will send everyone to the exits. I am looking for the stock to collapse into the $40 range rather quickly after earnings It will continue to get worse until they announce their inevitable bankruptcy by the end of 2023 and the stock becomes worthless. Does anyone see it any other way? Can Thor exist when the debt becomes larger then their market cap? Which bankruptcy chapter do you file when you want to restructure your debt, Chapter 11 or 13??"
Mentioned on fast money halftime with WGO
The train has left the station.
"Book value is 49! Never! Still remember when it dropped to $34 a few yrs ago, over hyped, too much DEBTS"
Is THOR doing anything to pay off that debt? That and a low dividend is holding back the stock.
"Thor Industries Option Volume Rises, Led by Oct. 15, $120 Puts"
"All eyes on PAYO, PSFE, FINV"
The problem with downunder tiger is that this guy has very small down under
One analyst says strong buy and one says strong sell. They both can't be right. Pick a side..
I'm taking the generous premium on the out of the money CALLS and hopefully they get called and I can move on to greener pastures. This is the worst 20 year investment ever made.
I have no idea why this stock is down 25 points this week? My guess is that a big run up is on its way. They are saying best year for RV's in over a decade. Maybe there is something up with Hymer??
Market is up another 521 and THO is down $4. Go figure..
Any predictions for tomorrow? my guess is that we open up in the mid-$70's after they announce and lower the out look. Does anyone think Thor management will be asked how come they paid $580 million for a $30 million company. Does anyone think Thor will explain why they sunk 100 million into a free website? See you all at $74 on Thursday!
options expire today. Monday will be telling.
No news!!!! What's going on?
"As THO inches closer to the $100 price, things should begin to excelerate going into earnings and then after earnings the bottom falls out. Thor better sell more RVs so they can pay the 10 million + CEOs salary. Did you ever wonder how many RVs need to be sold just to pay the CEO? It's got to be 50-60 thousand of them. Bankrupt by the end of 2023 and the resignations should start by spring. You heard it here first, no cup and handle going on here.."
on the move recently
Thanks Moonshot! I'll take that to the bank.. hahahahaha!! Lol..
What type of RV environment would Thor need to prosper if this is not it?
Earnings leak?
"Hey Moonshot, Cup and handle, cup and handle... Should see $25 today.. Cup and handle..lol"
"Thor, if managed correctly would have been over $200 years ago. It was $164 with 0 debt in 2017 when it had just under 4 billion in sales. Now, Thor has 12 billion in sales and a $125 share price and 3 billion in debt. Someone deserves an F instead of a 10 million + compensation package."
I was scanning YouTube for Thor Industries and ran into the one where the 10 million dollar a year CEO says he will not raise prices on RVs because he likes to see people enjoying the RV lifestyle. This guy needs to be fired immediately. He has no idea what he is doing or saying..
"Market goes up, THO goes down. Market goes down, THO goes down and on the days that the market is unchanged, THO goes down."
"George, Institutions own 92.83%, NOT ""Close to 50%"".. Are you aware that the profit on $11 Billion revenue is only a little over 1 billion? Thor has spent billions and billions building this company and margins don't go up?? Did you know when Thor over pays for the companies they acquire the existing management stays in place. Do you know how many President and vice presidents salaries Thor pays? This company is an over bloated scam. Everyone gets rich except for the shareholders. Be prepared to be left holding the bag, it's coming.."
The whole sector is down. End of summer? Beginning of end of pandemic?
I am doing research on THO vs WGO. any comments on either company is highly appreciated.
They had some interesting insights about THO on (http://Fairstox.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
Prodoction problems! No more windows....
Why wouldn't Thor make an RV that competes with Tiffen or create a B class to compete with Hymer instead of paying billions for these companies that struggle to be profitable? Thor does make A class and B class that compete already. This us a lose lose proposition.
I hate to say it but capitulation could bring us down to $60.
"Thor has spent over 9 billion building this 6 billion dollar company and the CEO makes over 10 million a year. If you invest in Thor, you deserve to lose all your money. Thor will bankrupt itself by the end of 2023 in my opinion."
"Why is the 1.8 billion debt not being paid off? This debt will take over 25 years to pay off at this pace . Weak dividend, collapsing share price and mismanaged company. Why would anyone invest in THO? What is the benefit? The stock market has nearly doubled in the last 5 years and THO stock has lost money in this same time period?"
Will Thor have to take on more debt to pay the compensation of this over compensated management? Maybe the shareholders should set up a go fund me page for these guys.
It's obvious nobody can handle the truth. Do you think Maxaire is worth 800 million? Do you think Hymer was worth 2 Billion? Jayco a billion? Thor spends all these billions and now they are 3 billion in debt and only a 6 billion dollar company itself.
what's the deal mid day dive
"The only thing that the CEO is doing correct, is not having a share repurchase plan."
Thor issued $2 billion more shares of stock to purchase Hymer. Thor also took out a $2 billion dollar loan from a bank to repurchase the shares they diluted. Thor is $2 billion in debt and the share count has not gone down? Does anyone know where the $4 billion went? Thor is only a $5 billion dollar company??
look at your portfolio. What is your worst performing stock. Let me guess... THO..
https://trendytoros.com/stocks/opinions/tho/
Any idea why the 4% drop?
down 2pts in after hours per yahoo?
The best bargain I have seen this year. Thank You Northcoast.
"if I were short, I would be happy? I just never had a stock that dropped $107 points in 10 months before. With record sales and record profits one would think the stock would be a good one."
We are now below where we were before the blowout quarter was announced. congratulations!
"THO is a fantastic fundamental business and it’s history of ROIC is consistent. Hymer deal will add to THO revenue and give a 30% market share in Europe. I agree it’s still a falling knife at this point, but I’ll be opening a position around $40 and continue to stockpile though out 2019."
Production is down in Bad Waldsee. No more Hymer.The workers step down the work.

@Joe - Why do you think this company has attracted and held the attention and money of the institutional investors so long?
9/28 earnings report. This should be one helluva good qtr for THO. Buckle up!
We are at the mercy of the cycle and poor management. We will need a lot of luck to make any hay. There is no organic growth. The cost of revenue is more then the revenue itself. Thor not thriving in this environment is very alarming.
It seems that THO is waiting for upgrades and analyst opinion before it goes higher. The problem is that Thor management does not give guidance or answer analyst questions for some reason. 10 years ago They used to but stopped they used to give preliminary earnings between earnings release. My point is THO will never get meaningful upgrades or comments from analyst until they talk to them.
Any thoughts on this bought calls today pre trump tweet. Down a lot as one might imagine. Oct 100 and 105 calls any advice appreciated
Adding more.
Stock up over 3 bucks this morning. Rise in covid making people rethink cruise ships and flying?
Thor industrie CEO is like Bernie Madoff!!!!!
Great earnings+Healthy Econ+Tariffs a non issue+growing backlog=135+ next week. And that is very conservative and realistic. No one left to sell. Last weak hands out yesterday.
This happens every time I buy a stock.

"Sales were not ""pulled ahead"" because of COVID. It was the ADOPTION that was pulled ahead. The adoption to RVing that will not go away. People who buy these usually start smaller and trade up every 3-5 years as their family, needs and desires change. If you follow the world of RVing you know people that can't get the product they want and companies like Thor have a huge backlog. They will eventually catch up with enough product to meet demand but my point is that most of the increased interest is here to stay."
"If I were planning on going bankrupt, the first thing I would do is stop paying my debts, I would never raise the dividend and I would pay myself $10 million dollars a year. Just saying...."
Closing 101 or 102 today.
Motorhome dealer hits record sales as Britons continue to embrace staycations
Wait till the bottom falls out. This only gets worse from here on out.
I wonder if the after-hours collapse means anything?
It feels like Christmas with all the gifts....
"Joe, I’m becoming pretty sure your views of Thor are warped and you refuse to discuss anything but dire predictions. First of all, it takes a measure of debt to forecast bankruptcy and that is simply not the case with Thor. Secondly, the stock has declined because of observed declines in RV parks and tariffs on their raw materials. Both will not be permanent. Finally, the trends of retirement travel are long demographics now as the baby boomers lead in every era of their spending. You ignore realized growth rates and equity returns and devalue management’s capability in producing both. Of course you are welcome to your views but I personally find them misleading. I also hope posters here will do their own research too."
"over reaction after market, should consolidate and move up as earnings were decent and company doing good."
"If you own less then 10000 shares, the 5% dividend raise is really just PR. I see $104 in the real near future on the way to the upcoming bankruptcy announcement coming by the end of 2023. Does anyone see it any other way?"
"As the market starts to fail, people will be out of their homes and into RVs. Boom market coming :) :)"
What is going on with THO? Its my only stock that's red today.
It's all about aluminum pricing.
"Hey folks, I’m not as optimistic as Charlie. But, I think we have a pretty good shot at $123 - if we can shake off the resistance at $117. After that we should be aiming at a fairly open road to $129.Do your own due diligence, of course, I’m no pro. But, I think it’s time to warm up and stretch, let’s get ready to run with the bulls!"
Probably needs a little pause before the run to $130
It's because Joe runs them down daily LOL. Paid per post...look at his history.
If gas prices keep rising sales will tank.
"I remember in the past that great, blowout numbers did nothing to the stock price and then 3 or 4 days after the earnings release the stock soared seemingly for no reason. this stock can be $140 by year end."
Thor needs to purchase a few more RV manufacturers so they can keep up with the market share they are losing. What's the difference if you are $2 billion in debt or $4 billion if you can't afford to pay either debt off anyway? Bonuses for everyone!!!
Not if but when does WGO's share price pass the share price of Thor? It's getting close. Thors net profit is less then 1% while WGO's is 4%. It seems that Management's inability to find a single synergy with all the RV manufacturers that they own is rediculous. Their desire to keep the acquired companies as separate entities so they can have 19 presidents salaries to pay and 61 vice president is even more rediculous. Let's see if the president of Hymer and the president of Airstream and the president of Keystone and the president of Thor Motor coach and the president of CRV and the president of Bison and the president of Heartland can all drink coffee out of the same coffee pot instead of having 20 different coffee pots.
