"This recent $50 share price collapse has happened in the best, record breaking times that Thor has ever seen and may have ever seen. Now everyone is downgrading and announcing an RV slowdown. Where is Thor going next?"
The shorts are pumping hard on this board. From a 4% loan to high input costs. That's generally a sign of desperation from shorts. Real shorts keep their mouth shut and then cash in. I have no position but may buy some shares and enjoy the squeeze.
"If you look, the good press started just about when Thor began it's collapse in the mid $150's. Don't believe what you read. ""Great Value stock"". ""Time to buy Thor"". ""Thor is growing it's dividend"" etc..."
Biggest over reaction to some whale putting on a bunch of puts (Nov) that Iâ€™ve have ever seen. Buy!
"Earnings summary: $1.0B in rev, 40% growth YOY, EPS of $2.57, 77.2% growth YOY. These are absolutely staggering numbers. I guess one could consider this growth temporary as the RV boom wanes, but I highly doubt that is the case for a couple reasons: A) there is a cohort of boomers who are retiring, some retiring early, to enjoy life and travel, but don't want to fly or cruise with Covid-19 still around, so are buying RVs to see the country (like my parents). B) young families (like mine) are camping and RVing as the new normal trip, vacation or long weekend C) people who live on lakes or on the coast are never going to stop buying boats, whether Chris Craft or Barletta. You could say the same about $BC as a cheap, wise investment right now.Furthermore, as I said earlier, Winnebago is eating Thor's lunch. Literally taking market share with better quality products, better business decisions and better finances. While $THO was issuing new notes to raise capital, $WGO was boosting dividend by 50% and approving $200M buyback. I mean, if that's not financial strength, I'm not sure what is.This takes our current PE to 8.46 and our future PE to 7.27 assuming 25% growth next quarter. Every quarter we set new records while the stock treads water because people are too busy chasing unprofitable technology to the moon.I've said this before. We've suffered various downgrades on the great outdoors and related products. I think these are way overdue for a huge rally when people realize these activities and sports are here to stay. $ASO $DKS $PII $HMC $VSTO $BC $WGO $THO $CWH $LCII"
"I rage-deleted all my YF posts during one of the recent market selloffs, but I'm coming here second to start over. $WGO is my favorite holding, but it has underperformed this year. I'm not sure why. I suspect people think the RV boon is over and everyone is going back to cruising tomorrow, or the next day, or the next day, which still hasn't happened. 30% of the US isn't vaccinated. A grand total of ZERO American kids under 12 are vaccinated.But none of that really matters, because families have picked up new hobbies and vacations over the last year. They rented and purchased RVs, boats, ATVs, golf clubs and other outdoor sports. I've RVed with my kids for almost 10 years. I have neighbors and friends coming up to ask how we like it, how to tow, where we go, etc. This isn't a dying fad. It's the new norm. $THO just blew out estimates and cited increasing demand, but then offered stock which shows why Winnie is a significantly better investment IMO. Plus WInne has diversification with Chris Craft and Barletta Pontoons. Plus Winnie makes a better product than Jayco. And on the back of most boats is a Mercury thanks to $BC. $PII $CWH $HZOSupply chain issues for all of these companies may exist, but will abate. People aren't going to stop buying toys for their lake properties or camping trips. In fact, every time we've bought an RV, we've wanted the next size/step up. We went from pop up to hybrid to travel trailer. So people are basically lifelong customers."
I cant find why THO is tanking today.
If Thor would have taken some of the billions they blew on overpriced acquisition and bought billions of dollars worth of stock we would be much better off. Why the redundancy in buying a bunch of manufacturers that manufacture the same things.
"Thor is the best stock in the United States. Don't only look at the price, the raising of the dividend and their acquisitions are second to none. BUY BUY BUY!!! $300 by year end.."
"I'll post one more summary for anyone surfing around or considering these names. Investors have written off recreational products as dead. Most of these trade in the low teens or single digits, which is a serious discount to the market. Comps may be tough, but business is still booming. Consumers have records amount of savings to spend in the next year. Supply chain problems are working themselves out. Backlogs will take two to three years just to restock to historical levels. With some of these stocks, simple PE expansion to the normal ratios mean they would almost double.I would even lump outdoor products like $JOUT and $VSTO and autos like $F and $GM in here too. Totally unloved and poised for huge upside in the next 12 months.$WGO $THO $BC $PII $HOG $LCII $PATK $MBUU $MCFT $HMC"
Looks like we will see the shares drop under $100 today. I'm expecting to see the low $80's.
"Despite how well the sales of the company are, there are many unhappy consumers. In the past two days, without even looking, I have stumbled upon many people who have purchased brand new RVs built by Thor and their subsidiaries that are falling apart, built with substandard quality, and hazardous. This seems to have become the industry standard for big RV companies these past few years, but those buying RVs now will not continue to accept this. It would help if Shareholders demanded better quality control, more ethical practices from the manufacturer, and more regulations to protect consumers."
if this goes down to 85 I'll loaaad the boat!
The-10-Mio-CEO get today a salary of US$ 30'000. For one day.
What's going on in THO? Didn't they just have great earnings and raised divi?
"Simply Wall Street fair market value of THO is $245.80. Do you own due diligence but I believe it is quite undervalued also. Low PE, growing EPS rapidly, massive backlog, etc. etc."
$ 16 billion backlog with market cap just under $ 6 billion? So undervalued.
"THO .49 sales with large backlog too cheap, even with higher input costs."
"I purchases a Jayco unity from Thor Industries a few months back and it's experienced catastrophic failures (faulty axle that shredded tire <1k miles) - In researching the issue I've learned of many others with the same poor manufacturing. It's only a matter of time before someone's family dies due to the criminal negligence of Thor and their manufacturers. This industry doesn't have the oversight it needs to protect consumers and investors from corporate greed. I wouldn't invest $1 in Thor, and I'd recommend if you're going to - do it short. Eventually their constitutional inability to take accountability for their practices will make the news and deteriorate shareholder value. This has been a public service announcement."
Board sure is quiet.
