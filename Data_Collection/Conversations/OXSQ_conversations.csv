"Pre covid SP was $5.5 to $6.5, yearly pay out was $.804 at a 14.5%++ rate. I understand cutting back if their income fell, but now the SP is $4 to $5, pay out is $.42 at 9.8%. What's changed--the NAV, the proformance of their assets, the managers ability, the general market?Does this fund, like some others, set their monthly dividend goal based on a short period of time from the prior Dec? Since the dividend doesn't change it must be based on something that also doesn't change."
Extra 139 shares bought my me at 4.21 today. Love the lower price
Anyone know when they are posting earning or having a call?
I guess OXSQ is up because it was confused with OXLC. As they actually raised their distribution .01. LOL
Why the jump? not just because they announced earning date? Inside info?
FYI- Updated broker 1099 for 2020. Looks like more of the distribution is now considered ROC.https://ir.oxfordsquarecapital.com/historic-prices-distributions/distributions/default.aspx
Oxford Square Capital is down 5.02% to 4.35
I'm still skeptical on this investment...because if you look at dividend history.. it's been in a down trend since 2017... 0.29 down to .035... granted prior to covid it was .067 so still.... in a down trend.I still have some money in this but not as much as I use too.
Consistent divi...cheers.
"looks like we got a buy upgrade yesterday- On September 2, 2019 Refinitiv/Verus upgraded OXFORD SQUARE CAPITAL CORPORATION ( OXSQ ) from HOLD to BUY."
Most recent dividend was not reinvested. Broker said OXSQ may not DRIP. Anyone knowledgeable?
9/22/21 More inside buys for Cohen and Saul.....Forms 4 disclosed
Lowered their dividend as a precaution to COVID. NRZ did same thing but yesterday raised it. Do think they will increase it back to .067 monthly slowly but surely one all things stabilize which will put their stock price back into the 6's.
9/24/21 More Form 4s from Cohen and Saul. Bought another 12500 shares each. At $4.09
Someone obviously decided to unload this. Can't find any news to account for the drop. Somebody know something or just noise?
I wonder if price keeps going down because of low volume. I can't find any news affecting the price.
"Almost 4 weeks in a row with nonstop buying from me. Just wait for the dividend to jump at the end of September. You can quote me on this. We will see at 5-6 cents monthly dividend, average buy price for me is $4.93, diamond in the rough till 7$ then will reevaluate"
Little disappointed we did not get a div boost. Happy with the NAV growth.
"It looks like the dividend payout is the same, but monthly now instead of quarterly. What would the strategy be behind a move like that?"
Should be room to grow from here. In at $7.03
