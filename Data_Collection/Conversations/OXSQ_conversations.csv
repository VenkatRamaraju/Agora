"Lets see what earnings bring for this stock.Personally, we believe the dividend will remain the same payout amount.Stock price rising today is interesting today. Hope people who got in are happy."
"When is the next SPO ??? Form updated at SEC again.This does not sound good ...... ZERO, well it 3.5 months ago.... It should be noted that the capital gains incentive fee calculated as of September 30, 2016, is zero, which is calculated based upon an assumed liquidation of the entire portfolio, and no other changes in realized or unrealized gains and losses, as of September 30, 2016 and"
Anyone else excited for the mcdividend?
Where is my mcdividend?
No 52 week low today !
"a friend of mine was telling me about this stock and saying that it is a good investment. everyone says that my friend is a little different, so i am not sure about investing in it."
THIS STOCK WILL GO TO $ 6
Would be nice to see TICC go monthly like Oxrford Lane
OXSQZ is up 13.14% to 20.93
Why would Cohen own shares and buy more and then give himself ROC and then buy more shares. Is there an end to CDO's coming. Does this guy have gains somewhere he needs to offset with losses.
I've never rec'd so many voting forms for one company. I have never been contacted by mail and by phone like I have with this company.I think it all has to do with the Investment Advisory Agreement and who is going to be making the decisions going forward for TICC.
Here we go! Now I’m only down 40% overall with this bad boy! Glad I kept adding at $2.50!!!
up up
"Dividend dropped to 20 cents a quarter. Will probably drop more in the future. I don't see they can give this stock a buy rating, and how did they go from an EPS .12CENTS TO A 1.92 in less than a month. Everything about this stock just doesn't add up. I glad I sold this when it was over $9 a share."
Futures up for any reason?
Anyone know why this stock has fallen so much over the last week?
Another stunning performance turned in by OXSQ's crack management team. I hope these guys don't carry cash in their pockets as they would lose most of it in a days time. Income dependent retirees screwed again.
9/22/21 More inside buys for Cohen and Saul.....Forms 4 disclosed
very good time to buy IMO
Do any of you have shares in OXSQ sister company OXLC..like I do......paying %17 dividends ?? Cohen is the CEO of both companys.
"Stashing more cash here. MP is settled around NAV, and hasn't chaos crashed with the rest of the market so far lol"

Up on heavy volume. Anyone see any news?
Oxford Square Capital is down 4.97% to 3.25
The upward price movement has stalled since early April. Thoughts anyone on the future?
"Holding tight here, let's see how things look when the grace period is up and everyone has to make their loan payments XD"
"Should I buy? I was looking at the stock price and mshagone on a long slow ride down since Nov 2013. I like the dividends, but don't want to invest in a company loosing it. Any insights would be appreciated. Thanks."
Ouch earnings looked a little lackluster but still posted a eps of 6 cents.
Extra 139 shares bought my me at 4.21 today. Love the lower price
"It looks like the dividend payout is the same, but monthly now instead of quarterly. What would the strategy be behind a move like that?"
Any thoughts on if the dividend will be maintained? Any predictions on earnings for this past quarter? Thanks.
Vote your shares !!!
I wasnt able to hear the call. Did i miss something? Whats with the 14% drop
"Earnings release date is tomorrow, 11/2. Yet, the stock dropped 35 cents which is 5.5% today. Sure looks like someone leaked negative news on the quarterly earnings today. Not a happy camper. We shall see what tomorrow morning brings."
ZERO coming soon.
"Does anyone think this stock will reach $10.00 in 2017? The dividend is doing fantastic. The dow is going to reach 20,000 in a matter of days."
what I'll be doing in a few days
Those who got in around the early $6's may well bail after X day for they will get the div and agreat profit as well--this stock is well over the target price of $6---go TICC
It looks like TPG could be liquidating their position on Tuesday and today. Probably tomorrow too. Sit tight and stock should come back next week.

I am going to add a few more. I hope it stops going down.
"Sitting with 15550 shares at much higher price and thinking best play is to sell early next week and wait for a sell off into the mid $6.50's. With the lack luster trading after the drop it's hard to see it being pushed higher right after EX. Like the stock and think BBC's should do well, but the interest rate issue going to be a drag."
"Umm, why are we jumping pre market? I can't find any news"
I brought more at 4.17 a the day of the last upgrade. Clearly I should have brought a lot more
FYI Fellow BAG HOLDERS.New IRS form issued adjusting the ROC portion of the dividends for 2018. Dated 9/10/19.http://ir.oxfordsquarecapital.com/Distributions
still waiting on divy? anyone else?
Oxford Square Capital is down 5.11% to 4.83
I'm still skeptical on this investment...because if you look at dividend history.. it's been in a down trend since 2017... 0.29 down to .035... granted prior to covid it was .067 so still.... in a down trend.I still have some money in this but not as much as I use too.
TICC - pays nice dividends and my brokerage company has the stock rated 9.6 very bullish. So I bought 5000 shares today. 
OXSQZ is up 10.03% to 16.23
"I know few things are guaranteed, but OXSQ's dividend history is excellent and now at 15% is pretty tempting to add more. I figure it will be back to around 10% soon, but only because of rising share price. Not the most exciting stock, but it'll pay the bills."
In the mean time I’ll take the divvy
OXSQZ down 3.25% today . . .going the wrong way!
I agree with Rory. Insider buying keeps me confident in the long run. If they'll buy in the mid 6's...
divi staying at .29.....pay date is 30 sep 2016. BUY BUY BUY
TICC is down -4.91% to 6.00
Saul and Jon have been buying like lots almost everyday in March. 2.5M share ownership between them.
Any legitimate news showing this negative slide? This downward trend is painful. Very close to my stop loss. I would sure like to see OXSQ recover.

"Bought on the downward gloom, now bring on that upward boom!!"
"Sorry Mak. I love this stock. When I can find a company with and EPS greater than the dividend payout I'm in. I know my dividends are covered without relying on projections to cover. I think this company is a solid buy and hold for any ETF or long term investor. Plus with the current and upcoming rate increases, companies will be looking for cheap capital. With Trump in house and a republican house and senate, companies will be encouraged to spend that capital...think about it. Bringing jobs back to the US. I foresee TICC dancing around $8.50-$10 by years end. A bonus on this is that in order to maintain their tax status, TICC has to distribute $'s back to their share holders almost like an MLP. Oh and any insider buying is a good thing, no matter the amount."
looking good
"This dip is my buying opportunity then sit back, watch it climb plus collect .20 share for the next 3 quarters."
Any speculation on the recent assent in share price here? Share buy back resulting in this much movement? Hmmm

Nice little bounce today. Two more days like today hope will prevail. Pay da on FRiday so might add more!
Investment income up again
"Anyone have an understanding as to why the NBV dropped so significantly? This goes without saying, but it does not bode well for investor return. This stock while it continues to pay a decent dividend (including paying back of capital-which isn't a win for the investor), I'm concerned with a decrease in NBV as much as this reflects."
"Up 3.5% after hours today, hope yet!"
OXSQ reached a 52 Week low at 4.86
Any predictions on what the dividend payment might be for Q4 or are we receiving one?
A nice consistent upward trend the past couple of weeks. Up 0.04 today. I would like to see OXSQ break through the $7 glass ceiling within the next 40-60 days.
This stock is like Gold. Drip Baby Drip. If you know what I mean.
Loaded up yesterday!
"Does anyone have an opinion on a ""special dividend payment?"" Is this typical? If so, any speculation on what that might look like? I've been long on this stock for a while and decided starting this year to DRIP."

Starting to wonder if loading up the other day was a smart move.....lol
"And the race back up to $6 is on, Congrats to those who pulled the trigger and bought when we where down."
"Ben, I think the board knows that you have a pretty good position and that you are dripping every quarter. I mean, you have only mentioned it 20 times already...as in EVERY POST YOU POST ON HERE. We get it, we don't need to be reminded for Christ's sake!"
"For declaring dividends for the next 3 months, you’d think this would be up more"
love it loaded holding
got in yesterday at a $5.13 average...………...love the yield...…….
"TICC made a very large upside move July 3 on three times average volume. This tells me there is some important news coming of which we are as yet unaware. I bought the stock on the basis of great fundamentals, an incredible dividend (that could possibly be cut, but still be ample) PLUS the amazing and consistent amount of insider buying. Take a look at the slew of buying by insiders over the past two years and NO insider sales. You will hardly ever find this kind of insider buying with any stock. Most importantly, the insider buys are open market purchases where they paid what you and I pay, not buying at zero dollars, as you see with other stocks.Finally, TICC is an incredible bargain when you examine its chart over the past couple of years and I do like bargains."

Hope this gets to 4 by end of month
big sell this morning... see that lot on the drop?

"Pre covid SP was $5.5 to $6.5, yearly pay out was $.804 at a 14.5%++ rate. I understand cutting back if their income fell, but now the SP is $4 to $5, pay out is $.42 at 9.8%. What's changed--the NAV, the proformance of their assets, the managers ability, the general market?Does this fund, like some others, set their monthly dividend goal based on a short period of time from the prior Dec? Since the dividend doesn't change it must be based on something that also doesn't change."
Why are people selling their shares? There is still a dividend right?
No news. Why is stock spiking AH? Anybody knows?
And I'm officially in for the ride!
"OXSQ rocking, been holding since 2013 and have bought shares in the 4 dollar range. This has been one of my besr plays. Hopefully we can pull past 8 soon."

I'll take it. Nice move so far.
who just dumped?
was the div paid 9 29 17 but how much? should be .2225 cents was it?
Some one tell me why I should not buy this stock.
Is 33% dividend is real for this stock ?
What's up with TICC ?
OXSQZ is up 10.69% to 22.15
Another stellar job by TICC's crack management team! How good does the economy have to be before these buffoons move the net asset value and earnings up for a change?
looking for that move back above 7

"021021021..you are either mentally unstable or don't understand what's going on... probably both. Look at Q, footnote to SOI...for tax purposes there are $167 million in unrealized losses, and at year-end there were $67 million in capital loss carryforwards. So the dividends you received were taxed as ordinary (non-qualified dividends) and the capital losses, which are directly related to the difference between tax and accounting treatment, will never be utilized. That is where the loss of NAV has occurred and why TSLX points out that the dividend is unsustainable. But don't worry about that...keep talking nonsense."
Hopefully it crawls to $8
How can this POS company lie about their dividends? Advertised .60 and paid .06
Can anyone tell me how this is taxed in a Roth IRA? Does it work like a MLP ? UBIT rule? thanks
I got in at 6.25 anyone see any reason this should not hit $7 within the next month?
Anyone have any insight in this?
What's up with the big drop after hours?
J-E-T-S...are you there? HVB
Another 250 shares for me today at $4.685. Income stream keeps getting better on my end lol prediction of mine still stands that at the end of the month we see 6-7 cent a month dividend announcement. This is one of the best stocks to use drip with.
Oxford Square Capital is up 5.14% to 3.27
Excited for my mcdividend
Lowered their dividend as a precaution to COVID. NRZ did same thing but yesterday raised it. Do think they will increase it back to .067 monthly slowly but surely one all things stabilize which will put their stock price back into the 6's.
insider buying

"Glad I ended up selling out pre EX, but now starting to buy back in again. Same old game, you hold for the Dividend then get clobbered post EX until about a month before new EX. Some times buying and holding works, but in this case seems better to cash in on the run up to EX."
it's skyrocketing
Time for a Hostile bid!!!!!
Wonder what brought on the big jump yesterday after-hours. Any ideas?
They’re trying real hard to hit the 5.63 target. Down 17% in less than two weeks.
Hope this goes up today with the Market!

Hot buy all the way to 7$ I'm loading up and using drip to ramp up the gains. Good look to everyone
Great divi announcement and premarket likes the news.
Just did a little more research and my numbers were a little off. Dividend payout ratio is actually only 23.4 percent. Making the case even stronger that the dividend will be increased this year.
"It appears as though the proxy battle continues. One noteworthy observation that I think folks should take a look at...if you are a current shareholder, take a look at the TICC distributed proxy propaganda. They are comparing their returns to a point when the stock was at a low. If you look at the TPG propaganda, you will notice the total return. Just be aware of the information being sent to you from both sides. Read, educate, and make an informed vote. :)"

EARNINGS 10/26....... Let there be something positive ! Will we see NAV increase??? LOL
What’s the PR? This stock is up 25% in two trading days. I don’t see anything for this reaction.
can someone please explain how this stock can afford to pay out such a high dividend
Most recent dividend was not reinvested. Broker said OXSQ may not DRIP. Anyone knowledgeable?
I love this stock. Just sit and watch it go up and divi.
Its exciting how much this company continues to grow. And you seriously cannot go wrong with a dividend reinvestment program with this company. I am so glad Donald Trump is going to be our next president. He is going to turn stocks into gold.
"I want to buy more around 5 or lower 6, but its not moving like how it was last year. Do you guys think it'll see the 5s before the next divi payment?"
Share offering announced
Oxford Square Capital is down 4.92% to 4.53
Novak (IND.) and Royce (1.9% holder) are up for election and a proposal to issue/sell shares below NAV as long as it does not exceed 25% of outstanding shares.So are the TICC stakeholders HAPPY with the business as it moves forward?? Is Novak a true independent? or Cohen boy?GLTA
Dos anybody know in what year this company started?
Oxford Square Capital is down 5.21% to 2.91

Entry plan at 16th March after dip from dividend?
"are you serious? that ""excellent"" record in their proxy is based upon the low point of the company in early 2009 (when share price had dropped to about $3.50) so of course it looks better when it ""recovers"" to $5.67. If you measure it from early 2007, when price was $16.91, performance is awful! Choosing an arbitrary starting point to measure return is the oldest trick in the book...So just measure it from inception to judge management's real long-term performance... Since inception they lost $9.33 in share value and have paid about $12.59 in dividends...that's the performance...$3.26 return over 12-13 years for a $15.00 investment...super. I don't care if you vote for management or not, just realize what you are doing...and posting."
"I just got a couple more proxy sheets in the mail yesterday, one gold and one white. I have lost count of how many of these forms I have received. This is really something. Somebody has a big stake in the outcome of this vote. As shareholders we obviously do, but I see it as the mgmt fighting over the cash cow called TICC."
Looks like it’s on it’s way up
I don't understand what the note's offering impact is. Is this a share dilution?
"Any stocks that are involved with the Cohen brothers I don't touch. Bought TICC Quite a while back made a fee bucks a share, and collected dividends for 6 quarters, and got out. Glad I did."

"With all the refinancing in CLOs is it still worth buying TICC? Oxford Lane, TICC sister fund is still paying out similar dividends as they did most of last year and is managed by the same people. If so then now is the time to buy TICC, price hasn’t been this low for a long time."

just converted my OXSQ from my Ira to a roth. OXSQ will be back over $4 in a blink dividend cut if any will be short lived. Just follow the book value.....the bottom is in and it is increasing earnings will follow
Why the big jump today? I need this to get back to $5 to get even
Should be room to grow from here. In at $7.03
Decent quarter. NAV up to 4.88 should set a floor at the current sp. Maybe we get something interesting on the EC but i doubt it since the div didnt change. Looks like another 3 months of drifting upwards.
"Anyone have target points at which they would sell oxsq at? Ive been holding and adding tiçc since 2013 and have shares as low as 4.80. Im considering sell about 20% if it breached 7.50 to lock in,some,profits then move to a safe cef like pcef temporarily to hedge against the effects of tarrifs and tax cuts. I still believe oxsq will continue its upwards climb past the 8s by next year. Thoughts?"
"As previously announced by the Company, our Board of Directors had declared monthly common stock distributions through June 30, 2020. While no decision has yet been made with regard to the Company’s common stock distributions for July, August and September, we believe that the Company’s Board of Directors will likely elect to reduce or suspend the Company’s distributions for those months. In light of current economic and market conditions, specifically as a result of the global crisis caused by the spread of the COVID-19 virus, we believe that no reliance should be placed on the prospect for any particular level of distribution for those months, or for any other periods."

With earning out with oxlc i think oxsq is a better buy i plan to add today
Nice run! Bought more yesterday. Hope to see a run up to 4 soon
Dividend came in at Fidelity today.
When's the next dividend?
"management is really worried about the upcoming vote. I get phone calls (got one yesterday) asking me to vote the white mgmt card and to vote per mgmt recommendations on that card. I have owned this stock for quite awhile. sold at 14 and bought back in at 10 and yes did not buy more sub 5 but that's o.k. that however, does not excuse mgmt from its poor performance overall.so go ahead Y and post all your stuff and blame it all on the people who did not buy at 5 or below. what we know is that everything was cheap during that period, and I own other BDC's where the price has recovered and are paying dividends out of earnings, not my capital; and BDC's that are making acquisitions and posting good numbers. so you can take your little timing transaction bs and stick it."
OXSQ reached a new All Time High at 7.33
0.20 cents dividend per any share held on 15th March? Money on the street...
