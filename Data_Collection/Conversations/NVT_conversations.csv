"NVT - PNR just announced its upcoming divided. You can't simply do nothing. PNR cut its dividend from .35 to .175. Again, you can't just be quiet and say nothing one way or another. Lots of people own your stock and they are wondering what will happen to the dividend (PNR to PNR and NVT) - is there going to be one? If it is less than .1/share for NVT - there will be a riot."

"PNR Just cut its dividend from .35 to .175. What will NVT do? Where did the $3.1 B go that that PNR got last fall? What a JOKE. Does anyone think that NVT will have a Dividend at all? I just got killed by this spin off. I live off the Dividends. Randy - why did you not take the DEAL to sell NVT. It would have been far better than this mess and waste. Again, what a JOKE! Randy everything you touched turned to dung - Transrack, Web, Enclosures East, Enclosures West - should I go on. Tyco etc. Next time I see you, be prepared. I am not going to be silent just because were around family."

"Look for nVent to be acquired in the next 6 months. They make too much money for someone not to want them. Rockwell, ABB, ITW, Schneider, LaGrand and others are researching soon will make bids to buy. Stock will soar to $50 or so in the bididng. nVent is too small to stay by itself and this is a great payoff for all. Buy now and sell in 6 months."
