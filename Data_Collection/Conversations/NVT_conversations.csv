"Look for nVent to be acquired in the next 6 months. They make too much money for someone not to want them. Rockwell, ABB, ITW, Schneider, LaGrand and others are researching soon will make bids to buy. Stock will soar to $50 or so in the bididng. nVent is too small to stay by itself and this is a great payoff for all. Buy now and sell in 6 months."

"In my opinion, this is all Nelson Peltz and the Trian hedge funds fault. These 2 companies(PNR,NVT) are poison!!! Stay away, if you know what is good for you. Just look at GE and Proctor and Gamble!!! Correct me if I am wrong."
"NVT - PNR just announced its upcoming divided. You can't simply do nothing. PNR cut its dividend from .35 to .175. Again, you can't just be quiet and say nothing one way or another. Lots of people own your stock and they are wondering what will happen to the dividend (PNR to PNR and NVT) - is there going to be one? If it is less than .1/share for NVT - there will be a riot."
