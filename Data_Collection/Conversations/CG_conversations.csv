I was looking at going long with a small purchase of 500 to 1000 shares and then I noticed they paid a dividend of only 0.19 on 5/10. I see no news on why or if they cut it or this was reported incorrectly?
Hopefully we’ll see big earnings in the morning!
"carlyle is firing on all cylinders, it has made some great sales and purchases and the pps is moving north to where it belongs."
"I had sold all my options today, make a good return. Wait for a pull back (how much ??) to get back in, 11 days up in a row, watch below $54 is a buy, under $53 is a good buy, good ceo, lots room to go, if I have stocks that be a hold, Bye."

Fantastic buy today #1 rated Zacks One to own for future
"Lok at the chart, it is a buy zone, trade buy now and sell 3 to 4 week later OR hold."
I owned FLY stock. What happened to it after CG bought FLY
"Could a sleeping giant be wakening??? Both KKR and BX are out ahead, but I think CG willCatch up in the next year or so."
A 33 cent divy announced for Feb. nice!
"@Mark- hard to buy when it’s cheap, hard to sell when it’s expensive. Simple due diligence would have let you know that the distribution is a function of “distributable earnings”, which, by definition are variable. When the “tariff stuff” clears, the price will be higher...."
well that 1.24 div a share for the year 2018. based on nav of 20.5 that about 6 percent. I would like to see it where it's target price of 27 and change.
120 million invested in the nordam group aerospace co. to get them up and running out of bankruptcy. Looks like a good investment.
"May I suggest longs take a look at $CG. There may be, though still a long shot, some merit to the rumor as these guys do specialized in LBO's - management led and that is the only buyout scenario that seemed feasible given the $13 billion in debt. Could happen..."
"Hi, cg is in over bought area, watch for small pull back or sideway, next week earning is the key, but it may be profit taking, but back in April it last 3-4 weeks, in June it last 2-3 weeks, now it had been 1 week, watch closely, I had options, sell the near term option, might hold the longer term, or sell ALL, (depend how is cg trading?) Watch my post up to last month, let us know if any news. Bye."
I like what I see I'm back in cg
"well cg declared only a 2 percent loss bc of the turmoil in december, but made record breaking dollars on fee charges, so we are better then blackrock, and us common share holders get 43 cent dividend. A bright 2019 pic has been painted go cg."

Solid earnings report. I would expect a steady move up over the course of the year. Best to all...
"David Rubenstein should spend less time on TV, having fun, and more time trying to add value to his L.P. (I guess ""Limited Partnership"" means he makes $millions, while I lose $thousands -- actually, I guess that's an ""unLimited Partnership""). I'd question his I.Q., but he's gotten the better deal, so it's my own I.Q. in question..."
"At Ameritrade it says earnings for 2018 will be 1.96, but earnings for 2019 will be 2.94 ?Is that even remotely possible? That would give it a forward PE of about 5.3."
Should be a high flying stock invested in all the rights sectors
This thing has been heading south since I bought on November 5th. I keep thinking it's going to turn the corner but I'm not sure why it keeps tanking without a real reason. Merrill lowered its price objective from $26 to $25 recently but that's a long way from where we're at. I've also owned BX for a long time. The dividends are nice and there are some of the smartest folks in the industry working at these firms - one reason I like them. They may be out of favor right now but I'm staying the course. I'm also thinking of parking some money in KKR's preferred A series. A month ago it was around $26.25 but it's come in now to around $25.50 and yielding over 6-1/2%. Anyone here get involved in preferreds?

"Other reasons behind the current move could just be fundamentals.This outfits quarterly books are pinned to mark-to-market valuation.Look at markets on 12/31/18 and the V shaped recovery from the year end sell off. I, myself, am expecting a home run 1Q report."
Zacks is a joke I like the stock but Zack’s basically writes the same story on many stocks they just change the name.!anyway what happened we were over $51 and here we are.
"carlyle has moved steadily in the right direction, waiting for feb ex div day to really come through with better then expected results. especially for us shareholders."
"great carlyle buying in on Baidu financial arm, solid investment with tpg."
"e Kyrgyz Republic, via Kyrgyzaltyn JSC, is Centerra Gold's largest shareholder owning77,401,766 common shares. As of March 12, 2021, Kyrgyzstan's interests were estimated at $ 772million. .... today worth 530 million ... it is in the governments best interest I think to not play these games .... $CG #GOLD Great dd from the Godzilla thanks man@!!"
The market doesn’t like CG today. Powell not taking care of his old firm?
"BX could be better, but CG is hunger, watch out."
"How can Carlyle founder David Rubenstein be a billionaire while CG has lost almost 50% of my 7 yr. old stake, including dividends?? I should have backed a different billionaire! Sheesh."
CG reached a new All Time High at 24.80
"if carlyle earns 3 times the amount this quarter of 2017 then they earn back in 2016 quater, how come we r not getting 3 times the dividend which was .16 for 2/16/17 date I want .48 a share not .33"
Patience is called for with CG. I am quite hopeful the new CEO will come thru for us with flying colors in the next couple of quarters.
"Hi, this is up 8 days in a row, last time it happen in Feb. , I had options, watch closely."
