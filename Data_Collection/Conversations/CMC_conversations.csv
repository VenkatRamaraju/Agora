CMC has been paying the same $0.12/share quarterly dividend since January'08.13.5 years without a dividend hike?Isn't it time for a raise?
Zack is back on $CEI &CWSFF / $CMC.V 
With rebar shortages and steel margins improving Biden’s infrastructure money will be the catalysts to push CMC into the $30s in 2021.
This will be $45 by the end of the year
"Out CMC at $23.00 for a VERY nice profit on 3600 shares. Of course the gain was even nicer earlier in the day, but I was not at my computer and had to rely on a Stop Sell to protect my profit. Still a very successful play, we must Celebrate Every Victory! Currently Long 1400 shares of LEN at $58.07. Another Pure Earnings play, gotta wait until Wednesday morning on this Baby, to see what happens. :-) So hard to figure out when to cash out on an earnings play, especially when you have a full-time job that doesn't allow you to carefully monitor the action. Oh well, we do the best we can. I hope those who played her managed to get out with decent Green. :-)"
I was looking at this stock when it was at $20 just 2 months ago. Wish I would’ve bought it. Congrats to those who did.
$CMC.V $CWSFF $CEI and $PROG 
Buy any dips play the game by April CMC will be in the $30s ... WE KNOW
sell #CEI and buy #CWSFF #CMC.VCielo Waste Solutions Corp. (CMC.V)have huge demand and can go easy 10 dollar.
The vaccine news this morning will rally the market it’s amazing how the news cycle work in regards to market psychology. CMC should regain its move to $40 now in 2021.
"Outlook""We expect construction and infrastructure activity to remain resilient during our fiscal fourth quarter,"" said Ms. Smith. ""Our finished product volumes are supported by strong fabrication backlogs, which stood near record-high levels at May 31. Customers' sentiment about their own summer construction workloads is also encouraging. CMC's net debt-to- EBITDA ratio of 1.2x and substantial cash and equivalents on hand give us great confidence in our ability to withstand these challenging times, and provide us with significant flexibility in our capital allocation decisions."""
^^^CMC got 300M for Cucamunga
Every time I read the analyst on CMC I need a drink because this company is firing on all cylinders and has a sweet dividend which could be raised in 2021.
$CMC I want you to come down at 40cents or 30 cents so I can buy more shares 
"No one is selling they raised the estimates so many times they had to miss.

We all know how wrong the little girl at BOFA has been. Sometimes it’s best to say nothing. https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2021/05/06/investing/steel-shortage-stocks-bubble/index.html

sold Digital World Acquisition Corp. (DWAC)and buying #CWSFF #CMC.Vnext to run soon..............
"Long 3600 shares of CMC at $22.27. Bought these shares just before the close today. This is a Pure Earnings play. CMC reports Monday morning, pre-market. I am expecting a very good earnings report, beats on EPS and Revenue, along with positive forward Guidance, to lift this Baby up to around the $24.00 level. Company is currently undervalued, and I see numerous catalysts that should result in this moving up on Monday. Always do your own Due Diligence on every stock trade, folks. I am WRONG quite often, and the Pure Earnings game is very dangerous. I understand and accept the big risks I am choosing to take, and I do NOT recommend that others do as I do. :-)"
This is a good time to buy more. The future of $CMC.CN is bright.

"With all due respect, Harvey, the current national debt has ballooned and exceeded $22 trillion in early 2019. Both parties will be reluctant to push through another huge spending bill. In the event of a downturn/ recession, CMC could be in serious trouble with their narrow focus on recycling and rebar. Diversification used to be the long-term strategy but short term profits seem to prevail with the new era of upper management of CMC. Compare CMC's current stock price to that of competitor Nucor Steel, which last closed at $57.79 and posted earnings of $7.42 per share. CMC's share price has struggled in the most robust period in the steel industry in the modern era."
"I am currently researching CMC as a potential pre-earnings and pure-earnings play to the Long side. This company is undervalued, has numerous positive catalysts going forward, and lots of potential upside over the next two weeks, with limited downside risk, IMO. They report earnings on January 6, still quite a few days away, but I see the potential for a price rally going into the release, and then more of a pop to the upside immediately after the release. I expect a very good earnings report, better than consensus estimates. This baby could go to $24+ before earnings release, and then easily break above $25 upon the release. Very seriously thinking of going Long with a big chunk of capital sometime next week, perhaps on Tuesday."
Where should i buy for short term and long term?
"Commercial Metals (NYSE:CMC): FQ3 Non-GAAP EPS of $1.04 beats by $0.20; GAAP EPS of $1.07 beats by $0.27.Revenue of $1.84B (+37.3% Y/Y) beats by $100M.Shipment volumes of finished steel, which include steel products and downstream products, increased by 9% from the prior year third quarter.Outlook: ""Strong demand across multiple end-use markets should support robust shipment levels of finished steel during the fourth quarter in both North America and Europe. Construction activity is strong and the industrial sectors are growing in both the U.S. and Central Europe, as both regions continue to recover from the pandemic. We expect margins over scrap on steel products in North America and Europe to be relatively flat or up modestly from third quarter levels."""
So last night in the dark of night the Infrastructure bill was split from the 3.5 trillion social program to be voted on by the house today. On top of that CMC sells Rancho Cucamonga for 300 million to add to the cash they already have. Sure looks like the dividend increase could happen in 2022.
US STEEL UP BIG THIS MORNING... This board is a mess with other stocks not CMC
"Deutsche Bank Adjusts Commercial Metals Company PT to $36 From $32, Maintains Hold RatingMT NEWSWIRES 9:55 AM ET 9/15/2021Its really time CMC increased the dividend they have the cash and the pipeline looks extremely promising with infrastructure spending coming in the billions."
"It appears Raphael typed ""weekend"" in $CMC on ceo.ca chat. Go check yourself..... is that the new cryptic way of letting us know something is coming this weekend? Maybe renewable u has good news?"
Metal prices were ticking up last week this downward action is only due to the fall seasonally in trading and the Jewish holidays. Nothing has changed and the weakness expected in Q3 is already a non factor in this market. If this dips under $30 I will add aggressively.
shares went up during earnings 10/14/2021
"ngl I got outta this at the right time lol all my other stonks are green, LFG! $CMC $AMC $BTCM $PROG many more lfh daddy, order flow is too bearish on GME on webull"
"This stock while not flashy, will steady your portfolio's performance in an upward direction over the long term"
In case you are out of the loop BOFA was tapped by Blackrock to downgrade CMC so they could add to the 11% position they already hold in CMC. Play the game and add anytime under $20 the balance sheet are strong along with a sweet dividend you could see get a bump up in 2021. Less money for infrastructure is a false narrative being floated by the media for the players . WE KNOW
Goldman must want to add under $30 today play the game with them. They are adding to their book. WE KNOW
