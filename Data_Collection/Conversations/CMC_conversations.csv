So last night in the dark of night the Infrastructure bill was split from the 3.5 trillion social program to be voted on by the house today. On top of that CMC sells Rancho Cucamonga for 300 million to add to the cash they already have. Sure looks like the dividend increase could happen in 2022.

Sell $CEI and buy $CMC.V $CWSFF
$CMC.V $CWSFF & $CEI would make millionaire in three months
Metal prices were ticking up last week this downward action is only due to the fall seasonally in trading and the Jewish holidays. Nothing has changed and the weakness expected in Q3 is already a non factor in this market. If this dips under $30 I will add aggressively.
"Based on current prices, CMC buyback will result in 9.3% of the outstanding shares"
