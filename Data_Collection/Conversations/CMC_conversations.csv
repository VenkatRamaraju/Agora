"Long 3600 shares of CMC at $22.27. Bought these shares just before the close today. This is a Pure Earnings play. CMC reports Monday morning, pre-market. I am expecting a very good earnings report, beats on EPS and Revenue, along with positive forward Guidance, to lift this Baby up to around the $24.00 level. Company is currently undervalued, and I see numerous catalysts that should result in this moving up on Monday. Always do your own Due Diligence on every stock trade, folks. I am WRONG quite often, and the Pure Earnings game is very dangerous. I understand and accept the big risks I am choosing to take, and I do NOT recommend that others do as I do. :-)"
Not gonna be a very Merry Christmas for many CMC employees. First in. First out. I wish them and their families the very best of luck.

Nice drop today and chance to buy in cheap. This will be back up to $35!
CMC ready to $20 next week or so!
CMC corporate leadership is #$%$. I've watched them slowly destroy this once great company. Barbara Smith will put the final few nails in the coffin. So long to all the structural fabrication folks that just got dumped. Hope a better deal comes along for you all.
Clearly CMC is heading to new highs this summer. I see nothing to stop it. Inflation talk is nonsense to slow this recovery it is a market never seen before.https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/steel-and-lumber-prices-are-sky-high-lifting-trumps-tariffs-could-help/ar-AAKB95u?ocid=BingNewsSearch
Between CMC and OLN this week I might take Friday off.Cheers
CMC's raw material input costs are a concern - up over $200-$250/ton currently vs a year ago. Their margins are going to be pressured if they can't give their SP up or else their volume better increase dramatically.
CMC is up 7.66% to 12.37
Up nice tonight after hours new 52 week high tomm. Sleep tight #$%$
"update, dealer baling scrap price is now $4.50 per 100lb. And the infrastructure plan isn't in place yet. Was $3.50 in October, demand is increasing."
Every time I read the analyst on CMC I need a drink because this company is firing on all cylinders and has a sweet dividend which could be raised in 2021.
Wow I screwed up and should have sold sooner
This will be $45 by the end of the year
If the only concern is a storm the analysts really have nothing to pick at. I found that very amusing. Anyone with a brain knows huge money will flow into infrastructure soon as well as into the home building sectors growth in Red states as people flee Blue states. I was looking for a dividend bump that was my only disappointment today they have some serious cash laying around.
Commercial Metals is up 5.53% to 22.34
I wouldn’t count President Trump out yet plus Biden will go big with a infrastructure bill. The gobbler will need money for Republican States who need construction jobs he will play ball
"update, dealer baling scrap price is now $5.50 per 100lb, (was $4.50 in January) And the infrastructure plan still isn't in place. Was $3.50 in October, demand is rapidly increasing."
"It is my sense that a reduction in steel tariffs from Turkey down to 25% from 50% is the source of weakness in CMC today, 5/17.Turkey does dump steel, so the situation bears watching, and there was probably an analyst downgrade somewhere, but I'm a buyer under $15.50 as a likely coming infrastructure bill next year will direct that only US rebar should be bought."

Let the games begin buying opportunity if you are not already in under $20. Infrastructure is the play.

"I am currently researching CMC as a potential pre-earnings and pure-earnings play to the Long side. This company is undervalued, has numerous positive catalysts going forward, and lots of potential upside over the next two weeks, with limited downside risk, IMO. They report earnings on January 6, still quite a few days away, but I see the potential for a price rally going into the release, and then more of a pop to the upside immediately after the release. I expect a very good earnings report, better than consensus estimates. This baby could go to $24+ before earnings release, and then easily break above $25 upon the release. Very seriously thinking of going Long with a big chunk of capital sometime next week, perhaps on Tuesday."
"Out CMC at $23.00 for a VERY nice profit on 3600 shares. Of course the gain was even nicer earlier in the day, but I was not at my computer and had to rely on a Stop Sell to protect my profit. Still a very successful play, we must Celebrate Every Victory! Currently Long 1400 shares of LEN at $58.07. Another Pure Earnings play, gotta wait until Wednesday morning on this Baby, to see what happens. :-) So hard to figure out when to cash out on an earnings play, especially when you have a full-time job that doesn't allow you to carefully monitor the action. Oh well, we do the best we can. I hope those who played her managed to get out with decent Green. :-)"

"IIIN: Does Insteel's big earnings miss and poor guidance resonate for CMC? Data points: 1.IIIN is more narroiwly focused. 2. IIIN has 10% of CMC's revenues. 3. IIIN is a small cap with only one analyst providing coverage. 4. IIIN is flexible as it has no debt. 5. Tariffs have increased the cost of raw materials, namely wire rod while competitive downstream products are exempted, exacerbating the squeeze on IIIN. Will Trump help alleviate this problem? Any other thoughts?"

"In case you didn't notice, China will be hosting the 2022 Winter Olympics. They are all about making a big impression on the world stage and will be building more infrastructure. 2008 baling scrap metal was over $10 per 100 lbs. It was under $3 just a few months ago, it is approaching $6 now. If you recognize history repeating itself, buy metal processing companies now and hold until about 2 months prior to the 2022 Winter Olympics."
Guys i need your honest opinion. For a possible 10x bagger shoul i stick to the more well-known companies like $CMC.CN and $CBDT.CN or rather less known with much lower daily volume but much cheaper options like EL.V or WATR.V or even DM.V. Imean you would go for higher volume optiobs or lower price ones? Unfortunately my funding situation does not allow me to be in all so i need to go into the one with highest success rate possiblity. Thanks!

"With such a good balance sheet and earnings, they distribute a low dividend in my opinion."
cmc is still earning positive and expected to remain such unlike some outher steel producing corp that seem to be running up to unjustified share prices. i guess turning scrap cars etc into new steel is not as glamorous as turning iron ore into new steel.

"Commercial Metals (NYSE:CMC): FQ3 Non-GAAP EPS of $1.04 beats by $0.20; GAAP EPS of $1.07 beats by $0.27.Revenue of $1.84B (+37.3% Y/Y) beats by $100M.Shipment volumes of finished steel, which include steel products and downstream products, increased by 9% from the prior year third quarter.Outlook: ""Strong demand across multiple end-use markets should support robust shipment levels of finished steel during the fourth quarter in both North America and Europe. Construction activity is strong and the industrial sectors are growing in both the U.S. and Central Europe, as both regions continue to recover from the pandemic. We expect margins over scrap on steel products in North America and Europe to be relatively flat or up modestly from third quarter levels."""

Smart money is positioning itself into infrastructure plays and this has to be one of them. Republicans and Democrats are on a spending frenzy our crumbing cities infrastructure is next to get Americans back to work..MAGA 2020
Wouldn’t this benefit either way? If Trump is re-elected or if Biden is elected? Trump will push fiscal spending as will the democrats. Either way infrastructure work like roads and bridges will be supported by both sides?

It’s all good during difficult times good job Mrs Smith
"Outlook""We expect construction and infrastructure activity to remain resilient during our fiscal fourth quarter,"" said Ms. Smith. ""Our finished product volumes are supported by strong fabrication backlogs, which stood near record-high levels at May 31. Customers' sentiment about their own summer construction workloads is also encouraging. CMC's net debt-to- EBITDA ratio of 1.2x and substantial cash and equivalents on hand give us great confidence in our ability to withstand these challenging times, and provide us with significant flexibility in our capital allocation decisions."""
Metal prices were ticking up last week this downward action is only due to the fall seasonally in trading and the Jewish holidays. Nothing has changed and the weakness expected in Q3 is already a non factor in this market. If this dips under $30 I will add aggressively.

"With all due respect, Harvey, the current national debt has ballooned and exceeded $22 trillion in early 2019. Both parties will be reluctant to push through another huge spending bill. In the event of a downturn/ recession, CMC could be in serious trouble with their narrow focus on recycling and rebar. Diversification used to be the long-term strategy but short term profits seem to prevail with the new era of upper management of CMC. Compare CMC's current stock price to that of competitor Nucor Steel, which last closed at $57.79 and posted earnings of $7.42 per share. CMC's share price has struggled in the most robust period in the steel industry in the modern era."
