Looking good for a nice run to the mid $30s
"Lol profits double, algos keep selling. Good job, market"
We all know how wrong the little girl at BOFA has been. Sometimes it’s best to say nothing. https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2021/05/06/investing/steel-shortage-stocks-bubble/index.html
You know how much rebar this is a lot ..https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/economy/reports/2020/06/29/487075/getting-americans-back-work-good-jobs/
"Based on current prices, CMC buyback will result in 9.3% of the outstanding shares"
Are you doing to stare at this on its way to $30. WE KNOW
Nice base forming just under $20. This is a stock to own before the infrastructure deal is made. In other news bidding for projects around NYC are heating up the building will never stop because of Cov.
sold Digital World Acquisition Corp. (DWAC)and buying #CWSFF #CMC.Vnext to run soon..............
In case you are out of the loop BOFA was tapped by Blackrock to downgrade CMC so they could add to the 11% position they already hold in CMC. Play the game and add anytime under $20 the balance sheet are strong along with a sweet dividend you could see get a bump up in 2021. Less money for infrastructure is a false narrative being floated by the media for the players . WE KNOW
This will be $45 by the end of the year
"Chairman, President & CEO Smith Barbara: Disposed 82,082 of Common Stock at average price $22.87 on Jan 6!Not a good sign.... Also how is it legal for CEO to dispose stock 5 days before the Q report?"
Infrastructure coming and so is $35
This will continue to be a core holding of mine as money flows into rebar and cement without much notice. The dividen is even sweeter during these market ups and downs. I must say the intelligence on this board is miniscule except for a few but thats Yahoo.https://www.enr.com/articles/50024-states-receive-48b-in-bonus-federal-fy20-highway-funds https://www.enr.com/articles/50024-states-receive-48b-in-bonus-federal-fy20-highway-funds
Between CMC and OLN this week I might take Friday off.Cheers
Generated free cash flow of $209 million.
CMC has been paying the same $0.12/share quarterly dividend since January'08.13.5 years without a dividend hike?Isn't it time for a raise?
Where should i buy for short term and long term?
The $30s is coming margins are improving and so is a dividend increase in 2021.We Know
Guys i need your honest opinion. For a possible 10x bagger shoul i stick to the more well-known companies like $CMC.CN and $CBDT.CN or rather less known with much lower daily volume but much cheaper options like EL.V or WATR.V or even DM.V. Imean you would go for higher volume optiobs or lower price ones? Unfortunately my funding situation does not allow me to be in all so i need to go into the one with highest success rate possiblity. Thanks!
"Nice dividend check. Also, nice to see the share price move up the last few days."
Huge chip factory in AZ lots of material will be ordered from CMC the first of 4 factories we know about. $50 dollar stock in 2022
"Out CMC at $23.00 for a VERY nice profit on 3600 shares. Of course the gain was even nicer earlier in the day, but I was not at my computer and had to rely on a Stop Sell to protect my profit. Still a very successful play, we must Celebrate Every Victory! Currently Long 1400 shares of LEN at $58.07. Another Pure Earnings play, gotta wait until Wednesday morning on this Baby, to see what happens. :-) So hard to figure out when to cash out on an earnings play, especially when you have a full-time job that doesn't allow you to carefully monitor the action. Oh well, we do the best we can. I hope those who played her managed to get out with decent Green. :-)"
Buy any dips play the game by April CMC will be in the $30s ... WE KNOW
$CWSFF $CMC.V & $CEI would be huge huge up very soon 
Thank you charles this is jim from nioYou are 3 for 3 Nio lw cmcYou are the man!
"Credit Suisse is the one made a good call on 4-2-19 , that CMC is their Top pick in steel stocks with PT $27."
Wait till they drop the bomb of a dividend increase in 2021.$35 incoming
Goldman must want to add under $30 today play the game with them. They are adding to their book. WE KNOW
Undervalued stock with low P/E and greater demand for steel and other metals will benefit CMC
4quater has a strong backlog I will be adding if this gets stupid. MM working pre market for affect whatever. The virus is old news.
"In case you didn't notice, China will be hosting the 2022 Winter Olympics. They are all about making a big impression on the world stage and will be building more infrastructure. 2008 baling scrap metal was over $10 per 100 lbs. It was under $3 just a few months ago, it is approaching $6 now. If you recognize history repeating itself, buy metal processing companies now and hold until about 2 months prior to the 2022 Winter Olympics."
"Deutsche Bank Adjusts Commercial Metals Company PT to $36 From $32, Maintains Hold RatingMT NEWSWIRES 9:55 AM ET 9/15/2021Its really time CMC increased the dividend they have the cash and the pipeline looks extremely promising with infrastructure spending coming in the billions."
Metal prices were ticking up last week this downward action is only due to the fall seasonally in trading and the Jewish holidays. Nothing has changed and the weakness expected in Q3 is already a non factor in this market. If this dips under $30 I will add aggressively.
Cielo Waste Solutions Corp. $CMC $CMC.V $CWSFF is poised to produce comparable volume of renewable diesel as Gevo Inc $GEVO.Q at 1/8 the capital costs.
sell #CEI and buy #CWSFF #CMC.VCielo Waste Solutions Corp. (CMC.V)have huge demand and can go easy 10 dollar.
"Baling scrap just crossed $6 at my favorite recycling hole. We've swooned a bit, but infrastructure plan isn't in place yet, may make the haul this w/e. Looking for at least $28/share by summer."
"In this low interest rate environment, CMC is one of good stock to be invested in.Today CMC's ER is pretty solid, looking for $25 target!"
After looking through everything this should be selling at around 27.50
If they raise the dividend and record infrastructure spending starts this could go to $40.
Where’s this stock going after the ER?
Nice stable recovery from under $20. I expect a 52 week high when we see some volume before 2021. Lots of weak hands are waiting for more clarity on the Presidential outcome but Red or Blue this will be green.
Nice day to add under $20. Bidding for large infrastructure projects in NYC are at record high = WE KNOW
This coming CC should really excite the whale money and continue the rise.https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/13/economy/infrastructure-spending-biden-trump/index.html
This is a good time to buy more. The future of $CMC.CN is bright.
Under $20 I have been adding in 2020. Use your brain infrastructure spending is coming and a Trump win means even bigger gains.
CMC's raw material input costs are a concern - up over $200-$250/ton currently vs a year ago. Their margins are going to be pressured if they can't give their SP up or else their volume better increase dramatically.
selling #DWAC and buying #CMC.V #CWSFF.next to run.... buy now pray for me later....huge upside coming next week....
"It appears Raphael typed ""weekend"" in $CMC on ceo.ca chat. Go check yourself..... is that the new cryptic way of letting us know something is coming this weekend? Maybe renewable u has good news?"
good time to buy steel stocks? Seems it did nothing for last few months....
Markets gonna rip higher soon load up under $30 . We Know
Can $35 be far away after this ?https://www.barrons.com/articles/buy-u-s-steel-stock-because-this-market-cycle-will-be-stronger-for-longer-51620753982
i note analysts have bumped up earning est for this coming quarter and at same time dropped est for the following quarter all this following better than expected earnings for just reported quarter
Every time I read the analyst on CMC I need a drink because this company is firing on all cylinders and has a sweet dividend which could be raised in 2021.
"Buy below $15 and hold for the long term. You will have a solid performer in your portfolio, the kind Buffet finds."
"Commercial Metals (NYSE:CMC): FQ3 Non-GAAP EPS of $1.04 beats by $0.20; GAAP EPS of $1.07 beats by $0.27.Revenue of $1.84B (+37.3% Y/Y) beats by $100M.Shipment volumes of finished steel, which include steel products and downstream products, increased by 9% from the prior year third quarter.Outlook: ""Strong demand across multiple end-use markets should support robust shipment levels of finished steel during the fourth quarter in both North America and Europe. Construction activity is strong and the industrial sectors are growing in both the U.S. and Central Europe, as both regions continue to recover from the pandemic. We expect margins over scrap on steel products in North America and Europe to be relatively flat or up modestly from third quarter levels."""
"ngl I got outta this at the right time lol all my other stonks are green, LFG! $CMC $AMC $BTCM $PROG many more lfh daddy, order flow is too bearish on GME on webull"
cmc is still earning positive and expected to remain such unlike some outher steel producing corp that seem to be running up to unjustified share prices. i guess turning scrap cars etc into new steel is not as glamorous as turning iron ore into new steel.
Time to add lots of orders coming in building is strong in the Midwest
"update, dealer baling scrap price is now $5.50 per 100lb, (was $4.50 in January) And the infrastructure plan still isn't in place. Was $3.50 in October, demand is rapidly increasing."
"With all due respect, Harvey, the current national debt has ballooned and exceeded $22 trillion in early 2019. Both parties will be reluctant to push through another huge spending bill. In the event of a downturn/ recession, CMC could be in serious trouble with their narrow focus on recycling and rebar. Diversification used to be the long-term strategy but short term profits seem to prevail with the new era of upper management of CMC. Compare CMC's current stock price to that of competitor Nucor Steel, which last closed at $57.79 and posted earnings of $7.42 per share. CMC's share price has struggled in the most robust period in the steel industry in the modern era."
"I am currently researching CMC as a potential pre-earnings and pure-earnings play to the Long side. This company is undervalued, has numerous positive catalysts going forward, and lots of potential upside over the next two weeks, with limited downside risk, IMO. They report earnings on January 6, still quite a few days away, but I see the potential for a price rally going into the release, and then more of a pop to the upside immediately after the release. I expect a very good earnings report, better than consensus estimates. This baby could go to $24+ before earnings release, and then easily break above $25 upon the release. Very seriously thinking of going Long with a big chunk of capital sometime next week, perhaps on Tuesday."
What an awesome price to start another position with this sweet dividend
"This short play is not working out at all, there is pressure to the upside. Buy in now and expect shorts to get squeezed into the next earnings report. I love this setup."
$CEI $CWSFF $CMC.V
"It is my sense that a reduction in steel tariffs from Turkey down to 25% from 50% is the source of weakness in CMC today, 5/17.Turkey does dump steel, so the situation bears watching, and there was probably an analyst downgrade somewhere, but I'm a buyer under $15.50 as a likely coming infrastructure bill next year will direct that only US rebar should be bought."
^^^CMC got 300M for Cucamunga
If the only concern is a storm the analysts really have nothing to pick at. I found that very amusing. Anyone with a brain knows huge money will flow into infrastructure soon as well as into the home building sectors growth in Red states as people flee Blue states. I was looking for a dividend bump that was my only disappointment today they have some serious cash laying around.
Commercial Metals Company (CMC)Annual Report Available From SEC on 10-Khttps://sec.report/Document/0000022444-19-000045/
"Long 3600 shares of CMC at $22.27. Bought these shares just before the close today. This is a Pure Earnings play. CMC reports Monday morning, pre-market. I am expecting a very good earnings report, beats on EPS and Revenue, along with positive forward Guidance, to lift this Baby up to around the $24.00 level. Company is currently undervalued, and I see numerous catalysts that should result in this moving up on Monday. Always do your own Due Diligence on every stock trade, folks. I am WRONG quite often, and the Pure Earnings game is very dangerous. I understand and accept the big risks I am choosing to take, and I do NOT recommend that others do as I do. :-)"

"bought in a little late, but will hold for the foreseeable future. nice dividend, solid fundamentals. better than LK."
I have no intention of selling my shares until President Trump leaves office in 2024. Lots and Lots of building is coming.
With rebar shortages and steel margins improving Biden’s infrastructure money will be the catalysts to push CMC into the $30s in 2021.
CMC hasn't raised its dividend in almost 13 YEARS!!Isn't it time?
Zack is back on $CEI &CWSFF / $CMC.V

Commercial Metals Company (CMC)2019 Annual Report Available From 10-Khttps://sec.report/Document/0000022444-19-000042/
I was looking at this stock when it was at $20 just 2 months ago. Wish I would’ve bought it. Congrats to those who did.
CMC is up 4.97% to 25.76
Headed for $36
IN CASE YOU ARE WONDERING WHY https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/500959-house-dems-roll-out-500b-green-transportation-infrastructure-bill
CMC hasn't raised its dividend in over 13 YEARS!!Isn't it time?
Clearly CMC is heading to new highs this summer. I see nothing to stop it. Inflation talk is nonsense to slow this recovery it is a market never seen before.https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/steel-and-lumber-prices-are-sky-high-lifting-trumps-tariffs-could-help/ar-AAKB95u?ocid=BingNewsSearch
I don't think Deutsche Bank analyst taking into consideration of that our aging airport & crumbling infrastructure need a lot of rebar. The only problem is that the congress & the president can't even get together to pass a bill to rebuild America. The bill most likely will Buy America clause to fix the infrastructure problem
somebody from BloomBurg reporting on this gave it a $8 price target & said he's not selling. I mean if you listen in to the bloomburg talks on $CMC.V there saying facts & there bullish
Looks like Market Watch printed the wrong dividend news. And they did not correct it.
$CMC I want you to come down at 40cents or 30 cents so I can buy more shares 
shares went up during earnings 10/14/2021
Why would you invest in CMC which has a Forward PE Ratio of 9.4 for the year 2021 (among the highest of USA steel manufacturers) when X is available at 2.3?
"If we get an Infrastructure spending bill, the next step after tax cuts and regulatory reform, CMC will be a major benmeficiary as it is the #1 US rebar companywith 60%+ market share. Added to the fact that it is a small cap there will be a rush to get in. With a 2019 p/e under 8 and a well covered dividend yield of 3.1% its in the bargain bin. Feras of a worldwide economic slowdown appear to be the current drag."
Smart money is positioning itself into infrastructure plays and this has to be one of them. Republicans and Democrats are on a spending frenzy our crumbing cities infrastructure is next to get Americans back to work..MAGA 2020
What the .. is happening? Correction?
"Let your winners ride Investors turn away from tech, and embraced cyclicals and this moved we could be heading for a 52 week high"
So last night in the dark of night the Infrastructure bill was split from the 3.5 trillion social program to be voted on by the house today. On top of that CMC sells Rancho Cucamonga for 300 million to add to the cash they already have. Sure looks like the dividend increase could happen in 2022.
I love you Ms Smith leader of the best management team in this sector
Trump win good for infrastructure Biden win better for infrastructure Remember who the transportation secretary is married to
We now have 1 institutional holder of $CMC.CN

"This stock while not flashy, will steady your portfolio's performance in an upward direction over the long term"
I am using this dip to buy after a 1 Star rated analyst downgraded to Neutral from Outperform. The analyst Seth Rosenfeld downgraded Commercial Metals to Neutral from Outperform with a $21 price target. This guy is clueless and not very good
This is the time to buy.At least 10% more to $33-34
I hope $34-35At least $32Don't sell my brothers.
When this starts trading over $25 this month the analysts will raise the price targets
Nice drop today and chance to buy in cheap. This will be back up to $35!
"As a medium to long term play, there's at least a 50% gain from here (~$15 on 4/15/20). Vertically integrated company from scrap to melting to rolling to fabricating to installing, and so much more. Perhaps America's numero uno for rebar? Any infrastructure projects or bills are just icing on a long term cake....there may yet be some additional dips, but it's only temporary..... keep rolling on steelmaker hombres...."

Is there anybody out there . Good Luck
"Outlook""We expect construction and infrastructure activity to remain resilient during our fiscal fourth quarter,"" said Ms. Smith. ""Our finished product volumes are supported by strong fabrication backlogs, which stood near record-high levels at May 31. Customers' sentiment about their own summer construction workloads is also encouraging. CMC's net debt-to- EBITDA ratio of 1.2x and substantial cash and equivalents on hand give us great confidence in our ability to withstand these challenging times, and provide us with significant flexibility in our capital allocation decisions."""
"A strong company, slightly undervalued, healthy balance sheet, and a great long position."
Tonight Orange man will light up the infrastructure sector in the debate. Sleepy Joe might even chime in if he remembers his briefings .
The vaccine news this morning will rally the market it’s amazing how the news cycle work in regards to market psychology. CMC should regain its move to $40 now in 2021.
Almost time to add watching very closely noting has changed .
It’s all good during difficult times good job Mrs Smith
