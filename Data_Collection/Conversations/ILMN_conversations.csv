Will ILMN make a move on BNGO by the end of 2021? BNGO is getting even more traction and the price of the stock is a steal.
"Abstract of EU Requlator's Initial Reaction to accelerated GRAIL acquition:""Executive Vice-President Margrethe Vestager, in charge of EU competition policy, said: • EU Stands - against ILMN's rush to complete acquition."" -Per:(https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investor-alert-investor-investigation-underway-130000001.html• Risks Cited - Pressure for Grail divestment that could beon terms worse than those of original GRAIL acquition.• Risks Not Specifically Cited: - Fines - Ability to do business in EU through partnership with another EU acceptable company resulting in diluted earnings potentialMy Comment:Clearly ILMN has cast GRAIL as Keystone to its future prosperity. I would like to explore this proposition in greater depth.Comments?HalRE: ""We deeply regret Illumina's decision to complete its acquisition of GRAIL, while our investigation into the transaction is still ongoing. Companies have to respect our competition rules and procedures. Under our ex-ante merger control regime companies must wait for our approval before a transaction can go ahead.” Illumina admitted in its SEC filing that any EU decision could “require Illumina to divest all or a portion of the assets or equity interests of GRAIL on terms that are materially worse than the terms on which Illumina acquired GRAIL, any or all of which, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on Illumina’s business, financial condition and results of operation.”"
Grail just got NY State approval for early cancer detection test...
Buying opportunity coming. Take advantage when it bottoms. This dip is short term/temporary.
"Just read good ol' Jim Jorden is going to fight the FTC, probably run by the lib's now who don't understand business or economics in general. This news could be a good boost for us today and if the FTC gets shut down, HERE WE GO!!!"
"Scared, by the time the Court decides, ILMN will be 90. at the rate it's going"
"Analysis of M. Fool Article: ""3 Things About Illumina That Smart Investors Know""By Line: ""The company is cemented as the industry leader, but a crack is showing. ... A competing technology is gaining some traction.""• Thing 1: Dominant Market Position - Since 2018-2020 instruments as a share of total sales has declined from 17% to 13%, likewise Services has declined from 18 to 16%. However, consumables has risen steadily from 65 to 71%. ☞ I note that coveted GRAIL is primarily a Consumables type supplier to the industry.• Thing 2: Genomics field is Young & Growing - with sequencing costs falling dramatically ☞ I wonder if equipment costs & margins are also poised to fall - (a More's Law sort of thing?)• Thing 3: Possible Vulnerability - ILMN's technology is Short-Read (multi-Overlapping) type sequencing, but Long-Read upstarts such as PacBio (PACB), which ILMN has already tried and failed to buy: - relates to only 10% of the overall sequencing market but - which is said to be currently growing at a 20% rate. ☞ I suspect that in the long run, a complete across the board capability in the field is most desirable economically - (a one -stop shopping thing?) MY COMMENTUsing the prospering by ""Selling the Supplies rather than Digging the Gold"" 49er Gold Rush Analogy: I suspect the profit margins on Shovels, Mules, and Baccon remained steady back then and steadly in demand, proving ultimately to be more reliable and rewarding than the digging. ☞ I note that Apple and Microsoft do relatively little of the world's actual computing themselves, but still prosper quite nicely. (In fact Apple's shovel has always been a bit easier to wield, their mule less stubborn with more horse-sense, and their Bacon more visually appealing to the palette. Just noting.)Hal"
"A Short StoryThe year is 1799 somewhere in the Europe. A talented foundry worker has an idea: A steam-powered mule to plow local fields and to haul produce to town. He gets something primative up and running. It boggs down on the soggy fields and roads. So, he abandons the idea of plowing fields. Instead he takes a lead from a local coal mine: wooden tracks and cross-ties to run on, set apart to exactly fit his tractor's wheels. He buys some land along the road into town and lays some track into town. The resulting haulage business is a hit! But a problem arrises, the local mayor becomes alarmed! What IF IF IF ... this enterprising guy won't allow other businesses to use his tracks. Even if they buy his tractor-mules, they MAY have to lay their own tracks into town. Doubt and alarm lead to lot of discouraging restrictions leading to the strangling of the whole new-fangled concept.Immediately the initial primative steam engine becomes the industry standard of what ever business lingers. Years go by without innovation before enough potential improvements accumulate to justify scrapping everything and starting over. My CommentWhy hobble a whole emerging industry by standardizing it to its first innovation to market?!Hal"
"How can any of us have any faith in ILMN share price when the CEO Frank deSouza has sold all his share from 10/2020 to 2/2021 ranging in price from $325 to $450. He has been a part of a lot of deals and he sure knows when to cash out well before all of us...leaving us as the bagholder. The legal council also did the same total selling of shares. Good luck . Don't be a bagholder. As of today, shares are now back up to $404.76. Get out while you can.https://fintel.io/n/us/ilmn/desouza-francis-a"
Down to 200 !! It will be still expensive.
"I Like it! Solid move. I would buy more except I fear grabbing a Falling-Knife. I would like to see some rational offical analyst's support and a press release from Management within the next 48 hours. I'm in it for the long run, not short term glory. I see $5,000/share eventually, while re-investing my gains along the way."
"The shareprice is going down, which is a weird situation. I think sellers do not understand that aquiring grail with or without approval is a win-win situation for Illumina. The 'fight' with FTC or EU can take a couple of years however, whatever comes out of it is OK for Illumina.When they get approval, all is ok, GRAIL will be integrated and illumina becomes a larger company.When they do not get approval, Illumina needs to sell GRAIL and by then it is worth much more than it is right now and Illumina will profit from it.There is no loser here!"
"Great day to buy ! Even if in the abstract, the EU decided to levy fines against ILMN for it resorption of GRAIL, the impact could not be enough to take 10% of the market cap of the company. This is the same company it was yesterday, one with nothing but upside. Take advantage of the dip on news (that isn't understood by the average trader) and a down day on the market and pick up your shares at a discount."
"Ok, ILMN does business all over the world right now and there is no problems or disputes, they what to buy a company they once owned that does not do business in EU. So what is all the crying about by the EU?? The company has filed suit in the General Court of the European Union, arguing there is no European jurisdiction because Grail has no active business activities there. ILMN plans to ""vigorously defend"" against any fines. looks solid ground to me Grail has no ties to the EU, end of story. I see no bases for fines!"
$sens and $ilmn are game changing medical technologies !
"ILMN/FTC: Congressional GOP Scamsters Get InvolvedConroversial Jim Jordan and Darrell Issa of ""Stop The Steal"" fame have entered the fray:• Alleging - FTC Chair Lina Khan ""was not following a normal path in its work""• Alleging - Agency actions related to the deal require congressional oversight• Demanding - surrender of ""documents related to the FTC's work""• Contending - The FTC injunction was hastily filed to allow FTC the advantage of deciding the issue in the FTC's own internal administrative court ""to avoid speedily resolving novel legal issues under U.S. law in a forum - Federal District Court - where the FTC was more likely to lose.""MY COMMENTSounds like our lawyer's have enlisted some of the best Washington politicians money can buy.Go Team!Hal"
"ILMN/GRAIL $8 Billion Acquition/Re-Spin-off >>> PROFIT !?Perhaps ILMN has plans to profit by spinning-off GRAIL anyway, no matter the anticipated Regulator ruling.Observations that have been made by some financial sharps and by the usual touts:• Publicity Factor: There's been a lot of Hoop-La, profitability speculation, and a year's worth of hi-profile speculation and industry sector growth• Increased Value: GRAIL may now be worth more than the $8 Billion ILMN agreed to pay for it a year ago• Strategic Regulatory Delay: The longer it takes to rule, the more Grail is worth as the industry potential grows• Ease of Spin-off: GRAIL is being held separately without being fully integrated into ILMN (In anticipation?)• MultiBillion Profit: If spun-off, a GRAIL IPO will bring in a lot more than what it cost to re-acquire it (Hot!, hot!, hot!)• Win/Win: Spun off, or not: GRAIL's products will STILL be based on ILMN technology and equipment as will the emerging industry (Can't lose, except for threatened regulator fines.)In acting ""accommodating"" to the regulators by going through the bother of spinning-off GRAIL again perhaps ILMN can:• Earn some Brownie Points with Regulators. • Can Avoid Crushing Financial Penalties, and• Reap in a few extra $ Billions to Boot!Hal"
"The Regulator's Contentions being Made - Specifics• ""Illumina is the only provider of DNA sequencing that is a viable option for these multi-cancer early detection, MCED, tests in the United States.""• ""For the specific application at issue in this matter—MCED tests—developers have no choice but to use Illumina NGS instruments and consumables.""• The ""acquisition will diminish innovation in the U.S. market for MCED tests""• In summary, ""If this acquisition is consummated, it would likely - reduce innovation in this critical area of healthcare, - diminish the quality of MCED tests, and - make them more expensive.”• ""As the only viable supplier of a critical input, - Illumina can raise prices charged to Grail competitors for NGS instruments and consumables; - impede Grail competitors’ research and development efforts; or - refuse or delay executing license agreements that all MCED test developers need to distribute their tests to third-party laboratories."" • It is alledged ""that even if a viable substitute to Illumina’s NGS platform entered the market, it would take years for MCED test developers to switch to a platform other than Illumina’s because they would have to: - reconfigure their tests to work with the new NGS platform, and - in some situations, conduct new clinical trials.""My Comment:The summary above makes the basis of the FTC action we are faced with. This outline of contentions was derived from:https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/03/ftc-challenges-illuminas-proposed-acquisition-cancer-detectionEvidently the final ruling may allow the merger, but may impose some reasonably acceptable operating restrictions on the ILMN/GRAIL combination. I think we could live with such an outcome, and prosper.Hal"
The sleazes that run the FTC like Rohit Chopra & Lina Khan are now going after McDonald’s for broken ice cream machines. FTC ;Plz leave illumina alone. It is saving lives & changing cancer outcomes.
"GRAIL Acciquition: What points and support will be argued in courtBy Regulators:• Negative effect on innovation - ""it would harm innovation and boost prices.""• Tempting Potential Unfair Advantage - would give the company the ""incentive and ability to foreclose downstream rivals."" -per FTC senior counsel Susan Musser• Lack of Formal Approval - Rash act's ""deep regret"" by regulators citedBy ILMN:• Nothing Illegal has happened - ""no legal barrier blocked the deal""• Not a typical acquition - More of a ""reunion"" with GRAIL• Its a Vertical, not a Horizontal merger - ""a rare enforcement action against a ""vertical"" merger in which two companies are not direct competitors.""• Regulator's position is mere speculation -""needlessly gambles with human lives.""• Interruption of Medical Progress - ""merger with Illumina ( ILMN ) will provide the fastest way toward ""widespread commercial acceptance"" of its multi-cancer early detection test""My ConclusionsTime-wise, the whole contest will primarily turn on arguments relating to the net effect on medical progress (not on potential restraint on trade).As to a final ruling, the court is in a position to allow more time for the implications of the ILMN/GRAIL anti-trust situation to come into better focus. I suspect the merger may be able to proceed. However there may be some precautionary business restraints imposed by the court.Hal"
