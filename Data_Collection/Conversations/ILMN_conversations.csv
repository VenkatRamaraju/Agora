"A Bit long but definitely worth a read! shared by someone on Etoro who works as a head of lab and has had first hand experience with Bionano for over 5 years.In genomics (or next generation sequencing), there are so far three main players in the field. The first one is big player Illumina. They offer methods for ‘short read’ sequencing of a maximum length of 600 base pairs (building blocks of DNA). This is sufficient for many questions, but it has its limitations for the sequencing and especially the assembly of a genome. Imagine that your genome consists of many repetitive stretches of your building blocks. If they are longer than 600 bp, you have absolutely no chance to figure out how they are arranged and how many of them it is. This is where third generation sequencing comes into play (‘long read sequencing’). Two main players are on the market. First one is Pacific Biosciences. They released a new technology and a new machine in 2019 (SequelII and HiFi reads). With this you are able to do assemblies of approx. 30 megabases = 30 million base pairs. Human chromosomes (the subunits of the genome) are however 250 million base pairs, so even with PacBio you are not able to sequence a full chromosome. The other big player in long read business is Oxford Nanopore. Don’t want to go into details, but they have a different technique (which is also extremely promising) but they are currently not as accurate as PacBio…maybe in 2-3 years. Also, they have different advantages, which are not relevant for the field in which Bionano is important. So now, where is Bionano? First of all: Bionano does not sequence genomes. I read this very often, but they simply don’t. Bionano does labelling of specific (known!) sequences in the genome and afterwards takes an image of this. By the relative position of these labels, they can create an overall structure of the chromosomes. So, if you have an insertion or deletion somewhere (e.g. in cancer or any other disease which is manifested in the DNA architecture), one of the labels gets shifted and this gets detected. Same is true for relocation of certain sequences. Many of these genomic abnormalities can also be detected with ‘long read sequencing’, but Bionano can detect more, is cheaper and faster. In conclusion, the most important thing is to say, that Bionano doesn’t compete with Illumina or PacBio. They rely on the exact nucleotide sequence of the genome, which is created using, usually a mixture of PacBio/nanopore and Illumina. The assembly of the genome can then be assisted with Bionano. But the greatest potential of Bionano is to be established in diagnostics, where it can replace the traditional clinical cytogenetics, which is costly, time consuming and not very precise. We are on the way to personalized medicine in the future and in my opinion, Bionano will play a key role in it, when it comes to diseases linked to chromosomal abnormalities. This will be a huge market in future and therefore I invest in BNGO…One thing to add: FDA approval is secondary for Bionano. It still can be used. You can still call it 'research use only' and use it for diagnostics. As far as I know PacBio doesn't have any FDA approval, neither does Illumnias biggest machine (NovaSeq). Only 2 smaller sequencers of $ilmn are approved.I don't understand the technical aspects I still have a long way to go, but I have been reading and watching a lot about genome mapping vs sequencing and can understand where the difference lies and how this tech can be used along with others but still have a unique aspect which is unparalleled in the Industry.Also I read Simon Barnett from Ark invest's Twitter lately and understand that FDA approval is not mandatory for BNGO to sell more units of Saphyr thanks for confirming that!I believe in BNGO and the future of Genomics!!"
Down to 200 !! It will be still expensive.
"nothing serious, effect of bond conversions which have commenced october 1st."
"yes, Simon Barnett thinks Grail will require a lot of funding, probably a capital raise and in any event bis inferior technology compared to alternative liquid biopsy tests under trial from competitors."
"by 2024 the addressable market is beyond 20+ billion we can assume that ILMN holds close to 70% market share. If we hold P/S constant and market share we can expect a share price of around 1200 in 2024. That is a essentially from here. Comments, thoughts/projections? It may tank once they take over PACB but from there should have a nice future."
"A Short StoryThe year is 1799 somewhere in the Europe. A talented foundry worker has an idea: A steam-powered mule to plow local fields and to haul produce to town. He gets something primative up and running. It boggs down on the soggy fields and roads. So, he abandons the idea of plowing fields. Instead he takes a lead from a local coal mine: wooden tracks and cross-ties to run on, set apart to exactly fit his tractor's wheels. He buys some land along the road into town and lays some track into town. The resulting haulage business is a hit! But a problem arrises, the local mayor becomes alarmed! What IF IF IF ... this enterprising guy won't allow other businesses to use his tracks. Even if they buy his tractor-mules, they MAY have to lay their own tracks into town. Doubt and alarm lead to lot of discouraging restrictions leading to the strangling of the whole new-fangled concept.Immediately the initial primative steam engine becomes the industry standard of what ever business lingers. Years go by without innovation before enough potential improvements accumulate to justify scrapping everything and starting over. My CommentWhy hobble a whole emerging industry by standardizing it to its first innovation to market?!Hal"
Sell or buy.....
The FTC is just backing up ILMN a little bit. Their domination of the future is obvious to people in the industry. They're just giving ILMN a speed check. ILMN will most likely defend the acquisition successfully after making assurances to the FTC re pricing and access for patients.
Buying opportunity coming. Take advantage when it bottoms. This dip is short term/temporary.
"On Darwin Day, no less, illumina begins its March to a plus $2000 stock. Illumina will unveil a new line of sequencers that will drive whole genome sequencing to sub $100. And Grail is about to revolutionize cancer diagnosis & treatment outcomes benefitting all of humanity. Get on board!! It is ALL happening."
"$ILMN now $450 PPS, $BNGO now sub $8. ILMN execs now moving to BNGO, the writing is on the wall here. There is major upside for BNGO coming....."
"2009 Oct 27, ILMN reported $0.1221/share GAAP, share price about 41.4, 41.4/0.1221 = 339 (Opened next day >16% lower)2019 Oct 24, ILMN reported $1.58/share GAAP, share price about 315, 315/1.58 = 199.4The 2009 numbers are from my broker's software.Genomics is young.I first bought ILMN late 2006 (But sold too often).The big July gap down is about the same % as the 5 drops in 2015-2016. I first bought ILMN Oct 2006 near 22. Declined about 30% before running up to 40. This was when they had just acquired Solexa; but it took a long time to report net profit. I own shares again and thank the crooks for helping drive the price down."
"$ILMN $508, $BNGO $6. BNGO clearly has a great product and 226% YoY revenue increase and plenty of cash on hand. Nothing but growth in both the company and the industry on the horizon. ILMN PPS clearly shows the industry direction and potential. There is absolutely no reason to sell this stock."
"ILMN’s reduction in market cap Since the announcement of the intention to acquire Grail is $6.5 B, about 80% of the $8 B mooted for the purchase. In other words, at a purchase price of $8B, investors are saying the purchase would be overpriced by about 80%. Go figure..."
When Grail comes on board this will be 400$ stock. Liquid biopsy is next big thing.....
"Just read good ol' Jim Jorden is going to fight the FTC, probably run by the lib's now who don't understand business or economics in general. This news could be a good boost for us today and if the FTC gets shut down, HERE WE GO!!!"
Remember...they can also later IPO GRAIL to recapture some of the purchase costs. See SAP’s pre IPO acquisition of Qualtrics...now getting ready to IPO again...
$sens and $ilmn are game changing medical technologies !
It's too bad investors can't think for themselves and need to follow advice from analysts who really don't have a clue
"Abstract of EU Requlator's Initial Reaction to accelerated GRAIL acquition:""Executive Vice-President Margrethe Vestager, in charge of EU competition policy, said: • EU Stands - against ILMN's rush to complete acquition."" -Per:(https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investor-alert-investor-investigation-underway-130000001.html• Risks Cited - Pressure for Grail divestment that could beon terms worse than those of original GRAIL acquition.• Risks Not Specifically Cited: - Fines - Ability to do business in EU through partnership with another EU acceptable company resulting in diluted earnings potentialMy Comment:Clearly ILMN has cast GRAIL as Keystone to its future prosperity. I would like to explore this proposition in greater depth.Comments?HalRE: ""We deeply regret Illumina's decision to complete its acquisition of GRAIL, while our investigation into the transaction is still ongoing. Companies have to respect our competition rules and procedures. Under our ex-ante merger control regime companies must wait for our approval before a transaction can go ahead.” Illumina admitted in its SEC filing that any EU decision could “require Illumina to divest all or a portion of the assets or equity interests of GRAIL on terms that are materially worse than the terms on which Illumina acquired GRAIL, any or all of which, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on Illumina’s business, financial condition and results of operation.”"
"Great day to buy ! Even if in the abstract, the EU decided to levy fines against ILMN for it resorption of GRAIL, the impact could not be enough to take 10% of the market cap of the company. This is the same company it was yesterday, one with nothing but upside. Take advantage of the dip on news (that isn't understood by the average trader) and a down day on the market and pick up your shares at a discount."
The sleazes that run the FTC like Rohit Chopra & Lina Khan are now going after McDonald’s for broken ice cream machines. FTC ;Plz leave illumina alone. It is saving lives & changing cancer outcomes.
"O/T: ILMN news: TerraPharma@TerraPharma1·1hEuropean Commission Opens In-Depth Investigation of $8B Illumina-Grail Merger cont. ""In the US, Illumina has offered its existing customers — potential competitors — guaranteed supply agreements for up to 12 years and a commitment to lower sequencing price per gigabase by 40 percent by 2025."" $ILMN"
"Does it concern anyone that ILMN dropped 15 bucks in the 2 days before this announcement, a sign, to me, that someone knew it was coming, and that a day or 2 ago the SEC started a case against an ILMN accountant for insider trading in ILMN stock? ILMN would be where it will be tomorrow anyway, but it seems to me that some people knew enough to get out. I always accept that it's a crooked market, and this is a clear example of that."
"Word on the street is that ILMN is very concerned with a company coming from China that produces a faster, less expensive solution! Has anyone heard this?"
"ZACKS has finally proved to be a POS! Today's headline says, ""Illumina sinks as market gains .."" The facts say, Illumina sank by a whole 36 CENTS! which is 0.10% ..."
"If you want to be in the genomics space and feel $BNGO is too pricey here, you can always buy a couple of shares of $ILMN. at $415 PPS."
"Just wait until the analysts start doing work on what Grail is worth alone. When they then do a sum of the parts calculation, the stock will appear sorely undervalued"
"any news, getting crushed on an up day ?? Thanks"
Report was concerning. Revs up 6% and 6% projected for 2020. It is a 6% grower now. They had to cut SG&A and R&D to grow eps and that is not repeatable. What is a 6% grower worth ~~it is not worth 45x earnings. Will it head down to 25x? That is a44% drop. We will see. I doubt consumers will pursue health genomics. It puts their DNA out there to be hacked. It also makes it a piece of evidence for health insurers and life insurance companies.
"This appears to be from the BNGO Corp Twitter account. Hopefully this tweet helps educate that BNGO does NOT compete with PACB. ￼ ￼￼￼￼ So to summarize all of this: it’s not $BNGO vs $PACB or $ILMN. They can do much that we can’t do and vice versa. It’s $BNGO vs many decades-old technologies used in thousands of clinics all around the world that sequencing has failed to replace, and #Saphyr can.It seems BNGO actually benefits from and works well with those that use PACB ￼￼with BNGO not instead of. IMHO￼"
"ILMN isn’t stupid, it completed the merger knowing EU has no jurisdiction and knowing they can win in a court battle. EU has its own trouble to deal with like the COVID and the economy, they won’t add to their troubles. Good Luck."

Hearing increasingM&A talk on the street
Joining the 300 club
Another round of profit-taking; beating earnings is not enough anymore.
"the call seems fairly positive to me. and Francis's explanation of why the price for Grail was much higher than that which exact paid for thrive made sense (commercial launch next year, existing FDA approval for Galleri test results going back to patients on the trials). sure it will be earnings dilutive for a while but having the first to market multi cancer liquid biopsy test is a major advantage and will open up a massive market for instruments and consumables for Illumina. and they seemed pretty bullish on returning growth to instruments and. consumables over q2 saying it was a new baseline for future expansion not just catch up. the other interactive point was Francis saying that during the pandemic blood testing has been a consistent metric even though tissue declined and that he expects this to be a permanent change, again positive for Grail."
"ILMN/FTC: Congressional GOP Scamsters Get InvolvedConroversial Jim Jordan and Darrell Issa of ""Stop The Steal"" fame have entered the fray:• Alleging - FTC Chair Lina Khan ""was not following a normal path in its work""• Alleging - Agency actions related to the deal require congressional oversight• Demanding - surrender of ""documents related to the FTC's work""• Contending - The FTC injunction was hastily filed to allow FTC the advantage of deciding the issue in the FTC's own internal administrative court ""to avoid speedily resolving novel legal issues under U.S. law in a forum - Federal District Court - where the FTC was more likely to lose.""MY COMMENTSounds like our lawyer's have enlisted some of the best Washington politicians money can buy.Go Team!Hal"
"GRAIL announces promising new data at ASCO. GRAIL has announced that it has obtaned ""breakthrough device"" designation from the FDA. FYI-illumina owns 20% of GRAIL. Think about it. its cancer screening is going to revolutionize medicine, & make illumina shareholders huge $$$$."
"I am pretty convinced there is manipulation taking place so various institutions can take a large position. People I know in the scientific community tell me that this is the future and at least for now, Illumina dominates the field like Amazon does"
Illumina becomes a $600 to $800+ stock sometime in & around 2021. GRAIL is going be the huge catalyst for the increase in pps. Helix will also be another large catalyst.
"$ILMN took a beating today, as their attment to buy the competition was blocked by the FTC.$BNGO is going to be taking market share from every genomics player."
"The elitist FTC thinks it understands what's best for everyone (thinks it sees the future and how to shape cancer research) and seeks to impose its idiosyncratic ideals on us, despite the fact that the law does not, and should not, preclude the merger.Let's see, would it be good for cancer research if the company who designs the test equipment and algorithms on genomics were allowed to give it a shot?Bureaucrats are idiot control freaks."
Great results! Huge beat! guidance up going forwards! $350+ soon! Load! Load! Load!
"Great move by Illumina to close the deal & force the FTC to go to the courts where the FTC will almost certainly lose. FTC chair Lina Khan is a truly disgusting person out to destroy American capitalism & ingenuity. Same goes to wimps in Brussels. That said, De Souza should never have spun Grail out as a separate entity in the first place."
Grail just got NY State approval for early cancer detection test...
"Bought too early at $328 55 shares and added 125 shares more at $294, planning to hold for at least a month, any thoughts please"
It’s not the Roche partnership moving this stock. ILMN issues weak 2020 guidance at the JPM Healthcare Conference.
"ILMN should buy BNGO while they can before they put them in the storage closet. It is hard to argue with better, faster, less expensive and more comprehensive technology."
Is there a date the US Justice Dept is going to announce on the Grail Acquisition
"when you see some research, analysts are still pretty positive. - ""Overweight"" and Outperform rating. -JPMorgan Chase and Co Reiterates ILMN with Overweight, price target: $350-Barclays Reiterates ILMN with Overweight, price target: $370 -Leerink Partners Reiterates ILMN with Outperform, price target: $365-Cowen Reiterates ILMN with Outperform, price target: $340"
"$ILMN now $486, we can debate the efficacy and use of $BNGO and whether or not it's a direct competitor or enhancement, however the fact that $ILMN has had such a substantial move bodes well for BNGO, as the gemonics sector is obviously getting some significant attention here."
"We have Wolfe this morning downgrading ILMN to ""peer perform"" with the price target lowered from $390 to $280. So basically, they are shaving $16 Bln. in market cap based on $4 Bln in stock dilution. You can argue about the strategic potential of Grail, but you can't just pull numbers out of thin air that make no sense"
Does anyone know when merger decision is to due????
"One rose don't make a summer my friends. Patience and positivity on this stock will pay off hugely. If you are not long on this, perhaps might think about putting you money elsewhere."
"I think the Yahoo estimate of 340 is too conservative. Granted there maybe uncertainty still with PAC BIO acquisition, once that is completed then 340 in 6 months us more believable. And a 12 month target of 15 percent more to 370 is believable in 12 months based on rebranding a SMRT sequencer and completing the software improvements predicted in 2018 by PAC BIO leadership. What will GRAIL be worth in 2020?"
I advise all to buy illumina if it drops to $275 in the general market correction. This stocks doubles in the next 2 years.
"Unfortunately this is quite overvalued at over 50 times earnings, with decelerating earnings and a preannouncement due to a serious miss.When the market corrects which is inevitable, this will likely base out at around 250. Longer-term, I like this company, but I am currently neither short or long."
Great company with great products but seems this is way too much overvalued. How could relatively small company cost $50 billions?
"Just some news, Ark sold their entire position in this stock due to maturing of the Wrights law chart"
"$ILMN trading at $470 PPS and $BNGO, with a superior product is trading at a paltry $7.50 PPS? Not to mention the massive short position in BNGO....It doesn't take genius to figure out which is the better investment......."
"In 2-3 years, this drama today will be a little blimp on ILMN chart while the share price will be around $650. ILMN has a history of such blimps. Just take a look at October 3, 2016 and how it looks like from today's perspective."
someone explain to me how oil or covid-19 have anything to do with Illumina and it's business?
is it a miss? down 3% ah :(
"ILMN is the next generation sequencing market leader. it's at the forefront of the fight against Covid. It's going to be a leader in early stage cancer diagnosis. the share price drop is a blip while investors catch up to the potential, it will soon be worth far more."

"Congrats to all longs who held the stock though the 2016 bear market for ILMN. I swing traded this stock last year, which in hindsight was a mistake. My beef with this stock has been that the valuations were running away from forward earnings estimates.

"I like ILMN stock, it just keeps trending upward. Comany sells to an ever growing market."
Beat on earnings and revenues
"Ok so in other words, ILMN has too deep and wide a moat, too many systemic advantages, and far too much pricing power. Regulators are going to try to tap the brakes on it. Can we all remember how successful the FTC has been over the last decade regulating, say, AAPL GOOG CRM and such?In what world is this a bad story for ILMN? It's like Intel was in the 80s, only for an industry with a much larger overall market than IT."
should it be worrying that there has been a lot of recent sales by insiders?
"It's hilarious that people think this company is overvalued. Genomics and Biotech are the 4th Wave. ILMN is the ultimate pick-and-shovel play on the 4th wave. When millennials get tired of Insta and Twitter, and become scientifically literate and can recognize the opportunity, this will run away like a house on fire. The future is staring you in the face. As usual, most people can't see it."
"Sure, why buy $BNGO with a new disrupting and highly effective technology and product for $6.70 a share when you could buy $ILMN for $400 a share? That makes sense..."
"Great overview on sequencing versus mapping from here:https://www.reddit.com/r/BNGO/comments/l49l79/found_this_guy_on_twitter_he_explains_bngo_so/""First, the Saphyr mapper is not a sequencer, it is, as its name say, a mapper. The difference of a genome sequence and a genome map is that the map aids to decipher the sequence more accurately (for sequence I refer to billions of ATCGATCG…). A genome map is created before the sequencing begins and provides confidence in the sequence obtained. Therefore, the Saphyr mapper, does not compete or substitute any sequencing technology (either from $PACB, $ILMN, $TMO, etc.), but rather it is —COMPLEMENTARY— to it. For an analogy, think of an any given address. Imagine I live at 14th Main street, Springfield, Massachusetts, USA. And someone asks me where I live, and I simply answer “Springfield”. If the person is local of Massachusetts, will probably assume that I live in Springfield MA. However, if I’m asked in a state other than MA, and the person is from a state other than MA, will probably ask “which Springfield”, as there are many cities with this name in all USA; I would have to specify “Springfield, MA.” If you are familiar with the locality, you will probably assume its broader location. I use this analogy because almost every city in USA has a “Main” street; a lot of states have a “Springfield” city; but also, Main street in Springfield do exists in countries other than USA. Following this analogy, if we asked, “what is your address?” the most common different sequencing technologies will give, with great precision, the following answers: $ILMN — 14th Main. $TMO — 14th Main. $QGEN — 14th Main. $PACB — 14th Main, Springfield. None of the above will mention “MA, USA”. Is it possible to locate the accurate address with the first three? NO. Is it possible to locate it with PACB? NOT ENTIRELY. In the same analogy, if you asked the Saphyr mapper “what is your address?” the answer will be:$BNGO — Near Main, Springfield, MA, USA.Would you be able to know the precise address? NO. Therefore, there is no technology that could give a complete and accurate answer, yet.10) Then why is Bionano’s such a big deal? Because currently, the most common tools for mapping at hospitals and clinics around the world are FISH (fluorescent in situ hybridization), DNA microarrays (commonly known as CMA), chromosome banding (CB), and Karyotypes;11) these techniques have existed for at least 20 years and have been the state of the art, so far. What they all have in common is that they are laborious, time consuming and will answer the following to the question “what is your address?”:12)Karyotype — USAMicroarays — SpringfieldFISH — MACromosome banding — Springfield or MA.Why is it that people compare Saphyr to PACB? As you can see, the state of the art for the highest precision was held by PACB, but still it won’t give a fully accurate address.13) So, if hospitals and clinics around the world needed to figure out what is wrong with your genes at a large scale with the most accurate map/sequence, the only option was PACB.14) The biggest disadvantage, however, is that, from all technologies mentioned, PACB is the most expensive and time consuming, and it needs a special expertise that is difficult to find in sequence analysis, hence not many clinics or hospitals even offer this service.15) Why is Bionano’s tech the such a big deal? Because it is only as expensive as any of the other mapping tools, it is high throughput, it covers the entire genome(s) at once, it is automated, and it is way more precise than FISH, CMA, CB, and Karyotypes ALL TOGETHER.16) Finally, the Saphyr mapper will inexorably find chromosomal re-arrengements missed by PACB—as we all have seen it in their webinars and scientific papers— because they resemble that Springfield was erroneously located in MA, USA—but is rather located in Chelmford, UK.17) Why is such a game changer then? Because, if combined, a Saphyr mapper and a sequencing technology (see above) will never miss a mutation or chromosome rearrangement — for large or small this is.18) My forecast for the upcoming years is that there will be a massive adoption of mapping tech at hospitals and clinics around the world in the next 5-10 years, which will substitute entirely FISH, CMA, CB, and Karyotypes.19) Maybe, if Bionano’s tech is the only one offering optical imaging, it will dominate the entire industry for years.As for $BNGO stock price, I have no idea; I am only a scientist that happens to trade.The stock market behaves in ways unpredictable to me.20) The only thing I'm certain is that Bionano’s tech is highly disruptive in its niche. And, if there is one thing I've learned from the Market, is that one thing is the company, another thing is its product/service, and a way different beast is its stock price."""
"J.Flatley taking CEO position at recent IPO. ZY is down today over 75%, good entry point."
"Another great Qtr. for ILMN - Confident-Conservative-Beat Estimates ""as usual!"" Although the new NovaSeq instruments sales has grabbed all the attention, as mentioned in the conference call, I think one of the main underlying powering catalysts for ILMN's vast multi-revenue stream for future growth are the reimbursements/regulation fronts that are clearing the way for ""clinical sector accelerated growth"" in 2018. They addressed these hurdles in 2017 and are now gaining the benefits starting in 2018. IMO, $300/share is the next level to be taken out in 2018. Substantially more if one of the big guys decide to buy them out - it's just so-o-o good of an opportunity!."
This has got to be the quietest message board of all my holdings. Maybe because we are all satisfied with what this compnay is doing and where they are going.
"QUICK Ratio (QR) for Illumina based on the unaudited data from recent SEC 10Q:(1.943 billion + 42.19 billion + 0.47 billion ) / 0.612 billion ~ 72:1. Which means even with decline in stock price, Illumina has a huge potential to steer operations to greater revenues, given the 612 million of current (near term) liabilities. 1.5:1 is a typical strong Q.R. value for a company. Total revenue is still growing despite the consumables prediction miss. Next Gen Sequencing is a game that Illumina can choose to lose, only if management tries very hard."

I bought this during the crash. I’ll probably sell in about 10 years. Excellent investment imo!
"Took a position today with 250 shares, along with BNGO and PACB. Too good to pass up. DCA will continue."
"it's about to buy Grail. it spiked on the news initially then fell back. Grail was due to IPO soon. so they are taking it back in house. makes sense, as it has phenomenal potential and ILMN already had a stake (20 pc?) in it. of course bit may be dilutive if they issue shares to buy it, or maybe cash and shares. anyway long term it's a smart move."
"Illumina, Inc. reportedly escalated in after-hours yesterday in reaction to its post-close announcement of preliminary revenue estimates for the Q1 and full-year 2021.

"Be careful, stock is declining into the Earnings Rpt - not a good indication..."
ILMN buyout of PACB for $8/share. It has been 9 months since the merger was announced The merger completion date was originally set for July 2019. The crazy CMA & FTC have yet to reply with their pronouncements. The CMA’s delay is most certainly political as they are protecting ONT. But our own FTC’s foot dragging is rediculus. I noticed that Oxford Nanopore’s CTO announced that they have “the most superior genome sequencing technology in the world”. This announcement alone should negate the “fear” expressed by the CMA that the ILMN / PACB merger would create a “monopolistic genomic giant”.
This could well be the smartest company on the planet.

"A Bit long but definitely worth a read! shared by someone on Etoro who works as a head of lab and has had first hand experience with Bionano for over 5 years.In genomics (or next generation sequencing), there are so far three main players in the field. The first one is big player Illumina. They offer methods for ‘short read’ sequencing of a maximum length of 600 base pairs (building blocks of DNA). This is sufficient for many questions, but it has its limitations for the sequencing and especially the assembly of a genome. Imagine that your genome consists of many repetitive stretches of your building blocks. If they are longer than 600 bp, you have absolutely no chance to figure out how they are arranged and how many of them it is. This is where third generation sequencing comes into play (‘long read sequencing’). Two main players are on the market. First one is Pacific Biosciences. They released a new technology and a new machine in 2019 (SequelII and HiFi reads). With this you are able to do assemblies of approx. 30 megabases = 30 million base pairs. Human chromosomes (the subunits of the genome) are however 250 million base pairs, so even with PacBio you are not able to sequence a full chromosome. The other big player in long read business is Oxford Nanopore. Don’t want to go into details, but they have a different technique (which is also extremely promising) but they are currently not as accurate as PacBio…maybe in 2-3 years. Also, they have different advantages, which are not relevant for the field in which Bionano is important. So now, where is Bionano? First of all: Bionano does not sequence genomes. I read this very often, but they simply don’t. Bionano does labelling of specific (known!) sequences in the genome and afterwards takes an image of this. By the relative position of these labels, they can create an overall structure of the chromosomes. So, if you have an insertion or deletion somewhere (e.g. in cancer or any other disease which is manifested in the DNA architecture), one of the labels gets shifted and this gets detected. Same is true for relocation of certain sequences. Many of these genomic abnormalities can also be detected with ‘long read sequencing’, but Bionano can detect more, is cheaper and faster. In conclusion, the most important thing is to say, that Bionano doesn’t compete with Illumina or PacBio. They rely on the exact nucleotide sequence of the genome, which is created using, usually a mixture of PacBio/nanopore and Illumina. The assembly of the genome can then be assisted with Bionano. But the greatest potential of Bionano is to be established in diagnostics, where it can replace the traditional clinical cytogenetics, which is costly, time consuming and not very precise. We are on the way to personalized medicine in the future and in my opinion, Bionano will play a key role in it, when it comes to diseases linked to chromosomal abnormalities. This will be a huge market in future and therefore I invest in BNGO…One thing to add: FDA approval is secondary for Bionano. It still can be used. You can still call it 'research use only' and use it for diagnostics. As far as I know PacBio doesn't have any FDA approval, neither does Illumnias biggest machine (NovaSeq). Only 2 smaller sequencers of $ilmn are approved.I don't understand the technical aspects I still have a long way to go, but I have been reading and watching a lot about genome mapping vs sequencing and can understand where the difference lies and how this tech can be used along with others but still have a unique aspect which is unparalleled in the Industry.Also I read Simon Barnett from Ark invest's Twitter lately and understand that FDA approval is not mandatory for BNGO to sell more units of Saphyr thanks for confirming that!I believe in BNGO and the future of Genomics!!Keep an eye on Carbon Cure, Boston Metal, ESS and Pivot Bio. All gonna be really big companies. That is all."
why the after hours sell-off in the midst of great quarterly news? I don't get it?

This outline of contentions was derived from:https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/03/ftc-challenges-illuminas-proposed-acquisition-cancer-detectionEvidently the final ruling may allow the merger, but may impose some reasonably acceptable operating restrictions on the ILMN/GRAIL combination.

"Analysis of M. Fool Article: ""3 Things About Illumina That Smart Investors Know""By Line: ""The company is cemented as the industry leader, but a crack is showing. ... A competing technology is gaining some traction.""• Thing 1: Dominant Market Position - Since 2018-2020 instruments as a share of total sales has declined from 17% to 13%, likewise Services has declined from 18 to 16%. However, consumables has risen steadily from 65 to 71%. ☞ I note that coveted GRAIL is primarily a Consumables type supplier to the industry.• Thing 2: Genomics field is Young & Growing - with sequencing costs falling dramatically ☞ I wonder if equipment costs & margins are also poised to fall - (a More's Law sort of thing?)• Thing 3: Possible Vulnerability - ILMN's technology is Short-Read (multi-Overlapping) type sequencing, but Long-Read upstarts such as PacBio (PACB), which ILMN has already tried and failed to buy: - relates to only 10% of the overall sequencing market but - which is said to be currently growing at a 20% rate. ☞ I suspect that in the long run, a complete across the board capability in the field is most desirable economically - (a one -stop shopping thing?) MY COMMENTUsing the prospering by ""Selling the Supplies rather than Digging the Gold"" 49er Gold Rush Analogy: I suspect the profit margins on Shovels, Mules, and Baccon remained steady back then and steadly in demand, proving ultimately to be more reliable and rewarding than the digging. ☞ I note that Apple and Microsoft do relatively little of the world's actual computing themselves, but still prosper quite nicely. (In fact Apple's shovel has always been a bit easier to wield, their mule less stubborn with more horse-sense, and their Bacon more visually appealing to the palette. Just noting.)Hal"

"@ham I’m curious to get your perspective on the revenue impact Covid 19 will have on Illumina’s earnings with respect to partnerships like Helix, based in San Diego, who are ramping up testing to 100,000 per day on the Novaseq platform.

Question if Grail operates as a separate company where does the revenue and profits get report too.Surly if ILMN owns them it should be to their benefit as Grail grows and gains in value. Comments please??
I imagine that there will be an announcement today probably after market close? for a company to let its' shares plunge like this without comment amidst reports it is acquiring a customer from within its' own organisation is not acceptable.
anyone have any idea why this is up so much? i dont understand based on the call...

Some folks sure hate this deal with Grail. What do they kow that management dos not? Sure baffles me.
"Ok, ILMN does business all over the world right now and there is no problems or disputes, they what to buy a company they once owned that does not do business in EU. So what is all the crying about by the EU?? The company has filed suit in the General Court of the European Union, arguing there is no European jurisdiction because Grail has no active business activities there. ILMN plans to ""vigorously defend"" against any fines. looks solid ground to me Grail has no ties to the EU, end of story. I see no bases for fines!"
"Wait did they just basically say #$%$ to regulators? Interesting move as they can move ahead until a cease and desist happens. If that does, then they can just sell in the U.S. and we will be kings of cancer treatment. Any insight on this?"

"The volume, while not down to normal levels, is starting to come down from the levels since the selloff started. That is a very good sign for longs. It is necessary before a big up move can occur."
I was waiting for Grail to IPO as I was excited about the company... just bought ILMN instead
Ilmn beats on revenue and earnings and goes down after hours. I wonder what the whisper number was
Twitter: People often ask why structural variants (SV) are so important and why $BNGO is laser focused on revolutionizing the way they are detected in the clinic. Doesn’t the success of $PACB and $ILMN show that sequencing and the small variants it detects are what matters?
P/C ratio is 1.85. That's fairly high and we could see a squeeze if the market has positive momentum tomorrow.
"I work in computer/internet technology and that's my area of expertise and where I feel most comfortable making investment decisions. But I certainly don't limit myself to just that area.About 4 years ago I started looking at ILMN and decided to take a small position when it had a significant downturn as it was a perfect opportunity to jump in. It is now almost a 3x return since. Now looking at the top and bottom lines over the last few years, it's far from stellar or what you might expect to see for 3x. I compare that to my ""insanely overvalued"" tech stocks that have gone 2-3x +, which have very steep top line growth and the bottom line is more of a mixed story. When a company that has as much revenue as NFLX or CRM and can still grow it at 20% I have no issue with the ""premium"" on their share prices. And the smaller tech up and comers have even larger growth numbers. But what would you say exactly is driving the capital appreciation in ILMN?"
Not sure this is an issue of decelerating earning or a one time event - an issue of the company trying to understand how to accurately forecast as one analyst put it.
"Off 17 AH, anyone know why??"
"If this stock can break its all time high of $380, it will run to $415-$420. This can happen sometime in the next two to three weeks."

Uncertainty is the mother of all drops in stocks. Melting away.
"wow, this board is so quiet! 91% held by institutions! !"
"I don't understand why ILMN isn't first topic of discussion on WSB. Illumina is probably going to end up being one of the five most important companies of the 21st century, in the same way that INTC was to the 20th. Seriously. Their tech is the gateway to controlling all cancers, life extension, climate change response, wildly higher crop yields, next-gen manufacturing (proprietary organisms, bioreactors), energy, and more. People generally don't understand microbiology and sequenced protein -- just too big and complicated in the same way ICs were too complicated in the 70s. When the full potential of this tech finally dawns on the general public -- many of whom currently don't believe Covid is real -- investment will flood in.Dumb people won't believe me, and that's fine; I want to accumulate more shares without competition."
"The shareprice is going down, which is a weird situation. I think sellers do not understand that aquiring grail with or without approval is a win-win situation for Illumina. The 'fight' with FTC or EU can take a couple of years however, whatever comes out of it is OK for Illumina.When they get approval, all is ok, GRAIL will be integrated and illumina becomes a larger company.When they do not get approval, Illumina needs to sell GRAIL and by then it is worth much more than it is right now and Illumina will profit from it.There is no loser here!"
they will get fined for this. big time.
"Why is there hardly anyone ever posting on this site? Great company, stock doing very well.....Come on people!!"
"not many watching this stock now. Ark have lost faith and sold half their holdings. they're backing Invitae as a winner in genetics, buy I'm not convinced that their strategy of buying as many tests as possible and hoping it makes genetics more widely available and adopted is the right one. who knows when they will be profitable. Illumina is the undisputed market leader in genomic sequencing and Grail puts it firmly back into growth mode, assuming the liquid biopsy test is successful, which I'm sure they must have been very sure of before agreeing this deal. then with sales rebounding this third quarter, the quality of the high earnings must stand out. shares are climbing back up to pre Grail deal levels, but I wish I'd bought after the announcement rather than before. still, I can't time the markets except with hindsight so I will hold for the long term. we should see $400 before too long, hopefully after an upbeat earnings call."
Illumina will be a $600-$700 stock in the near future. GRAIL is going to be a huge money maker.
"$ILMN at $410, $BNGO at $9.64. If revenue is strong with BNGO's upoming ER, PPS will fly. There is no doubt the Saphyr System will take a big bite of the competition's revenue stream."
"Grail deal! I was reading up on Grail again at the weekend. Actually, I think it does make perfect sense, having thought further about it. If I've understood it correctly, Grail is working on a technology that detects cancer early on through DNA clusters swirling around in the bloodstream. If they succeed, it could improve cancer survival rates by five to ten times compared with later diagnosis which must be a massive market opportunity. Because this testing will need very high clinical accuracy it requires huge amounts of data, genome sequencing and computer power for storage and analytics. Illumina have the first two and with Grail, complete the science side of the picture making it very hard for other companies to replicate. they can buy in the computing power. Or, given Jeff Bezos has recently been vocal on healthcare, AWS could buy Illumina outright, post Grail acquisition. Illumina could buy Grail now pre IPO having taken an insider's look at the likely success and timeline. Amazon would have to pay a big premium, but to Jeff, even 100 to 150 billion is pocket change. I wondered if they might have been talking?"
$ILMN trading with a PE of 115 and a market cap of 72.09B. The projected growth in this arena is massive. $BNGO positioned perfectly to tap into that potential.
Ilmn should buy BNGO and they can monopolize the market!!!
Illumina Inc : UBS cuts price target to $350 from $370 * Illumina Inc : Canaccord Genuity cuts price target to $360 from $375 * Illumina Inc : Cowen and Company cuts price target to $340 from $375 * Illumina Inc : Leerink cuts price target to $365 from $380AVERAGE: 353.75
My research after getting caught wrong side for just $100 premium.1.> They have plan to bring DNA Sequence to <$100 (As Doug here saying) Only thing is they don't have real product that can do but sure have roadmap. It's big deal because right now it cost about $1000.2.> they plan to launch Blood test for cancer soon. That sure is break though but there is no FDA approval yet.Based on that this is not Short candidate but I don't feel buy either at this price. I do stuck with bunch of option which I will try find exit. pick wrong stock because option trading is very hard and mistake due to wide spread already cost me couple thousands dollar on top of $8K loss from short call options that I was thinking going to expire today out of money and trying to milk $100 more.
"With the market correction, you could bet this stock is not holding its gains ,"
The math-challenged analysts in unison reduce their price targets by $100 (-$14.6 Bn in market cap) based on $4Bn in stock dilution and some R&D expenses associated with the Grail acquisition. I recall in 2006 many analysts told me to sell AAPL at $2.50 per share because they thought Apple had no experience with cell phones and the market was really competitive and all the R&D would have low ROIC
a) The slavish devotion to Tesla. b) The volatility of Bitcoin.c) The clearing out of their entire position on $ILMNI'm concerned. A lot of this stuff has 5+ years priced in already.
"Results largely in-line and better operating margins projected this year, thus higher than consensus EPS growth. I think expectations were low heading into the quarter with the last-minute Deutche downgrade. I think all in all everything is on track"
Remember when everyone was bashing this stock in September after the Grail acquisition announcement? Never doubt the king of genomics.
"I wonder, why PACB is not discussed more here. ILMN market cap 44 Billion - PACB 7XX million. PACB traded at 4.68 and Takeover ofer offer at 8 standing. Chances not too bad but PACB seems to have a great technology and a great product now. ILMN thinks clearly the same."
What is going on???
"Very low volume today. No one is selling. Take a look at $ILMN today, PPS running on higher revenue. That demand and utility extends to $BNGO, without doubt. The hedgies are not selling today, They're buying."
Ouch what happened?
"Don't be fooled by Maxx Chatsko; illumina's acquisition of Pacific Bio-Sciences will go through. Maxx Chatsko has been wrong on illumina too many times to count. Look for Chatsko to start flapping about negative info on GRAIL in the coming months & years. Don't listen to Chatsko, GRAIL's liquid biopsy will get FDA approval & completely revolutionize the health care industry's treatment of cancer. When FDA approval comes, ilmn's share price will be an easy 2-3 times it's current level. Yeah, I said it, +$900 a share."
I have no interest in ILMN at this time [have owned in the past] but here is an unusually detailed look at the company by seeking alpha it the link works here :https://seekingalpha.com/article/4320127-illumina-strongly-positioned-merger-blow-raised-questions?dr=1&utm_medium=email&utm_source=seeking_alpha
"FYI- GRAIL “s liquid biopsies are proving to be more successful than anyone hoped. False positives are minimal, and the biopsies are able to detect cancer dna at stage 1 & stage 2. Their biopsies will get approved by the FDA, & when the approvals come Illumina”s share price will sky rocket. Illumina will become a $150 billion company. The only way the average investor can bet on GRAIL at the moment is through Illumina & their 20% stake. I think they may have made a mistake in giving up their original 51% stake. Time will tell. Look for a GRAIL IPO in the next 12 to 18months. Illumina s share price will triple within the next 3 to 4 years. Buy all that you can afford."
Chart shows it goes up to 277 a share. Sell now and buy back. I know its a great company and finally goes back to 400.
"From Zach’s “analysis”The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 23. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.Where would we be without them?"
"Hopefully, illumina succeeds in purchasing its own baby back. When the news is properly digested by the Street, illumina will be trading at over $500 a share. The Grail Galleri test is going to revolutionIze cancer diagnoses & treatment outcomes. Illimina is going to be a growth company. It may take 12-18 months but illumina’s share price is going to go significantly higher."
Illumina (ILMN) – Illumina issued preliminary current-quarter and full-year guidance that exceeded current analyst estimates.

Buy all the shares that you can afford in the sub $289 price range This stock sees $400 plus sometime this year.4
Is this worth it to go in today? Or should I wait for tomorrow before the weekend ?
"So to summarize all of this: it’s not $BNGO vs $PACB or $ILMN. They can do much that we can’t do and vice versa. It’s $BNGO vs many decades-old technologies used in thousands of clinics all around the world that sequencing has failed to replace, and #Saphyr can. <--- BNGO´s words."
"1. Their current ownership is slightly brow 20% so they don’t have to include Grail’s current losses in their earnings. I’m assuming the % ownership will slide to at least 15% after Grail’s IPO. If you give Grail a tentative and generous market cap of about $8 billion, 15% would be $1.2 billion or about $.26/ILMN share (mkt cap of $46 billion)."
for long-term investors now may not be the greatest time to buy but I'm definitely not going to sell either..... Why would someone sell this stock with the way the company is operating?
"I don't get it. If ILMN successfully made the deal, it'll make ILMN a much greater company.If ILMN failed in buying Grail, so what? Grail goes IPO and ILMN holdings will appreciate.Either way, ILMN is in at a disadvantage.Someone please enlighten me.Ok, the price. ILMN may pay a price too high? Look at SNOW today. There is no such thing as a price too high for Grail."
Up $20.00 after hoursSales and profits up nicely
are the investors really that fickle minded? yesterday it was complete panic selling and 1 day later for no apparent reason they're panic buying. not sure what to make out of it
"Jeff Brown the self proclaimed genius was running ads to sell his secret report last Friday about this secret stock ILMN. I bought just one share yesterday morning (Monday), and it immediately tanked in the afternoon. Good thing I did not pay for his report, I used my own investigative skill to find out what stock he was referring to. Lost $20 bucks but whatever. I am right to be skeptical and he just lost all his future business from me."
Monster beat on earnings and falling high. what is going on?
I don't get it. ILMN is acquiring GRAIL for $7.1 billion instead of the reported over $8 billion deal. Isn't this a good thing? It's getting GRAIL for about $1 billion less than what we originally thought. Shouldn't ILMN's price shoot upwards instead of dropping?
Earnings were already disclosed at the Morgan conference. Probably going to start a little slow and build throughout the year according to Flatley.
illumina should get to over $400 sometime within the next 6 weeks. It should reach $600 to $800 in the next 18 to 24 months. When the GRAIL News hits hold on and enjoy the ride. illumina is going to be THE Most important company in the history of medicine.
Anyone expecting to see another huge pop in ilmn share price after next weeks JP Morgan Biotech Conference in SF? Big announcements? GRAIL news? Its ALL Happening.
"Once they figure out the privacy concerns, will develop a competitive moat to make it even harder for others to get through the strict privacy regulatatory burden. That's my initial thought.https://www.businessinsider.com/illumina-unsure-of-future-of-direct-to-consumer-genetic-testing-2019-8"
Here we go again. Under 400 after close.....
"I'm thinking of selling my Tesla stock today before battery day to buy this, it's just so cheap, I can't believe investors don't get it!"
This company looks to be in trouble……
When is the court decision expected ??????????
Fantastic performance of ILMN yesterday. It seems the market is beginning to recognize the huge positive aspects of the acquisition.
"News about GRAIL is leaking....... Grail is going to change cancer diagnosis & treatment outcomes. illumina owns 20% of GRAIL & provides all the sequencing for GRAIL's liquid biopsies. Blockbuster. Illumina share price will double & triple in the coming years. Share price $700 to $1000 is not only possible, but probable. We are entering a brave new world. Go boldly, & buy ALL the illumina shares that you can afford. You don't trade illumina, you buy it to own."
"Something to keep in mind; shareholders of Grail (VC's) will receive restricted stock in ILMN as part of the transaction. To hedge their risk, they short (or acquire puts) ahead of the deal. Once the deal closes, they transfer restricted shares to their internal hedge accounts and have a net neutral position. IMO, this is over done. GLA"
The push to Plus $300 will be accomplished within the next 8 weeks. Earnings will be better than expected. The success of GRAIL’s liquid biopsies is looking more inevitable & certain than ever. It is ALL Happening.
"I Like it! Solid move. I would buy more except I fear grabbing a Falling-Knife. I would like to see some rational offical analyst's support and a press release from Management within the next 48 hours. I'm in it for the long run, not short term glory. I see $5,000/share eventually, while re-investing my gains along the way."
"ILMN/GRAIL $8 Billion Acquition/Re-Spin-off >>> PROFIT !?Perhaps ILMN has plans to profit by spinning-off GRAIL anyway, no matter the anticipated Regulator ruling.Observations that have been made by some financial sharps and by the usual touts:• Publicity Factor: There's been a lot of Hoop-La, profitability speculation, and a year's worth of hi-profile speculation and industry sector growth• Increased Value: GRAIL may now be worth more than the $8 Billion ILMN agreed to pay for it a year ago• Strategic Regulatory Delay: The longer it takes to rule, the more Grail is worth as the industry potential grows• Ease of Spin-off: GRAIL is being held separately without being fully integrated into ILMN (In anticipation?)• MultiBillion Profit: If spun-off, a GRAIL IPO will bring in a lot more than what it cost to re-acquire it (Hot!, hot!, hot!)• Win/Win: Spun off, or not: GRAIL's products will STILL be based on ILMN technology and equipment as will the emerging industry (Can't lose, except for threatened regulator fines.)In acting ""accommodating"" to the regulators by going through the bother of spinning-off GRAIL again perhaps ILMN can:• Earn some Brownie Points with Regulators. • Can Avoid Crushing Financial Penalties, and• Reap in a few extra $ Billions to Boot!Hal"
Will ILMN make a move on BNGO by the end of 2021? BNGO is getting even more traction and the price of the stock is a steal.
enough said and enough undone....stock is a buy now!
"Scared, by the time the Court decides, ILMN will be 90. at the rate it's going"
"ILMN : Illumina under probe in Europe over completion of Grail deal7:12 am, Fri, Aug. 20, 2021"
What a great buying op!
"ILMN down $12 Billion in market cap in 2 days because they might make a $5 or $6 Billion acquisition of a company that they are already a large shareholder and insider of and know what the prospects for the company are intimately. Do you really think they would make this acquisition if they didn't know that Grail had something HUGE that could lead to many billions in revenues? Look at GH, another liquid biopsy company, with a market cap in the $10 BIllion area."
"The entire Street downgraded ILMN on the announcement of the Grail acquisition, so I guess we'll gets loads of upgrades tomorrow, right?"
"I've been meaning to get into this stock, because they have a strong balance sheet, but the growth appears to be limited, CEO suggested 10% increase for FY2020, so the P/E ratio is somewhat high, do you think at this price of 360 presents a good buy for long term?"
No news about EU anti-trust that was supposed to make a decision on the GRAIL deal today?
ILMN is up 4.92% to 256.87
Question Is ILMN going to be able to buy Grail back?? Why would they stop it they use to own it.
Love it at this price. I know there are plenty of reasons for the gyrations but once it gets from 280-290 it's proved to be fairly stable. Good luck all!
This was one gutsy move on the part of ilmn. Just do the acquisition and ask forgiveness. hahaha. The regulators are gonna have to prove harm at this point to unwind the merger. This is awesome.
