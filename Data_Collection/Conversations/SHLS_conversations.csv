"Good opportunity to add. I like a lot that they are on the move with impressive year over year growth, that they have lots of proprietary stuff and that JP Morgan has 40 million skin in the game. Expecting a good return in 6-12 months."

"I'm in and holding to $60, Institutions will be picking up this one and I'm sure CEO will be on Mad Money soon.Shoals TechThe full setup of gear is referred to as electrical balance of system, or ""EBOS"" solutions.""EBOS components are mission-critical products that have a high consequence of failure, including lost revenue, equipment damage, fire damage, and even serious injury or death,"" the company said in its IPO filing. ""As a result, we believe customers prioritize reliability and safety over price when selecting EBOS solutions.""For the nine months ended Sept. 30, Shoals reported revenue of $136.7 million, up 28% from the year-ago period. Net income was $29.5 million vs. $17.3 million a year ago."

"Bought on the dip at 31.11, it is a future growing stock."
buy sunpower instead
Bought 400 @ $34.00 (it´s ok). Adding more now
"I was very excited with SHLS in my portfolio and planned to keep it for a very long term but I am under extreme stress now after the annual results. The reason is, they raised $2B through IPO but it didn't go to the company. According to the annual report filed by them, recently they had to raise over $300m as debt which destroyed the balanced sheet. Now they have negative share holder equity."
why is it dropping?
Jumped up at the open and then reversed. Looks like the weight of the overall market held it back from a good breakout.
drop drop drop i have an order to buy for $30.15 please
Time to buy
They for sure overpriced it at $22.00 already............and they want us to pay $33.xx ?I don't think so............ But if you disagree.......it's only your money......

Definitely on an uptrend.
"Hi, who else remembers this stock? Loosing on the short term but it is a good long one"

I don't know about this stock. I understand that the stock market is down but this is not even holding for what it opened.
Looks like they’re being punished because they missed on EPS by a penny. Everything else was excellent.
My broker is letting me down rn
"Amazing conference call, expanding to Europe now, 7 new patents, margins from 30 to 37%. EV charging market as well. This is a beast"

"Man, is this thing way overvalued !"
this looks to be the safest bet i made this week it is in one of the best sectors with green energy and they sell to all the green power producers they will grow exponentially winner winner chicken dinner
Id like to buy this around $27....valuation a little high for my tastes. Then again I dont think its gonna drop to $27 so....is nobody else concerned that this is going to take a long time to produce any upward momentum because its currently fully valued for the next couple years??
"stup****est stock ever, buy SPWR instead."
Tough Crowd
"stupiidest stock ever, buy SPWR instead."
Like how they timed this with climate announcement today. Underwriters know what they are doing.

buy call options on this one. Fractal energy is high and hit 21 period linear regression -2 std dev
what is happening with this stock?
The price is going below 20.40 today. But it will bounce up after that.

It hurts when the ownership kicks ya in the nads.
"Question, How come I can’t buy on my td Ameritrade account ? Says stock does not exist.."

I don’t know much about this company but I bought some anyway. I sold some ENPH to get this. Was that a smart move?
"yeah guys, after great earnings dropped 25%, this just say everything about this stock. buy sun power."
"Any news on why price is going down today, did anything happen inside the company or people just selling"
This is an incredible opportunity to load up . Anything under $30 I am adding
Amazing company
SHLS is down 10.43% to 29.54
Got in :) !!!
Broker account said all allocations were made and i dont have any so guess i missed out again
SHLS is up 9.41% to 35.69
Just got on with a couple shares
I agree. The nasdaq is under pressure and this is getting hit hard with low volume. I will pick up some more shares once the dust settles in the market.
Held up well with such a scarlet red day
Had a big ole grin when it hit 34.5
"Hopefully, we can sustain today's upward trajectory, up 3.5% at time of this post. SHLS has the right solutions at the right time!"
Roll Tide Roll! Up Bigly soon!!
Any idea when the IPO will be?Steve E
"it's just a new yet somewhat unstable company here, will come back .... you see .. I'm calm."
"In for 2,000. I like this one."
Check out SING or Singlepoint. Very cheap right now and getting lots of media attention on YouTube. They will be up listing to the Nasdaq in the not so distant future and are in 38 states now. They are the one stop shop for solar. They are trying to emulate a Rocket Mortgage concept. Way underpriced and have revenue increases quarter after quarter. Good luck!
any update on public trading time?
why this stock keep bleeding
Nobody wants solar stocks now...
Buying

"$APPS is one of my favourite growth stocks rn. Another 4 are: $ACMR, $ONTO, $FOUR and $SHLS - I've covered them here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmXgr-AKZ-w$APPS is probably the best value along with $ACMR and $ONTO. $FOUR is very promising, but it's priced a bit steep and I'm a bit worried about $SHLS 's finances so I'll put those two on my watchlist. Thoughts?"
FFS they beat on everything .
Bought more on the dip. This one will be a winner.
"Monster day. This thing has some big boys behind it, should be a beast in short order."
