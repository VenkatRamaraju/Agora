"THERMO should fire mgmt. team, selling the company at a low price is one thing, but not making a higher deal with a giant explosion in rev. is another, at $44 is acsteal"
"this should be 40s. Dow futures down 300. Two front runners with coronavirus diags, QGEN and CODX. QGEN is established company and more reliable."
What?s the likelihood of shareholders rejecting the #$%$39 per share offer? GNMK sp has risen 100% since this offer was made. #$%$39 seems way too cheap!
is it true $QGEN is going to get FDA approval before codx? What does this mean for us?
can anyone explain why this company stock prices isn't moving like other testing and mask makers go parabolic?
39 euro per share =$43.36 US dollar
"Guys, no need to be panic. This is worth more than $40!"
"Great overview on sequencing versus mapping from here:https://www.reddit.com/r/BNGO/comments/l49l79/found_this_guy_on_twitter_he_explains_bngo_so/""First, the Saphyr mapper is not a sequencer, it is, as its name say, a mapper. The difference of a genome sequence and a genome map is that the map aids to decipher the sequence more accurately (for sequence I refer to billions of ATCGATCG…). A genome map is created before the sequencing begins and provides confidence in the sequence obtained. Therefore, the Saphyr mapper, does not compete or substitute any sequencing technology (either from $PACB, $ILMN, $TMO, etc.), but rather it is —COMPLEMENTARY— to it. For an analogy, think of an any given address. Imagine I live at 14th Main street, Springfield, Massachusetts, USA. And someone asks me where I live, and I simply answer “Springfield”. If the person is local of Massachusetts, will probably assume that I live in Springfield MA. However, if I’m asked in a state other than MA, and the person is from a state other than MA, will probably ask “which Springfield”, as there are many cities with this name in all USA; I would have to specify “Springfield, MA.” If you are familiar with the locality, you will probably assume its broader location. I use this analogy because almost every city in USA has a “Main” street; a lot of states have a “Springfield” city; but also, Main street in Springfield do exists in countries other than USA. Following this analogy, if we asked, “what is your address?” the most common different sequencing technologies will give, with great precision, the following answers: $ILMN — 14th Main. $TMO — 14th Main. $QGEN — 14th Main. $PACB — 14th Main, Springfield. None of the above will mention “MA, USA”. Is it possible to locate the accurate address with the first three? NO. Is it possible to locate it with PACB? NOT ENTIRELY. In the same analogy, if you asked the Saphyr mapper “what is your address?” the answer will be:$BNGO — Near Main, Springfield, MA, USA.Would you be able to know the precise address? NO. Therefore, there is no technology that could give a complete and accurate answer, yet.10) Then why is Bionano’s such a big deal? Because currently, the most common tools for mapping at hospitals and clinics around the world are FISH (fluorescent in situ hybridization), DNA microarrays (commonly known as CMA), chromosome banding (CB), and Karyotypes;11) these techniques have existed for at least 20 years and have been the state of the art, so far. What they all have in common is that they are laborious, time consuming and will answer the following to the question “what is your address?”:12)Karyotype — USAMicroarays — SpringfieldFISH — MACromosome banding — Springfield or MA.Why is it that people compare Saphyr to PACB? As you can see, the state of the art for the highest precision was held by PACB, but still it won’t give a fully accurate address.13) So, if hospitals and clinics around the world needed to figure out what is wrong with your genes at a large scale with the most accurate map/sequence, the only option was PACB.14) The biggest disadvantage, however, is that, from all technologies mentioned, PACB is the most expensive and time consuming, and it needs a special expertise that is difficult to find in sequence analysis, hence not many clinics or hospitals even offer this service.15) Why is Bionano’s tech the such a big deal? Because it is only as expensive as any of the other mapping tools, it is high throughput, it covers the entire genome(s) at once, it is automated, and it is way more precise than FISH, CMA, CB, and Karyotypes ALL TOGETHER.16) Finally, the Saphyr mapper will inexorably find chromosomal re-arrengements missed by PACB—as we all have seen it in their webinars and scientific papers— because they resemble that Springfield was erroneously located in MA, USA—but is rather located in Chelmford, UK.17) Why is such a game changer then? Because, if combined, a Saphyr mapper and a sequencing technology (see above) will never miss a mutation or chromosome rearrangement — for large or small this is.18) My forecast for the upcoming years is that there will be a massive adoption of mapping tech at hospitals and clinics around the world in the next 5-10 years, which will substitute entirely FISH, CMA, CB, and Karyotypes.19) Maybe, if Bionano’s tech is the only one offering optical imaging, it will dominate the entire industry for years.As for $BNGO stock price, I have no idea; I am only a scientist that happens to trade.The stock market behaves in ways unpredictable to me.20) The only thing I'm certain is that Bionano’s tech is highly disruptive in its niche. And, if there is one thing I've learned from the Market, is that one thing is the company, another thing is its product/service, and a way different beast is its stock price."""

$35+ by end of day
"The deal looks like a few more dollars will be added ,maybe around enough to make $48.50"
will bounce backthis was rush selling
got my offer today and I'm confused as hell what happens if I don't take it
It will bounce back to 35 soon
On CNBC right now

Shipments are being sent to the U.S. It not only tests for Covid-19 but 20 other respiratory viruses. Returns results in about an hour. Good news.
Company must be worth much more than offers. Expect new offer at much higher price is my guess.
So they are acquiring all of these shares at $50.73
On Bloomberg suitors may still be interested. Qgen no doubt holding out for higher bid.
"Finally, but low bid....."
Some BO news?
Bought at $54.12. Just watching this rocket ship.
"Qiagen is a great company, will definitely go up to 40 at least."
Any chance a company comes back at 50?
Back to $38-$40 today. Way oversold yesterday
"Just saw Qgen on CNBC, they’ve been asked to distribute their test kits for Coronavirus worldwide"
Whisper....Did I hear $42 ???
Commerzbank analyst Daniel Wendorff upgraded Qiagen NV (NYSE: QGEN) from Hold to Buy with a price target of $48.00.
"Worth $50""The Supervisory Board and Management Board conducted a wide-ranging review of strategic alternatives for our business and determined that the ongoing transformation provides the best means for creating future value for shareholders and other stakeholders,"" said Dr. Håkan Björklund, Chairman of the Supervisory Board of QIAGEN N.V.

$CODX may be next as soon as Americans start listening to medical scientists rather than Wall St analysts regarding worldwide demand for accurate Covid 19 tests. CODX only has 12M shares outstanding. Looking for parabolic?
"Hope the activist investors had a plan in mind when they decided to raise the offer price. I never expected this deal to collapse. Before all the acquisition talk, this company wasn’t looking too good. If COVID has done anything it has allowed a lot of smaller molecular players to enter the market. Post-COVID will be interesting for Qiagen."
"Sold Codx because too many red flags. 20 employees, low quality site and promo videos. The co founders sounded high, one of the describing scientific process with words like ""stuff"" and ""this thing"" really? found it weird that with 25mil shares outstanding volume is well over 70mil each day past 6 days. then they issue more stock at market. Bought the real deal in Qgen. hope to see some hood exposure. Good luck to us."
"If TMO offered 45 and they wanted 50, may be they will accept now 47-48..."
"This has a very low beta of .32 so no wild rides here but a slow and steady go. This is #1 buy by Zacks, Investor Business Daily says it is on a breakout, Fidelity Star mine rates it a 9.2% out of ten, And Ford Equity Research rates it a best #1."
"Translation:Again American interest in biotech company Qiagen from Venlo'Published on February 8, 2021 8:56 PM | Views: 91 | Topics: biotechnologyArticleCommentsVENLO (ANP) - The German-Dutch biotechnology company Qiagen may still be in American hands. Healthcare technology company Quidel is reportedly considering including Qiagen. Six months ago, another takeover by an American company failed.Bloomberg news agency reports on the basis of insiders that Quidel has approached the company with headquarters in Venlo to gauge interest in a possible deal. The deliberations are said to be at an early stage and it is not certain that they will lead to a deal. Qiagen himself declined to comment, and Quidel has not yet responded. Based on the company's stock market value, a deal could cost more than $ 10 billion.Qiagen would actually be taken over by the American Thermo Fischer. But that medical technology company decided against that in August. The parties had agreed that at least two-thirds of Qiagen's shareholders should support the proposal. In the end, not even half the shares of the biotechnologist were offered and so Thermo Fisher withdrew his offer. The German-Dutch company then had to pay a hefty expense allowance to Thermo Fischer.Qiagen, which is mainly active in Germany, offers a variety of test products. Last year, the company attracted a lot of attention because it offers medical instruments and materials to detect the corona virus. The production capacity for these items was increased considerably."
Ellume just got a $230 million dollar contract to ramp up production - LIVE CDC Press Conference!
Flat all day...Up 5-7% tomorrow morning.Nice buy here
Even more tests going forward into the summer. Good for 10-20% in short term pop.
