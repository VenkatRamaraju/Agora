You would think their test kits would be juicing revenues
TIMBERRRRRRRRRRR
Back to $38-$40 today. Way oversold yesterday
Staying long
"If QGEN is a lot more valuable because they become the supplier for test kit reagents, what does that mean given Thermo Fisher agreed to buy them?"
Good. More testing. Open the USA now. Let’s go!
39 euro per share =$43.36 US dollar
QGEN reached a 52 Week low at 26.03
So it got EUA today. Why isn't the stock going up?I bought few shares and it's actually going down slightly.What say you?
$CODX may be next as soon as Americans start listening to medical scientists rather than Wall St analysts regarding worldwide demand for accurate Covid 19 tests. CODX only has 12M shares outstanding. Looking for parabolic?
A break of 38.66 could move it up to 45.57.
QGEN is down 26.45% to 30.50
admp approval!
"this should be 40s. Dow futures down 300. Two front runners with coronavirus diags, QGEN and CODX. QGEN is established company and more reliable."
Qiagen reached a 52 Week high at 47.73
Still waiting for the “greater fool” company to buyout QGEN? It’s the only thing positive on the horizon for them...except more layoffs in January. Buy DXCM instead.
"Guys, no need to be panic. This is worth more than $40!"
Your money is safer in the Sealy Posturpedic Bank & Trust than in QGEN. Dividends yield is the same also.
"""Come to papa......!"""
Ousting the CEO will fix everything?
"Pretty soon, there will be just Thermo, Danaher and Illumina in the life science tools sector"
Qiagen is down 7.53% to 37.93
Where’s 45 ?
A lots of buying before open. Shorts covering?....
wow..another popular board..I like this better anyways. most is just noise anyways..

"$SGMD upward movement expected after financials on the 22ndSugarmade has a 40% stake with an option to increase the ownership to 70% in Budcars which has a near 5/5 rating on multiple websites and growing quarter over quarter very rapidly. Also, an expansion of Budcars services to new territories will be announced any time soon. We’re talking millions and millions in revenue. Lastly, they will also grow and sell their own cannabis products which they will announce sometime this year. FUTURE LOOKS BRIGHT"
"I am buying a small position here, will add more after market open and price is under 30......"
What makes QGEN a better investment than putting your money into an S&P 500 index fund?

"Doubt it, moving lower"
Are they still in business?
Qiagen reached a 52 Week high at 45.13
Declining profits
Company must be worth much more than offers. Expect new offer at much higher price is my guess.
Qiagen reached a 52 Week high at 50.38
On Bloomberg suitors may still be interested. Qgen no doubt holding out for higher bid.

bullish volume
Didn't expect this
Interesting move up on red day!?....
Buy buy buy. Today
they keep trying to get people to sell.....add more!
No value for virus testing
"Hope the activist investors had a plan in mind when they decided to raise the offer price. I never expected this deal to collapse. Before all the acquisition talk, this company wasn’t looking too good. If COVID has done anything it has allowed a lot of smaller molecular players to enter the market. Post-COVID will be interesting for Qiagen."
"Started a position at $29.40 pre market, adding."
Chopper is waiting for everyone at BNGO. Taking off real soon !

Huge news today with the new contract
I've seen much worse charts

I heard trump say thermo Fisher..it should help qgen
got my offer today and I'm confused as hell what happens if I don't take it
It can’t even get back to 40 in a runaway market
is it true $QGEN is going to get FDA approval before codx? What does this mean for us?

"Below @25 this week. Going nowhere, except down."
it was up over $1 last night but after hours and pre market dont mean squat unless it's super high volume then. either way it's looking good..Qgen
Qiagen reached a 52 Week high at 46.41
Any chance a company comes back at 50?
can anyone explain why this company stock prices isn't moving like other testing and mask makers go parabolic?
we find out on pre-market... a drop is a drop.. but wow this a huge onehttps://soundcloud.com/angkorian/jaya-ali-bboy-on-high
Flat all day...Up 5-7% tomorrow morning.Nice buy here
No buyers
No earnings today
Is it true that QDEL will be squiring QGEN? of a merger?
Still waiting for that Gene Reader and all those disjointed bioinformatics acquisitions to take off? Buy ILMN instead..

This stock I recall was I upper 30 ' s niw in upper 20's. That's almost 30% down!!!
This is now trading above take-out price. Maybe a bidding war is brewing?
Boxing day sale. There were a few 50K buying blocks. I like their technology. ILMN might have a look after PACB deal might not go through....
"Watching paint dry? When the news hit it will be ""kaboom""......"

A lot of M&A activity in pharma world. Is QGEN next? Trading will be halted/ Waiting for a news.....
"Just saw Qgen on CNBC, they’ve been asked to distribute their test kits for Coronavirus worldwide"
"The deal looks like a few more dollars will be added ,maybe around enough to make $48.50"
"QGEN longs unfortunately are riding on the wrong pony..... Unlike QGEN, MTNB is positioning the company for a late 2020 sale after important key asset readouts are released..... MTNB is worth between $50-$150, depending on how many of MTNB's robust 4 drug pipeline and estimated 9-12 LNC drug candidates from PFE, GSK, Roche and their 4th anonymous big pharma partner move forward.... Good luck...... MTNB "
"Sold Codx because too many red flags. 20 employees, low quality site and promo videos. The co founders sounded high, one of the describing scientific process with words like ""stuff"" and ""this thing"" really? found it weird that with 25mil shares outstanding volume is well over 70mil each day past 6 days. then they issue more stock at market. Bought the real deal in Qgen. hope to see some hood exposure. Good luck to us."
Something seems to be brewing.
This years restructuring announcement and layoffs are running late..What gives?

"Great overview on sequencing versus mapping from here:https://www.reddit.com/r/BNGO/comments/l49l79/found_this_guy_on_twitter_he_explains_bngo_so/""First, the Saphyr mapper is not a sequencer, it is, as its name say, a mapper. The difference of a genome sequence and a genome map is that the map aids to decipher the sequence more accurately (for sequence I refer to billions of ATCGATCG…). A genome map is created before the sequencing begins and provides confidence in the sequence obtained. Therefore, the Saphyr mapper, does not compete or substitute any sequencing technology (either from $PACB, $ILMN, $TMO, etc.), but rather it is —COMPLEMENTARY— to it. For an analogy, think of an any given address. Imagine I live at 14th Main street, Springfield, Massachusetts, USA. And someone asks me where I live, and I simply answer “Springfield”. If the person is local of Massachusetts, will probably assume that I live in Springfield MA. However, if I’m asked in a state other than MA, and the person is from a state other than MA, will probably ask “which Springfield”, as there are many cities with this name in all USA; I would have to specify “Springfield, MA.” If you are familiar with the locality, you will probably assume its broader location. I use this analogy because almost every city in USA has a “Main” street; a lot of states have a “Springfield” city; but also, Main street in Springfield do exists in countries other than USA. Following this analogy, if we asked, “what is your address?” the most common different sequencing technologies will give, with great precision, the following answers: $ILMN — 14th Main. $TMO — 14th Main. $QGEN — 14th Main. $PACB — 14th Main, Springfield. None of the above will mention “MA, USA”. Is it possible to locate the accurate address with the first three? NO. Is it possible to locate it with PACB? NOT ENTIRELY. In the same analogy, if you asked the Saphyr mapper “what is your address?” the answer will be:$BNGO — Near Main, Springfield, MA, USA.Would you be able to know the precise address? NO. Therefore, there is no technology that could give a complete and accurate answer, yet.10) Then why is Bionano’s such a big deal? Because currently, the most common tools for mapping at hospitals and clinics around the world are FISH (fluorescent in situ hybridization), DNA microarrays (commonly known as CMA), chromosome banding (CB), and Karyotypes;11) these techniques have existed for at least 20 years and have been the state of the art, so far. What they all have in common is that they are laborious, time consuming and will answer the following to the question “what is your address?”:12)Karyotype — USAMicroarays — SpringfieldFISH — MACromosome banding — Springfield or MA.Why is it that people compare Saphyr to PACB? As you can see, the state of the art for the highest precision was held by PACB, but still it won’t give a fully accurate address.13) So, if hospitals and clinics around the world needed to figure out what is wrong with your genes at a large scale with the most accurate map/sequence, the only option was PACB.14) The biggest disadvantage, however, is that, from all technologies mentioned, PACB is the most expensive and time consuming, and it needs a special expertise that is difficult to find in sequence analysis, hence not many clinics or hospitals even offer this service.15) Why is Bionano’s tech the such a big deal? Because it is only as expensive as any of the other mapping tools, it is high throughput, it covers the entire genome(s) at once, it is automated, and it is way more precise than FISH, CMA, CB, and Karyotypes ALL TOGETHER.16) Finally, the Saphyr mapper will inexorably find chromosomal re-arrengements missed by PACB—as we all have seen it in their webinars and scientific papers— because they resemble that Springfield was erroneously located in MA, USA—but is rather located in Chelmford, UK.17) Why is such a game changer then? Because, if combined, a Saphyr mapper and a sequencing technology (see above) will never miss a mutation or chromosome rearrangement — for large or small this is.18) My forecast for the upcoming years is that there will be a massive adoption of mapping tech at hospitals and clinics around the world in the next 5-10 years, which will substitute entirely FISH, CMA, CB, and Karyotypes.19) Maybe, if Bionano’s tech is the only one offering optical imaging, it will dominate the entire industry for years.As for $BNGO stock price, I have no idea; I am only a scientist that happens to trade.The stock market behaves in ways unpredictable to me.20) The only thing I'm certain is that Bionano’s tech is highly disruptive in its niche. And, if there is one thing I've learned from the Market, is that one thing is the company, another thing is its product/service, and a way different beast is its stock price."""
$230 million federal contract to build factory in U.S. given to partner Ellume. This is going to be huge for QGEN!
will bounce backthis was rush selling
Stating shipping on CNBC just now. ....going up fast
"This has a very low beta of .32 so no wild rides here but a slow and steady go. This is #1 buy by Zacks, Investor Business Daily says it is on a breakout, Fidelity Star mine rates it a 9.2% out of ten, And Ford Equity Research rates it a best #1."
"BlackRock, Inc. claims to own 23530964 shares. This represents 10.2% of Qiagen N.V.!! Really BIG!!"
"Bought at 32, I will hold it till 40 at least"
"Thermo-Fisher is buying Qiagen for 39 euros. That is $43.68 in US dollars. And, QGEN trades at $39.46 at the close. Ridiculous. I had to go to Thermo-Fisher to find this out. All of the other stories on the internet are not clear on this. Why?"
Offered $45Qgen wanted $50NO deal
see http://greatchartanalysis.zohosites.com/ .
Why not sell a company when street will never give them the benefit of the doubt
"They go from being dead set against the buyout to being ""all in"" over the matter of a couple of bucks per share??? Something is very fishy here."
"AMRN, Wooow buyouts noise really hot just make sure it’s over $100 , a year or two will be Lipitor price, $ALLK $PLAN $QGEN $GTHX $TWTR all undervalued"
Only recovering the previous day’s losses and near LOD
Multiple offers? Sounds good.....
Qgen will be in beast mode soon
Bought at $54.12. Just watching this rocket ship.

Any news on the gene reader? How many have they sold?
Not sure there would be a premium
when cash will be given
Yes!!
Pauls picks2020 strong  buy. All longs get on LXXG now it’s getting FDA soon.
Like most of us these days QGEN needs a good haircut
I just don’t get it CODX does nothing in sales. QGEN is a real company that Scott Gottlieb referred time this morning on CNBC this morning.
this should do good in time..good company if thermo Fisher bought it..tells you something
Thermo fisher to aquire for 11.5bn!

Virus to cripple corporate profits if keeps spreading
"7200 comments on CODX only 183 here. Are we sure about QGEN? QGEn volune 6Mil, CODX 27Mil. Maybe buy both."
Probably closed door meetings/negotiations whole weekend. Most likely there were secret talks already.We might hear news on Monday.........
"Translation:Again American interest in biotech company Qiagen from Venlo'Published on February 8, 2021 8:56 PM | Views: 91 | Topics: biotechnologyArticleCommentsVENLO (ANP) - The German-Dutch biotechnology company Qiagen may still be in American hands. Healthcare technology company Quidel is reportedly considering including Qiagen. Six months ago, another takeover by an American company failed.Bloomberg news agency reports on the basis of insiders that Quidel has approached the company with headquarters in Venlo to gauge interest in a possible deal. The deliberations are said to be at an early stage and it is not certain that they will lead to a deal. Qiagen himself declined to comment, and Quidel has not yet responded. Based on the company's stock market value, a deal could cost more than $ 10 billion.Qiagen would actually be taken over by the American Thermo Fischer. But that medical technology company decided against that in August. The parties had agreed that at least two-thirds of Qiagen's shareholders should support the proposal. In the end, not even half the shares of the biotechnologist were offered and so Thermo Fisher withdrew his offer. The German-Dutch company then had to pay a hefty expense allowance to Thermo Fischer.Qiagen, which is mainly active in Germany, offers a variety of test products. Last year, the company attracted a lot of attention because it offers medical instruments and materials to detect the corona virus. The production capacity for these items was increased considerably."
this should gain way more attention by now. so wierd that codx is rocket high but this barely moved...
"Stock up 2% today on news of layoffs , lowered guidance and revenues up only 1% ..probably lower than this years price increases. Management attributing weak demand in China. More like bad acquisitions, no innovation, extremely weak middle management. Lawyers swarming"
Even TMO doesn’t want this
"Worth $50""The Supervisory Board and Management Board conducted a wide-ranging review of strategic alternatives for our business and determined that the ongoing transformation provides the best means for creating future value for shareholders and other stakeholders,"" said Dr. Håkan Björklund, Chairman of the Supervisory Board of QIAGEN N.V. ""We have a strong and differentiated portfolio of molecular testing solutions that provide opportunity for significant growth."

2.4B market cap gone! Long got hosed! merryx
Whisper....Did I hear $42 ???
Verogen is a good move. Making a problem for a Thermo monopoly
Even more tests going forward into the summer. Good for 10-20% in short term pop.
Commerzbank analyst Daniel Wendorff upgraded Qiagen NV (NYSE: QGEN) from Hold to Buy with a price target of $48.00.

No sale so stock is down 11% in pre market. I have held this stock for a while. Might add to my position after the dust settles. I think somewhere around 20. Could be wrong. Long on Qgen
QGEN will need to issue more stocks so it can further develop products for the management's retirement and many years of income.
All valuation bubbles unfortunately end this way..... Cash in your chips and move on........ MTNB 
$35+ by end of day
Stock s dip on good news. That is called reverse economy..
should hit $50 in a week if not sooner
For start 45-50 offers?.......
Not a good Christmas for these longs.
We should see 45+ today....
"THERMO should fire mgmt. team, selling the company at a low price is one thing, but not making a higher deal with a giant explosion in rev. is another, at $44 is acsteal"
"QGEN buyouts yes/ no , like ADPT much stronger"
"There are already so many players offering millions of tests ($CODX, $OPKO, $QGEN, etc.). The list grows everyday. You can lose money when you block anybody posting ""bad"" comments, and they might be right. You need to listen to both sides of a story."
"Qiagen is a great company, will definitely go up to 40 at least."
