"29 analysts' estimate revenue growing over 18% on average for this year and next, matching the company's forecast on the conference call yesterday. Virtually no changes in analyst's estimates in the past 30 days. The market estimate for earnings was $2.21 while they delivered $2.44 for the quarter ending June 2019. Yahoo Finance has an error of showing ""EPS Actual 1.93"" when it should be $2.44. Maybe that is why the stock is tanking?"
Dropping 5% why ? It’s not earnings. Thanks
Hello down there...still debating a purchase of ANET at $250 a share...lets talk at $290.
Any guesses on tomorrow afternoon earnings?
"Guys.... ANET was over $310 before the earning report. They had an awesome report with a HUGE beat on the top and the bottom line. Some big players tried to bring the price down by over selling but stuff like this NEVER works for a company that has a very strong fundamentals and ANET is bouncing faster than ever. The reality is that considering the price before the earning and the great report, this stock should really be at $360 now and it will get there very fast. It could be as early as next week. Load up as much as you can. you will thank me. Please like this post if you agree! Lets make this post the most popular one on yahoo! :)"

"Many people are seeking for stability in this unstable crypto space and even the stock market, A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now. I'd say it's wrong to just sit back hold and wait maybe incur some losses along the line, that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making profits should be the way of life that being said, the market is still majorly about BTC at the moment and I'll advise current investors and newbies to take advantage of the Mr. Arthur's copy Trading platform, a platform that handles people who lack understanding on how to maneuver the crypto space and stock market, to help them recover loss from the crash and also accumulate more positive returns, with this platform i went from having 1.4btc to 7btc in just 9 weeks.

"So... Why is this down after hours? They beat EPS expectations. I know revenue is down YoY, but that was expected by analysts already. I don't have shares, so I'm neither bullish nor bearish. But this just seems misaligned with results....."
"I do not have a position as of this writing but I just don't get the fascination with this stock. I realize they are still very profitable but there is not growth. Realize they have a good balance sheet but, again, there is no growth. A 10 multiple is much more reasonable than 20 or 25. They talked about supply constraints on the call but didn't really explain what they were, at least not that I could see. Lastly, the major cloud providers are going gangbusters so I'm not sure why they wouldn't be seeing revenue growth. The chip suppliers to those companies are seeing great growth."
Arista Networks reached an all time high at 401.10
Arista Networks is up 4.91% to 404.99
"We are going to trade off of Cisco earnings this afternoon. I’m wishing Cisco much luck in their report. If it shows weakness, ANET will drop fairly hard and vice versa."
"I wish I had money to buy this, but I do not. This company is either going to be bought or will double in value in a few years time. They have not gotten into the foreign markets much yet, but they will, and when they do they will be 2 or 3 times more in value and price. Cisco is too large and not as nimble to provide services specific to customers. Cisco demands customers who fit into what they can do. ANET manuevers its services via software to meet needs specific to each customer. Sort of like offering colors that that are not all black."
"nothing changed here ... ANET business remains strong. Multiple catalysts: 1) Cloud Titans, certifications complete, spend resumes 2) MSFT, the all Arista Azure network is high growth and become pillar of MSFT strategy 3) Enterprise customers, carried ANET last qtr given Cloud deferrals, huge 4) INTL - pure upside 5) routing - stage #2 of the rocket, lit and firing 6) EOS - secret sauce & why white-box becomes non-issue 7) Cisco litigation - essentially game over, workarounds complete, awaiting final affirmation from courts (notice Cisco no longer trumps this issue?) 8) Cisco competition - sure if you count giving away business to keep a logo, but winning on the basis of product? they cannot beat the 7500R or EOS ... do you own due diligence, ANET remains one of tech's hottest stories albeit in the pole position in the paradigm-changing Cloud business good luck"
Any thoughs?Earning Report (01:30 PM PT) and Analyst Day (Cloud Innovators and Thought Leaders) (03:00 PM PT) will be held at same day.Bad earning report?
I can't understand what big guys wants from $ANET they beat the estimates one quarter after another and each time there is sell-off game after. Could someone explain what is going on here?
"good earnings, revenue and year over year increase why the decline"
"ANET is heading towards $300. Yes, get it while you can. I added more."
"MSFT released numbers last night, Azure (all-ANET) public network continues to grow. Expect resurgence in Capex spend with ANET in 2nd half, tracking up in pre-market as a result."
"They said tariffs won't effect them. They said Facebook and Microsoft are both building out data centers, where 6-7% of the capital expenditures for the data centers (cap exp) toward their network products. As they own the 100GB space, they expect to maintain their competitive position. The overall cap exp grew 27% in the 1st quarter and MSFT and Facebook are in normal growth mode right now. Given both of them reported continued strong growth of their online services this month, should be strong growth through next year, IMO."
