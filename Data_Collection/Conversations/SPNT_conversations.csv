"Book value at Q1 2020 was $13.05. April-May performance was +4.5%. Both equity and credit markets have been flying in June, so the book value is probably around $14.5 now. At $7.40, it's almost at a -50% discount to book value. Dan Loeb should raise money and liquidate this thing."

Overall I think we will see upside for TPRE in the short-term. Perhaps a pullback next day or so could occur I suppose but are yall also seeing a further leg higher? Im not sure about you guys but awesome-STOCKS has provided me with some pretty good trade ideas. I messed up executing some of them but thats on me.

"Mr . Loeb ... free stock advice , buy in TPRE stock as it trades at a discount to your nav by a wide margin"
I have this worth about $33 per share using DCF Model. As long as they continue their revenue growth. Thus far after Q1 results they are ahead of their projection. Good margin of safety if you look at the current book value of 16.39 per share and a P/V of .59. I will update after next quarter results.
