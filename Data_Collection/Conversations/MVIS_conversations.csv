KATHIE WOOD IS BUYING 5.5 MILLION SHARES OF MICROVISION.
"When this contract, collaboration, joint venture, whatever you wanna call it gets announced this is gonna bounce fast and hard. Big funds are accumulating. They know !"
Tell us why Ford and Volkswagen invested in Argo and not MVIS if MVIS's technology is the best. Tell us why Argo bought Princeton Lightwave instead of MVIS who had begged to be bought for years.. all or part..if MVIS's tech is the best. No insults if you're cap...just intelligent discussion.
"For the MicroVision everyday is business as usual. We aren’t worried, if autonomous driving with lidar is the future- we will certainly are on the frontier of this, just remember investing in apple when the first iPhone came out. We are probably at that stage now. But our technology is inside Microsoft already. I expect a huge move in stock price to the upside. Get it and forget it. Or stay and watch."
"Weve seen more lying on this board than at a Biden / Harris town hall meeting !!!!! Seriously folks , its not that hard -- either ya like the gamble of the stock or ya dont ( stock market is a gamble ) !!! However there are lots of us old longs that have been here since below a buck and we have seen lots of changes .. Biggist one i see is that tutes are buying this up by the boat loads , sooo ill keep gambling to the going higher side of things !!! Bashers on here are simply trying to get your shares on the cheap or they are working as paid bashers because of a short position !! Lets see what comes out of the Germany meeting ,, if we see a working lidar demo we should see a bullish run for sure !!! If not , it could be awhile for earning to kick in from the sale of lidar units .. But i just cant think of a better bunch of folks to gamble on #$%$ is top notch genius !!! His backups and board members are bad either !!!"
I feel so sorry for all the high pie in the sky wannabe. You will lose I have been there and know. If you are Interested in the Stock Market buy something established and reputable. It's a one in a million chance for a stock like this to work out. Ya like those odds? Then I can't help you .

"Self-driving vehicles may be loaded with sensors and artificial intelligence, but they're limited without a really good map.Why it matters: High-definition maps are critical to the safe, wide-scale deployment of autonomous vehicles. More accurate than satellite-based GPS, they provide richly detailed models of the operating environment and important context to help AVs avoid mistakes.Driving the news: A Tesla owner tweeted a video clip recently showing how his car's Autopilot system mistook a low-hanging moon for a yellow traffic light and kept telling the car to slow down.While Tesla did not publicly address the reasons for the error, industry experts suggest Tesla's camera-based system was lacking important context. ""Even though a traffic light and the moon may resemble each other, a self-driving system should use a combination of contextual cues — including spatial, temporal and prior knowledge — to tell them apart,"" Deva Ramanan, principal scientist at self-driving tech competitor Argo AI explains in a blog post. """"""""An HD map —"""""" along with redundant sensors like radar and"""""" lidar """"""— can provide that missing context, Gartner Group mobility analyst Michael Ramsey tells Axios."""""""" ""It would know where there are traffic lights. The moon is not a yellow light because there are no traffic lights in this area,"" he said."
This UBANI Zero has nothing else in his life but to post on our board.He is no significant person so no one pays attention to his blabbering !!!!!!!!
Musk tweeted out Monday the latest versions of Tesla’s (ticker: TSLA) full self driving software–the best version of his company’s driver assistance features–is “actually not great.”
"Time after time Telsa's camera only autopilot system fails. LIDAR is required!George Brian McGee, a finance executive in Florida, was driving home in a Tesla Model S operating on Autopilot, a system that can steer, brake and accelerate a car on its own, when he dropped his phone during a call and bent down to look for it.Neither he nor Autopilot noticed that the road was ending and the Model S drove past a stop sign and a flashing red light. The car smashed into a parked Chevrolet Tahoe, killing a 22-year-old college student, Naibel Benavides.One of a growing number of fatal accidents involving Tesla cars operating on Autopilot, McGee’s case is unusual because he survived and told investigators what had happened: He got distracted and put his trust in a system that did not see and brake for a parked car in front of it. Tesla drivers using Autopilot in other fatal accidents have often been killed, leaving investigators to piece together the details from data stored and videos recorded by the cars."

Let’s buy more shares in MVIS before Cathie Wood starts buying our shares. I just just heard that she is selling two huge winners like NVIDIA ICE and 8 others to make some room for some innovative technology stocks like shares in our company’s technology. We are definitely one of those companies. Let’s see what happens with our stock price once she puts her cash into it. That’s when we could really retire early.
When will MVIS reach $20:September?October?November?December?
"IMO Tesla will have to incorporate use of LIDAR!The US federal agency in charge of road safety is opening an official investigation into Tesla's ""self-driving"" Autopilot system.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said it was acting following 11 Tesla crashes since 2018 involving emergency vehicles.In some cases, the Tesla vehicles ""crashed directly into the vehicles of first responders"", it said.The investigation will cover roughly 765,000 Tesla cars made since 2014.That includes those in the Model Y, Model X, Model S and Model 3, the NHTSA said - the entire current range.'Control at all times'The agency was primarily concerned with an apparent inability of Tesla vehicles to cope with vehicles stopped in the road - specifically emergency vehicles attending an incident."
For Jeron008 who isn’t good at math if this is at $50 we are at roughly 8.5 bill market cap. Still peanuts
"Holly Sh... Reported Institutional Holdings increased from 21.05% on 8/6 to 23.68% on 8/12, then to 27.29% on 8/14. Major Institutional firms are Vanguard, Blackrock, Fidelity, JPMorgan, GoldmanBlackrock bought 6.5M shares recently at average price above $17.50."
They need a big space cause they got nothing to sell.
MicroVision shared PR on social media platforms of their lidar’s moving platform testing at a third party track.
"A Tesla in Autopilot mode hit a Florida trooper's cruiser, the latest incident in which the electric car has crashed into an emergency vehicleSat, August 28, 2021, 2:13 PM"
$22 - $28 this week !
Tomorrow we will be squeezing close to 20mil shares. I think it wiIll be good for the longs to start believing again
MVIS granted Patent compensation for laser light source misalignment in a multiple laser scanning TOF sensor system. 8/17/21 BZ news wire.
SEC is arresting those who were manipulating the market by selling short without the proper paperwork. Buying back fast and selling short again before the price settled. It’s illegal now. New rules are in effect across the board. Almost every stock will benefit from this. MVIS will keep on squeezing till we are above $30
"Mavis is hovering right on the 200MA line at the moment. It has not broken beneath this line since it was under $1 per share. Technicals are pointing for a major uptrend this week and through September. Next resistance break is $18.19, followed by $24 ish."
"Just muted Ubani, another blabbering short with nothing substantive to share. Instant gratification as it cleared up the board immediately."
Elon & company still does not like or want LIDAR...A new tech is coming soon and much better than LIDAR...MVIS is a sinking ship...
MAVIS just managed to complete a very rare technical Golden Cross.That's a bullish pattern right?OH No my mistake it was Longs getting a Golden Shower!
"Actually we are doing just fine on the down day. You can always sell some out of the money call options to buy more shares. Free money for those who is going to hold this stock for years. Enjoy free stock in MVIS without ever selling it. This is what many hedge funds do. Buy shares and then sell out of the money long term leaps. When the stock price drops, they buy the calls back. Stock goes up - they sell more calls. And buy more shares of stock. This is how to become very successful in MicroVision. With time you become very good at it. Right now $42 January 2023 calls you could sell for over $300 . If you own 1000 shares, and sell all 10 calls that’s $3000 money in your pocket, and no matter what happens with the stock price later, you will still make a lot of cash and you will also lock your entire investment from short sellers till January 20, 2023. Dont thank me, it’s just an idea. And if you have 7k shares like many of us do, thats $21k in instant income. So take it easy and relax. Go to the beach with your friends and be cool. I’ll see you tomorrow. Happy trading."
One of the Best Technicians in the Business Carters WorthAlot said today the Chart of MAVIS is basically Toast.
Huge contract is about to happen in the 3rd quarter. Buy more shares and hold during the great news.
Tomorrow we will be trading above $16. No shares to short and it looks like the bulls are taking this above $17 by Friday. Good luck to all longs GLTAL
Hey wasn't this stock over $25 not to long ago?
"MVIS removes photo due to incorrect data..... And when is 35mph ""highway speeds""...TYPICAL MVIS blunders...nothing changes...https://stocktwits.com/wwtech/message/373143073 [having trouble uploading images here so posting the link to my post on ST where the image lives]EDIT: Just talked to Dave about the distances on the photo appearing incorrect. His response...""The company collected a lot of data over several days; they will update the photo to the correlated data. The team is working incredibly hard toward presenting at the upcoming IAA Mobility show, and will do better at aligning engineering and marketing."" -DA"
