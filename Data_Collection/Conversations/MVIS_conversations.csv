"LOOKS GOOD FOR SHORTS,,,AGAIN"
But then we all knew he was a Horses A.Hey May be we could inject Clorox Bleach from the inside. Watta you think Doc?
Once gain and for the record...MVIS has nothing special going for them..Nothing has changed since sub $1.00...NOTHING...
"Weve seen more lying on this board than at a Biden / Harris town hall meeting !!!!! Seriously folks , its not that hard -- either ya like the gamble of the stock or ya dont ( stock market is a gamble ) !!! However there are lots of us old longs that have been here since below a buck and we have seen lots of changes .. Biggist one i see is that tutes are buying this up by the boat loads , sooo ill keep gambling to the going higher side of things !!! Bashers on here are simply trying to get your shares on the cheap or they are working as paid bashers because of a short position !! Lets see what comes out of the Germany meeting ,, if we see a working lidar demo we should see a bullish run for sure !!! If not , it could be awhile for earning to kick in from the sale of lidar units .. But i just cant think of a better bunch of folks to gamble on #$%$ is top notch genius !!! His backups and board members are bad either !!!"
When is the ER and what’s the effect of Microsoft military AR headsets contract on MVIS ER? Anyone can share some thoughts?
"Its gonna blow, MVIS to the moon....not"
The market is at a very dangerous point - see what just happened to SESN..Will MVIS be next?
Cheapest long call option I ever bought
"No worries, things will get better when Kam takes over soon...Oh God.."
"Actually we are doing just fine on the down day. You can always sell some out of the money call options to buy more shares. Free money for those who is going to hold this stock for years. Enjoy free stock in MVIS without ever selling it. This is what many hedge funds do. Buy shares and then sell out of the money long term leaps. When the stock price drops, they buy the calls back. Stock goes up - they sell more calls. And buy more shares of stock. This is how to become very successful in MicroVision. With time you become very good at it. Right now $42 January 2023 calls you could sell for over $300 . If you own 1000 shares, and sell all 10 calls that’s $3000 money in your pocket, and no matter what happens with the stock price later, you will still make a lot of cash and you will also lock your entire investment from short sellers till January 20, 2023. Dont thank me, it’s just an idea. And if you have 7k shares like many of us do, thats $21k in instant income. So take it easy and relax. Go to the beach with your friends and be cool. I’ll see you tomorrow. Happy trading."
"possibly, but there is a good chance it will sink sub $10 and or just be absorbed for close to book value. As you know competition is fierce in this genre and MVIS is not anywhere close to being the leader, yes MVIS has many passe patents but nothing that is a hot ticket. Earnings are zilch and as far as opening an office in Germany...well everyone is trying to get a piece of the action there. Unless a fat contract happens for MVIS we feel that the hype is over and all within the industry see where this is going..."
"MVIS LIDAR sensors have other interesting applications investors seem to like. The company’s PicoP scanning technology is currently being used in various high-tech products, spanning everything from portable projectors to augmented reality. These are high-growth areas investors are right to be focusing in on. with 18% short float we have a the prefect storm is the works HODLAnother catalyst investors have pointed to as a reason to own Microvision is the company’s recent inclusion in the Russell 3000 Index. More capital flows into any stock is a good thing. Indeed, MVIS investors are hopeful these capital inflows from institutional investors will bolster already bullish buying from the retail crowd."
bought the dip at the same levels for the 3rd time this year looking to sell at 25.00 in 3 weeks.
"They have nothing special in a highly competitive sector,, been 4 sale for 2 years and for sub $1.00, pennies book value, only at this level bcause of its meme status, sub $10 on the horizon but $12s today..Sinking ship indeed..."
Cmon baby boxcars coming..yo 12..
13 13 13told u so..
Just read an interesting article on how the next Apple may be heading to include Lidar as a standard feature for distance and frame scanning of objects........hmmm......is there a link to some of the rumors??
In my Country we call This The stock market is a Rigged.
"Mavis is hovering right on the 200MA line at the moment. It has not broken beneath this line since it was under $1 per share. Technicals are pointing for a major uptrend this week and through September. Next resistance break is $18.19, followed by $24 ish."
"IMO Tesla will have to incorporate use of LIDAR!The US federal agency in charge of road safety is opening an official investigation into Tesla's ""self-driving"" Autopilot system.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said it was acting following 11 Tesla crashes since 2018 involving emergency vehicles.In some cases, the Tesla vehicles ""crashed directly into the vehicles of first responders"", it said.The investigation will cover roughly 765,000 Tesla cars made since 2014.That includes those in the Model Y, Model X, Model S and Model 3, the NHTSA said - the entire current range.'Control at all times'The agency was primarily concerned with an apparent inability of Tesla vehicles to cope with vehicles stopped in the road - specifically emergency vehicles attending an incident."
Just bought another 200 shares with total shares exactly 7000 shares in all of my portfolios combined.
My question -- what if it is bosch instead of a larger auto co ?? Would that mean less in lidar sales or more ? Since Bosch supplies many diff things to many diff auto companies this might get really interesting in a hurry !! Partnership or buyout either one equals a bunch of bucks in the coffers !!!!!!
My Doctor said If the Ex-Dope didn't take the Liver micen he wouldn't have looked like a Zombie up on that Balcony figgiting wit his jacket!
"Whenever you see a board full of bears, thats a good good sign. I took advantage of that same situation this past Friday on $hood. It always pays, always! "
"The company detailed its current generation self-driving computer that works with all existing Tesla vehicles. Once the software is ready, it will enable all Teslas to drive autonomously with their existing sensor set — at least that’s what the company says — and that sensor set doesn’t include lidar. Instead, the sensors inside Tesla vehicles lean on a neural network that’s trained by data collected by all Tesla vehicles."
KATHIE WOOD IS BUYING 5.5 MILLION SHARES OF MICROVISION.
WHY ARE WE NUMBER 11 IN HEALTH CARE BETWEEN TOP 15 ADVANCED CAPITALIST COUNTRIES??AND MOST EXPENSIVE?IRAEL HAS EXCELLENT UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE AND IT WORKS GREAT.
Wait for Tommorow When the Market Opens !!Most of the MVIS Share Holders Cant Buy Pre And Post Hours...This Will.Be Going Above $ 16 ...
"Although not being used yet for EVs, 3D scanners/projectors are on the threshold of being introduced and are far superior and economical than lidar, TSLA is on it folks. Elon is an alien.."
MVIS joints Walmart -rolling back prices
"I want to buy this, but not sure whether to wait for a bit of a drop? What major news is possibly coming up?"
Look of the shorts in the next 2 weeks !! lol
"Many of us know lidar is essential in AI household appliances and autopilot. All lidar companies say they have the best lidar. Until more evidence of revenue, this baby can hardly go back up to $30s."
"Those who wanted to sell, sold already, the rest of us sticking to our plan and hold on to our shares till the big news will pop out. Selling at this point is not a very smart investment decision. GLTAL"
12s
"Tesla also said that beginning with deliveries this month, the Model 3 and Model Y vehicles built for the North American market will no longer be equipped with radar and will instead feature a camera-based Autopilot system.The vehicles will initially lose some functionality due to the lack of radar, but this will be restored through future software updates, Tesla said."
"MVIS's MO is to not discuss earning during an earning report, but instead discuss all the great things that could happen and what amazing things they've been doing, and how they might have some interested parties someday b/c the stuff they have is great. So, drum roll......will it work for the umpteenth time tomorrow???? No reason for it not to - loads of people bought the con multiple times in the recent past. But, if it doesn't work for them this time, look for the 10's, shortly."
Someone took profit just now. It happens. But they would probably buy back most of their shares which will drive the price much higher and then the short squeeze will definitely happen. Relax people. We are together to weather out the storm. A little dumpski isn’t the end of the world just yet. Many contracts will expire in the money which will probably go into buying shares by Friday.
I got in today at 12.85 I feel the wind is heading upstream.
"After knowing about MicroVision and Microsoft the bears are still holding the short position and will slowly burn all their money instead of just loosing some and go ahead and cover now, or cover in 6 month at $36 plus."
james? Martin? James?
Yesterday drop was tricky. It was preparing for todays jump. All the scare cats jump ship. Thanks for your shares at 13.50. My wallet feels good.
MVIS is DOWN 8.5% from today's high.dripdripdripSo who SOLD today at $15.14?Now be honest!!!!!!
"""The feedback we've received from potential customers so far has been very positive""MVIS language for NO INTEREST IN BUYING or PARTNERSHIPS....like all their other attempts at selling products..."
"A hint for all the Lemings looking in. Has to do wit the Full Moon, UrAnus, Dental Work, & of course the Unvaccinated Ignoramus."
To all those that said mvis wasnt in microsoft army thingy -- WRONG!!! Toall those that think mvis Lidar isnt going to be huge - WRONG AGAIN !!! This co is going to either go it alone and make billions or get bought out at a much higher pps --- when i have no idea -- im no expert but i am a very happy long with a belief in our ceo and huge team of experts in this field of fun lil tecky gadgets !! Cant see how anyone that listened to that last EC could be anything but excited to be long this stk !! It was great !!
Why are analysts dropping coverage on MVIS?
"The Technical term for a stock like this is ""A Big Stinker"""
"The smell of desperate short shills is getting really strong in the past couple days. Could it be the tutes. or the approach of the big show in Germany, or are they doing some due diligence and finding out what's going on?"
Looks like The Market will end Down at the Close. Internals very Weak.
"Like I said, 12s are here...Onward to sub $10s.."
IAA Mobility Conference is coming soon
"If the known MSFT news was such a big deal, it kinda makes you wonder why its not reflected in MVIS share price.."
"Ivan, Ivan we need you your cousin Ubani has escaped his cage again, call the Commissar"
Mvis is the future. This stock is going to be a real blessing for longs. Mho

It’s about to pop!!!!!
We all know that the short squeeze is definitely coming soon. How soon? It’s very hard to predict. Some of us are buying but most of us are just holding and waiting for some great news from the management of this company. Is it the wrong strategy? Playing scared is simply the wrong strategy . I know that we will go up. The question is when? I’m loaded with shares and hopefully by the end of this month we will probably go up 10 points or so. But time is running out to buy this stock at those prices . Good luck to all longs GLTAL
Im sure all you loyal yahoo readers are also keeping up on reddit ---- if not go take a read --- waymo to stop making lidar and maybe going a diff direction !!! SS come from goggle ( duh ) -- possible -- i dont know but if it were to come to pass soooo will the tripple digit pps -- just a dream ? dunno
Tomorrow we will be trading above $16. No shares to short and it looks like the bulls are taking this above $17 by Friday. Good luck to all longs GLTAL
Back to $20 very soon!

"""No comment"" when asked to elaborate on MVIS in Hololens2... What is in Hololens2? Their NOT they're mems? Their NOT they're software? Drivers? What SPECIFICALLY?? And what did that prepaid $10 million pre paid deal require MSFT to do? Now back to NDAs....wondering why MSFT stated ""It's our IP and we designed it"" when asked point blank in a public discussion is MVIS technology inside Hololens2 and Digilens' founder telling me at Stanford University ""I know MVIS'S not inside Hololens2"""
I like these message boards but there seems to be a couple of strange characters on this one. How would you call them. k ooks.
"As much as I hate to admit it. Lets be courtesy to James. After all, he got me the 12 dollar deal. Lets see what tomorrow holds."
"Whomever purchased that huge block after hours, much appreciated!"
Just got some extra shares on sale for $14.27-14.31. I believe that this gave a nice push for MVIS to start moving up.
And on lidar sector - institutions reported that they own 30.41 percent of MicroVision stock and 27.44% of LOZR . And this is just a beautiful beginning. Boomski to the moonski
I don’t know how I ever traded without using (http://Pick-stocks.com)! I look forward to their daily emails each morning that list pre-market movers based on thoroughly researched stock market and world news. I highly recommend anyone who invests in the stock market!

Who is that mo ro n SerPrano?
"2 years still for sale, why would MFST be interested now versus when it was a dollar..Because they are not interested...DUH DUH"
Elon & company still does not like or want LIDAR...A new tech is coming soon and much better than LIDAR...MVIS is a sinking ship...
The stock market gives to them that dare to buy when the herd mentality of shorts and weaker hands give us opportunities; it’s not easy to just hold and add on weakness for long periods of time. that’s what it takes sometimes.

Never get above $15 today. Too many call options at that strike price.

"HUGE IMPACTS from ANNOUNCING MICROVISION is in MICROSOFT’S HOLOLENS 2Sumit eviscerated any doubt about Microvision being in Microsoft’s Hololens 2, which a $22 Billion military contract is based on. This validates Microvision on many levels: 1. Microvision’s advanced A/R technology has passed the most rigorous testing (military combat testing in all types of conditions imaginable) and is literally saving lives. 2. Microvision is in a product that is in a huge market that is only going to grow. 3. Microvision has the technology and engineering capabilities to create, enhance, and support such products. 4. The fact that there is great value in Microvision’s A/R vertical is now a given. 5. Microvision’s Lidar is based on its previously proven technologies, giving all potential customers much greater confidence in their ability to bring their Lidar products to fruition. 6. Microvision demonstrated and was selected by the military as having the most advanced A/R technology and ability to satisfy all their requirements. 7. The credibility of the management, and especially CEO Sumit Sharma, is outstanding. With Microvision having the best A/R that is used in the most sensitive military application, and with every promise that Sumit has made coming to fruition, it can only instill great confidence in the amazing Lidar specifications that Sumit has shared as well as his claims of Microvision’s Lidar being Best in Class, at a cost that makes it commercially viable, and at a size that is appealing and unobtrusive.As a Microvision shareholder, I am totally stoked and so looking forward to the events about to unfold over the coming months that will create immense value and a greatly increased share price."
I always enjoy adding a few bargin shares -- the show in Germany is looming on the short bashers and the tutes are accumulating right along the side of us retail longs !! Our great team at MVIS has a great CEO leading them and i personally cant wait to see the vids hit the airwaves outta Germany !! We will have a nice surprise for you shorts soon !!
For Jeron008 who isn’t good at math if this is at $50 we are at roughly 8.5 bill market cap. Still peanuts
$16.00 by eod..
Easy $20 coming
"Oh, here is a good one!Sharma, ""Unfortunately, such clarity on relevant specifications is not available from our competitors. Since providing incomplete comparison charts would not be constructive and could be misleading, we will instead periodically release updates from our track testing program and other validation efforts........""Bwahahaha. Not available from their competitors???? There IS NO STANDARD measurement methods - YET (no doubt will be in the future), so NO auto lidar device available anywhere has a way to ""compare"" their products' functionality to ANY other such device in any meaningful way. Sharma knows that actual ""potential customers"" are fully aware of that, his babble is designed to target investors with covid checks, not someone in the industry."
"BUY BUY BUY you lemmings, MVIS to the moon with awesome earnings and future potential. MVIS the leader in lidar tech...lolol"
we might see under $10 by Friday
Tomorrow we will be squeezing close to 20mil shares. I think it wiIll be good for the longs to start believing again
Bought Another 2000 Shares. One of My Friend Works in the Company and BELIEVES TO Have a Great Earning Call .!!
"All those who think today’s PR and German office opening are just fluff, can exit now! I for one, just added some shares."
This stock is the ANDR of the times. Noise Cancellation Technology. Every large tech company and their Uncles were going to be customers. Was a $30 stock. Were is it now? .03
SEC is arresting those who were manipulating the market by selling short without the proper paperwork. Buying back fast and selling short again before the price settled. It’s illegal now. New rules are in effect across the board. Almost every stock will benefit from this. MVIS will keep on squeezing till we are above $30
"Real bulls don’t sell! Ever! We hold this stock forever and grow by selling out of reach calls and buying more shares when the stock dips. This way we end up with many thousands of shares. Who cares if the price goes to $26- we sell calls and pocket the money and buy more shares. And maybe after a while when buyout will happen and it will happen, we can make millions of dollars and finally get what we have always wanted. A simple and happy life full of joy."

This UBANI (Zero) is trying again to discourage stockholders. We don't need your 2 cents advice.You know nothing about the company but you say you want to inform us. HA HA HA.Stop posting on this board. If you don't have shares in MVIS why are you here.
Should drop as earnings off and EV all hype losing steam across multiple stocks.Waiting on 8 to 9 range to buy back in. Sold at 16 and then 13. Been waiting to buy back in. Probably be a good chance after drop tomorrow.
If for every share of MicroVision you would get one share of Microsoft- wouldn’t you take that deal? Get ready! It might be happening.
This is about to get real! Probably the most over looked company in the field. MVIS technologies will be soon available in at least 3 markets. Hold strong and all will rewarded soon.
"Shelf offering coming, Germany is expensive venture with all the competition there..."
I am pretty sure $10s by Friday..
up up up today. Mark my words!!!
Cup and handle
"Its far from over, institutions upgrading to buy, large institutional ownership, number of employees in company growing, massive contract with US military that shot up our SP 50% or so in about 20 minutes, I can go on and on. And the bear case here is ""they have no revenue, and no buyout"" deals will be made its just a matter of time. Personally I am very bullish on this stock. Still so much up in the air, which equals large potential for the stock price to jump. And as for the range quoted below me ""17c a year ago"" you can take any stock from a year ago at its absolute minimum to smear."
And once again we have the same guys coming out posting that this move will make us all big bucks. If this was true why are we seeing red and dropping. In my opinion I have a feeling no one trusts them anymore on their moves. People now want too see actual proof and not just talk.
This UBANI Zero has nothing else in his life but to post on our board.He is no significant person so no one pays attention to his blabbering !!!!!!!!

13s COMING...lolol
"Kathie Woods even agrees with me, Lidar is not the way for autonomous vehicles.Tesla has recently switched to strictly cameras and stopped using radar sensors. Musk has said that camera-based vision is more accurate than radar, and radar introduces more noise than helpful data in a sensor fusion system.In January, Musk said that even if the cost of lidar sensors dropped to zero, Tesla would not utilize them."
this is the end of the road for MVIS happy days are gone. save yourself
I bought 30 puts at 15.5 for next week. Hope it drops a little Monday so I can cash out. Good luck all
Yahoo says 8 days before earnings results. And how did worthless Yahoo and their Yafools come to that conclusion? Wild guess as there's been no OFFICIAL news release BY MVIS. Earnings release can be anywhere from today through August 14.... the 45 day SEC rule for reporting earnings.

I’m long term on MVIS and believe this company is starting to come into its own but I see the trend miss Mavis has and will dabble on the puts as well"
"When we are about to close in the green on a red day, could only mean one thing for sure: the bears are in deeper trouble than they thought and we are about to squeeze them even tighter. Good reason to buy even more shares and quick"

Yeh tbats right MSFT buys MVIS...MVIS to $100.00 easy..Buy now or regret it later..
Tell us why Ford and Volkswagen invested in Argo and not MVIS if MVIS's technology is the best. Tell us why Argo bought Princeton Lightwave instead of MVIS who had begged to be bought for years.. all or part..if MVIS's tech is the best. No insults if you're cap...just intelligent discussion.
Hey wasn't this stock over $25 not to long ago?
"MicroVision (NASDAQ: MVIS) stock has jumped 860% in the past year and is currently one of the most talked-about companies on WallStreetBets. The lidar sensor creator is used by motor companies and is one of the top-performing tech stocks this year because of the interest from social media investors. With the company’s relatively small market cap of $2.5 billion coupled with its high short interest level of 18%, MicroVision has the perfect recipe for a squeeze.There is a long-term opportunity for MicroVision investors, as some experts believe the high-tech LIDAR builder could become a big player in the highly lucrative automotive space."
"After listening to the recent CC again, it sounded to me like Microvision is putting three capabilities on one chip and depending on what you pay for, lol Tesla, they enable the function you bought. Which provides all kinds of cost savings across the board! Did anyone else interpret it the same way?"
"From the 10Q ....Additionally, securities of certain companies have recently experiencedsignificant and extreme volatility in stock price due to short sellersof shares of common stock, known as a “short squeeze.”These short squeezes have caused extreme volatility in both the stockprices of those companies and in the market, and have led to theprice per share of those companies to trade at a significantly inflatedrate that is disconnected from the underlying value of the company.Many investors who have purchased shares in those companies at aninflated rate face the risk of losing a significant portion of theiroriginal investment, as in many cases the price per share has declinedsteadily as interest in those stocks have abated. There can beno assurance that our shares will not be subject to a short squeeze inthe future, and investors may lose a significant portion or allof their investment if they purchase our shares at a rate that issignificantly disconnected from our underlying value."
"Business Axiom: In order to earn, you must create something and sell it."
The whole market is melting down. We are in the middle of all this. Would this roller coaster really can change our vision? I dYFI on’t think so. 2 of my other companies stocks have reported outstanding earnings in over 75% gain and the market still have those stocks down. It’s just another moment. I’m staying calm and not so worried about little things. It’s not the ER it’s the momentum. Trust your own judgment. MVIS will be huge. Just have to wait for it. The buyout is almost on the table.
"In 12 days we will be at $19-24 range before the news hits. And after special cash dividend is announced to every shareholder on file from a huge Royalty cash payout, we will go up again. Remember that cash is for us. Am I just dreaming? Maybe yes, but I don’t think so. Microsoft gets paid- we get paid! Maybe not on the same day, but we are getting ours, don’t forget about that."
MicroVision shared PR on social media platforms of their lidar’s moving platform testing at a third party track.
Two days until insignificant licensing fees will show MVIS ISN'T IN HOLOLENS2....as I have been saying for YEARS after talking to MSFT HOLOLENS2 engineers and Digilens founder who am said the same...
HE LOVES POORLY EDUCATED.
MVIS’ near-term prospects look bleak because it could take significant time for it to successfully market its lidar technology.
I don’t even care about a buyout mvis will be over 100$ one day
"Well, MVIS better really get their their hype machine up and running and come up w something good before it goes below 12. Their hype is always amusing. What will it be this time? ""Ahoy! We think we spotted a potential customer!!"""

Each company’s Board of Directors has approved the transaction.Headquartered with a pilot plant in Rochester, New York, Novomer develops high-performing, carbon-efficient, cost-effective polymers and chemicals, including poly(3-hydroxypropionate) (""p(3HP)""), a type of polyhydroxyalkanoate (""PHA""), all of which can be sourced from renewable or non-renewable feedstocks. Novomer leverages its proprietary Novo22 catalyst and intelligent process design to develop products in its pilot plant that can be produced at low costs. Novomer also has an extensive intellectual property portfolio with more than 100 issued patents and over 140 patents pending. Novomer has approximately 20 employees.Danimer believes that Novomer’s p(3HP) is highly complementary with Danimer’s inputs, and can be incorporated as a component in certain Danimer resins. Nodax, Danimer’s signature PHA, and Novomer’s p(3HP) have different properties and attributes: Nodax has strong performance and biodegradability properties, making it possible to be used across diverse end-use applications, while p(3HP) has improved barrier properties and is a lower cost non-fermented input. By incorporating Novomer’s p(3HP) into Danimer’s customer solutions, Danimer expects to have greater flexibility to meet an even broader range of customer needs, and also expects to be able to produce its resins at a substantially lower cost. Additionally, by blending these inputs, Danimer will reduce the amount of fermentation required in the production of its resins. Given these significant benefits, the Company expects to modify its previously announced greenfield construction plans for its new facility in Bainbridge, Georgia to include fewer fermenters and expand Novomer’s production capacity. This transaction and the resulting modifications are expected to meaningfully reduce Danimer’s planned capital expenditures on a per-pound basis while increasing the anticipated overall volume of finished product it will be able to deliver when also taking into account the completion of its Kentucky Phase II expansion."""
MVIS is a strong play at these prices. Don’t let paid bashers deter you. They want you to sell your shares at a discount so they can buy them cheap. Stay long and strong!
Man...this stock is getting a beat down from top to bottom. It can't seem to pass the 15 dollar mark.
"For the MicroVision everyday is business as usual. We aren’t worried, if autonomous driving with lidar is the future- we will certainly are on the frontier of this, just remember investing in apple when the first iPhone came out. We are probably at that stage now. But our technology is inside Microsoft already. I expect a huge move in stock price to the upside. Get it and forget it. Or stay and watch."

"Self-driving vehicles may be loaded with sensors and artificial intelligence, but they're limited without a really good map.Why it matters: High-definition maps are critical to the safe, wide-scale deployment of autonomous vehicles. More accurate than satellite-based GPS, they provide richly detailed models of the operating environment and important context to help AVs avoid mistakes.Driving the news: A Tesla owner tweeted a video clip recently showing how his car's Autopilot system mistook a low-hanging moon for a yellow traffic light and kept telling the car to slow down.While Tesla did not publicly address the reasons for the error, industry experts suggest Tesla's camera-based system was lacking important context. ""Even though a traffic light and the moon may resemble each other, a self-driving system should use a combination of contextual cues — including spatial, temporal and prior knowledge — to tell them apart,"" Deva Ramanan, principal scientist at self-driving tech competitor Argo AI explains in a blog post. """"""""An HD map —"""""" along with redundant sensors like radar and"""""" lidar """"""— can provide that missing context, Gartner Group mobility analyst Michael Ramsey tells Axios."""""""" ""It would know where there are traffic lights. The moon is not a yellow light because there are no traffic lights in this area,"" he said."
"it's impractical, unrealistic, and disingenuous to compare non related products, the size of a company, and the length of time a company exists. it is a non correlary because it has literally nothing to do with the sale of the A sample. they dont have the production infrastructure. they dont have the capital gor scalability. its not a turn key, and if it was why would you sell? the have the intellectual property rights to a multi billion patent. it has that value based off the reported data points. if you're saying its a lie, then you would have to show that the already created and tested A sample is some how fake... which would be a dope magic trick."
How many on here have went to the IAA website and looked around ? -- Turns out MVIS has a big space for this event !!!!! And this event is nothing short of huge !!! Hoping for good things to come out of this show !!

"So, all of their revenue came from 2017 nonrefundable prepayment, and until that exhausted (probably take at least another 6 quarters), that looks like their only future revenue. Meanwhile, by way of atm dilution, they've been able to spend oodles, make no other monies, and look for anyone that might be interested in their 3 yo lidar related patented tech. If it weren't for shorts, they'd be fairly valued, i.e., 1.50."

Let’s buy more shares in MVIS before Cathie Wood starts buying our shares. I just just heard that she is selling two huge winners like NVIDIA ICE and 8 others to make some room for some innovative technology stocks like shares in our company’s technology. We are definitely one of those companies. Let’s see what happens with our stock price once she puts her cash into it. That’s when we could really retire early.
"Why are they awarding millions of dollars of stock, if no tangible news has been achieved (i.e. absolutely no PRs)"

"If i were short MVIS i would be on here bashing away too !! The strength of the pps in the last few weeks is obvious to most of us !! There are many more bullish than there are bearish here .. Take a read on reddit sometime !! The IAA show coming up may very well be the death of most shorts !! For myself im in this stock because i believe in our leadership .. SS is a genius ( hands down ) , he has the connections to do big things and has some of the best people in the world on his team now !! You dont just drop by the unemployment office and pickup this kind of talent ,lol .. This co is exactly what a small co looks like before going huge !! The MSFT deal dint hurt either --- how many years did we listen to the shorts say there was no way mvis was in the military gadget ?? They were dead wrong !!!! All this type tecky stuff is our future like it or not , we will be seeing self driving cars in the near future ( i firmly believe that ) .. Lidar is going to play a huge role in that as well as many ,many other things in our future . Since we have a great one i see the payoff being huge !!! Old retired and just playing here -- have time --- will remain long !!"
"Royalties are revenues. We should see a rise from Microsoft due to IVAS when q3 2021 reports. MVIS patents have value. I own antiques and they have value and no revenues. A gold bar has value and no revenues. Plus , MVS has the best LIDAR. It will be shown off at an industry event this fall. Reddit MVIS has many conversations about this."
CEO just clearly stated Microvision’s engine in Microsoft Hololens!!!
I guess even the Reddit crowd or meme stock whatever can’t help push this stock anymore

I project that the AR technology will be sold to Microsoft within 3 months and the stock will double in value.
Terrible volumn.Which means this stock ain't going anywhere soon.
Monday could bee the largest point Down day in U.S. History. According to my Proprietary Work!!!
"MVIS generated significant returns earlier this year due primarily to the Redditors’ interest in it. However, as the social media hype regarding the stock continues to wane, it could witness a further decline. Therefore, we think the stock is best avoided now.MVIS shares rose $0.14 (+0.88%) in premarket trading Tuesday. Year-to-date, MVIS has gained 196.47%, versus a 19.10% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period."
"If its hikes to $15, the company would sell more shares to dilute the price back to 12."
"If I were a computer wiz i think i would be looking at mvis for employment opps -- there are a bunch of jobs available on their website .. Looks to me like SS may be just planning on expanding a bunch and going into big time production of this lidar stuff !! With a cpl hundred million in the kitty he can do that !! I long and getting longer by the week !! We have a bit to go but i think the payday is coming faster than alot of the bashers think .. Shorts will be in deep when news hits , possibly at next quarterly call !!!"
Yesterday the stock was DOWN 3.48%.Listen carefully...dripdripdrip
I hope everyone holds and push the pps through the roof
A variation of Medved technology will replace lidar and is imminent..As stated by oracles Musk and Branson etc.
Lots of opinions on this stk after next earnings --- im personally not expecting big blowout earnings but if it happens to be even so-so it may make this bounce again .. Either way im long until buyout or merger so it really makes no big deal to me either way -- you day traders and trade away -- good luck -- ill stay long ! I am very interested in this Germany lidar thing going on tho and hope we at least hear whats going on there with the new hire and new office being opened over there .. Growing !!!!

Finally holding above 8k shares of MicroVision stock. I’ve heard someone told me that the car production has been delayed because of many car manufacturers are actually waiting for lidar companies show the world what exactly they’re working on. So far MicroVision has the most impressive lidar ever made according to many car makers who have their contracts pending with other lidar companies ( he wouldn’t name names) . So let’s keep our fingers crossed and hope for the huge news to become public before the 3rd quarter ER.
Everyone is calling MicroVision a clear leader in lidar technology. I’m so glad that I’ve bought more shares of MVIS. It’s just a matter of time before we will revisit $25 price per share again

They had some interesting insights about MVIS on (http://Rightpicker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"I’m still hoping that ARKK will load up on MVIS. Just because she owns a load of Tesla, doesn’t mean that her highness buy a billion dollars worth of MVIS to make her portfolio perfectly aligned with the reality. Take a look at black Rock, their portfolio did great because of owning MVIS shares. Just by selling calls and buying puts when needed, they’ve made an absolute killing."

"This is a pretty volatile holding here. Bought in at about $2.5 and watched as it went to $28. Watched as it fell to $12, back to $18. It needs to find its own level.

"The bears are saying that Microsoft is priced in, lol. That was last year’s opinion. And now when we are waiting for billions in royalties it’s a different kind of animal altogether. Now with the news wide in the open- we are huge. And our shares are just trading like that because of the paper hands. It should be worth 5 times as much by the next ER."
It’s not looking good for me too hold this until year end. And don’t listen to the guys saying I bought more at the dip. No they didn’t. Lol
"Uh oh, seems like SP is dropping a bit. What should I do.? Does a price drop mean bad news?"

Just read on Reddit about the India’s chief for his army is checking out Microsoft/MicroVision IVAS for 5 days. This could definitely effect MicroVision’s stock price if they get the contract for our parts.

"Time after time Telsa's camera only autopilot system fails. LIDAR is required!George Brian McGee, a finance executive in Florida, was driving home in a Tesla Model S operating on Autopilot, a system that can steer, brake and accelerate a car on its own, when he dropped his phone during a call and bent down to look for it.Neither he nor Autopilot noticed that the road was ending and the Model S drove past a stop sign and a flashing red light. The car smashed into a parked Chevrolet Tahoe, killing a 22-year-old college student, Naibel Benavides.One of a growing number of fatal accidents involving Tesla cars operating on Autopilot, McGee’s case is unusual because he survived and told investigators what had happened: He got distracted and put his trust in a system that did not see and brake for a parked car in front of it. Tesla drivers using Autopilot in other fatal accidents have often been killed, leaving investigators to piece together the details from data stored and videos recorded by the cars."
