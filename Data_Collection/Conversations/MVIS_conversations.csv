"Sumit spoke of Microvision ACICS software development for:Automotive systems have been growing exponentially and trends like autonomous driving, predictive maintenance, v2x connectivity, OTA updates, and vehicle electrification are a prime focus for OEMs and their customers. The use cases introduced by these trends are transforming the technological experiences across automotive subsystems.While the classic AUTOSAR platform helped OEMs and their suppliers with standardized software platform by establishing common ECU software architecture, increased reuse, and unified language methodology, it also faced limitations to support complex, powerful, and flexible E/E architecture required for next-gen automotive trends.The AUTOSAR adaptive platform, on the other hand, is scalable, robust, and incremental. It offers flexible software configuration to support autonomous driving, v2x connectivity, and other high-end applications that can be updated over vehicle’s life cycle.AUTOSAR adaptive platform provides application developers a stable programming interface called AUTOASR Runtime for Adaptive Applications (ARA).Let’s take a look at some of the requirements that are needed to support future automotive applications using AUTOSAR adaptive platform:High-Performance ComputingEasy Configuration and DiagnosticsFaster Development Cycles / Rapid PrototypingMulticore Processor SupportInteroperability with Classic AUTOSAR PlatformThe above-mentioned requirements to run Adaptive AUTOSAR applications can be achieved using some of the specific characteristics of the Adaptive platform, which can be described as:Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA): AUTOSAR adaptive platform focuses on flexibility and scalability and is thus designed over service-oriented architecture. SOA allows designing flexible ECUs software that helps in reducing the complexity and improving reusability and portability of the software components.Programming Language: Adaptive AUTOSAR depends on C++14 language standard. Usually, C language is the prime focus to develop any automotive application, but the complexity of the Adaptive platform led to the adoption of C++. Compared to C language, C++ provides a better mechanism for data encapsulation and supports large and distributed systems in a better manner.Operating System: AUTOSAR adaptive platform runs on POSIX based (PSE51). POSIX stands for “Portable Operating System Interface” through which one can access the OS. Through PSE 51, approximately 300 API can be used, which allows better portability. POSIX based (PSE51) also supports preemptive multitasking and allows dynamic number of tasks."
ER today. Solid earnings.....$12 target price.https://ir.microvision.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/344/microvision-to-announce-third-quarter-results-on-october
"Nothing has changed with MVIS for DECADES...still hope and faith only...no revenues or profits in well over 20 years now....DECADES ...Former MVIS employee (does he still own his MVIS shares?) has a blog on MVIS....quotes MVIS using words like ""any potential confidential evaluation from customers or partners""...""further increase value for potential partners and our shareholders""...""I expect""...""I believe""....""potentially accelerating adoption of vehicles with autonomous driving and active safety systems""...""I expect""...""could allow""....""I believe ""...""""... then lists Job openigs...."
"What, so Microsoft STILL hasn't bought up MVIS?!!??? Oh, and even though the CEO has stated long ago that they are open to a merger NOTHING has happened lo these many months.... Hmmm how on earth is this forever small, forever loosing money company keeping a market valuation above $100M??"
"VLADIMIR,,ON THE WAY TO ACCUMULATE MORE MVIS SHARES,,ITS BUYERS MARKET."
"For those that cant stay i would understand - we have had some big ups and downs . However i dont believe for one second that we have anything less than best in class Lidar . Yes im alittle disappointed that we have yet began selling in small amounts like we were told would happen in 3rd or 4th quarter of this year , however we all knew that would only be minimal at best . I still believe in SS and i dont believe for one second that all the expansion going on in the co is for nothing .. Adding people , adding space , adding board members with lots of experience is all for what coming . Thankfully im still well under my cost average on the stock but even if i werent id still be confident in where this co is headed . Yes its going to be a bit longer , yes im a long , and yes i may indeed add a few . What a great spot to gamble if your confident in Lidar becoming a big deal in the future ( which i Am ) .. The other verticals will just be icing on the cake as time goes on .. Long story short its like a ole smart guy told me ( dont risk the rent money in the stock market) but just accumulate what you can comfortably afford to hold a few years and wait !! The shorts should be covering and congrats to those that have made a buck doing so but at some point the train will start to pick up speed again and we will see much higher PPS ... Its really as simple as you believe in SS and team or ya dont -- I happen to be in the camp of the believers !! Good luck to all !!"
Why doesn’t Sharma sell off his AR business and continue to develop lidar? Do a deal for your investors who are getting impatient please!
I cannot take this pain any longer. Went in for earnings short squeeze. Down $6200 . I’ll never touch another stock again. Depressed 4 sure
"MVIS Third Quarter 2021 results:“Revenue for the third quarter of 2021 was $0.7 million, compared to $0.6 million for the third quarter of 2020. MicroVision's net loss for the third quarter of 2021 was $9.4 million, or $0.06 per share, which includes $2.8 million of non-cash, share-based compensation expense, compared to a net loss of $2.8 million, or $0.02 per share, which includes $0.5 million of non-cash, share-based compensation expense, for the third quarter of 2020. Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2021 was negative $6.2 million, compared to negative $2.1 million in the third quarter of 2020. . . .”In other words, the only thing that is accelerating is their cash burn. No material revenue. No material licensing fees. Just burning cash from the ATM offerings."
"Anyone who blames the company for the stock price decline is simply just wrong. The company never caused the price to go from sub $1 to $28. Speculators did that! You were all gambling on potential technological advances that may or may not come to fruition. You were not buying a stock like Proctor and Gamble with predictable sales and earnings. The company did not misrepresent anything. You all thought it was going to $100 or more for absolutely no reason. Your mistake, not the company's or anyone else's. Everyone thinks that they are going to make a quick buck nowadays. These are all newbies who read the headlines. Good luck with that. Work hard, save your money and invest for the long term. Unfortunately, this doesn't happen as much as it should anymore. Please accept and realize that it's your own fault and no one else's that you lost money."
"Holy shizzles. Thank God I not bag holding this stock. I feel super bad for the longs, but this thing is heading for 5 bucks. Their revenue was $700,000 for the entire 3rd quarter? Why are we even discussing a company on a nationwide and international forum that can only generate 700k of revenue in an entire quarter? There's a restaurant down the street from my house that has generated more money than that. I hate talking smack like this, because I know there are good people losing real money on this thing. All I can say is hopefully you made money on earlier spikes."
"November 15 & 16, MVIS will present their latest lidar technology at the 4th DVN Lidar Conference in Germany, two key notes speeches one each day will be made by two companies.Our conference program will be completed by two keynote speeches, which will be delivered by Valeo and one other company (to be announced)."
"If you look all the way back to the beginning of the 00's, it's the same story.Revenue under 1m, losses of about 4-5m, dilution at some point and repeat."
"These guys were right. ""MicroVision Blasted as 'Corporate Husk' by Hindenburg ResearchMicroVision 'is essentially a science project that has gone nowhere after 25 years,' says short-seller Hindenburg Research."""
Ups and Down are part of This Field.remember ! we are Investers Not Traders. Matter of Time when it Will Bounce Back and then you All will be Happy and Praising. we are Holding 10000 shares and wont sell till $ 20 plus
Sumit also made a convincing case for Microvision off the self component created LIDAR. It sounded to me that it is a case that Microvision is ready to go and customize their LIDAR offerings to each OEM’s specs as soon as the IEM is ready to order which appears to be about late 2022. The OEM’s are the holdup and he also said that their orders will be for multiple modules in each vehicle. The OEM’s plan to add them to almost every model they build. We shall see!
Monday I predicted we would be under $8.00 by the end of the week. Sadly it looks like I’ll be correct. I’m also predicting by the end of November we will be under $5.00. Let’s hope I am wrong. Also smack down these posts that keep saying buy the dip. Every day is a dip.
"Gee whiz, ppl care about earnings? Who knew?"
In all honesty I’d be really worried if other lidar stocks were going up and Mvis was dropping. They’re all dropping. It’s a sector thing not a company thing. No lidar company’s make money yet.
"What I don’t understand is why after Microsoft had all those contracts with the US Army, where all that royalties went?"
