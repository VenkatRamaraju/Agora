"HORIBA develops world’s first LIDAR test system08/24/2020 | Press ReleaseMarket novelty allows LIDAR testing in anticipation of the UN Level 3 Regulations for partially autonomous vehicles to enter force in January 2021.New system will close the gap between test center simulations and real-world road testing. HORIBA, a leading supplier and innovation driver of vehicle test systems, is the first manufacturer in the world to introduce a Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) test system for which a patent is pending. With this application, the company anticipates the upcoming legislation for autonomous driving and provides its customers with a test solution that enables them to comply with upcoming requirements for the approval of autonomous driving functions.The new system can generate artificial LIDAR objects and present them to a vehicle in combination with camera and RADAR. It is already in use at the HORIBA Test Center in Oberursel but can also be implemented at customer sites. With this development, HORIBA is breaking new ground to avoid interference with vehicle data bus systems and closes the gap between test center simulations and test drives in real-life road traffic conditions.""With the new test system, we are enabling our customers to already comply with the upcoming UN regulation for autonomous driving (Level 3) in the LIDAR field. The application is also suitable for other LIDAR-based products and services, such as industrial applications in product quality assurance. Thanks to this versatility, we can provide our customers with optimum support and enable them to meet the wide range of requirements they face,"" explains André Engelbert, Global Applications Manager CAV at HORIBA.HORIBA's LIDAR test system gives companies a decisive advantage in the development of autonomous driving functions and related services. In addition, the technology for which a patent is pending can also be used in the homologation and technical verification of vehicles. With this new technology, HORIBA is making an important contribution to the ongoing standardization of test procedures related to autonomous driving."

"After the reveal by Dave that Microvision is not in Amazon Glow,the hype for interactive display is gone forever as they are similar tech developed by others.AR and hololens 2 hype is gone, more companies are coming up with AR products.Automotive Lidar has a very strong competition and most OEMs already secured their future partners or made investments in their own tech.Consumer Lidar no hype and don’t think we will ever hear of it.Only thing left is the sale of IPs.The company has not learned the lesson from its past mistakes, make products that sell, best specs don’t matter if there are no buyers."

A good time to accumulate more shares at this point. Think for the long term. Don't let the recent drop discourage you. It went from $1 to $28 within a year. 28x. (I have been buying since 2013. I got my lowest price at 0.16) It can go from here at $10 to $40 within a year. Let the price go down more so it can bounce up higher. Don't sell your shares. Don't be afraid.

Finally holding above 8k shares of MicroVision stock. I’ve heard someone told me that the car production has been delayed because of many car manufacturers are actually waiting for lidar companies show the world what exactly they’re working on. So far MicroVision has the most impressive lidar ever made according to many car makers who have their contracts pending with other lidar companies ( he wouldn’t name names) . So let’s keep our fingers crossed and hope for the huge news to become public before the 3rd quarter ER.
The worst headache is just around the corner - the ER report.
"HOW ABOUT SOME SERIOUS BUYING TODAY AND TOMORROW,,LIKE PUSHING MICROVISION UP 25-30%,SO WE CAN SELL THOSE CALLS AND GO GET PUMPKINS AND SOME CANDY FOR HALLOWEEN."
"I sold Nov covered calls at 23 back on June. Going to close the option tomorrow with a nice profit. Still holding my 2023 sell to open put contracts @ 10 strike. Of course, I still own the stock. The cash I made on MVIS options is keeping my total investment above water."
"I think I am doing very good with the dips , carefully getting a few more shares on weakness , averaging down and buying weakness. The market has done this before, but not everyone takes advantage of buying the market on weakness"
I hope that everyone has watched the video as they mentioned MicroVision on business channel . Good news guys. We are going to become a household name before you know it
Big news
"You don’t lease so much space, unless there are few lidar deals cooking. This stock needs to trade in $25-35 range, not in $10-17 ."
Looks like we will heading into the weekend at under $10.00 This is one sad stock. I really no idea why I’m sticking to my guns on not selling before the years end. I’m thinking it might be under $5.00 by then.
"Wow, the entire market flying including TLRY with worst than expected numbers and MVIS is the only stock that can’t move up. So frustrating "
"IVAS delaying heads up display further maturation of the heads-up display portion is required. That next step will come later in fiscal year 2022,We know we want this newer design for the baseline [model],” Potts said. And if those trials work out, operational tests of the IVAS are planned for later in 2022, he added."
The number of ppl that don't care about metrics and were looking for bad investments dried up??
This stock is the definition of scam
What’s going on? We’re more negative now than we were earlier when the markets were red. I just don’t get mvis.

"New IVAS schedule and troubles being worked on...>>>May 2022: Operational testSeptember 2022: First unit equippedIn the lead-up to tests this August, Potts said there were inconsistencies in some of the heads-up displays. The issue, at times, caused a “screen door effect,” meaning the image resolution had a kind of gridded view.The technicians narrowed the problem down to moisture content in the system, Potts said. And developers have a solution.Another hurdle involved the field-of-view. Even the best goggle devices, a 40-degree field-of-view was the best range achieved, according to Potts. The IVAS program aimed to double that to an 80-degree field-of-view.The problem, Potts said, was that pushed the boundaries of what waveguide technology is capable of at this time.The wider field-of-view caused a stretching effect that slightly misaligned imagery in the mixed reality view."
tutes will not forget $140 million ATM .. at $14 .7 PPS . Any more BS and they will break the doors on the way out.
"As expected, the show was a waste of time, a flop for MVIS...SUB $10s coming especially with the 2 new LIDAR technoligies shown at the expo."

ole jon maybe you are right by saying that ss is on something -that is NEW warehouse - once all junk get mowed in and there is space left -he will sublease it and MVIS will start making money -in REALSTATE.
I told you you could scalp this today. the charts don't lie.
where is our #$%$ PR?
what is with this stock?Every day buying opportunities?
This week so far mvis has been up one cent and 9 cents. I bet today it closes up 17 cents. I bet you the next time it goes down it will be down 75 cents to a dollar. It’s just so predictable it makes me sick.
"I closed out my short position, not bad 4 days +$53,500...GOOO MVIS.."
Scared investors are gamblers and will probably lose money because they will sell all or most of their shares before any real news hits. I’ll hold all my shares till the buyout news.
Everyone hates this stock by now. Longs and shorts. The few that still pump this stock are in denial.

"Tesla needs to address 'basic safety issues' before expanding tech, says NTSB chiefJeremy KorzeniewskiSun, September 19, 2021, 3:54 PMBefore Tesla considers rolling out a further expansion of its semi-autonomous driving technology, the automaker should take a hard look at what it's already released, according to Jennifer Homendy, head of the National Transportation Safety Board. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Homendy said, ""Basic safety issues have to be addressed before they’re then expanding it to other city streets and other areas.""Homendy further suggested that Tesla ""has clearly misled numerous people to misuse and abuse technology."" It seems Homendy is referring in part to what she calls ""misleading and irresponsible"" naming and marketing of the automaker's technology, which includes provisions to automatically steer, accelerate and brake but requires the full attention of a licensed driver who is ready and able to take over if and when the software encounters a situation it can't handle. Tesla calls some of its technologies ""Full Self Driving"" and ""Autopilot,"" despite the fact that the vehicles are not actually capable of autonomously driving themselves."

"""in June Janes spoke with Program Executive Officer Soldier Major General Anthony Potts and IVAS Product Manager Colonel Troy Denomy about the effort. At the time, the duo said the army would convene a ‘user jury' on 12 July to evaluate the latest IVAS iteration ahead of operational testing later in the month. Army leaders were then expected to make a fielding decision sometime between September and December, which is seemingly when they decided not to outfit soldiers with the capability right now"""
"If you still defend this company knowing that no matter how the markets are doing it goes down, then you deserve to lose all your money. Look at a day like today. We’re probably gonna close on the red. Why? Like many here I still own lots of mvis shares but that doesn’t mean I don’t realize now that this company is worthless. I regret 100% today that I ever invested in this company and I pray that we get one last pump to the mid teens to get out and never look back."

If the ‘jury' provides positive feedback, the device will begin operational testing in anticipation of a fielding decision sometime between September and December.Microsoft and the service have been militarising the company's HoloLens 2 augmented reality (AR) system and earlier this year signed a production contract that could be worth up to USD21.9 billion over the coming decade.Army leaders envision that soldiers could use the AR device for a range of activities from simulated training events to mission planning and execution. Potential headset capabilities include the ability to translate foreign words, navigate terrain, identify and catalogue individuals, and more. It is also being designed to be paired with the fire-control system for the service's Next Generation Squad Weapons.Earlier this year US soldiers conducted IVAS cold-weather testing at the Army Test and Evaluation Command's Cold Regions Test Center at Fort Greely, Alaska.

"When it’s such a perfect buying opportunity at a huge discount some of you run for the bleachers… I’ll just keep buying more shares and sell them after the market stops bleeding. All this talk about taxing the rich is getting to people and they lose their cool . Not sure about that. MVIS has a new contract in the making with lucid motors I believe. Lucid has been called a mix of Tesla with Ferrari with 1,111 horse power motor. It will have a few lidars and 23 different sensors and preorder of 10k cars. I like the idea of MVIS part being inside of their luxury fleet of cars. Good luck with your investment portfolio and forget selling your shares at those prices.Stop worrying."
"So which company is going to use our technology inside their many products? Could it be AAPL MSFT GOOG or AMZN? How about all of them? How about one of them will pay a top dollar buying us out?

The one thing this stock is showing for sure is that Yahoo finance knows nothing about the stock. They still have this garbage a strong buy/buy. Why???
"btw, any interested party need not go to a dog n pony show to buy from MVIS and their well known products & tech."
"GUYS,,LISTEN TO MARK,HE IS SHARP,,AND HE LIVES IN FANCY HOOD SURROUNDED BY JEOPARDY CHAMPIONS."
A few smaller fish starting to cover. Let’s see who follows
The deliveries of IVAS to US Army has been delivered today. People what are you waiting for? This is real ! Buy the stock now or chase the shares later.
Margin calls should teach you a painful lesson about over extending yourself while reaching for fast money. Hopefully you don’t keep repeating the same mistakes 
"JUST WONDERING WHAT DOES MARK AND MY PILLOW GUY THINK ABOUT MERCK'S COVID TABLETS ,,MOLNUPRINAVIR,,OR THEY WILL STILL PREFER MULE AND HORSE PULLS IVERMECTIN."
What happened???????
"The stock market is having a really bad day. Nothing is going up, except a few names. Just be patient and positive and buy more shares on sale. Or just hold all your shares and don’t look at them for a few years. The stock that is still going up is the new company that would have a contract with MVIS and is a major competitor with Tesla. I guess 4-6 billion of dollars did buy a few spare parts for the production of many cars that are being built now in US. Good luck with your investment portfolio."
been invested with this for almost a year. starting to lose faith on what they were supposed to deliver...no buyers no big contracts almost seems like the auto show was a bust.
Most of you shorts crack me up. I will tell my story a million times. I bought at .88 @ share x 18k. Who is fooling who?
there is one good thing about the stock going down -you can lower your PPS by averaging down
We are only down 75 percent since April no big deal
Prepare to buy at 6.50
"Google this for the link...YAHOOFOOLS trying to censor links again...such morons when do easily hit around...13 OCTOBER 2021AUSA 2021: US Army ‘pauses' IVAS programme, fielding on hold""US Army officials have halted plans to field a militarised version of Microsoft's HoloLens 2 augmented reality (AR) system to soldiers, placing a contract worth up to USD21.9 billion in jeopardy, Janes has learned.The Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics and Technology's (ASAALT's) office paused the service's Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS) and is “essentially doing a reset of that programme, figuring out what is the appropriate timeline and where is the technology”, Brigadier General William Glaser, director of the Synthetic Training Environment Cross-Functional Team, told Janes on 12 October"""
This will break upwards and hard between today and Friday. Watch the squeeze
Getting ready to buy right after ER . I’ve got to try to get a lot more this time . Before anyone starts covering this right before announcing also would be a great opportunity to get on the action before the storm. The whole market is dominated by the bears. Very hard to find another gem like MVIS was for a long time. It will be back faster then we will be able to buy. After gaining $ 86k and loosing 7k recently to market fluctuations it’s a small price to pay for a quality technology.
"MARKETS ARE UP, WHATS THE EXPLANATION FOR MEME JUNK GOING DOWN ACROSS THE BOARD ??"
where's the takeover.the post were constantly about takeover.all stimulas mommy bedroom meme people
run  forest 
Just buy before anyone else buys and you will definitely win betting on this company. Look how many top guns recently joined the board of directors of this company.
"Every red day it goes down between 7-8%, while other stocks go down less than 1%"
"shorts are starting to get caught, if they double down now, its going to cost them dearly.. MVIS has so much room to run , I am a believer in the opportunities ; and I hope retail investors kick #$%$ and make mucho money.. we won't continue to be able to get in below $13s soon and watch for a bigger spike.. the charts r telling the story , shorts beware of the next leg up"
I’m just saying: buy buy buy
I am long term in this stock
The stock did act as someone new -there won't be any $'s from Microsoft to MVIS
"EDSA ,,BIOTECH ,,WENT UP 11% ON A DAY LIKE YESTERDAY,,FROM 6500 AVERAGE VOLUME TO 160 MILLION VOLUME IN DAY,6 YEARS AGO IT WAS TRADING AT $400 PER SHARE,? GOOD REPORT ON PHASE 2 TRIAL OF SOME COMBO TREATMENT FOR COVID,, AND NO, ITS NOT SOMETHING MIXED WITH IVERMECTIN ,,,,,TO BUY OR NOT TO BUY ?WOULD MARK OR SOMEONE HAVE ANY INPUT ON THAT ?"
"It was my understanding that at this show we would all become rich. The stock would be going to the moon. So far we have lost a $1.53 per share. Not a rocket scientist here, but aren’t we going in the wrong direction. Said I was holding till year end or hits my sell price."
VLDR and LAZR are both green and MVIS red as usual. Something here doesn’t add up.
When MicroVision and whoever they make deals with allow the positive developments to be broadcasted this low floater will skyrocket. We all know it so stop with the nonsense
Another red day!!! Soooo predictable. This is a short’s dream come true.
I will probably come in around $1.95-$2.50? So in the meantime I just patiently wait
I look at this one like i did at facebook when i got it for 18-20 bucks a share --- in early for the long run -- accumulate on the dips folks !
Wensday could be a major turning Date for Fluff. It's when Kirk returns from Space!
I can buy this with my own personal money pretty soon it’s so cheap
It's a good start today. Hopefully is the close also positive and is this the begin of a good return up.
Tomorrow looks like it could be a real Dumper. Maybe even a Crash. Especially for NASDAQ.
"Does anyone know what is the Fintel short squeeze score (out of 100) for MVIS, or where it is ranked out of 5458 stocks for likelihood of short squeeze?"
"“net loss for the second quarter of 2021 was $15.0 million, or $0.09 per share, which includes $7.9 million of non-cash compensation expense...”LOL. That’s all you need to know about this company, right there, in one paragraph. Non-existent revenues and heavy losses, while management keeps enriching themselves through stock comp... and diluting existing shareholders in the process!"
"$12, $15, $16 all high open interest for next week"
The best in class at the bottom of the class.
SUMIT SHARMA ?
