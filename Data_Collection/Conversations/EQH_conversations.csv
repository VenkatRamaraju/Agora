"Solid performance, EV dragged down the market, time to buy for a long term invest"
Ken Fisher buys annuities here at AXA

Equitable Holdings declares $0.17 dividend https://seekingalpha.com/news/3576520-equitable-holdings-declares-0_17-dividend
Goldman Sachs price target $35
They focus on non gaap earnings? Gaap earnings missed badly
"Credit Suisse upgraded today with an Outperform rating, and a $51 price target. With a PE of less than 6 this year, and less than 5 next year, EQH is a no-brainer for a 50% or more move higher in the next 6 months."
EQH reached an all time high at 25.43
Pretty big move this month. Maybe due to AXA being done selling shares
Goldman
EQH should Report a Huge Quarter...........Just look at where BHF is trading after reporting- https://finance.yahoo.com/gainers?e=us
Looking good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!At this rate EQH will be at 25 within a week or so. Looks like no sellers just buyers. Of course there are sellers - underwriters are selling shares!!!!GLTA in stock casino!
"Very curious what the earnings will bring. Just bought a couple of shares of this company a couple of months ago, so far rather sideways movement. Hoping for a green move after earnings :)"
I guess for all financial service firms question is how much falling interest rates will impact them
did good on eps this time hope to see it pop again next time
I wish more people posted on this board. I think earnings were underwhelming but not sure

I own stock in this company and Unum. I am not sure how you make money selling annuities when rates are this low. Seems like the assets would not earn enough to fund your liabilities. Overall most recent conference call was ok with dividend increase
"Bought in at 20.50 seemed like the market was ignoring this solid company pre market this morning and turns out I was right, nice gains today and I will hold this stock for a while."
