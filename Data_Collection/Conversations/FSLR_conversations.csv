"FS is still trading with the other solar stocks and not rising above them at this point, meaning the market does not give them any credit for their tech, lower costs, balance sheet, or capacity addition plans. The margins need to spike to make a point."

LOL ....Guggenheim raised the price target for the First Solar Inc. (NASDAQ:FSLR) stock from “a Buy” to “a Neutral”. The rating was released on October 20
All quiet on the sell side analyst front
Add Zacks to the list of nonsense sources of info online.
Critical weeks coming up. $3.5 trillion bill and FSLR earnings on 11-4 should jump-start FSLR to 120.

I am a long-term First Solar bull. I have to ask why anyone would be buying FSLR puts here if they looked at the situation on the options chain?! To each their own i guess.

An oil crisis sure puts a damper on sell side analyst games in day trading.
"I have owned this stock for several years, and at the present time, the tail winds are stronger than at any other point. At one point in time, our chemistry was considered a liability, and with the current situation with supply chain problems with silicone chemistry, the argument could be made for our chemistry being a competitive advantage now. The vertical integration of our manufacturing process allows for penetration of closed markets with factories a possibility. The current inflated shipping costs are affecting us currently, but our factory footprint expanding will help us more than the competition. With the Series 6 dimensions, our labor and parts needs are on par with other panels during installation. The proven competitive economies of scale for utility size projects with our product allows us to go after other options available to utilities. The forced labor issues in China make us look like the cowboys riding into town with our white cowboy hats. If we execute, the value of this company is an easy double in a year."

Another downgrade to push shares lower in a faux panic so firms can buy in lower. Once they've gotten what they want this will head back up.
