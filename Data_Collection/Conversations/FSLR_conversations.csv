"I have owned this stock for several years, and at the present time, the tail winds are stronger than at any other point. At one point in time, our chemistry was considered a liability, and with the current situation with supply chain problems with silicone chemistry, the argument could be made for our chemistry being a competitive advantage now. The vertical integration of our manufacturing process allows for penetration of closed markets with factories a possibility. The current inflated shipping costs are affecting us currently, but our factory footprint expanding will help us more than the competition. With the Series 6 dimensions, our labor and parts needs are on par with other panels during installation. The proven competitive economies of scale for utility size projects with our product allows us to go after other options available to utilities. The forced labor issues in China make us look like the cowboys riding into town with our white cowboy hats. If we execute, the value of this company is an easy double in a year."

BofA/ML upgraded to Buy this morning with $83 price target raised from $75. Cites Chinese demand for solar staying strong keeping prices from tanking and positive news on Solar Investment Tax Credit. This stock has just been biding time for a move higher and people just looking for any reason to move it into new multi-year highs. This is as a good a reason as any.
Not extending the solar investment tax credit is great news. It will wipe away the clutter in the high cost solar segments and shine the light better on the winners like FS.

"Warren Buffett Has Started The Biggest Energy RevolutionThe Historic Solar Farm That Will Produce the Cheapest Solar PowerLast September, Warren Buffett’s NV Energy company signed a deal with Los Angeles’ government to build America’s biggest solar farm. Last month, the project was also green-lit by the Trump administration.The farm will span 7,100 acres in the desert outside Las Vegas. It will be backed by the world’s largest battery and power 6–7% of LA’s electricity needs.Stunning scale aside, the most jaw-dropping thing is the price of its electricity. The plant will produce energy at a cost of $20 per megawatt hour of electricity—plus $13 for storage.In all, the plant’s power will cost $33 per megawatt hour. That's half the estimated cost of power from a new natural gas plant!https://www.forbes.com/sites/stephenmcbride1/2020/02/11/warren-buffett-has-started-the-biggest-energy-revolution/"
"The novel coronavirus outbreak has put pressure on China’s solar market, particularly on the supply side. The extended shutdown implemented in factories to contain the spread of the virus is expected to have slowed down the production rate.As a result, overall capacity growth in the first quarter of 2020 is widely expected to decelerate. Consequently, solar stocks are expected to show sluggish growth in the near term.How Coronavirus Might Impact Solar?China leads the world both in terms of solar farm installations and production of photovoltaic panels used almost everywhere. Of the top 10 solar cell makers, nine are China based (per a report by Bloomberg).Notably, post the outbreak, PV production capacity has been hit in Jiangsu province, where more than 60% of China’s solar panels are made, according to the Gofa Institute, a wing of the government’s National Energy Administration. As a result, the market is worried that the shortage of material supply and logistical limitations due to closed borders may shoot up the price of modules, which otherwise was plummeting rapidly. The shortage is also expected to push back delivery time. Since China remains the world’s largest solar module producer, a disruption in the supply chain of key solar equipment has the potential to hit not only its solar market but the entire global solar industry.China Photovoltaic Industry Association stated that overseas plants could be hit as they will be unable to receive components from China given flight restrictions. Moreover, Ali Izadi-Najafabadi, head of analysis in Asia for BloombergNEF, stated that if the virus outbreak lasts beyond the first quarter and spreads to more geographies, as is currently happening in Korea and Italy, then it may well slow down global renewable energy deployment.Coming to the current situation, the number of people killed worldwide by the coronavirus has exceeded 3,000 (as per a latest report by BBC News), with more than 90% of the total deaths reported in China’s Hubei province.Considering the alarming rate at which this epidemic is spreading worldwide, the supply chain disruption in China’s solar market is surely going to affect the global solar industry.Dismal OutlookAs the number of coronavirus cases rise, analysts have lowered their forecast for the Chinese solar market, which in a ripple effect might weigh on the global solar industry’s prospect. Notably, BloombergNEG analysts now expect a maximum of 43 gigawatts (GW) of solar installations in China this year, compared with 45 gigawatts projected earlier.Per a senior analyst from Wood Mackenzie, late module delivery will affect project construction schedules around the world, and projects with Q3 and Q4 2020 placed-in-service dates are likely to be hit."

"Maybe I'm overly optimistic, but over the next 10 years solar could certainly have the same run up that the chip stocks had from 2008-2019. Market caps of ($JKS, $CSIQ, $ENPH, $FSLR, $SEDG, $SPWR, etc) are between $600MM-$5BLook at Chip stock Market Caps/Share Price from 2008/2009. Their market caps were close to what solar stocks are today in a similar high growth industry.MU 2008: ~$2B / 2019: ~$44B - 2100% increaseAVGO 2009 ~$3B / 2019: ~$110B - 3566.67% Increase$10K on Broadcom in 2009 would be worth like >$150K today. You can see this kind of exponential increases out of many chip stocks that made it out of that era. So do you think Micron or Broadcom can grow another 10-20xs in the next 10 years like they did in the past in the next 10 years? I seriously doubt it, but I think JKS or FSLR easily could. Anyway, something to consider.. Hang in there on solar stocks."
"Was this move really about the tariff bill? The market all of a sudden believes there's a 2/3 majority to override a veto? And even if it happens with FSLR effectively sold out through 2020, you're telling me that taking away one year (2021) of a then 15% tariff is enough to justify a 9% drop in market cap?"
A DCF analysis making very conservative assumptions concluded that First Solar’s value is in excess of $150/share. This analysis included management guidance and strong visibility into revenue flow as First Solar's manufacturing capacity is sold out until the second half of 2020 at prices that are locked in. We factored opex per watt ultimately decreasing 40% over FY 2017.

"Solar Power is the largest exponential growth industry since the Internet 1990 to 1999. Study CSCO Systems during this fantastic growth era to get a real understanding of growth potential in solar today. Winning Solar growth stocks today can be expected to enjoy exponential sales growth over the next 10 years. Exponential sales growth = Exponential growth in the stock price. This means that the stock price can double & split MANY times over the next 10 years. We refer to this as exponential growth where we can see 1000 times growth in sales + stock price. A good growth stock such as CSCO can return 3,000 times today's stock price. If you are skeptical, please study CSCO stock from 1990 to 1999. Solar has intense competition and FSLR has a chance of seeing exponential growth in sales over the next 10 years. Bottom line is hold winning stocks for long term gains and avoid taking Chump Change profits in the greatest growth industry since the Internet. We need to focus on solar storage & winning inverters."

"""CFRA RAISES OPINION ON SHARES OF FIRST SOLAR, INC. TO BUY FROM HOLD2:03 pm ET June 5, 2019 (CFRA) We up our 12-month target to $72 from $60 on a P/S of 2.3x our 2020 estimate, above peers, supported by net cash per share around $16, and near its ten-year historical average. We keep our '19 EPS view at $2.50 and '20 at $3.64. Our upgrade reflects several factors. First, we see considerable margin improvement, on cost per watt improvements from the ramp of its Series 6 panels (about 30% reduction over the next three quarters). Second, we see upside to ASPs, as Series 6 panels command a premium to its predecessor and industry supply tightens in the second half. We also see increasing installations in Europe given a resurgence in the utility scale market. We think FSLR will post a book-to-bill significantly above 1:1 in the second half on very favorable terms (e.g. offering upside to '20 and '21 revenue), as buyers look to lock in the 30% ITC before '19 end (scales down to 26% in '20 and 22% in '21). Finally, we see sharp free cash flow improvement, as capital expenditures moderate."""

"Solid guidance - this is a long hold that will do will in 2020 and you want to buy in now. Read this analysis of the market in general from the CEO: Turning briefly to the market. Catalysts driving increased PV penetration continued to point to a strong global demand in 2019 and momentum building thereafter. For example in the U.S., there's a growing impetus to de-carbonize electricity. In the past months Washington state joined California, New Mexico, Hawaii, Puerto Rico and Washington D.C. in an active legislation that mandates 100% clean electricity standard.Additionally, over a dozen other states have here put in place non-binding goals have introduced or are planning to introduce legislation with varying levels of clean energy commitments, or are committing to studying clean alternatives to their power generation portfolios.Corporate buyers are also increasingly looking for ways to de-carbonize their electricity. This is reflected in the fast-changing PPA landscape in the United States, which has seen an evolution in buyer types and transaction structures. We see a significant rise in corporate and commercial industrial PPA structures, with large technology companies dominating the market, but with growing interest from other sectors, such as health care, finance and even oil and gas.As part of our focus to accelerate growth in this segment, First Solar has joined the Board of the Renewable Energy Buyers Alliance, which has committed to establishing a clear path to its members to procure zero carbon electricity. This alliance's goal is to catalyze 60 gigawatts of new renewable energy for its members by 2025.Internationally, Europe has continued on its growth trajectory with 2019 potentially being a record year for PV installations. Initially, this year First Solar celebrates 15 years in Europe, with approximately 5 gigawatts of installed capacity across the region.This year, we expect European growth to be largely powered by the resurgence of the utility scale market in Spain, driven by economics and favorable policy. Spain is expected to add significant new capacity over the next several years. Additionally, France continues to procure utility-scale solar as part of its grid program. Globally all indicators point to growth underpinned by a combination of competitive economics of solar and a desire to de-carbonize electricity grids."
"After remaining either on the sidelines or bearish on First Solar, Inc. an analyst at Raymond James deemed it fit to shift to the bullish camp.PV module manufacturing, both crystalline and thin film, is a fundamentally commoditized business, with module pricing continuing to tick down, Molchanov noted. However, First Solar, though part of the commoditized industry, is large-scale, cost-competitive and highly bankable.""First Solar is the only U.S.-based module supplier in the global top ten, and it is also the only one without direct Chinese exposure - needless to say, politically advantageous these days,"" the analyst wrote in the note.First Solar's 2020 gross margin guidance of 26-27%, according to the analyst, puts the company in the industry's top quartile. The analyst also noted capital spending has peaked and the balance sheet remains exceptionally cash-rick, making buyback a free option.First Solar, according to Raymond James, is ""one of the few remaining value ideas - arguably, deep value - in clean tech.""""Yes, this is undeniably a commoditized business, and quarterly results have a tendency to be lumpy, but with the stock at 5x 2021E EBITDA - also a modest 6.5x based on 2020 guidance - we think risk/reward is nicely tilted to the upside,"" Molchanov wrote.https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/20/02/15393672/analyst-brightens-prospect-on-first-solar-for-first-time-since-2010"

"Please don’t accuse me of sustainable investing. But I can’t help but notice that some alternative-energy stocks have down-to-earth prices. First Solar hasn’t been anyone’s idea of a steady long-term performer, but it’s up 23% this year, and trades at just 14 times next year’s earnings projection. According to J.P. Morgan, which calls First Solar a top pick, the company’s transition to a new module design called Series 6 will give it a lasting competitive advantage in the global solar-panel market.In short, energy storage costs have fallen by nearly half in five years, and they could drop by another two-thirds or more in the coming decade. That will offset the main knock against solar and wind—that they provide cheap power only when nature cooperates. The result will be a rapid build-out of storage, and a quickening of gains for alternatives. Beneficiaries could include solar-equipment companies like First Solar (ticker: FSLR); battery makers like LG Chem (051910.Korea) and Samsung SDI (006400.Korea); chemical companies like Albemarle (ALB); and utilities that already have plenty of wind and solar capacity, like NextEra Energy (NEE)."
"However, solar is still in the early innings of its growth, with many in the industry expecting that development will accelerate over the next several years. Thus, solar-focused companies still appear to have lots of upside ahead. Three of the most attractive ones to buy right now are utility Con Edison (NYSE:ED), solar panel maker First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR), and renewable yieldco NextEra Energy Partners (NYSE:NEP).Powering that growth is the company's transition to the Series 6 module, which is selling at a brisk pace. The company booked orders for 1.1 GWs of new panels over the last quarter, bringing its year-to-date order total to 5.4 GW, which pushed its current backlog up to 12.4 GW. In the meantime, it has another 8.1 GW of mid- to late-stage opportunities in the pipeline. To put that into perspective, the company currently only has the capacity to make 5.5 GW of these solar panels each year. Add that highly visible revenue stream as it builds and delivers these orders to its cash-rich balance sheet, and First Solar is an ideal way to gain direct exposure to the growth of the solar sector."

"First Solar has about $17 per share in cash and effectively no debt.Delayed revenue recognition last year to be realized this year should make it easy for First Solar to meet its annual guidance of $3.25-3.75 in EPS.At recent depressed prices, First Solar is trading at under 5x earnings to enterprise value.Factoring in the company's adjusted cash position, current valuation is only 4.3x earnings to enterprise value. On this basis, its current valuation is the lowest among major US listed solar equipment manufacturers.Another mitigating positive was stated during the company's fourth-quarter earnings conference call.""Earnings are expected to be back-end weighting with approximately 20% in the first half of the year and 80% in the second-half.""As long as the Coronavirus epidemic in the US doesn't extend past July, it is possible the lower volumes expected in the first half may be pushed into the second half of the year and still be realized. Since utility scale solar projects are often constructed in remote areas by small dedicated teams, it may even be possible work could continue even when much of the residential population remains in lock down.As noted, large utility projects are often planned months in advance. Paperwork, permits, funding, etc., are often close to set in stone for most of the calendar year in many cases. The company noted it was completely book for 2020 and two-thirds sold through for 2021. Utility scale projects are capital investments and are often made even during times of recession. During the Financial Crisis of 2008, First Solar's net income rose annually by 120% in 2008 and 84% in 2009. Unless the Coronavirus paralyzes the workforce for a very extended period for time, much of First Solar's business should be secured.After three mediocre years following the solar utility boom in 2016, annual installations could jump by over 50% in 2020 as the chart below shows. According to the Solar Energy Industry Association [SEIA], the utility segment in the US is set to boom this year and next. Even if First Solar allocated its full capacity to the US market, it could not even supply half of the expected demand for this year and next. As the largest US solar module manufacturer, the company should be first in line to take advantage of the resurgence of US utility scale solar. This is perhaps the main reason for the company's sold out bookings and high visibility into next year.https://seekingalpha.com/article/4333390-despite-recent-disappointments-first-solar-become-attractive-longer-term-investment?utm_medium=email&utm_source=seeking_alpha#alt2&mail_subject=fslr-despite-recent-disappointments-first-solar-has-become-an-attractive-longer-term-investment&utm_campaign=rta-stock-article&utm_content=link-2"

"Every year or so there seems to be some new impending doom thesis for First Solar. Remember when thin film was a dead technology? Remember when the company was in crisis because it was skipping the Series 5? Remember the rumor that Series 6 panels couldn't get the right certifications? Remember when module prices were going to destroy the company? Remember when First Solar was expected to be crippled at the knees by bifacial panels?None of these Armageddon theses have ever come to fruition and although there have certainly been challenges both for the company and the industry. Currently, the fears are that First Solar will be selling panels at zero margin in 2022~2024 based on current spot prices. To some, First Solar's exit from project engineering and project development has bolstered this thesis.Management tells a different story. For one, they are getting noticeably more ""Wall Street savvy"", shooting down the bifacial Armageddon theory directly on the most recent call. Secondly, management went on to explain that First Solar is leaving the project development business because the industry is changing and it makes more sense for First Solar to focus on core R&D rather than expanding the geographic presence and technical capabilities of their development arm.https://seekingalpha.com/article/4330372-first-solars-bizarre-correlation-to-solar-etf-weighs-on-positive-long-term-outlook?utm_medium=email&utm_source=seeking_alpha&mail_subject=fslr-first-solar-s-bizarre-correlation-to-solar-etf-weighs-on-positive-long-term-outlook&utm_campaign=rta-stock-article&utm_content=link-2"

The solar industry's largest R&D group at FSLR has essentially been on hold during this multi-year build out of series 6 to not complicate the changeover with added risk. Could the 30 percent cost reduction from the series 6 be only part of the full story on cost reduction in '20 and '21 and the next formula change from the R&D group gets caught up? Recall that there were regular upgrades to efficiency and periodic new lab and pilot line efficiency records being recognized almost every year up to the point of the series 6 roadmap process.

"First Solar wins govt nod for 450-MW solar park in CaliforniaJanuary 16 (Renewables Now) - The US administration has given the green light to a 450-MW solar photovoltaic (PV) project in California’s desert, putting an end to a long opposition process based on environmental concerns.The Desert Quartzite scheme was proposed by Desert Quartzite LLC, a subsidiary of thin-film solar module maker First Solar Inc (NASDAQ:FSLR). The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) gave its approval to the project on Wednesday, thus allowing the developer to build and operate the huge power plant on around 3,000 acres of public lands.The permit concerns the construction of the main generation area, an onsite substation, a switchyard, a 230-kV transmission line that will link the PV park to the Colorado River substation, as well as an operations and maintenance (O&M) building.To be executed in California’s eastern Riverside County, near Palm Springs, the project calls for a total investment of USD 1 billion (EUR 897m). Up to 30 months will be needed for its construction, with commissioning seen by 2022. Once operational, the solar farm will be able to generate power for about 117,000 homes, bringing up to USD 2.7 million in annual rent and fees to the US economy.https://renewablesnow.com/news/first-solar-wins-govt-nod-for-450-mw-solar-park-in-california-683683/"

"It's becoming increasingly clear that human-caused climate change is going to cause more regions of the world to experience more extreme heat waves. That means more demand for cooling systems, which means more demand for electricity. Solar is the electric generation source of the future. This is a multi-decade opportunity with sizable short term growth and even greater long term opportunity. EVs are also the future, not just because they assist decarbonization, but because they offer a better driving experience and lower cost of ownership, and these advantages will increase as economies of scale ramp with greater production volume, and especially as the big automakers follow Tesla's lead. EV usage will drive more rooftop solar (I speak from experience, rooftop solar is awesome!). It's fun to watch the short term gyrations in FSLR, but long term is where the action is."

I know their core product is different but they're both in the solar industry and I wanted a piece of the pie before the rocket takes off - FSLR feels like the safer play for me. P/E is attractive, and addressable segment appears to be larger (altho revenue growth is not as high as ENPH)."
A new report from a major market analyst has highlighted the enormous potential for solar and battery projects to displace gas plants and how dramatic cost reductions make them by far the cheapest source of new firm generation capacity in many US States.
"Microsoft is collaborating with First Solar, an Arizona-headquartered solar energy company, on their Sun Streams 2 photovoltaic (PV) solar power plant, which will offset the energy usage of the new campus from its opening in 2021 with solar energy once the facility is operational. Clean solar PV energy displaces the water needed in the traditional electricity generation process. First Solar’s lowest carbon solar PV technology doesn't require water to generate electricity and is ideally suited to meet the growing energy and water needs of arid, water-limited regions. By displacing conventional grid electricity in Arizona, First Solar’s Sun Streams 2 Project is expected to save 356 million liters of water annually. https://www.telecompaper.com/news/microsoft-plans-sustainable-data-centre-in-arizona-in-2021--1354869"
I hate owning this stock so much
FSLR production up 104% last year. More to come this year.https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2020/02/12/jinko-solar-china-dominate-module-shipment-totals-again-in-2019/
FSLR has gone down nearly 50% this year. I am still with cost of low $70. What do I do now? Thanks.
$95 is where the bonus formula of WS manipulation stops and reverses course for the next cycle down to $80 and back. It pays for everything from beach houses to NYC taxes.
"The leader in Utility Solar Installations (fasting growing sector in solar) and most durable/highest quality modules. Now, the street is mixed on them because FSLR (like PLTR) do not run a business in order to cater to wall st. They run it to make $. A lot of it. Their balance sheet is what Buffett and Peter L, would call, superb. They are building more factories in Malaysia and Ohio is online. They are the only USA based company in their specific fields. Advantage? Yes. Huge. Morgan Stanley and Citi just tossed out garbage (probably some intern haha) Price Targets based on ""valuation"" concerns. Hmmmm, look at their revenue per share, cash flow, cash to debt, 3 billion in revenue. Then compare them to other players. It is not close. JMP has a 140 target, as I said mixed analysts (typical on potential leaders). FSLR CEO is lobbying for US Gov't to crack down on forced labor conditions in China which are basically dumping like they always do. I predict the our govt is going to make some moves to support are renewable industry at home. This company creates great jobs and a great product. It's well known in the industry, I know. If you look at the max charts from their earlier days 120 makes the top to the cup. It break through 110 high from this year to get there. Then will handle out and with strong earnings reports (which they will likely have it could break out to all time highs) The news will start to filter and the ""pretend bears"" Morgan and Citi will change their sentiment ""publicly"" and close their put sales rapidly.Stay long FSLR. 2-3 years. Possibly sooner. Adios PelotaChicken Dinner"

What a JOKE this company!!!
"I remember when the cult said tesla deserved a $1 trillion market cap because of its ""energy buisness"" and other things like it was yesterday..............In fact it was yesterday.And speaking of yesterday, yesterday $FSLR, an $8 billion market cap company with a more normal, albeit still high, PE of 21, reported Q4 earnings, something that seems to elude tesla like two like kind magnetic poles,..........of $1.08 per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.27 by 15%.Including one-time litigation losses, the company reported GAAP earnings of $1.09 per share against the GAAP loss of 56 cents recorded in the prior-year quarter.First Solar’s sales of $609.2 million in the reported quarter missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $720 million by 15.4%. Moreover, the top line plunged a massive 56.5% from the year-ago quarter’s $1,399.4 million.I mean tesla loses money on its insignificant (and for due cause) energy (aka solar panel) business,.... it loses money on its car business,.... The cult tells us every business tesla is considered to be a start up in (after 20 years of being in business), when it matures, gives them a $1 trillion market cap, and so they deserve that now... and yet when you add up the market caps of all of these (mature) businesses already doing these things, it gives a market cap of $50 to $100 billion.1/10 to 1/20th of $1 trillion.tesla has failed. It's so yesterday.It's time to say good bye to yesterday, not good buy."
"New York has passed legislation that will speed up the siting and construction of clean energy projects and help jumpstart the state’s economic recovery from the COVID-19 health crisis. The Accelerated Renewable Energy Growth and Community Benefit Act will create an Office of Renewable Energy Siting to improve and streamline the process for siting large-scale renewable energy projects across New York while, the first of such in the nation. Prior to this act, renewable projects were sited the same way as fossil-fuel electric generating plants.

At least once a quarter you all need to contribute to the corp. bonuses at the major stock manipulators. I guess they are not waiting for earnings release at the end of the month.
"July 3 (Renewables Now) - Innergex Renewable Energy Inc (TSE:INE) has purchased a 250-MW ready-to-be-built solar project in Texas, which it says is its largest photovoltaic (PV) project to date.The USD-397-million (EUR 341m) Phoebe solar project in Texas’ Winkler county will use First Solar’s (NASDAQ:FSLR) Series 6 thin-film PV modules that are expected to produce an average of 738,000 MWh of power annually."

It is also the first ever certificate issued under the newly formed IECRE conformity assessment system for the PV Sector. The certification was issued by the global safety and certification organization, Underwriters Laboratories (UL)."
"New method for life cycle assessment of PV technologiesThe scientists found that the CdTe technology has the lowest life cycle impact, followed by amorphous, multicrystalline and monocrystalline silicon.The lower impact of the CdTe thin-film technology is attributable to the lower consumption of materials and chemicals in its overall life cycle processes. “In addition, the only significant emission that exists in the whole inventory of CdTe technology is the discharge of cadmium ions into water. The amount of this emission is relatively low compared with the life cycle emissions of other PV plants,” they further explained.https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2020/05/20/new-method-for-life-cycle-assessment-of-pv-technologies/"
Like the project pipeline and adding shares this week. Path to value is clear.
Why is their 5 year PEG negative if they expect to keep growing?
"First Solar analyst commentary at JPMorgan First Solar should be owned on ramping Series 6 production, says JPMorgan. Ramping Series 6 production should yield sequentially higher margin on shipment of previously-booked product sales over the course of 2019, JPMorgan analyst Paul Coster tells investors in a research note. He believes this is a reason to own First Solar shares over the short-term ""as 2020 earnings power comes into focus."" At full capacity in 2021, the company could also emerge with a cost-advantage in the solar photovoltaic panel market, says Coster. He sees a positive risk/reward on First Solar shares and reiterates an Overweight rating with a $70 price target."

Bought on recent strength. Target 60-70 in fall
When do the forced-labor silicon components get banned? I've only heard talk up to this point.
"Despite record demand, logistics chaos clouds First Solar's outlook."
Type in goldman sachs buys solar power and you will see what the real deal is. Don't listen to these news stories trying to take down one of the best innovative companies in renewable energy. Does anybody really trust them??
"$120 target, why?Jim Cramer once found 120/80 stock price rule: when a stock hit $80, its next stop will be $120.Given solar stocks are on fire with a few forming high tight flag pattern, once No.1 solar stock FLSR will play cat-up-game.Today FSLR soldily broke-out, looking for $120 in 1 ont month!"
"I’m thinking with how $BE $PLUG $FCEL $BLDP $SPWR $FSLR and $CSIQ traded the same getting trashed for two week leads me to think a major fund or a few linked were lightening the load. You would have thought you were looking at the same stock with exact up and downswings on the minute. $FSLR pleased someone and the solar stocks broke back up a bit off the overall alternative energy trend. Solid Oxide Fuel Cell leader $BE reports after the bell and the individual companies might start moving on their own again. There is a lot to listen out for on Marine applications, Carbon capture, and their incumbent standard fuel cell that"
It's all about looking forward. Upped 2021 numbers. Great job
The whole market makes new records as this stock goes lower and lower. Then when the market drops by one percentage point this stock sinks down to trigger margin calls.
Anyone know the news in the jump today ?
RSI indicator indicates this is Way Oversold. Look for a bounce shortly to the Fibonacci 50% retrace of 85.08.
"I have traded First Solar for several years, sometimes the stock itself but mainly options on it. It is unique in that the stock price is always so volatile, making option premiums very high. But at the same time it has a rock solid balance sheet and is a leader in a very promising industry. I won't pretend to know what the price of First Solar will be next week or next month. It could fall to $40 or rebound back to the mid $70s. However, after falling 25% in the last week, a few things to keep in mind regarding the stock's fundamentals:FSLR has a price/book of 1.1. A lot of times companies with an extremely low p/b have a lot of intangibles, or inventory that they cannot sell at carrying cost or at all, so there book value is not real. Not the case here; FSLR has $32/share of cash and receivables. EPS in 2019 will probably be somewhere between $3.00 and $3.50, so it is now trading 16-17x 2019's earnings. Not exactly a deep value. Hypothetically, if the company gave away $30/share in cash and the stock price dropped equivalently, you would be looking at a p/e of only 10, making the stock appear much more attractive. Of course the company is much better off with it's hoard of cash though, which will be used for capital investments/further expansion, paying off debt, and possibly dividends/buybacks in the future.EPS estimates 3 years from now are $7.00 with a book value per share of $60-$65. I do not think these are overly pessimistic or optimistic, but believe they are somewhat conservative. Using a p/e of 15 and p/b of 1.8, would put the stock at $105. Discounted back to today using discount rate of 7-10%, puts the current value of the stock in the high 70s or low 80s. I have read the downgrade reports from JPM and BAC, and they are pretty glib. There is no concrete analysis; the thesis is simply that China eliminating/reducing solar development will cause Chinese solar companies to dump their product in the U.S., causing an oversupply, hurting prices and all solar companies (even the ones without any China exposure). However, First solar is booked solid for the next two years and has superior technology. You could even counter that not only would the China move not hurt FSLR, it very well may help them by driving much of the competition out of business over the next few years. Also, keep in mind that China is fickle like the U.S. in that policy decisions such as this are not permanent and can be modified or reversed.Thanks for reading."
"TEMPE, Az., May 30, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- First Solar, Inc.

It doesnt look like the street loved the news. We will have to wait and see how everyone digest it as they start to dig in more. Maybe this created a buying opportunity. The best way to beat the market is to invest in Small Cap stocks like this one too. http://cannabisstockdelivery.market/PotentialRunner
"Unfortunately, this time too, it feels like seeing a film that has already been seen"
"Going to roll the dice and start a new, small position in this stock. I realize that it is close to their all-time high but very promising with either candidate winning the election. After doing my research, this is the name that kept popping up."
BP wants to be all green. I think fslr executives should make contact and see if they can make a deal
Only earnings info actually says anything. The rest is BS for profit and short term gain.
"Solid entry point, I’m not one of these fangirls that buy cult stocks at extraordinary P/Es...this is a good opportunity to pick up a long position in the green sector which is now ready to flourish."

"""DNV GL, an accreditation and research group, sees Canada and the United States increasing population and wealth, yet still lowering total energy use by 30% while shifting toward almost 90% CO2 free electricity by the year 2050.The analysis suggests that 24% of electricity in the two countries will come from photovoltaics by 2050, totaling just over 1.7 petawatt-hours that year. This will be generated by a total of 962 GWac of solar power, which by the late 2020s will start to be installed at 35 to 45 GWac of capacity per year. This volume slowly increases to an AC capacity factor of 20% by the end of the period.""To put that in perspective, 1,000 gigawatts installed in the next 30 years, 35 to 45 GWac per year for North America, FSLR's prime market. FSLR's production capacity after their current production expansion will only be 7.5 GWac.

"First Solar added to Analyst Focus List at JPMorganJPMorgan analyst Paul Coster added First Solar to his firm's Analyst Focus List as a near-term idea. The recent pullback in the shares, induced by the Chinese policy reset and ""weak"" Q2 results, presents investors with a buying opportunity, Coster tells investors in a research note. The analyst views Fist Solar as ""best-in-class"" in the solar space, with ""industry-leading"" gross margins, balance sheet, and visibility reaching through 2020.

"Thank you so much, perfect timing! We just needed a credible pretext such as a downgrade to make up for such a fall. This time the quarterly report has even been brought forward but the result will not change anyway. It will always end the same way: the gains of the few require the losses of the many."
"Stock performed much better than the pack today. City upgrade helped. The analyst pointed that fslr is the most natural recipient of “green drive” benefits. It is the main US-based solar equipment producer, in other words both green and patriotic."
What a gift at this price.
What is going on?
If we make it past 73.40 and this stock will rocket past $80 ... hopefully this week
"Another round, another gift! Let'go folks!"
Train leaving the station. That’s what everyone is saying
