"you can never go wrong, investing in a consumables business like kmb"
"Huge debt this will fall further, once people buy TP they won't need any for 6 months"
"I really want to buy KMB, but I can't get past sales being below where they were higher a decade ago. You cannot say that about many high quality companies. Which begs the question, is this still a high quality company that justifies an investment?"
People buying here will lose
4% yield - this is better than a 10 year bond.
Order set at $128.79
"Fundamentals and valuation look rock solid. I'm assuming the steep drop is driven by inflation concerns, expected rising yield, and unfavorable year-over-year comps on the TP business. But all that seems baked in at this P/E ratio and dividend yield.Looking at buying 100 shares and selling $130 covered call against them to get $6 premium per share. Is anyone doing a similar CC strategy?"
What would happened if it didn't exceed expectations?
"KMB stock is being priced rationally:1. The stock has done nothing for a long time (in line with very mild expectations)2. The comparison to earnings during the heart of the pandemic is artificial and easily dismissed - we saw the same thing with stocks like Campbell's Soup3. Wood pulp prices normalize over time (and perhaps not coincidentally lumber topped out in May)4. All companies in this sector will be able to pass along some price increases5. This company continues to take steps to improve its efficiency (look up the FORCE program), even incorporating digital supply chain management toolsAll that being said, from a trading standpoint the strategy of ""buy KMB at 130, sell at 140"" still looks like it will make you money in the near future."
Buy buy buy
are they manipulating too?
"I'm back in...near its 52 week low, good dividend, ex date not pending, low beta, decent PE....a little room to run from here...."
Dead money for awhile
GLAD I SOLD !Word of the Day IsNow.........
Still growing revenues ?
Short
This dip will last 2 days.... the opportunity is fleeting
"Best idea in this sector is little know GPK. Worth exploring given environmental packaging focus and a great Q, not yet reflected in price, IMO"
"2 months ago I bought this for 129.40. You (post) millenials aren't investors. Just whiners with no understanding of financial markets at all--no surprise, look at your education."
"I hold stock in 85 companies, mostly S & P 500. KMB the only one in the plus today."
Kimberly-Clark reached an all time high at 152.30
3/27/18 - Up 3% why? so it can down 3.5% tomorrow?
Awesome news.... wanted to by some back at 130 and missed out... may still have a chance!!!! Buy buy buy
Why down today?
"I look it it this way....everytime sombody drops the duece, I get paid.."
It's going up like a rocket ship.
Should be slowly climbing to $140 ish tomorrow.Go KMB
This stock floundering around like SJM did the last quarter. Then SJM came out and beat earnings. SJM has jumped $27 a share since then. What has happened at KMB that has caused stock to drop? Waiting for further drop and then I will get in
"clx and kmb, will give the flu, the old one, two punch"
Don’t open a position in KMB until you hear what (http://Rightpicker.com) has to say about it. These guys give amazing insights like no other service.
What happened at end of day? Dropped about 50 cents in about 5-10 minutes.
"I bought today , do I get the dividend ?"
"On May 11, 2020 Ned Davis Research Group upgraded KIMBERLY CLARK CORP ( KMB) from NEUTRAL to BUY."
155 to 148 in how many days
"What's gong on here, any idea why down so much?"
April earnings are going to be very nice. But in this market...who knows. Better stock up on more TP.
wow
$1.14 quarterly dividend per share. Not a bad hold.
"In Wed, out Fri. Nice trade."
"Why this falls one day before you need to buy to get the dividend, don't know."
Smart to release earnings a day earlier.Not a bad report considering price. At 4% yield this will attract value investors and funds.
KMB reached a new 52 Week Low at 103.43
Still looks pricey. I don't like it.
"I don't feel like tax cut impact is priced into this stock....just going down down down, yet they currently have tax rate over 30%...will be cut to around 21% thanks to Uncle Trump. This has never been a very tax efficient company. Big Buy here."
last qtr at .97 and then we raise. ex-div today but down more than .97 :(
Why? 3.15% green today.
the outcome must be income
"Well, I spent $55 on Amazon and purchased 50 USA-made Kimberly-Clark N95s. They are duck-billed shape so I used non-toxic paint to add nostrils and a splash of yellow flair.) They are both durable and comfortable. I'm happily very long KMB!"
"This is interesting....was in a big box store yesterday. No T.P., paper towels, few paper plates and facial Tissues I was surprised. I asked the manager what happened. He told me that people are stocking upBecause the weather is getting colder and they are afraid of a second round of the China virus. I guess the # 1 gift this Xmas will be T P"
Pricy still!!
Forcing the price down hoping for a good divvy? Such soft lads!
Missed by 2 cents this morning and down to $115.90 pre-market. Anyone buying near these levels. Stock has been selling off for months now.
KMB is up 5.00% to 128.43
Adding next week
KMB reached a new 52 Week Low at 108.41
I sure hope the upcoming Huggies Super Bowl commercial is clever!
Pretty sure $KMB used to make a product to compete with Tampax. Good for bleeding longs.
back to where we were 11 mon. ago and still no split and we still have the same guy in there. unreal
I think there is a good chance of a baby boom about the beginning of next year with all the people home with nothing to do. KMB would benefit as well as anybody I think.
"Listen up peeps, our population, no the world population is aging. This demographic needs thenKMB PRODUCTS. Depends and the like. So do not sell. If this stock was no good it would be 59 bucks. It pays a dividend and is solid. Do you make any interest in your bank account? No, can you make this yield with low risk no. Your tech is volatile."
Cramer said $KMB was a good stock about a week ago.
KMB is one of my favorite dividend growth stocks. I talk about dividend growth stocks on my youtube channel. The channel is really focused on new and beginner investors looking to invest in dividend growth stocks and ETFs. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrg6IDPf4a7pUKTN90n6syg
"Well we got the guy Out Faulk now we get this guy ? same old story a money guy we need a split , should have split at 80 a share 3 for 1 would be great then i'll by more ."
"It’s official !,,!! The shelves are empty. I had to stock up on the usual paper products plus diapers and wipes.They were limiting the amount of each item."
"Glad to see some recovery, but honestly this is a great company and they warned us 2021 would slow down a bit. However market ALWAYS overreacts on misses. Buy buy buy. When the interest rates continue to climb you will see this claim with it :-)"
Where’s the selling pressure coming from? Great company and great numbers!
Kimberly-Clark is down 4.96% to 141.02
time for a 3 for 1 split
KMB reached a new 52 Week Low at 101.10
"100% electric vehicles are not a fad! Yet Toyota has continued to drag its feet on creating one. Other companies such as VW, GM and Ford have jumped on the opportunity and shareholders have been rewarded. Hybrids may be the short term game but, electric is for the long haul."
After short squeeze to Gme and others.. Kmb to escalate.. Those shorters will need diapers to sleep..
Seems like nothing but tech goes up anymore
Why is it up 4.16% after hours? It’s $136.94 now. Cant find any news.
"I love picking up a great company at a discount, especially when they have a solid increasing dividend. In 10 years a quarterly miss on expectations is meaningless. If it goes to that 110 long term support I'll pick up more. I can see where some may be disappointed with this drop, especially when tech and other high fliers are making folks rich, but these guys will slowly move up over time, unless we stop wiping our noses and other parts. :)"
Toilet paper is not selling out anymore
Kimberly-Clark is up 5.56% to 140.09
$165 to $170 within 2 months
Splits are history.A lot of pla cd es you order fractional share
KBM is only worth to buy when it is at $123 a share.
LOOK OUT FOR PG ITS IN THE FAST LANE.
I play stocks just before they go ex div and buy 1000 shares. They always move a buck and I sell and don't wait for the ex date. The stock usually loses more than the gain in one day. I play PFE and T the same way. So far it has worked and I am already out of KMB with $1k profit. Not big money but a profit is a profit.
Wow longs here gettin' clapped good today.
I had it with this kmb. Purchaser in April @ 136 and other than the div. it’s going nowhere. I bought coup at the same time and it doubled. I’m selling this today to write off loss and buy some apple.
don't they sell masks? 3m up 3. why are we down 3?
Finally a good day :)
"With the all time high 149, Kmb is not looking bad."
Finally it popped
Check out $KMB. Solid earnings. Look at the chart. It's about to break out. Don't you know that Kimbly Clark also makes masks and protective coveralls. You all heard the news that people got into fight when stockpiling toilet papers.
"A lot of dreaming going on here. Just look at the financials. Negative growth, contractions in moneys down the board. Only accounting gimmicks gave them better EPS.Is this the sign of a strong economy or a rigged market? https://kimberlyclark.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/kimberly-clark-announces-second-quarter-2019-resultsInstitutions own too much of this company and they will work very hard to keep prices overvalued until they can pawn this thing off."

"One of the best consumer defensives around, coming into my range..."
Initiated position. This is a blue chip and evergreen stock. $130s is great entry. Dividend aristocrat. Weekly options.
Pretty big beat for such a stable company.
"It is my intention to keep buying both stocks indefinitely as I sell the call options. Once all the options are sold in my portfolio, the only investments I will own will be KMB & PG common stock."
Tom is worst ceo ever.
Market does not like stocks with little or no growth...this is going down even more in the next few weeks.
a good 3 for 1 split we need
"Not sure where we go from here , not looking good hope for the best ."
The DEBT load of this company is unreal....best wake up.....
Buy buy buy! I have like 3000 shares now.
"dang, sold my calls a tad early haha. missed out on an extra buck or two"
We need a 3 for 1 split will drive this stock a lot higher
Bought at $129.89
Huge revenue miss
"holding up off the low, but I am afraid this is dead money until next earnings now."
after earning report will be back at 140. great value hard to find right now.
why panick sell off?
Kimberly-Clark is up 4.98% to 138.80
"At these levels, this is a big buy. With that dividend, I’ll buy this all day long."
How is this not much higher with tp hording?
Div moving to 1.06 in the morning?
jan 25 2020 earnings report
Guys what do you think about these guys and Colgate and Clorox when you combine all three it’s a PG behemoth
thoughts on monday morning?
Did I hear correctly .. the CEO of kmb will be on CNBC after the closing bell.??????
Looks like a nice entry point. Temporary difficulty related to covid hoarding. Picking up some for a long term secure dividend.
Maybe K-C should buy Owens and Minor and get part of their Healthcare business back?
buy PG
liking it....getting more
"Its the time CEO leaves Kimberly Clark ,Self made guy who makes the money for him self not the share holders .should have split long ago get on the ball board of directors get him out"
This great stock gets no love
KMB needs to get in to the paper straw business. It's exploding
I like this company a bit but need $120 to enter...
More today...thanks...
Laying off 5000 people to make up for lack of sales. I always hated cutting instead of growing but I do understand it.
what is going on with this stock?
"A few days ago, Procter & Gamble announced they will increase the prices of their products by 4% to offset higher costs. If most producers start doing this, margins will be better. It gives Kimberly-Clark a chance to increase the prices of its products too. All this is speculation on my part; since I am not part of the financial milieu, I cannot confirm this. It is only my humble guess to why KMB price climbed lately."
Why is this not moving on such a solid earnings and corporate announcements?
not looking good. Paid more in div than they generated from operations
CRAMERS....Street Article Today....SAYS.... SELL !
Will you be happy to look back at 2021 owning a fairly valued stock? Absolutely! This is a core holding in our accounts that look for an inflation-adjusted income.
It's as though no one is ever going to have to wipe their #$%$ ever again
Steve you are right the CEO has to go
"Good company with good new CEO. I like his vision, it can be 200 easy"
a big drop time to buy or get a new board this should have split at 80.00 a share ? well it just might when it gets back down there ?
Bought more on Friday. 52 week lows and adding
upgrade
This was priced for a $5 move by week's end. Glad to see earnings isn't moving it that much pre-market.
"I'm long on KMB. The current price to book ratio for Kimberly-Clark as of August 13, 2021 is 60.64. I read that a good PB Ratio is under 1 which indicates a Value Stock ... I always thought of KMB as a Value Stock but the very high PB is confusing. Can anyone help me understand?"
"Its not Cost, its the CEO another replacement of the last guy time to get him out to and also split the stock ."
"I bought some shares of $KMB today!!! Seems like a steal at these prices. If it goes below $100, I'm gonna pick up another huge chunk!!"
Who’s stealing market share?
Kimberly-Clark reached an all time high at 154.26
"This is from someone in the know. In February KMB's sales were up 60%. Of course you have to realize those sales will be robbing future sales. But, I can't imagine selling KMB. If there is one product you will keep on buying, it will be bath tissue. Sam's Club is stocking paper towels and bath tissue 4 times a day."
"Missed sales and income estimates, and lowered guidance. Stock down over a five year period when the market is hitting record highs. Management is making excuses."
I said 5 years ago the CEO needs to be replaced
"I am so happy to have Kimberly-Clark Stocks--I would like to compliment the CEO and Board Members on the wonderful job they are doing with this Company, please keep up the good work. I would like to greet you all in person but am ready for my 97th Birthday, so that ,makes it impossible for me to travel, so please accept my sincere thanks for your excellent work..Thank you.

"It's tough comparing sales to same quarter last year during the paper craze - of course sales volume is down in comparison to that period. Also, high input costs are eroding margins, but this should level as commodity prices normalize for pulp/wood/etc. - I'm a little jittery, but this company still has strong brands behind it - I'll hold for now"
We all know what the future brings on this stock. Wait fot the earnings and buy in the low 20s
Several years of declining income. Time for a shake up beginning at the top!
Trying to figure out a realistic price target for KMB in the next year. Any opinions people?
Is $100 next ?
Kimberly Clark $KMB Reverses After Last Week's Earnings Pop... http://bit.ly/KMBTrade
"Yes, it’s moving toward $139 range end of this month"
"My investment strategy involves purchasing these call options for both stocks; in fact, I personally own over 56,000 call option contracts, most of which are LEAPS, as of today. As I sell these call options for large profits, I will use the proceeds to buy both of the stocks long and add them to my portfolio."
"The whole consumer staples sector is hated all of a sudden, this is classic herding by investors. It is very hard to make money by following the herd."
"Crazy people selling Kimberly Clark. Good company, good dividend. I’ll hold on"
Still growing revenues

"Todays price is the same as it was in February 2016, 5 years ago. Not great, but since the recent pullback, it looks like a buying opportunity in a few more weeks."
Selling all my shares! I?m done with this #$%$ company
"The kind of stock you don’t sell IMHO, good luck to all."
Great earnings. Expecting above 140s today during the regular trading session.
Is anyone aware that they have negative equity on the balance sheet and not enough cash and receivables to cover accounts payable? Who is buying this?
KMB will shut down another place in Wi. . but leave the one they got the big money running how nice .the day they got the money it went up over 4 bucks a share
$KMB is a fixed income stock.
"On a down day like today, S&P corrects about 2.41% and KMB stays green, it gives credence to its stability. Good luck longs."
3.5% yield
"Chart looks awful. People talking about a dividend, meanwhile getting clobbered by a basic market ETF."
I am so sad. I wanted to buy this morning but don’t have any more money
"Might be down today, getting more if so."
PG CRUSHED EARNINGS MUCH BETTER COMPANY THEN KMB .
“Covid 19”mask maker. Surgical blue mask. How will that play out reflecting stock price.
KMB reached a new 52 Week Low at 106.34
look at $KMB warning. This is biggest direct beneficiary with covid. They have sell out everything and stock gone higher. and now it's projecting lower demand.Zoom is worst because it hardly worth 1/10th if we seen peak usage and soon reach peak revenue. Zoom currently facing 10's new entry and big/powerful pushing into market. Overall market isn't huge. At best we talking $50B at best of best of best scenario and Zoom can't keep even 10% market share (Even today they have < 20%).Careful what you paying for growth.
Can anyone explain to me the drop in price? Solid company with solid dividend IMO
People definitely will be needing more tp after looking at the recent performance of their 401Ks.
Was hoping it would stay under 130…. Maybe it will fall back but wasn’t expecting this bounce back…
Hey guys what do you think about Kimberly Clark and PG vs store brands do you feel the store brands are eating away at them or do you think store brands are still made by these guys
"Looks like this company is going full out ""diversity and inclusion."" What next, BLM funders?"
"Has anyone tried the Huggins dryNites?. They are great !,,,"
this is too much already... no support at all.. whenever somebody is buying the stock went negative..
Sold most of my KMB
I guess the street didn't like the numbers? down 6% over 8 points
Thinking the play on this is a PMCC with the Jan 2023 $120 calls and selling $138 CC's each week...will make killing and only costs about $19.50 in premium so making about 2% a week for the foreseeable future...not too shabby if you ask me. Thoughts?
earnings out
"Got to check this out, updates daily and gives all the short info for the past twenty days https://marketwirenews.com/short-information/NYSE/KMB"
This is a buy-and-hold-forever company. Pandemic-proof. today's dip was a chance for me to pick up a few more shares.

Thanks for the profits shorts!
"Do they hand out free Depends for the Board of Directors meetings ? This stock has done almost nothing in 5 years, during one of the greatest bull markets in US history."

"What's the drag on consumer staples today? Own KMB, CPB, HSY and GIS. All have done nicely. Now all are down 1-2%. No panic just curious."
Are they pumping out the masks yet? When willbthat go full production?
Looks like an earnings beat and raised guidance. Now for the market reaction.
Kimberly-Clark is down 4.92% to 133.43
$6 give back. This stock is painful to own. Should have sold calls at $118.Small support here at 112.
Gotta love those plant based diapers. Gonna get me some!
Good short here?....
KMB has a nice upcoming dividend
Sector rotation. May want to add if it gets under 130
"My only concern here is what will they do to grow. Supposedly they will be fixing up the financials and potentially selling consumer tissue segment. However, what happens after that? This is the kind of company Warren Buffet would like to buy. I just don't see any real interesting growth happening without a major acquisition/merger."
Sold my shares today broke even - this thing trades Badly.... if you are thinking about taking a position - PASS
KMB and GPK both look very interesting at these levels.
What’s up with the 5 points up?
we just sold all kmb since they succumbed to leftist radical pressure to drop the name MAN SIZE TISSUES.THANKS FOR A GREAT TIME TOGETGER
Kimberly-Clark reported organic sales growing 3% in Q2. FY guidance has a mid point of $6.05 which is lower than the street's $6.09 $KMB
