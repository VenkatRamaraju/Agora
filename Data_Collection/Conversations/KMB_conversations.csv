"A lot of dreaming going on here. Just look at the financials. Negative growth, contractions in moneys down the board. Only accounting gimmicks gave them better EPS.Is this the sign of a strong economy or a rigged market? https://kimberlyclark.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/kimberly-clark-announces-second-quarter-2019-resultsInstitutions own too much of this company and they will work very hard to keep prices overvalued until they can pawn this thing off."
Cramer said $KMB was a good stock about a week ago.
Order set at $128
Finally a good day :)
don't they sell masks? 3m up 3. why are we down 3?
look at $KMB warning. This is biggest direct beneficiary with covid. They have sell out everything and stock gone higher. and now it's projecting lower demand.Zoom is worst because it hardly worth 1/10th if we seen peak usage and soon reach peak revenue. Zoom currently facing 10's new entry and big/powerful pushing into market. Overall market isn't huge. At best we talking $50B at best of best of best scenario and Zoom can't keep even 10% market share (Even today they have < 20%).Careful what you paying for growth.
"Crazy people selling Kimberly Clark. Good company, good dividend. I’ll hold on"
Looks like a nice entry point. Temporary difficulty related to covid hoarding. Picking up some for a long term secure dividend.
The DEBT load of this company is unreal....best wake up.....
Buy buy buy! I have like 3000 shares now.
Finally it popped
This stock floundering around like SJM did the last quarter. Then SJM came out and beat earnings. SJM has jumped $27 a share since then. What has happened at KMB that has caused stock to drop? Waiting for further drop and then I will get in
Bought more at 125.50
"Patience to the Short side on this one, not gonna Cover here, looking for continued price degradation as the morning progresses..."
Was hoping it would stay under 130…. Maybe it will fall back but wasn’t expecting this bounce back…
Laying off 5000 people to make up for lack of sales. I always hated cutting instead of growing but I do understand it.
This stock needs to correct down to the $100-110 range. It’s going nowhere and the dividend is not enough to interest me at this point.
Anyone have an feeling where the bleeding stops ?
"Here it is, wave of selling pressure right at the open, stock collapses to a brand new 52 week low as she can't hold $128... Looking VERY weak for the day!"
not looking good. Paid more in div than they generated from operations
“Covid 19”mask maker. Surgical blue mask. How will that play out reflecting stock price.
"Listen up peeps, our population, no the world population is aging. This demographic needs thenKMB PRODUCTS. Depends and the like. So do not sell. If this stock was no good it would be 59 bucks. It pays a dividend and is solid. Do you make any interest in your bank account? No, can you make this yield with low risk no. Your tech is volatile."
Pretty big beat for such a stable company.
I guess the street didn't like the numbers? down 6% over 8 points
What would happened if it didn't exceed expectations?
"KMB was significantly over-valued even before today's really bad earnings release. Now, it is even more so. This stock should be trading at the $115 level. But...it is one of those old-timey stocks that has a lot of long-term holders, and it does not attract a lot of day and momentum traders. It will be interesting to see if, at the open, we do get a wave of momentum short-sellers and/or day-traders who recognize the opportunity to drive this down to sub $120 on the basis of this morning's terrible ER. I doubt it will go that low, but am eager to stay Short until at least 3 PM ET to see how low she can go. I do NOT see any serious upside risk for today. There is no reason for this to even touch $130 for the entire day."
"I love picking up a great company at a discount, especially when they have a solid increasing dividend. In 10 years a quarterly miss on expectations is meaningless. If it goes to that 110 long term support I'll pick up more. I can see where some may be disappointed with this drop, especially when tech and other high fliers are making folks rich, but these guys will slowly move up over time, unless we stop wiping our noses and other parts. :)"
"A few days ago, Procter & Gamble announced they will increase the prices of their products by 4% to offset higher costs. If most producers start doing this, margins will be better. It gives Kimberly-Clark a chance to increase the prices of its products too. All this is speculation on my part; since I am not part of the financial milieu, I cannot confirm this. It is only my humble guess to why KMB price climbed lately."
KMB reached a new 52 Week Low at 108.41
Buy buy buy
"Happy to be Short a lot of shares at $132.50 as a Pure Earnings Short Sell play. This one is poised to hit a brand new 52 week low, dipping under $128.02 today, in direct response to a weak and disappointing quarterly earnings report, with lots of uncertainty going forward."
"I am so happy to have Kimberly-Clark Stocks--I would like to compliment the CEO and Board Members on the wonderful job they are doing with this Company, please keep up the good work. I would like to greet you all in person but am ready for my 97th Birthday, so that ,makes it impossible for me to travel, so please accept my sincere thanks for your excellent work..Thank you. OLD GRANNY H."
earnings out
Why doesn’t the Kimberly-Clark Corporation merge with the Clorox Company? There appear to be many synergy between the two.
Can anyone explain to me the drop in price? Solid company with solid dividend IMO
"I'm long on KMB. The current price to book ratio for Kimberly-Clark as of August 13, 2021 is 60.64. I read that a good PB Ratio is under 1 which indicates a Value Stock ... I always thought of KMB as a Value Stock but the very high PB is confusing. Can anyone help me understand?"
"I bought today , do I get the dividend ?"
Sector rotation. May want to add if it gets under 130
"Why this falls one day before you need to buy to get the dividend, don't know."
"I hold stock in 85 companies, mostly S & P 500. KMB the only one in the plus today."
Why? 3.15% green today.
Dead money for awhile
"It is my intention to keep buying both stocks indefinitely as I sell the call options. Once all the options are sold in my portfolio, the only investments I will own will be KMB & PG common stock."
In at $130.75
Buy the dip worked for me!!!
I play stocks just before they go ex div and buy 1000 shares. They always move a buck and I sell and don't wait for the ex date. The stock usually loses more than the gain in one day. I play PFE and T the same way. So far it has worked and I am already out of KMB with $1k profit. Not big money but a profit is a profit.
2nd order set at $127.00
$1.14 quarterly dividend per share. Not a bad hold.
"The whole consumer staples sector is hated all of a sudden, this is classic herding by investors. It is very hard to make money by following the herd."
How much further down are we going to go? $120?
"What's gong on here, any idea why down so much?"
Initiated position. This is a blue chip and evergreen stock. $130s is great entry. Dividend aristocrat. Weekly options.
buy PG
It's as though no one is ever going to have to wipe their #$%$ ever again
Splits are history.A lot of pla cd es you order fractional share
What’s up with the 5 points up?
Wow longs here gettin' clapped good today.
People definitely will be needing more tp after looking at the recent performance of their 401Ks.
Kimberly-Clark is up 4.98% to 138.80
Why down today?
"Looks like this company is going full out ""diversity and inclusion."" What next, BLM funders?"
"On a down day like today, S&P corrects about 2.41% and KMB stays green, it gives credence to its stability. Good luck longs."
"The kind of stock you don’t sell IMHO, good luck to all."
meanwhile every piece of tp at costco is sold out and I see every neighbor unloading 2 jumbo packs
Smart to release earnings a day earlier.Not a bad report considering price. At 4% yield this will attract value investors and funds.
"It is good to be Short!Kimberly-Clark Corp. shares fell 2.7% in Monday premarket trading after the consumer goods company reported third-quarter earnings that missed expectations and lowered its earnings guidance. Net income totaled $469 million, or $1.39 per share, compared with $472 million, or $1.38 per share, last year. Adjusted EPS of $1.62 missed the FactSet consensus for $1.65."
"Earnings are out and the numbers are quite weak with very lukewarm forward Guidance. Stock is selling off in the pre-market in direct response to this poor ER, and I expect further price degradation throughout the day. Will look to Cover at -$127.00. This is looking like yet another successful Pure Earnings Short Sell play. :-) Kimberly-Clark MissesKimberly-Clark (KMB) reported 3rd Quarter September 2021 earnings of $1.62 per share on revenue of $5.0 billion. The consensus earnings estimate was $1.66 per share on revenue of $5.0 billion. Revenue grew 7.0% on a year-over-year basis.The company said it expects 2021 earnings of $6.05 to $6.25 per share on revenue of $18.76 billion to $18.95 billion. The company's previous guidance was earnings of $6.65 to $6.90 per share on revenue of $18.76 billion to $19.14 billion and the current consensus earnings estimate is $6.65 per share on revenue of $19.44 billion for the year ending December 31, 2021."
It's going up like a rocket ship.
I think there is a good chance of a baby boom about the beginning of next year with all the people home with nothing to do. KMB would benefit as well as anybody I think.
I had it with this kmb. Purchaser in April @ 136 and other than the div. it’s going nowhere. I bought coup at the same time and it doubled. I’m selling this today to write off loss and buy some apple.
"It's tough comparing sales to same quarter last year during the paper craze - of course sales volume is down in comparison to that period. Also, high input costs are eroding margins, but this should level as commodity prices normalize for pulp/wood/etc. - I'm a little jittery, but this company still has strong brands behind it - I'll hold for now"
This dip will last 2 days.... the opportunity is fleeting
"Well, I spent $55 on Amazon and purchased 50 USA-made Kimberly-Clark N95s. They are duck-billed shape so I used non-toxic paint to add nostrils and a splash of yellow flair.) They are both durable and comfortable. I'm happily very long KMB!"
KMB will shut down another place in Wi. . but leave the one they got the big money running how nice .the day they got the money it went up over 4 bucks a share
"This is from someone in the know. In February KMB's sales were up 60%. Of course you have to realize those sales will be robbing future sales. But, I can't imagine selling KMB. If there is one product you will keep on buying, it will be bath tissue. Sam's Club is stocking paper towels and bath tissue 4 times a day."
Is $100 next ?
"Fundamentals and valuation look rock solid. I'm assuming the steep drop is driven by inflation concerns, expected rising yield, and unfavorable year-over-year comps on the TP business. But all that seems baked in at this P/E ratio and dividend yield.Looking at buying 100 shares and selling $130 covered call against them to get $6 premium per share. Is anyone doing a similar CC strategy?"
"While the stock hasn’t gone up much in ages, you really can’t push the stock down either. Every time it goes below 130 it return to 130 very quickly."
Thinking the play on this is a PMCC with the Jan 2023 $120 calls and selling $138 CC's each week...will make killing and only costs about $19.50 in premium so making about 2% a week for the foreseeable future...not too shabby if you ask me. Thoughts?
"This is interesting....was in a big box store yesterday. No T.P., paper towels, few paper plates and facial Tissues I was surprised. I asked the manager what happened. He told me that people are stocking upBecause the weather is getting colder and they are afraid of a second round of the China virus. I guess the # 1 gift this Xmas will be T P"
"I really want to buy KMB, but I can't get past sales being below where they were higher a decade ago. You cannot say that about many high quality companies. Which begs the question, is this still a high quality company that justifies an investment?"
"Stock is breaking down again here, should lose $126 very soon..."
Awesome news.... wanted to by some back at 130 and missed out... may still have a chance!!!! Buy buy buy
"At these levels, this is a big buy. With that dividend, I’ll buy this all day long."
"Good company with good new CEO. I like his vision, it can be 200 easy"
KMB can increase prices to keep up with inflation and supply chain issues. People still need to wipe their noses and #$%$ Competitors will most likely experience the same issues. Definitely buying this dip.
"Congrats! It has done nothing for four years. Guess it needs to take on some more debt, lol…."
Adding next week
This is another has been dividend stock…
"It’s official !,,!! The shelves are empty. I had to stock up on the usual paper products plus diapers and wipes.They were limiting the amount of each item."
This great stock gets no love
Will wait to buy under $129
Kimberly-Clark reached a 52 Week low at 126.63
KMB has a nice upcoming dividend
"KMB stock is being priced rationally:1. The stock has done nothing for a long time (in line with very mild expectations)2. The comparison to earnings during the heart of the pandemic is artificial and easily dismissed - we saw the same thing with stocks like Campbell's Soup3. Wood pulp prices normalize over time (and perhaps not coincidentally lumber topped out in May)4. All companies in this sector will be able to pass along some price increases5. This company continues to take steps to improve its efficiency (look up the FORCE program), even incorporating digital supply chain management toolsAll that being said, from a trading standpoint the strategy of ""buy KMB at 130, sell at 140"" still looks like it will make you money in the near future."
Gotta love those plant based diapers. Gonna get me some!
initiated position at 125.90
we just sold all kmb since they succumbed to leftist radical pressure to drop the name MAN SIZE TISSUES.THANKS FOR A GREAT TIME TOGETGER
Short
thoughts on monday morning?
Why?
Kimberly-Clark is down 4.99% to 126.40
Why is this not moving on such a solid earnings and corporate announcements?
"My investment strategy involves purchasing these call options for both stocks; in fact, I personally own over 56,000 call option contracts, most of which are LEAPS, as of today. As I sell these call options for large profits, I will use the proceeds to buy both of the stocks long and add them to my portfolio."
KMB reached a new 52 Week Low at 103.43
Can’t wait for open!!! Gonna be a good day to add!
$KMB is a fixed income stock.
Bought more on Friday. 52 week lows and adding
Kimberly-Clark is down 4.92% to 133.43
Will you be happy to look back at 2021 owning a fairly valued stock? Absolutely! This is a core holding in our accounts that look for an inflation-adjusted income.
"Once again, very fast recovery to 130$"
Still growing revenues
April earnings are going to be very nice. But in this market...who knows. Better stock up on more TP.
PG vs. KMB ? Rational comment please .
"Todays price is the same as it was in February 2016, 5 years ago. Not great, but since the recent pullback, it looks like a buying opportunity in a few more weeks."
"Missed sales and income estimates, and lowered guidance. Stock down over a five year period when the market is hitting record highs. Management is making excuses."
now higher than before earnings LMAO
what is going on with this stock?
This is a buy-and-hold-forever company. Pandemic-proof. today's dip was a chance for me to pick up a few more shares.
Market does not like stocks with little or no growth...this is going down even more in the next few weeks.

"you can never go wrong, investing in a consumables business like kmb"
Why is it up 4.16% after hours? It’s $136.94 now. Cant find any news.
Seems like nothing but tech goes up anymore
Huge revenue miss
"Do they hand out free Depends for the Board of Directors meetings ? This stock has done almost nothing in 5 years, during one of the greatest bull markets in US history."
"What's the drag on consumer staples today? Own KMB, CPB, HSY and GIS. All have done nicely. Now all are down 1-2%. No panic just curious."
Definitely Trump 2020 again.
"I don't feel like tax cut impact is priced into this stock....just going down down down, yet they currently have tax rate over 30%...will be cut to around 21% thanks to Uncle Trump. This has never been a very tax efficient company. Big Buy here."
after earning report will be back at 140. great value hard to find right now.
Did I hear correctly .. the CEO of kmb will be on CNBC after the closing bell.??????
Trying to figure out a realistic price target for KMB in the next year. Any opinions people?
Great earnings. Expecting above 140s today during the regular trading session.
Div moving to 1.06 in the morning?
4% yield - this is better than a 10 year bond.
"Glad to see some recovery, but honestly this is a great company and they warned us 2021 would slow down a bit. However market ALWAYS overreacts on misses. Buy buy buy. When the interest rates continue to climb you will see this claim with it :-)"
I like this company a bit but need $120 to enter...
Order set at $128.79
why panick sell off?
best stonk eva
