"KMB was significantly over-valued even before today's really bad earnings release. Now, it is even more so. This stock should be trading at the $115 level. But...it is one of those old-timey stocks that has a lot of long-term holders, and it does not attract a lot of day and momentum traders. It will be interesting to see if, at the open, we do get a wave of momentum short-sellers and/or day-traders who recognize the opportunity to drive this down to sub $120 on the basis of this morning's terrible ER. I doubt it will go that low, but am eager to stay Short until at least 3 PM ET to see how low she can go. I do NOT see any serious upside risk for today. There is no reason for this to even touch $130 for the entire day."
Anyone have an feeling where the bleeding stops ?
now higher than before earnings LMAO
"Do they hand out free Depends for the Board of Directors meetings ? This stock has done almost nothing in 5 years, during one of the greatest bull markets in US history."
Order set at $128
meanwhile every piece of tp at costco is sold out and I see every neighbor unloading 2 jumbo packs
I play stocks just before they go ex div and buy 1000 shares. They always move a buck and I sell and don't wait for the ex date. The stock usually loses more than the gain in one day. I play PFE and T the same way. So far it has worked and I am already out of KMB with $1k profit. Not big money but a profit is a profit.
What would happened if it didn't exceed expectations?
This is a buy-and-hold-forever company. Pandemic-proof. today's dip was a chance for me to pick up a few more shares.
"I love picking up a great company at a discount, especially when they have a solid increasing dividend. In 10 years a quarterly miss on expectations is meaningless. If it goes to that 110 long term support I'll pick up more. I can see where some may be disappointed with this drop, especially when tech and other high fliers are making folks rich, but these guys will slowly move up over time, unless we stop wiping our noses and other parts. :)"
This is another has been dividend stock…
"It's tough comparing sales to same quarter last year during the paper craze - of course sales volume is down in comparison to that period. Also, high input costs are eroding margins, but this should level as commodity prices normalize for pulp/wood/etc. - I'm a little jittery, but this company still has strong brands behind it - I'll hold for now"
"Stock is breaking down again here, should lose $126 very soon..."
2nd order set at $127.00
"It is good to be Short!Kimberly-Clark Corp. shares fell 2.7% in Monday premarket trading after the consumer goods company reported third-quarter earnings that missed expectations and lowered its earnings guidance. Net income totaled $469 million, or $1.39 per share, compared with $472 million, or $1.38 per share, last year. Adjusted EPS of $1.62 missed the FactSet consensus for $1.65."
KMB can increase prices to keep up with inflation and supply chain issues. People still need to wipe their noses and #$%$ Competitors will most likely experience the same issues. Definitely buying this dip.
Can’t wait for open!!! Gonna be a good day to add!
Bought more at 125.50
Trying to figure out a realistic price target for KMB in the next year. Any opinions people?
Buy the dip worked for me!!!
"Happy to be Short a lot of shares at $132.50 as a Pure Earnings Short Sell play. This one is poised to hit a brand new 52 week low, dipping under $128.02 today, in direct response to a weak and disappointing quarterly earnings report, with lots of uncertainty going forward."
"Congrats! It has done nothing for four years. Guess it needs to take on some more debt, lol…."
Why is this not moving on such a solid earnings and corporate announcements?
initiated position at 125.90
"Once again, very fast recovery to 130$"
Kimberly-Clark is down 4.99% to 126.40
"Earnings are out and the numbers are quite weak with very lukewarm forward Guidance. Stock is selling off in the pre-market in direct response to this poor ER, and I expect further price degradation throughout the day. Will look to Cover at -$127.00. This is looking like yet another successful Pure Earnings Short Sell play. :-) Kimberly-Clark MissesKimberly-Clark (KMB) reported 3rd Quarter September 2021 earnings of $1.62 per share on revenue of $5.0 billion. The consensus earnings estimate was $1.66 per share on revenue of $5.0 billion. Revenue grew 7.0% on a year-over-year basis.The company said it expects 2021 earnings of $6.05 to $6.25 per share on revenue of $18.76 billion to $18.95 billion. The company's previous guidance was earnings of $6.65 to $6.90 per share on revenue of $18.76 billion to $19.14 billion and the current consensus earnings estimate is $6.65 per share on revenue of $19.44 billion for the year ending December 31, 2021."
Kimberly-Clark reached a 52 Week low at 126.63
Why doesn’t the Kimberly-Clark Corporation merge with the Clorox Company? There appear to be many synergy between the two.
Bought more on Friday. 52 week lows and adding
"Todays price is the same as it was in February 2016, 5 years ago. Not great, but since the recent pullback, it looks like a buying opportunity in a few more weeks."
"Here it is, wave of selling pressure right at the open, stock collapses to a brand new 52 week low as she can't hold $128... Looking VERY weak for the day!"
Will wait to buy under $129
"Patience to the Short side on this one, not gonna Cover here, looking for continued price degradation as the morning progresses..."
best stonk eva
Thinking the play on this is a PMCC with the Jan 2023 $120 calls and selling $138 CC's each week...will make killing and only costs about $19.50 in premium so making about 2% a week for the foreseeable future...not too shabby if you ask me. Thoughts?
This stock needs to correct down to the $100-110 range. It’s going nowhere and the dividend is not enough to interest me at this point.
"While the stock hasn’t gone up much in ages, you really can’t push the stock down either. Every time it goes below 130 it return to 130 very quickly."
Why? 3.15% green today.
"I'm long on KMB. The current price to book ratio for Kimberly-Clark as of August 13, 2021 is 60.64. I read that a good PB Ratio is under 1 which indicates a Value Stock ... I always thought of KMB as a Value Stock but the very high PB is confusing. Can anyone help me understand?"
