"This is just my guess, but because May unemployment data was surprisingly good, fed and congress might start thinking of no more stimulus and printing money to save economy. Then, institutions and investors will have to turn attention to fundamentals (back to basics). Then, imagine what will happen in the market. Not going to be quick reaction though. Insanely overpriced stock like MAR may be in trouble due to its horrible balance sheet."

The market run up will not last long. From a revenue standpoint Marriott probably back in the 1970s or 80's at best. Price now is hyper infalted and retail buyers will soon be taught a lesson.
"I covered a small percentage of my short just now at $95.50. I can't take this BS anymore and will accept my losses.Reality is gone. The disconnect from main street and wall street has never been so large.How do you invest when fundamentals don't matter at all and you now with all your being that the only way is down for the market. I can't go long in this market, it is against what I know should be true."

"Unfortunately, due to laws of physics  always tends to float upwards. I guess it’s time to finally flush!"
Hotel stocks remind me of Airlines. The delusion of people that thought it was a good idea to buy at half price when they have less than 10% of the revenue.The revenue this yr will be less than in 2009 but you are buying it at 2017 levels.
Is marriott paying out dividends to share holders?
I stay at Marriott’s approx 75 nights per year. Not anymore!!
"I am bullish because this Wall Street is far off from the Main Street. In a day where we added 6.6M unemployed people to the existing 7-8m, making this the worse unemployment numbers since great depression our treasury secretary walks in to survive the market at 9:15, so at 9:36 MAR is at $87. Clearly this is the administration trying to keep a strong market, president Trump believes that stock market is the real deal on the economy. its election year after all. So Uncle Sam wants the stocks to be up, we cannot win this fight with our valuations. who cares about ebditda or revpar. they have the ink and paper and they need DJ to be over 23k."

"The reason the P/E for Marriott is sky high is because right now earnings are practically non existent due to COVID. Once the economy reopens P/E should contract, but you also have to ask yourself if the current prices make sense. When one is taking into account they aren't getting much business right now due to travel being so low, plus the fact that virtual chat is going to eliminate the need to take business trips, MAR will see their business hurt considerably. Very doubtful business returns to pre COVID levels. I am not an investor in MAR but one tell that the price is full of a lot of hot air right now."
"110 TOMORROW, AND 90 NEXT WEEK."
"This is a temporary pop, we’re far from recovery and this will drop into year end To"
"Do investors see reality?No travel,no guests,big debt,few cash.I don't think it must go brutal down,or investor should panic,but this optimism is realy out of reality."
Up 9 points (127 to 136) in the past four trading days as the investment world starts to believe that the Delta covid is peaking.
Company has $225M in cash and $12B in debt. Debt/equity ratio is 1700! Massive layoffs and no customers for a year. Tell me this is priced in!
$H or $MAR for a long term investment...?
"lol, this will be WAY lower than this"
"Even the CEO, Arnie, said it would take 2-3 years of recovery, but people keep piling money into this stock. I think this companies foundation is strong, but to put a valuation at the same as it was in 2019 is comical.. GL to all."
"Another part where Sorenson was way too optimistic was saying that business travel will return to normal levels. He is wrong.The 9/11 case was different because besides of 9/11 the victims of terrorism in the US were very limited. Of course every case is important but you cant compare 107,000 deaths in 10 weeks with terrorism.And the financial crisis is also different because well, money comes and goes. Countries tend to almost always recover financially.The difference here isnt just the virus which is already an extremely difficult problem. The virus already has made hotels lose a bigger chunk in revenue this yr than the portion they lost in both crissi put together and will keep doing it. But the technology is different. Companies are realizing how much they can save making things digital. Imagine how much money is spent paying for business class and a hotel stay. Imagine several. Theres a reason why Zoom and Slate are two of the hottest stocks right now. Companies will not go back to mass spending in business meetings.There are so many dangers facing the hotel industry. 1. The virus. Resurgence of cases and possibility of lockdowns2. The virus in other countries.3. The increased costs to clean up due to the virus4. The utter destruction of the business trip model5. The economic crisis. Plenty of people going broke. The market might be on fire but companies themselves are laying people off. So many people dont even want to spend money."
"After the quarterly earnings call on May 7, is when I expect this will drop double digits in one day. The algos are going to massacre this stock."
"Someone is going to get hurt really bad when the pumping stops. Marriott will see a 2nd quarter worse than the 1st. Hotels will close permanently, meetings and large groups will cancel through the rest of thje year and ""flu"" season in 2021. Leisure travel will be impacted by job losses and overall fears of the virus. If no one belieces that, UAL is at 10% of former schedule in May and close to it this month. CA and NY look to extend lockdowns for a long time and that has a significant impact on business pushing the pain out further. No or few international arrivals.The talking heads on Wall St will always find a way to transfer losses to Main St and GS is probably not buying on their upgrade a few days ago. I wish all well, but the facts are the facts and the facts are ugly"
"I would be very concered here for all you holding. Up 16% is VERY scary. This stock should be in the 40's. Hope I'm wrong but this sector will be the last to recover. I'm in hotel investments, and everyone is having a challenge with their cash position. GLTA"
"Bought the dip today. Will buy more below 140. Liquid weekly options - can sell 23 Apr $145 Call for 80 cents and sell $139 Put for 80 cents. This ticker offers both short term trading opportunities and long term appreciations. They will resume dividends at some point in 2021 or 2022. The hotel chain is stable, conservative and caters to business and leisure markets."
"I'm going to Sell Short MAR with a lot of shares just before the close today, as a Pure Earnings play to hold for Monday. I think the ER on Monday is going to be bad and the Guidance should be either bad or non-existent. The virus is worldwide and Marriott is a worldwide hotel chain. Every single hotel in the world will be negatively impacted by Covid-19. Some more than others but the bottom line is that money will be lost at EVERY single Marriott property and this will continue for ALL of 2020. I analyzed the financials and from my perspective MAR is NOT cheap at the $86 level. On a bad ER this could easily fall to under $80. I think the risk/reward ratio of this Short Sell is excellent."
Just the beginning. Stock will be at 30 by EOY.
revenge shopping and travelling will go on after lock down. But it won't be a new trend.
"“In the same press release in which it announced the prepayments from its credit card partners, Marriott noted that it had to ""terminate"" its $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, which was announced on April 14, because its ""capacity"" had been ""substantially reduced as a result of the Series EE senior notes offering the company completed on April 16, 2020.""While not 100% certain, the import of this language appears to be that Marriott has already taken on so much debt to get through this crisis that it couldn't take on much more without violating the terms of existing loan agreements.And that could be the reason Marriott wasn't able to hold on to all its gains from earlier in the day: Marriott's starting to get up against the wall and reaching the upper limits on its ability to borrow. With the company's total debt load now approaching $12 billion, this will bear watching.”https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/05/05/why-marriott-stock-popped-5-this-morning-then-gave.aspx"
Looks like heavy selling by insiders lately. Remember insiders include major shareholders which more likely institutions. https://www.secform4.com/insider-trading/1048286.htm
What does this surge mean? Do people see the fundamentals. They are awful. All these money printing can’t improve the situation.
"VJ, the debt load a majority of which was Starwood acquisition which in times of plenty makes sense. Then add the financed buybacks which demancs a perfect business outlook. A conservative approach would be to mace the acquisition, pay off that debt. While you are doing that your revenue grows and you have all kinds of opportunities controlling more and more businesses. Then you do buybacks if things are still going well. I would not have done th Starwood deal with that much debt. The addition of the buybacks is catastropic with ANY hiccups. Now they have bankers watching every move and it will be interesting to hear this call. Anyone buying a quick bounceback and making an investment decision on that needs to have their head examined."
"I made a choice to concede that I am not as bright as I once thought. So I depend to the market to give me the answers as to its direction and I NEVER disagree with what it's telling me. In the past whenever I did disagree, I got burned (like some are now). Should $HLT be trending up? HELL NO! , Should the S&P, Dow and nasdaq be moving up? Again, NO! But who am I to argue with the market. If the market changes it's mind by going below some moving average I consider important along with some other analysis that has worked for me in the past, I will change mine. Until then, I say go long on $HLT, $MAR and the market in general, even though in my mind, it makes no sense."
"Under what basis is Wells Fargo upgrading the stock when there is zero income. When the market opens, the summer travel season is a wash and there is not much hotel requirements during winter. Where is Marriott making their money if the summer travel season will be a dull. Looks like stock manipulation by WELLS FARGO. They are up to their old tricks again."
Beat expectations why does it go down?
"The market was overheated before February, the correction was on the way, but now, when everyone sees that there is a real disaster in travel industry, this stock goes up! Crazy! Occupancy rates are very low, statistic says that people tend to spend their vacation using AIRbnb services, where the people flow is less. Short it. This company overvalued."
Google marriot international email and you’ll see where you can tell them not a penny more from me marriot. Never.
"I bought this stock back in early 90s, for $12 per share. Stock splits, and company divestures has been a great stock!"
Good time to short or risky ?? We can’t trust this market its keep moving up
Worst rewards program ever. You can be a premier member and have 600K points but people at the resorts can get a a better discount if they have AAA or buy their vacation at Costco. Sad.
"EV/EBITDA=20 ? Is that right, 20 on trailing earning of what was still part of an extremely strong economy. So even when all the current issues subside, getting back to last year levels still leaves this at that high of a valuation ? And Price/Book = 52 ?"
"In an emotional video message on Thursday to Marriott International employees, CEO Arne Sorenson characterized the coronavirus crisis as more severe for the hotel chain than the Great Depression and World War 2."
Get ready for the down turn
Good it moved higher need to get to $90 to shot this one . 2021 when they see revenue stabilization this market expeditions are insane this bubble is going to burst
This should be up to 150…
"As a pilot, have had a busy month flying around the country the last 30 days. Terminals and FBOs are nearly deserted. The hotels as well. Spent 19 nights in them this period usually under Hilton or Marriott brands. Almost all have occupancy in the single digits. Many hotels shut down. Room rates are low. Food service very limited to basic takeout. Many of the few customers are aircrew and their numbers are dropping. Have 20 days off now and wonder if that may be increased."

"This market reacts extremely positive to any piece of good news and ignores the bad news even though the bad news are in the same paragraph, statement or even sentence as the good news.So hotel occupancy is going up but everyone knows that May saw more activity than April. So bad data is priced in but the good data somehow isnt and market reacts when the CEO says something lolThe CEO said a couple of things that everyone knew which is that theres more revenue on May than on April (stock skyrockets 7%) and that it will take years for occupancy level to go back to normal (ignore that).What do you think it's more important? Knowing that May has more revenue than April this year (which the same for virtually everyone) or that it will take years to recover (which means longer than 2 years)?"
"60 times earnings, -10% annual growth rate projection and deeply divisive, left-wing, political posturing. Not an ideal combination by any stretch.Hotel occupancy is also never returning to previous levels. Too many companies have now permanently changed to work at home models and when and if employees do come back to the office, they'll be using Zoom. It's a broken business model and can't be fixed."
Marriott has a ton of debt and proportionally not a lot of cash fueling expansion. they're going to have to put the expansion on hold. expect a loss on the quarter alone this impacts the US
have any of you checked reservations for popular vacation spots in the past few weeks.Many are solidly booked. We had a run up to earnings so I'm not sure how much to expect but I would bet that a statement comes out painting a rosy future and the stock gets a pop.Let's see tomorrow AM 7:00 EST
Covered my MAR Short Sell at $82.49 average price for an EXCELLENT profit on 1300 shares. Very nice way to start the week!Good Luck folks.
Stay long this stock. It still represents great value and business travel will resume. The story only gets better from here and this company is well positioned to outperform.
Was a $15 stock in 2008 and that is where its headed.
"Agreed Hsin. Not understanding the euphoria in the markets. This is a long road back regardless if this drug helps improve patient recovery. It doesn’t mean everyone will go back to travel like 2019. Not a chance. Business conferences and trips will be drastically reduced, maybe for years. Sports will not be returning to full stadium which means few people will actually travel to go to a game."
"Flights were cancelled, bookings were cancelled, no crusie traavellers, corporates asked employees to stop travels. The downturn is drastic in last week, and conferences for. Next few months are tossed. Ball games will be played without fans. I guess at least 50 percent drop in occupancy."
"I think the market doesn´t react adequate, the economy conditions will be very difficult, don´t you see it? Coronavirus in this phase is not small temporary problem. I think, it should go lower significantly... If I look at Apple, just little below 300, now its joke."
Why are any hotel chains stock climbing up ??!!?? Compared to year ago capacity has dropped tremendously. No company conventions occuring. How are these hotels even making money ?
"Market is pushing this stock higher.. almost wanted to close it today, but didn’t.. in red. Hopefully this will drop on Monday"
Horrible Rewards program taking its toll?
"Its not just bitcoins, pretty much everthing is down in my account this morning. The only things up are $NCLH, $MP, $SIL, $CPER, $DAL, $MAR. So its a recovery stocks day."
How can a hotel chain have a book value of 71 cents? Do they not own the real estate?
"The buyers here might not appreicate the demand destruction, over inventory based on that loss, the fact no one will want to fly for a time, most group business will cancel for a while and that both corp and lesiure travel will sinply take a LONG time to ramnp due to economic devestation due to loss of revenue, loss of jobs, loss of weath on then marekts, etc. There is also the question of when international travel which is very important in gateway cities will even start. I doubt we will trust others flying in to re infect. Brandon is correct, I know very few operators that will be able to provide adequate cash to owners (REITS and others) to pay debt service. They may not even have money to pay fees to Marriott. GLTA, but I can tell you after 35 some years dealing with this the econmics are just not good."
Warren Buffet said he dumped all airlines stocks last month because he thinks their businesses won’t come back for years to come. Many people are expecting airlines stocks will go down on Monday. Do you think that will affect hotel stocks?
Starwood acquisition in 2016 for $13.6 billion. Then came large data breach. Now Covid. Stock has lost almost half it's value this year. Dividend suspended. Travel constrained. BLM riots in large cities. Corporate furloughs extended until at least October. Don't foresee any upside until 2022 at minimum. Dead money
Suspicious big move up and down 15 min before/after market close. Somebody is manipulating.

"Price increase is driven by demand for travel ETF... investors have been buying these because of Vegas reopening and slightly better demand in airline travel... this stock will soon collapse, its way overvalued... no events and meetings at their hotel (one of the biggest revenue maker for this industry), restaurants capacity have been more than halfed due to social distancing and the demand to eat at their restaurants is weak, corporate travel will most likely not recover in years thanks to virtual meetings etc... I’ll be shorting it at around it’s peak today... also Marriott himself sold more than 3% of his holding at less than $93 per share a couple of weeks ago... take a look at the sec filing...short and hold, this stock will collapse"
All of you better sell into strength in this temporary rally for ‘value’ stocks. This is another buy the rumor sell the news. It’s really going to be quite a long while before Covid dust settles. Pzifer CEO sold off 60% of shares despite the vaccine. The rotation to ‘value’ is only temporary and we should all take profits quickly
Hard to believe this doesn't reach new 52 week lows.
"lol Marriot is up 10+% recession cancelled guys! layoffs don't matter, mass unemployment, nor does no one staying in hotels. Priced in they say!"
Good time to Short or risky ??? Any insights...
"This move was absurd. Sorenson said on CNBC that 2021 will be like 2019. That will NOT be the case. Not going to happen. No franchisee has much capacity to weather more than a month or 2. A select few about 6 months MAYBE. REITS owning a lot of these are already getting margin calls and without budgeted payments coming in after the end of the March/3rd fiscal period there will be stuff hitting the fan everywhere. This is probably a $25 stock at best. If you can short it. I hate to say that, but it is not going anywhere near where it was ."
another Marriott data breached !! https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2020/03/31/business/ap-us-marriott-data-breach.html
"Eventually, when this plays out, I can't help but think that there will be huge opportunities in airline and hospitality stocks. $DAL $LUV $MAR $HLT"
another 5% up for MAR today. that makes it 30% up in the last 3 trading days!!
"Need franchisees to be able to pay up, which I don't think will happen until Summer 2020. I think all of hospitality is down until the Summer, so believe it will tread water to down for next 3 quarters. Something to put a marker on and see."
"I see $MAR 's P/E is still at 25. This is a bear market and not only will the P/E collapse but so will the ""E."". Downside potential is huge. Someday it will be a great buying opportunity but that will be many, many months out."
Wow these TSA traveller numbers are scary for any travel related company. At one point down more than 95% from 2019 $MARhttps://www.tsa.gov/coronavirus/passenger-throughput
"Revenue down 65 plus pct in Q4 and horridic losses, frachise owners losing hotels, no international travel for how many years, corp travel will nbot reboubd for some time as with conventions etc. Not to mention a dead CEO and Marriott is back to close to all time highs? That means the market will be taking this down soon. And dont tell me about all the acquisitions, etc. It will take YEARS to get back to 2019 full year levels.....if not decades!!"
just 10 pcent down pre-market?It is great opportunity to short it
This company is so overvalued right now
Can someone enlighten me what caused the sharp price increase in the after hour market yesterday?
The wisest thing that should be on everyone mind currently should be to invest in different stream of income that doesn't depend on the govt especially with the current economic crisis around the world.
"Where are the comments? This is going to surprise a lot of investors. Just when you think $MAR will have bad earnings, they pull a Boeing. $165 PT after earnings is more than doable imo."

"30+% sustained unemployment. NO INTERNATIONAL flights for 12-18 months (do you want them flying to your city?) Domestic trave will be 25% opf 2019 in the last quarter MAYBE. NExt year no more than 35-45% of 2019. Hotels will be closing like dominoes. Simply no busines. Prove to me I am wrong. You know this economy is no rocket, and domestic travel will not even ramp modesly until just like the TSA, people can prove before getting into the airport they are ""safe"". Be it airlines, hotels, cruises, take advantage of the dead cat bounce and get the he!! out! They may pump them foir a short time, but once a quarterly report or businss update omces out and you know the REAL story it is curtains. MArriott BK."

"A lot of people are new to investing and look at the chart and see Marriots high being over 140 (very overpriced number. The company went in debt to buyback shares at that level. That has long term repercussions, look at American Airlines). So they think they are the smartest people on Earth if they buy at 80something because hey, it will go back up soon. But truth is that after airlines Hotels are the biggest hit by the virus. Events are cancelled, travel will be down for yrs. And people keep ignoring the economic impact. I'm fine and I'm not planning on going anywhere, same with some relatives. People that are well financially but are quiet at home waiting to see what will happen.In the meantime what do you do with the mountain of real estate? There is no demand for it you believe that.Q2 will bring revenue down to early 90s levels."
"It was only a matter of time. Marriott at 100? You kidding me? LolThe outrageous thing is that there were still people buying this thing are 97 dollars today AFTER furloughs were announced to go into the fall (meaning, no revenue at least until late this year) and the company itself saying it's worse than 9/11 and 2009 put together. I mean if by now you dont want to listen and admit this thing is going below 70 soon or later there's no excuse. Only thing missing is the CEO saying their stock fair price is under 60. And some fools would still pay 100 for it that same day."
Which one will you buy right now to sell in 1 week?$WYNN $MGM $HLT $MAR
"industry wide, 40% of all hotel bookings are for business travel, as opposed to only 12% of all airline bookings being business related. Business travel is unlikely to return this year and the summer conferences have already been cancelled across the board. MAR has a long way still to fall."
"The pain may last until May 8 - earnings date is the day of reckoning. It will be the most irrational thing ever, if we don't reverse before then. We are not going back to normal regardless of the vaccines or the remdesivir, for at least a year, maybe two years."
"One added comment, Marriott and owners will be used FFE reserves (basically allocation for future renovations and planned and unplanned capital expenses) for operatinional expenses. This is never good and will make future initiatives and rehabs all but impossible for years. These reserves depend on certain revenues to put away and this is what keeps brands looking good and desireable. Not good."
Wow Marriott is turning into a big giant bubble stock... once it bursts it will collapse... very scary
I’m buying MAR at this level with no problem. Half a year from now you won’t get it at these prices.

"(Bloomberg) - Marriott International Inc. will suspend donations to Republican senators who voted against certifying President-elect Joe Biden, after considering the “destructive events” at the Capitol last week."
Who on earth is a buyer? Hotels shutting doors every where. Buyer beware.
Marriott is down 4.91% to 128.42
"Anarchy in major markets where conventions, large business meetings, etc that drive high rated full houses of high value guests is apparently good for business according to the stock price. Will organizations and businesses book these events or keep commitments for the forseeable fiture? Wil companies lift travel bans they put in place? Sure leisure picks up but it is going to tertiary and destinations far from these important destations."
This stock is over bought on all charts. What’s going on SMH
"might be a good opportunity to buy, we'll miss revenues but the earnings per share will be up again and 2018 should be revised upward. The strong dollar is a concern but domestic travel seems to be jumping as well."
"This is absolutely crazy what's happening with this stock..I'm an executive for a hotel investment company and all occupancy is 6-9 percent. ""Good"" performing hotels during this time is floating occupancy of around 25-30 percent in very unique markets.. In addition, I see comments about quarantine hotels and those are far and in between. Those properties may do well from a GOP stand point, but this makes up .01% of hotels.. I can only imagine that people are hung up on this stimulus package which provides aid in getting us through this however does not add value or revenue....Lastly, this isn't an industry that we just turn back on like many retailers. We need to build consumer trust again. Good luck to all and please stop the comments about buy... You sound uneducated.."

"Soreson said demand was, however, starting to crawl back. ""As restrictions are released, I think the trend line now is towards more (hotel) openings, not towards more closings.""------------oh please. It's cost more to keep a hotel open at 25% capacity than it does to shut it down. Get real."
"Marriot is a really solid company. But it is still overvalued at this time, gonna but if it drops below $93 I’ll buy and lock it up for the long term."

"The big question for Marriott is if the world of biz will go back to the old way of doing business - salespeople traveling 5 days a week and staying at Marriotts across the country. Just one person's view: I was a victim of this lifestyle and I am not going back. Our company is doing better with the travel-stop - selling more with lower expenses, and I get to be with the family not just during the weekend. If many more feel like me and the way people do business has changed then it's the end of the multiple Marriotts at every junction, and this company needs to start closing hotels quickly, because even after the vaccine, the world is not going to back to where it was."

"Marriott has about 800 properties in the Asia Pacific region and roughly half in Greater China. It is one of the most impacted international hotel chain.

"Opinions are swinging wildly and it appears that Some posters are trying to take advantage of less astute investors by telling them to either put your money under your mattress or go all in. Not one is mentioning to be cautious and consider walking money back in slowly and prudently and not into any one stock or index. The only worse than the stock market taking a huge hit is the overzealous market to push stocks back up. You can’t make good investment choices based on any posters here. Not to be disrespectful, but you don’t know these people. I’m sure there are some who mean well but there are many who are il-intentioned. In my opinion, unless you are a savvy trader/investor it’s better to invest with a long term horizon past one year and invest accordingly and spread your money out into multiple industries, even energy. The human race will get back on its feet but it’s going to take longer than the president and wallstreet will admit. One of things to remember going forward is that many large companies had big debt issues prior to the virus and those problems just got compounded."
"Sorenson warned that it could take Marriott a few years to get back to levels of occupancy seen in 2019, when its global occupancy rate was 71%."
Why does it keep dropping? :/
"The best financially set franchisees had about 6 months worth of cash on hand starting in March. With complete disruption of businesses first in occupany and now rate as remaining business is going back to the well for this year and next. A lot of franchisees will be entering some sort of default soon as forbearance winds down. A lot of these hotels are appraised/financed at 2019 levels. Marriott will be facing a reckoning as what were perceived to be temp disruptions become permanent. Owners, REITS, banks all facing huge problemssoon. Markets are extremely overbuilt. As a veteran of the last 4 major storms to hit the hotel business there is no way current business levels can return for minimum 5, but liely 10 years if evern."
Is shorting this till March 27 or April 9 safe bet ?
"Very low volume today and a flat chart. This could get propped up for a long time, we will see what happens."
I wouldn't short this stock. I tried and did well initially during march but some bs going on in the u.s
Way over bought! Pricy even at .$122
I've 4 Marriott properties. My occupancy is 9% .This will go down to low 40's
"Marriott sold another $1b debt yesterday. “The debt sale follows an earlier sale, that one of $1.58 billion worth of senior notes in mid-April, as well as Marriott’s draw-down of its revolving credit facility, worth $4.5 billion, in March.The company also raised $920 million in new cash through its credit card partners in early May.While many states are slowly starting to reopen, hotels are facing the reality that customers’ return to travel is likely to be measured, at best. Marriott and others have said that their business will start to come back first at destinations within driving distance of leisure travelers, but that the industry’s return is also closely tied to the resumption of significant air travel.“"
"Based on the catastrophic drop in net WITH 1/2 of the period more or less intact, Q2 will be net loss. We are half way through, a certain % are closed, air traffic down 95% and China is ""UP"" at <20%? Net loss will be <$150M minimum in Q2 IMO. Hide behind that Arne....I think a lot of shareholders will take your buyback now at$147....LMAO"
"People are starting to travel. Hotels are booked. Wedding season, vaction and parties are in all planned for this Summer."
"Um, WOW!!!!"
"I'm totally shocked at the behavior of one of Marriott's franchisees. The company involved in the below article has several Marriott properties. What if I was staying at one of their properties and I left the towel at the pool? Then the cleaning staff notices the towel missing, would I get arrested too? https://tryonvo.com/hospitality/https://www.newsweek.com/felony-50k-mountain-dew-theft-pennsylvania-third-strike-1630744?fbclid=IwAR2bFgwFBPIDAeHNpVuhz1zWD0NOCP38VuUaoEq-_vMqMOlHJ4R7rj-qnjE"
I was considering putting a lot into MAR... but with the news today... I'll buy a different hotel co...
Hello? MAR new all-time yesterday @ 162+!! CNBC technician guest last night said 190 target. World opening up. Stock is very strong. It has made itself my second largest holding (behind MSFT) Where is everyone?
"I'm still sitting on 260 shares at below $50 PPS. I'm just waiting to see if the vaccines do any good. Lowering the COVID mortality and severe illness rates. Once that happens, the travel economy will throttle back up again. I booked a MVC for 2 weeks. I was trying to get in when the weather got a little warmer in March. No luck. Completely sold out. In spite of old man winter, it's still pretty crowded here this week, in spite of reduced services. As we come roaring back to live, I expect a corresponding increase in MAR value or I'll sell. $150 by the end of the year or I'm out of here."
ill buy at 4$ a share
Can anyone explain tho pop today? I am down 8 grand on it short. Should I exit?
"Just with business travelling ending it's enough to hit the revenue with these hotels by 20%. Business conventions are essential for these hotels. Not only they put people in rooms but the events have a very big profit margin. It's basically the food cost and some labor. And I really mean just some labor because they even charge these companies for the tips for these employees. And nowadays they charge ""service charge"" so they even get more from what they pay their employees.Losing events is devastating.And forget about business trips from overseas.And not only the virus is killing these trips. The economy is in the gutter. You think all these companies laying people off are in the mood for conventions?Yesterday was truly a gift for an easy short"
"I have 24 stocks that have gone down in recent weeks, and one that is up. Very quietly, MAR has become my largest holding, and is now up about 3 1/2 times since the 3/20 lows. 128 to 155 in six weeks!! Lots more to come as the Delta variant diminishes and the world opens."
Doesn’t seem to want to go down... over priced!
SO CONFUSED! Revenue down at least 80% for an entire quarter. China rate makes up a fraction of Americas and Europe market. Looks like the short of a lifetime but who knows anymore... GLTA and which ever side you end up on.. STAY SAFE and GOD SPEED
"MAR at 95 and S&P at 3050 after 75 days of total economic shutdown and 5 nights of rioting tells you that keeping the market propped up is the #1 priority. Very sad commentary on what ""the powers that be"" think is important and what a disconnect from reality."
Very rare opportunity for a quick nice short.Marriott over 90 is a still. Short it and cover under 85 in 2-3 days.
"How is this company trading higher now than before the pandemic? Doesn't a significant amount of their revenue come from conventions, which no business is having now? Also, business travel is still virtually non-existent. This is one massive bubble."
This stock feels like a yo yo
"Airbnb said more people are choosing vacation homes rather than hotels this summer. Also GS analyst says the same thing. “We have seen a faster recovery within alternative accommodations than in hotels,” Morgan Stanley analyst Brain Nowak wrote in a note last week."
"Arne Sorenson told CNBC (Sara Eisen?) in March that 2021 would equal 2019!! HEY ARNE, do you care to take that back? There is no way this stock is valued at 50% of what it was 60 days ago. Revenue has been clipped by what is likely 75% minimum. Cash squeeze despite the balance sheet adds...I dont think there has been tape about cash burn relative to current business levels. So many issues as it relates to incomeing cash from both managed propeties and franchisees....debt service....it just does not pencil out and when you look at air travel, 25-30% unemployment, governments needing to CUT travel due to revenue losses.....its a bnightmare. This was a fake rally and as much as hte analysts sayd EPS does not mattrer this year, hmmm...it will soon."
Hilton Baby
"Sorenson on cover of ""HOTELS"" magainze for April just in the mail. All about leadership. With $11B in debt, 225M in cash and literally No business and laying off 10s of Thousands of employees (not including franchise operaters) and having just bought back $M's or $B's of stock in Q! at $147 or so he will be perceived differently. ""leaders"" plan for a bad day. I know many who have been diligent about balance sheets and have 3-6 months cash (not including paying staff mind you) but even they NEVER anticipated a TOTAL lockdown. This is armageddon, and I am not being theatrical. I dont know how Marriott does not file BK in the next few weeks."
https://www.marketwatch.com/story/marriott-says-president-and-ceo-arne-sorenson-died-unexpectedly-on-sunday-2021-02-16?siteid=yhoof2&yptr=yahooMarriott International Inc. said Tuesday that its Chief Executive and President Arne Sorenson died unexpectedly on Sunday.

The Marriott hotels in Indianapolis have been closed for the last three months and my guess it is the same in other states as well. How is this company going to survive? And why is the stock only down 15%?
If I was long on this I would take this gift and run!
"Wow, another 3 percent decline after market. Where will this end? At $72.00 now."
"Ive been telling you since before the top and before hysteria. Easy 50% drop from here. Way too much supply, airlines cuttingdomestic service, conventions and meetings canceled. Mass layoffs coming. Franchises highly levered. These new behaviours will NOT revert soon. Businesses will not be able to afford, nor will consumers, luxuries like travel."
"Mariott CEO calls bottom say the headlines. But the facts tell us the opposite.1. Q1 earnings included 2 great months, Jan and Feb, and at least half of March as a decent month.2. More than $12B in debt and the debt has to keep increasing just to make the payments.3. 234,000 new rooms being added and 14000 rooms added in Q1. This has to be utter madness.4. Franchisees in despair.What rational being would surmise Q1 is a bottom?"
technical analysis suggests breakout higher.
I owned MAR and sold it for a profit. I’m thinking I should buy more. Such a solid little money maker.
Worth $60 and not a penny more. At highs of 2019 JAn 2020 and revenues not even close. House of cards!
Sell this till $35!!! That will make PE AND PEG reasonable!!!
"This market is insane, this is up ytd. How does this make an sense whatsoever"
"People are looking at ATHs with this stock, thinking it will go back, and who knows, maybe in the short term it does? But the depressing reality of life paints a different picture than the hype behind travel and leisure stocks. Cases are drastically increasing and states are on lockdown and hotels/casinos are mostly closed. Reality is not reflected in the stock price. Eventually when earnings come these stocks are in trouble. With 3.28 mil people filing for unemployment they certainly won't be traveling. They will be trying to make rent and buy groceries."
Why is it not going down?
Zacks just downgraded MAR to STRONG SELL.I need advise!Should we sell now before we lose big $.
Done with Marriott
a simple question to ask your self will you buy at this price? I will not spend a dime!
"Sorenson wil be selling you the shares he bought back at $147 January 2020 soon at what price....$50? $40? $25? It is very likely s the amount of time it takes to even get to a 1995 gets extended further and futher. Those extended furloughs after he told you in March that by January 2021 you would be in 2019 again. How many franchise hotels will simply close? How many markets are Courtyards competing with another Courtyard and multiple other Marriott brands within several miles due to overbuilding and then the acquisition of another hotel chain? They will all compet for business that has been dented by 50$ or more on RATE. It is nightmare no one ever saw coming, almost no one. This has been propped up by esy money but fundamentals will be back in vogue. You may be partying here until Q2 financials or until REAL data gets out, but it will not be too much longer."
"Ashford CEO interview is very telling about what is really happening to the hotel industry. Hard to understand why the price is this high. If Wall Street is an indication of six months from now, the reality is this is a $40 stock despite cheap lending facilities."
"Who is, this Millhouse non entity with his I told you so bragadaccio. A clock will be right twice a day sir. If you like the stock but it. If you don't why endlessly talk about it. Me.. Ex Marriott gm of 20 years.. Retired now and living the good life in Asia thanks to this stock. 100 or 150 I don't care.. It has a lot of legs left..."
I have bought puts when this goes above 93 and sold them as soon as it goes under 89 three times since April and one time I bought some cheap 100 dollar put when it was over 104 or something and sold it the next time it dropped over 89.I've made almost 150% in total. Its like printing your own moneyThis industry is damaged permanently. Everyone talks about airlines but hotels might never reach their potential because business travel is damaged forever and conventions as well.
"This stock went from $150 to $50 in about a month..then, strangely went from $50 to $90 in 3 days last week, that was nuts, the news isn't getting better, back down to $60 this week imo."
need 98
I recommend that MAR deploy the various advanced smart security devices from AiTX as they greatly increase security and patron security and at the same time significantly lower costs.
11% up. unbelievable!
Below 100 coming. No way they are coming even close to to guidance. And cash flow will be tragic!
Why is Marriott doing so well? It factually shouldn't be.
$50 looks good
MAR president and major shareholder (10%+) institution sold their shares today. https://www.secform4.com/insider-trading/1048286.htm
Just wow. I travel and log 100 nights a year at Marriott. I have ZERO in the last 12 months. I predict ZERO for this year. All of my customers the same. I just don't get it.
"When driving south to Florida, the kids ask ecery hour : Are we thre YEEEET?Now that Marriott has reported... good call, optimistic.One can have some data points to set the base and pace. and compare.AHT had a1Q - 3 months occupancy with approx 38, 42 and 49% occupancy and broke even ( before hq cost). In their call. they said that APril was better than March.Comparing AHT to $MAR, AHT had better report.But 22K rooms verus 120K for Marriott. So that is OK to track both. The airline travel rate was Less 1M - week end passenger in 1Q, 1.2milish in Mid March,1 4. Mil by Easter and NOw 1.7M.This is peak day travel on Thursday and or Sunday of a week.Net AHT seems to be a faster occupancy rate and quicker ramp up.Buy as a pair for Summer occupancy"
wow it's up 14% today again!
Going up on no volume after short sell off at open. Just went by local Marriott. One car in front and the hotel shuttle van parked in back by the dumpster. What is holding this baby up?
Marriott begins to quarantine hotels statesside.. Boston Marriott Long Wharf shut down today. Prepare for a step down on stock
Tech is simply over bought for a reason. Hotels and Airlines are simply over sold. Get a piece now or miss the boat. The old money is buying right now. I’m long for 30 years.
"A nice healthy drop in a day in which the Nasdaq went up over 1% on the way to the real price; under 60 bucks.Earlier this week when this think was over 98 I bought 500 puts at 97. 3,700 dollars. Nice profits here."
Are we out of bush already?? I don't see the reason why this stock price surge??
"The only thing that is keeping me from shorting Marriott again is the inconsistency with the market.Everything that occurs is bearish, but it goes up. My minds telling me no. But my body, my body is telling me yes.It reached $40, may reach that again? Or not"
"Horrible numbers:""First quarter reported net income totaled $31 million, compared to $375 million in the year-ago quarter. First quarter adjusted net income totaled $85 million, compared to first quarter 2019 adjusted net income of $482 million."" And the NEXT quarter should be even WORSE."
"How many Mariotts are open? 0How many Mariotts are going to open up in the next 3 months? 0 How many in the next 6 months? A few.And the few that will be open will be 40% occupancy, which is probably more expensive than keeping the place shut down."
this is not real stock market.This is comedy
"I will put an order for $50 gtc, I don’t think it’s worth more! Look at pe how high it is in this sensitive time! Plus very bad earning report! Oh boy!!"
Any thoughts on MAR bear or bull today? Roller coaster. I’m trying to recover some of my losses. Or should I say “gambling”.
"Big company, solid company, but too exposed to the virus..gonna take years to get back to $140 range"
"Bottom isn't even in sight. P/E is still almost 16 in a major bear market and with Es disappearing.Dow 15,000 very likely as coronavirus pandemic hits U.S. economy: strategisthttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/dow-15000-very-likely-as-coronavirus-pandemic-hits-us-economy-strategist-181857580.html"
Big short of my life put 75 expire 9 apr
Revs beat but eps missed! could be some increase in costs! better to beat on revs however!
"I think they need to change their Delta Marriot hotel name… you can send me the check in the mail, marketing team."
Split???
