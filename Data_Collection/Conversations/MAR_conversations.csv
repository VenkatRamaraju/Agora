"Even the CEO, Arnie, said it would take 2-3 years of recovery, but people keep piling money into this stock. I think this companies foundation is strong, but to put a valuation at the same as it was in 2019 is comical.. GL to all."
This should be up to 150…
Up 9 points (127 to 136) in the past four trading days as the investment world starts to believe that the Delta covid is peaking.
"Ashford CEO interview is very telling about what is really happening to the hotel industry. Hard to understand why the price is this high. If Wall Street is an indication of six months from now, the reality is this is a $40 stock despite cheap lending facilities."
"Do investors see reality?No travel,no guests,big debt,few cash.I don't think it must go brutal down,or investor should panic,but this optimism is realy out of reality."
"Opinions are swinging wildly and it appears that Some posters are trying to take advantage of less astute investors by telling them to either put your money under your mattress or go all in. Not one is mentioning to be cautious and consider walking money back in slowly and prudently and not into any one stock or index. The only worse than the stock market taking a huge hit is the overzealous market to push stocks back up. You can’t make good investment choices based on any posters here. Not to be disrespectful, but you don’t know these people. I’m sure there are some who mean well but there are many who are il-intentioned. In my opinion, unless you are a savvy trader/investor it’s better to invest with a long term horizon past one year and invest accordingly and spread your money out into multiple industries, even energy. The human race will get back on its feet but it’s going to take longer than the president and wallstreet will admit. One of things to remember going forward is that many large companies had big debt issues prior to the virus and those problems just got compounded."
Way over bought! Pricy even at .$122
Is marriott paying out dividends to share holders?
"I have 24 stocks that have gone down in recent weeks, and one that is up. Very quietly, MAR has become my largest holding, and is now up about 3 1/2 times since the 3/20 lows. 128 to 155 in six weeks!! Lots more to come as the Delta variant diminishes and the world opens."
The wisest thing that should be on everyone mind currently should be to invest in different stream of income that doesn't depend on the govt especially with the current economic crisis around the world.
SO CONFUSED! Revenue down at least 80% for an entire quarter. China rate makes up a fraction of Americas and Europe market. Looks like the short of a lifetime but who knows anymore... GLTA and which ever side you end up on.. STAY SAFE and GOD SPEED

Hello? MAR new all-time yesterday @ 162+!! CNBC technician guest last night said 190 target. World opening up. Stock is very strong. It has made itself my second largest holding (behind MSFT) Where is everyone?
Zacks just downgraded MAR to STRONG SELL.I need advise!Should we sell now before we lose big $.
Stay long this stock. It still represents great value and business travel will resume. The story only gets better from here and this company is well positioned to outperform.
"Another new all-time above 160. Wake up, folks! The economy is doing just that and MAR has miles to go before it sleeps."
"I'm totally shocked at the behavior of one of Marriott's franchisees. The company involved in the below article has several Marriott properties. What if I was staying at one of their properties and I left the towel at the pool? Then the cleaning staff notices the towel missing, would I get arrested too? https://tryonvo.com/hospitality/https://www.newsweek.com/felony-50k-mountain-dew-theft-pennsylvania-third-strike-1630744?fbclid=IwAR2bFgwFBPIDAeHNpVuhz1zWD0NOCP38VuUaoEq-_vMqMOlHJ4R7rj-qnjE"
"Stayed at Marriott brands all summer, 4 trips and now done for the winter. Bye y’all"
"Anarchy in major markets where conventions, large business meetings, etc that drive high rated full houses of high value guests is apparently good for business according to the stock price. Will organizations and businesses book these events or keep commitments for the forseeable fiture? Wil companies lift travel bans they put in place? Sure leisure picks up but it is going to tertiary and destinations far from these important destations."
