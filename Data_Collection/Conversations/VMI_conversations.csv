5G is going to make this stock balloon out bigger than my ankles after takeout food
"Valmont making a lot of acquisitions lately.Hope they work out well and company not getting overextended.Stock acting real well since it fell to near $120 a few weeks ago.Hopefully,not just the company stock buybacks driving it up."
Valmont - 1/2 way between Valley & Fremont Nebraska .... :-)
VMI reached a new 52 Week Low at $131.63
"Here's some comments from the Generac 3rd quarter conference call yesterday.They take about the underinvestment in utility infrastructure driving sales of generators for Generac.Seems like the upgrading of utility infrastructure will be a great market for Valmont for years to come.""Power outages have steadily increased in frequency and duration over the last 25 years, primarily due to under-investment in the electrical grid which has left it more vulnerable to the increasingly unpredictable and more severe weather patterns that are being driven by a change in climate. In addition to the direct impacts from severe weather that cause power outages, the indirect effects of an increase in the conditions that cause wildfires is creating a much higher level of interest in backup power, as utility companies have announced their intentions to shutdown huge portions of their service areas to prevent their equipment from potentially causing a catastrophic fire.In California where penetration rates of home standby generators stand at less than 1%, we have seen a dramatic increase in the number of in-home consultations and other leading indicators that continue to point to the rapid expansion of this market. Over the last three weeks, local utilities have triggered numerous shut-offs impacting millions of customers as they seek to mitigate the risk of wildfires.These shut-offs have been multi-day events and are projected to continue in the years ahead as the impact of climate change and the massive under-investment in Northern California's power grid have combined to create a situation where public safety takes precedence over power quality.As a result, we're working to drive awareness of home standby generators in this part of the country, through television and digital advertising to promote the category."""
big pop to a new high after today's close.
"Great earnings and first dividend increase since 2014.Should be a good day tomorrow and after we get past this Covid event,future is bright.Looking for a major infrastructure bill coming,since both Dems and Reps are on board."
that mess in Texas with ice adn snow gonna mean more desire to move more power all over... that means poles... Valmont does poles.
Valmont Industries is down 6.34% to 230.10
Escalator up and elevator down.
Just a few additions to electric infrastructure would greatly increase wind power availability.Valmont most likely would benefit.https://www.energy.gov/eere/articles/report-shows-new-transmission-can-help-wind-energy-supply-third-us-electricity
"Valmont announces agreement with Locweld,the largest lattice structure company in North America.This should allow Valmont's India lattice manufacturer to export product to Locweld.Good deal for both companies.http://locweld.com/en/locweld-announces-exclusive-partnership-with-valmont-utility/"
"Comments from Artisan Partners on Valmont""Valmont is a leading designer and manufacturer of engineered metal products. Its portfolio includes metal and concrete poles for traffic lighting, cell towers and highway signs, utility support structures such as poles for transmission lines and a single-axis solar tracker for utilityscale solar installations and electric-powered, center-pivot irrigation systems that efficiently irrigate fields ranging from 4 to 500 acres. The company is led by a new management team we believe is positioning it to benefit from several secular and cyclical tailwinds. These include accelerating spending for solar, wind and 5G infrastructure, and renewed irrigation investments in international markets—Egypt and Kazakhstan in particular—to ensure more efficient (reducing water usage by 50%), reliable and secure food production following disruptions in food/commodity supplies during the COVID-19 pandemic. With shares trading at an attractive price relative to our private market value estimate and a compelling growth runway ahead, we added to our position during the quarter."""
"Valmont benefitting from 5G.Here is link to article and video,about Valmont's Site Pro 1 revolutionary new adaptive pole cell mounts.https://www.sitepro1.com/APT"
Looks like California needs a lot of new poles.PGE utility cutting off electricity due to concern about bad infrastructure causing fires during high winds.
"Valmont moving into solar and renewables should be a benefit.The European wind turbine structure company,solar tracker company and now Brazil solar.Here is article on renewables growing fast.http://www.usfunds.com/investor-library/frank-talk/why-were-overweighting-renewable-energy/#.XuJtREV05FQ"
"Some comments I found,by head of a major miner.Friedland also said that China is “light years” ahead of the United States “in the thoughtful, intelligent design of their national grid;” called the American grid, now well over 100 years old, “a joke by comparison,” and estimated that it will take “tens of trillions of dollars” to upgrade it from “a mishmash of pieces that are all mismatched” and into one that is designed to accommodate alternative energy. “Designing a new electrical grid for America alone will take astronomic amounts of the right metals,” he said, “and it will have to be done.”"
Lot of talk about 5G expansion and infrastructure investment.Both should be positive for Valmont.
I tip my hat to the management team at Valmont.... Clearly the best in the industry without question..
$VMI infrastructure could be key to restoring lost jobs following the pandemic - this account is calling its shot and its worth a follow for more recommendations https://twitter.com/Clifton_Capital/status/1269661290319933440
