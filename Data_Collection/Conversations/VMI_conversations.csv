"Some comments I found,by head of a major miner.Friedland also said that China is “light years” ahead of the United States “in the thoughtful, intelligent design of their national grid;” called the American grid, now well over 100 years old, “a joke by comparison,” and estimated that it will take “tens of trillions of dollars” to upgrade it from “a mishmash of pieces that are all mismatched” and into one that is designed to accommodate alternative energy. “Designing a new electrical grid for America alone will take astronomic amounts of the right metals,” he said, “and it will have to be done.”"

"VMI should make an offer to buy competitor LNN at depressed low 52-week lows, now under 70. Small cap LNN will show better earnings 2 years in the future. However, there might be opposition big buying smaller firm.Farmers better days after cycle lows IMO."
"Here's some comments from the Generac 3rd quarter conference call yesterday.They take about the underinvestment in utility infrastructure driving sales of generators for Generac.Seems like the upgrading of utility infrastructure will be a great market for Valmont for years to come.""Power outages have steadily increased in frequency and duration over the last 25 years, primarily due to under-investment in the electrical grid which has left it more vulnerable to the increasingly unpredictable and more severe weather patterns that are being driven by a change in climate. In addition to the direct impacts from severe weather that cause power outages, the indirect effects of an increase in the conditions that cause wildfires is creating a much higher level of interest in backup power, as utility companies have announced their intentions to shutdown huge portions of their service areas to prevent their equipment from potentially causing a catastrophic fire.In California where penetration rates of home standby generators stand at less than 1%, we have seen a dramatic increase in the number of in-home consultations and other leading indicators that continue to point to the rapid expansion of this market. Over the last three weeks, local utilities have triggered numerous shut-offs impacting millions of customers as they seek to mitigate the risk of wildfires.These shut-offs have been multi-day events and are projected to continue in the years ahead as the impact of climate change and the massive under-investment in Northern California's power grid have combined to create a situation where public safety takes precedence over power quality.As a result, we're working to drive awareness of home standby generators in this part of the country, through television and digital advertising to promote the category."""

Just a few additions to electric infrastructure would greatly increase wind power availability.Valmont most likely would benefit.https://www.energy.gov/eere/articles/report-shows-new-transmission-can-help-wind-energy-supply-third-us-electricity
"Comments from Artisan Partners on Valmont""Valmont is a leading designer and manufacturer of engineered metal products. Its portfolio includes metal and concrete poles for traffic lighting, cell towers and highway signs, utility support structures such as poles for transmission lines and a single-axis solar tracker for utilityscale solar installations and electric-powered, center-pivot irrigation systems that efficiently irrigate fields ranging from 4 to 500 acres. The company is led by a new management team we believe is positioning it to benefit from several secular and cyclical tailwinds. These include accelerating spending for solar, wind and 5G infrastructure, and renewed irrigation investments in international markets—Egypt and Kazakhstan in particular—to ensure more efficient (reducing water usage by 50%), reliable and secure food production following disruptions in food/commodity supplies during the COVID-19 pandemic. With shares trading at an attractive price relative to our private market value estimate and a compelling growth runway ahead, we added to our position during the quarter."""
