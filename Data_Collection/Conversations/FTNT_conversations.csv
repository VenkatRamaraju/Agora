5 star analyst DAN IVES rated buy to $180
What are we missing? Such great earnings and great guidance
Not sure I quite understand todays selling. The stock has been going up all year so it can't be for the tax write off. Why would sell now and have to report your gains in April when you can wait 2 weeks and not have to report for 16 months. I must be missing something.
"GOOD NEWS-""Fortinet partnering with Amazon Web Services (AMZN) to provide customers with security across their cloud platforms, applications, and network""The cybersecurity company said its cloud security products are designed to protect workloads and business applications across on-premises data centers and cloud environments."
* Fortinet Inc : BMO raises price target to $90 from $76 * Fortinet Inc : Credit Suisse raises target price to $60 from $52 * Fortinet Inc : Deutsche Bank raises price target to $80 from $70 * Fortinet Inc : JP Morgan raises price target to $93 from $76 * Fortinet Inc : Stifel raises target price to $85 from $72 * Fortinet Inc : UBS cuts target price to $88 from $90
this is a stock at a good value with good fundamental and a ev/ebitda
"Mind blown... CVNA fails to deliver on anything - including a money making business model, and stock jumps huge. FTNT has a solid beat, and drops. This market makes less sense by the day."
"I'll say this this: as an IT professional for 30 years, I've seen a lot of companies do things wrong, and I've seen a few do things right. Fortinet does them right."
just bought in at 76.24 small position ( 75 shares ) maybe not the bottom but I believe very close taking a small risk up 51% for year in my portfolio so why not. good luck everyone
350 coming soon!
This goes green tomorrow. Solid earnings beat. Price manipulation at its finest.
Here we go!
Cisco SE here. These guys make the best firewalls in the industry IMO.
"This stock is a legend in the making, lol."
Can someone explain why Crowdstrike and PANW went way up today but FTNT dropped??
"Moves down less than the market when it falls and goes up more...see, this is what you want :)"
FTNT is named fastest growing SD-WAN vendor. The ER is going to be excellent
How does this company products compare to HP Enterprise ?
"Revenue up 19% y/y, product revenue up 14% y/y, service revenue up 22% y/y, billings up 20% y/y, EPS of $0,88, fcf of $186 mln"
"Check their history online, the share price always goes up 14-20% after exceed earning expectations. Today will not be different as they are going to beat expectations."
don't understand the complaining about the shorts. there is barely any short activity in this company
"VERY unhealthy action today. Taking profits/selling into the EoY is bad juju. Time to skee-daddy. Putting my money ""into INTU"", and CBRE."
"I am absolutely stunned and shocked in disbelief. I have never ever seen this happening to any stock which is not bloated by any means and had an amazing quarter. Anyways, that's Wall Street for you!"
"Salamander, aka ""Kevin"", how ya doing? You still with us? If you liked $211, you are gonna love $400."
Again STELLAR quarter and once again down but cheese burgers are up 6 bucks ! I expect 3 down days than the race to 100. Ground Hogs day earnings again like last quarter the slide than new highs
"Second Quarter 2020 Highlights Total revenue of $615.5 million , up 18% year over yearProduct revenue of $211.9 million , up 12% year over yearBillings of $711.5 million , up 14% year over year1Deferred revenue of $2.32 billion , up 24% year over yearGAAP operating margin of 19.0%, up 460 basis points year over yearNon-GAAP operating margin of 27.3%, up 370 basis points year over year1GAAP diluted net income per share of $0.68 Non-GAAP diluted net income per share of $0.82 1Cash flow from operations of $247.0 million"
A very solid stock. Hope the best for today's earning report.
"So Billings is the only metric they missed according to the analysts, they missed by $600k. And the stock drops 7% when all other metrics got blown out, I have never seen this. Wow so disappointing"
"This $110 price is literally a gift. This earnings report, guidance, and valuation make FTNT impossible not to buy. At this price point a takeover is not out of the question."
Raymond James upgrades Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT) from Market Perform to Outperform with a $133 target.
I almost feel bad for those shorts that were here bashing us over the past 2 weeks. Almost.
This company knows how to make money!
"We keep winning awards in the industry but we are not moving. $PANW earnings today should boost us, I hope."
"In the wake of yesterday's earnings release, 9 different firms raised the price target on FTNT: Oppenheimer from 88 to 97; RBC Capital from 76 to 85; Barclay's from 90 to 92; BMO from 78 to 90; Credit Suisse from 60 to 70; Dougherty from 85 to 96; Morgan-Stanley from80 to 84; Monness Crespi from 91 to 95; and Northland Capital from 89 to 100. That's an average increase of more than $8 a share. Which is why I bought into today's selloff, assuming it was due to some misguided entity trying to support their short position."
Down 8% wow  ouch longs almost in correction territory
Just doubled down
What beats earning across the board and drops 6%?The market is a joke.
Wow  did they warn crashing down $10
somebody has to be doing due diligence. this thing just goes up.
any news why it is so weak?
Fortinet reached an all time high at 325.29
got me confused bought 200 @ 81.30 avg 83.80 will hold through earnings.
Company continues to build strong industry wide partnerships and continues to innovate within their product line. They have the fastest SSL deep packet inspection dollar for dollar. I don't see a slow down anytime soon. All other players seem to be doing the same old things and over priced per performance. Not saying $FTNT is the best but investment wise they haven't flat lined in growth.
Fortinet Recognized as Winner of Microsoft’s 2020 Commercial Marketplace Partner of the Year |
Wall street has no love for this company no matter if they beat top and bottom on every earning.earnings is around the corner hope I'm proved wrong.
"FTNT is a solid company with excellent products. Their Fortigate 4400F is the hyperscale firewall needed in lots of business. Check out Fortinet.Blog. Their price went down with great earnings but be patient, it will go up within one week. That is what happened to DOCU and BABA. Within one week after the drop, their price hit the new high. I bought more shares at dips."
400 by end of the year!!!
"Between Ken & Michael Xie, they own approximately 17-18% of the shares outstanding. Buying back shares increases their net worth. Very simple explanation, given Ken is the CEO & Michael is the CTO. Nothing like keeping it in the family! FTNT, from time to time, has made acquisitions which are complementary to their core businesses."
Why the 10 point drop????
"all my watched stocks FTNT, JNPR, CKPT, PANW all behaved the same way. FTNT had the lowest % loss."
Look at it go today. Will be 350 before long.
"Keeping in mind some commentary by Cramer the other day, about illogically delayed market reactions to good news, like happened with AMD recently. Some analyst(s) will react favorably to this good report, and then it should go. I have long horizon on this one, so I can wait."
I’m new to investing so I’m hoping someone can help explain why FTNT increased their share buy back by 1100% or 962 million from 2019 causing a -88m free cash flow? Could this money not be better spent reinvested back into the business?
gd gracious .. I really regret not holding this stock. This is probably one of the best performing tech stock. Strong armour during red days as well.
BIG seller sticking very close to the '10 day'. Look at our beautiful 6 mth trend. Will be ticking up from here. If I only had more cash...
"Stronger prospectus than Fireeye , bigger market share and books in better shape - stock should rise.FIreve now cost too much whereas FTNT has potential to go up by another 15 bucks at the min"
Would love to know why a company with the best balance sheet of all the cyber security stocks is getting no attention while others with less cash on hand are being bought up like they are the Tesla of Cybersecurity.
"I work in the same sector but not for this company unfortunately and I know these guys are a beast. Their business model is flawless! Analyse the stock for Debt/Equity, Current Ratio etc and everything is what Warren Buffett would have liked. I must admit that I was too scared yesterday and missed to buy a dip at 85. I honestly don't think it will dip more than 80 by looking at company strength and all financials. Hopefully there will be at least one more opportunity to buy in 80s and then rack up 30-40% when market is back."
Anyone know what happened at 10:30 or so to set FTNT soaring on high volume? I don't see any news.
100 Stock!
Why down on a day when everything is up? Looked around and can't find any negative news.
Great results! congrats
Just profit taking from 52 week high. Will be back up soon. GLTL.
Just added more @ 125.79.
Why is it down on beat? was the guidance poor?
Check out dht ... they have a yield of approx 25%. And they are undervalued...stock worth 5.65 ... yet on the balance sheet worth 9 to 10.
What is the news
what happened today? falling like a rock.!!!!
No one talks on this board but this company has strong potential ...
"I shorted this at 111 and 151 and don't intend to cover......said ""THE LEGEND"", rofl"
"Just hang in there, the lower it drops, the higher it will bounce!"
They are posting they had soft earnings!??? What kind of excuse is this from Stellar to soft.
All I Know is IBD has it rated STRONG BUY and $AMD....RSI is flying
every dip buy this!!!! who cares about the analysts same once pumping FANG stocks to all time highs
Crowdsource reported today and didn't meet expectations
"My problem is do I buy FTNT or EA ? Both are near to the same price. Both stocks are well positioned with cash, little debt. Nice problem to have but funds for only one."
"Just glad it didn't fall further, ALWAYS drops after earnings. Anxious to see next week, I think we have built the momentum and it will be back to going up."
OK BIG MOUTH'S WE GOT A 52 WEEK HIGH. NEXT JUMP WE BECOME A TRIPLE DIGIT COMPANY
FTNT is rallying in to their earnings next week. Great company with a great story!!!
220 soon
Printing 100 on this
"Dougherty & Co. upgrades Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT) from Neutral to Buy with an $85 price target, a 17% upside to Friday’s close."
I’ll buy in at $200!
I really would of expected at least 80-85 but this is manipulation
We break out this week into new 52 week highs. I think we close the week at around 160+
"They expect fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings of $0.95 to $0.97 per share on revenue of $710.0 million to $730.0 million. The current consensus earnings estimate is $0.87 per share on revenue of $703.71 million for the quarter ending December 31, 2020."
Not an unfair point but as along term holder of the stock I’m still high on the future and the overall investment had been very positive.
How are people feeling about FTNT running up to earnings?
$110-120 buy out candidate. Security space will be in focus in coming months
Ayyye just took a big ol half a dip but we still strong boys. Stocks doesn’t move like others between averages. IMO no debt and free cash flow is better than over 90% of tech companies rn.
Fortinet reached an all time high at 336.61
"100% going lower after earnings BUT just a matter of how low.......NO stock goes from $150+ to $118 during the quarter, and $133 to $118 in the week before earnings, IF business were good. Sorry to be the one to tell you all the obvious."
This thing is going to 100 soon. The applications for their products are growing. Their products and technologies will be in many future products from autos to cell phones. A take out at 150 would not surprise me at all.
"How can this stock possibly be a buy at these levels ? I get the need based on increased ransom risk, but trading at 84 times earings it needs to come down a whole bunch to be a good buy."
$1000 per share might be possible within next 24 months
Goldman Sachs raises Price Target from 129.00 to 140.00
"This was a great report, I'm in. The markets make absolutely no sense now. CVNA, which missed revenue estimates, didn't give guidance, and has huge inventory problems (they sell cars on line) went up $48 or 28%. FTNT beat on top and bottom line, gave great guidance, and drops 7%."
We got a big climb back to 94.37. Even with earning blowout still might not hit triple digits: YET . Long and Strong and no talking on this board. We are ranked #2 on I.B.D.
Analyst just put a price target on Fortinet at $355. This should be huge bullish news for today right?
I am new to this. Did I miss the boat?
Wow just fell $15 in seconds wow on good news 
i love this company..they just aren't that exciting to talk about.
FTNT just put a dent in the Cyber security marketplace. Hard to argue the capabilities of this company and I have no doubt in my mind once they announce earnings we will see at a move to 125. We might hit 115 before the end of the day!
Fortinet reached an all time high at 330.19
"Something very not good going on. We haven't ticked up in 5 weeks, and somebody keeps dumping loads of shares. Time to skee-daddy."
The TAM for security is way to low. This company and others in the industry will see significant revenue growth over next 10 years…..and corresponding stock price appreciation.
Wow $345 to $333 with market at high of the day did they miss & warn???
https://discord.gg/GE6Mffk
The numbers are incredible and they got a load of cash... Where is the Volume ? Everything grew in green......
Crashing on high volume not good  this is the beginning of the end
what makes this stock dipping ????
"Good earnings or not, I don't care about short term. Tomorrow the stock could plunge 15% and I would still hold. See you in 2022"

"They always give a good quarter. What I do not get , they are ranked #1 but never revisited it's 52 week high"
Do not trust Goldman Sacks
goes up 5 percent every week I'm up over 100 percent look at the 6 month chart!
We are 2% away from buy point of 88.70...The cup and handle show this
Congrats on what. This company is Flawless and this is the after hours reward we get
got in at $123 today finally waited like 2 months but PT is $124 great company!
"OMG, I've never seen something like this stock..."
BEAT AND GUIDANCE UP-UPGRADES COMING-SEE 86 excuse caps
long term holder. great stock.
why it dropped so much today?
"Been waiting for weeks to buy FTNT at below 110. Finally the moment has arrived. Take advantage of this quick pull back, it's gonna make it beyond 120 soon!"
SRPT going in S & P 500 should cause more institutional ownership
"It’s time to add more. Always add at the 52 week highs, it helps the stock go up ;)"

"Where are you at ""Kevin"", ""The Legend""??? Get you some!!!"
"Earnings tomorrow, a likely beat, but with this stock it's anyone's guess where it goes."
"Stock Market will always reward companies that grow and have good fundamentals. The shorts will get squeezed, but never admit it and tell you how good they are. The market is the reason the stock is down not the stock. If you get out you will probably regret it later on."
"Their future Q3 guidance is even above the consensus. So, this should be flying to the moon."
"Huge fan of this stock and company, but not a lot of movement in SP. Can anyone provide real insight on this company? Do they have a superior product vs competitors? I like that it doesn't get a lot of attention yet, but don't understand why. Do you think this will change over time with an increase need for security? Am I missing the ball all together, or is this a good company to be holding for the long term? I'm kicking myself for selling a lot of NVDA awhile back (obviously different animal), but is FTNT an up and comer with legs to run?? They blow out earnings and guidance regularly but the stock doesn't get a lot of attention.. Am I missing something, looking for real responses from Tech people and and investment professional perspective..."
Overvalued….pe ratio close to a 100 and peg ratio over 4…not good
Cowen & Co just gave FTNT a $250 price target. A legend in the making.
The Goldman Analyst only has a 50% success rate with FTNT and a 1.5 star rating out of 5 . Don't sell base on that report. I tried to post this on Friday however it would not post.
Fortinet has good news with Lynksis. Why is the stock down huge?
