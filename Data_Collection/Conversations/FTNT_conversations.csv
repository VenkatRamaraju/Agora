"Wall Street will be looking for positivity from FTNT as it approaches its next earnings report date. On that day, FTNT is projected to report earnings of $0.70 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 52.17%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $568.62 million, up 20.32% from the year-ago period.......WOW"
FTNT reached an all time high at 107.77
EPS BEATS BY 0.10 UP ON REVENUE
"My problem is do I buy FTNT or EA ? Both are near to the same price. Both stocks are well positioned with cash, little debt. Nice problem to have but funds for only one."
We took a pounding off 19% off highs. We got room to run and ground to make up.. There will be upgrades in the morning
Fortinet THE GREAT ;)
"$SQ and $FTNT 2 BULLS ,Heading to 52 week highs"

Heard this stock should be at like 500
No one is buying blocks of 100 !?
Fortinet is up 4.98% to 285.79
$110-120 buy out candidate. Security space will be in focus in coming months
"GOOD NEWS-""Fortinet partnering with Amazon Web Services (AMZN) to provide customers with security across their cloud platforms, applications, and network""The cybersecurity company said its cloud security products are designed to protect workloads and business applications across on-premises data centers and cloud environments."
"Two sides of the coin. If someone is selling, someone is buying. I’m with the latter."
"They always give a good quarter. What I do not get , they are ranked #1 but never revisited it's 52 week high"
Congrats on what. This company is Flawless and this is the after hours reward we get

"Stay secure, buy FTNT."
I love when I pick a winner and the haters come out in full force. The Force is strong here.
News like this should drive Cyber security stocks & FTNT is the safest & best choice!!!https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/15/hackers-appear-to-target-twitter-accounts-of-elon-musk-bill-gates-others-in-digital-currency-scam.html
Fortinet Recognized as Winner of Microsoft’s 2020 Commercial Marketplace Partner of the Year |
Just doubled down
"Stronger prospectus than Fireeye , bigger market share and books in better shape - stock should rise.FIreve now cost too much whereas FTNT has potential to go up by another 15 bucks at the min"
Earning surprise of +10 % for Q2.FTNT has consistently exceeded the expectations by average 10%.
We are 2% away from buy point of 88.70...The cup and handle show this
"Just glad it didn't fall further, ALWAYS drops after earnings. Anxious to see next week, I think we have built the momentum and it will be back to going up."
Why is this dropping despite the breaking news today?
This thing is going to 100 soon. The applications for their products are growing. Their products and technologies will be in many future products from autos to cell phones. A take out at 150 would not surprise me at all.
nice beat
gd gracious .. I really regret not holding this stock. This is probably one of the best performing tech stock. Strong armour during red days as well.
good earnings 
$FTNT and $PANW rule this sector got to love their charts
"This is hands down the best cybersecurity investment because - $5 PER SHARE DATA443 (ATDSD) IS FAST-GROWING TINY MICROCAP THAT HAS WHAT EVERY CYBERSECURITY COMPANY WANTS AND NEEDS – DATA443 USERS CANNOT BE HELD RANSOM – EXPECT BUYOUT BY THE BIG BOYS!• DATA443 is a very small microcap company with shares selling close to $5.00 and a small number of outstanding shares estimated at about 750,000 supporting a market cap under $5 million in a currently $165 Billion Cybersecurity market• DATA443 is the ONE AND ONLY cybersecurity solution that prevents cybercrime victims from being locked out of their computer and also prevents data from being stolen• DATA443 automatically encrypts data so hackers are not able to use the stolen data rendering their efforts worthless• When hacked, DATA443 users only have to reboot their computer and all data is automatically restored and computers function normally• The unmet need for DATA443 solutions is enormous because the high rate of successful cyberattacks for ransom indicates current solutions do not work well enough• DATA443 early sales are running at close to $4 million annually and appear positioned for what could be several magnitudes of growth• DATA443 just announced a new recurring 6 figure contract with Fortune 500 company• DATA443 plans to up list to NASDAQ as soon as shares qualify which is expected in about 45 days• DATA443 has firm commitment from MAXIM GROUP for $13.8 million that funds about $10 million net as soon as shares are trading on NASDAQ"
I am very pleased with the price performance of FTNT this year. Same as in prior years.
"This stock is a legend in the making, lol."
How does this company products compare to HP Enterprise ?
Made IBD Top 50. doesn't hurt.
got me confused bought 200 @ 81.30 avg 83.80 will hold through earnings.
"The only problem is FTNT is quickly becoming too much of my portfolio, and I don't want to sell any. I guess a good problem to have?"
We just hit $210. Who shorted at $111?

long term holder. great stock.
FTNT down $20 wow  terrible momentum busting earnings anyone feeling pain?
"Down grade lasted 1 day , 12 hours to long"
Merry Christmas !!!
"They crushed it,. China does not affect them. They had 2 big buy backs of their shares.... Long term guidance is heading to orbit"
I heard $FTNT is merging with $NTNX in near future.
Confirmed Uptrend about time.
zoom zoom....flying away.
"This was a great report, I'm in. The markets make absolutely no sense now. CVNA, which missed revenue estimates, didn't give guidance, and has huge inventory problems (they sell cars on line) went up $48 or 28%. FTNT beat on top and bottom line, gave great guidance, and drops 7%."
What is the reason for the recent pop-up ?
* Fortinet Inc : BMO raises price target to $90 from $76 * Fortinet Inc : Credit Suisse raises target price to $60 from $52 * Fortinet Inc : Deutsche Bank raises price target to $80 from $70 * Fortinet Inc : JP Morgan raises price target to $93 from $76 * Fortinet Inc : Stifel raises target price to $85 from $72 * Fortinet Inc : UBS cuts target price to $88 from $90
Why down on a day when everything is up? Looked around and can't find any negative news.
Love Fortinet! I'll keep buying the dips.
The numbers are nuts. Year over Year growth is incredible...
just bought in at 76.24 small position ( 75 shares ) maybe not the bottom but I believe very close taking a small risk up 51% for year in my portfolio so why not. good luck everyone
"Man, why did it dip so hard on great news. I’ve been tracking this one looking for an opportunity to jump in. Took the plunge at 126. Let’s see..."
This was my favorite race horse but is it resting or ready for the glue factory ?
Not a lot of AH volume on this drop.
"This is merely a break and a fantastic opportunity, what a great stock."
Ayyye just took a big ol half a dip but we still strong boys. Stocks doesn’t move like others between averages. IMO no debt and free cash flow is better than over 90% of tech companies rn.
"Fartinet  takes months and months to rise $10, and goes down $10 in one morning, it’s done this 10x in the past 6 months, insiders use this stock as their own personal ATM machine"
"A great company but the stock action is such a slog. Still cautious , no after hours movement."
"Raised to $91.00 at Monness Crespi & Hardt,,,,, Oppenheimer: Buy Fortinet on post-earnings pullback.... Patriot one insider buy! Insider buying!"
"I'll say this this: as an IT professional for 30 years, I've seen a lot of companies do things wrong, and I've seen a few do things right. Fortinet does them right."
Price target adjusted to $300 by Oppenheimer :)
Crashing on high volume not good  this is the beginning of the end
prepared to buy tomorrow.... seems a deal here
Wow just fell $15 in seconds wow on good news 
this is a stock at a good value with good fundamental and a ev/ebitda
In a channel from 130 to 133
The volume STRONG and moving up. buy out? or big beat.
"All I know is we keep getting contracts for the SD-WAN , I do not get it. Broken stock but the company is rock solid"
"Fortinet, Inc growth is eye catching until last quarter (decline). I see BlackBerry (BB) is having good revenue growth YOY and quarter over quarter. I see the stock to double in next 1 to 2 years."
Got shares @ 114 & 116 just as predicted
every dip buy this!!!! who cares about the analysts same once pumping FANG stocks to all time highs
"same happened to FFIV, great earnings but it tanked after hours and before market best day, sorry guys"
$547m and 67eps
Still @ $280 I saw  in after hours?
"Good earnings or not, I don't care about short term. Tomorrow the stock could plunge 15% and I would still hold. See you in 2022"
Why is this down
$1000 per share might be possible within next 24 months
"SWI is great ... Your guys will follow just like FSLY , AYX , SNOW .On the long run probably you well end up like FEYE ."
The Goldman Analyst only has a 50% success rate with FTNT and a 1.5 star rating out of 5 . Don't sell base on that report. I tried to post this on Friday however it would not post.
Cowen & Co just gave FTNT a $250 price target. A legend in the making.
What are we missing? Such great earnings and great guidance
"Huge fan of this stock and company, but not a lot of movement in SP. Can anyone provide real insight on this company? Do they have a superior product vs competitors? I like that it doesn't get a lot of attention yet, but don't understand why. Do you think this will change over time with an increase need for security? Am I missing the ball all together, or is this a good company to be holding for the long term? I'm kicking myself for selling a lot of NVDA awhile back (obviously different animal), but is FTNT an up and comer with legs to run?? They blow out earnings and guidance regularly but the stock doesn't get a lot of attention.. Am I missing something, looking for real responses from Tech people and and investment professional perspective..."
Crowdsource reported today and didn't meet expectations
WTH. I've never seen FTNT drop this much percentage wise in 1 day.
"Sept of 2018 and April 2019 waiting for the prices we are at now plus Flawless Quarters , It's about time.."
"I am absolutely stunned and shocked in disbelief. I have never ever seen this happening to any stock which is not bloated by any means and had an amazing quarter. Anyways, that's Wall Street for you!"
"We're still behind you 110%. We've seen first-hand how clean and efficient your platform is. Keep up the good work; it'll come back to you, and us, in spades."
Where is the best place to get real time conversations about stocks?
somebody has to be doing due diligence. this thing just goes up.
Here we go!
Cisco SE here. These guys make the best firewalls in the industry IMO.
I am doubting if any pullback is due in fortinet
hi guy took your advice in at 126 look n good thank you
"FTNT is a solid company with excellent products. Their Fortigate 4400F is the hyperscale firewall needed in lots of business. Check out Fortinet.Blog. Their price went down with great earnings but be patient, it will go up within one week. That is what happened to DOCU and BABA. Within one week after the drop, their price hit the new high. I bought more shares at dips."
"Supercharger , long time holder."
"Between Ken & Michael Xie, they own approximately 17-18% of the shares outstanding. Buying back shares increases their net worth. Very simple explanation, given Ken is the CEO & Michael is the CTO. Nothing like keeping it in the family! FTNT, from time to time, has made acquisitions which are complementary to their core businesses."
We break out this week into new 52 week highs. I think we close the week at around 160+
"We just got listed in I.B.D top 10 we replaced PANW. Now be quiet please,, no talking on this board"
Rotation out of tech. I've seen this before. Not worried. Going to buy the dips. Won't be here for too long :)
"Canada Post just had a massive data breach. Should expect cybersecurity stocks to get a boost as large companies continue to lose big bucks and down time due to hackers. Of course, the other option is to increase the security of their data. What a novel idea!"
Everyone is a technical genius of coarse it broke down pass moving average. The entire market has been beaten up and a down grade from a well know #$%$. I will wait for earnings . Long and strong and no talking on this board....
How does this stock perform after an earnings release? They always beat but what about the stock price? Do they usually gain?
what the heck does this company need to do for stock to go upwards on earnings?
what happened today? falling like a rock.!!!!
any news why it is so weak?
Again STELLAR quarter and once again down but cheese burgers are up 6 bucks ! I expect 3 down days than the race to 100. Ground Hogs day earnings again like last quarter the slide than new highs
I'm up 110 percent in 7 months!
OK BIG MOUTH'S WE GOT A 52 WEEK HIGH. NEXT JUMP WE BECOME A TRIPLE DIGIT COMPANY

PT Raised to $120.00 at Bank of America
Not sure I quite understand todays selling. The stock has been going up all year so it can't be for the tax write off. Why would sell now and have to report your gains in April when you can wait 2 weeks and not have to report for 16 months. I must be missing something.
All systems go
This company has been doing the right things for 10 years. Q1 consensus EPS is .55. They'll blow right thru that number.
Best day in awhile-solid co-with blow out earnings-it will get back 90S +
"Is anyone aware of any actual recent developments that would explain the continuous move up? Peer group goes down while FTNT bucks the trend. Stock acting fantastic, but wondering if a buyout would explain action"
I am new to this. Did I miss the boat?
"similar thing with datadog, good earnings, stock tanks 15%"
I'd really like to hear why Citi downgraded to sell.
don't understand the complaining about the shorts. there is barely any short activity in this company
FTNT delivers an ROI of 37 %. Great company that is acting extremely bullish today!!!
The numbers are incredible and they got a load of cash... Where is the Volume ? Everything grew in green......
"Salamander, aka ""Kevin"", how ya doing? You still with us? If you liked $211, you are gonna love $400."
100 Stock!
"This $110 price is literally a gift. This earnings report, guidance, and valuation make FTNT impossible not to buy. At this price point a takeover is not out of the question."
"I shorted this at 111 and 151 and don't intend to cover......said ""THE LEGEND"", rofl"
"In the wake of yesterday's earnings release, 9 different firms raised the price target on FTNT: Oppenheimer from 88 to 97; RBC Capital from 76 to 85; Barclay's from 90 to 92; BMO from 78 to 90; Credit Suisse from 60 to 70; Dougherty from 85 to 96; Morgan-Stanley from80 to 84; Monness Crespi from 91 to 95; and Northland Capital from 89 to 100. That's an average increase of more than $8 a share. Which is why I bought into today's selloff, assuming it was due to some misguided entity trying to support their short position."
I heard about FTNT the other day on (http://Rightpicker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
When will this stock pull back...?
"Earnings tomorrow, a likely beat, but with this stock it's anyone's guess where it goes."
Breaking News. Fortinet just created a world record.https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/08/06/2074284/0/en/Fortinet-Introduces-the-World-s-First-Hyperscale-Firewall.html
correction to my prior post..... $90 per share take out?? somebody big got to pick this up.
"Fortinet Inc. (FTNT) on Thursday reported second-quarter earnings of $112.1 million. The Sunnyvale, California-based company said it had profit of 68 cents per share. Earnings, adjusted for one-time gains and costs, were 82 cents per share."
FTNT is named fastest growing SD-WAN vendor. The ER is going to be excellent
"Of course the goofs downgraded it, they want to buy on the cheap. It is a good sign, the momentum is about to be incredible, will take out 140 extremely fast."
"Safe-T stock is the best bargain cloud cyber in the all market, thank me later"
Ok... knee-jerk reaction is over. It's an easy 10% to the upside.
No one talks on this board but this company has strong potential ...

Making quick work of 300 soon!!!
$277 LOL  momentum buster R.I.P.
This will be 140 here quickly....
why it dropped so much today?
A very solid stock. Hope the best for today's earning report.
Load up. If Microsoft buys Tic Tok then guess who benefits....Fortinet! Gotta protect allll that new cloud data. Good luck investors
I’m new to investing so I’m hoping someone can help explain why FTNT increased their share buy back by 1100% or 962 million from 2019 causing a -88m free cash flow? Could this money not be better spent reinvested back into the business?
Ftnts security model is based on flawed design. It was ok for the last decade but not good for the more complex attacks of the cloud era http://www.thebarriergroup.com/asic-vs-standard-processing-chips/
Every day is a 52 week high with FTNT!!!!
Company continues to build strong industry wide partnerships and continues to innovate within their product line. They have the fastest SSL deep packet inspection dollar for dollar. I don't see a slow down anytime soon. All other players seem to be doing the same old things and over priced per performance. Not saying $FTNT is the best but investment wise they haven't flat lined in growth.
Short 150 & 111 not covering a single share
I know this company inside and out...they are a market leader in their field compared to their competitors for half the cost!!!!!
The TAM for security is way to low. This company and others in the industry will see significant revenue growth over next 10 years…..and corresponding stock price appreciation.
"Okay, this is strange. What's going on?"
Really brutal market reaction to a great performance. So sad!!!!
400 by end of the year!!!
FTNT just put a dent in the Cyber security marketplace. Hard to argue the capabilities of this company and I have no doubt in my mind once they announce earnings we will see at a move to 125. We might hit 115 before the end of the day!
I just don't get it beat the whisper number of .45 cents and all numbers look good and raise guidance.
"This is probably a perfect quarter, perfect guidance and they increase share buyback...what the frick am I missing here?"

Not an unfair point but as along term holder of the stock I’m still high on the future and the overall investment had been very positive.
I think this stock is being manipulatively held down for some people to cash out on massive gains after earning reports later this evening. Don't sell and fall for it.

There was no benefit from the accounting change related to product shipments.Excluding the software license benefit, product revenue growth would have been a strong 14%.14% growth? 14% growth? soon it will be in the single digits.Market Cap is way too high"
Hits 120 next week.

This goes green tomorrow. Solid earnings beat. Price manipulation at its finest.
I really would of expected at least 80-85 but this is manipulation
Added at $115.75
Ideal choice for COVID-19 and future. Nice buyout target for big companies. I will not be surprised if a buyout news comes out soon.
This will be at all time highs in one month

"Been waiting for weeks to buy FTNT at below 110. Finally the moment has arrived. Take advantage of this quick pull back, it's gonna make it beyond 120 soon!"
All I Know is IBD has it rated STRONG BUY and $AMD....RSI is flying
"They expect fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings of $0.95 to $0.97 per share on revenue of $710.0 million to $730.0 million. The current consensus earnings estimate is $0.87 per share on revenue of $703.71 million for the quarter ending December 31, 2020."

Great a interview with Phil on CNBC
Wall street has no love for this company no matter if they beat top and bottom on every earning.earnings is around the corner hope I'm proved wrong.
"FTNT is solid, not getting as affected by the techy fall."
"Totally Unjustified broken stock, great company"
They are posting they had soft earnings!??? What kind of excuse is this from Stellar to soft.
"How can this stock possibly be a buy at these levels ? I get the need based on increased ransom risk, but trading at 84 times earings it needs to come down a whole bunch to be a good buy."
Hope this goes up after earnings! Bought more today
"$70, 80 and $115 that's where I got in mostly. $118 was my last buy. Hows that for you ""legend.""???"
"$300 is on it's way quickly, get you some."

"I work in the same sector but not for this company unfortunately and I know these guys are a beast. Their business model is flawless! Analyse the stock for Debt/Equity, Current Ratio etc and everything is what Warren Buffett would have liked. I must admit that I was too scared yesterday and missed to buy a dip at 85. I honestly don't think it will dip more than 80 by looking at company strength and all financials. Hopefully there will be at least one more opportunity to buy in 80s and then rack up 30-40% when market is back."
Fortinet has good news with Lynksis. Why is the stock down huge?
FTNT beat. MMs playing same BS
Would love to know why a company with the best balance sheet of all the cyber security stocks is getting no attention while others with less cash on hand are being bought up like they are the Tesla of Cybersecurity.
I’ll buy in at $200!
"Moves down less than the market when it falls and goes up more...see, this is what you want :)"
a great stock to own.
extremely overvalued ... 140 / 150 before year end .
"Keeping in mind some commentary by Cramer the other day, about illogically delayed market reactions to good news, like happened with AMD recently. Some analyst(s) will react favorably to this good report, and then it should go. I have long horizon on this one, so I can wait."
We got a big climb back to 94.37. Even with earning blowout still might not hit triple digits: YET . Long and Strong and no talking on this board. We are ranked #2 on I.B.D.
Why is it down on beat? was the guidance poor?
"Just hang in there, the lower it drops, the higher it will bounce!"
ABOVE 50 AND 200 SMA
when is the summit?
BEAT AND GUIDANCE UP-UPGRADES COMING-SEE 86 excuse caps
In Fortinet a couple of weeks ago. I don’t want to add to it but is there any other names that are as interesting? Any suggestions are appreciated. Many thanks.
"Poor ""Kevin"", after today, he will probably have to change his name again, lol. Roasted on this and NVDA, smh."
"Incredibly odd, the ""need"" to sell 25-30,000shrs, the last 20 minutes of the day, of the company that is probably the most crucial platform in the world. Its like day-trading air, food, and water. Very odd, surprising, and absolutely counter-productive... and yet... they still do it."
Earnings looked good why down $30?
nice long term
"I think Xie needs to be more exciting in the CC. All I ever heard from annalist , during the Q & A is congratulation on the quarter."
nice job longs!
450 rev & q4 guidance 500 rev. sounds great.
Big beat! it will be easy over 90 tomorrow.
"Day traded by “whales”. Runs up and down, then up again, 10-15%. No worries. This is the leader in a crucial and necessary industry. We will resume uptick shortly."
Can someone explain why Crowdstrike and PANW went way up today but FTNT dropped??
"Why is it falling down, despite all the good numbers ! I fail to understand the logic- would be great to get some insights"
Why is after hour price not going up more??
This is great. Strong price up at close on higher volume several days. Maybe a take out in the works. I will sell my shares at $300. Come buy us IBM.
Anyone know what happened at 10:30 or so to set FTNT soaring on high volume? I don't see any news.
On a day like today and look at 1 year chart. third try to breakout!
FTNT is rallying in to their earnings next week. Great company with a great story!!!
"I am a new, I am asking for help. Should Dollar cost average or dump my short term lose. They pay no dividend"
Some robot must hit a wrong symbol for sell.
What beats earning across the board and drops 6%?The market is a joke.
FARTinet was $151 a year ago $147 now. Nice  “investment”.
5 star analyst DAN IVES rated buy to $180
I do not understand after 32 yrs in this Look who is saying to sell Goldcrap
HOME RUN 10 %
"Check their history online, the share price always goes up 14-20% after exceed earning expectations. Today will not be different as they are going to beat expectations."
Market is up almost 1% and this dog is struggling.. better companies out there that don't struggle like this..
"We keep winning awards in the industry but we are not moving. $PANW earnings today should boost us, I hope."
Now this #$%$ market cap is 30% bigger than Palo alto !!!! and only 20% less than crowd strike !!!! This will screw the baggies hard & dry while they are drunk with the 10% annual rev growth !!!!
THIS STOCK USUALLY GOES DOWN AFTER EVERY EARNINGS. NO MATTER HOW GOOD THE RESULTS ARE.
i love this company..they just aren't that exciting to talk about.
Going to 75
"Mind blown... CVNA fails to deliver on anything - including a money making business model, and stock jumps huge. FTNT has a solid beat, and drops. This market makes less sense by the day."
