Crowdsource reported today and didn't meet expectations
any news why it is so weak?
$1000 per share might be possible within next 24 months
Overvalued….pe ratio close to a 100 and peg ratio over 4…not good
Analyst just put a price target on Fortinet at $355. This should be huge bullish news for today right?
I’ll buy in at $200!
"It’s time to add more. Always add at the 52 week highs, it helps the stock go up ;)"
what makes this stock dipping ????
The TAM for security is way to low. This company and others in the industry will see significant revenue growth over next 10 years…..and corresponding stock price appreciation.
