"PANW has clearly started eating their lunch. See below from last conference call Product revenue growth accelerated to 17%, resulting in product revenue of $166 million. Product revenue included a $4.2 million benefit from the change in accounting relating to certain software licenses. There was no benefit from the accounting change related to product shipments.Excluding the software license benefit, product revenue growth would have been a strong 14%.14% growth? 14% growth? soon it will be in the single digits.Market Cap is way too high"
"The only problem is FTNT is quickly becoming too much of my portfolio, and I don't want to sell any. I guess a good problem to have?"
Big beat! it will be easy over 90 tomorrow.
The numbers are incredible and they got a load of cash... Where is the Volume ? Everything grew in green......
"Thinking of joining. I love the products, the net margine. A little worried about valuation. Y is it worth 60 pe with 20,% growth? R u guys assuming net margine will grow with bigger revenue?"
Why down on a day when everything is up? Looked around and can't find any negative news.
I'd really like to hear why Citi downgraded to sell.
"I am absolutely stunned and shocked in disbelief. I have never ever seen this happening to any stock which is not bloated by any means and had an amazing quarter. Anyways, that's Wall Street for you!"
This goes green tomorrow. Solid earnings beat. Price manipulation at its finest.
"As a share holder, the painful part is, this stock can up or down 5%, without any market news."
"I am a new, I am asking for help. Should Dollar cost average or dump my short term lose. They pay no dividend"
Ideal choice for COVID-19 and future. Nice buyout target for big companies. I will not be surprised if a buyout news comes out soon.
Ok... knee-jerk reaction is over. It's an easy 10% to the upside.
this is a stock at a good value with good fundamental and a ev/ebitda
I know this company inside and out...they are a market leader in their field compared to their competitors for half the cost!!!!!
Earning surprise of +10 % for Q2.FTNT has consistently exceeded the expectations by average 10%.
"This is probably a perfect quarter, perfect guidance and they increase share buyback...what the frick am I missing here?"
$547m and 67eps
"Stronger prospectus than Fireeye , bigger market share and books in better shape - stock should rise.FIreve now cost too much whereas FTNT has potential to go up by another 15 bucks at the min"
going to buy 100 shares and may the force be with me
what the heck does this company need to do for stock to go upwards on earnings?
No volume at all today but down for morning session.
The TAM for security is way to low. This company and others in the industry will see significant revenue growth over next 10 years…..and corresponding stock price appreciation.
Why is after hour price not going up more??
"Their future Q3 guidance is even above the consensus. So, this should be flying to the moon."
Why is this dropping despite the breaking news today?

Really brutal market reaction to a great performance. So sad!!!!
We break out this week into new 52 week highs. I think we close the week at around 160+
"Second Quarter 2020 Highlights Total revenue of $615.5 million , up 18% year over yearProduct revenue of $211.9 million , up 12% year over yearBillings of $711.5 million , up 14% year over year1Deferred revenue of $2.32 billion , up 24% year over yearGAAP operating margin of 19.0%, up 460 basis points year over yearNon-GAAP operating margin of 27.3%, up 370 basis points year over year1GAAP diluted net income per share of $0.68 Non-GAAP diluted net income per share of $0.82 1Cash flow from operations of $247.0 million"
This will be at all time highs in one month
"Financials are great, no reason to panic."
any news why it is so weak?
Anyone know what happened at 10:30 or so to set FTNT soaring on high volume? I don't see any news.
Here we go!
"Tech sector struggling AH, likely due to Apple sales miss. Might be rough tomorrow. The good news is our ER was stellar so we’re in good shape."
I'm up 110 percent in 7 months!
"Stay secure, buy FTNT."
"Moves down less than the market when it falls and goes up more...see, this is what you want :)"
Would love to know why a company with the best balance sheet of all the cyber security stocks is getting no attention while others with less cash on hand are being bought up like they are the Tesla of Cybersecurity.
"My problem is do I buy FTNT or EA ? Both are near to the same price. Both stocks are well positioned with cash, little debt. Nice problem to have but funds for only one."
Raymond James upgrades Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT) from Market Perform to Outperform with a $133 target.
"Salamander, aka ""Kevin"", how ya doing? You still with us? If you liked $211, you are gonna love $400."
Again STELLAR quarter and once again down but cheese burgers are up 6 bucks ! I expect 3 down days than the race to 100. Ground Hogs day earnings again like last quarter the slide than new highs
Cowen & Co just gave FTNT a $250 price target. A legend in the making.
The Goldman Analyst only has a 50% success rate with FTNT and a 1.5 star rating out of 5 . Don't sell base on that report. I tried to post this on Friday however it would not post.
"Good earnings or not, I don't care about short term. Tomorrow the stock could plunge 15% and I would still hold. See you in 2022"
good earnings 
Printing 100 on this
400 by end of the year!!!
"GOOD NEWS-""Fortinet partnering with Amazon Web Services (AMZN) to provide customers with security across their cloud platforms, applications, and network""The cybersecurity company said its cloud security products are designed to protect workloads and business applications across on-premises data centers and cloud environments."
Breaking News. Fortinet just created a world record.https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/08/06/2074284/0/en/Fortinet-Introduces-the-World-s-First-Hyperscale-Firewall.html
what happened today? falling like a rock.!!!!
We got a big climb back to 94.37. Even with earning blowout still might not hit triple digits: YET . Long and Strong and no talking on this board. We are ranked #2 on I.B.D.
"Wall Street will be looking for positivity from FTNT as it approaches its next earnings report date. On that day, FTNT is projected to report earnings of $0.70 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 52.17%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $568.62 million, up 20.32% from the year-ago period.......WOW"
"Keeping in mind some commentary by Cramer the other day, about illogically delayed market reactions to good news, like happened with AMD recently. Some analyst(s) will react favorably to this good report, and then it should go. I have long horizon on this one, so I can wait."
I just don't get it beat the whisper number of .45 cents and all numbers look good and raise guidance.
Best day in awhile-solid co-with blow out earnings-it will get back 90S +
"I have been waiting for this , we have a stock in Bull mode."
When will this stock pull back...?
THIS STOCK USUALLY GOES DOWN AFTER EVERY EARNINGS. NO MATTER HOW GOOD THE RESULTS ARE.
Fortinet THE GREAT ;)
All systems go
"So Billings is the only metric they missed according to the analysts, they missed by $600k. And the stock drops 7% when all other metrics got blown out, I have never seen this. Wow so disappointing"
"Man, why did it dip so hard on great news. I’ve been tracking this one looking for an opportunity to jump in. Took the plunge at 126. Let’s see..."
100 Stock!
Love Fortinet! I'll keep buying the dips.
Short 150 & 111 not covering a single share
"I'll say this this: as an IT professional for 30 years, I've seen a lot of companies do things wrong, and I've seen a few do things right. Fortinet does them right."
Crashing on high volume not good  this is the beginning of the end
"Incredibly odd, the ""need"" to sell 25-30,000shrs, the last 20 minutes of the day, of the company that is probably the most crucial platform in the world. Its like day-trading air, food, and water. Very odd, surprising, and absolutely counter-productive... and yet... they still do it."
Just added more @ 125.79.
"Down grade lasted 1 day , 12 hours to long"
This was my favorite race horse but is it resting or ready for the glue factory ?
"Dougherty & Co. upgrades Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT) from Neutral to Buy with an $85 price target, a 17% upside to Friday’s close."
"What are folks thoughts on why this stock got hammered like this, the quarterly numbers and guidance looked strong ."
long term holder. great stock.
We are 2% away from buy point of 88.70...The cup and handle show this
This company knows how to make money!
FTNT just put a dent in the Cyber security marketplace. Hard to argue the capabilities of this company and I have no doubt in my mind once they announce earnings we will see at a move to 125. We might hit 115 before the end of the day!
This thing is going to 100 soon. The applications for their products are growing. Their products and technologies will be in many future products from autos to cell phones. A take out at 150 would not surprise me at all.
I’m new to investing so I’m hoping someone can help explain why FTNT increased their share buy back by 1100% or 962 million from 2019 causing a -88m free cash flow? Could this money not be better spent reinvested back into the business?
Not an unfair point but as along term holder of the stock I’m still high on the future and the overall investment had been very positive.
"Huge fan of this stock and company, but not a lot of movement in SP. Can anyone provide real insight on this company? Do they have a superior product vs competitors? I like that it doesn't get a lot of attention yet, but don't understand why. Do you think this will change over time with an increase need for security? Am I missing the ball all together, or is this a good company to be holding for the long term? I'm kicking myself for selling a lot of NVDA awhile back (obviously different animal), but is FTNT an up and comer with legs to run?? They blow out earnings and guidance regularly but the stock doesn't get a lot of attention.. Am I missing something, looking for real responses from Tech people and and investment professional perspective..."
"Revenue up 19% y/y, product revenue up 14% y/y, service revenue up 22% y/y, billings up 20% y/y, EPS of $0,88, fcf of $186 mln"
SRPT going in S & P 500 should cause more institutional ownership
Great results! congrats
I heard about FTNT the other day on (http://Rightpicker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
nice long term
"This $110 price is literally a gift. This earnings report, guidance, and valuation make FTNT impossible not to buy. At this price point a takeover is not out of the question."
Every day is a 52 week high with FTNT!!!!
Why is it down on beat? was the guidance poor?
PT was upped to $154 on July 12... now it’s at $130... great buy point.
Made IBD Top 50. doesn't hurt.
The volume STRONG and moving up. buy out? or big beat.
Hope this goes up after earnings! Bought more today
got me confused bought 200 @ 81.30 avg 83.80 will hold through earnings.
"FTNT is solid, not getting as affected by the techy fall."
I am new to this. Did I miss the boat?
Making quick work of 300 soon!!!
"Is anyone aware of any actual recent developments that would explain the continuous move up? Peer group goes down while FTNT bucks the trend. Stock acting fantastic, but wondering if a buyout would explain action"
"Something very not good going on. We haven't ticked up in 5 weeks, and somebody keeps dumping loads of shares. Time to skee-daddy."
why it dropped so much today?
"Poor ""Kevin"", after today, he will probably have to change his name again, lol. Roasted on this and NVDA, smh."
"$300 is on it's way quickly, get you some."
They are posting they had soft earnings!??? What kind of excuse is this from Stellar to soft.
every dip buy this!!!! who cares about the analysts same once pumping FANG stocks to all time highs
"I think Xie needs to be more exciting in the CC. All I ever heard from annalist , during the Q & A is congratulation on the quarter."
I really find the price action a joke. The #1 company in the fastest growing industry Cyber security
Do not trust Goldman Sacks
"This was a great report, I'm in. The markets make absolutely no sense now. CVNA, which missed revenue estimates, didn't give guidance, and has huge inventory problems (they sell cars on line) went up $48 or 28%. FTNT beat on top and bottom line, gave great guidance, and drops 7%."
Price target adjusted to $300 by Oppenheimer :)
"FTNT is a solid company with excellent products. Their Fortigate 4400F is the hyperscale firewall needed in lots of business. Check out Fortinet.Blog. Their price went down with great earnings but be patient, it will go up within one week. That is what happened to DOCU and BABA. Within one week after the drop, their price hit the new high. I bought more shares at dips."
somebody has to be doing due diligence. this thing just goes up.
All I Know is IBD has it rated STRONG BUY and $AMD....RSI is flying
"Sept of 2018 and April 2019 waiting for the prices we are at now plus Flawless Quarters , It's about time.."
Earnings looked good why down $30?
"Mind blown... CVNA fails to deliver on anything - including a money making business model, and stock jumps huge. FTNT has a solid beat, and drops. This market makes less sense by the day."
Now this #$%$ market cap is 30% bigger than Palo alto !!!! and only 20% less than crowd strike !!!! This will screw the baggies hard & dry while they are drunk with the 10% annual rev growth !!!!
$1000 per share might be possible within next 24 months
In a channel from 130 to 133
Wall street has no love for this company no matter if they beat top and bottom on every earning.earnings is around the corner hope I'm proved wrong.
prepared to buy tomorrow.... seems a deal here
"Fortinet Inc. (FTNT) on Thursday reported second-quarter earnings of $112.1 million. The Sunnyvale, California-based company said it had profit of 68 cents per share. Earnings, adjusted for one-time gains and costs, were 82 cents per share."
Cisco SE here. These guys make the best firewalls in the industry IMO.
I am doubting if any pullback is due in fortinet
Check out dht ... they have a yield of approx 25%. And they are undervalued...stock worth 5.65 ... yet on the balance sheet worth 9 to 10.
FTNT is named fastest growing SD-WAN vendor. The ER is going to be excellent
"Safe-T stock is the best bargain cloud cyber in the all market, thank me later"
"Fartinet  takes months and months to rise $10, and goes down $10 in one morning, it’s done this 10x in the past 6 months, insiders use this stock as their own personal ATM machine"
"SWI is great ... Your guys will follow just like FSLY , AYX , SNOW .On the long run probably you well end up like FEYE ."
52 Week High Next week. Have a Great weekend ...
Congrats on what. This company is Flawless and this is the after hours reward we get
Load up. If Microsoft buys Tic Tok then guess who benefits....Fortinet! Gotta protect allll that new cloud data. Good luck investors
FTNT is rallying in to their earnings next week. Great company with a great story!!!
"OMG, I've never seen something like this stock..."
I heard $FTNT is merging with $NTNX in near future.
"Supercharger , long time holder."
Company continues to build strong industry wide partnerships and continues to innovate within their product line. They have the fastest SSL deep packet inspection dollar for dollar. I don't see a slow down anytime soon. All other players seem to be doing the same old things and over priced per performance. Not saying $FTNT is the best but investment wise they haven't flat lined in growth.
"In the wake of yesterday's earnings release, 9 different firms raised the price target on FTNT: Oppenheimer from 88 to 97; RBC Capital from 76 to 85; Barclay's from 90 to 92; BMO from 78 to 90; Credit Suisse from 60 to 70; Dougherty from 85 to 96; Morgan-Stanley from80 to 84; Monness Crespi from 91 to 95; and Northland Capital from 89 to 100. That's an average increase of more than $8 a share. Which is why I bought into today's selloff, assuming it was due to some misguided entity trying to support their short position."
$277 LOL  momentum buster R.I.P.
nice job longs!
5 star analyst DAN IVES rated buy to $180
What is the reason for the recent pop-up ?
A very solid stock. Hope the best for today's earning report.
Crowdsource reported today and didn't meet expectations
BIG seller sticking very close to the '10 day'. Look at our beautiful 6 mth trend. Will be ticking up from here. If I only had more cash...
"This is hands down the best cybersecurity investment because - $5 PER SHARE DATA443 (ATDSD) IS FAST-GROWING TINY MICROCAP THAT HAS WHAT EVERY CYBERSECURITY COMPANY WANTS AND NEEDS – DATA443 USERS CANNOT BE HELD RANSOM – EXPECT BUYOUT BY THE BIG BOYS!• DATA443 is a very small microcap company with shares selling close to $5.00 and a small number of outstanding shares estimated at about 750,000 supporting a market cap under $5 million in a currently $165 Billion Cybersecurity market• DATA443 is the ONE AND ONLY cybersecurity solution that prevents cybercrime victims from being locked out of their computer and also prevents data from being stolen• DATA443 automatically encrypts data so hackers are not able to use the stolen data rendering their efforts worthless• When hacked, DATA443 users only have to reboot their computer and all data is automatically restored and computers function normally• The unmet need for DATA443 solutions is enormous because the high rate of successful cyberattacks for ransom indicates current solutions do not work well enough• DATA443 early sales are running at close to $4 million annually and appear positioned for what could be several magnitudes of growth• DATA443 just announced a new recurring 6 figure contract with Fortune 500 company• DATA443 plans to up list to NASDAQ as soon as shares qualify which is expected in about 45 days• DATA443 has firm commitment from MAXIM GROUP for $13.8 million that funds about $10 million net as soon as shares are trading on NASDAQ"
Can someone explain why Crowdstrike and PANW went way up today but FTNT dropped??
BEAT AND GUIDANCE UP-UPGRADES COMING-SEE 86 excuse caps
"They always give a good quarter. What I do not get , they are ranked #1 but never revisited it's 52 week high"
Some robot must hit a wrong symbol for sell.
"$SQ and $FTNT 2 BULLS ,Heading to 52 week highs"
i love this company..they just aren't that exciting to talk about.
"I work in the same sector but not for this company unfortunately and I know these guys are a beast. Their business model is flawless! Analyse the stock for Debt/Equity, Current Ratio etc and everything is what Warren Buffett would have liked. I must admit that I was too scared yesterday and missed to buy a dip at 85. I honestly don't think it will dip more than 80 by looking at company strength and all financials. Hopefully there will be at least one more opportunity to buy in 80s and then rack up 30-40% when market is back."
"100% going lower after earnings BUT just a matter of how low.......NO stock goes from $150+ to $118 during the quarter, and $133 to $118 in the week before earnings, IF business were good. Sorry to be the one to tell you all the obvious."
Where is the best place to get real time conversations about stocks?
a great stock to own.
"We just got listed in I.B.D top 10 we replaced PANW. Now be quiet please,, no talking on this board"
"We keep winning awards in the industry but we are not moving. $PANW earnings today should boost us, I hope."
got in at $123 today finally waited like 2 months but PT is $124 great company!
This will be 140 here quickly....
"I shorted this at 111 and 151 and don't intend to cover......said ""THE LEGEND"", rofl"
No one is buying blocks of 100 !?
"same happened to FFIV, great earnings but it tanked after hours and before market best day, sorry guys"
looks like ftnt is heading to the moon. truly amazing stock.
just bought in at 76.24 small position ( 75 shares ) maybe not the bottom but I believe very close taking a small risk up 51% for year in my portfolio so why not. good luck everyone
Great a interview with Phil on CNBC
Rotation out of tech. I've seen this before. Not worried. Going to buy the dips. Won't be here for too long :)

"Why is it falling down, despite all the good numbers ! I fail to understand the logic- would be great to get some insights"
"This stock is a legend in the making, lol."
FTNT delivers an ROI of 37 %. Great company that is acting extremely bullish today!!!
No one talks on this board but this company has strong potential ...
What beats earning across the board and drops 6%?The market is a joke.
Fortinet has good news with Lynksis. Why is the stock down huge?
"Okay, this is strange. What's going on?"
don't understand the complaining about the shorts. there is barely any short activity in this company
Confirmed Uptrend about time.
This is great. Strong price up at close on higher volume several days. Maybe a take out in the works. I will sell my shares at $300. Come buy us IBM.
I really would of expected at least 80-85 but this is manipulation
Still @ $280 I saw  in after hours?
I am very pleased with the price performance of FTNT this year. Same as in prior years.
"Stock Market will always reward companies that grow and have good fundamentals. The shorts will get squeezed, but never admit it and tell you how good they are. The market is the reason the stock is down not the stock. If you get out you will probably regret it later on."
when is the summit?
I love when I pick a winner and the haters come out in full force. The Force is strong here.
"Been waiting for weeks to buy FTNT at below 110. Finally the moment has arrived. Take advantage of this quick pull back, it's gonna make it beyond 120 soon!"
"Took profits in September, with some concern that I may lose out on holding a good stock. Now, it's fallen on what appears to be good news. As Al Pacino said in Godfather part 3, ""Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!"""
extremely overvalued ... 140 / 150 before year end .
Just doubled down
gd gracious .. I really regret not holding this stock. This is probably one of the best performing tech stock. Strong armour during red days as well.
"Between Ken & Michael Xie, they own approximately 17-18% of the shares outstanding. Buying back shares increases their net worth. Very simple explanation, given Ken is the CEO & Michael is the CTO. Nothing like keeping it in the family! FTNT, from time to time, has made acquisitions which are complementary to their core businesses."
FTNT down $20 wow  terrible momentum busting earnings anyone feeling pain?
"not pullback, but consolidation seems on card!!"
"They expect fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings of $0.95 to $0.97 per share on revenue of $710.0 million to $730.0 million. The current consensus earnings estimate is $0.87 per share on revenue of $703.71 million for the quarter ending December 31, 2020."
"Just hang in there, the lower it drops, the higher it will bounce!"
"Just glad it didn't fall further, ALWAYS drops after earnings. Anxious to see next week, I think we have built the momentum and it will be back to going up."
This company has been doing the right things for 10 years. Q1 consensus EPS is .55. They'll blow right thru that number.
Still don’t get how this thing fell $20 on no volume at all
News like this should drive Cyber security stocks & FTNT is the safest & best choice!!!https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/15/hackers-appear-to-target-twitter-accounts-of-elon-musk-bill-gates-others-in-digital-currency-scam.html

Goldman Sachs raises Price Target from 129.00 to 140.00
"How can this stock possibly be a buy at these levels ? I get the need based on increased ransom risk, but trading at 84 times earings it needs to come down a whole bunch to be a good buy."
$110-120 buy out candidate. Security space will be in focus in coming months
I’ll buy in at $200!
goes up 5 percent every week I'm up over 100 percent look at the 6 month chart!
450 rev & q4 guidance 500 rev. sounds great.
Wow just fell $15 in seconds wow on good news 
"Earnings tomorrow, a likely beat, but with this stock it's anyone's guess where it goes."
OK BIG MOUTH'S WE GOT A 52 WEEK HIGH. NEXT JUMP WE BECOME A TRIPLE DIGIT COMPANY
Ayyye just took a big ol half a dip but we still strong boys. Stocks doesn’t move like others between averages. IMO no debt and free cash flow is better than over 90% of tech companies rn.
Fortinet is up 4.98% to 285.79
Not sure I quite understand todays selling. The stock has been going up all year so it can't be for the tax write off. Why would sell now and have to report your gains in April when you can wait 2 weeks and not have to report for 16 months. I must be missing something.
"They crushed it,. China does not affect them. They had 2 big buy backs of their shares.... Long term guidance is heading to orbit"

How does this company products compare to HP Enterprise ?
2 billion in cash
What are we missing? Such great earnings and great guidance
"Check their history online, the share price always goes up 14-20% after exceed earning expectations. Today will not be different as they are going to beat expectations."
