New format not good. Anyone know how to find out last date split to determine at what price it split and historical price. Old format: could get high and low each month. You could find all-time HI. maybe it is now Itink several yars ago - stock hit a low of under 20.Is it time to sell>

"Why does this company warrant a PE of 40? Doesn't look like there are any onetime charges. Good market position, but they've hiked prices significantly the last couple years. Still a competitive market. There is only so much price to take in this end market. I'm looking for operating margin expansion to slow. I still expect earnings to grow, but closer to just above GDP."
