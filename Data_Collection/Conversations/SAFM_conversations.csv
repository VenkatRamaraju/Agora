Great earnings !! Why isn’t this going up ?
Chicken to become much cheaper in June for US consumers - Thanks China.
"New to the company. Gross profits have really shrunk over the last few years. What is causing the trend in higher cost of revenue for this company (The last two quarters go without explanation)? looking at PPC and TSN, it does not appear to be an industry issue. Insights?"

I'm still looking for a couple of China contracts before next qtr in about a month JOE should have a conference to bring us all up to date about how business is going. Prices going higher then last yr and feed coming down even more=== all good 220 my new PT was 240
"When's the buyout, sale?? No news here."
This stock is so overvalued comparing to peers. For market sell-off sheltering? Make no sense.

"Thank you Mr. Sanderson for loading the market up with excess boneless. At .65, buying all this extra white meat is making for a great corporate and personal windfall. Chistmas has truly come early. Please keep up the continued growth; I'm especially looking forward to your double shifting the Texas plant. Again, keep up the great work, your shareholders have got to be proud of your accomplishments."
"usually ask is 199,999 a share in the a.m. REV where good even after Hurricane outlook coming. CC first then I might buy more"
"Should go up anytime, good entry pointBought at 148.75 , good luck"
Soybeans and Corn RECORD CROP=== great prices and sell those wings raise the prices wing stop SAFM supplies them right.
Anybody on this board?? What the heck happened?? Up premarket and then they short on the good news?
240 by AUG I could be wrong I was once but later found out I was just mistaken.
will this ticker change?
why is it stuck at $195 when the offer per share is $203??
I’ll say it again: This will hit $155 before earnings. Guaranteed.
Look at short interest on AAOI UNREAL and it wasn't that bad of a qtr PLUS outlook CEO thinks its getting good. I say at under 30 worth the risk reward O YES

"LPX,SAFM,LGIH,MU, and IBM ===== buy buy buy"
Relatively quick Chinese approval comes through.
They had some interesting insights about SAFM on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"Strong support at $96, getting smacked because of Tyson warning...may be a good entry point this week -- have to wait and see."
"The selling is overblown, I carefully researched every stock I've purchased. This stock will recover quickly."
Oversupply is the concern. Who wants to buy it at this danger price? The chicken growth cycle is 3 months. It will take the company at least 6 months to rebalance its supply. Company is often overestimating. Wait for $100 or below to enter.
"Demand problem? Or it may say ""over supply"". Production reduction and expense cut may come. That will take time."
This is the week!The short percentage is so high i couldnt help but get a call spread or 2 and a few cheap 185 calls. if these guys beat top and bottom and good guidance this sees 190+
Chicken and pork are the 2 most stocked meats in our local grocery stores. Everyone has to eat and its only a matter of time for the rebound.
This will hit 140 ish in 2 weeks. Promise.
reach $200 soon?
"Just since the end of may, corn futures have dropped 15% from $412 to $350. With feed costs being 40% of cost of goods sold, this will help the bottom line."
$222. my sell limit is getting closer! Today the day?
"Under 117 is a great buy said JOE, I almost picked some up 129 I'd of sold BUT that's just the way I am and who I am. Then after I sale it always goes HIGHER. WELL not CLF I got LUCKY time to buy back."
My PT on SAFM is 260 a share YES I said it WHY many reason big one NO DEBT and short interest.
"One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is Sanderson Farms, Inc. SAFM, which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks, and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) further confirms weakness in SAFM.A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen two estimates moving down in the past 30 days, compared with one upward revision. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from earnings of 76 cents a share a month ago to its current loss of 30 cents.Also, for the current quarter, Sanderson Farms has seen one downward estimate revision versus no revision in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to a loss of $2.41 per share from a loss of $1.50 per share over the past 30 days."
177 after hour. Any news?
