"Maybe if you guys didn't have 6 corporate planes and possibly worked on reducing your SG&A, you could start providing shareholder value. It seems like over kill that a $3 Billion company needs 6 planes. I guess the real question is, do you want to be an airline or a chicken company?"

"This stock got bunch of downgrades after earning release. It will be likely enough to keep it depressed till next release. On the other hand, balance sheet is strong and producing meat is not the worst business in present environment. I think it is appropriate time to start position here."

FNSR today after close next week conference I wonder if someone will ask about TSN losing 6.5 mill. lbs of chicken will that make price go up 5 cents a lb????? 6.5 mill lbs will feed a small country for a week or more.
"I sure would feel better JOE if you picked up 50,000 share. Let me know again that everything is OK actions speak louder then words. I think hedge funds are shorting more to bring the price down to cover there loses. I THINK a lot, anyway I'd pick up 1,000 if you did. I PROMISE"

Don't mess with the US fed govt...They are the only ones that can collude to regulate.....
Oversupply is the concern. Who wants to buy it at this danger price? The chicken growth cycle is 3 months. It will take the company at least 6 months to rebalance its supply. Company is often overestimating. Wait for $100 or below to enter.
The culling of chickens in China will have SAFM at new ATH next qtr.

GB SAFM is a great company WHY not grow your own feed or just have of it CORN is easy to grow plant water and let GD grow it. Then you buy machine that picks it and a machine to break it down into feed . COST I think its less then what you made this qtr include in cost the land.

"SAFM starting pay is 11.25 or was it 11.75 They said it on CC. So WHY do the shorts keep trying everything its NOT going to work because the FACTS are the FACTS SAFM has NO DEBT, cash machine, and that de#$%$ plant gets up and running the second one. I heard extra 20 cents per pound and how many pounds of Chicken does SAFM sale in a QTR? How about a year???? Great balance sheet and only getting better use money increase div and buy back 20% NO make it 42% of outstanding shares equal to the short interest. Then what would the short interest be IF SAFM bock 42% of outstanding shares=== NAKED SHORTING which equals 15,000 a share. LOL Did you see DRYS short squeeze from 15 to 140 in a week before that went from 3 to 15, I missed some of it. O WELL and TSN is higher today, PPC I think is next to report maybe IBA I like IBA over PPC but O LORD PPC has paid a special div of like 5 bucks each year for the last two yrs, CRAZY but they know Chickens are a cash machine.

"Stock price jump: only explanation I can come up with is that China will start buying US chickens to reduce deficit if trade deal goes through. Meanwhile, how many US companies are suffering from tariffs on steel, but no tariffs on products not imported from China but made of cheaper steel abroad? It makes no sense."
"120 and SHORTS will be forced to cover and then, its on like a chicken bone. Think I'm going to buy more after SWKS hits a new 52-week high 120 it was just profit taking after a great qtr. I don't like big cars or big women BUT somehow I always find myself in them. She put on 20lbs and said I hit on her. I said imagine if you had put on 40lbs what would of happened. What is the diff between a wife and a girlfriend? About 20 lbs"

"I don't understand WHY Warren Buffet isn't a major holder??? I bet a buck if SAFM paid a sweet div he would own over 10% maybe 25% of the company. CALM only pays div IF they turn a profit and one-third of the profit is the div. I did get on CALM a few yrs back, did my homework, O YES."
"Chicken prices are higher then ever jumped 8.37% in march, I can't find April but if it raised that much or more, SAFM is going higher. I understand now why eps est. went from 2.25 to 2.65 . Maybe JOE will make that deal pay off big time and turn 3 plus in eps???? I wonder if JOE since he is a major holder would be OK with doing div like CALM one third of the profits. CALM doesn't pay a div until they make a profit so it all evens out. PPC went BK but its back and think we have learned don't over supply the market with chickens or YOU can't turn a profit and stay in business."

The doctor thought about it for a little while and said well I knew this guy who was a avid hunter. One day he was in a bit of a hurry and grab his umbrella instead of his gun. He was in the woods and all of a sudden a big BEAR was in front of him. The hunter pointed his umbrella at the bear and pulled the handle the bear dropped dead.

SAFM my PT because of low float not courting short interest 240 a share YES I said it double from here in a year 100% return not bad. I'm crazy well welcome to WS"
EPS is 9.74 so PE should be what 11??? 12 will be OK and forward pe with chicken prices going higher and feed under control PLUS more demand=== forward PE of 3. I THINK it might be 7
I’ll say it again: This will hit $155 before earnings. Guaranteed.
So we know its NOT about this qtr but outlook and feed is low and chicken prices are the HIGHEST they have ever been. TRUE or FALSE only the facts please RIG in a year will double easy. I THINK I could be wrong I was once in my life What does a LSU cheerleader say after sex? Dad get off me your hurting my back. O low blow ROLL TIDE
COLD kills chicken NOT going to hatch=== supply demand=== HIGHER PRICES ===JOE????

Prices have continued to move HIGHER during MAY OK means more money more money more money.
"Thank you Mr. Sanderson for loading the market up with excess boneless. At .65, buying all this extra white meat is making for a great corporate and personal windfall. Chistmas has truly come early. Please keep up the continued growth; I'm especially looking forward to your double shifting the Texas plant. Again, keep up the great work, your shareholders have got to be proud of your accomplishments."

"TSN chickens have a virus and SAFM are safe this weather chicks are COLD. Cruelty to animals call the EPA , FBI,CIS and the USA."
The bulls and the bears are locked in a stalemate it seems now that SAFM has seen P/E moved into neutral territory with a 10.61. Not sure how a.awesomestocks finds all these incredible trade ideas but im happy.

SAFM is up 4.98% to 111.77
why is it stuck at $195 when the offer per share is $203??
Chicken and pork are the 2 most stocked meats in our local grocery stores. Everyone has to eat and its only a matter of time for the rebound.
Sanderson Farms is up 4.91% to 127.59
UP 9 days and down one OK with me.
"FEED is down or about what it will be until a drought and maybe JOE will have prices for feed locked it??? Chickens are at a all time HIGH because young adults don't eat red meat BUT they do eat chicken on everything, even pizza. I wish they hadn't raised eps est 44 cents a month before they report. I guess they know and GS should upgrade I think having a sell on a all time high list is STUPID. I mean look at the basics its higher chicken prices and lower feed cost also growing by building new plants. SAFM has nothing to do with dot com. I know if a hedge fund bought out SAFM at 200 bucks it would pay for itself in 5 yrs."
I have more confidence in SAFM to run their processing facilities safely on a COVID upswing than Tyson.
Sanderson Farms is down 8.46% to 110.28

Damn market blow out quarter going to the hell $SAFM. #$%$ results going moon $PDCO.
"New to the company. Gross profits have really shrunk over the last few years. What is causing the trend in higher cost of revenue for this company (The last two quarters go without explanation)? looking at PPC and TSN, it does not appear to be an industry issue. Insights?"
"Just since the end of may, corn futures have dropped 15% from $412 to $350. With feed costs being 40% of cost of goods sold, this will help the bottom line."
VOL Monday was unreal and I keep seeing SAFM on CNBC ticker COOL.
OK might sell a little NVDA before close and buy more SAFM. GS raised PT on NVDA to 165 I have a 160 PT. GS really should upgrade SAFM before they report or that guy needs to start looking for a new job. I don't want to be mean BUT GS lok at all the FACTS and you have a sell rating on SAFM??? I thought you guys where smarter then that maybe I'm wrong maybe
Sanderson Farms is up 5.85% to 129.88

"One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is Sanderson Farms, Inc. SAFM, which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks, and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) further confirms weakness in SAFM.A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen two estimates moving down in the past 30 days, compared with one upward revision. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from earnings of 76 cents a share a month ago to its current loss of 30 cents.Also, for the current quarter, Sanderson Farms has seen one downward estimate revision versus no revision in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to a loss of $2.41 per share from a loss of $1.50 per share over the past 30 days."

Would inflation be good for chicken prices??? TRUMP bad joke
"JOE back buy 10% of the float or have management buy 10,000 shares watch the shorts run. Because if it doesn't kill me it better be able to run fast. When life knocks you down get back up slowly, smile and say you hit like a BI-T_h."
Demand in retail is excellent
Short interest went UP crazy people SAFM is a cash machine. I think TSN might may a bid or SAFM could go private. I mean the prices of chicks keep going HIGHER and feed is down. TIMING is everything SAFM grows from inside with-out AUQ. WHY because they know what they are doing great management O YES. Plant in TX should be up and running soon and then its time to start building another in TENN.
110 or 120==== short squeeze is on MY PT is still 180 fair value and with a squeeze???
"I Truly believe a NEW 52-week high is coming and coming soon very soon. JJ answer that phone I know its your broker again calling about that short interest you have on SAFM. Drunk guy gets on a bus and sits down next to JJ. JJ tells him your going to HELL guy jumps up out of his sit and says I'm on the wrong bus. he got off the bus but JJ stayed guess she is truly going to HELL and doing nothing to stop it, what a shame well enjoy your life before you die have some fun fun fun living next to a beach is better then living next to a lake. Less COUGARS I like COUGARS tried taming a few BUT I can't change who they are. They might change me before I change them."

"HMNY is the best SHORT on the market SHORTS should be all over that one, I would if I had some extra MONEY. Shorts are going to PAY UP for SAFM short, I could be wrong NOT"
