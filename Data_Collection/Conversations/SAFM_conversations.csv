SAFM is up 5.39% to 132.86
SAFM reached a 52 Week high at 131.73
"One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is Sanderson Farms, Inc. SAFM, which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks, and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) further confirms weakness in SAFM.A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen two estimates moving down in the past 30 days, compared with one upward revision. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from earnings of 76 cents a share a month ago to its current loss of 30 cents.Also, for the current quarter, Sanderson Farms has seen one downward estimate revision versus no revision in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to a loss of $2.41 per share from a loss of $1.50 per share over the past 30 days."
listen to last CC people and 34% short interest pay up NOW !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! TY be nice Craig-O
"Stock price jump: only explanation I can come up with is that China will start buying US chickens to reduce deficit if trade deal goes through. Meanwhile, how many US companies are suffering from tariffs on steel, but no tariffs on products not imported from China but made of cheaper steel abroad? It makes no sense."
Soybeans and Corn RECORD CROP=== great prices and sell those wings raise the prices wing stop SAFM supplies them right.

From CC did you hear that AUG was better then JULY I did also GO WNGS. I use to be a RED WING'S fan hockey. SAFM is a CASH CHICKEN I would say COW but that is TSN all about the sector and PPC which I did have a few yrs ago sweet div.

Use the money and do a stock buy back even at a 52-week high great for stock holders lets WS know company think PPS is still cheap.

Oversupply is the concern. Who wants to buy it at this danger price? The chicken growth cycle is 3 months. It will take the company at least 6 months to rebalance its supply. Company is often overestimating. Wait for $100 or below to enter.
"These stocks are better long term. KNDI, MU, SGH, APRI are the best stocks right now"
"52-week low BUT the balance sheet has just gotten better all year long add 1.84 pre share with NO DEBT. OK JOE you know chickens. I know a little about stocks be stock holder friendly and do a 20 Million buy back. Forget the special div that sucks reg div OK. I like CALM pays a third of earning if they turn a profit keeps balance sheet strong. CALM egg lands best get together with them don't think you could work out a deal???? Give the a stock deal fro the company control the hatchery and raise the best birds. O JOE show me you care about share holders YOU said it on conference before earning conference so YOU are straight up ==== NO dancing around the table like most CEO, NOT ALL. GO MU and take AMAT with ya SAFM football season and do that buy back 40 million OR use all the earning you made this year for buy back."
"When's the buyout, sale?? No news here."
Don't sell your shares cheap in 6 months BIG Chicken shortage because eggs didn't hatch==== THE FREZZE got them JOE said everyday asking about eggs.

"Looks like the start of a cup and handle. This 90 yr old man went to get his annual check-up. The doctor asked how he was feeling OLD man said I have never felt better. Then went on and told the doctor his 18 yr old bride was having his baby. What do you think about that doctor? The doctor thought about it for a little while and said well I knew this guy who was a avid hunter. One day he was in a bit of a hurry and grab his umbrella instead of his gun. He was in the woods and all of a sudden a big BEAR was in front of him. The hunter pointed his umbrella at the bear and pulled the handle the bear dropped dead. The doctor asked the 90 yr old man what do you think about that. The old man said well someone else must of shot the bear, The doctor said well that is kind of what I'm getting at."

"Has anyone ever looked at the Track Record of this company with the Department of Labor? This will have a lot of affect on the fact whether I would invest in this company. If they are using investor monies to pay fines and penalties for their stupidity and willful violations of Wage and Hour, OSHA and other agencies that protect their employees. Check them out on dol.gov....... Then decide if this is a wise investment."
