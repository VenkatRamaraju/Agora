"Looks great today. Market tanks, MSI is up"
Long Term!
this should be a $50b company. I dont know why it is still at 20 inspite on NA monopoly
Motorola Solutions shares are trading lower in sympathy with Nokia after the company cut its FY19 EPS and FY20 operating margin guidance.
I think it's really interesting to see Motorola being able to acquire all these companies so easily. Would have expected significant antitrust scrutiny!
I like monopolies.
Time to split the stock
I'm glad I held onto this stock since 2011. I have it in a DRIP and I never thought much about it. I have 978 shares and now it's worth more than I ever expected it to be. It's s probably time to sell about $30G or so and get a few things for my house with the cash. I still can't believe it's valued as high as it is but I'm happy about it.

"Really, should be more like $136.00. What is the point of record performance if speculators keep depressing the price artificially?"
It's time to split this stock so it's more attractive to potential investors.
"After 21 years, finally in the green on this one. Better late then never."
"Dropping gradually over the last 10ish days, then almost 5% today. Why the bloodbath amid an otherwise positive market, good quarterly report and no obvious bad news?"
"Feb 6, 2020;Backlog - The company ended the quarter with record backlog of $11.3 billion, up $659 million from the year-ago quarter. Software and Services segment backlog was up 9% or $699 million, primarily driven by growth in the Americas and the extension of the ESN contract. Products and System Integrations segment backlog was down 1% or $40 million due to declines in EMEA and AsiaPac, partially offset by growth in the Americas."
"Software and services up, top and bottom line. Plus, you get the option on product recovery."
Good time for Motorola to move its Corporate headquarters back to its suburban Schaumburg Campus from downtown Chicago. Looks as if the trend will be back to the suburbs.
I own a Motorola cell phone and its excellent! New product releases/previews now online. Motorola has cheaper prices for great products.
What do Razor phones have to do with Motorola Solutions? They are Motorola Mobility products. Two different companies.
"Customer segments are government, public safety and first-responder agencies, municipalities, and commercial and industrial customers. Which of those segments will have money to spend on new equipment next year?"
MSI is the leader in communication and security systems. Huge backlogs with government and municipal contracts. 5G will be huge for MSI as well.
We will see price direction trend once earning comes out tomorrow. Stay solid to put this baby to another 5-10 points.
"Morningstar calls this a ""narrow-moat company"". lol"
"I had initially written off this company as old outdated technology but looking at the stock's behavior over the last 3 years it appears I need to rethink my stance. Looking closer at them they appear to have a competitive advantage. I may invest in MSI soon. Clearly they appear to be doing all the right things..expanding margins, growing cash reserves and free cash flow, etc. I like what I'm seeing."
"$dgly In addition, the company now has a royalty agreement which produces earnings with a very fast growing company in Watchguard that can now market that they are the only ones with the patented technology and using $AAXN or $MSI is a risk for any organization purchasing"
"Time for Greg brown to reduce his 30 million a year package, stock options etc."
"Silver Lake deal. Can someone better explain the “shell game” details of the investment. How do you pay off a $800 million dollar note with $1.1 billion cash and 5.5 million in stock? I’ll take that deal, as stated in the article, every day of the week!"
Ive been watching MSI since they bought avigilon. At this price its a no brainer. I’m in today
"I stand corrected - per macrotrendsThe all-time high Motorola Solutions stock closing price was 243.37 on March 06, 2000.We are 6.5% from that high water markPedal Browneye pedal - you can do it"
According to my charts the Mot all time high is 227. Can Browneye pedal his pelaton fast enough to get there this year
"I don't own either stock (MSI or AAPL), but curious as to someone who does own Motorola to explain to me how Apple, a company dependent on China for 20% of its revenues and nearly all of its supply chain is breaking new all time highs almost daily and Motorola, a company that has avoided China like the plague and makes what seems like a good product for half the price in America is not anywhere near its all time highs? This in the backdrop of Wall Street telling us that we are on the verge of a recession due to a trade war. Is there a disconnect or some deep logical reasoning that I fail to see? Thank you."
$MSI Maintains Raymond James Financial Outperform USD 175 » USD 200 Target Raised by Barclays Overweight USD 196 » USD 206
Adjustment's coming for review. Morning Star Analyst to give comment soon. Any thoughts?
"Analyst Actions: Credit Suisse Adjusts Motorola Solutions' Price Target to $198 from $202, Keeps Outperform Rating! Motorola is growing rapidly into EU markets and not even in China yet.."
i really regret selling 1300 shares 7 years ago
HOLD and add to MSI on dips. Company has already provided guidance in line for 2020 and 80+% of contracts are with the government. 50% backlog is revolving. Very profitable.
"MSI should announce great qtr.or I should say will, probably trade into the high $150's, maybe a split on the way or a Activist investor as the share price is so cheap, a solid company"

Awesome! I have been holding this stock in a DRIP for well over a decade and never dreamed it would do to his well. It's time for me to cash in some shares and get a new computer.
