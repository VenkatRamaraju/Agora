Motorola is a dead company. They're living in the past with not much of a high tech future. I've owned the stock for over a decade and it just barely makes any gains which I suppose is better than nothing. I'll keep holding it for the dividends and keep it as an emergency bank account. I have close to 1000 shares so it's worth a fair amount. I don't expect much to change so I don't even think about it until I get my quarterly DRIP dividend statement. I don't think the market cap is even higher than Gamestock now. What a shame to have such a non-aggressive company.

Anyone know why the stock is dropping significantly today. I can't see to find any news so far

Somebody tell me why the stock tanks after a sterling earning report and upside optimism for Q2? It can't just be profit taking can it? MSI does well and the stock tanks....They do poorly and the stock tanks...they release mediocre earnings and the stock tanks... Frustrating for people like me that have it in my portfolio and I want it to hold it's value.

I'm glad I held onto this stock since 2011. I have it in a DRIP and I never thought much about it. I have 978 shares and now it's worth more than I ever expected it to be. It's s probably time to sell about $30G or so and get a few things for my house with the cash. I still can't believe it's valued as high as it is but I'm happy about it.

Motorola gives deep discounts to their handsets. The quality and strength to handle the rigors of the job are clearly way above the competition. I have worked with competitors handsets and they cant handle the tasks required. Talk to your local public safety people and that's when the real story comes clean. The guy that reported the short is a hack.

"I don't own either stock (MSI or AAPL), but curious as to someone who does own Motorola to explain to me how Apple, a company dependent on China for 20% of its revenues and nearly all of its supply chain is breaking new all time highs almost daily and Motorola, a company that has avoided China like the plague and makes what seems like a good product for half the price in America is not anywhere near its all time highs? This in the backdrop of Wall Street telling us that we are on the verge of a recession due to a trade war. Is there a disconnect or some deep logical reasoning that I fail to see? Thank you."

good company solid earnings buying more
"Big firm news today, MSI reported its detailed performance in the past year. A company may report high earnings but actually have low cash flows. This difference is called ""accruals"", which represents a firm’s estimation of future financial benefits and obligations. see: http://www.financial-education-hub.com/1/MSI. However, managers may make mistakes intentionally or unintentionally in the estimation, making the realization of accruals inconsistent with cash flows. So, supposed firms A and B have the same reported earnings. A is expected to have lower future earnings if it has high current accruals than B. If you want to estimate the quality of $MSI ’s earnings to be released, you can calculate its accruals level, and the portion that may not be able to be realized in cash flows. For the method, please see: http://www.financial-education-hub.com/2/MSI."

What is this below market offer? why would anyone sell at below the open market price?

Looks like Left is putting more big money into the MSI short. I do not believe that he can get this one down to $45 but I see him getting it below $79 how far below is going to depend on how low the MSI big money investors are will to risk it before they load up. I am sure if they thouught it could go to $45 and recover they will let it then load up since they are in for the long term they will find the price they are going to let left run it down till it hits the price they like then they will come in and start the squeeze while they rake in about a billion dollars.

"In a weakly policed but huge patchwork of as many as 20,000 city, county, state and federal two-way radio networks, governments have paid as much as $7,500 apiece for Motorola models when some competitors offered products meeting the same specifications for a fraction of its prices.In Europe, which has a lower-power network that requires more costly towers and infrastructure, police radios serving the same functions sell for $500 to $700.“While our public safety people do an extraordinary job in protecting the public, I am not impressed with the choices they’ve made relative to technology,” said Rep. Anna Eshoo, D-Calif., who represents part of Silicon Valley and has for years monitored Motorola’s dominance.In a phone interview, she called radio prices of $5,000 and above “ludicrous.”Read more here: http://www.kansas.com/news/article1138732.html#storylink=cpy"

Solid earnings growth for last 10 quarters and funny thing is Brown (CEO) pulled out of China due to IP theft. Therefore China is a low revenue % at MSI and stock is getting hit for no reason. I am a buyer on these dips. GLTA

Andrew Left the individual that issued the negative report on MSI yesterday must be scratching his head today. MSI was the latest company to attack in order to benefit. The way it works he writes a negative report and before publication he sells short the stock. He did this in Hong Kong in 2012. He wrote a report on a Chinese company. Before he published the report he sold short 4.1 million shares of the company stock and then published the report on his website. The court in Hong Kong found him guilty and had to return the profits to the Chinese company plus costs. In February he published a negative report on MSI and projected the stock should be $45. Instead the stock went the other way to $93 dollars. The new MSI report did not cause any panic. MSI stock was up with light volume a good sign that not many investors took his report seriously. Therefore Mr. Left lost on both reports and he must be scratching his head as to what went wrong.
MSI on watch for MSI buy out little mobile company SYATF -have deals in place with Verizon & AT&T believe that Motorola will end up buying out Siyata so that Motorola can retain their stranglehold on the First Responder clients.Certainly the First Responder clients would be MUCH more likely to buy this new technology from a trusted supplier like Motorola than an upstart like Siyata.I have been Loading up on the dip.
