"Based on 22-09-21 announcements, looks like there will be some 4th quarter revenue. Might be small amount."
i was expecting this to go higher than the current 4.15% increase so far!
PFE licensing deal this morning with Voyager shows that there is huge value here in ARCT for big pharma.
WHO is the global entity! Thats great news!
There was also an announcement made yesterday about payne meeting with the prime minister of vietnam on expansion of the collaboration. I also see that indonesia biofarma and health minister had talks with payne in US in august and september about collaborations for covid vaccine... the global entity?
"A good lesson today, down $3.84. As WonderfulBlevic urged earlier this month, choose your buy point carefully, keeping in mind what this company has achieved and the challenges it faces. I do think this weeks news is very positive,#1- there is news, unlike the secrecy forced by Singapore, ARCT will update shareholders on progress in Vietnam#2- unlike Singapore's 5 month Phase 1, we have a 40 day Phase 1 in Vietnam#3- some chance of Q4 revenue in 2021I think, until Phase 3 news, ARCT will continue to 'track' Moderna, more or less. There will be considerable swings and opportunities."
"ARCT will decouple from MRNA daily % price change when ARCT announces sales of its vaccine, presumably in January 2022. Success, and ultimately revenue and earnings, looking increasingly likely.Again, nice job CEO Payne."
News out today: COVID vaccine proceeds successfully to phase 3B in Vietnam. Should be a good day for the share price!
It looks like ARCT-021 is not selected in WHO global Phase 3 trial at this time. Wondering if WHO is waiting for more data from ARCT-154 before deciding whether to include ARCT-021 or ARCT-154 in global trial. We will have to wait and see what company has to say about this development during upcoming CC.https://www.who.int/news/item/26-10-2021-who-statement-on-solidarity-trial-vaccines
"all of these recent developments only confirm for me that our FDA with too many Big Pharma execs on the approval committees are sabatoging American ingenuity and the American people for profits over progress. another company I am involved in, CYDY has had to take their multiple indication, non side effect, effective drug to Brazil and the Philippines. The FDA itself is not the problem....BIG Pharma interests and self serving agendas sabatoge American health for profits. part of the solution would be disallowing Big pharma employees, especially those with VISIBLE conflicting interests, from existing on these boards in the first place, and replacing them with scientists and doctors who still remember their hypocratitc Oath. Don't misunderstand. I'm a shareholder who wants to see the companies I invest in succeed and reward me with the benefits of that success... I just want to see our FDA operate in the manner befitting an institution that was designed to impartially review and approve or disapprove drugs based on true efficacy and benefits to the American people not squewed toward the preferences and parameters of big pharma. So far, our newest technology, such as moderna and RNA have been most effective in dealing with covid 19... traditional, old school big pharma is behind that 8ball...and boy is it showing"
"Cathie Wood bought 115,000 more shares today via ARKG."
"I don't worry too much about what Merck or other COVID Pharma is doing. There is enough to worry about with ARCT. ARCT needs to develop a product that the world needs, and, is politically acceptable (T cell immunity is not in vogue in US medicine). If ARCT is able to develop this product, they need it to generate revenue (Need to read press releases in Q1 and Q2 2022 announcing new, significant orders). Then this revenue needs to generate positive earnings (30 million shares outstanding, so, even if 3rd world prices are relatively low, think that the earnings will follow). This is a lot to accomplish over the next 9 months. I think that it will come together and remain invested in ARCT.As for the price short term, people, institutions with a lot more clout and money than 'us' will determine what ARCT is worth for the next 4 to 6 weeks (Q3 call mid-Nov, some kind of phase 2-3 news in mid-Dec). Sassine raised 300 million. ARCT retooled while Singapore (a third world country pretending to be some kind of leader in medicine) yanked their chain and is now partnered with Viet Nam that has motivation to succeed and raise their standing in the world. ARCT has others paying the bill for Phase 3(s). ARCT has Dr. Xu and Dr. Shu lipid and mRNA tech. But, all of this is only worth so much- and, ARCT is probably somewhat overvalued here at just above 1B market cap. Investors need continued PR on success results short term, but it is time for ARCT to step up and become a legit clinical medicines company, not just in name only."
The oral covid antiviral pills would soon come online. Is this a game changer for the vaccine market? Definitely another blow.
Hopefully the announcement of the new leadership position in Arct will help boost the SP https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/arcturus-therapeutics-announces-leadership-appointments-120000047.html
Corporate Deck has still not be updated for October. I am not sure if they are waiting for any news before updating it.
"This one is finally seeing some significant traction with December getting relatively close, and don't discount how important the ARK buying is.... Cathie has a ton of followers out there."
"WHO is the global entity. This is very important development for ARCT. If Arct021 is proven successful, it can be a one dose vaccine. Even though many may already have been vaccinated, but as from research reports, the neutralising antibodies dropped to very low levels just after few months of second dose for 2 dose vaccine regimen, there is still need for a good and effective vaccine. Furthermore, arct021 is of much lower dosage, possibly much lesser side effects, in lyophilised form which makes much easier handling and transportation, so it can be both primary vaccine or as booster shot. The most important thing here is that WHO sees arct021 as a potential vaccine candidate for covid19 and the vaccine may have very good efficacy, which is why they are sponsoring the phase 3."
"Currently despite the success of BionTech and Moderna in mRNA vaccines, many big pharmaceutical companies are still lacking in mRNA capabilities. If we look at Moderna now, it is using its mRNA in the development of a number of potential therapies, drugs, vaccines or treatments. That is a big positive. Big pharma are behind the curve if they don't acquire mRNA technology. For last one year plus, even MRK was unsuccessful in developing covid vaccine with the old methods. mRNA is here to stay and for discovery of new treatments.."
"A bit cautious, just due to WHO and ARCT-021 histories. BUT, will buy on any weakness. Hope there are still disgruntled, take over holders who will dump on WHO news. $5-20 (USD) Billion still in the kitty for developing world vaccine purchases. Large dollar range, just hard to analyze what has already been committed and what continues to come in. Would be nice if ARCT can hint at dollar amount during the Q3 call. Again, nice job retooling. Actually an amazing string of news since August. Thank you ARCT team."
"Currently I believe the focus is on arct154, of more concern is whether ARCT can get EUA from Vietnam in late Dec or Early 2022. Variants such as Delta etc are causing new waves, as can be seen in Singapore, despite Singapore already doing a very good job in controlling the pandemic."
