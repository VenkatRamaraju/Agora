What do u think guys? About today
"My investment thesis:1. Messenger RNA is possibly the greatest technology breakthrough of our generation. Within 5-7 years it could turn the entire pharmaceutical industry upside down and replace it. 2. There are 200 different cell types in the body. This represents a new ""land grab"" where all the mRNA companies will be trying to snag the best ""real-estate"" in the human body.... the ""beach-front property"" cells that represent the best money-making potential. The companies with the best technologies will be able to target potentially a dozen or more cell types, many on the beach front. But there will be plenty of opportunities for MRNA companies to stake their claim to virgin land. It could take 20 years before the majority of the 200 cell types are developed. So even if a new company pops up 5 years from now, there will be plenty of opportunity. 3. This is NOT A RACE. Many people think this is all about covid-19 and its a race to be first. The MRNA market is going to play out over 20 years. There is plenty of open real-estate for the current MRNA companies to grab. Covid-19 is simply accelerating the acceptance of MRNA. This is good for all mRNA companies.4. Covid-19 is NOT A RACE. There are 7.6 Billion People on this planet and everyone will need to receive a new vaccine once per year for the next several years. Moderna and Pfizer are treating the initial wave in the 1st world, but all of these people will need to be treated again next year. 5. The developing world matters. There are 1.4B in China, 1.4B in India, 500M in South and Central America, and 1.2B in Africa. Several Billion people live in a place where a two-shot cryogenic vaccine is not practical. 6. There will likely be covid-19 winners across different markets. The best vaccine for one market may be different than the best vaccine for another. For India, they want something cheap even if the efficacy is low. For Africa, they need 1-shot and freeze-dried because a two-shot cryogenic vaccine is impossible to manage. 7. Covid-19 is here to stay. People will need vaccine treatments every year for the next several years. Viral-based vaccines like J&J are only valid for a person’s 1st shot. Their 2nd, 3rd, and 4th must come from a different source. So everyone that receives a J&J shot this year, could likely become an ARCT customer next year. 8. Covid-19 is getting all the attention right now, but the macro story is that mRNA is the future of medicine and covid-19 is mostly helping to accelerate its acceptance faster than was previously possible. Don’t let the excitement of covid-19 distract you from the macro impact of mRNA across the entire disease spectrum.9. The market for Messenger RNA is several trillion dollars over the next 10 years.10. The market is large enough for many MRNA companies to win. We will see multiple $100B+ companies, and potentially a few $1T companies.11. ARCT has potentially the best tech of all the mRNA companies. (I invest in multiple mRNA companies because I think the macro-trend is so huge, but I think ARCT has the best tech). 12. Moderna and Pfizer are leading the race right now for covid-19, but ARCT is close behind and has better tech. So ARCT could catch and surpass them as people make educated decisions over the next few years about the “best” covid-19 vaccine to take annually. Nevertheless, the market is so huge that all of these companies will win. 13. ARCT is sitting on $500M cash. This is plenty of money to capture significant market share in this multi-trillion-dollar industry, capture significant beach-front property across the 200 cell types, and possibly become one of the major market winners in covid-19. I think its crazy that ARCT is only valued at $1.3B. The analysts that freaked out in December were totally wrong about antibodies and consequently wall-street has assigned efficacy risk to ARCT that is unfounded. This creates a significant investment opportunity. Probably the best investment opportunity I have seen in my entire career. I don’t know how long it will take before ARCT stock blow up, but its only a matter of time IMO."
"More great news on ARCT-154 to target the delta variant. These stood out from the press release:1) The ARCT-154 Phase 1/2/3 clinical study is a randomized, observer-blind, placebo-controlled design, and is sponsored and completely funded by Arcturus’ manufacturing partner Vinbiocare – a subsidiary of Vingroup, the largest private industry conglomerate in Vietnam. No additional cost involved. Great news. 2) If the clinical trial proves successful at interim evaluations, Emergency Use Approval (EUA) by the Vietnam Ministry of Health is anticipated in December 2021."
Wake up tomorrow to $96. This is going to be spectacular run up.
"Part of the trial include pfizer 1 shot, second shot is ARCT ... According to the lead scientists in Singapore, 1st shot is to train the immune system, the second shot from ARCT will be more protective to all the variants."
"The PR says ""ARCT-021, Arcturus’ single shot STARR mRNA COVID vaccine, to begin multinational placebo-controlled Phase 3 efficacy study funded and sponsored by a global entity"".Now, whenever I see this type of vagueness (about the ""global entity""), it tells me that there is an NDA in place and potentially even discussions around M&A.It makes sense though - TBIO got taken out for 3BB. Why wouldn't ARCT go for at least that if not more?"
This stock must climb back up to $65+ within next week since it hit this price at least twice recently.
$80-100 ACQUISITION this week
Patiently waiting on this one for a while....finally good to see this
"Note that: TBIO was offered $2.8B. ARCT capital is still at $1.5B. TBIO did not reach phase 3 trials yet.Price to book is at 4.4, which is not high compare with two other mrna companies, which is at over 20. had been 2.6 for the last half year.vietnam company paid them 40M royalties to do phase 1/2/3, which will conclude in Dec 2021. Note vietnam has a much higher population than singapore.the only drawback is no approval for a phase 3 trial in singapore, which i think is something that is needed right now."
"IMO there are two possible scenarios here. Scenario-1: the bear analysts are correct that the Low antibody data shows this therapy has low efficacy as a single dose and will have little commercial value. Senario-2: the low antibody count is a result of extremely effective t-cell performance and high longlasting efficacy. In scenario 1, the stock price drops to pre-covid levels of $10-$15. In scenario-2, ARCT has the best vaccine in the world and their STARR technology is proven as a medical breakthrough that will change the future of medicine. Place your bets...we will find out the answer in a couple months."
"Where has all the excitement gone? This popped to $49 at the market open and was even at $50 premarket. Why have people been selling? IMO this was way oversold and there's little downside risk vs bigger potential of upside. I feel the risk/reward is worth a gamble here and I loaded up at $45. I'm ready to buy more too if it hits short term support in low 40s. At some point the shorts will close out and this could go above $50, maybe even $60 IMO. Fingers crossed. GLTA"
Back to 50
News out today: COVID vaccine proceeds successfully to phase 3B in Vietnam. Should be a good day for the share price!
Don’t buy for Covid. Buy for MRNA. That’s the key
Been in since $90 a share 9 months ago before it crashed averaged down to $60 a share over time.This news was fantastic...
"Ok, here's my hunch. What Arcturus does is important for the world. And I hope their trials and their phase 1/2/3 goes well. Now, to the investment side: The shares have progressed, but there's still a huge number of shorts in the market. I can almost see the poo pooing on the shares that happens after conference call so that short-sellers can cover their position before August 20th. After which 'miraculously' there will be less shorts moving forward because the speculators can't ignore the progress and the potential valuation the company can achieve. But again, we're talking Science vs. Market manipulation. All said, I'm long. Diamond hands."
We need news on INO4802. Look at $arct today with their news
Existing Pfizer vaccine seems to be already highly efficacious against Beta variant. https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2110345
"ARCT will decouple from MRNA daily % price change when ARCT announces sales of its vaccine, presumably in January 2022. Success, and ultimately revenue and earnings, looking increasingly likely.Again, nice job CEO Payne."
"I hate to say it, but I told you so that the stock price would deteriorate and head back down!!! I predicted that you would be able to buy it for a much lower price prior to the December announcement of their Trial results!!! But, some on this board insisted that it was only going up from the company's announcement of a partnership with Vietnam and their existing relationship with Singapore. But, looking like that's not going to happen here. Hope all who bought on the news and hype learn your lesson.Wait for it... it will head lower... buy about a month prior to december's trial announcement and we may be able reap some profits..."
“Arcturus Therapeutics (ARCT) came out with a quarterly loss of $2.07 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.99. This compares to loss of $0.55 per share a year ago”.
Way up in ah
Arcturus Therapeutics is up 21.52% to 58.62
wow this #$%$ has no power
Valuation of 5B to 8B for ARCT is chump change for what is at stake for a buy out.
"Hold long and strong, we’re getting back to business!"
There are huge call option trades going on!!! Maybe some good news coming out soon!!!
Whats this silence
"i would not worry able the manipulations.arct do have progress, like going to phase 3, unlike other vaccine company that BS about magical pills.Further vietnam is paying for every doses manufactured by arct, i guess this are for doses use in the 123 trials as well. then isnt this considered a ""product"" in a sense?Dont forget also LUNAR = to the moon!"
70 tomorrow.
"I don't worry too much about what Merck or other COVID Pharma is doing. There is enough to worry about with ARCT. ARCT needs to develop a product that the world needs, and, is politically acceptable (T cell immunity is not in vogue in US medicine). If ARCT is able to develop this product, they need it to generate revenue (Need to read press releases in Q1 and Q2 2022 announcing new, significant orders). Then this revenue needs to generate positive earnings (30 million shares outstanding, so, even if 3rd world prices are relatively low, think that the earnings will follow). This is a lot to accomplish over the next 9 months. I think that it will come together and remain invested in ARCT.As for the price short term, people, institutions with a lot more clout and money than 'us' will determine what ARCT is worth for the next 4 to 6 weeks (Q3 call mid-Nov, some kind of phase 2-3 news in mid-Dec). Sassine raised 300 million. ARCT retooled while Singapore (a third world country pretending to be some kind of leader in medicine) yanked their chain and is now partnered with Viet Nam that has motivation to succeed and raise their standing in the world. ARCT has others paying the bill for Phase 3(s). ARCT has Dr. Xu and Dr. Shu lipid and mRNA tech. But, all of this is only worth so much- and, ARCT is probably somewhat overvalued here at just above 1B market cap. Investors need continued PR on success results short term, but it is time for ARCT to step up and become a legit clinical medicines company, not just in name only."
there are lots of potential with ARCT's LUNAR and STAR rna vaccines. Biontech will have lots of cash and might acquire all its technology. Price will go up when Phase 3 starts.
"The A.H. pop is a bit surprising, as I thought the forward looking info on the vaccine was already out there. As far as the ""global entity"", if it is a whale that will swallow ARCT, not sure that is a good thing as some people think the small shareholders in TBIO are getting the short end of things from Sanofi. Would rather own shares of a company with triple digit growth then just getting a one-time 50% pop."
"A good lesson today, down $3.84. As WonderfulBlevic urged earlier this month, choose your buy point carefully, keeping in mind what this company has achieved and the challenges it faces. I do think this weeks news is very positive,#1- there is news, unlike the secrecy forced by Singapore, ARCT will update shareholders on progress in Vietnam#2- unlike Singapore's 5 month Phase 1, we have a 40 day Phase 1 in Vietnam#3- some chance of Q4 revenue in 2021I think, until Phase 3 news, ARCT will continue to 'track' Moderna, more or less. There will be considerable swings and opportunities."

Announcement should give the stock a boost today. They must be reasonably confident to establish such an agreement. Onwards and upwards.
this is going to move up AH! looks like a charming stock which only works late in the night.
Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Brian Cheng maintains Arcturus Therapeutics (NASDAQ:ARCT) with a Overweight and raises the price target from $71 to $85.
Arct is becoming a franchise. Next is targeting lamda variant in south america doing a deal with another company. arct 21 is the rolls royce of booster shots till the next update ;)
Today was fun.
Barclays maintained Arcturus Therapeutics (ARCT) coverage with Underweight and target $48.
"Cathie Wood bought 115,000 more shares today via ARKG."
The analysts drove down the price from ~$90/share to ~$27/share by issuing multiple downgrades and only to have it driven back up to $70/share after hours based on a $2.00 loss per share for the quarter and the company still only doing trials. This is stock manipulation at its greatest.
"Based On Eric Topol, we do need a booster at about 6 months. Seriously we don't have enough vaccines, we need them at a much lower costs and easier transportation and storage. The analyst sees it for the north American market. The need is by the billions beyond that. And we need lots of it, much of it need to be purchased by Covax and distributed."
"Low float, lots of enthusiasm, in mRNA cutting edge. This should close $50 today!!!!"
Chart patterns still indicating that ARCT goes higher .... the 6-month chart shows a perfect low volume handle forming off a deep cup pattern since 3/1. This follows the recent bullish flag ... the reason I entered this stock in the $49 area. GL all !!

"Courtesy TohJah on twitter: Part 1: Arcturus Therapeutics $ARCT: Part 1 Collaborations, Global mAnufacturing and expenses with cash position. (Part 2 about their science)The deal with Vingroup is significant, given Vietnam's low vaccination rate. Arcturus will receive $40 million upfront payment and potential royalties based on vaccines produced. Vinbiocare will also pay for mRNA drug substance supplied by Arcturus and royalties on vaccines produced at the Facility- targeting a capacity of up to 200 million doses per year. Unnamed global entity has selected our ARCT-021 vaccine to be included in a global phase three trial, which they will sponsor and fund with participating country. They will partner for ARCT-154 for vaccine program with Vinbiocare who will sponsor and fund our stage phase three clinical trials targeting the Delta variant. Vinbiocare biotechnology the part of the Vin group, one of the Vietnam largest corporations. Partnering these two vaccines will save us well over $300 million in clinical trial expenses. A global entity selected ARCT-021 for a global phase 3 clinical trial - this represents >$300m savings in clinical trial expenses. Global manufacturing footprint: They have diversified our manufacturing footprint with strategic partners in Asia, Europe and the USA. Last week, we announced the key partnership with the Vin group to produce up to 200 million doses per year in Vietnam starting in 2022. Signed a joint venture agreement with Axcelead in Japan to form a joint venture Arcalis to produce mRNA drug substance beginning in 2023. Axcelead is a Japanese company that formed a comprehensive collaborative partnership with Hitachi to develop solutions for next generation biopharmaceuticals.They also expanded our relationship with the rest of the Recipharm in Germany to significantly expand drug product capabilities, including fill-finish production of our lyophilized vaccines.They continued strong relationship with Aldebaran and [indiscernible] in United States and Polymun in Austria.Expenses: total recurring operating expenses averaged about $55 million in each of the first two quarters of fiscal year ‘21. Approximately $10 million is attributed to G&A and that should increase by $1 million or $2 million for the remainder of 2021. The remaining $45 million in R&D expenses relate to our current pipeline, supporting our OTC cystic fibrosis, LUNAR flu, and COVID vaccine programs, including stockpiling long lead time raw material and vaccines for the EUA. This amount is expected to increase in the second half of 21 as we ramp our production of ARCT-154 vaccines. Their cash balance at the end of the second quarter was $434 million and they received the remaining 30 million for upfront payment for Vinbiocare last week. Based on their current pipeline, the company's cash position is expected to be sufficient to support operation for more than two years."
just hold and relax. don't sell until $100. this is my plan.
"And we’re on a roll!Arcturus Announces Approval of Singapore Clinical Trial Application to Advance ARCT-154 and ARCT-165, Next Generation STARR mRNA Vaccines Targeting SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern, in a Phase 1/2 StudyAugust 3, 2021 at 7:00 AM EDTSingapore is the second country to approve the advancement of ARCT-154 into clinical developmentARCT-154 and ARCT-165 elicit high levels of neutralizing antibodies in non-human primates against multiple variants of concernSAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 3, 2021-- Arcturus Therapeutics Holdings Inc. (the “Company”, “Arcturus”, Nasdaq: ARCT), a leading clinical-stage messenger RNA medicines company focused on the development of infectious disease vaccines and significant opportunities within liver and respiratory rare diseases, announced today that the Company has received approval for a Clinical Trial Application (CTA) from the Singapore Health Sciences Authority (HSA) to enable the advancement of two STARR mRNA vaccine candidates into the clinic. The Phase 1/2 clinical trial will evaluate the vaccines both as a primary vaccination series and as a booster following initial vaccination with Comirnaty. The Phase 1/2 trial costs are funded in part from a previously secured grant from Singapore.ARCT-154 and ARCT-165 are next generation STARR mRNA vaccine candidates targeting current SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. Preclinical data demonstrated that ARCT-154 and ARCT-165 induce strong neutralizing immunogenicity in non-human primates to SARS-CoV-2 Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta variants. Arcturus also recently announced approval of a CTA for a Phase 1/2/3 clinical trial of ARCT-154 in Vietnam.“SARS-CoV-2 variants are an increasing public health concern, and we believe that ARCT-154 and ARCT-165 may be well designed to elicit potent immunogenicity to a broad range of emerging variants, including the highly contagious Delta variant. We are pleased to have obtained approval from the Singapore Health Sciences Authority to proceed with the Phase 1/2 clinical trial of ARCT-154 and ARCT-165, and we look forward to the initiation of the trial in Singapore in the coming weeks,” said Joseph Payne, President and CEO of Arcturus."

"Looking forward to the press release sometime late Jan 2021 that will announce dosing initiation for the Phase II trials. FDA has not put a clinical hold on the trial as of the 28 Dec press release - no news is good news! Fast Track Designation would be a bonus.https://www.fda.gov/drugs/investigational-new-drug-ind-application/ind-application-procedures-overviewMuch has been said about the lack of neutralizing antibodies in the Phase I/II trials. Prof Ooi provided possible explanations at 27:00 & 29:40 (both discussions based on the MMR example, adequate T-cell response kicking in and clearing infection rapidly such that B-cells don’t need to churn out neutralizing antibodies) and 49:00.Press conference: http://public.viavid.com/index.php?id=142847Earlier in the outbreak, the buzzword was antibodies. Antibody testing, getting antibodies from vaccines, emergency antibody treatment, “immunity passports” based on antibody tests. Months on, scientists gathered more information and now have a clearer picture about what it takes to establish strong immunity against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. More evidence is emerging that cell-mediated immunity (T-cell response) can protect us from the virus even when there are low levels of antibodies. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says it best, “The detection of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 does not indicate directly protective immunity and correlates of protection for COVID-19 have not yet been established.”https://www.nature.com/articles/s41577-020-00436-4https://www.clinicbarcelona.org/en/news/can-you-be-protected-against-covid-19-without-antibodies#:~:text=A%20drop%20in%20antibodies%20does,are%20low%20levels%20of%20antibodies.https://www.bmj.com/content/370/bmj.m3563https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/covid-19/latest-evidence/immune-responsesIn this period of vaccine shortage, the UK has made a calculated gamble of spacing out the prime booster shot (Pfizer vaccine) in favor of extending protection to more people. The decision was drawn from the efficacy achieved after the first dose during Phase III trials. By doing so, the UK has looked beyond achieving antibody counts associated with implementing prime booster shot and focused on achieving efficacy. This leap to embrace efficacy data instead of relying on antibody counts bodes well for ARCT-021 and will help people to break away from the notion that antibodies equate to immunity. https://edition.cnn.com/2021/01/01/health/uk-vaccine-doses-chief-medical-officers-intl/index.htmlOnce the concern about antibody counts have been put to rest, the Phase I/II results & pre-clinical data will prevail and point towards ARCT-021 passing the Phase II and III clinical trials."

jesus whats the short interest here. This things getting attacked hard
It's gonna be too tempting for those already up in gains to sell in the morning when it starts trading pre-market gapped down. Red futures won't help either. Smart traders preserve capital and capture short-term gains to re-invest.

Pre-market noise. No way hedge funds can bring this down enough to cover short positions. Will take a while to unwind in a controlled manner hopefully another 50% increase from here.

I heard about ARCT the other day on (http://Fairstox.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
Holy smoke why didn't I buy this today?
Don't regret you never buy today.
Arcturus Therapeutics is up 8.24% to 33.89
Look at these factors- way under VWAP- RSI is low on the weekly - we are within the center of the Bollinger bands on the weekly as well- we should see a pop here as that was the dip and 50 is showing some small support
"Hello, I gain much from contributions in forum, blogs and YouTube and on the whole made lots of money from it. In general, I go against consensus, I try to buy low and sell high. So in the sense the traders are right, they did just that, they bought low and sell high. I would like to add my thoughts here. We learn and we take what we believe is right. It is your own journey. But my temperament is to go long, so if ARCT goes really high like 68% gain, I enjoy emotionally the temporary high, and enormous gains. But I know it is just for a moment, if I were to sell, I would make the gain but that is NOT the gain I want, I believe in its story as the story unfolds and i don't want to lose the massive gains that might come later. What if another news come out as I certainly think it will, then it is very hard to get back in. I rather take the hit and accept the drop. So those longs ...do your research and drop your notes here."
i was expecting this to go higher than the current 4.15% increase so far!

Maybe, maybe not...I think the big money will manipulate the stock price down in the months prior to December's announcement, just like they did prior to the recent news that skyrocketed the stock price. That's my take... There is no such thing as easy / fast money, unless you get lucky."

Only positive news and catalyst in sight. Ignore the current votality and look ahead. Good is coming.
Earnings on Monday will tank the stock. They only burn through cash.Get ready to buy after earnings number comes out. We can buy it on the cheap!!! Sell on any strength and buy back on dips around November to reap the benefits from Trial results in December.No way this price will hold until the trial results come out in December.
what’s going on here?
Trials in Vietnam for ARCT-154 begin August 15.https://www.goodmorningvietnam.co.kr/mobile/article.html?no=44005
"Average price target is $68 ""Wall Street is neutral on Arcturus Therapeutics Holdings Inc (ARCT). On average, analysts give Arcturus Therapeutics Holdings Inc a Buy rating.

"Will this stock rocket like BNTX? i sold BNTX and doubled my investment, the next few weeks after selling, it doubled again. my timing is rubbish!"
reddit chatter double tomorrow
"Currently despite the success of BionTech and Moderna in mRNA vaccines, many big pharmaceutical companies are still lacking in mRNA capabilities. If we look at Moderna now, it is using its mRNA in the development of a number of potential therapies, drugs, vaccines or treatments. That is a big positive. Big pharma are behind the curve if they don't acquire mRNA technology. For last one year plus, even MRK was unsuccessful in developing covid vaccine with the old methods. mRNA is here to stay and for discovery of new treatments.."
It will be insane if it doubles tomorrow. Thoughts?
Down $2 to $29. News is misunderstood.ARCT can't drive the narrative due to reporting circumstances.
PFE licensing deal this morning with Voyager shows that there is huge value here in ARCT for big pharma.
"It looks like the Global Entity mentioned in the PR for ARCT-021 Phase-3 trial is a neutral third party which is evaluating more than one vaccines. It could have be sponsored by some entity like I-Spy. I-Spy is evaluating a number of drugs for treatment of COVID. Selected companies in the trial only contribute their drugs/vaccines and the cost of the trial is paid by I-Spy. I-Spy is supported by Government. I am just guessing because unlike Vietnamese deal, no financials details were disclosed in the trial of ARCT-021."
Well on the bright side - gives one more time to accumulate more shares.
Shorts are in HUGE Trouble with this one. May cross $100 soon.
"Was anyone able to make sense of what was explained regarding ARCT-021? I’m unable to comprehend what’s the difference with ARCT-154, since the latter has similar number of T cells, AND has more neutralizing antibodies wrt variants. It is clearly superior, even with the additional dose. What’s the point with continuing ARCT-021?"
when Goldman downgrades you by 20 points then look out.
this is the end today for longs...
"For long term holders: In December 2021, VinBioCare plan to complete and submit procedures to the Health Ministry to ask for approval for VBC-COV19-154 vaccine for emergency use in Vietnam. In total Vingroup through VinBioCare will have spent USD$240M. FYI, this is the biggest conglomerate in Vietnam. Part of National service for the country and it will springboard them into Biotech. I still am a bit surprised by the fact that it says will complete Phase 3 by Dec and will distribute the vaccine during Dec. Reason I suppose ARCT 21 shows it is safe so they are confident."
No turning back now.....100++
Any idea why they are short laddering this to such an extent. It received an upgrade along with a nice target
$300 mil grant to do a p3
downgraded again by Raymond James today!
between 60 to 70 today ?
Glad I averaged down from $43 to $34. The roller coaster is now on the up yay!
I am still waiting for the mysterious phase 3. Joseph said imminent with funding or will save over 300m because of this entity
Sell while you can... You know there will be more down grades coming... They have no revenue and a only have trials that should have been completed months ago.
"Great price action today based on the news. Lots of people made tons of money. However..... Pigs Get Slaughtered. If you think this will keep rising in the coming days after a 68% rise in one day, you're dreaming. People will take their profits as they should after such a spectacular day. It'll keep dropping in AH as profits will be taken, gap down overnight and settle back into the low to mid 40's tomorrow. If you're greedy, though, keep buying and holding at these prices!"
they should not have negative earnings and vaccine progress press at same time. it’s easy target for pump and dump scheme.
"ARCT should be over $100, where it belongs, more appropriately over $200. I don't know why it fell from $130, but lucky is everyone today for being able to buy ARCT so cheaap."
"People think Covid is done and Moderna won, lol.There are 6.7 billion people on earth that have not been vaccinated yet.All 8 billion human beings will need booster shots.Every 6 months.For years.For the next dozen variants.Why does Arcturus have 2 vaccines in Ph 3?Because 10 is a good start.In my opinion."
Holding premarket expect $70-80 this week and new base of 60 plus before next big move.Look at other COVID stocks It’s part of game Lockdown Variants etc
"ARCT has $400m cash, but last six month ot lost $200m. Therefore, it will not have cash to finish the test of virus except to have extra finance:https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1768224/000156459021042750/arct-10q_20210630.htm"
There was also an announcement made yesterday about payne meeting with the prime minister of vietnam on expansion of the collaboration. I also see that indonesia biofarma and health minister had talks with payne in US in august and september about collaborations for covid vaccine... the global entity?
"Courtesy TohJah on twitter:PART 2:ARCT-021 (for original variant) is significant because it is a single-dose regimen, and doesn't require ultra-cold chain logistics to store and distribute - these 2 attributes are critical for distribution in emerging markets... Organizing double-dose regimens and ultra-cold chain logistics in large, developing nations are not trivial (things which we take for granted) so these advantages mean ARCT can catch up with other mRNA competitors - it's not late to the game, potential as booster shots to EM countries which want to supplement their non-mRNA vaccines COVID Vaccines from ARCT: Three different Covid-19 messenger RNA vaccines which may have reduced side effects when administered are being developed with Singapore's involvement in their clinical trials. Why? Each dose of the Arcturus vaccine contains five micrograms of vaccine, compared to 30 mcg in the Pfizer vaccine and 100 mcg in the Moderna vaccine. Why only 5 micrograms for their vaccines: because of the ""self-amplifying"" mRNA technology they use. Late to the game trial: The first vaccine, known as ARCT-021, targets the wildtype, or original Sars-CoV-2 virus, and was developed together with the Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore. Local phase two trials, administered by SingHealth's Investigational Medicine Unit, are still ongoing. But the other trials: The two newer vaccines - ARCT-154 and ARCT-165 - target the four variants of concern, Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta. ARCT-154 against Delta and ARCT-165 against Beta variants. The local clinical trials will evaluate the vaccines' safety and immune response against the variants, and as possible booster shots for people who have received the Pfizer vaccines, said Associate Professor Jenny Low, as per the unit's deputy clinical and scientific director. The ARCT-154 vaccine is also undergoing clinical trials in Vietnam, in parallel with the trials conducted here. The trials here will also evaluate the vaccine as a booster jab. The data for both trials will be pooled in November, he added. While conventional mRNA vaccines ""teach"" the cells to produce the Sars-CoV-2 viral spike protein to trigger an immune response in the body, the self-amplifying mRNA vaccine produces the protein at a lower level for a longer period of time - usually a couple of weeks, said Mr Payne.The longer duration will generate the same neutralizing antibody response in the body as well as help it develop a more robust T-cell response. T-cells are thought to confer long-lasting immunity to the virus and its variants."
"Ahead of data, thoughts on what's next? Should we expect to see additional governmental contracts / funding? ARCT is now part of a very small club of (non-big pharma) companies that have made it to human trials, but has a significantly lower valuation vs. INO, NVAX, BNTX, MRNA -- all of whom have received significant non-dillutive financing from large governments, and in some instances, prior to release of initial human data."
"i got BioNTech @30s, sold @60s, now it is @330s. So do your maths......don't regret like I did."
"If anyone wants to see a perfect example of a ""bull flag"" or a ""bullish pennant"" stock chart configuration, check out the Yahoo 1 month chart for ARCT. It IS the reason I bought into this stock a couple of days ago at $49.25. Charts matter! GL Longs - let's see Big Pharma show us the money!"
second round beginning
Held thru alot of pain for quite a while. Glad i didn't sell
"Was 41% AH yesterday, but only 30% premarket. Not too bad, but wait to see what happens after 9:30"
"Low float, secular market. Big Pharma wants MRNA. Load up!!!"
"Again, last weeks news was misunderstood, still a great value here at $34. Get those options as well. The insults stop immediately, this is the type of news we expected from a company intelligent enough to partner with Dr. Xu and Dr. Shu.They will leapfrog all others in certain parts of the world.They will save lives. Sorry about the empty bucket insult- Pad. Payne, I still don't trust you, but, well, what the -."

"Beautiful example of a bullish flag for ARCT ... look at 1-year Yahoo Chart. Also crossed 200D MA, so IMO buckle up we're going higher!!"
This one is way off its high in a year. Congratulations everyone. This have more room to run?
Is the company going to announce interim P 1/2 trial data￼ of ARCT-154 in Vietnam? That could be a catalyst before November if company announces those data and if data is good.
Goldman Sachs analyst Madhu Kumar downgrades Arcturus Therapeutics (NASDAQ:ARCT) from Neutral to Sell and announces $29 price target.
"https://ir.arcturusrx.com/static-files/8cd75184-e5ed-4ca0-8924-f2410cede49c Slide 17: Arcturus developing covid vaccine for children. Pfizer expanded vaccine testing to children (12 and up) in Oct. Moderna did the same in Dec. Arcturus' advantage is its low dosage - lower risk of adverse effect in children. (Pfizer adult vaccine dosage is 30 mcg/dose; Moderna 100; Arcturus 7.5) It is also showing promising results when administered as a single dose. That means half the vials required to vaccinate each person, one less trip to the clinic, etc. For kids that are afraid of the pain, they only need to go through hell once if it's the Arcturus jab. The low dosage also means there are more doses to go around. Arcturus can internally manufacture up to 30 g of non-GMP mRNA in less than a week. That is sufficient for 4 mil doses or 208 mil doses a year. If each dose sells for $20, that is $4.16 bil of revenue for 1 year. Current market cap is ~$2.5 bil. The company signed Catalent and Recipharm to scale up manufacturing of the vaccine. Arcturus' lyophilized (freeze-dried) vaccine also does away with much of the cold chain requirement seen in Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. That makes it ideal for distribution and stockpiling. The cold chain requirement in turn requires the Pfizer vaccine to be stored in special low-boron glass vials, a potential supply chain issue. Countries are buying more than they need in anticipation that the immunity acquired from vaccines will wane over time (months/years). The Arcturus vaccine won't kill its competitors but it will grab market share if/when it obtains FDA EUA (est H2 2021) due to the advantages that come with the single dose and lyophilized differentiation. The Phase I/II trial conducted in Singapore is expected to progress into Phase III before end of 2020. Given that the vaccine will start arriving in SG in Q1 2021 and that the Phase III trial is conducted in SG, I think the authorities will approve it before FDA and put the millions spent into good use."
"Sanofi is to acquire TBIO. This is driving ARCT higher in AH trading. If TBIO is acquired for ~$50, then ARCT is worth at least $200. Don’t sell your shares. We will get our price in a year."
New baggies are going to hold longer or will be left holding. Market is tanking and this may go straight to $30s.
Singapore's Temasek (soverign wealth fund) led an investment into Biontech and bought Pfizer vaccines. Biontech is investing hundreds of millions into SG. ARCT 154 and ARCT 165 approval of trial in SG. So what do you think might be next set of news? By the way Sanofi is investing $400m Euro in vaccine production in SG. Knowing Singapore strategic nature of building a biotech hub and its believe primarily in MRNA ...so what do you think?

"Good job to those smart ones who sold early this morning for a nice profit!!!....For those that bought this morning, you'll have to hold a little longer to break even and/or make profit.For those short sellers, it was a awful morning to say the least.You can all thank the stock manipulators. This stock should have gone down with a loss of $2.00/share."
"I got in $ARCT at $40, then soon after $ARCT ran to $130. Did I sell? No, because I know $ARCT is worth $300, and I don't care that $ARCT fell back down to $24, because I don't have a crystal ball, and I know $ARCT is worth $300, just as I know Newegg is worth over $100."
If you asked me this stock will be at $59 or higher anytime soon. That’s a key bullish area then sky will be a limit. Hold or regret
"Non profit has a top science advisory board plus of course this is the who's who people of ""investors"". Investors do not get a return in terms of $$ but in terms of successful implementation. So far their hit rate is pretty good. Oh yes..includes Curevac...big investment into them too. One of the criteria is scale, and I think they funded so many western vaccine makers, ARCT did not make the early cut as money of mind boggling scale is also pouring into Asian Vaccine makers (yes China, Korea...) Perhaps now it is ARCT turn as they have to demonstrate scale in vaccine production. If they can't no big bucks."
"https://www.todayonline.com/voices/close-professor-ooi-eng-eong-co-developer-singapores-covid-19-vaccine-candidateMy interpretation is that I was right. ARCT-021 was dead in the water. Hence the new developments. Despite ARCT-021 trials being said to be “imminent”, it’s been more than a month since and the 3rd party entity still hasn’t even announced!They are restarting with 154 and 165, and hoping this time they will succeed. Do they have time in their side? The competitive and sales environment is many times more difficult than last year. Good luck to them. I urge all investors to do your own sums. With more than a hundred vaccines being developed (including many national vaccines) and with many already in Phase 3, how many doses can ARCT actually sell? And and what price and profit margin?Then value the company accordingly and decide what price you want to buy."
Time for ARCT to set up one for Mu variant too.
Acquisition Merger news mostly on Monday Be prepared Anything possible
"I bought ARCT 18 months ago, before covid was a thing. I invested in ARCT because I think it has the best longterm potential for treating cancer. I believe that personalized therapeutics are the future of medicine and ARCT is at the forefront of this new age. The global hunt for a covid vaccine is helping ARCT get recognized, but the potential of the company is far bigger than covid IMO."
"Fantastic news on the ""global entity"" P3 COVID study!!! If you know anything about the recent Sanofi-TBIO acquisition, you recognize that this is a likely prelude to an ARCT buyout, IMO. Big pharma has to get into the mRNA game!"
"16% drop in 2hrs, lmao. Do you know why? It's because I bought it. Always happens. It happened at MRNA at 170 (dropped to 130), with BNTX at 130 (dropped to 80), with NVAX as 150 (dropped to 120). I bought QS at 130 (dropped to 115). I even tried shorting SPWR and it went up yesterday., when I bought back my shares it went down. I tried shorting again and then it went up. I then bought at the end of the day and it dropped 6% this morning. So I switched to ARCT and of course I'm losing. Moral of story,. do the opposite of me."
"Where to even start with this?If you had any hopes that there would be revenue here in 2021, NOVA tells you- NO. If ARCT completes its Phase 3 in December, ARCT will be 6 to 7 months behind NOVA, so maybe some table scrap revenue for ARCT in back half of 2022. Any 'news' from ARCT again will have the same effect as spitting in the fan. May 10 will just demonstrate how far behind ARCT is. In the Q1 call, they already claimed Phase 3 will be minimum dose arm with a another booster arm. ARCT has done nothing regarding lypholized data, they could of worked up some preliminary data, but all 140 employees are too busy to actually do the work. The corporate deck on the website is a joke, still nothing but rodent data, this all that they can post. The target franchises listed are dwindling, again, all 140 employees are too busy to actually do work. Maybe on May 10 dysfunctional Payne can announce some new areas, just use the term cancer and or dementia- pretend like ARCT is going to do some scientific work, then just make the franchises disappear in a couple of years with no explanation. Corporate deck still lists 460 million, but as of Dec 2020. How much is owed to Dr. Xu and Dr. Shu? Also these discoveries are 10-12 years old, others will catch up. They have guts calling themselves a CLINICAL medicines company. CF is a slow walk, the best that can be accomplished this year is the CTA. There is still tremendous hope in the CF community for mRNA, but the name Arcturus is now rarely mentioned or listed. The CFF really got their money's worth.Not too late,here. Still appears to be the best combination in the mRNA space, but time to actually produce. We still own some stock, but our $20 buy price looks like it is in danger. If you need the money before the end of 2022, do like insiders are doing, sell some periodically."
Lucky me. I just bought this thing before closing yesterday and then decided to tack on my first ever options buy. Call @ $35. Talk about good timing. I did have a sell order in for $59.50 last 5 mins but never got there. Fingers crossed for one more bump up tomorrow...
"I have read the technical data presented by Duke NUS and going through the transcript. The reason why ARCT stock plunge is because the analysts were unconvinced by the data as neutralizing antibodies were scant in ARCT 21 compared to Biontech. On the other hand Duke NUS argues that neutralizing bodies weren't that great in Biontech either and other factors were at play for it to have give protection by day 14. Duke NUS argues that T Cells immunity is more critical and in fact more important to tackle the variants. The data that Duke Nus presented actually had numbers that were many times better biontech but it took more days for ARCT 21 for results to show. The mysterious 28 days, is where there were huge quantities of NAB in ARCT 21 and in fact Biontech had 0. The amount of T cells response from ARCT 21 is many factors above Biontech. But some of the big hitter analysts wrote negatively on ARCT. There were other analysts were largely supportive. To me, it is mystery why they are doing 2 shots for the ARCT 154 trials, it is like they are playing safe (why?) and they are going to create this super vaccine. ALso they expect by end Dec, ARCT 154 will be given to the vietnam population. This can only mean ARCT 21 safety profile for phase 1/2 has been accepted such that ARCT 154 goes to phase 3 soon."
The short % is 25% of float bad call shorties that alone will get this to next level resistance 75 then 90+
"The last time this stock went up 70% in a day, which has only happened once, it came back down 20% the next day."
is their titers data stronger than Moderna?
"I read the PRs again. Some additional points (assuming I interpret them correctly, but i guess more info should be forthcoming in upcoming corporate results update / conference:a) I see the ARCT-154 as a second wing for revenue, purely for Vietnam. Good that there seems to be some urgency on the part of the Vietnam govt. Should help push things along and increase possibility of early EUA.b) ARCT-021 is still the lead model vaccine. To differentiate against the ARCT-154, the latter is the conventional two doses vs the single dose ARCT-021. In addition, there is no mention that ARCT-154 is going to be lyophilised. Probably there is no need to, since it is purely for Vietnam's use, is manufactured within Vietnam (hence storage, transportation etc is not going to be an issue).Let me know if at the above makes sense."
"ARCT closed just above the 200MA… a really bullish sign, especially after this long period of consolidation"
7:43a ET 8/12/2021 - MarketWatchArcturus Therapeutics downgraded to underperform from market perform at Raymond James
Waiting patiently for $48
"Disappointing, should be up $40, only up $11. Incredible."
"it was believed that ARCT-021 could be effective as a single dose, as compared to Pfizer and Moderna which require two doses to be effective.“Not only is it a potential single shot and a very low dose, but you combine that with the ease of manufacturing this vaccine. It means that we can make a significant impact in millions of people,” said Mr Payne.The Singapore government has already set aside more than S$1 billion for COVID-19 vaccines."
This stock is very cheap. $300 plus soon
Smart money sold yesterday... Greedy money bought yesterday & today as the smart money dumped the stock... They will accumulate again as they push the stock price down.Advice from the wise... Always sell on huge gain... Take profit and then buy back in again... After a huge up day on a low float stock will result in a substantial pull back the next day...

"Unless you want to buy, you hope it goes down. If you want to sell, you hope it goes up. All is noise , it does not matter till Monday"
"I know many people (including me) are disappointed that analysts at Goldman and others have downgraded this stock. Its tempting to explain these downgrades as conspiracies or manipulation. But this is highly unlikely. In the words of Napoleon Bonaparte 'Never ascribe to malice that which is adequately explained by incompetence"". ARCT has about $460M in the bank, with multiple clinical trials funded by third parties, and will be financially healthy for many years and well beyond the timeline needed for them to prove the analysts wrong. ARCT is fine, we just need to be patient and wait for the market to recognize what is already obvious to us. Buy the stock, but maybe think twice about buying call options with a short expiration."
"If you check their corporate presentation, they have updated ARCT 021 as phase 3."
Could ARCT run out of cash next 6 months?
vaccine progress in 3rd world countries will not admissible in US. Sold
ARCT has fallen - Chapter 2 releasing soon.
"non profit entity has heavily invested in to Oxford/AstraZeneca, Moderna, and Novavax COVID-19 and latest a few Asian based vaccine makers. And yes, the big promising ones seems like well over UD$300M. And many more smaller vaccine makers especially for next generation vaccine which serves as a platform for other Virus. They anticipate Disease X. So this is like creating an army for the eventualities of more killer virus."
"The team opened the press release extolling the virtues of the ARCT vaccine: Low single dose and lyophilized product. We have heard those before. Moving on to Phase II - OK, sounds like it’s progressing well. Then came the macaque test results (Slide 4) - still sounding good. Almost everything after that was about defending the idea that T cell response is more important than neutralizing antibodies. Slides: https://ir.arcturusrx.com/static-files/7f1f7674-71b0-4276-8b88-339c3e51b671Press conference: http://public.viavid.com/index.php?id=142847The team wanted everybody to know that cellular immunity (T cells, CD4+ & CD8+ responses, Slides 12 to 14) was more important than the humoral immunity (Binding antibodies, neutralizing antibodies, Slides 10 to 11). What did not help was that good preclinical data for the titer counts did not translate to the Phase I/II results. The hardest to swallow was Slide 11 because the neutralizing antibodies were not showing up. That is why the floor opened below the stock price today. Everybody was focused on the neutralizing antibody counts because Pfizer & Moderna had good neutralizing antibody counts and they had impressive efficacy charts (slide 18) to show. Today’s press release was a clear disappointment for those looking at neutralizing antibody counts. Having scored very well in eliminating fatalities in hACE2 transgenic mice and macaque models, the team realized something was wrong with just looking at neutralizing antibody counts. Some things did not add up; convalescent COVID-19 serum figures for recovered patients had a wide distribution (Slide 11) but all remained protected from re-infection, breakthrough infection in mice when CD8+ T cells were removed vs no issues when B cells (humoral immunity) were removed (Slide 21), patients with antibody disorders were able to mount a good resistance against the COVID-19 virus with T-cell responses (Slide 22), proven T-cell role in MMR infections (Slide 23), the case of high dengue viral load even with high antibody count which came down only after CD8+ T-cells showed up (Slide 24).The anecdotal examples seemed to tell a story that cellular immunity is the way to go and the team was keen to prove the case in Phase III trials. By not going direct to Phase II/III trials, the team might have averted a situation of getting caught at the wrong end of trial framework changes - wise move! Better to have a checkpoint at end of Phase II than to have “completed” Phase II/III only to find out that the rules have changed. ARCT-021 could be the vaccine to prove that cellular immunity (without humoral immunity) continues to show high efficacy in preventing COVID-19 disease. High-risk moment when we make it to the efficacy chart.The Phase I/II cellular immunity responses support the case for ARCT-021 as a single dose at 7.5 mcg. The 5 mcg / 7.5 mcg prime-boost cohorts are insurance and data points to prove that prime-boost only offer marginal benefit over a single dose at 7.5 mcg.Links to info that support the cellular immunity argument:Discussion on how ongoing vaccine efforts are focused on neutralizing antibodies. There will be a need for new approaches (other than looking at neutralizing antibodies) if problems emerge in the vaccinated population with breakthrough infections, waning antibody levels after vaccination and/or emergence of new viral strains. https://immunology.sciencemag.org/content/5/53/eabe8063Long-lasting cellular immunity of SARS patients after recovery and T-cells that offer robust cross-reactivity to the N protein of SARS-CoV-2. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2550-z“Strong evidence that T cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 may last longer than antibody immunity.” https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4257“The T-cell response against the coronavirus nucleoproteins seemed to correlate with the degree of later decline of the antibody response to those proteins, but this did not hold true for the response to the Spike protein (the two were uncorrelated – antibody responses to the Spike protein could go down, while T-cell responses remained).” https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/11/11/good-news-on-t-cell-response"
Just back from work. Can anyone explain how we have jumped this high ! Amazing ! Thanks
I would like to see new P3 trials in countries other then just Vietnam and Singapore. It doesn’t look like company will announce any new trials in any other country during earning CC today. But if they mention that they are negotiating with other countries for additional P3 trial then it would help otherwise stock will drift lower.
Set a high price (Over $100) for sale so shorts can not borrow your shares. Brokerage firms are eager to lend your shares to short sellers and get interest on your money.
COVID 19 plays are done. This is going back down to 35
Who is regretting? It is still cheap. $82 is coming.
"Reading ARCT's press release, it has given me an impression that the 'm' in its ARCT-145 mRNA vaccine candidate has taken the genomic code of various variants, including Delta, and is tested as effective in non-human primates. While its earlier candidate ARCT-21 was using the original virus code. Is it correct to assume that ARCT-145 has fine-tuned its 'm' that could make ARCT-145 as the new/2nd-gen vaccine that could be more effective than what we now have got from likes of Moderna and BioNtech?"
"Be very careful if you are here following a Motley Fool trail. ARCT awaiting FDA and HSA evaluation of later phase trials. Phase 2 in early Q1, involving a critical Prime Boost Component- no navigating around this. Phase 3, maybe late Q2. Dilution at $110, now over a week to close. $17 and $53 took a few days. CFO has a thin, almost non existent track record. All told, we do see an 8-10 B market cap, toward close of Q1."
"Do I read this right, Merck would be able to produce 10 million treatments by year end, and ‘more’ next year? How does this compare to the BILLIONS of doses produced by the existing approved mRNA companies? It’s a drop of water on a hot stone. Good to have additional treatment options. But it’s not a silver bullet."
I invested in BNTX around april last year. I knew what was good although no analyst recommended it and clsimed a pt of $40. I bought Tbio - Sanofi devoured it. I think I know potential and im taking my chance on this one.
What changed? Apart from the world needs more vaccines. Booster shots are confirmed. Translate Bio being sold off is confirming this idea. Time is running out for Pharma/Biotech to get into the game. ARCT believes it is worth more. Money was previously raised $120. 500M in cash. Hot money will soon flow in.
Oldest trick in manipulation .......GS downgrades then they buy cheap from weak hands . This will open above 49 and then it should go up .....potential is huge and yes rough road but this is great company to hold

Pfizer market valuation is 245B. Relying on Biontech is not a solution for growth.
Short covering tomorrow Wait & watch $80 EASY
"If you did not know, who do you think broker the deal with Vietnam? If you do know and who is behind that organization, you will get goosebumps."
I am 80% in profit. $29 to $50
It is like mini Moderna at big discount but similar platform. I am sure some acquisition discussion in progress..Possible $80 pps if acquired
"ARCT, where is your 3rd phase trial, the world needs good vaccines. And you said you had very good T cells response."
Raymond James analyst Steven Seedhouse stated in a note to the firm's clients that the efficacy for ARCT-021 with a single dose could be as low as 62%. That's a disappointing level compared to Pfizer's efficacy of 95% and Moderna's 94%.
"This one is finally seeing some significant traction with December getting relatively close, and don't discount how important the ARK buying is.... Cathie has a ton of followers out there."
The oral covid antiviral pills would soon come online. Is this a game changer for the vaccine market? Definitely another blow.
Dumped all my shares for a hefty gain today!!!Will buy back when this puppy heads lower again. Rinse & Repeat... Nothing changed like others said in this forum except they got permission to do more trials & testing. Their only testing is on non-primates yet again. No income generated more expense for their partners.Let's check back prior to the trial results in December... Buy in November on the dips!!!
"all of these recent developments only confirm for me that our FDA with too many Big Pharma execs on the approval committees are sabatoging American ingenuity and the American people for profits over progress. another company I am involved in, CYDY has had to take their multiple indication, non side effect, effective drug to Brazil and the Philippines. The FDA itself is not the problem....BIG Pharma interests and self serving agendas sabatoge American health for profits. part of the solution would be disallowing Big pharma employees, especially those with VISIBLE conflicting interests, from existing on these boards in the first place, and replacing them with scientists and doctors who still remember their hypocratitc Oath. Don't misunderstand. I'm a shareholder who wants to see the companies I invest in succeed and reward me with the benefits of that success... I just want to see our FDA operate in the manner befitting an institution that was designed to impartially review and approve or disapprove drugs based on true efficacy and benefits to the American people not squewed toward the preferences and parameters of big pharma. So far, our newest technology, such as moderna and RNA have been most effective in dealing with covid 19... traditional, old school big pharma is behind that 8ball...and boy is it showing"
"I would have understood (I would not have agreed with it however) GS downgrade back in July when ARCT did not meet or even comment on their missing their own self imposed Phase 3 deadline. I think, after the CC, that ARCT is developing a strategy that will result in some sales in Q2 2022. The revenue will not be overwhelming, but should be enough to push this company to breakeven. Depending on what the world is like come April or May of 2022 sales could be better, but, by that point in time COVID would have moved on to new variants. In the meantime, depending on what ARCT can put out as PR depending on the trials, there should be sufficient good news to maintain this $50 level."
I am with Wonderfulblevic. TBIO acquisition sets a possible valuation for ARCT in the short and mid term. Longer term and if they are not acquired then think earlier Biontech valuation when it shot up.
"Many negative comments out about overvaluation in the Covid space in the past several days, mostly focused on Moderna. Negative impact on entire space. In the beginning stages of the vaccine craze, the market seemed to value the vaccine at around 8 billion dollars to market cap. This is the number that we still use. JPM, Goldman seem to be in the 4 to 6 range. We don't see the 8 billion as being strict, there will be a large overvaluation well into Q1 of 2021, assuming success. Moderna has run up from a market cap of 10 B to 28 B today, was much higher in mid-July. Management there is crooked, Tal Zaks has good, but not great science in the Moderna vaccine. Moderna is overvalued, it will take quite a while before the valuation comes out, but it will. Arcturus has, we believe the best vaccine candidate of all, based on the information that they have put out, and what we know about their potential CF therapy. Arct has a 1 B market cap, prior to Covid we were buying Arct in the 150 million range shortly after CFF investment. We look for several B to hit the arct market cap due to a successful vaccine. Add in several CF announcements during 2021 along with other breakthroughs in OTC and others, and there is the potential for a huge multi-year run- all while helping to bring successful therapies to those who need it. We are completely in at much lower levels, no room to buy here. But, for others, worth an investment here on weakness, at these levels."
