Rotation back into tech with reOpeners staying strong —> a super strong amalgam charging the bull. Where does this leave AMED? In a perfect position .
Ned Davis downgraded AMED yesterday. But that alone can not account for such a sharp drop.

Everyone wanting to put calls should be very cautious here. My wife quit this company. When she left the entire Chicago land area had 2 RN nurses left for an entire territory. AMED was turning down patients left and right for lack of staff and it has not improved.
