Any thoughts on the Safe Harbors deal? Could be some synergy I guess.
SUI reached a new All Time High at $105.18
"I have held this stock for some time now. Years ago I sold at $39 ... and of course, I bought back at a higher pps later on. Over time I learned one thing about SUI -- buy-hold-never_sell! It pays a fair divi, and it acts like a growth stock. Well run company-growing its portfolio of properties. If you are not familiar with this company, check out their properties-not just a 'trailer park' stock. Their properties are planned communities (upscale mobile homes), but in addition their most attractive properties are glam-camping RV parks in 31 States plus Canada. They have the 'Jellystone Park' camping properties (as in Yogi-Bear theme). Their dividend has *never* dropped over all their years - check the 'max' historical prices (since 1993) AND 'max' Chart. Plus SUI is extremely resistant to market declines. I will never ever sell my holdings."

I heard that there was a rent strike in Naples. no pool or hot tub. gym closed.
What causing the big drop in stock price????
I took profits at 170 and will repurchase when this debacle ends. Hopefully increase holdings by 15-20%.
why the sudden drop today?

"Earnings out. Great, and distribution increased to $3.32."

I love SUN as an investment but worry about them as landlords. It seems they continue to alienate their tenants. As an RV'er I come in contact with SUN properties daily and I am so disheartened how often I hear angry and disappointed park residents are with SUN. So many are selling out and moving on. My worry is how long can this keep up before it starts affecting the bottom line and my stock price.

This is one of the best defensive plays. Poor people need a place to live that's affordable. Cheap skates like living in trailer parks too

A cash flow machine.
This REIT is currently working on a water conservation project over their entire portfolio. It will be completed in 2021. They’ll see 15% saving on water expenses. Annual $ savings in the millions.
