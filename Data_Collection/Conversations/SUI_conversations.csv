"Much as I don't want to sell any shares of SUI, if the yield gets below 1.5% I am going to give it some serious thought."
Nice mention in Barron's. Guy says SUI and ELS are in demographic sweet spot and should grow 10% a year for many years to come.
I love SUN as an investment but worry about them as landlords. It seems they continue to alienate their tenants. As an RV'er I come in contact with SUN properties daily and I am so disheartened how often I hear angry and disappointed park residents are with SUN. So many are selling out and moving on. My worry is how long can this keep up before it starts affecting the bottom line and my stock price.

This is one of the best defensive plays. Poor people need a place to live that's affordable. Cheap skates like living in trailer parks too

"I have held this stock for some time now. Years ago I sold at $39 ... and of course, I bought back at a higher pps later on. Over time I learned one thing about SUI -- buy-hold-never_sell! It pays a fair divi, and it acts like a growth stock. Well run company-growing its portfolio of properties. If you are not familiar with this company, check out their properties-not just a 'trailer park' stock. Their properties are planned communities (upscale mobile homes), but in addition their most attractive properties are glam-camping RV parks in 31 States plus Canada. They have the 'Jellystone Park' camping properties (as in Yogi-Bear theme). Their dividend has *never* dropped over all their years - check the 'max' historical prices (since 1993) AND 'max' Chart. Plus SUI is extremely resistant to market declines. I will never ever sell my holdings."
