Read the CFO’s article. “Healthy Balance Sheet”Nordstrom is the perfect apparel retailer for the new economy. They have casual wear and high end suits/dresses for work and events. They have the perfect blend of physical and digital assets. Watch them thrive
OVERSOLD !!! JWN’s PPS WILL RECOVER SOONER THAN YOU THINK !
Beth and beyond just missed earnings big time. supply chain and inflation ate into their profits. bbby is down 27%..I suspect this to happen with jwn for the next earnings.
Buyout announcement today after the market close?
Took a 1300 share position on Friday. Just based on technical this looks beyond oversold. Stop loss at $25.50
Why it’s still crashing after hours
"I've been very bullish on $AFRM and $SOFI for a few months as they both have been gaining market share at various websites I'd visit. So the $AMZN partnership announcement on Friday was no surprise. I sold my $AFRM over $100 this morning for over 45% gain and moving it to $SOFI and adding even more shares of $JWN under 29....Nordstrom will be back above 38 in the short term in no time. I have also added more shares to $ADSK, which I expect to be back above 340 also in the short term.Keep buying $JWN, $ADSK, $SOFI. Keep holding."
We should be back to mid $30s before the next earnings call 
Rising tide
I can’t believe JWN market cap is 1/13 of Lululemon! I never even heard of lulu brand! 
Lets go!!
Wait for it... Santa Claus is coming to town.
How is 2 pennies for dividend going to drive this JC Nordstrom to $40 Amy? 
Its not enough to add shares at this level. Load 6 months out call option to maximize gain in q3 and q4. Back to school and holiday seasons plus decreasing Delta infection rate will push this to 40ish easily.
"Can’t get any lower, will head back to $37 within week"
"Get ready for reversal, pile up or average down.Insider option activity has solid bullish sentiment"
"Wall street is being ridiculously hard on JWN. Last ER is not exactly a blow out record compared to competitors, but it's not bad at all. At least give JWN till end of year before starting to downgrading it left and right. What a bunch of manipulators and sheep."
"Can’t go any lower, up up from here"
"CNBC was saying it is because of the supply chain constraints. But this issue is to every company, from nike to macy's. My intake is that if they want it go down, then it is a big issue, if they want it to go up, then it is no big deal."
"At such low price I am all in on call option at 30 strike expired April 2022. I am almost certain they will beat estimate even more in next two quarters and re-instate dividend, which will pump the stock to at least $40/share"
$35 by end of November and $40 by Christmas. I am doing all my Christmas shopping at Nordstrom

Nordstrom is loaded up with debt... profits lagging even with all their layoffs... they got rid of the cream and kept the skim.
Going to pick up some LEAP call options at this price.
Buy buy buy
Next week is setting up to be a potentially; massive week. 52 week low will start creeping up and news for kids getting vaccinated should start coming in to focus. Lots of major cities are still not back to normal.
Amazon sales slowing? Looks like folks are going back to brick and mortar! 
$50 soon. just wait and see. glta.
"Tara GonzalezThu, September 2, 2021, 3:00 PMJennifer GarnerJennifer GarnerBauer-Griffin/GC Images Jennifer GarnerJennifer Garner is a celebrity beloved by the internet, which means she can basically do no wrong. Unless you count her skinny-jeans fandom, but whether that's wrong depends on who you ask. Gen Z queen Emma Chamberlain said on her podcast that she hopes that they never come back into style, but clearly, Garner isn't listening.Just yesterday, she was spotted in an extremely famous pair of skinny jeans by celeb-loved brand Mother. (They might look familiar because Meghan Markle is also a fan of the style and has singlehandedly caused many a sellout.) Mother's The Looker jean are known for staying true to their name: The flattering style tends to cause double-takes, which is to be expected when you're twinning with Jennifer Garner. By the way, one style of The Looker, the crop skinny, is under $100 on Nordstrom right now but likely to sell out fast.The best thing about The Looker is that there are various iterations to choose from. For a darker wash, there's the high-waist skinny, and for a more classic denim look, there's the ankle skinny. If you prefer black denim over classic blue, the frayed ankle comes in the perfect soft black — Nordstrom shoppers are obsessed. The only downside is that most pairs cost upwards of $200. But the frequency with which Jennifer Garner wears hers just goes to show Mother jeans are a timeless staple you'll wear over and over again."
That moment when the investors realize the quarterly report was actually pretty stellar and the stocks down 27%!
My short position is very profitable lol
"Calling it now. Back to $45 by spring. All kids should be eligible for vaccination. All schools, events and optional (in-person) work will be 100% open. Nordstrom will know what to carry, they’ll be able to forecast; and will return cash to shareholders. 2022 is looking great. This may be your last chance to buy JWN under $30"
"News from List of analysts on JWN today: """"11:07 am ET August 26, 2021 (Benzinga) PrintNordstrom, Inc. (NYSE: JWN) shares have taken a dive this week after the company reported second-quarter earnings and sales that remain below pre-pandemic levels.On Tuesday, Nordstrom reported second-quarter adjusted EPS of 49 cents on revenue of $3.66 billion. Both numbers exceeded analyst expectations of 27 cents and $3.36 billion, respectively.Nordstrom revenue was up 96.7% from a year ago. Yet sales are still down about 6% from the second quarter of 2019. The company said sales from its anniversary sales event were up 1% from 2019 levels.Nordstrom reported 30% online sales growth and said digital sales now represent about 40% of total revenue.Looking ahead, Nordstrom raised its full-year revenue growth guidance from 25% to 35%, ahead of analyst estimates of 30%.Related Link: Upstart Stock Soars After Q2 Earnings: $635B Auto Lending Opportunity?Peer-Lagging Performance: Morgan Stanley analyst Kimberly Greenberger said Nordstrom’s earnings recovery is on a “clouded path.”“We see further stock price downside as revenue recovery appears protracted & cost inflation pressures EBIT margin, putting $2.40 consensus 2022e out of reach in our view,” Greenberger wrote.BMO Capital Markets analyst Simeon Siegel said “2019 casts a long shadow” for Nordstrom.“Of particular note, the anniversary sale was only 1% above FY19’s comparable sale, with ‘peer’ lagging performance at full and off price,” Siegel wrote.Credit Suisse analyst Michael Binetti said Nordstrom’s numbers represent “significant lag vs. softline peers.”“As we’ve looked ahead to the US retail re-opening, our thought was that JWN’s 2021 Anniversary Sale could be one of the biggest events in the sector, but the event was only +1% vs ‘19 (for context, URBN’s Anthropology just reported 2Q revs +15% vs ‘19),” Binetti wrote.Profitability Targets Within Reach: Telsey Advisory Group analyst Dana Teslsey said Nordstrom will have to do better to justify its valuation, which is higher than its peer group and its own historical levels.“Looking ahead, JWN can benefit from its exposure to the off-price channel, a profitable digital presence that continues to grow, and a pruned portfolio of full-line stores that can provide an alternative retail experience and accelerated operational efficiencies,” Telsey wrote.KeyBanc analyst Edward Yruma said Nordstrom’s second-quarter numbers suggest its 2022 profitability targets are well within reach.“2Q is unlikely to satisfy the near-term bulls given the continued expense pressure, but we think the Company made continued progress against its long-term initiatives, and we think further reinforced its position as the premier multi-brand premium/luxury retailer,” Yruma wrote.Nordstrom Ratings, Price Targets:Morgan Stanley has an Equal-weight rating and $36 target.BMO Capital Markets has a Market Perform rating and $28 target.Credit Suisse has a Neutral rating with a price target lowered from $39 to $34.KeyBanc has an Overweight rating and $45 target.Telsey Advisory Group has a Market Perform rating and $36 target.Latest Ratings for JWN DateFirmActionFromTo: """""
"I would have thought that the JWN customer was in much better shape to spend than the M customer. But, perhaps Macy's has been doing more for a longer period of time to address its challenges than has JWN."
To put it in perspective here is the YTD performance comparison:JWN -5%M +150%DDS +250%
"Wow, beat estimates by like 10-20 cents, but people are inclined to sell? If this isn’t manipulation then idk what is anymore"
"Not covering until I see $15 or lower, so bag holders you will be holding the bag for a very long time!"
Next quarter the analyst should compare earnings to 2015.
I expect October to be volatile. However once Congress passes infrastructure and reconciliation bill end of mont I expect the whole market to rally. I would not add till September job report is released Friday. Market will have a big rally starting October through end of year. I see JWN at $35 and I am being conservative. Consumer sitting on a ton of cash
"Revenue didn’t exceed 2019 because of the following. All of which can be improved upon. -their urban store locations are yet to recover -traffic is better but not fully back -work attire and similar categories yet to recover -supply chain constraints in process to be figured out But while they didn’t take full advantage of the top line, they:- cut significant fixed costs permanently -brought gross margin flat to 2019-paid down debt -achieved healthy free cash flow -signaled dividend by EOY-grew digital customer (after 5 year investment)-continued data driven integration for inventory and merchandising -partnered with ASOS to attract young customersThey clearly have momentum in revenue. They noted sequential growth into August. Eric said they are not satisfied with the pace of growth and will be taking a lot of lessons from the anniversary sale into the holiday sales. Hopefully the environment will be better by then as well."
BBBY stock 's sell off has come back nearly $2 with the help of the WallStreetBet army. It will help JWN stock and other retailer stocks to cut off today's sell off in sympathy of BBBY earnings issue. JWN is at a good bargain pricing right now and it should rebound to $28 by Friday or early next week.
"when it happens, it’ll be my favorite short squeeze of all time"
heading back over $30
"GPS earnings releases and UP big.... This will lift the retail sector tomorrow.Hope JWN will rebound big tomorrow too....""""High tide lifts all boats tomorrow"""""
How is this remaining so low. someone should buy it. It would be a steal at $35/share.
" Ages 5-11 vaccine coming soon, holiday shopping starting early, reduced competition. It’s going to be a crazy holiday season. Better get your gifts early. We’re about to see spending like we’ve never seen. "
"Yahoo starting to hype buying dividend stocks. Nordstrom was a good dividend stock from 2011 - to the start of covid. Now looks like a great time to get in before the dividend comes back. Not sure when it will come, but they have said that they would like to bring it back."
Kaboom!
Keep buying under 30 while you can. Consumers want luxury goods and demand has continued for months. I said it before: Nordstrom is not going anywhere. Keep buying. Keep holding.
Starting to get a headache from hitting it on this $30 price ceiling so many times. Ready for a break through!
We’re stair stepping. The last big step was LAST November. Will we have the same this November? 
Check the YTD chart and see the double bottom. Potentially very bullish 
"Sentiment is poor and wall street is pretty bearish on JWN. I love it. Today is a great day to buy more. As the economy recovers, the sky is the limit for JWN. This is when you want to be in!!!!"
Maybe we are at the bottom - the endless selling seems to have ended
Bag holders everywhere
"Bad news seems to be baked in. As supply concerns ease, covid subsides, and management gains confidence; the top will blow off. I think JWN could be an easy 2x within the next 12 months."
Today had nothing todo with fundamentals. Only emotion.
Yeah I am not believing this -6% in response to such a fantastic result. I think its a fake-out designed to drive the price down so they can buy tomorrow
"DAVIDSON RESEARCH FIRM ADJUSTED NORDSTROM (JWN) TO $34.Currently, JWN is sitting at 29.04 , sell off 2.00 today. Not all analysts created equal."
okay.. 25% dip on a decent report.. now u start buying.
"The CEO is being interviewed on CNBC, he comes across passive and self doubting, does not project confidence at all...Just an observation."
I just turned Long guys....
40 by December
"Perfect storm for the shorts since last quarterly dividends of 37 cents ended with ex date of 3/29/2020. Just any mention of dividend resumption and these hedgers will fly. Incidentally it’s a free ride for them when there is no dividend, otherwise every quarter they have to cover the dividend. Management is abetting the 18% that are currently short according to the TD Ameritrade site."
"If Macys is doing this good, then JWN should atleast step up their game!"
What an unjustified drop!!!! Still believe we’ll finish the year strong. Time to load the boat 
Had to buy back in. While I do project it could fall to $25.00. I think current value is too good to pass up. I will hold no matter how far it drops.
Buying opportunity
The ‘fundamental’ reason for the drop is that Macy’s sold 2% more same quarter 2019 while JWN sold 6% less. Let’s discuss that and what the prospects are for JWN.
I thought Nordstrom has always been rated as more desirable stock to own than Macys. What happens here all of the sudden? What changed fundamentally?
Ready to run again!
ANF 's earnings yesterday. It was outstanding and ANF stock was sold off. But it came back big today becausethe whole markets sentiment was positive.BIG LOT (BIG) earnings was released last night. Sold off around $7 at open today and now only lost 2.50.JWN was oversold in the last 2 days after an outstanding earnings and came back today. Still sitting inthe oversold territory and JWN will come back to $33.25 by earlier next week. Be patient investors andhave a nice weekend.
Everyone is selling and all these optimistic bag holders are talking about rebound?
"Should break $30 today, it’s time for a rebound. Hopefully the shorts can feel a little pressure!"
11% in 5 days anyone short better cover
GREAT BARGAIN PRICE HERE. IM SO THANKFUL FOR BEAUTIFUL OPPORTUNITY. 36-38 in a week max !
"Multiple upgrades tomorrow. Got mine at 34.90 because i knew they would sell off. Thanks weak hands, Going into next quarter with raised guidance. Too many upgrades tomorrow will make this a winner."
"IMHO the floor has been establishedLow 27.94 13-Week Low 27.94 1-Month Low 27.94GLTA, regardless of your position, may the best man win"
" Up about $2.00 since the October 12th bottom! I love it. That’s the power of JWN. I’ve seen this go up $4.00, in just one day; multiple times this year. Hold strong "
What will happen to the stock price when they announce that the dividend will be reinstated? Will we see upside movement? Or will it stay flat?
Not bad for a Friday. This was in the $30s just a few days ago. I don’t see why we can’t get back there soon.
"@BBBY -Bed Bath and Beyond's earnings this morning was a disaster as result of supply disruptions thathas caused it.@JWN and other retail stocks were sold off in sympathy of@ BBBY's earnings problem ( remember: @BBBYearnings today for the quarter ending 6-30-2021).Here is the the supply disruption news that has been resulted for the retail sectors as most clothings, shoes, hand bags, jewery products are mostly produced in Vietnam as Vietnam is the country with the lowest wages in the third world with young and skillful workforce. Look at the announcement news below that was in the news over weekend.""Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh of Vietnam said in past Saturday that business can resume production starting this week in an effort to help boost the economy admid talk that US retailers could shift factgories and supply chains out of Vietnam due to Covid lockdown in the whole country recently.""It looks like Vietnam will solve the supply problems for many US retailers including high- end @JWN supply disruption fears ahead of holidays.... @JWN today's sell-off is overkilled in sympathy of @BBBY fears.I am a buyer of @JWN sell-off at this deepest discounts pricing @26.35 right now. Seeing the rebound tobetween $29-$30 next week."
Nice long term hold here
Amazing that they downgraded to junk status. Wow Nordstrom is a high quality brand. So much nicer than Macys and TJX. I hope this is the bottom . This would be a nice time to announce going private for $45 / share
"Get ready for hitting and close $ 30 EOD, JP Morgan building positions"
"It’s infuriating how this oversold stock goes up less and down more than M and DDS. Short squeeze can be the saving grace. We don’t have much of a JWN specific catalyst until the next earnings report which I’m admittedly worried about. I know JWN will show growth, but a repeat of less than it’s peers again might do damage."
Friday after market close is the time when buyouts usually announced. I wouldn't hold a short position over the weekend
JWN STOCK price will come back nicely if GPS blows out its EPS tomorrow.I am buying JWN ahead of GPS earnings as JWN is so oversold today and currently sitting in theoversold condition. Be patient to those who want to see the JWN rebounds back. I am seeing JWNis at $33 at least near term or end of this week.
"You may not see it now, but we are in the middle of an epic economic recovery. Demand is roaring back and that’s why we have supply shortages. It takes time to ramp up production, but we’ll get there. Increase in demand is a great indicator for economic recovery. The consumer is doing well and pretty much anyone who wants a job (and is capable) can get one. I’ve never been as bullish on America, as I am now. We will be a much leaner and efficient society."
"@Matt, thanks to you.I got in @ $26.30 for 2k shares.Will only sell when it's in the high $30!"
"Many hundreds of billions of $$$ issuing to benefit child tax credit this year for many families with children between 1 day old to 17 years old would receive over $10K per year per family, more than $1400 per US adult person received in earlier this year. See how much the stimulus to the US spending and the consumer sectors were benefited the most on just $1400.00 per person. Now looking at over $10K for an average US family per year, that will even pump so much spending into the economy..... Beside that, the markets continue hitting new high in all stock exchanges that even make American families richer.... They are all enjoy wealth and spending $$$ on shopping..This is a consumable country....That will benefit JWN as well as other retail sectors..... Buy JWN on any sell off at this deep discount value...."
"Lol, wow. Enjoying a whiskey and cigar on a holiday weekend and open the JWN yahoo forum....The shorts are frantically posting on a holiday weekend.... you guys made a nice little win. Why are you still here? Waaaayyy bigger chance of 30 than 25 this week. Gotta know when to cash out. GL."
Cmon end above $29 today
"So we're living in the upside down, a company that has blowout results gets hammered because of some imaginary supply issue but MEMe stocks that have absolutely no results are up 30% someone please wake me up."
Easy $35 to $40 stock next 2 months.
"Severly oversold, market drama like always, several stocks dropped this august after good ER reports and bounced back. Free cash flow generated in Q2 is impressive (10% better than 2019!!), making the long term debt looks smaller. Low 30's price is a good area of support, time to pull the trigger!"
"Worth noting that Nordstrom has consistently managed inventory well. Peers have, and had, excess amounts that they needed to move (and helped pad their numbers). This helped peers, as they could sell through, and not have to wait for all of the shipping and production delays. Manufacturing and delivery delays are most likely Nordstrom’s biggest headwind, but will get better."
$35 by end of year. Consumers sitting on a ton of cash. And Congress about to pass both bills by end of month. Big rally coming
"This is so terrible. I lost 20k~ in just 2 days. I should’ve sold it when it was at $37, I guess I’m holding till next earnings."
Buying
"Interesting. With good ER and guidance and largely beat expectation, price dropped more than 20% in 2 days with major index being neutral and mild. Something doesn’t add up at all lol"
"News from Vietnam regarding the manufacturing of clothings, shoes, handbags, jewery for the US retailers in the recent talks with the Vietnamese Prime Minister that the he allowed all the MFG companies to run 24 hours shifts in an effort to keep all the US companies to stay in Vietnam, not to go back to China.This is a win-win situations for both Vietnam and the US manufacturing in Vietnam. The supply disruptionsare being resulted before the Thanksgiving and for Christmas Holidays."
Some class C analysts complaint about JWN earnings saying their analysis on the JWN earning was soft compared to its peers. What a laughing stock!!!. They losttheir faces as their combined consensus covering JWN stock per share was 100% lower what JWN earnings per share actual. They should have admitted that they missed it but go around complaining to justify their calls . JWN will deliver much more in the next quarter....
NSX in shambles. did you lose all of your money yet?
Retailer stocks are predicted to fly high toward the end of the year.
"If this hits $25 I’m buying more, but thankfully this should be the bottom."
"The return on capital employed article is misleading. It’s looking at the last 12 months and makes no effort to note that many Nordstrom stores were closed or had almost no foot traffic; for almost half of the year, last year (California shutdown had the biggest impact as Nordstrom has a higher percentage of stores in CA than other retailers). 12 months ago, bankruptcy was a real possibility. Now Nordstrom is doing well and ROCE is getting better."
Let’s recap why Nordstrom is the ultimate back to normal play:-people are moving back to urban areas where Nordstrom’s sales were hit the hardest -foreign travel ban was just lifted which will bring tourism revenue back to Nordstrom’s urban stores -kids are going back to school boosting back to school shopping-people are slowly going back to work which will generate the work attire revenue Nordstrom is known for -people are going out and want to finally update their wardrobe -Nordstrom’s upscale brands position it well to get new customers from aspirational buyers who want to buy higher than they ever did before
Glad I added to my short position yesterday at $30.50
This should stay above $29 today
28 million short interest already up 185 million today alone. Ever wonder how the investment banks make so much money 
"when a company meets the goals that have been set for the quarter, a muted after hours move is reasonable unless there was a major run up prior to the announcement. But if a company significantly exceeds the metrics set as Nordstrom's just did, it is not reasonable to change the goal posts to a comparison to two years ago. This is just an analysts trick to be seen as relevant and to move the stock in the direction his top clients are betting on. When you add the 35% guidance which was effectively an almost 50% increase, this should have been a no brainer regarding a stock price rise. This is pure and simple manipulation."
"@Matt, I got in again when JWN was at $26.30 few days ago...Got 2k shares.Not sure it's that even a good entry, LOL!!But personally I think this is definitely worth more than $30 per share..."
"If you’re looking for a short and sweet guide to the day’s biggest news, I recommend (http://Thetraderguide.com). They breakdown the most important pre-market news and it only takes a few minutes to read."
This is such BS they just had earnings and just RAISED guidance. Clearly they wouldn't do this if they had the same supply chain issues as BBB.
Buckle up. Don’t get discouraged if you bought in the $30s. I think we could hit $50 within the next 12 months. Consumers have lots of cash and COVID should really end soon. Management will have more confidence in product assortment.
"At this price Nordstrom is a screaming buyout target, and buyout price won't be less than $45 per share. I don't know how shorts are sleeping at night"
"Let’s all send positive vibes for a great earnings for Nordstrom tomorrow, they have really been beaten up"
"Matt and longs, be prepared to have the best Christmas ever. Making a ton on oil and JWN. Buying a brand new F150 cash once JWN hits $32. Loaded. Have a great weekend"
I rather give my money to charity then buy this #$%$
"Can’t go lower, Buy more"
In a few months we are gonna wish to see high 20's this will be in the 40's Longs have seen this stock jump double digits in a single day multiple times.Obviously that's not the kind of market we're in now but nothing lasts forever.Stay strong my JWN crew...
"Nordstrom stock price target cut to $27 from $34 at J.P. Morgan 8:49 am ET September 13, 2021 (MarketWatch)"
Finally have long term capital gains on my Leap calls and equity bought at $14 a share. Now the wait for a solid rally and I can start to fade my position.
"$JWN really needs to focus on the inventory aspect. It’s a highlight of their business. Of course you can’t reach 2019 levels with all of the delays in manufacturing and shipping, unless you have excess inventory like $GPS and $M had. What’ll make this jump is reinstating the dividend and/or announcing buybacks. Which will happen at some point. $JWN is becoming a lean, mean; cash machine. After we have clarity on what the post pandemic world will look like, the sky’s the limit for JWN."
"It’s not rocket science, if they do return cash to shareholders; pps will spike and we’ll find new support. Check the last earnings call. They do want to return cash and the balance sheet is looking great - per cfo"
"Anyone here has any idea what was the price for JWN prior to Covid?Here in Tampa, FL, the JWN store is always crowded.Moreover so during weekend!"
"I do see those that dropped it down so swiftly, digging among the bones left and brining this stock back up to 33 or 34 today. Unless you have to sell, hang on there for at least 35 by week's end."
JWN is due for a big bull run like Macys into uncharted height. Hopefully soon. I see their local stores are doing well.
Zero gains in 17 years. Stock at levels first reached in 2004. Eric Nordstrom needs to resign.
"…, $40 is eminent, Enjoy the ride "
NSX saying he adds to his short position every time it goes up but has been short since the teens 
Nobody believes me
It's a fabulous store. I bought 200 shares today at $28.00 and may bring that up to 500 shares by the end of the year.
In less than 2 weeks JWN was on the verge of going over $40 to getting kicked in the teeth over earnings despite a beat. Now a credit downgrade simply on the fact that a few of their peers are posting better results but not due to any particular issue at JWN. Seriously? Supply chains have been disrupted. Yesterday the news pointed out that 44 ships are sitting off the California coast full of goods......
@Piddie: JWN market cap is 4.5B. No income tax in WA. Amazon might look at JWN right now....
Why is it crashing?
"After 3 times of pumping this retailer, and dropping drastically, I've decided not read bag holders comments."
"Oversold. Just bought it after Cramer screaming sell, sell, sell"
"99.99% certain JWN will start paying dividend within the next two quarters, which will send the stock to the 40ish. Keep adding on long call option at this point."
$31.48 is the target. We get through that and $40s are very possible; in the short term.
I can say for a fact if this even touches $25. I’m going all in! Even though I do not want it to even go near that price.
"nordstrom is more than just a mall play, it is also travel play, when foreign tourists come to USA, a stop at high end retailer is a must. Likewise when domestic tourists travel, they tend to buy fancy clothes too."
Seriously?! No one else thinks JWN is a smoking deal? Crickets over here and I love it! More shares at cheaper prices for me. COVID’s about to end and 2022 will be the year of travel and events. Load the boat now or be left behind.  
Nordstrom stores are packed in Seattle area today especially the rack stores; yet the stock is behaving like it is going out of business. I am loading on more long call options at this ridiculous low price!
"Don't worry, this will be green by days end. Somehow shorts are flexing there muscles. Institutions will jump in on these discounted shares. I'm a buyer at this level."
"It makes a lot of senses if Amazon buys JWN at this cheap price. Both AMZN's and JWN 's corporate offices are in Seattle, Washington. You never know.!!!!!"
October is a volatile month. Congress should pass both bills in weeks. Huge rally in November and December. Easy $35
All the big mass selling from funds are likely done in past couple days. This is the rock bottom price to enter folks.
Stay above $26
"JWN: There are not many retail stocks when releasing their earnings included the 2019's in their comparisons. The CEO might be HIGH when he spoke.... (Just a joke).Usually they compared the the earning for the current quarter/current year to the prior year's quarter in this case for JWN 's EPS and REVENUE on the last quarter on Wed night for the last quarter was outstanding and respectable. They also gave the whole year 2021 outlook positively...Analysts tend to follow the herds and many time they were wrong and the markets just ignored them.For example: the ACI stock price last week when sitting at 27, price was increased to 24 (that indicated the overbought) and the whole group of investors jumped in to boost it to 30...That tells you there are bad analysts out there as their firms shorteda certain stock and when the stock price was down far enough, they bought back and then followed by anupgrade. If you think the JWN stock was oversold and there are good revenue and growth are strong enough ahead of Thanksgiving and Christmas ....then be smart to get in at this deep discount because the oversold was so excessive....JWN will rebound between 33 to 35 near term......Remember there are 2 sides of the trade, one party sells, and one party part buys.... Be patient......."
Macy?s bonds have been rated ?junk? for years. Stop freaking out. There is also a trend to bring entertainment back to malls such as movie theaters. Yes the old #$%$ malls are crashing but Nordstrom is in the nice malls that are coming back. Check the statistics.
Revenue grew 35% vs guidance 25%company lifts full your guidance
Wait why the sell-off just beat earnings?
It's Criminal that longs are holding on to their shares when this JC Pennies going out of business soon!
Up slowly and steady. Love it. At this rate of increase we should hit $35 by end November
what kind of market manipulating shenanigans is going on here???? with almost four times the normal volume the price is falling or static????????
"Eric , obvious Wall Street is looking for a replacement for u and your brother to run this company. Take a look around and compare your performance over the past 5 years. It’s extremely dismal versus your peers."
"Yikes! That's the biggest drop I've seen in a while. I still have Nordstrom on my watchlist from when I was investor, and you guys have my sympathies. I'm happy I sold out during the short squeeze at $45 a few months ago. I posted my concerns at the time, and it seems those mostly came true in the short-term, taking a brief look over the earnings report. I still think this is a decent business, but they took on far too much debt when times were good. It will be a slow process getting out from under that and the big interest expenses, but one positive note I saw is they have successfully reduced their interest expenses from 177M in the first half of 2020 to $84M in first half of 2021. Good to see the business is improving and then smoothly paying that debt down with free cash flow even if profit margins are thin and sales a bit slower than some rivals! They seem to be doing ok to me if that is any encouragement to the longs that have stuck it out here! :)"
Bought is during covid collapse mid 2020 at around $17 after selling puts and taking in a decent premium. sold it around $35 earlier this yr. It was a no brainer at the time as economy hasn't fully recovered and $JWN was getting close to pre-covid highs. Around $25 looks attractive to get in IMHO but not trading advice.
