"Big money playing with the consumer discretionary sector, driving prices as low as they can before the major uptick that will inevitable happen as consumers have hoarded over 12.5 Trillion dollars in excess savings since April, that is called huge pent up demand coming for Christmas. People are depressed and tired of being sequestered in shelter in place rules. Once the election is over and the games start to subside regardless of who wins, the flood gates will open and this Christmas season will be historic in terms of sales and profits for those who have survived the Draconian economic shutdowns. My only concern in regards to Nordstrom which may actually be a bonus is that unlike some of their peers they loaded up on inventory I assume for their annual sale, though that may be problematic if they didn't chose proper designs, then they will have to push a lot of ""obsolete"" stock through the outlet stores. This price was actually a bit too good to pass, bought at 11.77 so pretty pleased and think that 40 by EOY is possible."
"Let’s all send positive vibes for a great earnings for Nordstrom tomorrow, they have really been beaten up"
"Hello fellow longs! What a great couple weeks. Just wanted to post a couple tidbits of VERY good news for the sector amid our runup. Nordstrom is rebounding fast, and I'm sure the question on a few people's minds is: Do I sell before earnings? Is a pullback coming? I can't answer that, but I can definitively say that the sector did VERY well in Q3. Much better than expected. You might think the surge in the clothing retail sector today was due to the positive beat by Kohls. Kohl's said their sales came in much stronger than expected this quarter and they beat, posting break-even profit results with sales down -13% from 2019 Q3 and climbed an additional +11%. But you might not have noticed the more important item that came out today. The October advance retail sales report from the census bureau. Their numbers the past 3 months of August, September, and October in the USA for revenue earned selling clothing and shoes came in at: October: $18778M, September: $17756M, August: $18138M. This is only down 11.33%, 8.78%, and 6.32% from 2019, showing sales trends have significantly recovered in the Fall. Since Koh's sales were down -13% this means their rivals, on average, have done even better than their numbers. So what can we expect from Nordstrom come earnings? Good things I think and the market seems to agree. We have 3 positive bits of info already known: 1) Analysts are bullish on Nordstrom and have been for the whole quarter. Between macy's, kohl's, and Nordstrom, Nordstrom had the highest projected earnings of the trio with a consensus of break-even profit this quarter and profit in Q4 and all of 2021. But note the large disparity in estimates so there is still no real agreement about how they will perform. Why did they have high expectations on aggregate though? 2) Nordstrom shifted their anniversary sale entirely into Q3 this year. Usually it is a few weeks earlier and tends to bring in revenue almost as high as christmas that month. But this year Q3 had the anniversary sale meaning their revenue is expected to be quite a bit higher than peers comparing YoY. 3) Nordstrom has already announced in a retail conference earlier this year that they had their highest sell-through ever on the anniversary sale this year. What this means is out of the items they stocked for the sale, they sold the highest % they ever have. This is great news from a cost standpoint and suggests they may beat expectations depending on how steep the sale discounts were. Despite all this great news, Nordstrom continued to trade at 10Y lows under 45% short interest while smart players accumulated. Then wall street suddenly flipped the story, started posting some good articles about retailers, and triggered a small short squeeze here. Sorry if you got played, but wall street is not your friend and never has been. Their goal is to cause mispricing in the market and volatility so they can profit. Now with COVID vaccines on the way, and retail sales solidly recovering and within 10% of the highs of 2019, the market has suddenly realized they may have mispriced apparel retail. This could run even further up to and on good earnings. I personally think they will beat the break-even expectations and post a small profit, report they have paid down debt, and give positive forward guidance with expectations of future debt repayment and dividend reinstatement sometime in 2021. Their entire sector seems to be recovering much more quickly than expected and Nordstrom in particular tends to have very solid sales numbers every year, being one of the stronger players with a popular brand, with record revenue in 2018-2019. They are not a dying retailer like some. Short at your own risk. I've given you all the obvious catalysts for those that have been following the company more closely and not just trading. Given the large debt load they took on this year, I expect it will take 1.5-2 years to pay it down to pre-COVID levels, so don't expect a surge back to $40 anytime soon. I think $30 could definitely be in the cards though depending on how strong their sales numbers and forward guidance is. I personally wouldn't consider even trimming my position until this is over $25, but expect they will have a nice recovery story the next few years regardless and eventually trade back up to previous levels as they pay down debt and finish launching their recent growth initiatives (new nordstrom local programs, improved online merchandise/centralization, same-day shipping, flagship store...)"
"Brushin'off the haters, for a V recovery!"
"JWN with great ER, Will end above $34.00"
Rising tide
"Stay strong, I owned at $14.00 got nervous as it didn’t move for 4 days and sold at $14.52, the other day I got back in at $14.95, last time before earnings JWN was above $19.50, this go around they have leaner inventory, used all their stores as fulfillment centers during pandemic and now we have Anniversary Sale which is going strong. I was in my local store on Saturday definitely lesser inventory but it was crowded and ALL customers & associates were wearing masks....earnings represent forward thinking"
"I’ve been day trading for years and I’m so glad I finally found (http://Rightpicker.com). They’re pre-market watchlists cover all the latest market-moving news, and they don’t beat you down with tons of ads. Highly recommend!"
Going to be bought out?
"I believe therapeutics by Pfizer and Merck are to be approved by the FDA by November,Things at Nordstrom will improve by year end"
$24s-$25s look likely. May even see $22s-$23s. Watch for an opportunity
year end and quarterly earnings report on March 2nd. JWN will smash that forecast as online and instore sales together have been amazing! After earnings this will be moving towards $50 as much competition has been eliminated!
Buy buy buy
"got into this after it first crashed post earnings. looked like it was a bottom but no luck. oh well... I put a 35 / 27 collar around it so at least my downside is limited, I have room to be back in the green if it rallies, I can trade the options around if needed, and the surprisingly large boost in buying power doesn't hurt. slightly bullish given this really looks oversold, but at the end of the day I dont care too much."
Break the $30 support back down to $15
"Really excited about this one. The last two I have been this excited on was Chipotle at $275 and Tesla at $250 (Check my chat history). I actually sold some tesla and loaded up on the stock and calls (Earnings, Jan 2022 and Jan 2023). I expect them to be able to pay down the debt they needed to tap for Covid in 2021 and by 2022 you'll have a $1.50 + in dividend income, throw the historical yield of 3.5% on it and you have a 40-45 stock again. Do a channel check and website traffic and do the math on anniversary sale and store reopening and consider the wild cards of going private again and that the family owns over 30% of the company and you have insights that wall street hasn't caught on to... yet..."
"Time to admit that I was wrong. Thought the sp would rally into the mid-$40's by earnings on 8/23, next monday. Unfortunately the disappointing retail sales number put that rally on ice."
IM SO THANKFUL TO GET A BIG CHUNK OF CHEAP SHARES TODAY. STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT JWN WILL RECOVER TO UPPER 40 in 6 weeks. Be patient !!!
"This is so terrible. I lost 20k~ in just 2 days. I should’ve sold it when it was at $37, I guess I’m holding till next earnings."
may be the ceo is giving buying opportunity intentionaly i guess
"It’s up a 100% from last year, this has room to fall"
"Can’t get any lower, will head back to $37 within week"
"JPMorgan lowers Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) to an Underweight rating from Neutral after factoring in the department store operator's Q2 earnings report.The firm calls the current backdrop potentially as good as it gets for both JWN's core +$100K income customer - considering the mid-teens personal savings rate, debt service ratio at 40-year lows and U.S. household wealth creation of over $12T in 2020."
"The return on capital employed article is misleading. It’s looking at the last 12 months and makes no effort to note that many Nordstrom stores were closed or had almost no foot traffic; for almost half of the year, last year (California shutdown had the biggest impact as Nordstrom has a higher percentage of stores in CA than other retailers). 12 months ago, bankruptcy was a real possibility. Now Nordstrom is doing well and ROCE is getting better."
Shares of $JWN lost over $6...ouchThis will happen to PLTR tomorrow
Wait why the sell-off just beat earnings?
Need like a BBBY CEO to turn around the mindset at this company.
Why wouldn't a cash heavy company pick this up. Probably grab the whole thing at $40/share. What company could afford such a thing adding brick and mortar to their retail business? Hmmmm
"…, $40 is eminent, Enjoy the ride "
Could soon become the next long attack victim of WSB.

"Yikes! That's the biggest drop I've seen in a while. I still have Nordstrom on my watchlist from when I was investor, and you guys have my sympathies. I'm happy I sold out during the short squeeze at $45 a few months ago. I posted my concerns at the time, and it seems those mostly came true in the short-term, taking a brief look over the earnings report. I still think this is a decent business, but they took on far too much debt when times were good. It will be a slow process getting out from under that and the big interest expenses, but one positive note I saw is they have successfully reduced their interest expenses from 177M in the first half of 2020 to $84M in first half of 2021. Good to see the business is improving and then smoothly paying that debt down with free cash flow even if profit margins are thin and sales a bit slower than some rivals! They seem to be doing ok to me if that is any encouragement to the longs that have stuck it out here! :)"
"Welp, I guess I’ll never understand the stock market."
"Same price like a week ago now, swingers bought for earning pop and got disappointed so it dropped same gain"
Seriously?! No one else thinks JWN is a smoking deal? Crickets over here and I love it! More shares at cheaper prices for me. COVID’s about to end and 2022 will be the year of travel and events. Load the boat now or be left behind.  
Cheap manipulation attempt on a great company that just released great earnings on every aspect.Buy the dip while it lasts (I presume it will go up faster than people think).50$ by next earnings.
The new price target is $35 here. You can double your money in either ZEV or Tilray. Both are the best options for the remainder of the year. September has been a good month to own cannabis stocks. I don’t know why that is except it’s been their history so far.
Great earnings! Heavy manipulation on this. I'm not selling :) you're not getting my shares you parasites

Omg we moved up .08 cents woo hoo!! Lol
Nordstrom is loaded up with debt... profits lagging even with all their layoffs... they got rid of the cream and kept the skim.

Some class C analysts complaint about JWN earnings saying their analysis on the JWN earning was soft compared to its peers. What a laughing stock!!!. They losttheir faces as their combined consensus covering JWN stock per share was 100% lower what JWN earnings per share actual. They should have admitted that they missed it but go around complaining to justify their calls . JWN will deliver much more in the next quarter....
cooooover!
"How come JWN have more believers than DDS? DDS’ books are much better than JWN. Check them out, get in before they’re release their earning on Aug 12th! EPS is way higher"
Lot more pain coming.
Great store experience. Bad management. Heading to 25 or lower soon.
"CNBC was saying it is because of the supply chain constraints. But this issue is to every company, from nike to macy's. My intake is that if they want it go down, then it is a big issue, if they want it to go up, then it is no big deal."
"Wow, I just can't believe that the market served up such a juicy opportunity to profit in Nordstrom twice in 2 years. This is the second time that shorts have driven Nordstrom way down to a great present value on this ""physical retail is dead"" premise and I've profited massively both times ($25-->$42 last year). Thank you so much for your donations guys! Focus on fundamentals next time rather than the stock price if you want to hold onto your money. And don't buy the garbage articles that hedge funds pump out to get you to do what they want so they can profit. Herd behavior works until the big funds pull the rug out from under you... I guarantee you they closed any short positions they had and loaded up under $14.50 just like me while they bashed Nordstrom earlier this year. Analysts have been projecting a Nordstrom recovery starting this quarter for months, and the positive catalysts and retail sales signs I pointed to yesterday were common knowledge, even as short interest soared up to 45% of float while Nordstrom traded to another 10Y low. Easiest money I've ever made. Thanks for the 60%+ profit and hopefully you learned something about doing your own research, hedging your positions, and not using others money to gamble. Nordstrom will likely have many more small pullbacks, but the trend is clearly up, and the market now appears convinced by the rash of recent positive beats and reports (TJ max killed it this morning) that physical clothing retailers did very well. Fair value for JWN is likely upwards of $25, but I will reevaluate after the earnings and see where it settles after the next few pullbacks to decide my sell points. I expect a decent ER given all the positive catalysts."

Kabooom!
Been watching for a while. Bought because they just opened up a Nordstrom Rack in my area (Canada) and it was a 2 hour wait to get in. Lady there said it’s still a long lineup every day so even with Covid restrictions demand is high. Q3 earnings should be good.
"The CEO is being interviewed on CNBC, he comes across passive and self doubting, does not project confidence at all...Just an observation."
Nordstrom is one of the last of its kind. I bought today for a one year + hold.
Ha ha the bottom feeders are piling on. I am a bottom feeder.When shares drop 20% I jump in. I have now clue what JWN does for a living. I hope you and GE are on the same boat. Nordstrom sounds like that electric car company Lordstown?
"Hey gang! Not sure who is still around from when I started posting 2 years ago and following Nordstrom, but congrats to everyone who invested with me significantly in 2020 and reaped the huge rewards! I finally decided to take my profits today while the stock was breaking $45 and I'm out for the foreseeable future. This has been a fantastic recovery stock with enormous gains for everyone that recognized just how undervalued it was in the teens when shorts were crushing it more than its sector at 60% short interest. Fast forward to today and after returning to profitability and several short squeezes later, short interest is nearly under 10%, analyst projections and management projections are solidly positive, and Nordstrom seems on the recovery trend. Don't get me wrong, I'm not selling out because I don't believe in the company. Nordstrom has good management, a solid game plan, and I'm sure they will survive and do well, but given their high levels of debt, saturated and competitive market, and low expected growth rate going forward, I think we are getting well past what I would consider current fair value. That doesn't mean we won't go higher though haha, especially with the ongoing short squeeze that has been rocking retail! I'm moving on to other investments though and wanted to leave one last note! I expect the company eventually will be worth more than $45 in the long run as they pay down debt and execute on their growth initiatives, so not a terrible hold, and who knows, they may eventually become a big online brand abroad and find better growth avenues, but with management currently projecting low-digit yearly growth going forward, and their struggle to continue growing their market the past few years, I mainly considered Nordstrom just a great recovery stock and that is now complete. GLTA!"

"NORDSTROM FAMILY WILL TAKE THE WHOLE OPERATION TO PRIVATE, price tag 45 !?"
In less than 2 weeks JWN was on the verge of going over $40 to getting kicked in the teeth over earnings despite a beat. Now a credit downgrade simply on the fact that a few of their peers are posting better results but not due to any particular issue at JWN. Seriously? Supply chains have been disrupted. Yesterday the news pointed out that 44 ships are sitting off the California coast full of goods......
"Should break $30 today, it’s time for a rebound. Hopefully the shorts can feel a little pressure!"
Had to buy back in. While I do project it could fall to $25.00. I think current value is too good to pass up. I will hold no matter how far it drops.
$15 base

I’m calling $26.98 as the bottom

"Not covering until I see $15 or lower, so bag holders you will be holding the bag for a very long time!"
"Good Job Nordstrom! Nice to see that as I projected they posted a small profit of 53M, primarily as a result of their cost-saving initiatives and anniversary sale. Revenue appears to have fallen exactly as analysts projected, which means that they didn't properly factor in Nordstrom's recent cost-saving efficiency initiatives and effect of the CARES act. Also I noted that online sales held steady at nearly 60% of the business! They've done a good job transforming their business approach this year with online and 1-2 day shipping. Anyway, really great news! They've started to pay down debt as well! Book value increased substantially this quarter, which should bring those high interest costs down a bit. Hope to see more clarity in the cc regarding their cash flow priorities (how long they will focus on deleveraging vs reinstating the dividend, etc...). GLTA!"
"I simply don’t get it,Why would Erik Nordstrom go on CNBC and trash his own company,His family owns 35% of the float,He talked so much garbage on that interview,"
"The idea that Nordstrom wants to go private makes a lot more sense how this drop is possible. Mentioning 2019 was stupid with the current positive numbers but not so stupid if they want it down. Also Nordstrom most likely has enough pull at JP Morgan to get that same day downgrade. That being said, what about the shareholders? I’m feeling violated in the back end and really don’t appreciate the Nordstrom plan."
"Interesting to see this be punished more than even Macy's or Kohls past 2 days. Their analyst outlook and downtrend over the past few years is not shared by Nordstrom at all. This seems to be a sector selloff with no specific bearing on Nordstrom's performance (which has been positive from my analysis). I have a few comments for those that care for healthy discussion of the pros/cons of Nordstrom as an investment: First, regardless of what you as an individual think of Nordstrom, their recent track record has been impressive pre-COVID. Nordstrom's online sales and offerings continue to grow every quarter and were at records last quarter even with the stores closed...and they are even offering 1-day delivery in some locations, with fast shipping in all locations and free returns. I think they are pretty well-positioned against similar rivals. I have been impressed with the moves Nordstrom has been making and have been watching them a while. They are transitioning well into the new paradigm of online shopping and have a unique niche. Unlike many fading mall giants, their record sales years were 2018-2019, so they are still at their peak in revenue and have a healthy and loyal shopping base from the metrics. And unlike Macy's, etc. they actually built up inventory last quarter, clearly expecting a decent anniversary sale event this quarter. Anyway, even if you don't agree with me, perhaps you will agree with the analysts. Analyst consensus on Nordstrom's near-term outlook is much more positive than on peers. The consensus says that this quarter will be break-even (and a few weeks ago they were predicting solid profit this quarter, though a few recently lowered estimates). This is a feat they aren't predicting for the other retailers, which are expected to keep bleeding money. They are also predicting a return to profitability in the Christmas quarter and good profitable results for next year. One final note for those that believe this hype about all physical retail dying: The articles you read are exaggerating. They profit off of the predictable short waves that have happened for months. The reality, however, is that only some kinds of physical retail work well online. Grocery stores are not going along with many other items. Walmart, Target, Costco, etc. are breaking records actually. The same is true of clothing and fashion industries in a sense. Online shopping is unlikely to dominate the market completely unless you are talking about certain garment segments like cheap offrand and one-size-fits-all. The issue is that every brand has their unique sizing and even if something is your ""size"" it is hard to tell if something will fit or you will like it when buying online unless you've worn that brand before. Frequently things have to be returned and the experience can be frustrating. Go out and read the surveys and talk to people. A fair number (particularly the wealthier shoppers) still prefer to skip that hassle and be serviced and try new things on before buying. Nordstrom has been making moves to give their stores services that also can't be offered online easily such as fitting, tailoring, etc. to give even more incentive to utilize their physical stores. And it is working. They have a loyal customer base that is plain from the stats they publish. And for those that still want to shop from home...Nordstrom now offers the same 1-2 day shipping that amazon does, free returns, and is a popular brand. They will no doubt survive just fine. Don't believe the hype that amazon can take over the fashion industry. It just isn't true. Many people despise amazon's marketplace for garments. As for why the market is hating on clothing retail again...don't fret, this is nothing new. This is one of the most heavily-shorted sectors and idles at about 1/3 short interest of float. They will continue to play here and it will continue to whipsaw up and down until the crisis is past. I would not worry much if you are long and not on margin. Just be patient, and thankful that short interest will occasionally give you a nice buying opportunity. I think this is one of those points and finally bit the bullet to invest here. We will see who is correct over the next few quarters: the analysts and me or the shorts that say the entire sector is going bankrupt. Just be careful and don't get greedy on margin. You can afford to be patient if you aren't, but if you are doing that, just one mistake on a beaten-down stock can wipe out your account... ;)"
Its not enough to add shares at this level. Load 6 months out call option to maximize gain in q3 and q4. Back to school and holiday seasons plus decreasing Delta infection rate will push this to 40ish easily.
Keep buying under 30 while you can. Consumers want luxury goods and demand has continued for months. I said it before: Nordstrom is not going anywhere. Keep buying. Keep holding.
"$25 tomorrow, LOL"
Nordstrom is down 7.51% to 28.80
"It’s a problem when you know Macy’s and Gap are doing way better, not wanting to diss the other companies but JWN should be doing better. But it ain’t. Wonder what’s up."
"Revenue didn’t exceed 2019 because of the following. All of which can be improved upon. -their urban store locations are yet to recover -traffic is better but not fully back -work attire and similar categories yet to recover -supply chain constraints in process to be figured out But while they didn’t take full advantage of the top line, they:- cut significant fixed costs permanently -brought gross margin flat to 2019-paid down debt -achieved healthy free cash flow -signaled dividend by EOY-grew digital customer (after 5 year investment)-continued data driven integration for inventory and merchandising -partnered with ASOS to attract young customersThey clearly have momentum in revenue. They noted sequential growth into August. Eric said they are not satisfied with the pace of growth and will be taking a lot of lessons from the anniversary sale into the holiday sales. Hopefully the environment will be better by then as well."
"Wow, beat estimates by like 10-20 cents, but people are inclined to sell? If this isn’t manipulation then idk what is anymore"
Amazing that they downgraded to junk status. Wow Nordstrom is a high quality brand. So much nicer than Macys and TJX. I hope this is the bottom . This would be a nice time to announce going private for $45 / share
"I guess we have to wait till fall, to see any results :/"
"I’ve never posted anything before on yahoo finance, but must say Nordstrom is ￼going to have a blowout for next earnings report. In Roseville California the high end purse section is practically empty. Parking lot is packed with many happy shoppers inside. This Christmas I am appreciative for all the shorts out there that will be buying and driving the JWN price up in 2021! Merry Christmas to all￼￼￼"
already 17.36% up by today in 4 session
It's a fabulous store. I bought 200 shares today at $28.00 and may bring that up to 500 shares by the end of the year.
Supply chain warning is what’s hurting this stock. Same news hit ROST and other retailers.
Took a 1300 share position on Friday. Just based on technical this looks beyond oversold. Stop loss at $25.50
Ready to run again!
JWN CEO needs to step aside. Listened to him on CNBC. He's no salesman. Sounds like a quiet engineer that believes he has years to fix his problems. Can't believe he's at the helm. I could hear money managers screaming as he was talking. Buy at $26 before they announce his departures.
"Break that $27! then $20! Then $15! Then I might cover then LOL, otherwise, adding more to my short position!!!!"
"More than just momentum, the rise of this stock is based on strong fundamentals coupled with an undervalued stock price. This is a 12 billion dollar sales company with a market cap of 3 billion, leading to a sharp recovery because people were pricing in a bankruptcy due to COVID shutdowns, which has 0 chance of happening in the medium term. Other retailers are in far worse conditions and they are thriving. Yes, JWN debt levels are high, but the company is generating sufficient cash to cover its obligations, and has the growth potential, market share and a strategic positioning to use debt only to fuel growth even further."
Shorting here is much better than being a bag holder! October market crash !
"What a joke. As soon as I saw JWN fall over 12% in premarket this morning, I prepared to buy today. Nordstrom isn't going anywhere and we are returning to normalcy no matter what the fearmongering tries to imply otherwise. Vaccines are getting formal full approval. Companies are mandating employees get vaccinated or face the consequences. It's only a matter of time before majority of health insurance companies continue raising or denying coverage for anyone that's not vaccinated. You have to be a fool to not get vaccinated, but still trust the same medical professionals when you do get sick. I will continue buying JWN under 32. The Nordstrom brand isn't going anywhere. Keep buying. Keep holding."

"Worth noting that Nordstrom has consistently managed inventory well. Peers have, and had, excess amounts that they needed to move (and helped pad their numbers). This helped peers, as they could sell through, and not have to wait for all of the shipping and production delays. Manufacturing and delivery delays are most likely Nordstrom’s biggest headwind, but will get better."
More downside here! $15 target
Next quarter the analyst should compare earnings to 2015.
Shorting more up here! $15 in no time! Bag holders everywhere on this broad!
Great business but too much debt
Jeez…There is even no dead cat bounce…
"Weddings are returning, and this will bring a boost to Nordstrom. Stick to the fundamentals, which are strong. From my DD, this stock will go> 40 after the summer, which is a VERY nice upside gain at today's price."
2000 shares and I'm holding on tight! Let's get a rebound. Come on!
JWN STOCK price will come back nicely if GPS blows out its EPS tomorrow.I am buying JWN ahead of GPS earnings as JWN is so oversold today and currently sitting in theoversold condition. Be patient to those who want to see the JWN rebounds back. I am seeing JWNis at $33 at least near term or end of this week.
"when a company meets the goals that have been set for the quarter, a muted after hours move is reasonable unless there was a major run up prior to the announcement. But if a company significantly exceeds the metrics set as Nordstrom's just did, it is not reasonable to change the goal posts to a comparison to two years ago. This is just an analysts trick to be seen as relevant and to move the stock in the direction his top clients are betting on. When you add the 35% guidance which was effectively an almost 50% increase, this should have been a no brainer regarding a stock price rise. This is pure and simple manipulation."
"Still recovering from pandemic as one of the last recovery plays but as offices open back up and the holidays come, the next quarter will be great. Won’t go lower than $27 by itself but could with an overall market crash."
"Oversold. Just bought it after Cramer screaming sell, sell, sell"
I shorted more yesterday
"JWN will report same store sales early August, earnings is on 8/23 and August will be big back to school/work. Will the sp reach $55-$60 by Labor day weekend? I don't know but the coming weeks are very positive...also ships with product that had been sitting offshore are beginning to be unloaded which is great news."
Picked up 500 below 28. Unbelievable price
"JWN has 355 net stores, 100 full-line stores, 248 racks, and 7 others. With 50% of stores down at peak COVID, they did $1.7B revenue in Q2... Q2 covid was the height of hysteria and it was the least likely time for any income bracket to buy luxury products... and now, their competitors are almost entirely wiped out...In 2Q 2019, they did $3.7B, a record at the time, with 400 stores open.... so at peak covid, with 50% of stores closed, they still managed to hit 46% of their record Q2 2019 revenue...Short this stock at your own risk."
"Nordstrom e-commerce are surging, my friend working there in the logistics, they working night shifts, stock will double next earning"
"So everyone thought rates would go up and nobody can explain why they are going down except for the argument of excess liquidity in the system. The reason value stocks are down is because investors are reading it along with a soft service demand data point that the recovery has peaked and therefore the reflationary trade has peaked. Now those looking for alpha are switching back to Tech where the lower rates won’t impede growth and where any possible threat of new variants won’t hurt them. I believe they are acting rashly and not on enough data and making a trade rather than an investment, which is why I continue to be long $JWN $MAC"
I rather give my money to charity then buy this #$%$
Bottom appears to be in now. It is holding above 31.20. Shorts are trying really hard to bring it down more but they better cover soon. This isn't falling much more.
17% down just how? Isn’t this stock suppose to be medium volatility? I want to die
3 day rule works as usual…
OMG the CEO is bad. Horrible interview. Fumbling around
next stop down is $26.50
"although this seems to be taking a huge dump. I think it will end, maybe not green but 3/5 percent down as apposed to 10 down. who agrees?"
"Eric , obvious Wall Street is looking for a replacement for u and your brother to run this company. Take a look around and compare your performance over the past 5 years. It’s extremely dismal versus your peers."
"It is very hard to figure it out what is happening with this stock. Tapestry, Macys, Kohl's or any other retail store is not dropping as much as Nordstrom this last 5 business days. I checked SEC fillings and news and there is nothing wrong with this stuck for this sudden drop. I think this is a pure manipulation, or maybe a massive short accumulation. I think this stock went down because of pure speculation and not fundamentals. We are now at the quarantine price $12.91. But we are in a better economic position than in quarantine, malls are open now and there is not second shutdown coming. My forecast is that this current drop is not gonna last and it will recover quickly to $15 because there is nothing sustainable bearish to hold it. Correct me if I am wrong."
Interest rate hikes are coming. Not good for spending. Down we go 
"Many hundreds of billions of $$$ issuing to benefit child tax credit this year for many families with children between 1 day old to 17 years old would receive over $10K per year per family, more than $1400 per US adult person received in earlier this year. See how much the stimulus to the US spending and the consumer sectors were benefited the most on just $1400.00 per person. Now looking at over $10K for an average US family per year, that will even pump so much spending into the economy..... Beside that, the markets continue hitting new high in all stock exchanges that even make American families richer.... They are all enjoy wealth and spending $$$ on shopping..This is a consumable country....That will benefit JWN as well as other retail sectors..... Buy JWN on any sell off at this deep discount value...."
Yeah I am not believing this -6% in response to such a fantastic result. I think its a fake-out designed to drive the price down so they can buy tomorrow
"Prior to earnings, 17,910,000 shares shorted. Perhaps, now is 20M+ (20%) shares shorted.Reddit gangs are watching you naked shorts..."
"Don't worry, this will be green by days end. Somehow shorts are flexing there muscles. Institutions will jump in on these discounted shares. I'm a buyer at this level."
I can’t believe JWN market cap is 1/13 of Lululemon! I never even heard of lulu brand! 
"All jokes and bulls and bears aside this is a F ing joke, this drop is uncanny and proves that stock investing is legalized gambling. Just like the casino people can pull off shenanigans and steal money. I’m not hurting at all on this stock I’m up 100percent but for those going off company fundamentals and where the future is for JWN it shouldn’t have gone down this much. It’s a joke it’s a popularity contest"
Everyone bought back to school clothes. Earnings will be better than expected
"Tara GonzalezThu, September 2, 2021, 3:00 PMJennifer GarnerJennifer GarnerBauer-Griffin/GC Images Jennifer GarnerJennifer Garner is a celebrity beloved by the internet, which means she can basically do no wrong. Unless you count her skinny-jeans fandom, but whether that's wrong depends on who you ask. Gen Z queen Emma Chamberlain said on her podcast that she hopes that they never come back into style, but clearly, Garner isn't listening.Just yesterday, she was spotted in an extremely famous pair of skinny jeans by celeb-loved brand Mother. (They might look familiar because Meghan Markle is also a fan of the style and has singlehandedly caused many a sellout.) Mother's The Looker jean are known for staying true to their name: The flattering style tends to cause double-takes, which is to be expected when you're twinning with Jennifer Garner. By the way, one style of The Looker, the crop skinny, is under $100 on Nordstrom right now but likely to sell out fast.The best thing about The Looker is that there are various iterations to choose from. For a darker wash, there's the high-waist skinny, and for a more classic denim look, there's the ankle skinny. If you prefer black denim over classic blue, the frayed ankle comes in the perfect soft black — Nordstrom shoppers are obsessed. The only downside is that most pairs cost upwards of $200. But the frequency with which Jennifer Garner wears hers just goes to show Mother jeans are a timeless staple you'll wear over and over again."

"It’s not rocket science, if they do return cash to shareholders; pps will spike and we’ll find new support. Check the last earnings call. They do want to return cash and the balance sheet is looking great - per cfo"

"Interesting. With good ER and guidance and largely beat expectation, price dropped more than 20% in 2 days with major index being neutral and mild. Something doesn’t add up at all lol"
29 end of the day. 30 next week. easy recovery   
It wasn't that bad now people.
So JP Morgan dropped to underweight and 34 dollar target. If you could look into their trades you would likely find that they alerted their large investors to the wrench they were going to throw at the earnings report. One set of goals are set and then you adjust the goalposts to get to where you want to go. Sad
"REMEMBER THAT SECOND QTR IS ALWAYS THE SLOWEST QTR N JWN PULLED IT OFF NICELY WITH THE GREAT ER, the THIRD QTR WILL BE THE STRONGEST OF ALL, AND IT WILL SHOW ON NOVEMBER ER. The FACT IS THAT NORDSTROM HAS HAD GREAT ER AND JWN WILL RECOVER MOST OF YESTERDAY RIDICULOUSLY LOSS IN NEXT FEW DAYS ! BE PATIENT"
I thought Nordstrom has always been rated as more desirable stock to own than Macys. What happens here all of the sudden? What changed fundamentally?
"I would have thought that the JWN customer was in much better shape to spend than the M customer. But, perhaps Macy's has been doing more for a longer period of time to address its challenges than has JWN."
"So many bag holders, i'm not covering until JWN goes bankrupt! LOL"
how low do we go?
"OMG, shorts are so full of #$%$ Bankruptcy? So stupid, I?ve never read such a good quarter leading to the #$%$ being peddled on this board. You would think they?d cover with a 25% gain. In 2 weeks. I hope you?re (shorts) greed bites you on the #$%$"

Bag holders dilemma
welcome to criminal market! this is the most ridiculous thing that I have ever seen! how can you drop 20% with such great earnings!? this is so not right and legal!
OVERSOLD !!! JWN’s PPS WILL RECOVER SOONER THAN YOU THINK !
"JWN: There are not many retail stocks when releasing their earnings included the 2019's in their comparisons. The CEO might be HIGH when he spoke.... (Just a joke).Usually they compared the the earning for the current quarter/current year to the prior year's quarter in this case for JWN 's EPS and REVENUE on the last quarter on Wed night for the last quarter was outstanding and respectable. They also gave the whole year 2021 outlook positively...Analysts tend to follow the herds and many time they were wrong and the markets just ignored them.For example: the ACI stock price last week when sitting at 27, price was increased to 24 (that indicated the overbought) and the whole group of investors jumped in to boost it to 30...That tells you there are bad analysts out there as their firms shorteda certain stock and when the stock price was down far enough, they bought back and then followed by anupgrade. If you think the JWN stock was oversold and there are good revenue and growth are strong enough ahead of Thanksgiving and Christmas ....then be smart to get in at this deep discount because the oversold was so excessive....JWN will rebound between 33 to 35 near term......Remember there are 2 sides of the trade, one party sells, and one party part buys.... Be patient......."

"It makes a lot of senses if Amazon buys JWN at this cheap price. Both AMZN's and JWN 's corporate offices are in Seattle, Washington. You never know.!!!!!"

Why is it down?
"School reopening is only getting closer now that it's August. $35 looks to be on tap followed by moves toward $40, $45, $50+"
WILL CLOSE OVER 34 TODAY AND BABK TO 37-38 by Friday .WEIRD OVERREACTING CREATED BY BLOODY SHORTS N HEDGES. THEYRE REAL TERRORISTS IN BOAD DAYLIGHT IN THIS COUNTRY
"This is one of those pivotal moments that seperates those who truly have conviction and those who were just praying. Before you panic sell, ask yourself this, ""Do I have any better ideas?"". Are you going to throw in your money into those overvalued tech plays and hope they grow into their valuations? I wonder how does who purchased tesla at 500+ per share feel about that strategy now. Nordstrom will over deliver on earnings, not because it wasn't immune to the pandemic, because the expectations were so low. When over half of its stores were closed it generated over 1.5 billion in sales. Almost the size of its market cap. Remember when Groupon and Dillards Popped over 50%? Just sit tight and wait until this fear is over. Look around, their isnt really any other great ideas to potentially 2-3x your money. We're not big time money managers on the look out for 10% gains. We're looking for homeruns. Institutions aren't allowed to touch this stock right now because they care about their prestige and reputation more than taking a risk. Most of the are super leveraged too."
NORDSTROM FAMILY WILL TAKE OVER BACK TO PRIVATE FOR 38-40 !
"Investors have to remember covid 19 made stock dropped this low from the highs. With a vaccine or two, stock will go back up but even higher because other competitors have suffered more pain or have closed up. Stock is coming back strong move in the coming months. Don’t sell at these low teens."
I can say for a fact if this even touches $25. I’m going all in! Even though I do not want it to even go near that price.
That moment when the investors realize the quarterly report was actually pretty stellar and the stocks down 27%!
"Pay close attention to the cash burn statement from the CEO last Q: We successfully strengthened our financial flexibility by increasing liquidity, lowering inventory by more than 25 percent from last year and significantly reducing our cash burn by more than 40 percent from March into April,"" said Erik Nordstrom, chief executive officer of Nordstrom, Inc. ""We're entering the second quarter in a position of strength."

Isn’t a drop of 17% a bit of an exaggeration?
It's Criminal that longs are holding on to their shares when this JC Pennies going out of business soon!
JWN is going to crush sales estimates this quarter. Lines wrapped around the store for every Nordstrom Rack store that's recently reopened and very healthy foot traffic for the larger full-price stores. It would not surprise me that they will reinstate at least a 4% dividend next quarter which would easily send the stock to the 30's.

I have also added more shares to $ADSK, which I expect to be back above 340 also in the short term.Keep buying $JWN, $ADSK, $SOFI. Keep holding."

People are rushing out of this dropping price stocks to save some bucks. Our task is catching them when people dumps. See long term returns this legacy stocks never be wiped out or bankrupt
Nordstrom Is going to have a great earnings report. They wrote off everything last Q and bought very little inventory. They will shock with positive free cash flow. Rack e-commerce sales are going to be higher than an analyst expects. The only negative is that the upside sales surprise will come at lower margins due to marked down merchandise.
stock hit 12$ during the last covid crash. Wonder what a Delta lockdown would mean ?

"I'm not crazy about Nordstrom's CEO...they need a new one IMO. However, JWN stock is undervalued. I'm going to keep buying and holding."
I would go long if it holds $25. Valuation-wise M is a far better investment choice than JWN.

"I thought there was no way it would test the March lows. But it clearly has. I bought at around 14-15 with the thought being it was already down so far and that the retail apocalypse would not last forever. Clearly it is priced as if it is not coming back. But I am not so sure about that. Lot's of uncertainty with Covid....it has been a dream for shorts because of uncertainty: vaccine became political, election jitters, will folks even take a vaccine? Etc, etc. But I bought this because I know the company well (worked here for 4 years during college breaks) and feel that it is unique in ways that cannot be duplicated. Nordstrom has made the investment in online channels. They did cover the budget minded customer with The Rack, and they are good at this. Probably the Nordstrom family is itching to take it private at these prices. The debt is an issue, but it appears manageable. I'm thinking value investors and longs like me should just take a break, don't trade and come back in a year and see where we stand."
"Great earnings. those that are ""disappointed"", go ahead and sell, I'll be buying any ridiculous dip, see you at $50 by next earnings."
"Anyone who is trying to take profit: We were all here at $16 talking about taking profits after a big spike. Same at $20, $24 and $30. Remember their most recent quarter literally shows they have pretty much fully recovered and when the recovery continues, we will clearly see a higher stock price than pre Covid with increased store traffic."
I think we will have another opportunity to buy in the low 20s. be patient
"If Fed talks taper, expect the fall to be mega."
Never felt better about averaging up with over 19% drop after excellent earnings. Don’t forget about the dividend payout that will eventually be back

"News from List of analysts on JWN today: """"11:07 am ET August 26, 2021 (Benzinga) PrintNordstrom, Inc. (NYSE: JWN) shares have taken a dive this week after the company reported second-quarter earnings and sales that remain below pre-pandemic levels.On Tuesday, Nordstrom reported second-quarter adjusted EPS of 49 cents on revenue of $3.66 billion. Both numbers exceeded analyst expectations of 27 cents and $3.36 billion, respectively.Nordstrom revenue was up 96.7% from a year ago. Yet sales are still down about 6% from the second quarter of 2019. The company said sales from its anniversary sales event were up 1% from 2019 levels.Nordstrom reported 30% online sales growth and said digital sales now represent about 40% of total revenue.Looking ahead, Nordstrom raised its full-year revenue growth guidance from 25% to 35%, ahead of analyst estimates of 30%.Related Link: Upstart Stock Soars After Q2 Earnings: $635B Auto Lending Opportunity?Peer-Lagging Performance: Morgan Stanley analyst Kimberly Greenberger said Nordstrom’s earnings recovery is on a “clouded path.”“We see further stock price downside as revenue recovery appears protracted & cost inflation pressures EBIT margin, putting $2.40 consensus 2022e out of reach in our view,” Greenberger wrote.BMO Capital Markets analyst Simeon Siegel said “2019 casts a long shadow” for Nordstrom.“Of particular note, the anniversary sale was only 1% above FY19’s comparable sale, with ‘peer’ lagging performance at full and off price,” Siegel wrote.Credit Suisse analyst Michael Binetti said Nordstrom’s numbers represent “significant lag vs. softline peers.”“As we’ve looked ahead to the US retail re-opening, our thought was that JWN’s 2021 Anniversary Sale could be one of the biggest events in the sector, but the event was only +1% vs ‘19 (for context, URBN’s Anthropology just reported 2Q revs +15% vs ‘19),” Binetti wrote.Profitability Targets Within Reach: Telsey Advisory Group analyst Dana Teslsey said Nordstrom will have to do better to justify its valuation, which is higher than its peer group and its own historical levels.“Looking ahead, JWN can benefit from its exposure to the off-price channel, a profitable digital presence that continues to grow, and a pruned portfolio of full-line stores that can provide an alternative retail experience and accelerated operational efficiencies,” Telsey wrote.KeyBanc analyst Edward Yruma said Nordstrom’s second-quarter numbers suggest its 2022 profitability targets are well within reach.“2Q is unlikely to satisfy the near-term bulls given the continued expense pressure, but we think the Company made continued progress against its long-term initiatives, and we think further reinforced its position as the premier multi-brand premium/luxury retailer,” Yruma wrote.Nordstrom Ratings, Price Targets:Morgan Stanley has an Equal-weight rating and $36 target.BMO Capital Markets has a Market Perform rating and $28 target.Credit Suisse has a Neutral rating with a price target lowered from $39 to $34.KeyBanc has an Overweight rating and $45 target.Telsey Advisory Group has a Market Perform rating and $36 target.Latest Ratings for JWN DateFirmActionFromTo: """""
"Well it’s literally free fall, can we atleast get a bottom?"
Highly recommend listening to the CEO’s latest interview. It’s very encouraging. Here were my takeaways: -anniversary sale is off to a great start -demand is higher than they planned -fixed costs were significantly brought down during pandemic
"I want to complain, but whats done is done. If next earnings is horrible. I’m out. Even Macy’s is doing better, which says a lot already."
close > 30?
"Do you think this company will go bankruptcy?! If yes, don’t even look to this stock. If NO, you will reach a point to wish the time go back to buy at this very very low price. This company will make it throw, and if you don’t think so, go ahead and look what is going on on social media about the sale. People waiting for this company to make the sale and every one is either buying or at least visiting the stores. They are using the public figures to help marketing and best use of social media!This will fly after the earning! I just double my position on the last 2 days and if it go down, I will buy again and again!"

In 2012 Nordstrom announced a plan to hit $20B in sales by 2020... not even close.
Nordstrom stores are packed in Seattle area today especially the rack stores; yet the stock is behaving like it is going out of business. I am loading on more long call options at this ridiculous low price!
"I do see those that dropped it down so swiftly, digging among the bones left and brining this stock back up to 33 or 34 today. Unless you have to sell, hang on there for at least 35 by week's end."
I just want this to hit $40 :/ by the end of the year atleast!

Macy?s bonds have been rated ?junk? for years. Stop freaking out. There is also a trend to bring entertainment back to malls such as movie theaters. Yes the old #$%$ malls are crashing but Nordstrom is in the nice malls that are coming back. Check the statistics.
My $45 short position is very profitable

Face it bag holders. The anniversary sale was a huge bust.Nordstrom’s will lose plenty of their regulars after that debacle.Putting Nordstrom rack quality clothing on their anniversary sale was a big boo boo.
Maybe we are at the bottom - the endless selling seems to have ended
The Family is running the biz into the ground ...awful
Everyone is selling and all these optimistic bag holders are talking about rebound?
Im a buyer at 17.Just a few more days at this pace.
I just saw the interview….sigh.
"Well, it is a way more positive ride that I would hope for. I am here since summer and was buying dips under 12$. The short interest was (and probably still is) a huge player that has driven this up. Was planning to hold till January at least but I feel this could be already overbought a little bit. Yeah, I checked the ER and it was way beyond what was expected and I don't doubt company wellbeing during 2021-2022 not for a second. On the other hand, this company is more on a brick and mortar kinda side. The industry is transforming to web and Covid is a great driver for that. JWN transforming along quite good as well, but still the major segment is offline.Just take a look at GPS. It had a great run during Covid but the last ER which was not too bad make them suffer quite a bit because expectations were so high from the business that is not much into innovation. I see something like that probably could happen to JWN at some point given that the short squeeze pumps the price like crazy.Personally, I think I will still be long at least for a bit since I did very good so far and would not really disappointed in a small pullback. But if this crazy rodeo will continue for a week or so I probably will sell on a day of FDA vaccine approval which is expected to be in December.What do you guys think? What am I missing?"
"when it happens, it’ll be my favorite short squeeze of all time"
"beat earnings by 75%, raise outlook, drop 8% after hours. lol @ this market"
"I’m In 2,500 shares. Great long term hold here!!"
One more leg down. Then buy. A new CEO will be announced shortly.
Going to pick up some LEAP call options at this price.

So what will today bring? More loss or more gain.
"My wife and I shopped at Nordstrom today. While paying for our stuff, I asked the clerk how is the traffic today compared to pre-covid? She said today is about 70% compared to pre-covid but today is busier than normal, typically the traffic is about 50-60% compared to pre-covid. My wife and I go here somewhat often and I agree with her estimate about the traffic."
The ‘fundamental’ reason for the drop is that Macy’s sold 2% more same quarter 2019 while JWN sold 6% less. Let’s discuss that and what the prospects are for JWN.

"I’m a retired man, I made a mistake last week and bought 4000 shares of Nordstrom, I’m short 17000 during the last 8 days.I did not sleep a single night and this nightmare keeps going with no end in sight,I looked today at the Nordstrom and they own 63M shares, My question is why aren’t they buying shares to stop this slaughter, Sorts are turning Nordstrom to a micro cap,I just don’t see anyway out of this trap,Any honest opinions will be greatly appreciated,"
Last time I checked Yahoo Finance for JWN = Forward Dividend & Yield N/A (N/A) Nobody is holding the bag! LOL
Zero gains in 17 years. Stock at levels first reached in 2004. Eric Nordstrom needs to resign.
LOL. So oversold. G-d.
"How much is the Nordstrom brand worth? I'm guessing quite a bit. It would fall under ""Goodwill"". I don't think it's being accounted for in the value of this company, market cap or enterprise. This company is way undervalued. Also on another note, I do think that Amazon will be buying Nordstom."
Stop boasting dividend payout! Even when they do it’s just pennies to the dollar!  $15 soon
Thanks bag holders
Buy and accumulate now do not miss the opportunity..
"Get ready for hitting and close $ 30 EOD, JP Morgan building positions"
its just like drive shak DS pumped before earnings and then shorted.
They beat earnings why is the stock going down???
Back to $40s soon. Then $50s and beyond. Excited about what’s in store for this adaptive retailer.
Dead cat's boune back to $15
i think it will go down more. not done yet.
ANF 's earnings yesterday. It was outstanding and ANF stock was sold off. But it came back big today becausethe whole markets sentiment was positive.BIG LOT (BIG) earnings was released last night. Sold off around $7 at open today and now only lost 2.50.JWN was oversold in the last 2 days after an outstanding earnings and came back today. Still sitting inthe oversold territory and JWN will come back to $33.25 by earlier next week. Be patient investors andhave a nice weekend.
Several years ago Nordstrom family shopped company around and was offering around $50 / share however greedy directors wanted more.
thanks for the chais....just spent 2800 at Nordstrom

"99.99% certain JWN will start paying dividend within the next two quarters, which will send the stock to the 40ish. Keep adding on long call option at this point."
"Multiple upgrades tomorrow. Got mine at 34.90 because i knew they would sell off. Thanks weak hands, Going into next quarter with raised guidance. Too many upgrades tomorrow will make this a winner."

Here’s the report start. Looks good. And up Generated positive operating cash flow of more than $185 million in Q2; total liquidity of $1.3 billion•Improved merchandise margins and overhead cost reductions of nearly 20% drove earnings exceeding Company expectations•Sales in-line with Company expectations; reflecting temporary store closures for approximately 50% of days and Anniversary Sale shift from Q2 to Q3
"Earning top ,guidance up and fall much .Really not understand .Market fake with this government actual .Only fake ."
"Can’t go any lower, up up from here"
"Perfect storm for the shorts since last quarterly dividends of 37 cents ended with ex date of 3/29/2020. Just any mention of dividend resumption and these hedgers will fly. Incidentally it’s a free ride for them when there is no dividend, otherwise every quarter they have to cover the dividend. Management is abetting the 18% that are currently short according to the TD Ameritrade site."
Nordstrom family will attempt to take the company private again maybe! If anyone here remembers from 2017/18
"25% Extra Off on Clearance items Sale isn't very profitable, isn't it? LOL"
"WAY OVERSOLD HERE. JUST BUY N HOLD, 50% return easily in few months."
"$JWN really needs to focus on the inventory aspect. It’s a highlight of their business. Of course you can’t reach 2019 levels with all of the delays in manufacturing and shipping, unless you have excess inventory like $GPS and $M had. What’ll make this jump is reinstating the dividend and/or announcing buybacks. Which will happen at some point. $JWN is becoming a lean, mean; cash machine. After we have clarity on what the post pandemic world will look like, the sky’s the limit for JWN."
"Lol, wow. Enjoying a whiskey and cigar on a holiday weekend and open the JWN yahoo forum....The shorts are frantically posting on a holiday weekend.... you guys made a nice little win. Why are you still here? Waaaayyy bigger chance of 30 than 25 this week. Gotta know when to cash out. GL."
okay.. 25% dip on a decent report.. now u start buying.
Insane buy volume in the last six minutes before market close. This will go up high tomorrow
It just keeps going lower and lower. Wow!
Should Amazon buy Nordstrom after this haircut ? It's a Seattle thing.
Dead cat's bounce 99 percent of the time.
Solid support at $31.12. All the way back to December. This is ridiculous though..make it look like going out of business
I am calling 20%+ increase in stock price today after ER!
"$25 is crazy, honestly $30 is crazy. Everyone is talking like the earnings were bad. They were great. Just because JPM downgraded doesn’t mean things are over for the company. They have 62000 employees, it’s not going anywhere. Strong buy on the slide"
i missed the interview last night. why is everyone saying hes on drugs? was he cracked out??
How is just gonna sit here?!
All the big mass selling from funds are likely done in past couple days. This is the rock bottom price to enter folks.
"Severly oversold, market drama like always, several stocks dropped this august after good ER reports and bounced back. Free cash flow generated in Q2 is impressive (10% better than 2019!!), making the long term debt looks smaller. Low 30's price is a good area of support, time to pull the trigger!"
"You know, I’ve decided to remain positive about this. Jwn isn’t a bad company, it’s gonna stay around for a long time. Plus it’s very very stupid to compare earnings of 2019 to the recent earnings when clearly we are still in a pandemic! They are recovering, it takes time. Pretty sure the CEO knows his mistake, his human. I’ll give him a chance on the next earnings. So, I’ll just sit and wait. Eventually it will hit back to $35, even if it has to take 1-2 years. I’ll buy in tmmrw if it goes lower, it’s a steal at this price."
Read the CFO’s article. “Healthy Balance Sheet”Nordstrom is the perfect apparel retailer for the new economy. They have casual wear and high end suits/dresses for work and events. They have the perfect blend of physical and digital assets. Watch them thrive
Why is this still in the toilet? I just don’t understand how it can stay at these levels. Crooks are holding it down.
End of covid is coming soon. This is a collective effort to drive the the whole market down and make big gains (after delta subsides and kids can get vaccinated). Hold strong
