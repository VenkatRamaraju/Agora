That moment when the investors realize the quarterly report was actually pretty stellar and the stocks down 27%!
I’m surprised that the Nordstrom family isn’t accumulating at those low prices
Zero gains in 17 years. Stock at levels first reached in 2004. Eric Nordstrom needs to resign.
"when a company meets the goals that have been set for the quarter, a muted after hours move is reasonable unless there was a major run up prior to the announcement. But if a company significantly exceeds the metrics set as Nordstrom's just did, it is not reasonable to change the goal posts to a comparison to two years ago. This is just an analysts trick to be seen as relevant and to move the stock in the direction his top clients are betting on. When you add the 35% guidance which was effectively an almost 50% increase, this should have been a no brainer regarding a stock price rise. This is pure and simple manipulation."
Revenue grew 35% vs guidance 25%company lifts full your guidance
"IMHO the floor has been establishedLow 27.94 13-Week Low 27.94 1-Month Low 27.94GLTA, regardless of your position, may the best man win"
I can say for a fact if this even touches $25. I’m going all in! Even though I do not want it to even go near that price.
"GPS earnings releases and UP big.... This will lift the retail sector tomorrow.Hope JWN will rebound big tomorrow too....""""High tide lifts all boats tomorrow"""""
"News from List of analysts on JWN today: """"11:07 am ET August 26, 2021 (Benzinga) PrintNordstrom, Inc. (NYSE: JWN) shares have taken a dive this week after the company reported second-quarter earnings and sales that remain below pre-pandemic levels.On Tuesday, Nordstrom reported second-quarter adjusted EPS of 49 cents on revenue of $3.66 billion. Both numbers exceeded analyst expectations of 27 cents and $3.36 billion, respectively.Nordstrom revenue was up 96.7% from a year ago. Yet sales are still down about 6% from the second quarter of 2019. The company said sales from its anniversary sales event were up 1% from 2019 levels.Nordstrom reported 30% online sales growth and said digital sales now represent about 40% of total revenue.Looking ahead, Nordstrom raised its full-year revenue growth guidance from 25% to 35%, ahead of analyst estimates of 30%.Related Link: Upstart Stock Soars After Q2 Earnings: $635B Auto Lending Opportunity?Peer-Lagging Performance: Morgan Stanley analyst Kimberly Greenberger said Nordstrom’s earnings recovery is on a “clouded path.”“We see further stock price downside as revenue recovery appears protracted & cost inflation pressures EBIT margin, putting $2.40 consensus 2022e out of reach in our view,” Greenberger wrote.BMO Capital Markets analyst Simeon Siegel said “2019 casts a long shadow” for Nordstrom.“Of particular note, the anniversary sale was only 1% above FY19’s comparable sale, with ‘peer’ lagging performance at full and off price,” Siegel wrote.Credit Suisse analyst Michael Binetti said Nordstrom’s numbers represent “significant lag vs. softline peers.”“As we’ve looked ahead to the US retail re-opening, our thought was that JWN’s 2021 Anniversary Sale could be one of the biggest events in the sector, but the event was only +1% vs ‘19 (for context, URBN’s Anthropology just reported 2Q revs +15% vs ‘19),” Binetti wrote.Profitability Targets Within Reach: Telsey Advisory Group analyst Dana Teslsey said Nordstrom will have to do better to justify its valuation, which is higher than its peer group and its own historical levels.“Looking ahead, JWN can benefit from its exposure to the off-price channel, a profitable digital presence that continues to grow, and a pruned portfolio of full-line stores that can provide an alternative retail experience and accelerated operational efficiencies,” Telsey wrote.KeyBanc analyst Edward Yruma said Nordstrom’s second-quarter numbers suggest its 2022 profitability targets are well within reach.“2Q is unlikely to satisfy the near-term bulls given the continued expense pressure, but we think the Company made continued progress against its long-term initiatives, and we think further reinforced its position as the premier multi-brand premium/luxury retailer,” Yruma wrote.Nordstrom Ratings, Price Targets:Morgan Stanley has an Equal-weight rating and $36 target.BMO Capital Markets has a Market Perform rating and $28 target.Credit Suisse has a Neutral rating with a price target lowered from $39 to $34.KeyBanc has an Overweight rating and $45 target.Telsey Advisory Group has a Market Perform rating and $36 target.Latest Ratings for JWN DateFirmActionFromTo: """""
"Eric , obvious Wall Street is looking for a replacement for u and your brother to run this company. Take a look around and compare your performance over the past 5 years. It’s extremely dismal versus your peers."
JWN STOCK price will come back nicely if GPS blows out its EPS tomorrow.I am buying JWN ahead of GPS earnings as JWN is so oversold today and currently sitting in theoversold condition. Be patient to those who want to see the JWN rebounds back. I am seeing JWNis at $33 at least near term or end of this week.
"DAVIDSON RESEARCH FIRM ADJUSTED NORDSTROM (JWN) TO $34.Currently, JWN is sitting at 29.04 , sell off 2.00 today. Not all analysts created equal."
"This remains the easiest pure short play in the market today. And safe. With delta variant, and more variants coming (thank you Fauci), there is no catalyst for any upside whatsoever, for the foreseeable future. I continue to add to my short position. And I have a BOATLOAD of PUTS."
"At such low price I am all in on call option at 30 strike expired April 2022. I am almost certain they will beat estimate even more in next two quarters and re-instate dividend, which will pump the stock to at least $40/share"
"This is so terrible. I lost 20k~ in just 2 days. I should’ve sold it when it was at $37, I guess I’m holding till next earnings."
The ‘fundamental’ reason for the drop is that Macy’s sold 2% more same quarter 2019 while JWN sold 6% less. Let’s discuss that and what the prospects are for JWN.
"So we're living in the upside down, a company that has blowout results gets hammered because of some imaginary supply issue but MEMe stocks that have absolutely no results are up 30% someone please wake me up."

"Many hundreds of billions of $$$ issuing to benefit child tax credit this year for many families with children between 1 day old to 17 years old would receive over $10K per year per family, more than $1400 per US adult person received in earlier this year. See how much the stimulus to the US spending and the consumer sectors were benefited the most on just $1400.00 per person. Now looking at over $10K for an average US family per year, that will even pump so much spending into the economy..... Beside that, the markets continue hitting new high in all stock exchanges that even make American families richer.... They are all enjoy wealth and spending $$$ on shopping..This is a consumable country....That will benefit JWN as well as other retail sectors..... Buy JWN on any sell off at this deep discount value...."
ANF 's earnings yesterday. It was outstanding and ANF stock was sold off. But it came back big today becausethe whole markets sentiment was positive.BIG LOT (BIG) earnings was released last night. Sold off around $7 at open today and now only lost 2.50.JWN was oversold in the last 2 days after an outstanding earnings and came back today. Still sitting inthe oversold territory and JWN will come back to $33.25 by earlier next week. Be patient investors andhave a nice weekend.
"I've been very bullish on $AFRM and $SOFI for a few months as they both have been gaining market share at various websites I'd visit. So the $AMZN partnership announcement on Friday was no surprise. I sold my $AFRM over $100 this morning for over 45% gain and moving it to $SOFI and adding even more shares of $JWN under 29....Nordstrom will be back above 38 in the short term in no time. I have also added more shares to $ADSK, which I expect to be back above 340 also in the short term.Keep buying $JWN, $ADSK, $SOFI. Keep holding."
"Yikes! That's the biggest drop I've seen in a while. I still have Nordstrom on my watchlist from when I was investor, and you guys have my sympathies. I'm happy I sold out during the short squeeze at $45 a few months ago. I posted my concerns at the time, and it seems those mostly came true in the short-term, taking a brief look over the earnings report. I still think this is a decent business, but they took on far too much debt when times were good. It will be a slow process getting out from under that and the big interest expenses, but one positive note I saw is they have successfully reduced their interest expenses from 177M in the first half of 2020 to $84M in first half of 2021. Good to see the business is improving and then smoothly paying that debt down with free cash flow even if profit margins are thin and sales a bit slower than some rivals! They seem to be doing ok to me if that is any encouragement to the longs that have stuck it out here! :)"
"Revenue didn’t exceed 2019 because of the following. All of which can be improved upon. -their urban store locations are yet to recover -traffic is better but not fully back -work attire and similar categories yet to recover -supply chain constraints in process to be figured out But while they didn’t take full advantage of the top line, they:- cut significant fixed costs permanently -brought gross margin flat to 2019-paid down debt -achieved healthy free cash flow -signaled dividend by EOY-grew digital customer (after 5 year investment)-continued data driven integration for inventory and merchandising -partnered with ASOS to attract young customersThey clearly have momentum in revenue. They noted sequential growth into August. Eric said they are not satisfied with the pace of growth and will be taking a lot of lessons from the anniversary sale into the holiday sales. Hopefully the environment will be better by then as well."
"The CEO is being interviewed on CNBC, he comes across passive and self doubting, does not project confidence at all...Just an observation."
I thought Nordstrom has always been rated as more desirable stock to own than Macys. What happens here all of the sudden? What changed fundamentally?
"when it happens, it’ll be my favorite short squeeze of all time"
It's a fabulous store. I bought 200 shares today at $28.00 and may bring that up to 500 shares by the end of the year.
okay.. 25% dip on a decent report.. now u start buying.
"Can’t go lower, Buy more"
GREAT BARGAIN PRICE HERE. IM SO THANKFUL FOR BEAUTIFUL OPPORTUNITY. 36-38 in a week max !
"After the cnbc interview, Eric Nordstrom will be fired,"
"It’s a problem when you know Macy’s and Gap are doing way better, not wanting to diss the other companies but JWN should be doing better. But it ain’t. Wonder what’s up."
"Wow, beat estimates by like 10-20 cents, but people are inclined to sell? If this isn’t manipulation then idk what is anymore"
Keep buying under 30 while you can. Consumers want luxury goods and demand has continued for months. I said it before: Nordstrom is not going anywhere. Keep buying. Keep holding.
OVERSOLD !!! JWN’s PPS WILL RECOVER SOONER THAN YOU THINK !
"JWN: There are not many retail stocks when releasing their earnings included the 2019's in their comparisons. The CEO might be HIGH when he spoke.... (Just a joke).Usually they compared the the earning for the current quarter/current year to the prior year's quarter in this case for JWN 's EPS and REVENUE on the last quarter on Wed night for the last quarter was outstanding and respectable. They also gave the whole year 2021 outlook positively...Analysts tend to follow the herds and many time they were wrong and the markets just ignored them.For example: the ACI stock price last week when sitting at 27, price was increased to 24 (that indicated the overbought) and the whole group of investors jumped in to boost it to 30...That tells you there are bad analysts out there as their firms shorteda certain stock and when the stock price was down far enough, they bought back and then followed by anupgrade. If you think the JWN stock was oversold and there are good revenue and growth are strong enough ahead of Thanksgiving and Christmas ....then be smart to get in at this deep discount because the oversold was so excessive....JWN will rebound between 33 to 35 near term......Remember there are 2 sides of the trade, one party sells, and one party part buys.... Be patient......."
"Interesting. With good ER and guidance and largely beat expectation, price dropped more than 20% in 2 days with major index being neutral and mild. Something doesn’t add up at all lol"
Some class C analysts complaint about JWN earnings saying their analysis on the JWN earning was soft compared to its peers. What a laughing stock!!!. They losttheir faces as their combined consensus covering JWN stock per share was 100% lower what JWN earnings per share actual. They should have admitted that they missed it but go around complaining to justify their calls . JWN will deliver much more in the next quarter....
"Bought 2k shares at $32.24 this morning,I hope it will get better"
Yeah I am not believing this -6% in response to such a fantastic result. I think its a fake-out designed to drive the price down so they can buy tomorrow
