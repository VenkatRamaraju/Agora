Probably one of the most underrated stocks right now. Expecting earnings to do well. Expect $15 before earnings. A good earnings report should see $17.
"This remains the easiest pure short play in the market today. And safe. With delta variant, and more variants coming (thank you Fauci), there is no catalyst for any upside whatsoever, for the foreseeable future. I continue to add to my short position. And I have a BOATLOAD of PUTS."
One more leg down. Then buy. A new CEO will be announced shortly.
The stock price falling like this and the stores making tons of sales are working in opposite directions. This is a buy and buy some more and hold stock. Not sure exactly how high the upside is but I do know it is much higher than $13.30 in my humble opinion.
Many bag holders everywhere
"It is very hard to figure it out what is happening with this stock. Tapestry, Macys, Kohl's or any other retail store is not dropping as much as Nordstrom this last 5 business days. I checked SEC fillings and news and there is nothing wrong with this stuck for this sudden drop. I think this is a pure manipulation, or maybe a massive short accumulation. I think this stock went down because of pure speculation and not fundamentals. We are now at the quarantine price $12.91. But we are in a better economic position than in quarantine, malls are open now and there is not second shutdown coming. My forecast is that this current drop is not gonna last and it will recover quickly to $15 because there is nothing sustainable bearish to hold it. Correct me if I am wrong."
"How much is the Nordstrom brand worth? I'm guessing quite a bit. It would fall under ""Goodwill"". I don't think it's being accounted for in the value of this company, market cap or enterprise. This company is way undervalued. Also on another note, I do think that Amazon will be buying Nordstom."
"i am still buying at these levels; and i feel confident the trend for this stock will continue. For those of you asking, I was in Nordstrom in new york this past Saturday, and there were many people in the store. In addition to this I ordered from Nordstrom Rack (online) during the weekend"
"My take: relative to the prevailing market, we’re doing just fine. So, when the market rebounds, it may very well take JWN up with it. This seems like a fair (relative) bottom. However, more blood in the major indices could mean we go lower. Bad time to sell, great time to buy. I would be if I didn’t already own a lot."
"Stores are doing fine maybe average, e-commerce is absolutely booming and their anniversary sale which is big which is normally apart of the previous quarter is in this upcoming quarter. This is going to be a big beat!"
"I hear that all the time...Amazon is great for household goods or even random hardware...everything else is cheap Chinese electronics and knock-offs. When I think about getting a nice pair of jeans or coat, I certainly don’t think of amazon."
Why is it down?
Here’s the report start. Looks good. And up Generated positive operating cash flow of more than $185 million in Q2; total liquidity of $1.3 billion•Improved merchandise margins and overhead cost reductions of nearly 20% drove earnings exceeding Company expectations•Sales in-line with Company expectations; reflecting temporary store closures for approximately 50% of days and Anniversary Sale shift from Q2 to Q3
"Same price like a week ago now, swingers bought for earning pop and got disappointed so it dropped same gain"
"It’s up a 100% from last year, this has room to fall"
"NORDSTROM FAMILY WILL TAKE THE WHOLE OPERATION TO PRIVATE, price tag 45 !?"
Keep selling me at these levels! I am shorting more and more!
"The CEO is being interviewed on CNBC, he comes across passive and self doubting, does not project confidence at all...Just an observation."
"Really excited about this one. The last two I have been this excited on was Chipotle at $275 and Tesla at $250 (Check my chat history). I actually sold some tesla and loaded up on the stock and calls (Earnings, Jan 2022 and Jan 2023). I expect them to be able to pay down the debt they needed to tap for Covid in 2021 and by 2022 you'll have a $1.50 + in dividend income, throw the historical yield of 3.5% on it and you have a 40-45 stock again. Do a channel check and website traffic and do the math on anniversary sale and store reopening and consider the wild cards of going private again and that the family owns over 30% of the company and you have insights that wall street hasn't caught on to... yet..."
DDS is a better stock to own in retail indistry. Why you all focus on this stock? DDS reported way better earnings .
next stop down is $26.50
Interest rate hikes are coming. Not good for spending. Down we go 
"You know, I’ve decided to remain positive about this. Jwn isn’t a bad company, it’s gonna stay around for a long time. Plus it’s very very stupid to compare earnings of 2019 to the recent earnings when clearly we are still in a pandemic! They are recovering, it takes time. Pretty sure the CEO knows his mistake, his human. I’ll give him a chance on the next earnings. So, I’ll just sit and wait. Eventually it will hit back to $35, even if it has to take 1-2 years. I’ll buy in tmmrw if it goes lower, it’s a steal at this price."
"20% Increased Digital sale Ecom Growth, 50% increased online traffic. $185 Million positive operating cash flow, big chunk of which used to pay down debt. Decent sized cash position. $1.3 billion in liquidity . They decreased inventory 25% and have a clean inventory ready to go for next quarter. Overall I like their response to the pandemic and if price drops will be buying the dip"
Bottom appears to be in now. It is holding above 31.20. Shorts are trying really hard to bring it down more but they better cover soon. This isn't falling much more.
"I've been very bullish on $AFRM and $SOFI for a few months as they both have been gaining market share at various websites I'd visit. So the $AMZN partnership announcement on Friday was no surprise. I sold my $AFRM over $100 this morning for over 45% gain and moving it to $SOFI and adding even more shares of $JWN under 29....Nordstrom will be back above 38 in the short term in no time. I have also added more shares to $ADSK, which I expect to be back above 340 also in the short term.Keep buying $JWN, $ADSK, $SOFI. Keep holding."
"Such a great earnings and walstreet compare it to the period of 2019. What a rigged system. Which company is doing better than pandamic, now?"
KABOOM! See you at $25 this week
Just gonna close my phone and look at this tmmrw. It’s just after hours
@Piddie: JWN market cap is 4.5B. No income tax in WA. Amazon might look at JWN right now....

"WAY OVERSOLD HERE. JUST BUY N HOLD, 50% return easily in few months."
IM SO THANKFUL TO GET A BIG CHUNK OF CHEAP SHARES TODAY. STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT JWN WILL RECOVER TO UPPER 40 in 6 weeks. Be patient !!!
29 end of the day. 30 next week. easy recovery   
They beat earnings why is the stock going down???
okay.. 25% dip on a decent report.. now u start buying.
"My wife and I shopped at Nordstrom today. While paying for our stuff, I asked the clerk how is the traffic today compared to pre-covid? She said today is about 70% compared to pre-covid but today is busier than normal, typically the traffic is about 50-60% compared to pre-covid. My wife and I go here somewhat often and I agree with her estimate about the traffic."
Could soon become the next long attack victim of WSB.
"I’ve been day trading for years and I’m so glad I finally found (http://Rightpicker.com). They’re pre-market watchlists cover all the latest market-moving news, and they don’t beat you down with tons of ads. Highly recommend!"
When are you people going to realize Bloomingdale's is destroying Nordstrom's. Bloomingdale's part of Macy's as well as Blue Mercury and now huge infusion into the toy business with Toys r us
"I am long with 1 - 2 year timeline. No risk, no glory. I think this is not in favor stock sector, hence patience is a virtue."
Multiple insiders dumped stock at $40 two days ago. Not a confidence builder for a company sale or price growth.
Keep buying under 30 while you can. Consumers want luxury goods and demand has continued for months. I said it before: Nordstrom is not going anywhere. Keep buying. Keep holding.
I would go long if it holds $25. Valuation-wise M is a far better investment choice than JWN.
Kabooom!

cooooover!
$15 base
"Why is this lagging its competitors? Not invested yet, but this seems compelling. Partially family-owned, pricing power due to luxury category, REAL ESTATE plus LAND, pent up demand, digital channels, loyal customer base, out-of-favor sector, cost cutting and downsizing ahead, local stores, great brand. What am I missing here?"
Going to be bought out?
"Found the shortie! @NSXWouldn't want to be ya - JWN will eventually recover, I'll be patient with my shares @ $15"
Next quarter the analyst should compare earnings to 2015.
DDS is 30% shorted and so far it's popped 44% in one day after some good news. JWN is 38% shorted! Imagine what it will do after some good news! It's a no brainer to buy it at these levels and wait for it to double within 3-6 months.

JWN STOCK price will come back nicely if GPS blows out its EPS tomorrow.I am buying JWN ahead of GPS earnings as JWN is so oversold today and currently sitting in theoversold condition. Be patient to those who want to see the JWN rebounds back. I am seeing JWNis at $33 at least near term or end of this week.
this is a $20 stock
Just spent $375 at Nordstrom. Early Christmas gifts. Thanks (JWN) Holding until $40
"when a company meets the goals that have been set for the quarter, a muted after hours move is reasonable unless there was a major run up prior to the announcement. But if a company significantly exceeds the metrics set as Nordstrom's just did, it is not reasonable to change the goal posts to a comparison to two years ago. This is just an analysts trick to be seen as relevant and to move the stock in the direction his top clients are betting on. When you add the 35% guidance which was effectively an almost 50% increase, this should have been a no brainer regarding a stock price rise. This is pure and simple manipulation."
This is a winner winner chicken dinner Check my history on message board ERI winnerOSTK winnerAPRN winner JWN my next winner RUTH my next winner
"JWN: There are not many retail stocks when releasing their earnings included the 2019's in their comparisons. The CEO might be HIGH when he spoke.... (Just a joke).Usually they compared the the earning for the current quarter/current year to the prior year's quarter in this case for JWN 's EPS and REVENUE on the last quarter on Wed night for the last quarter was outstanding and respectable. They also gave the whole year 2021 outlook positively...Analysts tend to follow the herds and many time they were wrong and the markets just ignored them.For example: the ACI stock price last week when sitting at 27, price was increased to 24 (that indicated the overbought) and the whole group of investors jumped in to boost it to 30...That tells you there are bad analysts out there as their firms shorteda certain stock and when the stock price was down far enough, they bought back and then followed by anupgrade. If you think the JWN stock was oversold and there are good revenue and growth are strong enough ahead of Thanksgiving and Christmas ....then be smart to get in at this deep discount because the oversold was so excessive....JWN will rebound between 33 to 35 near term......Remember there are 2 sides of the trade, one party sells, and one party part buys.... Be patient......."
Sub $30 end of week.
ALMOST PERFECT ER AND DROPPING 18% !? KIDDING ME ? Loading up BOTH HANDS HERE. WILL RECOVER ALL NEXT COUPLE DAYS.
"Multiple upgrades tomorrow. Got mine at 34.90 because i knew they would sell off. Thanks weak hands, Going into next quarter with raised guidance. Too many upgrades tomorrow will make this a winner."
I thought Nordstrom has always been rated as more desirable stock to own than Macys. What happens here all of the sudden? What changed fundamentally?
I'm happy if it drops a dollar a day for 2 weeks back to $15
THIS IS AHEAD FAKE!. Red close. The drop is not over yet. I promise.
welcome to criminal market! this is the most ridiculous thing that I have ever seen! how can you drop 20% with such great earnings!? this is so not right and legal!
"Nepotism never works case in point Viacom, Nordstrom, JC Penny, Sears and the list goes on. Maybe time to change the name from founding name sake to something the new crowd like “Robinhood” could get behind."
"More than just momentum, the rise of this stock is based on strong fundamentals coupled with an undervalued stock price. This is a 12 billion dollar sales company with a market cap of 3 billion, leading to a sharp recovery because people were pricing in a bankruptcy due to COVID shutdowns, which has 0 chance of happening in the medium term. Other retailers are in far worse conditions and they are thriving. Yes, JWN debt levels are high, but the company is generating sufficient cash to cover its obligations, and has the growth potential, market share and a strategic positioning to use debt only to fuel growth even further."
"$JWN is a nearly perfect PE takeover target or family buyback/buyout at these levels. So many great opportunities to restructure away from the scrutiny of public markets. Very strong revenues, defensible market positions, solid e-commerce platform, diversity of business lines, excellent brand equity. Trades at 1/10th of $LULU and should be trading at a comparable multiple. Shorts are going to get annihilated."
"You can see the shorts starting to get a little worried, on peak fear, JWN refuses to go any lower than 12. The floor is getting hardened boys, hold the line, get ready to advance"
"Games that people play in after hours and pre-market, it was up almost two bucks and within five minutes it was down two bucks now getting ready to go green again."
Bag holders
The Family is running the biz into the ground ...awful
"This is way ahead of itself at the moment, I think. I have been an optimist on this stock, thinking it would reach 20 sometime next year. Now it's gone parabolic, mostly on the strength of the Robinhood types buying call options. This has been profitable for me, but I expect that it will retreat before Friday's expiration. Therefore I will unload most of the position in my IRA before then. I will hold the position in my taxable accounts."
"Big money playing with the consumer discretionary sector, driving prices as low as they can before the major uptick that will inevitable happen as consumers have hoarded over 12.5 Trillion dollars in excess savings since April, that is called huge pent up demand coming for Christmas. People are depressed and tired of being sequestered in shelter in place rules. Once the election is over and the games start to subside regardless of who wins, the flood gates will open and this Christmas season will be historic in terms of sales and profits for those who have survived the Draconian economic shutdowns. My only concern in regards to Nordstrom which may actually be a bonus is that unlike some of their peers they loaded up on inventory I assume for their annual sale, though that may be problematic if they didn't chose proper designs, then they will have to push a lot of ""obsolete"" stock through the outlet stores. This price was actually a bit too good to pass, bought at 11.77 so pretty pleased and think that 40 by EOY is possible."
"although this seems to be taking a huge dump. I think it will end, maybe not green but 3/5 percent down as apposed to 10 down. who agrees?"
"Whoever sold it this low will regret so much in the coming days. When earning comes out, this will be 17 a pop."
close > 30?
Way over bought! Save your money for food and gas
OVERSOLD !!! JWN’s PPS WILL RECOVER SOONER THAN YOU THINK !
"I do see those that dropped it down so swiftly, digging among the bones left and brining this stock back up to 33 or 34 today. Unless you have to sell, hang on there for at least 35 by week's end."
JWN will be GREEN BIG TOMORROW..... don't worry about the after hours!
"Wonder what we will all be thinking in 12 months when there is a vaccine, can go out without a mask, hug friends, and JWN trades in the 30s"
"This is going to require patience and watching it daily is an exercise in frustration. The company is stable, retail is weak, and it will take another 1-2 months to get the price up $1-$2 from here. Positive news about a vaccine may quicken that time frame. This is a long term hold, not a trading stock, but the current price is an opportunity. One man's opinion."
It just keeps going lower and lower. Wow!
Beat our miss?
Nordstrom is down 7.51% to 28.80
"How come JWN have more believers than DDS? DDS’ books are much better than JWN. Check them out, get in before they’re release their earning on Aug 12th! EPS is way higher"
Bloomingdales eating Nordstrom's lunch and spitting it out...high end shoppers love Bloomingdales
It's going to happen fast. I dont know when but it will. Profit taking on overbought tech stocks and taking the proceeds to ride the recovery wave of companies like JWN. Don't blink or you will miss it
Im a buyer at 17
NORDSTROM FAMILY! TAKE YOUR BELOVED STORES TO PRIVATE NOW !!!!
Shorts have total control over this stock. Unbelievable
I TRIPLED my short position based on CEO interview. His days are numbered.
Solid support at $31.12. All the way back to December. This is ridiculous though..make it look like going out of business
Money is cheapSomeone probably getting back together with the family to buyout at 20-25Wouldn’t be surprised Online doing tremendous as wel as a resurgence of the rackCanada one example of lines out the doorOnly 100 big stores in portfolio and that could exit another 10 or more overtime and the smaller concept stores a new wave of growth
Thanks bag holders
"At such low price I am all in on call option at 30 strike expired April 2022. I am almost certain they will beat estimate even more in next two quarters and re-instate dividend, which will pump the stock to at least $40/share"
"Well, it is a way more positive ride that I would hope for. I am here since summer and was buying dips under 12$. The short interest was (and probably still is) a huge player that has driven this up. Was planning to hold till January at least but I feel this could be already overbought a little bit. Yeah, I checked the ER and it was way beyond what was expected and I don't doubt company wellbeing during 2021-2022 not for a second. On the other hand, this company is more on a brick and mortar kinda side. The industry is transforming to web and Covid is a great driver for that. JWN transforming along quite good as well, but still the major segment is offline.Just take a look at GPS. It had a great run during Covid but the last ER which was not too bad make them suffer quite a bit because expectations were so high from the business that is not much into innovation. I see something like that probably could happen to JWN at some point given that the short squeeze pumps the price like crazy.Personally, I think I will still be long at least for a bit since I did very good so far and would not really disappointed in a small pullback. But if this crazy rodeo will continue for a week or so I probably will sell on a day of FDA vaccine approval which is expected to be in December.What do you guys think? What am I missing?"
"The idea that Nordstrom wants to go private makes a lot more sense how this drop is possible. Mentioning 2019 was stupid with the current positive numbers but not so stupid if they want it down. Also Nordstrom most likely has enough pull at JP Morgan to get that same day downgrade. That being said, what about the shareholders? I’m feeling violated in the back end and really don’t appreciate the Nordstrom plan."
Attention Nordstrom Bag-Holders:Counselors will be available after hours for support followed by punch and pie.
I promise you $25 this week. See ya!
"I’m so annoyed, I don’t understand why we have been in the red for the past week without any news. Either it’s getting shorted because of low volume. Or everyone is moving into the meme stock craze"
"IMHO the floor has been establishedLow 27.94 13-Week Low 27.94 1-Month Low 27.94GLTA, regardless of your position, may the best man win"
"General thoughts - Expect resistance around 14.50 - 15.00, as we saw twice in the past few days. If you are long, don't be discouraged. If you are looking to get in, wait until it closes above 15 for an easier ride. Good earnings should help, bad earnings will keep it under 14. Stay long, or it's just a trade under 14.5. Still a good long term prospect at any price around here."
"Buying more today. Here’s why: Had a very positive online experience with Nordstrom. Ordered a pair of dress pants that arrived in 2 days and fit perfectly. I trust Nordstrom to sell high quality clothing and the box came with a free return label if I wasn’t satisfied. I do think they can compete against Amazon, and the other etailers don’t come close in terms of quality and customer service. There are still plenty of consumers that want to dress nicely and transact online. JWN is well positioned in this space."
"So many bag holders, i'm not covering until JWN goes bankrupt! LOL"
My $45 short position is very profitable
"Nordstrom e-commerce are surging, my friend working there in the logistics, they working night shifts, stock will double next earning"
"Seems to be resistance at $62, retail sector has had a great 2 weeks, many retailers up 15-20% without a significant pullback, usually not sustainable. With the next sector rotation into the next group of ""hot stocks"", money will roll out of the high flying retailers and into those. I'm not expecting JWN to collapse, but in the next sector rotation or market pullback, I would think a 5-10% downturn would be normal. Stocks usually go back and retest their recent lows which they took off from, or at least somewhat of a retracement. We'll see."
https://discord.gg/KPAVED3
what kind of market manipulating shenanigans is going on here???? with almost four times the normal volume the price is falling or static????????
"This is one of those pivotal moments that seperates those who truly have conviction and those who were just praying. Before you panic sell, ask yourself this, ""Do I have any better ideas?"". Are you going to throw in your money into those overvalued tech plays and hope they grow into their valuations? I wonder how does who purchased tesla at 500+ per share feel about that strategy now. Nordstrom will over deliver on earnings, not because it wasn't immune to the pandemic, because the expectations were so low. When over half of its stores were closed it generated over 1.5 billion in sales. Almost the size of its market cap. Remember when Groupon and Dillards Popped over 50%? Just sit tight and wait until this fear is over. Look around, their isnt really any other great ideas to potentially 2-3x your money. We're not big time money managers on the look out for 10% gains. We're looking for homeruns. Institutions aren't allowed to touch this stock right now because they care about their prestige and reputation more than taking a risk. Most of the are super leveraged too."

"Q2 2021 Nordstrom Earnings Conference CallAug 24, 2021 at 4:45 PM EDT"
I love this stock! My PUTS are paying for a new truck. My short position is reserved for a new workshop.
"AMZN wont buy JWN. 'member when everyone on the M board thought AMZN would buy M? LOL When you get to a point where you are hoping the company is bought by AMZN, you've reached the end."
"I’ll get back in, in the mid $20s"
Back to $40s soon. Then $50s and beyond. Excited about what’s in store for this adaptive retailer.
How is just gonna sit here?!
"I would have thought that the JWN customer was in much better shape to spend than the M customer. But, perhaps Macy's has been doing more for a longer period of time to address its challenges than has JWN."
A lot of opportunity with this stock. Downside protection with amazon willing to buy the company the worst of Covid and store closures behind us. Lots of upside with the Nordstroms family likely wanting to take it private again at a much cheaper price than last time and a record anniversary sales figures and return to profitability. This is easily a 30-45 stock by early 2022 and much much safer than tech. Great stock for troubled times in the valuation world.
"Hey gang! Not sure who is still around from when I started posting 2 years ago and following Nordstrom, but congrats to everyone who invested with me significantly in 2020 and reaped the huge rewards! I finally decided to take my profits today while the stock was breaking $45 and I'm out for the foreseeable future. This has been a fantastic recovery stock with enormous gains for everyone that recognized just how undervalued it was in the teens when shorts were crushing it more than its sector at 60% short interest. Fast forward to today and after returning to profitability and several short squeezes later, short interest is nearly under 10%, analyst projections and management projections are solidly positive, and Nordstrom seems on the recovery trend. Don't get me wrong, I'm not selling out because I don't believe in the company. Nordstrom has good management, a solid game plan, and I'm sure they will survive and do well, but given their high levels of debt, saturated and competitive market, and low expected growth rate going forward, I think we are getting well past what I would consider current fair value. That doesn't mean we won't go higher though haha, especially with the ongoing short squeeze that has been rocking retail! I'm moving on to other investments though and wanted to leave one last note! I expect the company eventually will be worth more than $45 in the long run as they pay down debt and execute on their growth initiatives, so not a terrible hold, and who knows, they may eventually become a big online brand abroad and find better growth avenues, but with management currently projecting low-digit yearly growth going forward, and their struggle to continue growing their market the past few years, I mainly considered Nordstrom just a great recovery stock and that is now complete. GLTA!"
"I’m glad I covered my short position at $14 and initiated a long position right after the pop up! Trying to be a swing trader is hard. Right now, the technical line for JWN looks perfect."
I shorted more yesterday
So JP Morgan dropped to underweight and 34 dollar target. If you could look into their trades you would likely find that they alerted their large investors to the wrench they were going to throw at the earnings report. One set of goals are set and then you adjust the goalposts to get to where you want to go. Sad
"Severly oversold, market drama like always, several stocks dropped this august after good ER reports and bounced back. Free cash flow generated in Q2 is impressive (10% better than 2019!!), making the long term debt looks smaller. Low 30's price is a good area of support, time to pull the trigger!"
JWN CEO needs to step aside. Listened to him on CNBC. He's no salesman. Sounds like a quiet engineer that believes he has years to fix his problems. Can't believe he's at the helm. I could hear money managers screaming as he was talking. Buy at $26 before they announce his departures.
"Earning top ,guidance up and fall much .Really not understand .Market fake with this government actual .Only fake ."
Big news coming. Hold tight
Need like a BBBY CEO to turn around the mindset at this company.
"Anyone who is trying to take profit: We were all here at $16 talking about taking profits after a big spike. Same at $20, $24 and $30. Remember their most recent quarter literally shows they have pretty much fully recovered and when the recovery continues, we will clearly see a higher stock price than pre Covid with increased store traffic."
"Revenue didn’t exceed 2019 because of the following. All of which can be improved upon. -their urban store locations are yet to recover -traffic is better but not fully back -work attire and similar categories yet to recover -supply chain constraints in process to be figured out But while they didn’t take full advantage of the top line, they:- cut significant fixed costs permanently -brought gross margin flat to 2019-paid down debt -achieved healthy free cash flow -signaled dividend by EOY-grew digital customer (after 5 year investment)-continued data driven integration for inventory and merchandising -partnered with ASOS to attract young customersThey clearly have momentum in revenue. They noted sequential growth into August. Eric said they are not satisfied with the pace of growth and will be taking a lot of lessons from the anniversary sale into the holiday sales. Hopefully the environment will be better by then as well."
Dead cat's yet again oh DEAR
"This is so terrible. I lost 20k~ in just 2 days. I should’ve sold it when it was at $37, I guess I’m holding till next earnings."
"$25 is crazy, honestly $30 is crazy. Everyone is talking like the earnings were bad. They were great. Just because JPM downgraded doesn’t mean things are over for the company. They have 62000 employees, it’s not going anywhere. Strong buy on the slide"
KABOOM!
I need your advice. I believe that the stock market is currently a bubble waiting to pop. Should I sell some of my Nordstrom stocks and leave the others to get to $40? Thank you for your help.
Nordstrom is one of the last of its kind. I bought today for a one year + hold.
"Nordstrom is the best positioned retailer IMO. Has the cash to whether the storm, will gain customers from Nieman, 40% of sales are online, and caters to the higher end customer less affected by the downturn."
https://discord.gg/Cn3qwNge
"I agree this can go $70 soon.With the virus fading, people are storming stores like never before.We see this behavior all around the globe.Interest rates are still low, much lower than pre-covid, that alone sends share prices higher.Nordstrom reduced fat, became more agile and significantly strengthen its online capabilities.glta, let's see new record high."
I just saw the interview….sigh.
"I thought there was no way it would test the March lows. But it clearly has. I bought at around 14-15 with the thought being it was already down so far and that the retail apocalypse would not last forever. Clearly it is priced as if it is not coming back. But I am not so sure about that. Lot's of uncertainty with Covid....it has been a dream for shorts because of uncertainty: vaccine became political, election jitters, will folks even take a vaccine? Etc, etc. But I bought this because I know the company well (worked here for 4 years during college breaks) and feel that it is unique in ways that cannot be duplicated. Nordstrom has made the investment in online channels. They did cover the budget minded customer with The Rack, and they are good at this. Probably the Nordstrom family is itching to take it private at these prices. The debt is an issue, but it appears manageable. I'm thinking value investors and longs like me should just take a break, don't trade and come back in a year and see where we stand."
"Increasing online inventory from 300,000 items to 1.5 million items over the next few years "
Great business but too much debt
"Wow, I just can't believe that the market served up such a juicy opportunity to profit in Nordstrom twice in 2 years. This is the second time that shorts have driven Nordstrom way down to a great present value on this ""physical retail is dead"" premise and I've profited massively both times ($25-->$42 last year). Thank you so much for your donations guys! Focus on fundamentals next time rather than the stock price if you want to hold onto your money. And don't buy the garbage articles that hedge funds pump out to get you to do what they want so they can profit. Herd behavior works until the big funds pull the rug out from under you... I guarantee you they closed any short positions they had and loaded up under $14.50 just like me while they bashed Nordstrom earlier this year. Analysts have been projecting a Nordstrom recovery starting this quarter for months, and the positive catalysts and retail sales signs I pointed to yesterday were common knowledge, even as short interest soared up to 45% of float while Nordstrom traded to another 10Y low. Easiest money I've ever made. Thanks for the 60%+ profit and hopefully you learned something about doing your own research, hedging your positions, and not using others money to gamble. Nordstrom will likely have many more small pullbacks, but the trend is clearly up, and the market now appears convinced by the rash of recent positive beats and reports (TJ max killed it this morning) that physical clothing retailers did very well. Fair value for JWN is likely upwards of $25, but I will reevaluate after the earnings and see where it settles after the next few pullbacks to decide my sell points. I expect a decent ER given all the positive catalysts."

"Interesting to see this be punished more than even Macy's or Kohls past 2 days. Their analyst outlook and downtrend over the past few years is not shared by Nordstrom at all. This seems to be a sector selloff with no specific bearing on Nordstrom's performance (which has been positive from my analysis). I have a few comments for those that care for healthy discussion of the pros/cons of Nordstrom as an investment: First, regardless of what you as an individual think of Nordstrom, their recent track record has been impressive pre-COVID. Nordstrom's online sales and offerings continue to grow every quarter and were at records last quarter even with the stores closed...and they are even offering 1-day delivery in some locations, with fast shipping in all locations and free returns. I think they are pretty well-positioned against similar rivals. I have been impressed with the moves Nordstrom has been making and have been watching them a while. They are transitioning well into the new paradigm of online shopping and have a unique niche. Unlike many fading mall giants, their record sales years were 2018-2019, so they are still at their peak in revenue and have a healthy and loyal shopping base from the metrics. And unlike Macy's, etc. they actually built up inventory last quarter, clearly expecting a decent anniversary sale event this quarter. Anyway, even if you don't agree with me, perhaps you will agree with the analysts. Analyst consensus on Nordstrom's near-term outlook is much more positive than on peers. The consensus says that this quarter will be break-even (and a few weeks ago they were predicting solid profit this quarter, though a few recently lowered estimates). This is a feat they aren't predicting for the other retailers, which are expected to keep bleeding money. They are also predicting a return to profitability in the Christmas quarter and good profitable results for next year. One final note for those that believe this hype about all physical retail dying: The articles you read are exaggerating. They profit off of the predictable short waves that have happened for months. The reality, however, is that only some kinds of physical retail work well online. Grocery stores are not going along with many other items. Walmart, Target, Costco, etc. are breaking records actually. The same is true of clothing and fashion industries in a sense. Online shopping is unlikely to dominate the market completely unless you are talking about certain garment segments like cheap offrand and one-size-fits-all. The issue is that every brand has their unique sizing and even if something is your ""size"" it is hard to tell if something will fit or you will like it when buying online unless you've worn that brand before. Frequently things have to be returned and the experience can be frustrating. Go out and read the surveys and talk to people. A fair number (particularly the wealthier shoppers) still prefer to skip that hassle and be serviced and try new things on before buying. Nordstrom has been making moves to give their stores services that also can't be offered online easily such as fitting, tailoring, etc. to give even more incentive to utilize their physical stores. And it is working. They have a loyal customer base that is plain from the stats they publish. And for those that still want to shop from home...Nordstrom now offers the same 1-2 day shipping that amazon does, free returns, and is a popular brand. They will no doubt survive just fine. Don't believe the hype that amazon can take over the fashion industry. It just isn't true. Many people despise amazon's marketplace for garments. As for why the market is hating on clothing retail again...don't fret, this is nothing new. This is one of the most heavily-shorted sectors and idles at about 1/3 short interest of float. They will continue to play here and it will continue to whipsaw up and down until the crisis is past. I would not worry much if you are long and not on margin. Just be patient, and thankful that short interest will occasionally give you a nice buying opportunity. I think this is one of those points and finally bit the bullet to invest here. We will see who is correct over the next few quarters: the analysts and me or the shorts that say the entire sector is going bankrupt. Just be careful and don't get greedy on margin. You can afford to be patient if you aren't, but if you are doing that, just one mistake on a beaten-down stock can wipe out your account... ;)"
Some class C analysts complaint about JWN earnings saying their analysis on the JWN earning was soft compared to its peers. What a laughing stock!!!. They losttheir faces as their combined consensus covering JWN stock per share was 100% lower what JWN earnings per share actual. They should have admitted that they missed it but go around complaining to justify their calls . JWN will deliver much more in the next quarter....
"So we're living in the upside down, a company that has blowout results gets hammered because of some imaginary supply issue but MEMe stocks that have absolutely no results are up 30% someone please wake me up."
sub 30s is a bit oversold here folks.
Anniversary Sale in two weeks! 
This is crazy. This is wrong
"So everyone thought rates would go up and nobody can explain why they are going down except for the argument of excess liquidity in the system. The reason value stocks are down is because investors are reading it along with a soft service demand data point that the recovery has peaked and therefore the reflationary trade has peaked. Now those looking for alpha are switching back to Tech where the lower rates won’t impede growth and where any possible threat of new variants won’t hurt them. I believe they are acting rashly and not on enough data and making a trade rather than an investment, which is why I continue to be long $JWN $MAC"
"I just read the earnigin report. why they compare this quaterly result to 2019, what is the purpose?. This is the worst ever management."
"News from List of analysts on JWN today: """"11:07 am ET August 26, 2021 (Benzinga) PrintNordstrom, Inc. (NYSE: JWN) shares have taken a dive this week after the company reported second-quarter earnings and sales that remain below pre-pandemic levels.On Tuesday, Nordstrom reported second-quarter adjusted EPS of 49 cents on revenue of $3.66 billion. Both numbers exceeded analyst expectations of 27 cents and $3.36 billion, respectively.Nordstrom revenue was up 96.7% from a year ago. Yet sales are still down about 6% from the second quarter of 2019. The company said sales from its anniversary sales event were up 1% from 2019 levels.Nordstrom reported 30% online sales growth and said digital sales now represent about 40% of total revenue.Looking ahead, Nordstrom raised its full-year revenue growth guidance from 25% to 35%, ahead of analyst estimates of 30%.Related Link: Upstart Stock Soars After Q2 Earnings: $635B Auto Lending Opportunity?Peer-Lagging Performance: Morgan Stanley analyst Kimberly Greenberger said Nordstrom’s earnings recovery is on a “clouded path.”“We see further stock price downside as revenue recovery appears protracted & cost inflation pressures EBIT margin, putting $2.40 consensus 2022e out of reach in our view,” Greenberger wrote.BMO Capital Markets analyst Simeon Siegel said “2019 casts a long shadow” for Nordstrom.“Of particular note, the anniversary sale was only 1% above FY19’s comparable sale, with ‘peer’ lagging performance at full and off price,” Siegel wrote.Credit Suisse analyst Michael Binetti said Nordstrom’s numbers represent “significant lag vs. softline peers.”“As we’ve looked ahead to the US retail re-opening, our thought was that JWN’s 2021 Anniversary Sale could be one of the biggest events in the sector, but the event was only +1% vs ‘19 (for context, URBN’s Anthropology just reported 2Q revs +15% vs ‘19),” Binetti wrote.Profitability Targets Within Reach: Telsey Advisory Group analyst Dana Teslsey said Nordstrom will have to do better to justify its valuation, which is higher than its peer group and its own historical levels.“Looking ahead, JWN can benefit from its exposure to the off-price channel, a profitable digital presence that continues to grow, and a pruned portfolio of full-line stores that can provide an alternative retail experience and accelerated operational efficiencies,” Telsey wrote.KeyBanc analyst Edward Yruma said Nordstrom’s second-quarter numbers suggest its 2022 profitability targets are well within reach.“2Q is unlikely to satisfy the near-term bulls given the continued expense pressure, but we think the Company made continued progress against its long-term initiatives, and we think further reinforced its position as the premier multi-brand premium/luxury retailer,” Yruma wrote.Nordstrom Ratings, Price Targets:Morgan Stanley has an Equal-weight rating and $36 target.BMO Capital Markets has a Market Perform rating and $28 target.Credit Suisse has a Neutral rating with a price target lowered from $39 to $34.KeyBanc has an Overweight rating and $45 target.Telsey Advisory Group has a Market Perform rating and $36 target.Latest Ratings for JWN DateFirmActionFromTo: """""

"Hello fellow longs! What a great couple weeks. Just wanted to post a couple tidbits of VERY good news for the sector amid our runup. Nordstrom is rebounding fast, and I'm sure the question on a few people's minds is: Do I sell before earnings? Is a pullback coming? I can't answer that, but I can definitively say that the sector did VERY well in Q3. Much better than expected. You might think the surge in the clothing retail sector today was due to the positive beat by Kohls. Kohl's said their sales came in much stronger than expected this quarter and they beat, posting break-even profit results with sales down -13% from 2019 Q3 and climbed an additional +11%. But you might not have noticed the more important item that came out today. The October advance retail sales report from the census bureau. Their numbers the past 3 months of August, September, and October in the USA for revenue earned selling clothing and shoes came in at: October: $18778M, September: $17756M, August: $18138M. This is only down 11.33%, 8.78%, and 6.32% from 2019, showing sales trends have significantly recovered in the Fall. Since Koh's sales were down -13% this means their rivals, on average, have done even better than their numbers. So what can we expect from Nordstrom come earnings? Good things I think and the market seems to agree. We have 3 positive bits of info already known: 1) Analysts are bullish on Nordstrom and have been for the whole quarter. Between macy's, kohl's, and Nordstrom, Nordstrom had the highest projected earnings of the trio with a consensus of break-even profit this quarter and profit in Q4 and all of 2021. But note the large disparity in estimates so there is still no real agreement about how they will perform. Why did they have high expectations on aggregate though? 2) Nordstrom shifted their anniversary sale entirely into Q3 this year. Usually it is a few weeks earlier and tends to bring in revenue almost as high as christmas that month. But this year Q3 had the anniversary sale meaning their revenue is expected to be quite a bit higher than peers comparing YoY. 3) Nordstrom has already announced in a retail conference earlier this year that they had their highest sell-through ever on the anniversary sale this year. What this means is out of the items they stocked for the sale, they sold the highest % they ever have. This is great news from a cost standpoint and suggests they may beat expectations depending on how steep the sale discounts were. Despite all this great news, Nordstrom continued to trade at 10Y lows under 45% short interest while smart players accumulated. Then wall street suddenly flipped the story, started posting some good articles about retailers, and triggered a small short squeeze here. Sorry if you got played, but wall street is not your friend and never has been. Their goal is to cause mispricing in the market and volatility so they can profit. Now with COVID vaccines on the way, and retail sales solidly recovering and within 10% of the highs of 2019, the market has suddenly realized they may have mispriced apparel retail. This could run even further up to and on good earnings. I personally think they will beat the break-even expectations and post a small profit, report they have paid down debt, and give positive forward guidance with expectations of future debt repayment and dividend reinstatement sometime in 2021. Their entire sector seems to be recovering much more quickly than expected and Nordstrom in particular tends to have very solid sales numbers every year, being one of the stronger players with a popular brand, with record revenue in 2018-2019. They are not a dying retailer like some. Short at your own risk. I've given you all the obvious catalysts for those that have been following the company more closely and not just trading. Given the large debt load they took on this year, I expect it will take 1.5-2 years to pay it down to pre-COVID levels, so don't expect a surge back to $40 anytime soon. I think $30 could definitely be in the cards though depending on how strong their sales numbers and forward guidance is. I personally wouldn't consider even trimming my position until this is over $25, but expect they will have a nice recovery story the next few years regardless and eventually trade back up to previous levels as they pay down debt and finish launching their recent growth initiatives (new nordstrom local programs, improved online merchandise/centralization, same-day shipping, flagship store...)"
"I’m a retired man, I made a mistake last week and bought 4000 shares of Nordstrom, I’m short 17000 during the last 8 days.I did not sleep a single night and this nightmare keeps going with no end in sight,I looked today at the Nordstrom and they own 63M shares, My question is why aren’t they buying shares to stop this slaughter, Sorts are turning Nordstrom to a micro cap,I just don’t see anyway out of this trap,Any honest opinions will be greatly appreciated,"
Been watching for a while. Bought because they just opened up a Nordstrom Rack in my area (Canada) and it was a 2 hour wait to get in. Lady there said it’s still a long lineup every day so even with Covid restrictions demand is high. Q3 earnings should be good.
"With the earnings hit, the stock is well priced now. I guess no one got the message they got rid of their inventory, this is a good thing. The model is good, premium at Nordstrom, ship rest to rack. And online helps them survive. And they have enough family money to take private."
JWN is going to crush sales estimates this quarter. Lines wrapped around the store for every Nordstrom Rack store that's recently reopened and very healthy foot traffic for the larger full-price stores. It would not surprise me that they will reinstate at least a 4% dividend next quarter which would easily send the stock to the 30's.
"Nordstrom family owns 31% of the float.It is by far the most efficient management in retail, ride the deep valleys and enjoy the climb to higher picks"
So disappointed in this stock. I bought a lot near the pandemic lows thinking it was the strongest play compared to KSS and M. Instead it performs the weakest. Best play obviously would have been DDS. Zooms from 20s to over 200. Wow.
"I’ve never posted anything before on yahoo finance, but must say Nordstrom is ￼going to have a blowout for next earnings report. In Roseville California the high end purse section is practically empty. Parking lot is packed with many happy shoppers inside. This Christmas I am appreciative for all the shorts out there that will be buying and driving the JWN price up in 2021! Merry Christmas to all￼￼￼"
"Wow, beat estimates by like 10-20 cents, but people are inclined to sell? If this isn’t manipulation then idk what is anymore"
Highly recommend listening to the CEO’s latest interview. It’s very encouraging. Here were my takeaways: -anniversary sale is off to a great start -demand is higher than they planned -fixed costs were significantly brought down during pandemic
"Investors have to remember covid 19 made stock dropped this low from the highs. With a vaccine or two, stock will go back up but even higher because other competitors have suffered more pain or have closed up. Stock is coming back strong move in the coming months. Don’t sell at these low teens."
"My friends and I usually went to a men’s wearhouse or I really like Zara for suits; for work and weddings. Zara closing 200 stores in the US and Men’s wearhouse is bankrupt; outdated, and behind the times. Looks like JWN is my new suit spot. How can it not be? With their customer service and ability to perform alterations. Not to mention; many alteration shops have now closed and/or gone out of business. JWN for the win."
LOL. So oversold. G-d.
More downside here! $15 target
"Eric , obvious Wall Street is looking for a replacement for u and your brother to run this company. Take a look around and compare your performance over the past 5 years. It’s extremely dismal versus your peers."
"25% haircut in two days after amazing earning! I'm completely shocked, the market doesn't make any sense anymore, it's so ridiculous!"
"It’s a problem when you know Macy’s and Gap are doing way better, not wanting to diss the other companies but JWN should be doing better. But it ain’t. Wonder what’s up."
It’s going up. Omg finally
"Time to admit that I was wrong. Thought the sp would rally into the mid-$40's by earnings on 8/23, next monday. Unfortunately the disappointing retail sales number put that rally on ice."
"I live in southern California so I can assure you that when the Nordstrom's that are connected to malls here, Nordstrom's was the only retail store open to public while the rest of the stores inside the malls were still closed. Now with the country opening up more and more Nordstrom's will bounce back in a big way. They are still very actively making moves to adjust to the current situation and to move them forward."
already 17.36% up by today in 4 session
The new price target is $35 here. You can double your money in either ZEV or Tilray. Both are the best options for the remainder of the year. September has been a good month to own cannabis stocks. I don’t know why that is except it’s been their history so far.
ANF 's earnings yesterday. It was outstanding and ANF stock was sold off. But it came back big today becausethe whole markets sentiment was positive.BIG LOT (BIG) earnings was released last night. Sold off around $7 at open today and now only lost 2.50.JWN was oversold in the last 2 days after an outstanding earnings and came back today. Still sitting inthe oversold territory and JWN will come back to $33.25 by earlier next week. Be patient investors andhave a nice weekend.
Dana? LOL Chris? hello? Where is the optimism now?
"Yikes! That's the biggest drop I've seen in a while. I still have Nordstrom on my watchlist from when I was investor, and you guys have my sympathies. I'm happy I sold out during the short squeeze at $45 a few months ago. I posted my concerns at the time, and it seems those mostly came true in the short-term, taking a brief look over the earnings report. I still think this is a decent business, but they took on far too much debt when times were good. It will be a slow process getting out from under that and the big interest expenses, but one positive note I saw is they have successfully reduced their interest expenses from 177M in the first half of 2020 to $84M in first half of 2021. Good to see the business is improving and then smoothly paying that debt down with free cash flow even if profit margins are thin and sales a bit slower than some rivals! They seem to be doing ok to me if that is any encouragement to the longs that have stuck it out here! :)"
"I would buy more, but I’m already long term. Such a good price. Idk what the heck management is doing to let this happen. Blood is being shed"
It's a fabulous store. I bought 200 shares today at $28.00 and may bring that up to 500 shares by the end of the year.
"I just went to my favorite local Nordstrom’s ... the sales staff were extraordinarily friendly, and said business was coming back.I did notice inventory was extremely light throughout the whole store. Maybe 1/2 what you would normally see. That’s probably good, demonstrates good controls and cash management going into Christmas."

"warren buffet did'nt had shorts in his time thats why he made it, imagine him 19 year old trading these days."
"Here are my reasons to be very bullish:-the drop in sp after last earnings was a completely short sighted overreaction -Nordstrom did not inventory the home goods that boosted sales for other retailers. -but it will get a major boost from business apparel as we reopen and go back to the office-it will also get a huge boost in everything high end as everyone will want to look their best - even to a spend revenge extent - as the country opens up -CA, it’s prime location, just reopened.-Nordstrom is further investing in digital, the very thing that hurt its stock price in the 5 years preceding the pandemic.-relative to DDS, once we catch up to its sp growth since the pandemic, we’d be priced over $70"
Nordstrom is setting its self up for a massive short squeeze. I can see q3 and q4 results sending it to the 20s. Like the CEO said they are primed for a strong back half of the year.
Break the $30 support back down to $15
Nordstrom now is a better company than it was pre pandemic. I am happy to wait it out till the divy comes back and this is 50+. Helps having a cost average at 12 bucks
"Buy the after market dip, thank me tomorrow morning!!! "
"like at the end of day not all retailers are gunna go bankrupt people are still gunna shop at them whether it be online or in person. in my opinion this is one of the few that is looking really good right now, I could be wrong, but their balance sheet as well as their successful online store is a really encouraging sign that they will be able to weather the storm."
"head fake , close red. see ya!"
"if you're long and losing money, GO SHORT NOW. Get it all back in a few weeks. $20 stock!"
Never felt better about averaging up with over 19% drop after excellent earnings. Don’t forget about the dividend payout that will eventually be back
Nordstrom Is going to have a great earnings report. They wrote off everything last Q and bought very little inventory. They will shock with positive free cash flow. Rack e-commerce sales are going to be higher than an analyst expects. The only negative is that the upside sales surprise will come at lower margins due to marked down merchandise.
"I bought shares after hours for $14.43 and $14.48. What's the bottom $12 again?-Stimulus play-Rebound play-Top $25+ after a year.I will hold thru this christmas and next christmas before I think of selling now.Just bought JWN at 2.4B market cap, company has GROSS PROFITS of 5.32B-5.71B the last 4 years. Think about that."
Huge news. Collaboration with one of the biggest retailers for R&D. 3 new warehouses announced
"I want to complain, but whats done is done. If next earnings is horrible. I’m out. Even Macy’s is doing better, which says a lot already."
"I picked up 2000 shares more this morning and will gamble with it for sure. What I don't understand is everyone else (LB, Gap, etc) has doubled or trippled since covid started except JEN and perhaps Macy's. Who can give a reasonable explanation?"
14M shorts pushing down..should be green 20% up
That moment when the investors realize the quarterly report was actually pretty stellar and the stocks down 27%!
I'm in with 100 shares at 14.66. I'm gonna wait for the price to be above 25 before I sell. Do you guys think that will be this Christmas or next ?
Supply chain warning is what’s hurting this stock. Same news hit ROST and other retailers.
I am glad i held my $45 short positions!!! Won't cover until $15
may be the ceo is giving buying opportunity intentionaly i guess
"when it happens, it’ll be my favorite short squeeze of all time"
the only retailer that has a tremendous balance sheet and plenty of cash on hand. Some stores online orders in their region was so far above expectations that they have little overstock inventory of any seasonal goods left. They will shock the world when they report quarterly profits in August. There is now no competition in there sector. JWN will move above $30 so fast it will turn heads and likely be back to $50 by December!
you'll never see $37 again
How is this remaining so low. someone should buy it. It would be a steal at $35/share.
"It makes a lot of senses if Amazon buys JWN at this cheap price. Both AMZN's and JWN 's corporate offices are in Seattle, Washington. You never know.!!!!!"
"Interesting. With good ER and guidance and largely beat expectation, price dropped more than 20% in 2 days with major index being neutral and mild. Something doesn’t add up at all lol"
"California opens tomorrow. JWN’s largest market, based on number of stores. This is a shakeout before the storm."
"REMEMBER THAT SECOND QTR IS ALWAYS THE SLOWEST QTR N JWN PULLED IT OFF NICELY WITH THE GREAT ER, the THIRD QTR WILL BE THE STRONGEST OF ALL, AND IT WILL SHOW ON NOVEMBER ER. The FACT IS THAT NORDSTROM HAS HAD GREAT ER AND JWN WILL RECOVER MOST OF YESTERDAY RIDICULOUSLY LOSS IN NEXT FEW DAYS ! BE PATIENT"
I can say for a fact if this even touches $25. I’m going all in! Even though I do not want it to even go near that price.
"Do you think this company will go bankruptcy?! If yes, don’t even look to this stock. If NO, you will reach a point to wish the time go back to buy at this very very low price. This company will make it throw, and if you don’t think so, go ahead and look what is going on on social media about the sale. People waiting for this company to make the sale and every one is either buying or at least visiting the stores. They are using the public figures to help marketing and best use of social media!This will fly after the earning! I just double my position on the last 2 days and if it go down, I will buy again and again!"
"Don't worry, this will be green by days end. Somehow shorts are flexing there muscles. Institutions will jump in on these discounted shares. I'm a buyer at this level."
Should Amazon buy Nordstrom after this haircut ? It's a Seattle thing.
I am calling 20%+ increase in stock price today after ER!
Yeah I am not believing this -6% in response to such a fantastic result. I think its a fake-out designed to drive the price down so they can buy tomorrow
"I'm not crazy about Nordstrom's CEO...they need a new one IMO. However, JWN stock is undervalued. I'm going to keep buying and holding."

"Pretty simple, profit back half of 2020, repay small amount of Covid debt in 2021, restore $1.50 dividend (Nordstrom family depends on this for income) in 2022, slap a 3.5% historical yield on this and you have a $45 stock in 2022."
2000 shares and I'm holding on tight! Let's get a rebound. Come on!
"$15 is the real value, way overbought!"
$20 end of sept. I promise!
"After seeing the CEO, I TRIPLED my short position."
My $45 short position is very profitable 
"Great earnings. those that are ""disappointed"", go ahead and sell, I'll be buying any ridiculous dip, see you at $50 by next earnings."
What time is earnings
NORDSTROM FAMILY WILL TAKE OVER BACK TO PRIVATE FOR 38-40 !
Everyone bought back to school clothes. Earnings will be better than expected
17% down just how? Isn’t this stock suppose to be medium volatility? I want to die
I was in my local store shopping Sun and was busy and people were buying.Actually the clothes appear to be better quality and selection tan a month agoMore unlocking and this goes back to normal
"All jokes and bulls and bears aside this is a F ing joke, this drop is uncanny and proves that stock investing is legalized gambling. Just like the casino people can pull off shenanigans and steal money. I’m not hurting at all on this stock I’m up 100percent but for those going off company fundamentals and where the future is for JWN it shouldn’t have gone down this much. It’s a joke it’s a popularity contest"
"JWN will report same store sales early August, earnings is on 8/23 and August will be big back to school/work. Will the sp reach $55-$60 by Labor day weekend? I don't know but the coming weeks are very positive...also ships with product that had been sitting offshore are beginning to be unloaded which is great news."
"$EXPR, $SCVL, $JWN are all down today on great earnings and revenues. For some reason investors are pulling out of retail apparel today. Oh well, all are at bargain prices for the rest of us."
"What a joke. As soon as I saw JWN fall over 12% in premarket this morning, I prepared to buy today. Nordstrom isn't going anywhere and we are returning to normalcy no matter what the fearmongering tries to imply otherwise. Vaccines are getting formal full approval. Companies are mandating employees get vaccinated or face the consequences. It's only a matter of time before majority of health insurance companies continue raising or denying coverage for anyone that's not vaccinated. You have to be a fool to not get vaccinated, but still trust the same medical professionals when you do get sick. I will continue buying JWN under 32. The Nordstrom brand isn't going anywhere. Keep buying. Keep holding."
Im a buyer at 17.Just a few more days at this pace.
Great store experience. Bad management. Heading to 25 or lower soon.
the GAINZ keep coming and coming. SHORT IT NOW and get your money back!
"Lfmao, cute after market -6% in response to such a great beat."
Zero gains in 17 years. Stock at levels first reached in 2004. Eric Nordstrom needs to resign.
KeyCorp reinstated their buy at $45CSG dropped their target to $34Deutsche to $37JPM to $34

Everyone is selling and all these optimistic bag holders are talking about rebound?
"Well it’s literally free fall, can we atleast get a bottom?"
Nordstrom is down 6.31% to 32.93
SHAME ON WALL STREET .SEWER INTERNATIONAL .DELINQUENTS PROFESSIONALS .
-38% YESTERDAY and -6% today on VERY GOOD ER IS REALLY BEYOND ME !!!!
https://discord.gg/tAXSSh7c6a
any chance we do a Macy's tomorrow?
"got into this after it first crashed post earnings. looked like it was a bottom but no luck. oh well... I put a 35 / 27 collar around it so at least my downside is limited, I have room to be back in the green if it rallies, I can trade the options around if needed, and the surprisingly large boost in buying power doesn't hurt. slightly bullish given this really looks oversold, but at the end of the day I dont care too much."
$24s-$25s look likely. May even see $22s-$23s. Watch for an opportunity
come ON! I called 10% haircut..lets GO
"Still recovering from pandemic as one of the last recovery plays but as offices open back up and the holidays come, the next quarter will be great. Won’t go lower than $27 by itself but could with an overall market crash."
"Still bullish on JWN. If Neiman Marcus and other high end is closing, the upper middle class will not be shopping at Costco or Amazon for their clothing needs. Loyalty is high for JWN and their anniversary sale start next week. The stock is on sale this week so scope up more."
year end and quarterly earnings report on March 2nd. JWN will smash that forecast as online and instore sales together have been amazing! After earnings this will be moving towards $50 as much competition has been eliminated!
I repeat Nordstrom very possible being eyed for takeover. There are now vaccines available soon. Vaccines normally takes 10 years to bring out but this time with new biotechnology vaccines can be out in one year. This means people can now look at Mergers and Acquisitions.
(http://Fairstox.com) is truly one of the best stock advice newsletters out there! Their daily emails give me all the information I need to trade more wisely each day. I rely heavily on their watchlists and recommend all traders should do the same!
Again “Ryan” the big run up will happen overtime when shorts cover. It’s settled and pulled back off the big run up fine. Your a short term trader with 10 shares you dont know even probably understand the market well. It will get much worse for shorts
Ha ha the bottom feeders are piling on. I am a bottom feeder.When shares drop 20% I jump in. I have now clue what JWN does for a living. I hope you and GE are on the same boat. Nordstrom sounds like that electric car company Lordstown?
"JWN with great ER, Will end above $34.00"
"Stay strong, I owned at $14.00 got nervous as it didn’t move for 4 days and sold at $14.52, the other day I got back in at $14.95, last time before earnings JWN was above $19.50, this go around they have leaner inventory, used all their stores as fulfillment centers during pandemic and now we have Anniversary Sale which is going strong. I was in my local store on Saturday definitely lesser inventory but it was crowded and ALL customers & associates were wearing masks....earnings represent forward thinking"
What did Captain Nord say to the submarine?DIVE DIVE DIVE
OMG the CEO is bad. Horrible interview. Fumbling around
Going back up to $40 or even much higher. Many competitors died out.Only the strong survive.
"Perfect storm for the shorts since last quarterly dividends of 37 cents ended with ex date of 3/29/2020. Just any mention of dividend resumption and these hedgers will fly. Incidentally it’s a free ride for them when there is no dividend, otherwise every quarter they have to cover the dividend. Management is abetting the 18% that are currently short according to the TD Ameritrade site."
It will go up tomorrow.
"Good Job Nordstrom! Nice to see that as I projected they posted a small profit of 53M, primarily as a result of their cost-saving initiatives and anniversary sale. Revenue appears to have fallen exactly as analysts projected, which means that they didn't properly factor in Nordstrom's recent cost-saving efficiency initiatives and effect of the CARES act. Also I noted that online sales held steady at nearly 60% of the business! They've done a good job transforming their business approach this year with online and 1-2 day shipping. Anyway, really great news! They've started to pay down debt as well! Book value increased substantially this quarter, which should bring those high interest costs down a bit. Hope to see more clarity in the cc regarding their cash flow priorities (how long they will focus on deleveraging vs reinstating the dividend, etc...). GLTA!"
"Weddings are returning, and this will bring a boost to Nordstrom. Stick to the fundamentals, which are strong. From my DD, this stock will go> 40 after the summer, which is a VERY nice upside gain at today's price."
"For those who consider to take profit, make sure you take taxes into your consideration. These is a huge difference between short vs long capital gain tax."
"DAVIDSON RESEARCH FIRM ADJUSTED NORDSTROM (JWN) TO $34.Currently, JWN is sitting at 29.04 , sell off 2.00 today. Not all analysts created equal."
Insane buy volume in the last six minutes before market close. This will go up high tomorrow
Isn’t a drop of 17% a bit of an exaggeration?
Rotation from tech to beaten down stocks such as retailers and banks and even airlines and cruises.
"If Fed talks taper, expect the fall to be mega."
"JWN has 355 net stores, 100 full-line stores, 248 racks, and 7 others. With 50% of stores down at peak COVID, they did $1.7B revenue in Q2... Q2 covid was the height of hysteria and it was the least likely time for any income bracket to buy luxury products... and now, their competitors are almost entirely wiped out...In 2Q 2019, they did $3.7B, a record at the time, with 400 stores open.... so at peak covid, with 50% of stores closed, they still managed to hit 46% of their record Q2 2019 revenue...Short this stock at your own risk."
I rather give my money to charity then buy this #$%$
Omg we moved up .08 cents woo hoo!! Lol
Great earnings! Heavy manipulation on this. I'm not selling :) you're not getting my shares you parasites
guys this was $14 for over a month less than a year ago and I sold the short squeeze to 30
stock hit 12$ during the last covid crash. Wonder what a Delta lockdown would mean ?
brick / mortar is dead. easiest short in the market!
28 million short interest already up 185 million today alone. Ever wonder how the investment banks make so much money 
Wait why the sell-off just beat earnings?
"CNBC was saying it is because of the supply chain constraints. But this issue is to every company, from nike to macy's. My intake is that if they want it go down, then it is a big issue, if they want it to go up, then it is no big deal."
The reason for the stock falling: More shorts jumping on and continuing to short. This means the stock will go down near term but will go up November 19th when they release their earnings and the pop will be massive because of the short percentage.
Shares of $JWN lost over $6...ouchThis will happen to PLTR tomorrow
"Well, things should pickup. Nordstrom is planning to open more stores. CEO said it today at Goldman sacks retail conference. Also, said they had the best anniversary sale they’ve ever had."
if you believe this stock is going down ... you're not smart. currently the stock is pricing in bed bath and beyond hike... look what happened with Nike & online sales .. same exact situation will happen at the end of November. anything below 20 is fair value.
All the big mass selling from funds are likely done in past couple days. This is the rock bottom price to enter folks.
My short positions is making me very profitable!
"I read all the comments here, and im expecting more Nordstrom investor to contribute to our long case to 20s, visiting at least 1 store nearby. Let's do it and beat wall street analysts, lets profit from earnings or if shall we do it before it comes out."
hahahai will buy
"JPMorgan lowers Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) to an Underweight rating from Neutral after factoring in the department store operator's Q2 earnings report.The firm calls the current backdrop potentially as good as it gets for both JWN's core +$100K income customer - considering the mid-teens personal savings rate, debt service ratio at 40-year lows and U.S. household wealth creation of over $12T in 2020."
People are rushing out of this dropping price stocks to save some bucks. Our task is catching them when people dumps. See long term returns this legacy stocks never be wiped out or bankrupt
"Pay close attention to the cash burn statement from the CEO last Q: We successfully strengthened our financial flexibility by increasing liquidity, lowering inventory by more than 25 percent from last year and significantly reducing our cash burn by more than 40 percent from March into April,"" said Erik Nordstrom, chief executive officer of Nordstrom, Inc. ""We're entering the second quarter in a position of strength."
Please reinstate dividends NOW!!!
"Welp, I guess I’ll never understand the stock market."
its just like drive shak DS pumped before earnings and then shorted.
Falling Knife is dangerous to catch! $15 is probably a good base for a rebound!
hodl for 88 days now.
"Barring a market wide correction, this will be the bottom. $37 a share by mid August. hang in there￼."
Kaboom!
"If you’re looking for a short and sweet guide to the day’s biggest news, I recommend (http://Thetraderguide.com). They breakdown the most important pre-market news and it only takes a few minutes to read."
30 is broken! See you at $25. YES!
Dead cat's boune back to $15
"Let’s all send positive vibes for a great earnings for Nordstrom tomorrow, they have really been beaten up"
I will NOT be driving my car today. Just in case. I just shorted a bit more
"this is not, and will never be, a meme stonk. lol It's just a failed b/m retailer that got hammered by a ""pandemic""."
H&M posted a way better than expected outlook for their earnings at the beginning of October. This might be a good sign for the entire retail sector! No brainer 2x within a year imo. Glta
"“The department store wouldn’t share hard numbers from the anniversary sale, but chief financial officer Anne Bramman told the Goldman Sachs Annual Global Retailing Conference in September that the business “had the highest sell-through of anniversary merchandise ever.”"
A 10% haircut is not out of the question!
"Nordstrom, I love you. This stock has been doing well, and I will keep holding long term"
"All indications point to Macy's is firing on all cylinders the why is it down so much today. $WSM $JWN $DDS, $KSS?"
"$25 tomorrow, LOL"
3 day rule works as usual…
10-20 correction is over due. Take profit of the table. Cash is king
"Can’t go lower, Buy more"
Bag holders dilemma
Every major retailer is posting massive profits. I’m calling this is likely a good quarter with another level of increased digital sales for them.
FDA says willing to fast track a vaccine. Looks like Nordstrom and other reopening stocks rally tomorrow!
"Many hundreds of billions of $$$ issuing to benefit child tax credit this year for many families with children between 1 day old to 17 years old would receive over $10K per year per family, more than $1400 per US adult person received in earlier this year. See how much the stimulus to the US spending and the consumer sectors were benefited the most on just $1400.00 per person. Now looking at over $10K for an average US family per year, that will even pump so much spending into the economy..... Beside that, the markets continue hitting new high in all stock exchanges that even make American families richer.... They are all enjoy wealth and spending $$$ on shopping..This is a consumable country....That will benefit JWN as well as other retail sectors..... Buy JWN on any sell off at this deep discount value...."
The ‘fundamental’ reason for the drop is that Macy’s sold 2% more same quarter 2019 while JWN sold 6% less. Let’s discuss that and what the prospects are for JWN.
It wasn't that bad now people.
GREAT BARGAIN PRICE HERE. IM SO THANKFUL FOR BEAUTIFUL OPPORTUNITY. 36-38 in a week max !
Cheap manipulation attempt on a great company that just released great earnings on every aspect.Buy the dip while it lasts (I presume it will go up faster than people think).50$ by next earnings.
Several years ago Nordstrom family shopped company around and was offering around $50 / share however greedy directors wanted more.
"beat earnings by 75%, raise outlook, drop 8% after hours. lol @ this market"
Investors who are willing to hold long-term should continue to see moderate gains in months ahead. $45-$50 is a modest goal as revenue and earnings continue to make progress. Be patient and watch your profits grow.
