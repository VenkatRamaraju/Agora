Bought is during covid collapse mid 2020 at around $17 after selling puts and taking in a decent premium. sold it around $35 earlier this yr. It was a no brainer at the time as economy hasn't fully recovered and $JWN was getting close to pre-covid highs. Around $25 looks attractive to get in IMHO but not trading advice.
"nordstrom is more than just a mall play, it is also travel play, when foreign tourists come to USA, a stop at high end retailer is a must. Likewise when domestic tourists travel, they tend to buy fancy clothes too."
$35 by end of November and $40 by Christmas. I am doing all my Christmas shopping at Nordstrom
Buckle up. Don’t get discouraged if you bought in the $30s. I think we could hit $50 within the next 12 months. Consumers have lots of cash and COVID should really end soon. Management will have more confidence in product assortment.
"Anyone here has any idea what was the price for JWN prior to Covid?Here in Tampa, FL, the JWN store is always crowded.Moreover so during weekend!"
"@Matt, I got in again when JWN was at $26.30 few days ago...Got 2k shares.Not sure it's that even a good entry, LOL!!But personally I think this is definitely worth more than $30 per share..."
Check the YTD chart and see the double bottom. Potentially very bullish 
Starting to get a headache from hitting it on this $30 price ceiling so many times. Ready for a break through!
To put it in perspective here is the YTD performance comparison:JWN -5%M +150%DDS +250%
"Sentiment is poor and wall street is pretty bearish on JWN. I love it. Today is a great day to buy more. As the economy recovers, the sky is the limit for JWN. This is when you want to be in!!!!"
Up slowly and steady. Love it. At this rate of increase we should hit $35 by end November
"Bad news seems to be baked in. As supply concerns ease, covid subsides, and management gains confidence; the top will blow off. I think JWN could be an easy 2x within the next 12 months."
Let’s recap why Nordstrom is the ultimate back to normal play:-people are moving back to urban areas where Nordstrom’s sales were hit the hardest -foreign travel ban was just lifted which will bring tourism revenue back to Nordstrom’s urban stores -kids are going back to school boosting back to school shopping-people are slowly going back to work which will generate the work attire revenue Nordstrom is known for -people are going out and want to finally update their wardrobe -Nordstrom’s upscale brands position it well to get new customers from aspirational buyers who want to buy higher than they ever did before
Next week is setting up to be a potentially; massive week. 52 week low will start creeping up and news for kids getting vaccinated should start coming in to focus. Lots of major cities are still not back to normal.
"Matt and longs, be prepared to have the best Christmas ever. Making a ton on oil and JWN. Buying a brand new F150 cash once JWN hits $32. Loaded. Have a great weekend"
In a few months we are gonna wish to see high 20's this will be in the 40's Longs have seen this stock jump double digits in a single day multiple times.Obviously that's not the kind of market we're in now but nothing lasts forever.Stay strong my JWN crew...
"@Matt, thanks to you.I got in @ $26.30 for 2k shares.Will only sell when it's in the high $30!"
" Up about $2.00 since the October 12th bottom! I love it. That’s the power of JWN. I’ve seen this go up $4.00, in just one day; multiple times this year. Hold strong "
Wait for it... Santa Claus is coming to town.
Retailer stocks are predicted to fly high toward the end of the year.
