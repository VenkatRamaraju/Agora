"If this hits $25 I’m buying more, but thankfully this should be the bottom."
$31.48 is the target. We get through that and $40s are very possible; in the short term.
"The return on capital employed article is misleading. It’s looking at the last 12 months and makes no effort to note that many Nordstrom stores were closed or had almost no foot traffic; for almost half of the year, last year (California shutdown had the biggest impact as Nordstrom has a higher percentage of stores in CA than other retailers). 12 months ago, bankruptcy was a real possibility. Now Nordstrom is doing well and ROCE is getting better."
Next quarter the analyst should compare earnings to 2015.
"Multiple upgrades tomorrow. Got mine at 34.90 because i knew they would sell off. Thanks weak hands, Going into next quarter with raised guidance. Too many upgrades tomorrow will make this a winner."
"got into this after it first crashed post earnings. looked like it was a bottom but no luck. oh well... I put a 35 / 27 collar around it so at least my downside is limited, I have room to be back in the green if it rallies, I can trade the options around if needed, and the surprisingly large boost in buying power doesn't hurt. slightly bullish given this really looks oversold, but at the end of the day I dont care too much."
Seriously?! No one else thinks JWN is a smoking deal? Crickets over here and I love it! More shares at cheaper prices for me. COVID’s about to end and 2022 will be the year of travel and events. Load the boat now or be left behind.  
Buying opportunity
"It’s not rocket science, if they do return cash to shareholders; pps will spike and we’ll find new support. Check the last earnings call. They do want to return cash and the balance sheet is looking great - per cfo"
ANF 's earnings yesterday. It was outstanding and ANF stock was sold off. But it came back big today becausethe whole markets sentiment was positive.BIG LOT (BIG) earnings was released last night. Sold off around $7 at open today and now only lost 2.50.JWN was oversold in the last 2 days after an outstanding earnings and came back today. Still sitting inthe oversold territory and JWN will come back to $33.25 by earlier next week. Be patient investors andhave a nice weekend.
Cheap manipulation attempt on a great company that just released great earnings on every aspect.Buy the dip while it lasts (I presume it will go up faster than people think).50$ by next earnings.
Nice long term hold here
"It’s a problem when you know Macy’s and Gap are doing way better, not wanting to diss the other companies but JWN should be doing better. But it ain’t. Wonder what’s up."
How is this down today? Unbelievable manipulation. Frustrating!
" Up about $2.00 since the October 12th bottom! I love it. That’s the power of JWN. I’ve seen this go up $4.00, in just one day; multiple times this year. Hold strong "
Going to be bought out?
"…, $40 is eminent, Enjoy the ride "
"Wall street is being ridiculously hard on JWN. Last ER is not exactly a blow out record compared to competitors, but it's not bad at all. At least give JWN till end of year before starting to downgrading it left and right. What a bunch of manipulators and sheep."
"I do see those that dropped it down so swiftly, digging among the bones left and brining this stock back up to 33 or 34 today. Unless you have to sell, hang on there for at least 35 by week's end."
"It’s infuriating how this oversold stock goes up less and down more than M and DDS. Short squeeze can be the saving grace. We don’t have much of a JWN specific catalyst until the next earnings report which I’m admittedly worried about. I know JWN will show growth, but a repeat of less than it’s peers again might do damage."
"IMHO the floor has been establishedLow 27.94 13-Week Low 27.94 1-Month Low 27.94GLTA, regardless of your position, may the best man win"
"Can’t get any lower, will head back to $37 within week"
40 by December
"Buy the after market dip, thank me tomorrow morning!!! "
"Brushin'off the haters, for a V recovery!"

"Many hundreds of billions of $$$ issuing to benefit child tax credit this year for many families with children between 1 day old to 17 years old would receive over $10K per year per family, more than $1400 per US adult person received in earlier this year. See how much the stimulus to the US spending and the consumer sectors were benefited the most on just $1400.00 per person. Now looking at over $10K for an average US family per year, that will even pump so much spending into the economy..... Beside that, the markets continue hitting new high in all stock exchanges that even make American families richer.... They are all enjoy wealth and spending $$$ on shopping..This is a consumable country....That will benefit JWN as well as other retail sectors..... Buy JWN on any sell off at this deep discount value...."

I expect October to be volatile. However once Congress passes infrastructure and reconciliation bill end of mont I expect the whole market to rally. I would not add till September job report is released Friday. Market will have a big rally starting October through end of year. I see JWN at $35 and I am being conservative. Consumer sitting on a ton of cash
Seriously?
Zero gains in 17 years. Stock at levels first reached in 2004. Eric Nordstrom needs to resign.
"when it happens, it’ll be my favorite short squeeze of all time"
if down 2mw.will start buying in 27 area.will fill all shares if it hits 25..glta
I am calling 20%+ increase in stock price today after ER!
What an unjustified drop!!!! Still believe we’ll finish the year strong. Time to load the boat 
"Welp, I guess I’ll never understand the stock market."
The ‘fundamental’ reason for the drop is that Macy’s sold 2% more same quarter 2019 while JWN sold 6% less. Let’s discuss that and what the prospects are for JWN.
"You may not see it now, but we are in the middle of an epic economic recovery. Demand is roaring back and that’s why we have supply shortages. It takes time to ramp up production, but we’ll get there. Increase in demand is a great indicator for economic recovery. The consumer is doing well and pretty much anyone who wants a job (and is capable) can get one. I’ve never been as bullish on America, as I am now. We will be a much leaner and efficient society."
"Yahoo starting to hype buying dividend stocks. Nordstrom was a good dividend stock from 2011 - to the start of covid. Now looks like a great time to get in before the dividend comes back. Not sure when it will come, but they have said that they would like to bring it back."
"This is so terrible. I lost 20k~ in just 2 days. I should’ve sold it when it was at $37, I guess I’m holding till next earnings."
$35 by end of year. Consumers sitting on a ton of cash. And Congress about to pass both bills by end of month. Big rally coming
"Tara GonzalezThu, September 2, 2021, 3:00 PMJennifer GarnerJennifer GarnerBauer-Griffin/GC Images Jennifer GarnerJennifer Garner is a celebrity beloved by the internet, which means she can basically do no wrong. Unless you count her skinny-jeans fandom, but whether that's wrong depends on who you ask. Gen Z queen Emma Chamberlain said on her podcast that she hopes that they never come back into style, but clearly, Garner isn't listening.Just yesterday, she was spotted in an extremely famous pair of skinny jeans by celeb-loved brand Mother. (They might look familiar because Meghan Markle is also a fan of the style and has singlehandedly caused many a sellout.) Mother's The Looker jean are known for staying true to their name: The flattering style tends to cause double-takes, which is to be expected when you're twinning with Jennifer Garner. By the way, one style of The Looker, the crop skinny, is under $100 on Nordstrom right now but likely to sell out fast.The best thing about The Looker is that there are various iterations to choose from. For a darker wash, there's the high-waist skinny, and for a more classic denim look, there's the ankle skinny. If you prefer black denim over classic blue, the frayed ankle comes in the perfect soft black — Nordstrom shoppers are obsessed. The only downside is that most pairs cost upwards of $200. But the frequency with which Jennifer Garner wears hers just goes to show Mother jeans are a timeless staple you'll wear over and over again."
OVERSOLD !!! JWN’s PPS WILL RECOVER SOONER THAN YOU THINK !
Nobody believes me
Ready to run again!
14M shorts pushing down..should be green 20% up
October is a volatile month. Congress should pass both bills in weeks. Huge rally in November and December. Easy $35
"Worth noting that Nordstrom has consistently managed inventory well. Peers have, and had, excess amounts that they needed to move (and helped pad their numbers). This helped peers, as they could sell through, and not have to wait for all of the shipping and production delays. Manufacturing and delivery delays are most likely Nordstrom’s biggest headwind, but will get better."
"Nordstrom stock price target cut to $27 from $34 at J.P. Morgan 8:49 am ET September 13, 2021 (MarketWatch)"
may be the ceo is giving buying opportunity intentionaly i guess
It's a fabulous store. I bought 200 shares today at $28.00 and may bring that up to 500 shares by the end of the year.
Bottom appears to be in now. It is holding above 31.20. Shorts are trying really hard to bring it down more but they better cover soon. This isn't falling much more.
"Lol, wow. Enjoying a whiskey and cigar on a holiday weekend and open the JWN yahoo forum....The shorts are frantically posting on a holiday weekend.... you guys made a nice little win. Why are you still here? Waaaayyy bigger chance of 30 than 25 this week. Gotta know when to cash out. GL."
I can say for a fact if this even touches $25. I’m going all in! Even though I do not want it to even go near that price.
Why are retail stocks so dang volatile…especially this one
Stay above $26
"I've been very bullish on $AFRM and $SOFI for a few months as they both have been gaining market share at various websites I'd visit. So the $AMZN partnership announcement on Friday was no surprise. I sold my $AFRM over $100 this morning for over 45% gain and moving it to $SOFI and adding even more shares of $JWN under 29....Nordstrom will be back above 38 in the short term in no time. I have also added more shares to $ADSK, which I expect to be back above 340 also in the short term.Keep buying $JWN, $ADSK, $SOFI. Keep holding."
Why is this going to zero? What happened??
"What a joke. As soon as I saw JWN fall over 12% in premarket this morning, I prepared to buy today. Nordstrom isn't going anywhere and we are returning to normalcy no matter what the fearmongering tries to imply otherwise. Vaccines are getting formal full approval. Companies are mandating employees get vaccinated or face the consequences. It's only a matter of time before majority of health insurance companies continue raising or denying coverage for anyone that's not vaccinated. You have to be a fool to not get vaccinated, but still trust the same medical professionals when you do get sick. I will continue buying JWN under 32. The Nordstrom brand isn't going anywhere. Keep buying. Keep holding."
Macy?s bonds have been rated ?junk? for years. Stop freaking out. There is also a trend to bring entertainment back to malls such as movie theaters. Yes the old #$%$ malls are crashing but Nordstrom is in the nice malls that are coming back. Check the statistics.
Picked up 500 below 28. Unbelievable price
I think we will have another opportunity to buy in the low 20s. be patient
Nordstrom stores are packed in Seattle area today especially the rack stores; yet the stock is behaving like it is going out of business. I am loading on more long call options at this ridiculous low price!
"JPMorgan lowers Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) to an Underweight rating from Neutral after factoring in the department store operator's Q2 earnings report.The firm calls the current backdrop potentially as good as it gets for both JWN's core +$100K income customer - considering the mid-teens personal savings rate, debt service ratio at 40-year lows and U.S. household wealth creation of over $12T in 2020."
All the big mass selling from funds are likely done in past couple days. This is the rock bottom price to enter folks.
NSX saying he adds to his short position every time it goes up but has been short since the teens 
What will happen to the stock price when they announce that the dividend will be reinstated? Will we see upside movement? Or will it stay flat?
"I would have thought that the JWN customer was in much better shape to spend than the M customer. But, perhaps Macy's has been doing more for a longer period of time to address its challenges than has JWN."
okay.. 25% dip on a decent report.. now u start buying.
I just saw the interview….sigh.
BBBY stock 's sell off has come back nearly $2 with the help of the WallStreetBet army. It will help JWN stock and other retailer stocks to cut off today's sell off in sympathy of BBBY earnings issue. JWN is at a good bargain pricing right now and it should rebound to $28 by Friday or early next week.
"At such low price I am all in on call option at 30 strike expired April 2022. I am almost certain they will beat estimate even more in next two quarters and re-instate dividend, which will pump the stock to at least $40/share"
Time to load up for the holidays. It’s going to be a great Christmas; spending time with all of our loved ones. Happy holidays ya’ll. Great things ahead for Nordstrom!!!!
Beth and beyond just missed earnings big time. supply chain and inflation ate into their profits. bbby is down 27%..I suspect this to happen with jwn for the next earnings.
"Definitely going to end red today, I’m just not gonna look at stocks for a while"
"Let’s all send positive vibes for a great earnings for Nordstrom tomorrow, they have really been beaten up"
Everyone is selling and all these optimistic bag holders are talking about rebound?
End of covid is coming soon. This is a collective effort to drive the the whole market down and make big gains (after delta subsides and kids can get vaccinated). Hold strong 
"At this price Nordstrom is a screaming buyout target, and buyout price won't be less than $45 per share. I don't know how shorts are sleeping at night"
"99.99% certain JWN will start paying dividend within the next two quarters, which will send the stock to the 40ish. Keep adding on long call option at this point."
"Perfect storm for the shorts since last quarterly dividends of 37 cents ended with ex date of 3/29/2020. Just any mention of dividend resumption and these hedgers will fly. Incidentally it’s a free ride for them when there is no dividend, otherwise every quarter they have to cover the dividend. Management is abetting the 18% that are currently short according to the TD Ameritrade site."
My short position is very profitable lol
Please reinstate dividends NOW!!!
Retailer stocks are predicted to fly high toward the end of the year.
stock hit 12$ during the last covid crash. Wonder what a Delta lockdown would mean ?
"nordstrom is more than just a mall play, it is also travel play, when foreign tourists come to USA, a stop at high end retailer is a must. Likewise when domestic tourists travel, they tend to buy fancy clothes too."
"Matt and longs, be prepared to have the best Christmas ever. Making a ton on oil and JWN. Buying a brand new F150 cash once JWN hits $32. Loaded. Have a great weekend"
i missed the interview last night. why is everyone saying hes on drugs? was he cracked out??
Easy $35 to $40 stock next 2 months.
"JWN: There are not many retail stocks when releasing their earnings included the 2019's in their comparisons. The CEO might be HIGH when he spoke.... (Just a joke).Usually they compared the the earning for the current quarter/current year to the prior year's quarter in this case for JWN 's EPS and REVENUE on the last quarter on Wed night for the last quarter was outstanding and respectable. They also gave the whole year 2021 outlook positively...Analysts tend to follow the herds and many time they were wrong and the markets just ignored them.For example: the ACI stock price last week when sitting at 27, price was increased to 24 (that indicated the overbought) and the whole group of investors jumped in to boost it to 30...That tells you there are bad analysts out there as their firms shorteda certain stock and when the stock price was down far enough, they bought back and then followed by anupgrade. If you think the JWN stock was oversold and there are good revenue and growth are strong enough ahead of Thanksgiving and Christmas ....then be smart to get in at this deep discount because the oversold was so excessive....JWN will rebound between 33 to 35 near term......Remember there are 2 sides of the trade, one party sells, and one party part buys.... Be patient......."
$24s-$25s look likely. May even see $22s-$23s. Watch for an opportunity
" Ages 5-11 vaccine coming soon, holiday shopping starting early, reduced competition. It’s going to be a crazy holiday season. Better get your gifts early. We’re about to see spending like we’ve never seen. "
NSX in shambles. did you lose all of your money yet?
"Get ready for hitting and close $ 30 EOD, JP Morgan building positions"
Had to buy back in. While I do project it could fall to $25.00. I think current value is too good to pass up. I will hold no matter how far it drops.
"Revenue didn’t exceed 2019 because of the following. All of which can be improved upon. -their urban store locations are yet to recover -traffic is better but not fully back -work attire and similar categories yet to recover -supply chain constraints in process to be figured out But while they didn’t take full advantage of the top line, they:- cut significant fixed costs permanently -brought gross margin flat to 2019-paid down debt -achieved healthy free cash flow -signaled dividend by EOY-grew digital customer (after 5 year investment)-continued data driven integration for inventory and merchandising -partnered with ASOS to attract young customersThey clearly have momentum in revenue. They noted sequential growth into August. Eric said they are not satisfied with the pace of growth and will be taking a lot of lessons from the anniversary sale into the holiday sales. Hopefully the environment will be better by then as well."
Amazing that they downgraded to junk status. Wow Nordstrom is a high quality brand. So much nicer than Macys and TJX. I hope this is the bottom . This would be a nice time to announce going private for $45 / share
Supply chain warning is what’s hurting this stock. Same news hit ROST and other retailers.
Nordstrom is loaded up with debt... profits lagging even with all their layoffs... they got rid of the cream and kept the skim.
"@BBBY -Bed Bath and Beyond's earnings this morning was a disaster as result of supply disruptions thathas caused it.@JWN and other retail stocks were sold off in sympathy of@ BBBY's earnings problem ( remember: @BBBYearnings today for the quarter ending 6-30-2021).Here is the the supply disruption news that has been resulted for the retail sectors as most clothings, shoes, hand bags, jewery products are mostly produced in Vietnam as Vietnam is the country with the lowest wages in the third world with young and skillful workforce. Look at the announcement news below that was in the news over weekend.""Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh of Vietnam said in past Saturday that business can resume production starting this week in an effort to help boost the economy admid talk that US retailers could shift factgories and supply chains out of Vietnam due to Covid lockdown in the whole country recently.""It looks like Vietnam will solve the supply problems for many US retailers including high- end @JWN supply disruption fears ahead of holidays.... @JWN today's sell-off is overkilled in sympathy of @BBBY fears.I am a buyer of @JWN sell-off at this deepest discounts pricing @26.35 right now. Seeing the rebound tobetween $29-$30 next week."
Took a 1300 share position on Friday. Just based on technical this looks beyond oversold. Stop loss at $25.50
"GPS earnings releases and UP big.... This will lift the retail sector tomorrow.Hope JWN will rebound big tomorrow too....""""High tide lifts all boats tomorrow"""""
"I want to complain, but whats done is done. If next earnings is horrible. I’m out. Even Macy’s is doing better, which says a lot already."
"Can’t go any lower, up up from here"
"Can’t go lower, Buy more"
"$EXPR, $SCVL, $JWN are all down today on great earnings and revenues. For some reason investors are pulling out of retail apparel today. Oh well, all are at bargain prices for the rest of us."
Up slowly and steady. Love it. At this rate of increase we should hit $35 by end November
Some class C analysts complaint about JWN earnings saying their analysis on the JWN earning was soft compared to its peers. What a laughing stock!!!. They losttheir faces as their combined consensus covering JWN stock per share was 100% lower what JWN earnings per share actual. They should have admitted that they missed it but go around complaining to justify their calls . JWN will deliver much more in the next quarter....
How is 2 pennies for dividend going to drive this JC Nordstrom to $40 Amy? 
It will go up tomorrow.
"Yikes! That's the biggest drop I've seen in a while. I still have Nordstrom on my watchlist from when I was investor, and you guys have my sympathies. I'm happy I sold out during the short squeeze at $45 a few months ago. I posted my concerns at the time, and it seems those mostly came true in the short-term, taking a brief look over the earnings report. I still think this is a decent business, but they took on far too much debt when times were good. It will be a slow process getting out from under that and the big interest expenses, but one positive note I saw is they have successfully reduced their interest expenses from 177M in the first half of 2020 to $84M in first half of 2021. Good to see the business is improving and then smoothly paying that debt down with free cash flow even if profit margins are thin and sales a bit slower than some rivals! They seem to be doing ok to me if that is any encouragement to the longs that have stuck it out here! :)"
How is this remaining so low. someone should buy it. It would be a steal at $35/share.
Rising tide
"WAY OVERSOLD HERE. JUST BUY N HOLD, 50% return easily in few months."
Read the CFO’s article. “Healthy Balance Sheet”Nordstrom is the perfect apparel retailer for the new economy. They have casual wear and high end suits/dresses for work and events. They have the perfect blend of physical and digital assets. Watch them thrive
"News from List of analysts on JWN today: """"11:07 am ET August 26, 2021 (Benzinga) PrintNordstrom, Inc. (NYSE: JWN) shares have taken a dive this week after the company reported second-quarter earnings and sales that remain below pre-pandemic levels.On Tuesday, Nordstrom reported second-quarter adjusted EPS of 49 cents on revenue of $3.66 billion. Both numbers exceeded analyst expectations of 27 cents and $3.36 billion, respectively.Nordstrom revenue was up 96.7% from a year ago. Yet sales are still down about 6% from the second quarter of 2019. The company said sales from its anniversary sales event were up 1% from 2019 levels.Nordstrom reported 30% online sales growth and said digital sales now represent about 40% of total revenue.Looking ahead, Nordstrom raised its full-year revenue growth guidance from 25% to 35%, ahead of analyst estimates of 30%.Related Link: Upstart Stock Soars After Q2 Earnings: $635B Auto Lending Opportunity?Peer-Lagging Performance: Morgan Stanley analyst Kimberly Greenberger said Nordstrom’s earnings recovery is on a “clouded path.”“We see further stock price downside as revenue recovery appears protracted & cost inflation pressures EBIT margin, putting $2.40 consensus 2022e out of reach in our view,” Greenberger wrote.BMO Capital Markets analyst Simeon Siegel said “2019 casts a long shadow” for Nordstrom.“Of particular note, the anniversary sale was only 1% above FY19’s comparable sale, with ‘peer’ lagging performance at full and off price,” Siegel wrote.Credit Suisse analyst Michael Binetti said Nordstrom’s numbers represent “significant lag vs. softline peers.”“As we’ve looked ahead to the US retail re-opening, our thought was that JWN’s 2021 Anniversary Sale could be one of the biggest events in the sector, but the event was only +1% vs ‘19 (for context, URBN’s Anthropology just reported 2Q revs +15% vs ‘19),” Binetti wrote.Profitability Targets Within Reach: Telsey Advisory Group analyst Dana Teslsey said Nordstrom will have to do better to justify its valuation, which is higher than its peer group and its own historical levels.“Looking ahead, JWN can benefit from its exposure to the off-price channel, a profitable digital presence that continues to grow, and a pruned portfolio of full-line stores that can provide an alternative retail experience and accelerated operational efficiencies,” Telsey wrote.KeyBanc analyst Edward Yruma said Nordstrom’s second-quarter numbers suggest its 2022 profitability targets are well within reach.“2Q is unlikely to satisfy the near-term bulls given the continued expense pressure, but we think the Company made continued progress against its long-term initiatives, and we think further reinforced its position as the premier multi-brand premium/luxury retailer,” Yruma wrote.Nordstrom Ratings, Price Targets:Morgan Stanley has an Equal-weight rating and $36 target.BMO Capital Markets has a Market Perform rating and $28 target.Credit Suisse has a Neutral rating with a price target lowered from $39 to $34.KeyBanc has an Overweight rating and $45 target.Telsey Advisory Group has a Market Perform rating and $36 target.Latest Ratings for JWN DateFirmActionFromTo: """""
"Bad news seems to be baked in. As supply concerns ease, covid subsides, and management gains confidence; the top will blow off. I think JWN could be an easy 2x within the next 12 months."
Insane buy volume in the last six minutes before market close. This will go up high tomorrow
"Prior to earnings, 17,910,000 shares shorted. Perhaps, now is 20M+ (20%) shares shorted.Reddit gangs are watching you naked shorts..."
I rather give my money to charity then buy this #$%$
NORDSTROM FAMILY WILL TAKE OVER BACK TO PRIVATE FOR 38-40 !
"I just read the earnigin report. why they compare this quaterly result to 2019, what is the purpose?. This is the worst ever management."
what kind of market manipulating shenanigans is going on here???? with almost four times the normal volume the price is falling or static????????
"Eric , obvious Wall Street is looking for a replacement for u and your brother to run this company. Take a look around and compare your performance over the past 5 years. It’s extremely dismal versus your peers."
"So many bag holders, i'm not covering until JWN goes bankrupt! LOL"
Finally have long term capital gains on my Leap calls and equity bought at $14 a share. Now the wait for a solid rally and I can start to fade my position.
Shorts have total control over this stock. Unbelievable
When will we have Green Day’s?
"Wow, beat estimates by like 10-20 cents, but people are inclined to sell? If this isn’t manipulation then idk what is anymore"
We’re stair stepping. The last big step was LAST November. Will we have the same this November? 
Why is it down?
"JWN with great ER, Will end above $34.00"
Nordstrom family will attempt to take the company private again maybe! If anyone here remembers from 2017/18
In less than 2 weeks JWN was on the verge of going over $40 to getting kicked in the teeth over earnings despite a beat. Now a credit downgrade simply on the fact that a few of their peers are posting better results but not due to any particular issue at JWN. Seriously? Supply chains have been disrupted. Yesterday the news pointed out that 44 ships are sitting off the California coast full of goods......
"Nepotism never works case in point Viacom, Nordstrom, JC Penny, Sears and the list goes on. Maybe time to change the name from founding name sake to something the new crowd like “Robinhood” could get behind."
"Get ready for reversal, pile up or average down.Insider option activity has solid bullish sentiment"
Maybe we are at the bottom - the endless selling seems to have ended
"Severly oversold, market drama like always, several stocks dropped this august after good ER reports and bounced back. Free cash flow generated in Q2 is impressive (10% better than 2019!!), making the long term debt looks smaller. Low 30's price is a good area of support, time to pull the trigger!"
Buying monthly
"This is frustrating, we are in deep red for so long. Once COVID restrictions are gone, this should shoot back up."
"So we're living in the upside down, a company that has blowout results gets hammered because of some imaginary supply issue but MEMe stocks that have absolutely no results are up 30% someone please wake me up."
Shares of $JWN lost over $6...ouchThis will happen to PLTR tomorrow
Glad I added to my short position yesterday at $30.50
"17,910,000 shared shorted as of 8/13/21. Short Squeeze is coming soon... GLTA!!!"
It's Criminal that longs are holding on to their shares when this JC Pennies going out of business soon!
Buy buy buy
That moment when the investors realize the quarterly report was actually pretty stellar and the stocks down 27%!
So JP Morgan dropped to underweight and 34 dollar target. If you could look into their trades you would likely find that they alerted their large investors to the wrench they were going to throw at the earnings report. One set of goals are set and then you adjust the goalposts to get to where you want to go. Sad
Fake breakout! Don't buy it! Short now! Back to $15
I thought Nordstrom has always been rated as more desirable stock to own than Macys. What happens here all of the sudden? What changed fundamentally?
Buyout announcement today after the market close?
I’m calling $26.98 as the bottom
"when a company meets the goals that have been set for the quarter, a muted after hours move is reasonable unless there was a major run up prior to the announcement. But if a company significantly exceeds the metrics set as Nordstrom's just did, it is not reasonable to change the goal posts to a comparison to two years ago. This is just an analysts trick to be seen as relevant and to move the stock in the direction his top clients are betting on. When you add the 35% guidance which was effectively an almost 50% increase, this should have been a no brainer regarding a stock price rise. This is pure and simple manipulation."
Bag holders everywhere
"News from Vietnam regarding the manufacturing of clothings, shoes, handbags, jewery for the US retailers in the recent talks with the Vietnamese Prime Minister that the he allowed all the MFG companies to run 24 hours shifts in an effort to keep all the US companies to stay in Vietnam, not to go back to China.This is a win-win situations for both Vietnam and the US manufacturing in Vietnam. The supply disruptionsare being resulted before the Thanksgiving and for Christmas Holidays."
"Lfmao, cute after market -6% in response to such a great beat."
JWN STOCK price will come back nicely if GPS blows out its EPS tomorrow.I am buying JWN ahead of GPS earnings as JWN is so oversold today and currently sitting in theoversold condition. Be patient to those who want to see the JWN rebounds back. I am seeing JWNis at $33 at least near term or end of this week.
3 day rule works as usual…
"Calling it now. Back to $45 by spring. All kids should be eligible for vaccination. All schools, events and optional (in-person) work will be 100% open. Nordstrom will know what to carry, they’ll be able to forecast; and will return cash to shareholders. 2022 is looking great. This may be your last chance to buy JWN under $30"
"JWN NEWS: """"Refinitiv/Verus upgrades NORDSTROM ORD SHS from SELL to BUY.BY Investars Analyst Actions - public— 11:03 AM ET 08/30/2021On August 30, 2021 Refinitiv/Verus upgraded NORDSTROM ORD SHS from SELL to BUY."""""
JWN will be GREEN BIG TOMORROW..... don't worry about the after hours!
Wait why the sell-off just beat earnings?
Several years ago Nordstrom family shopped company around and was offering around $50 / share however greedy directors wanted more.
"It makes a lot of senses if Amazon buys JWN at this cheap price. Both AMZN's and JWN 's corporate offices are in Seattle, Washington. You never know.!!!!!"
It’s going up. Omg finally
Isn’t a drop of 17% a bit of an exaggeration?
Buying
GREAT BARGAIN PRICE HERE. IM SO THANKFUL FOR BEAUTIFUL OPPORTUNITY. 36-38 in a week max !
"All jokes and bulls and bears aside this is a F ing joke, this drop is uncanny and proves that stock investing is legalized gambling. Just like the casino people can pull off shenanigans and steal money. I’m not hurting at all on this stock I’m up 100percent but for those going off company fundamentals and where the future is for JWN it shouldn’t have gone down this much. It’s a joke it’s a popularity contest"
Yeah I am not believing this -6% in response to such a fantastic result. I think its a fake-out designed to drive the price down so they can buy tomorrow
@Piddie: JWN market cap is 4.5B. No income tax in WA. Amazon might look at JWN right now....
Going to pick up some LEAP call options at this price.
I can’t believe JWN market cap is 1/13 of Lululemon! I never even heard of lulu brand! 
"Not covering until I see $15 or lower, so bag holders you will be holding the bag for a very long time!"
"After 3 times of pumping this retailer, and dropping drastically, I've decided not read bag holders comments."
They beat earnings why is the stock going down???
"$JWN really needs to focus on the inventory aspect. It’s a highlight of their business. Of course you can’t reach 2019 levels with all of the delays in manufacturing and shipping, unless you have excess inventory like $GPS and $M had. What’ll make this jump is reinstating the dividend and/or announcing buybacks. Which will happen at some point. $JWN is becoming a lean, mean; cash machine. After we have clarity on what the post pandemic world will look like, the sky’s the limit for JWN."
"beat earnings by 75%, raise outlook, drop 8% after hours. lol @ this market"
This is such BS they just had earnings and just RAISED guidance. Clearly they wouldn't do this if they had the same supply chain issues as BBB.
Its not enough to add shares at this level. Load 6 months out call option to maximize gain in q3 and q4. Back to school and holiday seasons plus decreasing Delta infection rate will push this to 40ish easily.
"Don't worry, this will be green by days end. Somehow shorts are flexing there muscles. Institutions will jump in on these discounted shares. I'm a buyer at this level."
(http://Fairstox.com) is truly one of the best stock advice newsletters out there! Their daily emails give me all the information I need to trade more wisely each day. I rely heavily on their watchlists and recommend all traders should do the same!
"The CEO is being interviewed on CNBC, he comes across passive and self doubting, does not project confidence at all...Just an observation."
Revenue grew 35% vs guidance 25%company lifts full your guidance
"Should break $30 today, it’s time for a rebound. Hopefully the shorts can feel a little pressure!"
"Oversold. Just bought it after Cramer screaming sell, sell, sell"
Keep buying under 30 while you can. Consumers want luxury goods and demand has continued for months. I said it before: Nordstrom is not going anywhere. Keep buying. Keep holding.
Not bad for a Friday. This was in the $30s just a few days ago. I don’t see why we can’t get back there soon.
I’m just…wow
"Right now is when you buy this, before 11:30 snap back"
Today had nothing todo with fundamentals. Only emotion.
We should be back to mid $30s before the next earnings call 
"CNBC was saying it is because of the supply chain constraints. But this issue is to every company, from nike to macy's. My intake is that if they want it go down, then it is a big issue, if they want it to go up, then it is no big deal."
"Interesting. With good ER and guidance and largely beat expectation, price dropped more than 20% in 2 days with major index being neutral and mild. Something doesn’t add up at all lol"
"DAVIDSON RESEARCH FIRM ADJUSTED NORDSTROM (JWN) TO $34.Currently, JWN is sitting at 29.04 , sell off 2.00 today. Not all analysts created equal."
Buy and accumulate now do not miss the opportunity..
