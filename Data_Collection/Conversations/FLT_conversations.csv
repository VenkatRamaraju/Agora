"If revenue is already declining, what happens now with the lawsuit.Wont this impact revenue in the future?"
Sold off all my shares. I'm back in when this all stabilizes. $MAXR.TO $FLT.V $TCS.TO
If you want a real investment ** $FLT will far surpass this company by years end ️
I hope FleetCor and its CEO Ron Clarke finally get what is way overdue
"Shorts will borrow your share at a higher price, sell it then do all the nasty work to make the SP go down, then buy back the shares again for a lower cost and return it. This is how they make a living. I own $DMGI $HUT $BITF $HIVE $FLT $CBDT and these shares been heavily shorted. I have made a Sell-order for each of my shares (100$ a share locked for 90 days). This will avoid your institution taking your share and giving out to short. Let's give the shorties a hard time and keep our SP go up. GLTA."
Haha just wait.. large American investors are all over $FLT right now. It’ll pass DFLY shortly 
"""Run don't walk"" Glassdoor reviewCurrent Employee - Anonymous Employee in Norcross, GADoesn't RecommendNegative OutlookDisapproves of CEOI have been working at FLEETCOR full-time for more than 5 yearsProsOnly a Paycheck for me.ConsUnethical business practices, hostel work environment that stems from the CEO down. The claims by Citron and in the FTC law suit of overcharging fee, hidden fees, penalty pricing, etc are all true. I have seen and heard it first hand. So many law suits filed by employees, even Sunshine City EMP. Retirement fund. No raises what do ever, the lack of capital put in to tech and infrastructure is beyond ridiculous. Servers that fail systems that are so layered they don't function. Profit goes to the CEO's salary, he buy' s a ""Corp"" jet PLEASE, Between the law suits and the CEO's rape, pillage, and plunder attitude the wheels will come off.Advice to ManagementDrain your swamp!"

"Moving up nicely, trying to figure out why?Company seems to have more than a couple headwinds."
"As Citron points out the CEO of FleetCor (or as Citron says so eloquently, it's known as FleeceCor, amongst it's detractors) is amongst the highest compensated CEO's in the Entire World... and for a Co this size it doesn't make sense unless he's cheating the system in order to gain, which he probably is/has."
"My father, The CHAMP sr has been around the block a few times and one stock he recommended to me was $flt.v. I have heard nothing but great things about this company from him and I decided to invest it in. This stock could very well see 5-7 dollars in the near future."
"FLT just paid out $50M for a class action lawsuit?and now there's a Federal case against them?Will that mean another class action suit is likely if thestock now goes down again?When will this stop, what is wrong with this management?"
"$THRM is a great company, you should also check out $FLT, on the move too"
"“Let me be clear. My bet would be that FleetCor is subject to an FTC order either through consent or litigation where FleetCor must pay a significant amount of money and be subject to a consent decree that alters the company’s billing and marketing practices.”– Former Director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer ProtectionFleetCor (FLT), the nation’s largest operator of fleet cards, has over the course of 10 years skillfully built a business based on deceiving small and medium sized businesses into paying excessive and erroneous fees. This cannot be disputed. What can be disputed is the legality of the business.The FleetCor business was best described in a recent Bloomberg article:“Consumer advocates and some former FleetCor executives say the firm is an embodiment of bare-knuckles, winner-takes-all capitalism, and takes advantage of smaller fish who have little recourse but to complain to regulators or undertake costly litigation.”."

Down to $310 after hours!Lost $18.85 per share?Crazy. This company is toast fromlawsuits and reduced revenue.
Fire Clarke and the rest of current management and start over.
"Good day! Glad to have bought in when I did. Keep pushing tomorrow bois and gals. This company is worth way than $DFLYF and $FLT.V. They have to oursource their AI, $PLRTF makes their own AI. This is easily $3/share, probably even $5-20. And that’s before they could secure contracts with government entities for airport security, hospitals, military, space tech, delivery services, etc. Less go!!"
What you guys think about they competitors : $EH $UAVS $FLT potential

Love this company and everything they're doing for drone technology. It's a matter of when not if this explodes and we start seeing DDC everywhere from transporting medical supplies to delivering pizzas. Happy Monday folks. #LongliveDDC #TAKOF #FLT
Citron just released a report suggesting that FLT is under FTC investigation!
Tony on Twitter 15 minutes ago: Drone Delivery Canada will be on @citynewstoronto tomorrow. Tune In. $FLT.CA $TAKOF #drone #dronedelivery #savinglives

"I hold 3 canadian small cap/venture stocks in my portfolio and all 3 have absolutely been crushing it, with Enthusiast leading the charge. What a steal now when I originally started buying in the 1.50 range. I felt strong about this company back then ( I have posted about this company on this board last spring) and feel even stronger now. This thing is a straight line up!! BTW, my other 2 companies, $FLT.VN and $XBC.TO, which coincidentally, the latter just graduated from Venture to TMX a couple of weeks ago."
Problems go back prior to 2017 and management did nothing to correct them.No wonder the Feds are now getting involved..

Buy Puts NOW
Gains here #nio
"Easy bounce back.. Been there many times so no worries... $HIVE, $FLT, $CBDT and $DMGI are the 4 shares that are currently under valued & I trust that will go up in time."
"Thinking if this pops above $320 again it might pay to start shorting in tiers, or buy some puts?Dont see this getting better in near term with lawsuit, etc."
$FLT.V is a better bet with your money to be honest guys. Drone delivery is the future.
"This company is making a comeback from the scandal that enveloped it awhile back. The naysayers can complain all they want, the simple fact is they should've covered their shorts already. This company is not going under and it will reclaim the levels it fell from. I never sold my shares. This company is a turnaround story and will make poor people out of those who disagree."
Great recent news video giving insight on the opportunities $FLT.V has in store.
