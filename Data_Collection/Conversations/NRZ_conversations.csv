"Internet purchases by Zillow, etc. now account for 13% of the sales in the Phoenix metro area. Enter the MEGA flippers. I think this is becoming a trend in all the desirable markets and is not going to lead to lower home prices."
what's the point of muting someone if you want to know what he is saying? I would rather not hear about him at this point in time.
will today be the day we see $11 again? Let's get there and close above $11.
I would have sold but this is a bargain with the tailwinds. Good god what this will be worth in 3 years when our divy gets back to .50 ... GOD SPEED and all that stuff.
another offering- what happened to the mega cash provided by Caliber ?
Allow me to re-write for some. On 30 Aug Credit Suisse changed NRZ to outperform with a PT of $13.00. GL2A
any ideas why the weakness today? Seems like all the mReirts are down today?

"F it.. How about a simple board vote to shut one of us up!! Instead of all the bickering!DBTuna states that we are all morons if we own more than 1% of a stock, and that we can ask any financial advisor and they will tell us that (although he cannot cite one here for us)..And that it is ok to own 20 or 30 stocks, but yet they cant be more than 1% each, which in effect would leave you with a portfolio that could only be 30% max individual stocks, rest would have to be funds, etc.. (btw, my personal portfolio is 95% individual stocks)..I say that is total BS, I cannot find ONE advisor with this same mentality!So, you either agree with me THUMBS UP, or the tuna, THUMBS DOWN! If i lose this, i will shut up! I would ask that if you do agree with DB, please cite your source for this 1% strategy as he has been able to come up with one for me and he was the one who threw it out there and called us morons!"

"What's the purpose of this board?For me it is to gather information both pro and con and help me decide when to buy/sell or to keep holding. For most here, it would seem this is a board many want to hear cheerleading and good news only. They have a pre-conceived opinion and want to hear the same opinion from others. It is a shame that this is a microcosm of our society at large. Most only want news that reinforces their opinion or viewpoint."
"Folks, this is a mortgage REIT. Stock offerings are how they acquire capital, to be invested into their business, to grow the business and earn more $$. Per their conference call they see many opportunities for growth and acquisition in 2019. In order to pursue that cash is needed. I don't know the specific opportunities management is pursuing but they have done a good job thus far. Today's drop is a BUYING OPPORTUNITY, I for one added more shares. Stock price will come back up, the new shares purchased will earn 12% plus ~3.5% of today's drop, plus more as I believe this will go higher. Want an exciting growth stock? Don't buy into NRZ. But want a dependable income earner with a good business model, that pays a high dividend they are able to cover well? Here you go. Buy the dip."
"“Inflation is transitory” is now a pretty sure bet to come back bite more than a few pounds of flesh from Mr. P’s behind. If ole Jer has not yet read up on his history, he’d be wise to check out the Fed, 1936. With winter on its way, federal cuts in domestic drilling, natural gas shortages already in Europe and supply chain shortages all pointing to some very serious inflation, the big question for the Fed EARLY NEXT YEAR, is “How many interest rate increases will it take to drive the economy into recession.”Rates are going up folks. Play it as you will."
$NRZ Is the best MREIT in the business. Buying Caliber out and that closing to happen within a month or so. Got news coming in next few days on rental business. Will have $1B+ in cash as soon as Caliber closes. Will be raising dividend soon. Has a book value of $11.25 and trading at less than $10.If you like long term royalty money......this is your stock. You will own these shares for free 5 years from now. The dividend will pay you for your shares and you will get dividend for life!$13 near term target. $15 mid term and $20 in next year.
Who is selling?
We started the week at $10.93. It is nice to see us above $11.
it's been a month since we've seen $10. It's a great start.
Great yield with dividend growth ...great value right now.
"If they announce another share sale before the dividend, I'm out. That's the only thing keeping this under $12. With $1 in dividends, this should be $12"
Calls are a beautiful thing!
strange day today. We were all over the place. I took advantage of the weakness to add to my holdings.
"Credit Suisse is out with an updated investment report on NRZ today. Core earnings estimate for 2020 increased to $1.52. IMO, There will be a dividend increase by Q3 end. And the possibility of a ""special dividend"" by year end.Credit Suisse May 28thThe combination of increased confidence in liquidity, improved visibility into near-term profits from the operating businesses and attractive valuation (71% of book value), in our view, makes the risk-reward attractive for NRZ. Our improved confidence in liquidity comes from the recent $600 million senior secured loan and better-than-expected forbearance trends. Our recent conversation with the heads of origination and servicing, combined with the recent operating updates, increases our confidence in the operating business earnings outlook. Updated estimates: We are increasing our 2020 core EPS estimates to $1.52 (from $1.42) and maintain our 2021 estimate at $1.30 to reflect 1) increased origination profitability and 2) the cost of the $600 million senior secured term loan (including increased share count). Our estimates do not assume any near-term deployment of the recently raised capital, which could provide potential upside to earnings power. Risk to our estimates includes lower than expected origination profitability."

"MORTGAGE RATES RISINGGood news for NRZExpectations that the Fed will soon start to withdrew some of the monetary support to the economy have boosted mortgage rates, hurting refinancing activity and demand for home purchase loans. A report from the Mortgage Bankers Association on Wednesday showed mortgage applications dropped 6.9% last week from the prior week.Refinance applications tumbled 9.6% from the previous week and were down 16% from a year ago. Applications for loans to buy a home dropped 1.7% from a week ago. The 30-year mortgage fixed rate rose four basis points to 3.14% last week, the highest since July."
PATIENCE IS THE KEY!!!!!
Hopefully we can hold the $10 range this week. Make sure it holds. Then maybe $12 by the end of Q3.

NRZ's chart looks very good for those who follow the technicals
we started the week at 9.74. Slowly but surely...

A couple of points I will bring up to why I'm making this enquiry.- the Company’s revenue is up and they turned profitable this Yr but I'm concerned about cash from operations leading to a low cash flow, is this a concern or is it some unforseen expenditure I've not seen?- I've been told that reit is a good hedge against inflation for when the Fed decides to taper, presuming transitory prediction doesn't play out!?- over 8% dividend is a good payout is this due to federal corporation taxes being waved if 90% of Nrz taxable income is distributed back to its investors?Serious investor and welcome your input, thanks in advance."
always right before the div buy this thing goes way up. only time we got a break was last round. Lets get 15 boys!
What a bargain this should be at 12.50.

Ill take a few pennies up with the DOW getting shredded!
Is this company growing on a diluted share basis? Here are the last quarters of earnings as reported by Fidelity on an adjusted basis and GAAP going back a couple of yearsQ1 2019 37c 37cQ2 2019 (8c) (8c)Q3 2019 50c 54cQ4 2019 61c 51cQ1 2020 48c ($3.86)Q2 2020 34c (2c)Q3 2020 31c 19cQ4 2020 32c 16cQ1 2021 34c 65cQ2 2021 31c 26cDid they ever really earn enough to pay that 50c dividend? It looks to me like all the share dilution has not grown EPS over time. Their cost of funds is too high.
The earnings call was ok. It sounded like the Caliber acquisition was about acquiring a bigger companies technology at pre-Covid prices. Hmm guess we'll see if it means anything good in 2022. Hopefully this transaction will close in the 3rd quarter as stated in the call.
"I love to read the people knocking this stock, I will give it to you straight, This stock is a investment stock, LONG TERM, nothing more, one can't play it as a short and come out.

Me I am looking to buy another 1000 shares"
Up Up and Away!
"Stable quarter, definitely better than I expected despite GoS and MSR headwinds, attesting to the increasingly diversified investment and operating portfolio. Earnings supplement and forward-looking trends on-call objectively very positive. Next year (finally) going to be exciting. Highlights from call and earnings supplement: A) Earnings Power:-- Caliber closes ""early this quarter"",-- With Caliber core earnings would have been around $0.40+ (+30-40% vs. $0.31 from NRZ alone). - ""$0.40-60"" quarterly core earnings explicitly stated as the expectation for next year from combined business. - $150-200M in synergies (0.10 more in earnings per quarter in synergies + before growth $0.15 more per quarter in earnings)B) MSR Business: -- Per slide 13 of supplement, refinance projections for 22E are less than 1/3 of 2021 and 1/4 2020, making next year the year of the MSR, and NRZ is the single largest non-bank holder of MSRs. -- Refinance recapture increased to 40.7% in Q2’21 (from 28.2% in the previous quarter) as Direct to Consumer channel had largest funding quarter. Caliber recapture even higher. -- Now 71% capital markets financed at very low rates, so locking in long-term financing to further reduce interest expense preparing for the next 5 years MSR boom.-- Currently at a balance sheet low despite slowing prepayments (i.e. dropping refinancings), so write-ups in future when rates ascend.C) Origination business: Purchase market to remain very strong for years with low rates, and mix with Caliber will favor purchase market. Share gains stolen from the bottom 90 originators are expected driving stability in origination business. -- They said GoS margins have hit their bottom and are stabilizing and even improving after the adverse refinance fee was removedD) New businesses-- New early buyout (EBO) market they are entering is enormous and profitable-- moving into Single Family rental to address wave of millennial renters and launching a new operating platform in Q3/Q4E) Risk-- 2.3% of portfolio now in active forbearance down from 3.5% in Q1-- $1.1B in cash on their balance sheet AFTER close of transaction-- Risk in form of total leverage, mark-to-market, majorly reduced from 2020 across the board-- Biggest weak spot this quarter: MSRs across the board (interest rates fell; prepayments remained high)F) Valuation and Dividend-- $11.27 book value vs. $9.70 current price. Book value grew to $11.43 before dilution from Caliber equity financing. -- Fair value of stock according to mgmt: $15-20-- Timing for next dividend raise? Probably $0.25 in Q4, and then $0.30 by Q1/2 next year keeping with a 70% conservative core earning payout (90% req is on GAAP income)"
looking good after hours. It will be an interesting day tomorrow.
Really low volume two days in a row. Failed to get over 11.475. Created a double top. Probably get a chance to buy more at 11.00 sometime next week.
Interesting... what opportunity do you think NRZ will get for $400 million proceeds?

yes the market is down-but NRZ is down a lot - Question - is the China Property Evergrande the reason NRZ is following suite ? what happened to the Caliber confidence?

Why would you increase dividend and then do a share offering? Isn't that the definition of a PONZI? My sell order is in. This is a PONZI
NRZ is looking nice recently and finally some hope with it. But it does have a long way to go before it gets to the pre-pandemic levels it was at in February 2020.

Only 5 weeks left to announce Caliber closing....hope they don't let us down...that would be twice since I've owned this...remember? Spinoff?I'm bullish but it would hurt ..
If we don’t go over 11.475 today it will create a double top on the chart and we are probably heading lower. Thoughts? (Bought another 1000 shared today anticipating a new 52 week high)

"About as good a risk/reward and set of forward catalysts as NRZ has ever had for next 12-24 months: -Rising interest rates will drive up the historically low MSR values on their book while also slowing prepayment speeds which should increase quarterly earnings and cash flow meaningfully by end of year; - Compressing gain on sale margins will drive other originators to sell NRZ their MSRs growing their book; - Increasing recapture (finally!) this quarter across all channels + synergies with Caliber's extraordinary recapture rates will further drive up long-term MSR values and cash flow; - Robust home purchase activity will play into Caliber's speciality sustaining origination as refinancings drop; - Lots of new products discussed add organic growth and cross-sell potential- big cash earnings increases + EPS-accretive acquisition will add inorganic growth - Trading at a discount to book value today while MSRs are at historic lows and with no real credit for the value of the origination businesses; - Broadening senior leadership team with optimism perceptibly growing this quarter vs. last few - Analyst price targets don't include the integrated earnings power of the overall entity yet- Hyper equitized, Covid-backdrop and forbearance improving, removed virtually all mark-to-market risk and locked in at low rates, big advance facilities set up if needed = dropping sources of risk- As NRZs ecosystem grows, it can acquire other businesses even more productively Biggest question asked by all the key analysts is how MSR improvement plays out relative to the expected drop in earnings from origination as interest rates rise, and the basic answer was net-net NRZs overall business increases meaningfully. By Q4 this entry point should look pretty obvious to own whatever your metric across BV, core earnings, dividend yield, or expected growth. Very good business at a very good risk-reward moment to own it"

"More good newsA further slowdown would be bad for mortgage volumes, but good for MSR values. Those values fell as refinancing surged because prepaying a mortgage dries up future servicing fees. Rising rates and slowing prepayment speeds, in turn, would boost those values. Jefferies analyst Ryan Carr estimates that New Residential's MSR gains would be ""more than offsetting"" to a drop in origination in a rising-rate environment. A return toward 2019 values for MSRs could add $1 billion or more to the value of New Residential's MSR portfolio, or $2.50 or more to book value a share, which was $ 11.27 at the end of the second quarter."

Never panicked with NRZ but saw opportunity to roll my income larger when the market got Covid rattled. I dare say I have more shares than anyone who has been on this board for the past 5 years (75,000+). Even if the divi stays at .25 you can do the math. DB Cooper has bashed NRZ for years and I have always considered him entertainment. CHeers"
9 million shares short. can you say squeeze?
nice!
"Here is a question which I hope someone could give me an answer for: WHAT MAKES NRZ MORE IMPORTANT THAN ANY OTHER MORTGAGE REIT?I have just counted all the posts which were made during the last 3 days (Today, yesterday and the day before) at the discussion boards of my 4 REIT's and here are the results: NRZ: 34 ABR: 0CIM: 5TWO: 3 To me, mortgage REIT's go up and down together. Common factors like ""The state of the economy"", ""Interest rate"" and ""Home prices"" affect their share prices more than the specific finances of each REIT. Nobody cares to study the finances of ABR, CIM or TWO but most people here study NRZ's finances in details. Why?"
Big dividend increase announced. Increased to 25 cents from 20. The recovery continues.
"looks like all the Mreits were down today. But, I couldn't tell you why."
"good volume, good day, great company!"
Look at it go!
"I had bought and then sold part of my Homepoint Capital, now NRZ is buying one Genesis Capital... They get a good deal or is this going to drag me down over 2022? Still enjoying my $1 div on a $3.50 cost but not sure I want to keep this in the IRA anymore with its current level of growth."
"If your in any country illegally. Your breaking the law, and you don't belong there. So simple to understand. I feel very good about NRZ."
"Re-reading mgmt's comments yesterday, its a near guarantee of $0.25 div raise this quarter, then $0.30, then $0.35... with upside back to $0.50 a quarter as rate environment rises. So on a true forward 1-year basis, this is currently >10% yield, and likely a 14%+ forward yield two quarters from now. So if you buy now and hold for the year, once we are back to $0.35 a quarter (which is almost covered by core earnings already), the stock will have to rise above $14 per share to keep the dividend yield around 10%. So the slow but powerful catalyst will continue to be dividend increases driven by core earnings driven by slowly rising rates increasing the value of their MSR book. So great thing to buy in at the bottom of a historic low rate cycle while its trading at a historically low multiple, especially after all the refinancings of last year which meaningfully reduced its overall risk exposure. 40-50% equity appreciation + 10-15% cash dividend yields next 12 months across a portfolio that is hedged against interest rate increases."

"Good day here in comparison to the indexes. And, better than most of the other Mriets."
Options experts.. Pretty good volume of $3 -2024 puts the last couple days! A hedge? Can someone really think this is gonna tank like that?
"Post #2The emphasis going forward is clearly on their operating business. And maintaining and growing book value. They are projecting origination volume growth from $22B in 2019 to $40-$50B in 2020. A doubling of their 2019 origination volume. This after they tripled their growth in 2018 from 2017. Going from $7B to $22B. As long as rates basically stay where they are or decline further they should be able to achieve that growth projection.That growth rate in their operating business holds the key to whether they will be able to maintain and even grow the current dividend going forward. Who here wants to bet against them? Not with Nierenberg at the helm.The ancillary businesses are set up right now to further support their operating business growth objectives. I don't expect much in the way of core earnings support right now. For example, their largest partnership with Covius with it's high growth rate primarily supports their book value and will not generate earnings that flow back to NRZ. EBITDA growth in Covius is double digit.Michael Nierenberg with 30+ years experience in the REIT business is impressive. If there is a better, more experienced CEO out there I have yet to see him. Shareholders should never lose sight of the fact that this management is outperforming the current mREIT industry. That's what you're investing in. His experience and competence. Hopefully at some point NRZ will be properly rewarded for that highly competent stewardship. I stay fully invested."
this move is nice. A few more cents and I will be even.
"Im out!! Cant stand it anymore.. Been nothing but grief since i doubled my initial position last April. Management does not seem to be working for us, it is almost like they are borrowing more money just to keep paying us our dividend each quarter? ZERO trust in management so i have decided to sell it all! See you on the other side. I just hit enter on the order, sell all at $17.50! Pow! Good riddance NRZ"

NRZ is heading back to pre-covid
"Couple of key snippets from CS reinstating coverage of NRZ today.We are reinstating coverage of New Residential (NRZ) with an Outperform rating and a $13target price following the completion of the Caliber Home Loans acquisition. With a larger, more scaled origination business and improved balance between servicing and origination (combined with the investment portfolio), we see NRZ being able to deliver more stable ROEs and book value growth. This combined with the dividend results in an attractive total return opportunity. $13 target price: Our $13 target is derived from a sum-of-the-parts (SOTP) analysis. Our $13 target price is based on a 6.0x multiple on our estimated 2022 Mortgage Banking (Origination, Servicing, and 50% MSR & Servicer Advance segments) earnings and 95% of book value on the investment portfolio. The combination of the 9.6% dividend yield plus appreciation potential results in a ~30% total return opportunity.Better balance: The acquisition of Caliber provides NRZ with a better balance between servicing and originations allowing for better organic investment opportunities. Despite the better balance, NRZ still has one of the highest ratios between servicing and origination volume potential. NRZ is well-positioned to benefit from rising rates, as gains in the MSR portfolio should act to offset a decline in mortgage volumes."
"bought back 90 1/20/23 $15 calls @ 0.34, thinking the stock might have a chance to be there before the expiration., paid 1 cent more than middle, sigh."
Money in the bank buddy!
"The volume here is huge today. More than twice the daily volume, and the day is not over."
One year ago a poster said why would anyone buy NRZ when they can buy Rkt. since then NRZ went up 47% and RKT went down 27%. Be careful listening to our resident Troll he will cost you money. The fool is still pumping RKT.
I don't understand 12.50 seems like 18 dollars would be fine.
Hopefully the new offering causes no dilution to the common stock holder...methinks they have already targeted the 400kk for another accretive bargain purchase. Looks like the mgmt. is slowly & quietly building a powerhouse in the sector.
"It has become a habit for some amateur self-proclaimed gurus: in order to get into a good stock for cheap, they publish deliberately negative writeups on the do-it-yourself site Seeking Alpha, WS then aggregating the headlines. Over the years they have been dead wrong. I said it before and I'll say it again: the fair valuation of NRZ is around $14."
I wqas hoping we would see 12- 12.50 when the Caliber closing took place. Is this unreasonable?
Next year dividend will be at $1.50 Stock could rise to $15 next year
Calls are a beautiful thing.
Let's see $10 today!
NRZ has done much better than the market today. 
Why did revenue fall 36.9% reported June 30th in their 2nd qtr. announcement? I don't think it was because of their investment in Caliber Homes.
"just my opinion,but I thought today was a good day. We broke $11,hopefully for good. And,we did it on great volume. Hopefully, this is a trend. We closed a week from last Friday at $9.60,so we are doing quite well.Not sure what the others hear are thinking,but it would be awesome to hit a new 52-week high before the end of the year.As Rhonda says,""Cheers""."
New Residential Inv is up 4.92% to 10.35
Finally this #$%$ is getting a pair of legs to stand on for a change.. Need it to get back above $15 AT LEAST THEY BUMPED UP THE DIVIDEND TO $0.25 CENTS WE CAN ALL GET RICH SLOW.
on seeking Alpha￼ Can someone tell me why the payout ratio on NRZ is 57.81 and the Preferred are so much higher NRZ.PB payout ratio is 178.03%It’s made me Confused
Its an old man stock I'm old works great. If we get to 15 and it will shortly I might sell a few.

"Here is a good rule to know whether a company isn't covering their dividend. And a ""return of capital"" is actually a return of your capital or just an accounting term that is easily mis-characterized to serve ones agenda.If NAV has increased, the company earned more than it distributed. If NAV has gone down, the company distributed more than it earned. NRZ BV 12/31/2017 = $15.26NRZ BV 12/31/2018 = $16.25Company earned more than they distributed. Another way to look at it:GAAP Net Income 2018 = $964M or $2.81/shareCore Earnings 2018 = $815M or $2.38/shareCommon Dividend 2018 = $693M or $2.00/shareNow a question for those who say a ""Non-dividend distribution"" is un-earned return of your capital.Did the company out-earn their dividend in 2018? Simple Yes/No?"

awesome! I think this move will make a lot of people happy.

"Thanks for the patience board, my point has been made and im moving on! A few last things for clarification.. And it is all very well documented on this thread last February and after..1. I never touted this stock at $18 in its entire existence.2. I sold my entire stake at $16.22 in february, very well documented! (before the fact)!3. I traded in an out for months after that and made a tidy sum! Bought my kid a new car!4. I bought back in to hold, over twice as many shares as i had before the fall.5. I own no funds, no bonds, no crypto, only individual stocks.. About 15 in total. In serious violation of the mystery 1% rule! 6. If NRZ dividend gets to $2 again, I will probably just quit working!Good day! NRZ long and strong since the beginning! (acutally well before the beginning for NRZ)!"

"I hate to see this message board turn into a DB Tuna bashfest. I imagine he loves that! He is not worth talking about. Can we just let it go,and move on?"
Why no announcement on the stock dividend??? They announced the preferred stock dividends 6 days ago.
Check out today's very positive article on NRZ on the back page!!
"Buddy asked me what to invest $1000 in.. Of course I had to tell him that any financial advisor would make him buy 100 different stocks, all under $10 each so he does not break the cardinal rule of no more than 1% in any 1 equity! They all say that, look it up!"
See y'all at ZERO and BK!
"CEO comment on included in today's earnings:“Ahead of the unprecedented volatility in March 2020, our Company was positioned for a very strong first quarter,"" said Michael Nierenberg, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President of New Residential. ""The world changed swiftly following our investor update on March 13, 2020. Subsequent to that update, asset values in the mortgage market went into free fall as liquidity left the system. In response, we sold down approximately $27.9 billion in assets and significantly de-leveraged our balance sheet. Our investment portfolio as of April 30, 2020 is 61% smaller than it was on December 31, 2019, which we believe puts us in a strong position to navigate the current and forward environment.(3) Importantly, we have continued to bolster our capital position and improve financing capacity; as of April 30, 2020, we have an estimated $517.3 million in cash and $397.4 million in unencumbered assets.(4) In particular, we have increased our advance financing capacity up to approximately $5.25 billion.(5) Looking ahead, our investment strategy will be to target assets that are term financed or low leverage. Our primary focus will be on our operating business, which includes our mortgage origination, servicing and ancillary service business lines. We believe that in today’s low interest rate environment, these businesses are particularly well-positioned to contribute to our profitability. We intend to support our investments, be opportunistic, and continue to do all we can to generate returns for our shareholders. We look forward to growing book value and returning our Company to normalcy.”"
My thinking on going with another Preferred offering now and in the future is this.It will strengthen the Common. Why? Because shareholders know the likelihood of another large SPO has been greatly diminished. Cost of fresh capital almost reduced by 50%. With the same returns of 15-20%. That's a big plus. Shareholders level of confidence increases because the perceived dilutive impact on their holdings is gone.
I'm out. Tired of the constant dilution. Split the money into CIM and AGNC. Thanks for the tip on those.

"NomuraBrief clip from today's 10-page PDF by Matthew Howlett at Nomura.... We Expect $0.50 Quarterly Dividend to Be Maintained: In terms of the dividend, wesee no changes in the company’s $0.50 p/s run rate for the next 12 months. However,we did take note of CEO Nierenberg’s (at least in our view) lukewarm response in termsof committing to it long term. Part of this could just be from fatigue at it relates to marketappreciation (the stock trades at a 13% yield vs. 10.5% for other non-agency hybridREITs). In addition, we believe the company is moving in the direction where it will haveto either convert to a C-corp or spin off certain operating segments. Nevertheless,management clearly stated on the call that it is their intention to grow core earningsabove the 3Q19 $0.50 p/s run rate."

Additionally, we expect management to provide someadditional color around the recently proposed IPO of the origination and servicing businesses,as the company looks to unlock value of these businesses. While details are limited, pleasesee our November 20 note for additional information on this transaction."

NRZ total return (Capital gain + Dividends) for the year has improved substantially. It's now 11.17% which is great. It should improve further over the remaining 4 months of this year.
