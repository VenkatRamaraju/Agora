"Glacier Bank is fortunate to have branches strictly in rural states that everyone is moving to during this crisis.I’m in Montana (founded in my hometown), and MT is BOOMING during COVID. Huge influx of rich out of staters moving in. Their revenues will continue to skyrocket with many purchases of homes and rich individuals moving in; they’re protected from the downfall many banks in larger cities may face."

I believe there may be a possible take over in the making. The P/E ratio is way to high for smaller banking stocks. I am looking for a price jump if a take over is in the making. It has been a very good stock to hold and I plan to continue holding.

"GBCI is a good pick for long-term growth. If you are looking for a small-cap growth bank stock, then check out Oregon Bancorp (ORBN). This stock is growing fast and is very undervalued on and EPS basis."

"Glacier is a good stock for the long haul. However, if anyone is looking for a rapidly growing bank stock at a cheap valuation, then check out Oregon Bancorp. ORBN has been growing like a weed and is selling for only 6 times this years EPS estimate of $5.00 per share. Normally a ROA figure of 1.0 for a bank stock is great. ORBN has a ROA of 4. The stock price has been moving steadily upward, but has way more room to run on the upside. This bank stock has only 1.1 million shares outstanding, making it a small-cap growth stock. The average bank stock is selling for over a 15 PE ratio, while this one is selling for less than half that. I have been gradually been buying shares for the better part of a year now. This is a long-term holding for my portfolio."
