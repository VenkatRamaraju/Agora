"$NBAC Just out: ""Reportedly White House is working on a $3Tspending proposal for infrastructure, climate change, education, and workforce development - NYT""Hard to believe that the market still does not realize yet that NBAC, tomorrow $NVVE is one of the best ways to play this bill. Gov wants chargers, 500k EV school buses by 2030, & V2G. Nuvve is in the sweet spot for all three. Best V2G tech. Partners with Blue Bird $BLBDwhich currently has ~30% of entire school bus market & 50% of EV school bus market. Nuvve is also partners with Lion Electric $NGA which is planning 20k school buses a year. By 2030 Nuvve could have 250k+ school buses on its V2G utility network. Every Lion, BlueB bus fleet sold, Nuvve comes with it. To comprehend how much 250k is, 50B $. Now add in gov fleets, garbage trucks, robo taxi fleets. The gov fleets like school will get funded first, which means Nuvve, not SNPR, CHPT, CLII, BLNK. Yet Nuvve is projecting similar #'s yet trades 7x+ cheaper right now.Post by SPACtori from stocktwits"

Any one know why the debt is still so high? Looks like most of it was carried over with the initial acquisition. Seems to be a great value EV play like GM compared to bubbles like GP AYRO SOLO etc...

This a short term problem--good opportunity to reenter at lower prices then has been available in some time. $20 or so looks decent spot IMO
"With the disappointing outlook and revised earnings, BLBD will be below 20 soon. I will look to buy then. No reason to rush into this stock..."
Blue Bird reached a 52 Week high at 24.07
Assume they will be mentioning the strength of the EV side of the business. Could be a very good % move on the news with continuing improvement in the virus with buses back on the road. Real company with real earnings--is the much better choice for investment than the WKHS/GP's with little to no revenue.

"My price target for the medium turn is:3.000 electric buses = 1B turnover.+ 3.000 normale buses = 1B turnover.Totaal 2B turnover.EBITDA 10% = 200M * 10 = 2B marketcap = pricetarget 75 dollar.For the long turn my price target is even higher. I think 3.000 electric buses is just the beginning, when you want to replace 500.000 school buses in 5 year (ambition Biden)!"
BLBD is down 5.71% to 16.03
Here we go hopefully she keeps going up
"This has so much potential. It's market cap is 10% of Proterra's $ACTC and Lion Electric's $NGA. Yet $BLBD has already revenues of 1 billion, positive EBIT, large market share... incredible, this should easily double. Totally overlooked!!!"
"Guys I just joined you and bought 1600 shares ... this stock is a gold mine , real EV unlike other fake EV player with Billions of market cap.....extremely undervalued, I would say strong buy"
"Look at the huge news today on this emerging ELECTRIC bus company…BUS.V (BUSXF in the US). This company (Grande West) has a BMW partnered EV bus, has $50MM in back orders, has growing sales and contracts, will be profitable during the first couple of quarters of 2021, insiders own 30% and have been adding 800,000+ to their share count over the past year, is getting up-listed to the NASDAQ soon, has a desired goal to be a $1 billion company and is severely undervalued versus it's competition (with only a $240MM market cap). The share price is going to fly in the coming days and will easily be a 4x-5x bagger by the end of the year and that’s no exaggeration. This is a hidden gem that is just now starting to get noticed by the investing public (which has been the only thing holding this back from flying higher).https://finance.yahoo.com/news/grande-west-enters-strategic-u-133100000.html"

"Now, when it comes to our capacity, we can scale up pretty easily. The 1000 units I talked about before were very much it was school buses in mind, but we have a lot of [Indiscernible] capacity. And we're able to ramp up very easily with well over that number when we get the demand for it."

BLBD is up because market is looking for similar companies to Proterra an electric bus maker that is coming public thru ACTC.Proterra will trade at around 1.6b cap...or about 3x BLBD cap.BLBD is by far the much stronger company. 900m revs....44 eps last q. BLBD owns 59% of the us electric school bus market.Said another way...BLBD could double to 43 and still be 500m cheaper than Proterra.thats not going to last. blbd will be taken up

Bogus pre-arranged trades that do not allow the average trader to execute! Market makers should be investigated. I have been saying this since 1996--crazy nothing gets done that helps the average investor.

They bought only to sell now. Now it’s being shorted. What an unnecessary pump.
BLBD is down 5.66% to 14.01
There's competition. That's a good thing.
LION ELECRIC LEV is a much better buy in my opinion....with all of the expansion in play. Thoughts?
Thinking about hoping in here before earnings. Any thoughts?

I feel good backing a school bus company!
Huge W Stock Pattern with Volume Coming In over MACD
Did you know this is actually an EV spac? This and $BLBD are the only EV spacs that have close to 1 current sales/ev amd profitable.
Now you see why the vol spike--Seeking Alpha article but the market makers weren't ready for the positive order flow so they decided to spread the bid and ask--execute the pre-arranged orders/take the other side and then push it down to make a profit on what otherwise would have lifted the stock higher. Comments market makers??
I’m super long this but what is missing? This Company is profitable does billions in revenue and only 500 million market cap
Single best idea in the EV space that provides on going revenues in a real business!!

"This hidden gem in the ELECTRIC bus segment is on the move (ticker is BUSXF or BUS.V in Canada). The share price is starting to rise as the company has been severely undervalued (due to the lack of awareness). Here are some the key highlights about the company:- They are delivering one bus a day to customers at $500,000 apiece (CEO confirmed last week)…- P/S: 5 (which is extremely low)- Will have over $50MM in revenues in the first half of 2021…- Already profitable for the year (since their breakeven is 100 units which they have already confirmed that they have reached for the year)…- Partnered with BMW to develop their ELECTRIC bus, has already sold this electric bus and is officially rolling it out now…- Stated goal to be a $1 billion company in terms of sales…when using a 3x-5x multiple for market cap, then this translates into a share price of $35 - $58 per share (right now the share price is $3)- Want to get 90% of their future revenues from the US and 10% from Canada (right now it is the reverse)…- Market cap is only $250MM…- Sells mid-sized heavy duty buses (which have higher margins)…- Is a long-time, established bus company which has successfully built and sold buses for years…- Will get future sales from existing customers (in addition to new customers)…- Has a diversified product offering (Electric, CNG and clean diesel)…- Is getting listed on the NASDAQ soon which will attract more exposure, investors and institutional investment going forward…- Can produce up to 600 buses per year from their Canadian plant and will be able to produce another 1000 out of its’ plant in the US which is being built in Washington state (at roughly $500,000 apiece)…- Insiders own 30% of the outstanding shares and have been bought over 800,000 just in the last 12 months…Easy money at these levels."

"Anyone know why were up after hours? Connor Invests on YT, only person covering the stock right now, sleeping giant!"

someone should move to have management replaced. They have totally destroyed shareholder wealth with a bbk at $26 only to watch the stock dip to $16 in the same month. Shame on them!
Sold my blbd and add more BUSXF - Grande West Transportation Group Inc
"Wholly #$%$ Robin, what just happened"
"Blue Bird has solid finances and, unlike most trendy stocks today, trades at give-away prices. For example, free-cash-flow (FCF), according to numbers supplied here by Yahoo, is $2.15 per share. This means BLBD is trading at 9.9 times FCF. That is shocking for a company with rapidly increasing sales, great earnings, and the potential to expand its sales in a massive way with its EV busses."

"""of which $2.5 billion is dedicated 100% to electric powered buses. This could fund between 25,000 to 30,000 electric school buses over the next few years.""""and with less than 20% of schools districts having purchased an alternative power school bus, we have plenty of runway ahead of continued growth.""""While on a trailing 12 months basis through May, based on R.L. Polk registrations, electric school bus market share in North America was an outstanding 68%. This compares to 37% market share just last year, so I'm really pleased with our growth trajectory.""The future is bright..."
Old high 26.88--no reason to not reach and go higher. It's valuation compared to others in space is much lower with much room to grow.$30.00
