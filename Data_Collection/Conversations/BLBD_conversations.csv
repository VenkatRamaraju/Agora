"Anyone know why were up after hours? Connor Invests on YT, only person covering the stock right now, sleeping giant!"
watch the volume.blbd is secerely undervalued vs its peers. that will not last.there will be a 1m volume day soon...and it will jump 6-8 points.
"This has so much potential. It's market cap is 10% of Proterra's $ACTC and Lion Electric's $NGA. Yet $BLBD has already revenues of 1 billion, positive EBIT, large market share... incredible, this should easily double. Totally overlooked!!!"
Nice to see the stock is finally really noticed as the premier EV play

"This hidden gem in the ELECTRIC bus segment is on the move (ticker is BUSXF or BUS.V in Canada). The share price is starting to rise as the company has been severely undervalued (due to the lack of awareness). Here are some the key highlights about the company:- They are delivering one bus a day to customers at $500,000 apiece (CEO confirmed last week)…- P/S: 5 (which is extremely low)- Will have over $50MM in revenues in the first half of 2021…- Already profitable for the year (since their breakeven is 100 units which they have already confirmed that they have reached for the year)…- Partnered with BMW to develop their ELECTRIC bus, has already sold this electric bus and is officially rolling it out now…- Stated goal to be a $1 billion company in terms of sales…when using a 3x-5x multiple for market cap, then this translates into a share price of $35 - $58 per share (right now the share price is $3)- Want to get 90% of their future revenues from the US and 10% from Canada (right now it is the reverse)…- Market cap is only $250MM…- Sells mid-sized heavy duty buses (which have higher margins)…- Is a long-time, established bus company which has successfully built and sold buses for years…- Will get future sales from existing customers (in addition to new customers)…- Has a diversified product offering (Electric, CNG and clean diesel)…- Is getting listed on the NASDAQ soon which will attract more exposure, investors and institutional investment going forward…- Can produce up to 600 buses per year from their Canadian plant and will be able to produce another 1000 out of its’ plant in the US which is being built in Washington state (at roughly $500,000 apiece)…- Insiders own 30% of the outstanding shares and have been bought over 800,000 just in the last 12 months…Easy money at these levels."
my guess is this run is in anticipation of biden ev bus deal announced
"Look at the huge news today on this emerging ELECTRIC bus company…BUS.V (BUSXF in the US). This company (Grande West) has a BMW partnered EV bus, has $50MM in back orders, has growing sales and contracts, will be profitable during the first couple of quarters of 2021, insiders own 30% and have been adding 800,000+ to their share count over the past year, is getting up-listed to the NASDAQ soon, has a desired goal to be a $1 billion company and is severely undervalued versus it's competition (with only a $240MM market cap). The share price is going to fly in the coming days and will easily be a 4x-5x bagger by the end of the year and that’s no exaggeration. This is a hidden gem that is just now starting to get noticed by the investing public (which has been the only thing holding this back from flying higher).https://finance.yahoo.com/news/grande-west-enters-strategic-u-133100000.html"
"$NBAC Just out: ""Reportedly White House is working on a $3Tspending proposal for infrastructure, climate change, education, and workforce development - NYT""Hard to believe that the market still does not realize yet that NBAC, tomorrow $NVVE is one of the best ways to play this bill. Gov wants chargers, 500k EV school buses by 2030, & V2G. Nuvve is in the sweet spot for all three. Best V2G tech. Partners with Blue Bird $BLBDwhich currently has ~30% of entire school bus market & 50% of EV school bus market. Nuvve is also partners with Lion Electric $NGA which is planning 20k school buses a year. By 2030 Nuvve could have 250k+ school buses on its V2G utility network. Every Lion, BlueB bus fleet sold, Nuvve comes with it. To comprehend how much 250k is, 50B $. Now add in gov fleets, garbage trucks, robo taxi fleets. The gov fleets like school will get funded first, which means Nuvve, not SNPR, CHPT, CLII, BLNK. Yet Nuvve is projecting similar #'s yet trades 7x+ cheaper right now.Post by SPACtori from stocktwits"
weather channel interview with CEO Blue Bird on electric school busses.
"With the disappointing outlook and revised earnings, BLBD will be below 20 soon. I will look to buy then. No reason to rush into this stock..."
Down over 12%. Anybody out there know what happened. Can't find anything that explains the drop.
blbd at 500m cap is the cheapest ev. and see mgt spac comments in dec 17 cc
LION ELECRIC LEV is a much better buy in my opinion....with all of the expansion in play. Thoughts?
"""of which $2.5 billion is dedicated 100% to electric powered buses. This could fund between 25,000 to 30,000 electric school buses over the next few years.""""and with less than 20% of schools districts having purchased an alternative power school bus, we have plenty of runway ahead of continued growth.""""While on a trailing 12 months basis through May, based on R.L. Polk registrations, electric school bus market share in North America was an outstanding 68%. This compares to 37% market share just last year, so I'm really pleased with our growth trajectory.""The future is bright..."
This a short term problem--good opportunity to reenter at lower prices then has been available in some time. $20 or so looks decent spot IMO

Are there any Electric Drive conversion kits/competition for school buses or will the only option be new purchase of Electric Blue Bird buses ?
BLBD is up because market is looking for similar companies to Proterra an electric bus maker that is coming public thru ACTC.Proterra will trade at around 1.6b cap...or about 3x BLBD cap.BLBD is by far the much stronger company. 900m revs....44 eps last q. BLBD owns 59% of the us electric school bus market.Said another way...BLBD could double to 43 and still be 500m cheaper than Proterra.thats not going to last. blbd will be taken up
"Blue Bird has solid finances and, unlike most trendy stocks today, trades at give-away prices. For example, free-cash-flow (FCF), according to numbers supplied here by Yahoo, is $2.15 per share. This means BLBD is trading at 9.9 times FCF. That is shocking for a company with rapidly increasing sales, great earnings, and the potential to expand its sales in a massive way with its EV busses."
