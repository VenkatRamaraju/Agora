This stock is just late to the party. It’s going to rally.
"Wow, what's going on. Shorts covering?"
Las Vegas Sands stock price target cut to $46 from $65 at UBS8:30am ET 10/21/2021 MarketWatchGuys the banks are dropping valuations by 30%
"This is the best article I've seen regarding the Macau regulatory situation, he breaks it down objectively.https://www.asgam.com/index.php/2021/09/16/opinion-irrational-panic-wipes-26-us18-4-billion-off-macau-operators-market-cap-yesterday/$LVS $MGM $MLCO $WYNN"
Don’t mind seeing this drop to $30 loading it up. I doubt we see it open red but future is all I care. Show me the money. Vegas reviving and will be top destinations for people to visit and invest in
"Better Day Today, But Under Performed WYNN. MGM Hit A 52 Week HIGH Today ! I Listened to a GREAT Podcast on LVS. I Didn't Realize How Much DIFFERENCE There Is Between CHINA and MACAU. I thoughtthey were the same. There are HUGE Differences. If anyone wants to go listen, let me know,I'll go back and figure out how I found it. It was an Asian Expert giving commentary on MACAU.It was VERY Informative and VERY Bullish for Casino stocks.."
"The stock market is a forward looking mechanism. This stock has been sold repeatedly on the same news, the world hysteria on the pandemic.Looking forward, the revenue will improve, COVID numbers are microscopic in Macau and Singapore.Chinese and other south Asians will gamble more when the borders are opened, IT HAPPENED AT EVERY CASINO IN THE WORLD WHEN COVID RESTRICTIONS WERE LOWERED OR LIFTED.Good time to add!"
All the Hedge Funds added big positions in there portfolio.
"Its amazing that Macau can test 700k people in 2 days yet their vaccination rate is only 50%. The ""Zero Tolerance"" polices will continue to be in place until they reach 80%. Maybe if the Macau govt didn't force the casino operator to pay their employees regardless of working, more people would get the vaccine and the recovery there would begin?"
"Pay attention guys. Marina Bay Sands Singapore is Sand's most profitable casino and notice it says "" Travellers from Hong Kong, Macau, mainland China and Taiwan only need to undergo a PCR test on arrival and are free to move about if the result is negative"" https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/singapore-eases-border-restrictions-for-travellers-from-countries-such-as-poland"
"Time to get a reverse mortgage to steal LVS according SA:My projections arrive at achieving 2019 revenues market-wide at 2019 baseline in 2022 with 2Q22 beginning to show a speeding ramp for LVS and the market in general. However, the true depth of pent-up demand is yet to be tested.https://seekingalpha.com/article/4458923-las-vegas-sands-bears-have-traded-it-down-to-a-screaming-buy"
"Come on in, only 50%+ upside to go, waters warm"
Geez Jimmy take a xanny and chill.
Stench.
LVS dreamers don't realize Macau and HK under de facto military rule. Covid is used as the cover.
"In a recent report, it said Singapore.leads the way as air travel in Asia picks up the pace."
"Yesterday, at a Goldman Sachs investors meeting, the management of SJM Holdings said they feel comfortable with the fact that its concession license will be renewed for 10 years. SJM Holdings operates 9 casinos and 2 hotels in Macau."
"Tony and Taffy working OT for $3 downside possibly while I keep adding to my June calls with $30 upside, wonder who pays these stiffs to stick around after the initial FUD drop."
This stock will definitely recover. It has the most revenue stream and a strong balance sheet. I keep on buying.
Beginning of the run...
"Hi Jimmy. How about my LVS prediction of $38.25? Skippy was right again. Of course, during the past two weeks, LVS was above $38.25 on multiple occasions. Lol. And as for your implied $30. prediction, it may be a long time coming. Lol."
I hope some buyers come into this stock. It’s super shorted.
"LVS needs to stop Macau bleeding. Cash won't last at this rate.Net loss for SCL was $423 million, compared to $562 million in the third quarter of 2020"
"2 min ceo overview, no coo commentary and onto q&a...oh boy..."
"It’s tanking worse than after earnings. All eyes on $35 for a technical breakdown. You might ask why. Sometimes funds give the stock a day or 2 to digest news. This suggests there is some fear in LVS. I’m not saying the stock is going to collapse, I’m saying that money is better kept elsewhere"
Huge call volumes going into next week....
"So, I got the make up of people playing this stock now. You are all gamblers or ex gamblers, so losing or winning 20% is nothing to you. We are going for the BIG one, right? 2x or 3x your money. Yes.. I've managed to profile all of you already!!! Be warned, you have been found out!!! ;)"
"Can you imagine the FOMO investors will have when the Golden Week Holiday GGR numbers come out from Macau in early October? Analysts are expecting October to have the highest GGR number of the year. This is the easiest swing in the market, I prefer LVS and WYNN.$LVS $WYNN $MGM $MLCO"
"Sands is in Singapore too which is their most profitable casino and that country is neutral, like Switzerland. The government takes a levy from all the citizens who visit the casino. Foreigners/tourists enter for free. The Singapore government also gets lots of profits from their revenue. It is very important to Singapore. The Sands building is kinda like a national treasure. I don't see them failing. That is why this stock is a no brainer. If we have large positions here , we can day trade it too but I think shorts ought to be very careful. Don't forget to use tight limit stops ;)"
Great interview CEO of WYNN on Mad Money. Encouraging to hear from someone that has actually read and understands what is being requested of these gaming institutions in Macau. The sky is not falling folks.
"Morning Homegamers.....Looking Good Pre Market. Hopefully, We Can Have A MeaningfulRally In The Next Week Or So, From These OVERSOLD Levels.."
Things are much stronger at Windham Hotels than pre-pandemic. Imagine what the demand REALLY is for LVS properties when criminal governments will stop interfering. The pent up demand will be mind boggling!
"Well the Motley did it today. Just a few hours ago, it issued an article entitled ""is Las Vegas Sands about to become an unstoppable growth stock? It sure looks like it. Lol. Hi Taffy. Lol."
"These results are very very BAD people. You are in denial. Please look at the revenue, it DOWN from the prior quarters. Operating loss was way DOWN from prior quarters as was Net Loss. It’s cheaper to shut the hotels than to operate them. Also, the price of electricity is up big in China so they’re going to incur major losses from all those lights and air conditioning."
"This past September, New Jersey was the first state ever to record $1B in revenue from sports betting. This amount included revenue from race tracks."
"I am the same as many . Don't care even if it drops. I've lost enough money in their casinos in the past to know they always win.. yes, they will win again."
"Casinos will be cancelled in China like English, games ...... Xi likes working not gaming"
Lets gamble!
Whoa!
quick move to 45 then on to 50. shorts in trouble
LVS all their eggs in the CHINA basket. Sounds like China is about to lock down again and with US China tensions high wouldn't be out of question for US companies to be punished as an excuse. MGM is a better US Vegas play than LVS specially since MGM has betmgm and LVS has nothing for sports betting.
I heard about LVS the other day on (http://Multistockalerts.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
Bought shares at 38.50 in aftermarket. Revenues are increasing. Pandemic is done. Keep buying. Keep holding. Next stop $50.
Analysts today upgraded price target to 57.5 
"I'm a little suprised this stock didn't poop the bed after that dumpster fire earnings report. I guess most longs are like me, holding at depressed values knowing this can't go on for ever. I just hope it doesn't go much lower than this. When I bought it I was looking for a quick turn. I wasn't expecting to hold the bagger for a year or two."
"Overheard on the news that Macau and Singapore properties just started turning positive, Q4 would be better."
Walk street just waiting for that hint of change and reopening on Macau So if mgt has anything positive to say on the call could reverse and head upResults were a lot worse last year in the middle of the pandemic and this was in mid 50 s Plus when they close on the sale of the Vegas properties net debt goes to just over 6 b which gives a ton of cash flow for investment and share buybacks Plus there is a wold card that gets bought by a Chinese company They want more Chinese presence and basically lvs has all the premier property in Macau Wouldn’t be surprised to get bought this year for 85 plus
"Macau taxi drivers making $20 everyday, down 90% from happy days."
"Holy Toledo, what has gotten into the gaming stocks today. All except MGM, the gaming stocks are roaring today. And look at LVS. It's up more than 4%. It could break 40 in a day or two. Lol. Did you get that Ben? Lol."
"Why is LVS so high.? Careful, tax Loss selling right around the corner"
Should have bought it in pre market
"Nearly 40% of LVS revenue comes from Singapore, the famous Marina Bay Sands is their most profitable casino by a long margin. Even with short-term uncertainty in Macau they’ll be completely fine. LVS has more then $6 billion dollars of cash to invest exclusively for expansion and growth opportunities. Management has said they can invest in online gambling, casinos in different states in the US, and expansion opportunities in different parts of Asia. I'm buying the nonsense fear."
Nothing is really happening for Lvs in China. They will renew there license and Covid will be over
Im green !! :)
Going long here.. At least a year..https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ef9A47GAgM
"Hmmmm. It was an interesting day for LVS. While volume was weak ahead of 3rd quarter earnings report, LVS did hold the 40 level. In fact, there was no major sell-off nor was there a major upswing. Maybe that's a tell."
"If keep 38 or above today, 44 next week"
"Guy Adami, has a target price of $56 per sharefor Christmas 2021."
"Singapore opened up the travel lane to Europe, US, Canada and Korea. Meaning Marina Bay Sands will benefit from it."
"I’m doing further research, in found out that analysts are expecting LVS to post positive earnings in Q1 2022. Honestly, I’m trying to save you guys money. Please please please ask yourself how a company is supposed to make money when the country they operate in will restrict travel over 1 yes 1 Covid case???In addition, there may be serious reprocusions if the junket crackdown applies to Macau. Essentially, it would mean no more steering the high rollers to Macau. I would imagine that they comprise a very significant portion of income."
"Just closed out my $39 calls for .12. Few minutes later this pops, don’t know why and don’t care"
"Good luck LVSFederal Communications Commission voted to force China Telecom, one of three leading communications providers in China, to close its U.S. business."
Does anyone miss leaning over a craps table?
"Homegamers..... I think LVS was the TOP Loser in the SP 500 Today. At least it was on Top of the listmost of the day.. I'm banking on the 'news' that finally comes out of China won't be near as bad as isbeing feared now. FEAR is the word.. I've traded stocks for 40 Plus years. I don't think the end resultof any regulation on the Casinos is going to be anything like the news that has destroyed the China educational sector stocks such as TAL and EDU. We'll see... Right now, IMO, The prices of Wynn (more exposure than LVS), and LVS, are pretty much already priced in a 'worst case scenario. We'll see, but I think this is a fabulous opportunity at these prices.. On ANY Positive News, These stocks will Jump 15% in minutes..... I've got my money where my mouth is... LONG 19,500 Shares...."
call buyer bets 3.41million on mar22 42 calls.
It's a big day for LVS today. It's up almost 5%. Sweet. Lol.
lvs wont stay in 30s for long. Its headed higher. yesterday was a gift
Wells Fargo Just INITIATED COVERAGE.....Equal Weight..... $50 Price Target.$50 looks Good To ME !
Why does Yahoo finance still state that LVS owns and operates the Venetian Las Vegas in the description details?
I decided to go loooong.. Don't care if it drops. It is safer than Shiba Inu for an ex gambler. GLTAhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KePhPqilc20
"The Lohr Group, adding to their position."
"realistically given the long list of unknowns for this company in Asia, arguably it should trade with a 20 handle"
"Earnings: Big miss on revenue and eps! Not even close! Continuing COVID restrictions are an ongoing issue, not to mention questions surrounding gaming license. Looking to see a test of the recent 35-36 low before playing the Jan / March 2022 call options game. GLTA"
Is the earnings report before or after the bell tomorrow?
"Something smells fishy from here. The Chinese got rid of COVID-19 last year. Why are they taking years to go back to the casinos and how many quarters can the company burn cash? Also, with the energy crisis in Asia, what will happen to overhead costs?"
Great Buying Opportunity.
"Do some research people. LVS sold the Venetian, Palazo, and expo center, as others have stated. It's not an opinion, it's a fact. Simply google it for the details."
just hodl and relax. will pay off
Xi must have had my earlier post about reinstating Macau 14 day inbound and outbound quarantines taken down
"Hey Skip let’s see if you’ll put your money where your mouth is. On Jan 1, you buy $1,000 worth of LVS stock. I’ll buy $1,000 worth of WYNN, MGM or CZR. You can even pick which one. On Dec 31 whoever has the higher account balance gets both accounts."
"when all the macau casino licenses expire in june 2022, what happens if china decides to simply not allow for renewal or extension to the US based casinos? they've initiated the current 5 year plan which seems to include a lot of cultural cleansing for the good of common prosperity, and wiped out big tech (baba, didi), private educational tutoring systems (tal, edu), video games (tencent) stocks in the process. xi doesn't give a sxxt if any company, even chinese companies, get wiped out in the process. so, there is no other group that portrays the evils and sins of society more than casinos. if LVS loses its macau licenses, or have some heavy-handed regulations imposed on them, they have very little left, since exiting the las vegas markets. to a slightly lesser degree wynn and melco have the same concerns. in the meantime, mgm is flying."
CEO trying to equate Vegas recovery with Macau...I guess that's like saying China is as free and open as Vegas Baby! That should really scare the longs
"Ok, I won’t post here for a while. I just want to say one thing to anyone who is holding or buying LAs Vegas Sands: You may think that you’re buying a casino stock and casinos always make money. You are wrong. Casinos always make money but this company owns the whole package and the hotels and conference rooms that go with it. There are tremendous costs with keeping these properties in good condition with the lights on. So I’m selling for 3 reasons: 1. The post pandemic world won’t have the same type of in person conferences ever again. 2. There is an energy crisis getting worse in Asia and casinos are not going to be able to afford the energy bills. 3. The Chinese government is not to be trusted and have their hands in so many sectors and aren’t afraid to crush companies. They’ve already put Macau on notice."
"A lot of people will buy this stock and just leave it, knowing that it will go up. No brainer here. Shorties be careful."
"Many big events in 2022, zero-COVID policy and strict quarantine requirements guarantee LVS loss in Q4, Q1, Q2....."
"Homegamers....Ruff Thursday on Tap For Me Today.... My only 2 positions are:10,000 shares of LVS, and a Really Big one in ATT (T). I have 91,000 shares of that one..It's ASupposedly 'Defensive' stock. 'T' Also Down Today.. Looks Like A $17,000 'Haircut' In My AccountOn The Open... That's an Expensive and BAD Haircut.."
The Nio Man dude posted yesterday that LVS would test its 52 week low today. Well it seems to be going the other way today. Better luck next time dude. Lol.
"Unless you’re short, the trend has certainly not been your friend. Lower highs, lower Lows…still trading below the 50, 100 and 200 day ma. Next Q report is almost 3 months away. That’s a lot of time for the trend to continue. However, the options are still tradable. …stay thirsty my friendsGLTA"
Las Vegas Sands is up 4.91% to 40.94
"Hi Joe C. Remember when you posted last week saying that LVS would be at 30 on 9/30/21. Well how did that prediction work out? Hmmmm. Not so go good yesterday and certainly not good today. Oh well, you can always try again. LOL."
"LVS just announced that it would be releasing 3rd quarter earnings next Wednesday, 10/20/21."
"If for some reason the Venetian sale falls through, this company will need big loans and quick to keep operating. Think about how much interest they will be paying then! Right now it’s $500 million a year in interest they’re paying. Maybe it will go up to $1 billion? Idk"
"Xi will be very rational and passionate on US casinos according to Wall St. and CEO“Until proven wrong, I'm not and we're not overreacting to what is being hyped or said,” Hornbuckle said. “We are hoping rational minds control in the end because this is the Macau economy.”"
"Yoo-hoo Taffy. Remember when you posted yesterday: ""Maybe 30 or lower today"". Did you see the closing SP for LVS yesterday? I guess not. Let me tell you: $35.59. So much for your prediction."
"You bears are full of shyde,... Nonsensical. This is a world class Resort and Casino company with a tremendous legacy and a name that is worth it's weight in gold. Sheldon did not like online gaming but wait till the new leaders bring it on. Sands gaming online will be done properly! This stock will reach all time highs in the future"
"Time to buy LVS and MLCO, casino in macao got 166% profit."
Only two points matter from the callCEO says 0 chance of not renewing the license and when the tourism is allowed to flow back the pent up willlead to a very “powerful” rebound
LVS just broke through its 50 DMA.
"The SP of LVS has reacted very mysteriously. With such a disaster of an earnings report for the 3rd quarter, one would expect a dramatic selloff. And yet, the decline has been very muted. Now it could decline significantly in the future; but it doesn't appear that to be the case. The stock performance as of late has been very strange. Lol."
It’s pretty clear the pps is headed south. Only time and recent 35-36 support level would suggest how far in the short term. Earning were horrible and you heard nothing from the CC as to when business will improve. They simply don’t know! Too many variables to go long the stock here…IMO wait until it finds support. It’s gonna be a long 3 months until the next report. GLTA
6 to 12 month extensions on the Macau licenses might happen due to lack of progress on long term discussions.
"Guys, check out http://the-alphatrader.com/. They have been crushing it lately while LVS barley does anything at all."
in 4 days the 45 day review period is over. does anyone really expect positive wonderful news for a foreign-run casino from the chinese government regarding the sin of gambling?
CS should double LVS soon. What 1 do to max yr. end bonus.MGM Resorts International was rising Tuesday after shares of the casino operator were upgraded to Outperform from Neutral at Credit Suisse and the analysts boosted the stock’s price target to $68
"One poster named ""R"" said yesterday that LVS would go to $32 today. I wonder how that trade is doing today. I don't think too well. Lol."
@Skippy00823 good luck to you too.
"In a recent report by GGR Asia, it is expected there will 40,000 visitors to Macau daily during Golden Week."
"Time to cover, the short money has been made."
Reality for LVS longs will hit next Wednesday when they report Q3. It will be ugly and company will have very little to say about the forward outlook either. Sell ahead of the earnings call or expect pain.
"In a recent Barron's article, the author after consulting a number of analysts said that LVS and WYNN offer good upside potential for those investors who are patient and have sufficient resources to endure some downside risk."
Adjusted loss ($.045) vs ($.20) Est. Macau casinos are cash burn operations until the area gets COVID under control. Dead money til it's corrected
Yahoo! has been so bad lately - especially the LVS board. I like using http://alert-sounds.com/ now instead for my daily research.
"Jim Chanos, renowned short seller, just hammered the Macau casino stocks on CNBC ""Halftime Report"".Says WYNN worth 'south of $50 a share'. WYNN was up prior to this interview and now down nearly 3%."
In what way is a $59 price target bearish?
"A horrible thought just popped into my mind. What LVS decided to list on a foreign exchange? They've sold all their assets in the US, so why even stay listed here?"
Let’s see how low this goes but I am Buying here. Will see returns in the next quarter.
China is putting more restrictions on travel due to COVID and may be having more economic problems than they broadcast. Now Zacks says this is strong sell.. Remember when Cramer and the goons said casinos were a great buy a few weeks ago?? LOL. Would Cramer and the goons lie to us to make quick cash?? LOL
The reason LVS is lower today is due weak trading. Just look at the amount of volume today. It's anemic. 2. Also the entire gaming sector is lower today along with the entire travel group except airlines. 3. The looming U S. government shutdown is creating uncertainty too. 4. The disappointment in Golden Week this year is directly affecting the Macau casinos along with outbreaks of Covid in China.
"What a very strange day for LVS. Except for one or two, the hotel stocks are quite strong. On the otherhand, the casino stocks except for LVS are very muted. And LVS has continued to go higher throughout the entire day with no apparent news. Very strange. Oh well, I'll take it. Lol."
"Yesterday, Goldman Sachs reiterated its buy rating on LVS. It did reduce its price target for the stock from $68. to $67.. Lol."
"Dan Arnov, mentioned sale/lease backof some Las Vegas properties will yieldsignificant cash and will benefit bottom line."
Yoo hoo Skippy. What’s your genius call today?? I sure don’t see $38.25 lol.
Unusual bullish option activity.
LVS moving upward and higher quickly.
Yoo hoo Skippy. Earnings are not good. Congratulations you get to see $38.25 again.
2022 will be huge for LVS. Buy a ton and come back end of next year to collect. Just bought some and will not post again till I come back to collect.
"Hi, going back to mid 40s, ty"
"Hi Taffy. How's you prediction doing? I see it's not doing too well. Do you remember it? Two days ago, you said LVS would be $30. or less. Well, for your information, LVS is trading a lot higher today. Better luck next time. Lol."
"OMG ! I Thought I'd Be Down $40-$50,000 Today....Bought 10,000 Shares Yesterday @ 38.15....I Was Actually Briefly GREEN !!"
the bottom is in. 50 50 50
What is wrong with Tony? Did he lose a lot of money in Sands?
Macau announced suspension of restrictions for a number of businesses based on no new cases for the last 12 days. The true reopening getting closer.
"I still wouldn't buy this stock, but it is a good sign that it's only down 2% on such an awful report. The problem is that much of their revenue comes from China. If you want to bet on Vegas or the U.S., stick with mgm or czr."
"Matthew Lohr, loading up on LVS."
Please LVS. Can you just give me two up days in a row. Just once?!!
"So let me teach you something about investing. Get your calculator out and start understanding what is happening. First why sell of LVS propertys is a good think, revenues in 2019 were 610m they are selling for 6.1B, 10 ywars of revenue. Amazing deal, they gona use this cash to make new investments, buyback some shares becouse they will sit on almost 7.5B dollars in cash. Then we will have online investment starting to play opening londoneir in 2022 which will drive revenues. Macau and singapor will be back in 2022 why? Well becouse like you can see we will go out of pandemic officially, more and more countries are getting there. It will bw travell boom, already starting slowly. Macau license will be received but with 5-10 years of renewal. Talk about ebita to enterprise value is always bettwen 10-12x. So if we exclude macau and lvs that give us if we will be back on 2019 lvl or we can even take 20% less give you of about 8-10B so after some calculations you get 36% up from this stock price without excluding what i just said. Catalysts from now on can be only positive, we had divirgens and all bad news are already priced in that why we see low decline. I bought at 36-37 lvl and I will be buying more. Markets are discounting future growth and this is when you get the best deals. Now tell me if i am wrong thank you."
LVS is really becoming spooky just before Halloween. Lol.
"A strong day for LVS today on heavy volume. And my prediction was right. It's in the green and at $38.25. OK, OK, it's a little higher than my prediction right now. Lol."
Lvs is down 38% for the Q3. This will go up Q4. Just have to hold
I'm always amused when a guy like Kennedy shows up on this MB who has never been here before. He then pumps LVS wildly and rapidly while insulting other posters who may disagree with him. And then the guy uses fictitious posters to give thumbs down for only those posters that have disagreed with him and he has insulted. Now that is really strange behavior. He must be a sneaky Joe.
