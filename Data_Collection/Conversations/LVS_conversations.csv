"The stock market is a forward looking mechanism. This stock has been sold repeatedly on the same news, the world hysteria on the pandemic.Looking forward, the revenue will improve, COVID numbers are microscopic in Macau and Singapore.Chinese and other south Asians will gamble more when the borders are opened, IT HAPPENED AT EVERY CASINO IN THE WORLD WHEN COVID RESTRICTIONS WERE LOWERED OR LIFTED.Good time to add!"
"Good luck LVSFederal Communications Commission voted to force China Telecom, one of three leading communications providers in China, to close its U.S. business."
"What a very strange day for LVS. Except for one or two, the hotel stocks are quite strong. On the otherhand, the casino stocks except for LVS are very muted. And LVS has continued to go higher throughout the entire day with no apparent news. Very strange. Oh well, I'll take it. Lol."
6 to 12 month extensions on the Macau licenses might happen due to lack of progress on long term discussions.
"Hey Skip let’s see if you’ll put your money where your mouth is. On Jan 1, you buy $1,000 worth of LVS stock. I’ll buy $1,000 worth of WYNN, MGM or CZR. You can even pick which one. On Dec 31 whoever has the higher account balance gets both accounts."
Walk street just waiting for that hint of change and reopening on Macau So if mgt has anything positive to say on the call could reverse and head upResults were a lot worse last year in the middle of the pandemic and this was in mid 50 s Plus when they close on the sale of the Vegas properties net debt goes to just over 6 b which gives a ton of cash flow for investment and share buybacks Plus there is a wold card that gets bought by a Chinese company They want more Chinese presence and basically lvs has all the premier property in Macau Wouldn’t be surprised to get bought this year for 85 plus
Don’t mind seeing this drop to $30 loading it up. I doubt we see it open red but future is all I care. Show me the money. Vegas reviving and will be top destinations for people to visit and invest in
Macau announced suspension of restrictions for a number of businesses based on no new cases for the last 12 days. The true reopening getting closer.
"Owen Butcher, has target price of $48 per share onLVS."
"Guy Adami, has a target price of $56 per sharefor Christmas 2021."
in 4 days the 45 day review period is over. does anyone really expect positive wonderful news for a foreign-run casino from the chinese government regarding the sin of gambling?
This stock is just late to the party. It’s going to rally.
"Xi will be very rational and passionate on US casinos according to Wall St. and CEO“Until proven wrong, I'm not and we're not overreacting to what is being hyped or said,” Hornbuckle said. “We are hoping rational minds control in the end because this is the Macau economy.”"
"So let me teach you something about investing. Get your calculator out and start understanding what is happening. First why sell of LVS propertys is a good think, revenues in 2019 were 610m they are selling for 6.1B, 10 ywars of revenue. Amazing deal, they gona use this cash to make new investments, buyback some shares becouse they will sit on almost 7.5B dollars in cash. Then we will have online investment starting to play opening londoneir in 2022 which will drive revenues. Macau and singapor will be back in 2022 why? Well becouse like you can see we will go out of pandemic officially, more and more countries are getting there. It will bw travell boom, already starting slowly. Macau license will be received but with 5-10 years of renewal. Talk about ebita to enterprise value is always bettwen 10-12x. So if we exclude macau and lvs that give us if we will be back on 2019 lvl or we can even take 20% less give you of about 8-10B so after some calculations you get 36% up from this stock price without excluding what i just said. Catalysts from now on can be only positive, we had divirgens and all bad news are already priced in that why we see low decline. I bought at 36-37 lvl and I will be buying more. Markets are discounting future growth and this is when you get the best deals. Now tell me if i am wrong thank you."
2022 will be huge for LVS. Buy a ton and come back end of next year to collect. Just bought some and will not post again till I come back to collect.
call buyer bets 3.41million on mar22 42 calls.
Only two points matter from the callCEO says 0 chance of not renewing the license and when the tourism is allowed to flow back the pent up willlead to a very “powerful” rebound
"This past September, New Jersey was the first state ever to record $1B in revenue from sports betting. This amount included revenue from race tracks."
@Skippy00823 good luck to you too.
CS should double LVS soon. What 1 do to max yr. end bonus.MGM Resorts International was rising Tuesday after shares of the casino operator were upgraded to Outperform from Neutral at Credit Suisse and the analysts boosted the stock’s price target to $68
"Dan Arnov, mentioned sale/lease backof some Las Vegas properties will yieldsignificant cash and will benefit bottom line."
LVS moving upward and higher quickly.
Does anyone miss leaning over a craps table?
"The SP of LVS has reacted very mysteriously. With such a disaster of an earnings report for the 3rd quarter, one would expect a dramatic selloff. And yet, the decline has been very muted. Now it could decline significantly in the future; but it doesn't appear that to be the case. The stock performance as of late has been very strange. Lol."
"Holy Toledo, what has gotten into the gaming stocks today. All except MGM, the gaming stocks are roaring today. And look at LVS. It's up more than 4%. It could break 40 in a day or two. Lol. Did you get that Ben? Lol."
Things are much stronger at Windham Hotels than pre-pandemic. Imagine what the demand REALLY is for LVS properties when criminal governments will stop interfering. The pent up demand will be mind boggling!
"I am the same as many . Don't care even if it drops. I've lost enough money in their casinos in the past to know they always win.. yes, they will win again."
Great Buying Opportunity.
quick move to 45 then on to 50. shorts in trouble
"Yesterday, Goldman Sachs reiterated its buy rating on LVS. It did reduce its price target for the stock from $68. to $67.. Lol."
"Tony and Taffy working OT for $3 downside possibly while I keep adding to my June calls with $30 upside, wonder who pays these stiffs to stick around after the initial FUD drop."
"So, I got the make up of people playing this stock now. You are all gamblers or ex gamblers, so losing or winning 20% is nothing to you. We are going for the BIG one, right? 2x or 3x your money. Yes.. I've managed to profile all of you already!!! Be warned, you have been found out!!! ;)"
"when all the macau casino licenses expire in june 2022, what happens if china decides to simply not allow for renewal or extension to the US based casinos? they've initiated the current 5 year plan which seems to include a lot of cultural cleansing for the good of common prosperity, and wiped out big tech (baba, didi), private educational tutoring systems (tal, edu), video games (tencent) stocks in the process. xi doesn't give a sxxt if any company, even chinese companies, get wiped out in the process. so, there is no other group that portrays the evils and sins of society more than casinos. if LVS loses its macau licenses, or have some heavy-handed regulations imposed on them, they have very little left, since exiting the las vegas markets. to a slightly lesser degree wynn and melco have the same concerns. in the meantime, mgm is flying."
"I'm a little suprised this stock didn't poop the bed after that dumpster fire earnings report. I guess most longs are like me, holding at depressed values knowing this can't go on for ever. I just hope it doesn't go much lower than this. When I bought it I was looking for a quick turn. I wasn't expecting to hold the bagger for a year or two."
"Many big events in 2022, zero-COVID policy and strict quarantine requirements guarantee LVS loss in Q4, Q1, Q2....."
"The reason for the LVS SP spike yesterday was an unconfirmed report that LVS is in talks with Steve Cohen, CEO of Mets to put a casino at Citifield, NYC."
What is wrong with Tony? Did he lose a lot of money in Sands?
Bought shares at 38.50 in aftermarket. Revenues are increasing. Pandemic is done. Keep buying. Keep holding. Next stop $50.
just hodl and relax. will pay off
"Well the Motley did it today. Just a few hours ago, it issued an article entitled ""is Las Vegas Sands about to become an unstoppable growth stock? It sure looks like it. Lol. Hi Taffy. Lol."
