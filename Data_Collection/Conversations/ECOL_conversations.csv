"Itronics 2009 Limited Edition of Its Popular Collectible 5-Troy Ounce Silver Nevada Miner Bars Now AvailableBrought Back Due to Increasing Requests from Collectors and InvestorsRENO, Nev., Feb. 05, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Itronics Inc. (OTC:ITRO), an “Innovative Zero Waste” Technology Company that produces GOLD’n GRO fertilizers and silver products, today reported that its popular 2009 Limited Edition Silver Nevada Miner bars, an excellent collectible and a souvenir of the Silver State, are now available through its subsidiary, Itronics Metallurgical, Inc. Order by calling Itronics Metallurgical, Inc. at 1-800-368-1865.“The 99.9 percent pure, 5-troy ounce silver bar is one of the most attractive being manufactured and marketed in the United States today and is a unique and beautiful collectible,” said Dr. John Whitney, Itronics President. Itronics Metallurgical began offering these yearly dated bars in 2001. Production was discontinued in 2008, but many collectors have requested that they be brought into production and the series continued. Many people collected each year and a small trading market exists on E-Bay. Itronics plans to complete the series to the present and then to continue for the indefinite future.Production of the Silver Nevada Miner Bars was discontinued in 2009 due to extreme volatility in silver prices. Silver prices have now stabilized at much lower levels. “In 2018 we have received so many requests from collectors that we made the decision to continue the bar series with the 2009 bar and moving forward to the current year,” said Dr. Whitney. “We plan to produce 1000 bars for each of the past years. When the 2009’s are sold out we will produce the 2010 bars and continue to the present until they are caught up. The limited numbers being produced and sold should ensure continuing value for collectors.”The Silver Nevada Miner bar was created to commemorate the long and eventful silver mining history of Nevada and is an excellent souvenir of Nevada, which is known as the “Silver State.” The bars are 2 3/8 inches by 1 3/8 inches and ¼ inch thick. Each contains exactly 5-troy ounces of pure silver. The bars are “proof quality” and include a year-stamp authenticating the limited edition.The top surface of the bar is engraved with an authentic reproduction of a miner in one of the famous “square-set stopes” of the Comstock Silver Mines at Virginia City, Nevada, in the mid-1860’s. The bars are beautifully crafted making them an excellent gift item.About ItronicsHeadquartered in Reno, Nevada, Itronics Inc. is an “Innovative Zero Waste” Technology Company which produces GOLD’n GRO specialty liquid fertilizers, silver bullion, and silver-bearing glass.

"""Recycling Today” Details Itronics’ Successes, Future Plans“Itronics Inc. (OTC:ITRO) and its President John Whitney have always envisioned a clean, waste-free planet. Over the years, they’ve translated that vision into innovative, practical and money-making applications.Whitney is best known for inventing a method for separating silver and other precious metals from spent photographic liquid. Itronics uses the demetallized fluid to make micronutrient-rich fertilizers at its Reno, Nevada, plant, while the metals are turned into bullion and sold to refineries. Additionally, the glass slag produced in Itronics’ refining process can be used to manufacture commercial products, such as decorative tile.Itronics is not standing still. Within the last four years, the Company has developed a way to reclaim precious metals—including gold, silver and palladium—as well as copper and tin—from discarded computer circuit boards. It has simply added the e-scrap as infeed material for its refinery process.In that process, silver is not only recovered from photographic waste, but its chemical makeup allows it to soak up metals from circuit boards during furnace refining. The metals then become ingredients in the Company’s bullion.Because of this e-scrap breakthrough, Itronics is buying more furnaces to ramp up bullion production and will eventually bring in larger furnaces. Whitney has even modified a furnace so that it burns latent heat energy from carbon in circuit boards, reducing outside energy needed to power the furnace by more than 50 percent.For that furnace innovation, Whitney and Itronics won an award from NV Energy, a Nevada public power company.""Recycling Today” Details Itronics’ Successes, Future PlansRENO, Nev., Jan. 29, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The following news release includes portions of an article appearing in “Recycling Today,” the premium publication in this sector.

"Itronics Reports 2018 Year End Results; Updates Operations Expansion and Diversification ProgressRENO, Nev., April 12, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Itronics Inc. (OTC:ITRO) a Greentech Fertilizer, Silver, and Mineral Producer, today summarized its operations and diversification progress and announced sales results for the fourth quarter and full year which ended December 31, 2018.Itronics' Total Revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2018 were $302,598 compared to $419,231 in the same period in 2017. Total Revenues for the full year ended December 31, 2018 were $1,312,848 compared to $1,850,573 in 2017. As previously reported, fertilizer sales were down significantly due to poor weather in the first half of 2018. The outlook for fertilizer sales in 2019 is for a substantial increase, driven by a strong marketing program which was started in the fourth quarter 2018. First quarter 2019 sales were up more than 50 percent compared to the prior year’s first quarter. The outlook for silver sales is for an increase due to stabilized pilot scale circuit board refining operations, and a contribution from the newly introduced “Silver Nevada Miner” 5-ounce collector bars. A silver bullion shipment was made in January 2019, and “Silver Nevada Miner"" 5-ounce collector bar sales began in February 2019. The year 2018 was pivotal for Itronics as it continues implementing long term diversification and expansion based upon increasing GOLD’n GRO fertilizer sales, expanding its “Breakthrough Technology” printed circuit board refining operations, planning staged implementation of operation for other technologies within its portfolio of “Zero Waste Technologies,” and establishing a development plan for its Auric Fulstone silver gold zinc copper exploration project in Nevada. Following is a summary of the Company’s accomplishments in 2018, in order of their importance for the Company’s diversification and expansion:In May the Company announced that it had entered into an option agreement to purchase a 48-acre manufacturing site at Wabuska, Nevada that includes 60,000 square feet of buildings and a rail siding to be used as an expansion property. The Company plans to initially use this site to expand its GOLD’n GRO fertilizer manufacturing operations to be followed later by circuit board refining and other metal recovery operations.In early October the Company announced that it had expanded its GOLD’n GRO fertilizer sales team by hiring an experienced sales manager to lead the sales effort and launching an expanded marketing program to introduce the GOLD’n GRO fertilizers to a larger customer base.During the year the Company completed important steps in perfecting its pilot scale printed circuit board refining operations. In March the Company announced that it had taken delivery of a commercial scale e-scrap grinder for grinding shredded circuit boards (e-scrap) to feed its refining furnaces. In June the Company announced that using circuit board feed for its refining furnaces that is being ground up by the new e-scrap grinder made it possible to increase the per melt yield by more than 50 percent. The silver content per melt was also increased by 50 percent.In November the Company installed and successfully started up a centrifuge whose purpose is to significantly shorten the time and reduce the cost to perform liquid/solids separations in its hydrometallurgical processing of certain silver-bearing feed materials for the refining operations. The expected benefits are being achieved, making this an important process technology breakthrough for the Company.A confidential Fulstone Project report was updated in early January 2018. The updated report identifies five target areas and recommends a 10-hole investigative drill program consisting of two drill holes for each target area. In October the Company announced the discovery, by surface sampling, of surface 0.4 troy ounce per ton gold at one location and five percent copper at another location at the Fulstone Project. The gold was found within one of the five identified target areas. The copper was found at a location that extends a previously identified mineralized zone by 2000 feet from 5,000-foot strike length to 7,000 feet strike length.>>> For full article pls CLICK HERE >: http://itronics.com/041219.shtmlFollow Itronics on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/itronicsincFollow Itronics on Twitter: https://twitter.com/itronicsinc VISIT OUR WEB SITE: http://www.itronics.comContact:Paul Knopick888-795-6336"
