I own WPC and have for some time. But am buying this drop. Also buying VICI and O on this fear of rising rates panic out of NNN REITs by traders clearly not understanding the inflationProtection escalations built into the leases.
once more a new acquisition
REITs issue stock periodically. That's how they grow and buy more properties since they have to pay >90% of their earnings in dividends. All REITs do this. It's mind blowing that we're in 2020 and there are some apes here that don't know that...Sell me your shares pls! I'm happy to ride them back up and collect the divs for you
Sold 4450 shares of ATT today and bought 1750 shares of WPC
This stock is that wonderful combination of moderate capital appreciation and dividend growth. A definite sleep well at night stock. As I stated before I believe we’ll see 15 to 20 total return this year.

"Wait till it hits $80, management will sell more stock!"
Patience is a virtue with this company. They have rock solid fundamentals in my view. Much better diversification than O. As the economy recovers this stock will rise. I believe today’s price is a bargain for a safe 6% yield. I expect 15 to 20 percent total return by year end.
just increased my position by 50%.
started nibbling on a few more shares on additional weakness this afternoon.
"I have made some serious money lately on industrial reits like WPC, STAG, And PLYM."
"My￼ WPC position is already above my maximum limit or I would add more. If you have room in your portfolio, add more."
"I just looked at this stock first time today. I notice all the positive articles are by Montley Fool and there are clusters of them (paid promotion??) And that they just diluted the shares significantly and the execs, around 17 of them, gift themselves shares in the millions of $$ every couple of months. I think I'll pass unless someone can put a different spin on any of that?"
Why price dropped today?
Why down almost 2% today?
"Ok I took a small position here, plan to keep very long term n drip. Gl longs"
Stock issue to fund growth is not a bad thing. A blended source of funds for growth between debt and equity at a low blended cost of capital used to purchase inflation protected assets that provide a nice return over the cost becomes accretive to AFFO. As AFFO grows so does the dividend. This is the cycle of a growing REIT. The growth has to come from a blend of both equity and debt. So new stock issuance is inevitable and a good thing when done for the right reasons.
"BMO Capital Stick to Their Buy Rating ($92) for WP Carey & CoBMO Capital analyst Jeremy Metz maintained a Buy rating on WP Carey & Co (NYSE:WPC) on Thursday, setting a price target of $92, which is approximately 35.97% above the present share price of $67.66.Metz expects WP Carey & Co to post earnings per share (EPS) of $0.61 for the fourth quarter of 2020."
Can someone verify if this is correct? So WPC has rent escalations that are tied to the consumer price index (inflation). Can we expect this to be reflected in the coming ER? Higher rents and profits?
"Have a small starter position, just drip and hold until retirement"
Don’t really understand why it drops below the secondary offering price. Usually it does but it doesn’t make sense. Usually a good time buy. It was foe the last O offering.
"just rolling correction, last week Options action on CNBC said REITS technically over bought and they put bets on lower, watch RSI when 30 or lower good buy."
"I am a bit disappointed in this, I was thinking that when we had good data on the vaccine and folks were getting the shout en masse that this would start a steady climb upward since people would start getting beck to normal, going to stores, offices etc. Is this still to early in the recovery to think like this? I am a long term holder here and think this company is world class."
"Our quarterly dividend increase was announced:Board of Directors increased its quarterly cash dividend to $1.052 per share, equivalent to an annualized dividend rate of $4.21 per share. The dividend is payable on October 15, 2021 to stockholders of record as of September 30, 2021."
any way we make it to $85 by Friday? How fast does this stock recover from its offerings?
Another secondary offering at close (8/9/21). Selloff after hours by a couple percent.
"Ideal candidate for put options. The moment it reaches $80, they will sell more stock to pay the dividends. The worst pick for dividends"
Sitting here watching it drop. I think somewhere around 74 or so would be a great entry point.
"Sooner or later; the government will have to stop handing out money, the government will have to stop spending billions each month to prop up the stock market, investors will have to stop throwing money at momentum stocks, investors will care again about high quality dividend aristocrats, the power of compound interest will be valued, taught and understood againUntil that day happens take advantage of this market imbalance and buy WPC, relax and reinvest divvies. Now my largest single stock allocation. GLTA!"
60% of WPC leases have escalations tied to CPI and the other 40% have fixed escalations. This is not a bond.
public offering now closed.
"WPC has barely any rollover in their portfolio for years, minimal debt maturities, and a solid NNN rent roll of IG credits. The turtle wins the long race...!"
I bought some WPC today as an income investment. Plan on holding for the next 20 years.
According to WPC Investor Presentation (recent) property profile is 23% warehouses and 25% industrial with essentially all segments (including retail and storage) collecting 99% of rents due... and their stock price is going no-where? Reported prices for warehouse real estate is crazy (doubling the past two years) in Southern CA..... ???
Just added to my position at 76.87. Great dividend from a high quality company. Love it!!!!
4.20 dividend a year. Bought at a 6.9 % yield. Nice
The best put candidate in today’s market condition
How many companies out there in whatever sector have the pricing power for their product to build in a price increase every year?WP Carey has built in rent escalations on 99% of their leases. 60% of the leases escalate at a rate tied to CPI. So if CPI goes up 4 to 5% then the lease payment goes up 4 to 5%. The other 39% of the leases have fixed rent escalations which means the rent goes up a fixed amount. So it may go up 10% every five years. Or it might go up 1.5% to 2% every year. The fact is when most companies have no pricing power and their costs go up then the margins go down. WPC has built in pricing power. Their product (leases) pricing increases over time. Both…..existing leases and new leases. Existing leases are not fixed like a bond. New leases are written or bought to reflect going rates and if rates go up then properties generally are purchased at lower prices to create a higher lease payment return. Not to mention WPC’s stock already is priced so that it yields a very wide spread over treasuries to begin with. WPC is a pretty good vehicle to own now because it has a yield already reflecting people’s expectations that rates will go up and it has built in pricing power to accommodate inflation and protect margins and property values.
Waiting for this to go to $80
While the short term traders and algorithms cause huge swings in WPC the actual business is very stable and strong and is on track just moving forward doing its thing creating value through great investments which will be accretive to AFFO.
