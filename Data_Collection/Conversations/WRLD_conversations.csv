"This company has huge SG&A costs for a lender. That means little margin for error with loan losses. If loan losses go up even moderately, they are losing money. In a recession it will be a slaughter."

"Does anybody know the current short interest in the stock? My data is 20 days old. I really want this, but not at 110.13."
Hey management - use the current cash flow to buy back more shares. Otherwise trading at over two times book value with declining operating income in the current environment - this stock is way overvalued even at $123 / share and headed much lower
It's very cheap under 200. I am not selling until $250.

"I think the market BADLY misread the most recent results. Loans were UP 25% and net chargeoffs were down to a historical low. The CEO reiterated that he thought the company would hits its FY2025 EPS targets (which go as high as EPS of $25.00/share... double where it sits today). These results should have seen the stock shoot up 25%, not down 25%. But the market got confused by the change in accounting treatment is loss provisions, which now have to be accounted for at the time loans are made, so when loans increase, the provision has to increase too. But there's NO DIFFERENCE in the business - this is only an accounting quirk. As such, I wouldn't be shocked to see this quickly return to $200/share (where it was before the release), and possibly rise to $250/share (where it should have shot up to). Get in now and enjoy the ride up."

"My guess is that WRLD is due for a pullback in the short-run. check out awesome-STOCKS, its a pretty reliable service. of course you have to do your own due diligence, but they generally point you in the right direction."
