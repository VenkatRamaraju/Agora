Honeywell has issued a rather conservative guidance for 2018 but the company is getting ready for a major transformation next year with its spin-offs. I am optimistic on this company? What do you think?
Would you guys really want to own Garrett & Resideo if you had to pay for them? Are you concerned the value will drop right at the starting gate?
Big drop today. Stunning

What does it mean for the sp when HON goes to NASDAQ?
"this is def a return to normal stock, I will add more if there is a new dip"
"WOW, another new ALL TIME HIGH for HON."
"Leave it to notorious GE hater Tusa to praise a stock which is setting at an ""all time high""!!!!!! This stock (which should normally have a 12-15 P/E) is setting at an almost 29 P/E!!! I guess the expression ""Buy Low"" has completely fallen on deaf ears from analysts these days. This is the time for long term investors to be ""lightening up,"" not adding. We will get another 30-40% correction sometime in the not so distant future. Then you can add shares. I'm giving you PEARLS millennials - take notice. DO NOT listen to TUSA!!!!! Just my opinion folks. Want to ""Buy Low"" - add some shares of GE (which will eventually again be a $30 stock over the next couple of years; now setting at $13). That's value added. Again, just my opinion. Good luck longs."
"14 billion in net cash, 5.6 billion free cash flow, low debt leverage. And it’s got it’s fingers in everybody’s pies. Tell me what the bear case is because I don’t see it."
Incredibly solid company. Great buy regardless of market conditions
"Hopefully with all time stock price, compensation committee will see to retroactively reinstating last years increase that was rescinded, allow merit increases for this year and repay 10% pay reduction for employees who weathered the Covid 19 scare throughout the year."
JP MORGAN upgrade to 185
"This will keep going up, buy the dips! Can't beat Honeywell!"
Are earnings out yet ?
at Least a %10 Div Hike Expected Next Qtr. $4.08 Annual IMO
This stock should not be moving down at all.
Maybe a stock split on the way. That causes a lot of stocks to pop. It did for nvidia. Best thing that could happen for Honeywell shareholders.
"Best large company out there now at this price. Strong to whether the storms, and very nice bounce potential when COVID is past us."
"With valuations depressed from here on out, expect Honeywell to make substantial acquisitions."
$HON Target Raised by JPMorgan Chase Overweight USD 200 » USD 250 Upgrades Deutsche Bank Buy USD 222 » USD 244\
When are the posers here going to accept that Honeywell is not a trading stock. This one is for holding and milking the dividends
Good chance we hit $200 in a month...earnings should be good...then a Jump up
Honeywell's @Intelligrated TechSight reduces downtime with access to remote #tech support. Watch their demo with $VUZI's M400 Smart Glasses at #MODEX2020 below ttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8BzYvN3k6k #AR #TechNews #Innovation #Technology $HON
Very good stock
"Officially overvalued. Two analyst raise target prices and it shoots up $7+ in a day? Sure, the markets are rational. A 28.7 PE based on 2021 earnings estimates? Are you kidding me? This market is begging for a correction."
Beat estimates and revised upwards. Future looks very bright for HON. Tech automation revolution is upon us. HON will play a significant part.
Looks like HON is going to have to rescue GE Aviation. HON would bust up the GE unions by moving all of the plants to “right to work” states offering massive tax credit packages. Lots of empty space in Arizona to build giant factories.
i added a bit more today.
div / OpCF ratio less than .5 very nice
"Just took my profits in good, old, reliable, HON!! I've been waiting for this puppy to come back through all the Tariff news, tax cut news, etc. Today's big earnings and revenue numbers and soaring stock price gave me an opportunity to raise some King Cash. Expect selling in stock as traders raise King Cash ahead of mega amount of earnings next week from BA, AMZN, GOOG, etc."
What's the problem here ?
HON will more quickly go to 100 from 75 than to 200 from 150. Splits work. Let's have a 2 for 1 Stock Split.
"Hvac tech here, very intrigued by Solstice N41! I don’t think R410a will be phased out in my lifetime, considering R22 is still readily available (just costs your first born), but the fact Solstice N41 is NON-flammable is awesome. The other R410a replacements have some level of flammability. Would of like the collab to be with Carrier(I own shares) instead of Trane(I don’t own shares) though."
"Sandbagging the guidance as usual while most companies aren't even giving guidance, market overreacts"
Yahoo needs to fix the HON trailing EPS and trailing PE. Are these types of errors typical of Yahoo finance?
"Aerospace market is dead however Honeywell is much more diversified. If you believe in 3M and Whirlpool, which I do, Honeywell will usually follow MMM just a bit short because they are held back by Boeing.I still think that Long term this is a solid buy and can bring some great returns."
"Anyone know why HON fell today, on a 1000 pt DJIA up day......from mid 135's to 131 at the close and then 129 in after hours......no news."
General motors falling big !How much hon business is related to autos anyone know ?
"I was telling this board for months to roll into $HON, I’m sorry if you didn’t listen. Hon is ready to buy the undercapitalized scraps of GE aviation, the airforce and army can’t trust insolvent $GE for much longer."
"$Hon tried to buy $UTX but there were too many overlaps, buying $GE aviation would be much cheaper, $50B"
"dividend raise, hopefully?"
Anybody thinking this stock is going up a little too fast? Too bad I didn’t jump in at 155. But now it seems a little late.
Just don't understand and it makes me sick that Cote gets paid what he gets paid while forcing employees to take 10% cuts. Is THAT a good CEO!?
"I spent 2 weeks at a 2 million sq/ft Honeywell facility for work in 2017. I was blown away by it all. The R&D, the manufacturing....everything was just incredible and efficient. I remember looking and at the time it was around 130. I still know nothing about investing, but I really didn't know anything back then and thought 130 was too much and then kicked myself as it went up and up. Got in at $133 a share and I will continue to add for the rest of my life. Great Company!"
Govt Contracts= 4.6B so far 2020 vs 6.3B 2019 entire year.
$HON Target Raised by Deutsche Bank Hold USD 212 » USD 222Target Raised by RBC Capital Sector Perform USD 194 » USD 199
Well well well HON market cap higher than GE. Who ever woulda thunk that? Maybe HON can buy GE now? Nah no one wants any part of GE at this point.
"Mega MERGER,......Goldman would have to act as the facilitator of the transaction should it happen. Would be huge in 7 yrs Honeywell would be a Trillion dollar company"
Do y’all think honeywell stock will get back in the 160 range?
"Dividend increase to 90 cents per share, I love it give some money back to shareholders."
What if United Technologies buys GE. Will this be a good or bad thing?
Slow and steadily going up....
"The addition of AI will ensure long term growth. Bought this for my kids (below $30) because I see a steady earner. 1,000 share are now 1350 and the spin offs are another bonus. Looks like we have another really good CEO and that's the key."
Honeywell International Inc. (HON) could buy GE using Cash and stock instead of buying its own share. I would not be surprised if an offer is in the work
HON has had a great run lately. Nothing wrong with a little pullback every now and then. It's healthy for the stock and makes sense some profit taking is taking place after a solid earnings beat & raise. In this one for the long run. HON is evolving and an adapter. Solid future ahead.
the fuel cell breakthrough who makes the components for that tech. seems it could cover many applications. i like clean energy and hon is in. be safe please.
How is the investor meeting going? Did is start yet? HON needs to get back above $160
Seen this thru tough times in the past....will see it thru this one too.....long time holder....made huge gains over the period.
"As a Honeywell customer and shareholder, I am a little concerned that one of the new divisions created from the ACS restructure (HBT) announced a furlough the first week of January. How confident should I be if they are requiring employees to take a furlough at the beginning of the first quarter? Clearly the business leaders don't have a lot of confidence."
I added today at $154.50. I was waiting for a dip and got one. This is a $200 stock by Apr 2019.
"Honeywell LAYOFFS thousands 1,000++++++ employees around the world this week to keep the value of the stock. The company is not doing well. Be careful!!!!!!!!!!!"
This current price is a gift to us longs. Buy and hold and you will be rewarded
"I've owned HON since 04/13 and have since been averaging up ,,, last purchase was Oct this year at 173 ... PATIENTLY hang on and you'll more than likely continue to be rewarded ..."
"Pre COVID price.. $174 could be a bit strong here. If you want to get in, try to under 160... or just average in and buy every dip that presents itself."
200 by spring?

Very good day today!
Why is this company's stock price not going up? Didn't they announce they produce Quantum computers now. I thought investors would buy this share in droves on this announcement
you guys are lucky the GE didn't get approved to acquire Hon years ago.
"Honeywell...moving all those U.S. jobs to Mexico over the last several years. Making U.S. employees train the Mexican counter parts. Not giving pay increases to ""band 3 and below"" U.S. employees for many years. Disrespectful to all employees except senior management. Shame on you!! Wait till Mr. Trump get this info; and your biggest customer is the US Gov't! At least for aerospace. You guys are in for a wake up call."
I saw a dream Honeywell stock sky rocketing 
The double bottom correction is just about done. don't ya think ?
"Roll your $GE into $HON to protect your dividend income, Trump isn’t going to bailout $GE this time."
"The demand for commercial aircraft electronic flight bag (EFB) systems is strictly proportional to the growing requirement for commercial aircraft avionics. This is mainly driven by the increasing demand for safety, fuel efficiency, airworthiness, and operational efficiency. Honeywell International($HON), Rockwell Collins, Thales are top rating players in this industry."
"In a yield starved market, HON is as good as gold"
Quality.
Law firms are getting desperate with their pleading for clients.People starting to realize that they receive very little out of a class action.It's the law firm that walks away with great bulk of any funds received.
What a great day to buy HON stock!! Spinning off a business and missing earnings guidance!! Bought some in the low 106 area earlier this morning. What a gift!!
"Wow, $HON is $15B away from passing $GE’s market capitalization!"
Any guess on an ex-div date?
"Finally closes at/above it's 100 day SMA ... next target is its 200 day SMA of 161 and change ... c'mon, ""Just win, baby!"""
What's up? Nice day so far.
"I’m only now getting around to looking into Honeywell , and my god the fundamentals are fantastic , and the dividend is extremely safe . 100% buying this in the coming weeks at these prices"
shares of REZI have not yet shown up in my account. Did I miss something? Thanks.
This thread and Honeywell’s volume is super quite. I guess that speaks volumes. Good luck longs.
Anyone see an Earnings blow out? Picked up some spreads with some huge upside!
What a great company HON.
"Just doubled down on my investment in HON. Earnings season should bolster this Market. If I'm wrong, then I'll just add to HON when we go into a Bear Market (HON always bounces back, just like my other great Battlewagon stocks like BA, MMM, UTX.)."
"Honeywell (HON) Tops Q3 EPS by 4c, Revenues Miss; Offers Updated FY18 EPS/Revenue Guidance"
"Honeywell should be growing ,big , do homework buy ,make the profits."

"After the fall, HON now has very good upside potential. Bought more on the dips but saved some for later."
Massive layoffs announced starting in June up to 25% of employees depending on division. Stock should take a nice jump up after official announcement.
"Reliable company & excellent dividend, what's not to love about HON?"
What a fantastic company! New all time highs coming soon! Very proud to own HON!
Time for $HON to gobble this thing up at $22/share.
Should have been up more off of BA
Well I lost a bundle not buying Netflix prior to reporting earnings. Should I buy honey before earnings is next question. Thoughts
Earnings beat but sales down. Going to fix it by more cost cutting. Read that as more talent going out the door.
Another beat on earnings tomorrow?
Bought in at $131 hope it was not a mistake. Looking to hold a couple of years.
HON To make offer for ARNC ????? would be a great fit!
Still I can buy this for long term investment?
"I believe they're getting hit with the aviation fallout.Big division of HON. is aerospace.Still, quantum computer coming in 3 months? Great timing in the middle of a pandemic!!!"
hi ow many of you shareholders are ecstatic that GE didnt acquire HON and destroy it?
Awe sugar sugar
"Will never sell. Hon is with great potential. Great dividend, too. Buy at the dip."
Since I would NEVER buy Garrett & Resideo if I had to pay the $30/share (poss spin off price) they might go for maybe the best way to play this is to Buy the more streamlined HON AFTER they dump the 2 companies that don't fit into their portfolio. The CEO said he would not invest more funds into these two companies so why should I.
it's way undervalued. Should be 160+ after the earning release early next month.
I will add around $217 which is the 100 MA. We may get there today depending on what the fed does.
"not a miss, they beat, but lowered guidance cause of ba. still er have to be perfect to go up"
I was under the impression that HON price would drop around 10% today on the Garrett spin off. Why didn't that happen?
I think this is a good long term investment and I will buy on any weakness.
Bought 830 shares of Honeywell at 129.37 lets go for it.
The defense contractor Honeywell was recently fined $13 million by the State Department for allegedly violating international arms trafficking laws after it was found that the company exported sensitive technical drawings of American military technologies to China and other countries in 2018.
Boeing 737MAX production cut should have negligible impact on HON. New highs with earnings release later this month are likely.
Big Honey.
great business model and still at a good price. I'm in!
Heading to $175 by the end of the year.
"Wow, thank you Trump for lowering European Industrial tariffs! HON loves it "
"$HON buys $GE for $80B, spins out GE Aviation to get EU approval."

"Honeywell profit beats on strong aero, warehouse automation sales"
"Honeywell is spouting good news, 2 gov contract, analytics platform, worlds 1st quantum computer... this is like George's opposite World in Seinfeld"
"Aerospace industry is a disaster right now. No one flying no,one buying. May take a year after the virus passes for companies and countries to assess whether they want to issue contracts for purchasing. HON should buy out BA."
"Looks like the big MM's are looking to get a great stock cheap - smacks of manipulation. They know what they are down to (not up to, since it is sneaky)!"
Maybe wishful thinking but it'd be nice to see a 8-15% bounce with a strong earnings. Actually isn't that much considering one whale or institution can send this up to those levels with the lower trading volume.
time to sell boys....
Remember when GE wanted to buy Allied Signal and the Europeans blocked it. This will never happen to much of a problem company.
seems like the big shorts got burnt from the WSB and they are turning around to slaughter the blue hip high earning stocks. who said the stock market is unfair.
Still pushing. Great company to own.
"Lowest sales in 12 years, should hit all time high soon."
I just bought in because of the Index change-over and because I read an article about the Quantum Computer.
"I lost 2.5% in the last few days in HON. Still my favourite stock in my portfolio, particularly at this price. Fantastic when seeking long term value, super innovative company."
Is Honeywell going to participate in building cyber and system security for our country's future ?
Honeywell is a great company but it has been dropping with no news. WHY???
what's up? Some people knew yesterday.
how many shares of Garrett will we get in the spin-off per share of HON stock?
Probably up due to their Quantum Computer.
"From furloughs to Lay offs (RIF) for Aerospace locations in the U.S., Canada & Puerto Rico. No numbers given or date. HON is an engineering heavy company with many older employees. Why not offer early outs, bridged buy outs and health care until 65 YO. I'm sure MANY employees (more than you need) would take the offer. Who cares about the employees making Mr. Cote rich?"
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/honeywell-secures-476-million-engine-213000952.html
Why everyone is selling this?
I wonder if Honeywell will buy GE now that it has sold off its aircraft leasing arm
Wondering if HON can play a part in cyber security for USA ?
"@Stockguru Oops, price just descended past the 20 MA. I still say $202."
Just bought this in a non-taxable account. Holding long term with nice dividend :)
Very strong stock for the long-term
Earnings Report will be fantastic that's my guess.
Very happy to pick up Hon at 103.00 the other day. Love this stock long term
where is this going anyone knows
"Definitely a great earnings report, for these crazy times..Though the market has reacted bizarrely to great earnings reports from my other companies "
Honeywell reached an all time high at 205.02
Honeywell should buyout VYST or partner up with them! UVC air purifying machines being made as we speak! VYSTVYSTAR CORP
"quantum computers wow! Good things are growing with this business, I hope to hear more from this big success of Hon. Good investing folks."
"Hon CEO asking for taxpayer subsidies and mandates to make their technology profitable. In short, their energy technologies can’t compete in a free market environment! We left be Socialism if it benefits us!"
"This will be at 250 before we know it. And eventually 300. Guaranteed winner, keep buying shares when it dips and your future self will thank you graciously! Got in at 139 up to 159 and I'm extremely pleased with how things are looking."
Long-term chart still looks great. Buy and hold.
$172/share by end of the Year ...
"Average annual return for the last ten years, including dividends 16.39? OK, I'm about to start due dilligence on HON."
This stock is a long-term winner. Really well positioned to benefit from the vaccine and the 'return to normal'
Definitely one of the best investments I’ve made this year
Will share holders get any of this new quantum company
19 times Fwd earnings with a PEG of 3. HON looks overvalued right now.
Why is HON continuing to drop. I haven't read any new stories to indicate this kind of decline.

How many law firms can come out of the woodwork to file a claim against Honeywell? And always announced on days in which the stock should have gained at least 3%. How convenient and perfect timing!
Chart took a hit earlier last week then recovered nicely on Friday as stocks soared. Look for more upside ahead of earnings!!
"My Honey... doing well I see (sorry, I had to) Whoop Whoop!!"
anyone know why the drop and weakness?
"What's wrong with this picture??!! Earnings beat top and bottom line expectations with better than expected guidance resulting in a sell-off!!!??? Yet social media like TWTR and SNAP beat and CONTINUE to lose money and their astronomically over valued stock price keeps going up???? What does that tell you about the froth that's in the market???!!! I think I'll go public with a company that has zero sales, zero product, zero service BUT sell the public on a great story and I'll become a billionaire!!! Think I'm crazy, look at RIDE, QS, NKLA, TWTR, SNAP etc"
HON is down $5.15 the day before earnings report. Did somebody tip someone off? Whose uncle-in-law of a board member is shorting stock?
In the past when does HON split ? any certain price range ?
"What a solid stock. Continue to average up, this is going higher."
Dave Cote tried to buy UTX but it was too pricey. $HON can buy all of $GE when it gets down to $75B MC.
Impressive price action and close at a new 52 week high!!
Funds must start buying HON on Monday if they represent the DJIA
$WFC I cant be convinced to sell. Lets just talk about pizza again. They hate when You ignore them.$WIMI $HON
Will the share price of HON adjust accordingly when the spin-off occurs to reflect the diminished value of the original company?
"Why the $3.50 drop today, Tuesday....no news, ....what is happening?"
"How are you supposed to access Garrett, if you don't own the stock?GTX is a mining stock.GTX - WI is Garrett before issuing 10/01/ 18."
Is this stock a buy now ? Plz advise wisely thanks
$HON Upgraded by Morgan Stanley Equal Weight USD 220 » USD 230
Another stock I bought and forgot about. Great money great company. No brainer big gains long term
Hello do we have the earning call tomorrow ? My trade portal does not say so but Yahoo does !
HON reached a new All Time High at 163.53
"Infrastructure deal being shrunk, no free money for Honeywell."
I love buying groceries and being able to make nice dinners for myself and my boyfriend with my Honeywell dividends!!!
"Now that Honeywell is growing the software part of the business, they will command a higher P/E!"
What a GREAT month..... Can it continue ??
Can HON take over GE Aviation for $40B?
Now is the time to buy!
What an excellent investor webcast. Good to see HON taking strides to improve in this new environment. Good job
HON climbs higher every year/ seasonally from April. 15- 26.
May slide to the right until earnings catch up to the stock price.
Wonder how supply chains for Honeywell will be effected since they outsource so many products out to China.
"Buy the dip. Good quarter other than the lack of guidance. Same reason every good quarter for every stock is being punished. Undeserved and unwarranted. Why a stock like HON deserves to sell off while a stock like GME deserves to rally is beyond me. Common sense has gone out the window. This stock will reclaim 200 and eventually take out 300. This company represents the future, while GME represents the past. HON has an excellent business model, GME's is obsoleted and outdated. The smart money will reassert itself over the dumb money and give each stock the treatment it deserves. HON will rally, while GME will fall back to earth."
HON has ramped up production of masks for the Coronavirus panic which is afflicting the country and world.
Big pop on earnings in the a.m !
long should go up huge.
I just got a 10% dividend raise from $HON. In what world do you expect $GE to ever raise the dividend again? Maybe if the Fed gets rates up to 10%.
I added today at $162.25. Stock should see new highs again this week.
I made a video about Honeywell International ($HON)Check it on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NROaEaZCXbU
Will be  tomorrow Honey 
Brand new here. Luv what they had to say on Cramer. I hope that the new batery tech is as cool as expected.
"I really do not understand the market's reaction to the earnings call. It was sure to fall significantly, but it still beat estimates. Why is the stock falling then??Feel free to explain if you can, just getting started in investment"
32 PE…will wait for mid 20s
Honeywell Slips Despite 4th-Quarter Revenue BeatDuh! They just wasted $1.9B on a lousy acquisition - Sparta Systems
past its one year target
I expect a good quarter this week from HON. This company is going places and has their fingers in everybody's pies. I believe it is undervalued at these levels and you can't always rely on PE ratios to say if a company trades at a discount or not. You have to think broader than that and look at the industry's potential and the company's potential.
"Watch revenues, especially from the aerospace division tomorrow, to see what's driving the layoffs. Honeywell's core growth has stalled and they're cutting muscle to hold down costs. M&A is their only play. Cote is looking a lot like a Welch clone. Adamczyk is the new Immelt left holding the bag."
Trump 2020 USA
"Love how predictable its continuation pattern is upward, buy the easily visible dips, hold on, and enjoy the ride"
"Had this stock since 155, will continue to hold"
honeywell is splitting on 10/29/18. its gonna be a 1:1.
Hmmm PE 202% dividend Probably one of the least needing a sell off
300 by EOY.
I loaded up on the June $130 Call Options I expect HON to be $170-$190 a share by then. This sell of was a god-darn gift!
I see 1 year estimate at 173 share y’all think honeywell shares will reach 173 in 2018
How big will quantum computing be for Honeywell? Seems like a bigger deal than people are making.
