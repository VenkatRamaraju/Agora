"My Honey... doing well I see (sorry, I had to) Whoop Whoop!!"
Beat estimates and revised upwards. Future looks very bright for HON. Tech automation revolution is upon us. HON will play a significant part.
Why is HON continuing to drop. I haven't read any new stories to indicate this kind of decline.
HON will more quickly go to 100 from 75 than to 200 from 150. Splits work. Let's have a 2 for 1 Stock Split.
"Average annual return for the last ten years, including dividends 16.39? OK, I'm about to start due dilligence on HON."
Boeing 737MAX production cut should have negligible impact on HON. New highs with earnings release later this month are likely.
the fuel cell breakthrough who makes the components for that tech. seems it could cover many applications. i like clean energy and hon is in. be safe please.
at Least a %10 Div Hike Expected Next Qtr. $4.08 Annual IMO
Maybe wishful thinking but it'd be nice to see a 8-15% bounce with a strong earnings. Actually isn't that much considering one whale or institution can send this up to those levels with the lower trading volume.
Another stock I bought and forgot about. Great money great company. No brainer big gains long term
May slide to the right until earnings catch up to the stock price.
HON climbs higher every year/ seasonally from April. 15- 26.
Now is the time to buy!
how many shares of Garrett will we get in the spin-off per share of HON stock?
Big drop today. Stunning
Looks like HON is going to have to rescue GE Aviation. HON would bust up the GE unions by moving all of the plants to “right to work” states offering massive tax credit packages. Lots of empty space in Arizona to build giant factories.
This current price is a gift to us longs. Buy and hold and you will be rewarded
great business model and still at a good price. I'm in!
"this is def a return to normal stock, I will add more if there is a new dip"
Maybe a stock split on the way. That causes a lot of stocks to pop. It did for nvidia. Best thing that could happen for Honeywell shareholders.
"I spent 2 weeks at a 2 million sq/ft Honeywell facility for work in 2017. I was blown away by it all. The R&D, the manufacturing....everything was just incredible and efficient. I remember looking and at the time it was around 130. I still know nothing about investing, but I really didn't know anything back then and thought 130 was too much and then kicked myself as it went up and up. Got in at $133 a share and I will continue to add for the rest of my life. Great Company!"
"quantum computers wow! Good things are growing with this business, I hope to hear more from this big success of Hon. Good investing folks."
"Sandbagging the guidance as usual while most companies aren't even giving guidance, market overreacts"
Incredibly solid company. Great buy regardless of market conditions
HON has had a great run lately. Nothing wrong with a little pullback every now and then. It's healthy for the stock and makes sense some profit taking is taking place after a solid earnings beat & raise. In this one for the long run. HON is evolving and an adapter. Solid future ahead.
I will add around $217 which is the 100 MA. We may get there today depending on what the fed does.
Will share holders get any of this new quantum company
"What a solid stock. Continue to average up, this is going higher."
"14 billion in net cash, 5.6 billion free cash flow, low debt leverage. And it’s got it’s fingers in everybody’s pies. Tell me what the bear case is because I don’t see it."
$WFC I cant be convinced to sell. Lets just talk about pizza again. They hate when You ignore them.$WIMI $HON
Massive layoffs announced starting in June up to 25% of employees depending on division. Stock should take a nice jump up after official announcement.
"dividend raise, hopefully?"
General motors falling big !How much hon business is related to autos anyone know ?
Honeywell International Inc. $HON Total Debt (mrq) 22.15BHoneywell International Inc. $HON Book Value Per Share (mrq) 25.90
Very strong stock for the long-term
I expect a good quarter this week from HON. This company is going places and has their fingers in everybody's pies. I believe it is undervalued at these levels and you can't always rely on PE ratios to say if a company trades at a discount or not. You have to think broader than that and look at the industry's potential and the company's potential.
"Had this stock since 155, will continue to hold"
32 PE…will wait for mid 20s
Well I lost a bundle not buying Netflix prior to reporting earnings. Should I buy honey before earnings is next question. Thoughts
time to sell boys....
Will be  tomorrow Honey 
I love buying groceries and being able to make nice dinners for myself and my boyfriend with my Honeywell dividends!!!
"@Stockguru Oops, price just descended past the 20 MA. I still say $202."
Just bought this in a non-taxable account. Holding long term with nice dividend :)
"Aerospace market is dead however Honeywell is much more diversified. If you believe in 3M and Whirlpool, which I do, Honeywell will usually follow MMM just a bit short because they are held back by Boeing.I still think that Long term this is a solid buy and can bring some great returns."
Why is this company's stock price not going up? Didn't they announce they produce Quantum computers now. I thought investors would buy this share in droves on this announcement
"What's wrong with this picture??!! Earnings beat top and bottom line expectations with better than expected guidance resulting in a sell-off!!!??? Yet social media like TWTR and SNAP beat and CONTINUE to lose money and their astronomically over valued stock price keeps going up???? What does that tell you about the froth that's in the market???!!! I think I'll go public with a company that has zero sales, zero product, zero service BUT sell the public on a great story and I'll become a billionaire!!! Think I'm crazy, look at RIDE, QS, NKLA, TWTR, SNAP etc"
Anyone see an Earnings blow out? Picked up some spreads with some huge upside!
what's up? Some people knew yesterday.
"Infrastructure deal being shrunk, no free money for Honeywell."
"Hon CEO asking for taxpayer subsidies and mandates to make their technology profitable. In short, their energy technologies can’t compete in a free market environment! We left be Socialism if it benefits us!"
What's up? Nice day so far.
"Hvac tech here, very intrigued by Solstice N41! I don’t think R410a will be phased out in my lifetime, considering R22 is still readily available (just costs your first born), but the fact Solstice N41 is NON-flammable is awesome. The other R410a replacements have some level of flammability. Would of like the collab to be with Carrier(I own shares) instead of Trane(I don’t own shares) though."
"I lost 2.5% in the last few days in HON. Still my favourite stock in my portfolio, particularly at this price. Fantastic when seeking long term value, super innovative company."
I was under the impression that HON price would drop around 10% today on the Garrett spin off. Why didn't that happen?
"Dividend increase to 90 cents per share, I love it give some money back to shareholders."
"Honeywell is spouting good news, 2 gov contract, analytics platform, worlds 1st quantum computer... this is like George's opposite World in Seinfeld"
"This will be at 250 before we know it. And eventually 300. Guaranteed winner, keep buying shares when it dips and your future self will thank you graciously! Got in at 139 up to 159 and I'm extremely pleased with how things are looking."
"Officially overvalued. Two analyst raise target prices and it shoots up $7+ in a day? Sure, the markets are rational. A 28.7 PE based on 2021 earnings estimates? Are you kidding me? This market is begging for a correction."
This stock is a long-term winner. Really well positioned to benefit from the vaccine and the 'return to normal'
