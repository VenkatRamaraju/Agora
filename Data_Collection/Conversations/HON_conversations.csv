Well I lost a bundle not buying Netflix prior to reporting earnings. Should I buy honey before earnings is next question. Thoughts
"The addition of AI will ensure long term growth. Bought this for my kids (below $30) because I see a steady earner. 1,000 share are now 1350 and the spin offs are another bonus. Looks like we have another really good CEO and that's the key."
"Best large company out there now at this price. Strong to whether the storms, and very nice bounce potential when COVID is past us."
Awe sugar sugar
how many shares of Garrett will we get in the spin-off per share of HON stock?
Since I would NEVER buy Garrett & Resideo if I had to pay the $30/share (poss spin off price) they might go for maybe the best way to play this is to Buy the more streamlined HON AFTER they dump the 2 companies that don't fit into their portfolio. The CEO said he would not invest more funds into these two companies so why should I.
"Looks like the big MM's are looking to get a great stock cheap - smacks of manipulation. They know what they are down to (not up to, since it is sneaky)!"
Will be  tomorrow Honey 
Very strong stock for the long-term
What if United Technologies buys GE. Will this be a good or bad thing?
What's up? Nice day so far.
"I was telling this board for months to roll into $HON, I’m sorry if you didn’t listen. Hon is ready to buy the undercapitalized scraps of GE aviation, the airforce and army can’t trust insolvent $GE for much longer."
Funds must start buying HON on Monday if they represent the DJIA
"I've owned HON since 04/13 and have since been averaging up ,,, last purchase was Oct this year at 173 ... PATIENTLY hang on and you'll more than likely continue to be rewarded ..."
Heading to $175 by the end of the year.
I added today at $162.25. Stock should see new highs again this week.
The double bottom correction is just about done. don't ya think ?
"The demand for commercial aircraft electronic flight bag (EFB) systems is strictly proportional to the growing requirement for commercial aircraft avionics. This is mainly driven by the increasing demand for safety, fuel efficiency, airworthiness, and operational efficiency. Honeywell International($HON), Rockwell Collins, Thales are top rating players in this industry."
"not a miss, they beat, but lowered guidance cause of ba. still er have to be perfect to go up"
JP MORGAN upgrade to 185
Big pop on earnings in the a.m !
"I believe it will go to 1,000 in my lifetime I'll buy most negative days"
"Honeywell should be growing ,big , do homework buy ,make the profits."
"$Hon tried to buy $UTX but there were too many overlaps, buying $GE aviation would be much cheaper, $50B"
Incredibly solid company. Great buy regardless of market conditions
I love buying groceries and being able to make nice dinners for myself and my boyfriend with my Honeywell dividends!!!
Maybe wishful thinking but it'd be nice to see a 8-15% bounce with a strong earnings. Actually isn't that much considering one whale or institution can send this up to those levels with the lower trading volume.
shares of REZI have not yet shown up in my account. Did I miss something? Thanks.
where is this going anyone knows
Can HON take over GE Aviation for $40B?
When are the posers here going to accept that Honeywell is not a trading stock. This one is for holding and milking the dividends
Very good day today!
Another stock I bought and forgot about. Great money great company. No brainer big gains long term
Law firms are getting desperate with their pleading for clients.People starting to realize that they receive very little out of a class action.It's the law firm that walks away with great bulk of any funds received.
"Anyone know why HON fell today, on a 1000 pt DJIA up day......from mid 135's to 131 at the close and then 129 in after hours......no news."
"Honeywell profit beats on strong aero, warehouse automation sales"
Anyone see an Earnings blow out? Picked up some spreads with some huge upside!
"Honeywell is spouting good news, 2 gov contract, analytics platform, worlds 1st quantum computer... this is like George's opposite World in Seinfeld"
Still I can buy this for long term investment?
I will add around $217 which is the 100 MA. We may get there today depending on what the fed does.
"Aerospace market is dead however Honeywell is much more diversified. If you believe in 3M and Whirlpool, which I do, Honeywell will usually follow MMM just a bit short because they are held back by Boeing.I still think that Long term this is a solid buy and can bring some great returns."
"WOW, another new ALL TIME HIGH for HON."
honeywell is splitting on 10/29/18. its gonna be a 1:1.
long should go up huge.
What a fantastic company! New all time highs coming soon! Very proud to own HON!
$HON Target Lowered by Barclays Overweight USD 253 » USD 250Maintains Wells Fargo Equal-Weight USD 229 » USD 227Target Lowered by RBC Capital Sector Perform USD 229 » USD 224
"I believe they're getting hit with the aviation fallout.Big division of HON. is aerospace.Still, quantum computer coming in 3 months? Great timing in the middle of a pandemic!!!"
Earnings Report will be fantastic that's my guess.
Honeywell is a great company but it has been dropping with no news. WHY???
Honeywell has issued a rather conservative guidance for 2018 but the company is getting ready for a major transformation next year with its spin-offs. I am optimistic on this company? What do you think?
it's way undervalued. Should be 160+ after the earning release early next month.
"this is def a return to normal stock, I will add more if there is a new dip"
"This will be at 250 before we know it. And eventually 300. Guaranteed winner, keep buying shares when it dips and your future self will thank you graciously! Got in at 139 up to 159 and I'm extremely pleased with how things are looking."
"In a yield starved market, HON is as good as gold"
Hello. I'm new. Just chiming in. Mine was inherited. Gotta deal with it. so. I'll learn. Looking forward. GLTA Rickie
"Wow, $HON is $15B away from passing $GE’s market capitalization!"
Is this stock a buy now ? Plz advise wisely thanks
How big will quantum computing be for Honeywell? Seems like a bigger deal than people are making.
What does it mean for the sp when HON goes to NASDAQ?
great business model and still at a good price. I'm in!
What a GREAT month..... Can it continue ??
32 PE…will wait for mid 20s
Govt Contracts= 4.6B so far 2020 vs 6.3B 2019 entire year.
I added today at $154.50. I was waiting for a dip and got one. This is a $200 stock by Apr 2019.
HON climbs higher every year/ seasonally from April. 15- 26.
Do y’all think honeywell stock will get back in the 160 range?
Just bought this in a non-taxable account. Holding long term with nice dividend :)
What's the problem here ?
Is Honeywell going to participate in building cyber and system security for our country's future ?
"What's wrong with this picture??!! Earnings beat top and bottom line expectations with better than expected guidance resulting in a sell-off!!!??? Yet social media like TWTR and SNAP beat and CONTINUE to lose money and their astronomically over valued stock price keeps going up???? What does that tell you about the froth that's in the market???!!! I think I'll go public with a company that has zero sales, zero product, zero service BUT sell the public on a great story and I'll become a billionaire!!! Think I'm crazy, look at RIDE, QS, NKLA, TWTR, SNAP etc"
"Average annual return for the last ten years, including dividends 16.39? OK, I'm about to start due dilligence on HON."
at Least a %10 Div Hike Expected Next Qtr. $4.08 Annual IMO
"Dividend increase to 90 cents per share, I love it give some money back to shareholders."
"With valuations depressed from here on out, expect Honeywell to make substantial acquisitions."
"Just doubled down on my investment in HON. Earnings season should bolster this Market. If I'm wrong, then I'll just add to HON when we go into a Bear Market (HON always bounces back, just like my other great Battlewagon stocks like BA, MMM, UTX.)."
Massive layoffs announced starting in June up to 25% of employees depending on division. Stock should take a nice jump up after official announcement.
"quantum computers wow! Good things are growing with this business, I hope to hear more from this big success of Hon. Good investing folks."
Hello do we have the earning call tomorrow ? My trade portal does not say so but Yahoo does !
Bought in at $131 hope it was not a mistake. Looking to hold a couple of years.
"Had this stock since 155, will continue to hold"
19 times Fwd earnings with a PEG of 3. HON looks overvalued right now.
the fuel cell breakthrough who makes the components for that tech. seems it could cover many applications. i like clean energy and hon is in. be safe please.
HON will more quickly go to 100 from 75 than to 200 from 150. Splits work. Let's have a 2 for 1 Stock Split.
I wonder if Honeywell will buy GE now that it has sold off its aircraft leasing arm
Remember when GE wanted to buy Allied Signal and the Europeans blocked it. This will never happen to much of a problem company.
I just bought in because of the Index change-over and because I read an article about the Quantum Computer.
Looks like HON is going to have to rescue GE Aviation. HON would bust up the GE unions by moving all of the plants to “right to work” states offering massive tax credit packages. Lots of empty space in Arizona to build giant factories.
anyone know why the drop and weakness?
"Wow, thank you Trump for lowering European Industrial tariffs! HON loves it "
"Reliable company & excellent dividend, what's not to love about HON?"
Well well well HON market cap higher than GE. Who ever woulda thunk that? Maybe HON can buy GE now? Nah no one wants any part of GE at this point.

Yahoo needs to fix the HON trailing EPS and trailing PE. Are these types of errors typical of Yahoo finance?
Speechless!!!! Don't sell!!!
Why is this company's stock price not going up? Didn't they announce they produce Quantum computers now. I thought investors would buy this share in droves on this announcement
Probably up due to their Quantum Computer.
"Pre COVID price.. $174 could be a bit strong here. If you want to get in, try to under 160... or just average in and buy every dip that presents itself."
"Leave it to notorious GE hater Tusa to praise a stock which is setting at an ""all time high""!!!!!! This stock (which should normally have a 12-15 P/E) is setting at an almost 29 P/E!!! I guess the expression ""Buy Low"" has completely fallen on deaf ears from analysts these days. This is the time for long term investors to be ""lightening up,"" not adding. We will get another 30-40% correction sometime in the not so distant future. Then you can add shares. I'm giving you PEARLS millennials - take notice. DO NOT listen to TUSA!!!!! Just my opinion folks. Want to ""Buy Low"" - add some shares of GE (which will eventually again be a $30 stock over the next couple of years; now setting at $13). That's value added. Again, just my opinion. Good luck longs."
Honeywell reached an all time high at 205.02
So HON is priced correctly til supply chain issues are resolved?
"Honeywell (HON) Tops Q3 EPS by 4c, Revenues Miss; Offers Updated FY18 EPS/Revenue Guidance"
HON To make offer for ARNC ????? would be a great fit!
"Sandbagging the guidance as usual while most companies aren't even giving guidance, market overreacts"
What a great company HON.
"What a solid stock. Continue to average up, this is going higher."
This current price is a gift to us longs. Buy and hold and you will be rewarded
Wonder how supply chains for Honeywell will be effected since they outsource so many products out to China.
"Hopefully with all time stock price, compensation committee will see to retroactively reinstating last years increase that was rescinded, allow merit increases for this year and repay 10% pay reduction for employees who weathered the Covid 19 scare throughout the year."
hi ow many of you shareholders are ecstatic that GE didnt acquire HON and destroy it?
Big Honey.
Will share holders get any of this new quantum company
HON is down $5.15 the day before earnings report. Did somebody tip someone off? Whose uncle-in-law of a board member is shorting stock?
HON reached a new All Time High at 163.53
Dave Cote tried to buy UTX but it was too pricey. $HON can buy all of $GE when it gets down to $75B MC.
"Officially overvalued. Two analyst raise target prices and it shoots up $7+ in a day? Sure, the markets are rational. A 28.7 PE based on 2021 earnings estimates? Are you kidding me? This market is begging for a correction."
I saw a dream Honeywell stock sky rocketing 
"I’m only now getting around to looking into Honeywell , and my god the fundamentals are fantastic , and the dividend is extremely safe . 100% buying this in the coming weeks at these prices"
"I really do not understand the market's reaction to the earnings call. It was sure to fall significantly, but it still beat estimates. Why is the stock falling then??Feel free to explain if you can, just getting started in investment"
Seen this thru tough times in the past....will see it thru this one too.....long time holder....made huge gains over the period.
Honeywell's @Intelligrated TechSight reduces downtime with access to remote #tech support. Watch their demo with $VUZI's M400 Smart Glasses at #MODEX2020 below ttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8BzYvN3k6k #AR #TechNews #Innovation #Technology $HON
What an excellent investor webcast. Good to see HON taking strides to improve in this new environment. Good job
Now is the time to buy!
dividend thank you.
Maybe a stock split on the way. That causes a lot of stocks to pop. It did for nvidia. Best thing that could happen for Honeywell shareholders.
I was under the impression that HON price would drop around 10% today on the Garrett spin off. Why didn't that happen?
"How are you supposed to access Garrett, if you don't own the stock?GTX is a mining stock.GTX - WI is Garrett before issuing 10/01/ 18."
Still pushing. Great company to own.
This stock is a long-term winner. Really well positioned to benefit from the vaccine and the 'return to normal'
"Macys, Kohls, Gap, Carmax, Bed bath and beyond, hime depot, newell rubbermaid, hanes all tanking huge !If you are in the market today you are “Fighting the Fed”As they are removing the 12 year old punch bowl....Stimulus is being withdrawn millions losing extra unemployment benefits as prices skyrocket...Big correction coming for this market like 20% drop and more imo.."
Beat estimates and revised upwards. Future looks very bright for HON. Tech automation revolution is upon us. HON will play a significant part.
Why is HON continuing to drop. I haven't read any new stories to indicate this kind of decline.
Would you guys really want to own Garrett & Resideo if you had to pay for them? Are you concerned the value will drop right at the starting gate?
Definitely one of the best investments I’ve made this year
I expect a good quarter this week from HON. This company is going places and has their fingers in everybody's pies. I believe it is undervalued at these levels and you can't always rely on PE ratios to say if a company trades at a discount or not. You have to think broader than that and look at the industry's potential and the company's potential.
"Love how predictable its continuation pattern is upward, buy the easily visible dips, hold on, and enjoy the ride"
HON has ramped up production of masks for the Coronavirus panic which is afflicting the country and world.
I just got a 10% dividend raise from $HON. In what world do you expect $GE to ever raise the dividend again? Maybe if the Fed gets rates up to 10%.
How many law firms can come out of the woodwork to file a claim against Honeywell? And always announced on days in which the stock should have gained at least 3%. How convenient and perfect timing!
Will the share price of HON adjust accordingly when the spin-off occurs to reflect the diminished value of the original company?
Very good stock
"Lowest sales in 12 years, should hit all time high soon."
"This will keep going up, buy the dips! Can't beat Honeywell!"
"I lost 2.5% in the last few days in HON. Still my favourite stock in my portfolio, particularly at this price. Fantastic when seeking long term value, super innovative company."
"After the fall, HON now has very good upside potential. Bought more on the dips but saved some for later."
"14 billion in net cash, 5.6 billion free cash flow, low debt leverage. And it’s got it’s fingers in everybody’s pies. Tell me what the bear case is because I don’t see it."
Boeing 737MAX production cut should have negligible impact on HON. New highs with earnings release later this month are likely.
HON has had a great run lately. Nothing wrong with a little pullback every now and then. It's healthy for the stock and makes sense some profit taking is taking place after a solid earnings beat & raise. In this one for the long run. HON is evolving and an adapter. Solid future ahead.
How is the investor meeting going? Did is start yet? HON needs to get back above $160
"I spent 2 weeks at a 2 million sq/ft Honeywell facility for work in 2017. I was blown away by it all. The R&D, the manufacturing....everything was just incredible and efficient. I remember looking and at the time it was around 130. I still know nothing about investing, but I really didn't know anything back then and thought 130 was too much and then kicked myself as it went up and up. Got in at $133 a share and I will continue to add for the rest of my life. Great Company!"
"Roll your $GE into $HON to protect your dividend income, Trump isn’t going to bailout $GE this time."
you guys are lucky the GE didn't get approved to acquire Hon years ago.
Buy this dip
I think this is a good long term investment and I will buy on any weakness.
In the past when does HON split ? any certain price range ?
"dividend raise, hopefully?"
Anybody thinking this stock is going up a little too fast? Too bad I didn’t jump in at 155. But now it seems a little late.
"Finally closes at/above it's 100 day SMA ... next target is its 200 day SMA of 161 and change ... c'mon, ""Just win, baby!"""
"Why the $3.50 drop today, Tuesday....no news, ....what is happening?"
Very happy to pick up Hon at 103.00 the other day. Love this stock long term
"Will never sell. Hon is with great potential. Great dividend, too. Buy at the dip."
