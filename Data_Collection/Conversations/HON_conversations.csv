"This will be at 250 before we know it. And eventually 300. Guaranteed winner, keep buying shares when it dips and your future self will thank you graciously! Got in at 139 up to 159 and I'm extremely pleased with how things are looking."
Beat estimates and revised upwards. Future looks very bright for HON. Tech automation revolution is upon us. HON will play a significant part.
Why is this company's stock price not going up? Didn't they announce they produce Quantum computers now. I thought investors would buy this share in droves on this announcement
"Had this stock since 155, will continue to hold"
dividend thank you.
"this is def a return to normal stock, I will add more if there is a new dip"
Another stock I bought and forgot about. Great money great company. No brainer big gains long term
Looks like HON is going to have to rescue GE Aviation. HON would bust up the GE unions by moving all of the plants to “right to work” states offering massive tax credit packages. Lots of empty space in Arizona to build giant factories.
Speechless!!!! Don't sell!!!
"quantum computers wow! Good things are growing with this business, I hope to hear more from this big success of Hon. Good investing folks."
Boeing 737MAX production cut should have negligible impact on HON. New highs with earnings release later this month are likely.
Maybe wishful thinking but it'd be nice to see a 8-15% bounce with a strong earnings. Actually isn't that much considering one whale or institution can send this up to those levels with the lower trading volume.
So HON is priced correctly til supply chain issues are resolved?
Well I lost a bundle not buying Netflix prior to reporting earnings. Should I buy honey before earnings is next question. Thoughts
"Average annual return for the last ten years, including dividends 16.39? OK, I'm about to start due dilligence on HON."
Massive layoffs announced starting in June up to 25% of employees depending on division. Stock should take a nice jump up after official announcement.
HON climbs higher every year/ seasonally from April. 15- 26.
Buy this dip
I love buying groceries and being able to make nice dinners for myself and my boyfriend with my Honeywell dividends!!!
Why is HON continuing to drop. I haven't read any new stories to indicate this kind of decline.
great business model and still at a good price. I'm in!
HON has had a great run lately. Nothing wrong with a little pullback every now and then. It's healthy for the stock and makes sense some profit taking is taking place after a solid earnings beat & raise. In this one for the long run. HON is evolving and an adapter. Solid future ahead.
"I believe it will go to 1,000 in my lifetime I'll buy most negative days"
Just bought this in a non-taxable account. Holding long term with nice dividend :)
"What a solid stock. Continue to average up, this is going higher."
"14 billion in net cash, 5.6 billion free cash flow, low debt leverage. And it’s got it’s fingers in everybody’s pies. Tell me what the bear case is because I don’t see it."
"Honeywell is spouting good news, 2 gov contract, analytics platform, worlds 1st quantum computer... this is like George's opposite World in Seinfeld"
This stock is a long-term winner. Really well positioned to benefit from the vaccine and the 'return to normal'
I expect a good quarter this week from HON. This company is going places and has their fingers in everybody's pies. I believe it is undervalued at these levels and you can't always rely on PE ratios to say if a company trades at a discount or not. You have to think broader than that and look at the industry's potential and the company's potential.
"I lost 2.5% in the last few days in HON. Still my favourite stock in my portfolio, particularly at this price. Fantastic when seeking long term value, super innovative company."
Very strong stock for the long-term
"Sandbagging the guidance as usual while most companies aren't even giving guidance, market overreacts"
Hello. I'm new. Just chiming in. Mine was inherited. Gotta deal with it. so. I'll learn. Looking forward. GLTA Rickie
"Macys, Kohls, Gap, Carmax, Bed bath and beyond, hime depot, newell rubbermaid, hanes all tanking huge !If you are in the market today you are “Fighting the Fed”As they are removing the 12 year old punch bowl....Stimulus is being withdrawn millions losing extra unemployment benefits as prices skyrocket...Big correction coming for this market like 20% drop and more imo.."
the fuel cell breakthrough who makes the components for that tech. seems it could cover many applications. i like clean energy and hon is in. be safe please.
how many shares of Garrett will we get in the spin-off per share of HON stock?
"Dividend increase to 90 cents per share, I love it give some money back to shareholders."
"I spent 2 weeks at a 2 million sq/ft Honeywell facility for work in 2017. I was blown away by it all. The R&D, the manufacturing....everything was just incredible and efficient. I remember looking and at the time it was around 130. I still know nothing about investing, but I really didn't know anything back then and thought 130 was too much and then kicked myself as it went up and up. Got in at $133 a share and I will continue to add for the rest of my life. Great Company!"
Incredibly solid company. Great buy regardless of market conditions
