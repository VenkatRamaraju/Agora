Big short squeeze coming tomorrow doesn't even matter what earnings are because the stock is way oversold already.
Does the Ralph Lauren family own any stock in this enterprise??? How much? thanks!!!!-
Lots of pumping here. RL continues to lose market share and they only really have outlets that matter and that business is starting to decline. They rely a lot on Department Stores and that business is terrible. I think we see $80's again in next 60 days. I am shorting here.
I am staying far away from RL - It looks like it is going to drop off a cliff. I actually get way better stocks at http://alert-sounds.com/
Interesting how a company’s price gets slashed but continues to move higher?
"So in other words, if you believe they will beat and every indication based on reports from VFC, PVH and LVMH suggest, they should. So buy this evening as it gets to about three o'clock, that will be the low of the day as the big money boys are dumping it going into close, at around 3:15, the big money starts to buy in up and until close, so we close as the highs going into earnings. Then when they beat, the price will start to spike in PM and continue to climb into the first hour of trading around the second hour of trading the big boys start to dump their shares and try and drive the price going into the close, so we will be at the lows tomorrow at around 3 PM, at that time after making probably in my opinion 12 to 15 dollars a share they will start to buy back in again and then on Wednesday they will start to drive the price up again, but much more slowly and more managed, then by Friday, the price will again be elevated to a 10 to 12 dollar gain, they will sell going into Friday's close and never come back until next report."
govt just pulled plug on pandemic relief and ended housing moratorium ...means less money for discretionary spending. so i would wait to buy this stock. it is a good company to own for the long term. you may be able to get a better price by waiting though ..gl
"I’ve been day trading for years and I’m so glad I finally found (http://Pick-stocks.com). They’re pre-market watchlists cover all the latest market-moving news, and they don’t beat you down with tons of ads. Highly recommend!"
The Earnings 12/23Good Luck
"JP Morgan also added another 125,000 shares recently. Now owns just under 2 million shares.https://fintel.io/sob/us/rl"
"Confused, another fun stock to play with, both because it is relatively cheap and two, because it fluctuates so much is Fossil. Don't like it as much anymore since they sold their smart watch research group to Google, but hey, if you can make a quick buck who cares. Got to buy it right though, never pay over 16 and always sell before 19. Small gaps, but they happen regularly."
"In at $121, could've saved $3 per share but I got excited seeing it this cheap before earnings"
Its a quality company heavily affected by the shutdown. They are sitting on a mountain of cash and giving when most companies are broke and taking. This is a true American company that will rise and continue its greatness. I am in at a good price and hope to hold on for a long profitable ride.
"Wow, not one comment on earnings. Interesting, Ralph has proven yet again, that American fashion can thrive regardless of how Wall Street and the overall situation plays out. The so so reports from the likes of Tapestry, Capri and PVH did nothing to bolster the view that Wall Street wants people to think that without a trade deal with China the American designers will all go the way of Zac Posen and Barney's of NY, there was even a Yahoo Finance interview with Rachael Zoe which suggested as much. These are different times for American fashion and retail, not necessarily difficult times as the false narratives from Wall Street would like Main Street to believe. Good job Ralph, keep it up."
Lots of call buying is quite the exaggeration.
Major catalyst today - timeline becomes clearer for recovery and the stock is still under valued
"This is one of the most frustrating stocks there is. Unreal action at 9x this fiscal years earnings, and 8x next year’s earnings.... 25% discount multiple to $RL, $PVH, Prada in HK trading. Different animal in LVMH, but a 70% multiple discount to them too.... just nuts. Staying long and strong until $75+ later this year with Versace integration and synergies"
"Many people think that Ralph Lauren is ""Old Fashioned"". Sometimes people should think so deep as the only thing that will reflect the stock price is sales and earnings at this point, leave it up to their financial strategists. All I can say is have fun missing out on 70-90% returns.Also, I think that people can only go without clothes for so long, and I'm pretty sure that by now, they've all gotten screwed by Online shipping and orders and sooner or later will begin to realize that returning to stores for clothes specifically is imperative. I paid a visit to two outlets in South California as well as South Coast Plaza and fashion Island last Saturday and throughout the week, and they WERE JAM PACKED as I expected. Hence, the rally for retail and mall stocks.Long and strong 8,000 Shares RL (Expecting 80% return Q1 2021) . 27,500 Shares JWN Nordstrom (200% return Q1 2021), 30,000 shares Macy's (100% return post election if Trump wins, 50% return Q1 2021 If Biden Wins.) AND SIMON PROPERTY GROUNP (SPG) 100% returns AT LEAST.People can't and won't go on like this forever and unlike analysts I think that people will return to things like Shopping, Travelling and Driving SOONER than later and MORE than less."
"Good earnings, company continues to make the right moves. When you take it in context with Tapestry earnings it clearly equates to several takeaways: People have not stopped spending due to COVID; savings from other areas (restaurants) allow people to pay more for premium goods like those made by RL. This market craziness is the last desperate attempt of people to short, but looking at the GDP numbers tells you that we've all moved on and adapted. 2021 will be a good year, especially once the vaccine is released."
I have been buying RL on dip since May this year. I have gain of 42% already. Glad to see the analyst coming out with higher price target for this stock lately!!
Most People who buy RL clothing are unimpacted by Covid financial impact. So holidays sales.
Can somebody explain why its plummeting ?
"New York company. New York hardest hit COVID-19. My thoughts are a big miss, but will depend on guidance. We shall see very soon, but aim bearish here. Futures green so they may get a little help from the broader market."
Looks very tempting at this $84 level.
Rl has already reduced it's China production to other countries Like the idea that Rl becoming more diversified. Will most likely raise prices on China made goods So what? Worries way overblown Fantastic buying opp
"Confused, be sure to monitor this tomorrow to see if the decline is merely delayed. Also monitor Sky Works today after close to see how they react to earnings, I don't play AH or PM, but will like to see what happens at open and during the day. I suspect they miss on revenues and beat or meet on earnings and they tank it and it gets way oversold, buy around 1 or so and ride it up until close. It would have to get hit pretty hard to make the risk worthy though, probably a 10% dip which at its current price may be expecting too much. But if it does, it could make it all back in a couple of hours going into close."
Very bullish technicals setup yesterday - this is clear to $85 and then $90 depending on the strength of the rotation to value.
"I still think a PE firm should buy the company at these levels. Lots of opportunity for RLX to expand in the athleisure market, plus growth potential in China - lots of opportunity in the brand...."
"The other thing here, if it does follow through and this tanks around noon as suspected, wait until near close and reinvest if you have free cash available."
Stock is still overbought on the technicals. It's trading near pre-pandemic levels despite year over year earnings declining significantly. These analyst upgrades are just cover while retail investors buy and big money clients cash out. Stock charts are short-term bearish
"Alfredo, again, this goes up to 140, big money creating false narratives about concerns of impending trade war. Both Tapestry and Fossil showed that international sales, even to China were not impacted negatively by any tariffs. The uber wealthy are creating tremendous entry points then they will pump the stocks like they did going into last summer and then dump them again going into the Christmas season touting an impending recession. The games that the rich do to ensure they stay rich and ensure no one else can join them."
"140 after earnings, both TPR and FOSL had awesome earnings."
Cheapest retailer right now!!!! Will go back to triple digits after earnings!!
"From CNBC today:""Cramer likes Ralph Lauren as Covid restrictions ease and apparel demand increases""Does anyone actually listen to this guy and buy stocks based on his recommendations?"
"I see a bullish flag forming on the charts. Finds consistent support around $98.70. It's been consolidating and should pop back to the upside, possible moving past its previous high of $106. I still expect we'll see $112 at some point, maybe by the end of the year."
Next resistance is $102 followed by $112 - and we're not even close to its 52-week high. Going up!
"evergrande not so grand -china proerty developer about to go into default. will china govt bail them out? china communist govt essentially owns everything there in china. i don think RL is a ""luxury"" brand to the extent that others are. so china clamp down on wealth should not effect RL very much as it could the top tier luxury brands."
rl will crash on ER on 11/02 due to global retail supply chain pressure good candidate for a dash-in-dash-out earning play
"Anas, the same reason that it drops like today, no reason, if it made sense, then everyone could make money and that isn't how our markets are set up, only the uber wealthy who manipulate them are allowed to make money."
"In the same vane, Tapestry (Coach) and Capri (Michael Kors), but they have to beat and both report today and tomorrow. It is like double or nothing. Good move by the way, it is always better to sell for a little less than you could then not to make any money or even worse yet, lose money and we all lost too much money the past several months. Be careful out there, a lot of games being played by big money players."
