back to 40.
Just created a position. Is there a reason this is down when everything else is up?
Business was loosing 200m a qt last year when the 55% stake was offered. They are now averaging around 200m profits a qt. Giant turn around in business. If dont want to believe in the business thats fine but suggesting its valuation should mirror thos of the market lows is not a fair statement. Stocks trade (broadly speaking) on valuation metrics. If you can show me another retailer with 20% market share that has 7 billion in revenue and has a pe of 7 i would be surprised. Show me a retailer with better VALUE metrics?
let's goo
I am going to be rich soon.Thanks

"Over the previous Trailing 12 months , 94% of stores have been cash flow positive with the average cash flow coming in at $900,000. This tells us that over the Trailing 12 months the North American locations generated $780.3m in FRee cash flow which could be use to generate more revenue if planned well.The entirety of the business is trading at only 6.7x the FRee cash flow the North American stores generated and is very low in compared to similar brands.This should be training at least above $100 and that to is conservative price target."
seems to be on a slow decline. 
How are we down $8 in AH? Good report...
Scoop in!!! Easy money! 
Stores very busy. They are running good promos these days
Anyone here?When is q3 financial release?
"$100 will be over a hundred before you know it. They can pay down all their debt in three years and be paying a nice $5-6 dividend. I dont think this will be there approach but very possible. It seems they are pushing hard into re-engineering there online platform, using selective marketing in key demographics. Maternity, plus size, swim wear etc. Company has already done the hard part of closing stores and restructuring. They sold over 100k of there wonder bra with no advertisements in one month. They are pushing to remain a quality brand that women will go out of there way for. The wonder bra story is evident that its working. Earnings are strong, revenue wont look as good when compared because of store closures (2019 over 2021). Margins remain strong and have room to improve of the company remains vigilant on supply chain. I will be buying any downswing from here. Good entry for the next three years"
Very good entry point at this price. Free money!
