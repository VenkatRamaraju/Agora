"Found it....why FIS is falling, coupled with the recall of Pax machines.......it's a competitor that causing this, AFRM....do a 5 day chart comparison with FIS.....that is the cause."
"Looks like tax loss selling from mutual funds which expires Oct 31st. I am looking for a entry point, GPN or FIS"
Is anyone bothered by the PE ratio of FIS? 944? Comparable companies well below 100. Any comments?

"Am I missing something, isn’t it good for FIS to be replacing PAX terminals with World pay systems?"

"Would love to see the company change its name to Worldpay. FIS already owns Worldpay and it's a phenomenal name for a global fintech company. Hmmm... Worldpay or Fidelity National Information Services... such a tough decision! Either way, I love this company. Good luck to all longs! PS - Did I mention that the company should consider changing its name to Worldpay? :)"
why is it down 6 percent?
Anyone still here?
Look at a 2 year chart. FIS seems to hit an air pocket drop like this about 2x a year right at earnings where the stock plummets. its done it several times in the 2 years.

FIS should change their name to Worldpay. An infinitely better name in my opinion.
Smart money is buying. This stock has been up even on the down days. In out stock analysis to exclusive subscriber club we've discussed this one and made a Strong Buy recommendation. Those who followed us are sitting on the nice gains when the overall market has been down by 10% and more... But this is just a beginning....
What the heck is going on with FIS - down almost 8 points!

I don’t believe the next administration will be kind to this stock as the previous admin was
"So, is this drop in share price all about the merger collapsing?"
"look at the historic 1 or 2 year chart and the price swings in this stock. It seems like FIS does this routinely, i don't think its tied to anything in particular"
This stock has done me well over the past three years. Good dividends too. Banking and banking services seem to be a win under this presidential admin.
Is there something wrong with this one ? Keeps going down. Are they loising market share ?
