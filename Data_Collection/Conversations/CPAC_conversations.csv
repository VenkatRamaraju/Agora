everyone bailed after dividend! stock has gotten to really attractive levels. conservatively think they can do 60-70c USD in FCF per share. would love to see buybacks at this price
Any risk Castillo will nationalize this company ?
I was looking at CMTOY out of Columbia (think they had some plans at LC-3; low carbon/carbon capture cement) - couldn't trade it without a big fee... ended up here - still liking the concrete/cement play.Any LC-3 play? Anyone know of any?
"I think this is a sleeper, annual dividend is $1.06 June 22, record date, payable July 13. Looks like Peru economy is surging and this is an established company, that company is not only a provider for building but mining."

"Google ""Party of Peru’s leading presidential candidate is Marxist — and wants to nationalize everything"" by Andres Oppenheimer for a look at what Castillo has in mind for Peru. I'd provide a link, but Yahoo automatically zaps all comments with URL links. Caveat emptor - since the risk is 100% loss of capital, due to Hugo Chavez-style nationalizations."

A nice day for the stock today. Does anyone know what's going on ?
