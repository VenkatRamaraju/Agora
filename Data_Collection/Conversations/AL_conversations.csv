"At 11:45 today's volume of 100,000 shares was dominated by 67,000 shares on a down tick at 10:58 (worth $3.2M). Volume quite light volume other than that, but showing a strong rising trend from 46.75 to 47.45 today. Then the 67,000 share sale pushed the trend and price down about 30 cents a few minutes later. Average share volume in recent weeks is about 400K/day. 67,000 shares in a 1 minute span is over $3M but one has draw his/her own conclusion concerning reason for the big sale. A complete guess, I guess."
Strong BUY from analysts... Buy Buy Buy -- It is undervalued... they beat their earnings and it is going to fly!!!!!!!
AL reached a 52 Week high at 49.50
"Can’t hold, it will down $10 as it’s brink to Bankruptcy, they are not Airlines so not getting any bailout money. No airlines need new lease may be ever "
"Let me back off for a second. I believe $NVDA will blow the ER door off simply based on my sentiment considering 1) if $Al Most Dead beat, how can $NVDA miss? 2) $NVDA beat the last 11 consecutive quarters. 3) almost all tech stocks beat. I am not even including the Trump tax cut in the considerations. Do you guys have any numbers to support why $NVDA will crush ER?"
"BUY given current market working in their favor. Coronavirus concerns are an actual opportunity for AL. Carriers that experience liquidity issues due to shutdown and ensuing slowdown in traffic will worst case scenario look to AL for sale leaseback of planes, a boon to AL. Traffic will recover and all will try to maintain for recovery. Any sales of planes AL is a ready market maker for especially given the ready demand for single aisle in Europe due to Supermax issues. Also weighted average financing cost at all time low and dropping with over 5% debt being refinance in the 2-3% range. With interest rate futures expecting another 25 bps down current market conditions bode well toward the election cycle when general market will move based on political expectations."
Very strange reaction to the report
dunno what to do with this stock. The market cap right now is more than what it was pre-covid.
Morgan Stanley takes a stake in FLY buying over 1.535 mil shares. Should be good for the sector
"This company is so undervalued still.""As of February 22, 2021, most of our lessees have requested some form of accommodation. We evaluate such requests on a case-by-case basis and have agreed to accommodations with approximately 61% of our lessees. Generally, these accommodations have been in the form of partial lease deferrals for payments due during 2020, typically with a short-term repayment period. The majority of the deferrals are to be repaid within 12 months from the date the deferrals were granted, and in many cases, include lease extensions. """
congrats to Pfizer. big bump in price in early hours. Breathe Again.
Why is there no talk about this company. Air Lease is in a great position for the future. Once countries open up this stock is easily at $60+.
Solid results...suspect the stock will sell off again. Company needs to aggressively push the dividend up imo.
"Hooray! AL adds a new customer as it has signed lease agreement for two big airplanes (A330-900NEO). Deliveries for fall of 2020 and Early 2021. And Best of all the order is from Delta, a new customer for AL. Perhaps U.S. airlines will begin to lease some planes from the AL's order book. P.S. (This is the quietest conversation board on YAHOO)."
solid earnings; still no love. No worries; we'll just continue to hold and accumulate. Currently priced at about 3.7x 2020 FCF.
Great qtr and outlook. Growing book value. Increasing dividends. Stock should rise soon. Trading less than book and recent AYR deal was at 1.2x.
"Yesterday (8/25) in one minute at 12:18pm AL moved up 8cents on volume of 766K shares. Average DAILY volume has been about 550K. Volume yesterday was about 1600K shares. Apparently in a single minute a ""single"" buyer purchased 1/2 of the entire days volume in a minute. And AL only moved up 8 cents/share. Seems odd that much volume in a minute and only a 0.2 % move upward. Bullish big buyer or what?"
$KPLT is the massive opportunity in this space. Partnerships with $AFRM and $APPL. Trading at 70% discount because of small miss of Q2 targets. Huge rebound potential. Much better P/E ratio then $PRG $URI $AER $AL or $RCII
"I'm not sure this company has a path to emerge from the current environment. One major carrier filed Ch 11, Boeing CEO suggested recently that another could be imminent (media is suggesting it's American.) Since the Company does not disclose who actually leases their fleet, how can an investor gauge their future operations and cash flows? It's not possible. And how can each analyst still maintain a buy rating on this issuance?Non lease revenue is approx. 2.8% of total, so that can't sustain them and they won't be able to generate cash flows from the sale of aircraft assets. Who's going to buy them? If the aircraft will no longer generate the cash flows as contractually obligated, these assets must be written down to some value below their current historical cost reflected on the balance sheet.I'd love to hear a counter argument ….Short this equity until the market recovers."
"Looks as though the Blackbird II LLC borrowing of 745 Million announced today and commented on by their partner, Air Lease, brought AL stock price up about $1 with some hints from the trading chart that a bit of decent news was forthcoming. The cash flow and the outlook for Air Lease is shamefully good for AL to sit slightly above 40 down from a 52 week high in the lower 50s. When do the earnings get back into a new high.?? Just a matter of time, but life is short. (Naturally a senior VP from AL also commented favorably)."
