"Yesterday (8/25) in one minute at 12:18pm AL moved up 8cents on volume of 766K shares. Average DAILY volume has been about 550K. Volume yesterday was about 1600K shares. Apparently in a single minute a ""single"" buyer purchased 1/2 of the entire days volume in a minute. And AL only moved up 8 cents/share. Seems odd that much volume in a minute and only a 0.2 % move upward. Bullish big buyer or what?"

Most of the airlines cancelled some of the lease already and planning to cancel more. Horrible situation for AL
"Sorry for me, sorry for you Disco Stu. I'll assist you with more gruesome details. At the moment AL is worth 24% less than the corporation represents (book value). And- -the book value is going to be more in a couple of weeks when the year ends since the current book value is assumedly based on Q3 reporting. Also AL share price is 65% off it's 2019 high mark. I don't want to be reminded that to get back to the 2019 high (of almost a year ago) the price needs to go up some 54%. Not a pretty picture for those of us who think we recognize value in a company with predictable growth, investment grade credit rating and savy well respected management in an expanding world market and very favorable analyst buy ratings (except for gloomy Morgan Stanley). Guess we shareholders should all switch to bitcoin, marijuana stocks and some far out biotech dealy-bobs."
AL in oversold territory!! Good quarter earnings coming up.
Why this company not back to $50 at the most busy time ever for airplanes refinancing?

"This has to be one of the top 5 most volatile stocks in the market this week. Start off at 10, all the way to almost 30 and back to 21 all in 5 days. Unreal for a company that hung out in a 10 dollar price range for 3 years. I agree with the other comment. Buy and hold might be dead. I need to pay closer attention on the days it is on the upswing at the open."
Well?
I am wondering if AL will take a look at buying AYR. THis industry needs some consolidation! Oh..and some love from Wall Street would not hurt a bit either.
"Per Yahoo Christmas Day. P/E 3.79, PEG 0.96, Price/Book 0.67, 52 week lo/hi ratio = 28.63/50.70= 56%, return on equity 21%, annual dividend rate=1.7% and growing with payout coverage ratio of 5.3%. NOT this low since October 2016 while growing earnings and book value for more than 4-5 years since 2013 IPO. Most of debt and upcoming debt to purchase new planes is fixed rate with 7 year lease rate fixed at date of plane 7 year plane lease. What are we missing here???"
Have AYR and AL and both are flying high. Might sell some calls on AL. Cant see any good ones on AYR.

Check out insiders. One million exercised options?
There is nothing to worry about fellow longs. It was simple profit taking yesterday. It may even continue today. Just remember Nvidia has record breaking profit quarter after quarter which is the envy of the tech industry. Do you rather own a stock which affords share holders to take frequent profit or one which is dead in the water like $Al Most Dead? Be thankful for the profit taking which drives the share price down. It is temporary and healthy. It means the stock you own is doing well.

This segment is getting bushwhacked. Is a growing segment. My personal opinion is that the segment is being manipulated to a certain degree and is likely being accumulated. I think the companies are protected on interest side as leases go up proportionately too. At least that is what I have heard in the conference calls.
"This company is so undervalued still.""As of February 22, 2021, most of our lessees have requested some form of accommodation. We evaluate such requests on a case-by-case basis and have agreed to accommodations with approximately 61% of our lessees. Generally, these accommodations have been in the form of partial lease deferrals for payments due during 2020, typically with a short-term repayment period. The majority of the deferrals are to be repaid within 12 months from the date the deferrals were granted, and in many cases, include lease extensions. """

"Terrific numbers all around. Even with neo problems and Alitalia bankruptcy, ALC still pulled off decent revs and excellent margins. Am a bit concerned that fixed rate debt percentage dropped so much, but given fed's ""move slow"" policies and low inflation, I don't see a big impact for now. Congrats to all AL investors!"

"Ridiculous Valuation and Share Price. AL earnings after taxes were $256M in 2014 growing steadily to 478M in 2017 (including nice, nice tax law credit) with estimates of 478M in yr ending 12/31/2018 and 593.2M in 2019. And due to contracted lease income their revenue and earnings are ""never"" underestimated by analyst. Consequently you can, with reasonable confidence believe the estimates will be met and the company will continue to increase earnings as contracted plane purchases come into the lease portfolio. The compound annual growth rate over the 5 years above (from 256M in 2014 to 593M estimated for 2019) calculates to a compound annual earning growth rate of 18.3 % with the outstanding share account only slightly increasing to 104M shares. Estimated per share earnings for 2018 are $4.60. So why are the ""big boys"" so afraid of this company. ""They"" like to evaluate it at 1.2 or less times it ""book"" value. So be it. But even the book value is increasing at a decent rate over the years."

"I've followed (and owned) AL for years now and have always been suprised at how depressed the stock seems to trade on a P/E, P/CashFlow basis. When I cut the value I ascribe the plane inventory to 60% of net stated value, I come up with P/Cashflow values of something like 4.5-5x cashflow.If I cut the value of the planes to $0, and keep all debt on the books I come up with current valuation of 9.2x one-year forward cashflow - essentially consistent with other market sectors and a slight discount to growth rate.Same thing for AER.So it seems to me that the ""market"" is basically assigning no residual value to the aircraft inventory. If that is the case, it makes sense that as the company scales up, stock price doesn't grow...market implies that every plane they buy only adds to the liabilities and offsetting lease cash flows just cover the additional debt. Clearly I think there is residual value in the inventory, and the company has tried to show this by intermittent sales - but I suspect the broader market doesn't want to pay for this.Otherwise, I just can't wrap my head around the inconsistencies in valuations for this sector and the rest of the market."
"On Nov 22 Morgan Stanley discontinued coverage on ""Aerospace and Defense"" and advised their clients to ignore prior discussion by the analyst covering 9 companies in this section/sector. The analyst left the company Morgan Stanley reported. The 9 companies included Boeing, United Technology, Textron. (Significant giants). The analyst, and I have read his weekly reports for years was always high on Boeing. However, he would never give ratings for AL or AER (the 2 airplane leasing companies covered) anymore than fairly priced and a HOLD rating. He preferred AL over AER. The statement was the analyst left the company. Aerospace and Defense will no longer be covered. MS said to disregard the analyst prior reporting on the listed 9 companies. The companies included AL and AER. Sounds like he might not have left voluntarily. I felt he always short-changed the Aircraft Leasing Companies (AL and AER). 8 year holder of AL with buying/holding above 25 and below 35."

sad day for those who have been killed in this accident and their families. My thoughts are with them
nice write up in Barron's this weekend
"BUY given current market working in their favor. Coronavirus concerns are an actual opportunity for AL. Carriers that experience liquidity issues due to shutdown and ensuing slowdown in traffic will worst case scenario look to AL for sale leaseback of planes, a boon to AL. Traffic will recover and all will try to maintain for recovery. Any sales of planes AL is a ready market maker for especially given the ready demand for single aisle in Europe due to Supermax issues. Also weighted average financing cost at all time low and dropping with over 5% debt being refinance in the 2-3% range. With interest rate futures expecting another 25 bps down current market conditions bode well toward the election cycle when general market will move based on political expectations."

"Looks as though the Blackbird II LLC borrowing of 745 Million announced today and commented on by their partner, Air Lease, brought AL stock price up about $1 with some hints from the trading chart that a bit of decent news was forthcoming. The cash flow and the outlook for Air Lease is shamefully good for AL to sit slightly above 40 down from a 52 week high in the lower 50s. When do the earnings get back into a new high.?? Just a matter of time, but life is short. (Naturally a senior VP from AL also commented favorably)."

"Hooray! AL adds a new customer as it has signed lease agreement for two big airplanes (A330-900NEO). Deliveries for fall of 2020 and Early 2021.

(This is the quietest conversation board on YAHOO)."
No Airlines in the world need new plane in coming year or further Nose drive today. Only fools buy it to loose money.

"All 4 major indices up 1 % or more this hour. AL down 1.3% on above average volume. AND after what seems like an outstanding quarter and conference call revealing great ""backlog' and fantastic tax break. Seems a good value to move up at least 10% a year from $50; if it could only get back to 50. Am guessing the cap size at $4B is just not big enough and the growth is just not exciting enough since the EPS is baked in, as a company that provides 8-10 yr leases on its leveraged assets. What's your guess?."

3% jump 2 1/2 hrs after close today. This is quite telling don't you think?. What do you think it's telling?. Asking price at the close must have been waiting for such a bid. Of course the important question is how many shares traded up and was it for any good reason. Normally Friday is not a good trading day for Air Lease.

"I've went back to my accounting books as to look for what to buy if earnings are crushed with other companies.Debt to Equity Ratio will get much worse as well as Interest Coverage Ratio (EBITDA/Interest Owed) .Hypothetically, companies start to lease or rent equipment instead of buying it to keep those two ratios at bay.Maybe a good thing for AL in the year(s) to come?I really think the credit market is about to fall apart as the house of cards it has become. I would think AL and URI might be big beneficiaries if the credit markets dry up. Not saying to buy anything right now, but seems like AL might be a good idea eventually."

i guess it s an overreaction of the markets due to the rise rates of the fed. the inlation is already slow down. consummer are confident. compagnies make profit even if is their a slow down of the growth in usa. semi conductors point a risk of cyclical growth. some of the highest valuation of the growth will some difficulties to bebound to new high and have a downtrend correction. but otherwise the fed will be after this fall more prudent to rise his rates and the others indicators are green.i think this one will rebound 2019 because it s a profiable growth company with strong fondammentals

"At 11:45 today's volume of 100,000 shares was dominated by 67,000 shares on a down tick at 10:58 (worth $3.2M). Volume quite light volume other than that, but showing a strong rising trend from 46.75 to 47.45 today. Then the 67,000 share sale pushed the trend and price down about 30 cents a few minutes later. Average share volume in recent weeks is about 400K/day. 67,000 shares in a 1 minute span is over $3M but one has draw his/her own conclusion concerning reason for the big sale. A complete guess, I guess."

"AL did great yesterday on the Coat Tails of AER's comforting report and honest discussion. Volume and price moved nicely in the last hour. AL's % gain at 5.44% exceed the gain by AER. I owned since 2016 with average purchases about 28-30, Even ""institutions"" wants a high flier and the rest are afraid of the transportation and finance companies still and for decent reasoning I think, even though the price / book will remain quite, quite low until air travel doubles. Glad Al customer base is broad, minimal in the U.S. and that lease payments are supported by lots of government world wide since governments have stake in air carriers. Noted that at this moment AL is down 3.43% to start this down day after 33% drop in GDP. Hope for good report Aug 6."

Solid results...suspect the stock will sell off again. Company needs to aggressively push the dividend up imo.
"I'm not sure this company has a path to emerge from the current environment. One major carrier filed Ch 11, Boeing CEO suggested recently that another could be imminent (media is suggesting it's American.) Since the Company does not disclose who actually leases their fleet, how can an investor gauge their future operations and cash flows? It's not possible. And how can each analyst still maintain a buy rating on this issuance?Non lease revenue is approx. 2.8% of total, so that can't sustain them and they won't be able to generate cash flows from the sale of aircraft assets. Who's going to buy them? If the aircraft will no longer generate the cash flows as contractually obligated, these assets must be written down to some value below their current historical cost reflected on the balance sheet.I'd love to hear a counter argument ….Short this equity until the market recovers."
