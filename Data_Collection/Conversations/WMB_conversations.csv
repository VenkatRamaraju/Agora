"10/18/21Raymond James Raises Price The Williams Companies, Inc. (WMB) $30.00 ➝ $33.00 Strong-Buy"
@Walker The pandemic has been going for close to 2 years so I am using that as a reference point. If you just hit the Yahoo chart for 2 years you see the 50 DMA is now crossing the 200 DMA along with SP being well above both. This is what some might call a golden cross if you have a strong hand IMHO
A new 52 week high. Does it trade sideways or does it back off the new high for a few weeks?
Can someone please explain the disconnect between the very high prices o0f natgas and the price of WMB? Shouldn't we be crushing it like all the other majors??
"Ya and Raymond James has gotten ZERO right on nat gas. They were short over 33mm shares of SWN, and kept downgrading and placing sell Reco on it , as SWN trades from 2 bucks to 6 bucks .I laughed all the way up , and sold it 3 days before they turned bullish . That marked the top . Do the opposite of Raymond James they Are Not a trading firm , actually not much of anything successfully at least when it comes to individual equities , perform due diligence , SWN prime example . Firms upgrade and raise price targets ONLY AFTER they are done accumulating. They are quiet when they are buying. And get publicly bullish AFTER the buying is over Come on bud . 101"
If we see the debt ratio much lower it is possible that the dividend will get raised next year on top of the buyback.
Deal with Iran coming before end of November . They have been working on it behind the scenes Which is why the US producers like WMB and Mro Have not hiked output
"1.5Billion buyback, earnings, etc. will push this well over 30 by EOM."

What has happened to this stock?
Looks like the profit taking dump is on. May have been wrong about 30 by EOM.
"Blackstone Inc. co-founder Stephen Schwarzman said the world is facing energy shortages so severe they could cause social unrest.His comments were echoed by Larry Fink, who said there’s a high probability of oil soon reaching $100 a barrel, especially with many governments and investors pushing back against investments in fossil fuels.“Inflation, we are in a new regime,” said Fink, chairman of BlackRock Inc, the world’s biggest asset manager.“There are many structural reasons for that. Short term policy related to environmentalism, in terms of restricting supply of hydrocarbons, has created energy inflation and we are going to be living with that for some time.”Several analysts have said that European countries could halt gas exports to neighbors if winter’s colder than normal and prices keep rising.$SU $CNQ $ENB $COP $BP $OXY $VET $XOM $TOT $CVX $MPC $EOG $CLR $EPD $E $KMI $PSX $HAL $PTR $SNP $WMB $BKR $EC $IMO $CQP $MMP $TRP $XOG"
"White House reviewing unleashing strategic oil reserve , in addition to probe they launched yesterday into oil price gauging …Great figures out luck !! I’m out"
If memory serves me correctly WMB bought an energy trading company in late spring. In this current environment how much will they add to revenue and EPS?
"October 26, 2021--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Williams’ (NYSE: WMB) board of directors has approved a regular dividend of $0.41 per share, or $1.64 annualized, on the company’s common stock, payable on Dec. 27, 2021, to holders of record at the close of business on Dec. 10, 2021.The dividend is consistent with the third-quarter 2021 dividend and is a 2.5% increase from Williams’ fourth-quarter 2020 quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share, paid in December 2020."
KMI came in 2 cents below concensus estimates. Let's see how the markets react to this
Absolutely atrocious price action the whole week before earnings. WHY?
WAY oversold!
"Man , WMB down another .09 cents on big after hours volume , big for WMB pre/post market close anyway. 550-600,000 shares. Looks like a rush to the exit , I guess can always sell and buy back cheaper and save 10-15% With this coming energy correction !!"
Anyone think WMB will hit 33 before year end?
