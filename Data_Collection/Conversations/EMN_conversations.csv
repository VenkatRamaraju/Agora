"103 today. So we're going to hit my target of 100, but don't buy yet. Look for 85 as a capitulation."
Great earnings....and an even better forecast....well above estimates....yet the stock is not really moving....don't get it....this thing should be around $110 AH....given they are forecast between $7.30 and $8.00 ESP for 2021....
That's now 7% it's went up since they said not to buy because of tariffs. Lol...
"OMG, Does this EVER stop going up?"
No not according to analyst perdiction coming into the earnings report. My more important question is did anyone expect the stock get a decent bump to the upside the next day after reporting 4 consecutive negative earnings report?

increasing Free Cash Flow expectations. Get ya some hack.
"I am so frustrated with the fluctuating behavior of Eastman's share price. Before retiring 4 years ago, I worked with some of its engineering people and they were quite sharp. I was quite impressed with their product line, and so invested in EMN about a year ago. I thought EMN would hit $130 by now. Next time it nears $109 a share - I am out of here."
"This is why I love Eastman, Dividend raise of over 6% and it don't matter what happens it goes up. At this point I think they could ban chemicals and it would be fine, lol...."

EMN is down 5.00% to 59.35

Isn't it Funny that the actual Chemical company did not get the gov loan to manufacture chemicals?
I think EMN might have reached its upward limit and that a pullback may be possible. I started receiving notifications from https://easystockalertss.blogspot.com/ the other week and so far they have presented interesting new trade ideas.
This stock was 109 on June 4. Not bad? That was 2018!
