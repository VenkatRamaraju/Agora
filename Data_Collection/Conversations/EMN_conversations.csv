Good entry point between 62 - 65.
the bottom appears to be in. get china trade agreement and back to 88 quickly.
Eastman Chemical reached a 52 Week low at 57.73
"Let's rock, gonna be a good earnings report, time to take out 110 again."
When was the last time they had an incredible earnings report? It’s gonna be about average and stock will move up at a very slow pace afterwards..that’s my quick summary.
"Ok, I guess I'll buy even more, lol. 3.8% yield? wow"
"I am so frustrated with the fluctuating behavior of Eastman's share price. Before retiring 4 years ago, I worked with some of its engineering people and they were quite sharp. I was quite impressed with their product line, and so invested in EMN about a year ago. I thought EMN would hit $130 by now. Next time it nears $109 a share - I am out of here."
Target $58. Thing is trading like a fast growing tech stock.
"Alright Eastman, let's go, get into the green."
The new #$%$ statue outside the headquarters of EMN is a jump the shark moment.
"Great buy at this level, wow."
TARGET $175.
Here's me now that EMN is below 100-
Saw the company on Mad Money last night - Very impressed with your plastic closed-loop recycling. You guys got a winner!
"ROFL, still didn't hit 100. Dude when you going to buy the dip already?"
This company looks very strong with deals with Procter and Gamble and great earnings !_
Here's John waiting for sub 100...
They had some interesting insights about EMN on (http://Fairstox.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
Eastman Chemical reached a 52 Week low at 43.19
"Do not have to be a fortune teller to know this. They have sucked for over a year but has done nothing to share price. At this pt, -50 EPS qoq and this goes up 2% at least lol..."
"Jabberwonky was watching his other stocks 2x while you were worried about $100. You should have bought in 2020. I don’t get it, EMN is a boring stock, you buy when it’s undervalued (and yield is larger), collect the dividends and forget about it."
Eastman Chemical reached a 52 Week low at 48.62
"Seriously? Doesn’t participate in market rally, plummets with market drop"
I’m in @ $100 and loving it. Target just moved to $140
So now we're closer to my 100 call. Jabberwonky is like
"EMN is a STOCK GOD, it can't be stopped!"
This stock was 109 on June 4. Not bad? That was 2018!
When was the last time you could say EMN is making fresh 52-wk highs. Buy and hold.
These guys bought a company that sold meth chemical ingredients to Mexican cartels.
"DOWNGRADED.....oh well. Keep buying, you won't see these prices for another 7 years :P"
"Bought another batch today as it moves up. I'll ride this dude out with the dividend through the bad times, it will bounce back."
"This is why I love Eastman, Dividend raise of over 6% and it don't matter what happens it goes up. At this point I think they could ban chemicals and it would be fine, lol...."
BOOM! Another great report Long and super strong in Eastman.
Does anyone recall the price range when the last split occurred?
"103 today. So we're going to hit my target of 100, but don't buy yet. Look for 85 as a capitulation."
Earknee here- It's a buy. I expect a change at the top.
Isn't it Funny that the actual Chemical company did not get the gov loan to manufacture chemicals?
Great earnings....and an even better forecast....well above estimates....yet the stock is not really moving....don't get it....this thing should be around $110 AH....given they are forecast between $7.30 and $8.00 ESP for 2021....
