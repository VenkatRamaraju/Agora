Conversation
it's down over comments that fintech is the future of financials but that's way overhyped. V can easily compete in every way and has the capital to do whatever they want.
Visa should go buy SOFI now before it grows to $100. But cheap and ride the growth.
im about to load back very heavy
"The view of the fintech payment solution obviously has introduced and opened broader market allocation. This opportunity persuaded convincingly many retail, institutional investors to diversify some of their positions in V and MA and re-distribute them as an early investment on other fintech disruptors. The Amazon integration with Affirm and SQ acquisition on Afterpay undeniably convinced the viability of a new payment solution. You can call it sell-of on fear but my point is this, the down price movement on V and MA is not a new phenomenon, knowing that V and MA have experienced this low-tide season before with an early introduction of eBay, Paypal, Amazon pay and apple pay, not to mention Alipay, WeChat, etc. The fact is V and MA will survive with their agile ability to “partner” and integrate with any new payment solution, rather than imploding massive merger and acquisition costs to one or more of these latest fintech solutions. How many that they can partner with is unlimited, while acquiring all is not possible.I think embracing disruptive ideas through optimizing effective revenue generation while the fundamental model of the V and MA business remains strong and unchallenged is extremely wise. One good example to consider is the expansion of Coinbase technology into V workable-solution which has generated billions of dollars in new revenue for both entities. It created a new model of fintech echo-system. It did not eradicate V and MA; It may them stronger. What do you think?"
OMG 7pts! what gives?
Why Is visa falling like this? Thank you.
V is still a bargain. Visa has a $279.99 yahoo price target! Good luck all!
I just bought. Forever stock
buy at this price and hold forever
"OK OK. Here is the deal, I am SELLING one (1) share of Visa at $225.35. This strategic move on my part is based on proven record that whenever I sell the share price usually goes up rapidly. Thank me later when we get back to $260.....LOL."
"Who is doing a better job of staying relevant in other fintech areas, V or MA? PayPal has around the same revenue as V. That was a shocker to me. Worried that these new fintech plays can use closed ecosystems to avoid needing payment infrastructure of V and MA. With more agility and network effects.."
A show of hands: How many of you bought in @ 219 yesterday?
Hilarious that internet trolls think they can affect the price of the 12th largest market cap in the world.
Just can’t win if this misses it could be real damming. The facts are just that every investor in V is scared.
Bought 119 flat. Ride it into earnings. I believe many people are basically living off their credit cards in this economy to make ends meet
"Ms. Omarova believes capital and credit should be directed by an unaccountable bureaucracy and intelligentsia. She has recommended a ‘National Investment Authority,’ with members overseen by an advisory board of academics, to finance a ‘big and bold’ climate agenda. Sounds like the green infrastructure bank the Senate rejected."
This is a significant dip considering the last week or so of dropping as well. Adding here for sure
I will buy a positiin here
What is our support level $223?
"For the long share holders, just hold and wait, why selling now at a low price? For the buyers, it is normal that we all want to jump in and buy a good stock like V as cheap as possible, buying the dip, bargaining... V is a good stock, most of us have V credit card (besides MA card) to buy/pay stuff like the basic necessities, food/groceries, bills, home repair/accessories, medical prescriptions/co-pay, medical/car insurance, gas, and other expenses, etc. I am sure V will go back up more than the current today's price. The only regret I had was I did not buy more shares when it was very low/cheap in the past. So far I have been getting V dividends reinvested so V is still giving me a good profit, and V is still one stock that I am holding for a long term although I was tempted to sell my shares when it reached its 1-year highs. I decided not to sell because I do not want to pay more taxes (the short term capital gain, sorry uncle Sam). Obviously V gives me much more profit than CD bank rates. There are other (riskier) stocks which might give better performance but I chose (safer) V to stick with and stay for a long term.Today some nervous people were selling their long shares for a loss or a tiny profit (afraid of losing more than their original purchase price/share), or perhaps desperately due to some margin calls of other losing (not the V) stocks, they are forced to sell their long stock shares at the current bid price."
Its just dark clouds on $V and $MA nowadays..will get through this very soon and we will have our smile back again Stay long
Forget $240 this week. Next week $242
back to 52weeks high in no time $MA
Something to do with bitcoin going up ??
Mortgage apps fell to the most in many months as homebuilder pulte home selling off on warning...Now that stimulus running out and easy credit spent lets see how many pay back their bills to Visa....hmmmm
It’s holding above the 200 sma. Might have to sell my MasterCard shares and put it into visa.
First class stock
What the hell?
Long way down from $252. I did not expect this during the covid recovery. Consumers are spending more and this is dropping more.
Avg down after earnings
buy the dip! once covid cases start to drop big money will be rotating back into V
Double bottom
"What do you make of the article on BBC about ""Researchers find Apple Pay, Visa contactless hack"".I'm long, new, but with a small investment, 3 shares"
$248 to get back to even
below 50 moving average for Visa is always a buy opportunity.
V continues to under perform other financials and the market as a whole. Dividend is nominal. I am selling all my shares. I can get better returns in other places. V may be an OK company but the fintec's are cutting iinto their turf in a big way. SQ and PYPL taking share.
"Was up 6 percent ytd yesterday and now 2.7 ytd. I'm sorry but that is pretty bad no matter how you cut it. Considering how ""well"" the market is doing. It's one thing for a correction during good times, but we aren't even on that ride. I'm pairing down once it gets to 230 again."
Nice bounce back from V. I actually bought it at the close - again. The price is definitely bullish (closed barely below 224). I think this is setting the stage for 225-227 tmrw easy.
Hi I bought last month or so and I am down 7%. Should I hold or sell. Why all others are down too MA and AXP. Thank you.
V is great for trading today!
Lost over $20 from its high. lordy
"Opened puts all the way down to 222.90 and sold, bought shares and opening a call. Take the emotions out of trading ladies and gents, there’s money to be made!"
Visa building access for crypto liquidity. More like stealing for their treasury.
why is this dropping? any news
"I don't fully understand the appeal of bnpl because it still costs the consumer more money in the end. I'd rather just pay my balance off in full each month and get rewards. I also saw an ad by Visa today titled ""coming soon, Visa installments""."
Down by leaps and bounds had this really WRONG
"up less than 8% in the last year, visas growth is finally slowing down wow"
V is below 220 tmr!
@David I pay zero interest by paying my balance each month plus I get 2 percent cash back on EVERY purchase. They even give me free cell phone insurance and all my purchases are protected.
Oh God...I have 120 shares of this...why didn't I sell all when it was in the 240s...
Come on every single day is going down???
"V is outperforming MA this year! Literally, their P/E will be the same! V is surging back! "
"We are headed back to $200, and possibly lower than that."
"Yes v is the best stock I have ever owned since the IPO, it’s never let me down year after year."
Investors also may be concerned about stiffer regulatory scrutiny of Visa’s debit business. The Justice Department opened an antitrust investigation into the company’s practices in March. And the Federal Reserve announced Friday that it’s seeking public comment on potential rule changes for debit that could open the market to more independent debit networks for online transactions.
ya I'm waiting to see if this is going below 215 then I'll start to add. avg is 227 no stress no seeds no stems
Can't find any news for the dip. Is it Paypal and Square related? Those are pretty flat today.
"All told, Visa stock gained 76% between its March 2020 low and this July's high, leaving it primed for profit-taking, which most investors did following the release of fiscal third-quarter results. Quarterly revenue of $6.1 billion was up 27% year over year, easily topping estimates. CFO Vasant Prabhu also made a point of saying during the company's third-quarter conference call that the spread of COVID-19's delta variant wasn't crimping consumer spending. But, as was the case with Boeing, investors aren't quite buying it -- at least not like they were just a month before."
I heard about V the other day on (http://Multistockalerts.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
$300 price target
"Hoping to see mid-220's shortly if market dips a bit here. V below 220 would be a very good purchase, but if the market corrects more strongly, people here will be surprised to see V near $200 per share. I'd be buying strong at lower levels. Lets hope we get the chance."
"Time for the SEC to get involved and look into the price manipulation of this company. I get it, The Delta variant is putting a damper on spending. Does that mean this stock should be sold off down to $50?"
A lot of people are worried about BNPL. Visa has their own version of this called Visa Installments. It's still in it's infancy and will continue to expand. A company like Visa is not going to let other BNPL's walk all over them. Buy and Hold.
Visa at a 2-month low. Great time to average up. completely oversold
Retail sales were super. V is headed to $300 by Christmas
"This is that perfect moment — should one have liquidity to do so — to back up the proverbial truck and load up on V. In less than twelve months, we'll all look back and say, ""why didn't I BUY in October 2021?"""
Good dip to buy
Seems like a lot of misinformation/noise out there..Both Visa & MasterCard dominate in debit cards (one of the cheapest fees for merchants) and PayPal / Square on average have some higher processing fees. PayPal just raised their fee to I believe 3.49% plus a $0.49 flat fee (SQ is still a little lower then PayPal) where Visa ranges from 1.43- 2.4% on avg for swiping and MasterCard range from 1.55-2.6% on swipes and I believe both have a $0.10 flat fee.American Express rates are more robust with an avg of 2.5-3.5% swipe fees pls a flat fee.There are also other fees when u get into boarder crossings etc.. But at least in the U.S. ppl need to look into specifics for themselves. Visa can leverage their huge built system to have some of the lower costs for merchants w/ the largest amount of CC/debit cards. That system provides for huge profit margins while they continue to innovate new technologies and partnerships/acquisitions
Backing up the truck

got it at 223.51$ 50% of my stacks in
"Here is some info I find on AFFIRM Pay As You GO:Terms and ratesLoan amounts Up to $17,500Typical APR 10% - 30% (0% available at some retailers)Origination fee NoneFunding time ImmediatePayment plans 3, 6, 12, 24, or 36 months (longer terms available at some retailers)Soft credit check? YesQualification criteria No minimum credit score and no minimum credit historyBest for Borrowers new to credit who want to pay for a big purchase over timePros & consPros-Quick access to cash — Affirm is excellent if you need to make an urgent purchase but do not have a credit card.-Good interest rates — The interest rate offered on the purchase is much lower than what you would get elsewhere.-Take time making your payments — Affirm lets you make consistent payment plan spread over a long time.Cons-You won't get approved if you don't have good credit — You'll need to have a good credit score to qualify for an Affirm loan.-You may have to pay a downpayment — For some borrowers, Affirm asks for a down payment that must be paid during purchase. This can be anywhere from 10% - 50% of the cost of the item."
Picked up around 10k of this and Mastercard on this recent dip. Both great and safe long term holds
"Bottom line is Visa is one of the top three stocks you could possibly own, great dividends too !"
"OK I sold all of my Visa after holding them since IPO. There's a good chance it will go back to $250 by year end. But also a good chance that it could go well under $200 if the competition is strong and Covid keeps people around the world stuck at home. I'm seeing a huge uptake of online payment alternatives. Merchants don't have to use the Visa network and pay a 3% swipe transaction fee. Customers also can use Paypal, bank transfer Debit card, and BNPL. It seems there are far more options for payments than the old credit card method? One thing certain, people's habits are hard to change. If they are stuck doing online purchases and find that they don't have to use a credit card, they may not go back to use them. Then you have issues like Amazon Sg that is imposing a transaction fee on Visa credit card use on the buyer. I dunno, what are your guys thoughts? Visa is a long running payment processing company.... with it's moat severely compromised. I thought long and hard and would be surprised if Visa still maintains it's top leadership in payment processing in the long term future."
"Visa Instalments is a payment technology created by Visa that enables issuers to offer instalment plans for their cardholders under their existing credit account lines, and for participating merchants to display the instalment plans to eligible cardholders. Do you really think visa and MasterCard don’t have this service."
Shorts rule this stock for the last 3 months!!
"The whole BNPL seems like an American thing as in Canada outside furniture stores and appliance stores, noone else offers it. Amazon has like 10 items it offers some form of it. It is not widespread whatsoever. In my eyes nothing has changed up here in Canada. Definitely an American thing."
The BNPL hype is a joke...time for V to show some muscle now
Been like a 1 month ship wreck
$MA
V has crossed over into oversold bucket.*** It’s a great time for bargai hunting and for V longs with the ability to tactfully expand their stake in the dynamic duo of V & MA!
You have to go back to October 2020 for this low of an RSI. I am in as of today
Is that green I see????
Better buy now before it makes the big move UP. Buy low sell high!
"Visa is a buy and hold forever, selling this stock doesn't make sense"
My guess V is going to miss eps
When I see a multi-billion dollar blue chip stock growing with people spending money with credit cards and the stock down over 3% I get so happy. This stock for the last 5 years has a daily standard deviation of 1.62% and a daily average move of .09%. That means today's move is testing those empirical probabilities. The 200 day moving average is at 222.40 so you better believe I loaded up today and any move lower another 5 years from now only increases the number of factors my money will grow.
Deff adding more at this price
"Sea of red today, stocks on sale everywhere. Pick your stocks, buy some, and then hold."
"forever chart have many dips, always been back up with new records high in history. just buy and hold at this price"
Today’s price manipulation is for the upcoming surge! 
"What are goog entry-points for V and MA, after last month's drop?Anyone call tell me that from graphical analysis of these stocks?"
The original buy now pay later.. 
There will be a great buying opportunity at maybe 210 or so after the next market correction.
Can't be flat for 2 years :) ounce the cash stops flowing the credit king wins again. :)
Stock buy backs let’s go lol
Just follow this manipulation to accumulate…
"Buy and hold, zoom out of the chart and relax"
panick sellers will regret. This is going back to 250 on earnings season
"BUY Limit order filled at $216.96 today. As the market corrects, more of these V limit orders will get filled."
The chicken little short parade ran for cover today
I doubt companies like the buy now pay later are going to take too much of V's business. I doubt airlines will do it because the cost is like 4 of 5% that they would have to pay and they only have to pay like 2% to take a V card. The losers who don't have credit cards don't fly anyway. WMT will only take Affirm on something that costs $150 and you can only have that in the basket. You can't load up all your groceries and a big tv and hope to get it on Affirm.
Who else added Visa when it went down to 220?
"Bought 400 shares at the ipo price. Sold about 100 at 220. I was overweight and still am with Visa. This stock is lagging this year moreso than normal. Usually dips after earnings then rises, but going from 250 to high 220s is a big drop. Should be in the 240s. It is frustrating to say the least only being up barely 6 percent for the year which is lousy compared to the index. Visa needs to do more to stabilize this and project more confidence."
Visa is getting into crypto. Enough said.If Visa was not getting into crypto at this stage in the game I might have sold all more holdings. and I have been holding since IPO I am a veteran V holder.
Let’s open green!
"People here who keep posting about V dropping on ""no news"" have their head in the sand. There is huge news - Affirm and Square and PayPal and several other new companies are where the younger generation is headed. Credit card interest rates are obscene, and in the new world you can pay over time with NO interest. Wake up, folks! And, no, I am not short. I just dropped by here to see the comments and I am amazed at the lack of understanding."
Keep adding.
I love Visa and MasterCard. The problem is new technology may be able to circumvent these charge cards payment and fee structure. Only time will tell whether credit cards will become obsolete or somehow v and ma will adapt and prevail. Lets hope these are great companies.
"Another great opportunity to buy V low, the more it drops, the more I buy."
Can’t believe the mistake I made here.
one up day in last 3 weeks....................gotta be kidding!
buy at 220
"Why is Macys, the Gap, carmax and bed bath and beyond tanking ?"

Congratulations to all $225 PUT holders. You've been assigned!
all in. you can critisize me all you want
Was a nice add this morning under $119
one of the few stocks up in a very diverse portfolio today
Visa looks oversold. Buying opportunity?
300 limit order at $180
Bought 11 shares today
"Do your own due diligence, this is a winner,with many money making business connections , PayPal , Square, all Banks."
"Later today or tomorrow will come supportive comments about V and MA. These drops on no news are puzzling but short term, it appears."
Guess 235 wasnt the dip
"I have a bad feeling that ""V"" is going to miss on earnings."
"JPM today adjusted V price target upward to $267 from $249, reiterates Overweight."
"I expect this to go up soon based on a completely non-scientific piece of data. Look at the 5-year or all-time charts for Visa. The biggest dips, comparable to what we're seeing now tend to last at most about 3 months before the trend reverses and it heads back up.Well... it's been about three months, and it's not like Visa is going to fade away into irrelevance anytime in the near future, so upsie-daisy incoming!"
"I'm having some concerns on Visa's competitiveness against upcoming payment options like Affirm. If consumers can choose a different way to pay, then I do believe this is a threat to Visa's model. It use to be Visa could pride on it's global network system. But places like Amazon, you can do away with credit card use with services like Paypal. Even on the retail #$%$ end, there's Square. The banks need to be careful as their days of charging 20% pa credit are over with Affirm or Afterpay coming out. I will be looking at an exit point later this year on Visa. Sad to make such comments of this being a holder since their IPO."
Any bad news???
"as said yesterday, there needs to be positive news related to their services. there may be a return to 230-235 but there will be resistance going further to its previous highs with people cutting their losses on the way up"
Visa has been taking a hit ever since it topped 250. Today's crazy volume can be attributed to quadruple witching.

"V and MA will be obsolete. By the way, I came from 2050."
"this stock has dragged down my portfolio so much. have so much equity locked away that isn't doing anything but shedding more. this is all without a mass market correction, which could drag this down to 210."
"oversold. just barely above a 3 month low. If you have cash on hand, this is the stock to buy"

No looking good !
I guess I don’t see what’s keeping this down. Adding here as well
"Flat fee for credit cards should be .05Swipes should be only .45 a swipe . Swipes at $1.40 or Higher is customer rippoffs and should be illegal.All credit card company's should be fined and ordered to pay all it's members $12,000.00 each."
200dma seems to have acted as support. Glad to see the bleeding stopped. Expecting a reversal
I want more V at $220 tomorrow. On NO NEWS (again). Accumulate.
"all this company needs is some sort of innovation news and the stock will jump. it and MA have just been getting battered by positive news from SQ, PYPL and Affirm"
V is going to be the best beneficiary when FED raises rates later this year! V is rallying back from here! the hugest auto-pay cash cow
Told you folks here yesterday was the most rewarding day to load up V! LOL
Fees are coming down Visa coming down. I think I bought at the worst possible timing
Average down but V is falling so hard I don’t have a clue
V is about to break out 15-25%
https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/cryptocurrency/articles/visas-new-payment-system-will-accept-everything-from-bitcoin-to-dollars/
"3 million shares puked up this morning, in the first hour of trading, what big manager is dumping?"
Today is the most rewarding day to load up V! It’ll surge up from here!
"People are buying and spending and traveling and planning holidays after 18 months of COVID shutdowns. Like MA there is ZERO reason to be stuck down here in the $220's. Visa needs to break out as we get closer to to ER at end of month. People are shopping early as supply chain issues and inflation are worrisome, so holiday shopping signals positive strong season.V has tested $221 (200 DMAV) a few times recently, and has held....if we break it next time around we will see $206. I'll be adding at both these levels but wish we simply get back to recent highs and land somewhere around $260....this is where V should be."
Selling visa today really a sick position. Can anyone figure when to avg down? No didn’t think so
"V & MA are currently trading on sale in the bargain bin!*** Don’t hesitate, nor; look into this “gift horse’s mouth” — just buy, and give thanks to Providence for this opportunity!!!"
"Added 20 more! As of today, I have 100 shares of V"
"This goes to the new or recent shareholders of both $V and $MA. Just be patient, last year these two stocks were slow but steady for the months of Aug, Sept and Oct. Once you get passed those you'll be glad that you held. I've gone through this same scenario last year and held strong because I believe in both companies. Never selling these two stocks! Long term investment. I'm just hoping they split shares so I can accumulate more. GLTA"
"We're above the 200 day moving average now and touching the 20 day, now we shoot for the 50 day. It's been a long slow decline since July, think we're in for a bounce upward?"
Picked up 50 shares not much but Iat these prices why not
Huge rally for V ＆ MA tmr!
new highs on the way next month before earnings $ MA
Bitcoin is rallying! V is the most visionary Fin-tech! V is building the hugest Fin-ecosystem for the future! 
Sell this week and buy it back after it drops. Market crash coming soon.
"Something's wrong with the stock. I think it peaked at $249 a couple months ago and now it's either flat or going back downhill. I'm issuing a ""sell"" advisory."
can anyone tell me what is wrong with this stock?
I wouldn't be surprised if there is a fair bit more of selling ahead. I think these companies will be fine in the long run but their valuations are very high already. With new competition it makes sense for the valuations to come in a bit. I'm kind of excited to be able to buy in to V & MA but i'd like to wait a bit longer before jumping in.
"as mentioned many times by now any positive AFRM, SQ, PYPL or any b.n.p.l. news will drive this and MA down. Visa is apparently in the works for an installment plan. They need that or some other positive news like a better rewards card to get this above 235."
Why is it down?
Sell or Buy???
GOP pansies; never work nor getting anything done except discord and crying in the corner... they won't vote to raise the very same debt ceiling they voted for three times in the recent past? NEVER GOP
"Successful people don't become that way overnight. What most people see at a glance wealth, a great career, purpose is the result of hard work and hustle over time. I pray that anyone reads this will be successful in life"
BNPL is a recipe for a disaster. VISA will once again prove to the world that they are the Dominate.
What’s the next price point y’all looking to add to? 212? I bought at 219.. one year leap for 230call
The Most reliable stock I have ever owned !!! Over 10 years of positive gains.
$v and $ma will go back up anyway. esoecially on a market correction lol
Dec 17 (65d) 250 C
Bottom line this stock was trading at $252 today $226 and nobody knows why.
Breakout begins folks
Look at the volume! somebody really wants to sell V.
I support visa so I bought 777 shares
"guys, why is it down in August? any idea?"
BNPL trend will only boost VISA's sale as it will make people spend more without realizing they do. at the end of the day you will still have to pay with credit or debit.
it appears downtown josh brown on half time just sold his MA and market is following with AFRM news
Good buying opportunity in V. All in.
"I guess the Affirm company Visa. The ner do wells can buy something without a credit check and pay on time. There are no late fees--- so why not pay late? I hope Affirm finds out if you don't do a credit check and you don't charge late fees, you won't collect either."
"any bad news to explain this drop? unbeliavable, who sells Visa?"
"Sometimes being a Long - Investor can be a drag.. like a lot of V and seeing that the high prior to pandemic was ~$215 (18mths ago) and we are only up a bit over 9% since then.. Patience sure is a virtue, but once we get past the Delta variant and more ppl are vaccinated, $V will take-off with huge Rev/Profit increases"
Visa will close in the red because of affirm results
Just bought some shares at 220. Great company.
"Visa, MasterCard, PayPal, square. IF you could only pick 2 for the next 10 years, what would you pick?"
Stock Price Target VHigh $309.00Median $281.00
"Adding, but plenty of powder ready if V dips more."
Consumer spending is strong. $300 by Christmas
Can you imagine $Visa falling -57% from $232 to $100 and initiating a short position at $100? That’s what the amateur shorts did as $BABA fell from $319.32 to $138.44. Mouthy amateur shorts got excited and piled in. The good news is they were warned the whole time
and let's not forget Visa's 45 PE !! if future earnings are going down or the Covid is not going to restart more international traveling... watch out! There are a lot of better picks with a much lower PE ratio.
"3 reasons to buy and hold V or MA. 1. BNPL and Cryto payment system will be announced eventually. 2. Once BNPL customers gain credits, they will add or move into credit card becuz there are points! Big spenders are going to choose V against BNPL for those points.3. Look at the ops margin! And rate hikes will bring more fortunes."
"Still an excellent stock, excellent company. Buying opportunity for long-term investors."
Why is this stock still so expensive? I like the company and it deserves a premium valuation but still. Costco is probably more expensive though but still... I'm a buyer at lower levels.
Anyone know any good books or info on Bear Call Spreads?
Globalist tax scheme approved. You voted for it....
"BNPL will worse V's growth? LOL. I'm an investing on Upstart and Affirm as well but and BNPL looks promising but eventually those low or no credit customers will gain their credits and they will open regular credit card too. So booming BNPL is only going to add more V users at the end. Also who know if V will do its own BNPL like AMEX? lol On Thursday, September 9, Vasant Prabhu, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, will present at the virtual Deutsche Bank Technology Conference. The discussion will begin at 11:50 a.m. Eastern Time and last for approximately 35 minutes."
"It might go down to 210 or 200 during in the coming weeks, but then, it's a huge buying opportunity. 240 again soon."
Visa is the one stock to own. It's the true bitcoin before there was bitcoin. Billions of dollars and other currencies passing through nano technology in a split second. They don't lend either so they can't lose. The leaders in fintech always have been always will be. Also highest number of not only credit transaction but also debit.
consumer spending up. Great news for Visa.
I just had a very serious conversation with a Visa credit card customer disservice person who was clearly a foreigner who gave me a fake name who literally gave me no service at all. Have fun owning Visa.
Back to the races. New high is in the near future. Can't keep this behemoth down for long.
"This is part 1 of a 13 part thread on Twitter that every V holder needs to go to Twitter and read:Alex Rampell @arampell1/ Why is “Buy Now, Pay Later” (BNPL) an early threat to trillions of dollars of market cap - Visa (almost $500B), MasterCard ($350B), card issuing banks, acquiring banks/services (Fiserv, FIS, Global Payments, etc)?"
Buy in increments! Not all at once. You may get a better deal tomorrow or next week. If you don't own any yet then buy a quarter position right now and then add more if it goes down in the coming days.
Buying visa today
"Its been a nice run, but getting ready to sell my shares before the big market crash. Once this goes over $230 again I sell."
Bet it jumps up over a dollar in the last 30 minutes of trade then probably a little more in AH trading.
