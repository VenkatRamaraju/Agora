Visa down 3% MasterCard up 3%? Pretty similar earnings to me.. guess the MA outperformance continues that gap had closed over recent months

Amazon’s Singapore Surcharge May Signal Sea Change Ahead On Cards
Why Is visa falling like this? Thank you.
Is this due to the AFRM and AMZN deal? V should be $260 at least by now.
"when will this hit bottom? 230, 235? looking to load back up"
Mr.Market is overreacting. Time is ours!!!
All time high
(http://Stocks-tracker.com) is a must for any trader. Their watchlist which covers pre-market movers is one of the best researched in the industry. I don’t start trading without reading their daily email each morning!
Way over valued!!!!
$300 stock after earnings
it appears downtown josh brown on half time just sold his MA and market is following with AFRM news
The bar is set extremely low compared to last year. Businesses were closed and travel didn’t exist. Still cheap at this level.
I've owned since IPO. Mastercard always perform better than Visa.Looks like the table has turned!
cryptocurrency has been fluctuating lately with the price and as an investor with good strategy i had nothing to worry about because i use the best of strategies and very accurate signals which i acquire from a professional and very skliled day trader and crypto analyst Mrs Charlotte Walter with herhelp i've made over 3.8BTC and some ETH and you can all reach her via her only telegram @charlotttradefx for all crypto related issues...
V has crossed over into oversold bucket.*** It’s a great time for bargai hunting and for V longs with the ability to tactfully expand their stake in the dynamic duo of V & MA!
How low will it go?
This is the most oversold I've ever seen Visa and I've owned since the IPO. This is a pound the table buy moment.
"36 on the RSI index. I’m picking up few more shares tomorrow, I think $230 is the floor."
What a disappointing week! No one likes this 0.5? surcharge #$%$
Bought two stocks V BHP SOLE OFF RADICALLY I GIVE UP NO MORE
They had some interesting insights about V on (http://Thetraderguide.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
…watch how 5 min before market close is going back to $238 - $240 range.
Today Baird adjust V up from $208 to $305 — maintains outperform rating.
Today’s chart is going to bring V back above 235!
$300 price target this year
"India's RBL Bank signs up Visa after cenbank ban on MastercardBENGALURU, July 15 (Reuters) - India's RBL Bank (RATB.NS) said on Thursday it has signed up Visa Inc (V.N) for its credit cards, a day after India's central bank decided to bar rival payments company Mastercard Inc (MA.N) from issuing new debit or credit cards in the country."
Just buy more and forget it!

Sell the news is whats happening
Gifted time to buy and accumulate Will be rewarded in couple of months if not weeks
"New all-time @ 238.65! Toot, toot!"
"Hoping to see mid-220's shortly if market dips a bit here. V below 220 would be a very good purchase, but if the market corrects more strongly, people here will be surprised to see V near $200 per share. I'd be buying strong at lower levels. Lets hope we get the chance."
Can we see a stock split ?
"Visa, MasterCard, Discovery and Amex will be crushed if a bipartisan bill in Congress allows the courts to now allow people declaring bankruptcy to clear the student debt load as well. This will make tens of thousands of Americans declare bankruptcy to get rid of their student debt and while they are at it, any of their revolving credit debt as well. It could get very bloody for quite some time."
$300 after earnings
Someone wants to make us sell before the earnings rally. I'm not falling for it.
I guess I don’t see what’s keeping this down. Adding here as well
$300 price target in 2021
RSI is around 40 right now. We’re slowly creeping into the oversold territory
Bought 30 more shares @ $235.50
"Added 20 more! As of today, I have 100 shares of V"
Huge rally for V ＆ MA tmr!
Thinking visa drops around the $210/215$ mark. Would add around there
Love to read the well wishers on here.
Cashless society
Back in bidzness.
Buying opportunity
Bought at $248 got the snot knocked out of me
I told you countless times this is where you need to be post pandemic. It's still not late. $300 in under a year.
Why V is dropping?
"Daiwa Capital Markets downgraded AXP, MA & V. (ALL 3)!"
Was there a good news? how come this went up?
Xfrank declares this the last opportunity to buy this cheap. This is the same fellow who insists BABA is going to $300 soon. V over time definitely will be higher
Read about NEE success and buy the stock now.
-7% for the last month could get even worse. The worst timing for me. Miss eps
will never understand this stock. so undervalued yet always underperforms
Visa should already be trading above $300. Strong buy!
Ex dividend day.
Per Whisper numbers $1.39...... consensus $1.33 $5.83 billion
can anyone tell me what is wrong with this stock?
"back to school shopping, buy visa and walmart and just kick back"
buy v and aapl
Is the delta variant going to keep driving visa and MasterCard down?
this baby won't stop
"Sometimes being a Long - Investor can be a drag.. like a lot of V and seeing that the high prior to pandemic was ~$215 (18mths ago) and we are only up a bit over 9% since then.. Patience sure is a virtue, but once we get past the Delta variant and more ppl are vaccinated, $V will take-off with huge Rev/Profit increases"
"V longs should never be concerned about traders “selling on the news” because in my 6+ years being long V — selling the good news at earnings is an ginormous opportunity to buy on these types of selling for HUGE gains!*** I always set aside some cash for these kinds of occasions with MA and V.— Grab a copy of the CC and study it tonight, because V’s business is thriving more than ever!"
V exceeded 1 year its record high for 2 days in a row so far. I like it and enjoy the ride but will V break its 1Y-record high daily? I am normally a long holder but I am tempted of selling my shares and then buying back later.
"Long term visa holder here, seems like a rising risk that platforms like square and PayPal that are moving toward cutting out the middle man / closed loop financial system for users will replace the incumbents. Interested to hear other long term views on this"
The Olympics should be good for V. You know everyone won't be changing their currency for the yen to buy anything.
let see where is the bottom
There will be a great buying opportunity at maybe 210 or so after the next market correction.
Will this finish Red?
$300 in 2021
"Visa stock is a no brainer. It's the largest credit card and debit card by amount of card holders and transactions. It doesn't lend money so it doesn't lose money when people default. Its all about electronic money, trillions pouring in like a downpour every day. 350 by this December."
"well, at least we hit new high. Great stock."
Visa declares $0.32 dividend
$300 before next earnings
why is AXP up and V down?
A new all-time high. Where is everybody?
This stock *always* bounced back and ended up being the best position in my portfolio.
"$V is Back on the Growth Train! Q3 Results were even better than Q3 2019 by 10+% on earnings (1.49 vs 1.35) & 5% on revenue (6.13B vs 5.84B)!Buy your growth train tickets now.. Travel industry still opening in the U.S. & still has to open worldwide - this is not even considering the US economy only really started opening up in late May to early June (only 4-6 weeks of Q3).Now, Factor in the upcoming Fee increases, rest of the world opening up as well as other high growth areas such as India where other CC companies such as $MA & Amex are currently banned from adding new clients & this train will be flying"
Visa is getting into crypto. Enough said.If Visa was not getting into crypto at this stage in the game I might have sold all more holdings. and I have been holding since IPO I am a veteran V holder.
"""(Bloomberg) -- Visa Inc. is considering requiring employees to get Covid-19 vaccines ahead of asking them to return to offices in the fall.""Only a fascist management would consider that."
"V, MA, FISV, GPN, FIS all down due to the disruptive ""buy now, pay later"" company being acquired by SQ. AFRM up 15% because it also is involved in that payment system."
"oversold. just barely above a 3 month low. If you have cash on hand, this is the stock to buy"
Could Visa buy either Square or Paypal? Does it fit strategically?
"This goes to the new or recent shareholders of both $V and $MA. Just be patient, last year these two stocks were slow but steady for the months of Aug, Sept and Oct. Once you get passed those you'll be glad that you held. I've gone through this same scenario last year and held strong because I believe in both companies. Never selling these two stocks! Long term investment. I'm just hoping they split shares so I can accumulate more. GLTA"
Visa at a 2-month low. Great time to average up. completely oversold
This is the only stock in my portfolio that I automatically get the divies re-invested. Set it and forget it. What a stock. Been in since the IPO and hasn't given me one grey hair yet.
JMIA like V might be a great buy at this time with JMIApay.
"Seems like V is holding strong above $230 support and maintaining $235 level. This is a good sign for V to rise further to $240. If we can get there and start to see accumulation at $240, then we will see $260 plus by next ER."
I just bought. Forever stock
it's funny that ppl are selling cuz of the BNPL hype....you know ppl can make those bi-weekly payments with their Visa card right? lol
"I'm having some concerns on Visa's competitiveness against upcoming payment options like Affirm. If consumers can choose a different way to pay, then I do believe this is a threat to Visa's model. It use to be Visa could pride on it's global network system. But places like Amazon, you can do away with credit card use with services like Paypal. Even on the retail #$%$ end, there's Square. The banks need to be careful as their days of charging 20% pa credit are over with Affirm or Afterpay coming out. I will be looking at an exit point later this year on Visa. Sad to make such comments of this being a holder since their IPO."
"Adding, but plenty of powder ready if V dips more."
"Cheap shares for sale, BUY!"
Headed to $300
Didn't Visa go down last quarter even with a beat?
V has hit gift horse  buying opportunity level!
What the hell is going on why are ppl selling with such amazing revenues?
BNPL trend will only boost VISA's sale as it will make people spend more without realizing they do. at the end of the day you will still have to pay with credit or debit.
The original buy now pay later.. 
what does it have to reach to hit a split? 300? 400? 500?
"clearly oversold. Strong buy, of course"
Bought the dip again. As I've done for 7 years...
I look for a pull back after earnings but Hope I'm wrong.
$300 when people begin traveling and eating out.
my Target jump in is 200 wish I was in on this already
"VISA Scraping the Bottom of the Barrel: GIG WORKERShttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3H2As_nelY&ab_channel=VisaAfter watching this Visa add for ""payday"", it disgusted me to my core. All the ""coloured"" workers and one ""geriatric Gardner"" getting paid are ""gig-workers"". Their salary is measured in terms of pennies or pence.They are considered as the bottom of the barrel workforce, marginally higher than pan handlers on the roadside demanding to wash your SUV windshield with the stolen scrubber from the nearby gas station.These ""gig-workers"" income is first scalped 30% by the App Employer. The App Employer are also repulsed by their workforce, and do not classify them as ""employees"".This is the target sector VISA wants to attract? These mentally incompetent workforce that can't attain a normal job? Common VISA you are better than this. Target the upper middle class or wealthy workforce with disposable income. To heck with ""Gig-Workers"", the cancer of any economy."
"I can't explain how you make me feel right now the joy in me is unexplainable I have made over $110,000 for the past months through @brianfxtrade platform I’m really grateful Brian thank you so much you can contact him via Telegram @brianfxtrade"
Why V down -1.80% today ?
VISA AND MASTER CARD ARE IT'S NOT TOO LATE TO GET ON BOARD. I think Visa is a better buy!
"For the long share holders, just hold and wait, why selling now at a low price? For the buyers, it is normal that we all want to jump in and buy a good stock like V as cheap as possible, buying the dip, bargaining... V is a good stock, most of us have V credit card (besides MA card) to buy/pay stuff like the basic necessities, food/groceries, bills, home repair/accessories, medical prescriptions/co-pay, medical/car insurance, gas, and other expenses, etc. I am sure V will go back up more than the current today's price. The only regret I had was I did not buy more shares when it was very low/cheap in the past. So far I have been getting V dividends reinvested so V is still giving me a good profit, and V is still one stock that I am holding for a long term although I was tempted to sell my shares when it reached its 1-year highs. I decided not to sell because I do not want to pay more taxes (the short term capital gain, sorry uncle Sam). Obviously V gives me much more profit than CD bank rates. There are other (riskier) stocks which might give better performance but I chose (safer) V to stick with and stay for a long term.Today some nervous people were selling their long shares for a loss or a tiny profit (afraid of losing more than their original purchase price/share), or perhaps desperately due to some margin calls of other losing (not the V) stocks, they are forced to sell their long stock shares at the current bid price."
will be $275 in a month or two
"V is currently trading in way,WAY oversold territory!*** This is great buying opportunity for V longs with the resources to make the most of this opportunistic decline on very low volume!"
"i guess a 1.3% sell off isn't that bad, if its going to drop let it really drop"
You mean to tell me people are buying crypto with there Visa/ MasterCards ?Well there definitely not using paper.
"Bought in the $30s and have consistently added to my position on each down-dip, for years. Look at the chart(s). No brainer. Visa is, everywhere."
I will buy a positiin here
I bought at $248 so I am down only $17 in about 3 weeks. Obviously I don’t know what I am doing.
"Visa is buying Currencycloud in a deal valuing the British payments start-up at £700 million. Founded in 2007, Currencycloud sells software for banks and fintech firms to process cross-border payments. It’s the second major acquisition of the year for Visa, which last month agreed to buy Swedish fintech Tink for $2.1 billion."
Visa to visa payment im hoping will crush some. Maybe visa buys venmo ..
Last opportunity to buy at a low price like this
"extremely extremely bullish on this bad boy. consumer spending isn't even at peak and covid is still a concern, especially the delta variant. once the economy comes towards the peak of recovery, spending will be multiplying rapidly and you will see a resurgence in rapid revenue growth for many of the credit companies like visa, Mastercard, and american express"
"ER next week, Visa needs to break $250 resistance.......... so the question if we have a solid ER and break resistance ""HOW HIGH DOES VISA GO?Thumb UP if we get above $285Thumb Down if we stay below $285"
"Earnings and profit growth growth, by definition; are the key drivers of stock prices, and not the Federal Reserve.- As long as MA & V continue to deliver strong revenues an profits growth as the U.S. and global economies open in the post Pandemic environment— these stock will remain in high demand, by a majority of enterprising investors!"
Forget $240 this week. Next week $242
Stock Price Target VHigh $309.00Median $281.00
Where Is Earnings?
The road to $300
"Options expiring, V might drop to around $242.50 or below $245 tomorrow."
"When PYPL and SQ go up, V and Ma go down.Happens all the time."
Reopening trade and crypto cards will push it to $300 by EOY. Probably split again at that point. $V ftw https://blockfi.com/credit-card-waitlist/?r=hvB4V
Gota love it 
"If you sell your Visa shares, Institutions will snap up your share in a flash. Why sell? Contactless payment, cashless society, travel coming back. It may not double within a year or two but long term you will be rewarded without the fear and headaches."
Bam! $250 today.
"A trader earns regardless of market fluctuations, I started investing using Brian Scott signals in June of last year, he shared his commercial techniques and helped me achieve my goals and now the profit rate is exponential. TeIegram> @Brianfxtrade"
Remember how low the expectations are for earnings. Last year everything was closed. No travel or entertainment last year. Visa will have huge earnings in two weeks. Strong buy!
Sold half my V stock today. Press has been brutal to V and MA due to missing the boat on BNPL trend with SQ and PYPl.
Visa should buy PaySafe (PSFE). Buy early. Great growth potential.
"low ah volume 400k, nothing to worry about"
How crazy! They had great earnings and ever since then it’s been a complete disaster. Disappointing
"On August 3rd, I bought Visa for 235.05. So no real hurry here, could go lower...Great company and business, just wanna be careful here for now."
"If not “green” buy the dip in V, if you are long the stock!— Any major pullback is an great opportunity!"
"V holding strong above $235....next week we will slowly keep the momentum and $260 is well in our reach. DO NOT sell your shares and drive V to new highs, all signs are positive!"
$252 I bought at $248 thinking what a deal
"adding more shares, nice dip"
buying lot more if that dip last tommorow
lol They do a lot of doctoring on this stock at the close
"Seeing some resistance at 285 lately, does anyone knows what's going on?"
It will be party time in the AH when V reports “barn burner” and blowout earnings!
$300 this year
Visa price target raised today to $281 by Oppenheimer!
"guys, why is it down in August? any idea?"
Bitcoin plus everyone going out again racking up debt.
"Last summer there was no travel, low spending, no attendance for sports, etc. Visa will have blowout earnings. Don’t miss out on the run to $300"
Bitcoin will be even higher and stay forever. V is rallying back even stronger! 
Is the stock splitting tomorrow?
Its just dark clouds on $V and $MA nowadays..will get through this very soon and we will have our smile back again Stay long
Picked up around 10k of this and Mastercard on this recent dip. Both great and safe long term holds
"VISA really fighting that $235 level, gets close but then fails, happened over and over. I think we sit here until next ER when its inevitable that the re-opening and spend will be reflected by great VISA numbers. Then we break $235 and finally see $240.........question is how long till we get to $265."
"Thank you, I just bought some!"
"V is outperforming MA this year! Literally, their P/E will be the same! V is surging back! "
The more the dow rises V and MA go down
"""McDonald’s, Others Weigh Closing Indoor Dining As Delta Variant Continues To Spread""Government doesn't want capitalism anymore. See ya MUCH lower."
V is going to roll out the special credit card program for bitcoin owners! V is always the most innovative visionary pioneer of the industry!
"Buy and hold, zoom out of the chart and relax"
"VISA holding on to its highs and keeps testing $241, need to breakout resistance here. Soon the summer spend season will sink in and V will soar to $265 on re-opening spree.As long as fears of Tax Increases and Inflation does not derail the market."
"This thing is worth way more.. Visa is the future... no body carrys' cash anymore.Delta variant is good for this stock more people wil go online meaning they wil use there CC to purchase things..And if delta variant is not a concern any more this is till good for this stock, as economy will be booming, peoples spending will increase..Moral of the Story - either or , Visa wins no matter what happens with COVID - Simple common sense!"
Downgraded this morning
EOY: 293-295 p/s... maybe higher.
That square deal was waaaay over payed for.. 140b market cap on combined 12b in revenue?
"The battle between ""re-open stocks"" vs ""shutdown Delta stocks"" is playing out. Seems the fear of Delta spread is winning the tug o war.Visa unfortunately sits right in the middle of all this craziness."
Profits have got to be affected being an ostrich does not make the fee go away
Intrinsic value of about 280 $ per share according to my calculations per us see of they Will beat my expectations
I picked up 360 shares today...we shall see in the next few days...
The shares are up￼ nearly 35% so of course we’re going to start seeing a little profit taking but that will only be short term￼
One year ago everything was closed and there was no travel at all. Focus on the year over year growth for Visa.
"Time for the SEC to get involved and look into the price manipulation of this company. I get it, The Delta variant is putting a damper on spending. Does that mean this stock should be sold off down to $50?"
Visa and Master card is the best buy. Only if they could raise the dividends at least 25%
"I must be going color blind, my eyes are seeing green today!"
"Travel was non-existent last year. No events, no attendance at sports games, everything closed. Visa is cheap at this level. Strong buy."
"If you’re looking for a short and sweet guide to the day’s biggest news, I recommend (http://Rightpicker.com). They breakdown the most important pre-market news and it only takes a few minutes to read."
"Thanks to VISA CEO’s vision on the blockchain currency expansion, V is the bigger beneficial of this infrastructure bill than MA. US gov loves the transparency of blockchain! Bitcoin stays forever and only grows huger from here! "
Just turned green
Maybe V should buy JMIA for their Jumiapay…
Held of very nice considering overall market looking for a dip and rip tomorrow
Watching companies beat estimates and seeing prices take a hit
Analysts price targets above $300 will come after earnings
"bargain price, adding more shares"
Just added 2000shares
Gap filled/ Big boys made whole. time to allow the rest of the world to make money........
The bar is set very low based on comps from last year. $300 stock
"V received a slew of price target raising from:Wells Fargo,UBS, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Piper Sandler, Raymond James,and CFRA"
Better off just buying S&P 500 ETF. V year to date performance is only 50% of S&P.
$300 stock. Very undervalued.
"v is basing, expect over $235 real soon"
"JPM today adjusted V price target upward to $267 from $249, reiterates Overweight."
"Guys, don’t listen to the “predictors” who has the magical prophecy of the market even for the next day.Payment regimes even the most obsolete ones would survive even lockdowns since online shopping has been insane all overt the world the past year."
"Ms Galia, hard a good rate for day trading"
"COVID SCIENCE-More contagious Delta variant makes people sicker; oral drug shows promise in treating COVID-19 pneumoniaMore nonsense....the government wants to destroy private enterprise. V goes lower, they HATE capitalism."
$300 on the way
so when do we reach a buy point on this?
They had some interesting insights about V on (http://Multistockalerts.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
$260 AH? COME ON VISA
not much AH action from visa. has been like this for years actually. expect nothing big but the trajectory is still headed up
if i sell now it'll go up. you're welcome
woohoo green on the close!
Next week $240-$245
Been with Visa for years and years since ipo...Each time after earning reports...Visa stock is red ...if you're a long term investors of Visa stock then you much know this....
V is still a bargain. Visa has a $279.99 yahoo price target! Good luck all!
Stop crying analysts got a $50 upside to Target.
EPS beat was 14-15 Cents beat! Rev was a beat as well
Sure glad I only bought 100 shares.
"New all-time over 250. Toot, toot!"
"More upgraded price targets for V, by B of A, and Morgan Stanley!- Buy this dip for huge gains when profit taking volume dissipates as early as tomorrow!"
below 50 moving average for Visa is always a buy opportunity.
Lost over $20 from its high. lordy
You guys might want to check out DFS (Discover) read that ER
"People all around the world are on vacation using Visa cards for flights, hotels, food, entertainment, etc."
Going to get that little gap today down to 245.45. One of the most certain things in short term trading-All gaps are filled because big money owns the gap. Needs to happen before it is allowed to go higher.
270+ before EOY.
JohnKelly = soon one of the dozens of shorts who got forced off this board.
buy the dip! once covid cases start to drop big money will be rotating back into V
Go Visa go! New 52 week highs coming.
It will recover. I'm sure. It always did. Plus dividends.
"Check out the candle or bar chart from the last 6 months. Same pattern - sharp rise then dramatic drop, rinse and repeat since February. Oversold, now it's time to rip again."
I was looking for the Pull back in AH but I think tomorrow we will go Green!
"It doesn't take a genius to own V. When it dips, buy. Rinse and repeat."
"love msft, aapl and visa, they have done incredibly well for me the last decade. I still add to them to this day."
The march to 270 continues...
This could easily march to 260 after earnings.
Anyone know why V and MA are classified as Financials rather than Tech stocks?
Sounds like stablecoins can kill Visa in the long term.
No looking good !
Hi I bought last month or so and I am down 7%. Should I hold or sell. Why all others are down too MA and AXP. Thank you.
"I'm in V 06/17/2022 270.00 C @ 7,00 see you in december."
The world is only going to get more paper cashless as time goes on.Mayority in the world still uses paper cash.With covid and convenience plus younger generations
This stock puzzles me. Bizarre price action.. covid forces more online transactions and faster adoption of non cash but limits travel - stock drops. Doesn't rally with reopening plays. Lagging SP500 heavily YTD. Seems like a no brainer reopening play and obviously a solid business long term
Visa will reach $250 this week. Millions of people traveled over the holiday weekend. Also online sales and contactless are at all time highs.
Good earnings and the stock drops 2.5 percent what a friggin joke this market is!
"Peaked, over valued!! Sell, not any better due to inflation"
"VISA is mega successful. Digital currencies give the company another boost! VISA has already opened up for coins, but they have not yet built up their own infrastructure. Maybe Syscoin would be a potential partner here.Especially the NFT market is growing rapidly, e.g. in art, sports, music. Other industries will follow. So VISA could get a big piece of the pie."
"V for Victory......Great stock, cash cow and great future growth!"
Plz stay in this price range until this week. Can’t wait to add more V with my bonus 
"Visa has the lowest PE between MA, PYPL and SQ (sq is in the 300's)"
"Visa is, as always, a solid investment for any portfolios. Don't trade it, Just buy and hold."
Is this gonna SPLIT?
"This downward trend is called, ""let's take money from the small investors."" Wall Street crooks at their finest!"
"VISA Chase Sapphire Card has its biggest offer ever 100,000 Point opening bonus! That's worth $1250 in Travel or groceries. Sign up before this offer is gone with this link! https://www.referyourchasecard.com/6b/B4YD2P4Q5T"
"Less than half the usual daily average volume with less than an hour to go. If volume remains low today, tomorrow we will break and hold $235."
285$ by December. Bullish for sure
Hilarious that internet trolls think they can affect the price of the 12th largest market cap in the world.
Why is this stock still so expensive? I like the company and it deserves a premium valuation but still. Costco is probably more expensive though but still... I'm a buyer at lower levels.
"India has banned Mastercard. That should help Visa. I think Mastercard can make an adjustment and get back on India's good side, but in the meantime Visa will be taking market share and I doubt people will change once they get established."
Well this RSI doesn’t stay this low forever not on a company such as Visa.
Hope it takes off in the second trading session today. next week will be interesting
PE needs to half. This is no longer a growth company
$250 this week
"@Ko ""looks like it will drop for Friday"" oh yeah it sure is dropping"
Visa and Apple are the simplest stock I own. Buy the dips and otherwise ignore them. They'll do their thing.
Hong Kong fees
Problem is Call options were and are being sold and Put options are being bought right after great earnings and guidance. This downturn will be temporary and V WILL go HIGHER!!!
