"So the major concern in the market is inflation, and we all know everything is getting expensive.So won’t it help visa if everything is more expensive as they all will stil be using cards to pay there bills but due to money devaluation Visa wil see higher revenue which would mean higher transaction cost? What am I missing here?"
Are you ready for the bounce up?
Visa will be back to $240+ easily by Jan !! It’s gift now !!!
"Visa is the network of the network, other Fintech are still using card scheme network and providing last mile of service. the more Fintech payment companies, the more Visa transactions"

"V @ USD 209 = Minus 20% since reaching USD 252/share in 2021.Based on V's Q4 report and V's forward looking outlook, I willhold V. My holding is still up 900% since I bought V 12 years ago.People can say what a poor annual return V has been for me,vs. Tesla, for example.But, I invest in the known (V), knowing that not having invested, then, in unknown Tesla may have penalised my returns.Ok !"
Christmas shopping and watch where MA & V excell as card activity accelerates and will be reflected in earnings.
"I am long, but this is not a perfect thesis. Yes, Visa is growing their processing revenues by just under 20% per annum since the covid outbreak. However, M2 money supply has grown by 40% since 2020. Visa is no longer capturing the lion's share of processing transactions; for the last 20 years, Visas transaction volume had always outpaced growth in M2. This year, that processing outperformance streak ended. Alternative direct networks are obviously removing some growth. There are some big fintechs that do not use the interchange networks at all and go point to point. 17 percent forecast revenue growth sounds good in isolation, but if inflation is running at 6% plus and money supply is growing at 12% this year alone, where is the organic growth from the network? Second, Visa keeps trying to buy some growth via a couple of bolt on fintech acquisitions every year for billions, yet that never seems to help revenues. It is no longer chump change, $5 to $10 billion in money losing acquisitions every year adds up. So, all that high EBITDA from the interchange doesn't get pushed down to equity owners. Third, the stock will be removed from the Fintech section of the S&P 500 and reclassified as a financial, which will force rotation by institutions next year. Visa seems to be operating from more of a position of defence, and companies not on the offensive in their sector typically don't outperform the sector. If Visa just stopped making stupid acquisitions and bought shares with that cash, we would likely be $100 per share higher than today."
"Experts bullish on V: ""We believe Visa's 6.9% share price decline, occurring after strong FY21 results and a positive FY22 outlook, was not justified by fundamentals. Volume has continued to recover in Q4 FY21, and high-margin Cross-Border Volume (ex-intra-Europe) accelerated to 86% of 2019 level. Q4 FY21 revenues reached 7% above 2019 levels and, with operational leverage and buybacks, EPS reached 10% above its 2019 level. Management comments on FY22 indicate a mid-teens EPS growth. Client incentives are rising, as they have done harmlessly in the past. With shares at $215.78, we expect a total return of 91% (18.2% annualized) by September 2025, in just over 4 years. We reiterate our Buy rating on Visa Inc."" (Seeking Alpha, ""Visa: Unjustified 7% Share Price Correction After Strong Q4 FY21 Results"")"
"I just invested 50% of my portofolio in Visa, MasterCard and Paypal wish me luck."
"I think this is the worst week since March, 2020. Looking at a 5 year weekly chart, however, V has almost always followed a very bad week (like this one) with a very strong bounce back week. It may be a good time to buy first thing Monday morning."
"The U.S. Justice Department is probing Visa Inc's relationships with large fintech companies as part of its antitrust investigation of the card giant, the Wall Street Journal reported. This is the main reason it’s tanking, not next years earning forecast necessarily. Settlement likely rebound very likely…."
Is this the Visa's biggest percentage drop in two days?
What a battleground right now! Who else is buying the dip?
Great buying opportunity for V at this level!
"To me, as to many investors, Visa is a buy and hold for long , not a trading stock."
Definitely long term golden stock. Strong buy.
"So Visa says cross border spending is recovering but slowly and we ""whack 7%"" off the stock and then MA comes out and crushes earning because cross border spending is improving. This is a CLASSIC example of analyst over reacting to headlines. Both V and MA are going to recover yesterday's losses in the next 2 weeks."
am I missing something here. with the world going cashless by 2024. wouldn't this stock be hot property....
"Good time to buy V if you ask me. Just look at its 1 year chart, 2 year chart, 5 year chart, 10 year chart, Life Time chart. Consistent stock price appreciation. Not parabolic. But steady. Which I like. It's product/service is used by all 7 billion people on earth. Except maybe Willie Nelson. The DOJ inquire will conclude that V has all its papers and Visa is order!"
