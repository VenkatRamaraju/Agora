"Sometimes being a Long - Investor can be a drag.. like a lot of V and seeing that the high prior to pandemic was ~$215 (18mths ago) and we are only up a bit over 9% since then.. Patience sure is a virtue, but once we get past the Delta variant and more ppl are vaccinated, $V will take-off with huge Rev/Profit increases"
Its just dark clouds on $V and $MA nowadays..will get through this very soon and we will have our smile back again Stay long
I guess I don’t see what’s keeping this down. Adding here as well
Picked up around 10k of this and Mastercard on this recent dip. Both great and safe long term holds
I will buy a positiin here
Hi I bought last month or so and I am down 7%. Should I hold or sell. Why all others are down too MA and AXP. Thank you.
Is this due to the AFRM and AMZN deal? V should be $260 at least by now.
below 50 moving average for Visa is always a buy opportunity.
BNPL trend will only boost VISA's sale as it will make people spend more without realizing they do. at the end of the day you will still have to pay with credit or debit.
"This goes to the new or recent shareholders of both $V and $MA. Just be patient, last year these two stocks were slow but steady for the months of Aug, Sept and Oct. Once you get passed those you'll be glad that you held. I've gone through this same scenario last year and held strong because I believe in both companies. Never selling these two stocks! Long term investment. I'm just hoping they split shares so I can accumulate more. GLTA"
The original buy now pay later.. 
"Buy and hold, zoom out of the chart and relax"
"VISA Scraping the Bottom of the Barrel: GIG WORKERShttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3H2As_nelY&ab_channel=VisaAfter watching this Visa add for ""payday"", it disgusted me to my core. All the ""coloured"" workers and one ""geriatric Gardner"" getting paid are ""gig-workers"". Their salary is measured in terms of pennies or pence.They are considered as the bottom of the barrel workforce, marginally higher than pan handlers on the roadside demanding to wash your SUV windshield with the stolen scrubber from the nearby gas station.These ""gig-workers"" income is first scalped 30% by the App Employer. The App Employer are also repulsed by their workforce, and do not classify them as ""employees"".This is the target sector VISA wants to attract? These mentally incompetent workforce that can't attain a normal job? Common VISA you are better than this. Target the upper middle class or wealthy workforce with disposable income. To heck with ""Gig-Workers"", the cancer of any economy."
Visa is getting into crypto. Enough said.If Visa was not getting into crypto at this stage in the game I might have sold all more holdings. and I have been holding since IPO I am a veteran V holder.

"JPM today adjusted V price target upward to $267 from $249, reiterates Overweight."
"guys, why is it down in August? any idea?"
