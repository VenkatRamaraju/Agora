I love This Platform https://stockhaul.today/3k3u98 ! This is the most amazing piece of software I have ever used. Totally customizable and incredibly powerful. There is very little I want that it doesn't already have.
I have been pounding the table looking for a good place to park this cash and I finally found a website that send out income producing plays once a week. If you are like me and are interested in strong dividend plays just go to https://trendingstockpickstoday.blogspot.com/ .
