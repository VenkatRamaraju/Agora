"Well, main event next week for Acasti will be the results of post-hoc analyses of TRILOGY 1. It will be impossible to hide the reason of unusually strong effect of placebo at 5 sites and if it was a mistake in trial design Acasti lawyers will have very hard time. They can blame investigators at sites but they should admit that Inclusion Criteria allowed these investigators to make very critical mistakes like to prescribe statins to statin-naive trial participants. It's like if it was a trial for AD drug and its trial design allowed to prescribe Aricept to all participants that were Aricept-naive. The results will be similar to T1: both treated arm and placebo arm will show significant improvement in ADAS-Cog and other AD tests. If FDA sees the reason of such unusually high placebo effect they will definitely allow to do post-hoc analysis because there are not so many effective drugs for AD. There are several FDA approved drugs for hypertriglyceridemia so FDA is not very excited about new one. Another trump card could be ""significant reduction of HbA1c at a 4 gram dose"" - no one hypertriglyceridemia drug can do it. So, you can sell, hold or buy Acasti shares now - nobody can predict pps after Monday presentation. Even if post-hoc showed perfect results (repeat Ph2 for CaPre) pessimists will say that FDA will not accept it. TRILOGY 2 results might be also perfect (even without exclusion of incorrectly treated patients) but pessimists will again say that T2 is not enough for CaPre approval i.e. additional study might be needed. So, just think logically and make correct decision."
The company has fature in my opinion but I don't like that they don't respect the share holders. But I believe in a long term the company will grow.
where is the stock police when you need them . this is highway robbery. but I guess the people buy now don't have much worries. 
Can someone help me understand what the market was looking for on this one? If the news had been negative the stock would have been at .30C. Instead it was positive and it slides to .73C. Assuming that word leaked late yesterday inspiring someone to buy 1 million shares likely at an average of somewhere near an .84C or someone short this stock rushed to cover? Shouldn't this have been north of $1 today? I'm just trying hard to understand why it went down? Please help
"Well, there is simplest explanation for this pps spike: too many people working in Acasti know the reason of high placebo effect. The information is just leaked out and friends, relatives etc started to buy ACST shares like crazy. They are 100% sure that FDA will accept Acasti investigation data as reasonable and allow to correct TRILOGY 1 and 2 statistics (remove all patients that were treated incorrectly with statins or got insulin treatment during trial start). CaPre has significant advantage in comparison with Vascepa - you can take CaPre without fat food and it will active for TG decreasing. Vascepa taken without fat food is just waste of money - it will not be absorbed. Fat food increase your TG and bad cholesterol. Conclusion: Acasti pps should be at least $2-3 even before FDA decision. After positive one (correction of TRILOGY 1 and 2 results) - $10"
"Before I start, note that my theory is based on the following:1) CV trials usually don't have a high placebo effect.2) Assuming we are using Vascepa as a benchmark, it is very hard to believe that the cornstarch in this placebo actually beats the Vascepa itself. If this is true, the whole omega 3 studies would be put into question, and it would turn out that Vascepa was a useless waste of time and money if simple cornstarch can do more magnificent things. This is illogical, hence not the case.3) Investors should note that all other Omega-3 trials used oil (potentially negative on TG) as a placebo while TRILOGY-1 used cornstarch (neutral on TG). The neutrality only plays in favour of CaPre.My theory is as follows:The Company reported a 36.7% median reduction in triglyceride levels among patients receiving CaPre at 26 weeks (end of the study), compared to a 28.0% median reduction in triglyceride levels among patients receiving placebo. 36.7% is a crucial number because the end of study showed a far greater reduction of GT, assuming, again, we are using Vascepa as a benchmark here. That's a win for CaPre. I did search some information today and was unable to find any evidence suggesting that any placebo like cornstarch or oil would show very similar results to actual clinical drugs or FDA comments. I saw the same opinions posted here below as well as on other boards I am a member of. Unless someone can show me otherwise, I would say that the placebo acting like this is, technically, impossible. I would say that nobody questions the TG reduction capabilities of CaPre - today was an absolute win for Acasti. If it was otherwise, I would have said that this is all over. But, again, this is not the case here. Further, the Company has noted that a high placebo response at 5 sites (out of a total of 54 enrolling sites) disproportionately contributed to the overall placebo response, and is being further investigated. Even if the majority of patients were at those 5 sites, if there were some issues with the drug, we would have seen a consistent date screw-up across all the 54 sites. Again, that did not happen.Based on this, at least right now and until the audit is complete, I am convinced that the issue was in either the placebo itself or administration of the trial (mixed dosages with different drugs, patients taking something else along with the placebo). It is a very careless mistake - for a second I actually thought they took the placebo with CaPre and then reported that against CaPre again (big LOL here). Either way, again, the issue is not the drug, it is the placebo. If this is the case, the data will be re-assessed and republished with a new input. We can also agree that the TG reduction is not the ultimate value of CaPre - it is the results of T2 that are of utmost value here. The timing of audit and the release of T2 is still somewhat favourable - if they can finally audit the data and find a negative root cause of the missed statistical significance and, assuming the T2 are beyond expectations, we still have a big winner here. Either way, February - March will hammer everything out.About FDA - there is a danger, in my opinion, that another PH3 will need to be conducted if FDA won’t go along with what we are having. A good case scenario would be if they uncover an error, reassess it and exclude those 5 sites from reporting. A bad case would be a short term dilution since they’d need more $ for an additional trial, which, in my opinion, shouldnt take long. Either way, an additional trial is still, somewhat, acceptable, but not desirable. The worst case scenario would be, I think, them taking the results of T1 as is, adding the T2 results to it (again, assuming T2 is a success) and then submitting it to the FDA for a NDA. In this case we will still have a good drug that works similar to the competition (slightly more or less) but has more benefits in terms of its secondary application. I wouldn’t call it “game over yet”. We still can see a 4$ share price. Who is with me?"
"I really like the way ACST managemement responded. No stock promotion. No hints of good or bad news and left everyone vuessing. Never done anything to promote ACST stocks in the past other than talked about CaPre data. They are a conservative bunch and for microcap investment, it ‘s a great sign. Stay away from management who always promote and tout their stocks and raise cash at every opportunity."
ya there plant blew up and people died but that was so long ago . we need to forget about the past focus on the future.
Bought 1000 shares today. That is my biggest investment in my life  wish me luck please 
What was the last split ratio? 1:8 or 1:10? Can’t remember. Anyone?
This company's Ceo should be in prison. This is company does not care for their stock holders or putting out anything that resembles a treatment for anything. This Ceo is smoke and mirrors.
"Just to sum up what has gone wrong here. I can hardly believe these are not all correlated.- December 23 delay: 'The delay was caused by gaps in the data when the dataset was transferred from the Central laboratory to the CRO data management group. When this problem was identified by the CRO data management group, it triggered an immediate hold on the data transfer to the CRO statistical group, and initiated a full quality review by the CRO of the processes and procedures involved at the central testing laboratory. This review was completed in early January 2020, and topline results for TRILOGY 1 were subsequently released on January 13, 2020. A more comprehensive audit of the central laboratory is currently ongoing. ""- Protocol violations: 'Despite monitoring activities conducted throughout the TRILOGY 1 trial to ensure adherence to the protocol and identify protocol violations, the Company has subsequently identified some unexpected and inconsistent findings that it believes may have negatively contributed to the overall topline results. These findings are now being further explored via a comprehensive and rigorous review of data and patient medical records by an independent team of auditors.'- Unusual response at 5 sites: 'The Company has noted that a high placebo response at 5 sites (out of a total of 54 enrolling sites) disproportionately contributed to the overall placebo response, and is being further investigated. A full audit of these sites, including review of all raw data and records from patients taking both CaPre and placebo, will be conducted to identify a possible root cause of the unprecedented placebo effect.'What is going on??? Gaps in data, protocol violations, unusual responses at specific sites. If someone were to try to sabotage them they couldn't have done better."
"It looks like that the majority of ACST investors didn't understand recent ACST news i.e. ""Submission of TRILOGY 1 Briefing Package to FDA"". Of course, Acasti management can't reveal all data now so they just said: ""the briefing package is now intended to provide the FDA with a review of the relevant TRILOGY 1 data and audit findings, with the objective to gain alignment on the interpretation of the TRILOGY 1 results and implications for TRILOGY 2.""It's more than enough for any smart investor: they just want to tell that they know exactly what was the reason of high drop of TG in placebo arm. As we discussed here before most likely it was incorrect protocol of statin treatment of patients that were statin-naive before included in placebo group. In simple words TG decreased in placebo arm only because of combination of starch pills and statin. Patients that got only starch pills or were on statins long time before trial start never show TG drop more than 8-10%. FDA staff is not stupid and will do correct decision i.e. allow to exclude from statistics all patients in placebo group that got such incorrect treatment. Conclusion: buy ACST right now, after FDA response pps will jump to $4-5 and higher."
Market cap of AMRN 8 to 9billion. ACST less than 200million. If results are positive this should at least be closer to a billion given the cardiovascular market. So positive news expect 100 to 300 percent increase in shares.
"I haven't read any recent filing yet, but based on my experiences with companies like this, I can see their losses are growing so I would expect a round of financing at some point in the near future once the stock price starts to rise some more...watch out!! Aside from that, if the volume can push to over 10mil in a day this chart can really move fast. This is a day trade stock until it can prove itself a sound long term investment."

"Have you noticed the carefully selected wording in the following statement from T1 PR?'Initial analyses suggest no protocol deviations in treatment allocation, capsule contents, laboratory quality control, or mismatched randomization that could explain these highly unusual placebo results.'They ruled out a lot of things, but not statins timing.

"One more time about statistics and probability theory. I just compared head-to-head TRILOGY 1 research sites with TRILOGY 2 ones. Each site has unique number so if some sites of T1/T2 are in same city they have different numbers. I found only 2 research sites that are absolutely identical for both TRILOGY 1 and 2 trials:1) Miami, Florida, United States, 331442) Savannah, Georgia, United States, 31406Maybe somebody has sharper eyes and catch 1 more similar site but it will not cardinally change statistics. Conclusion is simple here: all tests for TRILOGY 2 were done in absolutely different sites so the probability that both treated and placebo arms results for TRILOGY 1 and TRILOGY 2 will be similar close to zero. Anomalous spontaneous decreasing of TG in placebo arm that happened at 5 sites in T1 most likely will never happen in TRILOGY 2. Secondary and other measures should explain how some placebo patients got these phenomenal TG decreasing even before trial start and continue it during trial. BTW, this trial comparison site-by-site and conclusions are very obvious so many investors already did it and started buying cheap Acasti shares. When some publications said that TRILOGY 1 is failed because it was no big difference between treated and placebo arms they accidentally ""forgot"" to say that both treated and placebo arm showed very good decreasing of TG and treated arm decreasing was even better than Vascepa results. Thinks and invest wise."
"A bit off topic - you know any other interesting biotechs that worth considering? The one I’m currently looking at Cellectar Biosciences - they just announced extraordinary ph2 results, which the second waive of additional results scheduled for midjanuary - it is a cancer research company. I opened a tiny position just to investigate what is what. Any good companies you know as well?"
"Actually the Grace Therapeutics is a valuable part of the ACST company. Encouraging results (second and third phase studies) are expected in the fourth quarter! Bullish Q4! Go Back to $7.00! We can do it, we can make it! :)"
"The reason for unexpected placebo results at 5 sites: Patients with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes or uncontrolled latent autoimmune diabetes of adults typically also have severe hypertriglyceridemia. We start these patients on basal bolus insulin regimen right away and that also brings their triglyceride levels from almost close to 500-1000 down to normal or near normal range. Unless otherwise indicated, we don’t necessarily start these patients on TG lowering agents other than statins. That’s because we expect their TG to come down drastically with insulin. Insulin activates Lipoprotein lipase; the enzyme that breaks down triglycerides. Patients like these should not have been included in the clinical trial conducted by ACST. This was a unintentional mistake at these 5 sites. FDA will understand this scientific basis of unexpected results in the placebo group. Provided Trilogy 2 results are favorable, we should expect an NDA filing in the fall. Thank you."
I have plan to buy on every dip till the average of $1.50.Iam confident Stanley Morgan holding 179K. Future of company is bright may be shrare touch to $7-8 in 2022.
"NASDAQ has ACST institutional ownership at only 1%Smart money is avoiding the stock.....I wonder why ?Out of ACST and into MTNB ?MTNB has about 10-12 treatments, 6 top ten big pharma LNC partners, NIH and the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation funding 100% of MTNB's Rare Disease LNC Pipeline, and a cash runway till 2024Good luck"
"As a side note, MTNB IMO has a more favorable risk/reward profile than ACST.....Do your own DD....Best wishes to all."
Horrible job by board and management!
"Yesterday I asked IR to post p values and this is their response below: Response from David Waldman Crescendo IR“We are reporting median values – not averages or means. The FDA requires this, and all of the other companies have always reported median TG values for an apples to apples comparison. We need to have all of the raw data and create a histogram without the patients in these 5 sites to find the new mid-point or median. So we really can’t speculate what that new median number could be without doing the analysis. This is what we are focusing on now with the statistical experts, and it is going to take some time. Ultimately it will only be valid to remove these patients if supported by our audit evidence. We are working diligently and will put out further updates as soon as possible."
"Here's a summary of what I like about ACST: - 4 prior clinical trials showing significant reduction of triglycerides and HDL-C - Phase 2 trial also showed significant reduction of HbA1c - TRILOGY phase 3 trials should end by mid 2019, top line results by end of 2019 - Fully funded through Phase 3 trial and beyond - Krill oil a potential best in class omega-3 drug, it doesn't raise LDL-C like some fish oil-derived drugs - Multiple fund managers stating it's a potential billion $ company - Align Research has written about it multiple times, it's one of their top 5 positions, sees 10x plus potential - Valuable set of IP, recently awarded a new European patent - Post-phase 3 trial probable to expand CaPre's indications - REDUCE-IT trial results read well for Acasti, an ever increasing treatable patient population - George W Haywood recently upped his position to 7M shares and sold Neptune, he seems to know somethingAm I missing anything? Seems like it has a lot of potential if Phase 3 goes well."
I don't understand stand acasti has a cash flow of 57 m. why is the stock going down. they are a good company even without carpre . and also they saying they will meet the dallor . what wrong with people. hold your money .
"Interesting. In talking to the company the 5 sites that skewed the data represented 35-40% of the patient population. The data from the other centers was fine. Also after 4 weeks the placebo showed no additional benefit while Capre kept improving the triglyceride number and separated itself further from placebo as time went on. Bottom line Capre worked, now the company has to figure out why these 5 sites [representing a 35-40% of the patient population] had these results. The good thing is that in Trilogy 2 these sites will only represent 5-10% of the patient population. As Yogi Berra once said ""it ain't over till it's over]"
When will this starts to rocket! if we see it by numbers they should not be this low...
Too bad there is no options trading on this. Perfect setup for buying puts.
"The post hoc study will NO doubt reveal what happened to the placebo arm. A fellow investor stated that though statins, if prescribed by error to the placebo arm at start of study, can show TG reductions, it's impossible to increase plasma EPA levels and RBC (red blood cell) counts. Thus Acasti will be able to clearly show what happened. Now he f they can prove it clearly was only those 5 sites (36% of patients in T1) then they will hit statistical significance in T2 (12% of patients in T2). This stock is heavily held by retail investors until data is released. Thus the spike last week waiting for really nothing (FDA remarks) and subsequent down draft. Institutional investors have plenty of time and patience to scoop up scared retail investors and those running for the door with any good news. Science always wins."
"The wording with regards to statins can easily be misinterpreted and I believe the problem at the 5 sites lies there. Read carefully: 'Isolated hypertriglyceridemia, with triglycerides ≥500 mg/dL and <1500 mg/dL (≥5.7 mmol/L and <17.0 mmol/L) OR Mixed hyperlipidemia, with serum triglycerides ≥500 and <1500 mg/dL treated with a statin, CAI or PCSK9I inhibitor, alone or in combination, that has been stable for 6 weeks prior to randomization. If the subject is not being treated and not contraindicated, a statin and/or CAI treatment may be initiated at the discretion of the Investigator AT TIME OF SCREENING.'The way the trial was designed was to allow for statins to be initiated 8-9 weeks BEFORE randomization in order for them to reach full effect on lipid profile and stabilize lipid profile before randomization. However it may have been interpreted at some sites that the physician would decide at the time of screening if patient would be initiated on statins, but those physicians would have instructed patients to start statins treatment only at randomization (when trial starts), therefore increasing response in both placebo AND CaPre arm, which is what has been seen. Also supports the fact that most of the placebo effect was seen in the first 4 weeks, which would be normal if placebo patients had just started statins."

"In company own words ""The company made it clear that it does not intend to make any further disclosures” regarding the strategic review process unless and until a specific course of action is approved by the company’s board.Meanwhile, Acasti Pharma emphasized that along with its clinical advisors, it plans to “complete the full data analyses” as contemplated in the Statistical Analysis Plan for TRILOGY 2, including the secondary and exploratory endpoints, and “the pooling of the data from TRILOGY 1 and 2.”CaPre is a krill-oil derived prescription drug, aimed at treating hypertriglyceridemia, or high levels of triglycerides in the blood, which is known to contribute to heart disease."""

New CFO will help them with negotiations. What price they can get for CaPre and patents? At this situation best case scenario will be $2-3 per share. Smart people know that CaPre works even better than Vascepa but FDA will need some proof i.e. head-to-head Ph3 with SPA. Vascepa is generic now but CaPre is protected by patents for almost 20 years. In addition CaPre is natural product. My bet on Takeda - they like natural products from ocean source. China and Japan will be perfect market for CaPre."
"Post-hoc analysis clearly showed that CaPre is very effective for high TG treatment:""The subgroup of subjects with Revised Baseline TG levels above 750 mg/dL at Visit 4 (Week 0) represented 41% of the subjects retained in the post-hoc analyses. Within this group, the median TG reduction in the subjects receiving CaPre was larger as would be expected, reaching 36.3% and 43.0% at Week 12 and Week 26, respectively. In comparison, the median TG reduction for the placebo group was 11.8% at Week 12 and 14.4% at Week 26, resulting in non-adjusted differences of 24.5% and 28.6% respectively in favor of CaPre (p = 0.22 and 0.15, respectively). ""About this phenomenon as “Pre-Randomization TG Normalization"" - most likely that many patients that knew their TG results changed their diets and started eat healthy food (less carbs, less saturated fats, more fish etc.). They had TG around 500 mg/dL and such diet changes helped them to drop TG. Secondary measures should help to clarify this phenomenon. I will hold and buy more ACST. CaPre will be approved by FDA as effective TG drug."

"Amarin Vascepa got big hit (""Amarin Loses Appeal in Heart-Treatment Patent Case"") and generic versions of the supplement from Hikma Pharmaceuticals and Dr. Reddy's Laboratories earned Food and Drug Administration approval in May and August, respectively. Both companies are working to launch them before the end of the year.So, generic Vascepa vs. patented CaPre. Big Pharma only need to know secondary measures results for both TRILOGY 1 and 2. If CaPre increased blood EPA, decrease both LDL and HbA1c, decrease inflammation markers etc. Big Pharma can buy Acasti right now. They will need just one clinical trial: non inferiority head-to-head with Vascepa, without any TLC diet and physical exercise requirement. And no any fat food consumption before taking pills - just glass of water. Vascepa trial was specially designed to increase TG in placebo arm - no any diet + fat food requirement before taking pills i.e. 2 times per will definitely increase TG. So, everything now depends on secondary measurement results from T1/2. Acasti can't do any additional Ph3 but potential buyers (like Takeda or BI) can design and do very good trial for CaPre. They know that CaPre is effective TG decreasing drug but Ph3 trials were purely designed. CaPre can generate hundreds millions sales per year if win Ph3 against active comparator Vascepa."

"The following complete post sent this morning on another board - GLTA""Chen Subscribers ACST update (from another site - credit: JB3729)Subscriber UpdateThe following was sent out to subscribers at 9:36 ET. This may murky the waters a little more for some. However, it will all come down to the clinical data. What is Chen Buying? What is Chen Selling? Letter 2256 December 23, 2019 Update: Acasti Pharma Inc. (ACST) is going wild head of the important phase 3 top line data. I had discussion with management not long ago and I was promised the data would come out “before Christmas”. I thought we would have the data by now but it didn't happen so far. What happened what one week ago my friend George Haywood wrote a letter to his friends, including me, after AMRN got the approval, with his permission, I am posting it here. “ …............ The issue before the Harris/Haywood jury is simple: will Acasti's drug CaPre (CP) perform better on the metrics in its Trilogy trial than Vascepa (VC) did in its Marine trial on a similar population, TGs between 500 and 1500 or 2000. They are measuring many things, the most important of which are TG, HDL, LDL, and HbA1c. I believe that if CP beats VC on all or even most of these, Acasti stock will soar. For some context, ACST is at a market cap of 200 million now, AMRN will be at roughly 11 billion when the stock starts trading today.These two companies(AMRN and ACST) each have only one product, an N-3-containing drug derived from marine sources whose primary mechanism of action is thought to be TG lowering (but you and I both know the effects are pleiotropic). This 55-to-1 disparity between mkt caps should narrow dramatically if CP looks to be better than VC. Of course a disparity is justified because VC is approved for sale and CP has a long way to go on that front. Also, VC has done an outcome trial and CP has not. But the thinking is that FDA may start to look at N-3 drugs as a class, especially if the upcoming STRENGTH trial data from AstraZeneca is good, as I believe it will be. So maybe FDA would give a broad label to CP without an outcome trial, in which case it could be a blockbuster drug--with the expected effect on the company stock price.So that is why we need to try to figure out what effect to expect on lipid profile when you give a daily dose of around 750 mg EPA+ 500 mg DHA + 2500 mg phospholipids for 12 weeks to a bunch of folks whose TG level is around 680. Acasti has said it plans to release data only on TG at first, and maybe a month later on HDL and LDL and HbA1c, but they might change their mind and try to release more than just TG results at first. If CP beats VC on TG-lowering, investors will assume (probably correctly) that it will have superior results on LDL and HDL also, and we are off to the races.…...................” In his email, Haywood was also critical about the trial and the results to be published that didn't emphasis the trilogy enough. As we know, Haywood is the largest shareholder of ACST and he voice carries a lot of weight. After reading the email, ACST management decided to wait till the secondary end points, which they were planning to release around the end of the year, to release them at once. So the new release date is likely in a week or two. In the mean time we had huge run of ACST stock. I suspect the first data, triglyceride lowering, is likely positive as it should be in the hands of a few people in the past week. From the chart, ACST broke out last week and pointing to 4-5 dollar range. It it runs to 4 before the data, I may take some profits."""
$2.27/sh equals 28 cents pre reverse stock splitThe reverse stock split unfortunately DOESN'T..... change the fact that CaPre FAILED.....two Phase 3 trialsThere are significantly more attractive low-cap biopharma names elsewhere
The reverse split will be effective on 8/31; not all reverse split are bad and this one is no exception. this reverse split will be really good for all the holders.
"New 13G filed with the SEC today, Terren Peizer reporting a new 10.58% stake or 8,650,000 shares of Acasti. From Wikipedia, ""dubbed the 'Zelig of Wall Street', is an International Financier and Chairman of Los Angeles-based investment company, Acuitas Group Holdings."" Does anyone know anything else about him?"
The additional capital raised has strengthened Acasti’s balance sheet and will provide the Company with additional flexibility in its ongoing review process to explore and evaluate strategic alternatives.”
"When the split occurs, the price of the stock is adjusted to reflect the new number of shares outstanding. In the case of a reverse split, the price will increase, as now fewer shares are outstanding. When a forward split occurs, the share price will decrease because more shares are outstanding. While the stock price and number of shares you own change, the price is always altered by the split ratio, which means that the value of your holdings is not materially affected. You either own more shares at lower price or fewer shares at a higher price; the market capitalization -- the number of shares outstanding multiplied by the share price -- does not change."
"Purchase as much you can afford, big gains are in the works."
Happy to see this move. Hope we can pull AMRN up with us. I own both.Question for those with more experience. Can we exceed the prior 2.95 high on good news?
First post. Longtime lurker. Long and bullish. Optimistic about the results. Lot of conspiracy theory about the delay but I bet it’s pretty simple. Lab and scientists didn’t get it all together in time to hit their target. If results are good there is still a long way to go before approval. Many paths to take. Lower than avg volume today. People just holding and waiting. I will buy the big dips still. Of course it’s speculation still but every portfolio needs some risk in it...
They blocked me from reddit. something is going on. 
The reverse stock split doesn't change the fact that CaPre failed two Phase 3 trials....The sell off is not a mystery but an expectation.
"In two Phase 2 studies, CaPre achieved a statistically significant reduction of triglycerides and non-HDL cholesterol levels in patients across the dyslipidemia spectrum from patients with mild to moderate hypertriglyceridemia (patients with TG blood levels between 200mg/dl and 500mg/dl) to patients with severe hypertrigyceridemia (those with TG levels above 500mg/dl). Furthermore, in the Phase 2 studies, CaPre demonstrated the potential to actually reduce LDL, or ""bad cholesterol"", as well as the potential to increase HDL, or ""good cholesterol"", especially at the therapeutic dose of 4 grams/day. The Phase 2 data also showed a significant reduction of HbA1c at a 4 gram dose, suggesting that due to its unique omega-3/phospholipid composition, CaPre may actually improve long-term glucose metabolism."
"It looks like that many Acasti investors are pessimistic about recent update. But this update is more than positive: 1) FDA supported the conduct of post-hoc analyses in TRILOGY 1 for exploratory purposes. Acasti statisticians will conduct further post-hoc analysis based on FDA’s comments and feedback on the TRILOGY 1 data. Explanation: Acasti investigation showed that some patients in placebo group were treated incorrectly and should be excluded from analysis. FDA agreed with the investigation data and want to see the results when such patients are excluded.2) FDA confirmed that it will require pivotal efficacy analyses for TRILOGY 2 to be performed on the full Intent to Treat (ITT) population as contemplated in the original Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).Since Acasti knows the reason of high placebo effect such patients might be separated in special group. Statistics might be performed with and without separation to show that incorrect treatment (for example prescription of statin to statin-naive patients in placebo group) leads to TG decreasing. Exclusion of such patients should show clear CaPre effect. Anyway, very soon they should say what was wrong in placebo group. 2)"
Am I the only one who remembers Amarin in September 2017 before REDUCE-IT results? All Yahoo finance experts predicted failure. My unit cost was $ 2.90 and to be honest I had placed a sell order for $ 3.25 which never materialized. I sold a few days later for $ 14. GLTA
Technical analysis and fundamentals state that it is a good buy and hopefully will jump to 5 USD very soon
"ClemmieBullish7/4/21, 09:55 AM$ACST it's a sad reflection that 91% of M&A deals >100m have bottom feeding lawyers sniffing around with investigations. They see it as an easy revenue stream and a way to bolster their client book.When you look into the investigations (not claims) they really are scrapping the barrel. Not only did the ACST deal switch from a reverse merger to an acquisition, it also turned in favour of ACST shareholders, to the extent filings note significant value to shareholders. Acasti have always been known for strong corporate governance. Having hired Oppenheimer and a new law firm to independently evaluate the 110+strategic options, fairness and value is literally littered throughout their filings. This is the 21st century equivalent of grave robbing. Luckily there's too many savvy investors to consider this even worth thinking about although it does get my blood boiling. A lot of good people invested time and effort to shape this for success. Then come the ambulance chasers"
how many feel this will go past 12 bucks?

"just one and half month before final verdict to Acasti TG drug CaPre. What are possible scenarios for TRILOGY 2 trial? First one is a pessimistic - in T2 CaPre treated group will show very good decreasing of TG but placebo arm will also have high TG decreasing. Second scenario is optimistic - CaPre will show very good results (-30-40% TG decreasing) and placebo arm will show just minor TG decreasing (-5-10%). Secondary and other measures will be also very promising i.e. around 1% decreasing of HbA1c (from average 8.5-9% to 7.5-8%) etc. Facts: 1) Anomalous TG decreasing happened at 5 sites in T1 and only 2 sites from them (from 68) were research sites in T2; 2) Acasti explained high placebo effect by spontaneous TG decreasing that happened even before trial start (might be a results of doctor suggestions to change diet i.e. eat more fish, vegetables etc for patients with high TG). If TRILOGY 2 is successful FDA most likely will approve CaPre without additional trials. The reason is simple - CaPre results in T1 were very good. Placebo arm patients stratification strategy was not well designed and leaded to anomalously high placebo effect. What is the probability of TRILOGY 2 success? My prediction is >90%. Placebo anomaly was very rare event so the probability of repeat of such event is close to zero."
Every stock but a few are up today. Move on people. Buy steel or oil stocks.
bye bye money
Let’s see….a 1 for 8 stock split puts this around $2.51/8 = $.3175. Not good.
"Great news in the morning, let's go to the moon....."
"Don't worry about fund's scepticism about Acasti - they just removed stocks with declining pps from portfolio to show good numbers. One thing is important here - Acasti management knows exactly why placebo arm showed such phenomenal results (TG drop was similar as patients were dosed with Vascepa) and sent all data to FDA. It's very rare situation when both treated arm and placebo one showed very good results. Usually treated arm results are just slightly higher than standard medicine (non-inferior) but placebo also show some positive trend. So, statistics analysis can't show big difference. In TRILOGY 1 trial starch pills showed results similar to Vascepa i.e. impossible in real life. It's 100% that some placebo patients got active compound(s) that can significantly decrease TG (statins or increased insulin dosage for diabetics). Acasti management understands that if such mistakes revealed many holders with losses will try to sue the company for their losses. But also they know that CaPre approval by FDA will increase ACST pps 300-400% in one day. Pps will become higher than before drop and longs who didn't sell will be happy. What the probability that FDA will allow to correct TRILOGY 1 and 2 results? If statins were reason for TG drop the probability of correction >90% (without additional Ph3). If the reason was increasing insulin dosage for diabetes patients during trial it's 100% that FDA will allow to remove them from analysis (see Exclusion criteria for Ph3). Less than 20 days and we will know the reason. HOLD and add more."
"If you are one of the large Pharmaceutical companies that wants a piece of the action for the EPA MACE reduction drugs and Amarin's price tag is too rich, why not pick up a comparable drug from a much smaller company? Acasti will have suitors calling on them after today, if not previously. I'm expecting a BO of this company between 2-4 Billion within the next six months — Target SP $30. The US market alone is valued at 14 billion annually for broad expanded label. throw in BP's roots around the world and they could be looking at a $40 billion annual market with their chief competitor selling at a fraction of their sales/marketing presences."
"Did anybody approximate risk/reward for ACST entry price $0.8? In case if TRILOGY 2 failed ACST pps can drop 50% i.e. to $0.35 . However, if TRILOGY 2 is successful and Acasti found the reason for placebo anomaly in TRILOGY 1 current pps should jump at least 200-300% to $2.50-3 range (it's very modest value for Vascepa analogue). Thus, risk/reward is -50%/+300%. It's very rare situation in biotech investment. Especially if investors already know that CaPre is very effective for decreasing of TG. Well, statins are also effective but when you read side effects you will switch to Vascepa or CaPre. We have 10 days before D day for Acasti. Funds/institutions know that there is only one way to collect shares form weak hands - decrease pps each day at least 3-5%. Market makers that collected cheap shares during panic sell off help them to create ""never catch falling knife"" story for Acasti. JUST THINK"
"Be logical folks - Full detailed FDA response was received and known yesterday afternoon, when millions of shares were then suddenly purchased. Think they read it as negative news?"
ACST announced reverse split this weekend. Notice came in Saturday. No mention of what multiple will be used.
"when is the reverse stock split, or did it already occur. thanks, jimmy"
"One more remark about Other Outcome Measures:7. Percent change from baseline (Week 0) to Week 12 and to Week 26 in apo B, apo A1, apo B/apo A1 ratio, apo CIII and apo A5. [ Time Frame: Week 12; Week 26 ]Statin treatment significantly increase apo A1 level in blood (7-9%) and strongly decrease apo B level (-30-35%), so final apo B/apo A1 ratio decreased -30-35% from start point. Simultaneously statins decrease TG by 30-35%.My point is that Acasti Other Outcome Measures of apo A1 and apo B can easy show what kind of active compound (iCaPre or statin) induced TG decreasing in blood. In case of CaPre it will be EPA (+500% in blood and TG drop 30-35%) and statins will strongly decrease apo B/apo A1 ratio (-30-35%).That all that we need to know. https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1185/03007995.2013.766590?journalCode=icmo20"

"My best guess is some participants ""hedged"" their health with fish oil supplements. These patients are ill and health over statistically significant data. HDL increases may be supra-significant.

"News! Won't let me put a link.LAVAL, Quebec, April 30, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Acasti Pharma Inc. (“Acasti” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: ACST – TSX-V: ACST), a biopharmaceutical innovator focused on the research, development and commercialization of its prescription drug candidate CaPre (omega-3 phospholipid) for the treatment of severe hypertriglyceridemia, today announced that it submitted its briefing package on April 29, 2020 to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for review. The Company is currently awaiting comments, and expects a formal response from the FDA on or before June 30, 2020.As previously reported, Acasti filed its meeting request at the end of March, and this briefing package is now intended to provide the FDA with a review of the relevant TRILOGY 1 data and audit findings, with the objective to gain alignment on the interpretation of the TRILOGY 1 results and implications for TRILOGY 2. The Company will also seek the FDA’s input on Acasti’s proposed revisions to the pre-specified TRILOGY 2 statistical analysis plan (SAP), and explore and hopefully reach agreement on a plan for pooling the data from TRILOGY 1 and TRILOGY 2 to support an NDA filing. Acasti continues to remain blinded to the TRILOGY 2 results, and intends to update the statistical analysis plan (SAP) with these revisions if the FDA agrees.Jan D’Alvise, President and CEO of Acasti Pharma, commented, “We have submitted our briefing package to the FDA for their review, and are now awaiting their formal response. We remain optimistic that we may still have a viable path toward filing an NDA. We look forward to the FDA’s feedback on our briefing package, and expect that they will provide valuable guidance on the next steps to be taken towards the unblinding of TRILOGY 2. We will provide more information about our TRILOGY 1 findings, and the FDA’s response to our briefing package and our questions after we get it.”Acasti also announced today that it has received notice of issuance of a composition of matter patent to be awarded by the Intellectual Property Office in Hong Kong. This new patent grants claims for any composition containing EPA and DHA, where at least 50% of the composition consists of phospholipids.About CaPre (omega-3 phospholipid)Acasti’s prescription drug candidate, CaPre, is a highly purified omega-3 phospholipid concentrate derived from krill oil, and is being developed to treat severe hypertriglyceridemia, a metabolic condition that contributes to increased risk of cardiovascular disease and pancreatitis. Its omega-3s, principally EPA and DHA, are either “free” or bound to phospholipids, which allows for better absorption into the body. Acasti believes that EPA and DHA are more efficiently transported by phospholipids sourced from krill oil than the EPA and DHA contained in fish oil that are transported either by triglycerides (as in dietary supplements) or as ethyl esters in other prescription omega-3 drugs, which must then undergo additional digestion before they are ready for transport in the bloodstream. Clinically, the phospholipids may not only improve the absorption, distribution, and metabolism of omega-3s, but they may also decrease the synthesis of LDL cholesterol in the liver, impede or block cholesterol absorption, and stimulate lipid secretion from bile. In two Phase 2 studies, CaPre achieved a statistically significant reduction of triglycerides and non-HDL cholesterol levels in patients across the dyslipidemia spectrum from patients with mild to moderate hypertriglyceridemia (patients with TG blood levels between 200mg/dl and 500mg/dl) to patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia (those with TG levels above 500mg/dl). Furthermore, in the Phase 2 studies, CaPre demonstrated the potential to actually reduce LDL, or “bad cholesterol”, as well as the potential to increase HDL, or “good cholesterol”, especially at the therapeutic dose of 4 grams/day. The Phase 2 data also showed a significant reduction of HbA1c at a 4 gram dose, suggesting that due to its unique omega-3/phospholipid composition, CaPre may actually improve long-term glucose metabolism. Acasti’s TRILOGY Phase 3 program is currently underway.About Acasti PharmaAcasti is a biopharmaceutical innovator advancing a potentially best-in-class cardiovascular drug, CaPre (omega-3 phospholipid), for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia, a chronic condition affecting an estimated one third of the U.S. population. Since its founding in 2008, Acasti has focused on addressing a critical market need for an effective, safe and well-absorbing omega-3 therapeutic that can make a positive impact on the major blood lipids associated with cardiovascular disease risk. The Company is developing CaPre in a Phase 3 clinical program in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia, a market that includes 3 to 4 million patients in the U.S. The addressable market may expand significantly if omega-3s demonstrate long-term cardiovascular benef"

well looks like we going up today. lets see the run.
"I think this is definitely a moment where it will ultimately pay not to panic with all the sellers and average down. I mean good grief who sells at a loss in pre market when the price is so easily manipulated. The data points clearly to 1: the medicine works and 2: there was some sort of error in the testing. A real placebo effect will not be concentrated in 1/10th of the testing sites, it will be relatively constant across the board. But for those 5 sites the results would have been outstanding, surpassing results of nearly all its competitors. It will get sorted out. The smart money is on sobriety, patients and buying this dip."
they are really draining the market. sometime managent tries to make a company fail. this will go big or just shut down .
"So we are looking at an 8-1 split.So if u bought 1,600 shares of ACST at $1.00, you will now own 200 shares of the new company and the cost to you is $8.00 per share. So the stick has to reach $8.00 to break even. Could be a long long wait, unless they come up with some miracle cure for something!"
"Just summary for Philippe hypothesis what happened in TRILOGY 1 trial. I'm sure that all ACST investors ask just one question: why CaPre Ph2 showed very good results but Ph3 CaPre TG results were smashed by high placebo effect? Let's see what inclusion criteria in both Ph2: TRIal For Efficacy of Capre on hyperTriglyceridemiA (TRIFECTA)Inclusion Criteria:• Patients who are currently not on pharmacotherapy for hyperlipidemia and according to the judgement of the physician and Canadian Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Dyslipidemia initiation of drug therapy is not indicated for the duration of the study.• Patients currently treated with statins and according to the judgement of the physician and the Canadian Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Dyslipidemia a change in their current drug regimen is not indicated for the duration of the study.• PATIENTS TREATED WITH STATIN MUST BE ON STABLE DOSE FOR AT LEAST 6 WEEKS PRIOR TO SCREENING.Assess the Safety and Efficacy of NKPL66 (CaPre) in the Treatment of Mild-to-high HypertriglyceridemiaInclusion Criteria:• Patients who are currently not on pharmacotherapy for hyperlipidemia and according to the judgement of the physician and Canadian Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Dyslipidemia initiation of drug therapy is not indicated for the duration of the study.OR• Patients currently treated with statins and according to the judgement of the physician and the Canadian Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Dyslipidemia a change in their current drug regimen is not indicated for the duration of the study.• PATIENTS TREATED WITH STATIN MUST BE ON STABLE DOSE FOR AT LEAST 6 WEEKS PRIOR TO SCREENING;See capitalised text: patients that have statin medication are accepted in trial but they should start statin treatment at least 6 WEEKS PRIOR TO SCREENING. In simple words statins already decreased TG to some lower level in these patients (approximately 25-28% according published clinical trials). Now open inclusion criteria of TRILOGY 1:A Phase 3 STudy of CaPRe In LOwering Very hiGh TriglYcerides (TRILOGY 1) (TRILOGY 1)Inclusion Criteria:1. Subjects ≥18 years of age.2. Isolated hypertriglyceridemia, with triglycerides ≥500 mg/dL and <1500 mg/dL (≥5.7 mmol/L and <17.0 mmol/L) OR Mixed hyperlipidemia, with serum triglycerides ≥500 and <1500 mg/dL treated with a statin, CAI or PCSK9I inhibitor, alone or in combination, that has been stable for 6 weeks prior to randomization. IF THE SUBJECT IS NOT BEING TREATED AND NOT CONTRAINDICATED, A STATIN AND/OR CAI TREATMENT MAY BE INITIATED AT THE DISCRETION OF THE INVESTIGATOR AT TIME OF SCREENING.See the difference? They allowed to start statin treatment AT THE DISCRETION OF THE INVESTIGATOR AT TIME OF SCREENING. In simple words some patients that never had statin treatment got statins together with placebo. And these PATIENTS TREATED WITH STATIN NEVER WERE ON STABLE DOSE FOR AT LEAST 6 WEEKS PRIOR TO SCREENING. As a result all these patients that never had statin medication and started to get ""statin + starch"" showed very strong decreasing of TG at week 12. And the reason was simple: statins are very effective for decreasing of TG. It's ACTIVE COMPOUND for TG treatment. Conclusions: most likely Acasti will admit that placebo effect was induced by incorrect dosage of placebo patients with active compound statin. All these patients will be eliminated from statistics or separated to group that was treated with ACTIVE COMPARATOR. Many Acasti investors have terrible losses because of this stupid mistake in trial design. They can easy compensate it if buy ACST right now."
One year target price needs to be updated.
thats what everyone wants.lol
"If this company go over $1 dollar with 10 consecutive days, and I think it won’t REVERSE SPLIT. ACST Pharma INC need to write a letter to NASDAQ and ask them to extend with 180 days is because the COVID-19. I think NASDAQ will accept is because COVID-19."

Upon initial announcement of positive AMRN results of ANCOR study back in 2010, their shares rallied from $3 to $9 over few months and then to $16 upon submission of their NDA for VHTG. you may expect a similar trend if P3 result for Trilogy 1 & 2 are successful later this year. Best of luck"
"Recent Q1, 2020 13F filings should be very interesting for Acasti investors. My prediction that Institutional Ownership should jump from 05.88% in Q4, 2019 to 10-15% in Q1, 2020. Shorts know that funds are accumulating ACST and covering during last 4 months: from 2,277,902 in 1/15/2020 to 322,116 in 4/15/2020. Increased Positions 24 1,982,656Decreased Positions 11 267,266Also good sign. Acasti management did very bad thing to retail investors: the results of TRILOGY 1 scared the majority of them and forced to sale shares with huge losses. They did it because of the articles that said:""TRILOGY 1 results didn’t reach statistical significance against placebo. But CaPre actually worked. The issue was that the placebo worked nearly as well. Median triglyceride levels dropped 30.5% for patients receiving CaPre — and 27.5% in the placebo group. That latter performance doesn’t seem to make much sense. The placebo is just cornstarch, which should have zero effect. (That’s, of course, why cornstarch was chosen as a placebo in the first place.) In similar trials, the effect usually was in a range between -10% and +10%.""The first statement ""results didn’t reach statistical significance against placebo"" is false one. Specially designed to scare investors. They should said that both treated with CaPre arm and placebo arm showed very high TG level drop. Such drop of TG in placebo group can't be explained if patients got only starch pills but not additional treatment with other active compound that can alone significantly decrease TG level i.e. statins. Authors of such articles did good job for funds/institutions: they helped them to buy very cheap Acasti shares. After CaPre approval by FDA funds will have huge gain."
Just lost so much money on the #$%$
"Let's put some serious guard rails on price appreciation IF Acasti is highly successful in the T2 readout and gains alignment to pool T1 data for a possible NDA filing. Using rounded figured Amarin has a current market cap of $3 billion. Acasti is $70 million. At one quarter of the market cap of Amarin, Acasti could reasonably be worth $750 million or $7.50 dollars a share."
"I trust the Acasti team is working hard to figure this out as they have a lot at stake - their jobs, their families, their stock options, their career, their reputation, their future, the company itself...it's all on the line at the moment. The emotions and reactions of retail investors is certainly shared and magnified at their layer. The drug works - this was demonstrated in previous trials and even in Trilogy 1. If you think this placebo issue is game over, turn out the lights and shut the door, the stock goes to zero...I think you're in for a surprise. Yes, it may result in an additional P3 trial and more stock dilution and more time but no one would just folds and quits at this point. No. This will always be a big bump in the road and a point where many investors rightfully capitulated, but the road doesn't end here."
"Jan D’Alvise, president and CEO of Acasti Pharma, commented, “We have completed the clinical site and central lab audits of the TRILOGY 1 data, including additional post-hoc analyses. As a result, I am pleased to report that we now expect to submit our FDA meeting request by the end of March. We look forward to reporting further developments, including an update on a meeting date as soon as it has been set.”"
"They have around $20M in cash: NO CASH problem in the short term !Here is the situation: TG were reduced by 30.5% (12 weeks) and 36.7% (26 weeks) with NO AE (adverse events). Those results are a SLAM DUNK. FDA won't ignore a drug that reduce TG by over 36% in 26 weeks. Those results are 100% in line with the COLT Study which were with 2gr/4gr (8 weeks) 21.6%/23.3%. FDA will review all the data in this context. This drug WORKS. PLACEBO PROBLEM: The placebo number is Capre/placebo 2.5/1 which represent 70 patients on placebo vs around 172 patients on Capre. The problem is specific to 5 sites which represent around 36% or 25 patients on placebo. THIS IS NOT a significant number. As per COLT study, the placebo (N=29) was +2.5% after 4 weeks vs Trilogy 1 at -27.5% which doesn't make any sens. If the remaining balance is around -5% this means that de 25 patients are aver - 50% TG reduction for 4 weeks. In any study the FDA will accept a placebo with this kind of results. ROOT CAUSE : We can speculate on various explanations (raw material contamination, manipulation error, falsification, other lipid medication, etc etc), the only thing we are sure is that its not the act of GOD and its would founded to be true, this mean that cornstarch is a better drug than Amarin. NEXT STEPS : Let's be positive, management will find the explanation and T2 will give us the same great numbers, secondary end points will be meet and in March and glucose reduction will be confirmed. WORST CASE : what is the worst case, they don't find any explanation!? FDA agree that it does make any sense and they Acasti is required to do a 4 weeks trial 1:1 placebo:Capree with around 50 patients. Acasti T1 & T2 only required to hit -11% placebo reduction to have the 20% TG reduction. Lets be honest, the FDA won't throw to the basket the entire study. End of story. GLTA"
"Took this off of Stocktwits by Gene Katz @ SA earlier this afternoon: ""After more research, my expectation is that CaPre will get approximately 40% Trig reduction (adjusted), which will be comparable to 33% for Vascepa (adjusted). On an unadjusted basis, Vascepa is approximately 20% (per Marine study). I am expecting for CaPre to be superior on an unadjusted basis as well. The FDA will get both adjusted and unadjusted data, but will likely allow the marketing of the adjusted 40% number, as it will be apples-to-apples with Vascepa's 33%. The adjusted numbers will be considered versus the 20% marker for TRILOGY, which means CaPre will certainly succeed in the Phase 3 trial. Consequently, CaPre's story will be 'better trig reduction plus', considering the other clear advantages to bioavailability, cholesterol and diabetic sugars. After confirming with management, Phase 3 should be out Dec 20-23 (""just before Christmas""). -CONTINUED.. take it for what it is worth"
I predict Acasti will be trading above $4.00 in September.Hold on to your shares.
"clearly; they are holding the stock price down...when they allow' it_ it will possibly rise and test,likely; lower medial price range resistance point...we are hoping for excessive/above avg, volumn driven gap up' then a trade up to higher range avg resistance point...estimated; first week of september for drastic move...[avg, larger spread movement} up ....unless they want share price at total' low in lieu of possible rss_which; is very possible.."
Game is being played here to flush out shares from tired investors. About time to buy!!!
Monday 
Greenday!!!
"It was definitely a good day to own both Acasti and Amarin. Days like this don't come around too often for many investors and if you only put your money in ETFs and mutual funds you may never experience a day like this. Congrats to everyone who made money today, realized or not. I have a feeling there's more to come this week. Cheers!"
this stock beta changed again. its going for.12 bucks .lol sell so i can buy more low .lol
"First time during my more than 10 years investment experience in biotech sector I see such low pps for company that is going to release Ph3 data for potential blockbuster drug during next 4-5 days. I can understand it if CaPre completely failed TRILOGY 1 but it's not true - TG decreasing effect was very strong. Unexpected spontaneous TG decreasing in placebo arm was well investigated and most likely was induced too vigorous TLC diet. -35% decreasing of TG in CaPre arm was not an aberration or some kind of miracle. Very good effect on target in both treated and placebo arm is very rare event in clinical trials, maybe it's even unique event for TRILOGY 1. It's very unlikely that such unique event will be repeated in TRILOGY 2. Secondary measures of both T1 and T2 will explain all strange things that happened for CaPre. Once again, each investor should analyse target company ""under microscope"" and decide to invest or not invest. Acasti is high risk/very high reward company - buy 1000 shares now and you can lose just $300-400 or win $3000-4000 ($5 pps is reasonable for ACST if CaPre showed results better than Vascepa)."
"The only drawback to this crazy run is that management might be tempted to do another stock issuance rather than explore other avenues — partnerships or taking on debt. If we get to $3 in August, I think we risk some dilution. My other thought is that now that Amarin appears to be GIA, perhaps BP interest has surged and a BO is a real possibility. Any idea what kind of purchase price they could get prior to announcing TRILOGY results?"
Reasons I initially invested in Acst was this study. To be clear I’ve only been in ACST about a year but found this good supporting evidence that the science works. Maybe mgmt pulls a mulligan or maybe not. Good luck all longs. Shorts there is nothing to see here (low downside left) best to move on :) Page 423-424. Even placebo knocked it down 10%... http://archive.foundationalmedicinereview.com/publications/9/4/420.pdfhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/15656713/

"http://www.bioworld.com/Ready-made outcome data?Oppenheimer analyst Leland Gershell said Capre ""appears to offer broader efficacy. All of the omega-3 [therapies] reduce TG, but clinical evidence that Capre can raise high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, potentially lower low-density cholesterol, and improve diabetes markers are favorable distinctions"" due to its sourcing from crustacean krills rather than fish, he wrote in a report last week. The drug may be more patient-friendly than other omega-3s, too, as the latter come packaged in oil-filled softgel capsules that may need to be taken with fatty foods, just the kind that the targeted patients are advised to avoid. Capre, on the other hand, is delivered in a smaller, hard gel capsule and can be absorbed without tailoring food intake. A major plus is that Acasti may not need CV outcomes data in order to win a broad label, thanks to the Reduce-It study results and those yet to come from London-based Astrazeneca plc's Strength trial with TG therapy Epanova (omega-3-carboxylic acids), due to report in the second half of next year. content/acasti-sits-pretty-raise-brings-400m-amarin"
This #$%$ is going nowhere. Another two months they will be fighting delisting.This stock is worse covid.
i think its a game . this company jump from 2 to 4.5 in 2 days .what do you think of course they can go lower. and yes i also sold half of my stock before the spilt. i have been buying my lows. lol i wont let them win. they promised 2 dallors before the split . so that would be around 12 bucks. im waiting it out.
"anyone else with Questrade, mine is still not updated, sitting in limbo"
Delay changes nothing for the results now for January. I agree it created a buying opportunity basically. Should see $3 and above and then fully expect trials to boost this even higher come the results.
"65% in the red with this stock..well, I guess just hold until who knows when :("
Stay away from this #$%$
"Me coaching Jan for the conf call tomorrow : 1) Shareholders we are sorry for you losses (…) 2) we have find the placebo 5 sites problem and we are currently finalizing the documentation for the FDA (…) 3) the timeframe provided is the worst case scenario and we expect to give you an update as soon as possible 4) We are fully funded till end of 2020 and we have reduced our wage by 20% since Jan 13th, there will be no bonus or stock options this year. 5) Thank you very much for your patient, understanding and we are fully commited to deliver value to our shareholders."
does anyone have any idea how this will be after the news ?.
Qtr call updates 1) Patient drop out rate between 9% - 10% (lower than avg.)2) Participants from Trilogy trail (PH3 ) breakouts: 30% are on statins 35% - 40% are diabetic (patients above 6.5% Hemoglobin A1c levels)3) $8.1m in warrants received which takes them to June 2020 and no plans to raise before results in Dec/Jan4) Continuing talks with pharma companies as potential partners. ACST mgmt believes waiting until they have data 3 results puts them into the best position for negotiations. 5) Secondary endpoints - what would be key to show efficacy improvement in PH3 i.e what % of improvement would Mgmt would need to achieve to make it notable: LDL reduction 5% - 7% & HDL an increase of 5-10% 6) Would ACST do an Cardio outcome trial after Trilogy (asked by an analyst) - CEO we are waiting to see the results of Strength and see if they can replicate the outcome effects of Strength to determine if physicians see the results as an class omega 3 outcome effect. If they had to do one they would do one likely look to partner to conduct one (share in funding). 7) CMC / manufacturing - Full ramped at commercial scale (producing 20 - 30 tons per year and plans before commercialization before launch to get to 60 - 80 tons). NDA package on schedule to file by mid next year (currently at 50% completed)8) Krill oil suppliers - dozen suppliers they can access. They currently have access to Norwegian and Asian (better quality and price) suppliers. To produce 20 - 30 tons of capre they need double tonnage of krill oil.
"MTNB.... is a much stronger biopharma pony, given its robust, high-value rare disease LNC pipeline and plethora of A+ collaboration partners."
idk how much more it will drop ?
what is so special today
"So, next week Monday, June 29, 2020 Acasti investors will know very intrigue thing: how starch pills (4 x 1 g capsules administered orally once a day for 26 weeks) decreased TG by 28% in patients with fasting TG levels ≥500 mg/dL and ≤1500 mg/dL (≥5.7 mmol/L and ≤17.0 mmol/L). Do we have new very safe and cheap drug for hypertriglyceridemia? It will be good advertisement: ""Just eat several tea spoon of starch each day and your TG will drop to normal level during 12 weeks.""Well, questions now are: 1) which active compound effectively decreased TG in placebo group? 2) will FDA agree to separate such placebo patients in separated group i.e. as treated with active comparator? 3) why in Phase trial for CaPre inclusion Criteria for statins were:""Patients currently treated with statins and according to the judgement of the physician and the Canadian Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Dyslipidemia a change in their current drug regimen is not indicated for the duration of the study.Patients treated with statin must be on stable dose for at least 6 weeks prior to screening;""But in TRILOGY 1 and 2 it was changed to:""If the subject is not being treated and not contraindicated, a statin and/or CAI treatment may be initiated at the discretion of the Investigator at time of screening.""My question is who did this stupid changes in Inclusion Criteria for both TRILOGY 1 and 2 and ruined all results? All doctors like to prescribe statins and if they see ""subject"" that has high TG level and he/she is statin-naive in 100% cases they will initiate statin treatment. Well, patients should be on statin therapy at least 6 weeks prior to randomization (or even 12 weeks). But most likely that many patients in placebo group started statin 1-2 weeks before trail start (or even simultaneously with placebo pills). Now we have this terrible situation when practically all investors have huge losses. About funds: they just sold Acasti to erase losses in their portfolio. If FDA approve CaPre they have plenty of time to buy stocks from retail investors for $3-4 (many of they will sell)."
Ouch happy I sold pre split
Soon MTNB will be higher than ACSTPonder that
At this Time I’m hoping we will have solid positive results in December and January. Will add more next week
I need to get this at least to 6 to breal even lol. Worst stock i ever put money inside. Well i ll keep it a few years like it or not and wait to see results on the new drugs. Maybe climate will turn for small caps eventually
So much action here on this stock is just trading not investing. I’m with the long and bullish crew. $20k deep at an average of $1.38. Ouch. Feeling some pain but holding. I believe in this product and think the trial problems reflect other anomalies not the performance of the drug.
Just waiting around for the mid June FDA meeting unless someone wants to sell me some more shares under $0.40.
"If you’re a day trader, you should definitely check out (http://Rightpicker.com). They send a watchlist covering the top pre-market movers every day before the open. It’s a great way to pick out potential trades for the day."
"everybody will be very surprised when see Q1, 2020 ownership for ACST. My prediction that institutions/funds will own at least 25-30% of ACST with average pps $0.7. They know that TRILOGY 2 results will be very good and Acasti will investigate the reason of anomalous placebo results in TRILOGY 1. At the end of February ACST pps might in $3-5 range and this small cap biotech will become acquisition target for Big Pharmas. It's good price for entry. STRONG BUY ALERT for ACST"
"reality hurts, at the rate this seems to be dropping, by next week, $1.10- $.96"
Analysts changing predictions to a 1 making this a strong buy! Price target of $3.25+ don’t hesitate this is going to rocket this week!
(ARDS) $3.38 --MCap $47 m--2x BIG Phase 3 Drugs close to readout /Unknown gem = 1000%++ opportunity guys !!
going to .40 cents
"Well..it was very likely this, but, we hope it bounce back sometime soon. on most price usually drop, but, not for long. although we were already in the red prior, but, the merge should kick back. Let's hope for the best."
Advise everyone to quickly sell
come on guys let's make a run for .50 to take this thing off the charts.
I am ruling out the TLC diet effect hypothesis for the TG reduction. TLC diet is in fact shown to slightly increase TG as per study link below.https://www.jlr.org/content/43/2/264.long#T1
What will the share price be if we get approval before the end of the month? I am thinking about buy more tomorrow? Serious replies only please
"long story short, they should have never released these results without further investigation into what was going on with the high placebo effect. this managament team clearly hasn't a clue. i would have delayed trial results even further and explained what was going on."
"Why is Pfizer, Glaxo, Roche, Gilead, NIH and the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation funding 100% of MTNB's 10-12 LNC Rare Disease Treatments ? Because their LNC platform can take an approved IV treatment that is effective but highly toxic, and make it orally deliverable and significantly more efficacious and safer for patients.....In summary, does MTNB own a golden goose ?........Yes."
(EDSA) $5 -- MCap $68 m--Covid PHASE 2/3 data coming WITHIN DAYS = easy $$$$$$$$$
"What we see now - it's a final run up. FDA should response before June 30 i.e. any day (but usually FDA officers are lazy and send papers last day). If FDA agree with Acasti investigation and allow to remove mistakenly-treated patients from both TRILOGY 1 and 2 we will have new TG-decreasing drug stronger than Vascepa and protected by patents during next 18 years (Vascepa is generic now). If in addition CaPre significantly decreases glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) - we will have new treatment for diabetes patients that have high TG (usually have). Positive scenario - ACST pps jump to $5 What about negative one i.e. FDA says to open TRILOGY 2 data and then make one more Ph3 where to exclude all possible pitfalls in placebo arm (statins, insulin, etc)? Well, it will not be end of world for Acasti but pps will drop to $0.3 or even below. To make one more Ph3 they will need more money or BP partner. So, -50-60% pps drop vs. +400-500% spike. Very interesting game..."
Back to $5.00 !
"It was good update but investors need more information. Still not catch an idea why they need separate TRILOGY 2 results release from release of pooled results from both TRILOGY studies and key secondary and exploratory endpoints from both TRILOGY 1 and TRILOGY 2 (within several weeks following the unblinding of TRILOGY 2 results). How they are going to pool both T1 and T2 together? I hope we will know it at the end of August conference. So, final countdown for Acasti future starts tomorrow Saturday August 1st. As Buffett said now it will be greed and fear time for all who want sell, hold or buy ACST. Stock market is already unstable and volatile, wise investors should continuously monitor their portfolios and sell everything to avoid big crash. But Acasti is different story - everybody see that funds/institutions sold practically all shares in Q1. It generated huge fear among weak hands and they sold all shares with huge losses. Now they burned and angry and trying to scare ACST holders and new buyers. Acasti can't explain well the ""rapid, significant and sustained reduction in TG levels between screening (during qualification) and the time of patient randomization (prior to patients starting on either drug or placebo), which Acasti refers to as “Pre-randomization Triglyceride (TG) Normalization.” This artefactual phenomenon affected both treatment groups, but was much greater in the placebo group, resulting in the large placebo effect and significant underestimation of the post-randomization treatment effect of the active drug, CaPre."" I'm sure that the main reason was switch to TLC diet among patients that never follow this diet. When you have both TLC diet and CaPre - CaPre will be main factor for TG decreasing. But in placebo arm the diet become main factor. My hypothesis is simple here: at these 5 sites doctors were very persuasive in terms of to make patients to switch to very restrictive TLC diet right after they knew their TG results. It was big mistake - TLC diet itself can decrease TG level by 20-30% during several weeks. All patients should start TLC diet simultaneously with trial start. Anyway, I hope T2 trial had less these ""persuasive investigators"". Also TLC diet will lead to significant changes in blood parameters i.e. it will be visible in key secondary and exploratory endpoints from both TRILOGY 1 and TRILOGY 2. Wise biotech investors should be ""fearful when others are greedy and greedy only when others are fearful""."
won't this company be delisted from nasdaq if it stays under $ 1?
Wow! Its in the green in early trading!!!!
is it the ACAST.V (Tsx) only that went through RS or the US ACAST is also included? please I need your reply. thank you.
"""Acasti Pharma Submits Statistical Analysis Plan to FDA and Remains On Track to Report TRILOGY 2 Topline Data On or About August 31, 2020""""Acasti also announced it plans to host a conference call on or about August 31, 2020 to discuss the TRILOGY 2 topline results, as well as to provide an update on the timing for the reporting of the secondary and exploratory endpoints, and the pooled results from both TRILOGY studies. For this reason, the Company does not plan to host its usual quarterly conference call to discuss the financial results for the first fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2020, but expects to report and file its first fiscal quarter 2021 financial results on August 13, 2020."""
Until 0.30 again
"Here's a view. ACST was trading 6x higher in December when there was no knowledge of T1 or T2 results. While T1 failed to reach statistical significance due to the high placebo response we do know that CaPre performed very well reducing TG levels by 36.7% at 26-weeks, thus safe and efficacious long-term. One would then expect CaPre to perform near identical in T2. Due to a more uniform distribution of sites in T2 and by revising the SAP before unblinding there's a fair chance it will reach statistical significance. Given Amarin had just 1 P3 trial [Marine] for HTG approval and that T2 is larger they believe the FDA may allow them to file the NDA off of just T2. So, if a 6x valuation with no insight into the Trilogy results was justifiable, then I believe with what we know now from T1 and what we can infer about T2 the stock deserves a higher valuation, of at least $1/share in my view. Cheers!"
"$ACST Holding my stock until Level 2 results come out, and Level 1 placebo mystery is solved (likely site errors or patients taking some other medicines on the side). As you see some smart money is providing backstop at $0.55, there is a reasons someone is still buying. Let this panic sales pass and sky gets cleared in the next week or so,"

"Corporate highlights:On track to report topline results for TRILOGY 1 in December 2019 and TRILOGY 2 in January 2020More than 90% of randomized patients have completed the studiesData clean-up for TRILOGY 1 is 95% completedPlan to present full data set including results for key secondary and exploratory endpoints of interest such asnon-HDL-C, LDL-C, VLDL, HDL-C and HbA1c at important scientific meetings beginning in the first quarter of2020Approximately $25.8 million of cash and cash equivalents as at September 30, 2019; fully funded beyondcompletion of Phase 3 studiesAwarded $750,000 in grants from the Government of CanadaPartnered with Aker BioMarine to provide supply of raw krill oil to support product launch andcommercializationJan D’Alvise, president and CEO of Acasti Pharma, commented, “We continue on track to announce our Phase 3TRILOGY 1 topline results in December 2019 and TRILOGY 2 topline results in January 2020. We eagerly await thecompletion of the results from our two TRILOGY clinical studies for a number of reasons, including: (a) the largepatient population in our Phase 2 trials (675 patients) demonstrated both a significant reduction of triglycerides andalso indicated that CaPre may have a positive effect on other major lipid markers such as VLDL, LDL-C, and HDL-C(“Trifecta Effect”), as well as HbA1c in patients with diabetes; (b) patients enrolled in our Phase 3 trials have higherbaseline triglyceride levels (above 500 mg/dl) versus our Phase 2 studies, where most had baseline triglyceridessignificantly below 500 mg/dl; and (c) a favorable dose response was reported in the Phase 2 studies, in whichpatients received a range of doses (1 gram, 2 grams and 4 grams per day for only 8 to 12 weeks), which we believebodes well for our Phase 3 trials, in which all patients randomized to CaPre received 4 grams per day and willremain on drug for 6 months.”“Assuming our TRILOGY trials replicate our Phase 2 data, we believe CaPre has the potential to become a best-inclass omega-3, due to both the Trifecta Effect and greater bioavailability, especially in patients that follow thestandard physician-recommended, restricted low-fat diet. We believe these benefits are due to our uniquecomposition of phospholipids, EPA and DHA as compared to ""esterified"" pharmaceutical omega-3s derived from fishoils. Additionally, in all studies conducted to date, CaPre has shown no negative side effects or safety concerns.”“We are also ramping up our commercialization efforts. Most recently, we announced a supply agreement with AkerBioMarine to provide raw krill oil (RKO) to Acasti, under a two-year, fixed price supply agreement, which we believewill ensure an adequate raw material supply to meet our anticipated needs through at least mid-2021, includingscale-up of production to build future inventory for anticipated commercial launch. At the same time, we are in activediscussions with a number of pharma companies regarding potential commercialization partnerships in severalcountries around the world, and we look forward to providing further updates if and when developments unfold.”Both TRILOGY trials have achieved 100% patient randomization and more than 90% of the patients have nowcompleted their 6-month plan. As a result, the “last patient, last visit” in the TRILOGY 1 study remains on track totake place in November with topline results expected in December 2019 and the “last patient, last visit” in theTRILOGY 2 study remains on track to take place in early January with topline results expected towards the end ofJanuary 2020. Topline results will include a readout of the primary endpoint, which is intended to show CaPre’soverall impact on lowering triglycerides (TGs) after 12 weeks compared to placebo. The TRILOGY studies aredesigned to provide at least 90% statistical power to detect a difference of at least a 20% reduction from baseline inTGs between CaPre and placebo. As previously disclosed, the placebo used in the TRILOGY trials is cornstarch,which is inert, and consequently is expected to have a neutral effect on key biomarkers of patients in the placebogroup, and has been shown to not interfere with statin absorption and efficacy.The Company has shared the statistical analysis plan (SAP) for the analysis and reporting of the TRILOGY resultswith the FDA and will finalize the SAP prior to final database lock of TRILOGY 1, which Acasti expects to occurshortly. Subject to any input from the FDA, Acasti currently intends to report topline TRILOGY results independentlyfor each study as Acasti receives results and these topline results will include the primary endpoint of TG reductionat Week 12 compared to placebo. Safety and tolerability (e.g. overall adverse events (AE) and serious AE rate, anydiscontinuation due to AEs, and AEs of special interest such as gastrointestinal events) will also be reported.The Company currently expects that topline results will not include a"
"I really, with all this news, cannot understand why this is trading so low. Can anyone explain?"
"I’ve been following this one for 3 years, lost a fair share. This gang is criminal !"
3 weeks and we will know one very interesting thing: can be 4 grams of starch very powerful medication for high TG (even stronger than Vascepa)? Everybody who believe that simple starch (4g per day) can reduce your high TG (500-1500 range) -35-40% during 12 weeks should immediately sell ACST and buy AMRN (or starch).Wise and clever investors can just hold and buy more ACST shares.
"As part of the quaterly filling du tomorrow, by respect for shareholders, management should make the following announcements : 1) immediate management wage reduction by 20% till the placebo situation is resolve, 2) no bonus this year and 3) no stock options for management this year."
"In term of probability of success and upside vs downside, I think ACST and CaPre is better than 98% of micro biotechs in similar upcoming P2 or P3 readouts. I cant find a better bet in fact, so I am placed my bet on acst. They could have messed the trial up big time, but all data showed CaPre works, and I believe its patent estate is worth a lot more than $80M in a multi-billion market with no alternative to Vascepa for diabetics with high TG."
excellent news
how many folks here are going to keep on chanting great news in the morning?when was the last time we had any good news?going to the moon my #$%$
75M$ market cap?! Zero is where it’s going!
market looks like up
"Writeup from TipRanks:Acasti Pharma (ACST)Acasti Pharma’s primary goal is to develop new krill oil-based omega-3 phospholipid therapies that can be used to treat cardiometabolic diseases. CaPre, its lead candidate, was designed as a mixture of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) to lower triglycerides while also potentially benefitting LDL-C and HDL-C in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia. While unexpected trial data contributed to its 77% year-to-date decline, analysts are still betting that ACST can deliver a hefty dose of upside.On February 10, the company released an update noting that a review of Phase 3 TRILOGY 1 results for CaPre in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia is underway, which includes specific clinical site audits as well as an audit of the central testing laboratory. The original data showed an uncommon placebo response in its topline triglyceride reduction primary endpoint, which was much greater than seen in any previous omega-3 triglyceride reduction trials. Even though management claims to have monitored the trial, several inconsistencies were identified that possibly could have impacted the topline results.Weighing in on ACST for Echelon Wealth Partners is analyst Douglas Loe, who writes, “Though there is no denying that TRILOGY 1 failed to achieve its primary endpoint, independent of any explanations of this that would be irrelevant to statistical analysis of data anyway, we remain optimistic that data audit could reveal secondary details that bear more positively on CaPre’s own triglyceride-lowering activity, activity that has actually been well-documented in prior clinical studies conducted by Acasti itself.”Loe doesn’t dispute the fact that the clinical and regulatory risk remains high, but he does see it as a good sign that it’s making progress in interpreting the unusual data. Additionally, even with TRILOGY 2 data scheduled for release much later than previously expected, the analyst remains optimistic based on his “long-standing positive of CaPre’s published pharmacology and of omega-3 supplementation in general.”In line with this view, Loe reiterated a Buy recommendation. While he set a lower price target of $1.05, the forecast still leaves room for a possible 85% twelve-month gain. (To watch Loe’s track record, click here)As for the rest of the Street, other analysts take a similar approach when it comes to ACST. 3 Buys and 1 Hold issued in the last three months add up to a Strong Buy analyst consensus. The $3.35 average price target suggests that shares could skyrocket 509% in the next twelve months. (See Acasti Pharma price targets and analyst ratings on TipRanks)"
"For those interested, IR provided me with some feedback today to my questions regarding the post-hoc analysis. It also reiterated the intent of management to highlight the effacy trend in CaPre with the problematic sites removed from the data set. I haven't dug into these examples yet but plan to this evening and I'm anxious to see if there are any strong similarities. Cheers!As for the precedents mentioned, these include the following drugs/Companies:1. Horizon Pharma, NDA 022519, for Duexis. 2. Intra-Cellular Therapies, NDA 209500, for Caplyta. 3. Roche/InterMune, for Esbrief. 4. MDCO/NVS, for Kengreal.5. Takeda/Shire/NPS, for Natpara. 6. Esperion, for Bempadoic Acid + Ezetimibe. 7. Sage Therapeutics, for Zuranolone SAGE 217."
Acasti Pharma Price Target Announced at $8.00/Share by B. Riley FBR
volume increase canada side . if the us guys jump on to our side it will send this thing through the roof.
In summary: They have seen anomalies in the data from 5 sites. Now to dig into it and figure out what went on with each patient that had a positive placebo response equal to CaPre. Next step is to sit down with FDA for a data review and direction on how to proceed. Share price stays stagnant till then. Luckily they have enough $$ to get through to December 2020.
"They posted an article today saying that the stock had a great chance to recover again back to 2.55$. Yahoo doesn’t allow to post this link for some reason. I tried three times. Google it and filter results by last 24 hours, you’ll see. Should be something about 300% upside. Written and posted today (not from 2019)"
I think the buy orders will be much more than the sell orders today
Just needs 1 PR following merger that is drug specific and or patent look at INdP and what did today
"The landscape has changed significantly since last Fall when ACST traded as high as $3 and as Amarin with its unanimous adcom vote was careening toward $10B and a certain BO. What followed next no one could have anticipated completely including AZ ending the Strength trial, Trilogy 1 Placebogate, a worldwide pandemic, and Amarin losing its patent battle and catering to $5. There were multiple articles calling for ACST to soon close the gap on AMRN and $20 price targets were considered conservative. But for those who've held on, or added and averaged down, ACST could rise like a phoenix from the ashes. Management is quietly optimistic following the audit and has promptly requested a meeting with the FDA. Oppenheimer's Leland Gershell thinks the stock will recover maintaining his buy rating and $7 price. Most however have dramatically lowered their expectations or have completely cut and run while all the authors have not surprisingly run out of ink. All things considered this could be the perfect set up for a significant upside surprise if the stars come back into alignment. Should the FDA extend them an olive branch and if the secondary endpoints demonstrate statistical significance the return to $3 or higher could be swift. On the downside we're just $0.36 away from the absolute bottom. I like the risk/reward ratio, I think management has a fair chance of salvaging the Trilogy study, and I believe this could become the turnaround story that no one ever expected. Cheers!"
is there a split?
shorts keep sending the stock down so it will blow . I'm tired of waiting. work faster .
"Once again: according to probability theory TRILOGY 2 results will never be similar to TRILOGY 1 results. High placebo phenomena in TRILOGY 1 will be never repeated in TRILOGY 2 because it was so-called ""outlier result"".In statistics, an outlier is a data point that differs significantly from other observations. An outlier may be due to variability in the measurement or it may indicate experimental error; the latter are sometimes excluded from the data set.When Acasti plan both trials design they underestimated possible effect NCEP-TLC diet on trial participant and especially in placebo arm. As I cited below such diet alone can induce -15% TG during only 6 weeks. Amarin when tested Vascepa never asked participants to be on TLC diet and their placebo group added +10-15% TG during trial. Which trial design is closer to real life? Doctors always suggest to switch to TLC if you have both high TC and TG. If you follow just diet and have higher physical activity you can easy drop TG by 15-20%. If you add CaPre you can get -35-40% drop. But trial participants must be on this diet at least 3 months before start trial with CaPre. Anyway, many wise investors know what is probability theory and what is ""outlier results"". High placebo result in T1 was outlier and after T2 it can be excluded from data set."
load it. up
"Factors at play, general market is perceived to have reached a bubble - now having negative overall effect on this stock as well. This drug with expected minimal side effects which plays in favor of approval. Study design did not anticipate large increase in placement of statin therapy and lifestyle changes (more in placebo arm) and premature jump last week with announcement that was not based on results but overall positive making the stock jump, now retracting with the rest of the market. Take home, despite what the overall market does, Monday will reveal if Trilogy 1 vs Trilogy 2 will send the stock price to the next level."
Soon back to $0.119 :)
"I have no idea what’s the stock is going to do, but if the company is not going bankrupt, then I am not selling."
Number of stocks are less and scope is much bigger with the merger Chances for a great move up

The company’s shares closed last Monday at $2.33.I know it is sort of over-spoken a lot till the data is released, but still, pleasing."
Strong Potential for Reaching $ 0.7 to $0.9 today. The quality is Less Hype...Once the News revealed then We will see the Magic ! 
Better than expected results and nice info on the acquisition. Looks like the company has a plan to get in line with the NASDAQ rules otherwise they would not request hearing and pay 10k just for that. I opened a position at 0.48 and will w8 until 2022 for the results of trial 1 on the new medicine from Grace. Looks promising and if approved by FDA we are talking about 7 year revenues without any other contestant!
Can you people read. The PR clearly states 1-8 reverse split starting with trading on August 31.
"This is dying quick. Im sure glad I stuck my life's saving into it, I need at least .84 to break even or else i'm done."
Why the revenue qt3 was good but stock still dropping too low ?
