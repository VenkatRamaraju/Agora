once all the weakies give up their shares this will skyrocket. just wait
"Rest in peace, my portfolio"
The company has fature in my opinion but I don't like that they don't respect the share holders. But I believe in a long term the company will grow.
I hope this is the big dip.....
Too bad there is no options trading on this. Perfect setup for buying puts.
shorts keep sending the stock down so it will blow . I'm tired of waiting. work faster .
First post. Longtime lurker. Long and bullish. Optimistic about the results. Lot of conspiracy theory about the delay but I bet it’s pretty simple. Lab and scientists didn’t get it all together in time to hit their target. If results are good there is still a long way to go before approval. Many paths to take. Lower than avg volume today. People just holding and waiting. I will buy the big dips still. Of course it’s speculation still but every portfolio needs some risk in it...
The CEO should take a pay reduction at this point.
"Just summary for Philippe hypothesis what happened in TRILOGY 1 trial. I'm sure that all ACST investors ask just one question: why CaPre Ph2 showed very good results but Ph3 CaPre TG results were smashed by high placebo effect? Let's see what inclusion criteria in both Ph2: TRIal For Efficacy of Capre on hyperTriglyceridemiA (TRIFECTA)Inclusion Criteria:• Patients who are currently not on pharmacotherapy for hyperlipidemia and according to the judgement of the physician and Canadian Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Dyslipidemia initiation of drug therapy is not indicated for the duration of the study.• Patients currently treated with statins and according to the judgement of the physician and the Canadian Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Dyslipidemia a change in their current drug regimen is not indicated for the duration of the study.• PATIENTS TREATED WITH STATIN MUST BE ON STABLE DOSE FOR AT LEAST 6 WEEKS PRIOR TO SCREENING.Assess the Safety and Efficacy of NKPL66 (CaPre) in the Treatment of Mild-to-high HypertriglyceridemiaInclusion Criteria:• Patients who are currently not on pharmacotherapy for hyperlipidemia and according to the judgement of the physician and Canadian Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Dyslipidemia initiation of drug therapy is not indicated for the duration of the study.OR• Patients currently treated with statins and according to the judgement of the physician and the Canadian Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Dyslipidemia a change in their current drug regimen is not indicated for the duration of the study.• PATIENTS TREATED WITH STATIN MUST BE ON STABLE DOSE FOR AT LEAST 6 WEEKS PRIOR TO SCREENING;See capitalised text: patients that have statin medication are accepted in trial but they should start statin treatment at least 6 WEEKS PRIOR TO SCREENING. In simple words statins already decreased TG to some lower level in these patients (approximately 25-28% according published clinical trials). Now open inclusion criteria of TRILOGY 1:A Phase 3 STudy of CaPRe In LOwering Very hiGh TriglYcerides (TRILOGY 1) (TRILOGY 1)Inclusion Criteria:1. Subjects ≥18 years of age.2. Isolated hypertriglyceridemia, with triglycerides ≥500 mg/dL and <1500 mg/dL (≥5.7 mmol/L and <17.0 mmol/L) OR Mixed hyperlipidemia, with serum triglycerides ≥500 and <1500 mg/dL treated with a statin, CAI or PCSK9I inhibitor, alone or in combination, that has been stable for 6 weeks prior to randomization. IF THE SUBJECT IS NOT BEING TREATED AND NOT CONTRAINDICATED, A STATIN AND/OR CAI TREATMENT MAY BE INITIATED AT THE DISCRETION OF THE INVESTIGATOR AT TIME OF SCREENING.See the difference? They allowed to start statin treatment AT THE DISCRETION OF THE INVESTIGATOR AT TIME OF SCREENING. In simple words some patients that never had statin treatment got statins together with placebo. And these PATIENTS TREATED WITH STATIN NEVER WERE ON STABLE DOSE FOR AT LEAST 6 WEEKS PRIOR TO SCREENING. As a result all these patients that never had statin medication and started to get ""statin + starch"" showed very strong decreasing of TG at week 12. And the reason was simple: statins are very effective for decreasing of TG. It's ACTIVE COMPOUND for TG treatment. Conclusions: most likely Acasti will admit that placebo effect was induced by incorrect dosage of placebo patients with active compound statin. All these patients will be eliminated from statistics or separated to group that was treated with ACTIVE COMPARATOR. Many Acasti investors have terrible losses because of this stupid mistake in trial design. They can easy compensate it if buy ACST right now."
Is this company doing something or just occupying space!!!
(ARDS) $3.38 --MCap $47 m--2x BIG Phase 3 Drugs close to readout /Unknown gem = 1000%++ opportunity guys !!
"First time during my more than 10 years investment experience in biotech sector I see such low pps for company that is going to release Ph3 data for potential blockbuster drug during next 4-5 days. I can understand it if CaPre completely failed TRILOGY 1 but it's not true - TG decreasing effect was very strong. Unexpected spontaneous TG decreasing in placebo arm was well investigated and most likely was induced too vigorous TLC diet. -35% decreasing of TG in CaPre arm was not an aberration or some kind of miracle. Very good effect on target in both treated and placebo arm is very rare event in clinical trials, maybe it's even unique event for TRILOGY 1. It's very unlikely that such unique event will be repeated in TRILOGY 2. Secondary measures of both T1 and T2 will explain all strange things that happened for CaPre. Once again, each investor should analyse target company ""under microscope"" and decide to invest or not invest. Acasti is high risk/very high reward company - buy 1000 shares now and you can lose just $300-400 or win $3000-4000 ($5 pps is reasonable for ACST if CaPre showed results better than Vascepa)."

Can you people read. The PR clearly states 1-8 reverse split starting with trading on August 31.
how many feel this will go past 12 bucks?
Ouch happy I sold pre split
thats what everyone wants.lol
"Has anyone read any of the Trilogy 1 reports discussing the HbgA1c results? According to their report ""The Phase 2 data also showed a significant reduction of HbA1c at a 4 gram dose, suggesting that due to its unique omega-3/phospholipid composition, CaPre may actually improve long-term glucose metabolism."""
Reverse split again
"anyone else with Questrade, mine is still not updated, sitting in limbo"
"reality hurts, at the rate this seems to be dropping, by next week, $1.10- $.96"
I was 70% in the red 28 days ago; today I am 74% in the red...I hope anyone investing here is warn with my message. Invest elsewhere! save yourself!
"MTNB.... is a much stronger biopharma pony, given its robust, high-value rare disease LNC pipeline and plethora of A+ collaboration partners."
Technical analysis and fundamentals state that it is a good buy and hopefully will jump to 5 USD very soon
What goes down also goes up/ Its biotech!! Normal and adding on every dip.
revendra McDonald called asking why you didn't show up at work today
Reasons I initially invested in Acst was this study. To be clear I’ve only been in ACST about a year but found this good supporting evidence that the science works. Maybe mgmt pulls a mulligan or maybe not. Good luck all longs. Shorts there is nothing to see here (low downside left) best to move on :) Page 423-424. Even placebo knocked it down 10%... http://archive.foundationalmedicinereview.com/publications/9/4/420.pdfhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/15656713/
"Bye, Bye,   "
Just lost so much money on the #$%$
Just needs 1 PR following merger that is drug specific and or patent look at INdP and what did today
"They have around $20M in cash: NO CASH problem in the short term !Here is the situation: TG were reduced by 30.5% (12 weeks) and 36.7% (26 weeks) with NO AE (adverse events). Those results are a SLAM DUNK. FDA won't ignore a drug that reduce TG by over 36% in 26 weeks. Those results are 100% in line with the COLT Study which were with 2gr/4gr (8 weeks) 21.6%/23.3%. FDA will review all the data in this context. This drug WORKS. PLACEBO PROBLEM: The placebo number is Capre/placebo 2.5/1 which represent 70 patients on placebo vs around 172 patients on Capre. The problem is specific to 5 sites which represent around 36% or 25 patients on placebo. THIS IS NOT a significant number. As per COLT study, the placebo (N=29) was +2.5% after 4 weeks vs Trilogy 1 at -27.5% which doesn't make any sens. If the remaining balance is around -5% this means that de 25 patients are aver - 50% TG reduction for 4 weeks. In any study the FDA will accept a placebo with this kind of results. ROOT CAUSE : We can speculate on various explanations (raw material contamination, manipulation error, falsification, other lipid medication, etc etc), the only thing we are sure is that its not the act of GOD and its would founded to be true, this mean that cornstarch is a better drug than Amarin. NEXT STEPS : Let's be positive, management will find the explanation and T2 will give us the same great numbers, secondary end points will be meet and in March and glucose reduction will be confirmed. WORST CASE : what is the worst case, they don't find any explanation!? FDA agree that it does make any sense and they Acasti is required to do a 4 weeks trial 1:1 placebo:Capree with around 50 patients. Acasti T1 & T2 only required to hit -11% placebo reduction to have the 20% TG reduction. Lets be honest, the FDA won't throw to the basket the entire study. End of story. GLTA"
"""Acasti Pharma Submits Statistical Analysis Plan to FDA and Remains On Track to Report TRILOGY 2 Topline Data On or About August 31, 2020""""Acasti also announced it plans to host a conference call on or about August 31, 2020 to discuss the TRILOGY 2 topline results, as well as to provide an update on the timing for the reporting of the secondary and exploratory endpoints, and the pooled results from both TRILOGY studies. For this reason, the Company does not plan to host its usual quarterly conference call to discuss the financial results for the first fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2020, but expects to report and file its first fiscal quarter 2021 financial results on August 13, 2020."""
"I really like the way ACST managemement responded. No stock promotion. No hints of good or bad news and left everyone vuessing. Never done anything to promote ACST stocks in the past other than talked about CaPre data. They are a conservative bunch and for microcap investment, it ‘s a great sign. Stay away from management who always promote and tout their stocks and raise cash at every opportunity."
volume increase canada side . if the us guys jump on to our side it will send this thing through the roof.
"The wording with regards to statins can easily be misinterpreted and I believe the problem at the 5 sites lies there. Read carefully: 'Isolated hypertriglyceridemia, with triglycerides ≥500 mg/dL and <1500 mg/dL (≥5.7 mmol/L and <17.0 mmol/L) OR Mixed hyperlipidemia, with serum triglycerides ≥500 and <1500 mg/dL treated with a statin, CAI or PCSK9I inhibitor, alone or in combination, that has been stable for 6 weeks prior to randomization. If the subject is not being treated and not contraindicated, a statin and/or CAI treatment may be initiated at the discretion of the Investigator AT TIME OF SCREENING.'The way the trial was designed was to allow for statins to be initiated 8-9 weeks BEFORE randomization in order for them to reach full effect on lipid profile and stabilize lipid profile before randomization. However it may have been interpreted at some sites that the physician would decide at the time of screening if patient would be initiated on statins, but those physicians would have instructed patients to start statins treatment only at randomization (when trial starts), therefore increasing response in both placebo AND CaPre arm, which is what has been seen. Also supports the fact that most of the placebo effect was seen in the first 4 weeks, which would be normal if placebo patients had just started statins."
hope im not the only one that see this going to go big.lol
there where many times when I wanted to sell but I just push it way down south .I still believe this is a good company and that they will soon be profitable.
"For those interested, IR provided me with some feedback today to my questions regarding the post-hoc analysis. It also reiterated the intent of management to highlight the effacy trend in CaPre with the problematic sites removed from the data set. I haven't dug into these examples yet but plan to this evening and I'm anxious to see if there are any strong similarities. Cheers!As for the precedents mentioned, these include the following drugs/Companies:1. Horizon Pharma, NDA 022519, for Duexis. 2. Intra-Cellular Therapies, NDA 209500, for Caplyta. 3. Roche/InterMune, for Esbrief. 4. MDCO/NVS, for Kengreal.5. Takeda/Shire/NPS, for Natpara. 6. Esperion, for Bempadoic Acid + Ezetimibe. 7. Sage Therapeutics, for Zuranolone SAGE 217."
"Recent Q1, 2020 13F filings should be very interesting for Acasti investors. My prediction that Institutional Ownership should jump from 05.88% in Q4, 2019 to 10-15% in Q1, 2020. Shorts know that funds are accumulating ACST and covering during last 4 months: from 2,277,902 in 1/15/2020 to 322,116 in 4/15/2020. Increased Positions 24 1,982,656Decreased Positions 11 267,266Also good sign. Acasti management did very bad thing to retail investors: the results of TRILOGY 1 scared the majority of them and forced to sale shares with huge losses. They did it because of the articles that said:""TRILOGY 1 results didn’t reach statistical significance against placebo. But CaPre actually worked. The issue was that the placebo worked nearly as well. Median triglyceride levels dropped 30.5% for patients receiving CaPre — and 27.5% in the placebo group. That latter performance doesn’t seem to make much sense. The placebo is just cornstarch, which should have zero effect. (That’s, of course, why cornstarch was chosen as a placebo in the first place.) In similar trials, the effect usually was in a range between -10% and +10%.""The first statement ""results didn’t reach statistical significance against placebo"" is false one. Specially designed to scare investors. They should said that both treated with CaPre arm and placebo arm showed very high TG level drop. Such drop of TG in placebo group can't be explained if patients got only starch pills but not additional treatment with other active compound that can alone significantly decrease TG level i.e. statins. Authors of such articles did good job for funds/institutions: they helped them to buy very cheap Acasti shares. After CaPre approval by FDA funds will have huge gain."
when will acasti get it together.
market looks like up
"I think this is definitely a moment where it will ultimately pay not to panic with all the sellers and average down. I mean good grief who sells at a loss in pre market when the price is so easily manipulated. The data points clearly to 1: the medicine works and 2: there was some sort of error in the testing. A real placebo effect will not be concentrated in 1/10th of the testing sites, it will be relatively constant across the board. But for those 5 sites the results would have been outstanding, surpassing results of nearly all its competitors. It will get sorted out. The smart money is on sobriety, patients and buying this dip."
Avg @ .70 - will probably hold for another week before finally letting go.
Bought 1000 shares today. That is my biggest investment in my life  wish me luck please 
Until 0.30 again
"What we see now - it's a final run up. FDA should response before June 30 i.e. any day (but usually FDA officers are lazy and send papers last day). If FDA agree with Acasti investigation and allow to remove mistakenly-treated patients from both TRILOGY 1 and 2 we will have new TG-decreasing drug stronger than Vascepa and protected by patents during next 18 years (Vascepa is generic now). If in addition CaPre significantly decreases glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) - we will have new treatment for diabetes patients that have high TG (usually have). Positive scenario - ACST pps jump to $5 What about negative one i.e. FDA says to open TRILOGY 2 data and then make one more Ph3 where to exclude all possible pitfalls in placebo arm (statins, insulin, etc)? Well, it will not be end of world for Acasti but pps will drop to $0.3 or even below. To make one more Ph3 they will need more money or BP partner. So, -50-60% pps drop vs. +400-500% spike. Very interesting game..."
excellent news
This company's Ceo should be in prison. This is company does not care for their stock holders or putting out anything that resembles a treatment for anything. This Ceo is smoke and mirrors.
"News! Won't let me put a link.LAVAL, Quebec, April 30, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Acasti Pharma Inc. (“Acasti” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: ACST – TSX-V: ACST), a biopharmaceutical innovator focused on the research, development and commercialization of its prescription drug candidate CaPre (omega-3 phospholipid) for the treatment of severe hypertriglyceridemia, today announced that it submitted its briefing package on April 29, 2020 to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for review. The Company is currently awaiting comments, and expects a formal response from the FDA on or before June 30, 2020.As previously reported, Acasti filed its meeting request at the end of March, and this briefing package is now intended to provide the FDA with a review of the relevant TRILOGY 1 data and audit findings, with the objective to gain alignment on the interpretation of the TRILOGY 1 results and implications for TRILOGY 2. The Company will also seek the FDA’s input on Acasti’s proposed revisions to the pre-specified TRILOGY 2 statistical analysis plan (SAP), and explore and hopefully reach agreement on a plan for pooling the data from TRILOGY 1 and TRILOGY 2 to support an NDA filing. Acasti continues to remain blinded to the TRILOGY 2 results, and intends to update the statistical analysis plan (SAP) with these revisions if the FDA agrees.Jan D’Alvise, President and CEO of Acasti Pharma, commented, “We have submitted our briefing package to the FDA for their review, and are now awaiting their formal response. We remain optimistic that we may still have a viable path toward filing an NDA. We look forward to the FDA’s feedback on our briefing package, and expect that they will provide valuable guidance on the next steps to be taken towards the unblinding of TRILOGY 2. We will provide more information about our TRILOGY 1 findings, and the FDA’s response to our briefing package and our questions after we get it.”Acasti also announced today that it has received notice of issuance of a composition of matter patent to be awarded by the Intellectual Property Office in Hong Kong. This new patent grants claims for any composition containing EPA and DHA, where at least 50% of the composition consists of phospholipids.About CaPre (omega-3 phospholipid)Acasti’s prescription drug candidate, CaPre, is a highly purified omega-3 phospholipid concentrate derived from krill oil, and is being developed to treat severe hypertriglyceridemia, a metabolic condition that contributes to increased risk of cardiovascular disease and pancreatitis. Its omega-3s, principally EPA and DHA, are either “free” or bound to phospholipids, which allows for better absorption into the body. Acasti believes that EPA and DHA are more efficiently transported by phospholipids sourced from krill oil than the EPA and DHA contained in fish oil that are transported either by triglycerides (as in dietary supplements) or as ethyl esters in other prescription omega-3 drugs, which must then undergo additional digestion before they are ready for transport in the bloodstream. Clinically, the phospholipids may not only improve the absorption, distribution, and metabolism of omega-3s, but they may also decrease the synthesis of LDL cholesterol in the liver, impede or block cholesterol absorption, and stimulate lipid secretion from bile. In two Phase 2 studies, CaPre achieved a statistically significant reduction of triglycerides and non-HDL cholesterol levels in patients across the dyslipidemia spectrum from patients with mild to moderate hypertriglyceridemia (patients with TG blood levels between 200mg/dl and 500mg/dl) to patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia (those with TG levels above 500mg/dl). Furthermore, in the Phase 2 studies, CaPre demonstrated the potential to actually reduce LDL, or “bad cholesterol”, as well as the potential to increase HDL, or “good cholesterol”, especially at the therapeutic dose of 4 grams/day. The Phase 2 data also showed a significant reduction of HbA1c at a 4 gram dose, suggesting that due to its unique omega-3/phospholipid composition, CaPre may actually improve long-term glucose metabolism. Acasti’s TRILOGY Phase 3 program is currently underway.About Acasti PharmaAcasti is a biopharmaceutical innovator advancing a potentially best-in-class cardiovascular drug, CaPre (omega-3 phospholipid), for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia, a chronic condition affecting an estimated one third of the U.S. population. Since its founding in 2008, Acasti has focused on addressing a critical market need for an effective, safe and well-absorbing omega-3 therapeutic that can make a positive impact on the major blood lipids associated with cardiovascular disease risk. The Company is developing CaPre in a Phase 3 clinical program in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia, a market that includes 3 to 4 million patients in the U.S. The addressable market may expand significantly if omega-3s demonstrate long-term cardiovascular benef"
"Well, main event next week for Acasti will be the results of post-hoc analyses of TRILOGY 1. It will be impossible to hide the reason of unusually strong effect of placebo at 5 sites and if it was a mistake in trial design Acasti lawyers will have very hard time. They can blame investigators at sites but they should admit that Inclusion Criteria allowed these investigators to make very critical mistakes like to prescribe statins to statin-naive trial participants. It's like if it was a trial for AD drug and its trial design allowed to prescribe Aricept to all participants that were Aricept-naive. The results will be similar to T1: both treated arm and placebo arm will show significant improvement in ADAS-Cog and other AD tests. If FDA sees the reason of such unusually high placebo effect they will definitely allow to do post-hoc analysis because there are not so many effective drugs for AD. There are several FDA approved drugs for hypertriglyceridemia so FDA is not very excited about new one. Another trump card could be ""significant reduction of HbA1c at a 4 gram dose"" - no one hypertriglyceridemia drug can do it. So, you can sell, hold or buy Acasti shares now - nobody can predict pps after Monday presentation. Even if post-hoc showed perfect results (repeat Ph2 for CaPre) pessimists will say that FDA will not accept it. TRILOGY 2 results might be also perfect (even without exclusion of incorrectly treated patients) but pessimists will again say that T2 is not enough for CaPre approval i.e. additional study might be needed. So, just think logically and make correct decision."
"AS soon as frustrated weak hands got shaken out, they grab the shares and run with it. Always."
Monday 
"Took this off of Stocktwits by Gene Katz @ SA earlier this afternoon: ""After more research, my expectation is that CaPre will get approximately 40% Trig reduction (adjusted), which will be comparable to 33% for Vascepa (adjusted). On an unadjusted basis, Vascepa is approximately 20% (per Marine study). I am expecting for CaPre to be superior on an unadjusted basis as well. The FDA will get both adjusted and unadjusted data, but will likely allow the marketing of the adjusted 40% number, as it will be apples-to-apples with Vascepa's 33%. The adjusted numbers will be considered versus the 20% marker for TRILOGY, which means CaPre will certainly succeed in the Phase 3 trial. Consequently, CaPre's story will be 'better trig reduction plus', considering the other clear advantages to bioavailability, cholesterol and diabetic sugars. After confirming with management, Phase 3 should be out Dec 20-23 (""just before Christmas""). -CONTINUED.. take it for what it is worth"
"I really, with all this news, cannot understand why this is trading so low. Can anyone explain?"
"Acasti Pharma Inc. (NASDAQ: ACST) rose 6.3% to $0.4835 in pre-market trading. Acasti Pharma recently announced its operating and financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 ended June 30, 2021."
I think I'm going to sell.
"Me coaching Jan for the conf call tomorrow : 1) Shareholders we are sorry for you losses (…) 2) we have find the placebo 5 sites problem and we are currently finalizing the documentation for the FDA (…) 3) the timeframe provided is the worst case scenario and we expect to give you an update as soon as possible 4) We are fully funded till end of 2020 and we have reduced our wage by 20% since Jan 13th, there will be no bonus or stock options this year. 5) Thank you very much for your patient, understanding and we are fully commited to deliver value to our shareholders."
What will the share price be if we get approval before the end of the month? I am thinking about buy more tomorrow? Serious replies only please
"Yesterday I asked IR to post p values and this is their response below: Response from David Waldman Crescendo IR“We are reporting median values – not averages or means. The FDA requires this, and all of the other companies have always reported median TG values for an apples to apples comparison. We need to have all of the raw data and create a histogram without the patients in these 5 sites to find the new mid-point or median. So we really can’t speculate what that new median number could be without doing the analysis. This is what we are focusing on now with the statistical experts, and it is going to take some time. Ultimately it will only be valid to remove these patients if supported by our audit evidence. We are working diligently and will put out further updates as soon as possible."
"As part of the quaterly filling du tomorrow, by respect for shareholders, management should make the following announcements : 1) immediate management wage reduction by 20% till the placebo situation is resolve, 2) no bonus this year and 3) no stock options for management this year."
Why the revenue qt3 was good but stock still dropping too low ?
Big news coming out this week. Get it while it's low.
I did my best to warn everybody here. The only purpose this stock exists is to fleece shareholders...
"Very interesting release from Amarin. Highly positive. They see bigger potential than previously and fully going after the much larger potential user group than the initial approval was aimed at. Nothing new, this was expected. The question of the day is should Amarin have a market cap 670 times as large as Acasti. Acasti is an incredible 4 month to 4 year play. One needs to own the stock to enjoy the full ride."
"this stock is incredibly undervalued. Upon initial announcement of positive AMRN results of ANCOR study back in 2010, their shares rallied from $3 to $9 over few months and then to $16 upon submission of their NDA for VHTG. you may expect a similar trend if P3 result for Trilogy 1 & 2 are successful later this year. Best of luck"
"It looks like that many Acasti investors are pessimistic about recent update. But this update is more than positive: 1) FDA supported the conduct of post-hoc analyses in TRILOGY 1 for exploratory purposes. Acasti statisticians will conduct further post-hoc analysis based on FDA’s comments and feedback on the TRILOGY 1 data. Explanation: Acasti investigation showed that some patients in placebo group were treated incorrectly and should be excluded from analysis. FDA agreed with the investigation data and want to see the results when such patients are excluded.2) FDA confirmed that it will require pivotal efficacy analyses for TRILOGY 2 to be performed on the full Intent to Treat (ITT) population as contemplated in the original Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).Since Acasti knows the reason of high placebo effect such patients might be separated in special group. Statistics might be performed with and without separation to show that incorrect treatment (for example prescription of statin to statin-naive patients in placebo group) leads to TG decreasing. Exclusion of such patients should show clear CaPre effect. Anyway, very soon they should say what was wrong in placebo group. 2)"
"Well, there is simplest explanation for this pps spike: too many people working in Acasti know the reason of high placebo effect. The information is just leaked out and friends, relatives etc started to buy ACST shares like crazy. They are 100% sure that FDA will accept Acasti investigation data as reasonable and allow to correct TRILOGY 1 and 2 statistics (remove all patients that were treated incorrectly with statins or got insulin treatment during trial start). CaPre has significant advantage in comparison with Vascepa - you can take CaPre without fat food and it will active for TG decreasing. Vascepa taken without fat food is just waste of money - it will not be absorbed. Fat food increase your TG and bad cholesterol. Conclusion: Acasti pps should be at least $2-3 even before FDA decision. After positive one (correction of TRILOGY 1 and 2 results) - $10"
Every stock but a few are up today. Move on people. Buy steel or oil stocks.
come on guys let's make a run for .50 to take this thing off the charts.
we double diped yesterday so im guessing today high roller.
"This is dying quick. Im sure glad I stuck my life's saving into it, I need at least .84 to break even or else i'm done."
ACST announced reverse split this weekend. Notice came in Saturday. No mention of what multiple will be used.
what is so special today
"If you’re a day trader, you should definitely check out (http://Rightpicker.com). They send a watchlist covering the top pre-market movers every day before the open. It’s a great way to pick out potential trades for the day."
"Smoke and mirrors...At $3.02, ACST is still only... 37 cents a share .....pre reverse split !"
"I trust the Acasti team is working hard to figure this out as they have a lot at stake - their jobs, their families, their stock options, their career, their reputation, their future, the company itself...it's all on the line at the moment. The emotions and reactions of retail investors is certainly shared and magnified at their layer. The drug works - this was demonstrated in previous trials and even in Trilogy 1. If you think this placebo issue is game over, turn out the lights and shut the door, the stock goes to zero...I think you're in for a surprise. Yes, it may result in an additional P3 trial and more stock dilution and more time but no one would just folds and quits at this point. No. This will always be a big bump in the road and a point where many investors rightfully capitulated, but the road doesn't end here."
won't this company be delisted from nasdaq if it stays under $ 1?
Can someone help me understand what the market was looking for on this one? If the news had been negative the stock would have been at .30C. Instead it was positive and it slides to .73C. Assuming that word leaked late yesterday inspiring someone to buy 1 million shares likely at an average of somewhere near an .84C or someone short this stock rushed to cover? Shouldn't this have been north of $1 today? I'm just trying hard to understand why it went down? Please help
Mark this post seller going to cry in 1 week time frame !
It's too early to say...
Greenday!!!
Buying back under $2 a share
bye bye money
I don't understand stand acasti has a cash flow of 57 m. why is the stock going down. they are a good company even without carpre . and also they saying they will meet the dallor . what wrong with people. hold your money .
going to .40 cents
"In a report released yesterday, Douglas Loe from Echelon Wealth Partners maintained a Buy rating on Acasti Pharma (ACST – Research Report), with a price target of C$4.00. The company’s shares closed last Monday at $2.33.I know it is sort of over-spoken a lot till the data is released, but still, pleasing."
When will this starts to rocket! if we see it by numbers they should not be this low...
everyone sitting on the side line hoping to it will jump. on interested too much in this stock. no one remembers this stock at one time used to be 40 plus dallors .....

"when is the reverse stock split, or did it already occur. thanks, jimmy"
does anyone have any idea how this will be after the news ?.
might as well take your loss and move on; this ship only sinking lower
is it the ACAST.V (Tsx) only that went through RS or the US ACAST is also included? please I need your reply. thank you.
it is the best to continue to hold to all holders. Definitely will not go under with thebreverse split and aquisition of Grace.
"Hey guys mine is negative 17k but stay Hope. Like Cei , NAK, nakd, CTRM … thought these would die but now they are going up"
"Well..it was very likely this, but, we hope it bounce back sometime soon. on most price usually drop, but, not for long. although we were already in the red prior, but, the merge should kick back. Let's hope for the best."
ya there plant blew up and people died but that was so long ago . we need to forget about the past focus on the future.
is there a split?
"The reason for unexpected placebo results at 5 sites: Patients with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes or uncontrolled latent autoimmune diabetes of adults typically also have severe hypertriglyceridemia. We start these patients on basal bolus insulin regimen right away and that also brings their triglyceride levels from almost close to 500-1000 down to normal or near normal range. Unless otherwise indicated, we don’t necessarily start these patients on TG lowering agents other than statins. That’s because we expect their TG to come down drastically with insulin. Insulin activates Lipoprotein lipase; the enzyme that breaks down triglycerides. Patients like these should not have been included in the clinical trial conducted by ACST. This was a unintentional mistake at these 5 sites. FDA will understand this scientific basis of unexpected results in the placebo group. Provided Trilogy 2 results are favorable, we should expect an NDA filing in the fall. Thank you."
"65% in the red with this stock..well, I guess just hold until who knows when :("
where is the stock police when you need them . this is highway robbery. but I guess the people buy now don't have much worries. 
The reverse split will be effective on 8/31; not all reverse split are bad and this one is no exception. this reverse split will be really good for all the holders.
The reverse stock split doesn't change the fact that CaPre failed two Phase 3 trials....The sell off is not a mystery but an expectation.
amazing conference call. One of the best i 've heard on bio sector the last year. Sufficient money for running business for 2 more years. all medicines of grace going for orphan drug designation and amazing results for the first one of them. RS wont happen unless completely necessary and asked from nasdaq for compliance and between the range of 1to6 or 1to8 IF it happens.
I read on reddit that this is abiut to get delisted. Is this the case here?
Game is being played here to flush out shares from tired investors. About time to buy!!!
im so glad i sold it at .65 few months ago with the loss of 20 percent loss in the trade
Aug 26 .judgement day.

Back to $5.00 !
"While ACST looks like a sinking ship, MTNB ...looks more like the SLS Rocket"
Its a hard gamble .But i keep asking my self why they merged if the did see the company growing .stocks do take time and some people actually most people expect quick money .i think share holders will be very happy for the new year.
well looks like we going up today. lets see the run.
Buying some extra when it opens!!
Horrible job by board and management!
"The landscape has changed significantly since last Fall when ACST traded as high as $3 and as Amarin with its unanimous adcom vote was careening toward $10B and a certain BO. What followed next no one could have anticipated completely including AZ ending the Strength trial, Trilogy 1 Placebogate, a worldwide pandemic, and Amarin losing its patent battle and catering to $5. There were multiple articles calling for ACST to soon close the gap on AMRN and $20 price targets were considered conservative. But for those who've held on, or added and averaged down, ACST could rise like a phoenix from the ashes. Management is quietly optimistic following the audit and has promptly requested a meeting with the FDA. Oppenheimer's Leland Gershell thinks the stock will recover maintaining his buy rating and $7 price. Most however have dramatically lowered their expectations or have completely cut and run while all the authors have not surprisingly run out of ink. All things considered this could be the perfect set up for a significant upside surprise if the stars come back into alignment. Should the FDA extend them an olive branch and if the secondary endpoints demonstrate statistical significance the return to $3 or higher could be swift. On the downside we're just $0.36 away from the absolute bottom. I like the risk/reward ratio, I think management has a fair chance of salvaging the Trilogy study, and I believe this could become the turnaround story that no one ever expected. Cheers!"
Soon back to $0.119 :)
I predict Acasti will be trading above $4.00 in September.Hold on to your shares.
idk how much more it will drop ?
"Purchase as much you can afford, big gains are in the works."
"I’ve been following this one for 3 years, lost a fair share. This gang is criminal !"
One year target price needs to be updated.
Let’s see….a 1 for 8 stock split puts this around $2.51/8 = $.3175. Not good.
"As a side note, MTNB IMO has a more favorable risk/reward profile than ACST.....Do your own DD....Best wishes to all."
"I have no idea what’s the stock is going to do, but if the company is not going bankrupt, then I am not selling."
"1/8 reverse split, already down premarket.feels like a double acst fisting to me"
I have plan to buy on every dip till the average of $1.50.Iam confident Stanley Morgan holding 179K. Future of company is bright may be shrare touch to $7-8 in 2022.
"It was good update but investors need more information. Still not catch an idea why they need separate TRILOGY 2 results release from release of pooled results from both TRILOGY studies and key secondary and exploratory endpoints from both TRILOGY 1 and TRILOGY 2 (within several weeks following the unblinding of TRILOGY 2 results). How they are going to pool both T1 and T2 together? I hope we will know it at the end of August conference. So, final countdown for Acasti future starts tomorrow Saturday August 1st. As Buffett said now it will be greed and fear time for all who want sell, hold or buy ACST. Stock market is already unstable and volatile, wise investors should continuously monitor their portfolios and sell everything to avoid big crash. But Acasti is different story - everybody see that funds/institutions sold practically all shares in Q1. It generated huge fear among weak hands and they sold all shares with huge losses. Now they burned and angry and trying to scare ACST holders and new buyers. Acasti can't explain well the ""rapid, significant and sustained reduction in TG levels between screening (during qualification) and the time of patient randomization (prior to patients starting on either drug or placebo), which Acasti refers to as “Pre-randomization Triglyceride (TG) Normalization.” This artefactual phenomenon affected both treatment groups, but was much greater in the placebo group, resulting in the large placebo effect and significant underestimation of the post-randomization treatment effect of the active drug, CaPre."" I'm sure that the main reason was switch to TLC diet among patients that never follow this diet. When you have both TLC diet and CaPre - CaPre will be main factor for TG decreasing. But in placebo arm the diet become main factor. My hypothesis is simple here: at these 5 sites doctors were very persuasive in terms of to make patients to switch to very restrictive TLC diet right after they knew their TG results. It was big mistake - TLC diet itself can decrease TG level by 20-30% during several weeks. All patients should start TLC diet simultaneously with trial start. Anyway, I hope T2 trial had less these ""persuasive investigators"". Also TLC diet will lead to significant changes in blood parameters i.e. it will be visible in key secondary and exploratory endpoints from both TRILOGY 1 and TRILOGY 2. Wise biotech investors should be ""fearful when others are greedy and greedy only when others are fearful""."
"Down 46% since the 1:8 split, and now a law suit.Where is the SEC?"
This #$%$ is going nowhere. Another two months they will be fighting delisting.This stock is worse covid.
how many folks here are going to keep on chanting great news in the morning?when was the last time we had any good news?going to the moon my #$%$
I need to get this at least to 6 to breal even lol. Worst stock i ever put money inside. Well i ll keep it a few years like it or not and wait to see results on the new drugs. Maybe climate will turn for small caps eventually
Happy to see this move. Hope we can pull AMRN up with us. I own both.Question for those with more experience. Can we exceed the prior 2.95 high on good news?
"As a side note..... MTNB is heading to approximately $50 to $150, depending on how many of MTNB's and their 6 big pharma LNC partner's 10-12 rare disease treatments move forward.Please join us on this exciting journey.Wishing everyone a lovely day :)"
They had some interesting insights about ACST on (http://Rightpicker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
I warned everybody here as much as I could all year. Hopefully some listened.
"When the split occurs, the price of the stock is adjusted to reflect the new number of shares outstanding. In the case of a reverse split, the price will increase, as now fewer shares are outstanding. When a forward split occurs, the share price will decrease because more shares are outstanding. While the stock price and number of shares you own change, the price is always altered by the split ratio, which means that the value of your holdings is not materially affected. You either own more shares at lower price or fewer shares at a higher price; the market capitalization -- the number of shares outstanding multiplied by the share price -- does not change."
"Corporate highlights:On track to report topline results for TRILOGY 1 in December 2019 and TRILOGY 2 in January 2020More than 90% of randomized patients have completed the studiesData clean-up for TRILOGY 1 is 95% completedPlan to present full data set including results for key secondary and exploratory endpoints of interest such asnon-HDL-C, LDL-C, VLDL, HDL-C and HbA1c at important scientific meetings beginning in the first quarter of2020Approximately $25.8 million of cash and cash equivalents as at September 30, 2019; fully funded beyondcompletion of Phase 3 studiesAwarded $750,000 in grants from the Government of CanadaPartnered with Aker BioMarine to provide supply of raw krill oil to support product launch andcommercializationJan D’Alvise, president and CEO of Acasti Pharma, commented, “We continue on track to announce our Phase 3TRILOGY 1 topline results in December 2019 and TRILOGY 2 topline results in January 2020. We eagerly await thecompletion of the results from our two TRILOGY clinical studies for a number of reasons, including: (a) the largepatient population in our Phase 2 trials (675 patients) demonstrated both a significant reduction of triglycerides andalso indicated that CaPre may have a positive effect on other major lipid markers such as VLDL, LDL-C, and HDL-C(“Trifecta Effect”), as well as HbA1c in patients with diabetes; (b) patients enrolled in our Phase 3 trials have higherbaseline triglyceride levels (above 500 mg/dl) versus our Phase 2 studies, where most had baseline triglyceridessignificantly below 500 mg/dl; and (c) a favorable dose response was reported in the Phase 2 studies, in whichpatients received a range of doses (1 gram, 2 grams and 4 grams per day for only 8 to 12 weeks), which we believebodes well for our Phase 3 trials, in which all patients randomized to CaPre received 4 grams per day and willremain on drug for 6 months.”“Assuming our TRILOGY trials replicate our Phase 2 data, we believe CaPre has the potential to become a best-inclass omega-3, due to both the Trifecta Effect and greater bioavailability, especially in patients that follow thestandard physician-recommended, restricted low-fat diet. We believe these benefits are due to our uniquecomposition of phospholipids, EPA and DHA as compared to ""esterified"" pharmaceutical omega-3s derived from fishoils. Additionally, in all studies conducted to date, CaPre has shown no negative side effects or safety concerns.”“We are also ramping up our commercialization efforts. Most recently, we announced a supply agreement with AkerBioMarine to provide raw krill oil (RKO) to Acasti, under a two-year, fixed price supply agreement, which we believewill ensure an adequate raw material supply to meet our anticipated needs through at least mid-2021, includingscale-up of production to build future inventory for anticipated commercial launch. At the same time, we are in activediscussions with a number of pharma companies regarding potential commercialization partnerships in severalcountries around the world, and we look forward to providing further updates if and when developments unfold.”Both TRILOGY trials have achieved 100% patient randomization and more than 90% of the patients have nowcompleted their 6-month plan. As a result, the “last patient, last visit” in the TRILOGY 1 study remains on track totake place in November with topline results expected in December 2019 and the “last patient, last visit” in theTRILOGY 2 study remains on track to take place in early January with topline results expected towards the end ofJanuary 2020. Topline results will include a readout of the primary endpoint, which is intended to show CaPre’soverall impact on lowering triglycerides (TGs) after 12 weeks compared to placebo. The TRILOGY studies aredesigned to provide at least 90% statistical power to detect a difference of at least a 20% reduction from baseline inTGs between CaPre and placebo. As previously disclosed, the placebo used in the TRILOGY trials is cornstarch,which is inert, and consequently is expected to have a neutral effect on key biomarkers of patients in the placebogroup, and has been shown to not interfere with statin absorption and efficacy.The Company has shared the statistical analysis plan (SAP) for the analysis and reporting of the TRILOGY resultswith the FDA and will finalize the SAP prior to final database lock of TRILOGY 1, which Acasti expects to occurshortly. Subject to any input from the FDA, Acasti currently intends to report topline TRILOGY results independentlyfor each study as Acasti receives results and these topline results will include the primary endpoint of TG reductionat Week 12 compared to placebo. Safety and tolerability (e.g. overall adverse events (AE) and serious AE rate, anydiscontinuation due to AEs, and AEs of special interest such as gastrointestinal events) will also be reported.The Company currently expects that topline results will not include a"
"everybody will be very surprised when see Q1, 2020 ownership for ACST. My prediction that institutions/funds will own at least 25-30% of ACST with average pps $0.7. They know that TRILOGY 2 results will be very good and Acasti will investigate the reason of anomalous placebo results in TRILOGY 1. At the end of February ACST pps might in $3-5 range and this small cap biotech will become acquisition target for Big Pharmas. It's good price for entry. STRONG BUY ALERT for ACST"
"Acasti Pharma Inc.'s (CVE:ACST) Shift From Loss To ProfitSimply Wall StThu, June 24, 2021, 3:22 AMWe feel now is a pretty good time to analyse Acasti Pharma Inc.'s (CVE:ACST) business as it appears the company may be on the cusp of a considerable accomplishment. Acasti Pharma Inc., a biopharmaceutical company, engages in the development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products for cardiovascular diseases. On 31 March 2021, the CA$135m market-cap company posted a loss of US$20m for its most recent financial year. The most pressing concern for investors is Acasti Pharma's path to profitability – when will it breakeven? Below we will provide a high-level summary of the industry analysts’ expectations for the company.View our latest analysis for Acasti PharmaConsensus from 2 of the Canadian Pharmaceuticals analysts is that Acasti Pharma is on the verge of breakeven. They expect the company to post a final loss in 2023, before turning a profit of US$161m in 2024. Therefore, the company is expected to breakeven roughly 3 years from now. What rate will the company have to grow year-on-year in order to breakeven on this date? Using a line of best fit, we calculated an average annual growth rate of 98%, which is rather optimistic! If this rate turns out to be too aggressive, the company may become profitable much later than analysts predict.earnings-per-share-growthearnings-per-share-growth"
"Did anybody approximate risk/reward for ACST entry price $0.8? In case if TRILOGY 2 failed ACST pps can drop 50% i.e. to $0.35 . However, if TRILOGY 2 is successful and Acasti found the reason for placebo anomaly in TRILOGY 1 current pps should jump at least 200-300% to $2.50-3 range (it's very modest value for Vascepa analogue). Thus, risk/reward is -50%/+300%. It's very rare situation in biotech investment. Especially if investors already know that CaPre is very effective for decreasing of TG. Well, statins are also effective but when you read side effects you will switch to Vascepa or CaPre. We have 10 days before D day for Acasti. Funds/institutions know that there is only one way to collect shares form weak hands - decrease pps each day at least 3-5%. Market makers that collected cheap shares during panic sell off help them to create ""never catch falling knife"" story for Acasti. JUST THINK"
"Have you noticed the carefully selected wording in the following statement from T1 PR?'Initial analyses suggest no protocol deviations in treatment allocation, capsule contents, laboratory quality control, or mismatched randomization that could explain these highly unusual placebo results.'They ruled out a lot of things, but not statins timing. There is not much else left in terms on hypothesis."
"NASDAQ has ACST institutional ownership at only 1%Smart money is avoiding the stock.....I wonder why ?Out of ACST and into MTNB ?MTNB has about 10-12 treatments, 6 top ten big pharma LNC partners, NIH and the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation funding 100% of MTNB's Rare Disease LNC Pipeline, and a cash runway till 2024Good luck"
they are really draining the market. sometime managent tries to make a company fail. this will go big or just shut down .
I am ruling out the TLC diet effect hypothesis for the TG reduction. TLC diet is in fact shown to slightly increase TG as per study link below.https://www.jlr.org/content/43/2/264.long#T1
Soon MTNB will be higher than ACSTPonder that
What was the last split ratio? 1:8 or 1:10? Can’t remember. Anyone?
"So we are looking at an 8-1 split.So if u bought 1,600 shares of ACST at $1.00, you will now own 200 shares of the new company and the cost to you is $8.00 per share. So the stick has to reach $8.00 to break even. Could be a long long wait, unless they come up with some miracle cure for something!"
"Why is Pfizer, Glaxo, Roche, Gilead, NIH and the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation funding 100% of MTNB's 10-12 LNC Rare Disease Treatments ? Because their LNC platform can take an approved IV treatment that is effective but highly toxic, and make it orally deliverable and significantly more efficacious and safer for patients.....In summary, does MTNB own a golden goose ?........Yes."
"Post-hoc analysis clearly showed that CaPre is very effective for high TG treatment:""The subgroup of subjects with Revised Baseline TG levels above 750 mg/dL at Visit 4 (Week 0) represented 41% of the subjects retained in the post-hoc analyses. Within this group, the median TG reduction in the subjects receiving CaPre was larger as would be expected, reaching 36.3% and 43.0% at Week 12 and Week 26, respectively. In comparison, the median TG reduction for the placebo group was 11.8% at Week 12 and 14.4% at Week 26, resulting in non-adjusted differences of 24.5% and 28.6% respectively in favor of CaPre (p = 0.22 and 0.15, respectively). ""About this phenomenon as “Pre-Randomization TG Normalization"" - most likely that many patients that knew their TG results changed their diets and started eat healthy food (less carbs, less saturated fats, more fish etc.). They had TG around 500 mg/dL and such diet changes helped them to drop TG. Secondary measures should help to clarify this phenomenon. I will hold and buy more ACST. CaPre will be approved by FDA as effective TG drug."
"OK, a new home. I live this play, going in big as the science and previous trials are really strong and it is not a classic Omega3 chemistry. I'm sure some old friends will find their way here. Cheers."

"Don't worry about fund's scepticism about Acasti - they just removed stocks with declining pps from portfolio to show good numbers. One thing is important here - Acasti management knows exactly why placebo arm showed such phenomenal results (TG drop was similar as patients were dosed with Vascepa) and sent all data to FDA. It's very rare situation when both treated arm and placebo one showed very good results. Usually treated arm results are just slightly higher than standard medicine (non-inferior) but placebo also show some positive trend. So, statistics analysis can't show big difference. In TRILOGY 1 trial starch pills showed results similar to Vascepa i.e. impossible in real life. It's 100% that some placebo patients got active compound(s) that can significantly decrease TG (statins or increased insulin dosage for diabetics). Acasti management understands that if such mistakes revealed many holders with losses will try to sue the company for their losses. But also they know that CaPre approval by FDA will increase ACST pps 300-400% in one day. Pps will become higher than before drop and longs who didn't sell will be happy. What the probability that FDA will allow to correct TRILOGY 1 and 2 results? If statins were reason for TG drop the probability of correction >90% (without additional Ph3). If the reason was increasing insulin dosage for diabetes patients during trial it's 100% that FDA will allow to remove them from analysis (see Exclusion criteria for Ph3). Less than 20 days and we will know the reason. HOLD and add more."

"Interesting. In talking to the company the 5 sites that skewed the data represented 35-40% of the patient population. The data from the other centers was fine. Also after 4 weeks the placebo showed no additional benefit while Capre kept improving the triglyceride number and separated itself further from placebo as time went on. Bottom line Capre worked, now the company has to figure out why these 5 sites [representing a 35-40% of the patient population] had these results. The good thing is that in Trilogy 2 these sites will only represent 5-10% of the patient population. As Yogi Berra once said ""it ain't over till it's over]"

I think the buy orders will be much more than the sell orders today
Wow! Its in the green in early trading!!!!
$3 today
i think its a game . this company jump from 2 to 4.5 in 2 days .what do you think of course they can go lower. and yes i also sold half of my stock before the spilt. i have been buying my lows. lol i wont let them win. they promised 2 dallors before the split . so that would be around 12 bucks. im waiting it out.
