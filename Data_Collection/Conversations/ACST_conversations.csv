"I have no idea what’s the stock is going to do, but if the company is not going bankrupt, then I am not selling."
"When the split occurs, the price of the stock is adjusted to reflect the new number of shares outstanding. In the case of a reverse split, the price will increase, as now fewer shares are outstanding. When a forward split occurs, the share price will decrease because more shares are outstanding. While the stock price and number of shares you own change, the price is always altered by the split ratio, which means that the value of your holdings is not materially affected. You either own more shares at lower price or fewer shares at a higher price; the market capitalization -- the number of shares outstanding multiplied by the share price -- does not change."
75M$ market cap?! Zero is where it’s going!
Every stock but a few are up today. Move on people. Buy steel or oil stocks.
And the woes continue daily!!!
"Actually the Grace Therapeutics is a valuable part of the ACST company. Encouraging results (second and third phase studies) are expected in the fourth quarter! Bullish Q4! Go Back to $7.00! We can do it, we can make it! :)"
excellent news
This company's Ceo should be in prison. This is company does not care for their stock holders or putting out anything that resembles a treatment for anything. This Ceo is smoke and mirrors.
Just needs 1 PR following merger that is drug specific and or patent look at INdP and what did today
"Down 46% since the 1:8 split, and now a law suit.Where is the SEC?"
"MTNB.... is a much stronger biopharma pony, given its robust, high-value rare disease LNC pipeline and plethora of A+ collaboration partners."
I was 70% in the red 28 days ago; today I am 74% in the red...I hope anyone investing here is warn with my message. Invest elsewhere! save yourself!
"65% in the red with this stock..well, I guess just hold until who knows when :("
how many feel this will go past 12 bucks?
i think its a game . this company jump from 2 to 4.5 in 2 days .what do you think of course they can go lower. and yes i also sold half of my stock before the spilt. i have been buying my lows. lol i wont let them win. they promised 2 dallors before the split . so that would be around 12 bucks. im waiting it out.
$3 today
"reality hurts, at the rate this seems to be dropping, by next week, $1.10- $.96"

"Rest in peace, my portfolio"

"As a side note..... MTNB is heading to approximately $50 to $150, depending on how many of MTNB's and their 6 big pharma LNC partner's 10-12 rare disease treatments move forward.Please join us on this exciting journey.Wishing everyone a lovely day :)"
Wow! Its in the green in early trading!!!!
Stay away from this #$%$
"Well..it was very likely this, but, we hope it bounce back sometime soon. on most price usually drop, but, not for long. although we were already in the red prior, but, the merge should kick back. Let's hope for the best."
"Great news in the morning, let's go to the moon....."
Mark this post seller going to cry in 1 week time frame !
I think the buy orders will be much more than the sell orders today
$9.76 high in February. Now a $1.74. Wow. Down $8? Good lord.
Back to $5.00 !
Why the revenue qt3 was good but stock still dropping too low ?
"Why is Pfizer, Glaxo, Roche, Gilead, NIH and the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation funding 100% of MTNB's 10-12 LNC Rare Disease Treatments ? Because their LNC platform can take an approved IV treatment that is effective but highly toxic, and make it orally deliverable and significantly more efficacious and safer for patients.....In summary, does MTNB own a golden goose ?........Yes."
thats what everyone wants.lol
sell your shares
Its a hard gamble .But i keep asking my self why they merged if the did see the company growing .stocks do take time and some people actually most people expect quick money .i think share holders will be very happy for the new year.
NOW! That is what i'm talking about. The big red machine is back going to under a 1.00. What a scam that I fell for.
The company has fature in my opinion but I don't like that they don't respect the share holders. But I believe in a long term the company will grow.
we double diped yesterday so im guessing today high roller.
im so glad i sold it at .65 few months ago with the loss of 20 percent loss in the trade
I did my best to warn everybody here. The only purpose this stock exists is to fleece shareholders...
