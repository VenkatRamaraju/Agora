"Second-quarter 2021 sales and revenues increased 29% to $12.9 billion● Second-quarter 2021 profit per share of $2.56; adjusted profit per share of $2.60Strong balance sheet; returned $0.8 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Total sales and revenues for the second quarter of 2021 were $12.889 billion, an increase of $2.892 billion, or 29%, compared with $9.997 billion in the second quarter of 2020. The increase was primarily due to higher sales volume driven by higher end-user demand for equipment and services and the impact from changes in dealer inventories. Dealers decreased inventories by $1.4 billion during the second quarter of 2020, compared with a decrease of $400 million during the second quarter of 2021. Favorable currency impacts were related to the Australian dollar, euro and Chinese yuan. Favorable price realization also contributed to the sales improvement. There will be a good dip to buy today."
Manipulation are you kidding I see equipment everywhere on projects there making plenty of cash.
Caterpillar earnings will be released Friday morning before the market opens.￼
did some valuation on my own. 212 is still undervalued.
big govt spending coming
Monday pop coming from infrastructure bill
"So if you look a the charts, this stock is tracking $CAT which is WRONG because its business is basically the same as $URI and $HRI. Will be corrected at some point."
I have held CAT longterm since 2016 added on lows and have huge increase with reinvest each quarter great dividend. we willing come back
"Let’s get a few things straight about caterpillar. Cat is a cyclical stock whose performance generally follows the overall economy, rising when the economy grows and dropping during declines. Cyclical stocks typically belong to industries dependent on discretionary spending such as Manufacturing and building ￼￼construction. Cat is considered a value stock. Typically value stocks are under priced based on fundamental analysis and often pay a relatively high dividend with a low PE.￼ On the other hand, growth stocks invest earnings back into corporate growth instead of paying a dividend and generally have a very high PE. So what is my point? If you are looking for action, caterpillar is a poor choice. If you are looking for value with a secure dividend and long term growth potential then CAT is a great choice in a balanced portfolio. ￼"
"Positive Earnings, Decent PE, good dividend. This is a buy… clearly."
DE getting a 17% divi increase. Both companies are champions and continue to grow in 2021. More spending is ready for 2022.
MANIPULATION here................................
Look up CX is a international cement company they are fair valued. Hedge funds have been buying quietly. You can thank me later.
Market forces have totally abandoned CAT and others….nobody wants them…period….msft raising prices 20%….they have pricing power. One main concern from CATs recent earning was the inflation and raw material cost….apparently they don’t have pricing powers…so the margin will be down….so was the stock….that’s what market is telling us.
"Why are the analysts saying buy and the fund managers selling ? Both are professionals in the same field, so you would think their views would be at least similar, not the polar opposite."
"With a large chunk of the trillion dollars going to roads and bridges being rebuilt, the orders will be coming in for CAT and other heavy eq. I'd say pile on the positions for this boom town."
"I thinking of buying CAT on Monday, reading your posts, I think you’re a pretty smart group.Elizabeth ‘s analysis is outstanding."
"Any day we have a $5/6 up, next few days the stock consolidates.... it has been a pattern....Except for Zacks, no other analyst defending these value/infrastructures plays. On the other hand, mega-cap techs are green even Nasdaq is red....Feel this market is disconnected"
"new highs and high volume. Smart money knows what's up. True, the house won't finish a bill this week or next, but they will get their members to sign off on infrastructure. Already up over this past week. Get in before it gets to high. My opinion of course. GLTA "
CAT 7 DAYS IN SRAIGHT DOWN WHY WHY WHY
2 days of gains in Msft produced a CAT or DE.
I have lost 13% in 3 months of holding this stock. I am still holding in the hope of infrastructure spending.
Thanks for the great dividend
"Worst management, no buyback, no PR with analyst community, it’s a disaster….no buyer….how can a solid company plunged $20 in 5 days after an infrastructure bill???? Where are the so-called Buffet and other value investors???"
"Who’s ready for some gains? Earnings coming tomorrow, we’re looking good!"
"This Administration is revealing their Total and Complete INCOMPETENCY in dealing with Foreign Policy, the Border, and the Economy. There is little doubt that the Stock Market WILL be taking heavy hit soon.....very, very soon. Sell and buy back after the hit. You're forewarned!"
"Ask yourself what has changed? We knew we will have an infrastructure bill 3 months or so ago.....Some people in this board said that's all priced in....Funds and institutions were chasing Tech. Softbank day traded tech stocks and recently dumped all of them. Everything was going up..DOW...NASDAQ, S&P except a few infrastructure stocks...Wasnt that crazy?? That was all set up by Wall street firms....CAT should be $300 based on $12 EPS and 50B revenue. What you see today is some funds realization and relocation of money into value.....other than that the fundamental has not changed."
"When it was $220+. I knew it will drop. But I didn't sell, because if I sold then I will have to buy back at some point. Instead I kept and buying more when it dropped. Keep CAT long term you will be Ok"
"Well, the stock is getting spanked but the company remains strong. There is clear support around, emphasis on *around* $200. Sometimes there are stops right at or below key support levels so allow for the stock to break $200 intraday. My thought is that the stock has retreated from its all time high so this drop is probably washing out the rest of those with weak conviction on a great company and industry leader. There is a name for this action and it is called capitulation which generally is a set up for a point to enter or add."
I was hoping for NUE like bump this week to 230 area…it’s been manipulated for a long long time by hedgies with their false narrative. CAT is a multi year play that would greatly benefit from this infrastructure spending. Just don’t believe what the market of funds tell you….
"l work for CAT, 30 years now. The company is not the problem. Solid company and getting stronger."
"these are tough times for company evaluations. Many (especially new) investors are easily spooked. Add inflation and the possibility of more variants and talks about more masks and lockdowns and its understandable. However, even with things like this we know there is likely going to be a 1 trillion ""infrastructure "" bill passed. Even if only 1 in 3 dollars goes to construction that is a lot of money. Caterpillar is the company that will be selling and leasing out the heavy equipment. This may drop more before the bill passes. Who knows, but if it drops below $196 I'm loading up. Even if I only hold some for short-term it's easy money and the rest will be free shares for the longterm. Each to his/her own. Best of luck to everyone. "
Has CAT ever been this volatile. Down 40 points from its 52 week high in three days. Up 20 overnight on infrastructure passage in the senate. Back down 25 in two days because of a taper that has been telegraphed to the market for 6 months. I should have gone with DE when I was considering which one to invest in.
CAT will receive direct and indirect policy benefits over the next five years.
$CAT $WIMI $GE if you guys are waiting for tomorrow to add more at lower price Iwould encourage adding today.
Good buy if infrastructure passes the house. The house said it will pass it only if they agree to add on the 3 trillion human infrastructure bill.
There is a slide from Sanjay Shrestha saying “Push to Eliminate Diesel!!!Stationary Backup TAM increased to $37 Billion!!!Microsoft dragging their feet on Stationary???$PLUG Power is on the Planet for the “PUSH TO ELIMINATE DIESEL!!!” What are you waiting for Bill of $MSFT??? $PCAR $DE $CAT??? Add up the market caps for all the Buggy Whip diesel on the planet and REPLACE THAT WITH GREEN HYDROGEN PLUG POWER
calls and shares are up going to be another good day tomorow
1 trillion on infrastructure passed the senate. Now on to the house! Just bought more
Infrastructure should lift CAT to over $275 per share.
