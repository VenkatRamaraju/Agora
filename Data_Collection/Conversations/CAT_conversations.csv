$CAT $WIMI $GE if you guys are waiting for tomorrow to add more at lower price Iwould encourage adding today.
It's going to the moon 
"From Simply Wall Street:What's the opportunity in Caterpillar?Great news for investors – Caterpillar is still trading at a fairly cheap price. According to my valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $185.35, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. However, given that Caterpillar’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility."
"3 days ago, market participants and fear mongers were spreading delta variant fears to buy cheap shares...Another dude Guggenheim's Minerd saying 10-15% correction.....Everyday they change their narratives....."
The Market looks weak....CAT looks weaker.....I think there's more downside. Not worth going in for the $1 dividend. I'm just going to stick with my $202 first bite Buy order.
Delta…delta … and inflation controls the markets for now.
That’s what I feared…CAT was down when DOW was up…..red flag….A 5 or 10% correction will take it to $180….f…it
Look for the big Dip before buying
Still waiting for it to hit my $202 Buy order!! Looks like it won't be long now. That'll be my 1st bite.
Down over $23 a share in 5 days! Why aren’t people backing up the truck and loading up??
"Well, the stock is getting spanked but the company remains strong. There is clear support around, emphasis on *around* $200. Sometimes there are stops right at or below key support levels so allow for the stock to break $200 intraday. My thought is that the stock has retreated from its all time high so this drop is probably washing out the rest of those with weak conviction on a great company and industry leader. There is a name for this action and it is called capitulation which generally is a set up for a point to enter or add."
"This CAT has no more upside, its ALL priced in now.me SELL on news."
Earning surprise????
"DOW is near all time high & CAT is at 214, all time high was 246. How come this stock has not kept up with the DOW price and CAT is included in the DOW ?????????????????"
$220 call on Monday so relax guys have a nice weekend
"Well, I added a bit today at 223.77 to make my average cost 228.40 since my initial purchase yesterday. Bought a bit early, but I believe it will be profitable in the not too distant future."
240 to 210 in 8 trading days on improving fundamentsUnreal
hold long stay strong
"This Administration has made HUGE, HUGE mistakes in Foreign policy, on the Border, and on the Economy.....and the mistakes are continuing on a daily basis. This will WITHOUT A DOUBT negatively impact the overall Stock Market. I have NO Buy orders in on CAT....neither should you. Good Luck all!"
Omg...Dows recovery is not affecting Cat...whatsoever....just hope funds are shorting Cat....that's what I want.
Setting purchase orders in installments. 1st order in at $201.
I called $220 by this week :) we going to the promise land people
The price tumble and the dividend increase have pushed this stock's dividend yield to slightly over 2%
I’m buying more if it goes under $200 this is a gem core holding.
Looks like ALL this infrastructure is priced in !
"Companies like Target buying back 15B when the stock is 52 weeks high, wth CAT not buying back?? If they are so convinced about infrastructure spending, the stock is dirt cheap at this level"
"Let’s get a few things straight about caterpillar. Cat is a cyclical stock whose performance generally follows the overall economy, rising when the economy grows and dropping during declines. Cyclical stocks typically belong to industries dependent on discretionary spending such as Manufacturing and building ￼￼construction. Cat is considered a value stock. Typically value stocks are under priced based on fundamental analysis and often pay a relatively high dividend with a low PE.￼ On the other hand, growth stocks invest earnings back into corporate growth instead of paying a dividend and generally have a very high PE. So what is my point? If you are looking for action, caterpillar is a poor choice. If you are looking for value with a secure dividend and long term growth potential then CAT is a great choice in a balanced portfolio. ￼"
When they announce stock split ???
Uncertainty in the infrastructure bill is keeping this down imo. This will be resolved and this is a buying opportunity
"Does this become a case of CAT 2018/2019 bearish trend? It could be a long while to see the bottom, or do we see an immediate move back to the bullish side? Seems probable that it would try to find the 200 MA before another big uptrend"
"Down $2 pre market, I hope it isn’t going to be bad news later ."
load up!
"Not a normal trading day for CAT.....paltry buying at $214 level.....selling at $218-219 area....like rangebound....Not consistent with DOW....As soon as market opens, someone dumps few hundred thousand shares everyday......like a norm.....I don't mind CAT down on days when DOW is down....but why down when DOW is up??? That's why i said something is not right...."
"Seems like funds day by day increasing tech exposure by reducing value holdings. 8 weeks and it continues everyday…..we used to have $10 up days in CAT and now, no guarantee it will be green when DOW is up 1%….sad"
I am speechless 
Cat had a shareholder meeting. Someone not happy and dumped millions of shares yesterday and today. Cat should initiate Costco like one time dividend. But I was surprised to see $9 down and no support whatsoever from MM.
Cat RSI was 23.58 on 06/15 @219.46...extremely oversold. We need one day up...big one.

"CAT stagnant this whole week while DOW has gained. In other words, DOW is only 400 points away from 52 weeks high while CAT is 15% off.What could jumpstart CAT:Raise current and full year forecast10B buybackInvestors dayI know nothing like this is going to happen. It feels like hedge funds and money managers are too busy with their tech holdings and do not have time for infrastructure plays. But how long they can ignore??? That’s the real question. You can keep chasing NVDA to 1000/1200, then what??? Back to undervalued stock like CAT. They control everything…what will go up and what will go down…and for how long….everything. We just need to be lucky…I’m sad man"
Down nearly 20% from its 52W high. What am I not seeing?
"Just thoughts:Shouldn’t there be a restriction how many shares a fund/ institution can buy or sell in a quarter? How come this is not an antitrust issue? Vanguard owns close 40 mil shares. That’s close to 10% and 10 days worth of trading if they want to sell them. How come there are no rules for the boys? Price goes up or down, they always win coz they have money, more money to buy a beaten stock. Retails like us always lose…always…."
I have lost 13% in 3 months of holding this stock. I am still holding in the hope of infrastructure spending.
Has CAT ever been this volatile. Down 40 points from its 52 week high in three days. Up 20 overnight on infrastructure passage in the senate. Back down 25 in two days because of a taper that has been telegraphed to the market for 6 months. I should have gone with DE when I was considering which one to invest in.
loaded up more on 210's bounced off here last dip
Was able to get into CAT at these levels. Have been waiting for months for this opportunity!
CAT will receive direct and indirect policy benefits over the next five years.
"230""s soon"
"Senate advances bipartisan infrastructure bill in procedural votePUBLISHED FRI, JUL 30 202110:07 AM EDT"
Just bought in AH hopefully this will help me I’ve lost 2k on Apple today pump dump
buy while its still cheap!
I think CAT should focus on self driving trucks for mining industry
Infrastructure should be a good time to buy in.
"Still in desperate search of a bottom, WAY to much selling volume yesterday to consider it done. Although, I hope I am wrong and looking for a move back to the upside SOON."
"When it was $220+. I knew it will drop. But I didn't sell, because if I sold then I will have to buy back at some point. Instead I kept and buying more when it dropped. Keep CAT long term you will be Ok"
$18 down in just 5 days!!! We have tech stocks hitting 52 weeks high everyday on red market while these so. Called value(or junk) stocks are red even when Dow is up. Look at NVDA…..that tells you how crazy the market is and funds are
Extremely overdone imo
Congratulations to those who followed my advise and selling this at 230.
"now is the time to add to your position. When the infrastructure bill is passed (in some form), who do you think we be supplying much of the large earth moving equipment!"
4 months of gain gone in 10 trading daysEconomy and profit stronger than everTalk about rigged market!
fire sale again good day to load some more
My $201 purchase order should fill sooner than I expected.....and this is just the beginning of the long-awaited market correction.
What's the problem now?
Eddie Lohr Jr. increasing his position in CAT(source Ed Lohr Jr.).
Well. I love CAT. buying more in dip
Only Zacks is supporting Cat…no other analysts backing or upgrading…that’s strange!!! Deere and other industrials are handsomely recovering except Cat….need a 10B buyback NOW
Totally crazy drop on all good news
Just Bought.
I have puts at 200 for next Friday. The chart is looking very weak. Possible extreme downside of 164 in the next month. That would be worst case.
Good luck to the sellers! 120B market cap only with 40B+ 2020 pandemic sales and $4B profit. Cheapest monopoly I can think of. The selling looks desperate. I strongly believe it all started from the shareholders meeting
Can we get past $221 lol
Had Cat for many years and quadrupled my $. Sold @ $119 and bought a higher paying dividend stock for better payouts! It's been a good ride. Thanks Cat but retirement said sell!!
"Any day we have a $5/6 up, next few days the stock consolidates.... it has been a pattern....Except for Zacks, no other analyst defending these value/infrastructures plays. On the other hand, mega-cap techs are green even Nasdaq is red....Feel this market is disconnected"
Whales brought the price down cause they knew this deal was in the pipeline - long CAT !
why cat drop so much? there is a big construction project whole country
What’s different today from yesterday? Why is it selling off ?
Retest of $208 coming.
big govt spending coming
No upgradeNo buybackGod knows what’s ahead.I have been praying for CAT to go back up over 220-225. I am ok with sideway trading until earning
was going to buy yesterday but had the death cross on the chart
bought a few more
I have held CAT longterm since 2016 added on lows and have huge increase with reinvest each quarter great dividend. we willing come back
excited for a good friday payday!
"Zacks news For what its worthCaterpillar Inc. CAT is the largest global manufacturer of construction and mining equipment. Given that it serves a gamut of sectors — infrastructure, construction, mining, oil & gas, and transportation — the company is considered a bellwether of the global economy.The company’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 46.3%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 18.4% over the past 60 days. The company carries a Zacks Rank #2."
"Dan Niles who is a very sharp portfolio manager for his hedge fund, Satori was a guest on Maria Bartiromo’s show on Friday. He mentioned he is taking positions and Caterpillar￼, Deere and Freeport-McMoran.￼￼"
Market forces have totally abandoned CAT and others….nobody wants them…period….msft raising prices 20%….they have pricing power. One main concern from CATs recent earning was the inflation and raw material cost….apparently they don’t have pricing powers…so the margin will be down….so was the stock….that’s what market is telling us.
"So if you look a the charts, this stock is tracking $CAT which is WRONG because its business is basically the same as $URI and $HRI. Will be corrected at some point."
@Michael Afraid of your own shadow and words in a post!! LOL
"With a large chunk of the trillion dollars going to roads and bridges being rebuilt, the orders will be coming in for CAT and other heavy eq. I'd say pile on the positions for this boom town."
Added at $215.40
Let's be honest here. CAT is overpriced - period. It has a 35+ PE. That's tech or consumer packaged goods level. Be happy with the decent dividend. I am in heavily at $72 per share so I am not unhappy.
"Folks, some of you are worried about high PE. Obviously, you are being misled by yahoo. Cats 2020 EPS was 6.25. This is year 2021 and their estimate is $11. What’s the PE then???? How about 2022 PE?"
DE getting a 17% divi increase. Both companies are champions and continue to grow in 2021. More spending is ready for 2022.
Price correction on no news. An investors dream.
"manipulation , end of month SALE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Any other President and this stock soars! JB thinks gender transformation is considered infrastructure. Oh my!

2 days of gains in Msft produced a CAT or DE.

Conservatives Hold Fast! No infrastructure bill of any kind until after the 2022 elections! Do not succumb to Dem EXTORSION!
Will probably run to 230 240 soon
Money is flowing into stocks that will get a huge boost from the coming huge infrastructure spending that will come out of every country around the world to get the economic engine going again
$CAT down 10% in the last 6 days! Recovery trade is collapsing.
"Caterpillar may move up and down however I am not moved from my commitment to this incredible company. I will look forward to February 20 when dividends are reinvested at a low price. The company is also paying me over 3% rent to be in my portfolio. ￼Earnings reported this Friday before the bell￼,"
"Worst management, no buyback, no PR with analyst community, it’s a disaster….no buyer….how can a solid company plunged $20 in 5 days after an infrastructure bill???? Where are the so-called Buffet and other value investors???"
Buyer199.00
"Hey Briben & Dems, UP YOURS! We’ll wait until the good guys are back in power!"
DE is also dropping. And the dow. This drop is not related to CAT.
Seems like volume is tapering off a bit from previous days. Hopefully that means most of the selling is done.
Infrastructure is THE word that matters.
Buy under 220 bargain priceNext week over 230 againRed days are over
MANIPULATION here................................
"Andrew Bonfield CFO, “material costs are not the problem, it’s incentive compensation”! Are you serious??!! Why does he still have a job???"
"I never thought CAT would be this worse…..underperforming against all metric and index….once it hits $218, sellers hit sell button….same pattern last 6 weeks. The company is not doing any buyback….no upgrades….I don’t see any hope…"
Look up CX is a international cement company they are fair valued. Hedge funds have been buying quietly. You can thank me later.
16% drop since June 4th----Disaster. Long time to make up for that.

"Caterpillar CAT-NYSE Overweight Price $147.19 on Dec. 20 by J.P. Morgan We believe that Caterpillar’s earning power and free-cash-flow conversion over this prolonged cycle continue to merit our Overweight rating. The company has been able to cut fixed costs by restructuring its Resource business, which should provide earnings upside on improving volumes in what we expect to be a multiyear up-cycle in mining. In addition, we remain bullish on U.S. public construction spending, as state and local contract awards for highways and bridges continue to support infrastructure spending.We are raising our December 2020 price target to $178 (from $155), which reflects a 16 times multiple on our 2020 adjusted EPS estimate. We are adding Caterpillar to our Analyst Focus List"
Warren buffet sezWhen everone is scared be greedy But everyone is greedy be scared..Looks like a lot of greedy investors to me..Do you disagree ?
watching the dumping....probably the worst of all stocks....investors treating CAT like a garbage.
wow no love for Caterpillar
I like infrastructure. I like America. I like Caterpillar. Jump'in in this investment headfirst this week.
In at $200…patience
"Well, I thought I was finished building my position in CAT but this set up was just too good. I added shares at 228.42￼"
Bill may not pass house in current form. Needs more time and lots of work.
I like the stock! When there’s blood on the street that’s when we buy.
197.00-199.00Start some buying
"Positive Earnings, Decent PE, good dividend. This is a buy… clearly."
I like this company.
"Good news from Peru to keep buying CAT products for its mining production.: Expect 250 this week:""LIMA, June 26 (Reuters) - Peru's socialist presidential candidate Pedro Castillo said on Saturday he wanted to keep on the head of the central bank Julio Velarde if he was confirmed the winner of a June 6 election as expected, an important signal of stability for markets.In a speech to supporters he said he hoped that Velarde's work would remain ""permanent"" to help give ""peace of mind economically"" and open the door for investment in the world's no. 2 copper producer.Castillo, a wild card candidate, has rattled Peru's political establishment, markets and mining firms with plans to redraft the constitution and redistribute mining wealth, though has looked to soften his rhetoric in recent weeks.""Our commitment is to maintain a fiscal balance and improve the quality of public spending, promote investments and respect the independence and autonomy of the BCRP (central bank),"" he said in a post on Twitter shortly after his speech. """
Sold. I don't think that the infrastructure deal is going to happen anytime soon. I may repurchase in a couple of months.
Someone just dumped 50k shares afterhours in the last 20 minutes before closing....CAT needs to be exorcised....so much jinxed....
I am starting to believe this is a deliberate drop by the funds/institutions to buy cheaper shares ahead of the no-brainer infrastructure bill
Is there a website to check real time shorted shares on Cat??
Bought another 1000 shares at this price!
There are some garbage posters here…what are they doing on CAT board??
"CEO goes on Mad Money and gives an excellent interview about CAT's business prospects, confirms they will meet or exceed earnings, minimizes the significance of China tariffs as China is only 5-10% of sales. Then the next morning Atlantic Equities comes out with a downgrade on ""slower global activity"". Gotta love this investing game."
That was quick. I'm out. Will enter a Buy order later. Probably around $201
YES  UP WE GO.
Volume is increasing Big fish is coming
"these are tough times for company evaluations. Many (especially new) investors are easily spooked. Add inflation and the possibility of more variants and talks about more masks and lockdowns and its understandable. However, even with things like this we know there is likely going to be a 1 trillion ""infrastructure "" bill passed. Even if only 1 in 3 dollars goes to construction that is a lot of money. Caterpillar is the company that will be selling and leasing out the heavy equipment. This may drop more before the bill passes. Who knows, but if it drops below $196 I'm loading up. Even if I only hold some for short-term it's easy money and the rest will be free shares for the longterm. Each to his/her own. Best of luck to everyone. "
Some ride down in such a short time from 240 to under 208 today. Unbelievable as it may be the point and figure guys have a target around 160 to 170. Even if it never gets there provided our government gets its act together and passes an infrastructure bill there are numerous trades that can be engaged to play the swings without using your own money.....I am
"Great buying opportunity, in my opinion! It can only go up!"
WeGe board is tilting out. Keeps giving message stop asking about CAT we dont know why its going down.Anyone got a smarter WeGe board
Monday pop coming from infrastructure bill
There is a slide from Sanjay Shrestha saying “Push to Eliminate Diesel!!!Stationary Backup TAM increased to $37 Billion!!!Microsoft dragging their feet on Stationary???$PLUG Power is on the Planet for the “PUSH TO ELIMINATE DIESEL!!!” What are you waiting for Bill of $MSFT??? $PCAR $DE $CAT??? Add up the market caps for all the Buggy Whip diesel on the planet and REPLACE THAT WITH GREEN HYDROGEN PLUG POWER
230+ by Friday
"This should be a billion dollar stock, given the trillions of dollars for infrastructure. Oh wait.....(sigh)"
Is it Yahoo or just some fearful lefty that is afraid of words in a post???
It’s a shame the company is not defending against this reckless selling. Where is the buyback? Down $25 in just 4 days for no reason. Never thought this can happen to a stock like Cat 
"with the infrastructure spending and CAT new business model I feel this company will grow well in coming months and years. However I can't guess what could be the price in 6 months, a year or longer than that."
"last 10 days or so, funds and institutions are piling on tech and selling industrials and financials favoring growth vs value. This same f...rs will turn back to value again. its a back and forth game they are playing just because they can due to their size. with a 2021 EPS of $11, Cat should be over 300."
"Like everyone on this page, I am trying to figure out why this is selling off. Must be a sell the news on the infrastructure bill by institutions. Wondering how much more downside we are looking at here. I like 218. But, at the same time, I have no idea why this is dropping like a brick. Can somebody enlighten me?"
"Last time, we had a $10-12 down day and the bottom was $218 and it pared 70% of the losses by the close. $220 is a steal and let’s load the truck."
"Kind if surprised this stud stock is getting sold off (per RSI) like it is. I'm starting a new position here today. Shares, and some July 30 calls."
"Remember.....this is how the game is played. It the big investment firms are going to get into this stock they need to drive it LOWER, so they can use options, hedges, etc......to make money for their clients. Hey......that's what they do. The small investor that panics when they are down $2 on positive news is the one that loses. Just hang in there and don't try to trade it.....invest instead."
Infrastructure should lift CAT to over $275 per share.
"sadly surprised, hope it will bounce back soon"
It seems like Washington’s infrastructure tantrum on not signing without a second reconciliation bill is weighing on infrastructure stocks….so sad.
8 years infrastructure budget
"So much pain to stay invested in best companies in America.....funds chasing growth and dumping the values.....very soon.....midcap will start from 100B as large cap shifting toward 500B. Analysts are changing narrative by every hours....Moron Cramer one day says buy DIDI but next day say STAY AWAY......I dont know how these valued stocks will fare a market downturn.....FAANGs can afford a 10% correction as all techs have gone up 15-20% in June only....So far, CAT is down $4.50 this week....looking for some hope aka Infrastructures bills and blowout earnings. we will see..."
"Why is CAT doing so good ? Because its a #$%$ nice company based on growth, profitability, and extra gift, they even give you divs.... What can you ask more ? This is pure gold."
came back into positive today an up week
Fed effect todayDon't worry about redGreat buying opportunity
Big come back this am get on board this train
wow don't post often but CAT and HD pulled my entire portfolio into the red rough monthholding long and strong
I just put in a Sell order at $206.25 for the entire batch I bought yesterday at $202. Going to make some very quick $$$ on this deadcat bounce as I believe this is headed to sub $200.
The much needed infrastructure bill will pass soon and CAT will pop back up
Best predicted 250 for summer 2018. Never forget that
"what happened to everybody saying 215 was the bottom. haha, im shorting this heavy right now. I have 150 puts for 2022"
Very strange
What's going on???????
Why crushed ? Because all the market ?
Hahaha. This is amazing. The CAT that does not bounce.
"Bought 200 more shares today.Added to my SKIN, position too."
load up the truck!!!
All aboard to 245 station
Everyone should start buying up. SI% reflects the price point. Buy up shares and hedge with a LONG calls. Sell shares after EX dat and then close LONG after earnings report. But i dont know tho - Kanye West
Cat will be at $325 as soon as the Dems are out of the way!
Have we got support at $210?
I was hoping for NUE like bump this week to 230 area…it’s been manipulated for a long long time by hedgies with their false narrative. CAT is a multi year play that would greatly benefit from this infrastructure spending. Just don’t believe what the market of funds tell you….
i wanna see 240 by next week
Traders nicely dumping all day.....$211.6-$212 range...just curious what are they buying? Tech is already very expensive....seems like Infrastructures bill or whatever we were excited about....is not a game changer even if it happens....only GOD can save us at this point.
Just placed my 2nd Buy order in at $198. Bite #2.
"Infrastructure bill coming soon , watch CAT !"
fun to see the high volume with market chasers rushing in if you hold add at dips and reinvest dividends your in the green
Will enter at $202
good stock with some potential uptrend due to baiden policy. just donot like the current trading volume.
Back and forth shifts from tech to industrials and vice versa. Getting in on CAT tomorrow
Buying Opportunity!
I am adding more CAT shares with good outlook for rest of the year. Analyst upgrades will also come.
End of month SELL OFFtaking advantage of dips here CAT will bounce as congress approval for infrastructure materializes.
25 PE and will buy more. Right now 33 PE is still expensive considering we may have a slow down.
Caterpillar will surprise just like Nike…watch it
"$CAT $DECommodities sold off sharply shouldn't that help commodity users like CAT, DE to help reduce their input cost?"
@Elizabeth C were we as long time cat position holders supposed to have been able to predict such a drop in stock? I have to admit my mind is in a bit of a fog right now.
Best management team in the sector!! Thanks for making a long a lot of money over the years! Now let's up that dividend!!
all I can say is outstanding
adding more shares to portfolio
And I'm not even a shareholder.
"The only near term catalyst for this market is Infrastructure bill. Until then, market (DOW) is going to trade sideways. Industrials like Cat may experience more pain. As a shareholder, its painful but not selling a single share."
outstanding day coming back
"l work for CAT, 30 years now. The company is not the problem. Solid company and getting stronger."
"As I posted previously, I have a Buy order in at $202 for my 1st bite.....but I must admit, I'm tempted to go in and get some today just for the Divy........thinking......"
CAT seems to be rising in conjunction with the Dow ???So if Dow low is in and rising then Cat should follow???
These could be the biggest beneficiaries of the infrastructure bill ... cat!!
"The big question is, did it hit bottom yet ?"
"the price is jumping. The hedgies trying to short, but the floor is the floor."
"No sense to the down ward trend, total crazinessWhat has changed? Nothing. Didn't they just report good earning and raise the divNo news of any projects not continuing. So same old same O business that just reported good earnings So why a 12% drop when all good??? news??"
Caterpillar earnings will be released Friday morning before the market opens.￼
Anyone else disappointed in the way this has been trading? Or just me?
Not as much momentum as $DE
"Who’s ready for some gains? Earnings coming tomorrow, we’re looking good!"
Buy on regression - the left will do infrastructure and that in turn will yield substantial wealth across classes and mostly pay for itself. The far right clown car has run into the wall of truth and Cheney and Kinsinger should be saluted. Boolean
high volume buyers are back after overselling these last couple of weeks positive gains will continue be long
"new highs and high volume. Smart money knows what's up. True, the house won't finish a bill this week or next, but they will get their members to sign off on infrastructure. Already up over this past week. Get in before it gets to high. My opinion of course. GLTA "
"Bears are partying....let them.Friday DOW up, CAT downMonday DOW down, CAT down slightlyTuesday DOW up, CAT downMarket seems pessimistic about CAT and all other value plays.....Do I feel frustrated? YES....But I also believe this trend will reverse. The only thing I fret is moron politicians can not even give us a simple infrastructures.....I am not sure we will have one by July 4th as promised."

"Second-quarter 2021 sales and revenues increased 29% to $12.9 billion● Second-quarter 2021 profit per share of $2.56; adjusted profit per share of $2.60Strong balance sheet; returned $0.8 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Total sales and revenues for the second quarter of 2021 were $12.889 billion, an increase of $2.892 billion, or 29%, compared with $9.997 billion in the second quarter of 2020. The increase was primarily due to higher sales volume driven by higher end-user demand for equipment and services and the impact from changes in dealer inventories. Dealers decreased inventories by $1.4 billion during the second quarter of 2020, compared with a decrease of $400 million during the second quarter of 2021. Favorable currency impacts were related to the Australian dollar, euro and Chinese yuan. Favorable price realization also contributed to the sales improvement. There will be a good dip to buy today."
I now think it is due to slightly disappointing housing sales data this week. Home builder stocks and building material stocks like OC didn't act well this week.

"I love the hatred from Wall Street for CAT, DE and other value stocks.....Keep chasing Tech.....I also love tech but there is a severe imbalance now between valuation of iconic American companies and the so-called growth stocks with nose bleeding PEs.....one having hard time crossing 200B and others approaching Trillion....CAT's 2021 EPS is $12....with infrastructures for next 5 years....I believe the EPS can hit $20 by 2025.....what stock price do you envision for 2025?"
"I'm in CAT!!!! Got my 1st bite at $202. I buy in ""bites"". That is my first and I try to max out at 5. Next ""bite"" will be somewhere below $200. I'll need to figure out at the specific amount, but my recollection is that it would be in the area of $198."
Thanks for the great dividend
Been waiting for quite a while to get into CAT. I think today was a great opportunity. I work in construction myself and I dont see how this stock cant keep growing. GLTA
Why CAT management waiting and not initiating a buyback? $208 was the bottom. China will be a strong segment in the upcoming quarter…we fly from here…Friday traders always play games…with options…nothing to worry
Looks like we’ve hit support we’re going up from here!
Stocks go down folks.... yet cat is set for a rebound
Infrastructure Bill. I will believe when I see it.
Down 10% in 5 days. Surprised this isn't getting any attention in the press. Have yet to see CNBC mention it.
"Delta is so massively overhyped it is ridiculous. Yes there are infections, even some breakthrough infections. But deaths are mostly confined to the unvaccinated or the elderly. In Oregon, median age for death (when vaccinated) is 83. By the way, that's above the US life expectancy."
"Not a bad idea to buy some here, start a 1/3 position."
"With RSI below 20, how long do you think MM can push CAT down? As a shareholder, I am in pain, no doubt. But I also have strong faith buyers will be flocking in soon. You lose only when you sell them. With strong fundamentals and infrastructure spending from US China and EU, Cat is one of the top 5 beneficiaries. Any day, we will see 4-5% up day...Friday or Monday only GOD knows.. Stay long stay strong."
"I thinking of buying CAT on Monday, reading your posts, I think you’re a pretty smart group.Elizabeth ‘s analysis is outstanding."
"Matthew Cabot, calling for a break out at $225."
did some valuation on my own. 212 is still undervalued.
"purchased 60 shares at 112, seems like a really good opportunity for everyone. I'll have to keep buying more if it stays or dips."
some buyers are back
This is the 1st time in a year CAT has been under the 100 MA. Look for a rebound back to $230 levels soon.
6 month next support 218
Is it enough ?
the whole market is red. If we drop below $195 I'm loading up. Construction will not stop and a infrastructure bill is ahead.
"Ask yourself what has changed? We knew we will have an infrastructure bill 3 months or so ago.....Some people in this board said that's all priced in....Funds and institutions were chasing Tech. Softbank day traded tech stocks and recently dumped all of them. Everything was going up..DOW...NASDAQ, S&P except a few infrastructure stocks...Wasnt that crazy?? That was all set up by Wall street firms....CAT should be $300 based on $12 EPS and 50B revenue. What you see today is some funds realization and relocation of money into value.....other than that the fundamental has not changed."
"Seems like Fed changed its tone already. So, they were checking market reaction?? Or Bullard helped his hedgie friends??"
"Paper hands going to be crying on Monday when we start to rally back up. CAT is no joke, don’t ever bet against America "
"Caterpillar CEO, why aren’t you buying Generac!?!?! It would fill in your below 50 KW size for backup power generation! Their strategy of product & proactive service fits well with Cats!"
why is theres o much spam on the CAT message board?
Economy is so well ... !!!
Why ? Run is over ?
Classic....PT raised so the powers that be drop the bid to snap up cheaper shares before the rise.
not a prediction but it would be nice to see this flip into the green going into close
Not sure what the complaint is. CAT outperformed (+51%) the S&P (+36%) over the last 12 months.
You see how $4 gains evaporated in just 3 hrs? Paid bashers on news outlets already warning about meltdown in Aug and Sept….and then we have the moron funds selling CAT as soon as it hits green….pathetic!!!
Let’s spend all afternoon slowly bring the price up just for 10 minutiae to lose all progress
3.30 and we are turning back up
Entry point. Go long with CAT
I hope the bleeding has stopped!
"The bill that passed the Senate yesterday means nothing. That was just the media giving our president a pat on the back. It will be months if at all, but his bill will actually help cat"
Equipment borrowing for June is up 17%. This is great news for earnings this week. let's see what happens!
Bill passed !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!off to the races.
Seriously? We are talking Rodney Dangerfield here!
calls and shares are up going to be another good day tomorow
"Why are the analysts saying buy and the fund managers selling ? Both are professionals in the same field, so you would think their views would be at least similar, not the polar opposite."
"Cost control is still a problem and even with a ""potential"" EPS of $10/share $220 seems fair value. This is not a high tech stock plus the famous infrastructure bill is not a fully given. Was in the Midwest last week and saw plenty of equipment from different manufacturers just sitting idle. I could care. I am in for lots of CAT at $75."
Wall Street treated AAPL the same way 6 months ago…..if you all recall….nothing wrong with fundamentals just that’s how they make the narratives each time to reap profits.
"Reminiscing those days when CAT would be up $7-$10 easily on infrastructure news.....now its hard to go up $1....Look at those techs that got hyped so much in the last 3 months are coming down to earth....Either way, the hedgies always make money because they have the media, CNBC, Cramer and so on. Value is dead....seriously."
Infastructure deal
"Hold strong, it's a good company. Patience is the key in the stock market"
Extreme overvaluation.
Manipulation are you kidding I see equipment everywhere on projects there making plenty of cash.
"Forward P/E 10.27, PEG ratio .57, over 3% dividend. I think this could go to $150 without much trouble."
Looks like the dollar soaring is what's taking CAT down for the 2nd day in a row!!!
Wait for BIG BOYS to start some dumpingthen start some buying 202.00 and 198.00
Held up pretty well into a down market today. Looking for a little giddy up tomorrow.
CAT 7 DAYS IN SRAIGHT DOWN WHY WHY WHY
I'm not listening but the stock action seems to indicate that the earnings call is not going well.
"1. If raw materials cost goes up, why are they increasing compensation? They should be doing cost control to off set. 2. The top line and bottom line beat I expected was 1B and $1. Wall Street is greedy and you can’t make them happy with this tiny beat.3. Why CAT not doing aggressive buyback???4. I honestly think an overhaul in top management is needed. May be an involvement of activist investor will help. 5. DE is green today despite CAT is down because CATs problem is company specific, not industry wide.6. I am long and own a lot of shares. I was not ready for this downturn esp from CAT. I have no other choice but to ride it out now."
Selling was OVERDONE !where is the DELTA Variant today ????????what a FBNK joke.................
I am satisfied with this week
hey we beat 2.60 vs est. 240
Cat finally moving back up. $240 soon
"The price increase has been great. Don’t know how much the dividend could increase due to the DPS/EPS ratio. Overall though, from an investor’s point of view, this stock’s performance has been exceptional."
Cat share drop price makes no sense to me at all.When will they run out of funds to keep shorting stock ?
We got today and tomorrow before the Senate recesses for a month. What’s the chances?
"You should buy the dip, this company will not keep these prices for too long. I see 220 by Friday"
Bought My first shares of this. Hopefully good price
"I agree that cat move up to fast,but now is a great buying point for long term"
Good buy if infrastructure passes the house. The house said it will pass it only if they agree to add on the 3 trillion human infrastructure bill.
"wow, big volume today. Somebody is buying :)"
over kill time to start loading up on cat
Waiting….
I think a lot of people are not wanting to post anything for fear of jinxing the rally.
"This Administration is revealing their Total and Complete INCOMPETENCY in dealing with Foreign Policy, the Border, and the Economy. There is little doubt that the Stock Market WILL be taking heavy hit soon.....very, very soon. Sell and buy back after the hit. You're forewarned!"
"is this where it starts drifting to the downside for the rest of the day? had some good infrastructure news this morning, at least. hope to keep ""building"" off that, and fundamentals."
1 trillion on infrastructure passed the senate. Now on to the house! Just bought more
Earnings will take us to $230 per share.
