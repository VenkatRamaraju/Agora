Shaking the tree before earnings tomorrow. This stock also stands to gain the most on the Dow30 index if the infrastructure bill goes through on Friday.
"""Oct. 13, 2021, The board of directors of Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) voted today to maintain the quarterly dividend of one dollar and eleven cents ($1.11) per share of common stock, payable November 19, 2021, to shareholders of record at the close of business on October 25, 2021."" So they are keeping the 8% increase from last quarter."
"Buy here now, headed240.00+"
"cat demand very strong, long-term buy can make a lot of money, target $300"
Have a feeling after ER tomorrow CAT will be sold off for 2 days ( great time to buy more) and then bouncing back up above 200+
CAT added another couple of bucks this week creeping up to my target of $230.

If the US and china are going to rebuild and build out infrastructure Caterpillar will not be left outa the conversation. Maybe the supply chain disruptions will wake up the US and we will get back to manufacturing. Made in the USA!!!
all I know is I am in the green
"Cowen & Co. Initiates Coverage On Caterpillar with Outperform Rating, Announces Price Target of $241."
"As I said, will see 220 by next Friday."
Will move to 220+ on earnings

just amazing.....i am comparing CAT with T stock.....is there any worse stock in the planet???
nice upgrade by JP Morgan at 248.00
Caterpillar was upgraded today (10/29) to BUY from neutral by UBS with a price target of $235.
Hopefully a split announcement
Thanks for196.00
we had a solid day today why the negative reactiond
"Liking the slow steady rise on this one, got a good average a few weeks ago too, good buy"
excellent investment for long. Strong buy at this price.
What is the chances of a pull back to the 175-180 range after earnings?
Does anyone know when CAT goes ex-dividend? Yahoo Finance is not showing it yet (Oct 27). Thanks.
The infrastructure bill is what will move CAT.
market has gone totally bearish on CAT......no chance until the buyers come back.....
keep in mind up over 20.00 YTD all is fine
Earnings beat today? $2.21 seems high considering all things related. Guess we shall see.
"As usual, no analysts will upgrade the stock until 205. When it passes 205, one after another… hopefully next week."
CAT is a no brainer take advantage of the dip because it won’t last.
"It's Cat,it rules"
"(Reuters Oct 28) - Caterpillar Inc reported a quarterly profit on Thursday that beat analysts' estimates.The company's sales have surged for three consecutive quarters as construction demand worldwide has been propped up by an unprecedented level of public spending.Rising oil and commodity prices have also boosted the company's sales, with customers ordering more equipment to ramp up production.Sales from Caterpillar's construction industries business, its largest unit, rose 30%, while sales at its energy & transportation unit jumped 22%.The company's adjusted profit rose to $2.66 per share in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, beating analysts' estimates of $2.20, according to Refinitiv IBES data.Total sales and revenue rose 25.4% to about $12.40 billion, compared with estimates of $12.48 billion."
Target raised @ BMO247.00
Cat is making ev equipment for mining mining needs 500 percent increase for the electric car and truck market
I don't think that CAT has another 10% in gains in it. Looks pretty bad here. I actually found http://alert-sounds.com/ the other day and their stocks are way better...
215+ by end of Friday
silver lining is with lower price I'll be able to get more whare with dividend reinvestment stay long hold strong
CAT is purrrrring right along nice
"CAT did break the $200 mark this week, which means $230 isn't far behind."
Good er
Why unload when earnings will be good
