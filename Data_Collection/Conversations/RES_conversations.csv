"They have a ""good"" balance sheet, more total cash than debt, NOT bad for company in the Oil & Gas Equipment Service business! Just look at ""big"" (NOV), they have around $2 billion in debt on their balance sheet. Also, check out the high percent of RES insiders holding this stock!! 73%."

"“Observation of the stock market will show that the stocks of companies facing receivership are likely to be more active than those which are very low in price merely because of poor current earnings. This phenomenon is caused by the desire of insiders to dispose of their holdings before the receivership wipes them out, thus accounting for a large supply of these share at a low level and also sometimes for unscrupulous efforts to persuade the unwary public to buy them. But where a low-priced stock fulfills our conditions of speculative attractiveness, there is apt to be no pressure to sell and no effort to create buying. Hence the issue is inactive and attracts little public attention. This analysis may explain why the public almost always buys the wrong low-priced issues and ignores the really promising opportunities in this field.” -Security Analysis by Ben Graham & David Dodd, Sixth Edition, Page 523$OIH $CXW $GEO $DIDI $PTEN $RRC $AR $PSCE $KLXE $REI $RIG $MRO $MUR $RES"

Just bought back today, will likely take a 40 cent gain again if it offers itself, but if there is a bigger downturn will just hold on."

"(Bloomberg) -- Gasoline demand surged to a a record high as Americans took to the road for the July 4th holiday weekend.Gasoline supplied, a proxy for demand, rose to 10 million barrels a day the week ended July 2, the highest in data going back to 1990, according to the Energy Information Administration.Demand has regained its footing as vaccinations and easing economic restrictions propel more Americans to resume their pre-pandemic lifestyles. Oil prices have risen almost 50% this year as U.S. refineries run close to full-bore to keep up with fuel demand. While the U.S. recovery quickens, the world’s largest oil producers can’t agree on how to supply the market with Saudi Arabia advocating for tempered supply increases given the potential headwinds that still exist.“Demand is bucking with the price spikes and summer driving, but with high gas prices and inflation, the picture in September may look different,” said Trisha Curtis, co-founder of PetroNerds.The moving average for demand also climbed higher, reaching the most since late 2019. But on a seasonal basis the figure was still about 150,000 barrels a day short of July 2019, suggesting the market still has some room to recover.U.S. motorists hit the road in large numbers despite contending with the highest gasoline prices since 2014. The average pump price Thursday was $3.14 a gallon, according to auto club AAA. 2021 Bloomberg L.P.$CLR $RIG $OXY $COP $VLO $HFC $NOV $HP $RES $MUR $XOM $CVX $BP $KMI $MRO $DVN $PXD $HAL $BKR $SLB $MPC"
