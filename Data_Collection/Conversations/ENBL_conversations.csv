I’m very happy in holding this stock for long term.I see this as a Gift. 14.49 is 52 week high wow!Gl!
"It appears that OGE is working with CNP towards the sale of ENBL. I just got this news:(Bloomberg) -- OGE Energy Corp. has joined CenterPoint Energy Inc. in considering a sale of its stake in Enable Midstream Partners LP, putting the whole oil and gas pipeline company on the block, according to people familiar with the matterThe power companies are working with advisers, said the people, who asked to not be identified because the matter isn’t public. While CenterPoint has openly weighed an exit of Enable for years, OGE Energy is now aligned with that strategy, the people said. No final decision has been made and they could opt to hold on to Enable, they said.Together the companies own all of Enable’s general partner while CenterPoint owns 53.7% of its common units and OGE Energy owns 25.5% of its common units, according to its third-quarter investor presentation. The rest of its common units are held by public investors.Enable rose 1.3% to $4.61 at 10:54 a.m. Tuesday in New York trading, giving the company a market value of about $2.1 billion.A representative for OGE declined to comment. Representatives for Enable and CenterPoint didn’t respond to requests for comment."
Is this stock ever going to bottom? I thought it was profitable and it pays a good div. Just keeps sinking for some reason
"Unless the ET buyout is about to blow up, this is bizarre. The only thing that bothers me concerning this is that maybe WS knows something we don’t. Added 3,000 earlier, just added another 2,000. If the options market wakes up, will probably sell some covered calls, although maybe the smarter move is to buy Sep calls, figuring that parity will return, but right now, virtually no action there."
The announcement of the earnings report is about a week earlier than I expected. Maybe some good news coming. Last quarter had the 86m impairment. Hopefully that’s a thing of the past and this quarter should be better. GL
"Ok I’m done, got my 1000 shares of Enbl and 500 of Epd.Going to take a long nap.Best to AllJohn"
"Energy Transfer and Enable expect the transaction to close in mid-2021, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including Hart-Scott-Rodino clearance.And the market goes wild, or not. Margaret haha. I’ve never held shares/units of anything that sold and the shareholders received nothing for the effort. ￼￼￼"
REMINDER: ENBL is participating in 12/02/20 MUFG Oil & Gas Conference. ENBL's presentation data posted on website.
"Almost hit 6 today, November 24, 2020. If the price slides back down to 4 again then that would indicate to me that the price is being completely manipulated."
"Ok, I bought 500 more shares at $8.97 sold some TAK to do it, naturally ENBL down TAK up. Found a mining stock to work on, so I promise no more ENBL. Actually surprised how well things held up today, but the gas usage reality is perfectly on track.My BestJohn"
"Anyone have any idea on why the drop on a big volume uptick, today ??"
"At this point I'm content with my nearly $3,000 yearly distribution....when they return it to $1.32 next year or so - $6,000 looks REALLY good. I'm not even finish buying at these levels yet, probably another 1,500 shares to buy when it dips."
Got in with 4500 shares at 2.60 made some good money in this stock pulled my profit to reinvest an add a few stocks to my portfolio.still long and bullish in this stock just think the profit will benefit me more invested in mfa xan IVR at this point
"I'm thinking the reason for the downfall is due to the rigs being idle in the Scoop/Stack Play. It means less volumes in the pipelines and a smaller than normal build out of new lines. The rig count has shed 40% from January through Sept 11, 2019. Or from 105 to 62 rigs running. Winter is coming and the volumes should pick up through February.I still love that dividend though and certainly hope they can maintain it!"

Bought some at $1.86. Plenty of upside with solid book value and earnings (should survive). Any other stock suggestions?
Buy 10k at 2.40Good luck to all longs

We just crossed a 52 week high.
AUG 4 Press release by CNP --Two new Directors appointed to Enable Board
FYI K-1s are available.
"It sounds like I am one of the few people here that rode this down from over $10. Idid not plan on riding it down but I did not plan on multiple near death problems from January to April so by the time I got back online it was under $2. Did not buy then afraid the real owners CNPand OGE which together own 80% of shares would take it to bankruptcy. But started to buymore near $3 when it seemed ENBL would survive. I had a lot of stocks in trouble to average downPAA, CS, PRU,PFE,ING and many more but lots are now near even or above water just a bit. Having some cash to average down really helped, wishing I had done even more but also wanted some new bargains like NOK, AEG, MO,IMBBY and more. For all of you thinking it won’t go higher, it will not in a straight line but has great upside over time andeven with cut in dividend this is great return. It will go back over $10. sooner than most think, 6 to 9 months. If you look at PAA you will see what a great up trend we will see on this.Hold and you will make a great return over time.Hope this helps you all that are on the line to hold or sell, I will keep most of mine long term. John"
"Strong company. Good quarter all things considered. The big thing weighing us down is that big debt number and relatively high float. CEQP by comparison is about half the debt, half the float and better in revenues. Those enabled them to keep Their distro in tact while ENBL needed to reduce theirs. They have to essentially cover more debt with lower revenue. With less debt, we’d be flying ."
"Not a horrible earnings report at all Nathan. Big Keys include DCF rate at 2..06 leverage, paydown of additional bonds at discounted prices, and confirmation of earnings guidance for remainder of year. This should be plenty to keep the ball rolling. Any fool would have known comps for any NG related companies would be well below Q2 2019. That’s why ENBL stands out among many others, that being ENBL’s strong set of long term fixed fee contracts."
You can thank Jerome Powell for today's market drop.
"First time I've seen after hour activity at $5.25, up 2.14%. Not sure how many shares, but if it breaks $5.40...."
I bought more ENBL today at $9.13 and averaged down my total to around $10.75. Since I see this dip as a buying opportunity I wanted to also capture the divvy which is going ex within the next few days.
"They are being added to the Barclay MLP Select Index Friday, we should see an increase in buying this week. JMO"
"A little recap on why $ENBL is a S&P Buy:There is an export LNG terminal being built on the Texas Gulf coast. Completion expected by 2022.$ENBL is building the pipeline to supply this terminal. Exports will be big and $ENBL will benefit.However, in the interim, there is much capital spend and little revenue."
"I get a warm fuzzy feeling knowing Bank of America increased their ownership in ENBL by 227%:BANK OF AMERICA CORP /DE/ 06/30/2020 807,289 560,514 227.136% $3,536"
"Enable Midstream Partners, LP (NYSE: ENBL) will release fourth quarter and year-end 2020 financial results before market hours Wednesday, Feb. 24, and will host a conference call at 10 a.m. EST (9 a.m. CST) that day to discuss the results."
"Value Line just released its report for ENBL. As I questioned 3 days ago, it appears that the capital impairment charge of $86 million - (basically a one time paper “loss”) had a skewering effect on actual 4Q earnings reported by the media which reported only $0.02 versus the estimate of $0.25. - and headlined it as a earnings miss of $0.23. In reality, Once you remove the “paper” impairment charge the actual earnings were $0.18, and thus a miss of only $0.07.This incomplete reporting by the financial media may have, in a negatively exaggerated sense, caused a little overselling of ENBL over the last trading sessions. Indeed, I added more ENBL at $7.78 yesterday as it seems a value buy when you look at the present PE ratio compared to its historical average and its relative PE to its industry segment."
"Not a horrible Q1, certainly doesn't justify the share price being beaten down as it has been."
Today could be a good day for ENBL. NG looks like it’s finally separating from oil. GL
Finally looks like a break out day as we get distributions tomorrow 5/27
Based on Ets present price ENBL worth only 7.78
I read the post from John and he said he felt CP and OGE was going to take this company to bankruptcy. How crazy is that. True they own 80 percent of the stock but ENBL is further from going BR than any MLP out there. ENBL is a cash cow for them. I have worked for ENBL since it was formed and I know we are in great shape for the long term. BR is not in our future!
what happens to our cost basis for ENBL shares after converted to ET shares??
"As reported on Seeking Alpha.￼OGE Energy (OGE +1.4%) opens higher after winning an upgrade to Buy from Neutral with a $37 price target at Guggenheim, which says a valuation re-rating likely will result from a deconsolidation push at Enable Midstream Partners (ENBL -4%), in which OGE owns a 25% limited partner interest and a 50% general partner interest.Guggenheim analyst Shahriar Pourreza sees a potential path for Enable's deconsolidation emerging by October, with OGE ""then becoming an undervalued, fully regulated, low risk, single state utility"" with incremental capital opportunities."
You have to wonder if the price increase today was because of something we don’t know or was it that NG went up so much. I’m surprised that NG went up as much as it did with the increase in supply. GLTAL
"Been dipping my toes in gradually. Full disclosure I am long term and would prefer it to stay in the 2.50 range while I “stock up” Pun intended. Have a minors account(1.99 entry) and personal account(2.37). Not worried about what the pps is unless it gets too high. Lol. I understand trading it as it goes up and down. Not sure how people are factoring in it going much lower. Funded through this year, dividend slashed(but would take a significant retrace to make it a loser with that payout), budget cut( but still moving forward on certain major projects), primarily owned by two large stable companies, and the infrastructure that can’t be replaced without billions spent. If a an upstream company goes bankrupt their assets/wells are going to be bought by someone. They don’t rebuild all that infrastructure. Enable has already seen this in the Haynesville with Shell and Encana selling to Geo and Vine. Short term hopefully it will hang out here, I am greedy long term! Lol"
I sold this one way too early. Congrats to everyone who has held onto this through the continuing rally.
ENBL holders are being cheated. The .8595 ratio is below the true worth of the stock which in reacting to the merger lost over 6% of its value today. In addition ENBL holders will find their distribution substantially reduced. Only the insiders will benefit from this deal.
I see no reason for the drop due to Centerpoint wanting to sell Enable. That's old news and the reason they have not been able to sell it is due to the price they would get for it. As the price moves up they will eventually find a buyer and a price they can live with. In the meantime if then are a desperate seller they would take a bath on their $1B stake. Makes no difference to ENBL as Centerpoint expects NG to be the substitute fuel for coal over the next few years which is also very well known.
I’m guessing a bigger pipeline would be a potential buyer such KMI OKE or WMB. A reasonable price in the short term 10 times EV/EBITDA which is what Buffet just paid for the Dominion pipeline. That would place the sale price at between 7.50 and 8. I don’t think this is the best time to sale though. I’m hoping for at least 10/s.
has enbl declared their dividend yet? i know they announced that they would slash it but was there any other info beyond that?
This one and WES for the easiest money made in your lifetime IMHO anyway. GL to all true longs here !!
"Energy Transfer LP (NYSE: ET) today announced a quarterly cash distribution of $0.1525 per ET common unit ($0.61 on an annualized basis) for the first quarter ended March 31, 2021. The announced quarterly distribution is consistent with the distribution for the fourth quarter of 2020 and will be paid on May 19, 2021 to unitholders of record as of the close of business on May 11, 2021"

Nice gain today
"Enable Midstream Partners, LP (NYSE: ENBL) announced that the board of directors of its general partner declared today a quarterly cash distribution of $0.16525 per unit on all outstanding common units for the quarter ended March 31, 2021. The distribution is unchanged from the previous quarter. The quarterly cash distribution of $0.16525 per unit on all outstanding common units will be paid May 25, 2021, to unitholders of record at the close of business May 13, 2021."
ET needs to be at $7.57 per share for ENBL unit holders to break even as of today.
"As a new holder, I note NO. Where are the lawsuits when we need then.Management has sold out. This is criminal."
Great quarter

"More positive news about this stock, get ready for it to sink like a rock. Seems logical"
Play the ups and downs right now if you have the stomach for it but until the price war is over this thing will be volatile. I agree it will not be going bankrupt so loading up anywhere in this price range will look like a genius move in a year.
"Been looking at ENBL for a while, what i don't understand is that, even though ENBL's balance sheet is quite strong, debt/equity ratio is far better than most of its peers, yet its price target consensus is fairly low ($2.5-$4) for unknown reasons. are there any particular reasons as to why analysts don't have a more favorable view of ENBL?"
"I continue to expand my pipeline investments, prices still low and returns high.ENBL, EPD and WES. I am holding steady on PAA.I am not risking ET, anyone with thoughts.RegardsJohn"

"First time in profit on ENBL for me in a year. All my pipelines up, some dramatically. Not sure where to put next weeks distributions. I assume most of us will continue to hold.Best to AllJohn"
"BMO Capital Markets initiated coverage of Enable.Market Perform rating, $14 price target.Trading in-line with the peer group averages.This appears to be neither upgrade nor downgrade.I fail to see why they bothered to comment at all.With upside potential of around 14%, i expect the target price to be a bit higher but perhaps they are being conservative. Any thoughts?"
It looks like profit taking since they went up so much in a short time. It will recover in my opinion.
"For clarity the ENBL price will only matter if you are getting out before shares are substituted at a .8595 to one rate, if ENBL changes it does not affect this share ratio our value will simply be what ET is on ourreduced number of shares, my nice round 20,000 will be an ugly 17,190.Keeping an eye out to to purchase ENBL if a significant disparity arises might be worthwhile,I am going to use my dividends for other choices.It’s going to hurt when we see how good ENBL’S first quarter reports are, all the cold weather means flow increased substantially. Hopefully the deal runs into delay or heaven sent implodes. I would like to get distributions another time or two or 38.Best to All John"
80% of ENBL is owned by Centerpoint and OGE. their book value is $10.50/ share. they don't really care about the price...they care about the dividend. the DCF/distribution ratio is 1.38 for 2019. lower oil prices aren't good for ENBLs top line but it doesn't seem to me that they are particularly sensitive to oil and gas prices. BTW I own ENBL and bought another 1000 shares today.
Centerpoint going green. They had better figure out this ice deal because Texans aren’t happy. It looks like ENBL and NG should have got more valuable the past few days. My guess is your ET shares will go up in the next quarter or two. GL
"On February 14 2020 ENBL paid shareholders .331 Dividend. However no mention of a dividend this February except a conference on the 24th of this month. Since no dividend is being announced yet, and we all know that ENBL is up for sale, does anyone have a clue what's may be coming down the pike? This freezing weather in the north east should be a big boost the cash flow. CNP is working and grooming to sell CNP yet I don't have any hint. Except the dividend seems to be up in the air. Any information would be appreciated, clueless"
"It’s All good!“As previously announced, on April 27, 2021, the board of directors of Enable’s general partner declared a quarterly cash distribution of $0.16525 per unit on all outstanding common units for the quarter ended March 31, 2021. The distribution is unchanged from the previous quarter and represents Enable’s 28th consecutive quarterly distribution since the partnership’s initial public offering in April 2014. The quarterly cash distribution of $0.16525 per unit on all outstanding common units will be paid May 25, 2021, to unitholders of record at the close of business May 13, 2021.”"
"How is this not a no brainer strong buy? What am I missing?I am long XOM, RDS-A, BP, TOT, ET, XLE, ENBL, OKE with 100% of my portfolio since about 4 weeks ago."
Is this company going under or what is the problem? It seems like it just can't get any forward momentum. Are there underlying issues here that I am not aware of. Who wants to sell now and take a loss...but I am hoping at some point the bleeding stops.
Enbl beats by .02 at .18. Beats on revenue 73.42 with total revenue of 787 million or 52.8% y/y too.
Its not worth it to buy above that price. You'll lose money when ET takes over
"Enable’s general partner declared a quarterly cash distribution of $0.16525 per unit on all outstanding common units for the quarter ended June 30, 2020. The distribution is unchanged from the previous quarter. The quarterly cash distribution of $0.16525 per unit on all outstanding common units will be paid Aug. 25, 2020, to unitholders of record at the close of business Aug. 18, 2020"
I never received my dividends?? From what date did I have to own stock in order to revive it
Does it make sense to buy at this price
"The price of ENBL is under pressure because the industry is out of favor. Some are worried about the price of oil and gas and the stability of world markets, fearing a slow down in U.S. exports which could lead to less production.. My advice is to buy, double down and buy more then hold and enjoy the fat dividend. My money is where my advice is."
"If ET is paying $7.2 billion for ENBL in exchangeable ET shares, then the exchange rate should be set at 1.7ET shares and not 0.8 they have specified. That is half of what it should be. Who is kidding who?"
FYI: Enable Management will be participating in Wolfe Virtual Utilities and Midstream Conferenc Sept. 30 - October 1.
"Bottom line, the company fundamentals are the same as they were a year ago. The price is depressed because of outside factors related to the industry. As those slowly begin to turn in our favor, the price will rise. Expect this rise back to $12-15 to be slow and steady like the last few days. In the mean time, just sit back and collect the dividend.Unless of course those sales rumors turn out to be true."
"There are and will be more issues due to the prices and many losses and defaults however at the end of the day every gas and transport company will not be bankrupt and cease operations. What are Enables chances of surviving? At a $1.61 per share, what are the chances one of the large player could or would step up and buyout Enable? It's currently trading as if its going bankrupt tomorrow but it seems like at the current PPS someone would be interested in a takeover if Enable is a solid company. There have been a lot of large sells and large buys today. Any thoughts?"
EIA report this morning and NG is already trying to climb in anticipation. Could be the start of a long term climb. Let’s hope. GLTAL
"Environmental assessment for the Gulf Run pipeline was complete 10/29. This is the one of the last steps before construction can begin. This is good news, why is no one talking about it?"
"What people don’t understand is gas doesn’t atop flowing from wells. Even if producers delay drilling, ENBL is fine and they lowered their dividend, so the longevity is much further out for this company. This is a huge buy right now."
"Well after doing some analysis on this deal and researching a bit about ET, I am not happy at all. ENBL shareholders are getting the short end of the stick here. This should be a 1-for-1 stock exchange at the very least. I would have preferred a cash buyout since ET is not a company I would consider buying. I'll wait until ex-dividend tomorrow and probably going to unload my shares. This is very disappointing."
That was quite interesting. It seems all the Midstream companies started a coordinated price meltdown at 9:30.
HI Question for those who have studied this better. Is there a direct relation between oil price and ENBL ? Just wondering . What is their fee based source of revenue ? wondering if their revenue is directly related to OiL or is this based on oil holding cost and pipeline construction costs etc ?
Presentations from Natural Gas Utilities (Center Point Energy presentation starts at 16:20):https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-09zsWJ_52IEncouraging to see that utilities still going to be using and invest in nat gas for the foreseeable future.
"Sure the oil gas market is getting creamed. And sure they cut the dividend to survive. But the price fell from 10 to 2.5. And when the market turns around after the corona virus cure is out (and they do have them), or Trump starts up with Iran, this is going to change so fast and the stock will move 200% in one week and you're going to be paying 7.50 a share. So go ahead and whine at the temporary reduced dividend, but the fact is it's either everything turns around or its the dark ages. I'm betting on a recovery coming any week now and it's going to happen so fast. Expect at least one +2000$ day in the market , followed by several +1000$ days."
➤ Enable Midstream CEO mum on potential sale amid strategic reviewThe head of Enable Midstream Partners' general partner declined to speculate on whether the appointments of two former Anadarko Petroleum Corp. executives to Enable GP LLC's board of directors would indicate that majority owner CenterPoint Energy Inc. is preparing to sell the midstream partnership.
Low volume today. Presumably due to forthcoming Russia-Saudi talks tomorrow. Scooped up 10K at $2.50. Div is in place. Feels like a safe play.
"Reminder of two important meetings next week. (1) Monday, 12/07/2020 -starting 10 am Eastern. CNP ..2020 Investor Day and Analyst meeting. (2) WED. DEC 9, 2020 -- ENBL will participate Iin Wells Fargo Midstream & Utility Symposium."
"I see Berkshire and Williams as key bidders, who else do y’all see being an active bidder?Second question: Do you think that CNP/OGE will encourage ENBL to increase the distribution to help them meet their own dividend payouts and drive the buy-out prices up?"
ET just reported blowout earning. Revenue beat over 5 billion. They should of paid more for enbl!
Received my dividend today. I think I’ll buy more shares. GL
"97% of this company's stock is hold by insiders and institutions, less than 3% individuals own shares. That's why I hold and just collect the distribution and not worry about the big price swings. JMO"
"The quarterly cash distribution of $0.16525 per unit on all outstanding common units will be paid Nov. 24, 2020, to unitholders of record at the close of business Nov. 17, 2020."
"Seems like as the market digests they are liking this deal. In a way, if ET got a steal, then as long as we get ET shares we are OK, because the ET shares will have appreciated. I do have this tax question, will our ENBL basis (inclusive of distribution reductions) become our going forward basis on ET spear I er fewer shares? Or do they treat it as a sell on ENBL and a buy of ET? This will be the first time I’ve held an MLP that was bought out."
"Right at the bell a trade for 3,122,267 shares occurred bringing the volume to over 4,414,000 shares. Before that trade the stock only traded 1,292,593 shares. Any ideas on the 3,122,000 trade?"
"In September Morgan Stanley initiated ENBL coverage as underweight.0n September 30, 2020 filing they showed an 87% increase to over 3 million shares owned."
I’m thinking Blackstone at around $24.00 per share.
"Ok, I bought just a little today to put in my Grandson’s new account. I of course lost him money on his first day of owning stock but he has a long time to make it back.My Best to AllJohn"
Looks like another strong day on the road to a full recovery. GL
The positive results seemed to have pushed ENBL share price well above 0.8595 x ET share price.
"Will be at $10 by year end (probably sooner). 10% distribution is just a bonus.Bought a bit too much for my portfolio, been buying since $1.80."
Very good result one of the safest MLP in this volatile environment. Once the dust settles we will go back to 40 cents dividends per quarter Gl!
"So, I expect the new CNP CEO will have to expect and be prepared for lots of questions on their ENBL plans. Can’t imagine it doing anything but helping our cause. He’s got to want one of two things, either increased distributions, or top dollar for a sales price. I’d be glad to take either, or both, lol. Expect tomorrow to see the real rise to begin. Look at the tape last time, it can move pretty far, pretty fast. Feeling good, real good."
"Because of the payments to the general partner issue, it is not likely the dividend will be raised again any time soon. But so what, with a 10.2% tax sheltered yield I would be happy even if the dividend were never raised. Some brokers allow their customers to reinvested distributions without commission. People who don't need the cash should do so."
"If nothing breaks soon, I’m thinking that we may be receiving another distribution before the sale closes."
"Closed out my little call position in the June $5 calls. Sold in three little 4 contract lots at $1, $1.40 and $1.50. Did well, but of course wished I’d have waited until $1.50. But I’m sure expecting it to continue up, but options are risky in any two week period. I would have had a 650% return in less than one week had I sold all 30 contracts at $1.50. Coulda, woulda, shoulda, lol. Continue on up, I have what is for me, a nice position in the stock itself that is not time dependent like options are. Been looking at the Aug $7.50’s. Saw a guy suggest looking at the Sep and Dec options the other day. My Schwab screen does not have either listed. If any of you has a broker app with them, I’d appreciate it if you’d provide the name."
"Does ENBL have any preferred stock that is available in the marketplace? If so, how do you buy it?"
"@Jim// why didn’t you just say 10x Dominion’s Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization before EBITDA? Would make about as much sense. I remember 10x book value anyway. Pipe in the ground is worth a lot more than it once was. Duke and Dominion spent hundreds of millions on the Atlantic Coast Pipeline before throwing in the towel and still got a good price for what was left."
"Watch WES and Enable side by side. WES is the canary. When it drops, Enable immediately follows. Today, anyway."
"Enable Midstream Partners, LP (NYSE: ENBL) announced that the board of directors of its general partner declared today a quarterly cash distribution of $0.16525 per unit on all outstanding common units for the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2020. The distribution is unchanged from the previous quarter. The quarterly cash distribution of $0.16525 per unit on all outstanding common units will be paid March 1, 2021, to unitholders of record at the close of business Feb. 22, 2021."
"Very dissatisfied with the take-out price, but it is what it is. Had a great 11 months with ENBL though, so I’m not crying a river of tears. I should have known CNP management lacked both the cajones and skill set to maximize the value. Had a 120% gain on the first run sold all. Bought back in the $1.92 to $2.02 range and still holding. Made a very nice net profit on options with a big gain in May and Aug and a small loss in Nov. Had a fellow I respect really push me to buy ET instead of ENBL last March, that would have been a terrible mistake. I’m leaning towards taking my final profit in cash rather than holding ET. If someone in this group can share their thoughts as to whether their are some glowing opportunities when putting these two companies together, I will certainly listen. All I can imagine off-hand is shedding costs after firing about half the ENBL executives."
"From 3/17 CS report on CNP concerning Enable: “”Enable risks: CNP owns 53.7% of Enable Midstream (ENBL) and receives approximately $300M annual cash distributions that are used to fund regulated capital programs. CNP management notes there is no indication of a distribution cut being contemplated, with ENBL having hedges in place for most of 2020 and over 10K wells connected to the system.... What happens if ENBL cuts its distribution? To be clear, CNP management continues to emphasize that it has received no indication from ENBL that such a cut is being considered, and that ENBL continues to receive a significant portion of its own cash flows from more stable fee-based transportation and storage contracts. “”"
"With the recovery in NG prices....I'm hoping 2021 is the year ENBL stock price recovers a bit. I bought in before the pandemic and double/tripled down over a couple of guys during. I'm a bit over even, but now looking forward to a decent gain if we can get back to our pre-pandemic levels. That combined with cannabis investments, could be an interesting year!"
Great earnings why is share price under pressure?
"March 26th they pushed it to $2.46, then down to under $1.90 the ensuing days....Rinse, wash, repeat."
ENBL well positioned according to this article:https://rbnenergy.com/down-so-low-2020s-upheavals-bring-midstreamers-challenges-to-the-foreCheck the 2 graphs there.
"ENABLE 's latest presentation is available on its website today. Prepared for UBS conference Jan. 12-13, 2021."
"The stock went X-dividend today which means new buyers will have to wait until the end of May to get the next dividend. Typically especially in the case of a high yield stock, in order to get the dividend without holding the stock, people buy before the X date and sell immediately after. This and the fact that the industry is a out of favor is why the stock is so weak. There is fear that the new pandemic will greatly reduce travel and adversely affect the world economy and the demand for fuel. Considering ENBL has a solid balance sheet, good management, a well covered and enormous dividend and a rock bottom price, I am adding to my position."
"Question, if the oil inventories skyrocketed, does that mean those pipelines gonna have more work to do?"
A 20% dividend and another 50% stock appreciate in the next few days makes for an easy buy! Everyone load up! This is going back to $6 in no time!
Why does this stock keep dropping? Is there something wrong that I am not aware of with this company? Great div but if the price plummets that erases the div pretty quickly.
"I posted over on the ET board about the record setting Texas Electricity usage multiple days and the whole region is hot. The third quarter will be very strong and we may not freeze my Grandson’s river in Texas but it will be a cold winter as well. Merger or not ENBL is making money and I like my distributions.I also am praying for our people left in harms way by a failed human, this is beyond political it’s evil.All of us here are blessed and I am thankful to all our military trying so hard in this sad time.My Best to Everyone John"
Will ENBL pay an August dividend ??
"I bet ENBL has been able to sell their gas on storage for a good price lately. Just saw a report on nat gas shortage of 1bcf in Mexico... ENBL operates various interstate and intrastate pipes, so they can send their gas anywhere."
Et misses earnings by .07 cents.
"ENBL closed at $8.73 on December 31, 2019.ENBL closed at $5.26 on December 30, 2020.Natural Gas closed at $2.189 on December 31, 2019.Natural Gas closed at $2.42 on December 31, 2020.S&P 500 closed at 3230.78 on December 31, 2019.S&P 500 closed at 3732.04 on December 30, 2020.Interest rates are down since December 31, 2019.Was ENBL vastly overvalued on December 31, 2019 or is it vastly undervalued today?"
"A natural gas pipeline, once built and operating is a money machine. And since the customers are hooked to the infrastructure, they have nowhere else to go. This company is a money machine, and people will regret not getting in at these low prices."
NG approaching 3 bucks -- and it is only October!!! - this may be a very good winter for all related
Enable doesn’t move very well in relation to other Midstream companies. I’m seeing others up like 15%. Why is that?
Very happy with my 4000 shares wanted 5000 but out of cash till more dividends arrive.
"such an impressive earnings beat, why are they selling out to ET for such a cheap valuation??"
At $2.70 the dividend is nearly $50 yield. That is unreal..would this be sustainable? Price Still dropping as I type down to 2.47 this is insane. Big holders must be dumping
Funny we’re down a bit this morning. Watching the trades the volume is definitely a lot larger on the buy side. Most sellers seem to be selling only a few hundred shares at a time. Looks like we have some big buyers trying to move into a small market. GLTAL
"If we end the week in the green every day, we can feel lucky. My concern is again the volume, but there's still half an hour for the closing, let's hope it climbs a bit more, many other midstreams are red and few green, we can feel lucky!"
I should clarify - I do see that they have cut their dividend but I see no mention of an ex dividend date or a pay date?
"Reminder: $0.1652 quarterly distribution to common unit holders of record at close on May 19, 2020. Payment will be made on May 27, 2020. (5/6/2020 press release)"
Vote your units by 5/6. Two items .......the buyout and a payout (compensation package) to execs.Not that it matters!
"Off we go to reach $3.5 by the close? Seems like we might have a late spike in the trading day...or not. Vote up for a spike, down for a drop before the close."
Had a another great day owning pipelines today bought early some BPMP and SHLX then watched every pipeline go up all day.Best to AllJohn
"HowieEnlc has some movement but look at debt to equity ratios and compare your risk.If enable sells like many are predicting, I can not imagine that CNP or OGE wouldsell for less than 3/4 of book value, +- $12.00.I personally think they will need to have a significant improvement before selling.I have said I hope to just keep getting a distribution. I could accept a good priceand be very happy of course."
Still the dividend is 26% and looks toMe very stable with their cost cuttings.I’m pretty sure the NG upswing will happen 2 quarters and they could reinstate the dividends immediately.Gl!
"Compared to almost any investment, Enbl is a huge bargain, I believe the distributions will beginto rise again, when they do the share price will rise in tandem. Glad I added more last week.Regards to AllJohn"
"The rise back to $12 begins. We may be there by the end of the year, if all variables work in our favor."
It’s gonna be a really nice $6 day. After 3 years we have infrastructure spending of $1 Trillion....Where was Mitch McConnell’s wife hiding since then?
Just a comment on the CEQP comparison..... ENBL has been de-risked CEQP has not...... CEQP 4x w 1.1 coverage. ENBL 3.3X with 2.97 coverage after the div cut. ENBL has been de-risked significantly while CEQP is on thin ice and good chance they cut as they see less volumes. ENBL can now rest easy as they have lots of cushion here as volumes decrease to maintain the dividend. No real reason to pay on the debt at 3.3X but they could choose to buy back shares or just keep dry powder to ride out the storm.
"Way, way oversold, time to buy and hold in my opinion."
"Our goal is one sided and in our mind creates a safe and engaging place for users to connect over interests and passions by giving you only our view which controls the narrative and steers your thought process our way. In order to improve the dishing out of our one sided slanted view in the community experience we are suspending article commenting, probably for years to come which is well beyond the next presidential election."
Does anyone know how strong ENBL’s balance sheet is? Being largely owned by its two largest customers (two utilities) is comforting.
"Dear Pipewelder, a month ago we chatted about GTE at $0.20, then a month later we discussed the rise in oil and GTE was mid $0.40's.......today it's over $0.70......Earnings come out in February and looking for $1.50+ then $3 by summer. Are you game?"
"I personally am failing to see the short term down trend that so many people are so confident about regarding this stock. Fundamentals are solid with an amazing distribution (different than a dividend, research MLP if you don't know). Additionally there is a high amount of institutional backing. A technical analysis shows a short term bullish trend forming, support has formed and been tested multiple times around 1.82 or so. Looking at various periods such as intraday, daily, and weekly with ADX and MACD it can be observed that a stronger upward trend is developing. I like candles, today at the day period, a bullish engulfing pattern was seen. Volume has shown to be above average for, going from memory here but I think nearly every day in the last 5 trading sessions. Last, pre and post market buyers have been willing to pay above closing for at least the past couple of sessions. Trading strategies are different for each of us but in my novice opinion (I am an engineer by day and trade stocks for fun) this is getting ready to move. It will have ups and downs (beta 1.49) but you have to ask yourself if risking a well leveraged position is worth taking profits now when by so many indications it looks like this stock is just starting to rev its engine. The market was down today but this gains 27%? Any little trickle of positive news related to oil or a good turn between Russia and Saudi Arabia will cause a substantial reaction here. This is of course just my opinion but, I will not let go of my shares so cheaply and risk my well leveraged position when so many compelling bits of evidence tell me this is just the start of a good thing."
"FYI if you want a better understanding of the merger, go to the document section of Enables website and review Schedule 14A proxy. The exchange of units for ET unit will not trigger (in their opinion) a reportable event. GLTA"
I guess we're riding this all the way to zero. At this rate I'm starting to believe stock prices may actually go negative with EU interest rates. ???
"without a sentiment change for the entire industry, it's hard to say if a buyout is good news or bad news. For examples, looking at the valuation Berkshire got on the Dominion deal. They bought a 16bil sales company for $10bil bucks. That's .625 multiple of revenue. That's insanely cheap in normal condition. If you use that same multiple to ENBL, you get around $2 billion in buyout value. That's the same market cap that we're at today"
"Yahoo shows support at $3.82; Adding....so far 3,500 shares."

"John Laws state, ""we expect the recent sale of Arclights position in Enable to remove the overhang of our stock,"""
"It's gonna be a moved week…Bearish short term, bullish mid-long term."
"ENBL should be at $7+ given what the comps are doing. Market is waiting for the ""event"" - the news of which is coming in the next 30 days according to CNP. My over/under is $10.50 equity deal with a strategic. That way CNP can feel good about the sales price on a trailing basis (almost 10x EV/EBITDA) and the buyer can easily argue an accretive deal at 8x pro forma for cost and revenue synergies. To quote Ronnie Milsap, ""Any day now"". Elvis sang it too, among others."
"I think it would be a mistake for CNP and OKE to sell, becoming less vertically integrated seems short sighted. I personally would like to see a gradual return to higher distributions,even a quick profit does not equal the combined value of higher stock value and payoutsover time. With over $16.00 book value per share at a depreciated level, and a almost assured increasein natural gas usage what is a motivating number to make a sale a fair value."
"Does this company normally announce div/distribution on earnings announcement date, which would be Aug 5? Several other midstream companies already announced their's ahead of earnings date. Also, is everyone pretty much expecting around $0.165?"
"EdYou are almost right we get .8595 share of ET at closing, I think the market seems to be discounting ENBL 15 cents making it the cheapest way to add ET, for a while it tracked closer. I assume this is for some risk of ET moving prior to ENBL. I added both when the market went crazy and we were all happy not to own TSLA.Without a doubt the combination makes ET much stronger. For once I am holding a little cash but if nothing pops up for me I will simply add more ENBL.Regards John"
"Here is a bullish little clip from the CNP conference call below. Yeah the stock is really lagging now, but just hang on good things are coming and enjoy the dividend going forward!""On Slide 13, we show that since its formation, through our ownership of common units, Enable has provided approximately $1.8 billion in cash distributions to CenterPoint, and we expect the total to -- amount to grow to more than $3 billion by the end of 2023. The distributions from Enable provide an efficient source of cash to support our utility infrastructure investments""."
"I cannot understand why this stock keeps dropping. ENBL has an airtight balance sheet, a well covered dividend which has just been raised, a yield of well over 10% and people who buy now (before it goes Ex div) can receive the next dividend in only 3 weeks. I have loaded up with the stock."
Up about $.20 today and still selling at a $.14 discount.
Trading at a .10-.15 discount to ET as per the 1 share of ENBL equal to .8595 shares of ET.
"ENBL cuts dividend, capex, and OPM costs = ~112M/quarter.2019 Q4 Revenues, Cost of Materials, Gross margin, and EBITA at $731M, $321M, $410M, and $274M respectively.Going to take a stab at 20% reduction in revenues in Q2.This is due to positive effects of hedging and negative effects of counter party risk on storage and production.2020 Q2 Revenues, Cost of Materials, Gross margin, and EBITA at $585M, $256M, $329M, and $173M respectively. Common dividend, preferred dividend, and debt interest of $66M and $9M $48M yields 173 - 66 - 9 - 48= $50M in free cash after expenses and distributions.You know what that looks like to me? I think it looks like $25M in savings and $25M in common share buyback."
I expect this to go below $5 momentarily but overall with the dividend payout we should be fine.I’ll be adding slow and steady throughout next week.GL!
"It’s more fun going up than coming down. I topped out on Enable last week, got to my magic #.Spent after hours Friday adding Epd, even added a little Paa. Tried to add more premarket today,but missed, only by a little, now I have to pay more. This site reminds me of a Sunday morning TV show I saw about 60 years ago.The farmer was praying for rain, the house builder was praying for no rain till he got a roofon the house. Pipe Welder wants it to dip for his drip and I want it to keep going up ASAP.Best to AllJohn"
"Margaret, I read the report by ""Seeking Alpha"" I like the conclusion of it, and copied it ""ConclusionIn conclusion, there are a lot of reasons to be attracted to Enable Midstream today. The company has a reasonably safe business model that is more insulated from commodity price fluctuations than most of its peers and it has even some growth potential that is likely to pan out over the next few years. The company's customer base may not be quite as safe as what some other firms like The Williams Companies have but commodity prices have also rebounded significantly from their bottoms earlier this year. Thus, it does appear that the worst may be behind us at this point. When we combine this with the fact that the company does appear able to easily maintain its 15%+ yield, there could be an opportunity here."
"At least unit price seems to be tracking ET unit price. Just unfortunate timing on the valuation being a few days before that bump up on Tuesday. If you view it as an equal exchange of shares, the question for me is whether the risk with ET is worth staying in (ie Dakota Access shutdown) since ET has upside. I bought in during the lows, so it's not a loss situation for me, just gauging future upside."
"I read a report off of EPD's Conversation board, 3 months ago, about the sale of Dominion to Warren Buffet. What I remember, and correct me if I am wrong, was that Buffet paid 10x Dominion's earnings before EBITA.Now if that should be the case also with ENBL, does anyone on this board have an up to date analyst projections for ENLB'S third quarter earnings?If so, I would be interested in knowing, how much that would amount to per share for ENLB."
Event update: ENBL participating in J.P.Morgan energy conference today...
"I’m really liking this stock. Good distribution for the PPS. Mid-streams seem to be the spot to park your money for decent returns. No major fluctuation in price, good returns, limited impact based on market demand and storage for when the demand kicks up. NOTE: when I say limited impact, I mean compared to the upstream or downstream sectors, where rigs will shutdown based on barrel price or refineries produce based on product market price."
"A lot of negativity here. It has stalled and that is frustrating, but this stock was trading around 15 for years prior to the dip. Theyre not going BK and they're still oaying Div. If you're long here, is there really any reason for concern?"
"So tell me about the 2015-2016 decline in oil prices? ENBL took about 6 months to get to the bottom, and 3 months to get back to prior cost. How does the two scenarios compare, since now we have the global virus to throw in the mix."

"CNP and OGE share prices declining once more. Is this year end, out of favor, covid or expected ENBL sale is less than expected."

"Will easily swing in the other direction, no real volume here. What is happening however, is that this lower unit price will adversely￼ impact OGE’s and CNP’s bottom line this quarter resulting in a non-cash impairment tied to a decline in the value of units it owns in Enable Midstream Partners. The primary unit holders have a vested interest in increasing the unit price.....or finding a buyer."

Yahoo now shows support at $3.17; Any chart readers here?
Many of the other good midstream partner companies are $5 plus which it wouldn't surprise me if we reach that level in the near future. The confirmed dividend of .16525 next month makes it even that much sweeter.

One of the best EBITA/Debt ratios in the game.However, ENBL is positioning to lose half its profit margin. This is due to counter party risk. Producers are subject to oil/NG prices and subject to storage space. Keep the risk in mind."
Is ENBL still paying dividend?
"The stock market is front running the economy. 20million new jobless that may take years to refill, many a small businesses permanently disrupted. Their is a massive disconnect between the two. Is this the new market normal? Is this the shortest recession in history but the most destructive? If a correction is due it will be a long way down."
"Let’s talk about the potential sale by CNP of their stake. Has anyone done the math to say what price CNP would have to receive for their stake that would allow them to truly benefit? At a minimum, doesn’t that require that they have to be able to receive enough cash to pay off enough debt to more than cover the current annualized distributions they receive from ENBL? That probably requires some pretty big numbers per share they would have to receive, but that’s a relatively easy calculation to make. What I don’t know, is what that would do with respect to state and federal income tax requirements, could be a positive or negative. Anyone out there that can give us any guidance in the tax side?"

"As a former enable employee I’ve talked with many of my friends there. The take over of enable by ET still doesn’t have a firm date. However, all the salaried enable employees have had mini interviews with the ET managers of the group they would be in. Then in June/July they were sent offer letters for continued employment at current position or transfer or demotions or when there last day would be. The hourly employees will not know their status until the deal closes. The deal is continuing but appears to be taking a lot of time to meet all the regulatory requirements. It’s pretty stressful on all of them. This has always been inevitable since CenterPoint created the midstream company back in 2013."
Good news just out - ET's Dakota Access Pipeline won't be required to shutdown during environmental review.
"Well, the ENBL PRIMARY OWNER Centerpoint just brought in true heavyweight as CEO, when they hired David Laser who was the Halliburton CEO from 2000-2017 until retiring. Apparently he has Oil & Gas still running through his veins. I have to take his knowledge base as a huge positive for both CNP and ENBL. Let the wheels and deals begin to turn!!!

"So, ENBL share trading volume has be over 250 million shares total for the past two quarters combined. With an outstanding float of just 83.125 million, how is it that the trading volume represents 3X the total float. I would think that HF and Hedge funds normally would not trade this due to the low float amount, but someone sure is. If CenterPoint and OGE are not selling their investment in ENBL, 55.4% - 25.5% respectively, that's a lot of volume for a small float number. No significant changes of top holders, institutions, or mutual funds. At some point, there will be a significant number of long term holders as the weak hands have bailed. The share price will move higher based on the fundamentals and a GAAP based net income of + dollars. DCF of 1.3X is nice but + GAAP Net Income makes more sense to me."

"Well PAA unsurprisingly lost money in the 4th quarter, I think they will do better this year since oil is going to improve, but I only averaged down partially last year and have not continued to add. ENBL I not only averaged down I continued to add, not long to find out if that was smart. WES was has been my best; wish I had bought even more, EPD my other big MLP choice I added a lot and I am very glad I did, will add some more over time.Recently bought SUN and PSXP after getting my vaccine shot, thinking all of us old people will hit the road this spring. SUN went up like a rocket and PSXP fell like a rock, naturally I had bought more of the PSXP.I still think long term PSXP will be a solid choice. I have mentioned before that IMBBY is a buy currently, got all I can have but it is part of my dollar hedge.Pound is now over $1.38 dollars making the next dividend payment over $.66 cents.

It's interesting how ENBL always has their earnings reports one day ahead of CNP. This quarter is no different. I don't think we'll be getting any news about a divestiture this time. Just more of the same. At least we are trending in the right direction.

Any thoughts on when ENBL shares become ET shares???
"@Pipewelder Are you still dripping ENBl I thought of you when it ticked back up, drip? I added more to it and even more directly to ET the combination has become my third largest holding and any of my top three have the potential to jump to the winners circle.My BestJohn"
"ET stock price will rise. Next week ET dividend payment. Price of oil close to a bottom. Pipeline makes money no matter price of oil. LNG is future and when natural gas price rise ET will move a lot of product through the pipelines, collect lot of tolls!! ET is a cash cow!! Long ET!!"
"Wow, this stock is way oversold in my opinion. I added shares, couldn't resist at this price. Long term holder."
A large goodwill impairment charge of $86million was assessed against 4Q profit. Wondering if that result accounts for the difference of the earning miss from what was estimated.
any thoughts as to why this ripped today even though oil is down? i own a bunch and am genuinely interested?
Looks like a great stock with an awesome dividend. Will be adding to my portfolio asap. Any thought on the dividend going back up after share price corrects??? Thanks
Distribution announced today.$0.16525 / unit for the commons
This equity looks ripe to buy at the present price.
"Great outlook...Senior VP and CCO Tina Faraca has resigned, effective April 9th."
I sure wish they'd get this merger over.
@Heather @pipewelder. I’m a 31 yr employee of this company. My entire career has been focused on the maintenance and integrity of this system. I’m very proud to be third generation with this company. Public safety is utmost priority. Good things are on the horizon. I’m definitely long with ENBL. :)
"Got in deep before the crash, due to health I was not active before or during crash, came back earlyApril huge loss of course, began to buy more ENBL and PAA to help lower my break even still a longway to go. But bought more before the ex date, I am thankful that they only cut dividend by halfOwn some banks CS and Lyg, canceled dividends. PAA making solid comeback, ENBL treading water, a major restraint is 80% ownership by two utilities. So ENBL is a day traders stock.The future however is excellent, the book value is over $16.00 per unit, they remained profitablewhen many companies did not. Natural gas will go higher over the next year as more coal is replaced bygas at electrical plants. They will continue to supply CNP and OGE the captive owners at profitablerates. The world will awake one morning and wish they had locked in a 16% return at the $4 levelImagine owning a long position when the dividend is double and your basis is this low.Not buying this to hold will be a big miss."
When would new shareholders be eligible for quarterly distributions?
Suggested Read: Opinion/Report on ENBL by Seeking Alpha re DISTRIBUTION HALVED BUT NOT ALL HOPE IS LOST
ENBL stock price cheaper then ET. When merger happens owning ENBL should be good thing! 
Definite accumulation here.... all trend lines have been very strong here...need a little more volume as it slowed this afternoon...we are on the big boards today as a top percentage gainer..several mid stream companys had a good day today...The other aspect i like is that nat gas has been showing up strong in the futures....bouncing off of all time lows...and who doesnt like a high payout with the distribution....good investing to all...
Way oversold for some reason. I added shares and will hold long term. It will go in time. JMO
"Enable Midstream Partners, LP (NYSE: ENBL) will release third quarter 2020 financial results before market hours Wednesday, Nov. 4, and will host a conference call at 10 a.m. EST (9 a.m. CST) that day to discuss the results."
"@jennifer and here I sit looking back after a week and will say that you nailed it with TWO. I wish I had looked more carefully and taken a position, nice call and I hope I will do better next time haha. I also missed the huge bull rush on MFA and NYMT.... those were explosive"
Good article on the Drop's impact on the midstream market. Seems longer deb maturities are helpful. https://seekingalpha.com/article/4333353-lower-oil-price-impact-on-midstream-mlps-part-1.
"Intraday the range went high into oversold, hence the rebound lower. On day and week chart we are in a healthy place to continue up tomorrow... just based off of RSI. Heavy volume with a positive trend is a large indicator for continuance, this will finish nice today and better tomorrow... and next week hahaha gl everyone :D"
"Well, I have nothing to say in defense of CNP they gave our value away for peanuts.That said ET did the smartest thing I have seen them do since a stop loss took me outin 2019 and I did not want ET again.One look at the two color overlay of the two companies pipelines shows Enable fills a bighole right in the middle of ET, they will own almost exclusive access to the Fayetteville Shale and considerable assets in the whole Arkoma basin. This hopefully will raise the ET share price.My Best to AllJohn"
"I just spent an hour examining management's presentation and quarterly reports. On the negative side net income was down about 4.9%, gig counts were little lower and EBITA was off 2%. (Because of accounting rules, the income statement is more a statement of change in net worth than actual income.) There is apparently a negative psychology towards upstream side of the industry and an unspoken fear of recession. On the positive side the company has a healthy business, a healthy balance sheet and a secure dividend with a 1.4 coverage. The yield is astronomical and stock price absurdly low. In absence of new negative news, my advice continues to be to buy and reinvest the dividends."
