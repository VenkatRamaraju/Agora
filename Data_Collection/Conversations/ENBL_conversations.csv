"Got in deep before the crash, due to health I was not active before or during crash, came back earlyApril huge loss of course, began to buy more ENBL and PAA to help lower my break even still a longway to go. But bought more before the ex date, I am thankful that they only cut dividend by halfOwn some banks CS and Lyg, canceled dividends. PAA making solid comeback, ENBL treading water, a major restraint is 80% ownership by two utilities. So ENBL is a day traders stock.The future however is excellent, the book value is over $16.00 per unit, they remained profitablewhen many companies did not. Natural gas will go higher over the next year as more coal is replaced bygas at electrical plants. They will continue to supply CNP and OGE the captive owners at profitablerates. The world will awake one morning and wish they had locked in a 16% return at the $4 levelImagine owning a long position when the dividend is double and your basis is this low.Not buying this to hold will be a big miss."
"Enable Midstream Partners, LP (NYSE: ENBL) will file third quarter 2021 results before market hours Monday, Nov. 1. In addition to the Form 10-Q filing, the partnership plans to issue a press release before market hours that day detailing the quarter’s results and recent business highlights."
"Unless the ET buyout is about to blow up, this is bizarre. The only thing that bothers me concerning this is that maybe WS knows something we don’t. Added 3,000 earlier, just added another 2,000. If the options market wakes up, will probably sell some covered calls, although maybe the smarter move is to buy Sep calls, figuring that parity will return, but right now, virtually no action there."
"Meeting Updates: CNP has scheduled 2-hour Dec. 7, 2020 analyst meeting on outlook for ""stakeholders"" following focus on utility-based strategy and recommendations from Business Review committee to its Board of Directors.ENBL'S earnings release and conference scheduled for Nov 4th followed by CNP's and OGE'S next day similar reportings."
"A natural gas pipeline, once built and operating is a money machine. And since the customers are hooked to the infrastructure, they have nowhere else to go. This company is a money machine, and people will regret not getting in at these low prices."
"It sounds like I am one of the few people here that rode this down from over $10. Idid not plan on riding it down but I did not plan on multiple near death problems from January to April so by the time I got back online it was under $2. Did not buy then afraid the real owners CNPand OGE which together own 80% of shares would take it to bankruptcy. But started to buymore near $3 when it seemed ENBL would survive. I had a lot of stocks in trouble to average downPAA, CS, PRU,PFE,ING and many more but lots are now near even or above water just a bit. Having some cash to average down really helped, wishing I had done even more but also wanted some new bargains like NOK, AEG, MO,IMBBY and more. For all of you thinking it won’t go higher, it will not in a straight line but has great upside over time andeven with cut in dividend this is great return. It will go back over $10. sooner than most think, 6 to 9 months. If you look at PAA you will see what a great up trend we will see on this.Hold and you will make a great return over time.Hope this helps you all that are on the line to hold or sell, I will keep most of mine long term. John"
I notice that ENBL has closed the gap between their price and the ET price given the .8595 multiplier. The easy 15 to 20 cent premium has dropped down to 7 to 10 cents. Makes me wonder if that means our next distribution will be from ET?
ENBL holders are being cheated. The .8595 ratio is below the true worth of the stock which in reacting to the merger lost over 6% of its value today. In addition ENBL holders will find their distribution substantially reduced. Only the insiders will benefit from this deal.
"As a former enable employee I’ve talked with many of my friends there. The take over of enable by ET still doesn’t have a firm date. However, all the salaried enable employees have had mini interviews with the ET managers of the group they would be in. Then in June/July they were sent offer letters for continued employment at current position or transfer or demotions or when there last day would be. The hourly employees will not know their status until the deal closes. The deal is continuing but appears to be taking a lot of time to meet all the regulatory requirements. It’s pretty stressful on all of them. This has always been inevitable since CenterPoint created the midstream company back in 2013."
"I hope ET deal busts. We don't need Warren. We don't need DAPL. We don't need debt or huge float or any of that. Please bust. If you must sell, sell to someone else. For $12/unit."
Presentations from Natural Gas Utilities (Center Point Energy presentation starts at 16:20):https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-09zsWJ_52IEncouraging to see that utilities still going to be using and invest in nat gas for the foreseeable future.
"Reminder of two important meetings next week. (1) Monday, 12/07/2020 -starting 10 am Eastern. CNP ..2020 Investor Day and Analyst meeting. (2) WED. DEC 9, 2020 -- ENBL will participate Iin Wells Fargo Midstream & Utility Symposium."
"On February 14 2020 ENBL paid shareholders .331 Dividend. However no mention of a dividend this February except a conference on the 24th of this month. Since no dividend is being announced yet, and we all know that ENBL is up for sale, does anyone have a clue what's may be coming down the pike? This freezing weather in the north east should be a big boost the cash flow. CNP is working and grooming to sell CNP yet I don't have any hint. Except the dividend seems to be up in the air. Any information would be appreciated, clueless"
"I personally am failing to see the short term down trend that so many people are so confident about regarding this stock. Fundamentals are solid with an amazing distribution (different than a dividend, research MLP if you don't know). Additionally there is a high amount of institutional backing. A technical analysis shows a short term bullish trend forming, support has formed and been tested multiple times around 1.82 or so. Looking at various periods such as intraday, daily, and weekly with ADX and MACD it can be observed that a stronger upward trend is developing. I like candles, today at the day period, a bullish engulfing pattern was seen. Volume has shown to be above average for, going from memory here but I think nearly every day in the last 5 trading sessions. Last, pre and post market buyers have been willing to pay above closing for at least the past couple of sessions. Trading strategies are different for each of us but in my novice opinion (I am an engineer by day and trade stocks for fun) this is getting ready to move. It will have ups and downs (beta 1.49) but you have to ask yourself if risking a well leveraged position is worth taking profits now when by so many indications it looks like this stock is just starting to rev its engine. The market was down today but this gains 27%? Any little trickle of positive news related to oil or a good turn between Russia and Saudi Arabia will cause a substantial reaction here. This is of course just my opinion but, I will not let go of my shares so cheaply and risk my well leveraged position when so many compelling bits of evidence tell me this is just the start of a good thing."
"Oil up, natural gas up 300 plus percent but enbl goes nowhere. NG was over $6.Need to double dividend!"
"Enable Midstream Partners, LP (NYSE: ENBL) announced that the board of directors of its general partner declared today a quarterly cash distribution of $0.16525 per unit on all outstanding common units for the quarter ended March 31, 2021. The distribution is unchanged from the previous quarter. The quarterly cash distribution of $0.16525 per unit on all outstanding common units will be paid May 25, 2021, to unitholders of record at the close of business May 13, 2021."
"At least unit price seems to be tracking ET unit price. Just unfortunate timing on the valuation being a few days before that bump up on Tuesday. If you view it as an equal exchange of shares, the question for me is whether the risk with ET is worth staying in (ie Dakota Access shutdown) since ET has upside. I bought in during the lows, so it's not a loss situation for me, just gauging future upside."
Bought some at $1.86. Plenty of upside with solid book value and earnings (should survive). Any other stock suggestions?
Trading at a .10-.15 discount to ET as per the 1 share of ENBL equal to .8595 shares of ET.
"Darn, with the improvement in natural gas prices, was hoping to see restoration of dividend to previous levels. However, I suppose that was optimistic until after the completion of the merger."
"Enable Midstream Partners, LP (NYSE: ENBL) announced that the board of directors of its general partner declared today a quarterly cash distribution of $0.16525 per unit on all outstanding common units for the quarter ended June 30, 2021."
"Earnings Call Announcement for 3rd Qtr results next week, if there is one. We should hear something by Friday. I’m hoping for another Distribution."
"It appears that OGE is working with CNP towards the sale of ENBL. I just got this news:(Bloomberg) -- OGE Energy Corp. has joined CenterPoint Energy Inc. in considering a sale of its stake in Enable Midstream Partners LP, putting the whole oil and gas pipeline company on the block, according to people familiar with the matterThe power companies are working with advisers, said the people, who asked to not be identified because the matter isn’t public. While CenterPoint has openly weighed an exit of Enable for years, OGE Energy is now aligned with that strategy, the people said. No final decision has been made and they could opt to hold on to Enable, they said.Together the companies own all of Enable’s general partner while CenterPoint owns 53.7% of its common units and OGE Energy owns 25.5% of its common units, according to its third-quarter investor presentation. The rest of its common units are held by public investors.Enable rose 1.3% to $4.61 at 10:54 a.m. Tuesday in New York trading, giving the company a market value of about $2.1 billion.A representative for OGE declined to comment. Representatives for Enable and CenterPoint didn’t respond to requests for comment."
Many of the other good midstream partner companies are $5 plus which it wouldn't surprise me if we reach that level in the near future. The confirmed dividend of .16525 next month makes it even that much sweeter.

"$1000.00/$8.16 = 122.549 units times $.661 = $81.00 for ENBL$1000.00/$9.65 = 103.627 units times $.610 = $63.21 for ET$1000.00/$22.81 = 43.84. units times $1.80 = $78.91 for EPDI sold some ET when it was over $10.00 and put it in EPD.I added some money to ENBL.This should help ET.I did say I would be happy just getting my distributions from ENBL.Can hardly wait for third quarter results, should lift all boats.My Best to Everyone John"
"You know, makes me wonder where CNP stands with their “before closing” sale of their proceeds from their sale of ENBL. Do any of the experts on this board know how those mechanics work?"

"Margaret, I read the report by ""Seeking Alpha"" I like the conclusion of it, and copied it ""ConclusionIn conclusion, there are a lot of reasons to be attracted to Enable Midstream today. The company has a reasonably safe business model that is more insulated from commodity price fluctuations than most of its peers and it has even some growth potential that is likely to pan out over the next few years. The company's customer base may not be quite as safe as what some other firms like The Williams Companies have but commodity prices have also rebounded significantly from their bottoms earlier this year. Thus, it does appear that the worst may be behind us at this point. When we combine this with the fact that the company does appear able to easily maintain its 15%+ yield, there could be an opportunity here."
"An off/topic question to Pipewelder and/or John. I own a small acreage (160 acres) plot of rural land in Stone County Arkansas within the boundaries of the Fayetteville Shale. The nearest producing well is about 9 miles away as the crow flies. Just before the FS drilling shutdown a $900/acre bonus was offered but rejected, then almost overnight the FS drilling shut down. The major exploration companies had said way back then that the needed $6 gas to make FS drilling profitable and the Haynesville play had just began and they were hitting some spectacular wells and the drilling was much easier. Here’s my question, given that the gathering/pipeline infrastructure is already in place in the vicinity, what type of ng pricing do you think it would take to see drillers to start back in the FS? I ask because I know lots of other big plays have been established across the nation and the drilling technology has made drilling much cheaper over the last 10 to 12 years. In your opinions, is there any likelihood that FS new exploration and drilling might begin in the area over the next few years? I’ve been thinking about selling the property but would hate to sell it and 6 months later find those fat royalty rights suddenly re-appear, lol?"
"From 3/17 CS report on CNP concerning Enable: “”Enable risks: CNP owns 53.7% of Enable Midstream (ENBL) and receives approximately $300M annual cash distributions that are used to fund regulated capital programs. CNP management notes there is no indication of a distribution cut being contemplated, with ENBL having hedges in place for most of 2020 and over 10K wells connected to the system.... What happens if ENBL cuts its distribution? To be clear, CNP management continues to emphasize that it has received no indication from ENBL that such a cut is being considered, and that ENBL continues to receive a significant portion of its own cash flows from more stable fee-based transportation and storage contracts. “”"
"Well PAA unsurprisingly lost money in the 4th quarter, I think they will do better this year since oil is going to improve, but I only averaged down partially last year and have not continued to add. ENBL I not only averaged down I continued to add, not long to find out if that was smart. WES was has been my best; wish I had bought even more, EPD my other big MLP choice I added a lot and I am very glad I did, will add some more over time.Recently bought SUN and PSXP after getting my vaccine shot, thinking all of us old people will hit the road this spring. SUN went up like a rocket and PSXP fell like a rock, naturally I had bought more of the PSXP.I still think long term PSXP will be a solid choice. I have mentioned before that IMBBY is a buy currently, got all I can have but it is part of my dollar hedge.Pound is now over $1.38 dollars making the next dividend payment over $.66 cents. I mention these things as we all may be looking for places to reinvest if ENBL sells. Not to early to begin reviewing choices. I am thankful this is a solid group of serious people that own ENBL.Best to AllJohn"
"ENBL should be at $7+ given what the comps are doing. Market is waiting for the ""event"" - the news of which is coming in the next 30 days according to CNP. My over/under is $10.50 equity deal with a strategic. That way CNP can feel good about the sales price on a trailing basis (almost 10x EV/EBITDA) and the buyer can easily argue an accretive deal at 8x pro forma for cost and revenue synergies. To quote Ronnie Milsap, ""Any day now"". Elvis sang it too, among others."
"If nothing breaks soon, I’m thinking that we may be receiving another distribution before the sale closes."
Current trading is 0.28 discount to ET ENBL at 7.36 and ET is 8.89
ET needs to be at $7.57 per share for ENBL unit holders to break even as of today.
Up about $.20 today and still selling at a $.14 discount.
"Energy Transfer and Enable expect the transaction to close in mid-2021, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including Hart-Scott-Rodino clearance.And the market goes wild, or not. Margaret haha. I’ve never held shares/units of anything that sold and the shareholders received nothing for the effort. ￼￼￼"
"ET. ...Stay home. Let's hope this ""deal"" gets killed. ENBL can find other partners with better skill sets."
"I posted over on the ET board about the record setting Texas Electricity usage multiple days and the whole region is hot. The third quarter will be very strong and we may not freeze my Grandson’s river in Texas but it will be a cold winter as well. Merger or not ENBL is making money and I like my distributions.I also am praying for our people left in harms way by a failed human, this is beyond political it’s evil.All of us here are blessed and I am thankful to all our military trying so hard in this sad time.My Best to Everyone John"
