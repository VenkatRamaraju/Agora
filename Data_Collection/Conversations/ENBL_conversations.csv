"As a former enable employee I’ve talked with many of my friends there. The take over of enable by ET still doesn’t have a firm date. However, all the salaried enable employees have had mini interviews with the ET managers of the group they would be in. Then in June/July they were sent offer letters for continued employment at current position or transfer or demotions or when there last day would be. The hourly employees will not know their status until the deal closes. The deal is continuing but appears to be taking a lot of time to meet all the regulatory requirements. It’s pretty stressful on all of them. This has always been inevitable since CenterPoint created the midstream company back in 2013."
Current trading is 0.28 discount to ET ENBL at 7.36 and ET is 8.89
"Enable Midstream Partners, LP (NYSE: ENBL) announced that the board of directors of its general partner declared today a quarterly cash distribution of $0.16525 per unit on all outstanding common units for the quarter ended Sept. 30, 2021. The distribution is unchanged from the previous quarter. The quarterly cash distribution of $0.16525 per unit on all outstanding common units will be paid Nov. 17, 2021, to unitholders of record at the close of business Nov. 8, 2021."
"I posted over on the ET board about the record setting Texas Electricity usage multiple days and the whole region is hot. The third quarter will be very strong and we may not freeze my Grandson’s river in Texas but it will be a cold winter as well. Merger or not ENBL is making money and I like my distributions.I also am praying for our people left in harms way by a failed human, this is beyond political it’s evil.All of us here are blessed and I am thankful to all our military trying so hard in this sad time.My Best to Everyone John"
"ET. ...Stay home. Let's hope this ""deal"" gets killed. ENBL can find other partners with better skill sets."
"An off/topic question to Pipewelder and/or John. I own a small acreage (160 acres) plot of rural land in Stone County Arkansas within the boundaries of the Fayetteville Shale. The nearest producing well is about 9 miles away as the crow flies. Just before the FS drilling shutdown a $900/acre bonus was offered but rejected, then almost overnight the FS drilling shut down. The major exploration companies had said way back then that the needed $6 gas to make FS drilling profitable and the Haynesville play had just began and they were hitting some spectacular wells and the drilling was much easier. Here’s my question, given that the gathering/pipeline infrastructure is already in place in the vicinity, what type of ng pricing do you think it would take to see drillers to start back in the FS? I ask because I know lots of other big plays have been established across the nation and the drilling technology has made drilling much cheaper over the last 10 to 12 years. In your opinions, is there any likelihood that FS new exploration and drilling might begin in the area over the next few years? I’ve been thinking about selling the property but would hate to sell it and 6 months later find those fat royalty rights suddenly re-appear, lol?"
"$1000.00/$8.16 = 122.549 units times $.661 = $81.00 for ENBL$1000.00/$9.65 = 103.627 units times $.610 = $63.21 for ET$1000.00/$22.81 = 43.84. units times $1.80 = $78.91 for EPDI sold some ET when it was over $10.00 and put it in EPD.I added some money to ENBL.This should help ET.I did say I would be happy just getting my distributions from ENBL.Can hardly wait for third quarter results, should lift all boats.My Best to Everyone John"
"Oil up, natural gas up 300 plus percent but enbl goes nowhere. NG was over $6.Need to double dividend!"
"If nothing breaks soon, I’m thinking that we may be receiving another distribution before the sale closes."
"Unless the ET buyout is about to blow up, this is bizarre. The only thing that bothers me concerning this is that maybe WS knows something we don’t. Added 3,000 earlier, just added another 2,000. If the options market wakes up, will probably sell some covered calls, although maybe the smarter move is to buy Sep calls, figuring that parity will return, but right now, virtually no action there."
ENBL holders are being cheated. The .8595 ratio is below the true worth of the stock which in reacting to the merger lost over 6% of its value today. In addition ENBL holders will find their distribution substantially reduced. Only the insiders will benefit from this deal.
"Enable Midstream Partners, LP (NYSE: ENBL) announced that the board of directors of its general partner declared today a quarterly cash distribution of $0.16525 per unit on all outstanding common units for the quarter ended June 30, 2021."
Up about $.20 today and still selling at a $.14 discount.
"I hope ET deal busts. We don't need Warren. We don't need DAPL. We don't need debt or huge float or any of that. Please bust. If you must sell, sell to someone else. For $12/unit."
Trading at a .10-.15 discount to ET as per the 1 share of ENBL equal to .8595 shares of ET.
"You know, makes me wonder where CNP stands with their “before closing” sale of their proceeds from their sale of ENBL. Do any of the experts on this board know how those mechanics work?"
"Earnings Call Announcement for 3rd Qtr results next week, if there is one. We should hear something by Friday. I’m hoping for another Distribution."
"Darn, with the improvement in natural gas prices, was hoping to see restoration of dividend to previous levels. However, I suppose that was optimistic until after the completion of the merger."
I notice that ENBL has closed the gap between their price and the ET price given the .8595 multiplier. The easy 15 to 20 cent premium has dropped down to 7 to 10 cents. Makes me wonder if that means our next distribution will be from ET?
"Enable Midstream Partners, LP (NYSE: ENBL) will file third quarter 2021 results before market hours Monday, Nov. 1. In addition to the Form 10-Q filing, the partnership plans to issue a press release before market hours that day detailing the quarter’s results and recent business highlights."
