"I'm starting to think the oil melt down was one big shake out, $7.50 soon"
"One Day, YES One Day. Folks will be waking up to see NG @ $6+ & OIL @ $80+and the $BSM $CDEV $AM $PAA $PSXP $ET ( HIGH DIVIDEND ENERGY STKS )UP BIG TIME from current levels. 30% upside in all of these within 2-3 months isHIGHLY LIKELY IMHO. Good Luck 2all !!"
"Stop selling, we want at least 5.6 by the end of the day."
I'm buying 30k more shares at the close. Who wants to join me?
Woo hoo. Buying at the close. Let's keep it up.
GS still maintains oil at $80 by EOY
$CPEWe were doing well until Larry Ballz bought back in yesterday per his post
"As long as the SEC allows algos and computers to buy and sell stocks, you're going to get these crazy day to day rotations which make absolutely no sense and turn stocks into pinball machines. $CDEV"
$LPI $CPE $CDEV Who's ready for round 2?
Possibility we get a pullback to 4.60ish tomorrow. If we remain below 5.40 I still see 12$ before we see any lower than 3.91 struck a week ago.
How would $LPI $CDEV $CPE $MTDR $BCEI do if oil goes to $60?Wall street is taking oil to $60 I am afraid :-(
"$LPI, $CPE, $CDEV Prediction: small cap oil companies are going to RIP in the next couple weeks. (And I don't mean R.I.P :) )"
"Harry, did you get back in fully yet or waiting for OPEC? I remember you saying you lighted up your load. I am thinking regardless of Opec’s decision, the market will find a way to spin it negatively"
If this is over delta variant fears then why is oil now up? This is nothing more than blatant manipulation and panic selling.
"Great news!""350million Americans have been vaccinated "" - Mr SleepyThat 106%. Goal reached!$CPE $LPI"
Right now oil is going to be at the mercy of the delta. Could be a rough week. Long term CDEV holders survived spring 2020 and we can survive this. Temporary pain for long term rewards.
I am so ready to feast on shorts
Oil breaking support at 65. I want to get back in but the timing doesn't feel right yet. Still waiting for the right moment.
I really enjoyed this more when it was at $7…..
"Cowen Lifts Centennial Resource Development to Market Perform From Underperform, Price Target to $5.75 From $4"
$CPE $LPI $CDEVEveryone thank Drew.C for excellent gas stock pick
"CDEV is not anymore like before with almost 50% of the production hedged at around 64$, compared to LPI with 80%/50$ 2021 and 2022 and the worst is SM for 47$/brl. I don't care anymore about COVID19"
Remember 2022 will be the year of increased production. And it will be needed.
4.75 should be very strong support as that is the 200MA. If this gets to 4.80 then buy will both hands.
"CDEV has made no progress in its share price since March. Look at how much high oil is. Complete, total disconnect between oil stocks and oil. I've never seen anything like it."
"This drop better not be because people are listening to the media about another variant and possible shut downs. If so, we have greater concerns than CDEV being down. What has society become?"
"Strange how the variant only effects oil, as the DOW remains near record highs. $CPE $LPI"
I made my first purchase here today I also bought AR on a big Drop I will continue to add if these will continue to drop natural gas is in a huge bull market for the next several years the ebbs and flows will create buying opportunities the bottom line is the day of cheap energy is over for several reasons yes there is a lot of oil and natural gas but at what price this is all going to be fed through the pipeline of inflation in everything you buy and do this is a finite resource that is going to cost a lot more money to find and bring to the market when you get buying opportunities like this take a vantage of them because a long term trend is up.
Oil needs to close above 70$
Looks good. Only 3$ down from the top.Imagine buying this at 1$ and seeing 3x your cost basis evaporate.Must feel accomplishing.
"Just curious Mr. Ballz, do you own anything at the moment and how much are you down since July? You don't have to answer but I'm still trying to learn."
"The world's biggest container ship, the Ever Ace, is continuing its maiden voyage this week and soon heading for the Suez Canal. No false moves Captain!!!!$MRO $REI $CDEV"
"$CPE $LPI $CDEV Can't wait for Herd Immunity in a couple weeks, so Fauci and Media fear tactics will become irrelevant, and oil can recover. I wonder what they will think of next. It's time for Joe's dementia to be in the news. No more distractions."
"Sad that there were deaths....MEXICO CITY, Aug 23 (Reuters) - A fire that struck an offshore oil platform operated by Mexico's state-run Pemex cut the company's production by 444,000 barrels per day (bpd) due to the lack of natural gas to re-inject into crude fields, a company document showed on Monday.At least one person died and five others were missing following an explosion on Sunday at Pemex's E-Ku-A2 platform, part of a gas-processing center of the Ku-Maloob-Zaap complex in the Gulf of Mexico's Bay of Campeche. $CPE $LPI"
I lightened up today. There's a chance CDEV could pull back before going higher. I'll keep watching to see what happens.
CDEV getting walked lower by shorts. Slow gradual slide is their trademark pattern. I might pick up a few shares here.
"$REI $CDEV $MROGlobal Oil Demand to Exceed Pre-Pandemic Levels Next Year, OPEC SaysCartel raises forecast for 2022, citing travel reboundIn its closely watched monthly market report, OPEC raised its forecast for global oil demand for 2022 by just under a million barrels a day to 100.8 million barrels a day, higher than 2019’s demand level of 100.3 million barrels. OPEC had previously forecast a return to 2019 demand levels in the second half of next year, but Monday’s report was the first time the cartel said it expects a return to pre-Covid-19 levels for the full year."
$LPI $CPE $CDEV What happened? China loaded up on cheap oil and now released some good news for a rebound?
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bp-interim-results-dividend-share-repurchase-buyback-oil-profit-revenue-income-073731829.html
NM and WT there is a boom going on. This stock deserves some upgrades. They should be coming soon!
I'm starting to see the formation of what technicians call a descending wedge on the CDEV short term chart. These are usually bullish formations indicating that selling momentum is running out of strength. We could see a reversal soon that will be quick and sharp.
It's confirm. There is no correlation between cdev stock price and wti price. So this stock is a toss up. Just flip a coin and invest. Been holding this since it was at 0.87. Will hold longer until it reaches my 10x target.
Based on Bloomberg Saudis will delay the 400K increase they agreed on. Good news. Plus now 1 million Americans getting vaccinated compared to 200K last month. I am confident a rally is coming. Just a matter of time
"$LPI, $CPE, $CDEV Big Oil buying stock back! Great sign!!!"
Check out FERN was turned on to it from the same guy that turned me to Cdev I’m not a stock guru so everyone’s opinion/ thoughts I welcome .

bout to feast on shorts. Clarissa is the cherry on top
China expected to increase imports second half of year. Taking advantage of lower crude prices which they help manipulate down. $CPE $LPI
Bee is back trying to make you panic sell again!!! Where was she when it hit 7.50 no where she trolled another stock trying their holders to sell at a loss so her backers could buy it up and make the big money!!!
July job report tomorrow. Based on data released today it should be solid. Congress about to pass infrastructure bill and put America back to work
Bloodbath. When will the nightmare stop. Oil stocks getting killed. Is there a bottom??? Will they find another covid variant again next week and keep destroying oil stocks????
Well boys and girls I look forward to selling my 80K shares for 12$ within the next 6 months.
Still watching before I buy shares. I was planning to buy this morning but the weakness in oil made me wait. Oil has now held support at 66 three times and rallied but oil stocks don't bounce when oil does and that's troubling. It suggests further weakness. I'll keep watching for the right entry point.
"Some info for the clueless among us. If the market doesn't care about rising oil, why would it care about earnings which are an extension of higher oil prices? Think about it."
$CPE $LPI $CDEV$KLXE is about to reach the moon in the next few days. I will post my next comment from the moon surface. CHEERS
"$LPI $CPE $CDEV Yahoo deleted my post a few minutes after I wrote it. It was about Rona D being near its peak, and it had a hopeful, positive tone. I guess anything positive and hopeful is ""health misinformation""."
Harry you called the top at 7 and I wish I had listened to you. Still holding 2500 shares. What's the best thing to do now in your opinion?
We are showing signs of stretching the upper limit of that trading range though. We really need to see oil break 70. That would propel us upwards.
There’s the 3
How are we not up at least 6% today with WTI at $73.40?
Why did oil just drop ?
https://www.marketwatch.com/story/winter-weather-could-send-oil-to-100-per-barrel-bank-of-america-analysts-say-11631526876?cx_testId=22&cx_testVariant=cx_1&cx_artPos=1&mod=home-page-cx#cxrecs_s
I'll be back on Monday and I will be buying shares at that time. This sell off is overdone again.
They lost money because of debt repayment? Am I reading this correctly.
$LPI $CPE $CDEVI am glad you all made money:). Only the start
BUYING MORE ! $6+ 14-30day PT.
"Very tentative buying today. Investors are shell shocked and being very cautious and who can blame them after the last two weeks of drubbing? If you're nervous, buy in slowly and cost average in. Just keep in mind where we are and where we were. CDEV was almost 8 per share. Others like $CPE, $LPI, and $MTDR were 20 to 30% higher just last week. LPI 40% higher. Oil has only corrected 15% and held its medium term support uptrend at 66 - 67. There's a huge potential for profit at these levels and a large ceiling above us now. Buy what you're comfortable with at the moment with an open eye to buy more as confidence returns."
Why the EPS miss? I didn't hear the conference on guidance. Was a reason given?
"A good way to cover up and manipulate positive earnings in oil over the past two weeks is to tank the wti and futures to make oil seem invaluable. At the same time hedgies and big boys loading the boat. Makes sense right??? Cdev should be interesting this quarter, we didn’t loose power and a portion of production this quarter due to freeze. Brent up over $70. Hedges % tapering down. Hedge $$$ is increasing. Shaping up to be great 2H 2021. Don’t miss the flight. $cpe $lpi $gte"
Just added another 30k shares. Momentum appears to be building towards 5. Keep adding shares into strength.
You know what I like?
WTI still has solid support in the $66.50 area. Bulls and bears battling at that line like Elias and Barnes fighting for possession of America's soul.IIII$cdev $mro $lpi $rig
Wish I had listened to harry and could be sitting on the beach watching from the sidelines. Oh well. Live and learn. When you coming back HB?
"false flag event in the mid east soon & the start hurricane season in the Gulf will send oil higher by labor day, CDEV will rip higher. Buy the dip"
"Back of the envelope math says 60,000 bpd production at 45.00 cost, hedged at 65.00 per barrel creates 15. to 20. per barrel profit. That is 900,000 to 1,200,000. per day. Call it 300,000,000 per year. Over a dollar a share profit.What is wrong with that?"
"See how systematically they walk down oil stocks with total impunity for the endless naked shorting!! Been happening for years and of course SEC is a 1-legged cripple sitting and staring from a wheelchair! Lets see how $CPE, $SM, $CDEV, $RIG, $LPI etc. do by the end of the year."
$LPI $CDEV $CPEWe have been given another damn opportunity to build wealth!! Let’s not get disappointed if next week we don’t see a dramatic boom. But it will surely start to go up. AND COVID FDA BOOST APPROVAL NEXT WEEK.
Harry B down a ton. Margin calls
"If they're utilizing profits to reduce debt, I have no problem with that. But why the reduction in oil production? I assume it's because they still don't have all their wells online. Also, why so many hedges in the 60s when oil has been to 77 per barrel? It looks like it costs CDEV around 45 dollars to produce a barrel of oil so they should be taking in the profits at this point."
"@willLots of interesting plays, I prefer USA permian WTI driven vs any foreign Brent stocks. Producers for now & if you have lots of cap & are willing to wait , service companies are a future play. ( CDEV, LPI, MTDR, REI, SM ) (( TTI, NR, ICD, TELL, TRCH)) ((( RIG, RECAF, CPE, MRO, ESTE, TALO?, CPG, USWS )))"
Looks like 1 final shake-out before earnings. Hold on to your shares tightly and reap the rewards in the not to distant future.
The last rally we had on API numbers was the last report which showed a build. I wonder what happens tomorrow?
Just enjoying my vacation...
It is official OPEC+ will not increase supply. No to the walking mummy
Coming back above the 200MA. Come on CDEV!
"When gasoline powered cars and ICE engines were being invented and sold, those that tried to invest in and hold on to horse buggy manufacturers were left behind, in the dust. A century later, EV, solar, wind using the same playbook against the oil industry as the Polluter in Chief . Auto industry won't be affected that much as ride share will still be around. $CDEV, $SM, $RIG, $GTE, $KOS many of these stocks will be left by the wayside sooner or later."
I was watching a Gunsmoke episode yesterday. There on my television was a young William Devane playing an outlaw. What was he trying to steal? Gold. This reminded me that history doesn't repeat itself but it often rhymes. Think about that when you see the current sell off in oil stocks and how this relates to what happened in 2019 and 2020 and what could happen going forward. $CPE $MTDR $LPI
Next stop 12$ gap fill it will be time to sell again. Right now is time to BUY BUY BUY
"Beat up and down, but not out! Hold for gold my fellow oil barons."
"The pullback in oil stock valuations was far more drastic than the drop in the price of WTI. I think that earnings are about to start mattering. IMHO even if crude prices stayed the same, CPE, $CDEV, $LPI, $MRO, $MTDR $REI and drillers like $RIG and $KLXE would have risen unless Delta got really bad. That was a blow off bottom, so to speak."
Did Powell actually say things that could help the market? Wow. No market crash this fall. $CPE $LPI
I grabbed some shares on the dip to 5.10 but I'm not sure where we're headed here. We really need oil to push higher and it's obvious that traders and other forces are keeping it range bound for the time being.
Gonna be a great next few months/years for CDEV....Recent Financial and Operational HighlightsGenerated Company record free cash flow and reduced total debt outstandingImproved leverage metrics significantly quarter-over-quarterIncreased daily crude oil production 13% compared to the prior quarterDelivered solid well results from the Northern and Southern Delaware BasinsContinued to drive strong operational efficienciesAdded 2022 oil hedges at attractive prices
"For a guy who seems to be right a whole lot, Harry Ballz sure gets a lot of criticism. LMAO. You called it again kind sir. Good post yesterday. And thanks for the tip. I bought more shares on your rec."
$LPI $CPE $CDEVCRUDE already up. Treasury yield will follow soon early this week. AND FDA approval will be the desired catalyst. Cheers
Oil up a dollar. Could we at least close in the green please?
Wow that dip below 5 was bought quick at market open. Let's see if it can close over 5 even if oil is down.
It doesn't help matters that CDEV is the worst performing of all the oils I follow. With WTI at nearly 74.
Safe to say $8 by end of year
"Hate the weekends now as I know the news outlets will say how the delta continues to get worse, sending oil crashing on Monday. $CPE $LPI"
"Oil is being shorted heavily, buy in increments if you can, but most importantly don't sell. This difference between oil price and oil companies price will eventually close. They are doing this on purpose, they want your shares cheap because they know where this is heading. Be patient and stop watching the market daily unless you plan on buying. it is a psychological game, they know if you see oil up and your stocks going down you will believe your investment is no good...and you will sell. Fear is their only weapon, if you don't sell, you will not lose. Have a good day."

Trading Oil stocks is a specialty. Think of a Chef vs a Pastry Chef so same essential function but different ingredients. OG stocks price action MOVE in very specific & relatively predictable ways.

Brian said CDEV at $10 by end of year. I agree
CDEV wasn't ever this low when oil was at 66 a couple weeks ago. I warned we would see new lows on the next pullback in oil. Unfortunately I was right again.
What’s the story today Harry?? Any good news
Cdev hit the most oversold since March 2020 and the 1 day macd is turned All the way UP
"If anyone is bored and looking for a high risk but also high reward play, SAVA is back down under 60 on some BS rumors being spread by shorts. Last time this happened I rode it up from 69 to 120 almost."
FDA today officially approved Pfizer covid vaccine. This is huge. And OPEC to meet September 1st. Saudis are about to prove they are in charge of the oil market and not Wall St. I do not think they will cut but they will delay planned increases for 3 months
"Unless China is completely wiped off from the world stage, socio-economically and politically it will continue to hold the world hostage to its demagoguery and malicious intent. Its the enemy of the entire globe and needs to be reined in much more than any other pretend nonsense in the mideast. Yet, China and CCP own the politicians , Wall St. and Silicon Valley! So addicted are Americans to cheap Made in China consumption they prefer to be enslaved forever. $CPE, $LPI, $CDEV, $GTE, $KOS are headed to the graveyard as surely as the sun rises every day. America itself headed there too in next 10 years under the DC woke crowd."
"I took a look at Clarissa TS's stock picks and none look interesting to me. To be honest, I can't seem to find anything that looks like a good buy right now. Everything appears to be in a downtrend in a very sloppy market. Oil stocks are way oversold but don't look like they've bottomed yet. Oil keeps getting pushed lower. Small caps look like dog sheet. Biotechs are falling apart. Even my favorite play SAVA now looks toppy. The market feels ripe for a sizable correction and judging by stock activity, needs one badly to reset the uptrends. I'm going to stay mostly in cash for the time being and see what happens."
I just picked up 50k shares at this price. Playing a hunch that we're near a bottom. If it goes against me I will have a tight stop but the risk - reward seems favorable now.
"$CPE $CDEVJason, if I had a house by the beach, I would be so occupied with different broads and entertainments that I wouldn’t care about a character named “gladiator” or posting everyday about it. Broadcasting “luxury” lifestyle on YAHOO got to be the most convincing indicator suggesting to the contrary:)"
"It looks like CDEV has hedged about 50% of their oil production for 3rd and 4th q in the low $50 range.and approx 30% or so for the 1st and 2nq of '22 in the mid $60 range. Debt maturities are all pushed out to '26, 27, amd '28. FCF is trending high and may end the year almost 50% higher than earlier forecastedfrom $50-$75m to $140-$170, leverage moving from forecasted 2.5 to 2.0.....basically pretty good results.Down $.48 looks like a good place to put some more $."
Oil bottomed at 66 three weeks ago and CDEV hit 5.20. It failed to rally when oil rallied to 74 and I warned we were in big trouble on the next pullback in oil prices. Now oil is back down to 68. Still 2 dollars above its low last month. Where's CDEV? 4.50 and headed lower. I've seen this movie play out many times in my trading career. How do we know when the bottom is in? When oil stocks start to outperform oil instead of underperforming as they are doing now. That's what we need to watch for. A chart contrasting WTI performance vs. the oil indexes would be a useful thing right now.
Tutes catching all your shares right here. Anyone noticing??
Excelente earnings!
"Hurricane Henri is bearing down on my beach home in Cape Code. I'll have to spend my weekend getting my yacht into safe harbor now instead of relaxing like I had planned. If you live in the path of the storm, stay safe and do what you have to to protect your property. I bought back into $CDEV on Friday because I feel that we're at or near a bottom. Might take a new position in CPE and $MTDR as well next week. We'll see what happens with oil."
"HB, When is the jump back in point"
Tard J bought at 4.00 could have sold above 7.00 but didn't look what greed did to hum
We had 4 tops that occurred between 6/15 and 7/12 at a price range of $6.90 to $7.50Harry how could we be forming multiple tops in the low $5's ??
"Seems like $CPE is a goner for now. Won't see 40-50 for a long time, let alone 60 and anyhow, its just $3.34 when adjusted for the 1:10 reverse split last year. Comparatively, $LPI woes are behind it despite the debt and the new notes outstanding. $CDEV, $REI, $SM are the strongest of the small and mid cap oils. Nothing even comes close to Matador MTDR however, in a class of its own. Ignore wannabes like TALO, GTE, ESTE, OAS, etc. they aren't going anywhere in a hurry."
Just an innocent question. Someone on vacation in the Hamptons posts regularly on yahoo board? You would think someone riding an Aston Martin would be occupied enough to not care or post on yahoo.
just started a position I think the retracement is just about done if it drops more I will continue to add this will be a big mover in the not too distant future
If I hear one more yahoo say wait until earnings I think I'm going to scream.
$CPE $CDEV $SBOWOil reached $70 folks. Now let’s hope it retains the gain and goes higher tomorrow. Sensing a good week ahead
CDEV is very profitable at 70 dollar oil but all the market sees is oil is going down so CDEV gets kicked again. The myopic nature of the market is incredible sometimes. They can't see the bigger picture. Always distracted by trivialities like a cat chasing a lazer light around the room.
Harry B sold yesterday. Too busy on his yacht
"$CPE $LPI $CDEV All bashing aside, can someone objectively explain what's going on with CPE, and why it's lagging other small cap oil stocks?The acquisition was unexpected? They were supposed to pay off debt but instead increased it?To me the acquisition seems good at this time when oil is up, they can pump extra oil and sell at unhedged prices. Didn't LPI do the same thing? What am I missing?"
Me celebrating today after the rally in oil stocks
Does CDEV have another 15%+ day left in her sometime this year?
My wag. Either we gap over 5.40 resisistence on Monday or the market has a correction and we target 4.60ish either way we hit 12$ this year. So Cheers everyone!
$CPE $CDEV $LPIDowntrend is done by tomorrow. I will be loading up big tomorrow near end
Nice bounce today. Is it for real though is the question. SAVA getting close to 100 per share. My buy recommendation at 69 looking good.
The IEA just raised their oil price outlook for 2022.
"The pattern that you see here is not unique to oil stocks, I have other plays and they are behaving similarly. Eg: $tell, yesterday news about a agreement with Shel were released and the stock almost reached 20% increase to sell completely today, $obsv had a 500m agreement signed 2 days ago... today just returned to pre agreement price. Oil is up...oil plays are down...if you have only invested in small caps as i am, you are probably red, my total investments are moving around the same average for the last month, which i attribute to the MM playing around trying to collect as many shares as possible before letting the market run. Same thing happened last year around this time, i did not sell, and by February i tripled my $. Point is, the MM cannot hold this market captive forever, they will eventually let it run, so keep you shares, buy more if you can and relax. Remedy this is a psychological game, if you let them into your mind they will win. Good luck."
I was more upset today than I've been in a long time. I wasn't feeling well which made me cranky and then I watched two perfect trades blow up despite my being right in what I foresaw oil doing. The only problem is the stocks were manipulated down with oil soaring to 72. I still can't believe that happened it's so bizarre. So I got angry because I felt ripped off and cheated. My apologies for the ranting.
Oil now over 72 per barrel. This is twilight zone stuff.
"I attempted to estimate 3rdQ EPS and provoke further discussions to better understand CDEV's 3rdQ prospects. I used the following assumptions;-Production flat with 2nq-Same differentials of $5.07 (oil) and .33 (NG)-Same costs except for debt ext charge of $22M and derivatives of $54.9m I assumed the $22M charge was not a reoccurring expense and I used the new derivative hedges outlined for 3rdQ. I'm not sure of the right number for impairment but I used the 2ndQ number. Also I used 2nq's interest expense that should be lower in the 3rq due to the deleveraging that has taken place.-I used an avg mkt price for oil of $69, $3.67 for ng and $30 for NGL in my 3rdq calculations (apprx avg of Jl and Aug).-Used shares outstanding of 279m.With these assumptions, I came out with an EPS (incls differentials and derivatives) of $.13. I know this is an educated guess, but would welcome additional input to help make this number more accurate. If you eliminate the $22m debt ext charge in 2nd q, the 3rdq would be $.13 better than the 2nd. This estimate also falls between the analysis estimates but below the avg est. Key questions...what will the impairment and interest costs be as well will production be flat with 2ndq?Critiques welcome....just pinned down after hurricane IDA and thought I'd try to drill down on one my stocks. K"
Oil giving a Bollinger Bands buy signal here. Looks like we may be setting up for an oil rally next week.
"Assuming average oil price of $62 for the next 52-weeks (I know it will be higher, but assume for now), and knowing the hedges, what would be earnings of CPE, $LPI, $CDEV?"
Im long in CDEV myself in since sub $1.00 our girl cDevil REALLY digs & sticks to the 20s meaning 1.20 2.20 3.20 4.20 5.20 and that level / floor / support will have Bounce Ranges so .15 to .35 give or take. If things go well tommorow maybe 5.18 5.19 5.29 to 5.36 5.40 5.44 range on the high side. Once we get comfortably at 5.25 5.35 ad a floor for some duration ... that is a sign of strength & the upward price action should follow not long after. I do chart stuff & specialize in levels.
"Clearly, clearly Cowen's upgrade makes no difference, there were plenty of upgrades and PT to 7.50+ when CDEV was trading in the 6's and 7's now we're knocking on the 3 dollar door! Upgrade means analysts need more time to get out and short! JMO"
"I am long on this, so this little turbulence for the past month does not shake me. This will rise and be over 5.00 a share by mid-September or even more!!! HOLD LONG AND BE PROSPEROUS!!!"
I'm a buyer @ 5.38 into the close - Raymond James says PT of $10 I'm only accumulating - energy sector still very strong & it only takes one screw up in the middle east to send us to $100+
"Drop has little to do with earnings. All oil stocks getting battered again this morning as capitulation takes place in the oil sector. By the way, when the numbers are adjusted, CDEV earned 2 cents per share. This is the second time in the last four they've had a slight earnings miss, not the third time."
Where are the tards that were saying CDEV will test new lows in the 3s? Pounding Sand?
I am confident cdev is heading back up after earnings next week. This company gets stronger every quarter.
If your asking your self why god why!? R E L A X 12$ within next 3 months.
"Just a few moments ago, there was a Citi analyst of commodities on CNBC.He said all the commodities, which have come down - they are buyers of commodities, especially copper and OIL.When asked by the CNBC anchor ""Would you buy the dip"", he said 'absolutely'.On the other hand, Cathy Wood of the ARK investments was on earlier and she said the commodities have gone down and will continue to go down because the dollar index is up.Thoughts? $CPE $CDEV $OIH"
"CDEV Q2 earnings report was disappointing ( to say the least ) making another loss with oil prices in the $70 to $75 for majority of this year, is a not going to provide investors with much confidence. Management decided to pay down debt ( 35M ), in preference to scaling up production. I don't understand why they choose to hedge 45% of oil production for the next 2 years at below current spot prices, its a gamble and that same gamble hurt them last year when they hedged prices at $28, effectively missing as much as $20pb lower on spot prices. IMO management have taken another ultra conservative and ultimately underwhelming & disappointing approach to the next 2 years."
who else is loading the boat here?
Load up boys and girls cause
This doesnt scare me one bit. I was loading daily at $.65 when WTI’s in the $30s.
"Can CDEV go to it's All Time Highs ?Strong debate there. I say yes. Arguing fundamentals will not change some things that might make that happen.Oil spike from supply shortage.Low float run.1 of 2 PERMIAN PLAYS under $5.00 ishWhen the generalist trader WANTS to jump on board with an oil trade where are they gonna GO for a good volume value play ... CPE ... LPI ... MTDR ??? No way I think. Generalist traders want cheap so ... CDEV & REI ... all the way.Cpe, lpi, mtdr ... too expensive for most and many.So 85% probability I think CDEV does an MTDR breach ATH"
"Well... at least my SAVA and RBLX were up today. As for CDEV, I'm down to a token number of shares just so I can monitor the stock. I'm in no hurry to buy back in right now. Delta, dropping oil, fall season approaching, all negatives on the horizon. Keep your powder dry and wait for a better and safer opportunity to add shares."
Just checking in. Everything looks good. I still see $12 this winter.
Added another 20k shares midday. Let's see if this rally holds up and we push towards 5.
"What will be the effect of FED tapering on oil prices and the prices of CPE, $LPI, $CDEV, $SM $MTDR?Looks to me the market lowering the price expectations on oil and these stocks' prices."
"Build in API due to imports and who cares about API anyway. Let's see what EIA reports. Even if EIA reports a good draw, still be ready for manipulation with oil stocks. Big boys know oil is going to run and are building their positions as they scare off paper hands."
15 years worth of oil inventory @45 per barrel cost = huge profits if oil stays strong. Stop with the sub-70 hedging!
"@HarryBallz,thinking 90K shares CDEV right now under 5.05 What do you think ?"
"$CPE $CDEVI have been saying this for a while now but some think I’m a loop but keep wondering why for ex today was a down day. TREASURY YILED-DOLLAR PERFORMANCE. It is %4 down today. If yield goes up tomorrow, so will the O&G stocks"

"Imagine buying in under 50 cent and selling next year for over 10….. Let’s try again Imagine not bringing any real value to this board…… And againImagine calling every Juan by the same homonym….. sad life…. On a more positive note. Cdev next maturity is in 2026. Long way off with these elevated crude prices. After this socialistic scare tactic to manipulate the unvaccinated with the delta variant, we will see new high. Sit back and enjoy the ride folks. GLTA and CDEV "
Why is everyone tripping about crude price? It literally has zero affect on what cdev does.There have been multiple times where crude was much lower and cdev was 3 times higher than where it is now. I'm confused still

"All my other oils red except for CDEV, let’s goooo"
We're getting close to an inflection point. It's coming and these beaten up oil stocks will rally dramatically into the winter months. I'm looking for a repeat of last year.
after the News-Release -I'm a buyer @ 4.85 - this stk rocks& has bright future -
The spread between oil stocks and the price of oil just continues to get wider and wider. Something's gotta give sooner or later. $MTDR reported blow out earnings and is down today. With oil up!
All market bleeding.. Dont panic
"The Company reported a net loss during the quarter of $25.1 million, or $0.09 per diluted share.They still cant produce a profit at +$70 oil..???"
"I like $CDEV & $BSM ( the dividend this qtr is .25, .05 bonus over .80 annual )Raymond James has a PT of $16 on the $10.50 stk.$CDEV could easily be a $6.50-$7 stk within a few months as well.Some large commercial funds & pensions are accumulating good positions in $BSM due to the dividend.Again, it only takes one small ""incident"" in the Middle East to send this printing press into PANIC MODE.Today was a Great Day to accumulate LOTS of shares : )"
"What are your thoughts Harry? Looks like 7,8,9 calls for October are finished. Maybe even December."
Why is WTI going down today?
"Quote from Fauci. Read last paragraph for why cases are going up all of a sudden. $CPE $LPI ""The average number of new cases reported each day has nearly doubled in the past 10 days and the number of hospitalized patients in many states is surging, according to a Reuters analysis. At the same time, the number of Americans getting vaccinated has increased.“The silver lining of this is that people are waking up to this and this may be a tipping point for those who have been hesitant (to get vaccinated)”"
"SM has the highest hedge among small oilers. The earning just reported last Thursday was not good at all. However it has a little pop last 2 trading sessions. I am guessing LPI CDEV and even CPE will do much better as lower hedging ratio. Let's expect some rally after the earnings. Hopefully in 2 weeks, all of these small oilers will back up to the spots where they should be. They are essentially printing money given WTI over $70."
"Bulls keep jabbering about buying this at 60 cents, now have lost 5x their cost basis in profits.Makes one wonder why buy a stock of you are going to watch all your gains evaporate just like that? What is the point? And no don’t talk about “long term” BS, because we all see the long term chart of CDEV"
"Congrats to those that weathered the most recent storm in the last couple weeks.As I see it the 2 major contributors to the storm were:1. OPEC+ turbulence / uncertainties 2. PTSD from pandemicOn OPEC, today’s new agreement is very bullish in my opinion. It brings more certainty to the market, and although several countries baselines get moved up next year, it doesn’t mean OPEC+ will automatically produce more. They should continue to monitor the market monthly and react accordingly to balance supply and demand. Again, welcomed by investors.On, pandemic / lockdown fears. The market is still working through PTSD, and there are those looking to continue to manipulate and exploit. A lot is in the process of exposure.Holding LPI, CPE, and CDEV and believe all 3 will double by Jan.$LPI $CPE $CDEV"
"So attempting to load up at this price, Anybody? I am long."
"In the TV adaptation of Ray Bradbury's Martian Chronicles an astronaut lands on Mars and through telepathy the Martians convince him that he's in his old home town, years earlier. His dead brother and dead parents greet him. It's all so that the Martians can kill him with poison. That night he's lying in bed in his old bedroom with his brother in the same room. Then he starts to think, ""maybe we really did land on Mars and all of this is a lie"". Suddenly he starts to feel sick, poisoned by what he thought was pudding. One of the last things he says to his brother (whom he now knows is a Martian) is ""you couldn't disguise the air"". The thin Martian air is what gave it away. Well, the media crums can't disguise the price of crude. That's controlled by supply and demand. So unless the crums can crash the economy on Delt@ fears then oil stocks will rise. I'm not saying that the crums can't crash our economy. But hopefully the @merican people won't let them do it again. $CDEV $LPI $RIG"
"Listen Weedfarmer weedyBoy  dont take credit for ME yelling YOU cdev will hit $22.00 !Saw your twits post about ( you telling the world first ) come on man .You know i love & respect your hustle but ...Last dec Jan i was posting on twits repeatedly that CDEV would absolutely eventually hit $22.00 maybe $26.00 to $35.00 and exceed old highs like MTDR.Everyone said I was too optomistic & I said NO im just thinking 18 months out not 3 to 6 like you.You back then said $8.00 to $12.00 max now you COPY my PT trie to take credit"" I told YOU weedy boy "" !$22.00 cdev via J_A_C_Q not Weedfarmer in Dec of 2020Maybe thats why the cdev mob got me banned from twits .... cause more often MORE right !"

I got into stocks when Covid hitTook 40 grand and put it onto CDEV and some biotechsI wanted to hold CDEV longer but I got scared and sold all of it last week￼.Invested to hopefully make money to pay off my wife’s student loans and half of our house and after a 500% gain on our money we did that but I have a Lotta regret selling CDEV so I will be here cheering you guys on to hopefully double digits!!!￼
"CDEV hedging profile for oil is: -50% 3rdq '21with an average price thur Aug. of $55.00 with the unhedged averaging $67-69 -47% 4thq '21 15000 bls/d -36% 1stq '22 11500 "" (all '22 hedges averages $64+ in price) -28% 2ndq "" 9000 "" -19% 3rdq "" 6000 "" -15% 4thq "" 5000 ""Let me know if anyone see something different in your review. So, going forward CDEV is in pretty good shape on the hedging of oil. I'm sure they will add some more as they move in time and it would probably be wise to do if they use collors with a high ceiling. What is hurting them is the differentials of $5. or so...which costs them $14m a quarter or $.05 or so a share! I understand this fluctuates, but it really hits the bottom line. Can anyone help me understand why this is so high? I assume it involves getting the oil to market, transportation, etc., but is there a solution in sight (more pipelines, etc.) for the Delaware basin or the Permiam in general? Likewise, the $.33 natural gas differential hits the bottom line too."
"Centennial Resource Development (CDEV +0.7%) edges higher as Cowen upgrades shares to Market Perform from Underperform with a $5.75 price target, raised from $4, as the improved oil price environment ""has no doubt been a panacea"" for the company."
price action got me like
GOVX. What do you folks think about the news on that stock today?
"$LPI $CPE $CDEV $BP University of Florida predicts Rona D peak on August 24th, and herd immunity in Florida by September 11. Other states will follow. The market will reverse, despite what CNN is telling you."
$BSM $CDEV will both be green b4 days end - Commodity trader says this pull back for crude is just a blip of a set back on the radar - inventories are tight - demand still outpaces supply - China buying all the LNG it can get it's hands on. Mark my words - $100/bbl & $6+NG could easily happen b4 yr end. ENERGY STRONG !! These are great opportunities to accum more.
"2nd half hedges in the mid to upper 60s and they can still somewhat take advantage of current prices...next year only a quarter hedged at high 60s. I think this is good news. Also, I think the miss in earnings is due to capital investments and not necessarily due to operational issues, which I view as good for healthy future financials. If I'm looking at any of this wrong, someone please feel free to correct me."
Oil crashing again!
What
Someone dumped over a million shares and took us off our high of the day which wasn't very high to begin with. The institutions and others continue to sell into every rally.
"Falling knife. buy at your own risk. At the very least, cost average in slowly."
We're either forming multiple tops or basing for the next leg higher. It all depends on what oil does. Simple as that.
"The COOLER long term thinking heads will later rake in the CDEV OG bread !This period of consolidation in OG stocks from a technical point of view ( though unpleasant whilst viewing your daily balances ) is par for the TUT manipulation course. I can't post charts here but open the cdev 1 year and look at the heavy consolidation from the 03/15/2021 peak at 6.25 to 05/21/2021 at which point a new leg up began.Same exact chart pattern is playing out here. 06/23/2021 peak of 7.52 then brings forth 2 months of dippidy slippidy price action poo.But have no fear this fear mongering in the market is exactly what to expect ! Blackrock is buying , Blackrock ain't sweating the consolidation. Why ? The FUNDAMENTALS beat the FUD and cdev is strong & getting stronger.As the Oil Trade Thesis plays out we know supply is tightened & tightening & consumption will outpace production.THIS IS WHY BLACKROCK IS BUYING.So the OG / EV market headwinds & macro micro economic fiscal monetary policies & bickerings DO NOTHING to change the Trade Thesis.As long as Biden is in office his policies will drive up the price of oil.Weeks back I took a NEW second position in cdev. This is my first margin trade & I plopped $200,000 more on cdev on top of my original position.1st position CB = $1.492nd position CB = $5.12The 2nd position already suffered a House Call temporarily & self resolved. Today another House Call will be issued on that position but I have every confidence the price will bounce back if not ill deal with it.From the price 1 year ago at .9087 to the recent POP of 7.52 a gain of 728% was realized.Based on last years gain projecting forward 1 year the scenario is 4.64 + 728% = 38.41 ==== wow could cdev do what MTDR had done & exceed old highs ?As a margin of error lets say 38.41 - 50% = 19.21 or 38.41 - 25% = 28.81I'm not concerned about TODAY as with Blackrock my concerns are 6 months 9 months 18 months.Not saying I won't day & swing trade for some pocket change but the price action like 5.00 to 10.00 to 15.00 price action moves = well worth the wait."
As tech earnings falter I do believe we will see an exodus into other sectors and energy/oil is looking better and better with future guidances improving.Cdev strong 
Short term CDEV price is linked to how the variant plays out. So be ready for anything. Long term of course we see double digits.
Nice. Close over 5.50 would be great. Let's gets some distance from 5.0
"$LPI $CPE $CDEV ""In both countries (UK and India), a steep rise in cases was followed by a similarly rapid decline, suggesting that the fast-spreading Delta variant typically burns itself out fairly quickly.""https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/peteraldhous/delta-variant-wave-uk-europe"

"The bears had their fun market-wide in the last month and a half. Multiple sectors (reopening related) were bearish because of Corona Delta in US and China. Now China released good news, and within the next week or two we might reach peak Delta infections per day (in Florida at least). Big guys dumped after a huge rally, used bad news to their advantage, and now they're back on board. Oil demand is strong for the next 1 year at least.$CPE $CDEV"
I can’t believe that this covid bs is still influencing the market so much. Has the seasonal flu ever had this much of affect?
"People complaining that $CPE barely moved while $CDEV went 9% up. Well, the latter stated that they would use gains to pay debt and be conservative this year and they have fulfilled its promise, the former after increasing its debt with Carrizo acquisition, promised to be conservative...well, just got into another deal paying again a premium and as a consequence diluting current shareholders by 31%. Probably they have a plan and see something ahead that i can't decipher, however short term stock price as well as people confidence on the companywill suffer. I have like 20k invested here, and was planning to invest more, i still will do it, but maybe in 2022. I think there are better plays out there right now. Good luck."
Haven’t been on this board in a while but Bee is still around? Lmao this was doomed when it was at 50 cents last year according to them.
Have a great weekend everyone. I'm on my yacht enjoying the blue waters. Be back on Monday. Hopefully we'll see oil above 70 next week.
I come here only to hear what Harry of the family Ballz has to say.
"$CPE $CDEV $LPINo gambling stocks Glad. Don’t do it. KLXE was a good short term ride because of crude price boost. Otherwise, it has been going down the toilet since it went public."
me right now
"So what happened to the (high) earnings and the (low) PE?All that changed in last couple of weeks?even at the reduced production numbers going forward, the earnings (only slightly lower form the original earnings) and PE (single digits) remain mostly on target. Meanwhile the stock price has taken a 40% haircut.Either I am completely wrong about where the oil prices are going or we have a phenomenal buying opportunity in LPI ( and many other small cap oilers like $CDEV, $CPE, $SM, $TTI, $NR and $RIG)."
Dow is off 119. Internally stocks are getting crushed. This market is hiding the damage beneath the surface. Look at the charts of most stocks. They're down 20 to 30 percent. That's a hidden bear market.
If we can breakout over 5.08 then
"Oil futures rise Tuesday, extending a bounce from last week's rout, on signs the spread of the delta variant of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 may be abating in China. Also, a fire on an oil platform in Mexico knocks around a quarter of the nation's daily crude output offline"
$8.50 end of year.
"I know this is annoying but we will do fine. Oil is not going to go lower, it went below 70 and in less than 3 days it recovered. I will continue to rise and eventually it will reach 80. We don't need much more, because our oil companies will be fine, they may drop along the way again but we will get to 14 at least, by next year. Just be patient, they are trying to scare you and make you believe that there is no future here. So, see this as a opportunity to load more, I have other investments and little by little will be moving my gains to this sector. As i said, just be patient. Have a great day."
Oil is tanking. Stock price is up towards close. I think we hit a bottom fellas. Def reached oversold territory. Any reversal in oil price and watch the stock skyrocket

Bought $MTDR and added back $CDEV shares today. Oil looking like it is completing a retest of the 65 lows and making a double bottom. Remember that oil will rally in advance of a decline in delta and it looks like the virus is getting closer to its peak for this cycle.
