Maybe pins could buy pypl now. j/k
Just bought another 500 shares at 233.00 to add to my existing PYPL holdings.
Long term pypl will be fine. Not here to play pretend day trader. Holding for 20+ years.
I think they will cancel the deal of it was ever true. It is running investors off.

People will regret not buying this at the current price. It's going to skyrocket back up to the upper 200's over the next couple of weeks.
This earnings season generally beating estimates so far in the market despite inflation environment. Guess which company is an inflation hedge? pinterest news came in a wrong time and pypl unfairly punished. The stock is not the company right now but Paypal is still Paypal!
"Okay. I have nine more shares, whales. Please buy your 100,000 shares and start sending this north."
I am in!!!! Bought 931 shares
Anyone get Cramers Investment Club newsletter that he's been pumping non-stop? He owns PYPL but is telling his subscribers to wait on his word when to buy more of PYPL. He said he's close to telling them to buy.
This may in fact go down…BUT…it’s PAYPAL. It will go back up people. Big plus is Christmas shopping starts next week and that will help this along no matter what earning day. We’re looking at good buy in prices right now. Think of it as a Christmas gift to yourself while it’s on sale.
PYPL or FB?
I'm a buyer next week.
Double bottom today on the PYPL chart. Short term bullish indicator. We are getting ready for a nice increase I believe. Good luck all. If not today. Tomorrow.
I'm Bullish on PYPL at these levels too....Got to Buy low and here is as good as it gets to start or to dd. Good Luck
Can we see $265 by earnings day? Looks unlikely but staying positive. Visa and MC got crushed and that worries me big time…
"If you bought your first share here YTD. Congrats, you are on a strong support level."
PayPal stated that it is not pursuing an acquisition of Pinterest at this time.Bloomberg should be sued by PayPal investor for market manipulation with fake news.
"Whether PYPL goes up or down, Today is not the end of the world!"
Online Payment Gateway Market increasing at an exceptional pace to reach $86.5 billion by 2028: Zion Market Research
"No that it matters, but Jim Cramer just sent the following email to investment clubFrom a stock perspective, we can’t help but think the risk/reward has gotten very attractive at this point. If PayPal were to buy Pinterest, we question how much immediate downside would be left in the stock. Maybe two to three percent tops because it’s not truly new information anymore?But ask yourself this question: What if Paypal walks away? We would expect the stock to soar and quickly recover the huge amount of market cap lost over the past few days."
"Logically, this should be 285 (i.e. the price just before PINS announcement) and the price appreciation that has happened since then. No brainer."
"I went through this with $NVDA & I'm glad I held on as painful as that was. This is even more painful because I didn't expect this to happen to one of my core holdings, & my faith in its CEO. Here's fingers crossed same thing happens as did with NVDA."
5m shares over normal R.I.P. NVDA 310 to 230 without a single uptick and not a peep from management; deleted the app at $310 and shorted
PYPL (inspired by Chinese WeChat integrated business model) has gigantic ambitions to be one of the biggest tech giants. The company is growing very quickly and the recent pullback is a gift for patient investors.
meanwhile institutions are loading up in the dark pools
"PayPal is not buying the social media image sharing site Pinterest, the payments giant said in a brief statement on Sunday (Oct. 24).The company responded to what it called “market rumors” about its supposed acquisition of Pinterest and stated that it is “not pursuing an acquisition of Pinterest at this time.”"
"Guys, check out http://the-alphatrader.com/. They have been crushing it lately while PYPL barley does anything at all."
This feels like its bottoming today ... maybe wrong but bought in at $234.25 - This is now very oversold prior to earnings ... any downside is likely prced in .... GLTA
"The ARK Next Generation Internet ETF sold 19,568 shares of PayPal (PYPL), according to the trading update released Monday. The ARK Fintech Innovation ETF sold 138,370 shares of PayPal and 336,715 shares of Pinterest (PINS)."
"Anything under $240 is a great buy in! Especially if you don’t want to actually buy crypto, you have it in and with PayPal in many different ways. Plus their new app is great. I’m in"
"the people on here crack me up. very few and far between do you see comments from real investors who know anytime beyond whats on message boards like reddit or yahoo finance (haha). The stock market doesn't make people rich over night with a few easy trades, despite how smart you think you are. most are looking at the short term Paypal + Pinterest (but I don't use Pinterest, i dont like it) well either do I, but for 45 Million, so very smart people in very expensive suites have drawn out an extensive plan that will likely make Pinterest, completely unrecognizable compared to its current design/platform. When reality is...years from now paypal + pinterest = a foot in the door into Amazon's market share. im sure many people thought that same little bookstore was dumb to have made the acquisitions it has..i mean why buy whole foods right?"
"In this expensive market, just saying a word acquisition will give you 20% haircut."
Paypal way oversold!!! If Pin deal goes thru @ $70... great price for Paypal... If it doesn't go thru... no harm to Paypal. Either way ..Paypal @ 20%+ discount which & price will recoup losses in a few days!!! Folks are way overreacting!!! Smart money buys this dip!!!
"This is automated selling due to the technical' s. 50day vs 200 day. After the washout it will head back north, buy the inefficiency of the machine trading."
On my chart PayPal is forming a double twist McNoodle hammer with an inverted pony candle. Higher prices coming now
It's down because all financials are down after disappointing Visa revenue guidance and specifically cited decelerating eCommerce growth.Some of you need to get a part time job if you're so desperate for money. This is investing. Stocks fluctuate
"My grasshoppers, we are going 10% higher next week. Watch and learn. If you are thinking of selling, you will only regret it once this RIPS higher."
Is a buying opportunity now?
"Paypal called off acquisition talks. Go to paypal investor site click on news and events Response to Market Rumors of Discussions Between PayPal and Pinterest In response to market rumors regarding a potential acquisition of Pinterest by PayPal, PayPal stated that it is not pursuing an acquisition of Pinterest at this time."
PYPL announced it's not acquiring PINS. And this is why you complain non-stop when a company is undercutting investors. You don't support them cause you own the stock and think that's what you have to do.
"Paypal earnings on 8th NOVEMBER.. Week on Monday. To anyone thinking of dumping, I would at least hold until after earnings at the very least."
"This is going back up 20 points very fast. After the PayPal executives see the share price plunge just for thinking about buying PINS, they will not buy pins"
"Paypal holders: your support is officially here. I loaded up, doubled my position then added more in the pre-hours. Monstrous company, worth every bit of $280 by Christmas."
Bloomberg should be sued for stock price manipulation with false news.
can you imagine if PYPL now says they want to buy something else? PYPL will tank below $200.
"I am looking at the chart comparison of SQ and PYPL and they are closely identical this year, until investors got spooked by the pinterest news initially. There is no conspiracy theory here as some of you may think, get that boogeyman out of your head. the dumb money owned this stock for the past week, but the smart money will rip it higher because they know its true value."
"Just loaded up, thanks for the shares whoever sold.Buying Pinterest is a brilliant idea."
This is the bottom all! Very strong support here. Fingers crossed!
PYPL's analyst target price is $326 ! It costs only $245 now !
What's stopping PYPL to add buy now pay later button to checkout? Why can't we utilize our proven platform to make affirm of our own?
analyst upgrades will be rolling in!++++++++
I did what I could and added at $235
I think his will go down as one of the worst acquisitions ever. Nothing makes sense. Some people say they are in it for the ad revenue. PINS has declining traffic growth. You don't pay 40 billion for ads on a site that is fading in popularity
So buying pinterest was bad news and then not buying pinterest was also bad news.
Salamander Johnson is the very definition of paid basher. Reeking of desperation while he makes two cents per post. LOL
1 million shares just hit on the buy side!!!
"wow, first day in green in one week."
Markets are strong this morning. I think we see $255 today.
Shorts are definitely pressing this one but will have to cover before earnings to lock in gains. Wait for that pop.
anyone remember when PYPL had green Day ? lol
https://investor.pypl.com/news-and-events/news-details/2021/Response-to-Market-Rumors-of-Discussions-Between-PayPal-and-Pinterest/default.aspx
why they wait so many days to announce the news?
"Quote: ""Piper Sandler releases new report about PayPal and says not acquiring Pinterest is a clear positive.Gives PYPL a $315 PT!"""
"Cramer says buy it, Fast Money says sell it, who do you believe?"
100% manipulating. you will win by staying.
"it is getting too uncomfortably close to the death cross.. Once the 50 DMA of 270 dips under the 200 DMA of 265 its over. these averages keep getting lowered & closer each down day. Once under the DC then PYPL will be in sub 200s for next 6 months.. I dont get it this is supposed to be a good inflation proof stock but obviously this ER some bad news is being priced in.. Not waiting for the Death cross,, cutting losses here if it closes below 234..."
It was over 250 on Monday. Now at 232. Boy I screwed up buying this. Thing is no analyst have come out downgrading. Still average price target is over 300 so who is selling every day?
down because of Fiserv earning report. everything in fintech sector down.
These dudes say they’re buying Pinterest? Stock goes down. Not buying Pinterest? Stock goes down. Dudes really can’t do anything in this market…
"Buying opportunity. PINS would be a quality acquisition. If it doesn't happen PYPL rebounds. Win, win."
Surely this is a options SP manipulation this week. Stock like pypl don't go down 7 days in a row with no bad reason.
wow this is making new lows after getting out of the deal. It really does not make any sense.
"Buying PayPal at this price is, absolutely worth it. Let's go"
This is a prime example of older generation investors missing the bigger picture. Pinterests platform is unique and many are unaware of it. Pinterest allows users to click on any picture of interest and it brings you directly to the seller. No other platform is that direct including google.
"PINS ad revenue for FY19 was 1.14 billion, with revenue growth of 51% ! If PYPL buys PINS, PYPL will gain all its ad revenue + customer base + transaction fees ! If not, PYPL will anyway have their 19% revenue growth! Plus major gains from CRYPTO transactions !"
Maybe Monday. 
"Since the leaked merger news, pypl lost $32B market cap and pins gained $3.5B market cap.What a disaster for this marriage?"
Just looking at the one year. History shows P$PL is at a major support level now. They would rally have to F-up earning to go south from here. All I see is daylight north. I hope I am right.
This will stay at this price. it's a bargain buy ATM.
"PayPal deal for Pinterest could help accelerate super app ambitions, says Baird Following media reports suggesting that PayPal (PYPL) is considering an acquisition of Pinterest (PINS) for about $70 per share, Baird analyst Colin Sebastian said that ""at first glance"" he believes such a potential combination could make strategic sense. For PayPal, there would be ""clear synergies"" in combining its own ""bottom of the funnel"" digital wallet and Honey deals platform with Pinterest's ""top of funnel"" search, discovery and inspiration platform, Sebastian said. The analyst, who thinks Pinterest ""could help PayPal accelerate its super app ambitions"" and significantly increase the size of its consumer wallet base by converting Pinterest users into PayPal account holders, thinks PayPal might need to pay greater than $70 per share for Pinterest. Sebastian has an Outperform rating and $325 price target on PayPal shares."
"Amazon is the harbinger of the online spending trend.. Besides Ebay missed badly so writings on the wall on PYPL ER.. I am out here & see if i can get back in lower, if youll donyt want to jump ship now then ssave some cash to average down.."
Wow is this still going down? Will be too tempting if it goes under $240… good dip buying opportunity
If PINS deal goes through PYPL will not sniff $300 for at least another year if not more. The market is not kind to stocks that make acquisitions that they can't financially justify.
Can we see $260 today? I hope so…
18% down in 5 days over basically nothing. great buying opportunity 
Earnings should bring the stock back to $370.
"I purchased this stock when it was $35.00 and then sold it. Got back in at $90, $175 and last one was at $240. My basis is low so that's not a problem. I believe in this company and those who are in charge. So why after the announcement about no Pininterest is this still headed down? What am I missing?"
The 200 day is $267. And the 50 day is $269. PYPL should revert back towards that area soon.
Has some critical Inside info on upcoming earnings get released to Cathy Wood? It is suspicious how she and some others are playing this sell off?
"The bad news from SHOP and SNAP, PYPL has a dangerous future.The winter of all on-line stocks is coming, after the post-COVID19 period.Be careful this is next ZOOM"
"I could care less if PINS happens or not, im doubling down. Look a few years ahead this a massive discount"
5 straight days of declines. down almost 20% in a week. Can someone please remind me why this is a good long term investment?
good rebound pre-market after denying rumour of buying pinterest good buying opportunity the last few days
PayPal clarifies via a post on the company website that it has no intentions of acquiring Pinterest.
"$235 Calls expiring tomorrow, I'm excited for tomorrow's session as well as how today will close. Peace and trade on my friends"
I was hoping it would not break the heavy resistance 230-232 or we all have something to worry about. Happy Halloween all.
"My long term portfolio is at all time highs and I have PYPL and FB in it....I believe these having off their highs, they will be my best performers on the come back. Good Luck"
Load up on $PINS. Say that you will want to buy it. Sell $PINS at a huge profit. Buy back $PYPL at a discount. Say that you are no longer interested in $PINS. Sell $PYPL at a huge profit. Perfect strategy.
Why is square up 2% but PayPal keeps falling? I figure it is because I bought PayPal
Would you buy SOFI for 20 billion? I was talking to someone about reasonable acquisitions for Paypal and SOFI came up a lot. SOFI priced itself at 8 billion a few years ago. Company has doubled since so 20 billion sounds reasonable when you factor in future growth.
"The 200 day MA is $267, and the 50 day MA is $269. PYPL should bounce back near those soon, especially since it hit a double bottom today showing it#$%$ clear support levels and will rebound. Great company out of touch with fundamentals."
PYPL not buying PINShttps://twitter.com/unusual_whales/status/1452514530236329986
PYPL will see reversal today. Shorts run for a cover
"230-235 area is double support back from May, Stock may move a tad lower but not much. If it does then there is something else going on"
Added a couple of times today. This will be straightened out in short order. Long term investment. Great company although it did a misstep which gave me a buying opportunity.
$245 tomorrow. Get ready hang in there
Am in!!! Won't stay down here very long. Let's do this :)

"OK, this is in no way a normal stock move.It keeps having these violent downturns then up turns. It has to be manipulation"
if youll think this dip buying is a good price then after ER is when the real bargains come on sale.. At this level youll are just another pool of bag holders...
Added few more at 237. Lets go!
Glad I bought this to see it drop $12 in just over a week. 
So weird that is is down 5 bucks today. Best to just look away and check in a week
Ok everyone. Didn’t I say the manipulation was done! Now back to $300! Last opportunity… $PYPL $SQ
"I'm predicting this will close tomorrow above $245... Hopefully this is the beginning of a upward trend to regain some of its losses... earnings are next week oh, so I expect at least $20 up from today's open"
The price action implies that Ginny Rometty and Meg Whitman will be CEO of new combined company.
"Somehow, somewhere along the way, Paypal will go up. All we need is patience. That's all stocks do -- unless it goes bankrupt. Buy the dip and wait."
"Comical. Both stocks are tanking now. If the deal doesn't happen PINS will drop because....simply put, the deal didn't go through. PYPL will continue to drop because people will say how they needed this deal to happen to participate in ecommerce and this was their best chance to do just that. So, both companies come crashing down for absolutely no good reason other than the fact that negativity rules over optimism."
This may be asking a lot for a yahoo message board but I’ll ask anyway: Does anyone know the reason PayPal buying Pinterest is viewed negatively? Pinterest is a profitable company with a pretty good cash to debt ratio (according to yahoo statistics)
"“Dragon Fly” candle for PYPL today. It is a signal of a bullish reversal at the bottom of a down trend. Hopefully it will signal what it does, bottom at the low today and start heading up a bit"
Glad I kept buying on the way down last week. Didn't listen to the noise on here.
"Not trying to down PayPal, own some but fact is Coinbase Pro is #1 in Apple App store, above Facebook and TikTok. PayPal is 38."

Who is selling stocks of this inflation proof and growing company smh
Buy Buy Buy!!
The market is telling Paypal that buying Pinterest is probably not a good idea. I tend to agree because they may be paying too much but don't know the whole picture.
No volume today and bearish. Long slow decline continues with no bottom as Fintech getting re-evaluated.
I predict that this will be up another 8 to $10 tomorrow
PYPL will go back above $300 by end December. Management realizes buying PINS is a bad move and once the deal is cancelled… also the partnership with PLAID will be great!!SOFI and PYPL are 2 of my best fintech plays for next year !!
Don’t touch PayPal at this level. Heading further south today and probably bottom at 231 ranges

Cathie is just rebalancing her portfolio. She has no reason to leave pypl.
"MM be like: ""let's make the chart look like this today for all of the technical chart readers..."""
What happened to the $15 we were up pre-market We gave half back
So the Mastercard earnings news should bode well for PyPl going foreward!
"There comes a time when PYPL""s decline becomes a buying point."
We found the bottom!
"Watch how tomorrow pre market hours it will show this stock price near $247 and as soon as the market opens, it'll go down to $241."
"Well, this is a bad day! I own 2 stocks that beat earnings and both down over 3%! Wth"
Bought a few more in my trading account. $233 & $237 I have a much bigger position in my long-term account. I cannot believe I was wrong about this stock. I'll either go down crying or finally get that new car.
PayPal partners with leading edutech companies in India. The edutech sector is poised to emerge as a $30 billion market in the next 10 years.
Look for them to terminate discussions regarding the potential deal. It’s not going to happen. Look at shareholders reaction. Not good! Price will bounce back quickly after cessation of deal talks.
"Institutions / funds get the first insider news on ER & take time couple of days at least to sell. As youll can see this selling process already in motion past few days ,, Around 227 this hits the death cross & then no known support til 150.. I think this gets to the DC next week after Square earnings which will also sell of bigly.. Sell now & buy lower.. Its a good company with a great biz model in the growing Fintech space but for now the stock is broken.."
"If it was a rumor, why didn't Paypal refute it on the very first day?"
Chart is broken. Sub $200? I have 50 shares.
Whenever a stock is in the news the bots promoting sketchy “investment advisors” hit the relevant Yahoo boards big-time. Steer clear!
"I am long and I agree with the comments here...but...from a technical standpoint, the chart looks horrible....could easily continue under 230 which would be incredible....I bought some at 245. and I thought that was a great deal...now, I do not want to catch another falling knife. I will wait til the selling stops."
"Paypal PE is 57 SQ PE is 232Pypl is a no brainer here, it hasn't been this low in 8 months. Holiday shopping will rocket this over $300 again."
"Check your psyche. Theres usually many negativity in a board room when a stock is down. Ultimately, know what you are invested in. Nothing changed with pypl being one of the top fintechs out there. This oversold fake news is a gift."
I don't care if it crawls back up as long as it's headed in the right direction
"A fake rumor has beaten down PYPL from $271 to $237, a loss of $34 !"
Buy buy buy
"PYPL customer base is 403 million. PINS customer base is 454 million. Either way, it will be Win-Win situation for PYPL !"
Somebody out there really doesn’t like this company lol it’s getting absolutely relentlessly hammered.
"On Bloomberg today, Top Picks by Barry Schwartz. Excellent analysis IMOPaypal (PYPL NASD)Dan Schulman and his team at PayPal are looking to build what Facebook cannot, the Super App. The PayPal Super App will integrate banking, payments, shopping, messaging, investing and so many more services. PayPal has gigantic ambitions to be one of the biggest tech giants. Do not underestimate the company that overestimates itself. If the rumor that PayPal wants to acquire Pinterest is true, then this is just one of many pieces, PayPal will need to reach its lofty goal. In the meantime, the company is growing very quickly and the recent pullback is a gift for patient investors."
"Reading about Paypal's rationale for wanting to buy PINS is concerning. They are having an identity crisis. They want to become a ""gateway to digital commerce"" and i thought I was buying an online banking and digital payments company. And they are reckless towards shareholders. If they have so much money to burn why not buy more shares back? The float is enormous"
"After any announcement, using the 3 day rule is the best strategy for any stock."
PYPL is in a bullish reversal toward $270 through earning on Nov 8th
PYPL is out performing SQ today. We are down 1.82% vs SQ down 2.36%.
"This will climb fast once the shorts start covering, along with the dip buyers coming in once this shows some upward movement."
PYPL was at 271's before the fake news and currently its 50 DMA is also at 271's. The confluence of these 2 indicates a strong target of 271 first stop. Good Luck
Stock will bottom eventually. Great company excluding this recent 'mis-step'. Will rebound. At some point will be a great entry point.
"PayPal triggered the 7%-8% loss rule from its 296.11 buy point in a cup with handle amid sharp losses in August, according to IBD MarketSmith chart analysis, so the stock is not a buy right now. There is no new buy point at this time, but the stock could be forming a new base"
"I continue to buy in increments on the way down, no doubt in my mind."
"i'm not selling yet. i've been burned twice already buying the dip. I'm gonna wait until after earnings. It it gets crushed after earnings, i'm done"
"I don’t care, I am buying and will wait until the end of this year."
I certainly like PYPL especially around these prices. This is the time to buy leaders within their field as PYPL is off their 310 highs. Growth stocks have high volatility. Good Luck
PYPL 1-year target price estimate is $326. It is about 24% cheaper today!
I want to sell my shares to Piper Sandler for 315.00
"Don't fight it, just buy and enjoy the appreciation"
What is happening in PYPL. It is all the problem of CEO and Management lacking Comm Skills 101. Market Cap has declined $40B in 2 weeks.
"Seeking Alpha article just now: ""Pinterest falls 2% as confirmed earnings schedule dampens PayPal deal hopes"". It's very short, and basically says that since they want to do mostly a ""stock deal"", that the 3 day drop in PYPL stock (<4.9%>, <5.9%> & <1.2%>) by <12.0%> ""could derail the deal"". Bullish."
Bought PYPL today at 240 as I think it’s way oversold. Solid long term investment IMO. Will just buy more if it dips. GLTA
Hope you bought that PYPL dip! You may never have a chance to buy it that low again. I think it will begin its climb back up from here. Good luck all!
"Can't believe they caved to all of the outside voices that think they ""know better"". Analysts and the like are drones.. not born with any creative vision."
"I must say, this is actually a really good price to get in…"
So now it is at its low of last week. Did the market want PayPal to buy pins?
just wait until PayPal releases its numbers in a week... We should be over $285 by the end of next week
"If you sold your shares last week, well..you are still welcome to come back, but you will most likely need to pay a higher price now. If you can't handle the pressure, stay away from the stock market. "
My bet is this deal doesn’t even happen. Incredibly cheap PayPal shares 
"Comes all the way down from $271 on PINS news, now deal's off, it's struggling to stay at $248, total manipulation."
"NEWS: ""PYPL says it's not pursuing a deal with PINS."" Bullish Good Luck"
I would short 234 here and cover below 200 after earnings if you all don’t think  earnings were leaked ask the bag  holders of Boeing
"Let's stay positive on this. I believe, a breakout is about to happen anytime soon."
Huge buying opportunity!!!
Lol drops 15% on Pinterest news and then Pinterest news is removed and it only recovers 5%???? Not a good market reaction at all.
IT's a good stock to own at this price. Most growth stocks have volatility and this was bought down by intangible whispers.
"Do not look at the stock's price. Look at the company. If you believe in the company, then stay long, and do not pay attention to the price of stock. $PINS Pinterest, is a brand name. Like $FB $SNAP $EBAY $ETSY Pinterest, is a digital market place. It is a marketing billboard.I congecture there will be a lot of interested parties to marry Pinterest. ""If"" $Pypl, supposedly showed desire to explore. There will be more explorers. There was a time of SPACs. Now, the time of Mergers & Acquisitions. Even, IF Pins drops to below $40 That would be great. Smart money will start grabbing it like hungry Vultures, in African Savanas. If you are an investor, dollar cost average pins. If you are a bag holder. Do the same. Dollar cost average. Do not buy stock, As Buffet says, buy the company.Volatility is part of the investments. With great news and Positive ER, price will jump back to 60s in a matter of Days.Best regards to ALL"
"If you think SNAP had bad earnings, PINS will be worse. Perfect timing for PYPL to cancel any deal. Announce a strategic partnership but NO buyout!!!!!"
PYPL management: make announcement there is NO deal. Stock goes up $25
this is a gift
"People tend to sell on any news, good or bad.There is too much panic in markets these days.But PYPL is the king of its game, and it would be 400+ in a year or two."
Msft tried to buy pinterest for $51b. There is no way $45 Billion Deal will be accepted.
Watch out shorting at this level. This can bounce back faster than it went down. Bought stock and calls here
"So happy this is starting to turn today, I have felt MUCH pain over the past week. But I just went back to look at the second quarter conference call. They missed on revenue, modestly beat on eps. There was much noise in the report about the Ebay transition and how that transition will last a few quarters. Now I believe consumer is flush with cash, and inflation will likely help PYPL as average transactions are likely much larger. But then we have the demand side which is likely getting hit because goods are not available. So, I am optimistically cautious going into earnings. But I hope the worst of the trip selling is over now and we are ready for a nice near term bounce into earnings. I also think, like some are saying, this Pinterest noise may have been a screen for a bad quarter that is on the way. Somehow I think they would have ignored the noise about PINS and addressed it into earnings, if earnings looked good. Because then you have a HUGE bounce after conference. But, given earnings maybe not shaping up they felt they needed to get PINS news out early to stop some bleeding. They could not wait until conference to report PINS deal off and by the way not such a good quarter. That would mean they are looking for growth from outside at any price because they fear growth is slowing internally. So coming out before the quarter gives me some pause that maybe the quarter is not a good one. All this is short term nonsense because in the end the trends say this one goes higher long term."
The silver lining people. PYPL reports earnings soon so unless there is just a terrible miss then the damage has already been done. Good earnings and people will start getting back into the stock. Just have to ride it out
do any one know if the 200 day moving average crossed with the 50 days? if so at what priced was it?
"What a shameful crying game this has been, it has been going down much before the pinterest fiasco. I have a feeling that this company is still highly overvalued given its slowing growth trajectory. I am long here but really disappointed with what has been going on of late. It has been said that they were looking at Pinterest in order to mitigate slowing growth in the core business. Since the investment community was aghast at this assumed transaction, paypal denied this but remains with the slowing growth. What does anyone think of this?"
"Institutions are in charge for another couple of days, they will make their money when all options expire worthless. After that, we longs can play again"
"sounds like major manipulation is going on. almost feels like they're purposely dumping this stock to get retail investors out so they can buy in a cheaper price. I understand when it fell 10% on the rumors to buy pinterst, but the continued plummeting after it denied those rumors is wrong"
"Investigators are looking into whether the financial incentives that Visa gave fintech companies like Square, Stripe, and PayPal Holdings (PYPL) dissuaded them firms from using rival networks and technologies, The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter."
Bargain for long termGreat buying price opportunity
"Comparing the charts YTD between pypl and sq are relatively identical, only until the pins acquisition news changed the trajectory. It now has much room for a huge rebound but it may be rocky since ER is nearby. Strongly believe Pypl’s recent growth rate will beat estimates."
I think some people fleeing apple and amazon right now may come to PYPL because we’re down so much after the false acquisition news.
I may buy some more PYPL here soon. I didn’t think I’d get another chance to average down to lower my cost basis.
"A fake news down this stock price over 16%. If this is manupulation, price will bounce back quickly. If this is cos of early earning leak, still then 16% loss is not acceptable a company like paypal. I will continue to hold"
I feel the pain for those who bought at $300 plus. I sold the Nov 19 $230 Put when the share was $240. I don't mind getting put PYPL shares as it is a great company. Investing is 50% luck/timing...may be 40% if you learned your lessons the hard way.
"There is nooo reason it should be this low and and still dropping. The dip was well warranted, but the continuation makes me feel like mm are trying to squeeze the obvious call plays placed by retail option traders. (Like myself). Hopefully this turns before 11/5"
"""Piper Sandler releases new report and says not acquiring Pinterest is a clear positive, gives a $315 PT!""https://twitter.com/expandingmatter/status/1452750387669258244?s=20"
"I’m still trying figure out exactly what is going on here. The Covid boom is over. Stocks that ran up high valuations are now having their PEs cut back to historic levels. Before Covid, PayPal traded around a PE of 50. Guess what? It’s almost at 50 now and at $212 it will be at 50 PE. So I think that’s what’s happening here. A rotation out of the hot Covid stocks and into cheaper cyclicals.My strategy is hoping for a 5% bounce to sell. With rising interest rates looming I don’t think I want to be holding onto PayPal. Hopefully we get a bounce next week!Enjoy!!"
Is this Paypal or Baba?
"PYPL was doing fantastic before the fake rumor with PINS surfaced...now that PYPL refute the rumor, its all good and let the stock price rise steadily. Bullish"
Square has had a bigger drop than Pay Pal today
"You all forgot when eBay bought PayPal for 1.5 Billion, Meg the CEO of eBay got fired shortly after because the Wall Street estimated the purchase a total loss.We all know where PayPal is now and surely when you spent $40 Billion on a purchase, you have the best analysts hired to make sure it is the right move.Also, where does the money comes from, simply shorting the price, scatting the retail investors; gather money, buy Pinterest and then price back to close to $300Just hope it all happens fast Good Luck Will happen step by step as mentioned"
"the reason it isn't going up is that now the expectation is they are on the prowl for some kind of acquisition, so there is a cloudier it for now. The type of acquisition they come up with (BNPL or maybe SOFI) will determine the next leg up or down"
"I hope that someone at PYPL made a study of how many current PINS users also use PYPL...if its half the deal makes sense just because of the probability that the remaining half will be converted to using PYPL...if they find out that 70-80% already use PYPL payment services, I have serious doubts about this deal."
This price action is not normal. Huge amount of dumping here in the last 5 trading days. There must be something fked up inside of Paypal that the smart money knew. This is getting hurtful and terrifying for Paypal retail investors.
Confirmed news from PINS employee: the acquisition might not happen!!
Also flatening yeild curve affecting all financials although PYPL more on Fintech side.. Should recover to mid 140s at least by EOW
PayPal must cancel PINS deal at any cost
"Hello green. Come on in and have a beer, it's good to see you."
"Pinterest's goal (through their 2020 partnership with Shopify) is to turn the ad revenue business model into a commerce driven model. A customer sees a sofa on Pinterest, clicks through to the retailer website, and completes purchase using Venmo (a PayPal product). If all that spending can be routed thru PayPal, both PYPL and PINS will win."
Easiest …buy the dip… ever
"I expect the institutions and whales to start buying at this price... Remember, PayPal owns venmo also, and they will quickly monetize Pinterest by offering a Universal shopping site where people can buy what they are looking at or researching with the click of a button... you can buy all of a recipes ingredients with one click! and don't forget the pay later option!"
How would the PINS business model fit anyway? It's a visual search engine. If you like something in the picture it shows you various stores you can buy it. Paypal can't give direct payment access for these products because each product is integrated with private unaffiliated stores. It's different than Ebay because they cannot have exclusivity with the selling site since there are thousands of stores being linked on PINS
"Buy PYPL at this price in block. Stock price goes lower buy another block. big investors pressure the stock price so PYPL has two options, lower the offer or no deal. Remember, Xmas and Thanksgiving, the 4th quarter is the best money making for PYPL and other online retailers. Perfect Xmas White Sale for us as smart investors."
"With PYPL not purchasing PINS, should reverse all the losts plus shorts coverings on top."
"$pypl said: "" we are not buying $PINS at This time."" PayPal did say it will not ever buy pinterest. It's a game of words lol.. I conjecture there will be many interested parties, to acquire Pinterest.However, in my homble opinion, Pinterest will do well on its own. Just a matter of time. Buy it at this level. It is over reacted selling."
I see a huge bargainBuy at this level next week 10%up again
"I believe PYPL will beat earning strongly, share will be back to $300"
"technical chart RSI is wayyyyy oversold. That is why it not drops more in afterhours. Tomorrow is a downday, semi will get hits but PYPL is not going down much more. The upside is huge. Look at FAANG stocks not much down in afterhours except FB. Earnings on deck for next week so no major sell off yet!"
Not concerned because I’m holding long. If it gets too low someone will buy the company. Lol. My portfolio is pretty diverse so I threw PayPal a few bones last month. Ouch.!! Next year break even.
"This is a classic case reversal of buy the rumor sell the news, what happened with PYPL last 3 days was sell the rumor, BUY The NEWS!Fundamentally nothing has changed, this stock dropped 10% on rumors! Fact is once the news is announced, be it whether they move ahead or no with the acquisition, there is going to be a significant upside to come.Let's not pretend that us laymen and retail investors are much more informed than the PYPL management who have access to tons to data, on why they are contemplating buying PIN.Perhaps their analysis shows that maybe of PIN users are not using PYPL on transactions, and acquiring PIN would add significant users to their payment platform. Who knows?Great buying opportunity, and I am building positions in PYPL over the last 2 days for the first time. Glad to get in on this company for the long term."
