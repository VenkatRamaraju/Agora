Paypal can't handle the growing fraud problems. I sold my stock. I'm out.
"Paypal introduces Cash Back to Crypto to enable Venmo credit cardholders to automatically purchase cryptocurrency from their Venmo account using cash back earned from card purchases, according to PayPalhttps://seekingalpha.com/news/3728292-paypal-launches-new-feature-for-venmo-credit-cardholders-to-buy-crypto-automatically?mail_subject=pypl-paypal-launches-feature-for-venmo-credit-cardholders-to-buy-crypto-automatically&utm_campaign=rta-stock-news&utm_content=link-3&utm_medium=email&utm_source=seeking_alpha"
"PayPal is going to build out every capability they can to leverage their massive customer base. Stock trading was floated months ago and the crypto platform is going to continue to evolve as well. Throw in additional perks for ""members only"" like discount deals on popular products and first-access purchases to live music and theater events, too. One word: Juggernaught."
"There is something major wrong which we don’t know at all, this stock is unable to cross 280 mark, seems investors don’t believe in this company much now"
"Not surprised, PayPal is Godsend."
Lot of things yet to come.... In the PayPal. PayPal will reach $400+.Will launch in China soon.
"Paypal market cap 342 billion, Coinbase 57 billion, Net income Q2, PYPL 1.2 bil, Coin 1.6 bil."
"after the Europe news for paypal today, very strange action. Shocked it is not much higher."
"PayPal has been the very first company that is 100% ""Fintech."" Should not their stock value retain a trend pattern favorable, if PayPal does invest wisely?"
"If you’re looking for a short and sweet guide to the day’s biggest news, I recommend (http://Pick-stocks.com). They breakdown the most important pre-market news and it only takes a few minutes to read."
Paypal is the fintech innovation !!!!!!!!
Buy PayPal now at this price or wait for a dip???
When is PYPL going to make a move to increase their customer/Revenue base.
Paypal to introduce stock trading in the us
Any projections for this week?
"I see a lot of ""Paypal alert Lawsuit"" in the news recently. Does anyone know the impact of this?"
looks like bitcoin gain is helping PYPL grind up today
it was only time. glad I held when it was dipping the past few months
"The RSI and the MACD look splendid,do what you want!"
"$280 by next week, given breakout on 1 hour charts and no reason to fall further."
"paypal is moving into the stock trading industry. But the will be going up against heavy hitters, Charles Schwab, E*Trade, etc."
"Bitcoin is the future! Many people are seeking for stability in this unstable crypto space and A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now . I'd say it's outrightly wrong to just sit back hold and wait maybe incur some losses along the line , that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making proflts should be the way of life that being said , the market is still all about BTC at the moment and I'll advise current investors and newbies to take advantage of the Mr Morin program , an establishment that handles people who lack understanding on how maneuver the crypto space , to help them recover loss from the crash and also accumulate more positive returns , with their program i went from having 1.4btc to 6btc in just a week of trade. Morin can be reached on TELEG*RAM ( JohnMorinFx )"
It’s into crypto and may be a trading platform with being a digital bank in the future!! Then it’ll be at $1000 !!!!
I see easy break above $300!
"My only stock up at the moment, holding for a while."
I think $PYPL is due for a reversal soon. Hopefully we break 280 either Friday or next week. Double bottom strong support at 268-270

"$PYPL will only go into stock trading if Payment for Order Flow is allowed. Another reason PFOF will continue to be allowed and platforms like $HOOD will continue thriving.Even if the SEC chairman mentioned banning it is on the table, PFOF isn't going anywhere.Keep buying. Keep holding."
