"Check your psyche. Theres usually many negativity in a board room when a stock is down. Ultimately, know what you are invested in. Nothing changed with pypl being one of the top fintechs out there. This oversold fake news is a gift."
Surely this is a options SP manipulation this week. Stock like pypl don't go down 7 days in a row with no bad reason.
"There comes a time when PYPL""s decline becomes a buying point."

"I purchased this stock when it was $35.00 and then sold it. Got back in at $90, $175 and last one was at $240. My basis is low so that's not a problem. I believe in this company and those who are in charge. So why after the announcement about no Pininterest is this still headed down? What am I missing?"
Bought a few more in my trading account. $233 & $237 I have a much bigger position in my long-term account. I cannot believe I was wrong about this stock. I'll either go down crying or finally get that new car.
Just bought another 500 shares at 233.00 to add to my existing PYPL holdings.
"sounds like major manipulation is going on. almost feels like they're purposely dumping this stock to get retail investors out so they can buy in a cheaper price. I understand when it fell 10% on the rumors to buy pinterst, but the continued plummeting after it denied those rumors is wrong"
It was over 250 on Monday. Now at 232. Boy I screwed up buying this. Thing is no analyst have come out downgrading. Still average price target is over 300 so who is selling every day?
This may in fact go down…BUT…it’s PAYPAL. It will go back up people. Big plus is Christmas shopping starts next week and that will help this along no matter what earning day. We’re looking at good buy in prices right now. Think of it as a Christmas gift to yourself while it’s on sale.
On my chart PayPal is forming a double twist McNoodle hammer with an inverted pony candle. Higher prices coming now
"Somehow, somewhere along the way, Paypal will go up. All we need is patience. That's all stocks do -- unless it goes bankrupt. Buy the dip and wait."
"A bad ER for Amazon is a plus for Paypal because you can't use paypal on Amazon, which means wherever else people are shopping online they're using paypal to pay."
"“Dragon Fly” candle for PYPL today. It is a signal of a bullish reversal at the bottom of a down trend. Hopefully it will signal what it does, bottom at the low today and start heading up a bit"

"Paypal earnings on 8th NOVEMBER.. Week on Monday. To anyone thinking of dumping, I would at least hold until after earnings at the very least."
"My long term portfolio is at all time highs and I have PYPL and FB in it....I believe these having off their highs, they will be my best performers on the come back. Good Luck"
Double bottom today on the PYPL chart. Short term bullish indicator. We are getting ready for a nice increase I believe. Good luck all. If not today. Tomorrow.
"My grasshoppers, we are going 10% higher next week. Watch and learn. If you are thinking of selling, you will only regret it once this RIPS higher."
"Paypal PE is 57 SQ PE is 232Pypl is a no brainer here, it hasn't been this low in 8 months. Holiday shopping will rocket this over $300 again."
