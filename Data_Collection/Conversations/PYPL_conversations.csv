Shocked it dropped but there's no bad news so I'm not selling and see ya at $320+
"There is no good news for PayPal that’s why struggling, there has to be some talks in market to go up, no analyst is upgrading this stock yet too.."
"""Jefferies analyst Trevor Williams raised the price target on PayPal to $350.00 (from $340.00) after taking a look at the PYPL/Shopify relationship. Shopify's recent move to offer Shop Pay to all merchants selling on FB & GOOGL, is a big step to grow its consumer brand."""
"paypal is moving into the stock trading industry. But the will be going up against heavy hitters, Charles Schwab, E*Trade, etc."
60 P/E .. It may take awhile to grow into this ... I've done well on my options and it's a great Co . I may sell my calls and buy the stock . because I do like it
we finished positive!
PYPL reports earnings on 7/28 expected to report $1.13. I think $1.26 what is your guess.
Going to 265 in no time
"People need to relax & just buy the dip. Also all these people from SQ & Paypal who fight one another, why not just own both? Made so much from both stocks!"
Up up upBuy and hold long
"Payment appsCrypto boost: PayPal (PYPL) is increasing its weekly cryptocurrency purchase limit fivefold to $100,000 and is scrapping its annual purchase limit. ""These changes will enable our customers to have more choice and flexibility in purchasing cryptocurrency on our platform,"" the company declared, adding that it's continuing to update in-app guides and educational materials on the subject. PayPal first started letting users buy crypto in October 2020, marking another step toward the asset class' mainstream adoption, and later added the capabilities to its mobile payment app Venmo"
"Not surprised, PayPal is Godsend."
280-285 FridayNext week over 300 again
Next support is 275.00$ unless Cramer pumps it tonight.
is there really anyone still doubting PayPal and Venmo nowadays?? this stock is killer and is gonna be even better soon
Huge beat coming today. Zero reason PAYPAL does not hit a 52 week high after destroying top and bottom. They already told us they would last revenue conference call!
Oh Snap! No They Didn't...
We finally got back to $300 and then beaten up. I will happily hold PYPL again. Just hope it doesn't take months to rise again.
they expect 10-20% growth for 2021-2022 . Very low growth for a 70pe stock
How do you feel about earnings?
It’s into crypto and may be a trading platform with being a digital bank in the future!! Then it’ll be at $1000 !!!!
"Very long term holder here (years). I wish to see this base itself next over $300, and then go to $315-320 in a couple of months."
"The pattern of Shorts is always the same.They compared $SNAP, $ETSY, and $SQ to $FB, $AMZN and $PYPL and said they would no longer grow.Think about it. When you sell stocks, Hedge funds are buying."
All time highs today?
As someone who makes my living on EBay. This was expected. I think they did better than I thought they would do. Long on both ( PYPL was my preferred method for me over EBay for transacts￼ with my cash. they kept better records of previous sales with the same buyers and quickly turned money over
The street has set expectations very low for Pypl. Growth goals of 21% for all of 2021 will be exceeded on Sept 1.
Odds are the stock sells off after earnings like most everything else has.
"Pete Najarian on CNBC saying 6% drop is nothing. It needs to be another $50 lower. Guy also agrees that it should be below $240. A third guy (don’t know his name) agrees that he won’t buy it above $245. So do what you will with this info. I’m just the messenger, and I know I’ll wait."
What time will the rebound start? Will we see green by the end of the day? Is this an opportunity to load up before earnings? Thumbs up if you think yes.
Will we see 300 today
"PayPal Holdings Inc’s (NASDAQ: PYPL) payment app Venmo will soon allow users to sell products and services on their accounts for a fee effective July 20, the Wall Street Journal reports as the company disclosed.Previously users were prohibited from receiving money for business transactions through personal Venmo profiles, the violation of which leading to possible account suspension.Customers with business profiles will be liable to a 1.9% plus a 10-cent fee.It launched the first Venmo-branded physical credit card in 2020, focusing on the QR code on the front of the card and a flexible cash-back rewards program.Venmo gained more users during the pandemic by directly depositing stimulus checks into Venmo accounts.Venmo’s user base rose 32% in 2020 to nearly 70 million active accounts. About $51 billion was transferred via Venmo in Q1, growing 63% year-on-year. PayPal expects Venmo to generate almost $900 million in 2021 revenue.Venmo will add a toggle to its user interface that will allow customers to indicate if the money they are sending is for a good or service. Those transactions will be eligible for the app’s purchase protection plan to dispute charges for purchases that did not arrive or were not as expected.The transaction fee will get deducted from the amount sent.Price action: PYPL shares closed lower by 0.48% at $291 in the premarket session on the last check Monday."
I don't understand the fascination pay pal.I got an account back in 2004 and have only used it twice. So little that I have to look up the password and reactivate it each time. So many other alternatives.
Cramer says buy PYPL in the afternoon
"The RSI and the MACD look splendid,do what you want!"
I expect 3 to 4% bounce back monday
"Buy as much as you can here. There is too much liquidity in this market, Pypl is too strong and had a great ER. It will be bought up. Don’t listen to these short snake oil salesmen posters here."
"Paypal market cap 342 billion, Coinbase 57 billion, Net income Q2, PYPL 1.2 bil, Coin 1.6 bil."
Buy on the dip
"$280 by next week, given breakout on 1 hour charts and no reason to fall further."
"PYPL is,imo, is one of the best Fintech growth plays around. Basically the father of Fintech companies. They know financial services better than most banks and are the major player with incorporating crypto into their business plan for the future."
"Nice pop for PYPL, still holding till I see about $370.00. GLTA."
"There is something major wrong which we don’t know at all, this stock is unable to cross 280 mark, seems investors don’t believe in this company much now"
"For anyone thinking they had ""missed the boat"" over the past eighteen months, here's your opportunity. Bought more at close and added to an ever-growing position I've built over the last five years. PayPal is a leader. Longs will continue to be rewarded."
"No one is talking about the crypto limit increase? Just a reminder, $100k in crypto purchases is between 1.5-2k in revenue"
"2134 shares at 61. Thank you PYPl and if you haven’t had SQ with this from a even better holding. That’s on you, two horses is better than one in a sector like FinTech. Has more than enough chairs at the Dinner Room table. Stay long and buy when that chart shows you."
I literally just halfed my position this morning
Berkshire Hathaway should step up and buy in to PayPal! jmho
350$ target for when?
PYPL why don't you buy existing payment companys instead of trying to be socially accepted by the far left/progressive dems
"SELL ACTION - This is a PR STUNT.........PYPL is bleeding out .. the rich valuation means that it is not particularly attractive at the moment, and overall, I am neutral on the stock...........imho"
What’s up with all of these legal lawyer lawsuits etc.?
Not selling before touching $350 
Looking for 350 by Christmas
looks like bitcoin gain is helping PYPL grind up today
"CEO Dan Schulman should be buying fintch companys around the world, and stop trying to be socially accepted by the far left"
$300 is about 2 weeks
"On the 6-month chart it formed a perfect W formation, a bullish one."
Paypal is the fintech innovation !!!!!!!!
"PayPal losing users and business to new Defi companies like SOFI that have better mobile apps and crypto trading , stock trading , banking all under one site.Sell PYPL buy SOFI for much higher % gains next 3 to 5 years"
79 people here reading. and scare that they lost bigDown $20-17 now.Folks PYPL missed with weaker guidance.

Beware of Jim Cramer. Watch on video Jim Cramer admitting to manipulating the stock market and read how Jon Stewart tore into Cramer when Cramer told all his viewers to buy Bear Stearns just before the company collapsed
"$FB $PYPL sorry about ur loss, couldn't have predicted that.But large caps ran hard early this year and priced for perfection. It's going to be small cap summer with how beat down Russel index has been last few weeks. Come over to $WISH and get ur money back."
"There is no green tomorrow. I am a long term holder and there was good and bad. However, guidance was not good. When the stock is at a premium this report indicates a pullback. The question is how big a drop. This is a very good company but let's not get caught up in this does not matter."
Come to $SQ PayPal Shareholders!
@queenie When not if this stock gets back over 300 is not the time to sell it is the time to strap in for the next leg up.
"Jul 15, 2021 - PayPal's Venmo has more than 70 million users, with steady user growth expected in the future. Square's Cash App has 36 million users, and yet people wonder who is dominating the space."
"My only stock up at the moment, holding for a while."
Paypal to introduce stock trading in the us
Here is actually a good opportunity to enter more positions. Fundamentals remain unchanged for PYPL
Any speculations on this week for PayPal?
Is anyone paying attention to what MercadoLibre (MELI) is doing? I assure you PayPal stockholders should be!
Please drop to $275 and I will jump in.
it's on sale
TPV $16 BILLION more than estimates. THAT IS $16 BILLION!!!! Over a 36% increase YOY. That is HUGE! Do not like the slight drop in free cash flow but it is still over $1 BILLION dollars this quarter.
Square much better than PayPUKE  told you guys a million times
9 months ago was 180$Great buying opportunity at 300 and more
This will be back at 295 by aug end. I am not an investor yet in PayPal but I believe in PayPal a lot.
On way to 300+
PayPal should buy Siebert Financial to transition into brokerage business?
"The 300 weekly puts I paid $1, $2, $3 $4 & $5 for and I bought a TON are worth about $20 now. Why didn’t everyone buy them? We all knew about EBay and the CEO lies"
30000$ waiting to buy more sharesPatience is the key
Remember the drama queens hyping up the devastation for Pypl due to the loss of ebay exclusivity? One year has passed and it seems no one cares lol...
"If it's not asking too much, could anyone please explain the rationale for the price action today, Friday? I can understand a bit of pessimistic behaviour wrt detachment from Ebay, however it still seems PayPal has a lot of popularity as a small payment platform. It seemed in the worst case it would break down with sell pressure, profit taking (if any) and moderate sell pressure, until hitting support at around 277.5, however it seems it broke past support and is hovering 275.I suppose in the long term this movement is of relevance only if one wants to further add to one's position, but nevertheless i'm curious as to the public sentiment from the latest earnings and recent price action."
"Just used my venmo debit card for the first time... nothing special, but nothing worse either. Hoping a lot of people start using those"
Question on buying bitcoin in paypal - and what paypal does.Say there is $1 US$ million capital inflow to Paypal which buys crypto. There is not bitcoin redemptions (converting back to fiat)Under the covers - will Paypal purchase $1 US$ million worth of bitcoin?
This reversal to new highs is going to move quick. I'm loaded up with $COIN $GBTC $ETHE $MARA $SQ $PYPL $RIOT $MSTR $SOFI $ARKK and even a little $BITQ Adding shares to my collection. I think we move strong through summer. Any thoughts?
quick 10% gain in a month from here I'm sure.
"I love Pay Pal, easy to use, safe, just used it this morning to accept a payment. Happy to see it heading towards the 52 week high and hopefully much higher."
"I see a lot of ""Paypal alert Lawsuit"" in the news recently. Does anyone know the impact of this?"
"$PYPL will only go into stock trading if Payment for Order Flow is allowed. Another reason PFOF will continue to be allowed and platforms like $HOOD will continue thriving.Even if the SEC chairman mentioned banning it is on the table, PFOF isn't going anywhere.Keep buying. Keep holding."
Right time to buy pypl?
"Venmo fee increases begin today, right?"
Paypal market cap exceeds that of Bank of America today
Overreaction ... time to buy 
Paypal without eBay is toast.Add to this the bonus of woke management? Buh bye.
Classic bear trap. After hours volume last night and this a.m. was extremely light. That was a dead giveaway of a bear trap
3 days left from the earnings date.. expecting ath.. am positive
"Whatever short said this will be down 20% tomorrow might as well say PayPal will be going bankrupt tomorrow. Dude, they beat earnings, they didn't lose money and they never will. This is a profiting money making machine."
"Old news, every bank let you buy stocks anyway"
Volume is higher lately. Maybe a fund is unloading it. I'm staying. It's the same company I bought. Ebay departure was old news
With crypto skyrocketed this weekend this opens and closes 285ish. Watch

Looks like the weekly chart could have painted the cleg of a flat correction and the camarilla pivot is showing a confirmed S3 sell. There are lots of out stocks showing similar market break-down signs. COVID 2.0 could be the Catalyst￼ to help get this started.
"after the Europe news for paypal today, very strange action. Shocked it is not much higher."
Hold on to yourselves.

dont in panic boys. it is going to recover pretty quickly
this thing is going to be fine. massive profits. massive market share. easy buy on the way back up
"Paypal stock is worth 6 times of Coinbase. Q2 PYPL, netted 1.2 billion, Coinbase 1.6 billion."
If I had a set I would certainly buy some September 280 calls here.I don’t play options. Not anymore.
"In my view, like SQ, PYPL is a very formidable Crypto stock."
"PayPal is going to build out every capability they can to leverage their massive customer base. Stock trading was floated months ago and the crypto platform is going to continue to evolve as well. Throw in additional perks for ""members only"" like discount deals on popular products and first-access purchases to live music and theater events, too. One word: Juggernaught."
"You can't fault the logic of $MSTR.. the value to shareholders derived by stacking sats is second to none, but it's clear why Michael Saylor showed personal affirmation to BitFarms. $BITF is everything right about the ecosystem.. 99% green, highest amount of BTC mined (and largest percentage of mined bitcoin added to treasury). By the end of the year, they should have over 4,000 BTC locked away and by the end of '22, that's likely to at least double. The average person is far more likely to see rapid increases in the value of their holdings by holding BitFarms than by holding BTC itself. As more institutions realize the kind of value hedge BitFarms affords, $BITF is headed to value parity with high multiple, high growth companies like $MSTR, $V, $COIN, and $PYPL ...and according to this recent interview, it's already begun https://twitter.com/Bitfarms_io/status/1416161910328856579?s=20"
I'm buying some at the end of the day
I'm glad I sold this roller-coaster before earnings.
If I were Vlad Tenev I'd be defecating in my pants right about now.
Good breakout from $302 after double bottom

Open at $290 tomorrow
Not seeing a bright future for companies like this with the new $600 rule. Add their wokeness quotient and its a double hit. Add competition and its a third hit. Add an overvalued market and its a 4th hit. Add the pandemic winding down (not thinking this spike will last) and thats a 5th hit. Cash will be king once again.
"paypal and square, I love you "
Good way to make money. Buy puts right before earnjngs and then wait a week and buy calls 4 months out. It’s money in the bank.
"PayPal price target raised to $360 from $330 at SusquehannaSusquehanna analyst James Friedman raised the firm's price target on PayPal to $360 from $330 and keeps a Positive rating on the shares. The analyst met with management and raised estimates following commentary on its recently announced pricing changes, Crypto engagement, and potential innovative wallet features."
"PayPal price target raised to $360 from $310 at Deutsche BankDeutsche Bank analyst Bryan Keane raised the firm's price target on PayPal to $360 from $310 and reiterates a Buy rating on the shares. The analyst sees a ""solid outlook for growth."" The new target price is based on 50 times 2023 estimated earrings, ahead of the payment networks, given PayPal's ""robust growth profile,"" which is warranted given the company's strong outlook over the mid-term and significant investments being made to enhance the digital wallet and drive engagement, Keane tells investors in a research note."
"If you haven't muted Salamander(aka ""mini salami"")Johnson do it. His post history is brutal. You can see how flip flop short he is. Bye FELICIA!"
226 is the lowest it will go to about a $50 haircut.
"403 million Active User Accounts!“Still, the long-term growth story remains intact. “With more retail sales shifting online every day, PayPal's position as a leading provider of digital payment solutions should serve its shareholders well in the decade ahead.”""Our platform now supports 403 million active accounts, with an annualized TPV run rate of approximately $1.25 trillion,"" CEO Dan Schulman said. ""Clearly PayPal has evolved into an essential service in the emerging digital economy."""
Can it reach 300 by year end?
"PYPL has been on an absolute tear recently.........it is healthy for the stock to take a dip of this size at this time.....however, PYPL is going higher, much much higher over time..."
THANK U FOR THE DIP. NOTHING BUT AN ANAZING COMPANY.
It will be up tomorrow for sure
"This will move up upon launch of power PayPal app version, anyone knows the launch date?"
"Look at square, we need big news for PayPal to go up"
272.75- 273.20 range for closing. Not sure exactly why we got double downed on today but certainly added here at 269’s.
Guy Adami talking about buying the stock at 240 on The fast money show just now. This guy is borderline #$%$ at the best of times.This is a great long-term play on the fintech space. Will be well over 300 in the near future
"Oh look, all those shares that were panic sold for no reason are being snapped back up. What a surprise."
I usually don't like to get too crazy positive but this looks like new highs before earnings.
"Friends, the reason for the decline is because it is the first quarter that reflects the lost revenue from eBay moving away from PayPal. It was bound to have an impact. If you see paypal beyond their eBay relationship, this wouldn't come as a surprise and doesn't affect the long term outlook."
Screaming buy on this sell off.
300 strike price for Friday is HEAVY.....buy now. this is this weeks low...really.
"Never understood the Paypal is better/worse than Mastercard arguments. I own Paypal, Visa, Mastercard and Square. I also own a ton of FINX. These investments have created generational wealth for me. Bullish on all 5."
Talk about oversold. It never fails with tech or fintech anymore. Chipotle can beat and the stock goes up 20%. PayPal beats and down it goes. I truly don’t get it anymore. Whatever.
What just happened?
love the positivity in this page! we need to stay strong with one goal! GO PAYPAL
Price targets will be under significant revision after next weeks earnings. Looks like another blockbuster!
The shorts are lying people. Hold and be rewarded. It's called a long term stock for a good reason. Don't let the lying shorts take your shares.

"4 those moving some $$ to other payment co, $V-Visa is now back in serious growth (40%+ YOY EPS growth & 26.6% YOY Rev growth) w/o huge share price growth as others during pandemic. These figures are just the start as the U.S. economy was just starting to open the 2nd half of Q3 & travel (where $V makes a lot of it’s $$ is just getting started). Forget to mention the rest of the world just starting to open, Fee increases coming in the future as well as high growth rates in countries like India where other Credit Card companies such as $MA and Amex are now banned in adding any new users due to breaking India’s Data laws and its got a long streak ahead!** I am a current owner of $PYPL, $V & $MA"
Bottoming out. PYPL is now ready to scream higher. Buckle up!

It's been a long slow turn around for PYPL but I'm not selling this until it's back over $300.00.
"Beats earnings but tanks... marketmakers is just doing whats obvious. New normal is to never bet with MM's in short term, go in long at the right moment"
I expect PYPL to be back above $300 over the next month. This dip is a gift…It’s the future of banking.
$pypl earnings missed due to $sq impact. Jump to $sq the future
"Sold my 500 shares this am and had a hunch I’d regret it when earnings were announced. Glad my hunch was wrong. Like PYPL and will buy it again. Sure seems like the whole market should correct, not just PYPL. I’ll wait a while to get back into the stock."
Paypal can't handle the growing fraud problems. I sold my stock. I'm out.
I don't know about y'all whining but I manage to scoop more shares @$277 hehe
"Not as bad as I thought it could be. I assumed a 5% - 8% loss today and we are on the lower end. Sentiment is still positive today. The report was generally very good. That will be priced in in the coming weeks. For example, volume increased 40 percent without Ebay. 11.4 million new users. People are upset with rev miss but it did grow 32 million without Ebay and guidance there was maintained."
hey now
Coinbase netted more than PYPL in Q2 (1.6 bil) with 1/7th market share.

Gonna buy this dip.... just a short pullback. Going $350 by the end of the year.

Two steps up... One step back... Then repeat.
PYPL has been down for 2.5 weeks I think this will stabilize between $280-$290 for the next 2-3 weeks before we reach $300 again. Take advantage of this week's pullback.
Build a big enoug bear trap and you catch lots of shorts.
How did they miss on the top line? These kind of companies are like a cash machine.
How can I trade my crypto? Please someone should help me
"No worries, buy this dip going back to 300+ sooner than you think!"
When is Venmo going to give you ownership of a crypto wallet allowing users to transfer the cryptocurrencies at will?
When is PYPL going to make a move to increase their customer/Revenue base.
"Since the price drop is an after-hours attempt by large financials to steal shares, what are the chances that this hold sfor the opening tomorrow morning? Is there something fundamentally wrong with PYPL's business? If the share price remains depressed in the AM, time to buy more shares and cheap options. No real reason to sell, just because WALL Street wants your hard-earned money."
"Well, this is another no-brainer in the making. I’ll take all I can get on this pull-back!"

PYPL is way more profitable and is still growing 24% YoY, it's a safe haven if I ever saw one."
Earnings is today or tomorrow
Added at 285.70. Very impressed w the strength and all of the buy ratings. Today was a large gift if you are long.
"Salamander is the typical fool who lives in the board of a particular stock because he is either a former employee who got fired or he lost in a short squeeze or sold too soon.At 275 this is almost oversold but also it cant go much lower w a pe ratio of 69 from a fresh +1,200% increase in earnings. Having this at 200 like this fool claims will leave it in a pe ratio of 48-49 which wont happen for a company that in a year will report 150 or even 200% increase in earnings.Wont go below 270."

Buy PayPal buy SQ and retire on a beach in 7 years
"PYPL reducing Q3 estimates was smart vs getting walloped at time of reporting. Buy, hold, beat the market."
"My only concern is the take rate. Although, I’m not certain if they are including P2P transactions in the take rate since they count it in TPV. If it does count them, then take rate is looking good because P2P is growing faster than transactions. However, if it doesn’t, Pypl may be in trouble."
Wow! Is everyone okay?! Fasten your seatbelt.
Next week over 300 againBuy and hold long
Can’t wait for the super app
"Earnings will be EPIC.Sandy Travis, has target price of $330 per share."
Tomorrow green day Buy more shares now before closing
nothing changed. its still a buy / strong buy stock. the 2nd quarter miss was unexpected by everyone. we just need to not overreact. I haven't sold a share.
let's call Jim Cramer tonight and get his thoughts on PayPal. 800 743 2622
Is this a buy tomorrow then
"Well, when this thing finally cracks $300 new ATH's will be close... 10 year rate declining... super bullish for PYPL... not so much for banks."
I don't even used PayPal. What's all the hype about ?
Didnt go below 270 as expected.See you at +300 before 8/20
"Unnecessary stress, PYPL would bounce back to 300+ in a few weeks."
"Companies like Paypal don't want to hoard private crypto such as Bitcoin etc. because they anticipate a future regulatory environment not conducive to crypto and a gradual shift to state digital currencies.So they will then start selling their crypto by opening their own crypto exchanges and offering the lowest trading fees. This enables them to acquire a new source of revenue by way of trading fees, as well as dump their holdings of crypto on you."
what a great results and guidance. good conference call! we will see green tomorrow.
$300 tomorrow !
"Deja vu. Good earnings, sell off. upgrades, recovery, news, more upgrades. So, I bought more. If fact, every time they play this tune, that is what I am going to do."
Wgaf about eBay? Have never bought anything off of eBay. Absolutely nothing.
I think $PYPL is due for a reversal soon. Hopefully we break 280 either Friday or next week. Double bottom strong support at 268-270 
Any projections for this week?
"CNBCPayPal is exploring a stock-trading platform for its U.S. customersPUBLISHED MON, AUG 30 202111:44 AM EDTKABOOM!!"
"Look to repurchase PYPL and wait for the price to settle, currently it's still going down, drops below 50 DMA. 200 DMA is $249, and hope it will hold, otherwise will wait in the sideline. Think SQ, AFRM and PYPL will all be good long term holds."
What do you think for today? Up or down for PayPal?
Fact: PayPal beat the consensus and that consensus analysis reflects itself the huge growth we've been having. Think logic.
Back up the truck. Why would anybody sell this stock with the holidays coming up and summer shopping. They have added so many good things. Jeffries on 6/30 raises price target to 330
Paypal went down enoughStart buying back
Who cares? Stock will overreact for awhile then look towards next ER and trend higher again
300 by July 16th
"If you're an actual investor you don't look at 1 quarter and decide to quit on a stock you know will be worth a fortune in the future. So what, they only beat by a small amount, look at Amazon, they don't beat once in awhile and their stock price is still going up, because they make a lot of cash, just like PayPal does, and PayPal's cost is very very low to make all that profit."
KABOOM Baby!!!
Great buying opportunityBuy and hold longNext week over 300 again
"Hold on to PYPL long term. As Interest rates go up, should help them grow, $400 - $425 this time next year. Add to your position if you have the opportunity, any dip"
"Matthew Lohr, has a target price of $360 per share for PYPL."
"PayPal reiterated BUY with a $360 price target at SusquehannaPayPal reiterated BUY with a $350 price target at JefferiesPayPal reiterated BUY with a $350 price target at CitiPayPal price target raised to $340 from $337 at Morgan Stanley, OverweightPaypal price target lowered to $340 from $345 at Raymond James, OutperformPayPal price target raised to $322 from $300 at RBC Capital, OutperformPaypal price target lowered to $315 from $330 at Piper Sandler, OverweightCiti analyst Ashwin Shirvaikar recommends buying PayPal shares today on the eBay-related selloff. Core PayPal is better without the ""eBay drag,"" Shirvaikar tells investors in a research note. The eBay transition is faster than expected, with it being largely done by Q3, says the analyst, who is ""struck by the non-eBay numbers."" He keeps a Buy rating on PayPal with a $350 price target.PayPal earnings to accelerate with attractive catalysts ahead, says Susquehanna Susquehanna analyst James Friedman noted PayPal (PYPL) posted robust results but for the sharp drop off in the eBay (EBAY) account. The analyst said with eBay largely gone, years 2021 and 2022 earnings look to accelerate and the rollout of the new wallet coupled with increased prices in the second half of the year, should enhance visibility. Friedman reiterated his Positive rating and $360 price target on PayPal shares."
"@Chris how is SQ going to expand when it has no spare cash like PYPL does? You don't think PYPL will expand it's portfolio with the huge access cash in hand they have already? SQ total cash 4B, SQ total debt 4.2B. PYPL total cash 13.09B, PYPL total debt 9.71B. Seems to me negative 200 million is a lot less than a positive 3.38B, cash in pocket. Positive cash along with positive profit %'s is king, just ask Google and Microsoft. I'm sorry but PYPL is 8.4 times more profitable than SQ and will be for a long long time, PYPL has everything flowing well on low cost and high profitability. PYPL profit % 22.80, SQ profit % 2.7. Do the math"
yeah just wait for the new platform launch!
Good buying opportunity here
"Buy Coinbase 80% net cashflow, 12% value of PYPL."
all in RED today... with lots of buy orders... and PYPL is good in green...
is $PYPL going to $300 with earnings?
PayPal ceo is not aggressive not like squares
"A fund trims 150,000 shares of PYPL and the market panics?"
I really want to see total payment volume broken down. Take out the P2P. If we see $1T on pypl branded products this decade then this will moon. That would be ~$40B in high margin revenue not including all other products/services
Square will go down tomorrow and investors will buy PayPal again
Look what they did to my boy lol
"We are going to cross $1T in total payment volume this year. When can we expect to cross $10T? $10T with a 2% take rate would be $200B in revenue. If they can net 25% (which I feel is low at this scale) we are talking $50B profit and $1T valuation at a 25 P/E. After looking at visa and MasterCards payment volume this seems inevitable to happen at some point, especially with current inflation"
LOL @ SQ spending $30B to buy Afterpay (at 42 x Forward P/S) of while $PYPL built their own BNPL for prob less than $50m!
"PYPL needs a shareholder activest, CEO Dan Shulman reacts too slow, that's why the stock is dropping. Needs to buy another company"
I thought Paypal had a good quarter and that selling was overdone. And today it went down again and Ebay and Amazon got hammered too. Wow - rough day.
"Anyone here remember when my Square was recently $190 and PayPuke  was $310? Look  now, BOTH $279!!!!!!"
Profit taking all weekSupport 269Buy and hold long
"Started a position and bought a share at the all time high $309. Earnings in 5 days, probably not missing…"
"I am so sorry that this earnings did not turned out to be great but seucked.Yesterday MSFT was down where I bought 150 shares at $10 down but during Q conference, MSFT recovered.I thought PYPL was going to be same like MSFT but did not.CNBC said $240 is a fair value price. I will wait for a pull back to $199."
To the moon .....
"Should PYPL buy Affirm??? Seems logical. Not sure how PYPL's own buy now, pay later model is going to compete against SQ with Afterpay"
Doesn’t look like anybody wants to buy this dip.
"I’m guessing the 50dma @ $280 will act as support, I’ll definitely be adding if we can get there."
"At this rate, Paypal may pass JP Morgan's market cap soon, becoming the 2nd most valuable financial company in the world just behind VISA."
Morgan Stanley today raises Paypal's price target to 340
Paypal is not your pal if you are conservative.
What are top three reasons that Paypal will go up in price?
Lot of things yet to come.... In the PayPal. PayPal will reach $400+.Will launch in China soon.
"These 3 Tech Companies Could Double Their Revenues by 2025 - PYPL, CRM, & VEEV"
I see easy break above $300!
Would have been high if it weren't for their crypto exposure
Welcome all to 300 club
Stop being divas. PYPL is an obvious long. Ebay transition is almost over. PYPL is still growing rapidly. This is a short term setback but it will be down tomorrow maybe 8%
Pypl in 5 years from now ? More than 500$ ?
SQ up another $20 PayPUKE down Remember PYPL was $100 higher than SQ last week? Now look SQ is even LOL
"PayPal price target raised to $370 from $313 at Evercore ISIEvercore ISI analyst David Togut raised the firm's price target on PayPal to $370 from $313 and keeps an Outperform rating on the shares as he increased his 2022 forecasts and made adjustments to his model to incorporate the company's new pricing model that becomes effective on August 2. He expects preferential or lower pricing for larger merchants along with PayPal reinvesting 50% of incremental revenue generated, Togut tells investors."
Let’s Gooo!!!!
I told you the RSI and MACD looked splendid. What did you do??
Perfect time to buy the dip
This is my retirement plan. I wont sell this for the next 20 years!
Buy PayPal now at this price or wait for a dip???
