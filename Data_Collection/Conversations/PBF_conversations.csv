Liking the pre market 
Earnings estimates yet increased again overnight. Feeling good about this quarters earnings. 
Does this mean dividend is back?
Positive income!!! 100 M plus!!! Once they get EPA response this goes back to the $30s
This is last chance who wants to come in this train. easy $20 soon.
Spectaculat report!! Congratulations to management team of the company!! Amazing turnaround!!
Earnings are meaningless when it comes to PBF. What you need to be looking for is the cash flow from operations for this quarter. PBF needs about $150 mil in my estimate in order to cover capex and interest payments (it sounds like a big number but not when you consider they have almost $7 billion in sales/qtr). That will tell you if they're out of the hole or still bleeding cash.
This is one of the most manipulated stocks in the market!! 450% BEAT and stock down!! Market Capacity is a joke here!!
"Reuters Article -Oct 18 (Reuters) - U.S. refiners are expected to show higher earnings for the third quarter as margins to sell gasoline and diesel have improved despite the surging cost of crude oil, analysts said.After more than a year of depressed fuel demand, gasoline and distillate consumption is back in line with five-year averages in the United States, the world's largest fuel consumer. That has boosted margins on refined products to more than double what those companies were making at this time a year ago.The seven largest independent U.S. refining companies, including giants Marathon Petroleum (MPC.N) and Valero Energy (VLO.N), are projected to post an average earnings-per-share gain of 66 cents, versus a loss of $1.32 for the third quarter of 2020, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. (GRAPHIC: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-REFINERIES/EARNINGS-OUTLOOK/mopanjqyzva/)Those gains are driven by the 3-2-1 crack spread, a proxy for refining margins, which assumes a barrel of crude oil is refined to three parts gasoline, two parts diesel and one part jet fuel. That spread is currently at $21 per barrel, compared with around $9 a year ago."
we going 15.5 today
This is so funny
Over $15 this week. $18 by January. Refiners will take a few setbacks from the Branden vaccine mandate which will drive off quite a few workers and slow production. But we will get there.￼
the recently released sept short interest in pbf was 15.67 million shares which was a rather large increase.WHAT do the supposed intelligent short sellers know that us bullish longs might have overlooked ?
It will ease up on to $18 from here pretty quick￼
Earnings Report was OUTSTANDING this morning. I wish the media would report on it more like they do with the bigger companies.
Monster report coming!!! Way way undervalued!!!!!!!!!!
$30 by the fourth quarter 2021 earnings report. Go PBF!!
"Management of PBF must effectively communicate company's current standing with the cash flow, production and Q4 market expectation. The market will punish this stock in absence of any good information from MGT at this point."
"- Third quarter income from operations of $100.9 million (excluding special items, third quarter income from operations of $101.0 million)- Repurchased a combined $229 million of principal amount of unsecured notes, a 13% reduction of the total PBF Holding unsecured notes outstanding- Year-to-date consolidated debt reduced by over $300 million through note repurchases and continued deleveraging at PBF Logistics LP- Third quarter consolidated ending cash balance of approximately $1.5 billion"
"$260 mil cash flow from operations - more than enough to cover interest payments and capex, back to normal pre-covid profitability. The likelihood of bk goes down very significantly and barring any new meltdown in oil business, PBF debt will be upgraded to investment grade status within a year or so imo."
EPA news coming
Monster report!!! 400 millions plus difference between 2020 and 3Q 2021!!! 100 M positive!! Amazing recovery!!
Mkt cap is way to low not even $2 b mkt cap should. Be around $20 b PBF is thee largest refiner in North America
Deleted?
"So everybody is saying that tomorrow this stock is going to post monstrous earnings , yet today drops like a brick. How can this be explained ?"
 what will it take for this to move?
"The estimated earnings keep getting better and better day by day. Yahoo even moved it up .05 cents from last night. This stock has taken a breather this week, but soon to take off. "
"The worldwide shortage of gasoline is expected. I cannot post the link because Yahoo deletes my comment whenever I do that. Also, the gas price in California is $4.5 gallon, and some area is over $5. The revenue for this quarter, especially from Martinez refinery, will be huge."
im still saying 20 by years end.
Where is that guy who told us a month ago about PBF bonds and how the bondtraders supposedly know better than anyone else and PBF's bonds are trading at distressed levels 30-50 cents on the dollar? Where are they trading now?
Tremendous Q3
Thursday!
Zack’s upgraded PBF to a BUY this morning since they are going to beat earnings estimates. Not bad.
"The company is now in positive balance , congrats next summer $35"
This worth at least $25 right now!! As soon as we get news from EPA this will breakout hard!!!!!
All the refiners are down today trying to get people to sell keep them I wouldn’t sell oil keeps going up
Interesting that PBFX is selling at a 5.5 pe and paying a tax free distribution of over8.50 %
"from zack's equity researchPBF Energy gained 10.8% yesterday on the news. In the United States, the company is among the largest independent petroleum refiners. Improving fuel demand is also aiding the stock. In 2021, the company is likely to see bottom-line growth of 54.9%."
"Morgan Stanley Adjusts PBF Energy's Price Target to $17 from $12, Keeps Equalweight Rating."
I’m not selling long here
