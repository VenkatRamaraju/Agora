Oil is down today
Oil is red today
I’m liking that after hours.￼
Shorted???????
"PBF is giving an investment forum presentation thursday.it has been 20 months since they have done so per their website.i hope they finally have something quite positive to say. if not, why accept the invite ?the share turnover the past several weeks suggests the shares are in strong hands."
Wells Fargo analyst Roger Read downgrades PBF Energy (NYSE:PBF) from Equal-Weight to Underweight and lowers the price target from $10.5 to $8.
"NYSE it’s a real jungle! The HFs are inflating Robinhood share to make a huge profit, then exit and come-back on shares undervalued like PBF. It’s Incredible how they are doing huge profits based on some people being naive."
Really no resistance in the chart until the 12-13 area. I'm making a huge gain here. I'm happy for others that are too.
"Management of PBF must effectively communicate company's current standing with the cash flow, production and Q4 market expectation. The market will punish this stock in absence of any good information from MGT at this point."
"At the point when I saw declarations everywhere I thought they were bots or that they were made up till I was persuaded and gave it a try and genuinely I don't regret the move I made on the grounds that I invested my reserve funds, and now my first speculation with him acquired me benefits of more than $87,000 and its still running! Steve continues to convey and procure predictable benefits for me. He's awesome"
I expect consolidation between $10 and $12 before moving higher.
Well they just said jet fuel shortages on the west coast how could that possibly be bullish for the future earnings outlook…
"Remember when I said I never loose and I always get at least 20% profit and I will win, yup I won again."
"Bought another 1.000 shares at 9.22, now owning 12.000 shares. This up and down is to discourage us and say “would have been better to do some trading”. But it’s not, Hold is the most suitable solution."
PBF is planning to sell up to 1 billion shares??!!????
"IMO it is starting to break out and commence a step ascent, i.e. a descent from John's perspective... Lets see how it closes today and tomorrow."
where can i see the put value ?
"Called the continuation sell off today. Just saying. Chart looks negative, the chart monkeys will take it down. No problem for a savy investor who takes advantage of the monkeys in the market."
"I don’t think PBF needs $1.5 billion in cash for working capital, so once they feel more confident about future cash flows, they’d be wise to use some of it to buy back debt."
Very interesting market indeed. Up and down by 10% a day? Without any news? This stock is a gambler's pit.
"The 26 and 28 bonds are trading down, I would say almost 'going-concern' down. They are in the 50s. Going bankrupt bonds usually trade in the 40s and 30s. Bond holders are more savvy and more risk averse than equity buyers. In commodities right now you are seeing bonds trade low and stocks high and vice versa. Really strange."
"Shorts will only start covering above $10 - so sit back and relax and don't even consider selling. The time to consider selling will be the time when herd-following jerkoff analysts upgrade, which I suspect will be in the mid teens."
"Very nice close. If oil holds above $70 next week, we may go to $11 - $12. Still I think this will be the top of the trading range until earnings."
Very nice move - sold some covered calls - I believe we're going to be range bound $11 - $12 until earnings.
"LOL, jerkoff analysts - they have a special knack to downgrade at the bottom of the cycle and upgrade at the top... I told you: always do the opposite!"
"It needs a green day today to remain in the established uptrend. Not sure what will happen here, but I still believe in the near term it should make a higher high, be it in a few days or weeks..."
News this weekend ????????
Get ready for $4 gal gasoline
"It missed touching the 9.00 - 9.30 levels by a few cents most of the day 9.02-9.25 except for the opening minutes). It is like John is shorting in a narrower range to avoid taking another pounding by me in particular... Then again it didnt hit 9.00 again yet so even if it goes above 9.30 that wont trigger any profit taking by me unless of course it hits 9.00 first. Anyway tomorrow is another day, pretty sure I will get filled at 9.00 again and be able to make it 5 wins."
"Gregory, we should let John rest in peace and focus on PBF :) because I think the bottom was reached and now we should stay calm until PBF hits 17-18 USD per share. Even I have a significant number of shares (20.000) I don’t want to sell cheap and lose a perfect opportunity for doing big money. Therefore let’s concentrate on our “target” and let John living in his “world” :))) I was so many times cheated by HF, that’s should be my answer to them - maximizing my profit on PBF"
"Is it you John desperate to cover some into the close? I guess you noticed it is hard and costs a lot to push it down but when you need to cover there is little volume available ;) keep shorting, I will keep my shares out of your reach until you are begging for shares at 15+ ;)"
"Trend is currently to sell into the crowd rushing in at the open and then keep selling it down til the crowd bails, then pump it, i think PBF is a horrible trading instrument right now while it is being traded on ownership ratios between MMS and retail. It becomes to psychological and irrational to trade on fundamentals. I am thinking of just staying long and not checking in for a few weeks or months come and focus on trading in other stocks."
Decided to buy some bonds at 50% face value and 14% yield. It seems the big selloff happened right after the interest payment so it was a calculated hold and sell.
John I check all your recent post/reply. You always comment short AMC/CLOV/PBF but most of retail investors are bullish for the 3 stock. I guess you really are FUD now.
"So what's at stake? Obviously, if PBF returns to normal, pre-covid profitability, even if it takes another year or two, you have the potential to triple your money from current levels ($9). However, this comes at a risk: PBF cannot keep borrowing money forever at ever increasing rates, just to refinance old debt and pay for capital expenditures. So even though it is not a distressed company yet, the risk is relatively high (not in the near future though). That's why I have a small position in PBF - don't be the farm on it. I personally think they will improve cash flows throughout the year and once flights are back to normal, will potentially be close to pre-covid margins. The difference with pre-covid is that they are now burdened with more debt than ever, which may take years to reduce to acceptable levels, so no dividend in the foreseeable future."
"Go up, PBF, up! "
"I got out with a 10% loss, Hopefully i can buy back at 7-7.50 range"
"Interesting...Unusual Options Activity Insight: PBF Energy2:31 pm ET July 29, 2021 (Benzinga) PrintShares of PBF Energy (NYSE:PBF) saw some unusual options activity on Thursday.

Is pbf really going bankrupt?
"The bottom has been reached, Gents! On a very bad market, PBF is keeping its value above 9, that’s very good! Now it should start going up :)"
When are we going to breakout to the upside from these levels? After earnings?
When can it go back to 20? I think end of this year might be?
There still trying to short this showing more sells than buys
"Early March and Early June, many oil companies hit their highest price in 2021, so to compare that with this trend:Early March - XOM - $ 60~61 MPC - $ 57~58 VLO - $ 80~81 PBF - $ 18~19Early June - XOM $ 64~65 MPC $ 63~64 VLO $ 84~85 PBF - $ 18~19So, MPC already hit the early June price. XOM is approaching early March price. VLO and PBF are nowhere near those high prices right now. To me, that means VLO and PBF are not attracting investors as much as they did back in March and June. If the whole oil market stays bullish for the next few weeks, or VLO/PBF has something attractive to take more pie from other major oil companies, it will definitely retrieve March/June glory. But will it? What do you think? How long do you think this bullish market will last?"
"Gents, I think shorts will try to squeeze PBF today again. But pay attention: I have the feeling that value stocks will start increasing soon. Amazon lost more than 6% today while Chevron and Exxon started to increase. So don t even think to sell PBF today because it’s a high chance to lose it."
Not sure how this will play out could be good to raise for capitol
we will see 7 today.
Are we ever going to get out of this swamp?
pbf in Paulsboro is turning on ccr to make hydrogen and starting chd1 for low sulfur diesel
I'm sick to my stomach.
"paying $4.2 per gallon of gas in Utah as I pass through. Only a matter of time before oil companies, up and down the chain reach record revenue. Of course the marketing will be blah blah blah."
"Environmental Protection Agency has proposed a retroactive reduction in biofuel mandates, effective 2020, in very welcome news to oil refiners who have been complaining of the costly mandates.Citing two unnamed sources familiar with the proposal, Reuters reports that the document was sent to the White House to be reviewed on Thursday, adding that it will likely deepen the rift between oil refiners and biofuels producers whose interests are at complete odds in the fuel blending department.""The proposal aims to get the (Renewable Fuel Standard) program back on track while addressing challenges stemming from decisions made under the prior administration,"" the EPA said in a statement as quoted by Reuters."
PBF Energy is up 9.32% to 9.15
"Oil melting faster than refined product today, a nice circumstance leading to widening cracks. PBF trending lower with the rest of the energy sector due to oil. This is what is called an improvement in fundamentals. I hope John is adding more shorts, it is always nice to know there is an established buyer growing in size :)"
Over $15 this week. $18 by January. Refiners will take a few setbacks from the Branden vaccine mandate which will drive off quite a few workers and slow production. But we will get there.￼
What do you project/expect from the upcoming earning? Do you think the EPS would be finally a positive number? Do you think dividends will be back? What are your thoughts?
"The technicals are clear, we are heading into a quickening period as the bollinger bands contract. Either a massive move up or down in the coming weeks. Fundamentally it should move higher on an NPV calculation but there is always a chance the shorts will go haywire and throw everything they have at it to get it to break down on the chart. I think within a week we will know which direction the market wants to take it at this juncture, possibly a break down to fake out the technical traders could be followed by the rebound to new highs but that is just a scenario to consider. I will hold what I have, keep trying to trade the 9.00-9.30 range with 1000 shares and buy the breakout above 10.50 or add on the way down."
looking excellent boys  up over $2000 since Monday
poppit to 20
"I will become the best psychologist and then make millions on NYSE. Because this is all about! Not fundamentals, financials, ratios, Market, etc…. How strong you are when the share is going down (to keep your confidence at maximum level) or going up (to maximize your bet). I bet PBF will be my no 1 share and I m really confident about it."
Snagged on to 780 shares today. I’m in. It will be $18 by years end. So much potential here
Solid week ahead of us
Closing &15????
The stock is ready to boom now that the market has digested it's great .38 GAAP earnings from last quarter. No one on wall street thought they were going to make money and they did. This stock is going to boom over the next few months.
Strong open but looks like it was sold into. Will check in later to see which direction it is going today. My gut tells me it will go lower today looking at the chart but we shall see.
Down again time to buy
R1 7.79 go baby go …..upwards options pinning taking hold as expected and posted on yesterday……R2 is 8.15 …note the acceleration in volume as buy stops are taken out …….shares are HTB so mini squeeze arama is on …..3.2 mm shares traded already is well above average for noontime= bullish
"John, invest all your funds and try to keep PBF down, it’s too high now!  I m not selling my shares even you give me 11.00 Per share now :))) so confident I am"
"I think market is pricing in damage at the Chalmette Refinery. PBF’s Alliance Refinery is one hour away and has standing water.From markets perspective, no news is bad news when it comes to a status report for Chalmette refinery."
"Join Reorg on Thursday, Sept. 30, at 12 p.m. ET as we discuss PBF Energy’s background, recent financial results and the regulatory challenges it faces in the latest installment of our webinar series: https://reorg.zoom.us/webinar/register/2716328433982/WN_Zy0RwaetTaygDycNXNTCog"
"AGRICULTURE | OIL 24 Aug 2021 | 16:39 UTCREFINERY MARGIN TRACKER: US margins take a hit as EPA mandate uncertainty roils RINs pricesDecoupling RINs a possibilityThere is a likelihood the 2021 EPA mandate will decouple the D6 ethanol RINs from the D4 biomass diesel RIN, having a greater impact on the D6 RINs, as refiners continue to recover from the drop in refined product demand wrought by the coronavirus pandemic, according to some analysts and refiners.""In 2020, the ethanol blending requirement into gasoline was a brutal 11.5%, yet the actual blend rate was only 10.5%, a level basically unchanged over the past five years. Thus, refiners had to use D4 RINs to cover D6 obligations, pulling D6 prices up near D4 levels,"" wrote Tudor Pickering Holt analyst Matthew Blair in a research note.Blair calculated that an EPA rollover in either volume or blending requirements from 2020 into 2021 will continue the shortage of D6 RINs. D6 RINs account for about 69% of total refinery RIN cost.""Thus, any efforts by the EPA to reduce the D6 blending mandate and decouple D6s from D4s could be very beneficial for refiners,"" he added.The price of D6 RINs, which averaged $1.5318/RIN for the week to Aug. 20, is down almost 10% from the week earlier, while the price of D4 RINS fell about 5% week on the week, to average $1.6978/RIN, Platts assessments showed."
PBF reduction in price is not fundamentally correct! Nothing has changed since the share was 18 USD. It’s just a manipulation to have more shares when infrastructure bill is in place and the 579 billion USD spending on roads/bridges start to fly. PBF is a bitumen/asphalt producer.
"as I've predicted few days ago, this is going to 7 first, then 6."
Mizuho Securities analyst Silvio Micheloto maintained a Buy rating on PBF Energy (PBF – Research Report) on July 29 and set a price target of $20.00. The company’s shares closed last Friday at $9.17.
bond prices haven't fallen like equity pricesPBF 7.25% 2025 sitting at 69 - 69.2PBF 6% 2028 sitting at 63 - 64.3PBF 9.25% 2025 sitting at 95.7 - 96.65
Long the common at 7.565 just now …….very short duration oversold bounce trade…trade entered about 3 min ago….
RSI is way overbought... Looks like many on the board got out a chunk of money the past few days. $11.00 looks like a near term target on the chart. I presume John's absence is confirmation that he lost his job at the trading house he was at while shorting PBF and putting all his account on the line on a linear gamble.
PBF BACK TO $18 BY YEAR END.
Chevron and PBF Energy filed separate lawsuits this week in Contra Costa County Superior Court against the Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD) Source: https://www.kqed.org/news/11887837/chevron-pbf-sue-air-district-over-new-bay-area-refinery-pollution-rule - PBF — the second company — has argued that having to buy and install a device to meet the particulate matter reduction requirements would force it to shut down its Martinez refinery.
"CNBC Depumper, you are getting excited too early, the MMs are trading it in a range, it needs to break 10 to have a chance to start running... until then, just relax and take advantage of John being short, I already banked another $300 from his pocket selling 1000 shares at 9.30, already put in the money for a rinse repeat at 9.00..."
"So I noticed this 9.00 to 9.30 channel where a lot of volume is being traded so I put in 1000 shares at 9.00, got filled, put it in for 9.30. I will try repeating this trade since I know over time it will likely work and transfer $300 from John's pocket to my pocket. I will keep a tally and see how many times I can take him to the cleaners. :)"

We had 3 months of selling. Now it's time to buy!

Upgraded
"Gents, has any of you account opened on Reddit? But on that specific channel. Those guys were betting 2-3 months ago on PBF. In 30 minutes the share increased from 8 to 13 :))). Maybe we can convince them again. In this way we can teach a lesson to John and his friends who are betting against PBF."
The country can't afford to shut down again is what I am betting on
Long term investment in stocks is the ONLY to make it a positive experience
Is there any difference in this company two months ago when the stock price was at 18??
"sold today on the run up at $10.43, will look to re-buy in the low 10's and into the high 9's. this is great to trade or long term hold."
nice move back up on a down day. can't wait for this to pop!
"I am curious though, what made oil companies shoot so high a month and half ago? I think we have enough analytical assumptions on why we saw steep decline, so now I'm interested in the situation in June."
"Gents, based on my below analysis (20 min ago), let’s build a small SWOT analysis to share it with Reddit guys and other sites. What do you think?"
"For oil stocks there is "" blood in streets "" and is the time to buy oil stocks . World will surely come out of COVID 19 , variants will come and go and soon the world will be used to it . And life will become almost normal . Baron Rothschild, an 18th-century British nobleman and member of the Rothschild banking family, is credited with saying that ""the time to buy is when there's blood in the streets."" He should know. ... The original quote is believed to be ""Buy when there's blood in the streets, even if the blood is your own."""
Was a fun day here.
No just from people that work there
"This is bad. No one is interested in PBF anymore. Its current price is so unfair, but the market price also reflects emotions. It's like back to the beginning of pandemic, although the oil economy is doing better than pre-pandemic."
High. Manipulation here
"Wouldn't that be something if after watching the market go up for 2 years and the oil sector be in the gutter, that the oil sector starts going up and the market goes into the gutter?"
we hired 3 people from pbf in paulsboro and they said there calling people back and they will go back when they get called
"659k global cases yesterday, out of which 84k in US. However the banks would like their personnel to come-back to the office beginning of September. This means they want to start everything whatever it takes?"
Getting in today
"This is for Michael: “Nimbley (PBF CEO) added that domestic gasoline demand is about 95% of normal, distillate demand has fully recovered and is about 5% above historical levels, with jet lagging at 75% of normal levels, as coronavirus-related international travel remains low as other countries have faced a bumpier vaccine rollout than the US.California is the bright spot for PBF in the near term as refinery margins there surpass other regions. PBF said it has seen a rise in gasoline demand on the US West Coast to about 97% of normal, and its two refineries are running at 85% of capacity, supporting stronger regions.""We're bullish on gasoline right now,"" Nimbley said, noting the sentiment is ""primarily about mobility and the state opening up on June 15.""California's diesel demand keeps rising, with the major port of Long Beach posting record cargo demand at 40-year highs, ""Which means there is diesel demand when you unload those containers and transfer across the whole country,"" Nimbley said.USWC cracking margins for benchmark Alaska North Slope are averaging $16.01/b so far in the second quarter, compared with the first quarter's average of $13.15/b. Arab Medium coking margins are averaging $17.59/b in Q2, compared with $14.04/b in Q1, according to S&P Global Platts Margin data.""While these [USWC] tailwinds will partially reverse based on guidance of greater [USWC] headwinds in 2Q to 4Q, management's tone on the refining macro was much improved, leading to a material increase in 2Q utilization guidance,"" according to Phil Gresh, of JP Morgan.PBF's second USWC throughput guidance, which consists of its two California refineries, is an average of 300,000 b/d, compared with the first quarter's throughput of 231,700 b/d.”These are real facts, MIchael “the shorter” :))) you are just a story teller with no real arguments behind. Sorry for that!"
"More about the cash flows from operations: $78 million per quarter is obviously not enough. PBF needs at least $150 million per quarter in order to cover capital expenditures and interest payments. It sounds pretty lofty but it really isn't. First we have to assume that since spreads improved throughout the quarter, almost half of cash flows were generated in June. That puts them currently at $100 mil + per quarter. That is not enough either. However, with sales of $7 billion per quarter, a mere 1% improvement in gross margins puts PBF at $170 mil per quarter. Just to show there is plenty of leverage and room for margins/profits to grow and the general direction in the refining business is still pointing up with continued improvement throughout the rest of the year."
some insider buying would be helpful at this point. Holding some 2028 bonds. The 2025 and 2028 are getting sold off. The 2025 is offering now at 58 with a staggering 25 yield to maturity. Might take a punt on those. You guys reckon PBF can hold on that long given the Martinez debacle?
I remember Jim Cramer talking about buying 1000 puts to scare people as a strategy back in the day… wish I remembered what stock he was talking about
I’ve always done well with PBF.
"I am tempted to add here at 9.60 but if john’s shorts are not there anymore there might not be that guaranteed bid higher, tough choice…"
"On July 30, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) director, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, signaled “the war has changed” after warning “vaccinated people infected with Delta can transmit the virus.”"
Sold yesterday I knew it
"I have 20.000 shares, my brother in law almost 13.000, my godson close to 8.000 and his brother 3.000 shares - big family . So in total we have aprox 44.000 shares. We are all long so John cannot buy these shares. Do the same and our share will go up like a rocket "
"Oil stocks actually behaving well - no big selloffs despite decline in oil prices, buying on the dip. This bodes well. Once oil gets its footing we may finally see a significant rally across the board. This is well overdue since after the last couple of months correction many oil stocks are flat or just slightly higher YTD despiteich higher oil prices and vastly improved crack spreads and capital expenditures."
"25, here we come"
"I was looking at cash flow from operations number: around $78 million for the quarter. Good but not great. However, given that the stock is down 40% already prior to earnings, this should be a buy."
RINS issue.... is over
"I am still long. I Don't think much changed - last quarter showed significant improvement and next quarter will probably show additional improvement. The question is whether they can get to the amount of cash flow required to cover interest payments and capital expenditures - by my estimates at least $150 mil per quarter. I told you before, PBF is a buy but a risky investment, therefore only a small position in it. If they go under it won't be because of Covid, crack spreads or oil prices but because of a reckless expansion financed with debt in an industry known for its booms and busts. The issue of California tightening regulations as well as RINs were well known before the acquisition of Martinez. The sad thing is that the people responsible for this debacle are still at the helm and will probably get golden parachutes."
Good move epa. Going higher
"Short term PBF is overbought (up 50% in a week), medium and long term it's still oversold. I sold some at $10.87 - just to be on the cautious side. Still holding on to most of my shares."
"The RBOB GASOLINE VS BRENT CRACK SPREAD AUGUST is trending $23 to $25 dollars per barrel. This simple metric is an excellent indicator of potential refinery profits. Throwing the WTI / Brent differential adds on a few dollar per barrel.PBF took a few turnarounds a head of schedule, and postponed a few to get ready for some high run rates. The third quarters revenue numbers are going to be awesome. Where they direct this pile of cash will be imperative."
"rebought half my position that I sold at 11.06 on Friday today for 10.38, will look to add the second half here soon on any price weakness."
"Sold at $14. I am still long some PBF but with covered calls that I sold too early... so I have no more exposure. Yes, high gas prices indicate strong demand but until I see strong cash flows from PBF this quarter, it is not out of the hole and I will not buy back. $14 is a fair price - not to mention we were at $7.5 not too long ago..."
Could fall back to 9.00 before moving higher. I will be waiting there to try and make it 7 trading wins ;)
Easy investment at this price!
"26 billion revenue in 2021, gotta love that........ RIN issue will be resolved one way or another..... cash In da bag"

Back to $18 bucks this year. 3 bagger easy just hold.
One more thing. I respect all those who contribute to this forum. I suggest : let's not suspect and believe in ' conspiracy theories ' that someone is trying to prop up the stock to sell his own or vice versa. Please note that the readers of this forum are a small number of investors and there posts cannot result in any meaning full movement of the stocks. Respect begets respect . Wish we are all respectful to each other and ensure this forum of discussion a pleasant platform to exchange views. Thank you and best wishes to all readers.
Very nice evolution today
Double your money by years end with PBF￼
I think I hear the pitter patter of little short feet...
"I m all in, Gents! Bought 8.000 shares at 8.98. Now owning 20.000 shares, my average is 8.94. And 10.19 to recover my loss from Tencent :)))"

"2 transactions of 35.000 shares each after market. That’s strange, a lot of shares traded after closing."
A rising tide lifts all boats. Going back to $16
"as long as USA doesnt lockdown, pbf will be fine. 26billion revenue for 2021 easily."
It’s very strange the timing for doing this review by both Credit Suisse and Wells Fargo - with 2 days before earnings day. A more feasable Due Dilligence can be done if you have 2 quarters with Historical figures and then you do your forecast scenario much easier. Should they want us to step out from this company? :)))
nice move up today! holding strong
That was the world famous fake sell off walk down by the market makers this morning.
Ah someones holding it down....
"BF Energy Inc's (PBF.N) 190,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) refinery in Chalmette, Louisiana, has been shut down by a power outage caused by Ida. Parts of the Colonial Pipeline are down. All in, this is good news for all downstream users and producers. Prices for intermediate and finished products are going to be jacked for weeks. PBF having geographically dispersed assets is a huge upside. A rising tide lifts all boats."
Another fun day here.
this will be close to twenty by years end.
To the moon please...
"I have a feeling that today PBF will increase 5-8% :))) And tomorrow if the results are good (as it should be) the share should take at least 15%. What I would like to see:1) strong improvement Q2 Versus Q1 2) Good liquidity - to avoid any CF issues 3) strong forecast, with Management aim to have dividends in place starting with Q3-Q4 2022 If these are achieved, then this share will fly back to 18."
"from a purely basic intraday chart reading viewpoint , PBF really needs to trade above 9.80 with good confirming volume. this would be highly positive and complete the reversal week us longs have been hoping for. closing strong would be a most welcome happening ! the mid 10 area could be considered an appropriate objective."
"NEW YORK, Aug 20 (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is expected to recommend to the White House reducing federal biofuel blending mandates for 2021 to below 2020 levels in what would be a blow to the biofuels industry, two sources familiar with the matter said on Friday.The EPA also is expected to make a separate recommendation to boost the blending mandates for 2022 above the previous two years, according to the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.In the short term, the agency is looking to lower the amount of biofuels that refiners are required to blend into the U.S. fuel pool because the COVID-19 pandemic has sapped fuel demand. The move could be a risk for President Joe Biden's administration, as some could view it as favoring oil refiners over the lower-carbon biofuels industry even as the administration presses companies to reduce emissions.The EPA is expected to propose the 2021 and 2022 mandates at the same time, the two sources said. The proposals could change during a formal interagency review process.The EPA declined to comment on the matter.Under the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard, oil refiners must blend billions of gallons of biofuels into the fuel mix, or buy tradable credits, known as RINs, from those that do. Refiners can also apply for exemptions to the mandates if they can prove the obligations would do them financial harm.Mandates for 2021 have already been delayed by more than half a year because of the pandemic.RINs have slumped in the past two days on market speculation surrounding the mandates. Renewable fuel (D6) credits traded at $1.42 each on Friday, down from $1.50 in the previous session, traders said. Earlier this week, credits were trading above $1.60.Biofuel producers rely on the national blending mandate to get their products into the U.S. fuel market. Cutting the mandate would hurt their market share. The mandates are intended to reduce U.S. reliance on imported oil.Reporting by Stephanie Kelly and Jarrett Renshaw; editing by Jonathan Oatis, Will Dunham and Marguerita Choy"

This needs to be trading back at $16-$18 range its way undervalued! P/B ratio is 0.74 load up!
Daily VWAP profile today extremely bullish as one would expect……suggests stock can move even higher on the day of from here…stayed tuned …BB squeezing now on 1 min
"Fixing profit, 25%, dont think it will go more."
"It is kind of funny, I will likely buy more on the break out above 10.25 and others surely too and yet the market does not seem interested to bid it up $1 for a sure profit :p"
"1.5b in cash, 1.0b in capital? You must be kidding me!"
bollinger bands contract，we will know the direction soon if we see a big volume one day
I think it bottomed already. The shorts are trying their best and PBF is going back/up even with this pressure behind. 1000 more shares added at 9.22 - now hold 11k :)
"Most people bash it because of the debt issue, but few people focus on the RIN problem,check out the articles on seeking alpha and you will find out the authors probably don't know what RIN problem is."
All the refiners are down today trying to get people to sell keep them I wouldn’t sell oil keeps going up
Ok we took a breather. Let’s ease on up some more.

What are the hedge funds playing with the energy stocks??????
Back in long 7.33/4 on opening rotation ……more at 7.47…short duration trade
Any thoughts about today's S-3 form?
If we can maintain and hold above $10 we are primed to pop in the next month to at least $12
Oh John what were you thinking yesterday shorting to 8.82 and today to 9.03…. I know you want the price to reflect a green p/l but you must know by now that you only are digging yourself a deeper hole. Your short position keeps getting bigger your average sell price lower and the margin payments are slowly consuming your capital even as it stays in a trading range at depressed prices that only a tool would sell out at….
"Many people are seeking for stability in this unstable crypto space and A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now . I'd say it's outrightly wrong to just sit back hold and wait maybe incur some losses along the line , that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making proflts should be the way of life that being said , the market is still all about BTC at the moment and I'll advise current investors and newbies to take advantage of the Mr Steve program , an establishment that handles people who lack understanding on how maneuver the crypto space , to help them recover loss from the crash and also accumulate more positive returns , with their program i went from having 1.4btc to 9btc in just 9 weeks.All you'd need to do is send Steve a messagewhats<<<>>App + 1 ( 8 1 3 ) 6 8 3 ‑ 6 3 1 0 OR on Te** le* gram @ ( SteveFX01 )"
"You can feel PBF is getting ready to takeoff, with an additional 3 million short shares to provide the fuel..."
"PBF energy is a steal at current price of around $ 8 per share. PBF Market Cap at current per share price is is below $ 1 B , currently approx $ 960 . The company owns six oil refineries plus half of the PBFX . PBFX Market cap is approx $727 M . Half of 727 is approx 350 M . So in effect the entire PBF Energy is selling at about $ 610 M (960 minus 350 = 610 ). The company own six oil refineries worth around 6 B , plus infrastructures. I am aware of the fact the company has debt about 5.37 B debt and has cash 1.48 B , so net debt is about 3.89 B . I would say Mr Market ( who is suffering from manic depressive disorder ) is currently in a depressive state and is currently valuing the pbf at a fraction of its fair price."
That prior trading range with +/-9.50 at the upper end may be the price level we pull back to before moving higher if the technical people get all fancy and want to force their ideology on the stock.
"delta fear, we will see at least 10% drop today, target is $6."
Buying calls after this nice short
Paulsboro has people into see how much it cost to start back up
"Sam,Every time you respond to the paid FUD, the more money they get paid.Also I’m waiting fir a good entry point on Pbf. I agree crack spreads are much better and the company is turning to show EPS positive. Waiting for some good momentum to join the trade because on technicals which it looks like this is trading... I’m not sure where the possible support is."
Is it possible to have the dividend this year?
"John with his epic buy at the bottom, just to sell it for like what, 10% gain, reminds me of a guy I encountered many years ago on North American Palladium yahoo board when he bought it at $1.00 and sold it a quick profit at $1.15 feeling like a genius just to see it run to $14+Don't see our beloved John posting about getting in and riding it up day after day, and I know why he can't, because he sees stocks as a flipping game where you dont want to pay more than you sold something for, rather than making correct judgements on valuation vs price and acting accordingly, holding through the extreme lows and waiting for the market to return to favor, etc etc...Was a nice fake out to 7 and change but September is in a week and the smart money will be back from their holidays buying this and other stocks unless it runs a couple dollars a share until they get to act...."
PBF Energy is up 9.71% to 10.73
"Might have topped for now, that was a big move, pullback then build new base to move higher again"
"LOL, jerkoff analysts... always the contrarian indicators... they told you to sell at $10, they will tell you to buy at $18. If you followed their advice, you'd lost your shirt."
America’s Oil Demand Is Roaring Back Faster Than Expected https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-30/america-s-oil-demand-is-roaring-back-faster-than-expected
"All we need to do is hold and wait for John and his gang to have to go out and find even more shares in the market to cover his short ;) Time is not on your side Johnny boy, you can pay to paint the tape but you can't do anything to change the fundamentals of PBF and the market we are in."
There's so much leverage in PBF that even a mere 2% improvement in gross margins can send this stock to the high teens.
"So I guess it will be awhile to see $18 again, huh? I wonder what it was a couple months ago."
"A lot of shares are traded after-Market (mostly bought as the price goes up). I think the HFs are slowly buying the dip. But I will not sell my 20k shares for less than 300k, never! So many times cheated by HF, I have learnt my lesson :))"
"Bought 1500 shares at 7.41 today. Patience and logic are needed, not emotions. First everyone should stop worrying about the company. Pretty much every other small cap oil type stock has a similar chart. Down 50% plus since June. It isn't a company specific thing. These small cap oil stocks are near or even at their prices of 1 year ago. Oil was $38 a year ago so obviously the market has gone to extremes in regard to the dumping of these stocks they have done over the last couple of months. Oil is 63 plus so no logic really why these have come down this far like this.Headlines are not being truthful about demand. Look at the EIA inventory report that comes out every Wednesday. It has clearly been showing demand is fine. In fact for the previous week gasoline demand was 1%, yes 1% below 2019 levels. That is during a period of time when there have been 200,000 new daily COVID cases. All the headlines about demand destruction currently happening is just flat out untruthful. The numbers are the numbers and facts are facts.Hedge funds started shorting these when the Delta wave began a couple of months ago. They were expecting demand destruction but it didn't happen.COVID as can be clearly seen now goes in waves. This is wave 4 of it. The wave will end. There has been virtually no demand loss during this wave. When this current wave ends (probably within a month) the direction will change. After we get our run up here in coming months, I would look out for the next COVID wave which will probably start in December."
Bought another 1000 at 9.50…. Just feels like it is right to add and bet on it moving higher and accumulate if the shorts want to push it
Safe to buy - I told you jerkoff analysts called the bottom with their follow-the-herd downgrades. Shorts will start covering above $10 so plenty of potential for a short squeeze.
Comeonnnnn pbf
"What a random weird market lol....why is this being walked down all day, big boys missed the bus from their $7 PTs?"
Liking this pre-market today
"Closed PBFX short just now 11.16-18…..entered after very briefly lived earnings “pop” at 13.70……just a smidge over 18% winner in just a few weeks……expected distribution cut in partnership units mostly priced in IMO …….normally I’d close on day of (expected) announcement by why be greedy ? Stock, company, prospects and industry is a wreck……ESG movement and carbon stigma have removed many of the natural buyers for this industry……expect it to continue..have at it baggie longs"
Cracks above $27 today... Hope John is adding shorts again at the open so I can reload at 9.00
Has anyone else read the prospectus?
bought back all of my shares I sold on Friday for $11.08. back in with an extra 100 shares from that sale. 1600 shares at average cost of 10.35. let's go $18
Oil prices and shorts will finish with the refineries in BK
"in the last 10 minutes today about 800,000 shares traded. is this short covering or smart money accumulating stock ? almost 1% of shares in the float. it is odd that dk,cvr, mpc, and vlo were ALL up today and pbf the lone loser among refiners. pbf did close well of the morning lows. all small refiners desperately need just relief from their RIN obligations SOON ! and let's all hope the covid variant fades quickly as it appears to be already in england."
Unvaccinated republicans happy because oil is down
"Nice selloff into the close, likely will continue tomorrow. I will be waiting for it to drop to 11 and then decide whether to buy back some or not."
Shorts are only *beginning* to cover...
Where is that guy who told us a month ago about PBF bonds and how the bondtraders supposedly know better than anyone else and PBF's bonds are trading at distressed levels 30-50 cents on the dollar? Where are they trading now?

"The worldwide shortage of gasoline is expected. I cannot post the link because Yahoo deletes my comment whenever I do that. Also, the gas price in California is $4.5 gallon, and some area is over $5. The revenue for this quarter, especially from Martinez refinery, will be huge."
Shorts will be in again today.
"I hope you use this pop to sell some covered calls. There is no reason to push PBF any higher than $11 - $12 as there are so many other oil stocks that have been sold off in the last 3 months. If and only if they show strong cash flow ($150+ mm) this quarter, then there would be good reason to take the stock back to $13-$15."
"John and his team get called into a meeting with the head of trading at ABCDEFG Capital Mismanagement:HoT: Ok boys, we are short 300k shares of PBF, earnings are coming out in 2 days. What is the situation.John: We are short at an average of $9.HoT: $9????John: Yes Sir, we keep having to sell more to keep the P/L green whenever it goes above $9.HoT: And what is the plan? What will you do if post earnings the market keeps buying and is willing to pay any price above breakeven?John: *shouldershrug*HoT: That is not an ANSWER!!!!"

"Well John, that makes it 6 wins in a row on 1000 shares buy 9.00 sell 9.30..."
"Good liquidity (can mitigate CS issue about PBF liquidity in their report presented 2 days ago), better revenues (6,9 Versus 6 expected), smaller loss (1.26b Versus 1.42b) but not happy with forecast guidance. However, I still believe the current level should be above 11.50- 12 USD Per share"
Interesting that PBFX is selling at a 5.5 pe and paying a tax free distribution of over8.50 %
R2 quickly 8.15 hit …..working on pushing on through R3 is 8.76 a stretch for todayThe refiners as a group are hugely outperforming today…..go check in out on your heat maps ……finviz is easy on the eyes and no cost
We have moved past the golden 10% in a day rule and continued to go higher. This stock might keep booming today. The shorts might be trapped again which will cause the stock to boom back to $18.
Gasoline inventories down big.Diesel inventories down big.Crude oil inventories down big.Refinery utilization rate around 91%.That's from today's EIA report. GLTA tomorrow.
"Nice boost today, is it the Pfizer approval momentum, the collapsing RINs, or the market being so cheap it just eventually had to turn.... John?"
"Didn't jump as much as I expected, but oh well, we will see. I can't believe this stock was > $15 just a month ago, and with nothing changed, this is what we get, even after a good earning report."
RIN relief on horizon potential…market pricing in today lower feedstock costs/ higher margin potential industrywide per government proposed newly released rules it would seem ……hence the strong sector outperformance today…of course PBR one of the biggest beneficiaries…….and the ethanol producers take it in the shortsTBD on the final % allocation as inter agencies mud wrestle over this
The rumors of PBF's demise have been premature...
RINS issue is done. PBF to rise from the ashes like a phoenix. 12% gain in a day is just the start.
Too high for earnings
"Very good news, just read! “Bank of America is encouraging its vaccinated employees to return to the office after Labor Day in September, the company's CEO Brian Moynihan said in a Bloomberg Television interview Thursday.Bank of America isn't the only big bank focused on getting its employees back into the office. This week, Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman said it's time for the bank's New York employees to return to work in person now that more people are getting vaccinated for Covid-19.”"
