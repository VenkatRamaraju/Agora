Not sure how this will play out could be good to raise for capitol
Huge selloff right after the closing... can I say that it's a huge sign of manipulation? Or someone's the master of the mind control?
Double your money by years end with PBF￼
"Oil price falling faster than gasoline price, crack spreads therefore should be widening but traders in PBF in the pre-market think this is bad for the company, lol...."
Oil is down today
"Might have topped for now, that was a big move, pullback then build new base to move higher again"

"Still trying to understand how RIN can really impact the profit/performance of the company... with Crude Oil prices all time high and reserve decreasing, why is this stock down to almost-pandemic price? I thought the stock price reflects the performance of the business. PBF does have debt and deficits that dropped its price down to $5 at one point. But it's turning around, and its worth is definitely way more than its market capital value. PBF definitely did better in 2Q than 1Q, but its price is heading below the average 1Q. That just does not make sense to me. Unless there's a huge manipulation going on with this stock, please educate me."
"This is bad. No one is interested in PBF anymore. Its current price is so unfair, but the market price also reflects emotions. It's like back to the beginning of pandemic, although the oil economy is doing better than pre-pandemic."
"OH NO JOHN, they are buying, what will you do?"
16000 shares below 9.50 done!
IKnow people that work there and we are not flooded north jersey has flood issue's
"Opec output boost good for PBF. control price of crude oil whilst gasoline demands continue rising, very good for crack spreads and profits for refiners."
"Oil melting faster than refined product today, a nice circumstance leading to widening cracks. PBF trending lower with the rest of the energy sector due to oil. This is what is called an improvement in fundamentals. I hope John is adding more shorts, it is always nice to know there is an established buyer growing in size :)"
well....good luck ifyou are stillshort. better close them shorts fast !!
"Hey John I just bought 20 calls, I hope you are the one who sold them to me lol."
"Oil stocks actually behaving well - no big selloffs despite decline in oil prices, buying on the dip. This bodes well. Once oil gets its footing we may finally see a significant rally across the board. This is well overdue since after the last couple of months correction many oil stocks are flat or just slightly higher YTD despiteich higher oil prices and vastly improved crack spreads and capital expenditures."
"think we are at the bottom or very near, nice entry point"
Don't let them scare you into selling. This stock is manipulated by a couple of short hedge funds and their crony analysts. Nothing really has changed since it was at $16 just a month ago. Business is improving and the oil sector is recovering - that's the bottom line.
pbf in Paulsboro is turning on ccr to make hydrogen and starting chd1 for low sulfur diesel
"I am curious though, what made oil companies shoot so high a month and half ago? I think we have enough analytical assumptions on why we saw steep decline, so now I'm interested in the situation in June."
crack spread 321 now above 21.5. Jan to March its around 15 to 20. Looks like 2Q is gonna be a blowout Q.
"NEW YORK, Aug 20 (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is expected to recommend to the White House reducing federal biofuel blending mandates for 2021 to below 2020 levels in what would be a blow to the biofuels industry, two sources familiar with the matter said on Friday.The EPA also is expected to make a separate recommendation to boost the blending mandates for 2022 above the previous two years, according to the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.In the short term, the agency is looking to lower the amount of biofuels that refiners are required to blend into the U.S. fuel pool because the COVID-19 pandemic has sapped fuel demand. The move could be a risk for President Joe Biden's administration, as some could view it as favoring oil refiners over the lower-carbon biofuels industry even as the administration presses companies to reduce emissions.The EPA is expected to propose the 2021 and 2022 mandates at the same time, the two sources said. The proposals could change during a formal interagency review process.The EPA declined to comment on the matter.Under the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard, oil refiners must blend billions of gallons of biofuels into the fuel mix, or buy tradable credits, known as RINs, from those that do. Refiners can also apply for exemptions to the mandates if they can prove the obligations would do them financial harm.Mandates for 2021 have already been delayed by more than half a year because of the pandemic.RINs have slumped in the past two days on market speculation surrounding the mandates. Renewable fuel (D6) credits traded at $1.42 each on Friday, down from $1.50 in the previous session, traders said. Earlier this week, credits were trading above $1.60.Biofuel producers rely on the national blending mandate to get their products into the U.S. fuel market. Cutting the mandate would hurt their market share. The mandates are intended to reduce U.S. reliance on imported oil.Reporting by Stephanie Kelly and Jarrett Renshaw; editing by Jonathan Oatis, Will Dunham and Marguerita Choy"
Are we ever going to get out of this swamp?
"John and his team get called into a meeting with the head of trading at ABCDEFG Capital Mismanagement:HoT: Ok boys, we are short 300k shares of PBF, earnings are coming out in 2 days. What is the situation.John: We are short at an average of $9.HoT: $9????John: Yes Sir, we keep having to sell more to keep the P/L green whenever it goes above $9.HoT: And what is the plan? What will you do if post earnings the market keeps buying and is willing to pay any price above breakeven?John: *shouldershrug*HoT: That is not an ANSWER!!!!"
"All oil refiners are back to march/feb highs, mpc, hfc, ,Phillip 66, . Check and see, this is not unique to PBF, the cfo spoke about the rins during the last conference call, saying the business model is “unsustainable “ The Supreme Court , ruled in favour of independent refineries based in the USA, and PBF has began a renewable project to generate rins , in compliance with the exception clause. Relax , unless you swing trading or playing with derivatives, the price action should be inconsequential, relax and sell some puts/calls. Reduce your cost basis,"
A lot of put options to scare Retail investors. Carlos Slim I guess is drinking a good wine on his terrace with sea view. And he bet 200 m USD I think. Compared with our poor friend John who is drinking a 3 USD wine in his small room :)))
Why refineries are shorted by hedge funds????????
"It is kind of funny, I will likely buy more on the break out above 10.25 and others surely too and yet the market does not seem interested to bid it up $1 for a sure profit :p"
"Good liquidity (can mitigate CS issue about PBF liquidity in their report presented 2 days ago), better revenues (6,9 Versus 6 expected), smaller loss (1.26b Versus 1.42b) but not happy with forecast guidance. However, I still believe the current level should be above 11.50- 12 USD Per share"
CVI surprise earnings
"Gents, based on my below analysis (20 min ago), let’s build a small SWOT analysis to share it with Reddit guys and other sites. What do you think?"
"You better sell it down to 9 again John, that is where the market seems to like buying a lot :)"
No just from people that work there
"I was looking at cash flow from operations number: around $78 million for the quarter. Good but not great. However, given that the stock is down 40% already prior to earnings, this should be a buy."
Could fall back to 9.00 before moving higher. I will be waiting there to try and make it 7 trading wins ;)
What are the hedge funds playing with the energy stocks??????
Chevron and PBF Energy filed separate lawsuits this week in Contra Costa County Superior Court against the Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD) Source: https://www.kqed.org/news/11887837/chevron-pbf-sue-air-district-over-new-bay-area-refinery-pollution-rule - PBF — the second company — has argued that having to buy and install a device to meet the particulate matter reduction requirements would force it to shut down its Martinez refinery.
"PBF has debt of roughly $2.5B due this year and closer to 6 billion in total, with 2023 being the next and 2025 even bigger. Do they have the cash facilities to cover? The 2025 bonds are at 65 or so."
RINS issue is done. PBF to rise from the ashes like a phoenix. 12% gain in a day is just the start.
America’s Oil Demand Is Roaring Back Faster Than Expected https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-30/america-s-oil-demand-is-roaring-back-faster-than-expected
"crack 321 , is 23 ...... from 20 in june."
"PBF is producing asphalt/bitumen, that raw material to be used for roads/bridges construction. The infrastructure bill has 579 billion USD (at least) only for this part. So maybe that’s the reason why PBF is shorted the bill is coming soon :)) and the Big Boys would like a bigger pie :)"
"I like the long term prospects for this company. I started buying about 18 months ago and bought a lot of the dips. I feel the debt issue has some investors nervous. As the debt is reduced , I thought interest in the stock will increase. I'm staying long. Good investing to all."
when are they going to resume paying dividend?
The rumors of PBF's demise have been premature...
"Didn't jump as much as I expected, but oh well, we will see. I can't believe this stock was > $15 just a month ago, and with nothing changed, this is what we get, even after a good earning report."
"Nice boost today, is it the Pfizer approval momentum, the collapsing RINs, or the market being so cheap it just eventually had to turn.... John?"
"rebought half my position that I sold at 11.06 on Friday today for 10.38, will look to add the second half here soon on any price weakness."
"Is there no other oil company reporting their 2Q result? Will PBF be the very first one? If the oil business has been great for 2Q as we all expect, I'm sure a series of good news from other oil companies would bring all oil stocks higher and higher."
"Trend is currently to sell into the crowd rushing in at the open and then keep selling it down til the crowd bails, then pump it, i think PBF is a horrible trading instrument right now while it is being traded on ownership ratios between MMS and retail. It becomes to psychological and irrational to trade on fundamentals. I am thinking of just staying long and not checking in for a few weeks or months come and focus on trading in other stocks."
Probably bottom on a RIN Related writedown...
News this weekend ????????
"Bought 1600 shares at 15 and 1400 shares at 10.60. It doesn't make much sense why it fell so much. Crack spreads seem positive and the utilization rates seem to be high. The only problem is the RIN. But, it seems like it's a liability building up which is due 2023. By then, the plant in Louisiana should be up and running which should fix the RIN issue.I understand debt is an issue. But, isn't this the perfect play for the reopening? Am I missing something?"
Dumped 1/3 at 8.2754 just now …..in at 7.37 average cost …see earlier real time post from this morning’s opening rotation …today 12.2% profit in 3 hours ….still holding other 2/3 ….
"Gregory, we should let John rest in peace and focus on PBF :) because I think the bottom was reached and now we should stay calm until PBF hits 17-18 USD per share. Even I have a significant number of shares (20.000) I don’t want to sell cheap and lose a perfect opportunity for doing big money. Therefore let’s concentrate on our “target” and let John living in his “world” :))) I was so many times cheated by HF, that’s should be my answer to them - maximizing my profit on PBF"
Is pbf really going bankrupt?
crack321 jus busted through 21.
"refinery space trying to bottom……PSX, VLO, HFC all down 2-3% on lighter downward selling pressure today……not so on PBF ……very high volume/elevated downward pressure on 11% down day 3-4x versus rest of sector …….there’s some very heavy institutional distribution …..still a falling knife with no bottom in sight sliced through the 50 DMA like butter….and continues to trade there….all very bearish…check out the weekly…yikes…..longs = you picked the wrong refiner……market puked on Martinez news……btw doesn’t matter what you think …you don’t control price……"
"as I've predicted few days ago, this is going to 7 first, then 6."
I bought after hours. PBF has been on my watch list for a few weeks. I thought I missed yesterday's prices in the 9s but with the news after hours I got a second chance. The news after hours is tough but the requirement is 5 years from now not 1 year from now.
"They have a big percentage of California's gas market where are you going to get that . Paul Davis, President of PBF Energy's Western Region, stated, ""We have been working closely throughout the rule-making process with BAAQMD staff and anticipated today's outcome. Importantly, the rule-making requires refineries to meet a specific emissions standard by 2026, without requiring the installation of a wet gas scrubber or any other specific technology."""
Looks like it will drop down to 10-10.50 and then should bounce to $13. Not sure fundamentally what changed from 2 weeks ago for the 40% drop. Seems kind of weird. The renewable credits has been know for much longer then the last 2 weeks.
"I will become the best psychologist and then make millions on NYSE. Because this is all about! Not fundamentals, financials, ratios, Market, etc…. How strong you are when the share is going down (to keep your confidence at maximum level) or going up (to maximize your bet). I bet PBF will be my no 1 share and I m really confident about it."
One more thing. I respect all those who contribute to this forum. I suggest : let's not suspect and believe in ' conspiracy theories ' that someone is trying to prop up the stock to sell his own or vice versa. Please note that the readers of this forum are a small number of investors and there posts cannot result in any meaning full movement of the stocks. Respect begets respect . Wish we are all respectful to each other and ensure this forum of discussion a pleasant platform to exchange views. Thank you and best wishes to all readers.
PBF reduction in price is not fundamentally correct! Nothing has changed since the share was 18 USD. It’s just a manipulation to have more shares when infrastructure bill is in place and the 579 billion USD spending on roads/bridges start to fly. PBF is a bitumen/asphalt producer.
This needs to be trading back at $16-$18 range its way undervalued! P/B ratio is 0.74 load up!
"Not a good day for shorters! :) come on, PBF! Teach them a lesson :)))"
"John, invest all your funds and try to keep PBF down, it’s too high now!  I m not selling my shares even you give me 11.00 Per share now :))) so confident I am"
"BOON! Another win for daddy as $300 is transferred from John's depleting pockets to mine! I can do this all day, all week, all year long.... offer for 1000 again at 9.00"
Who is going to pay for the emissions that they will have to capture.We all will. They will install the equipment and you will have to pay for it at the pump or through taxes.
"A lot of shares are traded after-Market (mostly bought as the price goes up). I think the HFs are slowly buying the dip. But I will not sell my 20k shares for less than 300k, never! So many times cheated by HF, I have learnt my lesson :))"
"For oil stocks there is "" blood in streets "" and is the time to buy oil stocks . World will surely come out of COVID 19 , variants will come and go and soon the world will be used to it .

Baron Rothschild, an 18th-century British nobleman and member of the Rothschild banking family, is credited with saying that ""the time to buy is when there's blood in the streets."" He should know. ... The original quote is believed to be ""Buy when there's blood in the streets, even if the blood is your own."""
Strong open but looks like it was sold into. Will check in later to see which direction it is going today. My gut tells me it will go lower today looking at the chart but we shall see.

"This message is for our 45 years old friend who is living with his old mother:1) I lost 25k indeed on TME. Still not significant compared with the profit I made since March last year. But such lost was possible not because Tencent is not a good company, is because the Chinese Government interfered in their business. 2) I accepted my loss and sold TME with 10.78 (better than current level) and changed my strategy by moving on PBF, where bought 10.000 shares. Already 3.000 profit. 3) I have a beautiful family and a nice house. And very important: not living with my mother :))) like in your case.I still have only one issue: what’s your role here? Are you a small trader or just a story teller who gets paid for daily messages? How much? 100 USD every 2 days? Wish all the best to you and your old mother! Still bullish on PBF!!!!! And just waiting PBF to go to 8.25 to buy another 10.000 shares. :)))"
"This is for Michael: “Nimbley (PBF CEO) added that domestic gasoline demand is about 95% of normal, distillate demand has fully recovered and is about 5% above historical levels, with jet lagging at 75% of normal levels, as coronavirus-related international travel remains low as other countries have faced a bumpier vaccine rollout than the US.California is the bright spot for PBF in the near term as refinery margins there surpass other regions. PBF said it has seen a rise in gasoline demand on the US West Coast to about 97% of normal, and its two refineries are running at 85% of capacity, supporting stronger regions.""We're bullish on gasoline right now,"" Nimbley said, noting the sentiment is ""primarily about mobility and the state opening up on June 15.""California's diesel demand keeps rising, with the major port of Long Beach posting record cargo demand at 40-year highs, ""Which means there is diesel demand when you unload those containers and transfer across the whole country,"" Nimbley said.USWC cracking margins for benchmark Alaska North Slope are averaging $16.01/b so far in the second quarter, compared with the first quarter's average of $13.15/b.

"Bought another 1.000 shares at 9.22, now owning 12.000 shares. This up and down is to discourage us and say “would have been better to do some trading”. But it’s not, Hold is the most suitable solution."
"i follow MPC, VLO, CVI, DK, and PBF in the refining area. ALL 5 stocks this year made head and shoulders top patterns . and all subsequently have satisfied their respective minimum measurement. all 5 seem to go up and down in concert, even when viewed intraday. mpc is the weathervane closely followed by vlo. watch them and all 3 others will generally follow vlo and mpc up or down. interestingly, mpc was unchanged for the week while vlo was only down 1% and closed at 63.71well above its monday low of 60.76. dk bottomed monday at 15.36 and just closed down 6 cents cents for the week at 16.52.cvi had a monday low of 12.74 and closed at 13.15 vs a 7/16 close of 13.80which brings us around to PBF. ON WED our pbf was UP 7% + at 10.46 on the close and after the close a bomb was dropped in our lap. (it had bottomed monday at 9.07) monday's low held yesterday on 8 mil shares and was violated today, BUT the stock closed at 9.01 vs a low of 8.82 and volume of 4.9 mil, about half yesterdays. as previously mentioned elsewhere on here, this week's volume was around 32 million shares. had that ugly surprise not happened , i believe pbf would have acted in concert with the others and closed in the 10.60 range at least. i believe us longs are in good shape barring an absolutely abysmal q2report . good luck to all !"
Sold the 1000 shares I bought yesterday at 8.85 for 9.55 today. Now holding 1500 shares. Riding these shares for earnings. Something silly happens I will buy the 1000 shares back and then go back into accumulation mode. If all is well starting tomorrow will ride my 1500 shares to the 12-13 area when it gets there.
"I saw a clownmask at the store today, it was called ""Wanna look like John""? Look at him again at the bottom after selling it down trying to convince us it is going lower while it is at the bottom as if we were all trying to time the exact tops and bottoms rather than just buy a dollar for 50cts and let him worry about how to cover his shorts when we let him buy it back from us 75% higher. He is such a joke. An Askclown in his own words hahaha."
Shorted???????
That prior trading range with +/-9.50 at the upper end may be the price level we pull back to before moving higher if the technical people get all fancy and want to force their ideology on the stock.

some insider buying would be helpful at this point. Holding some 2028 bonds. The 2025 and 2028 are getting sold off. The 2025 is offering now at 58 with a staggering 25 yield to maturity. Might take a punt on those. You guys reckon PBF can hold on that long given the Martinez debacle?

"The 26 and 28 bonds are trading down, I would say almost 'going-concern' down. They are in the 50s. Going bankrupt bonds usually trade in the 40s and 30s. Bond holders are more savvy and more risk averse than equity buyers. In commodities right now you are seeing bonds trade low and stocks high and vice versa. Really strange."
"PBF, up,up,up!!! 8% today! John, are you there? What happened? You are so quiet today :))))"
Broke under $11. Picked up more shares. Risky with the RINs issue still unresolved. Should be trading higher particularly when aviation fuel demand increases.
Ah someones holding it down....
Oil prices and shorts will finish with the refineries in BK

nice move back up on a down day. can't wait for this to pop!
"It missed touching the 9.00 - 9.30 levels by a few cents most of the day 9.02-9.25 except for the opening minutes). It is like John is shorting in a narrower range to avoid taking another pounding by me in particular... Then again it didnt hit 9.00 again yet so even if it goes above 9.30 that wont trigger any profit taking by me unless of course it hits 9.00 first. Anyway tomorrow is another day, pretty sure I will get filled at 9.00 again and be able to make it 5 wins."

"AGRICULTURE | OIL 24 Aug 2021 | 16:39 UTCREFINERY MARGIN TRACKER: US margins take a hit as EPA mandate uncertainty roils RINs pricesDecoupling RINs a possibilityThere is a likelihood the 2021 EPA mandate will decouple the D6 ethanol RINs from the D4 biomass diesel RIN, having a greater impact on the D6 RINs, as refiners continue to recover from the drop in refined product demand wrought by the coronavirus pandemic, according to some analysts and refiners.""In 2020, the ethanol blending requirement into gasoline was a brutal 11.5%, yet the actual blend rate was only 10.5%, a level basically unchanged over the past five years. Thus, refiners had to use D4 RINs to cover D6 obligations, pulling D6 prices up near D4 levels,"" wrote Tudor Pickering Holt analyst Matthew Blair in a research note.Blair calculated that an EPA rollover in either volume or blending requirements from 2020 into 2021 will continue the shortage of D6 RINs. D6 RINs account for about 69% of total refinery RIN cost.""Thus, any efforts by the EPA to reduce the D6 blending mandate and decouple D6s from D4s could be very beneficial for refiners,"" he added.The price of D6 RINs, which averaged $1.5318/RIN for the week to Aug. 20, is down almost 10% from the week earlier, while the price of D4 RINS fell about 5% week on the week, to average $1.6978/RIN, Platts assessments showed."

"(New details throughout)By Laila KearneyNEW YORK, July 21 (Reuters) - Northern California regulators on Wednesday directed oil refiners in the region to slash the amount of fine particulate air pollution emitted by the facilities, which will require costly modifications at the plants.The Bay Area Air Quality Management District board's decision means refineries in the area, including Chevron Corp's Richmond plant and PBF Energy Inc's Martinez refinery, will have to install wet gas scrubbers to reduce pollution spewed by their gasoline-making fluid catalytic cracking units (FCCU).Refineries emit heavy amounts of pollution as crude oil is processed into fuel, and small particulate matter - consisting of solid or liquid airborne particles - is among the most harmful pollutants. Prolonged exposure is known to lead to respiratory, pulmonary and cognitive health problems.FCCUs, which turn heavier crude oil into lighter petroleum products including gasoline, are among the largest polluters of fine particulate matter in the San Francisco Bay-area.Under the amended rule, refineries with FCCUs must limit annual emissions of particulate matter to 0.01 grain per dry standard cubic foot within the next five years. Chevron and PBF, the refiners expected to be most affected by the rule change, urged regulators to consider a less stringent 0.02 limit. Valero Energy Corp's Benicia refinery already has a wet gas scrubber.Refiners and their advocates, including several refinery labor unions, said updating the FCCUs would cost hundreds of millions of dollars, lead to refinery layoffs and put pressure on the plants to shut down. Running the wet gas scrubbers would also require excessive water use in an already parched area, they argued.Health professionals, environmental groups and other proponents for the rule change said adding wet scrubbers would result in vastly in healthier air, particularly for children, poor residents and people of color disproportionately affected by refinery pollution, and could lead to more jobs as the updated units are installed.(Reporting by Laila Kearney Editing by Marguerita Choy)"
"and now we wait.... 8 days to 2Q. Crack321 above 20 in april may june , revenue easily north 5bn this Q. lets go."
"Let me throw this out for discussion. If you want a relief from the RINS, what do you do? My though is you paint a bad picture of the company and hope you get the relief. If you paint a good picture, you don’t need relief. So the question is, do you believe the picture of not getting relief will really be bad or is it overblown? Then we get to the EV cars taking over the world and the refinery is no more. I feel as long as the federal govern￼ment taxes each gallon of gas and has no replacement for those taxes, refinery’s will be around for a long time. Think about the taxes on cigarettes, the lives that are lost smoking cigarettes but they are still around because of the federal tax. Can EV cars be taxed on the electricity needed to maintain our roads? Just food for thought."
"Is it you John desperate to cover some into the close? I guess you noticed it is hard and costs a lot to push it down but when you need to cover there is little volume available ;) keep shorting, I will keep my shares out of your reach until you are begging for shares at 15+ ;)"
I expect consolidation between $10 and $12 before moving higher.
bollinger bands contract，we will know the direction soon if we see a big volume one day
"Gents, I think shorts will try to squeeze PBF today again. But pay attention: I have the feeling that value stocks will start increasing soon. Amazon lost more than 6% today while Chevron and Exxon started to increase. So don t even think to sell PBF today because it’s a high chance to lose it."
"Ups, 24.5k shares traded in one transaction! John, what have you done?  Pray CDC to say on Monday that Delta became Gamma and is 100 times contagious!  otherwise you are declared an official loser. Or fired because you didn t convince us to give up and sell. Can you Tell your boss that your aggressivity made me buying another 1000 shares? To be free from this Weekend "
RIN relief on horizon potential…market pricing in today lower feedstock costs/ higher margin potential industrywide per government proposed newly released rules it would seem ……hence the strong sector outperformance today…of course PBR one of the biggest beneficiaries…….and the ethanol producers take it in the shortsTBD on the final % allocation as inter agencies mud wrestle over this
"Since 7/13, the volumes have been doubled. At least people are getting interested in this stock. I really hope PBF rewards all shorts and longs with good 2Q report. Returning dividends would be great, but I doubt it."
It’s very strange the timing for doing this review by both Credit Suisse and Wells Fargo - with 2 days before earnings day. A more feasable Due Dilligence can be done if you have 2 quarters with Historical figures and then you do your forecast scenario much easier. Should they want us to step out from this company? :)))
I hope earning is good and better explanation about gas scrubber. waiting for $15 in August.
"659k global cases yesterday, out of which 84k in US. However the banks would like their personnel to come-back to the office beginning of September. This means they want to start everything whatever it takes?"
"Seriously who rides a stock down 50+% in just weeks?The PBF Energy Inc stock price fell by -3.53% on the last day (Friday, 23rd Jul 2021) from $9.34 to $9.01. and has now fallen 3 days in a row. During the day the stock fluctuated 6.57% from a day low at $8.82 to a day high of $9.40. The price has fallen in 8 of the last 10 days and is down by -32.56% for this period. Volume fell on the last day along with the stock, which is actually a good sign as volume should follow the stock. On the last day, the trading volume fell by -4 million shares and in total, 5 million shares were bought and sold for approximately $42.01 million.The stock lies in the lower of a very wide and falling trend in the short term, and this may normally pose a very good buying opportunity. If the lower trend floor at $8.99 is broken, it will firstly indicate a stronger fall rate. Given the current short-term trend, the stock is expected to fall -21.28% during the next 3 months and, with a 90% probability hold a price between $7.08 and $12.51 at the end of this 3-month period.Signals & ForecastThere are few to no technical positive signals at the moment. The PBF Energy Inc stock holds sell signals from both short and long-term moving averages giving a more negative forecast for the stock. Also, there is a general sell signal from the relation between the two signals where the long-term average is above the short-term average. On corrections up, there will be some resistance from the lines at $9.78 and $14.30. A break-up above any of these levels will issue buy signals. A sell signal was issued from a pivot top point on Wednesday, June 02, 2021, and so far it has fallen -50.98%. Further fall is indicated until a new bottom pivot has been found. Furthermore, there is currently a sell signal from the 3 months Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD). Volume fell together with the price during the last trading day and this reduces the overall risk as volume should follow the price movements.Support, Risk & Stop-lossThere is no support from accumulated volume below today's level and given the right condition the stock may perform very badly in the next couple of days.This stock may move very much during the day (volatility) and with a very large prediction interval from the Bollinger Band this stock is considered to be ""very high risk"". During the last day, the stock moved $0.58 between high and low, or 6.57%. For the last week, the stock has had a daily average volatility of 7.25%.PBF Energy Inc is oversold on RSI14 (15). Some stocks may fall long and hard while being oversold on RSI, but stocks that are heavily oversold on RSI often pose good re-bounce chance and played well it can be a buy candidate.Is PBF Energy Inc stock A Buy?PBF Energy Inc holds several negative signals and is within a very wide and falling trend, so we believe it will still perform weakly in the next couple of days or weeks. We therefore hold a negative evaluation of this stock.Current score: -5.930PBF is a strong sell candidate."
"Please god tell me, when is pbf going to hit 18 again?"
"opec deal done! great news and output for oil refiners shorts will cover this week into epic earnings , oil demand up huge ."
"The refinery sector getting the shaft on the infrastructure bill, senate votes tonight,Covid cases and ESG superiority arnt helping, give it a few months, PBF will be back"
"So according to Q1 earnings call, they said they would produce 25% above Q4 2020 which was reported at 689,600 bpd and was approx. a 70% utilization rate of their capacity. So that means they would be close to 90% utilization rate and be producing about 875,000 bpd, I really wonder how that does not translate into substantially higher cashflows and thus a higher valuation. The stock is worth $50 at a 10% discount rate using current and historical crack spreads of about $16-22, say average $19 a barrel with say $4 on RINs, and therefore only $15 to the refiner which is what below the 5 year crack spread average of $16.50 on a 3-2-1 basis without adjustment for RINs. At the current market price, the stock is implying a 50% discount rate on cashflows and only a 70% utilization rate... How much worse can it get for someone going in at these prices? There is a rational 400% upside on reasonable assumptions on the stock due to undervaluation, and the worst case that this goes to $0 cannot be supported by any logic since several refineries in the US shut down last year, and I am pretty sure those wont come back online for some time if the current crack spreads continue to rise.Someone is short this heavily and needs the rest of us to believe that we are wrong and that fundamentals don't matter or that math is some kind of made up hocus pocus like scientology... I will continue to throw in money at it every week as long as it is under $15. I am so grateful for this opportunity we are being presented by whoever it is that is causing this selloff."
"PBF energy is a steal at current price of around $ 8 per share. PBF Market Cap at current per share price is is below $ 1 B , currently approx $ 960 . The company owns six oil refineries plus half of the PBFX . PBFX Market cap is approx $727 M . Half of 727 is approx 350 M . So in effect the entire PBF Energy is selling at about $ 610 M (960 minus 350 = 610 ). The company own six oil refineries worth around 6 B , plus infrastructures. I am aware of the fact the company has debt about 5.37 B debt and has cash 1.48 B , so net debt is about 3.89 B . I would say Mr Market ( who is suffering from manic depressive disorder ) is currently in a depressive state and is currently valuing the pbf at a fraction of its fair price."
"What I expect from earnings: 1. Strong cash flow from operations. 2. Reaffirm return to GAAP profitability some time next year. 3. Use of free cash flow to buy back debt and improve balance sheet. The rest will just be cherry on the cake. If they don’t deliver, then I’ll consider taking losses. If they do, I’ll ride PBF to $20+."
"Bought a little more at $12.2. Average cost $13.8 - still a small position. This is a volatile stock so these price movements should be expected. I am not adding more until I see them showing strong cash flows this quarter. If they cannot be cash flow positive with oil in the 70's and flights back to normal, then I may change my mind and take a loss. So far, all I see is a somewhat normal pullback, just more than the rest of the sector since it's more volatile."
"Both Credit Suisse and Wells Fargo downgraded PBF to 9 and 10,5 respectively. From 17 and 15. We are missing something, Gents?"
I think it bottomed already. The shorts are trying their best and PBF is going back/up even with this pressure behind. 1000 more shares added at 9.22 - now hold 11k :)
What was the high volume at the end of the day about? Any ideas?
nice move up today! holding strong
"The bottom has been reached, Gents! On a very bad market, PBF is keeping its value above 9, that’s very good! Now it should start going up :)"
"IMO it is starting to break out and commence a step ascent, i.e. a descent from John's perspective... Lets see how it closes today and tomorrow."
"Had 500 shares, just bought another 1000 at 8.96. At 3:30 it was at 9.08 and was looking like it could close out with a hammer, but then whatever hedge fund that is messing with this then went to work to make sure that didn't happen. I will keep accumulating. This will head back to 13 in the short-medium term. Fundamentals are better now then when the stock was twice as much. Nothing has changed. Oil price overall is slightly higher then a couple months ago. Crack spead is slightly better. The BAAQMD has been something known that would happen and they have 5 years and were already planned out for it. RINS were known. That isn't new at all. Besides some of that cost does get passed to consumer."
poppit to 20
"John, I muted you so please don t bother to write anymore, I don t see what you’re writing :))) you’re too uneducated and small to lose my time with bugs/mosquitoes like you :))) Gents, I would recommend you to all do the same, you will see the difference"
Safe to buy - I told you jerkoff analysts called the bottom with their follow-the-herd downgrades. Shorts will start covering above $10 so plenty of potential for a short squeeze.
"PBF is highly manipulated but it will definitely go up, there is no discussion on this topic! Fundamentally we are exactly the same like we were when PBF was almost double: demand is significantly increasing, RINs were known and this will not affect PBF profitability as such increase in cost will be translated in the gasoline price, the air rule was known as well and has to be finalized in 5 years. The only change is how the articles are written and HFs behaviour. My opinion is that PBF went too fast from 8 to 18 USD per share and this drawn the attention of HFs and their current reaction. Why the big Banks/HFs in US made their biggest profit from the last 10-15 years? Because of this! Read Warren Buffet advises and you will understand the rationale behind - buy when it’s panic, be patient, etc…."

"Bonds are significantly better play. Huge yield at 22% right now & double your money for either the 2025 or 2028 bonds. If things go poorly, still have the bond protection & even if the stock crashes just need bond to get paid."
Cracks above $27 today... Hope John is adding shorts again at the open so I can reload at 9.00
"I have a feeling that today PBF will increase 5-8% :))) And tomorrow if the results are good (as it should be) the share should take at least 15%. What I would like to see:1) strong improvement Q2 Versus Q1 2) Good liquidity - to avoid any CF issues 3) strong forecast, with Management aim to have dividends in place starting with Q3-Q4 2022 If these are achieved, then this share will fly back to 18."
Down again time to buy
Is there any difference in this company two months ago when the stock price was at 18??
"CNBC Depumper, you are getting excited too early, the MMs are trading it in a range, it needs to break 10 to have a chance to start running... until then, just relax and take advantage of John being short, I already banked another $300 from his pocket selling 1000 shares at 9.30, already put in the money for a rinse repeat at 9.00..."
John I check all your recent post/reply. You always comment short AMC/CLOV/PBF but most of retail investors are bullish for the 3 stock. I guess you really are FUD now.
"Bought 1500 shares at 7.41 today. Patience and logic are needed, not emotions. First everyone should stop worrying about the company. Pretty much every other small cap oil type stock has a similar chart. Down 50% plus since June. It isn't a company specific thing. These small cap oil stocks are near or even at their prices of 1 year ago. Oil was $38 a year ago so obviously the market has gone to extremes in regard to the dumping of these stocks they have done over the last couple of months. Oil is 63 plus so no logic really why these have come down this far like this.Headlines are not being truthful about demand. Look at the EIA inventory report that comes out every Wednesday. It has clearly been showing demand is fine. In fact for the previous week gasoline demand was 1%, yes 1% below 2019 levels. That is during a period of time when there have been 200,000 new daily COVID cases. All the headlines about demand destruction currently happening is just flat out untruthful. The numbers are the numbers and facts are facts.Hedge funds started shorting these when the Delta wave began a couple of months ago. They were expecting demand destruction but it didn't happen.COVID as can be clearly seen now goes in waves. This is wave 4 of it. The wave will end. There has been virtually no demand loss during this wave. When this current wave ends (probably within a month) the direction will change. After we get our run up here in coming months, I would look out for the next COVID wave which will probably start in December."
"They're trying to tell you that this stock, which traded at $18 after last earnings report, is now worth half two months later on no news - even though business has anything but improved since then..."
"crack spread 321 was $9-14 a barrel of crude from jan to march. since april to June its been averaging $20 a barrel. PBF refineries can process about 900,000 bpd ..... thats $18million profit a day in crack spread. ie 2nd Q , crack spread profit will be around 1.7Billion usd. taking into account about 80% utilization, it still works out to about 1.4Billion usd profit in 2Q alone."
John is a short here right?
"Closed PBFX short just now 11.16-18…..entered after very briefly lived earnings “pop” at 13.70……just a smidge over 18% winner in just a few weeks……expected distribution cut in partnership units mostly priced in IMO …….normally I’d close on day of (expected) announcement by why be greedy ? Stock, company, prospects and industry is a wreck……ESG movement and carbon stigma have removed many of the natural buyers for this industry……expect it to continue..have at it baggie longs"
There's so much leverage in PBF that even a mere 2% improvement in gross margins can send this stock to the high teens.
"Bought another 3000 at 9,03"
"Remember when I said I never loose and I always get at least 20% profit and I will win, yup I won again."
"BF Energy Inc's (PBF.N) 190,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) refinery in Chalmette, Louisiana, has been shut down by a power outage caused by Ida. Parts of the Colonial Pipeline are down. All in, this is good news for all downstream users and producers. Prices for intermediate and finished products are going to be jacked for weeks. PBF having geographically dispersed assets is a huge upside. A rising tide lifts all boats."
bought back all of my shares I sold on Friday for $11.08. back in with an extra 100 shares from that sale. 1600 shares at average cost of 10.35. let's go $18
"More about the cash flows from operations: $78 million per quarter is obviously not enough. PBF needs at least $150 million per quarter in order to cover capital expenditures and interest payments. It sounds pretty lofty but it really isn't. First we have to assume that since spreads improved throughout the quarter, almost half of cash flows were generated in June. That puts them currently at $100 mil + per quarter. That is not enough either. However, with sales of $7 billion per quarter, a mere 1% improvement in gross margins puts PBF at $170 mil per quarter. Just to show there is plenty of leverage and room for margins/profits to grow and the general direction in the refining business is still pointing up with continued improvement throughout the rest of the year."
"120m shares out, 6.8bn in revenues, thin margins, high leverage... and the trend in the sector is up.Hinted Q3 to be similar production numbers as Q2, utilization above 90% for Q2. RINs bank running out towards end of year will likely lead to even higher product prices and push the inventory up more than the RINs liabilities, a solution will be found. They also repaid some $30m debt during the quarter which is not to be ignored. Cracks double what they were last year. There is no way to put a negative spin on this without being seen as a clown."

The Q2 earnings estimates are now down to -1.34. Does anyone have any idea what the analysts are thinking? The quarter has been over almost 3 weeks and the estimates are still going down. Nothing that's happening now can affect Q2.
When can it go back to 20? I think end of this year might be?
We have moved past the golden 10% in a day rule and continued to go higher. This stock might keep booming today. The shorts might be trapped again which will cause the stock to boom back to $18.

"Zacks' article for PBF says ""PBF may report negative earnings"" for its title, but then its actual content is basically a generic information, saying stock will go up if earning is good, and down if bad.

Lots of buying at 10 according to the message board… Some say it is going to 8 and yeah maybe but I have 200k set aside for such possibilities. Long term they will be repaying up to 35% of the 2028 notes before 2023 which will improve their balance sheet and free cash flow over the next few years. There is no way they can go bankrupt given their metrics and cash flow generating ability at the current projected crack spreads.

"So if this $500m number people are throwing out there for the wet scrubber is accurate and lets say they pay for it in 2022, that would take the fair value I calculated last weekend from $21.34 down to $17.91, so close to $9 as it traded the other day before this news was floated out there would have been half off... how anyone can think that selling today on the news is the right move is beyond me, but I think most people don't know how to value a company or just follow the narrative the story tellers are floating out there for them to base their mistakes on, that may explain at least part of it ;)"

"This doesn't make sense. RIN damage would be propagated to the consumer price, so the impact on profit, or even the overall value of the company, shouldn't be large.

"John the noob. I'm not the noob John you are. You know how many times guys like you have told me over the years I can't catch a falling knife, but guess what? I can. My Mother worked at Morgan Stanley for over 30 years, actually Solomon Smith Barney which got bought by Citi and then eventually MS. She taught me fundamentals.Charts I learned on my own. Learned chat patterns, candlesticks, reversal patterns, EW theory, Dow theory. Took awhile to figure out what are the real important indicators. There are tons that can be used but only a dozen or so really matter. Figured out what really works and I almost never lose. I have one loosing trade this year, SCO which I was using as a hedge as I had a lot of oil stocks earlier this year. That is the only stock of 59 I have traded this year I lost on, but as a hedge it was supposed to be. Last year I was 138 out of 140. 2019 66 out of 69. I don't try to hit homeruns. I take 10-20% in profit, sometimes get 30%, occasionally a little more.What really works is...I won't say. It is valuable. There is very limited info on the internet. There are a small percentage of people who try to do it but they lose because they do not use the correct indicators or they don't have the patience or guts or both. In 15 years watching CNBC I have seen 1 person talk about it for about 30 seconds 1 time. That is because it works, but by itself it doesn't. You have to get a sense for it. You have to know the right indicators to be watching. You have to be on an Island all to yourself. It takes guts. I catch falling knives because I know how to play the counter trends. It takes years and years to learn how to do this.Fundamentally you are off base as the stock is much weaker and a little lower than it was in February but the company is stronger. That is called a buying opportunity, not a selling opportunity. The recent negatives are actually not recent. The RINs are not something that just now started. The BAAQMD regulation has been expected for awhile. Your main talent seems to be insulting people. Good for you. You will reap what you sow. Do you really know what you are doing? I doubt it. I have seen this movie many many times. I will say just some of what I currently see. I'm not going to do an in depth explanation because you are arrogant and so you already know everything right? Therefore let me share just a little.I see the PPO at -13.55 which is lower than the NOV low of the stock. You know what the PPO is right? You know the MACD? Better have a look at that too. The ADX line (do you know what that represents?) is now higher in a down trend then it was again even back in NOV. It is nearing 35 in a downtrend. By far not the most extreme but usually to get more extreme then that something really really bad fundamentally would happen for a stock. Like not getting FDA approval for a drug company or airlines and hotels during a pandemic or oil crashes for oil companies etc etc. What is the huge terrible fundamental thing that has recently happened to PBF? Nothing so don't expect the downtrend to last and go into the most of extremes. The positive DI of the ADX is at 15. That is also near extreme. This is right after it was almost at 10 just 5 days ago which is very rarely seen. In NOV the positive DI of the ADX was 12. The negative DI sits at 43 which is higher than it was at the NOV low for the stock. Does this sound logical fundamentally? That these indicators are actually worse now than they were in Nov? By looking at this I am supposed to believe people like you are correct? PBF is a better company with oil in the 30s than oil in the 70s? No its a falsehood and the indicators don't scare me being the way they are. They tell me instead how flat out silly it is that they are where they are.Next let's visit the middle BB (aka the 20dma). Stock has not even touched the 20dma in over a month. I'm not talking about closing above it or even breaching it. Hasn't even touched it. That happened last April and March also but then again fundamentally that was logical. Also that ended and so will this. The 20dma is at 12.47. This is 38% above the stock price. That is extreme and frankly ridiculous. How about the RSI? I guess that is supposed to be low to mid 20s because you say so? It is supposed to stay oversold like that? Never change? It has been in the oversold condition longer then it did in Nov. Actually longer then any other time of the stock's existence. Except for MAR and APR last year. I can go on and on. I could write a book, maybe I will one day. Bottom line is that I will again make money. Only 2 things I don't like currently is the position of the middle BB and I would like to see a reversal candlestick. Which is why I haven't gone hog wild yet buying this. Your insults can't stop this, your lack of knowledge and arrogance won't either. I will win. This is beyond you, it is beyond me. I just understand it so I win."
"And one more thing I would like to add: have you wondered what will happen with the funds invested on the Chinese tech & educational market? Maybe you know that CCP is now punishing their own Companies (Didi, Edu, Tal, TME, Alibaba, etc) to show US that Democrats/Republicans threat to delist Chinese Companies from US is not scaring them. Part of those funds will be moved to companies like PBF mostly. Why? Because TAL lost 70% only yesterday, EDU 58% and so on, therefore the investors cannot bet on Amazon to recover their funds. Think about this as well!"
Couldn't help it - bought some more at 9.17. This is capitulation in oil stocks. Fundamentals both for oil and oil stocks remain strong so I see it as a buying opportunity.
"There was only one share sold which increased the price from 9.07 to 9.30 :)) I assume it’s another game to discourage us. But as long we keep our shares, the HFs cannot foolish us. So HOLD, Gents!"
"I am still long. I Don't think much changed - last quarter showed significant improvement and next quarter will probably show additional improvement. The question is whether they can get to the amount of cash flow required to cover interest payments and capital expenditures - by my estimates at least $150 mil per quarter. I told you before, PBF is a buy but a risky investment, therefore only a small position in it. If they go under it won't be because of Covid, crack spreads or oil prices but because of a reckless expansion financed with debt in an industry known for its booms and busts. The issue of California tightening regulations as well as RINs were well known before the acquisition of Martinez. The sad thing is that the people responsible for this debacle are still at the helm and will probably get golden parachutes."
"2 transactions of 35.000 shares each after market. That’s strange, a lot of shares traded after closing."
"sold today on the run up at $10.43, will look to re-buy in the low 10's and into the high 9's. this is great to trade or long term hold."
"25, here we come"
"PBF, I said between 5 and 8% increase today, make it 8%! "
Come to papa ……..closed 1/4 of full trading position just now at 8.78/9~29% winner in just weeks……thank you again baggie longs……now down to to 1/4 long position ……posted earlier today sold half full position earlier today $$$$$
"At the point when I saw declarations everywhere I thought they were bots or that they were made up till I was persuaded and gave it a try and genuinely I don't regret the move I made on the grounds that I invested my reserve funds, and now my first speculation with him acquired me benefits of more than $87,000 and its still running! Steve continues to convey and procure predictable benefits for me. He's awesome"
"Fear and uncertainty will probably rule today, longs too timid to bid it up until after earnings, shorts likely will have another day of it sub $12. The shorts may tickle out the weak longs for $10-11 but hubris will likely prevent them from taking it there."
@Daniel the guy who sold TME at the bottom^^
"Wouldn't that be something if after watching the market go up for 2 years and the oil sector be in the gutter, that the oil sector starts going up and the market goes into the gutter?"
"told you don't buy now, wait until it dips to $6."
"If you followed analyst recommendations on PBF, you would have bought at $25 in 2019, sold at $5 in 2020, bought again at $15 in 2021 and now would have sold at $10.If you did the opposite, you would have sold in 2019 at $25, bought back in 2020 at one fifth of the price, sold at $15 after tripling your money.So tell me, why do people still pay attention to jerkoff analysts other than view them as contrarian indicators?"
"from a purely basic intraday chart reading viewpoint , PBF really needs to trade above 9.80 with good confirming volume. this would be highly positive and complete the reversal week us longs have been hoping for. closing strong would be a most welcome happening ! the mid 10 area could be considered an appropriate objective."
PBF BACK TO $18 BY YEAR END.
I remember Jim Cramer talking about buying 1000 puts to scare people as a strategy back in the day… wish I remembered what stock he was talking about
"The technicals are clear, we are heading into a quickening period as the bollinger bands contract. Either a massive move up or down in the coming weeks. Fundamentally it should move higher on an NPV calculation but there is always a chance the shorts will go haywire and throw everything they have at it to get it to break down on the chart. I think within a week we will know which direction the market wants to take it at this juncture, possibly a break down to fake out the technical traders could be followed by the rebound to new highs but that is just a scenario to consider. I will hold what I have, keep trying to trade the 9.00-9.30 range with 1000 shares and buy the breakout above 10.50 or add on the way down."
Decided to buy some bonds at 50% face value and 14% yield. It seems the big selloff happened right after the interest payment so it was a calculated hold and sell.
"26 billion revenue in 2021, gotta love that........ RIN issue will be resolved one way or another..... cash In da bag"
R2 quickly 8.15 hit …..working on pushing on through R3 is 8.76 a stretch for todayThe refiners as a group are hugely outperforming today…..go check in out on your heat maps ……finviz is easy on the eyes and no cost
Gasoline inventories down big.Diesel inventories down big.Crude oil inventories down big.Refinery utilization rate around 91%.That's from today's EIA report. GLTA tomorrow.
Unvaccinated republicans happy because oil is down
"Very nice close. If oil holds above $70 next week, we may go to $11 - $12. Still I think this will be the top of the trading range until earnings."
I feel like the stock is having an overreaction to the downside today. PBF gaap earnings were 1 penny less than VLO gaap earnings. VlO is the best refiner in the sector. Also PBF issued $1 billion in bonds that pay a high 10% yield (which I would have loved to be a buyer of if I had access to the bond market). PBF has the option to buy these bonds back if they want in the future. When they are able to buy these bonds back it will take a significant amount of debt burden off the table. They are probably waiting for the coronavirus to be all clear before doing so.
"Most people bash it because of the debt issue, but few people focus on the RIN problem,check out the articles on seeking alpha and you will find out the authors probably don't know what RIN problem is."
There still trying to short this showing more sells than buys
"So what's at stake? Obviously, if PBF returns to normal, pre-covid profitability, even if it takes another year or two, you have the potential to triple your money from current levels ($9). However, this comes at a risk: PBF cannot keep borrowing money forever at ever increasing rates, just to refinance old debt and pay for capital expenditures. So even though it is not a distressed company yet, the risk is relatively high (not in the near future though). That's why I have a small position in PBF - don't be the farm on it. I personally think they will improve cash flows throughout the year and once flights are back to normal, will potentially be close to pre-covid margins. The difference with pre-covid is that they are now burdened with more debt than ever, which may take years to reduce to acceptable levels, so no dividend in the foreseeable future."
Oil is red today
I’m back because my PAA is down and I checked in to find this treasure under ten. What is going on? Lol
we hired 3 people from pbf in paulsboro and they said there calling people back and they will go back when they get called
last chance and day for shorts to cover.
Where r those two foamy permabulls Daniel & liddl sammie ? No where ….they stop posting outta sheer embarrassment……foolish sammie is down 60% in week on his core position …10% in a week on his trading position….no one who posts here has any financial or technical analysis skills …laughable noobs…..meanwhile my short on the sister pipeline / distribution company is up close to 20% …get some All the foamy pumpas r getting smoked by the fellas on Wall Street
5 month lows. PBF is now at the same price it was when oil was at $50.
"I am tempted to add here at 9.60 but if john’s shorts are not there anymore there might not be that guaranteed bid higher, tough choice…"
"John, are you there? I said today that PBF will increase 5-8%. Sorry for my mistake, it will be 9 or 10% :))))"
"in the last 9 days over 50 million shares have traded and the last short interest report showed around 12 million shorted. the stock has retreated over 50% as we are all painfully aware. volume today is the least in 2 weeks, which possibly suggests this stock is completely exhausted on the downside. my viewpoint is from a technical and psychological perspective. the thing i fear is possible unknown company problems of which most of us are still unaware. for you chartists, i see a head and shoulders bottom NOW (this last couple of weeks forming the final right shoulder. the left shoulder was early march last year, the head last november , and today completion of the right shoulder. this potential formation fulfillment would only happen if company operations continue to improve"
If we can maintain and hold above $10 we are primed to pop in the next month to at least $12
"12.36, I am going in hot and heavy for 5k shares, easy 50% upside on this lot post earnings."
Hi. This is good idea on long time. Target 30+. Maybe two-four years.
"The Shorts know their time is up, blowout 2Q coming !"
"All we need to do is hold and wait for John and his gang to have to go out and find even more shares in the market to cover his short ;) Time is not on your side Johnny boy, you can pay to paint the tape but you can't do anything to change the fundamentals of PBF and the market we are in."
"I think market is pricing in damage at the Chalmette Refinery. PBF’s Alliance Refinery is one hour away and has standing water.From markets perspective, no news is bad news when it comes to a status report for Chalmette refinery."
"@Daniel come back to TME, NFT available soon!!!"
Here’s someone who can read price action/ technicals….how prescient baggies ……and so lower it was …much lower ….another 10%+ leg down since my post below…..JohnJohn16 days ago$PBF conversationGet some baggies…….that’s an 8 handle baggies……post ER reaction is exactly what you longs deserve………down over 5% post ER move…….bearish bearish bearish……price action suggests may take another rung lower here over next few days…..
I’ve always done well with PBF.
UP we go u short beaches!!! Ahem JOHN
Really no resistance in the chart until the 12-13 area. I'm making a huge gain here. I'm happy for others that are too.
told you 7 is the bottom.
"Short term PBF is overbought (up 50% in a week), medium and long term it's still oversold. I sold some at $10.87 - just to be on the cautious side. Still holding on to most of my shares."
"got another 4000 shares at 8.90, thanks for thegift !!"
Bought another 5k shares at 8.88
"I hope the best for all of the investors on this board and I hope the best for PBF. I admire the company as they have been trying to build a great business in the midst of all of these setbacks for the Oil Industry. I worked at ExxonMobil's Torrance, Ca. refinery for 20 years and PBF bought that refinery. I left XOM before that in 2010 but I did some Contractor work at the refinery in 2017. I like the company and they have treated my friends who still work there well. GO PBF!! and I wish the best for all of my Oil Industry brothers who have suffered through the terrible events the Industry has been through. It seems that just as the Industry is beginning to recover, there are forces trying to bring it down again. Again, I hope all of the PBF investors on this board prosper!!"
Back in long 7.33/4 on opening rotation ……more at 7.47…short duration trade
Wells Fargo analyst Roger Read downgrades PBF Energy (NYSE:PBF) from Equal-Weight to Underweight and lowers the price target from $10.5 to $8.
PBF Energy is up 9.71% to 10.73
"delta fear, we will see at least 10% drop today, target is $6."
"Shorts will only start covering above $10 - so sit back and relax and don't even consider selling. The time to consider selling will be the time when herd-following jerkoff analysts upgrade, which I suspect will be in the mid teens."
"I still believe this stock is being heavily manipulated. The latest new air district rule applies to both PBF and Chevron, but Chevron's stock didn't move much. As a person that worked for a refinery before, these capital projects are not bad. Right, adding a new wet gas scrubber costs money with little to no impact to the production. But law is law, so you need to comply anyway. So, if Martinez refinery gets sold to another company again, they need to pay for the asset with the wet scrubber included. In other words, the new wet gas scrubber adds value to the asset.Also, these capital projects help local economy by making local engineering firm and contractors to keep working. We have 5 years to wait, and so many things can change until then.Some people believe Martinez purchase was a bad idea. Not really. Shell sold Martinez not because it was doing bad, but because they are trying to get out of refining business. Martinez does have harsh California rules and regulations to follow, but it also generated lots of margin simply because gas retail price is a lot higher in California. If you don't believe me, just look up how Shell did with Martinez refinery. When it was under Shell, it paid $300~400 million to Shell headquarter for their overhead and still operated profitably. This shows that Martinez refinery itself can generate huge profit for PBF, and PBF doesn't have as many overhead craps as Shell does. PBF can use the extra Martinez refinery profit more effectively and efficiently for its business. If you really want to believe Martinez refinery is a trash refinery, then I really can't say much because no matter what information I present, you'll believe what you want believe anyway."
"1.5b in cash, 1.0b in capital? You must be kidding me!"
"Go up, PBF, up! "
I’m liking that after hours.￼
"Guys who cares if it goes to 8 or 18 in the next few weeks, if you like it buy a small starter position and add on the way down, sell on rallies when you see green. John is the fish at the table, put yourself in his mindset and take advantage of his mistakes."
Bought another 1000 at 9.50…. Just feels like it is right to add and bet on it moving higher and accumulate if the shorts want to push it
"These are the same jerkoff analysts who were downgrading at $5 last year and telling everybody to sell, just to upgrade a few months later when the stock was triple the price. Now they are downgrading again after the stock lost half its value. What does it tell you about them? Always do the opposite of their recommendations and you'd have excellent returns by now."
Looks like the sell the news crowd are being joined by short seller who havent seen that the downtrend on the chart broke yesterday :) I shouldnt laugh at their ignorance but some times people with too much liquidity available to them do silly things and eventually blow up...
Liking this pre-market today
Paulsboro has people into see how much it cost to start back up
Bidens comments on OPEC didn't help this industry.
Comeonnnnn pbf
Closed out my day after hours at 7.61 made -4 cents share …….some institutional likely short covers into monthly opex buying into ah close …….may re enter tomorrow as max pain beginning today was 11…….should get some upwards pinning …you’ll have to look that up noobs
"NYSE it’s a real jungle! The HFs are inflating Robinhood share to make a huge profit, then exit and come-back on shares undervalued like PBF. It’s Incredible how they are doing huge profits based on some people being naive."
"Well John, that makes it 6 wins in a row on 1000 shares buy 9.00 sell 9.30..."
"Just holding, earnings call in 6 days. You will be fine. Buy the dip and hold."
How come yahoo didnt post goldman sacks price update for pbf they said its worth 14$ today.
"It needs a green day today to remain in the established uptrend. Not sure what will happen here, but I still believe in the near term it should make a higher high, be it in a few days or weeks..."
"in the last 10 minutes today about 800,000 shares traded. is this short covering or smart money accumulating stock ? almost 1% of shares in the float. it is odd that dk,cvr, mpc, and vlo were ALL up today and pbf the lone loser among refiners. pbf did close well of the morning lows. all small refiners desperately need just relief from their RIN obligations SOON ! and let's all hope the covid variant fades quickly as it appears to be already in england."
"Gents, has any of you account opened on Reddit? But on that specific channel. Those guys were betting 2-3 months ago on PBF. In 30 minutes the share increased from 8 to 13 :))). Maybe we can convince them again. In this way we can teach a lesson to John and his friends who are betting against PBF."
"I don’t think PBF needs $1.5 billion in cash for working capital, so once they feel more confident about future cash flows, they’d be wise to use some of it to buy back debt."
Shorts are only *beginning* to cover...
"I have 20.000 shares, my brother in law almost 13.000, my godson close to 8.000 and his brother 3.000 shares - big family . So in total we have aprox 44.000 shares. We are all long so John cannot buy these shares. Do the same and our share will go up like a rocket "
What will indicate that this was a huge manipulation? A sudden surge of purchases tomorrow or Thursday morning?
Here we are... new bear market for oil stocks... just because oil went from a 6 year high of $76 to a 3 year high of $73... bought some more at $13.06. Once oil stocks snap back it's going to be fierce. Extremely oversold/undervalued relative to any historical measure.
"Paul Davis, President of PBF Energy's Western Region, stated, ""We have been working closely throughout the rule-making process with BAAQMD staff and anticipated today's outcome. Importantly, the rule-making requires refineries to meet a specific emissions standard by 2026, without requiring the installation of a wet gas scrubber or any other specific technology.""Mr. Davis concluded, ""PBF has previously planned projects that will be implemented over the coming months that will allow our Martinez refinery to achieve emissions reductions significantly closer to the desired level in the first quarter of 2022. We will continue to work with the BAAQMD to arrive at our mutually desired goal of improving air quality and continuing to provide our vital products to one of the largest fuel markets in the world."""
And the rest of full short closed at 8.80……tight buy stop took me out …..~25% on last lot ……thanks for playing baggies…….extremely profitable short closed as R/R skew is neutral/slightly bullish into ER…..pivoted to new long at 8.80/8.83 …..smaller position as ER is virtually here
High. Manipulation here
I think I hear the pitter patter of little short feet...
Oh John what were you thinking yesterday shorting to 8.82 and today to 9.03…. I know you want the price to reflect a green p/l but you must know by now that you only are digging yourself a deeper hole. Your short position keeps getting bigger your average sell price lower and the margin payments are slowly consuming your capital even as it stays in a trading range at depressed prices that only a tool would sell out at….
"paying $4.2 per gallon of gas in Utah as I pass through. Only a matter of time before oil companies, up and down the chain reach record revenue. Of course the marketing will be blah blah blah."
"So I guess it will be awhile to see $18 again, huh? I wonder what it was a couple months ago."
The stock is ready to boom now that the market has digested it's great .38 GAAP earnings from last quarter. No one on wall street thought they were going to make money and they did. This stock is going to boom over the next few months.
"Environmental Protection Agency has proposed a retroactive reduction in biofuel mandates, effective 2020, in very welcome news to oil refiners who have been complaining of the costly mandates.Citing two unnamed sources familiar with the proposal, Reuters reports that the document was sent to the White House to be reviewed on Thursday, adding that it will likely deepen the rift between oil refiners and biofuels producers whose interests are at complete odds in the fuel blending department.""The proposal aims to get the (Renewable Fuel Standard) program back on track while addressing challenges stemming from decisions made under the prior administration,"" the EPA said in a statement as quoted by Reuters."
"So I noticed this 9.00 to 9.30 channel where a lot of volume is being traded so I put in 1000 shares at 9.00, got filled, put it in for 9.30. I will try repeating this trade since I know over time it will likely work and transfer $300 from John's pocket to my pocket. I will keep a tally and see how many times I can take him to the cleaners. :)"
it is possible some stops have been placed slightly below the low of monday and today. that could easily cause another small selling spree before the rally i believe will follow. good luck to all with hopes of some positive news thursday morning. i would not at all be amazed when a loss is reported AND the shorts begin to close out their positions.
Hey guys I found John. He was definitely in his mom's basement like we all thought.
