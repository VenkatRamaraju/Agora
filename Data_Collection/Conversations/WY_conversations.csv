"According to the WY website, today 8/12/2021, was the proposed dividend declaration date, but apparently it wasn't."
"Ben here,Craig, Axe Capital is no more... Dollar Bill and Mafee have resigned. Would it not have been better to use the $1 billion on debt reduction than ""private share"" buybacks?Remember, private share buy back implies fixed price, open market share buys results in true price discovery.Debt reduction would yield a higher share price that ""private share"" buy back. Better to reduce debt than reduce shares for a REIT.Your thoughts"
"Raymond James indicates I am getting the special dividend on Oct 19, $.50/sh"
Why big drop today??
"Mafee here,WY management abandoned the Federal Way campus for a Seattle corporate headquarters in order to attract ""higher quality"" employees. This move resulted in cost over-runs, traffic congestion, homeless people environment, city taxes to help the homeless people, riots, crowd anarchy, and an empty building as everyone is working from home.Meanwhile, the Federal Way campus waits in idyllic peace and serenity.The basic strength of the company is trees, barring management interference, will grow just fine on their own."
"A nice move by WY, restock repurchase and dividend. Bodes well for special dividend in Jan."
"Home Depot yesterday. Plywood finally coming down to $29 for 5/8"" from $80+ last month. 2x4 studs down to $3.60 from $10+. HOWEVER Fires are still raging in Canada and US. Did plywood glue shortage get resolved? Guess so."
Very Positive article in Yahoo Finance for WY:
a lot of lumber needed for those concrete forms in the new infrastructure bill.
"Nice article in Yahoo Finance about the housing boom in USA , vg for WY!"
Press Release said Company intends to return 75-80% of Distributable cash. Cash from operations minus Cap X and one time charges. Wonder what other 20-25% is for? Debt retirement??
"Dollar Bill here,Rather have the billion dollars as a distribution to all shareholders, not as special dollars to private share buybacks and management stock options.Are there any lawyers that will question the legality because WY is a REIT? As a REIT, are not the shareholders to receive 80%?Thoughts are appreciated."
"Dollar Bill here,Craig, you want information on the future ""special dividend"", but, as you correctly state, no information has been disclosed.IMHO, your ""special dividend"" will be inferior because the billion dollars spent on the ""private placement"" buybacks. Time will tell the truth.There needs to be full disclosure to the shareholders of this REIT. Any lawyers out there?Thoughts are appreciated."
"Nice that the stock is getting credit for potential carbon offsets. Oh, and lumber prices have started climbing again; not near their peak but well above average of the past decade."
CRUDE OIL HAS DROPPED $1.96 SINCE 7:12 AM MONDAY. I suspect the Thirty year interest rate could feel the effect of risk off early Tuesday in premarket. Thoughts. $TMV $4882.T $RIOT $MARA $ETCG $AR $AM $REML $WY $ALEX
I am a very tiny Timber owner of my own timber lots. Historically my family has owned timber land since the 1600's in various states. I have owned WY because they bought out my Plum Creek. I think Plum Creek managed their size company better. WY is super large as the combined the timber land of both companies.WY like just about ever other stock I own is tanking. One hardly needs to ask why. But just like my acreage of growing timber it will increase in value approximately 8% a year over time as the trees get bigger. On my own land I have no debt. WY has lots of debt they took on when the bought Plum Creek. Obviously I wish they had not. But debt service at these rates is not out of balance with the long term prospects for growth. If one is in the timber business one better have a long range business plan going out decades not years. In timber one only cuts enough to pay the current bills and when certain lots would suffer upon not being cut. Many types of trees do well if allowed to grow for over a hundred years to often there is no compelling reason to cut. Still reading the posts on this site one begins to understand most people here thought they bought a stock for dividends and reliable growth. In times like these that is not the timber business. For those of you that actually intended to buy into a timber business you have a good company and in a few decades you will make money and I mean great money. You will be rewarded. Most of you will sell to early however as you bought a stock and not trees.
Interim Div. and stock buyback announcements support upside to mid $40s.
