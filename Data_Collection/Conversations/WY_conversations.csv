I wonder what the value is of all this land WY holds. I don’t think the current value is reflected anywhere in the financial statements only the cost. There by the current value of the Company is worth a lot more than the balance sheet assets reflect.
"Getting to like this company more, and more."
Disappointing Q4 is going to weigh on WY for some time. Lumber futures over 500 today and WY down over 1%.
"Sold this dog owned plum creek before, lots of better div out there other than this"
Weyerhaeuser reached a 52 Week high at 35.59
How can WY not be showing a profit with lumber at these prices. Lumber is in short supply. The vast majority of WY land is in parts of the west not likely to burn.
With sale of Uruguay property- $400 mil more in til to reduce debt. With all the hurricane damage that needs re-constructed - it looks like a strong 3rd quarter report coming up!
Looking good today.
"Vanguard REIT is switching to a new index. As a result, it has to buy WY shares. VNQ, at a market cap of ~65B, is aiming for a 2.4% weighting in WY. That is ~1.6B. WY market cap is ~28B, so VNQ will buy up ~5.7% of the public float. Witha float of 746M shares, that corresponds to ~42M shares compared to an ave traded volume of ~3M. The switch became effective last week. That is why you will notice WY traded volume and stock price has surged the last few days. It will continue on like this for several weeks, depending how fast VNQ moves, so hold onto your shares!"
What kind of REIT abandons a corporate campus they own to pay rent in a high dollar building? The same kind of REIT that cuts investors dividends in half and refuses to give any back. Did management take a pay cut with the dividend cut? Heck no but they sure want us to fund their mistakes.
The WSJ had an interesting article recently about the value of carbon offset credits which mentioned WY’s sale of timberlands to Lyme LLC. Seems like a bit of extra value may exist in their timberlands.
So if it appears to be a tremendous amount of interest in put future contracts...does that mean we are heading substantially lower before this ship rights itself...never could time the market but seems we might see the teens before we start heading up again...thoughts anyone....
"I've kind of reached my limit on Yahoo Finance. This used to be the most relevant, user friendly and infomative site. I came here at least 5 times a day. Where is the Weyerhaeuser news? Why is the stock down 9% after hours.. Normally I could easily find related news to find out why? Now all I get is unrelated new on credit card offers????"

"lumber over $700, WY can't pay any dividends?"
#WY Stochastic oscillator and RSI are triggering bullish signal. http://www.foxchart.com/share/165142022.png
"Shorting WY with rising lumber prices is like sticking your hand down a running garbage disposal expecting it not to be a bloody mess. It will hurt, and it will hurt big time. If you like committing financial suicide then go ahead and do it, but don't come crying to me when all your money is gone. Lumber prices are going to continue to climb for the foreseeable future, and I certainly wouldn't want to be in the way of that moving train."
Profits up 100% in last 12 months but stock up 10% in last 12 months. What gives ?
Wood Wood Wood!! for a half dozen states to rebuild after hurricanes
wow...a pulse.
"Don’t they have to distribute almost all their free cash flow to qualify as a REIT. They still are a REIT, right?"
The trees are still growing and not going away. Housing demand should be stronger than ever as people move out of apartments and other congragate housing into single family homes. China will come back for the same reason. I do not care about the dividend as it just accrues to us a shareholders and now is not taxable. Note that lumber prices spiked as mills closed. Also inflation is in the wings and trees are a perfect hedge. Hang in there.
WY reached a 52 Week high at 30.59
I am a very tiny Timber owner of my own timber lots. Historically my family has owned timber land since the 1600's in various states. I have owned WY because they bought out my Plum Creek. I think Plum Creek managed their size company better. WY is super large as the combined the timber land of both companies.WY like just about ever other stock I own is tanking. One hardly needs to ask why. But just like my acreage of growing timber it will increase in value approximately 8% a year over time as the trees get bigger. On my own land I have no debt. WY has lots of debt they took on when the bought Plum Creek. Obviously I wish they had not. But debt service at these rates is not out of balance with the long term prospects for growth. If one is in the timber business one better have a long range business plan going out decades not years. In timber one only cuts enough to pay the current bills and when certain lots would suffer upon not being cut. Many types of trees do well if allowed to grow for over a hundred years to often there is no compelling reason to cut. Still reading the posts on this site one begins to understand most people here thought they bought a stock for dividends and reliable growth. In times like these that is not the timber business. For those of you that actually intended to buy into a timber business you have a good company and in a few decades you will make money and I mean great money. You will be rewarded. Most of you will sell to early however as you bought a stock and not trees.
"I have other stocks that are paying divvy-this stock dropped the dividend immediately. That is B$it! It never grows and now it doesn’t pay. When I get close to even $, I’m gonna sell this bad boy"
it looks to me like WY will have trouble paying their current dividend going forward. Their operating CF was about 1/3rd of what their dividend was. I again think this stock is going lower
LOl soon the Dems will demand free homes for illegals and this company will sky rocket .
"Now that the FED has once again lowered interest rates, dividend paying stocks should increase in value driving stock prices higher."
Bought more WY if it goes below $34.99 tomorrow friday
I've got to believe the mgt of WY is just sitting back and collecting their bonus checks. Lumber prices have risen 70% in the last 12 months but WY stock has done nothing. They even missed earnings in the last quarter. How ?? Its almost like the mgt is using WY as their own private retirement home.
"up over a dollar today,earnings for first quarter looked good. even though much bad weather. you need to read or listen to report. I had no idea what all this company was into."
Wy is cracking
WY reached a new 52 Week High at 37.30
"Question. 2x4's are nearing $7 up from $2.50 last year. Will supply increase? Prices drop back down?A $30k lumber package last year for a one story woody goodie residence is now over $70,000.That's some serious inflation. Not on the main stream news."
"Net earnings of $255 million, or $0.34 per diluted share-- Increased quarterly dividend by 6.3 percent to $0.34 per share-- Repurchased $290 million of common shares during the third quarter"
So what's with all the trading today. Twice the average volume with some trades over 200K.No real news of any problems with the company and not really loosing any value. I think it's still overpriced for an REIT as the dividend is a low percentage. Of course my percentage is still very high as a long time owner.A good BUY at $24.
"Missed badly, just don’t understand with all the positive things going on in this country that would help a company like this. So glad I moved on and sold at $37."
It's a long way from a tree on the stump to a 2x4 at Home Depot
Back to the $30's soon by the looks of things.
Lumber futures down 18% last 4 days ! shareholders get no share of gouging money
"The analysts are the experts/smart money? Morningstar lower TP $20.50, Argus lower TP $20, BMO lower TP $23, Raymond James downgrade from strong buy to market perform to NM from $25, etc. I always felt they are overrated and are nothing more herd/momentum traders"
"Hi everyone, I know the div has been cut on this one, but I've got a general question about return of capital and taxes/cost basis tracking. What do you do for tracking the changes to cost basis for REIT's, just hold onto multiple years of tax forms and subtract it all from your original cost basis following a sale of shares? Thanks."
"As others have stated, with lumber prices so high, WY should continue to head higher. Timber companies like WY are a store of value play in an inflationary environment and benefit from their leverage when lumber prices shoot higher."
Remind me again why anyone would buy a REIT that doesn’t pay a dividend?
Nice dividend...
"Lumber over $1,000 - CNBC Worldwide Exchange"
"IFP.TO Interfor earned $4.11 in Q1, trades at $36, and has net cash on balance sheet.LPX earned $3.01 in Q1, trades at $70 with debtWY earned $0.91 in Q1, trades at $39 with debt"
"WY's unnecessary negative comment concerning 3rd qtr lumber commodity pricing threw shade on a great 2nd qtr report. Stock price was knocked downward by that statement. Totally foolish, unless management intentionally wants to dampen expectations for a 3rd qtr surprise."
New 52 week and 5 year low
Maybe it's time for WY to convert from a REIT to a corporation.
"Said it once, say it again with Interfor moving up strongly today:WY and LPX trading at way higher multiples and valuations than Interfor, IFP.TOWY is trading at $34 on estimates of 80 cents next QIFP.TO trading at $27 on estimates of $3.39 next QNot an aberration, IFP.TO has been making these type of profits for the past two quarters, stuck in backwater Canada which has huge market inefficiencies."

"Interesting article, and comments, regarding expanded use of lumber.https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/01/business/timber-wood-construction-real-estate.html?action=click&module=Discovery&pgtype=Homepage#commentsContainer"
despite all of this drop in price its still a solid company that i am going to go long in
I think this stock has inverse relationship with interest rates
Depending on what one seeks as an investment a Timber REIT like this is perfect for the coming inflation I expect. Timber is crucial to infrastructure rebuild so there will be a great need for timber and other constrution products. And in this contraction Timber REITS have a big advantage. To other posts please remember that when timber is not selling at a premium one simple doesn't cut it. As others have noted timber values grow at 8% a year over the long haul. Trees keep growing and the slow growth adds worth to each timber lot. Also to the posts that suggest WY must pay out 80% of earnings --- timber REITS can easily make profits equal nearly zero while the worth of the company grows. Too many here invested in WY for an income...we need to flush those out. The remaining investors are going to be super happy going forward. I will buy WY through that period. The trees are not going anywhere and we always need timber.
RIP my calls. Earnings were almost as expected and we get a 5% drop?
set 52 week low. I think goes lower.
"If you like WY, check out WFSTF, a Canadian lumber producer at compellingly cheap valuations. Right now WY is 3x's sales while WFSTF is about .75x's, a massive discount to sector. Huge catch upside in stock to valuations of peers. Long wood stocks bc they have lagged lumber by a ton! Wood is good."
good news 266 million sale making earnings on their timber
ARE DIVIDENDS Qualified?
Great quarter and reinstatement of dividend and down another 5%? What a market!!
"Have been watching WY for quite some time, am still on the sidelines, but am considering a small purchase."
"Ok it’s time to get real. lumber is down 30%, are you kidding me in 2014 lumber didn’t even reach $500 and WY was $80 a share. Since Then #1 bought #2 WY and Plum Creek. Do you think maybe WY could be any luckier or smarter. Folks it’s still $1 a board ft. and each of those Douglas firs produces 14000 board ft. And by the way they own 11,000,000 acres. What better hedge could you have to inflation than land? I don’t even think they are making land any more. I’m buying Wy every day because I believe the July 29 earnings will bring them south of a 10 p/e this year. How many 10 p/es can you find. Please if I missing something POST IT, I haven’t seen a bargain like this since I bought F at $8 last summer."
Z they suspended dividend! That’s one of the big reasons to own this stock! Going to breakout alright! Just not upwards!
Dividend safe?
"Well, that was short lived."

Losing millions with forest fires in CA and ORE....sell those in the danger zone....sell everything in CA....
Watch BCC. WY soon to follow upward big time. Rolling back into the builders!!!! Want a huge buy? Get some BXC as well!!
"Sold WY because it suspended the dividend. There a lot of good REIT's out there that did not suspend their dividends, and now I own some of them."
"Lumber prices staging a strong recovery. WY not so much, even with an uptick in housing and interest rates dropping. That Plumcreek deal done stuck WY good with a pile of southern timber whose price has gone nowhere for years now and years to come."
The reason I sold WY is because the greedy CEO & BOD suspended the the dividend. I wonder if they took a pay cut also?
Moving up after the market slump in Nov. and Dec. and have committer as much liquid cash into WY.
WY has become a lumber trust. That and a retirement home for its management team.
"This seems to be falling quite precipitously. I know market is correcting, but I fear the dividend isn’t coming back and the sellers already know it."
This looks like a perfect target for an activist investor. If management was better Buffett would be all over it. Just a question of time before smart money wrestles this away from these guys.
"I’ll bet that as it stands now, 75% of the shareholders in this stock held by old money don’t even know the dividend has been suspended. As they slowly find out, their financial advisers will move that money to an income fund or such.Watch for the slow decline as this news gets out there...."

"Weyerhaeuser expects to see their EPS rocket for 2021 to record levels! To put it into perspective, 2020 was a record $1.29 per share, while 2021 expects $3.69 per share!

Press Release said Company intends to return 75-80% of Distributable cash. Cash from operations minus Cap X and one time charges. Wonder what other 20-25% is for? Debt retirement??
Big beat on housing starts. 1.55 million.
Z...Please explain to me in details why I should buy BXC? It has no profit and no dividends...Appears to be all risk and rewards...Is some great unknown in the pipeline that going to turn the industry on its head?
Up 3.20 Mistake?! According to nasdaq
"Sustainable harvesting means they are replacing cut trees. They are only cutting 8-15% of inventory. When land sold or leased for carbon credits goes higher, the economics may favor even further reduced harvesting."
Good price to start accumulating

"As a former PLUM holder, I expected a lot better out of this stock....half-decent div is the only saving grace."
"Took a half position last week! Guess I’ll wait for the other half, but lumber is forever!!! And no one ever talks about WY?!"
Cut senior management salaries and eliminate Board stipends until dividend is restored. Share the pain!!!
Seems WY positioned to take advantage of anti plastic millennial mood.
land is on books at cost not current value. given that most land was puchased decades ago. book value understates considerably.
"Question for the ""longs"" on this MB...With the good size drop in Weyerhaeuser's stock price recently, and the $6+ billion of net debt, is the great dividend in jeopardy? Thx for any input."
Lumber prices up and near 5 year highs. This should lead to increased margins and profits.
wey going down tomorrow
Apparently consolidating before next leg up
That $2.00 2x4 is now $4.50 at Home Depot. I had to do a double take!. going up faster than Beer prices. GLTAbtw WY should be $40+
Earnings don't concern me. Lumber prices still have a long way to go before topping out. Bears are in shark infested waters as long as that's the case.
"Being an REIT, why are they not required to pay a dividend if they have earnings? Clearly lumber prices have rebounded well above before covid so why are they dragging their feet to return to paying a div?"
"Value!, dividend,Value"
Lumber futures are moving up...
Where is this after earnings? +$40
I see this stock price is down 20% since May 1st; if falls another 20% = $22.71 share price.
"Conifex CFF.TO Trading at 1/3rd of 2018 prices, and below book value. About 3 x 2021 EPS.The market in Canada is very inefficient, and few analysts follow this name. The ones that do give them conservative 65% upside TP. Cheapest lumber stock going, very little debt."
Lumber prices shot up by over 100 during the past 3 months and there is no stopping.KB Home stated a very strong demand for Housjng and new home construction with rise in prices.And all other builders too stating the same. Lower interest rate is helping the builders and the pandemic makes people to move to individual homes.All in all it is looking good a higher dividend will be the best outcome. Let us see what Jan 29th Brings.Stock should move to 35/36 range fromHere.Gl!

"I'm starting to think of this messageboard as ""The Bitter Builders' Club""."
Looking at this Board and reading lasst weeks upgrade by Zack #1 Rank stock pooor shorts are stuck with Steveie and running to cover.. Any further shorting will completely burn them with growing demand of Lumber and Economy opening with full cylinder. IMO this is best buy opportunity fetch you 20% to 30% upside imo.I am Long and will keep on adding here. shorts are racing without their heads .
"When do we get the Special Dividend, and any idea how much it’s likely to be?"
WY and LPX are my favorite forest products stocks right now...rising lumber and OSB prices benefit both these companies tremendously. The rising raw materials costs of houses benefit both companies tremendously.
Will they need to report the increase in value of the timber on the income statement whenever they report earnings?
Why are analysts estimates for Revenue and EPS so low for 2022?? Lumber so expensive right now...
Any speculations on the recent share price decline?
Collected my dividend this morning. Thanks WY.
"If this is a REIT, why isn’t dividend higher?"
a lot of lumber needed for those concrete forms in the new infrastructure bill.
Lumber still sky high at Home depot. That $2.50 2x4x 8ft you bought in Jan.2020 is up to almost $6 out the door in Dec. 2020. WY going much higher IMHO.
Weyerhaeuser reached a 52 Week high at 32.39
Bought this for the dividend. I am not going to panic. Been in this situation before.
I never reinvest my dividends. I let them stack up and buy when I am ready. Has worked very well for me over the years.
WY feeling bullish from here!
Anyone on this board an Ex- Wy employee who received the info on the Pension buyout offer. Anyone know how these work ?is it a good idea to take the $$$ and put it somewhere else. Thanks.
Bounced back just like I said it would. Own this stock for income and it has rewarded me with a 21% return as well. Should've bought more on the earnings dip.
Is the price of lumber up from last year.
"Dow up 600, industrials up big, and WY up a nickel? Does not make any sense. Holding through next year. May add along the way. 4000 long."
"How can you go wrong growing trees? Not sure what insurance costs would be , but properly managed, this seems like a winner to me."
"Looking forward to a dividend increase!""our financial position is exceptionally strong, and with year-to-date Adjusted Funds Available for Distribution of almost $1.9 billion, we are excited for the opportunity to return significant cash to shareholders through the variable supplemental component of our new dividend framework.""$1.9B divided 750M shares = $2.50 per"
Solid investment. Bad trade.
"Tax selling? Mutual and Hedge Funds forced to sell because fund holders are redeeming their shares? Whatever the reasons, WY is getting “hammered.” That was a lumber joke."
"Big news! Report that Russia plans to ban log exports. Yahoo for some reason not letting me post link. But you can easily find it by search Russia + Log export ban. The story can also be found on woodbusiness.ca. Clearly, if the ban take effect it should have an impact of increased demand for U.S. logs."
Will people quit buying houses after this stock market decline?Housing and the Stock Market?
"Post-conversion high and no one here? But, I bet if it was way down the board ""wood"" be busy.."
Last week’s fall was due to Options expiry. The stock will move up since the market is upbeat on their earnings and the Dividend outlook.Lookjng for recent highs $36Gl!Oil revenues also should move up. Gl!
"I bought in today, with the upcoming inflation this will be a good hold!"
All I hear on the news is how expensive lumber is..3X as much as last year. Will this plkay out in bigger profits for WY ??
If the dividend does not come back in August announcement or if it gets to $26.00 before then I'm out.
yahoo stats indicates 12M shares sold short
"Slow down is due to increased credit scores for new mortgages. When the credit worthy run out, then an accelerating slow down. Few houses for sale = sellers and buyers are nervous and prices too high for new and existing homes for buyers. Also, limited supply of available empty lots for sale near cities and towns. Looks like downhill for lumber producers. Shareholders won't get higher dividends anyway. Not good."
Back in 2007 when WY was $79 lumber was MUCH lower. Act Accordingly.
"Does anyone have an informed take on how much damage the fires have done to their inventory? the last thing I saw was in this PR :Weyerhaeuser manages approximately 1.6 million acres of forests in Oregon and 1.3 million acres of forests in Washington. The company operates three mills in Oregon and two mills in Washington, one building materials distribution center in each state, and several nurseries, orchards and offices across both states.As previously disclosed, several of the fires have reached the company's timberlands, but it is too soon to assess the affected acreage or potential business impact. The company will evaluate conditions on the ground when it is safe to do so and will provide more information as appropriate. All Weyerhaeuser employees are currently safe and accounted for, and the company will continue to assist state and federal agencies with fire-suppression efforts."
had this for a year down quite a bit. thought with all the disaster s lumber would go up? I think they own a lot of trees so money in the bank as long as they don't cut dividend
Saw Plywood at $80 a sheet at Home Depot yesterday. Now there is a plywood glue shortage.
"WY shareholders, I was wondering about all this Tariff talk, and is it hurting the biggest U.S. timber company more than our neighbor to the North? The 52-week chart looks just as bad for ""big"" West Fraser Timber Co., and the timber co. with the best balance sheet in the business, Canfor Corp. Canfor Corp. offers No dividend to shareholders. West Fraser pays a small dividend to its shareholders. WY pays a nice big dividend currently. If your looking at P/E and PEG Ratios, then yes, the Canadian timber companies are cheaper if value is all one looks at. I don't know why all timber companies performed so poorly in the last year? The U.S. just experienced a housing boom in several states, AZ, NV, TX and FL too! I'm at a loss to explain why the poor pps performance, Tariffs? for all the timber companies. Organic growth just got a lot slower, I'm afraid."
I think WY tests 52 week low by year end
"1/2"" plywood is $87 a sheet today at Home Depot out the door with tax and lumber fee."
Picked up at 17 and 18. Happy so far. Looks like 30s are coming. Dividend coming back will be good.
What happened today to bring WY down? Curious -- can't find anything on line
Glad I bought when I did!
"$70 stock trading in the $30's. Folks , $20 sheets of plywood last year are now $35. $2.50 2x4 in 2020 is now $7 with tax and ""CA Lumber fee"". bing, bing, bing, bong,bong,bong."
"Anyone knowledgeable about this stock and why it is down 22% today? I mean, it's timber."
So the 34 cent dividend is in line with prior dividend.
anyone have any idea what is going on here. WY is in free fall after a dividend increase.
"The management of WY has a nice little retirement home going for themselves. Run the company at pretty much ""break even"" and pay themselves salaries and bonus and stock options. Nice work if you can get it."
"So now mgt is only reinstating half our dividend, look in detail where these people came from and how long theyve been here. Then look at how much each of them makes managing a timber reit. Where's our dividend?"
"Dividend suspended, did the CEO and BOD take a pay cut, I'll bet no."
"According to the WY website, today 8/12/2021, was the proposed dividend declaration date, but apparently it wasn't."
"1973 prices here, with exception of the market crash last month. Hard to ignore, but would definitely be a long term hold if bought"
"The lumber stocks no one knows about are in Canada. IFP.TO Interfor is debt free, piling up cash, buying back shares, and trading about 2 x Earnings, reports tomorrowCFF.TO Conifex is almost debt free, buying back shares, has renewable biofuel kicker with a 20 year contract to supply green electricity, and is trading less than half its 2018 high, about 2.5 x earnings and at book value."
"How is this a REIT if it sells lumber and produces wood products? Oh well - not important. It pays a wonderful dividend. This stock is fairly safe, price fluctuations not withstanding. We will always need wood."
Anyone think the divvy is coming back on tomorrow call?
Thanks for the payday WY.
up 20% YTD ... nice little recovery. still concerned a little about global recession and overall stock mkt sell-off in next few months. time to reduce position ?
What good is the 0.34 dividend that was paid today when the stock dropped 0.45? WY shareholders just lost money.
"@marthers -Thats great news! I loaded the other day at 26.06. The last time I bought this name it was around 25, then rode it to 30 and sold. Likely do the same thing this time around while receiving the nice divygtla"

Listened to the earnings call today. The leadership team composed of a lawyer and an auditor was very unimpressive. There doesn't seem to be any vision of how to move the company forward and find significant areas where the company can add value. These leaders sound like trustees of an enterprise where their job is to do as little as possible believing that this will preserve the businesses they are overseeing. I expect the company to stagnate or deteriorate until real businesspeople are put into the leadership.
think this will drop at div payout 3-21?
"So, these are the guys costing me so much to build my new home: https://youtu.be/Gz0DUmv8Pzo"
"I'm still waiting for the other half of my dividend. What kind of guy pulls an agreed upon deal citing hardship, then when he is made full by the Govt. and price hikes, refuses to go back to the original deal? Thats what we call a ""welsh"" at the card table."
Formerly owned Plum Creek also owned this dog for a short time certainly glad that's over !
WY holding up pretty well today. Most REIT'S down 3%.
Been a frustrating hold for the last 1.5 Year’s. Would have thought this one would have moved nicely with all the rebuild that has and still going on across the country ??
Man this chat room is lively! Lol. Here's to the leg up to 50
What is going on here!!! I am losing my kishkas on all my dividend paying stocks including wy!!!
"It just noticed Lumber appreciation is following Bitcoin. >>>>>> 1/2"" sheets of plywood are now $60 up from $20 last year. 300% gain similar to Bitcoin. We are living in an alternate universe."
Are you kidding me...the most valuable timbaland in the world at $28 a share...!
"$70 stock trading at $35. Lumber top commodity in 2020-2021. The $35,000 lumber package for a regular 3 bed room SFR is now $70,000++++ Massive inflation ahead boys. Act accordingly."
Too soon...
"is there anybody else watching WY with feedback other than Z who is always talking about what he ""heard"""
5 years ago WY was at 29.8 now 25.12. So actually lost $1.17 per year. Dividends offset the loss but still looks like if you invested in this stock you gained nothing over time. Question now is will WY perform better in the next 5 years. Housing starts are falling and their appears to be oversupply of timber in the south. So I guess I question this companies business model.
Lumber futures keep breaking to new highs...front month now at $535. I am starting to think WY may have made a big mistake by not moving more aggressively on their sawmill capacity. Just passively waiting around for southern log prices to finally kick up seems like a lack of strategic initiative.
Yield up to 6%. So either over sold or dividend will be cut in future
big day tomorrow! hoping for the best...
Seems like the latent potential is starting to be appreciated a bit more. Lots of asset value. Good inflation play so long as FR keeps rates below a market level.
I wonder if home buyers might move to lock in low interest rates now the Fed is hinting at rises by 2023. Does that boost construction in the short term?
"Framing lumber up 150% YTD. WY stock up 10% YTD. 2021 will be an ""adjustment"" in WY stock price."
WY stock price trend looks ominous to me. What is causing the significant downtrend?
Why the sharp decline in wy share price today?
I said it in October and it's truer now: If I didn't already have too much of this stuff I'd be buying all I could at these levels.
"expensive, well managed, generous on dividend"
http://investor.weyerhaeuser.com/2020-07-30-Weyerhaeuser-reports-second-quarter-results No mention of reinstate dividends
Buy AFTER the X date..........It will take a dive of a multiple of the div
"Imo. Part of the stagnate stock price stems from the fact that the fire season is getting longer and fires bigger and no let up in sight. This surely impacts the values of the land, making it less viable for buyers.Ive owned this company for years and years simply because I'm a builder and emotionally attached to wood."
will it break its low set last December?Does China have anything to do with this?
Down about 42% from 52 week high. Not looking to good.
"Manke sawmill in Tacoma, WA full of unsold inventory. Dark days ahead for lumber. Existing homes sell, new construction on its ASSets. Glad to seel sawmills crashing. Lumb. futures dropped from $1,730 down to $1,284, that's down 26%. Next winter expect $680/M futures and saw mills closing as the economy goes into recession."
So..........it's down 4 X the div.........Probably a good time to buy some.
"An amateur here, need an assist from one of you pros. If a REIT cuts a dividend then they are compelled by law to issue an equivalent amount of stock as necessary to meet the 90% rule. Am I correct? This of course means that if the stock is issued, can be sold on the open market, manufacturing a dividend and waiting for better days. Is my analysis faulty here?"

WY REPORTS 2ND QUARTER EARNINGS LOSS......GLAD I SOLD SHARES AT THE TOP
"Where is the other half of our dividend? Time for an activist investor to shake up these Plum Creek squatters. This ain't a retirement home, It's my retirement account."
[I just watched the same video.] I checked the financials of WY and was happy to see the numbers. About 20 years ago I was receiving about 8% dividend from Plum Creek Timber now WY. Just before the merger I bought WY and increased in March of 2020 when the market was low.I would like to see the dividend return. As a REIT the company owes us at least a good dividend.This was a reply to a previous person's post. I thought it may be of some use to the entire conversation today. If their is some indication of an increased dividend I will possibly double up again.
Lumber futures are booming WY is way under priced. It is going to show in the next earnings report. I see $40 a share in the next few months. priced https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/lumber
Was planning on buying 3000 shares before they announced the suspension of the dividend....any thoughts on why they did not provide guidance on bringing it back and at what percent....
"Jamie Diamon said he hoped that China US negotiations could mostly be worked out within next 90 days. Seriously, it would take me 90 seconds.No TariffsNo DumpingNo IP stealingSign Here__________"
"Apparently some here do not grasp the timber business. Within a large window trees can be allowed to grow and then harvested when lumber prices are up. WY management has done a great job by ""NOT"" harvesting as timber prices are down.Incidentally the reasons housing is down are varied. However one should realize that there was an artificial incentive to own multiple homes in the past. Now that one can't write off the extra taxes on their homes and have other people pay for this excess the rich are selling off their 4th and 5th investment homes. New homes bought for investments are not being built. This overhead of homes must be cleared from the housing market for normality to return. I have no idea how long this will take. While I applaud the new tax laws I also admit it hurts me personally. But I should not expect to have other people underwrite my tax bill. This new law is fair even if I have to sacrifice."
Maybe WY should announce a decision to grow maryj instead of timber on part of those southern land tracts.
"Per wall Street journal. Now, after Beijing placed retaliatory tariffs of up to 25% on imports of lumber and other U.S. wood products, exports of hardwood lumber to China have fallen 40% this year."

Commodities turning upward! Prices going up! Big components of this stock! Going higher here!! Biz is increasing!
Was there any mention of next dividend date on the conf call?
Wheres the other half the dividend mgt. took away on 03/2020? Did any management take a pay cut or cut back any form of spending on their side? Nope but they sure want to spend our dividend money for their outrageous salaries.
"NINE million a year to our c e o, not one penny to us owners."
Anyone have thoughts to speculate on how long the divvy is not dist? I'm considering selling at $23 to free up some capital to invest elsewhere. I'm no day trader. Dead money makes me crazy
"Got a small position, 250 shares at 29.32 plus broker commission, maybe i should have waited f tomorrow. If this drop turns into a rout, I will buy more but not too much.Years ago, i bought Plum creek for 6 and sold for 9, I thought I was clever, then it cut it s dividend in half and went to more than 30."
Got out today at $26.10 profit was more than the dividend we should have gotten in June. Have my eye on another good paying dividend stock as soon as this sale clears.
"Ding,Ding, Ding. 2x4's x 8ft at Home Depot are $6+ ( $2.50 last year) . The $35,000 lumber package for a typ. SFR is over $70,000+++. WY should be making $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$!!!!!!!!! Stock is too cheap!"
Ex-Dividend date coming up....Time to get in!
Why was my post on waiting 2-3 quarters for WY to go up deleted?
sure wish i had not been reinvesting div in the mid-30s....oh well
"land is on books at purchase price, some of it purchased 100yrs ago, love owning land, timber is icing on cake. or you can buy bitcoin....lol"
Im not sure what happened to this company but their #s sure are bad lately. I never would have bought a stock with a div 3X earnings. Then they sell off land in MT. Every time I look it gets worse too. So much for buy and hold.
Will storm damage this season have a positive impact on WY?
"WY did an IR presentation for Raymond James a few days. 40 minutes. Available online. Not a hard hitting presentation or questions, but a nice case for investors. I would imagine that most holders are a bit frustrated, but does seem like lots of latent potential. Actually kind of remarkable what you get in terms of assets as a shareholder for the price that you pay for a share of stock (especially vs QQQ highflyers)."
"WY has become a retirement home for the management team. Large salaries and bonuses for mediocre management performance. Until the management team is replaced, this stock is going to sit like a turd."
Are we getting a divy anytime soon? Sucks having record lumber prices and no divy.
And here we are again... WY testing resistnce at ~37 established way back in Jan 2015.
"Bought in at 35 thinking the fires in CA and floods in Midwest would bring on a lot of rebuilding...now thinking of adding on this dip for the dividend %. Decisions, decisions...."
Very suspicious trading today on a normally stable traders' stock. 10 cent price drops on 1000 share transactions? Volume is indicative of price manipulation today. I'm turning off the ticker today. I'll collect my dividend when the share price goes above $35.
"Mafee here,WY management abandoned the Federal Way campus for a Seattle corporate headquarters in order to attract ""higher quality"" employees. This move resulted in cost over-runs, traffic congestion, homeless people environment, city taxes to help the homeless people, riots, crowd anarchy, and an empty building as everyone is working from home.Meanwhile, the Federal Way campus waits in idyllic peace and serenity.The basic strength of the company is trees, barring management interference, will grow just fine on their own."
"1. What needs to happen for this to become a super cycle?2. For those also in lumber, which sector has longer legs?$NMM $DAC $GSL $ZIM $SB $WY $LPX $WFG $CFPZF"
Hurray a new 52 week low. WY has been a major disappoiintment since the PLUM buyout.

Has anyone else noticed that this stock is trading at same level as November 2008 ? Its literally been dead money for 10 years. My compliments to the management of this company. Job well done. If your job was to provide a comfortable retirement for current management.
"WY and all timber investors should educate themselves and be following the future of the Cross-laminated timber (CLT) building boom in large buildings and skyscrapers. Cross-laminated timber (CLT) is cheaper, safer and more ecological than concrete and steel for large buildings. This sector of building over the next 35 years is predicted to double. Prices/value of standing timber holdings will benefit significantly. If you are not following Cross-laminated timber (CLT) you should."

"Home Depot yesterday. Plywood finally coming down to $29 for 5/8"" from $80+ last month. 2x4 studs down to $3.60 from $10+. HOWEVER Fires are still raging in Canada and US. Did plywood glue shortage get resolved? Guess so."
"As the dividend got suspended this quarter, I'm buying, they have a lot of cash and good future projects that will make weyerhaeuser one of the best 5 dividend stocks ever. I'm super excited... waiting 5 years to see results"
There is going to be a lot of rebuilding in CA after the biggest fire in states history. Wouldn't this benefit WY?
Went out today and bought some lumber for a project. I can't believe the price and yet WY is down. I guess the middleman is making the money.
"Weyerhauser suspends their dividend. Most people buy REITs for their dividend. Short-term there will be pain. Long-term I have no idea. Isn't it nice to read someone say they just don't know, instead of giving their bull$%*& opinion?"
"Bought 10 Acres of timber land next purchase portable saw mill. Weyerhaeuser stock going nowhere, so I need to make Money somehow."

"I guess Friday's gap down tells us what the analysts & market thought about that May 1st 2020 WY Conference Call. I'm in this REIT like most for the dividend, and now like so many big caps the dividend will be cut. I read something in the notes from the conf. call about cutting ""cap ex"" by $90 million for 2020. I'm going to watch for any insider buying during this COVID-19 induced beatdown. Let's see what WY Mgt. does here."

"Let's see where WY closes today? Entry time is near. However, these Bear markets are tough to time."
Wonder when they will reinstate their dividend.Wood prices have went higher since COVID.
Soaring lumber prices adding $36K to the cost of a new home. Commodities are going to be the culprit of the next correction...Cheers!
What in the world is going on???
What is a better capital allocation from here: arable land REIT or Weyerhauser?

WY will retrace back towards 30 imo! Patience
How much is left in the tank here? Thoughts on whether it will climb to and through earnings?
If it gets up to $26 a share I will be gone.
Feels like this could be the wash out day for this stock.
"Conifex CFF.TO is giving those who haven't gotten in a chance with a pullback from $2.50. Lumber producer was $7 at 2018 highs, trades discount to book value and management is buying back shares with cash Tsunami coming in. Earnings out May 14, you want in before then."
