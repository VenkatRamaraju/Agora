"ONE DIGITAL NOKIA PROGRAM. BLOG BY CTO NISHANT BATRA: As a leader in 5G, private wireless and analytics solutions, Nokia is powering the global digital transformation of communication service providers and enterprises. But how is Nokia transforming itself into a best-in-class digital enterprise? As Nokia shifts to the “Accelerate” phase of our transformation, we are increasing the digitalization of our own operations with an ambitious, company-wide and multi-year strategic global initiative we call “One Nokia Digital.”The overall goal of One Nokia Digital is to increase the company's performance and competitiveness through the digitalization of operations. It covers:1) Internal operations to reduce risk and cost to operate, increase efficiency and productivity, and develop business agility.2)Customer Experience and Services for more competitive offerings and deployment services, increased efficiency in account management, and improved customer satisfaction.3) R&D to develop productivity, reduce development cycle time, improve quality, and be more competitive in network management.To imbue a digital transformation mindset and accelerate our digital journey, we recently hired Alan Triggs as our Chief Digital Officer. Alan brings deep expertise and experience in digitalization and IT transformation at scale, as well as a deep understanding of the telco and enterprise world. https://www.nokia.com/blog/accelerating-nokias-digital-journey"
Mute all NYSE and others stating they know all... and make your world a better place!
Over 5 billion shares. That is the problem. Look at GE after their Reverse Split. Doing very well. I hope Nokia sees the light sooner than later.
Another stellar day.

"Nokia and City of Melbourne trial AI technology to keep city streets safe and cleanPress ReleaseNokia and City of Melbourne trial AI technology to keep city streets safe and cleanAI-powered solution supports city’s objectives of piloting emerging technology to improve municipality efficiency and create great city experiencesTrial uses Nokia Scene Analytics to optimize laneway servicing and understand waste disposal behavioural trends in a busy Melbourne lanewayExisting network of cameras used to monitor activities around a waste compactor, while Nokia technology collates multiple data sources and delivers real-time alerts and reports12 August 2021Sydney, Australia – Nokia and the City of Melbourne have conducted a trial using Nokia Scene Analytics artificial intelligence (AI) technology to develop a deeper understanding of waste disposal behaviour. This will allow the city to tackle the issue of waste dumping more efficiently and keep laneways – the busy and narrow city streets and pedestrian areas – even more clean, safe and free of garbage.To decrease the frequency of waste contractor visits to busy areas, the City of Melbourne has offered local residents and businesses subscription-based access to the large-capacity compactor facilities. With the compactor in place, Council then wanted to understand how the service was being utilised and how to mitigate illegal waste dumping, which can quickly create safety and hygiene issues in the area.Under its ‘emerging technology testbed’ initiative, the City of Melbourne worked with Nokia to leverage an existing network of installed cameras as internet of things (IoT) sensors to monitor one of the compactors. The Nokia Scene Analytics solution employed an AI-powered algorithm to filter and collate data from the cameras, while also combining other data sources, such as operational data on the compactor itself, to create real-time alerts and produce reports. Initial trial results demonstrate that Scene Analytics can support the City’s objectives for better, safer citizen experiences while simultaneously lowering maintenance and down time costs for waste management services.This innovative use of Scene Analytics has been recognized on a national stage as the partnership between Nokia and the City of Melbourne was shortlisted for the Communications Alliance’s ACOMMS awards in the Artificial Intelligence category.Lord Mayor Sally Capp, City of Melbourne, said: “This is a great example of using new technology to help remove illegal waste more quickly, make our city cleaner and protect the environment. Our partnership with Nokia is another way we are gathering data to make Melbourne a safer, smarter and more sustainable city. This innovative project will help to avoid hazards and make our streets even cleaner by allowing our waste services to better understand behavior trends related to the illegal and dangerous dumping of waste.” Rob Mccabe, Head of Enterprise of Australia and New Zealand, Nokia, said: “The City of Melbourne is using robust AI technology to offer its citizens, visitors and businesses a greener and more liveable community. In helping the City of Melbourne monitor and enhance services with real-time driven actions, Nokia Scene Analytics is supporting the safety, security and operational continuity of this city in a proactive and automated way.”Trial details:The trial allowed for real-time monitoring and detection of activity in the vicinity of the compactor using a virtual tripwire. Object detection and object counting was used to identify and count items to show how the compactor was impacted by items incorrectly placed within it, while also identifying potentially dangerous items. Anomaly detection identified unusual movements, such as illegal waste dumping during the night, while face and license plate blurring maintained individual privacy during the trial.Using these reports, City of Melbourne can better understand the correlation between illegal waste-dumping activities and compactor downtime, to keep maintenance teams better informed and minimize issues. It also allows them to swiftly address waste dumping activities before they become a hazard, viewing locations in real-time to observe any obstructions to service vehicle access, and adapting their schedule to reduce unnecessary visits and minimize their carbon footprint. By understanding patterns of compactor usage and waste dumping activities, the city of Melbourne is also able to patrol the area more effectively, while developing an ongoing campaign to better inform and educate the community.Nokia has deployed mission-critical networks to over 1,500 leading enterprise customers in the transport, energy, large enterprise, manufacturing, webscale and public sector segments around the globe. Leading enterprises across industries are leveraging decades of Nokia experience building some of the biggest and most advanced IP, optical, and wireless networks on the planet."
"NOKIA CHOSEN TO MODERNIZE UNION WIRELESS’ RADIO ACCESS NETWORK. Nokia today announced it has been selected by Union Wireless to swap out its existing RAN equipment with Nokia’s AirScale 4G/5G radio portfolio to modernize its network while supporting the Secure and Trusted Telecommunications Act. Union Wireless will deploy 4G service initially with a built-in path to 5G for its subscribers. In addition to supplying radios, Nokia is providing all deployment and integration services including ground and tower work, installation, commissioning, and RF design and cluster optimization. https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2021/08/25/nokia-chosen-to-modernize-union-wireless-radio-access-network/"
NOKIA GETTING MORE PROFITABLE IN THREE WAYS: 1) More competitive product lines (most recently in Mobile Networks) thanks to increased R&D investments; 2) More cost-efficient through lay-offs and (in Mobile Networks) a higher proportion of SoC chips where the full YoY effect will be felt only in 2023; 3) A growing addressable market this year with 4% growth in the relevant market (excluding China) for Network Infrastructure and 6% for Mobile Networks. This last point is especially encouraging because it is so much easier to turn a growing company around than to do it with a stagnating or declining market.No wonder Nokia has risen more than 50% this year and that analyst recommendations have risen radically since the strong q1 and q2 ERs and the upped earnings guidance. Now let's have even more institutional buyers (patient smart money) snap up Nokia shares!
"It's hard to put politics aside when the China virus had killed so many around the world.. if China had nothing to hide they would let complete inspections from Anyone to prove otherwise. It's proven they steal intellectual materials through spying from their telecommunications companies. THESE ARE ALL FACTS. China threatens its neighbors. I truly believe most countries will ban their 5G as we have seen. Because Nokia has turned the corner, new management, that knows what they are doing going fiward with a PLAN , we will DOMINATE telecommunications .This plus ALL the licensing agreements with the auto manufacturers and phone companies + all the rest will bring g in additional BILLIONS of dollars.Nokia is a BUY........I'M Heavely invested. Good luck , LONGS."
MUTE the sales people on message board trying to sell you Trading Platforms. This is a Message Board not a car dealership !
"@Abu reason many companies prefer shares buy back instead of dividend is because of tax implications. no tax on shares buy back and generally lower tax rate for capital gains as opposed to dividend, generally counted as taxable income. regardless, Nokia should not pay dividend or shares repurchase at this point as management contends return on its operations is greater than its capital cost."
so under valued and under loved...really needs Helsinki Social Services to check on this battered stock for abuse. Boolean
vote for NO DIVIDENDS. let Nokia be a $60 growth stock.
"I've been very quit lately, because NYSE is angry at me and won't buy me the dinner that he promised me, so I bought another 4500 shares today at 5.82.I will be watching to buy more of this greatly undervalued beauty.

"Nokia Stock Is Riding the 5G Wave. Why the Rally Could ContinueThere aren?t many European stocks as hot as Nokia ? this yearThe U.S.-listed shares (ticker: NOK) of the Finnish telecom-equipment maker have surged 60% this year to a recent $6.28. The story is simple enough?telecom operators around the world are upgrading their equipment to support faster 5G technology. Nokia is one of a handful of companies to make that equipment, and a key rival, Huawei, is blocked from the U.S. and a number of other Western countries over national-security concerns.The more complicated story is that Nokia is recovering from a period of underperformance. Earnings per share more or less held constant between 2014 and 2020, and it didn?t pay any dividend in 2019 or 2020. Nokia said it made a product design mistake when it started making microchips for its 5G products, and Verizon Communications ? (VZ) opted for Samsung ? instead of Nokia on a critical 5G contract.Nokia said in its second-quarter earnings call that customers have returned. In the U.S., Verizon is still a key customer, and it has signed five-year deals with T-Mobile ? (TMUS) and A&T ? (T). But competition is fierce?Swedish rival Ericsson ? (ERIC) won a slice of a joint 5G contract from China Telecom ? (0728.Hong Kong) and China Unicom ? (0762.Hong Kong) that Nokia tried to land.N okia also says it?s benefiting from the work-at-home trend. ?We do believe that there is some kind of structural underlying changes in the market, especially in home [broadband] connectivity,? CEO Pekka Lundmark told analysts, according to a transcript from S&P Global Market Intelligence.But Lundmark also added that by the second half of 2021, Nokia will face tougher comparisons in mobile network developments. ?So don?t just automatically assume that these percentages will continue. But structurally, [it?s a] good market going forward,? he said.Like other meme stocks, Nokia has been a favorite among retail investors and Reddit users in recent months, and the year-to-date stock gain marks its best annual performance since 2013.Analysts are focused on 2023, when Nokia aims for an operating margin between 10% and 13% on sales growing faster than the market. Management was asked on the call why it isn?t upgrading guidance; Nokia said it was too early to change a target it set only four months ago. According to FactSet, the ratio of Nokia?s enterprise value to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, or Ebitda, is 10, compared with a median of 17 among competitors.For the quarter, Nokia posted sales of 5.31 billion euros ($6.3 billion), up 4%?or 9% when adjusted for currency fluctuations. The consensus was #$%$5.16 billion. Adjusted earnings per share were 9 euro cents, up from 6 euro cents a year ago and above the consensus of 4 euro cents.Lundmark says a new, simplified organizational structure is paying off. ?In the earlier setup, we had actually multiple management team members being partially responsible for one mobile network deal. Now it?s all in the Mobile Network business, and Tommi [Uitto] is fully responsible for that. So that is already showing its [positive] effects,? he said.J.P. Morgan analyst Sandeep Deshpande reiterated an Overweight rating on Nokia after the earnings report. He noted that the mobile networks business saw its gross margin surge from 31.1% in the first quarter to 38.9%, if a one-time software contract is excluded.When Ericsson turned around its networks business, margins rose from a low of 31.6% to 40.4%. ?We don?t see any reason why 2Q ?21 is not a similar milestone for Nokia,? he said."

"Facebook set to expand undersea Fiber Optic cable project in Africa by NOKIAThe 2Africa undersea cable project is part of Facebook's plans to lead the race in providing faster internet connections to the African continent.Facebook had first announced plans to build an undersea cable back in May 2020.Social media giant Facebook and global telecom majors China Mobile Ltd. and MTN Group Ltd have decided to expand a giant undersea cable they are building in Africa.These firms intend to add the Indian Ocean island nations of Seychelles and Comoros along with Angola and a new connection to Nigeria, as per a statement released on Monday. This will be in addition to a recently announced connection to the Canary Islands which are located off the coast of Northwestern Africa. The companies have now expanded the number of connection-landings to 35 which are in 26 countries, according to a Bloomberg report.""The significant investment by Facebook in 2Africa builds on several other investments we have made in the continent, including infrastructure investments in South Africa, Uganda, Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of Congo,"" explained a Facebook spokesperson in an email, according to Bloomberg.The 2Africa undersea cable project is part of Facebook's plans to lead the race in providing faster internet connections to the African continent. Africa has a population of 1.2 billion where more and more people are starting to use smartphones.Facebook had first announced plans to build an undersea cable back in May 2020. This was preceded by attempts to launch a satellite in 2016 which would have beamed signals across the world. However, the SpaceX rocket carrying the satellite blew up.2Africa is expected to be one of the largest undersea cable projects ever and will cost just under $1 billion. Marine surveys for building the undersea cable are likely to be completed by the end of 2021, the companies have stated. The 37,000-kilometre-long sub-sea cable will connect Africa, the Middle East and Europe.In the US, manufacturing for the first segment of the project's infrastructure has already begun, according to the statement. Nokia Oyj' Alcatel Submarine Networks has been contracted to build the cable.The undersea cable sector has been witnessing a resurgence of sorts as tech giants Facebook and Google have been behind about 80% of the recent investments in transatlantic links. Facebook and Google are looking to tap into the growing demand for fast-data transfers across the world."

"Nokia has been announced by Ethisphere Institute as one of the World’s Most Ethical Companies for the fourth year in a row. In 2021, 135 honorees were recognized spanning 22 countries and 47 industries. Nokia is one of three winners in the telecommunications industry and the only Finnish company to be honored."
"Suri in particular and Nokia's performance in general over the last 10 years... at least... has soured the investing community's opinion of them. Once a bad reputation, it is extremely difficult to earn a good reputation back. The worst thing for Pekka to do is to promise performance that the company fails to produce. Nok's word must be its bond and while in the day to day shortest of short runs, we want optimism but empty promises is far too dangerous to stumble into. On balance, I prefer Pekka's practice to be sure of his predictions because the investing public will hold him to a higher standard because of the company's record. And, so far, his way has yielded very good results. Those like me who has been patient for 10+ years can be patient for a little while longer. We will be richly rewarded and that is not baseless pollyanna...we can see the growth and credibility improving every day."

"China says crackdown on business to go on for yearsBBCThe Chinese government has unveiled a five-year plan outlining tighter regulation of much of its economy.It says new rules will be introduced covering areas including national security, technology and monopolies in the world's second largest economy.The plan comes soon after Beijing started targeting the technology and education industries.The document references Chairman Mao as China celebrates the 100th anniversary of the nation's Communist Party.The 10-point plan, which runs to the end of 2025, was released jointly late on Wednesday by China's State Council and the Communist Party's Central Committee.It said laws will be strengthened for ""important fields"" such as science and technological innovation, culture and education.The plan also said the Chinese government aims to tackle monopolies and ""foreign-related rule of law"".Regulations relating to China's digital economy, including ""internet finance, artificial intelligence, big data, cloud computing etc."" will also be reviewed.The announcement raised fresh concerns that Beijing's crackdown on technology and private education companies is set to continue and expand in years to come.Shares in many Chinese companies listed in the US, Hong Kong and mainland China have fallen sharply this year as investors' concerns grow over the crackdown.Beijing has already launched anti-monopoly investigations into some of the country's biggest technology firms and taken action against a wide range of other businesses.In April, technology giant Alibaba accepted a record $2.8bn (£2bn) fine after an investigation found that it had abused its dominant market position for years.Last month, Tencent was told to end exclusive music licensing deals with record labels around the world.Also in July, some of the country's biggest online platforms - Kuaishou, Tencent's messaging tool QQ, Alibaba's Taobao and Weibo - were ordered to remove inappropriate child-related content.This week, Chinese authorities said they had increased their scrutiny of after-school tuition services offered by individual teachers.During a recent inspection, one person and six institutions were punished for offering unlicensed after-school tutoring that broke regulations, the Beijing Municipal Education Commission said in a statement Monday.The move came as tutoring firms had changed how they operated after a government crackdown on the industry.Last month, Beijing unveiled a massive overhaul of China's $120bn private tutoring sector, under which all institutions offering tuition on school curricula will be registered as non-profit organisations.The new rules said: ""Curriculum subject-tutoring institutions are not allowed to go public for financing; listed companies should not invest in the institutions, and foreign capital is barred from such institutions.""Meanwhile, this week China's banking and insurance watchdog stepped up its regulation of online insurance companies, according to the Caixin news agency.The China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission ordered the firms to stop improper marketing and pricing or face ""severe punishment."""
Nok is like being lost at sea for 10 years. Most pointless investment ever.
"Press Release Base Station Antenna Market Worth $18.37 Bn at 16.2% CAGR; Industry Giants Such as PCTEL and Nokia to Focus on Meeting the Booming Demand for Advanced Antennas: The global base station antenna market size is projected to reach USD 18.37 billion by 2027, exhibiting a CAGR of 16.2% during the forecast period. Gradual rollout of 5G infrastructures around the world will be the most crucial growth determinant for this market, and Regional Forecast, 2020-2027"". According to the industry body Global System for Mobile Communications (GSMA), 5G networks will cover approximately one-third of the global population by 2025. This is punctuated by the fact that some of the world's largest economies are already deploying 5G infrastructures. For example, in 2019 in China, China Telecom, China Unicom, and China Mobile launched the world's largest 5G network, with services activated within five months of the rollout. Similarly, in Germany, Deutsche Telecom Germany and Vodafone Germany deployed 5G services across several cities in 2019. These network services are delivered through base station (BST) antennas installed in cell towers that facilitate data transmission. Since 5G networks are data-heavy, the demand for BST antennas is likely to surge with increasing deployment of 5G infrastructures in the world's major economic hubs."
This back and forth is exhausting.
"Press Release05 August 2021 Sydney, Australia – Nokia and TPG Telecom today announced the first global deployment of the latest generation of Nokia’s integrated 5G Interleaved Passive Active Antenna (IPAA) at a TPG Telecom site in Brisbane, following the successful introduction of Nokia’s IPAA solution in networks across the world. The Twin Beam version of Nokia’s IPAA delivers both 5G capability and greatly increases the capacity of 3G, 4G and 5G deployed on existing mid band frequencies through advanced antenna technology. This latest generation not only provides operators the ability to add 5G to an existing site without increasing the number or the size of the existing antennas on the site, but also doubles the range and greatly increases the capacity of all technologies deployed on existing mid band (e.g. 1800, 2100 and 2600 MHz) frequencies by up to 80%. Nokia’s IPAA solution has been developed in collaboration with CommScope. It will allow operators such as TPG Telecom to upgrade existing sites to 5G by simply replacing their existing antennas with a similar sized unit that supports all legacy technologies as well as 5G massive MIMO active antenna, all in a single compact solution. With this latest solution, operators can overcome many deployment challenges that can typically hinder the introduction of 5G and at the same time boost the coverage and capacity of their existing 3G and 4G networks."

Guys if we get this infrastructure bill through next week--I think we are eyeing 2 digits. My optimistic opinion.
"Still at a good price. Lots of big funds getting into NOK for some reason. Maybe its for what is expected once the inflation realities take hold. Most stocks at this time will seem very cheap when we look back on this ten years from now. Just a feeling I get as the Treasury keeps on sending out checks each month to Americans in their attempt to hold this country together. All that monopoly money will redefine the value of the Dollar sooner or later. NOK to three digits in a few years? Doubt it, but maybe they are right."

"THE RIGHT 5G STRATEGY WITH HELP FROM DIGITAL TWINS. Nokia has adopted a novel approach by creating a digital replica of the network, also known as a digital twin. Digital twin and data monitoring systems and algorithms can visualize ‘what if’ scenarios to design and optimize end-to-end network performance. From the RAN to the Core before the actual physical implementation. This technique is extremely useful for a deep analysis of the network and to find coverage gaps and revenue leakage by using analysis of traffic dynamics. For a European CSP, employing a digital twin, Nokia’s offer provides for 44 percent higher revenue than the traditional method. Digital twin-based analytics can be used to create digital design and investigate the future scalability of the network with the help of propriety tools which makes it possible to digitally model 5G-specific use cases. It can also analyze the selection of optimum beam sets in a 3D recreated environment. For a customer based in North America, Nokia’s design provided for 30 percent lower TCO than its own design baseline. https://www.nokia.com/blog/the-right-5g-strategy-with-help-from-digital-twins/"
"The ""stop loss"" orders triggered at about $5.97 and the follow on drop sales down to $5.93 looks completed. I think NOK's upward climb can resume. Still looking for $6.60 breakout tipping point."

"HUAWEI LOSES, QUALCOMM GAINS IN CHINA’S 5G ROLLOUT. China Mobile – the world’s largest carrier with more than 945 million subscribers as of June – opted to expand its existing 5G base station network with new equipment from one of Huawei’s main competitors: Qualcomm. Significantly, Huawei was not awarded any of the contracts while Qualcomm and its joint venture partners reportedly won half the orders for 320,000 5G modem sets. China Mobile risked losing its competitiveness in connection speeds and therefore future customers if it chose Huawei’s alternative products, which reportedly lack the same Western-made chips, the same reports said. Taiwan’s TSMC, the world’s leading high-end chip maker, is required to comply with US-imposed punitive export controls on Huawei. Huawei has not updated its total worldwide 5G orders for more than a year, while Ericsson, Nokia and Qualcomm are moving to fill the void in the West – and in Qualcomm’s case are even making formidable inroads into China’s home market. https://asiatimes.com/2021/08/huawei-loses-qualcomm-gains-in-chinas-5g-rollout/"

Nokia stoc is currently on discount sale. Intrinsic value of NOK based on the guidance for 2021 is around $7.8. We will reach it by next ER in October. If 3Q report brings another surprise and/or 2023 guidance change we will marsh towards $12.
Its very good levels to buy.. we going to see incremental improvement in profit margins. Sooner we should see 15% margins on the top line numbers. Its on longer bullish trend from here.. good luck.

"As predicted the casino gang managed to take it down below 6 before the strike 6 call option expire.Good work on their part mostly due to the disorganized minions. As I stated before the SP of this stock does not have much to do with its potential, future prospects. It has been a winning riding horse for the casino gang which they will hold dearly until this company shows substantial earnings or attractive contracts with private or governmental institutions. The financial theory preached by some on this board is a good theory but it is for the school environment and not real life circumstances especially in the case of this stock."

"My educated guess is that next super-catalyst for NOK could be the next Internet evolution into ""Metaverse"". FB is all in on it.NOK seems to be in the sweet spot - 5G is absolutely essential for the success of Metaverse. Google this word yourself and reach your own conclusions.If NOK is smart and is currently investing into R&D in this area, it can truly be bigger than AMD. If this Metaverse pans out, valuations of the companies in this area will eclipse everything we ever saw before!Hope Pekka reads the posts in this Board :-))))"
"Including today, Nokia has been consolidating for 7 trading days since reaching a recent high of $6.29 twice on 8/3 & 8/4 and it has now twice bounced off the 20 Day Moving Average yesterday & today which is a very Bullish indicator for the short term. Technically, Nokia is looking positive and being only .27c off the recent $6.29 high, NOK is setting up nicely for a run to $7."

I don't get these 15 Million share trading days at a point in time when Nokia is receiving more positive attention than it has in years. I guess everyone is on vacation and taking a pause.
Nok has been holding 6 which is good. If it can get past 8 it will help leave behind the remnants of the meme surge last Feb. Once it hits double digits it will open up NOK to a whole universe of institutional investors which will help absorb the large share float. How about some share buy backs to help to process along?

"Nokia’s EV/EBITDA ratio is estimated at 11x for fiscal year 2022, according to consensus estimates which isn’t too outrageous by todays standard.And with a positive net cash position of 3.7 billion euros, free cash flow positive and on the rise, a strong management team, a strong R&D focus, and a productive legacy patent portfolio – Nokia should be able to continue its upward march towards making itself a blue-chip technology"

"@walid Pekka Lundmark's Nokia is up about 20% in less than 13 months as CEO. In contrast, Börje Ekholm started as Ericsson's CEO January 16 2017 when the sp was about $6. From the starting date Ericsson's sp fluctuated between $6 and $7 and had actually a low of $6 on April 2 2018, i.e. more than 14 MONTHS after he started as CEO.

"Nokia deploys private LTE to Western Power Distribution for smart grid trialsWestern Power Distribution (WPD) is testing 4.9G/LTE and future 5G to support operation of its smart grid including SCADA, voice, video and data servicesNokia supplies Modular Private Wireless (MPW) solution and Nokia Industrial end devices for trial network at WPD’s test and development center in Taunton, UK12 August 2021Espoo, Finland – Nokia today announced that it has provided a private 4.9G/LTE wireless network to Western Power Distribution in the UK. The private LTE network will be used for supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA*) testing, as well as other mission-critical systems such as voice services.WPD’s ""LTE Connecting Futures"" trial is testing a new LTE network to enable its smart grid. The 4.9G/LTE core, radio and user equipment were supplied by Nokia for WPD’s research at its Test and Development Center in Taunton, UK.WPD’s communications network provides secure, resilient and reliable services to support the daily operations of WPD, which distributes electricity to the Midlands, South West and Wales. These services include the use of licensed and unlicensed radio, microwave, and fiber networks.Nokia worked with WPD to install and test Nokia 4.9G/LTE MPW private wireless, as well as the mission critical Nokia Group Communications Talk/Video solution, together with Nokia Industrial user equipment including workpads, supporting SCADA and other applications. Integrated and optimized to represent a ‘typical’ private LTE network in Band 87 (410-430Mhz), WPD tested operational characteristics, including assessment of throughput in interference and non-interference environments.Phil Rigden, Telecoms Manager for WPD, said: ""Through the challenges posed by the pandemic, we have worked closely with Nokia over the last two years to demonstrate the capability of its 4.9G/LTE private wireless solution to support the operation of our smartgrid including SCADA, voice, video and data services. We have been able to document key learnings to share with the utility industry that confirm the suitability of 4.9G/LTE and 5G to provide the connectivity platform for tomorrow’s grid.""Matthieu Bourguignon, Vice President Europe, Nokia Enterprise, said: ""The industrial test environment we have established with WPD is providing a platform to trial various grid use cases on private wireless networks. These include Active Network Monitoring, power quality measurements, CCTV, distributed generation and automation of the smart grid. The range of applications and uses of private wireless will further support the industry to meet the regulatory challenges of providing clean, sustainable energy.”Private wireless network slicing was also trialed for possible use of the same physical networks by tenant companies in the gas and electricity sectors.With a strong marketplace appetite to capture the transformational benefits of Industry 4.0, energy companies turning to Nokia for private wireless networking include Elektro, Equinor, QTnet, and Siemens. With more than 340 large enterprise customers across industries worldwide, of which over 40 incorporate 5G, Nokia has been cited by numerous industry analysts as the leading provider of private wireless networking worldwide.Nokia has deployed mission-critical networks to over 1,500 leading enterprise customers in the transport, energy, large enterprise, manufacturing, webscale, and public sector segments around the globe.

"ICYMI: TOMMI UITTO ABOUT THE PRODUCT LAUNCH OF THE YEAR which took place in late June. Networking maker Nokia has completed its new fifth generation (5g) base station products. With them, it estimates that it has gained a years-long lead over its competitors. The new AirScale products increase the capacity and performance of mobile networks and make it easier and faster to build networks. These new 5g products have been developed at Nokia over the past two years. “This is the biggest product launch in many, many years. In recent years, we haven’t had very much interesting to say about the new 5g base station products. It feels really good that we have reached this very important milestone. We were ahead of the competitors in 5g, but with the new products we can catch up, ”says Tommi Uitto, Director of Mobile Networks.Central to the new products is how many cells can be connected to the baseband units, how much of them can get traffic through per second, and how many connections can be on at the same time. “In all of these, we are now ahead of them at the level of competitors and in certain features, thanks to the new products,” says Uitto. In base stations attached to the external walls and masts of buildings, it is increasingly important that they be as small, light and energy-efficient as possible. According to Nokia, the new products will reduce energy consumption by up to 75 percent. “Our competitors have reported active antennas for 32 radio transceivers weighing 19 kg and 18 kg. Our new active antennas for 32 radio transceivers weigh 17 pounds and are therefore the lightest in the industry. In addition, our products have the widest band on the market from which radio traffic is controlled. ”“This is Nokia’s most successful introduction of new baseband cards to the market in at least 20 years or perhaps even the most successful of all time. By this record, I mean in particular how quickly and easily baseband cards have been developed.” In 2018–2020, Nokia has hired 1,200 people in Finland, mainly for product development in Espoo, Tampere and Oulu. “This year, we will hire a total of about 500 employees in Finland for research and development. Almost all of them come from system circuits and software development.” The mobile network unit led by Uito is Nokia's largest. The unit employs approximately 18,000 people in research and development. “Certainly each of them has to some extent played his part in the development of new products, but roughly an estimated 10,000 people have been actively involved in their development. We have increased the number of 5g product developers by 40 percent from the beginning of 2019 to the end of 2020, but within that figure, the number of system circuit developers is as much as 200 percent.” Uitto was appointed head of mobile networks and a member of Nokia’s management team in November 2018, when his predecessor Marc Rouanne was fired. Today, the company has 165 contracts on fifth-generation mobile networks. Of these, 66 are in use. Uitto emphasizes that competition in the market is very fierce. “There is no reason to declare any victory over competitors here, as the competition is like a marathon in nature. After looking at new products announced by competitors in recent months, we estimate to be at least at the same level. However, radio network products have so many technical features that a lot depends on which feature is considered. ” One thing he is sure of, though. “These new products will significantly improve our competitiveness. I am very excited.” Slightly abbreviated article translated from Finnish by Google Translate: https://www.hs.fi/talous/art-2000008079649.html"

"With a close at 5.20 EUR in Helsinki, Nokia has climbed 65% YTD in Europe and is .17 EUR from a 52 week high. Still waiting on additional analyst upgrades in Price Targets as well as EPS projections for 2021 & 2022. It's surprising that EPS targets haven't been raised since Nokia raised 2021 Operating Margin from (7% to 10%) to (10% to 12%) which is a 30% increase at the mid-points. A 30% increase in previous EPS estimates puts 2021 at or near $.50 for 2021. This level of growth should warrant a 20 to 25 P/E which for 2021 would value NOK at $10 to $15 per share. Projections for 2022 could be even higher so it's just a matter of time until Nokia starts to gain the attention of Wall Street."

In Q2 of 2020, Nokia generated just 0.02 EUR of EPS.Last quarter, its net sales came in at 5.3 billion EUR, up 4% versus the same period a year earlier. Analysts’ average, estimate was 5.16 billion EUR. Meanwhile, Nokia’s operating profit surged 61% year-over-year to 682 million EUR. Finally, it raised its 2021 net sales guidance to 21.7 billion EUR-22.7 billion EUR from 20.6 billion EUR -21.8 billion EUR previously.Also importantly, Nokia’s selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses fell 1% YOY to 585 million EUR last quarter, while its return on invested capital jumped seven percentage points YOY to 18.4% from 11.4%.New Chip, Cost Cutting Gave Nokia a BoostIn a previous article, I noted that Nokia was in the midst of changing the chips that power its 5G offerings ” from Field Programmable Gate Arrays or FPGAs, which are very expensive, large, and energy-intensive, to cheaper, much more efficient SoCs.” Nokia calls its new 5G chipset — which it developed in partnership with Broadcom (NASDAQ:BRCM), Marvell (NASDAQ:MRVL), and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) — ReefShark.According to Nokia, ReefShark extensively utilizes AI, and Light Reading reported in March that ReefShark carries higher margins than the FPGAs that the company had previously used.Encouragingly, during the company’s Q2 earnings conference call, its CEO, Pekka Lundmark, reported that it had successfully launched a number of new systems that utilize ReefShark, including “new AirScale Radio and Baseband product platforms,” which were launched in June, MIMO Active Antenna radios, and 8T8R radios. Lundmark added that, by the end of 2021, Nokia anticipates that it will have “largely” caught up with its 5G infrastructure rivals in all the areas in which it had been lagging.In Q2, 54% of Nokia’s product shipped with ReefShark chips, and Lundmark said that the company remained on track to ship 70% of its 5G products with those chips by the end of 2021.Additionally, the CEO reported that its current baseband products are ” up to 75% more power efficient” than its previous offerings, while it now has the lightest MIMO active antenna in the sector.The decline in the company’s SG&A spending, which came despite the sizeable increase in its revenue, shows that Lundmark is continuing to tighten the belt at Nokia, in accordance with my previous predictions. And the strong growth in Nokia’s ROIC shows that the company’s financial health and overall performance have improved under Lundmark’s leadership.Other Signs of ProgressAt the end of May, Nokia disclosed that T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) Netherlands had selected it “to deliver automated network and security operations.” The deal could lead to Nokia being selected to work on T-Mobile’s projects in other countries.In July, Nokia received its first 5G deal in China, obtaining a 10% share of a contract from China Mobile and 4% of the roughly $6 billion that was spread over three deals from the Chinese telecom giant. In China, Nokia is benefiting from the fact that Sweden, decided to block Chinese telecom company Huawei from making deals in the Scandinavian country. One of Nokia’s top rivals, Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC), is based in Sweden.Further, Lundmark reported that the company had signed two automotive licensing deals , including one with Daimler (OTC:DDAIF), last quarter. He suggested that, as vehicles become more connected, Nokia is likely to obtain more such contracts.Finally, Cowen analyst Paul Silverstein wrote that Nokia was benefiting from “improving execution” and predicted that the tech company’s financial results should rebound further going forward. The analyst praised Lundmark’s performance and increased his price target on NOK stock to $8 from $5."

In response to questions on what has changed since six months ago (regarding the outlook), management noted larger 5G investment, greater traction for home broadband (both access and core networks). The CEO noted that base stations need to be back-haul connected, driving demand for routers and optical networking. The same is true for home broadband connectivity (with higher investment in regional networks). To manage all this, operators are increasing spend on software, automation and cloud. Collectively this forms the potential ""super cycle"" that could last several years - Covid having acted as an accelerant.Strong Buy"
CNBC and Nokia...Has anyone noticed that CNBC commentators don't mention Nokia. Any thoughts on why?
There is know volume causing Nokia to drift lower. There really hasn't been any negative news since the quarterly report and upgrades. Just a lull as I see it before the NEXT BIG LEG UP.
"Even though no movement on the Union Wireless contract, my uneducated surmise is this first contract coming just as the infrastructure deal is nearing completion is critically important. Support across party lines that extension of access to rural areas will be targetted for a substantial portion of the billions of infrastructure dollars. They are ripping out Huawei equipment and should that not suggest other states will follow suit and choose Nokia to replace Huawei equipment in their state. Seems to me by conjecture at least that this could be very significant. Smarter people than me with information about the possible size of the full national project should share their opinions."

"Nokia is $.30c off of the recent high of $6.28 (less than 5%) and the technicals of their chart looks strong for those that are bullish on the stock. All 4 business units are performing well for the company and recent announcements have only strengthened the confidence of increased revenue and margin projections. Questions of Buybacks/Dividends/R&D/Cash Uses fill this board, which differ in opinion which I believe is a result of different time horizons of individuals positions. The Reddit/WSB activity back in January got some people excited for a potential ""get rich quick"" investment in Nokia which isn't likely to happen again. So you do your DD to predict the future movement of the stock and take the noise out from the daily activity. The current direction of revenue, margin, profit, and free cash are moving in a direction that dictates that the stock price will move higher. How much higher and how quickly of a move will depend on the demand of those wanting to buy the stock?"
"Nok will go down as the most pointless investment ever. 10 yrs from now it will be the same price, if they are even still in business."
"I'm looking forward to buying more next week as it may be the last chance before we start really pushing up. Each penny up or down to me is $3,660, I think I would like at least another 4k shares. This is the best and safest stock on the market, in my opinion. If you have a better /safer stock, please clue me in. Thanks"
I believe the drop is due to systemic problems in the market and a drop in consumer sentiment which has dipped below 70 probably because of an over reaction to the delta variant but there is gonna be a correction to the nasdaq at some point IMHO not sure when ABU what do you think?
"Too many gibberish comments on the board. NOK has crossed a positive cash flow. This is a great recovery in the making. The key to NOK is to complete their projects as quickly as possible to increase their profit and revenue. Without the increase performance, NOK will have a hard time implementing buy back shares or pay dividends. Let’s hope they prioritize and execute their contracts accordingly so that we can see $10 or more quickly. Let’s hope for another blowout earnings next quarter."
I'm off to work and I expect all my fellow longs to hold the fort and to give NYSE a thumbs down for any negativity.
We are up 50% on the year and will likely end up still way undervalued entering 2022 with 75%+ ytd gain.

The market simply cannot continue to ignore the great business successes. The market is tentative but the commentators and prognosticators are lining up solidly behind us with only the irrational or ill intended not flying the banner proudly and prominenly. Nokia has built up a horrible record and it will take time to re-build. We are too close to achieving that monumental task to temper it with gimmicky dividends that surely will tamp down performance.

"I was going to write an analysis of the share count that people make a huge fuss about. Yahoo (RIP junk platform) does not allow this presumambly due to some word(s) it interprets as spam or abusiveness. Let's see if just my conclusions can be published:CONCLUSION: What matters to the shareholder is the actual and expected performance of the company, as reflected in valuation metrics, and the percentual ownership a shareholder has of the company. Buybacks can be a good way to distribute the company's cash. A change in the share count through the emission of new shares for the use of the company or through buybacks have real-world implications. However, initial share count as such is meaningless as is the change of it if it happens through a (reverse) split. Those who claim otherwise should present clear evidence in support of their diverging opinion."

Obviously, those factors figure in but we all know other significant factors impact decisions including manipulation but excluding rational attempts at greater profits through outright cheating, the psychology of investors is clearly impacted by the absolute number attached to a share of stock. A $5 share price evokes images of JC Penney and a $50 price tag evokes Amazon while a $1000 share price evokes Neiman Marcus. Even though each price value-wise is identical. The stock market is far from fully rational and any discussion of share price must take that function into account. So does it mean stupidity...No...merely...human! We are here to make money and we cannot ignore even a baby elephant in the room."

"The Broadband Future is FiberliciousNokia Touts Portfolio Wares and VisionNokia, as a top-tier global PON market player, unveiled new portfolio assets that demonstrate the company’s ability to drive innovation across the fiber market:Live demonstration of Nokia 25G-PON solutionsSmall form factor modular OLT (MF-2)Nokia Fixed Wireless Access CPE, including the FastMile CBRS receiver and 5G gatewayWi-Fi live demo showcase, including:o Mesh network with Nokia WiFi beaconso Nokia WiFi Cloud Controllero Nokia WiFi mobile appI view Nokia’s Fiber Connect contributions as vital to advancing the overall fiber cause since it shows why fiber is key to the overall broadband mission, including interworking with 5G FWA (Fixed Wireless Access), WiFi and mobile technologies. Through using fiber backhaul, operators strengthen the use case for 5G FWA services, especially in scenarios where fiber-to-the-premise may be constrained due to physical barriers like large bodies of water or remote rural locations. Likewise, fiber backhaul improves WiFi use cases by ensuring the fastest speeds, including increasingly important upload speeds in the post-pandemic WFH era.Key Takeaways on Fiber Connect 2021 and the Fiber Broadband FutureOverall, I believe the Fiber Connect 2021 event demonstrated that fiber broadband networks are vital to meeting post-pandemic society-wide goals that include scaling and protecting the distributed WFH workforce, distance learning, telehealth, and premium entertainment. Fiber is critical to advancing the overall broadband mission which includes supporting 5G FWA, WiFi mesh, WiFi mobility, and 5G small cells. Equally important, fiber is critical for ensuring digital equity and enabling all communities to leverage fiber to meet their economic and societal needs. Key fiber ecosystem players Clearfield, ADTRAN, Radisys, DZS, Calix, and Nokia all demonstrated that their fiber portfolio assets and capabilities are ready to meet these top-priority societal objectives and make sure fiber plays an essential role."

"There is frequent talk about dividends on this boardGuess what company is in terrible shape, that has not paid a dime in dividends since its inception? AmazonPaying dividends means you have less capital to reinvest in business growth. When you are in a company in a growth mode, you better off reinvesting the money and it is much better both for the company and shareholders. Dividends are good idea only for companies with stabilized level of earnings and no explosive growth potential like Clorox. And those kind of companies are more or less predictable earnings year over year and are good for conservative investments, not for companies that are entering into aggressive super-cycle, like NOK in 5G or Amazon many years ago in online retail, when reinvesting all the money you could get enabled Amazon to ward off the competition and get ahead. Of course, if NOK can pay dividends and grow the business at the same time, even better."

"NORDEA BANK TODAY: MARVELL GUIDANCE SUPPORTS NOKIA'S REEFSHARK DELIVERIES. Nokia's (buy, EUR 6.0) new chipset supplier Marvell Technologies reported its Q2 results last week. We believe their comments on 5G support circuit board deliveries by Nokia and Samsung. Marvell's net sales increased by 49% last year compared to 1.08 billion dollars, which was 1% above consensus and above above the guidance given by management. The adjusted EPS increased by $0.34 from last year's $0.21, which also beat the consensus $0.31 forecast. Operator infrastructure sales grew to $197 million, an increase of 17% to the previous quarter and 38% growth compared to last year. The increase was due to mainly the Inphi acquisition as well as of growth of wireless networks business, driven by Nokia and Samsung 5G deployments. Marvell Technologies expects net sales to grow during the third quarter driven by growth in cloud data centers and 5G business. The company believes also 5G business to grow in the third quarter significantly from the second quarter and sees growth accelerating further in the fourth quarter."

"Verizons mmWave 5g while very fast the signal can only be reveived about 800 feet from the tower and doesnt pass through objects well at all. T-Mobile using Nokia equipment with a mid-band 5g signal travels about 15,000 feet from its tower. I believe this was a critical mistake by Verizon to choose the wrong network type from the start while tmobile chose the better network. Ultimately Verizon will start to deploy a mid band network but its estimated not to be rolled out until late next year. By that time T mobiles network might have covered almost 250 million people (legitimately). The churn rate for people leaving verizon for tmobile is very high right now. Lastly; Tmobiles 5G home is one of the biggest winners in all of this while Nokia is also enjoying robust sales at Verizons expense supplying the 5G routers and nodes required to connect to this network. Strangely this had to be obvious when Verizon was trialing the 2 different network types and equipment. My guess is some very big egos were in play here and have since doubled down on their strong opinions. Im wondering if Samsung network equipment is only going to used for the mmwave network and will Verizon start to use Nokia & Ericsson when they roll out mid & low band next year?"

"DELL’ORO EXPECTS RAN MARKET TO GROW 10-15% IN 2021. The radio access network (RAN) market continued to grow in the second quarter despite obstacles like the global pandemic, supply chain shortages and export restrictions, according to Dell’Oro Group. Based on preliminary findings, the RAN market operated at elevated levels during the second quarter, the research firm noted. That means it’s on track to reach cumulative global RAN investments of about $240 billion in the 2020-2025 forecast period. The transition from 4G to 5G is the primary driver of the positive momentum that’s propelling the market to six consecutive quarters of year-over-year growth and the upward revision for the full-year 2021, said Stefan Pongratz, VP and analyst with Dell’Oro Group. He also cited new fixed wireless access (FWA) and enterprise capex, as well as transitions toward active antenna systems. Total RAN is now projected to advance 10% to 15% in 2021.For the big players, RAN rankings didn’t change in the second quarter. Huawei and ZTE were the No. 1 and No. 2 suppliers in China, while Ericsson and Nokia dominated the No. 1 and 2 positions outside of China. Preliminary estimates suggest that Ericsson and Samsung recorded revenue gains outside China, while Huawei and ZTE improved their positions in China. Nokia’s RAN-related turnaround efforts continued to move in the right direction, supported by performance and cost improvements to its RAN portfolio, Pongratz said. “Despite the expected share losses in the North America region, we estimate that Nokia’s RAN revenues increased in the quarter, marking a fourth consecutive quarter of Y/Y gains,"" he said. ""At the same time, preliminary findings suggest its revenue share outside of China was impacted negatively in the first half relative to 2020."" https://www.fiercewireless.com/tech/dell-oro-expects-ran-market-to-grow-10-15-2021"

"@Noxu Just to be clear, the end-to-end product portfolio strategy wasn't Suri's idea as you claimed.It was solidified after Michel Combes visited all of Alcatel-Lucent's major customers and surveyed them on their wants and needs. They overwhelmingly favored ALU keeping and building a full line product portfolio so that they (the customers) could do one-stop-shopping.Nokia inherited that from ALU. Curiously, Nokia was fairly recently still talking about an end-to-end portfolio as one of their strengths, even as they move away from it.From my unbiased viewpoint as a longtime ATT Bell Labs Engineer, LU and ALU stockholder, Nokia's success today is mostly due to products that that were developed and championed by the previous administration. The big difference is that the market is NOW ready to buy. Suri and Risto's strengths were in product development and they did an overall great job in that regard, albeit with a few costly missteps that slowed down progress for awhile. Pekka's organizational skill set is right and good for the current climate going forward. But giving HIM most of the credit for the turnaround is an easily proven piece of propaganda that he readily embraces and even seems to be trying to create.Two big things that are helping Nokia today are 1. The SoC conversion, which was well under way and ahead of schedule when Pekka took over. 2. Nokia's strong focus on building network security into their offerings from the start of the product development phase. The former BoD Chairman (Risto) was behind this because that's what his background and expertise was. The competition is trying to catch up by adding increased security as a veneer and an add-on instead of from the core design, so Nokia will probably have a security advantage for a long time, especially if Pekka keeps Risto's focus on that area.Suri posted a strong quarter (and earnings beat) in his final presentation before handing the reins to Pekka. That momentum has continued right through this year.Sure, previous administrations, including Suri's made mistakes, but the TRUTH is always more complex and nuanced than the given narrative.Pekka's improvements will be a boon for Nokia but in NO WAY are they primarily responsible for Nokia's CURRENT strengths. Those can easily be traced back to the Siilasmaa / Suri years.Suri actually handed over a solid turnaround in progress to Pekka, but Pekka didn't accept that or didn't want to.It was in his best interest to portray Nokia as a struggling company that HE would turn around. SO he came out of the gate with a gloom and doom message for 2021, to set the stage for HIS fixes, while ignoring all (or most) of the good things that were ALREADY happening and in place. He tanked the stock THREE TIMES with his overly-cautionary forecasts and warnings (all of which proved to be false).If Pekka had just touted the REAL path that Nokia was already on and BUILT on the successes of Nokia's strengths and highlighted a totally POSITIVE message from DAY ONE, then his words would NOT have tanked the pps and WE would in all likelihood be in the $8 range TODAY.BUT he and Sari are in control now, so they will continue with the PR that THEY should get ALL the credit for the turnaround. Smart and impartial observers know better - but history will record Pekka's spin because that's how it works and people like @Noxu (and many others) have drank the cool-aid.There were two BIg problems associated with the Suri era. 1. The choice to go with FPGA chips in the Reefshark series. In hindsight, it looks like a screw-up, but at the time, there were good reasons for this decision. They were a superior design with a lot of programmable flexibility. At the time the 5G standards were not completely SET yet and if they guessed wrong with the SoC design, there was NO flexibility to adjust on the fly. Even though the FPGA chips were superior, customers were not willing to pay extra for them. The competition gambled on their SoC design fitting the final standards and that gamble paid off. BUt Suri's team quickly responded to that big problem, they hired 300 engineers to design their own SoC's and got the manufacturing capability by expanding the vendors who would build them.By the time Pekka took over, the SoC plan was fully in place and was making remarkable progress AHEAD of schedule.The second big problem at the end of Suri's administration was the loss of a large Verizon contract. Hard to blame Suri for that. Verizon hired a former Ericsson executive as their new CEO and HE decided to look for other options - Verizon's long-standing relationship with Nokia's business changed overnight. NOt much that Suri could do about that.During most of Suri's time, the 5G market was not ready to accelerate and the 4G business was in natural decline. So I don't fault them for not doing gangbuster business in those years. They TRIED a few things that missed the mark, but I give them credit for trying."

"To those potential retail investors who are at this moment contemplating putting in money in Nokia stock. Just be aware that Nokia stock price is not the type that moves aggressively in either direction. Think of Nokia at this moment in time as a tanker out in the Mediterranean transporting oil from the middle east. It takes a few miles (nautical or otherwise ) to shift it's direction slightly. But once it shifts, it's all ""steam"" ahead. Does that make sense???"
"EU is RED today )) many stocks down over 2%as I many time stated Nokia is NOT immune from market swings))I have order in to buy more shares of Nokia at $ 5, 82I think that risk for Nokia to go down much more from this level is very low"
