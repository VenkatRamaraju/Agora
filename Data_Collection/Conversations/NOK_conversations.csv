Nice close above 6. Keep those puts from printing. Cant wait until this trade above 25 a share. Thats when sellers regrets set in. See yall January 2022. 10+ 
Some of you want dividends but the foreign tax is huge and on top you pay US tax. l rather see the stock go up closer to $8.00 than the measly dividend.
"First I am bullish on Nokia and am not pumping because it does no good, but wondering if anyone else feels like Nokia does not even post half of their wins, they seem to have an awful lot of them all over the world. Or is it just yahoo that picks and chooses what they think. I have also noticed the negative articles have also trickle down to about zero. ( zacks don't count ) I enjoy reading this board and thank all of the contributors who give us the positive information that keeps us in this game. By the way anyone know what a grand old par is"
"NORDEA BANK TODAY: MARVELL GUIDANCE SUPPORTS NOKIA'S REEFSHARK DELIVERIES. Nokia's (buy, EUR 6.0) new chipset supplier Marvell Technologies reported its Q2 results last week. We believe their comments on 5G support circuit board deliveries by Nokia and Samsung. Marvell's net sales increased by 49% last year compared to 1.08 billion dollars, which was 1% above consensus and above above the guidance given by management. The adjusted EPS increased by $0.34 from last year's $0.21, which also beat the consensus $0.31 forecast. Operator infrastructure sales grew to $197 million, an increase of 17% to the previous quarter and 38% growth compared to last year. The increase was due to mainly the Inphi acquisition as well as of growth of wireless networks business, driven by Nokia and Samsung 5G deployments. Marvell Technologies expects net sales to grow during the third quarter driven by growth in cloud data centers and 5G business. The company believes also 5G business to grow in the third quarter significantly from the second quarter and sees growth accelerating further in the fourth quarter."
"With a close at 5.20 EUR in Helsinki, Nokia has climbed 65% YTD in Europe and is .17 EUR from a 52 week high. Still waiting on additional analyst upgrades in Price Targets as well as EPS projections for 2021 & 2022. It's surprising that EPS targets haven't been raised since Nokia raised 2021 Operating Margin from (7% to 10%) to (10% to 12%) which is a 30% increase at the mid-points. A 30% increase in previous EPS estimates puts 2021 at or near $.50 for 2021. This level of growth should warrant a 20 to 25 P/E which for 2021 would value NOK at $10 to $15 per share. Projections for 2022 could be even higher so it's just a matter of time until Nokia starts to gain the attention of Wall Street."
This company is so grossly under-valued sitting on 2 Billion plus dollars in CASH and they does not yet give our Dividends to their share holders or raising a huge buying back shares program the stock is trading at $6.03 today. Can someone tell me what am I missing why isn't this stock rising to the roof its at least all time high I had to open a position and want to buy more but something got to be missing but I don't know what it is maybe somebody on the board can enlighten me? Any thoughts from the longs on the board would be welcome and appreciated.

"Nokia expands 5G radio and core contract with A1 Telekom Austria Group into new markets • Nokia extends 5G RAN and Core solutions to Bulgaria, Serbia, and Slovenia • The deal continues Nokia’s long-standing partnership with A1 Telekom Austria Group23 August 2021Espoo, Finland – Nokia today announced that it has been selected by A1 Telekom Austria Group (A1) to extend its 5G footprint outside of Austria into Bulgaria, Serbia, and Slovenia. The multi-country single vendor deal will see Nokia provide 5G RAN solutions from its comprehensive AirScale portfolio to all three markets and 5G Standalone core network to Serbia and Slovenia. The deployment is already underway in Bulgaria and is expected to start imminently in all other markets. Nokia is already providing comprehensive 5G coverage across Austria and will evolve its strategic partnership with A1 with this expanded deal. Nokia will provide equipment from its AirScale portfolio including 5G RAN and other Nokia AirScale radio access products which will deliver incredible speeds, connectivity, and capacity to their subscribers. Nokia’s cloud-native 5G Standalone Core software leverages machine learning and artificial intelligence and will enable near zero-touch automation capabilities for A1 in Serbia and Slovenia to drive greater scale and reliability. Nokia’s open 5G Standalone Core architecture will also give A1 the flexibility to be responsive to market demands while controlling costs at a time of growing network complexity by streamlining operations and unlocking crucial capabilities, such as network slicing. Nokia will support A1 in their efforts to cover all major populated communities as well as main roads within the next 5 years. The rollout will also offer innovative new services to consumers as well as vertical industries such as Industry 4.0. A1 is committed to continually improving and expanding its network infrastructure to maintain its position as market leader. Nokia is a long-standing partner of A1 and had worked collaboratively to introduce 3G and 4G mobile networks as well as Austria's largest fiber-optic network and multiple private wireless campus installations. Alex Kuchar, Group Director Technology & Future Services at A1 Telekom Austria Group said: “As we take steps towards the introduction of 5G in these new markets it is imperative we have the best network infrastructure to offer our customers commercial 5G services that delivers all the technological advantages and benefits of 5G. We are therefore pleased to continue our partnership with Nokia and I looked forward to working collaboratively with them to deploy market-leading digital services on this multi-market project.” Tommi Uitto, President of Mobile Networks, Nokia, said: “We are delighted to have been selected by A1 Telekom Austria Group to support their rollout of our AirScale 5G RAN and core technology across Bulgaria, Serbia and Slovenia. They continue to place their trust in our technology and are committed to delivering best-in-class services to their subscribers around the world. We look forward to working collaboratively with them moving forward.”"
I still believe Nokia is in a positive uptrend. We need another company like Cisco to show some interest. Have a bidding war. Nokia has turned the corner and has positive earning and a bright future.
"Verizons mmWave 5g while very fast the signal can only be reveived about 800 feet from the tower and doesnt pass through objects well at all. T-Mobile using Nokia equipment with a mid-band 5g signal travels about 15,000 feet from its tower. I believe this was a critical mistake by Verizon to choose the wrong network type from the start while tmobile chose the better network. Ultimately Verizon will start to deploy a mid band network but its estimated not to be rolled out until late next year. By that time T mobiles network might have covered almost 250 million people (legitimately). The churn rate for people leaving verizon for tmobile is very high right now. Lastly; Tmobiles 5G home is one of the biggest winners in all of this while Nokia is also enjoying robust sales at Verizons expense supplying the 5G routers and nodes required to connect to this network. Strangely this had to be obvious when Verizon was trialing the 2 different network types and equipment. My guess is some very big egos were in play here and have since doubled down on their strong opinions. Im wondering if Samsung network equipment is only going to used for the mmwave network and will Verizon start to use Nokia & Ericsson when they roll out mid & low band next year?"
l have never seen a company with close to 3 billion dollars in cash and the stock is sitting at $6.00 a share. let's get this thing moving north. Nokia should be close to $8.00 by now.
nokia is consolidating. next leap on the way. but please don't be impatient. nokia is NOT A MEME STOCK. we are being tracked closely by Nokia.he and Europeans trade by fundementals. we will slowly rise to $10 soon. maybe mid of next year.
"I just read an article that NOK CEO stated a possible ""Super Cycle"" Outlook in connectivity demand (see statement below):He stated that the Outlook for 5G industry growth to continue for next 2 / 3 years, then sustain that level towards end of the decade - with potential for what management described as a ""super cycle"" in connectivity demand. In response to questions on what has changed since six months ago (regarding the outlook), management noted larger 5G investment, greater traction for home broadband (both access and core networks). The CEO noted that base stations need to be back-haul connected, driving demand for routers and optical networking. The same is true for home broadband connectivity (with higher investment in regional networks). To manage all this, operators are increasing spend on software, automation and cloud. Collectively this forms the potential ""super cycle"" that could last several years - Covid having acted as an accelerant.Strong Buy"

"DELL’ORO EXPECTS RAN MARKET TO GROW 10-15% IN 2021. The radio access network (RAN) market continued to grow in the second quarter despite obstacles like the global pandemic, supply chain shortages and export restrictions, according to Dell’Oro Group. Based on preliminary findings, the RAN market operated at elevated levels during the second quarter, the research firm noted. That means it’s on track to reach cumulative global RAN investments of about $240 billion in the 2020-2025 forecast period. The transition from 4G to 5G is the primary driver of the positive momentum that’s propelling the market to six consecutive quarters of year-over-year growth and the upward revision for the full-year 2021, said Stefan Pongratz, VP and analyst with Dell’Oro Group. He also cited new fixed wireless access (FWA) and enterprise capex, as well as transitions toward active antenna systems. Total RAN is now projected to advance 10% to 15% in 2021.For the big players, RAN rankings didn’t change in the second quarter. Huawei and ZTE were the No. 1 and No. 2 suppliers in China, while Ericsson and Nokia dominated the No. 1 and 2 positions outside of China. Preliminary estimates suggest that Ericsson and Samsung recorded revenue gains outside China, while Huawei and ZTE improved their positions in China. Nokia’s RAN-related turnaround efforts continued to move in the right direction, supported by performance and cost improvements to its RAN portfolio, Pongratz said. “Despite the expected share losses in the North America region, we estimate that Nokia’s RAN revenues increased in the quarter, marking a fourth consecutive quarter of Y/Y gains,"" he said. ""At the same time, preliminary findings suggest its revenue share outside of China was impacted negatively in the first half relative to 2020."" https://www.fiercewireless.com/tech/dell-oro-expects-ran-market-to-grow-10-15-2021"

"@Abu reason many companies prefer shares buy back instead of dividend is because of tax implications. no tax on shares buy back and generally lower tax rate for capital gains as opposed to dividend, generally counted as taxable income. regardless, Nokia should not pay dividend or shares repurchase at this point as management contends return on its operations is greater than its capital cost."

Nok has been holding 6 which is good. If it can get past 8 it will help leave behind the remnants of the meme surge last Feb. Once it hits double digits it will open up NOK to a whole universe of institutional investors which will help absorb the large share float. How about some share buy backs to help to process along?

"Even though no movement on the Union Wireless contract, my uneducated surmise is this first contract coming just as the infrastructure deal is nearing completion is critically important. Support across party lines that extension of access to rural areas will be targetted for a substantial portion of the billions of infrastructure dollars.

Seems to me by conjecture at least that this could be very significant. Smarter people than me with information about the possible size of the full national project should share their opinions."

"THE RIGHT 5G STRATEGY WITH HELP FROM DIGITAL TWINS. Nokia has adopted a novel approach by creating a digital replica of the network, also known as a digital twin. Digital twin and data monitoring systems and algorithms can visualize ‘what if’ scenarios to design and optimize end-to-end network performance. From the RAN to the Core before the actual physical implementation. This technique is extremely useful for a deep analysis of the network and to find coverage gaps and revenue leakage by using analysis of traffic dynamics. For a European CSP, employing a digital twin, Nokia’s offer provides for 44 percent higher revenue than the traditional method. Digital twin-based analytics can be used to create digital design and investigate the future scalability of the network with the help of propriety tools which makes it possible to digitally model 5G-specific use cases. It can also analyze the selection of optimum beam sets in a 3D recreated environment. For a customer based in North America, Nokia’s design provided for 30 percent lower TCO than its own design baseline. https://www.nokia.com/blog/the-right-5g-strategy-with-help-from-digital-twins/"
