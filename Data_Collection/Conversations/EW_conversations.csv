EW is rising to $90 before end of the month!! I’m all in with my $3MM on this. Their revenue is increasing in Europe and other segments for certain products. Keeping long term but Q2 is going to be big.
"This is a hidden gem. My huge mistake was when I bought the shares at $99, I didn't buy much but that's ok. A profit no matter how small, is still a profit! Congrats fellow longs!"
Pleased to see the settling of the longstanding Abbott v. Edwards transcatheter mitral valve lawsuit. As you can imagine if you are already using the Edwards Sapien aortic valve system it is an easy transition to add the PASCAL mitral repair device to your toolkit for most cathlabs and ORs.
Awesome stock. Awesome products
Record date and ex date was May 8 for the three for one split. When will stock start trading at post split price?

"Bought 350 shares $80 and now 1,050 shares $68 and holding -This will be along term winner ..."
Latest heart valve just approved by China today. Huge market opened up.
Two words: EARLY TAVR
Planning to buy calls on EW and ILMN. Will they beat earnings and guide higher is a big question in this tricky market. Also will market get excited and provide a bump in stock prices?
"Proxy statement wants increase in shares to effect a 3:1 stock split. Is this a good idea? I know it should not make any difference, but not many companies are splitting their shares today. Any opinions appreciated."
We got a winner. Ding Ding Ding!
"Is this the move some of us have been waiting for or are the markets still to choppy? Quick story: I bought in around $68 with more ammo available but never used any, just a couple weeks ago. It has floated around these prices for a bit and I was waiting for it to make a move. I missed the daily move upwards but this seems like big news for a company that is very well managed. I want to add more shares but I would also like to know the sentiment of the long positions. Is the China and settlement news as big as I hope?"
"Only 6 months to the release of the culmination of the TAVR trials EARLY TAVR which studies aortic valve replacement percutaneously in patients who have no symptoms i.e no fainting, chest pain or congestive heart failure. Looking at what happened with PARTNER I: 11$ - 16$ (Oct 2010), PARTNER II: 19 - 38 dollars (Apr 2016), and most recently PARTNER III (detailed below in the conversations). EARLY TAVR's release is the last chance investors may get to see a meteoric jump in EW. While growth and profits will continue - it would be wise not to miss this catalyst in December 2021. Good luck."
Stock usually drops after earning and starts to rise within a week - will be in the 170-180 range by the end of the year.One of the great medical innovative companies
"EW is always expensive. When I first looked at it in 2013, the share then was at $64 while earning barely hit $2/share. Fast forward to today in 2020, after the 1:3 split last week, the share is back to about the same level ($68-$70) while earning per share comes in around $2/share or less. This time I decided to jump in with both feet today and probably too soon. Will hold on to my shares and check back in 2023 to see if I get a positive return."
"Yahoo does not list a 3/1 split, but I'm pretty sure EW had one recently. Maybe Yahoo just never got around to it? Anybody know for sure?"
No major increase in the stock price in the last 6 months. Any possible reasons?
"EW rocks , this Irvine company facilities are amazing . They also have an incredible staff with a conservative CEO. "
"This is the type of stock you hold for the long term...it goes up slowly but surely. I have already made a 1,700% profit from this stock! "
I suspect the recent run up in the stock is due to the upcoming release of PARTNER III data for aortic valve replacement in low risk patients. This will increase the patient pool for aortic valve replacement by several fold and render conventional read - surgical AVR all but obsolete. which would you pick 4 week recovery or 4 day recovery. This is underappreciated by the retail investor but well known by the institutional investors. Good luck
"CONGRATS TO EW LONGS SCOOP UP VIVO AND NBRV BEFORE THE MM'S LAUNCH THEM HRTX UPGRADES COMINGfLU VIRUS SPECIALTY STOCKS TAKING ACTION, LOOK AT THE CALLS.Flu virus specialty niche stocks like VIVO AND NBRV SHOULD BE SKYROCKETING.Place limit orders to buy at open this small list of biotechs that sold off on light voume yesterday.

"For anyone watching, big money is dropping into EW right now. Get in as it will be up big in after-hours following earnings."
"This is not only a potential persistent winner.....300 soon, but makes near dying patients a quick fix.I have seen so many of them"
"1 year to the release preliminary data from EARLY TAVR. Expanding the iceberg of aortic stenosis to the largest tier, the asymptomatic patient. https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03042104"
"Just saw live TAVR procedure on national TV ""The Doctors"" with play by play from the surgeons real time. Amazing procedure done in the Cath Lab with a patient that was awake and talking with the Docs. Just wish my father had done this back in '10...might have saved him from the complications. The TAVR device used might not have been EW, maybe MDT but regardless I'm a LT Hold on this life saving technology and whatever bite out of earnings an investment in R&D and Clinical Trials cost EW its worth it for this life giving technology."
"Just reading about the EARLY TAVR study sponsored by EW. They are taking 1100 patients with no symptoms like chest pressure, shortness of breath or fainting and putting TAVR - Edwards Sapien 3 in. The study completes in Dec. 2021 at just over the year mark. If the results are positive there is an ocean of patients who will immediately be eligible for TAVR. That would be a bonanza for all TAVI companies. In a way this is a technology story as much as a healthcare play."
"Hey guys I work in healthcare and was excited to use the cardiac monitoring system they have. So I looked at the stock. Great innovated product that gives live results, improving patient intervention when needed."
Medical procedures will now increase as hospital are back in post pandemic business.
"I work in the heart surgery business now for 26 years, involved with 4000 procedures , and I can tell you I bought $400,000 worth of this stock. Of course, hope I'm not wrong right? It takes a long time to get a valve to market, and the Edwards Sapien TAVR valve has superb market share and results. We did 15, then 50 and then 150 last year. Patients are learning about it , and that's what Mick Jagger got. I have great confidence in this stock, and also Medtronic, another holding. I bought in EW at 190, and again at 230. I don't think in 5 years I'll be doing Aortic Valve Replacements, just repairs or combination procedures if the heart is already going to be exposed. Also, the newer coatings on all valves are so much improved from the 80's and 90's one can expect a valve to last your lifetime. EW is also a really good company with lots of other product lines. I feel the same way as I did about Intuitive Surgical."
Edwards Lifesciences is down 5.19% to 110.05
"I've dedicated about 5% of my portfolio to EW for several years and wish I'd have increased that, no doubt, but the high P/E held me back. Help me out folks; Can this company protect its patent or proprietary advantage moving forward? It seems counterintuitive to pay triple my original price but this thing seems to only gain momentum and market share. Thanks."
"Short and long term one of the great stocks in the health care industry.I still believe it will be taken out by a big pharma - ? JNJWill easily break 200 in the next weeksAny drop in price , I will buy more shares"
What Pugsy isn’t telling you: Recent insider sales are from exercising low-priced gifted stock options. It ISN’T selling due to a lack of faith in this excellent and highly profitable company.
How many of you have been to the Edward’s Corperate co? They have a soccer field in the center of the building . Plus they are remodeling this building to be state of the art facilities.
Looks like this is the blow off today...so we should see reversal yet this week. The key areas of On Balance Volume looked bad today so we shall see if tomorrow follows on but I suspect we see the end of this drop this week and a moderate reversal of price. Boolean
"Just got in for 350 shares! Let's see in about 6-12 months! I only learned about this stock just recently, oh well."
I follow heart related stocks and Edwards is a leader
"It does this sometimes before moving another leg higher. Company is incredibly respected and successful. Lol, I won’t be selling this gem anytime soon."
"Amazing how ""informed"" commenters are not after a stock split. So much about market share efficiency...."
