The analogy of getting an upgrade and than the stock goes up is not upholding here because it’s price is right
check insider.com......officers been selling...
"Is this the move some of us have been waiting for or are the markets still to choppy? Quick story: I bought in around $68 with more ammo available but never used any, just a couple weeks ago. It has floated around these prices for a bit and I was waiting for it to make a move. I missed the daily move upwards but this seems like big news for a company that is very well managed. I want to add more shares but I would also like to know the sentiment of the long positions. Is the China and settlement news as big as I hope?"
Lots of insider selling the last few weeks.
What Pugsy isn’t telling you: Recent insider sales are from exercising low-priced gifted stock options. It ISN’T selling due to a lack of faith in this excellent and highly profitable company.
Trades at 35x earnings with 11% revenue growth. See you at $140
Very positive on this stock. My cost basis is $87 a share. I think it still has plenty of room to run from here. I sold ABMD and rotated more shares into EW. This stock is going places.
Let’s move! Start this engine !
good entry point?
"I cant remember after earnings this stock reacting like this and their have been many earnings beats and good reports, usually there is some profit taking. Very good sign, great company and a part of the solution in health care. I have owned it since the 60's. Although it doesn't matter, we may get a split, there has been 2 since 2010"
CEO selling stocks $5M a month....why buy?
ROTATION Rotation Rotation!
Something is up. High volume down day when markets up big.
"Ok, so not down is good. Please hold. Please"
Why is it going down?
Any more rumors of a J and J takeover?
coments on cnbc miss the point ENTIRELY!
Great stock!
"This is a hidden gem. My huge mistake was when I bought the shares at $99, I didn't buy much but that's ok. A profit no matter how small, is still a profit! Congrats fellow longs!"
$100 on earnings call
Shouldn't adoption of the new heart valve increase sales?
"Word from my Cardiac doc contacts over the last couple of weeks is that Edwards is buying Shockwave, have you heard this?"
"Proxy statement wants increase in shares to effect a 3:1 stock split. Is this a good idea? I know it should not make any difference, but not many companies are splitting their shares today. Any opinions appreciated."
bought at $45 dad your the greatest
Are they going to split the stock anytime soon
Pleased to see the settling of the longstanding Abbott v. Edwards transcatheter mitral valve lawsuit. As you can imagine if you are already using the Edwards Sapien aortic valve system it is an easy transition to add the PASCAL mitral repair device to your toolkit for most cathlabs and ORs.
Medical procedures will now increase as hospital are back in post pandemic business.
COAPT study results.....looking good for EW to overtake ABT
I heard rumors big pharma is talks with EW for potential acquisition. I heard offer is 93.60 per share of EW.
"It does this sometimes before moving another leg higher. Company is incredibly respected and successful. Lol, I won’t be selling this gem anytime soon."
European approval for the low risk indication today!! Just as good as FDA. This is great news.
This company will be acquired at 200
This company is a machine.
"1 year to the release preliminary data from EARLY TAVR. Expanding the iceberg of aortic stenosis to the largest tier, the asymptomatic patient. https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03042104"
This company has the definite winner with respect to TAVR/TAVI technology. With the aging population and the single day treatment of what was once a 4 day inpatient stay and 6 week recovery for healing of the sternotomy the stock has amazing potential.
Edwards Lifesciences (EW) Lower as Jefferies Notes Weak December Data
how we doing here with earnings coming?
Come on $70 - I wanna double up!!!
split would be great
"Bought 350 shares $80 and now 1,050 shares $68 and holding -This will be along term winner ..."
"Blowout earnings, 100 soon"
"OK, I'll bite. I read the transcript twice and I do not see what the problem is that has driven the stock down $16 since earnings were released. This is ridiculous. All guidance we reiterated or even noted to be at the top end of the range. And they beat by $.02 not missed by $.02 if you take that tax benefit change from the level assumed in guidance into account. Perhaps I missed something that sellers are fixated on. What would that be? $100???"
"Amazing how ""informed"" commenters are not after a stock split. So much about market share efficiency...."
"Just listened to the EW conference call, management mentioned several times that there are a number of ""tailwinds"" going into next year that will drive their sales/eps growth and mentioned they expects margins to improve and costs to go down. They have $1.2 Billion overseas that they can not currently use for buybacks but are trying to figure out a way to do that. They will be buying back stock and reducing share count when the opportunity presents itself(maybe tomorrow?) and expect continued strong growth as more trial data comes out in transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in medium to lower risk populations. The company will present some innovative new products that they will expect will drive growth and new opportunities at their Analyst Day in December. They reiterated guidance and said everything is on track. It seems like a no brainer that EW will continue to grow strongly as TAVR replaces open heart surgery, which is more expensive, riskier, and has much greater recovery time. What do you think patients would prefer?? To get their chest sawed in half or to have a small incision and no actual surgery with EW's device?? They will pick TAVR EVERY single time and EW is the dominant player in the field"
Can anyone comment on the effect of the opening the Chinese market to the valve. Are the Chinese people keen on cardiac surgery or is it a risk averse population?
"I work in the heart surgery business now for 26 years, involved with 4000 procedures , and I can tell you I bought $400,000 worth of this stock. Of course, hope I'm not wrong right? It takes a long time to get a valve to market, and the Edwards Sapien TAVR valve has superb market share and results. We did 15, then 50 and then 150 last year. Patients are learning about it , and that's what Mick Jagger got. I have great confidence in this stock, and also Medtronic, another holding. I bought in EW at 190, and again at 230. I don't think in 5 years I'll be doing Aortic Valve Replacements, just repairs or combination procedures if the heart is already going to be exposed. Also, the newer coatings on all valves are so much improved from the 80's and 90's one can expect a valve to last your lifetime. EW is also a really good company with lots of other product lines. I feel the same way as I did about Intuitive Surgical."
Tiara technology for the transcatheter treatment of mitral valve disease
One would be crazy to sell this stock today because the fact that ALL medical supply companies are hurting because of COVID-19 ...EW will be @90 in no time .
Is this a buying opportunity? Down on pretty heavy volume.Help me ! lol
How many of you have been to the Edward’s Corperate co? They have a soccer field in the center of the building . Plus they are remodeling this building to be state of the art facilities.
What in the world is wrong with this stock. I've been a holder since day one and never seen a bloodbath like this. There must be something going on that we are unaware of.
Another all time high. Gotta love it. Long and strong for 5+ years.
Any opinions on the next few years regarding earnings growth? Are the company’s products the best?
"Just got in for 350 shares! Let's see in about 6-12 months! I only learned about this stock just recently, oh well."
Anyone know stock split 3 for 1 was at what price?
"For anyone watching, big money is dropping into EW right now. Get in as it will be up big in after-hours following earnings."
"Bogus negative comments from this dumb analyst who maintains ""Outperform"" rating with $285 target price.Go figure !"
Just keep buying buying buying...
"If not for this conversation string, I’d have no idea what EW is doing. Thank you!"
What happened? Zack's initiate a buy??
Anybody have any comforting words for this earnings disaster?
Marko. Cash on hand equal to company debt level. Time to adopt a dividend policy instead of stock buybacks at way over book value.
kinda did the same slide last year around this time
No studies on heart valve damage from vaccines or Covid 19 infection?
"OmG, had a cardiac moment before I realized the split."
products are great. stock is !
Think this was a deliberate TAKEDOWN.
We got a winner. Ding Ding Ding!
"Only 6 months to the release of the culmination of the TAVR trials EARLY TAVR which studies aortic valve replacement percutaneously in patients who have no symptoms i.e no fainting, chest pain or congestive heart failure. Looking at what happened with PARTNER I: 11$ - 16$ (Oct 2010), PARTNER II: 19 - 38 dollars (Apr 2016), and most recently PARTNER III (detailed below in the conversations). EARLY TAVR's release is the last chance investors may get to see a meteoric jump in EW. While growth and profits will continue - it would be wise not to miss this catalyst in December 2021. Good luck."
don't believe it is because of the settlement with Boston Scientific.
C'mon man! Why is this stock down? This is a fundamentally sound company.
Why does this stock have violent down drafts seems like every day for the last 2 months
"What a great company. Relatively off the radar just keeps knocking it out of the park. Quality management, great industry. Need a few more of these, LOL"
Planning to buy calls on EW and ILMN. Will they beat earnings and guide higher is a big question in this tricky market. Also will market get excited and provide a bump in stock prices?
Baby boomers are going to use a lot of EW heart valves now and in the future. This is a growth business.
No idea when said approval from FDA will occur - here are the past approvals.Reminder PARTNER 1 - published June 2011 approved June 2012 - indication for high risk patientsReminder - PARTNER 2 - published Apr. 2016 - Approved Aug 2016 - indication for intermediate risk patients https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-expanded-indication-two-transcatheter-heart-valves-patients-intermediate-risk-death-or
"Population is getting older,Aortic valve narrowing is on rise so is the use of TAVR.Hospitals rushing to start structural programs Reminds me ISRg like trend .so far EW has the best product but MDT and BSX May get Their share as well.Best option is some one buys EW, perhaps BSx"
Crazy market to sell off healthcare stocks during a healthcare crisis... Simply algorithmic selling in the casino market. This too shall pass
Latest heart valve just approved by China today. Huge market opened up.
Bought more AH last night for 123.50. Knew it had been way oversold. Full year guidance was maintained. What we needed on the conf. call was had a little mis-step on Q! and will be made-up in Q2 & Q3.
sell sell sell sell before it dives into 170s
Interesting article but Market Realist. Question is who gives a ?

No major increase in the stock price in the last 6 months. Any possible reasons?
Stock usually drops after earning and starts to rise within a week - will be in the 170-180 range by the end of the year.One of the great medical innovative companies
"I think FDA approval of TAVI for low risk aortic stenosis patients will see a major breakout for the stock. With respect to pipeline, while I see a tricuspid and mitral valve intervention to be a significant space there are many competing technologies. For TAVI Edwards has the leading valve and a huge market for years to come as the population ages into these valves."
Have been watching EW but have not yet pulled the trigger on buying some shares. Any long term holders have any advice on a good entry point? Thanks in advance.
"Anyone in the know, how earnings shaping up for tomorrow?"
How is this in the red? Great earnings and we're down?
Josh on CNBC just put out a strong buy.
We need a buy back
What a great day and well deserved!
In since $35.00....thanks Mom!!! :)
puts did great here
I think that 138 will be a good floor.
I follow heart related stocks and Edwards is a leader
"EW rocks , this Irvine company facilities are amazing . They also have an incredible staff with a conservative CEO. "
earnings in one day. positive article by Zack's very worrisome; they get it right 25%?
Awesome stock. Awesome products
"Just reading about the EARLY TAVR study sponsored by EW. They are taking 1100 patients with no symptoms like chest pressure, shortness of breath or fainting and putting TAVR - Edwards Sapien 3 in. The study completes in Dec. 2021 at just over the year mark. If the results are positive there is an ocean of patients who will immediately be eligible for TAVR. That would be a bonanza for all TAVI companies. In a way this is a technology story as much as a healthcare play."
Just for everyone's information PARTNER III mentioned in the conversations will be reported at ACC 2018 - Sunday as a late breaking trial. (full disclosure - am long this stock). IT IS GOING TO BLOW!
Does anyone know when we will start noticing the effects of the share buyback on the price?
"Hey guys I work in healthcare and was excited to use the cardiac monitoring system they have. So I looked at the stock. Great innovated product that gives live results, improving patient intervention when needed."
$EW will reveal findings from three late-breaking clinical trials. Here is the link for more info http://crweworld.com/article/news-provided-by-pr-newswire/303489/edwards-announces-key-events-for-europcr-2018
"what is wrong with this stock, its been going down for several days. i have not seen any negative news for weeks"
I suspect the recent run up in the stock is due to the upcoming release of PARTNER III data for aortic valve replacement in low risk patients. This will increase the patient pool for aortic valve replacement by several fold and render conventional read - surgical AVR all but obsolete. which would you pick 4 week recovery or 4 day recovery. This is underappreciated by the retail investor but well known by the institutional investors. Good luck
"Edwards Lifesciences (EW) PT Lowered to $85 at Stifel, After 3-to-1 Stock Split"
$3.00 + drop today.....Now what???
Split time !!
"EW up 7% in 2 days, while BSX down 9%... hurray to EW for the innovative Sapien TAVR ! (and future TMVR)"
Edwards Lifesciences is up 4.99% to 94.10
If you not following EW results being shared the big ACC Mtg then you are not an investor just a trader. American College of Cardiology is a big deal to all FACCs. If you don't know what this means then you don't know about cardiology.
"Wow,got outta here just in time.Prolly stay Bellow 130all summer"
Over 30x forward EPS with 12% revenue growth? Free cash flow yield of only 1.8%. This stock is egregiously overvalued.
"As stated in previous post - stock drops after earnings, then rises.Great company....high likelihood to be taken over....P"
"This is not only a potential persistent winner.....300 soon, but makes near dying patients a quick fix.I have seen so many of them"
EW reached a new All Time High at 126.98
"I've dedicated about 5% of my portfolio to EW for several years and wish I'd have increased that, no doubt, but the high P/E held me back. Help me out folks; Can this company protect its patent or proprietary advantage moving forward? It seems counterintuitive to pay triple my original price but this thing seems to only gain momentum and market share. Thanks."
This stock is a gold mine just like BAC. Hold these stocks over the next 5 years and you won't need to do any remortgaging.
Is someone else coming in to the market with a new valve?
$144.00 after earnings tomorrow
Add some Heron therapeutics HRTX and Dinali DNLI to your portfolio. Both have a tendency to get stronger all day.infi ptla zm vray teva nice also.
Good time to buyWill be at 100 by the end of the year
"Whats with the the $7.50 drop after hours, can't find any news, just temporary?"
"Their was an article about them being an acquisition target for JNJ, that has to be something, this is unusual activity"
$EW is cut to SELL
"reacting to MDT slight missEW is oversold, great time for buyouts to happen in this industry"
Looks like this is the blow off today...so we should see reversal yet this week. The key areas of On Balance Volume looked bad today so we shall see if tomorrow follows on but I suspect we see the end of this drop this week and a moderate reversal of price. Boolean
Is EW on the chopping block to be acquired.￼￼
"Short and long term one of the great stocks in the health care industry.I still believe it will be taken out by a big pharma - ? JNJWill easily break 200 in the next weeksAny drop in price , I will buy more shares"
With Uncle Bernie EVERYONE loses!
BIG earnings TOMORROW!!
This company is one of the best in the business. I loaded up today. Satnam is a fool. I work in a heart hospital and EW valves are used all the time. Best buy on the market.ROCK
Back to 120.00
Temporary regression. Not to worry. Boolean
EW is up 5.34% to 133.76
Any ideas why this stock is down day after day.
Stocks always fall after a stock splt. How low do you think we go before its become a good buying oppertunity? $65?
"EW will be 500 in next 6 months...no comparison, escalating demand, aging population"
see previous note -Stock drops after earnings - then starts to rise.Great company.I still believe there is a possibility that J&J will buy the company - more logical that taking BSX.
Buying time
My guess is 6 UP tomorrow.
Stock is down 9% and no one has anything recent to say.
Edwards Lifesciences is down 5.19% to 110.05
I wonder how good earnings could be
$EW Target Raised by Raymond James Financial Outperform USD 96 » USD 101 Target Raised by Wells Fargo Equal Weight USD 87 » USD 93 Maintains Piper Sandler Overweight USD 97 » USD 105 Maintains Morgan Stanley Overweight USD 99 » USD 108 Target Raised by Canaccord Genuity Buy USD 94 » USD 103
"No stopping EW, EPS simply going thru the roof, forward statements hon-stoppable ,maybe even buy a small cash rich biotech or two on the way to $500, hopefully nobody doesn't step up and buy them, we shareholders need EW and mgmt., to be left alone"
"93,5 dollars after split"
interest here growing..liking this business and the beta
This sure has turned into a dog.
EW getting killed today on a BEAT AND RAISE?? Imagine if they missed? market manipulation is amazing here. The company is in the sweet spot of emergency health care for MILLIONS of boomers for the next 20 years. I will just keep buying.
Edwards Lifesciences reached an all time high at 76.71
"Hey, YAHOO, please show me the point in the last 52 weeks that EW was $1.91? Why one should never assume your numbers are ever correct."
"Once again analysts prove how clueless most are, this is a great company"
"this will rise soon..if not this month,then wait for November,Being in this medical field, I know it is a good stock to own"
"120.00 coming,too many bots here, that is why"
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said on Monday three deaths had been reported related to Edwards Lifesciences Corp's recall of some of its heart devices.
"it's all good, keep buying and you will be a happy investor"
What happen?
"This stock is awesome...so far I have 1,400% return and will continue to go up gradually."
"Absent any substantive negative news, here go the Wall Street manipulators again......as usual, a week before what very well may be a positive earnings announcement, they pressure and dump the stock now so they can buy low tomorrow and sell next week. Where's the SEC when you need them..??"
EW is rising to $90 before end of the month!! I’m all in with my $3MM on this. Their revenue is increasing in Europe and other segments for certain products. Keeping long term but Q2 is going to be big.
"Up from here based on new product introduced, expandable stints."
"Yahoo does not list a 3/1 split, but I'm pretty sure EW had one recently. Maybe Yahoo just never got around to it? Anybody know for sure?"
"We need to go higher 250 is resistance...once we cross, volume will pick and it will sail"
However small why won't this company declare a dividend.
"EW is always expensive. When I first looked at it in 2013, the share then was at $64 while earning barely hit $2/share. Fast forward to today in 2020, after the 1:3 split last week, the share is back to about the same level ($68-$70) while earning per share comes in around $2/share or less. This time I decided to jump in with both feet today and probably too soon. Will hold on to my shares and check back in 2023 to see if I get a positive return."
Please split 3for1.
AAPL and EW. Should go higher In am ..2 positive studies reported in America college of cardiology this week end
Two words: EARLY TAVR
CEO just sold $6m...worth of stock... I like this stock but the CEO dont feel that way...so sad.
Is anyone a buyer going into earnings? GLTA
Record date and ex date was May 8 for the three for one split. When will stock start trading at post split price?
EW is forming a handle and is ready to break out...
"The My Animo stock portfolio is adding Edwards Lifesciences Corp! With an annualized 54% return so far in 2021, I'm hoping EW follows in the footsteps of their other picks. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ethlsm86kO0"
"Just saw live TAVR procedure on national TV ""The Doctors"" with play by play from the surgeons real time. Amazing procedure done in the Cath Lab with a patient that was awake and talking with the Docs. Just wish my father had done this back in '10...might have saved him from the complications. The TAVR device used might not have been EW, maybe MDT but regardless I'm a LT Hold on this life saving technology and whatever bite out of earnings an investment in R&D and Clinical Trials cost EW its worth it for this life giving technology."
"This is the type of stock you hold for the long term...it goes up slowly but surely. I have already made a 1,700% profit from this stock! "
"whole world stock are up to day ,from china to turkey but this one is down.....even the gold is up ....this baffles my mind.."
Zero heart procedures being scheduled. ICU beds are full of covid patients.
What is wrong with EW. It is down day after day.
