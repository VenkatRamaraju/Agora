Planning to buy calls on EW and ILMN. Will they beat earnings and guide higher is a big question in this tricky market. Also will market get excited and provide a bump in stock prices?
"Boston delaying US launch of Lotus Aortic Valve system until sometime in 2018... ""design and manufacturing issues that affect product quality"". Based on less short-term TAVR competition, EW should be good for a 20% pop in valuation. (BTW- the BS bloggers on this thread are fearmongers)"

Interesting article but Market Realist. Question is who gives a ?
Up $17/share last earnings announcement
EW reached an all time high at 218.08
I heard rumors big pharma is talks with EW for potential acquisition. I heard offer is 93.60 per share of EW.

SANP also taking off... Wake up folks lets make some Coin... Bitcoin.. that is....
"The My Animo stock portfolio is adding Edwards Lifesciences Corp! With an annualized 54% return so far in 2021, I'm hoping EW follows in the footsteps of their other picks. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ethlsm86kO0"
Looks like this is the blow off today...so we should see reversal yet this week. The key areas of On Balance Volume looked bad today so we shall see if tomorrow follows on but I suspect we see the end of this drop this week and a moderate reversal of price. Boolean
Does anyone know when we will start noticing the effects of the share buyback on the price?
"Yahoo does not list a 3/1 split, but I'm pretty sure EW had one recently. Maybe Yahoo just never got around to it? Anybody know for sure?"

"I work in the heart surgery business now for 26 years, involved with 4000 procedures , and I can tell you I bought $400,000 worth of this stock. Of course, hope I'm not wrong right? It takes a long time to get a valve to market, and the Edwards Sapien TAVR valve has superb market share and results. We did 15, then 50 and then 150 last year. Patients are learning about it , and that's what Mick Jagger got. I have great confidence in this stock, and also Medtronic, another holding. I bought in EW at 190, and again at 230. I don't think in 5 years I'll be doing Aortic Valve Replacements, just repairs or combination procedures if the heart is already going to be exposed. Also, the newer coatings on all valves are so much improved from the 80's and 90's one can expect a valve to last your lifetime. EW is also a really good company with lots of other product lines. I feel the same way as I did about Intuitive Surgical."
Pleased to see the settling of the longstanding Abbott v. Edwards transcatheter mitral valve lawsuit. As you can imagine if you are already using the Edwards Sapien aortic valve system it is an easy transition to add the PASCAL mitral repair device to your toolkit for most cathlabs and ORs.

"I cant remember after earnings this stock reacting like this and their have been many earnings beats and good reports, usually there is some profit taking. Very good sign, great company and a part of the solution in health care. I have owned it since the 60's. Although it doesn't matter, we may get a split, there has been 2 since 2010"

"Anyone in the know, how earnings shaping up for tomorrow?"
I can't find any news for this decline. Anyone know what's up?
This stock is acting crazy. Best buy in the market. I do not understand why this is not flying. I have been picking losers lately and am sick of it. My only saving grace is CMG which I bought very cheap. Who would have thought that?ROCK
One would be crazy to sell this stock today because the fact that ALL medical supply companies are hurting because of COVID-19 ...EW will be @90 in no time .
don't believe it is because of the settlement with Boston Scientific.

What Pugsy isn’t telling you: Recent insider sales are from exercising low-priced gifted stock options. It ISN’T selling due to a lack of faith in this excellent and highly profitable company.
perhaps todays losses are a result of ABT purchasing Cephea Technologies?any thoughts?

Somebody is selling pretty big.
Is anyone a buyer going into earnings? GLTA
"Oversold and great company, watch for big reflex rally back up"
see previous note -Stock drops after earnings - then starts to rise.Great company.I still believe there is a possibility that J&J will buy the company - more logical that taking BSX.
However small why won't this company declare a dividend.
Will this stock ever propose a dividend
"Is this the move some of us have been waiting for or are the markets still to choppy? Quick story: I bought in around $68 with more ammo available but never used any, just a couple weeks ago. It has floated around these prices for a bit and I was waiting for it to make a move. I missed the daily move upwards but this seems like big news for a company that is very well managed. I want to add more shares but I would also like to know the sentiment of the long positions. Is the China and settlement news as big as I hope?"
EW is down 4.98% to $140.92

My guess is 6 UP tomorrow.
"Absent any substantive negative news, here go the Wall Street manipulators again......as usual, a week before what very well may be a positive earnings announcement, they pressure and dump the stock now so they can buy low tomorrow and sell next week. Where's the SEC when you need them..??"
Why is it down so much? I can't find any news.
I suspect the recent run up in the stock is due to the upcoming release of PARTNER III data for aortic valve replacement in low risk patients. This will increase the patient pool for aortic valve replacement by several fold and render conventional read - surgical AVR all but obsolete. which would you pick 4 week recovery or 4 day recovery. This is underappreciated by the retail investor but well known by the institutional investors. Good luck

"I've dedicated about 5% of my portfolio to EW for several years and wish I'd have increased that, no doubt, but the high P/E held me back. Help me out folks; Can this company protect its patent or proprietary advantage moving forward? It seems counterintuitive to pay triple my original price but this thing seems to only gain momentum and market share. Thanks."
"Ok, so not down is good. Please hold. Please"
EW reached an all time high at 194.48
What a monster. Had it @ 70 sold @ par. Wors investment error of the last decade. Too late to get back in now. Good job longs

it looks like Iran is going to attack the trans catheter from EW. Yahoo finance looking for clues .....
how we doing here with earnings coming?
"Bots are here Uh Oh,"
"Once again the yahoos at Yahoo remain asleep at the switch regarding important news updates......Here's a snippet from a BofA/Merrill Lynch report issued yesterday regarding restart of EW's Mitral study:.....Mitral update at CRTWe are attending the CRT conference in Washington DC this weekend. On Sunday, EW’s lead investigators provided a surprisingly positive update on EW’s CardiAQ program by announcing that EW will restart enrollment in its mitral replacement trials in Q2. Recall that it was only a few weeks ago on EW’s Q4 call that EW announced that these same trials had been paused. This suggests that 2018 approval in Europe remains possible if all goes well with the studies. We think the delay in the program was a major reason why EW sold off following the Q4 call.The presentation slide from one of EW’s lead investigators updating the CRT attendees on the status of EW‘s CardiAQ mitral early feasibility studies stated: “brief pause in case scheduling while key clinical learnings were being implemented, but full patient screening is now continuing in anticipation of Q2 cases.” The clear message from CRT was that the issue that caused the pause that EW announced on its Q4 earnings call has been resolved. Comments from the podium at CRT suggest the issue had to do with how the centers were being trained. EW’s 10-K on Friday also provided an update on the status of CardiAQ. The 10-K language read “the Company disclosed in early February 2017 that it had voluntarily paused enrollment in its clinical trials for the Edwards- CardiAQ valve to perform further design validation testing on a feature of the valve.This testing has been completed and, in collaboration with clinical investigators, the Company has decided to resume screening patients for enrollment in its clinical trials.” Cases will resume in Q2, which suggests 2018 approval in Europe remains a possibility. The other key message from CRT on EW’s CardiAQ mitral technology was that improvements to the size and deliverability of the device are happening now and should be available soon in Europe. This is key as the current system remains technically challenging, especially with the TS approach."

"With this earning, it is going to climb back to its old high soon if market does not correct."

3 more days to hit 220 target.
"Only 6 months to the release of the culmination of the TAVR trials EARLY TAVR which studies aortic valve replacement percutaneously in patients who have no symptoms i.e no fainting, chest pain or congestive heart failure. Looking at what happened with PARTNER I: 11$ - 16$ (Oct 2010), PARTNER II: 19 - 38 dollars (Apr 2016), and most recently PARTNER III (detailed below in the conversations). EARLY TAVR's release is the last chance investors may get to see a meteoric jump in EW. While growth and profits will continue - it would be wise not to miss this catalyst in December 2021. Good luck."
Very positive on this stock. My cost basis is $87 a share. I think it still has plenty of room to run from here. I sold ABMD and rotated more shares into EW. This stock is going places.
Huh?? Why is it up???
What in the world is wrong with this stock. I've been a holder since day one and never seen a bloodbath like this. There must be something going on that we are unaware of.
TOO Overvalued EW will not go any higher. can someone explain why EW will move further?

Any opinions on the next few years regarding earnings growth? Are the company’s products the best?

What is wrong with EW. It is down day after day.
Edwards Lifesciences is down 5.95% to 185.62
CEO just sold $6m...worth of stock... I like this stock but the CEO dont feel that way...so sad.
EW is rising to $90 before end of the month!! I’m all in with my $3MM on this. Their revenue is increasing in Europe and other segments for certain products. Keeping long term but Q2 is going to be big.
i've made a little money on it should I sell now or hold for more?
"EW is always expensive. When I first looked at it in 2013, the share then was at $64 while earning barely hit $2/share. Fast forward to today in 2020, after the 1:3 split last week, the share is back to about the same level ($68-$70) while earning per share comes in around $2/share or less. This time I decided to jump in with both feet today and probably too soon. Will hold on to my shares and check back in 2023 to see if I get a positive return."
"It does this sometimes before moving another leg higher. Company is incredibly respected and successful. Lol, I won’t be selling this gem anytime soon."
"EW up 7% in 2 days, while BSX down 9%... hurray to EW for the innovative Sapien TAVR ! (and future TMVR)"
Going down tomorrow. Numbers miss coming.
Anybody have any comforting words for this earnings disaster?

What happened? Zack's initiate a buy??
"Just listened to the EW conference call, management mentioned several times that there are a number of ""tailwinds"" going into next year that will drive their sales/eps growth and mentioned they expects margins to improve and costs to go down. They have $1.2 Billion overseas that they can not currently use for buybacks but are trying to figure out a way to do that. They will be buying back stock and reducing share count when the opportunity presents itself(maybe tomorrow?) and expect continued strong growth as more trial data comes out in transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in medium to lower risk populations. The company will present some innovative new products that they will expect will drive growth and new opportunities at their Analyst Day in December. They reiterated guidance and said everything is on track. It seems like a no brainer that EW will continue to grow strongly as TAVR replaces open heart surgery, which is more expensive, riskier, and has much greater recovery time. What do you think patients would prefer?? To get their chest sawed in half or to have a small incision and no actual surgery with EW's device?? They will pick TAVR EVERY single time and EW is the dominant player in the field"
Add some Heron therapeutics HRTX and Dinali DNLI to your portfolio. Both have a tendency to get stronger all day.infi ptla zm vray teva nice also.

"OK, I'll bite. I read the transcript twice and I do not see what the problem is that has driven the stock down $16 since earnings were released. This is ridiculous. All guidance we reiterated or even noted to be at the top end of the range. And they beat by $.02 not missed by $.02 if you take that tax benefit change from the level assumed in guidance into account. Perhaps I missed something that sellers are fixated on. What would that be? $100???"

"Not rebounding like I had hoped. Made several runs at it. I managed to 4x my position at various lows yesterday and today and essentially got out near breakeven. Not my favorite exit strategy, but it's worked more often than it has not.

"On the earnings call, they said they ""ceded' market share in EU. The 'ceded' may have been taken that they gave it up and walked away, causing analysts to become concerned. May have been better to not use that word and discuss strategies to offset aggressive pri.ce cutting by MDT, BSI, etc.,...EW is a good company and they will prevail...just may take some time"
"Just reading about the EARLY TAVR study sponsored by EW. They are taking 1100 patients with no symptoms like chest pressure, shortness of breath or fainting and putting TAVR - Edwards Sapien 3 in. The study completes in Dec. 2021 at just over the year mark. If the results are positive there is an ocean of patients who will immediately be eligible for TAVR. That would be a bonanza for all TAVI companies. In a way this is a technology story as much as a healthcare play."

"I think FDA approval of TAVI for low risk aortic stenosis patients will see a major breakout for the stock. With respect to pipeline, while I see a tricuspid and mitral valve intervention to be a significant space there are many competing technologies. For TAVI Edwards has the leading valve and a huge market for years to come as the population ages into these valves."
Anyone know stock split 3 for 1 was at what price?

"Just saw live TAVR procedure on national TV ""The Doctors"" with play by play from the surgeons real time. Amazing procedure done in the Cath Lab with a patient that was awake and talking with the Docs. Just wish my father had done this back in '10...might have saved him from the complications. The TAVR device used might not have been EW, maybe MDT but regardless I'm a LT Hold on this life saving technology and whatever bite out of earnings an investment in R&D and Clinical Trials cost EW its worth it for this life giving technology."
