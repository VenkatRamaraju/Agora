"What an unexpected and insane drop, buying more again..."
Could have not ask for a better close and confirmation of uptrend!First resistance taken. Lets see if in the next days we can take the other one at $7.38 and continue the uptrend towards $10 to $12 by August before they report Q2 numbers which should show some of the Amazon deal and the progress made since they got the approval without prescription. Then Q3 will be even better for it will be a whole quarter with Amazon. Onward and UpwardBlessings
Great reviews on Amazon!!! Did it got sold out??!!! It is currently unavailablehttps://www.amazon.com/Lucira-COVID-19-Single-use-Authorized-Molecular/dp/B092KGQT2Y/ref=zg_bs_393454011_3?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=70587JHGS4BVXB446H7Z
"""Of all the kits I used, Lucira was far and away my favorite. This is a laboratory-type test, with techniques similar to those used by professional labs, and you feel a little bit like a scientist using it.""Check the article in technologyreview"

"The test in Amazon continue to pile on the great reviews and how people are making great use of it. We need some good news from the company to give us a tailwind to come out of this pps range. Here is one of the many great reviews and what a great help for people this is:5.0 out of 5 stars Easy, Quick, AccurateReviewed in the United States on May 12, 2021Verified PurchaseThis test is a huge relief! Perfect for home, meetings, or event use, if you want something accurate, fast, and easy to use.No brain swab or spitting endlessly into a tube (blech)--the directions are easy to follow (basically swirl the swab in each nostril, next swirl in the test tube, and wait 10-30 minutes).When our daughter received a (false) positive result from an inexpensive antigen test, she was distraught at the thought of being sick herself and potentially infecting the rest of us. We had these tests on hand and quickly tested our entire family. In less than 30 minutes, we had the results -- we were all negative. No comparison to having to schedule another round tests while completely quarantining from her and the outside world! You can use this for kids, too.We also used this test for long awaited family visits and small events. So good to reconnect without anxiety. We even skipped masks with family when everyone had a negative test."

"Here is my best piece of advice for you; You want a better stock to make a quick buck, check out $LHDX, had a great news and run all day even after hours BUT if you are parking your money here, you need to be very very patient. You will have to wait for $CRIS to come up with the next best news. Just so you know this company haven't had any positive EPS for years!"

any idea about lhdx?
"@Kite you ask Why is it down for 2 days in a row? Profit taking??I think is profit taking. Why? Because the company has no product to sell, in their website and on Amazon and have not given us any news about what happen.This company was looking great, technical double bottom was in, got the clearance to sell without prescription and got a deal with Amazon, the stock was up trending nicely even one day it pop 40% it double from the bottom in a short period.But now the value adding catalyst of big sales for now is gone until we get news from the company. This company cannot afford to miss days without revenue and miss making their own product be known in the market. It was having great reviews on Amazon.So this could continue to sell off until we get news of why they run out of product and when it will be available again. Until then, there is no value adding catalysts for this stock to go up. And also when looking at many samall Bio/Pharma companies are all being pressure to the down side.Blessings"
Looks like I’m riding this one to bankrupt. Biggest hit on the portfolio so far.
always watch the numbers yolomommy says

"I clicked on The Dog post below. Taiwan is just one of many markets to open up to Lucira hopefully.""Taipei, June 12 (CNA) Imports of two types of COVID-19 home test kits to Taiwan have been approved, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said Saturday.Three companies that applied to import two COVID-19 home test kit products -- Swiss biotech company Roche's ""SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Self Test Nasal"" and American medical technology firm Lucira's ""Check It COVID-19 Test Kit"" -- have received approval from regulators, according to FDA official Lin Hsin-hui (林欣慧).Since companies need to gain approval before they can import the test kits, Lin said she expects it will take at least a week for the products to hit the market in Taiwan.The FDA will issue a protocol on how to conduct home testing for the public before the products become available in Taiwan, she added."""
Still overvalued imo
LHDX is down 5.00% to 35.15
"Another consideration on why there is currently no inventory. They are retooling the test kit itself, either on their own to add new features, or by request of the FDA. IR for the company has been silent on this matter and is not responding to inquiries."

"A poster stated the assumption that ""Large contract commitments on Corporate, Government or Overseas orders may consume all of the product produced"" sounds like wishful thinking to me. IF that were the rosy reason for product being Sold Out on Amazon, why hasn't the company said so? The facts are:1) about 1 week ago an astute investor reported that Lucira's covid-19 test kit had suddenly disappeared off Amazon's website2) no comment from the company to date3) I called the company and was told by the media department that the product sold out and that the word from the grapevine was that it would take 2-3 weeks to get the kits back in stock on Amazon. 4) on Friday the stock spikes more than $3 and settles @$8.50I check this board nearly every day and have seen no real pumping and zero bashing. In fact, until YOLO showed up posting activity was very low, infrequent. I don't know about Twitter or Reddit.This stock is on a roller coaster is all I can surmise. Tread lightly."

"Just finish listening to the conference. There is still 1 million test per day being done, and regarding Abbott, Lucira is a small company in comparison to this daily demand. So very little market share of that will do wonders for Lucira.They are working heavy on marketing to bring awareness to the company ""the best kept seceret"" this awareness will bring people to Amazon which is scaling nicely and also their own website through Shopify.So is simple. Marketing to increase awareness to increase salesCOVID/FLU test combine for next year, plus other potential tests as wellBut I see it very simple. This company has 2 quarters to prove that they can increase revenue in a good way. I think they will do it. And if they do, then they will have the time to increase more value as they bring different tests to market.Lets see if we can have a good green close today.Onward and UpwardBlessings"

"YOLO and others, there was high shorting on July 9th 2021-07-09 4,926,584 shares to be semi-precise. Motley Fool was also pumping the stock recently which probably means their buddies are short. Right now there are a lot of question marks about Lucira's lack of inventory, less than one month before their earnings call. I wouldn't bet against the shorts just yet."
"Given how poorly they have handled this recall (from a customer point of view), how rapidly Amazon has developed IT'S OWN at home test (which it now promotes; can't find the Lucira test at all there), and the fact that they burned $50mm in their first six months of 2012, that cash pile is about the only thing keeping their stock over $3.50 (estimates ""net cash"" they currently have.)This stock will probably see a 4 handle before it sees an 8 handle."

"YOLO if you want to average down, I think it will be better for you to wait. The small cap Bio/Pharma sector is being pressure to the down side and LHDX used to have massive tailwinds that for now have turn into massive unknown headwinds.The few of us who where here before you, we saw an oversold condition with a technical double bottom around the $4.75 area, to that technical we have a huge tailwind for sales for Q2 and Q3 that was the clearance to be sold without prescription and the deal with Amazon and the great reviews we where getting and holding the number 2 position on their site as Best Seller. That took the stock to double in a short time. And then what happen? A headwind came, no product, sold out and only news that maybe in 2 or 3 weeks they will have available. Nothing more. So with this huge unknown and a red market for Bio/Pharma, until will get clarity, and we have Q2 numbers and what happen and what they expect moving forward, this could easily be push down a little over that past support in the $4.75 area.And if that happen and we hit that low and we get clarity again, then be ready, for this stock will run 200% or more in the next uptrend for fall and winter season are coming and personal testing will increase.So hold on, be patient for a huge opportunity will present again, to go even higher than before, but we need to have clarity on those headwinds of uncertainty.Wishing you the best Blessings"

Any news ?Why this up AH ?
"My simple view after yesterday conference is that we have a clear path for an uptrend in anticipation of good Q2 numbers. Those who are short I think they will begin to cover. The positive expectation outweights the negative going into Q2. We are way oversold. So the positive here is greater than the negative and risk.The Q1 revenue was only for products sold by prescription, Then on April came the OTC EUA and the Amazon deal, So Q2 sales should bring some revenue for this indication which is much bigger and easy to increase sales that the prescription one. This is the HUGE POSITIVE compare to Q1So with this expectation going into Q2, the valuation should increase. We are currently less than 5 million EV, That´s a joke!! We are oversold technically and we have good expectations as our tailwindAs we wait and travel the road towards Q2 the company could announce some more international or local partnerships which will give a nice tailwind to the stock. ANOTHER HUGE POSITIVE.This is as they presented a reopening play, not a negative COVID is over and testing is over but a better way to test for COVID when in doubt from the comfort of your home, no more travel to certain places for testing, no more waiting. It is perfect.So technically we could be confirming the bottom here, we could easily be around $10 by the time Q2 numbers come. And if numbers are good and show more growth and potential for the coming winter FLU/COVID season, then the pps will continue to uptrend and increase in value. If they don´t, then we are heading lower, Onward and Upwards towards $10 or more by AugustBlessings"

Amazon has fda approval for at home covid 19 test... does Lucira have any other testing yet or just covid 19?

"Wow, actually going up on a spike of volume. Something cookin?"
Here we go!!! Let the squeeze begin!!!!
I heard about LHDX the other day on (http://Multistockalerts.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
Lucira is the mainstay test for fans at all warriors home games https://chasecenter.com/fan-safety-covid19-testing
"Clearly there was some disappointment with a $13.3mm loss and no visibility to profitability and this is reflected in the after hours. That combined with the CDC's announcement today takes Covid off the front burner and that was their ""big act""... now it will be a year or more for their flu text..YAWN"
"Once everyone is vaccinated, you do not need a covid-19 at home test. SELL THE STOCK NOW"
"Take a look at Amazons Best Sellers List :""Best Sellers in Clinical Diagnostic Test Kits"""
The business model of an at home test kit that requires a prescription and self-report of the result makes no sense. Sell this stock before you lose everything.
"lol and its red, honestly just have to laugh at this point"

"""Shaking out the weak hands""that`s the name of the game"
What's up with the big strong buys near the end of the session?
That stock is not for the faint of heart... but I’m a believer
Bought my tranche today. If I as a federal employee will be forced into covid tests. Well I damn sure better make money off of it.
"This has only one way to go from here and that is up!!! With the OTC authorization by the FDA and the Amazon deal, sales can only increase. Technically the stock is oversold, the gap left when the Amazon news was announce is now close and we have a solid double bottom.The EV is less than 20 millionGreat kit to have at home and if you feel any symptoms you test yourself in the comfort of your own home. If I was living in USA I will definetly buy and keep 1 or 2 at home.Time for the shorts to cover and for longs to enjoy a solid uptrend, $20 or more before the end of the year.Blessings"
Buy the Dips
"If they are indeed sold out, then how is that a good thing. They will lose sales as a result."
On May-13 they will provide a corporate update together with the numbers for 1. Quarter.Sales in 2. and 3. Quarter should rise significantly.
"Meanwhile BinaxNow, a less accurate antigen test, strikes a deal with United for international flights....smh. Hopefully they are all over American or Delta."
LHDX is down 7.08% to 29.01
Check out prpo also I got into this one today as they have the same news as prpo bullish in both$$$
Just Starting Get Ready That was NOTHING 
Every change in magagement bringing new ideas and better management is weel seen by investors.
nice recovery
"$190m in cash to start the 2q. $13.1 m cash burn rate in q1 ($6m was r/d). $17.5m in inventory to start q2. New plant in DR came online in April - much higher production and at lower cost. Intl. exposure in Taiwan, China, Canada. A flu test that is further along than most ppl are aware of - and it destroys the competition. Delta variant rising. Many things to be bullish over."
crazy ah $$$$
California becomes first state to require COVID-19 vaccines or regular testing for teachersThe new rule will go into effect Thursday. School districts must be in full compliance by mid-October.
Marketcap is too low. Marketcap $200M. Could hit $10 TODAY.
such a hasty profit taking smh
Earnings beat Wall Street estimate could be another short squeeze￼
I am surprised this stock is not doing better. Not invested right now but watching...
"This swab story is such BS, know why:1) The swabs were used & the tests worked (months ago)2) The swab exposure was like 10 seconds3) A lot less hygienic stuff than swabs goes up people's noses (like fingers & other things, ugh)4) $85K (really that needed a press release?)Pure insanity. Fix the problem, move on. It is a EUA. No customers even noticed the problem with the test because there wasn't one."
always man
"https://es.panjiva.com/Lucira-Health-Inc/77554078Shipping details for batteries purchased by Lucira. 3 large shipments this month. 7/16 was 10k kg, 7/18 is 19k kg...just around 500,000 units can be powered by these two shipments"
people just holding onto even their unrealized gain makes the price rise heavy (not to mention unrealized loss). no need to be daytradin but close out the positions from time to time and reenter on dips.
May be a goverment contract
Feb sp was $38. In 2+ months drained to $5+.
Why the halt before closing?Any thoughts?
"Selling at book value, revenue doubling quarter over quarter."
Government contracts likely. Administration said last week that they are negotiating with 6 at home testing kit manufacturers just like Ellume. Agreements expected to b announced over next few weeks.
I just made 6K. Bought at $8.65!
"No wonder an analyst PT is much higher: ""While the laboratory tests that are currently available take between 2 and 14 days to generate results, Lucira’s test kits provided results in less than 2 minutes to all of its clinical trial participants."""
"Precepio more than tripled on similar news, same could happen here tomorrow..."
I buy another 1000 shares .. let's goo Easy double by this month
LHDX is down 19.62% to 8.77

Lets see if this ugly drop at the open can give us a solid new support at the 50 MA at $ 5.96 and build strength for a new uptrend to break the next resistance at $ 7.38We have great tailwinds towards Q2 and Q3 numbers and technically the stock is looking good. Lets see if we can continue towards a $ 10 to $12 price target before they report Q2 numbers.Onward and UpwardBlessings
a steal at $7.90

"Frequent Covid Tests Urged to Help Curb Spread of Delta VariantThe highly contagious delta variant has prompted some infectious disease physicians to call for ramped-up Covid-19 testing to prevent infected, vaccinated people from spreading the virus unknowingly.“We need a lot more testing. And we need to think about how do we scale up testing in an effective way,” Carlos del Rio, executive associate dean and epidemiologist at Emory University, said. “Identifying people before they infect others, I think it’s critically important.”The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday released findings that people infected with the delta variant in Cape Cod, Mass., carried similarly high loads of SARS-CoV-2, regardless of whether they were vaccinated. The agency revised its guidelines to recommend that fully vaccinated people wear masks indoors in areas of high or substantial transmission, and that they get tested three to five days after potential or suspected exposure to Covid-19.Some physicians say more frequent testing would be helpful even if they haven’t had contact with an infectious person.Denmark, the U.K., Germany, and many other countries have distributed rapid home tests widely so their residents can know in 20 minutes or less whether they’re infectious and should stay home, Eric Topol, director and founder of the Scripps Research Translational Institute in La Jolla, Calif., said.“This has been the biggest missing component of our total strategy in the United States,” he said."

Test yourself from home. This is a gift to all USA rural communities concerned about not wanting to take vaccines.
"Down only 1.7% today is relatively bullish for this stock... lol. Added more today, hoping for some positive news relating to NBA / NHL playoffs"
"Smart way to use this test. And when winter an Christmas travel comes, this will be the way to go.5.0 out of 5 stars Great at home testBy J&J on May 31, 2021I purchased this for my husband who just got home from a deployment and had to fly commercial home for 2 days. We wanted to make sure he was covid free after. The test was pretty simple,clear instructions and easy to use. Got negative result in a little less than 30 minutes. I will be purchasing again before we travel home to visit family"
Sold earlier and shorted this scam
"""We are excited about the momentum that we have generated during the first quarter of 2021,"" said Erik Engelson, President and Chief Executive Officer of Lucira Health. ""Not only did we complete a successful IPO, but the developments made with our COVID-19 test kit this quarter are testaments to the quality technology platform we have created. Our platform was adapted into a COVID-19 test kit that has received OTC authorization in the U.S. and Canada and has started aiding in testing programs that enable safe reopening. We plan to build off our quarter of strong development to gain market share and accelerate revenue growth."""

"Good Morning ! In my view yesterdays most important figure :""Cash Balance as of March 31, 2021 was $189.8 million""so cash per share stood at exactly 5.00 $ Yesterdays closing price was 5.96 $so You can buy the complete actual business for 0.96 $not too expensive in my view, leaving a lot of fantasy to the upside.Next quarterly report will be decisive."
