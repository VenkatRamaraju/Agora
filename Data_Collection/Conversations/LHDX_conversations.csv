"My simple view after yesterday conference is that we have a clear path for an uptrend in anticipation of good Q2 numbers. Those who are short I think they will begin to cover. The positive expectation outweights the negative going into Q2. We are way oversold. So the positive here is greater than the negative and risk.The Q1 revenue was only for products sold by prescription, Then on April came the OTC EUA and the Amazon deal, So Q2 sales should bring some revenue for this indication which is much bigger and easy to increase sales that the prescription one. This is the HUGE POSITIVE compare to Q1So with this expectation going into Q2, the valuation should increase. We are currently less than 5 million EV, That´s a joke!! We are oversold technically and we have good expectations as our tailwindAs we wait and travel the road towards Q2 the company could announce some more international or local partnerships which will give a nice tailwind to the stock. ANOTHER HUGE POSITIVE.This is as they presented a reopening play, not a negative COVID is over and testing is over but a better way to test for COVID when in doubt from the comfort of your home, no more travel to certain places for testing, no more waiting. It is perfect.So technically we could be confirming the bottom here, we could easily be around $10 by the time Q2 numbers come. And if numbers are good and show more growth and potential for the coming winter FLU/COVID season, then the pps will continue to uptrend and increase in value. If they don´t, then we are heading lower, Onward and Upwards towards $10 or more by AugustBlessings"
I just made 6K. Bought at $8.65!
"Nothing to worry about at all. Only weak hands - short term price decline, long term potential is huge and even improving with new COVID rules.Fulgent (FLGT) flied up after COVID testing need, 2019 income was ZERO and revenue a fraction of what is now ... 2020 income was 200m ... 2021 H1 income is already 280m.The future of Lucira is absolutely clear and straightforward :)"

"This is the level where you load the boat IMO.At least that's what I'm doing. Been making many purchases on undervalued gems today, and LHDX is among them.Just look at the chart. Is it transparent or what? You can see exactly what they did. The ole' pump n' dump, which is the typical market play of big money over the last few months. I have seen this happen repeatedly with more stocks than I can count. They run it up 100% in a short period. Then smash it right back down in DAYS. Often smash it lower than where it was when it started to run.LHDX follows the same pattern. The thing is, just as the PUMP reaches a limit, the dump also reaches a limit. There's only so long they can pump it, and only so long they can dump it.They're pretty much done dumping at this point, and so it's the perfect point for value investors to step in and take advantage of their criminal manipulation of the market.Thanks WS Sharkies."

News is coming...I wouldn't want to be short when it comes...
Great price
"Is it possible the candles in the last two days have shown a change to a positive trend? Bottomed out yesterday? Load up, average down while you can."
"A poster stated the assumption that ""Large contract commitments on Corporate, Government or Overseas orders may consume all of the product produced"" sounds like wishful thinking to me. IF that were the rosy reason for product being Sold Out on Amazon, why hasn't the company said so? The facts are:1) about 1 week ago an astute investor reported that Lucira's covid-19 test kit had suddenly disappeared off Amazon's website2) no comment from the company to date3) I called the company and was told by the media department that the product sold out and that the word from the grapevine was that it would take 2-3 weeks to get the kits back in stock on Amazon. 4) on Friday the stock spikes more than $3 and settles @$8.50I check this board nearly every day and have seen no real pumping and zero bashing. In fact, until YOLO showed up posting activity was very low, infrequent. I don't know about Twitter or Reddit.This stock is on a roller coaster is all I can surmise. Tread lightly."
"YOLO if you want to average down, I think it will be better for you to wait. The small cap Bio/Pharma sector is being pressure to the down side and LHDX used to have massive tailwinds that for now have turn into massive unknown headwinds.The few of us who where here before you, we saw an oversold condition with a technical double bottom around the $4.75 area, to that technical we have a huge tailwind for sales for Q2 and Q3 that was the clearance to be sold without prescription and the deal with Amazon and the great reviews we where getting and holding the number 2 position on their site as Best Seller. That took the stock to double in a short time. And then what happen? A headwind came, no product, sold out and only news that maybe in 2 or 3 weeks they will have available. Nothing more. So with this huge unknown and a red market for Bio/Pharma, until will get clarity, and we have Q2 numbers and what happen and what they expect moving forward, this could easily be push down a little over that past support in the $4.75 area.And if that happen and we hit that low and we get clarity again, then be ready, for this stock will run 200% or more in the next uptrend for fall and winter season are coming and personal testing will increase.So hold on, be patient for a huge opportunity will present again, to go even higher than before, but we need to have clarity on those headwinds of uncertainty.Wishing you the best Blessings"
"Blue skies above $9.55, break that and we will be north of $10 fairly quickly..."
It doesn’t take a lot of buying to move the needle up on this one - very low volume that’s the problem but if good news and more buying - this stock will rise
Bear Trap. Once it breaks $10. The Short Squeeze could be substantial.
"Amazing, there is practically no activity here and Lucia is up 20% in two days and a widening of Covid testing in the US is inevitable. Not going to take much interest or volume to run this stock up. Any news from the company on sales or expansion of Government Covid testing and this will explode..."
"$190m in cash to start the 2q. $13.1 m cash burn rate in q1 ($6m was r/d). $17.5m in inventory to start q2. New plant in DR came online in April - much higher production and at lower cost. Intl. exposure in Taiwan, China, Canada. A flu test that is further along than most ppl are aware of - and it destroys the competition. Delta variant rising. Many things to be bullish over."

"Lucira is being private labeled in Canada by a testing company called Switch Health who is the exclusive testing partner of Air Canada. Switch uses Lucira to provide web-enabled, nurse-supervised, point-of-use testing that allows travelers to get an accurate molecular test and use the results for verified entry into Canada. Pre-pandemic 180,000 travelers a day were screened at Canadian airports. Switch testing volume could be huge as travel volume returns to normal. Launched just 3 days ago, demand for Lucira tests is already huge at Switch."

Could have not ask for a better close and confirmation of uptrend!First resistance taken. Lets see if in the next days we can take the other one at $7.38 and continue the uptrend towards $10 to $12 by August before they report Q2 numbers which should show some of the Amazon deal and the progress made since they got the approval without prescription. Then Q3 will be even better for it will be a whole quarter with Amazon. Onward and UpwardBlessings

"""We are excited about the momentum that we have generated during the first quarter of 2021,"" said Erik Engelson, President and Chief Executive Officer of Lucira Health. ""Not only did we complete a successful IPO, but the developments made with our COVID-19 test kit this quarter are testaments to the quality technology platform we have created. Our platform was adapted into a COVID-19 test kit that has received OTC authorization in the U.S. and Canada and has started aiding in testing programs that enable safe reopening. We plan to build off our quarter of strong development to gain market share and accelerate revenue growth."""
"AMAZON sales will be reflected in Q3 2021, so we should expect a big spike up in sales and therefore in the stock price around November (when they report their earnings)."
Lets see if this ugly drop at the open can give us a solid new support at the 50 MA at $ 5.96 and build strength for a new uptrend to break the next resistance at $ 7.38We have great tailwinds towards Q2 and Q3 numbers and technically the stock is looking good. Lets see if we can continue towards a $ 10 to $12 price target before they report Q2 numbers.Onward and UpwardBlessings
"Good reaction after yesterday conference, good close on a red market! Lets see if we can continue.I am expecting that Kevin Collins will like to show that his recent hiring by the company is worthy. And will soon announce some new partnerships and sales deals in USA and globalyLet the Chief announce some nice revenue from outside USA.We need those announcements as tailwinds towards Q2 numbers.Blessings"
you guys been taught to sell at the moving average or something? tsk
"Testing is the missing link that goes hand in hand with vaccines, you simply cannot make one work without the other and the testing needs to be massively scaled up. Would certainly help if Republican conspiracy theorists stopped playing their game of homicidally negligent politics..."
people just holding onto even their unrealized gain makes the price rise heavy (not to mention unrealized loss). no need to be daytradin but close out the positions from time to time and reenter on dips.
"This has only one way to go from here and that is up!!! With the OTC authorization by the FDA and the Amazon deal, sales can only increase. Technically the stock is oversold, the gap left when the Amazon news was announce is now close and we have a solid double bottom.The EV is less than 20 millionGreat kit to have at home and if you feel any symptoms you test yourself in the comfort of your own home. If I was living in USA I will definetly buy and keep 1 or 2 at home.Time for the shorts to cover and for longs to enjoy a solid uptrend, $20 or more before the end of the year.Blessings"
I buy another 1000 shares .. let's goo Easy double by this month
"Buy all you can...The CDC quietly changed its guidance to say even vaccinated people should get tested if they've been exposed to COVID-19Until Tuesday, the CDC maintained that fully vaccinated people did not need to get tested for COVID-19, unless they developed symptoms.But, new data shows vaccinated people may be able to transmit the Delta variant just as well as the unvaccinated.The CDC is now urging anyone who's been in close contact with someone who has COVID-19 to get tested 3-5 days later, so they don't put others at risk."

Does anyone know why Ladd is down so much today?
Halted something big is about to happen
"I have been trying to contact the company to ask why their tests are now not available on either the website or Amazon and have received the following answer...""Regarding why Lucira’s test kit is not available on its website or Amazon. The company has strategically prioritized business purchases over small orders on Amazon and its own website. If there were an issue with its manufacturing partner Jabil, it would have to file an 8K. Lucira has not filed an 8K."""
"Given how poorly they have handled this recall (from a customer point of view), how rapidly Amazon has developed IT'S OWN at home test (which it now promotes; can't find the Lucira test at all there), and the fact that they burned $50mm in their first six months of 2012, that cash pile is about the only thing keeping their stock over $3.50 (estimates ""net cash"" they currently have.)This stock will probably see a 4 handle before it sees an 8 handle."
The bots could really get hold of this tomorrow and drive it up very fast...

What's up with the big strong buys near the end of the session?
"The consumer who has mild symptoms is much more likely to pop into their local drug store and spend $23.99 for 2 tests not thinking/caring about accuracy, over spending $75 for a much better test.The price point for these kits will have to go down significantly if they expect any kind of mass adoption. I was not expecting the retail price to go up from $55 to $75 for this next iteration. The DR facility should have reduced costs by at least 50%. Does anyone have an idea what their actual unit production cost is?I still believe in the product for its accuracy, ease of use, and mobile verification app, but if other 15 minute tests are available at 20% of the cost of Lucira, that's a tough pill to swallow for a business needing to regularly test its employees - even at the sake of some accuracy."
Government contracts likely. Administration said last week that they are negotiating with 6 at home testing kit manufacturers just like Ellume. Agreements expected to b announced over next few weeks.
Big day ahead... probably chilling in the 8s by 11am

There should be a good short squeeze coming up
"@Kite you ask Why is it down for 2 days in a row? Profit taking??I think is profit taking. Why? Because the company has no product to sell, in their website and on Amazon and have not given us any news about what happen.This company was looking great, technical double bottom was in, got the clearance to sell without prescription and got a deal with Amazon, the stock was up trending nicely even one day it pop 40% it double from the bottom in a short period.But now the value adding catalyst of big sales for now is gone until we get news from the company. This company cannot afford to miss days without revenue and miss making their own product be known in the market. It was having great reviews on Amazon.So this could continue to sell off until we get news of why they run out of product and when it will be available again. Until then, there is no value adding catalysts for this stock to go up. And also when looking at many samall Bio/Pharma companies are all being pressure to the down side.Blessings"
"Great I will have more at this price, thanks for the cheap shares. Have a look at Flugent's recent ER and comments on testing demand..."

"Just finish listening to the conference. There is still 1 million test per day being done, and regarding Abbott, Lucira is a small company in comparison to this daily demand. So very little market share of that will do wonders for Lucira.They are working heavy on marketing to bring awareness to the company ""the best kept seceret"" this awareness will bring people to Amazon which is scaling nicely and also their own website through Shopify.So is simple. Marketing to increase awareness to increase salesCOVID/FLU test combine for next year, plus other potential tests as wellBut I see it very simple. This company has 2 quarters to prove that they can increase revenue in a good way. I think they will do it. And if they do, then they will have the time to increase more value as they bring different tests to market.Lets see if we can have a good green close today.Onward and UpwardBlessings"
