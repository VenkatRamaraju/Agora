"This is the level where you load the boat IMO.At least that's what I'm doing. Been making many purchases on undervalued gems today, and LHDX is among them.Just look at the chart. Is it transparent or what? You can see exactly what they did. The ole' pump n' dump, which is the typical market play of big money over the last few months. I have seen this happen repeatedly with more stocks than I can count. They run it up 100% in a short period. Then smash it right back down in DAYS. Often smash it lower than where it was when it started to run.LHDX follows the same pattern. The thing is, just as the PUMP reaches a limit, the dump also reaches a limit. There's only so long they can pump it, and only so long they can dump it.They're pretty much done dumping at this point, and so it's the perfect point for value investors to step in and take advantage of their criminal manipulation of the market.Thanks WS Sharkies."
It’s up because test is now widely available on Amazon.
"Lucira is being private labeled in Canada by a testing company called Switch Health who is the exclusive testing partner of Air Canada. Switch uses Lucira to provide web-enabled, nurse-supervised, point-of-use testing that allows travelers to get an accurate molecular test and use the results for verified entry into Canada. Pre-pandemic 180,000 travelers a day were screened at Canadian airports. Switch testing volume could be huge as travel volume returns to normal. Launched just 3 days ago, demand for Lucira tests is already huge at Switch."
"The consumer who has mild symptoms is much more likely to pop into their local drug store and spend $23.99 for 2 tests not thinking/caring about accuracy, over spending $75 for a much better test.The price point for these kits will have to go down significantly if they expect any kind of mass adoption. I was not expecting the retail price to go up from $55 to $75 for this next iteration. The DR facility should have reduced costs by at least 50%. Does anyone have an idea what their actual unit production cost is?I still believe in the product for its accuracy, ease of use, and mobile verification app, but if other 15 minute tests are available at 20% of the cost of Lucira, that's a tough pill to swallow for a business needing to regularly test its employees - even at the sake of some accuracy."
"Given how poorly they have handled this recall (from a customer point of view), how rapidly Amazon has developed IT'S OWN at home test (which it now promotes; can't find the Lucira test at all there), and the fact that they burned $50mm in their first six months of 2012, that cash pile is about the only thing keeping their stock over $3.50 (estimates ""net cash"" they currently have.)This stock will probably see a 4 handle before it sees an 8 handle."
more peeps waiting and wanting to bail than new buyers.waiting big brother yolo to eat up big 9.14 candle
It doesn’t take a lot of buying to move the needle up on this one - very low volume that’s the problem but if good news and more buying - this stock will rise
let go.it will start to go up once you let go.
Got in early this morning. Been told this will be $11 after earnings from an old board of trade friend. See if he is right

people just holding onto even their unrealized gain makes the price rise heavy (not to mention unrealized loss). no need to be daytradin but close out the positions from time to time and reenter on dips.
looks like its gonna erupt tonite
I am surprised this stock is not doing better. Not invested right now but watching...
Ok if you watch the video on taking the Lucia test - I prefer to spend a little more as I don’t plan on having a lot of test kits around - just want one that works and is accurate - in testing accuracy is the key -
what time are they releasing the statements anyway? i sent a query but greg still hasnt got back to me
"""We are excited about the momentum that we have generated during the first quarter of 2021,"" said Erik Engelson, President and Chief Executive Officer of Lucira Health. ""Not only did we complete a successful IPO, but the developments made with our COVID-19 test kit this quarter are testaments to the quality technology platform we have created. Our platform was adapted into a COVID-19 test kit that has received OTC authorization in the U.S. and Canada and has started aiding in testing programs that enable safe reopening. We plan to build off our quarter of strong development to gain market share and accelerate revenue growth."""

"The big boys are having trouble keeping up with testing demand. Many have scaled back or even closed manufacturing facilities. Let's hope Lucira is able to increase production rapidly to capitalize on the growing demand. They will be able to sell as many as they can make for the foreseeable future.""As the delta variant rages across the US, it's getting harder to find COVID-19 tests""(sorry, ya ho wouldn't let me post the link)"
"Selling at book value, revenue doubling quarter over quarter."
This is the bottom for LHDX. This is a $17 stock.
where has yolo gone?
Just bought me a COVID kit to keep around the house - I like the idea of having one just in case I just want to test a family member - seems easier than waiting in line with everyone who has COVID - already received fed ex shipment
FYI: Kits are again available on Lucira's site for $75 a pop.

"Low price & no volume. Canada doesn't accept Antigen tests for Border entry. Air Canada announced a program today where Lucira Molecular Covid Lamp tests can be used t and verified for passengers entering or returning to Canada. Demand should be in the order of 150,000 screened passengers a week. Even if 20% use Lucira that is a lot of demand in Q4."

"Great I will have more at this price, thanks for the cheap shares. Have a look at Flugent's recent ER and comments on testing demand..."
