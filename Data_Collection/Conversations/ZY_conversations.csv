ZY had all of its future on hyaline which is a failed product. The hope is that as the field of synthetic biology evolves that ZY will have the technology to stay in the game. I will buy in when the stock is below $5
The next Elliott Wave target price of 10.74......ZY.
Going to be comical when Gunk Ho shareholders drop 70-80% on the same bs that got Zymergen in a fix.
News is insiders are getting out. This company is one big joke.
Is this company one big joke?
"Shorts covering, new buyers or pending news?....."

Any news..?
DNA news not good for ZY
"I like the technology but all signs now are pointing to a failed product ... Laying off people and renegotiating their loan shows they are going back to the drawing board and re-evaluate their roadmap. There is more uncertainty now than when they warned. I'll wait and buy sometime next year or the first hint of their turnaround. I'd rather buy after a 100%+ pop when they make a huge announcement rather than investing on hopes, dreams, and just because ARK is invested."
Today was the end of the ZY lock-up for early investors.
"The price has been moving in the 12-15 range for 1.5-2 months. People just drive the price by buying and selling, and therefore it doesn't go out of this range. All that remains is to buy on the fall and wait for good or bad news, but at the moment this is pure speculation position"
"Anyone who spends even just 5 minutes looking at the Zymergen website SHOULD quickly become aware that this company is NOTHING but a Theranos redux.For all their CLAIMS of ""naturally-derived, bioactive ingredients for sustainable consumer care products,"" NOWHERE do they offer evidence that their ""product"" in ANY way meets that criteria.Indeed, the ONLY description that they provide is that it is some sort of polyimide -- aka PLASTIC. And so far ALL they have a FILM that can be used to cover stuff. This company has SCAM written all over it.ROFLMAO!!!"
Folks bought this sad joke because of the magical Cathie... poor choices ...
"If insiders are getting out at this level, what does that tell you ladies and gentleman? It’s time to get out, unless you believe you know more than insiders."
Glad i sold this junk @ 14 plus
Still can't figure out ZY. No viable product at all but.stick keeps moving up .
"Many people are seeking for stability in this unstable crypto space and A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now . I'd say it's wrong to just sit back hold and wait maybe incur some losses along the line , that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making profits should be the way of life that being said , the market is still all about BTC at the moment and I'll advise current investors and newbies to take advantage of the Mr. Steve program , an establishment that handles people who lack understanding on how maneuver the crypto space , to help them recover loss from the crash and also accumulate more positive returns , with their program i went from having 1.4btc to 7btc in just 9 weeks.if you're interested in getting started just send Steve a message on whats<<<>>App + 1 ( 8 1 3 ) 6 8 3 ‑ 6 3 1 0 OR Te** le*gram @SteveFX01"
"ZY does not have enough cash to survive the end of 2022 ... Expect a secondary offering sometime next year especially if the next earnings report shows increasing losses. Anything above $1B is too expensive this year at least through mid-2022. ARK tripled down on the last crash. I bet you they've been trading in and out to lower their average. This is going back down to settle and consolidate at a lower single digit price. Best case scenario is $10, worst case is $3 the next 12 months. Too risky to get in above $10."
"Just inflating the price for a better exit, the volume tells it all ..."
