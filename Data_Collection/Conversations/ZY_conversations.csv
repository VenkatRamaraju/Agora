"ZY has 100 Million shares and around 15Millions have been dumped but the rest 85% are being held for some reason. Common guys, it is a win-win situation if we buy here. Cheers!!"
Made a small bet at 8.27 USD. This company got an elite management team and is invested by tier 1 VCs. Falling 76% this morning is a safety margin strong enough for me to bet a bit
Where will the price go?
Is this company one big joke?
https://discord.gg/jdDR7QDN
Good time to get in?
Did I miss something? The company says it has no money and nothing to sale for at least next 2 years and it goes up 70%. Are the big guns pumping then going to dump and leave many bag holding?

CW magic. She is a great gambler!
Earnings today?
I will buying 100 in the AM
What should we know about this share? Is it worth to get in?
"Do you advise me to sell now, I am afraid to wake up tomorrow and find the price is low, what do you advise me?"
Way too overreaction. This will close at least above $12-13 tomorrow
"Mr. “Flatley is a seasoned executive, with a strong track record of driving operational excellence and bringing innovative technology and products at scale into the markets. Flatley served as CEO of Illumina, a cutting-edge company in the human health space, for 17 years, and as its Executive Chair, and later Chairman of the Board, until 2021.”"
DNA news not good for ZY
can we hit 17 by end of the day ?..long 100 from 9.02..
Ms. Woods stepped up today - 138k+ shares
Next week under 11$
Going nowhere but up.
"Broker once told me how to invest in new bio-tech stocks. Buy 10 of them, wait ten years and hope one or two are successful to make up for the losses in the other 8."
$25+ soon
Breaks below $5
It will be green today
"It will go to $20 today, easy. It’s a good moment to buy it now. CEO “quit”? - well he didn’t do a good job so now the company can just do better."
"Ouch! That was a pretty devastating news release. Brace yourself for lawyers. I've been watching this company for awhile, but have not had the guts to pull the trigger."
Cathi Wood & Goldman Sacks are large bag holders. They crying tonight.
soon$25 to$30 soon

my 13k shares I brought at $8.08 got as high as $8.61 yesterday but I'm looking for $9.09 to sell

There has been resistance at $14 all day it seems.

Why did it drop almost 80% today? Can someone explain to me please

Do you like losing money? Invest here...just because Cathie spent little money on her circumstances doesn't say anything. Look at their investments! There you will also find hedge funds / shorts
https://go.trade-ideas.com/SHAP
"These buys are by the Big Guns, probably those who bought in awhile ago. They know that the real asset in ZY is the platform they built - extensive scientific knowledge & experience, excellent data capture and analytics, and superb robotics to allow for rapid testing of variants for increased quality & yield. Hyaline was just the first proprietary product, but they've been doing this with various chemicals for years. Yes, Hyaline's difficulties are a problem, but anyone other than day traders knows to hold and, when opportunities like yesterday arise, buy. $8.50 / share was an amazing overreaction."
(MRM) MCap $36 m --Float 2 m --Profitability by Q1 =Cathie wood likely to buy this under radar gem
"Push to 30 , then sell,…."
It should be at around $25 and thats still 50% off from where at was
be ready by tomorrow$3 up
Just bought another 250 shares 400 shares is plenty risky...
"To whom that bought shares today, Be prepare to loose Again.. LMAO!!"
Cathie Wood just bought 1mill ZY shares
New to all this. Why is it halted???
I wonder what will happen tomorrow?
Take the profit guys
"This was clearly a manipulation. The market knew this company was pre revenue and only might earn a bit this year. They got a mew CEO, dude took a million dollar company to the largest genetic analysis company in the world worth 70 billion.Their tech is amazing. Just getting started. This could hit 20+$ today"
Folks bought this sad joke because of the magical Cathie... poor choices ...
TIMBERRRRRRRR! 
Better buy this dip!
Waiting for the next dip.......
I bet you Cathie pumped it yesterday big time and dumped all of it today!!!Crazy to even suggest to buy and hold a company that lowered guidance and Ceo departing due to his failures.... Cathie what do you thing the other big institutions are thinking about the way to pick stocks...No wonder why several big institutions are betting big time that Ark will fail.............
Two words - Cathie Wood. These are enough to propel any stock to Mars.
I was a little upset yesterday because I sell my 130 at @13.30 which I bought the day before yesterday at @8.35. Now I am happy
"Good Call on SRNE , Treasury .Looks like they are well pised for alot of growth. Loading up now!"
Cathie will still be surprised if the shorts have sold all private investors
Double from 7.85 in less than 24 hoursUnreal!
Still $30 dollars to go from where it started
"If you’re looking for a short and sweet guide to the day’s biggest news, I recommend (http://Pick-stocks.com). They breakdown the most important pre-market news and it only takes a few minutes to read."
"How does a company with no income and no product, but plenty of expenses survive? There are massive class action suits ahead for the company and directors. I jumped ship when it hit $12 and count myself lucky. This thing is going to go down like the Titanic and anybody holding shares is going to get soaked."
trust me soon$25+
can this hit 2 bucks today?
ZY loading up truck
"However, Zymergen isn't a completely lost cause. The company still expects to earn revenues of $5 million to $6 million in Q2 from research & development services, and it has a notable list of investors that includes SoftBank Group. It's also working on a naturally derived non-DEET insect repellent that could be a big catalyst down the road."
Pushing for $20?
Excellent entry point! They know they have to correct the issue and not just for share holders.
I bought some yesterday can i sell it today?
"Wow. Great call by Goldman Sachs. They've downgraded ZY and cut the price target from 55 to 12. If you had listened to them, you'd be sitting pretty!"
wow! That was much faster to reach 12 than what I thought
going below 5
Yes Cathy wood is buying it

"J.Flatley, former CEO of Illumina, taking CEO position? Interesting. Huge vote of confidence. This is a top notch genomic at bargain price. When the dust clear back to 30s..."
just checking in and was expecting to see this up to like $17 but I see my stop lost saved my back side yesterday
cthiy wood has trebles with her new stock hood she was dreaming$100 unfortunately down side happened.
Bid in for $3.
Scary Paperhands
Open under $8 tomorrow. Close over $9 on Friday.
Going to be comical when Gunk Ho shareholders drop 70-80% on the same bs that got Zymergen in a fix.
knew when I sold at 70% 20mins ago it would shoot up right after. but hey 70% gain in 2 days is cool too

And now the halts and games begin
Take some profit
"Shorts covering, new buyers or pending news?....."
i had a few bucks layin around so i bought 55 shares at 14$. cool little stock to add to my portfolio.
Hi
No product. No revenues. No CEO.This is worth less than 2$
Why ya worry so much at what price people are buying? Worry about your own behind.
The centralized banks (protected by the government) take all the money out of the company before the stock is even issued. We are left to deal with the crumbs.
I heard about ZY the other day on (http://Fairstox.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
"In May, J.P. Morgan had initiated coverage of Zymergen with an Overweight rating and a $40 price target."
Cathie dumped on pump and now retail are holding the bag..........
Why anyone buy when CEO just gave up and quit? They can't make the goods also. No buyer as well. Why people buying?
Cathie Wood is a genius.
Deep Rumors of the AI DeepMind software 3D Protein Structural imagery to be used for COVID research. The exact comparison of Protein structures VS. predicted models by scientists were IDENTICAL. Think of the movie Transcendence but in real life with AI models creating synthetic and organic molecules in the future. The science with Zymergen is just the beginning.
Hopefully I see my $32 per share again
just waiting to clean short salers..
"Insolvency incoming. No product, no cash, scam"
bid in at $8.08 for 13k shares

How many insiders dumped shares before public release of the news?
doubled my money in 24 hours! love it!
INGNJust saying. It'll do the same tomorrow or Monday.
Should I buy in now?
I couldn’t be happier with the daily emails I get from (http://Fairstox.com). They give me the best daily advice based on stock market news and help me make wiser decisions when it comes to investing. An absolute must for any investor!
Ebon and nept...better watch YouTube search boxOn mini bitmain minersBuddah the magnificentThe magnificent one
I see back to 15.00 today
Still can't figure out ZY. No viable product at all but.stick keeps moving up .
"Hey it’s up 3 cents after hours , that’s a positive"
Would you rather buy stock at its highest or its lowest? We know the share price used to be $48 at its highest. The CEO who clearly didn’t do a good job is now gone. Now this can only do better! Don’t miss your chance
@25% of IPO price right now. I'm looking at this as my IPO entry price. I'm a ground floor investor.
"With 588M in cash as of 6/30, what is cash per share?"
typo saved my life.. I bought KY instead of JY.. couldnt be happier..
this will be $100 soon
"When a stock rebounds by 50% after falling by 80%, it s still just 30% of the value before the fall! Huge potentials!"
Someone please tell Elon to tweet that he will buy the company for $52 per share. I'd like to dump my shares - that's what I paid.
"""What is biofacturing?Building on advances in genomics, machine learning, and automation, Zymergen’s patented platform unlocks the greatest manufacturer of all: Nature. It enables us to pinpoint useful molecules in Nature’s vast catalog, produce them with biology, and scale them to market at the speed of the digital age.""......"
it will be easily $20 by tomorrow
"WTH, did Elon say something? total Memeworld!"
The stock price has stabilized. The opportunity to make a superb abnormal return seems gone. I will consider buying again after seeing new catalyst
"Too many herd buyers, make the stock market a TOTAL JOKE!!!"
"Can't believe that Cathy Wood was buying this massively speculative stock and not AMRS, which is the only stock in this sector with a chance of actually making money anytime soon. My sincere condolences to all retail investors here and especially to the employees of Zymergen who have been left holding a bag of coal."
"How the hell these underwriters did NOT know that ZY did not have a legitimate product?""J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC are acting as lead book-running managers for the offering. BofA Securities, Cowen and UBS Investment Bank are acting as book-running managers. Lazard is acting as co-manager."""
Today $19

Stock halt is being discussed. Not sure if this will lead to delisting but it certainly on the table. Anyone still holding this? GLTA
Is it collapsing now?
In one or two weeks back over 20. Big upside at discount price. In Jay we trust.....
Sweat deal at 8.70
No good news at the moment sadly. I’m cutting my losses for now and will buy back in when we hit the bottom. GLA
Nice move by Cathrine Wood hedge fund to buy ZY.Look for 30 plus now.
100 million volume one day the next 3 million Good thing this is all regulated Hate to see it get abused by the Mega rich lol 
"I am interested about the biofacturing possibilities in a future, thought 40 is high, now got some much cheaper. Ready to wait and watch, this can be valuable in few years, and probably gets 20’s in near future when they get new CEO and some plans."
"oh well my stop lost at $15.20 took me out the run for $17 but I will be looking tomorrow for a dip to get back and I must say it was the easiest $69k I ever made, ya'll have a great ending see you tomorrow if God is willing"
"Amazing move butPAYO, PSFE, FINV, GGPI, STAF are much better"
Can anyone make a serious argument for why Zy is still a viable company? Is there anything else in the pipeline that might turn this around? Do they own any valuable assets or IP that could be leveraged? Please help me find a reason to invest in this company.
Just because a stock falls seventy something percent doesn't make it a bargain. No revenue and burning through cash.
Wow.. there is no bounce
possible handle forming on a cup.
we all teach our kids or other people to learn how to build patience in or life so let's show some of that here folks

I had to buy some shares at this price for a long term hold.
Got in @ $8.40’s yesterday. Not leaving. Looking SWEET…… REAL SWEET !! GL to the true longs holding this gem. 
IPO to bust in 3 months. The ongoing story in this phony stock market. Outside the index stocks is pure HELL. Will you discuss that financial propaganda media? Nooooo.
-0- soon.
bought 100 at 8.50 if it goes to zero oh well he'll I have bet over 800 on a hand of black jack before..lol
Cathie needs to snap 5 more millions of shares
Still see the $49 1-year target --- that's not going to happen......
Smart money loaded up on this around $8. Dumb money is buying it up to $16. This will crash to at least $12. Keep in mind… no revenue until 2023. Cathie Woods can hold until then. Can you?
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zymergen-announces-executive-appointments-strengthening-200500328.html
The right time to load up few shares. Cheers!!
Great time to buy!!! Load up....
get 20
I think 5 bucks is coming around!!!
I just bought it for $12 is that good
"Baillie Gifford & Co.bought during the 2nd quarter worth $112,960,000 of $ZY"

In Jay we trust. Jay was ILMN Godfather...
This is 35 dollars stock
ZY will definitely squeeze as soon as there are no more shares to short.
Cathie did the monkey blind folded throw a dart on ZY???I like the way you pick your stocks...After the firm pulled its forecast for 2021 sales and announced the departure of its chief executive office...Great job!!! Tell me what other companies that miss guidance and Ceo departing so I can load up on these winners...LOL!!!
"Anyone shorting down here in the 8's must love pain. I imagine Kathy Wood may be the biggest seller here, or is she averaging down?"
It was a tech issues with scale up? So just retool of equipment?procedures etc Product still good Buy buy buy !!
I had a hunch my portfolio was due for a scandal. I suspected TSP but have always been skeptical of Zymergen. My interest in Zymergen has been hearing a claim they created a large manufacturing capacity to produce and ship products over the next few years.... is this still the case?
Just follow Cathie Wood. She's working hard to make money for the small investor.
"""Genomics...Machine Learning...Automation"" are buzzwords these ""Synthetic Biology"" outfits like to toss around, not realizing they're revealing the lack of understanding for scaling up research-scale processes to real-world manufacturing. Been there, done that. Has anybody asked WHY one would need bio-based polymers when we have perfectly fine solutions already on the market?"
"The price has been moving in the 12-15 range for 1.5-2 months. People just drive the price by buying and selling, and therefore it doesn't go out of this range. All that remains is to buy on the fall and wait for good or bad news, but at the moment this is pure speculation position"
"Many people are seeking for stability in this unstable crypto space and A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now . I'd say it's wrong to just sit back hold and wait maybe incur some losses along the line , that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making profits should be the way of life that being said , the market is still all about BTC at the moment and I'll advise current investors and newbies to take advantage of the Mr. Steve program , an establishment that handles people who lack understanding on how maneuver the crypto space , to help them recover loss from the crash and also accumulate more positive returns , with their program i went from having 1.4btc to 7btc in just 9 weeks.if you're interested in getting started just send Steve a message on whats<<<>>App + 1 ( 8 1 3 ) 6 8 3 ‑ 6 3 1 0 OR Te** le*gram @SteveFX01"
class actions just announced as some mentioned yesterday..
Some unpleasant odor around. It that shorts frying?....
Jay Flatley is the real deal.
This was recently recommended by Barron's!..... Guaranteed there will be no comment by them on this disaster!
"Guys, out of fear, I sold some extra dollars and were satisfied with it, but hold on and don't sell until the price reaches $30 or more."
"Anyone who spends even just 5 minutes looking at the Zymergen website SHOULD quickly become aware that this company is NOTHING but a Theranos redux.For all their CLAIMS of ""naturally-derived, bioactive ingredients for sustainable consumer care products,"" NOWHERE do they offer evidence that their ""product"" in ANY way meets that criteria.Indeed, the ONLY description that they provide is that it is some sort of polyimide -- aka PLASTIC. And so far ALL they have a FILM that can be used to cover stuff. This company has SCAM written all over it.ROFLMAO!!!"
"Clue the flock up people. Down over $26 per share, this is the obvious part. Almost as obvious, 10 times average volume would mean 3,647,260 as volume approaches 20 million traded. The word capitulation applies without question. Buy and hold to be rewarded. This kind of volume is not mostly retail buyers, nowhere close actually. Fund managers are scaling in aggressively. Buy a third if you lack confidence, wait for lower (I doubt it goes meaningfully lower) buy another third. Lower still? You have another third to average down.3:04 PM $8.23 real time quote"
you was watching lost night that ZY price almost$17 so short salers when out those ones can't catching .
Cathie Wood getting whole bunch paid. People keep buying. She is the genius.
I'm gonna buy 2 shares tomorrow..
And what does Cramer say? He works hard every day to make money for others.
"They only had one product, hyaline and it had technical difficulties with manufacturers using it. I like synthetic biology companies but they are very speculative right now. I might buy in when the pps hits $2."

"their only product does not work,,....oopsy"
J Flatley was founder and CEO if ILMN. Illumina went from 20$ to 500$.Flatley would not hold any position at ZY if this is not future genomic giant.
Cathi Wood bought 90% of the shares today. Make sure you have an exit plan.
150 shares @$8...let's roll the dice and see how it goes!!
"Wow, -14% and no rebound"
... Wow and I thought I was having a bad few weeks. My down 10% is nothing apparently.
"about 2 hours ago I advised Phil to ""buy this now $8.09""Before the close Friday, this will be over 9"
"Just inflating the price for a better exit, the volume tells it all ..."
Buy and average out your shares at a lower price!
this is the price fixed between $11and$14?I think so.

Nail in the coffin. No revenue in 2021 and any 2022 revenue to be immaterial? Wow.
"Don't buy in looking to swing trade. Wait for the stampede to exit by next week.Bill Gates, Cathie Wood, and John Doerr are among the backers of this scam co who got hosed."
