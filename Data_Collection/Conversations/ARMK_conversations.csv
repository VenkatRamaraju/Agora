"Aramark are buying business - 50% price reductions on existing business. Either they want top sell or they are drumming up new business with little profit margins. Uniforms have dropped, made most profit on Sanitizer and glove sales and this is dropping - Pricing reduced and will have to sell a lot more."
"ARMK holding firm after tepid earnings report. Declining sales, flat earnings. PE=24 a bit over prices? Why not a big drop like SYY which posted a better earnings report? Please advise."

Rated Strong Sell. Way overpriced with what they do and their huge debt and declining revenue.
This board is about as exciting as watching a wild kingdom rerun
"Aramark is super diversified and is “cleaning up” on uniform, sanitation and cleaning contracts. These contracts are high margins and all facilities are still paying to have their building cleaned and sanitized several time a day."
Who is buying this stock when the whole market is down? Is it people that own call options that are covering their calls?
