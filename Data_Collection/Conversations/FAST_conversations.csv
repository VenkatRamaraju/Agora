"FAST has treated me well with the split, growth following the split, good yield, and looking forward to the special dividend this month. My holdings have increased 111% over my cost basis since my original purchase in 2014. Having accumulated more shares with the split and re-invested dividends I'll be selling half after the special dividend and only have 'house money' invested. Fortunately have a losing position in some inherited T stock to offset the gains. Merry Christmas and Happy Investing in 2021."
I lucked out on this one. Bought 1077 shares at $54.75 back in mid Sept and watched it drop to 50.86 and now its back and then some. Way to go Fastenal. Now drop back to $50 or lower so I can buy it again.
Yes . I did short 500 shares. Will hold one day only. Just earning play.
"Worked here many years ago and man this place gave a new meaning to cheap, but can’t argue with the company as a stock holding"
"The stock has held up surprisingly well for the markets overreaction. I find this to be a bit of a surprise, this stock has definitely not been a Wall Street darling yet it only goes higher."
"I can only hope for a steep drop in FAST over the next few days. The jump today came with twice the average volume, but closing off the high of the day. I think the price will sag tomorrow. Back to $65 next week?"

buy puts going into earnings
This company is always evolving.
Margins DOWN yet again this earnings period....as margins go so does the stock price...
expensive stock no matter who you look at it
Looks like this morning’s disappointing earnings report will solidify below $50 for the rest of the summer at least...
"As somebody who worked for a large American contracting company with a huge presence in both the US and Canada, I witnessed first hand that Fastenal was the go-to company for sourcing construction supplies."
Huge short interest in FAST -- 12 days to cover. That is driving the stock price up today. Might keep going up for days as shorts cover after in-line earnings report.
"Fastenal was just on Motley Fool. This company seems like a solid bet; set it and forget it! Increasing annual revenue, profit, cash flow!"
PF chart gives FAST target $88 with 20% upside potential!
Held FAST since 1995. With splits and Re-Invest my CB is between $1.94 to $2.79 per share. Great company with projected earning @ $1.74 in 2024. Sellers will lose out !

$75 billion market share and we will gain a large part. #fast #tech
"If it wasn’t from Tax benefits FAST wouldn’t have beaten earnings, Therefore core business didn’t beat. This isn’t going to be enough for such a big company during a shaky earnings season to be. Sell off should be in the 5 to 10% range ."
