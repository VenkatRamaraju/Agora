FAST is down -5.20% to 51.59
"Fastenal is very similar to where John Deere and Illinois Tool Works were about two years ago, it took several quarters of beats on both the revs and earnings to finally convince people that the beast was loose. Also, people seem to lack the understanding and ability to discern the difference between WW Grainger, MCS and Fastenal. Grainger has always been a grossly overpriced one stop shop where many mom and pop shops and small industrial users could get equipment/stock with a single purchase order, but you had to pay for it through the nose. Fastenal offers a one stop approach but for difficult to find and unique items, they also provide in-house servicing for MRO storerooms and the expansion of the industrial vending machines seems to be creating good volume and better margins."
"Meanwhile, Netflix a stock with a P/E over 110 is now up on the same valuation concerns from Raymond, you know the markets are being gamed when that happens."
"This is not new money buying (new buyer would not chase the stock up 15% since IN-LINE earnings and IN-LINE guidance - see below points). It is an epic short squeeze. Since more than 32 million shares have traded over the past two days - more than covering the 23 million short shares amount, it looks like there were a lot shorts put on after the reporting date for short shares. The short squeeze is getting overextended, given the massive volume. As for earnings? Revenues barely beat estimates - came in at $1.257 billion vs estimates of $1.247 billion.The ""massive EPS beat"" of $0.74 was driven by $0.15 of tax benefits ($0.04 of which goes away because it was special to this quarter only). Excluding the tax boost, EPS was $0.59, versus $0.66 consensus. Depending on how much tax benefit was baked into consensus, the quarter was a miss or at best ""in-line"". FAST earnings presentation, slide #3: ""2Q18 operating income grew 13.3%. Reported EPS were $0.74; however, a discrete tax item added $0.04 in 2Q18. Beyond the discrete items, we estimate Tax Reform added $0.11 to EPS in 2Q18.""Also, they did not raise guidance. They did say that the tariff risks do not hit their earnings in any way. That may be so or they just don't know yet. But for a company dealing in metals and manufacturing, and reliant on construction/repairs....it is hard to believe they will have no direct or secondary impacts from economic headwinds related to tariffs and other slowdown caused by it.So, I don't see a lot of new money buying great results. Again, not at these prices and not for ""in line"" results and guidance."
This company is always evolving.

"BruceK, if the shorts are to be believed this is the most irrational play of 2017. The article claims that its P/E is on par with the technology stocks. I guess he or she hasn't cared to look at some of the other big industrials like ITW, DE, CMI, JOY, and PCAR. If anything I would think that Joy and Paccar are more likely short candidates than Fastenal. From a strictly technical side the hardware business is showing good strength. Not going to say that FAST hasn't proven staying power, but everything seems to point to good earnings this time around, mainly with autos doing exceptionally well this quarter."
"Fasten your seat belt, this thing has rolled over on earnings virtually every quarter over past 2 years. Surprise me."
Keep in mind everyone with large interests in FAST is watching today. What it means? When tide is turned (only so much vertical rally can do) expect massive stop losses placed thru $60. It will take out stop losses like a hot knife thru butter.
Fastenal reached an all time high at 45.49

"Neil, that is an interesting question. Are you saying that they will be paying 25% more for the same Chinese goods or will they be paying some amount less to source the products from an American based company who also will source supplies from Fastenal, so in the end, possibly their raw material costs or inventory costs increase but their overall revenues increase as well. The Japanese understood that paradigm quite well, even without tariffs the Japanese are a very exclusive society even as it pertains to business. Japanese companies supporting other Japanese companies and citizen buying from those Japanese companies because those companies provide them jobs. If the USA could ever figure that out we would be a truly dangerous economic force. I remember in the mid 70s on a particular 60 Minutes episode. They were interviewing a textile worker in front of his home, complaining about the fact that American consumers were buying cheaper foreign goods, leading to the death of the American textile industry. In the background of the textile worker was his Datsun 510. What comes around, goes around."
"Even though it shouldn't, it'll go a bit higher with more short covering. The market also doesn't want to drop yet, but it doesn't want to cross 2900 either."
Not sure how the tariffs will affect the stock.Look around their stores and everything has the stomach churning 'Made in China' label on it.If they are the victim of the trade war they will have to raise their prices to cover the tariff..Will people still buy if the prices go up by 25%?
FAST Overpriced. Should trade closer to $30.
this guy is full of #$%$. I hope you can cover your losses from trying to short fast
"If it wasn’t from Tax benefits FAST wouldn’t have beaten earnings, Therefore core business didn’t beat. This isn’t going to be enough for such a big company during a shaky earnings season to be. Sell off should be in the 5 to 10% range ."
It will Close Big RED
Likely to go higher but would have a stop in place for unknown events.
Huge short interest in FAST -- 12 days to cover. That is driving the stock price up today. Might keep going up for days as shorts cover after in-line earnings report.
Down a buck and a half...earnings tomorrow morning...hmmmm...looks like we have ourselves a leak...could get ugly tomorrow...
FAST reached a new All Time High at 59.33
"Fastenal has really been a laggard given the very good analysts calls, good earnings reports, good fundamentals and even how well the rest of the industrials are doing. If DE, ITW, CAT, F, etc. keep coming out with great earnings reports, that inherently means that their customer base (aka the manufacturers) are doing well, therefore we should. This stock has really made me scratch my head, I have made money off of it, but am down currently on recent re-entry, started to really question logic of buying back in (and in a strong way). Still a great company with a nice dividend. Hopefully the price will accelerate to match other industrials and not be dogged by the likes of Grainger and MSC catalog shops who are outdated dinosaurs that are grossly overpriced to act as a one stop shop."
PF chart gives FAST target $88 with 20% upside potential!
"UBS AG upgraded shares of Fastenal from a “market perform” rating to an “outperform” rating in a research note on Wednesday, April 19th. Finally, Credit Suisse Group set a $52.00 target price on shares of Fastenal and gave the company a “buy” rating in a research note on Tuesday, June 6th. Eight investment analysts have rated the stock with a hold rating, nine have given a buy rating and two have given a strong buy rating to the company’s stock. Fastenal has an average rating of “Buy” and an average price target of $50.20."
"Yup, this is too high and shouldn't go up anymore, but that is why it goes up. If you are short, it will go higher. Shorts push things higher since institutions force them to cover. Like now. Was a mediocore earnings report that was already priced in in my opinion, but this did go down some with MSM, so investors are just getting their money back before it heads down with the market...if the market bubble ever goes down."
This will rebound over the next few trading days.
How did the earnings call go for FAST today?

Analysts project 0.61 earnings for 1st quarter. Recent price action and recent article about intrinsic value being lower than stock price is disturbing. Monthly sales for Jan and Feb appear to be encouraging but not sure how much expenses will have increased. Company is usually pretty close to earnings estimate. Anybody have any guess on PPS if they beat they beat the 61 cents with positive future growth?

These people are bottom feeders trying to manipulate the price for their Personal Gain. THAT is what I bash. people like Dr Robert and AlphApex ... Good posters. Factiual Info and NO BS. Yiu however are or seem to be defending the bottom feeders who lie and make stuff up. THAT'S NOT SPECULATING or SPREADING INFO (Pipeline). So are you also a bottom feeder or do you agree with me???

"Well, I will agree with the market being manipulated. I held RH for nearly six months and saw the price just go down, once they actually had good numbers and my position went green I bailed for a small gain, now it appears that RH seems to be the only retailer not impacted by Amazon?? Really? I owned WFM just before the buy out as well and sold when it went green for me. I also own TJX and WSM, two stocks that truly will not be impacted by Amazon yet their prices just languish. To blame anything on the Amazon impact is just ridiculous, no one knows what the impact of the internet retailer will be long term to brick and mortar, obviously it will impact certain markets stronger than others, but many will not even see the meter move at all from their presence. Fastenal is a strong company with a very good position, it is adjusting well to an ever changing manufacturing and industrial landscape in America, after reading the report last night, I see no reason for the drop and believe the price will appreciate back to the 50 mark, though this stock does seem to get a lot of negative attention. Don't believe it is in anyway associated with politics though."

"CJ, I agree, the other thing that you must look at is it has a pretty good dividend and it has a good history of upping the dividend too. Fastener business is definitely a leading indicator of industrial productivity and with great reports from ITW and Briggs I think that bodes well. I would just sit, I think this stock will bounce but in the end, the overall bounce will be positive. Every machine built by ITW has fasteners, every motor built by Briggs has fasteners. I also love their recent and strong foray into industrial vending machines. I always thought they had awesome customer service with their top notch stocking of industrial plant MRO storeroom screw/fastener binds, but the vending machines have really allowed them to expand their overall offerings to customers. Hopefully, getting better margins as well."

Margin erosion doesn’t surprise me. They have a large infrastructure so have to pay for it. A lot of locations albeit normally in remote areas on inexpensive land and buildings and the fact is industrial customers are becoming wise on price points. A lot of purchasing options today so demanding 40 points margin especially with larger customers just doesn’t cut it on a consistent basis.
