is it just the opioid lawsuits or does the threat amazon healthcare venture have anything to do with mck share price tank?
"Think of all the FDA approved drugs you see on tv that have been recalled, and class action suits filed because of long term side effects.what are the long term side effects of the experimental vaccines?guess what, you have no legal action, nor is anyone going to pay your long term medical issues due to the vaccine.every drug prior to the vaccine is tested for 10-15 years before being able to submit an application for FDA approval.funny how a large portion of healthcare workers are the ones that are not getting vaccinated."
"We are not talking about niche airline jobs. We are talk about a dime a dozen warehouse jobs, driver jobs, customer service jobs, sales, office workers, these low paid workers will jump ship and find another job paying the same amount where the employer will not tell them they have to inject something into their body against their will.These people have been working full time throughout the pandemic in close quarters. There is no need for a vaccine, where you still get covid 19 and can pass it on to others... just not be symptomatic."
just start a position bough 50 shares at $177.82 ;)
"who wants to work for a company that thinks they own your body, mandates a vaccines, but will not take any responsibility for any side effects (long or short term)."
"So doctors write the prescriptions...these are trusted physicians that have taken an oath, an allegiance to help human kind live. If people believe McKesson is complicit in Opiate deaths, then close down McDonald;s food supplier and bullet makers. Or I have an idea, go after the DOCTORS THAT ARE PRESCRIBING THESE MEDICATIONS. SMH"
please don’t mandate!!!!! I don’t want to loose money ….
"Pfizer and Moderna should just admit their mRNA are short term fix.mRNA are unstable in human body and did not provide LONG TERM protection.It is time to focus on the NEXT generation of vaccine (T-cell and B cell memory) that will provide long term protection and actually eliminate infected cells. mRNA only blocked virus and prevented it from infecting ""healthy ""cells. Pfizer and Moderna should be HONEST to public that their vaccine do NOT eliminate ""infected"" cells."
"Easy healthcare stock to buy, MCK will recover above its 200 dma . Plus, it’s a Dividend Aristocrat."
Has anyone reviewed the exchange offer? I received it but have not studied it yet.
"well, at least half of mckesson workers will be let go for refusing to get the vax. not sure how the company will be able to sell and deliver product."
"This is one of 6 stocks are best positioned for the rollout of a COVID-19 vaccine, according to Goldman Sachs."
Are all COVID vaccines distributed by McKesson? Someone said the PFE vaccine are distributed by PFE themselves

"Mckesson CEO retires effective April 1, 2019. should be a good sign for stock?"
MCK & MMM - can never go wrong buying the dips. Always made money. Also hold CORE positions in both average at $140s providing steady dividend income. Sometimes Boring is Beautiful. Thankful to these money makers!!!
nbc news..D.C. assistant police chief says she was told to 'have an abortion or be fired'.just a matter of time before more companies implement the same policies.mckesson owns your body now.dont be a sheep
MCK is getting cheap. The growth initiatives still leave the company earning at around 13/share. Stable distribution power and good time to add
