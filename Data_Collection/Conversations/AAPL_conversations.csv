Best Monday ever!
"Longs, you can sell your AAPL shares around AAPL's all-time-high, if you act now.What are you hesitating for?You don't want to end up selling them around $82, do you?"
Greatest rally of all time off the 2020 lows. With MMT full steam ahead I expect 6000 sp500 by January and Apple 200.
"I love a  on a red day.Apple will be green today, I can tell.You’ll see, your welcome."

Well done Apple. Begrudgingly giving up pennies on a very bad day for Nasdaq. Time to tear down that 150 wall! Vamos! 
I only have 8 shares but I love this company. Buy buy buy
Giddy up over $155 and she will really be off to the races!
"As posted earlier in this board, future of Apple is in Medical devices. If they can get into medical devices , that will be a huge market. If they acquire Medtronics or they build in-house solutions. They have the technology, engineers and cash to do this. FYI, today the stock raised because of a new medical feature available in apple watch"
Wedbush has $185 price target. They're never wrong.
just sold my apples waiting for the drop to buy back in ; yo yo stock ; hahaha when it drop below 150 im back in ; i love this stock
really it was a wild day trading. Goes thru 150 then sells off and went back thru again. i think it was down 2 bucks after being up 2 bucks. takes stones to trade these stocks
$3 trillion market cap coming
A nominal amount of growth and 1 more split later on down the road and I'll be set. Anything more will be icing on the cake :-)
Over 3T MC by this time next year.
"Any chance Apple may finally gobble up SiriusXM? They already have satellites in position and Apple would gain a bunch of new content to deliver directly to the upcoming AppleCar as well as other iDevices. Plus, they would immediately gain 34.5 million paid subscribers. Not sure if those satellites are capable of sat phone service, though, or if they would need to deploy other sats to handle."
I believe that if Apple can bust a move thru $155 and hang onto it by the close we could see $160 by Friday . This needs to hold onto its momentum .
200 here we come............right on schedule !
She’s coming alive
160 by Friday easy
"I'm 36, started investing in APPL since 28, on and off, sold and rebought, now all in LONG Sometimes it takes many mistakes to realize better approach is to just hold and forget about it."
"On a lark, I bought for my granddaughter, at her request , (age 10) 60 AAPL shares at 36. She can now pay her $75,000 a year college tuition with its present value( and all those splits) We sold some, bought at last split up 20% and are holding for the longer term, still a great buy."
Nice to see AAPL making all time highs. Is it a concern that the market cap is getting really huge? Can people see this a $5T company in 2 years?
Apple Halted Production As Engineers Struggle With Quality Issues
Let’s come to an understanding today?I suggest no more intra day trading and let this play out
Is anybody else tired of watching Apple go up to 150 only to be knock back down to the mid 140s? I have held it a long time and it has been a great stock but seems to be stuck in a rut
"wow, what an AAPL epic bounce back !! GO APPLE, Go Green APPLE !!!!!!!!!"
Why is this rising today?
Apple has been the best investment I ever made hands down. I started buying in 2009. I'm just a mechanic/electronic tech not at all rich. But my investment has given me infinite returns. A few years ago I sold enough to put a down payment on a small apartment building and still have more than my original investment. Left growing house money. I wish every investment was this good. I bought Palantir last year that seems promising too

"Apple’s historic resoluteness about maintaining its 30% cut was relaxed in November when the company announced it would reduce its fee to 15% for app makers earning up to $1 million a year.

The tech giant is also expected to launch updated versions of its AirPods, iPad mini, Apple watches and 14 and 16-inch MacBook Pro models.The MacBook Pros, which are expected to launch in November, haven’t been updated since 2019. This year’s versions are expected to have updated designs with mini-LED displays and contain Apple’s new M1X silicon chip.Apple’s stock looks set to make a blue sky run prior to the release of its new devices, although the overall markets will have to cooperate."
"There are too many traders on the board. It ain’t no matter where it closes today or tomorrow. It matters where it is in 5 years, 10 years. I would not have sold it even if it closed at $200 today."
I just read Apple’s wallet will soon let you be able to store your drivers license and be able to use it at the airports. 8 states will roll it out first. I’m sure the others will follow. Arizona and Georgia will be the first two states. How about the future …great things will be coming.
We will be rolling to 175. Book it.

"10 years later, Tim Cook looks like a genius but back when it took over, many said it was a disaster and AAPL would never be the same innovator. Jobs was the genius spark but even he needed people to create his vision. Ask Wozniak."
Most haters & bashers are acting out of jealousy & regret. Somewhere along the way they missed outon buying apple and are now venting their frustrations in the only way they know how. Just ignore thenoise and HOLD.
"for td101, didn't you realize that apple is up 180 percent for the last 2 years, leading the fangs including Microsoft. that is why you are seeing continuously selling off every day for 10 months. apple already had its biggest gain. that explains it."

"One of these days, Apple investors will be crying about Apple shares going from 250 to 200 in a short term dive, and you will be making a mistake selling shares at near 200 at that time.......this has been going on for decades now, Shares go up, and then go down, but overall, the long term trend is higher highs, higher lows.....look at a long term chart of AAPL, that will tell you all you need to know.

I keep saying this but I think Apple is the best company in the world! I know we should never fall in love with one stock forever but if there was ever one stock to buy and hold it's Apple! I've only been in since 2016 but thanks to stock split I now have 4K shares and sleep very well at night owning this one! This will be a $500 stock again if they don't decide to split again in the next couple of years.

"To prove AAPL's competitive advantage, one need only look at the period from summer 2019-summer 2020 just to get a taste of this company's rapidly expanding moat. During the aforementioned time period AAPL was awarded 1,996 patents. That is a staggering number. If that's not enough evidence AAPL's return on invested capital has increased incredibly over the last few years to reach into the 30th percentile. You can dislike this post all you want but this only further illustrates why betting against this company is suicide."

Apple is the company to own ! I wish I held my original shares the first time I bought it in the eighties ! Big mistake of my life ! However I own a lot of shares in it now and will keep adding with dividend purchases ! Hopefully this will keep going up and my children and grandchildren will be happy
Wow just wow…iphone 13 to support satellite communication so no need for cell service to call send texts etc…this would be absolute amazing!!!!!…this according to Kuo..
"well, data shows Apple been claiming from a long time. Slowly but surely it will go over $200 easy before end of the year."
Today is a clear indication of two things. Number one: dividend reinvestment. Apple bulls and longs are accumulating. Number two: apple bulls and longs are in control. It's nice watching this move when the WallSt manipulators aren't in control.

Satellite text and calls already exist. It requires a separate device with separate charges (monthly type plan). Much of the world is rural. Definite need for it and to make it affordable and plus then they can track you anywhere on the planet!
What are the odds that this gets back to $150 or higher by tomorrow's close? Hmmm.
"Those of you that say this will go back to the 130's are clueless. It will NOT go back unless we had some financial and economic catastrophe. Your money is safe here.

"I took the ""plunge"" and bought my first AAPL shares in 2009. I then targeted all of my earnings and continued buying AAPL until 2012. 3 years of financial sacrifice and a further 8 years of holding. Now on a day like today, my AAPL shares gain more in one day than I earn in an average year of working. I still need to remind myself of the significance of a day like this. Of course, it can easily go the opposite direction, however with AAPL there's been more positive days than negative days."

No analyst has upgraded it since February despite all the positive news. It has started to unlock but will rocket up with full FDA approval in a few weeks. It will be like Apple, Google and Amazon and be obvious in retrospect. It will be the first trillion dollar pharma stock, obviously.

A proven method of perfectly timing the buying and selling of Apple stock is as follows: 1) Buy as many ￼￼Apple shares as you can. 2) Never sell no matter what.3) Repeat.
I love days like today.
"So, are there any brilliant predictions as to whether Apple stock will be below or above $150 this week? You might as well use a coin flip as to the direction Apple stock is headed. It doesn't matter to me if Apple stays around $145 so Apple can buy back more shares. I'm completely clueless about which direction the stock is headed for the week. There is plenty of good news for Apple concerning massive iPhone 13 sales along with the powerful M1X MacBook Pros but it probably doesn't excite investors yet. That's just my guess. I'm very confident with Apple no matter what the share price is."

"Guess what ! It's still not too late to get in at $ 153.40, It is heading in to $ 200.00 and beyond , That is about 35 % upside, We will talk about this in 3 years maybe less than that, You just don't play games with APPLE "" the best company in the world"" !!!"
Will be at $170 by end of October. This is gonna move on up now.
Moved my sale price to $156!
Quit splitting the stock and then turn around and spend shareholders profits on buying back shares. How about raising the dividend for a change......at least we get something better than a few pennies once a year. Better that than having the stock sit in neutral after 3 outstanding quarters. This is getting real OLD!
Wow ! Don’t bet against appl

I have been here 13 years. During that time I read “ AAPL is dead money” AAPL was $7+ then split adjusted .I posted maybe ten times a day that with a P|E of 8 to 10 how undervalued it was.What I am saying now is at $150 AAPL is undervalued
Why is this up in $80 bill market cap in one day again?
Time for a classic aapl draw back? Like most recently when it refused to break $150? Longs are fine either way in the end.
It was July 13 when AAPL started the $145 -$150 consolidation. It has been one full month
Not a bad AAPL day at all considering market and news. AAPL endures. Who sells into panic?

"""JPMorgan ups Apple price target, sees 'multiple catalysts' for shares JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee raised the firm's price target on Apple to $180 from $175 and reiterates an Overweight rating on the shares. The analyst continues to see Apple shares set up for ""multiple catalysts"" into the back end of this year, including the upcoming iPhone 13 launch and ""low investor expectations"" for iPhone and total revenue for fiscal 2022, led by concerns relative to cycling past the peak upgrade cycle associated with 5G. Chatterjee increased his 2022 iPhone volume estimates to 246M units and sees ""substantial upside"" relative to consensus expectations. Estimated moderation in the upgrade rate to iPhone 13 relative to iPhone 12 will be offset by the higher volumes for the lower priced phone, as the 5G enabled iPhone SE to be launched in 2022 provides upside ""through the upgrade of a large installed base that is looking for a more affordable 5G device,"" Chatterjee tells investors in a research note."""

"AAPL, has another double in it.........at least! Been in it since 2013, and yes, I should've bought more, haha"
If Apple loses payment processing fees then they should just start charging more for maintaining the platform and for app makers to put their apps in the store. If the developers don’t like it then they can put their apps on Erickson phones or Xoami and other independent OS not Apple or android. And if phones start to get hacked and user data is leaked from other poorer payment systems who have cyber security issues then I suggest buying cyber security stocks in your respective country.

Man when we push through 150 the shorts are going to run for cover fast. Squeeze us right past mid 150s.
I've said it many times before on this board. $175-$200 by year end. It aligns with all the TOP analysts predictions.

"Some BTD and some cry about a dip, which do you think makes more money?"
"Anyone who would sell this stock better think again. AAPL has averaged a 35.4% yearly return from 1981-2020. The lowest 10 year period was from 1981-1990 when it averaged 20.1% . During 1991-2000 it averaged 22.1%; 2001-2010: 68.1% and from 2011-2020: 31.2%. Further, AAPL is stable producing gains in 8/10 years in each of the last two decades. Use the Rule 72: Imagine your investment doubling in every two years! Finally, every share of AAPL purchased in 1981 has become 224 shares including a 7/1 split in 2014 and a 4/1 split in 2020. Best stock in the market for long term."

We posted what was confirmed by many Wall Street banks: “ AAPL is undervalued at $150.”What we said they did not was “ all but once AAPL had its’ dips: 7 to 20%.That one time AAPL ran and never looked back... spring earnings of iPhone 6.These are the memories of the board historian of now 13 years.Good Luck

"Apple executives are in Korea negotiating Apple Car production plansSenior industry sources have told reporters at The Korea Times that executives from Apple have been in the country as of late to negotiate and discuss future plans for electric car component manufacturing. The industry of electric vehicles (EVs) is one that is rapidly growing, and if Apple wants to sustain its status as the richest company in the world, expanding into a market as hugely lucrative as cars certainly makes plenty of sense on-paper. However, substantiated leaks of how an Apple Car might look, preform, or anything else of that sort have been all but extinct. Apple does somewhat openly preform road tests for its internal testing of self-driving cars using their own LiDAR units, but those modules are equip onto any standard Lexus off an auto lot. According to The Korea Times report, Apple exes ""have been in Korea for business talks with its Korean partners in the semiconductor and display sectors [and now] the company is seeking business partners in Korea for its EV business"". Insiders speculate that Apple held ""advanced"" level meetings with other higher-ups from SK Innovation - the branch of LG that manufactures electric car batteries. One of the ways Apple plans to stand out from the EV competition is by sourcing lithium iron phosphate batteries, aka LFP batteries, as opposed to the traditionally used lithium-ion batteries inside of almost every single piece of tech available today. LFP batteries are considered to be more durable in terms of being longer lasting batteries than can handle more recharge cycles than typical li-ion units can, but they also have a lower initial energy density as compared to a li-ion unit of the same weight and size. They’re also supposed to be far safer and less prone to overheating, which has gotta be high up on Apple’s priority list."

Both HP and Dell are already reporting chip shortages will hurt sales for the remainder of the year along with having to raise prices. This may help Apple in regards to pricing equity. Tim Cook is making sure Apple has plenty of supply to meet decent demand. I would really enjoy hearing about a shortfall in sales of Windows desktops and laptops. This may be one of the best chances for Apple to gain even a little bit of market share. Apple's computers don't use standard RAM modules and Apple motherboards use less semiconductor components in general. It would be great if Apple could sell a couple of million more desktops and laptops combined to close out the year. I'm not saying anything is guaranteed but we'll know by the time the holiday season rolls around. TSMC stated Apple will be their top client and after that the auto makers will be a priority. There by will be plenty of fighting for components among all the Windows PC manufacturers and some are already feeling the pinch for back-to-school computer components. Apple needs to step up its marketing push. Apple Silicon has to gain traction before Intel and AMD catch up with their own ARM silicon. I hope six months will be enough time for Apple to get a solid lead.

"That's my baby! Up a buck at open,"
breakout in progress.
uh oh. it's all downhill from here.
Apple has been consolidating for the last 6 weeks (7/12)Beautiful breakout after long consolidation!!!
This IS the APPL we know!!!
Phenomenal day for Apple. All time high! Cook = Money. As I so eloquently stated a few weeks ago that Apple will soar as we get closer to the September event of New iPhones and iWatches. Voila! Hehe 
I say look out below here. Massive 20 to 30% sell off due here. We are that over priced here. Whole system is one massive pyramid scheme here.
Eh…told you $148.60 had no chance to hold. Should have listened to me. Predicting the movements in Apple in the final 10 minutes requires one word…lower.
Coool! May partner with Globalstar Satellite to offer emergency satellite coverage on its next iphone
"Up YTD 15.5%. I'm expecting this to be around 20% by EOY (or around 159), which to me is a 'slow' year not reflective of record earnings and I'll be looking for closer to 25-30% per year in the coming 3 to 5 years.Of course, I could still be pleasantly surprised as we head into the closing quarter this year too!"
"How you like Cook now naysayers! Like I always say about Cook, a fabulous custodian of the company……. And a hombre that made me “mucho” dinero. Hehe "
Just A picture or information leaks of an Apple car will unlimited skyrocketed  the share Price 
why is apple up over 54 cents in after hours trading. most of the fangs are down.
"As of today Tim Cook has a decade as the AAPL CEO under his belt. Under his watch the stock has risen 1014 percent. He may not be quite as innovative as Steve Jobs but you would be hard pressed to find somebody other than Jobs that could do this good of a job. Most likely there will still be trolls on here bashing Cook but for me personally making boatloads of money since I first invested in 2013, I have nothing to whine or cry about. I think people should be worried less about Tim Cook being able to fill Jobs' shoes and more about whether or not Cook's successor will be able to continue the monster run Cook was able to successfully continue after Jobs kicked the bucket."
the fangs excluding Netflix and Amazon are very over bought. expect apple to close on the low.
Dropped 1/3 of its increase already. Heading red today quickly
AAPL forming a nice bottom coming around along with the market. Its trying for the Breakout at these levels. Good Luck
160 is coming soon. Apple continues to be a revenue monster. New product will only accelerate earnings. Loving that new MacBook pro 16!
"Biggest threat to Apple in the next 6 months are countries trying to copy South Korea, and the ruling in the Epic case. If things don't go Apple's way I could see a shockingly fast drop of about 20% of our current price levels. Odds of that happening feel low to me, but I personally can't believe that the Epic case made it as far as it did. It's clear that world governments don't care at all that Apple single handedly reduced the commission price from an average of 50% in the 2000's industry wide down to 15%. They see Apple as an ideological enemy and somehow a monopoly ( even though Android is > 70% of world smart phone sales ). This perception will not disappear. Long term I still believe Apple will stay a strong company and perform just as well as it has, in a very similar fashion to MSFT when it was found guilty. The fallout if Apple is ruled against will negatively impact Microsoft, Nintendo, Sony, and potentially even Tesla."
If we have an overall market tank day any time in the near future this is going to tank hard. Been in this for two decades. Any time it languishes like this when the market is up we get punished. Sold quite a bit earlier today. I’ll still hold a position but had to offload some to offset a coming pullback.
Well well...looks like wall street used Goldman Sachs to stop apple from breaking through 150. Making all call options go bad again...
Options pressure the stock. Exercised calls are sold. The stock jumps at irregular intervals. If you aren't long and patient you miss the gains. From $5 to $110 was a good investment. From $110 to who knows where will be another good investment. AMD has the chops to take all revenue from $INTC and $NVDA. AMD can put extreme pressure on $AAPL the spy phone company. AMD can become a key supplier to CSCO. AMD is the top super computer Artificial Intelligence company.
"$GSAT jumped 65% on news that $AAPL IPHONE 13 will include Satellite capability. Don't they need someone to put it in Orbit? Space X is busy with ISS, $ASTR can't get a rocket off of earth.. that leaves you with $RKLB with consistency...."

Wow... AAPL is really having a hard time sticking above 150 ...
AAPL hits new high at $152.25!
People who are stranded in nowhere land with no cell coverage will now be able to call for help..
I just hope that Apple doesn't revert back to its oinker of a stock persona and do the Apple Shuffle (one day up followed by four days down) again. God forbid that this stock would go up every single day for a whole week or something!
AAPL’s nature to trade in trend of three.Last two days it has opened at $149+If not today soon
Thumbs up if you think AAPL can still realistically rise another 20% this year.
"I'm up $22,000 today."
I own apple and I am not to happy with there performance ever since the split 4 for 1 it diluted it with 16 billion shares that's a lot they should of only split it at the most 2 for 1 that would be 8 billion shares I am on fence to adding to my apple position I will keep what I got for now but I will not add right now unless it goes way down
Powell just told Cook to deal with inflation by raising prices. Way to go Fed.

"It's not surprising Apple isn't holding well towards the end of the day. But it's not because of Apple, the overall Dow is down and Apple is a major component of this sector.

Looks like Apple is going to have some satellite technology in their back pocket with Global star GSAT ￼￼
Be prepared for Ron Hall to recommend selling because it’s going to high!
Looks to me 150 is in the rear view mirror..
Come again? Satellite phones? 
"AAPl is my longest held stock, and I doubt we see much price increase until there is a worthy amount of buy backs. maybe down to 8 B instead of 16+B. Notice institutions aren't holding as much of a % as a year ago."
"Once the Apple and Epic lawsuit settles next month, Apple will jump 20% at least. I don't understand why the court would decide what Apple can charge or not for its services. If Epic can not afford it, don't do business with Apple. It is a dog and pony show."
Let’s see if Powell moves the needle up??
"guys - apple iPhone satellite . come on, give some respect. this needs to be 3.5T company on just this news. and then iCars  - another 1T. total of 4.5T. on top of that Jay Powell is a big fan of APPL products, he may buy some from his monthly $120B. lots of tail wind"
"Over 300,000 this week’s $150 calls traded yesterday. They closed at $2.07.Now, this could had been multiple intra day trades or not. In the past, when this happens there is a Momentary dip the next day. Yesterday AAPL ran $2+ at open before a $5+ dip. How did that dip happen? I posted last week how in the past on Friday’s I once saw AAPL run $3+ only to drop $7+. It does happen in the world of option traders.At the end of the day a new 52 week high!As posted many times, option players control this action."
"165 by November. It is written, so let it be done."
Well done the story keeps getting better. Cook you da man! 
cook sold 5 million shares
Let’s have an Apple Rally for Cook’s 10th Anniversary today with Apple————> America’s most iconic company. Hombre’s been a fantastic custodian of the company and created fabulous wealth for us shareholders. Second stock to put me into two commas. 
Is rod hall homeless yet?
Algorithim players had a good day Good news is two times AAPLdipped to &146+ then ran back to $150+
A question!Would a farmer prefer a steady stream of water or an occasional down pout?What fills a bucket quicker: a leaky faucet or sudden thunderstorm?This is basis for AAPL’s nature.We can climb a mountain and yell echoing ourveirds. ASPL will still be AAPL
Chart is showing a close over 152.00
"A close above $155 and it's ""look out above!!!!!!!!!!"""
Just as 5G Supercycle winds down we will then get the Satellite Supercycle.
Very strong Apple multiples.Very strong ads. Very strong shareholders.
"Devastating news for Apple  investors ! Tablet sales are forecasted to fall !“Tablet market expected to decline in the coming years”Read it, understand it accept it"
Today we will see another all time high!
$168 soon!!
I bet that John Kelly guy came to the board today talking about his $120 PUTS 
Remember when were people selling this at 125. I watched some genius on bloomberg saying he had shorted Apple & other people should too. :)
Got my order in for a Candy “Apple” Red 2-seater Apple sports car. Hehe 
Ripping!
Allowing 3rd party apps? Meaningless as Apple will just collect its platform hosting commission another way. Whatever the outcome Apple still gets paid. Hey becdd see use of this they may come up with something Thant even increases profits. But worst case scenario is no impact.
Suggest no more intra day trading.Let this play out going into Sep launch
It’s AAPL’s nature.It is not uncommon for AAPL to tread water for yes as long as two+ months before moving higher.I did not want to post this week but was reading board and wanted to point out the obvious - the algorithim players!Yesterday they did well as well as Tuesday when AAPL almost hit $151. Then the mini dip to $146+ back to $150 next week.Historical price data supports both comments
"Breakout, big vol, room to run stochastic, next resist 157.88, then who knows how high. No doubt a $200 stock within 12 months."
"More people have lost money chasing dividends than at the point of a gun. TOTAL return is all that matters.Having said that, Apple will probably increase their dividend within the next 18 months - probably by the end of the year.My post for the year, see ya in ‘22."
"I decided to check Yahoo Finance to see what people are saying about this recent Apple rally. I was hoping to see intelligent, constructive comments. Instead, there are so many posts from short sellers and Apple bashers. It's unfortunate there are so many haters out there. We should be happy this once in a generation stock is doing what it's doing, that is make investors rich."
"AAPL wil be a $10T company in 10 years or so......zero doubt.......now, obviously, other stocks will do much much better than AAPL, but this one is now my a slow steady grower.......buying back a ton of shares, paying a small div to reinvest......spurts of growth.....good enough for me........all the FAANGS are in my core holdings, and I have a lot other investments in higher risk stocks/ small caps, but this is my biggest holdings, and we remain so for a long long time.......GO APPLE !"
"Down $1.50!!! DOOM! GLOOM! DISASTER! PANIC! Expect the rain of frogs.Seriously dudes, take a chill pill."
"Spanning?I always get lost in my passions.Before yahoo format change I had over 50,000 posts. Yahoo use to number them"
August historically has always been the worst month for Nasdaq…..more than half way through it….and exactly 4 weeks until iphone etc….
"I just realized that, in a month, I am hitting my 10 year anniversary of buying into APPL. Did most of the buying between Oct 2011-Feb 2012. After logging into my account my ROI is currently 660%. Hoping to hold for another 10-12 years."
"if katy huberty can't move the stock higher on surging iPhone demand in China, we have a tremendous problem. sold every share today."
Yup….keep buying back and retiring those shares Luca…in 10 years Apple will have bought back and retired half it market cap
"td101, you are officially retired. apple has more significant news coming in September. this is the Run to 200 now."
Why is all this political BS on a stock forum? can we keep the comments related to $APPL?
No real long-term investors are buying AAPL shares now.That's why the price fades towards the close. (Two days in a row.)You'd better sell before fading becomes collapse.
Does everyone realize that Apple is in almost all mutual funds and that QQQ has Apple as its number one company.
"Days ago, while we stayed optimistic we posted that monthly option expiration may be a problem. It appears it is"
"guys Always remember this ""one thing"" with APPLE , ""Lot to gain & Little to lose"", Yes it would go down sometimes but at the end it would go up and much higher , Do Not Bet Against The Best Company In The World Period !!!"
"I see a lot of posts from long term holders. I wish I was one, I wish I bought 20 years ago. Anyway, for those who have that long term perspective who do you think are the Apples of today that are just starting? thanks"
Time to take profits?
This stock can never hold a gain more than a day.
I will buy apple products once the stop building products in a country that waged biological war on the world.
She’s off and running premarket. Early Gains should hold today
"All time high. No resistance, just blue sky breakout."
"""(Reuters) - Apple Inc persuaded a federal judge to throw out a $308.5 million jury verdict it lost to a privately-held licensing firm for infringing a patent associated with digital rights management."""
"I am keep reminding you guys that you just do not bet against "" the best company in the world"" , don't sell now because it will go much higher and stay away for few years and will be rewarded and will be glad you did !!!"
"Overall, with 26 analyst reviews on record, split into 19 Buys, 5 Holds, and 2 Sells, AAPL has a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The shares are priced at $150.38 and their $162.32 average price target suggests ~8% upside from that level."
"people who missed the boat praying apple goes down, how sad haha"
"Let's wait till next Feb and see where APPLE would be, I think it would be around 175 which is about 20 % upside , relax people !!"
New products to be announced within the next 2 weeks. Should rise in anticipation. go go go
2022 forward PE of 23 for Apple growing at least 10%(very conservative) per year makes Apple severely undervalued.
“Oh no they are selling the strength too early….they are supposed to wait until the end of day!…now what’s going to happen?!….what do I do now?!”…..the life of a Market Timer…it always amazes me how some people turn a long term guaranteed moneymaker into a short term money losing casino.
flying s
Buy buy
It’s bs that $aapl $tsla $gs conversations are all up to date and $nio conversations are all messed up. Come on yahoo. Why are you discriminating? Oh and $amc is really whack. Got something to share about who gets a clear discussion? Hmmmmm.
"The Best Company In The World ! Do Not Bet Against Them But Join Them, Even At This Price $ 154.74 Is Still Too Cheap, Heading To $ 185 - 200 Soon !!!"
"I mentioned to Apple four years ago, that if the watch can detect blood pressure they will sell it to everyone age 30 and up. It's the first indicator of heart attack and strokes."
"May God bless Timothy Cook, who will lead Apple to the promised land while donating much of his bonus stock money to charity."
Microsoft and apple have been tracking together in the last 3 days. there is nothing to worry about. remember apple goes at a very slow pace now.
Long term Apple holder. GS warns economy is shrinking due to delta variance. Also September is usually the worst month for stocks. Jobs report this morning was a miss. Look for a correction sometime this month. Buy opportunity ahead
Muted almost 1/2 the posts
Stock has absolutely no get up and go. It’s like a fish out of water. Nothing drives it higher. Earnings. Rumors. Upgrades. A fart in the wind drops this $3.
It's really hard to stay exited about my day job when every 1% rise in Apple is more than my entire month's paycheck LOL.
don't click on any of those discord links... they are phishing scams. Shame on Yahoo for not blocking them.
Tim Cook got $750 million final payout from a ten year compensation.Tim don't spend it all on a new house young man.
iPhone 13 connects to satellite-cellular-system = REVOLUTION in ITGL2ALL
2-3 points today sonny!
literally one of the easiest investments right here... Holding for my fifth year and counting lol.
“Listen guys we are gonna hit Hill 150 over and over again until it falls”….”bring in everything you’ve got and let’s do this!”
Bought 200 today. Waiting for the release of new products.
I wonder if cnbc will bring on Goldman for a 5th day in a row to knock down Apple?
Last time we posted “ It’s time”AAPL ran from $125 to $150+.“ It’s Time!”
AMD manufacturing capacity and revenue are both set to increase 60% this quarter. Such a coincidence. Q4 may be better because $AAPL makes the transition from 5nm to 3nm leaving 5nm open for AMD.
"Momentum, Mimentum, Momentum!Do not loose it.If so,?Fuhgedabudit"
No pre-market works bestThen gap at open higher
bump is due to Epic vs APPL case verdict whispers that is supposedly favorable to APPL.
After hours 
"APPL (holding until we hit a $3 trillion market cap) & ACRX (anybody having surgery, read about ACRX) my top 2 buys. Yahoo Finance PT on ACRX = 600% upside! ACRX 2022 a huge year, read some of the posts out today..."
"We may drop a little now, but the iPhone 13 event and Epic verdict later this month will cause another pop."
"Once again, no posts this week from moi.I want to observe a week here in silence"
"Went to bank borrowed a tonne of cash for next to nothing, bought apple stock. Lovely! They loved the business plan, said thats what they have been doing for years!"
Will touch 156$ tomorrow ? 
Setting new highs day after day as we head toward September’s blockbuster event…….. and another thing. Hehe 
"So now, if Epic doesn’t pass on the savings to us gamers, we can band together and sue Epic."
Love this stock. Huge future. Only have a couple of shares. I will continue to build future wealth through AAPL. Great news for all AAPL traders
Futures looking pretty good. I went all in today with Apple. Hope I made a good move. See no reason they went down like they did. Hoping to catch the next run
Apple up 76 cents in last month
“Apple loses some of its market share to Samsung in Korea”Hmmmmm
New iPhone's are around the corner! AAPL 
"Yeah, Apple is going to slide in the next couple of weeks and then gain momentum right before new product announcement. I took profits at 150 and a half. Will get back in later. Take your profits now, I said that before but got shewed away. If not then risk a market correction."
"went into an apple store yesterday, it was humming! pickup line was full of people."
Apple being distributed (sold off) by a large stakeholder. This has been going on into a rising overall market especially the NAZ. Could it be Warren Buffet I wonder ?
"apple was able to hold up very very well today, closed above $153 and new 52 week high was made today. expect momentum to $160"
We also have tomorrow!Keep the light burning
Good news for everyoneI will not post all next week.I will send smoke signals from my campfire though
apple going to use satilites using the 13 phone platform pretty cool  going to be using gsat for satilites according to apple analyst
"To me...if apple is serious of providing an added satellite feature on future iphones then perhaps they should just consider acquiring a cheap company like globalstar satellite which owns the spectrum...then they basically have it all except for the new ""satellite chip"" Qualcomm would provide."
"For all the wishful thinkers hoping for $150 plus tomorrow- you can't dismiss the usual market tankers - Covid Delta variant fears, inflation fears, slow economic recovery fears, Rising Bond yields fears, China shipping restriction/delay fears, rising jobless claims fears, early FED tapering fears, diminishing consumer sentiment fears, and on and on ......"
September 1st ?? Thumbs up for green apples. Thumbs down for red apples.
"If you are long term investor in AAPL, like me, Goldman Sachs has been brilliant .....time and time again, for giving me an opportunity to add to my Apple holdings.........:)"
Gee I could invest in crypto or Apple. I will take Apple thank you. I just bought another 100 at 146 for a nice total of 10500 shares. Thanks sellers
All time high again and again. Holding forever!
154.98 might be the high for September. apple usually peaks in September and August.
Disappointing close . But a new record high is a new record high !
3 months ago 'Apple 150 EOY' was laughed at. This will be a 10T company within the next 5 years. OK - you can start laughing again.......
"It’ll close green. People know that Apple is, was, and will always be the only sure bet."
The App Store settlement is very important win for Apple. Now the uncertainty is pretty much over. The Epic trial judge has to sign off on this agreement. As long as Developers are in agreement then the govt will be too.
"Just went to the Apple store today, we can purchased any products and split the payment for 12 months without interest charged. Which means more people can afford to buy any Apple products in the future instead paying $1000+ at once."
I’m changing my position to divd reinvest. I’m ten years it will be worth $25k
AAPL hits new high at $154.78!
A lot of people are loading up with AAPL because it's the safest stock
"So, I am curious. Who is actually selling apple shares?"
Looking forward to making satellite calls on my iPhone 13 while driving in my Apple Car while checking my oxygen level on my iWatch while listening on my iPods. How you like dem Apples? Hehe 
JPM ups AAPL price target to $170.Citing 5G iPhone SE expectations.
"Whenever the Apple Watch is capable of FaceTime, then this stock will rocket into another universe. That’s the catalyst we need!"
Go iPhone 13
"So of my four biggest holdings two of them, MSFT and NVDA, have broken out as predicted. Next on the agenda is Apple . Expecting a massive Apple breakout muy pronto compadres. As sure as eggs is eggs. Arriba! "
"With a Fed taper, a 10% market correction would put Apple around $130. Many are sitting on gains over 100% with Apple, unless you recently bought on margin, nothing to worry."
"Five and half dollars up for the month, $1.30 a week.A good August."
Told you. Will be 175 by product announcement then drop back a little
Four steps forward one step back ? I'll take it every time!
tomorrow the sentiment would change and market would go up big time.
Why is apple up so much today
Happy belated 91st birthday warren Buffett. You’ve showed me the way with Apple. Hold long and strong.
New iPhones soon. Can't wait for both new phone and company profits.
Developers and Apple agree. This long drawn out uncertainty hanging over the stock is done!
The Best Company In The World !!
I love Apple and their efforts to run our businesses and also defend our country. Its also good that Yahoo is shutting down derogatory comments for a rest. I will go all night against the Apologist.
my gut is saying Apple is going green later today. Anyone agree?
"Apple + GSAT= satellite technology, zero dropped calls and quicker 5G connection."
