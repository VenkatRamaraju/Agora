"I thought I missed out a lot when I jumped onboard Apple in 2013. In 2030 many will look back on 2021 and kick themselves. With great innovative, profitable companies it’s NEVER too late. You can chase startups but industry giants come along once every 25-50+ years, not every 25 days, despite what you want to believe."
I wonder if cnbc will bring on Goldman for a 5th day in a row to knock down Apple?
"That is what happens when you stay long. Apple is not day trading stock. Buy and hold, always makes money for longs. With satellite capabilities, Apple should charge extra. Excellent feature. $175 very soon."
AAPL hits new high at $152.25!
"Wedbush predicts stocks will rise until year end. Keep buying tech stocks, no other place to get yield."
Options pressure the stock. Exercised calls are sold. The stock jumps at irregular intervals. If you aren't long and patient you miss the gains. From $5 to $110 was a good investment. From $110 to who knows where will be another good investment. AMD has the chops to take all revenue from $INTC and $NVDA. AMD can put extreme pressure on $AAPL the spy phone company. AMD can become a key supplier to CSCO. AMD is the top super computer Artificial Intelligence company.
Imagine how many people bought the IPhone 12 thinking they will own it for many years before upgrading to a new one.. Many will see great benefits in satellite connectivity and upgrade again to the iPhone 13. Apple will have record IPhone 13 sales numbers...
It's really hard to stay exited about my day job when every 1% rise in Apple is more than my entire month's paycheck LOL.
This is a classic breakout. $160-165 by Friday. New all time highs add 10-15% quickly.Breakouts have bigger and stronger follow throughs especially during lighter bullish holiday trading weeks.
every person that is stuck in hurricane with cell or power is thinking apple satellite connectivity is my next buy.i phone 13.first to market with satellite mean more people stuck in ecosystem.this was genius to be first in an hurricane was big message board.god bless all involved with ida.
"With APPLE, you just close your eyes and HOLD. By the end of the year, you're up 50%"
AAPL TO $200s
"Anyone who would sell this stock better think again. AAPL has averaged a 35.4% yearly return from 1981-2020. The lowest 10 year period was from 1981-1990 when it averaged 20.1% . During 1991-2000 it averaged 22.1%; 2001-2010: 68.1% and from 2011-2020: 31.2%. Further, AAPL is stable producing gains in 8/10 years in each of the last two decades. Use the Rule 72: Imagine your investment doubling in every two years! Finally, every share of AAPL purchased in 1981 has become 224 shares including a 7/1 split in 2014 and a 4/1 split in 2020. Best stock in the market for long term."
"All time high. No resistance, just blue sky breakout."
"apple was able to hold up very very well today, closed above $153 and new 52 week high was made today. expect momentum to $160"
Higher highs and higher lows…
Looking forward to making satellite calls on my iPhone 13 while driving in my Apple Car while checking my oxygen level on my iWatch while listening on my iPods. How you like dem Apples? Hehe 
"AAPL added about $75 billion to its market cap today. 3% of 2.5 Trillion. Hard to comprehend, more than the market cap of most companies. Amazing. As I said, Sept = new iPhone = MORE profits."
Questions about new satellite feature. Free ? Full service now or maybe latr ? Possible additional Revenue stream or APPL ?
"Breakout, big vol, room to run stochastic, next resist 157.88, then who knows how high. No doubt a $200 stock within 12 months."
