"REITERATE: I was incorrect, no Green Day. HOWEVER, no PPS deflation at EoD as is customary. Good news for the shorter term prospective investors."
Bloomberg supply cut news was a great example of stock market manipulation. It happens over and over again. Learn from this newbies!!
"Guys Apple is here to stay, I don’t understand those who bet against it especially when the smartphones are an extension of our bodies like our limbs are."
It's been a tough 3 months for Apple shareholders. I still think we see $160 by EOY.
"Solid company, solid revenue, solid customer base, solid product mix. My money is safe here. Blips don't bother me with AAPL."
"Nasdaq and AAPL were both up today. Yahoo finance showing both down at closing. VDE was down at closing, Yahoo finance showing VDE up at closing. YAHOO GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER."
"So!After all the crying and moaning here of late, AAPL "" algorithim players"" finally had a breakout 100 to 500% day yesterday.Too many had gotten use to this three times a week over the past year.Sometimes on Fridays, the run has been as high as 1000%.Lately, this $145 head wind has been a real challenge"
Have a NIce Day
"So, here’s what I see happening:1. Apple stock keeps getting pumped with stock buybacks and other ‘strategies’2. “Analysts” keep telling that everything is good3. Tim takes a big pay packet for 20214. In January, Apple gives a warning5. Reports lower than expected sales6. You can use your own thoughts as to what happens next "
Steady as she goes.. up up up
"A preview of a paywalled DigiTimes report set to be published tomorrow states, ""component suppliers for Apple's new iPhones have claimed no cutback in orders thus far this year."" While the news about a cutback in orders may be incorrect, according to suppliers, there is little doubt regarding production challenges for Apple's products."
This site is so full of it. Don’t believe the negative things people text. Buy the dip. It’s what the hedge funds and whales do. I’ve never lost mine with Apple in the 15 years I’ve been trading it. Buy the dips. This is a 150 plus stock
It is option Friday. Let’s hope it can stay above 144.
Ha! 14 % mac sales increased this quarter on top of record iphone orders Ha!! All this on top of the other revenue machine! Ha!
AAPL price action excellent...weekly up-trend still intact. Good Luck
"Tomorrow is Friday, Nothing to drive the stock higher. Nobody cares anymore about AAPL events. So what a new iPad or something. Even the Apple car thing has grown old. Going back to the $130's probably tomorrow."
"Real investors see bad news about a company they hold and do one of two things: nothing, or they buy more. The reason for this is that real investors only hold companies they understand, and they understand that a little bad news doesn’t change the company’s fundamentals or long term outlook."
Monday Oct 18 = Target $145 + $147 + Upgrade
The rally before earnings. Never short AAPL before earnings!
Way oversold on nothing but fake news manipulation. But happens over and over again. Big media is right in on it.
It is no surprise the price did not beat the $143 options play. Just like next week it will not beat the $145 play or the $150 play the following week. Two more weeks in the $140’s then we should have a run. It will need to average just over a dollar a week to see an ATH by year end. I feel good about consumer spending this Fall. I’m sticking to my $160-$165 EOY.
Come back at 11AM and check what's going to happen to AAPL price... 145 or higher
"Very frustrating stock to own. Market tanks, Apple tanks, I get it. But when market takes a moonshot, Apple either yawns or actually goes DOWN. Ahhhhhhhh!!!"
"After judge grants the stay for the Epic litigation (essentially delaying any judgement or decision for years), Monday show-n-go, futures of iCar, VR Googles (2Q 2022), watch and iPod telemetric monitoring and recommendations, iPhone 14 with Sat ... GO AHEAD, SELL NOW! GO TO CASH, don't worry, INFLATION won't take 6+% of year savings!!!"
"Bloomberg reported AAPL will reduce IPhone production by 10 million units. This will be a precursor to their forward guidance at their 10-27 earnings report. I believe the supply chain shortages are underestimated at this time and are going to continue deep into 2022. With a 2.3 trillion market cap, AAPL can’t afford to have any major hiccups to keep up with this enormous market cap. I know AAPL’s PE is cheap at 27.60, however it scares the heck out of me as an AAPL investor that this supply shortage is going to remain deep into 2022."
"Tesla at 832, is 68 points from a all time high. only up 17 percent this year."
Article on Yahoo Finance suggests that Apple is very serious on future production of an EV (electric vehicle). Production plans on beginning in 2024. The planning stages are underway. Is this a game changer for Apple investors ?
Some bash Tim Cook for not doing anything? The new AirPods could be huge next week. Give the man a chance. Job’s didn’t put him there for nothing!
Apple stock usually goes down a few weeks before reporting earnings for some reason. Then earnings come out positive and the stock price rises.Pretty much like clockwork.
the technology stocks correction is over. Microsoft is 1.78 from a all time high. Tesla is 65 points away. now the easy money will be made in the quarter.
Closed at the high of the day on a Fry-day. Next week = Fun week. $AAPL.
Next year will be big due to the carry over of demand
144.19 +0.43 (+0.30%)Pre-Market: 06:00AM EDT
We've been warned for weeks now. Apple finally announces iPhone product cuts due to supply shortages. Earnings will tank. Get ready for stock free fall over upcoming weeks and months
Yes...AAPL stock price will go up forever and you will never die.
The decline from 157 to 140 was due to chip shortage - already priced in.I expect to see GREEN tomorrow if the CPI number was as expected or less.
Why doesnt apple just start makeing their own chips?
So many stop loss orders were filled at $140! Why would u sell?
"Only WS can con people into selling in the middle of 2 Apple new product events heading into a holiday buying season on the heals of 3 record quarters, stock momentum and an iPhone super cycle."
Are we going to hear from Rod Hall or Dan Niles tomorrow? LOL!
"The year is 2027, $AAPL is trading at $429 again and ready for another juicy 4-1 split."
"Anyone who has been paying attention to AAPL's nature, expected yesterday.Why?The last ten trading days, AAPL dipped to $139+ then shortly rallied to $142 - $145, THREE TIMES! WE posted about this the night before; didn't we?ALGORITHIM PLAYERS HAD A GREAT DAY 100 TO 500%.As posted AAPL has traded at $145 and $146 twice...today a third?Fridays are OPTION EXPIRATION anything can happen and does!Have a nice day"
20 forward PE for the greatest brand in history with 100b in annual free cash flow is very undervalued
"The reality is if you played along with DaVinci and Van Gough since Jan 3rd, you already have $40 cash a share in your pockets: $20 closed trades and one $20 open trade. The last play is also open until ..?Go back to Jan 3rd and look for yourself"
This stock will reach 200 dollars a share. Apple will develop the apple car that will destroy tesla. Everywhere I turn I see young people with iPhones.
We will eat Green AAPL Today
"Less than an hour after preorders for Apple Watch Series 7 opened, many options are sold out and won’t arrive until November. Others will ship in two to three weeks, Apple says, though that likely will change soon."
Look at historical prices. Last two times AAPL dipped down to $139+ it rallied to $142 to $144+.Today was the third dipInteresting
This morning: AAPL Reiterated Overweight with a $180 price target at JPMorganAAPL Reiterated Overweight with a $168 price target at Morgan StanleyAAPL Reiterated Outperform with a $170 price target at Baird
Anxious to see if AAPL can tip-toe over the $145 options tomorrow. Doesn’t really matter. She has a clear path to $150 next week.
I am really scared of making tons of cash plus dividends
The perception of scarcity is always good for demand. I think apples sales figures are going to be just fine.
I Am never Selling my Apple Shares. 
As Buffett says Longs want low prices so can add to our positions. I am so adding if there is selling again tomorrow. 20 forward PE?…I’m buyin!
I think the End of the day apple selloff is the most reliable and coolest thing ever...
"Apple (AAPL) is set to host its second big hardware event of the fall on Monday. The virtual event, dubbed “Unleashed,” is expected to spotlight new Mac products powered by Apple’s custom ARM-based processors. This free service can be helpful if want to find the best opportunities to trade and assemble your watch list ahead of the opening bell https://tradepicker.today/TradeSetups"
Retail sentimentalists are selling while the big dogs or aapl it self is buying them shares this is the same song that they been playing for 10 years now on the iPhone demands…Just in a different octave.
"Selloffs by anxious Nellie's at 149 or so, has kept this great stock from reaching at least 160, which is where it should be by now."
"Whoop! Whoop!I just had a nice computer monitor fail. Instead of replacing it, I’m probably going to buy a new iMac. I’ll wait to see what Mr. Cook and company unveils next week. By the by, I know several people who are aching to buy a new Mac after the announcements."
Don’t forget Apple buybacks at these low prices will drive Q1 to another huge beat……and the beat goes on
Those with a short time horizon may as well sell. Investors (those with a time horizon of more than 6 months to a year) stay the course. Apple is a $200 stock.
Hello! MS Katy Hubert’s says buy any dips in Apple! Right before earnings too…omg they r missing it…I’m not….
Love d way it moved today........lets hope best tmrw.
"Oct 12 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) is likely to slash production of its iPhone 13 by as many as 10 million units due to the global chip shortage, Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter."
Pay you fair share in TAXESMr Potato Head just said that again.What is Fair Share ?
Cook has proven to be a “ master”Logistician. This is why Steve Jobs entrusted him.
Games Wall Street plays
"Today just may be the last day that anyone sold covered calls can buy them back at a nice profit.I do not know!All year 71,000 Jan 22 $130 calls ( 7.1 million shares) were sold for $20+ and even when these were selling for $10; they were not closed out.Interesting!"
"If this share price doesn't climb by at least $2 tomorrow, I'm cutting my losses. This stock is a joke."
Longs/smart investors need to look ahead 1-5 years with  apple. $143 is a deal
"Honestly, I regret not selling calls on this last month but my focus was elsewhere. Apple almost always drops in September. I think we’ll likely see a bounce now though. Apple is a master at its supply chain. I think the news about cuts in IPhone production is being put out by the bears and shorts  the big unknown though is how the market reacts to the fed tapering it’s bond purchases in November Honestly I have no idea  perhaps sideways trading for the rest of the year "
The stock is slowly working back up..
Should I sell ?
Do you think $AAPL will be interested in $GOEV?
Breaking news: Apple just announced to hold a special event on October 18th with a tag line “UNLEASHED “ it will take place at the Steve Jobs theater at HQ in Cupertino CA. any guesses? My wishful thinking is Electric Vehicle.
"Anyone buying the dip , I am sure Apple is"
Microsoft is 4 points from breaking out first in the technology stocks.
Apple asked U.S. District Court Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers to issue a stay of her decision in a case over the way Apple operates the App Store. That request seems likely to be granted.…I knew this whole case was a nothing burger. Onward & upward!
Have a great weekend. Turning off my computer now
How many tiles have we seen Bloomberg and Nikki report about production cuts and how many times was it confirmed? it's amazing how the stock reacts to a report about cutting down 10 million phone production.
“Oversold” is the word.
Everyone wants Apple products! Seriously . . . do you think someone is going to switch to FitBit because they have to wait a couple more weeks for the Series 7 Watch? Do you really think an Apple Iphone user is going to switch to an Android because they have to wait 3 more weeks??? Come on people . . . this is not rocket science here!
"Bloomberg stole shares with fake news - everybody look the other way - weak hands, thanks for your 'donation' - this behavior will continue and CNBC will be happy to lend a hand as an accomplice. That said - If you can't get your iPhone 13 for a few weeks due to a chip shortage you're going to what - settle for something you don't want? Hint - high demand products are where you'll see the biggest chip shortage impact - that should be a huge BUY signal. In fact - be weary of any company NOT seeing a chip impact!"
Tik tok posters will need new iPhones to make videos! More upgrades!
"There are various ""tricks"" or actions that some public companies will use or set in motion to pull the wool over the investment community's eyes come earnings season—particularly when a company misses estimates or otherwise disappoints investors. ( AAPL isn't one of them.)"
today was a trading victory for apple. we easily could of been down 4 points on this type of news.
What will happen on Monday ?? Apple Car announcement ???
143 I think tomorrow end of day
 apple has how much money for buy backs? Apple has a huge safety net for investors! Stay long
"Did you know ? Buffett has also described Apple as ""probably the best business I know in the world."" Google it."
"Longs don't be frustrated! Hold on things will get better. The time you get mad and sell is the time apple will breakout, or a big announcement will come and you will say I never should have sold!!"
Uhm yeah!Mac sales increased 14% this quarter add this on top of all the other revenue generators cha chin.
"With 140s now behind us, we begin our trek down to the 130s and into the 120s. Time to take some gains off the table as these supply disruptions will take months or even years to resolve."
apple trading range of 1.14 is the smallest ever in 14 months.
"Back up the truck...""New research claims that while Apple is beginning to feel the impact of the global chip shortage, it is faring better than rivals, and will see substantial market gains as a result of pre-planning.Early on in the global chip shortage, it was suggested that Apple's scale and buying power could mean it would benefit from better component pricing. Later, Apple was still seen as being relatively unaffected, but more recently it has seen availability issues with vital components, such as for the MacBook Pro.Now a new report says again that companies such as Samsung are being harder hit. The Information reports on a study by Wave7 Research that found a marked increase in shortages of smartphone inventory in stores."""
hopefully on October 18 when apple discussed new products the will mention update on auto this is what I am waiting for.!
Let's hope Cook doesn't just release new Macbook colors Monday....
UNLEASHED AAPL! Coming your way soon. Puts must be nervous. Why actually that's just next week.
"Between AAPL AMZN and FB, my portfolio was slobber knockered these last couple of months."
"""iPhone 13 demand has been robust globally,"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said, highlighting strong demand in the United States and China, especially.""Apple will be running into a 5 million-plus iPhone 13 unit shortage for the holiday season if consumer demand keeps up at this pace,"" he added."
"It’s ok to be optimistic, but let’s not lose touch with reality. How many of the 10 million customers will be PERMANENTLY lost to competition? We all know that the holiday season is the worst timing to have supply issues.Apple is going to drag the market down with it."
"What a rigged market. The Evergrande/ US Potential default and other bad news feed on webull is just propaganda to scare you out of your shares. Fed may/ may not taper come November. I say 50/50 % chance of either event occurring. Either way interest stay low until at least end of 2022. In my opinion, I reckon they kick the can down the street a little more to keep their end goal in mind, ""to buy it all- the lender and buyer of last resort"".Do you feel the inflation? Its 6% YoY versus a normal about 2.5% in Pre-Covid. Yield on the SPY is 1.4%, that means real interest rate of -4.6%. Scary to see your losing money either way whether your investing or not. That means the stock market will continue its upward trend, its in their interest to do so. AAPL to $160 EOY"
I get a kick out of Yahoo quoting Rod Hall w/ regard to Apple. Why would you quote the analyst with the WORST possible record when it comes to Apple?
"I mean, Iam repeating myself, but this stock has tripled in two years. Who in his right mind believes this will continue ? This is not Tesla with its enormous untapped potential (highly simplified: everybody owns a smartphone, but very few own an EV).That stock, and the entire sector is due for a correction. But that´s nothing to worry about. Just hold and buy somewhere between after earnings and the end of Q1."
You can’t trade aapl instead you need to hold long term you will lose out by day trading .long term you will make tons of money! You will see few yrs later what the difference will be. Think of it as your retirement fund!
"10th year anniversary of Steve Jobs death, the greatest visionary of all time. I believed in him and invested in Aapl back in 2011, and I added more Aapl at each pullback."
Macbook sales way up. iPhone 13 selling like hot cakes. Apple Watch on the top hot list. VG goggles on the way. iCar in development. iPhone 14 prototypes likely complete and testing with Sat. Sell before Christmas? Hahaha. Go ahead.
145 by EOD!
"I'm not concerned about iPhone sales, which will be fine over a period of 3 quarters into 2022. The market is a roller coaster ride, and there's way too much happening to have a solid grasp on the current chip shortages. The current car market is nuts and I believe if Apple actually comes out with an EV Car this will be very interesting to see."
The greatest stock in the world...that is always down on a green day. You make me laugh!! Longs may need to register for Investing 101
So I'm building a second vacation house on the water. My builder is framing up the structure and soon it will be ready for windows. My builder just informed me today that there is a long delay with the window order now. Do I cancel the order and scrap the project all together?? Come' on Man!! Think!! Apple will be fine. We all will be fine. Stop freaking out and allowing FUD to control your mind ( and actions! ).
Jan 2021 - Reuters said there is an apple car coming - shares went up and then back down because Apple didn’t comment.Oct 2021 - Reuters said apple is set to cut production. Shares down. Banks buy whatever they’ve sold. Back up again in a few weeks.
I don’t get it 1000 containers out to sea no delivery chip shortages but stock is up
"Mark your calendarApple’s conference call to discuss Q421 results is scheduled for Thursday, October 28th at 2pm PT / 5pm ET."
Once a move is made; it stays on the board.While we wanted to suspend this game of chess; we decided to remain.AAPL is undervalued at $150.$160 is our target
Apple should build a mega manufacturing facility in the USA for chip making. Appel depends on other countries too much for manufacturing.
Apple Car in 2024. Apple stock will soar and Tesla will crash.
When it's hard to keep up with demand then it's really a good thing! Investors should be worried if Apple had a lot of iPhones that one wanted to buy. All these naysayers and shorts come here to manipulate the stock by spewing hate and twist the narrative. The bottom line is that when you have an amazing product that everyone wants or needs so that you can't keep up with the demand then it's a great thing because eventually the supply chain will work itself out and Apple will fill all of that pent up demand. These are not lost sales but will be delayed sales because no company in the world makes a product that comes even close to an IPhone. No not even Samsung.
Same thing happens to Apple every couple of years. The do a downgrade and a bad news follows up to lower the price. They repeat this for a month straight until they get the retailers all tired and they sell with a los. Then they bull all the cheap shares out of the blue all good news and plenty of good reviews follow to pump up the price. Welcome to investing 101. I bet you an Apple that one year from now Apple will be over 200. Tesla and Bitcoin are in the Trillion. Apple on the contrary is way mor worth than all these combined!
You can never time apple well. Always hold it in December it will be 180
this is just so billionaires can load up before earnings. dont be tricked.
"$AAPL, $TSLA, $XOM, @REDDITI saw two rumors I wanted comments on.1. XOM has had a discussion with Nio about setting up battery swap stations and using the battery storage to sell back power to the grid in the US.2. $AAPL is considering using the BaaS technology and supporting battery swap in the US to directly compete with Tesla on cars and power.Did anyone else see these in several articles over the past few weeks alluded to?"
Apple does nearly 1 billion in revenue per day. Biggest stock buyback program of 90 Billion.
Is correction over?are we going back over $155?
Wow! AAPL is the best performing FAANG stock this morning. What is the news driving it up?
MSFT and APPL are 2 must own stock for holiday season !
My 2nd largest holding in my portfolio. Apple long 
"New  Apple Watch series 7 available tomorrow. So many positive things going for apple . Longs need to look ahead the next 2-5 years which go fast. Glasses,  next"
Monday redesigned Mac Pros will be a complete game changer. Once one Corp IT dept equipped with M1X Macs starts outperforming their PC competitors then it’s Macs for all….just watch. Jamf is going to be quite busy soon.
Biden is now starting to lose the Stock Market.

"in the market cap race, apple is 2.387 trillion, and Microsoft is 2.287 trillion. only 100 billion dollars lead for apple. expect Microsoft will be the new leader in December."
Didn't Apple a few months increase their iPhone output by 20% earlier this year?Apple announced that!Bloomberg now saying they're cutting - Has Apple announced this?Short term buy - -market manipulation as usual
Apple is a cash machine. $Billions on the quarter. Gotta be crazy to be selling here.Should be buying........
Buy on the dip this morning! Won’t last! Green by closing
Apple will be earnings like they have for years now and the reason why is simple: BUYBACKS. Buying back shares causes a boost to EPS. It’s basic math.
"Got the 13 pro max over the weekend, wife should be here today. Daughter ordered one from Verizon today said Nov 12th. This phone is awesome! Had the 8 . The 5G is everything they say! Faster than my home Wi-Fi."
Predicting Apple ends 2021 at $165. They had a good 4th QTR last year during the middle of Covid. This stock will end the year strong.
A bankruptcy next quarter?Will cash flow be adequate to cover all debt payments for the next 3 quarters?
I really am noticing that every person on tv giving a interview through zoom or whatever is wearing air pods.
"Never sell apple . You cannot time it. Every time I have sold it, I have regretted it. All the millennials own iPhones. They won the race between Android and iPhone. They will get into cars into medical devices into iPhones. Everybody I see has an apple watch"
AAPL nice recovery today. Finish that DC debt headache and it's back over $150. Then initial iPhone orders released and another jump before more holiday sales.
"Apple is for long, buy and hold, don't use it as a day trading stock. I have never been disappointed in the last eight years. I always made money. Apple will be a three trillion-dollar company very soon."
What a board - The Pumpers refuse to accept facts and the Bashers just pander fear. Neither are the friends of us AAPL Longs.
Got my email today announcing special event at Apple. Unleashing! October 18 at 10:00 a.m.
Have a great week
how many dollar left of AAPL's stock buy-back plan ?
Mr Potato Head is going to brief America within the hour
Remember Mr. Cook's company communication concerning leaks? Monday is a product release. Hmmm.
It will turn positive. Nobody can keep apple down

I’m hearing a lot of talk now about STAGFLATION. I think it’s just the typical NEGATIVE FEAR stories that the media loves to pump out to people. I don’t think there will be stagflation. The slowdown in the last two months was because of the surge in the delta variant which has now faded away. As a result I expect the economy to recover. Enjoy!
We all know this will be over 300$ in a couple of years … just hold folks
Longs don’t get spooked and sell tomorrow! Apple  is the biggest best tech company in the world! Will bounce back before end of year! Hopefully you don’t need the money
How many times have we seen “supply doomed” news before earnings? It’s every year for the love..lol…
to the shorts who tried to spread panic yesterday i say better luck next time....I never believe the rumors out there about apple...never
Very strong support at 139$
AAPL should be low hanging fruit for buyers. From mid July RSI strength is 50% discounted and OVERSOLD. July RSI 80.5 for July 42.5 for today. Don't sell !!
Stock has no life. A one day pop stock. 300 point Dow. Flat Apple. There are better opportunities.
The good news is that stock already discounted any bad news that may come up in the Earning Call release in two weeks. I expect them to beat sales and profit estimates but also mention some chip shortage for Q4 sales which is already known.
Stock will finish flat.
"Knee Jerk reaction; we longs will be fine, Apple always grows and makes new highs."
This will test under 120s…I am also not that optimistic with the earnings data coming soon..let’s see..some buying opportunity may become but for now I am out..
"long term investor, best investment you could make looking to the future, don't trade , invest."
At $146.65 AAPL is going to generate the STRONG Buy SignalPlease check this techn by yourself
here is the issue. apple is up 383 percent for the last 5 years. Microsoft is up 417 percent for the last 5 years. we only appreciate if Microsoft goes up. we desperately need Microsoft to break out of the 306 range for apple to start moving.
When apple  is $200 next year $143 will look cheap! Lots will say why didn’t I buy it when it was in the $140s!!
"Being the board historian, over the years I have noticed “ tells” in option market just before major stock moves up or down.Last week, It was there ,once again, as clear as anyone can see. A chef does not give away his recipe when serving his signature dish."
So did it make any sense to sell AAPL at $139.30-139.50? recently?
Added…must make the most of opportunity as I’m sure Apple buybacks are too.
There is always the potential for the unexpected and the what-if the announcement catches every current and potential investor worldly off guard. What could be announced that changes many and everything and send the share price sky-high:Apple carOver the air wireless chargingApple and Tesla joining technologies
"Here we go again, 2 weeks before earnings and the usual suspects are coming out with negative stuff like supply chain issue!"
I believe AAPL is going through a transition phase. I see their share price easily doubling by early next year. I think AAPL is worth $350 right now. ALL telcos are pushing their products and making them affordable for anyone. I’m long AAPL and they are my number one pick for the next 12 months.
apple will crashbelow $110 by dec 2021 and below $60 in 2022 worst more cuts coming in 2022 and2023 . hugehugeblow to apple cutting 13 million iphone production due to supply chain issue in 2021 .worst is still to come more cuts coming in 2022 and2023 worst is no becausesupply issue will last for 2 more year expert say
Buy Program on AAPL => towards December = NO SELL
Market cap absolutely meaningless number but fascinating to lesser investment minds. In any event because of Apple buyback frenzy Msft most definitely will pass Apple market cap and Google will prob pass Apple too. Secretly great for Apple as takes the spotlight off of them. Nobody cares to take down the #2 or #3 hitter they want the cleanup guy
News Flash on my iPhone...Special AAPL Event on Oct 18 10:00 am PDT
Buy apple. You will see it at 180 in december
oh no dipped red now all the negative Nancy's will come out from under their rock
"Two money men told me 20 yrs ago if you have to rely on news and brokers (analyst) don't try it, the market. Study for yourself and know the product and its worth. Since I have been going up on my own."
You don’t sell stock in a company whose product is in such high demand the global supply chain cannot make it fast enough due to a global pandemic — you accumulate it for dear life
Bloomberg: $AAPL may ship 10 million less iPhone 13s in 2021 due to chip shortage (of 80 million if I remember the total).
"Reminds of when the stock was at $116, this will pass too and either way Apple will be much higher next year. Anything under $150 is a good price to won Apple and under $140 is a steal for long term hold. BTW, what happened to the 10 year? no one talks about it anymore. LOL"
"2 weeks ago was the rates, this week is the supply chain, what will it be next week? back to inflation or rates? LOL"
I would not be surprised tomorrow if it goes up!
"To bad Elon Musk isn't the CEO of Apple. He has vision and the capability to get things done. Apple seems to lack this in its management. Look at Titan compared to Tesla. Apple is still ""working"" on their version. Tesla is producing and selling cars. Titan no where to be seen. iGlasses compared to SpaceX. glasses hinted at SpaceX changing the world. The list goes on and on. Apple plays it safe. Anything with Elon Musk is cutting edge."
Katy says to buy any supply chain dips on Apple….never doubt Katy Hubert’s…she’s saying this two weeks before earnings!
"AAPL Special Event on Oct 18, 1000 hrs PDT"
"One thing is for sure, Apple never gets the respect they deserve based on the machine they are, no one even comes close to them! Its been pike this for the last 20 years, just look at their numbers."
Someone said it correctly.$145 today may be a headwind but next week $150 is clear sailing

Eventually you hit the core holders and they will not sell for anything so suddenly the selling stops or we hit bottom. Which is around 140. I am one of those core holders.
"Just was at the mall in vancouver bc.checked out telus and rogers and an apple store.both wireless stores have iphone 13 max and pro to buy with a plan but only in 1 TB models.They wont sell them for cash though.both the telcos and apple stores had iphone 13 and mini in stock.The telco guy said they have max and pro but with a plan only.Apple supplies the telcos first,before the apple store.Makes sense most phones are bought through the telco stores with a plan.so because theres a 6 week wait for a phone to ship direct to you from apple only means that the telcos have gotten first dibs .If you would have ordered your new max a day or two after preorders opened youd have yours.All the telcos ordered millions on day of preorder,first come first serve.now you cry that theres a 6 week wait,an blame it on a chip/ component shortage……..funny.Apple ordered 90 million phones,they got 90 million phones coming .Are you gonna phone tim cook and say sorry mr cook we couldn’t fulfill your order.dont think so.Cook said every quarter so far that shortages MAY affect the shipments,has apple showed any miss on earnings……no in fact 30-40% beats.keep the faith.Cook doesnt blow smoke or give positive guidance smoke screens,not his style.Apple earnings speak from themselves."
