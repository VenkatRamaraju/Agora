"How can Apple be considered any less valuable due to supply constraints? Eventually, Apple will reap the same revenues and margins, if not even better as soon as chips become readily available. Remember, the demand is overwhelming for their products and only the best of the best can say that."
"AAPL's loyal following will NOT switch to PCs or different manufactures phones, tablets, music, video, etc.They'll wait for inventory for as long as it takes. AAPL is building a GIGANTIC Sales Backorder pipeline.You don't trade AAPL, but buy and hold AAPL."
Expect a close around 150 and a march forward to 155 in November!
So Apple on Tuesday Sept 28th announces their earnings release date for today. They didn’t even let the quarter finish before announcing the date. Still had 3 days left in the quarter and iphone 13 was just released. Very interesting.
Today is a great opportunity to add or open…this is complete clueless selling lol…but emotions control the short term that’s for sure
"Apple returned $24 billion to shareholders in the quarter, with $20 billion coming via the repurchase of 137 million shares and $3.6 billion coming the form of dividend payments. This is one of many reasons to own Apple."
Sold today at 153.16. Will buy back when it falls below 100
Apples numbers don’t come out until like 4:30
Any serious investor should listen to the Earnings call. The growth they talk about is incredible. This supply issue will go away and they will continue on without losing any sales. Just deferred.
FB missed on revenue and it rallied.Majority of stocks have also rallied after earnings. Earnings are after hours on Thursday
Apple miss on earnings by 0.22% but up 29% YoY. The punishment from the market is beyond me. Every other indicator is positive including that its costing them less to make and ship their iDevices. Their GM's are up. Anyway ..... lets see what the balance of this year and the next brings.
"Time to Load up before market close, We are going for $160+ in 2 weeks."
AAPL is an Incredible undervalued company among Big Tech.
options say that the apple move will be only 4.17 points in either direction. very muted.
So funny how most of the time there is selling after earnings and events. No matter what is presented lol….this is an excellent report with great guidance while dealing with a soon to be fixed temporary issue.
"Apple’s supply issues are temporary, so buy the dip, JPMorgan says….CNBC"
"LTC, BTC and ETH amongst others just be giving joy, Earn in dollar, save in crypto. Never forget that"
Apple had a record quarter and the stock gave back a little AH because of TEMPORARY supply issues. Demand is still very very strong according to Tim and a record holiday quarter is forecast. Stock will be trending higher as supply gets back up which is inevitable
Gene Munster says Apple will grow Sales by 10% in 2022!!! That means a big earning growth per share.
Apple reiterated Outperform with a $180 price target at Evercore ISIApple reiterated Overweight with a $175 price target at Piper SandlerApple reiterated BUY with a $175 price target at UBSApple price target raised to $170 from $165 at OppenheimerApple reiterated BUY with a $170 price target at Citi
"I bought the 150 puts for a dollar, now up 500%. Assuming Apple opens up at $145 tomorrow."
Volume tells that almost everyone who sold yesterday is back in. We’ll be back on track next week. Have a nice weekend.
When you sell your shares of Apple just remember that it’s most likely Apple buying those shares through their MASSIVE BUYBACK PROGRAM and those shares will never see the market ever again!!!Enjoy!
"Apple's gross margin on products was 34% last quarter, their gross margin on services was 70%. It's not hard to figure out which sector is going to get more attention going forward."
Oh no! Apple only received $83.36 billion in revenue. Everyone panic!
Who knows. The last three record quarters resulted in the stock going down after earnings. But I will say that tim and Luca also had at least one negative thing to say all three times that was the cause of the stock not rallying after earnings.
"Long here. The past 5 yrs. the stock is up 420%. Since the mid 80s up 116,000% according to Yahoo max performance chart."
I'm debt free today because of my trading with mrs RICKY VASQUEZ She is reliable and trustworthy her platform has changed my life and I'm a testimony today contact her on Facebok page (RICKY VASQUEZ)
Look at the five day chart. Doctor my eyes it's still Green.
Hey Neal? Why do u constantly promote Msft and Tesla here while talking very very little and mostly negative about Apple? This is Apple conversation board not Msft or Tesla. Now they have their own conversation boards over there Sir. That’s where u need to be. Please stop promoting your stocks and cluttering up the boards here.
"Been buying apple  stock for over a year now! Could have sold and took a $95K profit only to chase in a month or two, what to gain a few shares? Nope! Just holding. 2022-2023 will be over $200 then maybe I’ll shave some. Hold long sleep well."
Apple missed earnings estimate in May 2017. It climbed after that in just a few days.
"Earnings call is going to be massive, TC and the team will deliver today!"
"Competition for chips. You would think they could figure it out . However, I will never sell Apple. It’s a long term investment. Will buy more tomorrow. Keep the faith and good sense longs !"
"The ER is promising, with hopeful comments from the management. I like it! Definitely a stock to keep preciously and accumulate patiently. Huge buy backs, big and sound growth, huge margins, this is a luxury company not yet with the appropriate valuation."
It was all about accumulation today. People will forget their numbers and buy buy buy ahead of dividend.
Back to ATH by end of the year - bears have been screaming sell since 120 and lower and they’ve been wrong on every metric - giving supply chain issue Apple actually had a great quarter
"I will buy 1000 shares this morning , this is a perfect time for Apple to buy back there shares and you know they will and Warren Buffett will be buying also so why shouldn’t we buy."
"Apple price target raised to $170 from $165 at Oppenheimer 06:36 AAPL Oppenheimer analyst Martin Yang raised the firm's price target on Apple to $170 from $165 and keeps an Outperform rating on the shares. Apple's Q4 again broke historical records again, with Mac and Services at all-time highs, and other categories reaching a Q4 high despite supply constraints that impacted sales by $6B in the quarter, Yang tells investors in a research note. While supply crunch remains a headwind for the next couple of quarters, Yang expects Apple will accelerate its share gains due to its superior supply chain management and scale advantage."
"So, basically all the doom & gloom from yesterdays comments set AAPL back to it's position from 2 days ago ! Big deal.........."
"Wish ALL my stocks reported such ""disappointing"" financials as AAPL. Only $83.4B revenue and only up 29% from a year-ago!!!!!"
"Apple up 2.5% , after market down 3%............almost a wash, flat, relax ........nothing to see here......hold and enjoy"
"At 7:30 PST 150 calls were .02, at 9:55 PST they were .29, what a return. I bought and sold only 100 calls, wish had more."
Supplying chips for over 40 million iPhones for the quarter is a lot different than supplying chips for only 240k Tesla’s
"Yesterday was a complete overreaction. Today Apple has gained back most yesterday's paper losses. Why? Because there is a supply issue, but the demand issue is still sky high! Count the Apple products that you use every day. We have a two person household with (2) iPhone 12's, (1) MacPro. (1) IPAD Pro, (1) AirPod and (1) Apple watch and AppleTV+. That is (7) products in one small household."
"Shorties are nervous by now. If they don't cover in the next hour, they will lose big after hours. MILLENIALS have been buying Apple products and stocks. 170-180 after hours. APPL new level will happen. AAPL is heading 200 even number. Classic!!....AMZN, WDC also will beat based on my machine learning."
"Apple made billions of dollars every quarter, so this quarter they made a few billion less money. No big deal. The problem is when everyone gets all the supplies from one country. CHINA. Apple is not day trading stock stay long."
Chip shortage is to be blamed for Apple not being able too deliver/sell the cell phones. The fact they can not keep up with the demand should bode well for the company as the shortage dissipates and the pent up hunger for new phones drives the sell higher...time to buy.
"Sold all amazon shares, 20 total, & added to apple. Tired of waiting."
Manipulation at its best that’s what wall street does. All things considered Apple reported solid revenue and EPS and guidance was as usual. Cook needs to start looking at producing their own chips and move away from China.
It’s a chip related miss. What a great time for Apple to buy back its stock.. Especially knowing￼ that there is a bright future.
"ok, seems like every time they report the stock runs up prior, but after the report the stock usually goes down for a week or two. if history repeats itself, i say it's lower after the bell?"
"Da Vinci1 second agoEPS: $1.24 vs. $1.24 estimated Revenue: $83.36 billion vs. $84.85 billion estimated, up 29% year-over-year iPhone revenue: $38.87 billion vs. $41.51 billion estimated, up 47% year-over-year Services revenue: $18.28 billion vs. $17.64 billion estimated, up 25.6% year-over-year Other Products revenue: $8.79 billion vs. $9.33 billion estimated, up 11.5% year-over-year Mac revenue: $9.18 billion vs. $9.23 billion estimated, up 1.6% year-over-year iPad revenue: $8.25 billion vs. $7.23 billion estimated, up 21.4% year-over-year Gross margin: 42.2% vs. 42.0% estimate"
"Never sell Apple. It is the type of stock to pass on from generation to generation. Amazing business model, amazing company."
"Supply-Chain Issues Bite Apple, Likely To Get Worse This Quarter. tough time but we longs will be fine starting next year"
Nobody is taking the market cap  crown from apple 
"Here’s how Apple did versus consensus estimates: EPS: $1.24 vs. $1.24 estimated Revenue: $83.36 billion vs. $84.85 billion estimated, up 29% year-over-year iPhone revenue: $38.87 billion vs. $41.51 billion estimated, up 47% year-over-year Services revenue: $18.28 billion vs. $17.64 billion estimated, up 25.6% year-over-year Other Products revenue: $8.79 billion vs. $9.33 billion estimated, up 11.5% year-over-year Mac revenue: $9.18 billion vs. $9.23 billion estimated, up 1.6% year-over-year iPad revenue: $8.25 billion vs. $7.23 billion estimated, up 21.4% year-over-year Gross margin: 42.2% vs. 42.0% estimated"
I think in 6 month we will be looking at a $3 trillion evolution and a stock price approaching $180-$200.
I don’t think Apple will give up its throne that easily
"$38.87 billion: iPhone (up 47% YOY)$9.18 billion: Mac (Up 1.6% YOY)$8.25 billion: iPad (Up 21.4% YOY)$8.79 billion: Wearables, Home, and Accessories (Up 11.5% YOY)$18.28 billion: Services (Up 25.6% YOY)"
Nice if we end green as it would show investors get it….Apple quarter was awesome and supply stuff will be fixed
"The supply chain is not an Apple issue, this is a global problem. Still, Apple came out with good results. Stay long."
"Let’s examine last July.July 2,,,,$137,27July 26..$148,99July 27..,$146.77July 28,,,$144.98July 27 was earnings. I believe before conference call, AAPL IN after hours was $153. Then Cook spoke!Before earnings, we posted “Do not play options.” Hundreds of millions were wiped away.Let’s fast forward, Oct 4....$$138.27Oct 27...today’s closeOct 28....tomorrow Once again, we posted Do not play options BUY $157+ in after hours It’s all about what Cook says for Oct 29"
"Dan Ives:….While the bears will hang their hats on this supply chain issue and a valuation that has re-rated saying the Apple bull party is over, instead we could not disagree more and view any sell off as a buying opportunity given our robust view of Cupertino’s product cycle demand story into 2022."
People who got angry and sold this morning be like
Why does chip shortage only affect Apple and not Microsoft?
"Invest accordingly: Senior leadership and a complaint board delivered the following to investors - Paid out $4,000,000,000 cash to competitor T-Mobile plus some valuable wireless spectrum as a ""break up"" fee when the DOJ forbid their merging. Built out UVERSE with hundreds of millions in capital only to have eschewed pursuit of Direct TV until such time as their share price had risen from the mid-30s to $80+. Then the debt wagon was brutally loaded by purchasing Warner Media for $85,000,000,000 and after only three years is being dismantled. When the announced consolidation with Discovery comes to pass and the sacred dividend is slashed in half without clarity of value inherent to the spin-off, should the investors simply shrug their shoulders as shares continue their ongoing steep decline? ( Reminiscent of GE under Mr. Immelt and team. )"
"The bright side. All misses chip shortage related. We’re good going forward. “I” do not try to “time the market” or any particular stock such as Apple. I am an investor not a gambler. Buy, hold, and add when you can (like now) to Apple. It’s simple as a INVESTOR."
"""Bad"" news just as Apple intends to buy back an amount of its outstanding shares. Load more if you read between lines."
"YTD: AAPL +14%, NASDAQ +18.8%, MSFT +43%. AAPL will have to trade at $158. to catch up to the Nasdaq Index. Let's see how the market reacts tomorrow night?It's anybody's guess. Hedge your portfolios. Good luck to everyone."
So material shortage cost Apple $6B and no fault of companies operation. This is one time item and should be ignored by shareholders.
AAPL will crater today and take down rest of market with it. These supply disruptions could last 1-2 yrs. Disappointing earnings till 2023?
So they sold everything they could make 40% more revenue with no sign of slowing down . Seems good to me.
"I see nothing in this statement from Apple that says buy the stock…“The company expects an even greater impact from supply constraints during the current quarter, Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said”"
buy buy before hedgies cover. They'are toast. There is not time left for their games. AAPL 170-180 after hours. Apple site traffic rose a lot in the last 3 months...buy in mass. Use margin to wipe our hedgies...MILLENIALS are buying at any pullback. ...also expect WDC to pop today earnings

"obviously there are more buyers than sellers today. opened at 147.22 , now 149.02. apple will close at the high of the day."
So earnings came and earnings passed no real change in stock price and we put the supply chain issues behind us.
It was planned to announce Apple TV to Comcast on the day of earnings! Perfect storm finally
Relax. The earnings report is actually great. I'd bet we'll see 160-180+ in no time. We longs have all the time of the world.
"While the value of one's home typically accounts for most of the net worth of the average individual, most of the affluent and very rich generally have the majority of their wealth invested."
"I should have sold off today, I'd bought it too high from the jump.....I think this is the reason why they haven't been looking good for ppl to buy. But the good news is supply chain problems won't last forever."
How many Sellers (retailers) folded just yesterday & today alone? They even may have had good intentions of becoming longs. UNBELIEVABLE
"So we move 6 Billion into next quarter . . . yawn. Bottom line, it was yet ANOTHER record quarter. VERY solid numbers. Now Amazon, on the other hand . . . THAT was a MISS!"
Apple waits. Apple let’s others(Tesla) release their products first. All the while getting it’s supply chain and components ready. Then after enough time of analyzing what works and doesn’t work Apple then released its superior product. It’s an awesome business model perfected by Apple.
"It is amazing to see the number of people that only have one stock in their portfolio. To me,that is not a good idea."
Got some upgrades today. It's a great problem Apple has. Too many customers and not enough supply. It''ll be just fine.
This was apples  price Monday! Got too excited over $150! Relax longs look at the 5 year chart if your holding long you never loose
Munster: 2021 supply pain is 2022 sales gain….and still Apple to have record Holiday quarter!
Don’t under estimate Tim Cook! Apple  is probably working on some really cool stuff that will come out within the next couple years. Question is will you be invested wisely with apple  when those announcements are made? Cook will become a hero!
We posted Big Boys needed $150 last nightIntra day high was $149.91.Knowing that and you just sold Oct 29 $150 puts you pocketed $400.If you bought $147 calls at open you made $250+.I just checked 95% of Oct 29 puts and calls closed red from yesterday’s close. We did post “Do not play Oct 29 options”I bet hundreds of millions was erased
Short term pain for long term gainStill Bullish on Apple
"Now the run NORTH resets. Doubtme? Check in with mid-Dec. $AAPL history repeats, always. Long and Strong!"
"You see the problem with Msft Neal is that Msft currently is 40% more risky then Apple. Also everyone is starting to see how lucrative cloud computing is and they are starting to allocate tremendous capital towards it like Google/Oracle/IBM etc.,..that’s a big risk. Now Apple on the other hand is past that. Everyone tried already to topple Apple including Microsoft but they all failed. I’m not sure if they will all fail in cloud computing. So you basically own a high PE stock with perfection priced in that everyone is gunning for…..better be careful Sir."
"Sure,did investors forget last q1?huge beats,crushed revenue by billions first time apple was over 100 billion,111 i think ,eps was 1.70s when analysts said 1.30s,apple crushed it and stock fell 8 bucks i think.anyways the point is apple is a great investment and makes everyone money over decades.services grew 18% ish,and thats 70% profit.the valuation solely on iphone is just old school thinking,in a big new world of services and 70% profit margins.Apple to 160 by december."
Hope the blowout earnings and revenues and a somewhat positive guidance will propel it to 160
Honestly I’m huge in Apple. A miss wouldn’t be a big deal for me. Just means my dividends buy back more shares. The only ones who care about these short term moves are TRADERS. Whatever supply chain issues Apple MIGHT have are only TEMPORARY!Enjoy!!!
Down less than 2%. AAPL is king!
$20 billion in buybacks last quarter. $66 billion net cash position. 29 percent top line growth. The best consumer product company of all time. I am holding on these shares for years to come.
Tesla up 10 in after hours. it is basically a broken slot machine that keeps on paying off.
"I have 300+ shares of AAPL at 150.50 avg since a couple of months. It’s been red since I bought.Wanted to sell after the earnings report at probably 154-155 range today, but now it’s going back to 145 after hours.Feels like a prison and there is no way out. I’m a small guy and am stuck with apple. "
"As I said early today, I'm watching this thing go GREEN. Still at $149+, but we'll be there."
Great fundamentals and great company. Any short term weakness ow a gift.
If we cross $160 AH and tomorrow - I’m going for a short vacation 
Wow...... AAPL @ $149.... hasn't been this low since...... Tuesday ;)
"Analysts, on average, expect Apple to post adjusted earnings of $1.24 per share and revenues of $84.79 billion for fiscal Q4.Meanwhile, the Earnings Whisper number, or the Street’s unofficial view on earnings, stands at $1.35 per share."
Ok so we all know how bad supply is. We get it. It’s terrible and the news is out so what’s next?….supply starts returning to normal and the stock rallies every day with the news. Now is the time to add.
"Market consensus is this is a buying opp, for the most deserving name in the market"
Super Undervalued by any means with AAPL still trading in about same range as 2020's. Can't see this not reaching at least $200 by 2022.
Why would anyone short the worlds greatest brand and competitive moat with a 22 forward PE and 190b in cash and with their greatest innovative products ever lining up for the next 2-3 years? It boggles the mind
$155 on Monday!
