ASTS will be this week's Meme stock with the $AAPL $GSAT news$15 tomorrow ...$20 plus by Friday
I don’t know how I ever traded without using (http://Thetraderguide.com)! I look forward to their daily emails each morning that list pre-market movers based on thoroughly researched stock market and world news. I highly recommend anyone who invests in the stock market!
Apple has been consolidating for the last 6 weeks (7/12)Beautiful breakout after long consolidation!!!
Told you. Will be 175 by product announcement then drop back a little
September 1st ?? Thumbs up for green apples. Thumbs down for red apples.
Got my order in for a Candy “Apple” Red 2-seater Apple sports car. Hehe 
Be prepared for Ron Hall to recommend selling because it’s going to high!
"So nw I have to pay a $9 to pickup my new phone today, tomorrow it is free and it is also free to ship.My message is getting deleted for no reasonToday 10:30am - 12:30pm — $9.00Tomorrow — FreeDelivery with Setup — Free"
bump is due to Epic vs APPL case verdict whispers that is supposedly favorable to APPL.
Just A picture or information leaks of an Apple car will unlimited skyrocketed  the share Price 
"Wedbush predicts stocks will rise until year end. Keep buying tech stocks, no other place to get yield."
"We may drop a little now, but the iPhone 13 event and Epic verdict later this month will cause another pop."
"Breakout, big vol, room to run stochastic, next resist 157.88, then who knows how high. No doubt a $200 stock within 12 months."
Allowing 3rd party apps? Meaningless as Apple will just collect its platform hosting commission another way. Whatever the outcome Apple still gets paid. Hey becdd see use of this they may come up with something Thant even increases profits. But worst case scenario is no impact.
Apple supplier Luxshare reports record growth after securing iphone 13 orders….Apple just crushin it
Apple needs to close above 153-154 on Friday to confirm this breakout!
No pre-market works bestThen gap at open higher
"apple was able to hold up very very well today, closed above $153 and new 52 week high was made today. expect momentum to $160"
"Lifetime stock. Like a mint classic car or a family estate, this will one day be my heirs mega fortune to decide what to do with. You ‘buy a lambo’ or a ‘private island’ dreamers will one day figure out how real wealth is created over decades and that once you consider the future of the important people in your life as a primary goal you’ll make sane investment choices."
A question!Would a farmer prefer a steady stream of water or an occasional down pout?What fills a bucket quicker: a leaky faucet or sudden thunderstorm?This is basis for AAPL’s nature.We can climb a mountain and yell echoing ourveirds. ASPL will still be AAPL
"Apple another 52 week high!! Can you say $3 Trillion Market Cap!!!!!!!!!!!! $FB also keep climbing!!!***Americans Spent More than $16.5 Billion on Cosmetic Plastic Surgery in 2018***ACRX game changing NEWS out today, under the RADAR, heads up, read it,SST is ACRX's FDA approved drug!ACRX only NON Invasive (under the tongue, NO IVs & Rapid Acute Pain drug in the WORLD:https://ir.acelrx.com/static-files/1c3085a7-9163-4874-8c8c-18d0507bc75bSlide 19: DSUVIA is the world's only RAPID / NON-INVASIVE (NO IVs) Acute Pain DrugStudy Results Announced During Award-Winning Presentation on the Effect of Sufentanil Sublingual Tablet on Outpatient Plastic Surgery at the Annual Miami Cosmetic Surgery EventHAYWARD, Calif., Aug. 30, 2021""Dosing a single preoperative SST allowed us to avoid any additional analgesic administration during both the intraoperative and recovery periods, which resulted in these patients being ready for discharge almost immediately following these fairly lengthy procedures,"" states Dr. Seify.

Apple is the company to own ! I wish I held my original shares the first time I bought it in the eighties ! Big mistake of my life ! However I own a lot of shares in it now and will keep adding with dividend purchases ! Hopefully this will keep going up and my children and grandchildren will be happy
Solid day as we inch closer to new IPhone release and big pop. Vamos!!
I’m changing my position to divd reinvest. I’m ten years it will be worth $25k
"As history bears out again, August is usually a good month for Apple's stock price."
Go iPhone 13
AAPL TO $200s
"On a lark, I bought for my granddaughter, at her request , (age 10) 60 AAPL shares at 36. She can now pay her $75,000 a year college tuition with its present value( and all those splits) We sold some, bought at last split up 20% and are holding for the longer term, still a great buy."
"If you are long term investor in AAPL, like me, Goldman Sachs has been brilliant .....time and time again, for giving me an opportunity to add to my Apple holdings.........:)"
Apple and Amazon to the moon
Another strong finish today
Does this mean we get to bypass AT&T and Verizon? LOL
"Five and half dollars up for the month, $1.30 a week.A good August."
Most haters & bashers are acting out of jealousy & regret. Somewhere along the way they missed outon buying apple and are now venting their frustrations in the only way they know how. Just ignore thenoise and HOLD.
If Apple loses payment processing fees then they should just start charging more for maintaining the platform and for app makers to put their apps in the store. If the developers don’t like it then they can put their apps on Erickson phones or Xoami and other independent OS not Apple or android. And if phones start to get hacked and user data is leaked from other poorer payment systems who have cyber security issues then I suggest buying cyber security stocks in your respective country.
"If you're long AAPL , don't worry...This is nothing...Don't waste your time with the board Haters...Stocks go up and stocks go down...It will keep growing as long as the world economies grow...I have a feeling most of you only have a few hundred shares at most, anyway...Chill out...""A watched pot never boils""."
Next Stop . . . $155 . . .
Over 3T MC by this time next year.
Apple iPhone 13 will have satellite capabilities enabling users to send texts to first responders and report accidents in areas without cell coverage
"All time high. No resistance, just blue sky breakout."
"I am keep reminding you guys that you just do not bet against "" the best company in the world"" , don't sell now because it will go much higher and stay away for few years and will be rewarded and will be glad you did !!!"
"Any chance Apple may finally gobble up SiriusXM? They already have satellites in position and Apple would gain a bunch of new content to deliver directly to the upcoming AppleCar as well as other iDevices. Plus, they would immediately gain 34.5 million paid subscribers. Not sure if those satellites are capable of sat phone service, though, or if they would need to deploy other sats to handle."
iPhone 13 connects to satellite-cellular-system = REVOLUTION in ITGL2ALL
ASTS (AST Space Mobile Inc.) is the true niche play for satellite mobile like $AAPL $GSAT $IRDMAnalyst price target $30 SP $12This is the squeezer
AAPL hits new high at $152.25!
"Overall, with 26 analyst reviews on record, split into 19 Buys, 5 Holds, and 2 Sells, AAPL has a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The shares are priced at $150.38 and their $162.32 average price target suggests ~8% upside from that level."
South Korea passes bill limiting Apple and Google control over app store payments.The South Korean government has voted to force Apple and Google to accept alternative payment in the App Store.How bad is this? Didn't Apple just make such a deal with developers?
Don’t complain it’s over $150
"Whether you are an investor in Apple or not, this company has got to be close if not past 2.7 trillion by now.￼ based on their future products there’s no doubt in my mind they will reach 3 trillion soon. Again, whether you like them or not, I see another split in the future.￼￼"
This stock can never hold a gain more than a day.
btig chief us market strategist julian emanuel says there is very good chance to see at least a 10% correction in september
uh oh. it's all downhill from here.
Ripping!
"So, I am curious. Who is actually selling apple shares?"
Latest poll just out shows Newsom losing by 5%
Apple car will be introducing soonSo stay tuned for more
"I see a lot of posts from long term holders. I wish I was one, I wish I bought 20 years ago. Anyway, for those who have that long term perspective who do you think are the Apples of today that are just starting? thanks"
JPM ups AAPL price target to $170.Citing 5G iPhone SE expectations.
apple going to use satilites using the 13 phone platform pretty cool  going to be using gsat for satilites according to apple analyst
every person that is stuck in hurricane with cell or power is thinking apple satellite connectivity is my next buy.i phone 13.first to market with satellite mean more people stuck in ecosystem.this was genius to be first in an hurricane was big message board.god bless all involved with ida.
"I went to mall to get new iphone,there was a line around the mall waiting,could not believe it,i said when i get back home am going to buy 1000 shares at least,this is a excellent investment"
"Since a few of you asked how I could be up total portfolio today of over 1% while taking a beating in ZM (and buying more ZM this morning!!) - my 4 losers today were #ZM #AAPL #COIN and #ME - my winners were #SDC #LL #HOTH #CNK #BABA #F #PRVB #VAL #GE #DAL #DD #MRNA and #DEN Ironically, I like, most of the time, to keep the PEG around 1… last week I was almost all in and needed to free up some cash, so I sold all the stocks outside of near 1 PEG or below… EXCEPT ZOOM! Oh well, I’m still a believer at these levels!!"
breakout in progress.
Green by close
$3 trillion market cap coming
I love days like today.
Let’s have an Apple Rally for Cook’s 10th Anniversary today with Apple————> America’s most iconic company. Hombre’s been a fantastic custodian of the company and created fabulous wealth for us shareholders. Second stock to put me into two commas. 
Satellite Service = Brilliant!!!!
"Joe,Go back and read posts just before AAPL made the move from $125 to now.We posted “ It’s time” way before Wall Street."
I remember people saying the fair value for apple is $70 
The App Store settlement is very important win for Apple. Now the uncertainty is pretty much over. The Epic trial judge has to sign off on this agreement. As long as Developers are in agreement then the govt will be too.
"Apple + GSAT= satellite technology, zero dropped calls and quicker 5G connection."
"better check the greed and book profit now while prices are elevated, very heavy market correction coming"
Munster still have a year end price of $200?
"It’ll close green. People know that Apple is, was, and will always be the only sure bet."
"td101, you are officially retired. apple has more significant news coming in September. this is the Run to 200 now."
It's really hard to stay exited about my day job when every 1% rise in Apple is more than my entire month's paycheck LOL.
"$GSAT jumped 65% on news that $AAPL IPHONE 13 will include Satellite capability. Don't they need someone to put it in Orbit? Space X is busy with ISS, $ASTR can't get a rocket off of earth.. that leaves you with $RKLB with consistency...."
'iPhone 13' Apple Event date & launch timeline revealed by leakerhttps://appleinsider.com/articles/21/08/26/iphone-13-apple-event-date-launch-timeline-revealed-by-leaker
"So now, if Epic doesn’t pass on the savings to us gamers, we can band together and sue Epic."
Closing near high. Love the move
Congratulations Tim Cook on your 10th anniversary as CEO of Apple. Apple stock performance under your directorship 1020%. Not too shabby!
3 months ago 'Apple 150 EOY' was laughed at. This will be a 10T company within the next 5 years. OK - you can start laughing again.......
Apple is still the safest stock to invest.
Quit splitting the stock and then turn around and spend shareholders profits on buying back shares. How about raising the dividend for a change......at least we get something better than a few pennies once a year. Better that than having the stock sit in neutral after 3 outstanding quarters. This is getting real OLD!
"guys - apple iPhone satellite . come on, give some respect. this needs to be 3.5T company on just this news. and then iCars  - another 1T. total of 4.5T. on top of that Jay Powell is a big fan of APPL products, he may buy some from his monthly $120B. lots of tail wind"
Lithium ion battery Nobel prize winner expects Apple Battery and overall Apple Car news by year end
Both HP and Dell are already reporting chip shortages will hurt sales for the remainder of the year along with having to raise prices. This may help Apple in regards to pricing equity. Tim Cook is making sure Apple has plenty of supply to meet decent demand. I would really enjoy hearing about a shortfall in sales of Windows desktops and laptops. This may be one of the best chances for Apple to gain even a little bit of market share. Apple's computers don't use standard RAM modules and Apple motherboards use less semiconductor components in general. It would be great if Apple could sell a couple of million more desktops and laptops combined to close out the year. I'm not saying anything is guaranteed but we'll know by the time the holiday season rolls around. TSMC stated Apple will be their top client and after that the auto makers will be a priority. There by will be plenty of fighting for components among all the Windows PC manufacturers and some are already feeling the pinch for back-to-school computer components. Apple needs to step up its marketing push. Apple Silicon has to gain traction before Intel and AMD catch up with their own ARM silicon. I hope six months will be enough time for Apple to get a solid lead.
"iPhone is now a satellite phone. finally, it would be worth the price apple has been charging for its phones that didn't have anything special"
Anyone else’s mute button needs replacement?? Mines wore out!
"no alternatives to real estate, crypto, and stocks. stay long and strong the Apple,MSFT, FB, GOOG, trains."
"Macs and ipads will eventually replace laptops for corporations. Apple continually takes enterprise market share. The M1, security, battery life ease of use, integration with iPhone etc are the reasons companies are moving towards Apple….."
"Someone pinch me, I must be dreaming today. It's like the Apple of old. Can we finally put $150 in the rearview mirror?Can't wait to use my Amex points for my first pair of AirPod Pros."
2022 forward PE of 23 for Apple growing at least 10%(very conservative) per year makes Apple severely undervalued.
"TD101, Richie Rich, Anonymous. WHERE YA’LL AT?"
"Been waiting for apple break out. I knew it was coming always slow to move after it split.Hold,Hold , I own apples for several years."
90% of posts suggestions happen “ eventually”Be patient
"With APPLE, you just close your eyes and HOLD. By the end of the year, you're up 50%"
"Best Buy just reported a stellar quarter. I wonder how much of their revenues were attributed to Apple products!!<...Best Buy's same-store sales rose 19.6% in the second quarter. The largest sales drivers in the period were home theater, appliances, computing, mobile phones and services.The pandemic has led to ""permanent life changes, like hybrid work and streaming entertainment content,"" Barry said. Consumers continue to spend on technology products that ""help them work, learn, entertain, cook and connect at home.""Best Buy Raises Outlook For the current quarter, Best Buy forecast sales of $11.4 billion to $11.6 billion. The midpoint of $11.5 billion topped Wall Street's consensus estimate of $10.47 billion."
"if markets can resists tanking, apple is breaking $150 and going much higher"
Satellite text and calls already exist. It requires a separate device with separate charges (monthly type plan). Much of the world is rural. Definite need for it and to make it affordable and plus then they can track you anywhere on the planet!
"I decided to check Yahoo Finance to see what people are saying about this recent Apple rally. I was hoping to see intelligent, constructive comments. Instead, there are so many posts from short sellers and Apple bashers. It's unfortunate there are so many haters out there. We should be happy this once in a generation stock is doing what it's doing, that is make investors rich."
I love seeing people that are shorting it! Too bad they won't be here for long!
"Before heading to outer space for vacation, it is best to call first. Only iphone can do this..."
"If you want to make some big money look at the energy sector of oil folks. Lots of big deals right now. BTE, OXY to name a few"
"Went to bank borrowed a tonne of cash for next to nothing, bought apple stock. Lovely! They loved the business plan, said thats what they have been doing for years!"
"Tim Cook sold 2.386.440, shares of AAPL on 25 of August @148.58"
Satellite coverage
people who sold apple at $148 this is gold. Wait 5 years and watch it fly way up
"we do remember posting $160 not too long ago.As for yesterday, Algorithim players ?Fuhgedabudit! Some once asked me what that meant? I showed them the Donnie Brasco clip on you tube with FBI Agent answers that question"
Suggest no more intra day trading.Let this play out going into Sep launch
"Guess what ! It's still not too late to get in at $ 153.40, It is heading in to $ 200.00 and beyond , That is about 35 % upside, We will talk about this in 3 years maybe less than that, You just don't play games with APPLE "" the best company in the world"" !!!"
Apple car will be announced So stay strong apple holders
"Once the Apple and Epic lawsuit settles next month, Apple will jump 20% at least. I don't understand why the court would decide what Apple can charge or not for its services. If Epic can not afford it, don't do business with Apple. It is a dog and pony show."
"AAPL reiterated buy with a $180 price target at Evercore ISIEvercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani tells investors in a research note that Apple's advertising business remains an underappreciated lever for upside, providing the company with a unique way to ensure consumer privacy is upheld. The analyst, who maintains an Outperform rating and $180 price target on the shares, forecasts Apple's advertising business to grow to $20B in FY25 from $2B today, accounting for 17% of services revenues and 9% of EPS in FY25."
A new high! Ya Thur! Awesome baby! Arriba! 
flying s
cook sold 5 million shares
"went into an apple store yesterday, it was humming! pickup line was full of people."
"""JPMorgan ups Apple price target, sees 'multiple catalysts' for shares JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee raised the firm's price target on Apple to $180 from $175 and reiterates an Overweight rating on the shares. The analyst continues to see Apple shares set up for ""multiple catalysts"" into the back end of this year, including the upcoming iPhone 13 launch and ""low investor expectations"" for iPhone and total revenue for fiscal 2022, led by concerns relative to cycling past the peak upgrade cycle associated with 5G. Chatterjee increased his 2022 iPhone volume estimates to 246M units and sees ""substantial upside"" relative to consensus expectations. Estimated moderation in the upgrade rate to iPhone 13 relative to iPhone 12 will be offset by the higher volumes for the lower priced phone, as the 5G enabled iPhone SE to be launched in 2022 provides upside ""through the upgrade of a large installed base that is looking for a more affordable 5G device,"" Chatterjee tells investors in a research note."""
It’s AAPL’s nature.It is not uncommon for AAPL to tread water for yes as long as two+ months before moving higher.I did not want to post this week but was reading board and wanted to point out the obvious - the algorithim players!Yesterday they did well as well as Tuesday when AAPL almost hit $151. Then the mini dip to $146+ back to $150 next week.Historical price data supports both comments
"Being the Board Historian I can attest in the past with these “ breakouts”, it is imperative you do not loose this momentum.As some one posted, it is a holiday week. Stocks can go anywhere because of so."
People who are stranded in nowhere land with no cell coverage will now be able to call for help..
"for td101, didn't you realize that apple is up 180 percent for the last 2 years, leading the fangs including Microsoft. that is why you are seeing continuously selling off every day for 10 months. apple already had its biggest gain. that explains it."
Do they really call Dan niles and ron hall analysts? How can cnbc invite them to interviews?I would have fired them long time ago.
"Anyone who would sell this stock better think again. AAPL has averaged a 35.4% yearly return from 1981-2020. The lowest 10 year period was from 1981-1990 when it averaged 20.1% . During 1991-2000 it averaged 22.1%; 2001-2010: 68.1% and from 2011-2020: 31.2%. Further, AAPL is stable producing gains in 8/10 years in each of the last two decades. Use the Rule 72: Imagine your investment doubling in every two years! Finally, every share of AAPL purchased in 1981 has become 224 shares including a 7/1 split in 2014 and a 4/1 split in 2020. Best stock in the market for long term."
Let’s see if Powell moves the needle up??
"Devastating news for Apple  investors ! Tablet sales are forecasted to fall !“Tablet market expected to decline in the coming years”Read it, understand it accept it"
Get ready to fly
Imagine how many people bought the IPhone 12 thinking they will own it for many years before upgrading to a new one.. Many will see great benefits in satellite connectivity and upgrade again to the iPhone 13. Apple will have record IPhone 13 sales numbers...
"AAPL added about $75 billion to its market cap today. 3% of 2.5 Trillion. Hard to comprehend, more than the market cap of most companies. Amazing. As I said, Sept = new iPhone = MORE profits."
THE ONLY STOCK I CAN GO 100% OF PORTFOLIO
Going GREEN!!!!!!!!!
Apple Halted Production As Engineers Struggle With Quality Issues
Look at last few weeks.Thursday’s intra day high has been $1.50 to $4= higher than Wednesday’s intra day high.Sometimes. The action is carried into Friday. But always be nimble if playing the Algorithim
Questions about new satellite feature. Free ? Full service now or maybe latr ? Possible additional Revenue stream or APPL ?
Time for a classic aapl draw back? Like most recently when it refused to break $150? Longs are fine either way in the end.
I bet that John Kelly guy came to the board today talking about his $120 PUTS 
The technical aspects holds the key to understanding the CRYPTO market
I wonder if cnbc will bring on Goldman for a 5th day in a row to knock down Apple?
my gut is saying Apple is going green later today. Anyone agree?
AAPL will generate new revenue streams and reinforce existing ones (next gen iPhones). A money printing machine.
I’m a long aapl here. Come to gsat too. Holding shares there. We are flying up on satellite deal with the iPhone 13.
AAPL next target area is 160's if sustains momentum. Good Luck
So basically everyone hates cell towers(we know that) so satellite transmission will enable cell towers to be removed and of course everyone will need new iPhones……wow!!
My Jan 155 calls looking good - finally …
My brokerage account is Etrade. Any better suggestions?
Developers and Apple agree. This long drawn out uncertainty hanging over the stock is done!
I have been here 13 years. During that time I read “ AAPL is dead money” AAPL was $7+ then split adjusted .I posted maybe ten times a day that with a P|E of 8 to 10 how undervalued it was.What I am saying now is at $150 AAPL is undervalued
Look what happens when there’s word of a satellite chip! What do you think will happen when the car is officially announced?
New longs don’t be fooled by the drop! When the iPhone 13 is announced this will bounce back over $150 and then heading to $170 by the 4th quarter
AMD manufacturing capacity and revenue are both set to increase 60% this quarter. Such a coincidence. Q4 may be better because $AAPL makes the transition from 5nm to 3nm leaving 5nm open for AMD.
This is a classic breakout. $160-165 by Friday. New all time highs add 10-15% quickly.Breakouts have bigger and stronger follow throughs especially during lighter bullish holiday trading weeks.
Last week We “ suggested”no intra day trading into Sep launch.It was a timely post
Let’s come to an understanding today?I suggest no more intra day trading and let this play out
Greatest rally of all time off the 2020 lows. With MMT full steam ahead I expect 6000 sp500 by January and Apple 200.
This IS the APPL we know!!!
I was about to sell my AAPL shares and before I hit sell I woke up all sweaty and nervous.. it was only a nightmare..
It just doesn’t get any better GO APPLE.
Fraudsters want to bring this down but all they can do is wishful thinking. LOL
"May God bless Timothy Cook, who will lead Apple to the promised land while donating much of his bonus stock money to charity."
Looking forward to making satellite calls on my iPhone 13 while driving in my Apple Car while checking my oxygen level on my iWatch while listening on my iPods. How you like dem Apples? Hehe 
"Spanning?I always get lost in my passions.Before yahoo format change I had over 50,000 posts. Yahoo use to number them"
Still holding. Apple is always solid.
I have 4000 shares times 153= over 600k. Jealous?
Why is apple up so much today
Options pressure the stock. Exercised calls are sold. The stock jumps at irregular intervals. If you aren't long and patient you miss the gains. From $5 to $110 was a good investment. From $110 to who knows where will be another good investment. AMD has the chops to take all revenue from $INTC and $NVDA. AMD can put extreme pressure on $AAPL the spy phone company. AMD can become a key supplier to CSCO. AMD is the top super computer Artificial Intelligence company.
New iPhones soon. Can't wait for both new phone and company profits.
"$2.5 Trillon. The next $500 Billion should come fast, then keep rising as J. Powell will never reduce interest rates...To da moon Alice!"
Will be at $170 by end of October. This is gonna move on up now.
Four steps forward one step back ? I'll take it every time!
"Relax people, big ship moves slowly APPLE is moving slowly but it will get there at the end, 180 soon and 200 beyond within a year !! just look at the chart for the past 25 years and you don't second guess ""the best company in the world !! Warren Buffett has invested 48 % with APPLE for his company's entire portfolio !!"
Thumbs up if you think AAPL can still realistically rise another 20% this year.
"I'm up $22,000 today."
"That is what happens when you stay long. Apple is not day trading stock. Buy and hold, always makes money for longs. With satellite capabilities, Apple should charge extra. Excellent feature. $175 very soon."
AAPL coming around along with S&P...keep this price action going. AAPL wants to Breakout. Good Luck.
Phenomenal day for Apple. All time high! Cook = Money. As I so eloquently stated a few weeks ago that Apple will soar as we get closer to the September event of New iPhones and iWatches. Voila! Hehe 
"APPL (holding until we hit a $3 trillion market cap) & ACRX (anybody having surgery, read about ACRX) my top 2 buys. Yahoo Finance PT on ACRX = 600% upside! ACRX 2022 a huge year, read some of the posts out today..."
Yahoo censorship working hard tonight
"This is the run to $162 or so by sometime in September, then we will correct a little before the end of the year run, which will be very healthy!"
Wow just wow…iphone 13 to support satellite communication so no need for cell service to call send texts etc…this would be absolute amazing!!!!!…this according to Kuo..
AAPL forming a nice bottom coming around along with the market. Its trying for the Breakout at these levels. Good Luck
"Samsung Galaxy A21 caught fire an Alaska Airlines forcing evacuation….,why for the love would you just not buy an iPhone? So strange."
Coool! May partner with Globalstar Satellite to offer emergency satellite coverage on its next iphone
cnbc would never do that to msft like they did to apple yesterday. Bring on goldmans saks apple bear who has never been right in 6 years.
Not a bad AAPL day at all considering market and news. AAPL endures. Who sells into panic?
Apple has been the best investment I ever made hands down. I started buying in 2009. I'm just a mechanic/electronic tech not at all rich. But my investment has given me infinite returns. A few years ago I sold enough to put a down payment on a small apartment building and still have more than my original investment. Left growing house money. I wish every investment was this good. I bought Palantir last year that seems promising too
"Imagine having Google pay you $15B just to keep their search engine as the preferred, but not required, feature on your phones. Premarket August 31 and APPL is up again. It might end the day down but you can rest assured that this company always finds ways to make money. That is the main error with every article on why the stock cannot go higher and must fall. The writers have no creative imagination on how to earn money."
"Man, this is another example of patience is good when investing. I’m glad Apple left the $120 price. Now $125 is a real bargain"
AAPL’s nature to trade in trend of three.Last two days it has opened at $149+If not today soon
Trailing PE still under 30…Apple is undervalued
"AAPL, has another double in it.........at least! Been in it since 2013, and yes, I should've bought more, haha"
Apple one of the long term winners to own forever and pass on to your children
Higher highs and higher lows…
i bought on sept 9 2020 at 117.71 cents.not even a year and apples made me happy. 25.89% happy .my best preforming stock.the run up to the sept event will start soon 160 at least.
"AAPL GOING MUCH HIGHER BEFORE EARNINGS IMO.Also, I expect DOCN (Digital Ocean) to see triple digits."
Tim Cook sold 354M $ worth of shares just 5 days ago.. became known todat.so this is going down for the short term...
The Best Company In The World !!
"guys Always remember this ""one thing"" with APPLE , ""Lot to gain & Little to lose"", Yes it would go down sometimes but at the end it would go up and much higher , Do Not Bet Against The Best Company In The World Period !!!"
apple will reach 2.5 trillion dollars in market cap today.
It’s bs that $aapl $tsla $gs conversations are all up to date and $nio conversations are all messed up. Come on yahoo. Why are you discriminating? Oh and $amc is really whack. Got something to share about who gets a clear discussion? Hmmmmm.
"How you like Cook now naysayers! Like I always say about Cook, a fabulous custodian of the company……. And a hombre that made me “mucho” dinero. Hehe "
No selling !!!
literally one of the easiest investments right here... Holding for my fifth year and counting lol.
