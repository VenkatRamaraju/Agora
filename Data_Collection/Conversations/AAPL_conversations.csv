"A team of UBS analysts led by David Vogt said that they see December as a bottom for the company's woes. Their checks indicate Apple's supply chain and COVID headwinds in South East Asia impacted sales by around 5 million units in the quarter, but they see demand as ""likely persistent given backlogs.""The UBS analysts kept their fiscal 2022 unit-sales estimate of 230 million intact despite the supply pressures. ""Moreover, we believe our forecast could prove conservative if the 5 million lost units are captured in FY22,"" said Vogt and the team, who maintained a buy rating and 12-month price target of $175."
"10 Signs of an impending buyout!1. Dead silence from management and IR on all fronts for months.2. Multiple amazing trial data releases in June of 2021.3. Licensing deal and cash from December of 2020 with $200 million 3DMeds deal.4. Market maker's unwillingness to let it move higher even in the face of outweighing inflow.5. Mass manipulation to push the share price down for accumulation prior to the deal being released.6. S3 ATM offering to shift the balance of the negotiations in SLS favor with cash on hand vs bidder.7. Three open positions on the website that still haven't been filled, also another bargaining chip vs the bidder.8. Not a single negative data release yet constant down pressure vs comparable companies.9. Institutions like Vanguard, Blackrock, and Susquehanna are still loaded big given the size of the float.10. Existing relationships and trials with Roche, Merck, Bristol-Myers, and 3DMeds.$XBI $AAPL $AMZNShow Less"
"Yesterday was a complete overreaction. Today Apple has gained back most yesterday's paper losses. Why? Because there is a supply issue, but the demand issue is still sky high! Count the Apple products that you use every day. We have a two person household with (2) iPhone 12's, (1) MacPro. (1) IPAD Pro, (1) AirPod and (1) Apple watch and AppleTV+. That is (7) products in one small household."
Apple had a record quarter and the stock gave back a little AH because of TEMPORARY supply issues. Demand is still very very strong according to Tim and a record holiday quarter is forecast. Stock will be trending higher as supply gets back up which is inevitable
"Apple price target raised to $170 from $165 at Oppenheimer 06:36 AAPL Oppenheimer analyst Martin Yang raised the firm's price target on Apple to $170 from $165 and keeps an Outperform rating on the shares. Apple's Q4 again broke historical records again, with Mac and Services at all-time highs, and other categories reaching a Q4 high despite supply constraints that impacted sales by $6B in the quarter, Yang tells investors in a research note. While supply crunch remains a headwind for the next couple of quarters, Yang expects Apple will accelerate its share gains due to its superior supply chain management and scale advantage."
"How can Apple be considered any less valuable due to supply constraints? Eventually, Apple will reap the same revenues and margins, if not even better as soon as chips become readily available. Remember, the demand is overwhelming for their products and only the best of the best can say that."
"Very solid earnings report given the backdrop of the global chip shortage. Even during times of one of the worst supply shortages, Apple proves to be the world's most profitable company. Next stop: 160."
Why would anyone short the worlds greatest brand and competitive moat with a 22 forward PE and 190b in cash and with their greatest innovative products ever lining up for the next 2-3 years? It boggles the mind
Got some upgrades today. It's a great problem Apple has. Too many customers and not enough supply. It''ll be just fine.
Nice if we end green as it would show investors get it….Apple quarter was awesome and supply stuff will be fixed

"Invest accordingly: Senior leadership and a complaint board delivered the following to investors - Paid out $4,000,000,000 cash to competitor T-Mobile plus some valuable wireless spectrum as a ""break up"" fee when the DOJ forbid their merging. Built out UVERSE with hundreds of millions in capital only to have eschewed pursuit of Direct TV until such time as their share price had risen from the mid-30s to $80+. Then the debt wagon was brutally loaded by purchasing Warner Media for $85,000,000,000 and after only three years is being dismantled. When the announced consolidation with Discovery comes to pass and the sacred dividend is slashed in half without clarity of value inherent to the spin-off, should the investors simply shrug their shoulders as shares continue their ongoing steep decline? ( Reminiscent of GE under Mr. Immelt and team. )"
"As I said early today, I'm watching this thing go GREEN. Still at $149+, but we'll be there."
"Apple comes in $1.5B short on revenue but hits EPS: AH reaction: -4%Amazon comes in $1.5B short on revenue and misses EPS by $1.80: AH reaction 4.5%I know it's an apples to oranges comparison, but I did find it kind of funny. I think Apple will correct upward in the morning. It's not bad of a miss at all"
"So, basically all the doom & gloom from yesterdays comments set AAPL back to it's position from 2 days ago ! Big deal.........."
Honestly I’m huge in Apple. A miss wouldn’t be a big deal for me. Just means my dividends buy back more shares. The only ones who care about these short term moves are TRADERS. Whatever supply chain issues Apple MIGHT have are only TEMPORARY!Enjoy!!!
"Sold all amazon shares, 20 total, & added to apple. Tired of waiting."
"Don't understand why is this overreaction.Apple didn't disapoint per se. They increased their sales and margins y/y, and most importantly, even after the outstanding last quarter. Analysts set an extremely high bar in a time that everyone knows demand is high and supply is problematic.Would you say that Tesla disapointed their sales if I set a 120B sales bar, and they only sold 80B, even though they increased their sales 30%? I think not.Im holding quite a bit in apple, and am not worried at all. Actually, im quite happy with the results considering the times we've been through/are going through.Good luck to all longs ;)"
This looks like initial GOOGLE reaction. Next day it was up 5%. Investors care about the DEC quarter now which Tim says will be solid.This is also not a DEMAND issue so it is temporary SUPPLY issue.
