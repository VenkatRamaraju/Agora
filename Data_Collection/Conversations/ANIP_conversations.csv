Excellent news this morning. FDA accepted ANIP's SNDA for cortrophin gel in a very short 20 days after submission. FDA had 4 months to decide. This drug will change everything for this little company.
apparently Mr Market is telling us that ANIP is going out of business...or at best will not be profitable.
"From the 11/06/18 10Q -Convertible Senior Notes In December 2014, we issued $143.8 million of our Convertible Senior Notes due 2019 (the “Notes”) in a registered public offering. The Notes pay 3.0% interest semi-annually in arrears starting on June 1, 2015 and are due December 1, 2019. The initial conversion price was $69.48 per share. Simultaneous with the issuance of the Notes, we entered into “bond hedge” (or purchased call) and “warrant” (or written call) transactions with an affiliate of one of the offering underwriters in order to synthetically raise the initial conversion price of the Notes to $96.21 per share and reduce the potential common stock dilution that may arise from the conversion of the Notes. The Notes are convertible at the option of the holder under certain circumstances and upon conversion we may elect to settle such conversion in shares of our common stock, cash, or a combination thereof. As a result of our cash conversion option, we separately accounted for the value of the embedded conversion option as a debt discount (with an offset to Additional Paid in Capital (“APIC”)) of $33.6 million. Deferred financing costs are recorded as a reduction of long-term debt in the consolidated balance sheets and are being amortized as additional non-cash interest expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the debt, since this method was not significantly different from the effective interest method.The carrying value of the Notes is as follows as of: (in thousands) September 30,2018 December 31,2017 Principal amount $ 143,750 $ 143,750 Unamortized debt discount (8,643 ) (13,924 )Deferred financing costs (985 ) (1,618 )Net carrying value $ 134,122 $ 128,208 We had accrued interest of $1.4 million and $0.4 million related to the Notes recorded in accrued expenses, other in our consolidated balance sheets at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively."

"ATRS already had secured a patent for method of use to treat HSDD by administering testosterone. This was publicly announced November 29, 2011 by both BPAX and ATRS. I find it very interesting that ATRS received Notice of Allowance July 26, 2012 on a follow up patent for general testosterone replacement therapy, this patent was issued December 25, 2012. This information was never disclosed by either BPAX, ANIP or ATRS. Ironically, according to the SEC filings one week before the Notice of Allowance was issued “On July 19, 2012, BioSante and ANI entered into a mutual confidentiality agreement in order to allow the parties to explore and evaluate a possible transaction and conduct initial due diligence. “ ANIP just happened to manufacture hormones and had large unused capacity. The former Solvay Pharmaceutical manufacturing plants. Both patents expire December 29, 2028, but may be extended by applying for an FDA Patent Term Restoration. This will give them up to 14 years of protection."

"ANI Pharmaceuticals Inc. The healthcare sector provides a veritable smorgasbord of micro-cap and small-cap investing opportunities; unfortunately, most are downright dangerous and unprofitable. That's not the case with drug developer ANI Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:ANIP), which has a market cap of less than $680 million and is healthfully profitable.What makes ANI Pharmaceuticals such an attractive company is the fact that it attacks both sides of the aisle in the drug development process. It develops brand-name therapies that command high margins, and it also relies on generic-drug development. Generic drugs typically have lower margins than branded therapies, but there's a seemingly endless supply of generic drug opportunities. Furthermore, the rising cost of brand-name drugs is pushing physicians and consumers toward more generic drug use. Covering both aspects of drug development gives ANI Pharmaceuticals a nice balance of high growth (branded therapies) and slower but steadier growth (generics). Through the first nine months of 2016, generic drug revenue made up $65.9 million of its $90.4 million in sales.Drug Capsules Over Money Cash Hundreds GettyImage source: Getty Images. ANI Pharmaceuticals also has an impressive generic drug pipeline. As of the end of the third quarter, ANI had 78 products in development with a total annual market size of $3.7 billion based on data from IMS Health.It's worth noting that ANI is also an active acquirer. Its Q3 report listed 53 of its 78 products in development as having been acquired. ANI believes 46 of these 53 acquired products can be commercialized with ease based on prior approval supplements or via CBE-30s, which are moderate changes made to a drug filed with the Food and Drug Administration. After generating $2.72 in full-year EPS in 2015, Wall Street has eyes on ANI Pharmaceuticals hitting $7.61 in full-year EPS by 2019. It's an under-the-radar small-cap stock you should certainly know about."
"ugly report, ugly share price. kinda goes hand-in-hand"
"Early in September Mizuohi down graded Mallinkrodt, because they felt any progress on corticotropin would hurt Mallinkrodts Acthar gel. With that in mind it is believed that Libigel and the other indications can do up to $16 billion eventually. I hope management is weighing this since Cannacord thinks a buyout could fetch $70 dollars per share which would be about $800 million in a buyout. This would be an embarrassment to the CEO to sell out the company at this price. Look what Gilead paid for Kite and it will take years for them to get that money back ( 5 years tops). The Acthar market is worth $1-2 billion dollars, where anip can get that over night based pricing and marketing. Arthur do not sell out the company unless we are looking ar $3 billion+ a CVR on corticotropin and Libigel."

"From Seeking Alpha -'Why Investors Have Severely Underestimated ANI Pharmaceuticals' And Its Cortrophin SNDA'https://seekingalpha.com/article/4277448-investors-severely-underestimated-ani-pharmaceuticals-cortrophin-sndaSummaryBased on implied peak sales of $50 million to $200 million for 5 of its recent launches; generic price erosion offsetting organic revenue growth, and peak annual revenues of $330 to $500 million for cortrophin, the author estimates peak forward sales of $380 million to $700 million added on top of its run rate of $211 million in revenues for FY2019. Using an industry average EBITDA margin of 30%, this results in $114 to $210 million in new EBITDA. In all, for a company with an enterprise value of $1 billion, these numbers imply the stock is trading at forward EV/Sales of just 1.1x to 1.7x and EV/EBITDA of 3.4x to 5x. Considering the sector is in steep decline due to various price fixing lawsuits and drug price erosion, ANI stands out as a spectacular gem buried beneath the rubble with an enticing risk-reward profile designed to enrich long term shareholders."

Long time holder of 5 shares: For years it swings between between 40 and 70 as influenced by a rating service. When they say buy get ready to sell and when the say sell get ready to buy. Enjoy the 30 point swing. For me I am going to carry these 5 shares to the grave in case they ever do take off. The other thing I will take is a bottle of scotch. They say it will last forever and you will never have to buy any more.

"When BPAX then ANIP were allegedly seeking a partner for Libigel this is how they marketed it .Is ANIP bound by a non-disclosure agreement regarding Libigel? If so it is most likely with Abbott/AbbVie or Solvay (Abbvie's subsidiary). The Phase Three Safety Study makes no mention of the 70% reduction in cardiovascular events which according to patent applications was observed after 4,000 patient years of data had been accumulated. The Phase Three Safety Study was also an efficacy study. The marketing information cites 5,100 years of data being collected but fails to mention its greatest feature the reduction of cardiovascular events by at least 70% (observed at 4,000 patient years of data). Nor does it include the discovery that it reduced breast cancer events (a December 2015 discovery) as articulated in the patent application and subsequent prosecution and fails to mention they were collecting efficacy data. The following is from the Deal.bio website - taken down around the fall of 2016.""Last Updated On Feb 22, 2016DescriptionLibiGel (testosterone gel) for female sexual dysfunction is in Phase III, and is designed to be quickly absorbed through the skin after a once-daily application. ANI acquired this asset through a merger with BioSante and is open to divesting LibiGel. Phase III Safety Study: BioSante continues to conduct the Phase III LibiGel safety study, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center, cardiovascular (CV) events and breast cancer study that has completed enrollment of 3,656 women and has accrued over 5,100 women-years of exposure, to date. The study is designed for a total of five years; however, BioSante could use the safety study data as part of a NDA submission after the last subject enrolled has completed 12 months of exposure to LibiGel or placebo. The LibiGel safety study is tracking a predefined list of CV events, in agreement with the FDA, including CV death, myocardial infarction and stroke in women 50 years of age or older and suffering from at least two CV risk factors including hypertension and diabetes. The objective of the safety study is to demonstrate the relative safety of testosterone compared to placebo in the number of CV events. The incidence of breast cancer also is being tracked over the course of the study. The study represents the largest data base of the safety of testosterone in women.

"It has been difficult holding ANIP for the past couple years. The stock price has ranged from $29 to $72 and it's not uncommon for the price to drop $8 in one day. This small company is under the radar so it's impossible to obtain an in-depth analysis. I've listened to all the quarterly conference calls and read the 10Q from cover to cover. Here's my take.ANIP has two drugs that are unapproved by the FDA and could be halted at any time; opium tincture and EEMT. About two years ago these two drugs accounted for over 50 percent of ANIP's sales and EBITDA. Also through in the fact that EEMT has been linked to increased risk of breast cancer with declining scripts. Management has been lessening the company's reliance on these two drugs and currently they now comprise about 30 percent. There was little competition so these were very profitable drugs for the company. The fact that sales and EBITDA have continued to increase in spite of the decline is commendable. ANIP now has 5 drugs that showing significant growth and percentage of sales/EBITDA. Some of these drugs have profit sharing agreements; therefore, gross margins have decline. In order to support this significant growth the company hired 45 full time employees. Considering this is a 32 percent increase in the workforce it's my opinion the sales per employee has not caught up at this time; however, I expect in 2017 the new workforce will be integrated and rationalized. ANIP has acquired corticotropin which if approved would be the sole competitor to the HP Acthar monopoly. This is a risky proposition considering HP Acthar has garnered significant attention lately as the highest priced drug per Medicare patient. It's priced around $40k per vial. ANIP management has been wise to keep a low profile on this drug in order to stay off Andrew Left's radar or other short seller. The next question is what will the FDA require to approve this drug? I must admit that ANIP has formed an impressive team to obtain FDA approval headed up by Dr. Karen Quinn.Although this is a risky proposition it has a big payoff if successful considering HP Acthar has over $1B in sales with no competition. Another positive is Mallinckrodt paid $5.8 billion for this drug whereas ANIP paid $75 million plus undisclosed royalties to Merck; therefore, ANIP has significant leeway in pricing the drug. Management has estimate the corticotropin drug could contribute upwards of $200M in cash flow which is about 5-6 times current cash flow.In summary, ANIP requires nerves of steel to own; however, they have a very impressive and experienced management team that may be able to pull this off making it a multi bagger."

"Evidence strongly supports the takeover is Libigel related and that Roth Capital is most likely the financial adviser they have been working with. It most likely started at the time of the meetings with Roth Capital Management in September, 2016. By the time of the meeting: -The first of three new Libigel related patent applications had been filed -The Libigel trademark had been allowed to expire without a replacement name being applied for. - The following month the other two Libigel related patent applications were filed. (All replacing the existing three patent applications) - I don't know the exact time they removed Libigel as a Licensing opportunity from the Deals.bio website, but I am willing to bet it was around September 2016.
