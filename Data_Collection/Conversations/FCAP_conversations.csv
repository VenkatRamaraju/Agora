Share prices going up nicely.
"Beware, this will return to $40 where it should be. A PE ratio of 19 is not the industry standard. Plus, almost 2x book value is not the industry standard. 1.1 -1.3x book is about right, an PE ratio of around 13-14 is about right..,..so it's a $40 stock."
"How many winners did you have this week? Want to add ten more to that number? Then google ,STOCKTRADEVIDEO they are alerting huge breakouts you have been only dreaming about"

"You could purchase almost 2x as many shares of German American, a local big boy,, plus 2.25% dividend for one share of FCAP at this time."
