investment in a bank with under 2% dividend is not wise at this time....check around
"Like I said before, a $40 stock. This is a decent purchase now, dividend is still a bit low for the banking sector."
"You could purchase almost 2x as many shares of German American, a local big boy,, plus 2.25% dividend for one share of FCAP at this time."
love the service by First Harrison Bank Edwardsville..good dividend. stock and broker service excellent
"Dividend needs to be increased. The dividend around $.40 per quarter. That would increase the dividend return to approx 4%, more inline with the banking sector, which would invite long term investors and increase the share price."
"How many winners did you have this week? Want to add ten more to that number? Then google ,STOCKTRADEVIDEO they are alerting huge breakouts you have been only dreaming about"
"Extremely high volume at extremely high share price, someone is betting on a merger."
"Beware, this will return to $40 where it should be. A PE ratio of 19 is not the industry standard. Plus, almost 2x book value is not the industry standard. 1.1 -1.3x book is about right, an PE ratio of around 13-14 is about right..,..so it's a $40 stock."
Share prices going up nicely.
