We are seeing a nice pop on this stock over the past 2 weeks! Let’s see this momentum continue. It’s a great bank with lots of unexplored potential. Once Corona is more under control we will really start to see this bounce

"Investors should focus on gains in book value, earnings and intrinsic value and make sure they are growing by 10% or more, a year.It would be a mistake not to have 40%-50% of your net worth in just one really good situation.Keep allocating capital as rationally as you can and go at it each day.Learn each day.Time and discipline are very important to long term wealth building.Value investors get rich, over time!Stay in your circle of competence always!You only need to own 2 to 6 issues to get rich.Huge insider ownership is a must.Diversification makes no sense, for someone who knows, what there are doing."

What is the realistic stock price to be in 3 years and why? Anyone have a thought.
"Columbia is wasting it’s money from the offering on boring new commercials. Brick and mortar banking is dead. No one going to branches to do banking anymore. Only people at branch are a few sleepy, rude poorly dressed employees. I don’t understand how a Company with $10 million in quarterly profit could have a market cap of over $1 Billion. I’m running for the hills!"

When can we expect CLBK to start paying a dividend? Thanks.
1 year anniversary passed for IPO of stock and there was not a mass sell off. Stock price held. Past quarter CLBK beat the street estimate in profits. Wait till they get added to the Russell 2000 quarter. This stock will only go up from here.

The company said they would grow the business either through aquisitions or organic growth. Well lets see what you got. Time to put our money to work. Gotta give them a couple years at least.
Does Columbia have to wait a certain amount of time since going public to buy another bank or be bought out by another bank?
Why doesn’t Columbia Financial pay a dividend? When all the other regional banks do pay a dividend.
