"Investors should focus on gains in book value, earnings and intrinsic value and make sure they are growing by 10% or more, a year.It would be a mistake not to have 40%-50% of your net worth in just one really good situation.Keep allocating capital as rationally as you can and go at it each day.Learn each day.Time and discipline are very important to long term wealth building.Value investors get rich, over time!Stay in your circle of competence always!You only need to own 2 to 6 issues to get rich.Huge insider ownership is a must.Diversification makes no sense, for someone who knows, what there are doing."

"Columbia is wasting it’s money from the offering on boring new commercials. Brick and mortar banking is dead. No one going to branches to do banking anymore. Only people at branch are a few sleepy, rude poorly dressed employees. I don’t understand how a Company with $10 million in quarterly profit could have a market cap of over $1 Billion. I’m running for the hills!"
