$18.50 buy-out offer on the table for RDI.
RDI reports they are reviewing the $17.22 offer...Others bidders may top it
took a position today. opening CA location this Friday. pent up demand.
Why not buy your stock back if worth north of $12 and selling for $6 how better to deploy stock.
"Why don't they just sell the company might be one of the worst run companies I have ever invested, glad to see that the INSIDERS are losing money and lots of it just like me."
"I have been watching this company for the last couple months and started a small position over the past few weeks. I like this company's chances of surviving next year as the vaccines rollout in Q2 or Q3. RDI has an interesting business mix and a healthy amount of theaters in New Zealand and Austrialia, which will not be affected by WB's recent decision to remove the theaters' exclusivity with all of their movie launches in 2021. They have a solid real estate asset base that they can use to add liquidity without diluting the shareholders."
Sure has been a long time since there was any good news coming from RDI!!
Will anyone say who the buyout offer revealed today was from?
unsure if billionaire Mark Cuban still owns 12% of company
TPG and Madison Dearborn are other interested bidders
Going to 20
Why not sell the company! Maybe Mark Cuban would like it for .30 cents on the dollar.
Do you know who the three bidders are and how much for?
Who are the big sellers down here lately?
"Patton Vision is 1 of the bidders,and had offered $18.50 back in 2016"
How is it that RDI announces earnings but they are not visible? Does anyone know what the earnings were?
"Why not buy your stock back if worth north of $12 and selling for less than $4; how better to deploy stock, surprised nobody wants this company at any price."
Bloomberg reports 3 different bidders for company
"Nice run on the share price, i wish i knew about this stock....also check out EYEG, made a nice run to start the morning and not over. This stock has a target of $16 a share and controlled by the insiders...keep this one on your radar."
