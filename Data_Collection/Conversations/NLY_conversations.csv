Not sure I am comfortable with the answer to the first question of the conf call. Fink said he was comfortable with 10% dividend (at an 8 something stock price). If they raise div then the stock price would rise and I would be much more comfortable with a 10% div at an 10 or 12 $ stock price. This is a chicken or egg issue and I think we need to tell Fink it starts with div.
"Price goes up, price goes down, but I'm earning almost 10% return based on my cost basis of $9.11. I'm not expecting the dividend to be raised but I can live with the current amount for the next decade....no problem."
.28 EPSBV +2 cents @$8.39time to hibernate til mid December
They did not make the whisper. My prior prognostic was right but a bit shy on the downslide. I thought we would hold 8.60I got stopped this AM. Glad I protected my capital. made a whopping 2c.. :( this is gonna be dead money for a while. Congrat to the $9 call sellers.This is not due to another company downgrade. This is squarely an earning results. Investors were positioned to expect better. I think we will hover near 8.50 but very well could dip to the 8.30. I have also a support at 8.40 but we have broken once again the August uptrend channel. Not good. Will seek re-entry when things settle. This stock does not seem to position itself for raising rates.The good news is we may end up sideway for a while and that would be a good trading range. Could be 8.35 to 8.65. Let see what develop
great buying opportunity hedge funds are adding to their portfolio I picked up some more myself
What's up with NLY? It's a great stock with outstanding dividends.Must be the nickel and dime traders.
With TDAmerica and had my divy when i signed on this morning. The correct amount of 22 cents per share that i own
Have not rec’d my divy either….
"Have owned shares since July and had them before , on and after Ex-div date. Thought my divy would have been deposited in my account right after midnight last night. This is my first divy with NLY, anybody not receiving their divy yet? Do they payout throughout the day, or later today. Thanks"
I think Q4 dividend will be announced as $0.22. Q1 2022 dividend will be announced as $0.25 if the Fed has commenced tapering by 1/1/2021 and the consensus of institutional bond investors is that the Fed will commence interest rate increases by mid Summer 2022.
Think market was disappointed by lack of dividend increase and falling revenues. I sold off my position prior to earnings happily. Thinking about getting back in. Want to hear management's explanation for the decline in revenues.
"With rates rising, Fed tapering by 2022, and inflation spiking as we speak, I dont know if REITs are the best place forward looking. arguably, it was better to invest into Bitcoin since 2020 the way it looks. But I think interest rates will not accelerate to astronomical levels yet..so there might be some opportunities for gains among REITs. Would anyone recommend a solid Dividend paying stock that's not named $NLY ?"
"Great earning call and great team. It’s good to know if you’re a long term investor and trust the team running this company. If you haven’t read the earning call yet you should. Copied and pasted a portion regarding dividend increase, just in case you don’t have time to read it. QA with CEO responding. Don’t expect any dividend increase until 3 or 4 th quarter “ In terms of what we want to look for to increase the yield, or increase the dividend, we would need to see obviously, wider asset spreads, better investment opportunity, more durable earnings. We feel good about where earnings are this quarter and we feel good about covering the dividend into 2022, certainly. But we do recognize that we have outearned the dividend consistently since the second quarter of 2021. And we're comfortable with that and we're very comfortable where the dividend yield is today.”"
"(NLY) reported third-quarter earnings of $519.2 million.On a per-share basis, the New York-based company said it had net income of 34 cents. Earnings, adjusted for non-recurring gains, came to 28 cents per share.The results exceeded Wall Street expectations. The average estimate of four analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was for earnings of 26 cents per share.The real estate investment trust posted revenue of $413 million in the period. Its adjusted revenue was $362.5 million."
"Read Q & A section of Q3 Financial presentation. Per Mr. Finkelstein (summarization), expectation is 22 cents dividend per Q for 2022. 2022 EAD to continue to exceed/meet 22 cents per Q dividend payout. 2023 likely dividend increase. Caveat, no significant event(s) to alert NLY management plan. I'm satisfied."
NLY beats earning estimates then drops 1.30 % ???
What share price was your DRIP?
"Had NLY for years, only thing they keep on dropping the div."
After the market closes today NLY will issue its 3rd Qtr earnings which should be another street surprise (fourth in a row) and a re-affirmation of the companies increasing revenue and continued profitability. Current recommendations show analysts confidence evidence by (4) Buy...(5) outperform and (4) hold and no reduce or sell recommendations
