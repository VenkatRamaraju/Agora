"Seasonality suggests upward bias for NLY, as Nov and Dec have been up months 90% of the time the last five years. Past performance is no guarantee of future success."
"Added more shares today, lets hold for at least 5 years."
"Does anyone know where to go to get accurate BV info on NLY? Search the internet, and you find wildly differing numbers. Thanks!"
Been on vacation for a while. Keeping a distant eye on the market. Got AMZN lately. paying off today. Also been in COIN and AAPL (not so hot)Got an alert as NLY is closing at a critical level $8.70. This stock has given a nasty false reversal around mid-april. I am sure many got caught in it. Been out of it for a while but tomorrow will be critical in a new uptrend if it closes above 8.70. That level called a selloff each time since 7/14.
Not looking good. Today it looks like the 50 Day MA will cross (Death Cross) the 200 Day MA.
I love low risk 10%+ yields!
One step forward two steps back.
Did NLY announce the div yet?
"This is a great stock at this price !This is a slow growth stock that most investors buy for the dividend ,If your looking for something that will shoot to the moon and rollercoaster back to earth the same day then crypto is more your speed ! If your looking for a steady dividend then this one is for you !The price of the stock has it,s moments and we all know the valuation of this stock is more on the $9-$10 range at it,s current trajectory but with all the bad decision making going on in the White House the markets are a Hodge podge of what's affected ! 3 trillion infrastructure /High inflation /new covid variant concerns /possibly over 15,000 Americans being left behind to fend for themselves against the Taliban ...(shameful), and the Borders left wide open along Texas/New mexico/Arizona/and California borders bringing in tens of thousands of criminals and people infected by covid and God knows how many Terrorists will slip in planning the next 9/11....All these bad decisions and more too numerous too list here are all playing into our very unstable stock market , oh yeah and i forgot to mention the the halting of the Keystone pipeline which affects our oil commodities and stocks! Please people if you voted Democrat don't make the same Stupid mistake twice, We all don't want to retire Bankrupt!"
This is a sell
It has been a good run for a while! Thank you longs!
$9.50/share early next year. Dividend increased to 25 cents/Qtr.
"These reits are just another scam from Wall Street, they pay better dividends than the bank but the price keeps on falling year after year that means people actually didn't make any money"
"Question regarding tax information. Do REITs report income for tax filing at the same time as stocks paying ordinary dividends? I owned REITs in the past and have a memory of them being a headache for the tax preparer, because the information came in so late an amended return had to be filed. But I am getting old, and memory is not as it used to be. Am I confusing REITs with LPs in this regard? And yes, I do remember that REIT dividends taxed as ordinary income, not as qualified dividends. TIA"
Accumulating shares. 1% less than ex-dividend $8.59.
What’s up with NYY today
10 yr heading higher again. 1.50this helps NLY book value.
"This is highly dependent on some sort bond market stability, which has absolutely went haywire in the last 4 months. And the message from the Federal Reserve doesn't help."
October is usually a bad month for stocks. Good month to buy.
When do I have to buy this stock to get the next dividend and then how long do I need to hold it before I can sell my shares
The current administration will not be good for our economy.
"with a widening spread and a rising 10yr, NLY should be heading north just like it was when the 10yr was at 1.70 earlier in the yr."
"Excerpt:During the second quarter, Annaly navigated a more challenging market backdrop marked by heightened rate and spread volatility, an elevated prepay environment and increased discussion of an eventual Fed Taper,"" remarked David Finkelstein, Annaly's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer. ""We proactively reduced leverage and the size of our portfolio while increasing liquidity to preserve capital for more attractive investment opportunities throughout the balance of the year. Despite the more conservative posturing, we generated robust earnings for the quarter well in excess of our dividend."""
"I don’t expect any quick, dramatic changes to interest rates or FED policy. The slow changes should enhance the environment for NLY over a longer time period."
The only reason this went from $9.60 to $8.30 was Fed noise. It should be trading at a 20% premium to BV..
I had to recently payoff a business loan that had a balloon and bank did not want to refi. So transferred 401k to an IRA…with intention of putting right back in within 60 days so do not have to take as income. So where to put money going back in? Had most in S&P index fund but think I will put it back in gold fund….with hedge against inflation. Just thinking out loud. Any thoughts along these lines?
Great time to add for short term gain. 
"Since 2012 annaly's dividend has been steadily declining, (.68 to .22) Does anyone know of why this is? Is this a sign that the company is losing profitability or a sign that the company is reinvesting in itself? Any ideas or facts/analysis appreciated"
"hope this will be a good ride, got in at 8.36 yesterday"
"I want to stress that this explanation of the Blockchain is just a high-level overview. There are many moving parts in this process. If anyone can add to it or provide corrections, please do so.Blockchain is a database, just like any other database, Oracle, SQL Server, Teradata. But it is structured differently. You can only add records to it. You can't make changes to existing records. So, if you have a transaction that says: 5 bitcoins are moved from Person A to person B, that record will remain in the database forever. And if it was supposed to be 4 coins and not 5, a new record will be created that will say, 1 bitcoin moved from Person B to Person A.Each record gets assigned an encrypted value called ""hash"".When Record 1 is created with its own hash. When Record 2 is created it also has its own hash generated, but also the hash of Record on is stored in that record. Likewise, Record 3 has its own hash and the hash of Record 2. Record 4 has its own hash and the hash of Record 3. And so on. Notice that each record has connectivity to the previous record, not to the next one. These hashes are generated automatically, so, if someone hacks the database and changes Record 1 to say: 100,000 bitcoin was moved from Person A to Person B, a different hash will be created for Record 1 and the old hash stored in Record 2 will not match it. The chain gets broken. Record 1 has a bad link.The copy of the blockchain database (they call a ledger) is sent to many nodes to have it validated. That's why they call it distributed database. It is distributed to nodes. Nodes check all the linkages between records. They look at every hash and compare them. If someone hacked the ledger the nodes will see the broken link and they will reject the record.Who are the nodes? It's either people who mine cryptocurrency or just regular people with powerful computers who do these validations for free. There are approximately 10,000 nodes that validate Bitcoin and they are located all over the world.To become a node, people sign up and get connected to the network that sends them copies of the ledger. Some of these people validate the entire blockchain and some only parts of it. If a new transaction is confirmed as good, it is added to the database and a good copy of the ledger is sent to all the nodes.Although it looks like it's impossible to hack the ledger, a hacker with a powerful computer can simply re-write every record, generate new hashes, and connect records to one another in perfect order. But, that only changes one ledger. The copy of it will go out to other 10,000 nodes and they will see not just one break in the chain but a whole ledger completely corrupted. They will reject every record and the ledger will be rewritten from a previous copy.So the next step in hacking would be to re-write ALL ledgers. It's not impossible. Just extremely time-consuming. It could take 10,000 years to re-write them all. But if you are a foreign government with a warehouse full of supercomputers you can do it in just a few days.To avoid having a Blockchain network hacked by foreign governments, they put a small delay on the processing of blocks. Now, even if you have a city-size warehouse filled with supercomputers it will take you a million years to re-write all the ledgers. This delay is the reason why it takes such a long time to settle your bitcoin transactions. You can buy a stock and it will take seconds to go through. Not so for crypto."
"$8.25 is a major support level. I really thought NLY would move up again towards $9.00, ! C’mon NLY!!"
Let’s get back to $8.70 today
Where is this share price heading between now and the exdividend date Amy thoughts
Just think if you took cash from last month dividend and then purchased shares at sell off prices since then. This approach has been working well for me.
This stock just keeps going lower
"Might have to buy some more down here, anything under $8.50 is a bargain!"
"Usually do not like to see posters bringing up others stocks…..so let me do just that. I know zip about this company. Just want to know what a few of you guys think about it’s numbers. Looks very strong on the surface, just want a second opinion. Anyway, it’s Big Five Sports, BGFV."
Buying in July and paying over $9 was certainly a mistake in the short run for me. At the current rate of performance I'll just about break even in one more quarter unless it goes even lower. Hopefully the dividend won't be cut again any time soon in which case this will turn out to be a good long term investment. Win some and lose some.
The last 2 Drips were Ii the $8.30 $8.40 range. This adds shares that compound at a 10% return. Perfect for a Roth. .The current management is very conservative on using leverage. .I expect the share price to trade at a 20% premium to BV at some point.
"If you have 9 months and longer long position time frame, I suggest that you view a 1, 2 and 5 year share price chart. Notice the share price support level."
"Sorry to say, but this stock is for people who are poor in math and don’t understand ROI. If you held this stock for about 20 years, you would have lost 3-4 % average per year. With say 10% dividend, your annual net gain has been about 6.5% per year. There are thousands of stocks that have beaten average 6.5% annual return. Don’t waste your time with this."
"If you guys want to know what is at stake today it is $8.52-54. Watch my chart here from 5 days ago. Volume is already intense. if the stock rebound from this, we will continue trening up."
"Oh, here we go. I was considering selling all my shares before the ex-dividend date, but then I decided to play a different game.I just sold $9 covered calls on all my shares for November 5th expiration (a week after earnings release) and I collected 12 cents premium. We have today and tomorrow left before the price adjusts. Although I don't expect it to happen, the stock could break through $9.If it breaks through I may lose my shares, but at least I will collect 12 cents premium, and then maybe I will buy my shares back on Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday.If it doesn't break through I will become eligible for 22 cents dividend plus 12 cents premium. If the price adjusts hard and goes to the low $8s, I will buy my call option back for 2-3 cents. If it stays in the mid or high $8s I will just ride that option with my cost basis reduced by 12 cents."
The stock price goes down the same amount you earn in dividends.
Does buying this stock on the ex dividend date and then sell a day later for the div make any sense? Has anyone ever tried this let me know.
"A 10% dividend is tough to pass up for a lot of people. Dividend investors usually are not traders so as long as they keep it consistent, they'll be fine."
"I think we easily bust thru the 9 resistance,soon. Earnings, divident, earnings, divident, earnings, divident. PE PE PE. Good luck to all."
"I firmly believe the dividend is sustainable or even could be increased sometime soon. While it’s frustrating this thing remains undervalued, it’s also nice we can keep locking in 10%+ yield in an era of historically low interest rates."
"I have owned NLY for about 14 years and have reinvested the dividends , It’s been terrific ., it’s yields are excellent I started with 3000 shares and bought about 3000 more in the open market, now I have over 17400 shares . I would highly recommend it , I have represented many athletes and wouldn’t hesitate to have them accumulate shares, objective isn’t appreciation of share price but rather yield and accumulating more shares by reinvesting its dividends"
"Everybody wants the div.,"
"Question from someone new - - The Preferred Stocks (F, G, and I) are paying dividends. When do we find out about the rest of us?"
The $8.50s calls for this Friday are already up 50% this morning. Waited a little too long. It’s been a good weekly trade. But just watching this week.
Is this a gift?
XD is the 29th. The stock price will drop $22 cents automatically at open to cover the dividend. Whatever happens after is determined by the market. I only care about the Drip price when the dividend is payed.
A lot of open 8.50 put options expiring today (almost 7000 open contracts). Maybe we'll see a battle end-of-day to get those in-the-money?
"For those who don’t follow options, the $8.50s expiring today are 20 cents per share. On Monday, they were a penny. They are up over 80% just today. 20-fold for the week. If you could have held them…..which I could not. Bah,bah, bah. That is my best chicken impression."
"J.O., no one is cheerleading here, you may not know their business. Yuu could spin it anyway you like , may be a trader. Some of the comments are for people benefitting from their dividend. Btw you could sit down go over their detailed financial on their website. Yes Their interest income was a lot lower from last quarter but it could be the worst for the rest of the year. Secondly they have paid a lot of the debt. The paid the preferred off in the sum so where around $400 million. They cut their interest expense was cut by half. That’s how management managed the turbulent times, still they ended with high interest income."
"Hello. I'm new and don't usually do this sort of thing. I've inherited my holdings and now need to deal with the business end of things. I guess we have been an owner for quite awhile. Roth, and 401K, and the folio from my family, I have some learning curve to cater to. Be back soon. GLTA Rickie"
"Bought yrs ago and reinvesting dividends ,almost 4K shares now"
Pretty significant move this morning.
just purchased 14500 shares. let's hope it works out
A FANTASTIC DVIDEND STOCK!!!PAYS 20 YEARS ABOUT 10% DIVIDEND AND THE SHARE PRICE FORECAST 9.3-10 FOR 2022
"NLY is a good RIET This critical race theory teaches people to be racist, and this infrastructure bill is not for infrastructure ,but mostly an increase in welfare, and new taxes which the working middle class will end up paying for. Not the rich. We did not give the democrats a mandate for socialism, we did not vote for open borders, we did not vote to defund the police, we did not vote for critical race theory to be taught in our schools. It seems like the democrats are over reaching their authority. And now the democrats want to increase their budget another 3.5 trillion dollars? That's insane the rich or anyone else are not going to end up paying for this insanity, but they will try on putting it on the lowly working tax payer. Vote these liberal freeloaders out in 2022. All RIETs will get hurt if this bill passes."
For the last 5 quarters NLY has made nearly 30 cps (core earningsJ). When will they raise the dividend? What about the 90% reit test?
Divvy Boost coming !
Piper Sandler analyst Kevin Barker downgrades Annaly Capital Management (NYSE:NLY) from Overweight to Neutral and lowers the price target from $9 to $8.5.
This stock can get out of its own way.
Nice to see it close at the highest share price of the day.
NLY or AGNC better?
"Unfortunately dividends are not going anywhere soon but eventually higher. The problem is they have diluted the shares anytime their bets don’t work. But they gave reduced it by 40 mil shares. In 2017 company had 1 billion shares and now 1.4 billion. Until they seriously target that in reducing the number, their dividend will stay where they are. Unless their income goes 30-40% higher then May be we go back to .30 dividend."
"Massive call volume happening in NLY today. Been following NLY for a long time, never seen anything like this. CNBC even mentioned it on the halftime report"
can anyone explain why this stock was at 12 PPS in 2017 but now in the mid 8's now? despite the market being higher now and mortgage sales are I'm assuming higher now than in 2017.
"Performance is stated in ROI that is best communicated by % gain or loss, not words. It's been said ""that one persons trash is another persons treasure"". Therefore, describing an investment as excellent is nebulous."
RSI: 36 bought 5000 more at $8.40
I’m going to make a bold call just for number6. NLY will break higher pass the $9 mark to 9.10. Let’s see how many people will attack me on this. 
"I bought this for the dividend in June at an average price of $9.10 so clearly it was not a good short term investment. However I do believe, based on several analyst's comments that the dividend is not in danger of immediate cut. ( gosh have I been burned on that thought previously). I don't expect much in the way of cap gain nor an increase in the dividend in the near term. OTOH if the dividend isn't cut for a while I think I'll end up happy in the long run. With inflation my 2% bond fund was just not cutting it for me."
"I have NLY shares in my IRA account so I am wondering if it would make sense to sell everything a day or two before the ex-dividend date and buy it all back a few days later. In the past few quarters, NLY consistently dropped more than 22 cents after the ex-div date. This could be a nice way to pick a few extra pennies. We are not yet at the point where there is a mad dash to buy shares to become eligible for the dividend, but if in the next two weeks the price moves above 8.80 I might do it.Any thoughts on 8.80?"
"EPS of 2.30 and a divie of .88 seems reasonable to me, divie should be safe"
NLY has been mostly $8.50 all year long. Will it ever rebound to pre-pandemic levels? I’m thinking once the FED raises the rates to 2%+ like they was before that may do it. Hopefully before 2025
Book value is $8.36 where do y’all think you’re going?
"Earning call. Love these guys. Great management. And regarding dividend, for those that are worries Finkelstein : “I would say that we certainly expect to out-earn the dividend in Q3.”"
"A ten dollar stock trading far below its value. A true bargain basement price. Naysayers are not correct, HEAH. Good luck to all."
"People are losing money to hold these reits, they keep on falling year after year, another Wall Street scam"
"Poster ""Jim"" said 3 days ago ""Is that why there was a HUGE block sell today? I just got out on the pop"". Haha, I've been watching him and the stock price, and he may have saved himself 1/2 a cent, hahahahaha."
"Greg without getting into a detailed financial analysis let’s look at simple basics my dollar investment as compared to the dollars times the number of shares I own equate to a significant gainThis is the first time I have ever posted anything on this site , however I must admit I occasionally read some of the comments. I find many are manipulative, some are transparently self serving, some are aggressively ignorant and some are sophisticated and intelligent As an investor I measure risk vs reward,it’s been my experience the ratio over time has been excellent"
could go to $8.95 by ex-dividend date but then back down the big question how far back down
Very nice trading at close.
Powell appointment will not be renewed as Fed chairman. his moves to lower rates was political.
I like the NLY dividend but Motley Fool is pushing it so I'm very hesitant to invest more into this security.
"Thanking the Piper analyst who downgraded NLY and AGNC, allowing me to buy more at a lower price, at a higher yield. Now waiting for the day when the same analyst upgrades them (which will be my sell signal). Wall Street analysts are notoriously bad at timing."
Bought some 8.50 call options expiring tomorrow on the bet that last-minute progress in DC will chum the markets tomorrow. Could be a terrible bet... we'll see. Contracts were going for $.02/ea.
I thought higher interest rates were supposed to help REITs. Why is NLY down everyday?
Somebody say block trade??3.87Mil Buy @8.44
"Feb 18, Annaly celebrates 25 years as a company. 1997-2022"
"Expectation of favorable interest rate environment allows for more ""Bingo""."
"Added to my holdings here in the mid $8s. Tuesday, coming back from the holiday, we should see the beginning of a sustained ascent."
Distribution earning .30 so Mr. CEO time to raise dividend by 1cent.
OJ What i read from most of the post on this board you seem to have the best knowledge about where this company is headed. What do you think there future price will be in the next 6 months?i
"Can someone please post something meaningful here? Can people stop cheerleading? Am I the only one who took a look at their earnings and didn't like what I saw?I have no idea why this stock is rallying right now. Well, maybe it is moving with the market. But judging from what I saw, I now understand why they kept the dividend at 22 cents.Here are some highlights from their earnings release.Leverage is down. No, it's not a good thing. High leverage = a lot of borrowing. A lot of borrowing = making profits on borrowed money. Less borrowing = less profits. SImple math.They did something very creative with their accounting. ONe thing I saw was that they made a big reduction in their hedges. That's how they managed to squeeze that extra penny on their revenue. But everyone is getting all euphoric over that penny and predicting the ""from here to the Moon"" price.They clearly stated they are worried about what the Fed will do. Do you know what that means? it means they will be spending money on hedges (swaps). Soon. More hedges = less profits.They are gradually shifting to mortgage service rights and whole loans. That's a very profitable business but it's riskier than agency MBS business and it's NOT protected by the government. By straying from their core business, they give you a hint that they are worried about their agency business. It's a small shift that will make them more money but it makes me worried. How far will they take it?How about book value dropping from almost 9 to 8.30+. Who thinks it's a good thing? Raise your hands.All the numbers from their earnings release are lower than they were in the last quarter and lower than they were the same time a year ago. But who pays attention to that? Nothing to worry about. We held this stock blindly for 20 years. We don't have to worry about it now. I bet that's what the shareholders of GE were thinking.The most significant thing was what I DIDN'T see in the highlights. It was the number of high-rate MBS maturing and getting replaced with new low-rate MBS. They mentioned these numbers in their last earnings release. So many 4.5% MBS were replaced with so many 2.5% MBS. Hmm, I wonder why they decided not to mention it this time.And everyone is cheering and applauding. Hey, it's time to do some buybacks, it's time to raise the dividend. We invest in NLY to make money and I for one want to know if NLY can make money going forward. But this board seems to be overflowing with ""God will provide"" and ""we are the greatest"" comments."
"Not too bad considering, and only a quarter of interest volatility and could settle down. Good time to pick if it goes to 8.20 or below"
Mute A
Announcement out...22cents again.
People say if the Fed raises rates that’s it’s good and bad for companies like NLY which is it?
"Regarding Q3 earnings, It will be of interest to know the allocation of monies from the sale of the Commercial assets closure."
"Would be nice if they would raise the dividend a penny just to break the long term trend of cutting it. I think if they did, investor confidence would bring the price back to $9.50-$10.00 quickly."
Accumulate under 8.20
My best most stable REIT remains GOOD. APTS is holding its own too but volatile.
How will this hold up if we have a crash? I’m new to mreits.
No NLY won't see $8.20 any time soon.
Hope you bought the dip. NLY very safe remainder of the year and probably beyond. NLY insulated from any major problems. No repeat of that 2012 pounding. Stay long and get rewarded.
Can we hit $9.00 by the 9/17 option expiration!?
It seems the MM want to have the PPs a bit above the magic $8.50 post ex-div to keep technicals clean and not trigger algos. Makes sense. So I would think a buy a 8.50 - 8.53 for long term hold is a safe bet. Short term the chinese thing is far from over
The Call buying volume is crazy. I guess just cheap bets on decent short term move. GLTA
Average analyst rating is outperform. Average analyst PT is $8.50 to $9.25. Today is profit taking and debt default fretting. I'm still accumulating shares on pull backs. Thinking about future share appreciation and potential 2022 dividend increase.
those days in such an overvalued market and inflation I see a good hiding hole here lol ... amazing divident ...
Parked 10k in with NLY for 5 years . Now let’s see it grow . Put my money to good use gte management!
"Hey y'all, is ex-date Sept 30th? I bought at $8.69 and am in the green now. Tempted to take some profit and hope for another dip before Ex... would that be unlikely? Will it likely keep rising until after the ex-date?"
This is a solid part of an income portfolio. nothing more.
"China red flag! What do you guys heavy in REIT think of the Evergrande default to come? I have followedtis in the background, holding me in anything Banking or R.E. now it seems the Chinese gov wont bail them out.Is this gonna get like 2008 Chinese version all over again?You guys know that Chinese are money crazy and have speculated to a level unheard of. Some Joe shmo buying 4 to 6 unfinished appartment in ghost cities. This has gone on for a while but now coming to an end causing a possible sever liquidity issue in china.My fear is too many greedy b.ta.rd here have invested money there. Like UBS and other. Also Many chinese banks may need ccash and will start selling the global markets (hint could be last week and mostly Friday - and the Gold market sell off) causing a panic in an overvalued market.I am not trying to stear the pot but am trying to understand how thta china debacle could affect us and how hard. Also how this would impact NLY because rates may rise out of this.The clock starts monday so may be being prepared Sunday night would be good. The 2 dates for bail outs are Monday and Thursday from what I see."
"Still waiting for some sparks. NLY is dead for now. 10Y creeping up but no signs of life. Will definitely wait for 8.80 and breaking 8.48 could be a worry. Technically yesterday was not supposed to be a sell day with all the technical flags in play (20 and 50MA, FIb.).The bound range is also too tight to play and could breakdown easily."
Accumulate under 8.20. That seems to be the buy line.
Oversold
Next dividend increased to $0.23/share?
"Folks, I could be wrong, but this company should be the most boring equity in your portfolio (me 10%). Reinvest the dividends and reassess in say…five years (not quite the rule of 72).It’s a good company."
"It's that time of the month.Historically, NLY declares dividends for this quarter between the 9th and 11th of the month. The moment of truth is coming this week or early next week, and so far, judging by price action, it looks like a lot of people finally stopped holding on to an illusion that a big dividend spike is coming.If they declare the same 22 cents, I will say ""thank you"" and wait for the end of the month to become eligible."
"You don't trade Reits for pennies, you Drip and get the rewards of compound interest."
"To everyone who replied regarding my housing, thank you.I just extended my closing with zillow because I cannot find another home/townhome to buy here in Raleigh. Things have gone up another 10% in 60 days in some spots. I may back out of the whole thing but I did want to move and zillow offered me $100K more than Offerpad.Zillow and Offerpad both ""claim"" markets are slowing. Well, it isn't actually the case when you have 1 day to decide on spending $500,000 hard earned dollars. I did find a short-term living situation that is cheap and I can clear my head.Housing here in Raleigh is still hyperinflationary due to the Apple and Google effect and a few other companies moving in. I have been in my home for 12 years and I can say I sold/gave away most of my things in preparation for my move and now.....Thank you everyone for your feedback. Donna"
The price rises as we get near the x date 9-29 as they want to capture the div then the price falls over the next weeks.
Break thru 9 on the run up to divident? I hope.
"The share price for this stock follows the dividend. 10% is the magic number. If the dividends goes up, the stock price will follow and vice-versa. If the company is sincere about a stock buyback, then a lower stock price is obvious which means no dividend increase. I don't think a stock buyback will happen anytime soon so the possibility of a dividend increase is possible."
"@P mentioned bitcoin in one of his posts. I thought I would explain the whole crypto thing. If anyone is interested, read on. It is going to be a very long post.Regular currency is normally controlled by a government that issues it. People often complain that governments constantly manipulate currency, and I agree that sometimes they go overboard with printing money or taking it out of circulation. The important thing to know is that manipulation is an absolutely necessity.Let me give you one example.If you have a business in the US that buys materials or goods from Japan, you are not going to pay for those goods with US dollars. You will spend 100 dollars to buy 10,000 yen and make a payment to your Japanese supplier in local currency. But let's say the US government printed a lot more money. That weakened the US dollar and now you have to pay 120 dollars for 10,000 yen. You are losing money and you either have to raise prices on the product you sell or start buying goods in another country whose currency is weaker than that of Japan.The fluctuation of one currency vs. another occurs naturally, but it is also a result of governments' manipulation. In the above example, US customers have to pay more for Japanese goods and Japanese customers can pay less for US goods.So, this money manipulation is a never-ending balancing act.The US government doesn't want to make a dollar too weak because everything the US customer buys in another country becomes more expensive. It also doesn't want to make the currency too strong because US goods will become too expensive for foreign customers and they will start buying somewhere else.Cryptocurrency doesn't have anything supporting it. It's basically monopoly money. It was a theoretical exercise for smart people who created it. Satoshi Nakamoto. The most attractive part about this exercise was that this artificial currency can not be manipulated by any government. Aw, how idealistic. They even created a ""mining"" process to gradually increase the supply, which for Bitcoin will end in about 100 years.Ok, then. Let's ask ourselves this question. What is the point of having an ""unmanipulated"" currency when, as I explained, manipulation is necessary while we have so many countries with their own currencies and their own foreign trade? What's the use of cryptocurrency anyway?You have artificial money that you can use to pay for things. Why would I want to pay for something with Bitcoin when I can pay for it with my credit card? I can delay payment for a month and I will get 2% back of everything I spend. Also, cryptocurrency fluctuates. You paid $20,000 worth of bitcoin to buy a car. Tomorrow, Bitcoin goes up 20%. You say to yourself, I should have kept it and I and would now have $24,000 worth of the Bitcoin. I would buy a car and have $4,000 left.Anonymity. But cash is also anonymous. Why bother with digital currency when you can pay with cash? Speaking of anonymity. That's where Blockchain technology comes in. Blockchain is the way cryptocurrency is tracked, how it is stored and exchanged. Blockchain provides unprecedented anonymity. No names. It's digital cash. You can pay for anything you want with Bitcoin and nobody can trace that payment back to you. You can buy a kilo of cocaine and have it delivered to your house, and if the FBI breaks down your door and catches you with your fingers deep inside the package with white powder they have no proof you paid for it. You can say, yes, I received this package but I have no idea who sent it to me. I was just about to call you.But this anonymity of cryptocurrency is starting to look a little shaky. We all saw what happened with the Colonial pipeline shutdown. All the money was recovered. Hmm. Also, governments are starting to go after people who own cryptocurrency. They are forcing exchanges to report all transactions. That means, the government may not know what you spent your Bitcoin on, but they know your name and they know how much of it you have and if you spend it, you will have to pay taxes on the appreciation. Do they know how much cash you have in your pocket?So, why is everyone is so excited about it?Everyone you see on TV is a liar. Their goal is to push something they can sell you for more money than they paid for it. These people have no shame. They look into the camera and I can see that they don't believe what they are saying.Other people are afflicted with gambling syndrome. They bought Bitcoin for $5 and now it's worth $40,000 and they think it makes them the best investors in the world when in fact, they are just as good as people who bought a lottery ticket and won.Cryptocurrency can be kept outside exchanges and it can be somewhat anonymous. But the only real use for it is to pay for something illegal. There is no other practical use for it.If anyone wants to know how Blockchain works I can explain it. That would be a bit technical, so beware."
"Government debt means nothing, .The more money you put into the hands of the middle class the better. The Billionaire trickle down scam has failed 3 times now..You won't see that again."
"14 years ago NLY average share price range was $13 to 16, and averaged around $1.45/year dividend. Today $8.36 and $0.88, respectively. Again Total Return on invested capital is imperative."
Need to break through $8.70
"Earnings are coming out today. Also, the ex-dividend date is tomorrow. The price will drop by 22 cents. Or more. Or less. We will see.I am going to read whatever they will release and I will post my thoughts on it either tomorrow or on Friday. Nothing really changed in the past 3 months. Treasury rates went up and came down, but 3 months is not enough time to affect NLY's earnings. Unless they did something drastic with their swap hedges I expect their earnings to be the same as they were the last quarter."
If you think interest rates will slowly move up then buy this stock. If you feel interest rates are retreating then don’t buyI bought a lot about a month ago
Dang it….missed buying those $8.50s again. Good money to be made in those weekly calls. From 2 cents to $15 cents. Ouch. Such is life.
what happens to NLY when rates increase?
"CFRA MAINTAINS HOLD OPINION ON SHARES OF ANNALY CAPITAL MANAGEMENTWe maintain our target price of $9 per share, equal to 1.1x NLY's book value andnear its long-term average. We raise our 2021 EPS estimate by $0.04 to $1.13 butkeep 2022 at $1.02. NLY reported Q2 core EPS of $0.30 vs. $0.27, $0.02 aboveconsensus. NLY confirmed that the recent $0.30 in earnings over the pastquarters are likely the high-water mark and will moderate going forward. Bookvalue declined slightly to $8.37 per share from $8.95 last quarter. Economicleverage was 5.8x, down from the 6.1x last quarter. We think NLY will keepleverage lower than normal given risks of economic uncertainty and the potentialfor a rise in interest rates. Net interest margins continue to rise (up to 2.09%from 1.91% last year). NLY acknowledged rising inflation, but is of the viewthat this is still largely the result of supply bottlenecks and pandemic-relatedreopening, given that yields continue to fall. However, we are more skepticalthat the current inflation pressures will be short term and remain ""transitory."""
October is a bad month for stocks.
Clearly running with 10yr.
"It’s been an unusual year so I wouldn’t be surprised to see a one time special dividend at the end of the year. I don’t expect that, but I think it could be more likely this year."
"Dividend increase would be nice but more than happy with the current .88, low payout ratio and the share price in the $8-9 range for the next five years. Yield on cost just passed 11.4% annually and will grow with reinvesting each quarter. The power of compound interest is truly amazing."
"NLY HAS TO MANY SHARE OUTSTANDING TO PAY DIVS. ON,,,1.4 BILLION SHARES,,,THERE DIV. EXPENSE IS OVER $100 MILLION + WITH THERE PREFERREDS THAT THEY MUST PAY ON ALSO...I AM LOADED WITH AGNC, WHICH HAS ONLY 525 MILLION S/OUTSTANDING...PLUS AGNC HAS $4.7 BILLION CASH TO ADD MORTGAGES...AGNC IS BEST IN CLASS,,,IT'S SAD THAT MANY INVESTORS BUY THE CHEAP REITS...CHEAP IS CHEAP FOR A REASON..."
The Dividend is paid monthly so if you buy for the dividend you are only going to get 1/12 of the yearly dividend
looks like the party's over before extended got up to 895 like I thought now let's see how far it drops with all the options being played it shouldn't go down too far and then start back up that's what I see
"Annaly makes money borrowing short and lending long. With a flat yield curve, as we currently have, the amount Annaly makes is reduced. That reduces the value of the stock. However the yield curve cannot get much flatter, in the long run. When the yield curve steepens, Annaly will make a lot of money. Since there is nuch more room on he upside in yield, than there is downside. I think the probabilities point to increased earnings."
"the problem with nly is to many shares, 1.4 billion to pay divs. on. way to many. agnc only has 540 million shares and $4.7 billion cash."
"There are some smart people here and I need some feedback, please.I just sold my only home in Raleigh. Will receive $570K.My first question is do I buy another home? Prices are going up by the week. I don't love it here but it is a hot market but when does it end? Second question, I own NLY and AGNC. Terrible performance and I barely understand the way they make money. Can someone ""make it not hurt"" and extrapolate in an easy way exactly how NLY and AGNC will benefit when rates creep higher or will rates creep higher? Lastly, I heard reverse repos will be the death of the housing market. If anyone can explain, great.Thank you all. I am very nervous NOT owning a home but I was happy to let go of the house I presently live in while I don't have to stage, and deal with humans. Sold to zillow. Maybe yet another mistake. Thanks in advance everyone."
"ok, I am finally in as a new buyer. 8.51 in both my Roth and Trad Ira's. I would say this is safer than my riskier ORC mreit with a 15% div paid monthly. ORC has been steady so far but that high div keeps me on edge and watching closely. I think NLY is more stable but I do see they cut 2 times the div since 2019. I think the current economic environment will keep these going up from here. Long income investor."
Does this mean you are locked in the dividends if you buy in before Sep 29 ?
"added to my position. bought 15,000 at $8.53 today"
"I have followed this stock for years. In a stable or rising interest rate environment this stock will go upIn an environment where interest rates are trending down then it will lose valueInterest rates at historic lows right now Today I bought $100,000 worth because my guess is interest rates are more likely to go up as not much room IMO to go down muchI also bought $100,000 of DXSame type of company paying about the same dividend rateI like this one also since interest is paid monthly as opposed to quarterly"
beat estimates as usual so I guess well go red
"Now that the Fed Taper Appears Priced In, Mortgage-Backed Securities May Deserve a Second LookArticle publishedBy: Andrew Szczurowski, CFA & Chip Driscoll, CFA Article published on: October 6, 2021Boston - While spreads have ground tighter this year in almost every sector of the bond market, there is one AAA-rated sector that has bucked the trend and now sits at cheaper levels than in January. We are referring to the second most liquid bond market in the world (behind U.S. Treasurys) — the agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) market.For many investors in the agency MBS market, summer 2021 could not end soon enough. Excess returns relative to Treasurys began deteriorating in early May as talk of the Fed potentially tapering its asset purchases picked up steam, causing MBS spreads to widen by more than 20 basis (bps). Meanwhile, spreads across most other high-quality fixed income sectors like investment grade (IG) corporates saw little change, which resulted in a large relative performance gap.Agency MBS have underperformed IG corporates so far in 2021We believe that after this summer's underperformance, agency MBS look cheap relative to other high-quality areas of U.S. fixed income, and the sector warrants a second look from bond investors who want to go up in quality and yield at the same time.Why have MBS spreads been widening?The prospects of the Federal Reserve slowing its current monthly pace of $40 billion in new MBS purchases has certainly been a headwind for the sector in recent months, as other investors will have to absorb reduced demand from the Fed. Falling long-end Treasury yields often suggest lower mortgage rates and faster prepayment activity, which can also lead to wider MBS spreads.We feel that the market has exaggerated this second impact in recent months. Yes, rates have fallen since the start of the summer, but the average 30-year mortgage rate is still 20 bps higher than the all-time lows we hit back in February.We also believe rates are likely to rise this fall as additional Treasury supply comes into the market and the labor market continues to heal. As a result, we don't expect another wave of refinancing activity, which the market seems to be pricing in.Some might ask, ""Why should I invest in agency MBS when the Fed is going to pare back their purchases in the market? Shouldn't I be selling?"" We have believed that the Fed would taper their MBS and Treasury purchases by the end of 2021, and now this seems likely to occur at the November FOMC meeting. We would keep in mind that the MBS market — like every market — is forward looking: Events get priced in long before the day they happen.How did MBS perform during the last taper cycle?History gives us a good guide into this when we look at the taper tantrum in 2013. Agency MBS spreads actually widened relative to Treasurys well before then-Fed Chair Ben Bernanke mentioned the word ""tapering"" on May 22. MBS tapering wasn't officially announced until the December FOMC meeting. By the time tapering actually started in early January 2014, MBS spreads had almost completely retraced all their pre-taper widening. Admittedly, history doesn't have to repeat itself, but it often rhymes.MBS spreads widened long before and actually tightened after Bernanke's announcementWhere does that leave spreads today?The recent moves in the agency MBS and IG corporate markets have pushed spreads into rare territory. Since 2010, agency MBS spreads have traded on average roughly 6 bps tighter than single-A rated corporate bonds, which might be expected since agency MBS are AAA-rated, government-guaranteed securities.However, the headwinds we have discussed recently pushed spreads on agency MBS to more than 25 bps wider than single-A rated corporates — a spread differential that has only been breached twice since 2010. And each time, agency MBS went on to outperform single-A corporates over the ensuing 12 months.Agency MBS have outperformed IG corporates after spreads widenedWhat would cause agency MBS spreads to tighten?Many scenarios could cause agency MBS spreads to tighten. We think the most obvious catalyst would be U.S. money managers covering their massive underweight in agency MBS. They have been net sellers of more than $600 billion of agency MBS over the past two years and now sit at their lowest allocation since the beginning of 2016.Money managers have reallocated away from agency MBSmbs1005chartDMany moved into IG corporates for core bond funds over that period, which has worked out well for money managers. But we suspect the ability to go up in yield and quality could prove too compelling for them to pass up going forward.The second tailwind that could provide a nice boost for the agency MBS market would a backup in Treasury yields. Supply has been running two to three times normal levels on a daily basis — thanks to not only a strong housing market but also near"
I'm glad I dumped money here. The rest of the market tanks and it holds steady plus the dividend
"I think I'm going to start accumulating shares in NLY. Just take portions of profits in trades to put into NLY as it has a decent dividend and price with good free cash flow. While I don't expect large growth in value or dividend, I'm satisfied with this price to dividend ratio if it maintains."
What’s driving up the price today?
Look at out 5 year graph. You can see Covid drop and then some recovery in price. Look at IVR. No recovery…yet
"Funny to read posts here talking about price fluctuations. A nickel here a buck there. Go look at the 5-day chart of vaccine maker Moderna, MRNA. Monday afternoon it was a few bucks shy of $500. Now? $385. Over a $100 drop in less than 48 hours. Why? Good news came out showing their vaccine more effective than Pfizer’s against delta variant. LOL."
added more at 8.41 !!! position getting built!
"After tomorrow ex-dividend share price adjustment, I think the most probable and favorable share price entry buy points are between $8.44 and $8.56."
"Today will tell the short term. We are right at a short term support uptrend line from 08/05. The support is 8.48-8.50. if we breakdown thru this, it will be a sell signal into the 8.20. If we rebound, the stock may prove on a mild uptrend to flat going forward thus a possible buy for long termers since 8.50ish will prove to be support . I could say there is a slight uptrend channel is 8.50 to 8.80. That is not enough paly for me to scalp in that channel. The prior one early the year was way better. although the current price is slightly below a lot of key levels talked about earlier (20, 50, 200 Ma and FIB, flat volume, flat money flow, flat RSI) so there is no way right now to tell what is next technically.As talked earlier, the expectation of divi raise is dead as the action shows. I bet it wont change because cutting it would be disastrous and nothing warrants it.Today. watching AMZN for final gap fill and missed PYPL gap filling. it took a beating right after the fill so I watch t again.Anyone can figure Gold??"
Book value is $8.37 and beats on income by .02
Accumulating shares in low to mid $8.40's.
"I’m not an expert in this area, may be J.o., he says he is, but generally the spread is what’s important. Now this quarter even with low short term interest being so low the book value of REITs decreased. Mostly people say it’s because of the anticipation of fed tapering down the MBS buying. That will decrease most of MBS companies holdings in value. That’s one way yuu could get hurt even holding the MBS, and i think that’s why NLY management they started looking for more riskier assets. The other way is what also happened this quarter which I think it’s transient, the 2-year shut up and 10-year rate went down from the highs. That also hurts the bottom line for them. Going forward A steep yield curve in which longer-term rates are significantly higher than shorter-term rates is the ideal environment for mREITs, and that’s precisely the scenario we probably get in next few quarters, all depending what happens to inflation and 10-year. I disagree with most people if the 10- year doesn’t shoot you, the fed will raise the interest rate for midterm, but they may taper down by the end of the year. Also don’t forget these companies learned a lot from the last financial crisis so they are well equipped for any uncertainty. Hope I didn’t confuse you more but this is what my take has been in the past "
"New to this. New to dividend stocks. That stage of life when growth stocks are no longer sexy but dividends are. :-)so how does this work? I buy 1000 shares, I get paid $220 per quarter. Is that correct? Are these dividends reinvested or are these dividends cashable? I am looking to live off the dividend income.sorry for basic questions. insights appreciated.happy weekend folks."
"Had few yrs now, getting over 800$ a qtr now and reinvesting each time. Mad I did not load up when it was under 5 when market tanked in 2020."
Didn’t help Zacks gave it a sell rating. Not that I listen to them but I guess some people do. I would “guess” dividend stays up at 22 cents resulting in a 10+% dividend.
"If NLY made 30 cents a share with only 4.6% leverage and interest rates essentially at zero, imagine what they'll make when rates move back up and they put more leverage back on. Their management is the best in the business regarding the mREITS space."
"$8.50’s as expected nobody’s fooling. smart monies sold $8.90’s, for a 4% gain "
Turning off my automatic DRIP. Seeing a pattern here over the past year where my DRIP buys at the higher level. That's not fun.
Has NLY ever reduced its dividend?
NLY share price is primarily reflective of it's EPS. Earnings increase over time diividend increase. Earnings decrease over time dividend decrease. It's not complicated.
Supreme Court just ruled in favor of landlords
"The $9 calls for this Friday closed at 2 cents. I did not make it out of work in time to buy any. Might tryin morning but got a feeling won’t be picking up any that cheap. 20,000 calls x $0.02 = $400. Beer money. Can be worth $2-4,000 before Friday. Just my very humble, and sometimes wrong, opinion. JMVH-ASWO. Thought I would start a new acronym."
Looks like the post dividend trauma is over. The yearly chart looks like a continued upward trend to 9 to 9.25 before the next dividend. CALLS the last few days were way too cheap to pass the up.
"couldn’t believe this touched $8.70 after earnings with BV $8.39. I sold 20,000 shares at $8.65. waiting for a better entry than the $8.20 range. May buy some at $8. Lot of uncertainty in the markets, regarding Covid and the Fed."
$7.99 is the bargain  price!
"I love the stability in NLY price. I came late to the party, but my avg 8.76 since May has me in the green after dividends at today's price. I'll buy more below 8.50, but I don't see this dipping below 7.75 without another housing crisis."
