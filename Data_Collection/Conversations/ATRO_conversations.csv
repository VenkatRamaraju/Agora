Anybody see the Class B dividend shares today? Not at Schwab so far.
Found some interesting information regarding shorts for $ATRO https://marketwirenews.com/short-information/NASDAQ/ATRO
"That's 23% in 2 months. For comparison, TSLA is flat to down in the same time frame."
Apple iPad. 3 new models launching in 2017. Huge potential order for ATRO's test systems business.
We are hearing the same things again and again. But the facts are there for you to see: this company is not growing and is actually heading closer to bankruptcy each quarter. I think the company will sell out for about $20 per share before that happens but no one is going to make any money with Astronics. Each quarter is worse than the prior one.
"Looks like the recovery is slowing down according to the Fed. today. This is going to be terrible for all my Aerospace stocks, especially the microcaps like this one. :("
What a disaster. Again! Each and every lack of earnings report.

Lack of earnings report due on Friday. Stock should drop by close to ten percent then.
Decent earnings report and it appears investors are becoming hopeful in growth again.
"More business from Collins and Boeing . ATRO is looking better and better. Will it become a buyout target? Big customer base, big product line,and low share price make this very interesting as a strand alone or buyout candidate."
ATRO is up 12.21% to 8.27
ATRO is down -10.27% to 38.13
Astronics is down 6.75% to 14.51
Another downgrade and a HUGE selloff. Now ATRO needs a reason to for investors to buy.
why is this going up on top and bottom line misses?!
Astronics is down 8.77% to 16.81
ATRO is up 5.29% to 21.29
"1.3 times average daily volume. 24 million shares outstanding. 264,000 is traded today. Down 6% on the day. Nothing to see here folks. ATRO is still looking very interesting. Obviously informed owners were not rattled buy the report. Better luck next time Bob?"
"The trend here is down, down, down. This seems to get worse every day."

Hello. Is anybody here? No posts in nearly a month
ATRO is up 6.57% to $30.33
Can we hit a new low this week? I think so.
ATRO reached a 52 Week low at 15.22
Astronics is up 9.89% to 10.44
ATRO is up 10.33% to 8.33
"Oh, great. Now ATRO made Zack's list of ""strong sell"" stocks. Why? Drop in earning estimates. Haven't I been saying this?"
ATRO is down 13.14% to 8.13
Astronics is down 7.51% to 6.40
Where are the new contracts ATRO was expecting? Where is the business? I'll wait-- but not for long.
Astronics is down 6.93% to 15.93
"As expected, another ""lack-of-earnings"" report. I'm not surprised. At least they are consistent."
Quarterly earnings report coming. More sure than ever that it won't be good. Already 80 million dollars less on the sale of the test systems business. (And no AeroSat antenna business to make up for that) More forward-looking statements will be forthcoming.
I'm trying to post about why this popped today but yahoo keeps deleting it
"Well, ATRO investors, once again it's wait until next year. Any thoughts on firing Peter?"
ATRO is up 5.64% to 13.67
ATRO is down 8.64% to 11.27
ATRO reached a 52 Week low at 26.33
what are your thoughts on this one?
Another tip off to a bad earnings report is when the company issues a PR piece the day before the release.
"I was wrong about the report but there were a couple of red flags in it. Why are receivables so high? Test systems is still losing money? Anyway, I am glad it wasn't as bad as I anticipated but I'm still not excited because I don't see a lot of growth-- only prospective growth and gains which we hear about each and every report. But hey, the stock price is out of the 20's so I'm not in the red."
It seems each time there is a 15 percent distribution the stock declines WAY more. If all goes according to past history ATRO will decline another five dollars.
Another huge percentage drop. I know my opinions are not popular but so far I haven't been wrong. The stock price is dying.
"All this good news and the executives are selling their stock. CEO Gundermann and VP Kramer have done nothing but sell shares , this really gives me a boost in confidence. When have they bought shares to show investors that they have faith in the company ? SHAME SHAME SHAME"
Great quarter! Congrats to the long term shareholders. The remaining 2018 outlook is looking good per Mr. Gunderman’s statements.
"Thank you, ATRO, for taking my last post to heart. Although a bit vague, it appears the new business will generate some decent revenue."
"For what it's worth, I like this new acquisition. (Diagnosys) This has potential to produce some growth-- finally."
What has happened? No more press releases? Does that mean things are going along pretty good?
ATRO is down -6.47% to 39.83
"Nice reaction this morning to yesterday's press release. Would like to see continued strength leading up to earnings release. MIght consider selling some if we get to $35, otherwise will hold through earnings report. GLTA."
Anybody know what this law suit is about?
Two interesting announcements today but the stock price is still heading down. Why? The same reason as always. Profits?
It's been a great rally. Can we hope it won't be dumped like it was at the end of April? I still have some worries about it because what is happening now with the stock market has a very strong resemblance to that great dump which I still can't forget
Guidance looks good . Stock will improve after ATRO digests acquisitions.
I sense a better than expected earnings report! Whenever that is!
It's a long position. Tough last year and tough this year. They still have the patent cases to work out as well.
ATRO is up 5.00% to $30.03
It appears the stock price got a head of itself especially with 2 strong buys. We will probably see 12.00 before 15.00.
Looks like a good time to be in energy and banks for now. Microcap aerospace looks better in a year or so IMO.
Astronics is up 6.50% to 18.83
Astronics is up 11.19% to 7.55
Astronics is up 13.10% to 8.07
ATRO is down 5.25% to $35.77
The price seems to have a new floor in the $27-28 range. Thoughts?
I can see ATRO getting as low as $16 a share within a couple of months.
"Yes, I was right. And this is just the first day of the sell-off."
Great buying opportunity
Selling part of the company may be a good first step. They've got to do something or the share price will only drift lower.
"On today's announcement: One plane? Two? Well, even one is better than none."
"It looks like we have a new base of about $30. I just bought more in the $32’s and feeling confident as a long term shareholder for the next 2-5 years.@BobB They wouldn’t be doing stock splits if things weren’t going well. Once they get those acquisitions turned around that are creating some losses and dragging on the net operating income, things will improve even more. You could always invest in Boeing but they seem pretty spendy right now. This is an a good day trading or active trading stock, it’s a good long-term hold and I already put forth those numbers for analysis on a prior post.Have a good Autumn season everybody."
ATRO reached a 52 Week high at 40.42
ATRO reached a 52 Week low at 8.00
This stock is a real snooze-fest.
Has there ever been an earnings release on a Friday before? I don't think I like this....
"Wow, fire sale"
I am hoping Co will issue B shares this year.Fingers crossed!
"I sure miss the prior format for Yahoo bulletin boards. I'm not opposed to change, but the amount of ""conversation"" on the boards for all the stocks I own has been drastically reduced, and replaced primarily with various ""ultimatestocktips"" type spam ads. That said, on the subject of ATRO, I see the recent announcement of another 15% Class B stock distribution as a sign that management is confident in their expectations for growth in earnings, so reason for some optimism heading into next quarter's earnings release. Just my opinion. GLTA."
Today's announcement looks interesting. Who is the competition here?
Looking pretty grim.
ATRO is down 13.40% to 7.95
Nasdaq up 4.25% and this stinker is only recovering a third of its big drop yesterday.
ATRO is down 45.62% to 8.00
CCC acquisition. What was the cost? It looks good on paper. Any thoughts?
"Uh, oh. Press release today. Generally this indicates a bad quarterly report is coming. Batten down the hatches, Matey."
Another new low on pretty good volume. At this time a share price below $20 doesn't seem unreasonable to me. And the reason is that there isn't a growth driver.
Astronics reached a 52 Week low at 8.00
ATRO is up 11.47% to 8.26
ATRO reached a 52 Week high at 42.91
Based upon experience I expect to see a closing price of $27 or less within the month.
Astronics is down 7.11% to 16.32
"And ATRO made Zack's list of Strong Sell stocks. How can you be the aerospace sector and not grow? Or have the share price decrease? I take small comfort only in the fact that I've been right on with this stock for months now. If it's down on an ""up"" day can you imagine the share price when the overall market is ""down""?"
Astronics is up 14.73% to 10.98
It's good to see the share price head up finally. I'm not buying more because the price drop can be so steep and I need to see growth in revenues and profits. But the higher it goes the less I worry about a $30 per share buyout. Now a $35 per share buyout.
ATRO is down 7.41% to 16.86
Looking good again today. Very good volume accompanying a very good increase in pps.
Dec 31 ATRO was $13. Today $16. Not bad for 2 months. Still would be a good buyout candidate

just bought 2000 shares at $10.47
"I guess today's news was NOT what someone was anticipating. Ugh! Very disappointing, but at least the number of shares traded was relatively light."
New lows. I was right again. That was easy!
"Oh, boy. Now ATRO is peddling soap. Good grief!"
ATRO is down 7.17% to 21.10

Tomorrow is probably going to be horrible. Will we close below $25?
maybe the robinhood kids will notice this lil beauty

Stop the worthless PR and show us a contract or two.
"stick with ATRO!! they've been a great company for over 40 years, and i'm confident they will start heading back up very soon"
ATRO reached a 52 Week low at 12.59
I didn't expect to close below $10 but here we are. Before bankruptcy is declared I would expect a reverse split.
I am afraid 10 is the new 12.
ATRO reached a 52 Week low at 19.22
"Another new product announcement, however, no mention of any sales increases anywhere. I'm still bearish."
Woof!
"Great day! (Thanks, Boeing.) I know it can't last but ""come on $40."" I'd love to break even."
Two announcements by ATRO today. More or less meaningless. We desperately need some announcements on new contracts.
"Historically, releasing results on a Friday means bad news. Get ready for another sell-off."
anyone know what's going on with ATRO? It's been on a terror. Almost like they have a suitor
ATRO reached a 52 Week low at 17.60
ATRO is up 10.81% to 9.12
"@BobB If you bought the stock 5 years ago at $26.06 and held, each share would be worth $53.43 based on today's closing with the 82.8% adjustment for the four splits that occurred in that time frame. That's a 105% return over five years even with the recent drop from around $40 to $29.23. If a person took profits at some of those tops over that five years and bought back in at some of the lows or even above those lows, that return would be much higher. It's been a great stock if you know how to hold it and take some profits. Part of what has hit the shares recently is the same thing as every other stock, which is the over all market shares. Add the recent stock split to that and here we are.I'm still long and recently bought more shares at $31.82."

"I fancy myself as ""the oracle of ATRO"" as I am correct so often after following them for so long. History repeats itself again and again."
If anyone has a compelling reason to BUY this stock please post it soon. Too many people seem to agree with me and are selling!
"We are back in the $28 area-- Ralph, when was this at $178?!?-- and I still find no compelling reason to buy in. Where's the growth? I guess a lot of investors agree with me."
"Eugene, looking for an entry point with this company is ""wait until next quarter."" It seems to be worse each quarter. Or I could say, ""How much money are you looking to lose?"""
AMAC Aerospace. ONE airplane?!
Atro is feeling really #$%$ today
"Does anyone on this board know for a fact if any Astronics equipment is used on Boeings 737 Max 8's? If so, please share your information. If not, please share that also. Thanks."
Wow. I'm speechless. I don't think the price will ever recover to what it was. I wish I had gone with my gut-feeling and sold it all a couple of months ago.
ATRO is down -5.47% to 36.45
Astronics reached a 52 Week low at 16.86
"Looks like profit will not go up until at least Q4. Unless ATRO gets acquired, the stock isn't going anywhere until they can catch up to even their current market value."
ATRO made Zack's list of Strong Sell stocks. This company is certainly having problems lately. Good PR though.
Astronics is down 6.44% to 17.71
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/astronics-corporation-reports-2018-third-211500402.htmlGreat quarter setting up for another good year 2019.I expect another b share distribution again by October 2019. I wouldn't be surprised Atro will be trading around 50 to 60 by then.
"More of the same. ""Someday we will make money."" Sure. I've heard this many times before. For some reason this company can't get any large contracts."
"Again we have a couple of press releases just prior to the quarterly report. Past experience tells me the numbers will not be good. A couple of days to prove me wrong, Peter."
"Anyone have thoughts about the flurry of news releases (PR) while the analysts are expecting less in earnings for this quarter? Not a bad company overall but it is always promising that ""next quarter we expect new contracts."" I'm not seeing it."
"I've been with this company for over 40 years, and they've never been a loser. I think the wild swings are due more to uninformed money seekers than to anything the company is/isn't doing. I agree with James... hang in and you will do well."

"I just read the earnings report and it looks good. Great 2018, decent outlook for 2019 and really, the only disappointment is with the Test division in Q4 and the Test division's outlook for 2019. As usual, Aerospace will carry 90% of the revenue and profit but they had a really strong 2018 and Q4 coupled with their best sales backlog in several years.I'm actually surprised the stock isn't up more into the $35-37 range given these results and given the 2019 outlook. Thoughts?"
Astronics is up 10.37% to 12.45
"Satellite connectivity. ATRO got into the business via its acquisition of Aerosat in late 2013. At the time, GOGO was Aerosat's largest customer. About a year later, GOGO announced it was switching antenna suppliers from ATRO to Thinkom. As the GOGO business went away, very little other business replaced it as most airlines went with the GOGO package. In late 2014 when this switch happened, GOGO stock was about $20/sh. Today GOGO stock is $4/sh, down from $11 at the start of 2018. What?? They were winning all the business. Well, as recently disclosed by GOGO, turns out they were selling their connectivity system at a huge loss, as well as guaranteeing the airlines certain revenues from passenger update of the service. No wonder most airlines were taking the GOGO system, and not other systems that may have utilized the ATRO antenna. This explains a lot of what's happened the last 4 years to ATRO's antenna business.Going forward, I believe ATRO is going to reap the benefits of substantial investment in this area. Starting in 2020, satellite connectivity is going to undergo a massive improvement as high throughput satellites (HTS) and extreme high throughput satellites (XTS) 10-30x the speed and bandwidth available. LEO and MEO satellite constellations will also change the game. A new generation of antenna and related equipment will go into use, and that's where I believe most of ATRO's R&D dollars for connectivity has been going (both for airlines and private jets). This wave is still 18 months away, but if you have patience, I believe shareholders will be amply rewarded as this part of ATRO's business goes from being a money-suck to a big profit generator. Stay tuned."
Now I'm really starting to think that this bag is immovable. Or it moves only downwards. It's been here for so long I've even forgotten how it feels when it costs above 10$. What a pointless hopeless lifeless douchebag I will wait of course but I expected it to be a bit more lively
holy cow!!! what's behind this big drop?
"Perfect time for a 23.5 per share offer. At a 50% premium, the BOD might have to say, yes. It would be positive for everyone."
Bought @ 41.35 this AM. Hope we see a recovery. Buyback is encouraging as is strong institutional ownership.

The contract announcement with Stadler timed to help soften the blow of the lack-of-earnings report due on Friday. I expect new lows. (I'm generally correct but this stock makes it easy.)

"100 new aircraft here, anther 100 there , etc. Pretty soon it adds up to a lot of new business for suppliers like TGI, ATRO, HXL ,SPR,etc."
"Wake me up for second half 2020. Q4 '19 and Q1-2 '20 will have Aerosat consolidation losses/charges, effects from 737 Max grounding, and no LuxStream antenna revenue. By Q3 2020 737 Max will be back, LuxStream should be ramping, Bell 525 should be ramping (ATRO has nice shipset on each of these), Aerosat consolidation will be complete, perhaps a few more Test System mass transit contracts will be won, etc. Until then, best to just tuck this in a drawer and not focus on it."
come on ! up..up

"If ATRO stays below 20, it will be a good acquisition target for a larger Aero player."
What institution is buying? Two days of big volume. Very impressive. Perhaps another company is interested?
I think we are going at least ten percent lower. No news is bad news.
Hitting a yearly low-- and that's just the beginning. Let's hope for a change in management or a buyout or something. Anything.

Today ATRO news is huge. AeroSat antenna certification worldwide will have a lasting impact for years to come.I expect 200 M extra revenue starting next year. Kudos to management team.
"Earnings announcement coming soon. Or will it be ""lack of earnings?"" I'm hoping for the former but guessing the latter."
ATRO is now back to the 20's as I feared and spoke of. This is a fairly predictable stock and for the last few years you can bet on disappointment.

"Sold almost all of his stock a couple of days after he said thisMr. Gundermann concluded, “We believe we are on track for a strong second half to 2018. The mid-points of our predicted revenue range for the year suggest 26% consolidated sales growth over our 2017 total. Aerospace would see growth of 24%, while Test would see growth of 39%.

The progress should be impressive in the last two quarters of the year.”GUNDERMANN PETER J Officer 08/03/2018 Automatic Sell direct 47,322 45.0000 7,421Wonder why it took so long to drop."

Won't be long until ATRO becomes a m&a target. Share price too low considering product line and client base
