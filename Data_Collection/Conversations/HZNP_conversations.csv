"I've been with HZNP for quite a while, although admittedly with a lot of churn. It has been a winner for me, although I could have done better. Going into earnings, it's always the same thing. Do I go with a modestly strong position, or really load up. It seems that the stock doesn't really run away from people on good reports, does it? I mean, they gap a little bit, but eventually give most of it up before moving on. Everything seems to be going well, but you never know about the bottom line."
Hit a new ALL TIME HIGH TODAY! we should see $120 this year despite a bear market…long and strong
Waiting for Dalton to post...he is my buy signal.
Take a gander at 10 year chart.Up over 1400%.Got in around 2.70....sold at several points along the rise.All out at $80.00....Stay the course!
"What, no one is providing updates on upgrades or ""price targets at the end of the year""?"
"While exploring the company website I saw a press release that went out June 30. It was the announcement of Horizon Therapeutics hosting a virtual R&D day on September 29. That was 3 months before the event, so it sounds like it will be a well planned and useful presentation. It's live at 8AM CT, so it won't be convenient for those who work for a living, but I'm a slacker (retired) and I will be tuned in. Like all their presentations you can catch a replay I'm sure. Things are falling into line nicely for the company since we got over the temporary supply issue with Tepezza, so this should be a very upbeat discussion and attract a lot of analysts. It could well deliver a boost to the stock price. We are about $5 off the all time high so today seems like a good buy point. I just took advantage to boost my holdings 20%."
Pushing the all time high and such a quiet board! Though it may be that I muted so many posters.
"Horizon has posted a summary of the topics to be covered today at the virtual R&D day. Two new monoclonal antibodies are being added to the pipeline. Daxdilimab (HZN-7734) will be beginning phase 2 studies for, SLE (systemic lupus erythematosus), DLE (discoid lupus), Alopecia, Dermatoyosistis, and Lupus Nephritis. Dazodalibep (HZN-4920) is also beginning phase 2 studies for Sjogren's Syndrome, Rheumatoid Arthritis and Kidney Transplant rejection.Also of great interest to investors, they are headlining ""Robust pipeline and diversified portfolio represent ~$10B in total peak annual sales. We can expect 10 data readouts across development programs through 2023. This is all on the website."
"What will it take to get orphan disease designation for Thyroid Eye Disease in the European Union? Horizon and the EMA seem to be holding their ground on the issue. Horizon wants the orphan designation so they can get orphan drug pricing in Europe. Probably the same reason the EMA is holding out. Does anyone know the prevalence of TED in the EU?According to the EMA website, to qualify for orphan designation a medicine must meet the following criteria:(1) It must be intended for the treatment, prevention or diagnosis of a disease that is life-threatening or chronically debilitating(2) The prevalence of the condition in the EU must not be more than 5 in 10,000 or it must be unlikely that marketing of the medicine would generate sufficient returns to justify the investment needed for its development(3) No satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition concerned can be authorized, or, if such a method exists, the medicine must be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition."
"Great article in the week-end edition of Barrons on Horizon Pharm. Titled Medicine’s Golden Age Is Dawning. 10 Ways to Invest. Below… By Analyst - Chris Schott Pick's of J.P. MorganSchott: Horizon is a mid-cap that could become a large-cap. It had one of the industry’s best-ever rare-disease launches last year with Tepezza, for treatment of a thyroid eye disease. It works in 80% to 90% of patients. It could generate revenue at a $2 billion annual run rate by year end, 18 months after its launch, and is on its way to being a $4 billion drug. Horizon is using that cash flow to broaden its pipeline. It now has four assets in Phase 2 or Phase 3 development. The stock is trading for about 19 times 2022 earnings."
"I know, I know, it's up huge this year. But it frustrates me so when this stock surges and then leaks back!"
"Now this is performance. In the teeth of a down market, UP $1!!!"
A $1.50 turn around in minutes!
Such a pretty chart to look at. The trend is up and with earnings we should easily tend to $130+ by the end of the year and this could happen quickly around earnings. Good Luck to all!

"Positive News out this morning on UPLIZNA..DUBLIN, September 23, 2021--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Horizon Therapeutics plc (Nasdaq: HZNP) today announced results of a retrospective analysis of the pivotal Phase 2/3 N-MOmentum clinical trial, indicating UPLIZNA may provide durable efficacy and a favorable safety profile for African Americans with NMOSD. These data were presented during the 15th World Congress on Controversies in Neurology (CONy Virtual), Sept. 23-26, 2021.

"Everyone who complains, please sell or short, so i will buy more"
"Best stock in my portfolio! I stumbled onto this HZNP while doing research in early 2020, just as the Covid market collapse began to take shape. I was seeing a lot of stocks that were greatly undervalued, but hesitated on many because I just didn't know how they would recover, or how long it would take. On the Monday after St Patrick's day in March 2020, when the market would hit bottom, I purchased 2000 shares of HZNP for $26.99/share. I had used a large portion of our retirement savings to do so, and within a few months HZNP was tipping the scales in that $50 area. I didn't want to look a gift horse in the mouth, so I culled 1000 shares at $48/share. This replenished the majority of what was originally invested, and I still had a 1000 shares to sit on! I do not regret selling those 1000 shares, it was the smart thing to do at the time. However, if there is one thing I do regret, it was not buying more shares at $26.99. I could have swung an additional 2000 shares, but I diversified that money in other directions. The reason for my rant, is that in all that diversification, I have seen horrific investments, and poorly managed companies. That being said, HZNP has been an outstanding company to own stock in, and I plan on holding these 1000 shares for another 5+ years! Thank you HZNP for being a great company, and an outstanding investment!"
Guggenheim raises target price to $144 from $120
Highly recommend watching the webcast of Tim Walbert at the MS Global Healthcare Conference on Sept 10th. This should be standard DD for any serious HZNP investor. The part of the discussion on chronic TEPEZZA patients is very bullish IMO. TW states the worldwide $3.5B peak sales estimate for TEPEZZA is mostly acute TED patients. The Phase 4 TEPEZZA trial for chronic patients is all about reimbursement since the Phase 3 trial didn’t have much chronic TED data. There are 20K acute TED patients and 70K chronic TED patients in the US. Just do the math. Have a nice weekend.

"And yet, down $5 after hours."
"More news today on UPLIZNA, about a week ago there was some positive news on it, and today some more. These data were presented during the 15th World Congress on Controversies in Neurology (CONy Virtual), Sept. 23-26, 2021. UPLIZNA is the first and only FDA-approved anti-CD19 B-cell depleting humanized monoclonal antibody for the treatment of adult patients with anti-aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibody positive NMOSD."

"HZNP always holds up surprisingly well in a sea of red, good thing it's by far my biggest position."
"I'm expecting Q3 Tepezza numbers to be big. During the 1st Qtr earnings call, Tim Walbert stated the following regarding Q3 Tepezza Patient Enrollment Forms (PEFs):""We have already seen a good number of new patients, whose PEFs were generated in the fourth and first quarter of this year, scheduled their first infusion. While the accumulation of disrupted patients resuming treatment, along with the new PEFs generated in the fourth and first quarters, we have a unique dynamic occurring as we relaunch TEPEZZA. This will result in an unusual quarterly net sales progression, with the third quarter expected to be TEPEZZA’s highest net sales quarter of this year as we work through treating disrupted patients and adding the new accumulated patients."" - Tim Walbert, Horizon Therapeutics CEO"
"Just a reminder. Tomorrow morning (Wednesday) 8:00 Central, Horizon is hosting a virtual R&D day. I expect it to be upbeat and informative. It should be worth viewing."
"The R&D day presentation has concluded. It was enjoyable, uplifting and informative. I would recommend anyone interested in the company, certainly anyone invested in the company to watch a replay which should be available later today and probably for a few months. Sometimes bio-tech company presentations are difficult to follow, particularly for those who don't have a science background. That is not the case here. This presentation was for investors, and spoke to investors, not scientists. The speakers were all very good, and articulated their discussions very well. They spoke slowly and clearly and kept scientific terminology to a minimum. Make no mistake though, these speakers were all highly trained and experienced in the field. It was a long presentation, over 3 hours. I didn't listen to all of it in detail as my ability to concentrate for a long period is not what it once was. I plan to listen to it all again in shorter segments over the next couple of weeks. I heard enough to know that I am justified in continuing HZNP as my largest investment."
"I'll ""enjoy,"" watching from the sidelines, shack.If I recall correctly, you were in very early, like me.For the young 'un's here...we woke up to some SERIOUS ""gut punches,"" back in the, ""sketchy, TW days.""Rooting for all you LONGS."
"It amazes me how few shares change hands.. This company has legs, has a proven track record and makes a ton of cash.. More acquisitions to come and higher highs we go"
Breaking out on decent volume. Next stop $120.
HZNP reached an all time high at 119.08
Not even going to comment!!
"We closed just 4 cents below the days high, and the 52 week high. Volume was more than double the 90 day average. It looks like everyone wants to be on board for earnings announcement."
"Again, this stock is bipolar"
why is this stock stuck
"News - Flash note from Stifel on HZNP from my broker, looks like it missed the wires.Of no surprise, HZNP released positive data from the placebo-controlled MIRROR study (Krystexxa+methotrexate), confirming what was already understood to be utility of concomitant administration of immunomodulation to improve the response rates of Krystexxa treatment. KTX+MTX resulted in a 71% response rate at Month-6 compared to 40% for PBO—consistent with prior open-label reports that showed a near doubling of response. With this data, HZNP expects to file an sNDA in 1Q22 for its inclusion in the label and finally establish concomitant treatment with immunomodulation as standard-of-care. Currently, only ~40% of patients are treated with immunomodulation, resulting in shortened treatment. We expect that with this label expansion, physicians will adopt the treatment more readily, with expansion coming primarily from the ability to treat to goal (6 months or beyond). We view this as one of the key drivers of Krystexxa growth and its ability to reach >$1bn.Many investors don’t know that the NDA phase is the last step before approval, this is great news. Based on the Data they have supplied, my opinion is it will be approved. HZNP had great data when Tepezza was approved, the comments it was slam dunk. HZNP so far has had a very good track record on approvals. This should low insurance cost and make HZNP’s Krystexxa+methotrexate the treatment of choice. Sell at your own risk!!"
Above average volume yesterday! That doesn't happen often... Next leg up
