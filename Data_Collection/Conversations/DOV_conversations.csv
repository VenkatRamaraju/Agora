DOV is down -4.90% to 92.90
Anyone think Dover would want to bid on CNHI their on road segment? They are selling off that part of their company and said it would be done by year end and that there are several bidders....? Seems a fit maybe.
there must have been plenty of people who bought for $94 before earnings and then sold for $87 next morning....only to watch it climb all day to $97. The market gave longs an opportunity to get out at decent levels after the company warned. Guiding for $4.80 when the analysts are expecting $5.86 isn't a good thing. trading at 20x this years earnings now. good luck. stock should head for $83 minimum...and thats if the economy does not head off a cliff as i suspect might be the case.

Julius1 hour agoYou don't understand how this work. It was a sucker bet to sell at all. The company BEAT their numbers and increased them. The spin-off a part of the company so you own $94.00 and you get 0n a 100 shares 50 new shares of the new company for FREE. You had to own it on April 30th to get the tax free stock. So far is trading around $30.00 dollars. You guys must join in the conference call so you know what is happening. DOV will be back over $100.00 dollars soon and you have free shares of the other company target $45.00.
Fantastic quarter and great guide forward for the year! I feel that this stock is heading quite a bit higher!

Dover and CNHI seem well positioned for a take out this year. Perhaps in the EV mania.
