there must have been plenty of people who bought for $94 before earnings and then sold for $87 next morning....only to watch it climb all day to $97. The market gave longs an opportunity to get out at decent levels after the company warned. Guiding for $4.80 when the analysts are expecting $5.86 isn't a good thing. trading at 20x this years earnings now. good luck. stock should head for $83 minimum...and thats if the economy does not head off a cliff as i suspect might be the case.

On an adjusted basis, net earnings of $288 million increased 24% and adjusted diluted EPS of $1.98 was also up 24% versus the comparable quarter of the prior year.For the nine months ended September 30, 2021, Dover generated revenue of $5.9 billion, an increase of 21% (+17% organic) compared to the first nine months of the prior year. GAAP net earnings of $761 million increased 52%, and GAAP diluted EPS of $5.24 was also up 52% year-over-year. On an adjusted basis, net earnings of $850 million increased 42%, and adjusted diluted EPS of $5.86 was also up 42% versus the comparable period of the prior year.A full reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted measures and definitions of non-GAAP and other performance measures are included as an exhibit herein.MANAGEMENT COMMENTARY:Dover's President and Chief Executive Officer, Richard J. Tobin, said, ""Our results in the third quarter reflect continued robust demand and solid execution by our teams in an increasingly complex supply chain and labor environment.""During the quarter we demonstrated the strength of our portfolio with revenue and new order growth across all five of our operating segments. We improved margins year-over-year despite well-advertised supply chain, logistics, and labor availability challenges that adversely impacted shipment timing and margin performance in several businesses, most notably in our Refrigeration and Food Equipment and Engineered Products segments. Overall, our diversified end market exposures, ongoing productivity initiatives and time-tested localized manufacturing and sourcing strategy provide us an advantage as we execute against record backlogs and deliver critical products to our customers. ""As we enter the final quarter of the year, we do not anticipate the challenges from the third quarter to abate and therefore we remain focused on operational execution to deliver against robust demand in this strained operational environment. More positively, our high backlog levels provide beneficial near-term visibility for the remainder of the year and into 2022. As a result, we are raising our full year EPS guidance."""

Julius1 hour agoYou don't understand how this work. It was a sucker bet to sell at all. The company BEAT their numbers and increased them. The spin-off a part of the company so you own $94.00 and you get 0n a 100 shares 50 new shares of the new company for FREE. You had to own it on April 30th to get the tax free stock. So far is trading around $30.00 dollars. You guys must join in the conference call so you know what is happening. DOV will be back over $100.00 dollars soon and you have free shares of the other company target $45.00.
