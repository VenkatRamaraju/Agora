"$GOGO is primed for a gamma squeeze going into 3/19. Open interest shows 21 calls per put expiring on that date. For each strike price between $13 and $20, on average, 14K options go ITM, representing 1.4M of underlying or 3.43% of float or 43% of daily avg volume. So for each dollar increase in price, 43% of daily volume goes ITM (!) causing a ton of excess on the buy side. Catalyst could be earnings this week, which are expected to outperform given that flights are on the rise."
who's buying this morning
Delta continues to take delivery of new aircraft installed with Gogo and increases passenger capacity while United and American extend cancellations of the Max and Viasat. https://www.investors.com/news/delta-earnings-q2-2019-delta-stock/
What happens now if you own stock do you hold until sale or sell before Just asking? Thx for input
"Here is the link the ""Milestone"" PRhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/gogo-avance-l5-achieves-milestone-120000593.html"
I am cautiously optimistic after this last conference call. GOGO has beat every quarter for the last year. They are on track to break even by 2021 and will probably get there sooner at this pace. The estimated break even does not assume a contract with Delta - if they land it that will certainly accelerate the break even date. Very few competitors in the space and I don’t buy that most airlines will want the headaches and cost of building out and maintaining their own IFC.
Been long for 2 years never was once worried about gogo.
"The management needs to refinance its long term debt!""The 2024 Senior Secured Notes will mature on May 1, 2024. The 2024 Senior Secured Notes bear interest at a rate of 9.875% per year, payable semiannually in arrears on May 1 and November 1 of each year, beginning on November 1, 2019.""Seriously, how come this company is paying 9.8% in interest when you can get them much cheaper? Fed rate is not going anywhere so they should be able to get them at 5%-6% rate which will reduce its interest expense by $40M per year!"
Let's see if we get any news about a sale today. Fingers crossed
CEO out
Surprised about the dump today after being up for the first 45min. Seems like a weird reaction truth be told as the conference call was completed and news seemed pretty good all around. The market is a fickle beast and maybe some were expecting an outright sale during the conference call. Who knows really? I will be looking for a position in the coming day if not today.
"Finally some good news about Gogo's desire to really advance airborne connectivity & vastly increase sales. Let's hope the future earnings calls are ""out of the park"" events."
Awfully quiet here
"I'm Back!!!!! I didn't want to come back, but I got word the New York Hot Dog Stand Acquisition fell through.SO ----now the stock will go under $10 a share by May 6th. Sorry guys."
Volume is way up and value is returning ... not sure why but the new altitude and possible buyer for Gogo could make this launch back to north of 6.25 ...

3 more days ... let's try and pass $12 ... happy holidays everyone 
Just got off a flight from Chicago to Phoenix Gogo did not work
"Really looking forward to seeing the extent of the cash crunch GOGO is under when the next Q results are released. Expect them to burn about $120 million which will put their cash on hand very close to their current liabilities. Once this is posted, it will be clear that they need to raise more capital, pronto. And that's gonna be a BIG problem. So get ready for the big hurt, longs. It's only a couple weeks away."
"I received an email from Alaska/Virgin Airlines today stating how the new merger was going to bring LOTS of improvements to the airline. One stated ""• High-speed satellite Wi-Fi on all of our Boeing and Airbus aircraft, starting with the first airplane in March.""I called Alaska corporate offices & spoke with a person directly involved with the upgrading of their in-flight Internet and they are indeed using Gogo for the high-speed connection starting in March. CoolLoad up now as it's a deal."
I am always amazed at how quiet this board is. This stock has done me so well and no one seems to talk about it
Change in Net Cash to $126M (from $-9.5M in June 2017) and increasing revenue to approx $650M 2017 year end and approx $800M in 2018 ... indicates GOGO should increase to $20 end of 2018. It also helps that it's up 4% today
seriously who would buy this PO S?
Wow you people need to do your homework not every airline has the same systems for WiFi such as Southwest so if it doesn’t work it could also be the airline not GoGo
"Gents , this one is a real winner. However, if you got some extra cash, swing $GOGO as well. I am expecting a nice bounce in that too."
You’re math may be right but if there isn’t an interest to buy the stock we aren’t going anywhere
Flew with Gogo recently worked flawlessly
"High short interest, no chatter on WSB because of the $1B rule. When mkt cap breaks $1B there’s a non-zero chance for a squeeze here"
"Look fellas, you really need to sell now. Mindless cheerleaders like joe are bad, but half wit, arrogant, google educated schmoes like Els are much worse. If I had a more efficient medium to communicate, I could explain better. How the China treasury bond situation affects highly leveraged junk financed companies like GOGO, how GOGO’s transponder leasing business plan has failed time and time again (see Gilat), how GOGO’s tech is at least two generations behind the competition. I could explain so much. Els is preaching long term while GOGO is heading short term or at best medium term into bankruptcy. You are going to lose everything if you hang on to this dog. Els is right on one thing. I am long Viasat as well as short GOGO. Look at the performance of GOGO vs VSAT and do the math. Nothing suceeds like success and nothing fails more than failure. The best predictor of future behavior is past behavior."
Anyone with a realistic price target by mid March?
"Anyone thinking about Gogo as a M&A target for VZ or any ISPs? I used Gogo internet while I was flying overseas - had no issue watching youtube videos/music. Given the fact that Gogo provides the internet service while flying, I think this is a long term play for those who believe in their 5G network."
GOGO Extremely Bullish Unusual Options Activity on Call options up to $20 stock price. This is going to $25+ fast folks.
0.047 ratio of puts to calls for options expiring 3/19. So for every 1 put that’s 21 calls. Strongly bullish on this one
I bought at 5.15 no complaints here
Thank you Mr. Market.Shorts are betting that the company will burn thru all their cash prior to turning cash flow positive.Revenues were better but earnings were a little below expectations. The only thing that confused me was the CA-ROW revenue flat with last quarter even though number of aircraft was higher than last quarter. (I assume some airline agreement that they get first revenue to offset their investment).Stock was down nearly 15% but no cash burn in the quarter. I believe the path is set for them to achieve positive cash flow WITHOUT additional capital raise. Shorts will cover... Initiated a position on selloff. Will add additional position in next few days.
I thought there would be much more of a short squeeze on this stock considering 80% is short. hmmm. surprised.

"short squeeze buy now ! 80% of the float is short,....ratio is 19 days to cover, this will explode way past 10.....you will see.this is a huge opportunity....don't miss it"
This is my personal crying game !
Any reason why 4%+ drop today? They have hired a VP ... anyone care to chime in?
Is there an earnings leak?
"I used GoGo on a flight to Beijing last month. It worked very well...none of my emails got hung up in my outbox. In fact, I found they went through quickly and efficiently."
"something is not right - Intersat who filed bankruptcy (chapter 11) on this May with a heavy debt of $15B is paying $400M to buy a commercial asset from GOGO? I know that Intersat is getting $5B from C-Band auction but filing a bankruptcy triggers a default even for the debt which accelerate the payments.my guess is that Intersat was forced to buy it to avoid a penalty or Appaloosa (Tepper) pushed the board at Intersat to acquire it.the problem is, was $400M cash a good deal for GOGO? GOGO also carries $1+ Bn in long term debts."
Go go seems to go nowhere ! Lol

This is usually the time when Shorty pops up with a condescending quip and a LOL. Maybe the Saudi's got him
"up 6 %, what news??"
lets get WSB to push this stock
Can anyone explain the recent surge in GoGo's stock price? Or is this all based on momentum?
What is going on with this stock? How did it run up after the first day and how is it staying up here with this kind of volume? I tried to figure it out but just can't make sense of it - someone mentioned convertible notes and price having to stay above 7 for 3 weeks or something. Can someone please give a legit explanation? Thanks.
"More 2Ku systems coming online outside of North America.Cathay Pacific is retrofitting Gogo’s 2Ku connectivity solution to its Airbus A330s and Boeing 777s, while its Airbus A350s are delivered with Panasonic’s eXConnect Ku-band system.“A lot of our customers are quite happy more with one platform…” says Cathay general manager customer experience & design Vivian Lo.Safe to say Cathay’s customers prefer 2Ku. Anyone that has flown with Panasonic would concur. With ongoing speculation of industry consolidation and continued performance challenges, it begs the question if Panasonic accelerates an attempt to acquire a piece of Gogo’s commercial aviation business.https://runwaygirlnetwork.com/2019/07/23/cathay-passengers-have-ifc-bias-rfp-issued-for-consistent-portal/"

bought some more at 9.13
why down so for suddenly
CA division sold for $400mil!!!! Boom!!!
"Why this board so quiet? Majority of us are all heart broken, but maybe there is some light on the end of tunnel. Short squeeze is coming."
Company is backing up what they say.profitable by 2020 ceo puts his money where his mouth is. Great investment here!
"Well, that escalated quickly! For some reason, I was actually starting to believe ""7"" and was waiting for it to go below 9 to buy more. Should have bought more at $9.20. My guess is this will be over $20 at some point in the next year."
"Looks like last Q was very bad for GOGO. De-installs hit a record pace for GOGO equipment as detailed in slide 9 of Viasat's earnings presentation, the exact opposite of Viasat. You see the price reaction to Viasat's earnings release yesterday. Expect the exact opposite price reaction when GOGO announces.http://investors.viasat.com/static-files/9d3d12d2-62ab-4af5-9e6e-d2119ede4f89"
Sale of CA division will be very very soon IMO. No one hires investment bankers for fun (especially considering that they are watching every penny during this pandemic). They were likely very close to a deal before they got involved. Question is what will the price be? Maybe $6-7 range to purchase CA division.

Stay Long gentleman. Don't give up the shares at $11.
I was flying Delta the last few days. Lots of talk that it is about to announce free wifi on flights.
So how do you price something like this? They get $400 Mill? Market Cap should in theory go up by 400 Mill? But how much is their Business Offering worth in terms of Market Cap? Surely its worth more than 200Mill?
"Looking very bullish this fine Friday. An out of the ordinary pattern might be the indication of out of the ordinary events . Anyway, GOGO tends to rise before and after earnings"
Everyone that travels on a plane will use the service sooner or later.. Yet you never hear it mention.. Is it not a money maker? Is it just a convenience?If it's not capable of making millions for investors it will just wallow in a Mire.
Ebb how’s your day today?
strong momentum here
Gogo is up 7.42% to 12.89
The GOGO chart looks like it is positioned to take off again. I hope for sooner rather than later.
GOGO's market share is plummeting. Check out slide 13 of Viasat's presentation today. Yep really looking forward to GOGO's earnings release. This is just so much fun!http://investors.viasat.com/static-files/3176aa69-257d-4abc-b12c-01267a3ba7c1
"Should be a decent E/R , PR coming out, plus 4 conference schedule after. Nobody does that unless decent news, if there is a miss, then we will see the standard 10% dip, as always, but will regain 25 over following 2 weeks"

"If there are 17.78 million shares short and the float is 33.25 million, what % short is the float? YF is saying 33%. Maybe my math skills are off, but 17 is basically half of 33 (or 50%)"
BUy the dip!
Lets hear it for a new ALL TIME LOW for the GOGO stock price. GOGO is by far the best performing asset in my portfolio. Merry Christmas to all!
This stock is a bargain at these levels. The buyout will be in the $5-$6 range

Here's why GOGO will never make money. I'm a business traveler and I probably flight 15 weeks out of the year. It's ridiculous the amount of money hey want to charge per flight leg for 30 mins. of time or for the leg of the flight. If you going overseas the cost for the flight duration is $24.99. Too much for the average flyer. What I propose will be a set fee of $5.00 per flight leg. If you are a Member you can access for a set fee. If they make it affordable (volume ) they will make tons of cash and the stock will go back up to prosperity.
beats on both eps and revenue
$12.. then $15?
"GOGO is a good buy at these levels .... brokerages set a price target @ $11.78. CEO bought (100K shares @ $8.79) & (50K shares @ $8.94).

Investor meeting tomorrow will push this over 11. To many good things in the pipeline to hold this down.
58% of the shares short. This thing could explode upward at any time.
this could be a huge short squeeze if good news comes out
"The problem with GOGO, is that there are so many problems with GOGO. I could detail a different fatal flaw in GOGO's business model every day for a month. But with GOGO and it's competitors all recently releasing quarterly results one striking problem stood out; GOGO's total lack of both vertical AND horizontal integration.All of GOGO's competitors supply diverse market segments; consumer fixed connectivity, government solutions, maritime, etc. GOGO only serves one market segment. These competitors with multiple segment revenue streams have poured in. They are better funded, have lower cost structures, and are far more experienced in satcom marketing.I'm taking bets on the over / under for when Small's stock buy dips into the red. I'd be surprised if it were not before year end. He is not the sharpest tool in the shed."
Google buying Nokia's airborne wifi division
Seems like they might have sold the commercial division? Up 18% today. News coming? I've been holding these bags for years waiting for this.
"Many stocks go sideways now , so what ."
"How can a share price be so high, however, if Intelsat offers a share price of $ 4.7."
The big question now is who Delta is going to start converting planes over from GOGO. That announcement is coming very soon.
"“Gogo has been proven unequivocally wrong in its challenge. We continue to believe they will have great difficulty commercializing their future 5G network without infringing on SmartSky’s expansive intellectual property portfolio,” said SmartSky Chairman and CEO Haynes Griffin. “Gogo has said many times in the past that our IP didn’t matter and wasn’t valid."
"From someone in the business, I don’t see GoGo having a future. They are too far behind the curve in technology and can’t borrow enough to innovate their way out. The airlines and business aviation have been transitioning to much more capable satellite communications systems for the last 3-5 years."
I flew Delta in June and July and I was consistently getting 35-45mbps connectivity on Delta 737-800 flights with the 2KU technology when I checked with speed test online. I tried streaming for extended periods with no buffering or stoppages. I had purchased full day passes from GOGO prior to the flights.
this stock is heading up till $6.25

"Google interest ups chances of in-flight Wi-Fi acquisition, says William Blair ""We have seen this movie before"" is what William Blair analyst Louie DiPalma says after Bloomberg reported yesterday that Google (GOOG, GOOGL) is in advanced talks to acquire Nokia's in-flight connectivity hardware business. Google joins a long list of technology, telecom, and media providers that have exhibited a strategic interest in in-flight Wi-Fi, ""although all have thus far stayed on the perimeter,"" DiPalma tells investors in a research note. The analyst notes that incumbents Gogo (GOGO), Panasonic (PCRFY), ViaSat (VSAT), Global Eagle Entertainment (ENT), and Inmarsat (IMASY) have invested billions toward satellite capacity and infrastructure. The industry is all about scale and potential new entrants would not have any, DiPalma contends. He believes it would take any new entrant many years to build a network from scratch, obtain regulatory approvals, and procure line-fit partnerships. The analyst thinks Google's interest in in-flight connectivity increases the probability that a tech or telecom company would buy an incumbent in the space. DiPalma has Outperform ratings on ViaSat and Gogo and a Market Perform rating on Global Eagle."

Wouldn’t be shocked if there was a private equity buy out here on Monday morning. They haven’t refinanced and paid down the debt so they have a huge chunk of cash sitting there with a very profitable high margin business that remains
"Yo yall reailze that this debt refi is coming by EOM, right? And if by some case they choose not to refi, it will drive the sale price of the company up. Either way, its a huge win for shareholders.

"EBB, you may not be aware of this but prior to release to the field the de--icing fix was first extensively tested in a lab environment as part of an accelerated testing campaign (referred to as HASS/HALT), which simulates 100s of operational cycles. This type of test is standard practice in the aerospace industry, and an essential precursor to field release as a Service Bulletin to airline Customers. We must recognize the fix is a success and kudos to Gogo getting it right for current and future Customers. Things are looking up."
They didn’t teach us this in MBA school. Can someone please explain how to price the company now ? How much is their business aviation worth? What’s their growth? What happens to the massive debt? Does the company just hold on to the 400 mill or give out a special divi?

Earnings beat and projected revenue and EBITDA look great for 2021. They are projecting at least 10% CAGR for the next 5 years with cash flow increasing at an even faster rate once the 5G rollout is completed. Interesting note that they announced they are in a great position to do a comprehensive refinancing package as well to significantly lower the debt burden and interest expense. Given the current debt market’s appetite for debt issuance one has to wonder if maybe they were holding off due to ongoing negotiations to be taken private. Either way good things ahead and this has been significantly derailed and should head toward $20 by year end.

"69% of the float short, could see a squeeze here up 14%"
"The Onion lampoons GOGO. Yep, GOGO has really turned its reputation around. Customers are ""raving"" LOLhttps://www.theonion.com/try-it-now-shouts-gogo-internet-technician-standing-1829681948"
"""Delta experimented with free Wi-Fi on a few flights in May to test how much passenger usage increases when offered at no cost and to see how the Gogo satellite-based service performs under heavy use. The tests didn’t include video streaming. Delta won’t discuss results of the free trials.""""American, which has upgraded its fleet to mostly Viasat service, says it has seen “take rates” for major live events like the World Cup and Super Bowl as high as 60%, and the satellite service handled it. “We’ve had aircraft with 80 to 120 people streaming and it works flawlessly,” Erwan Perhirin, American’s managing director of customer experience and onboard products""https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-race-to-make-airplane-wi-fi-less-terrible-11563355804"
"Have you ever felt like you were the last one to know about really bad news? Els, roman, larry, tommy? The last month has been brutal for GOGO, down 19% while the market rose nearly 6%. Just think, if you had listened to me and sold, you would have 19% more money, more if you invested wisely elsewhere. What do you think is going on?My case for the demise of GOGO has been thoroughly sound and based on facts. The arguments against my bear thesis has been increasingly incoherent, personal attacks. GOGO’s earnings release will make it clear they need to raise more capital. GOGO’s ability to raise more capital is near impossible. When those two facts meet, the outcome is bankruptcy."
"Alright it’s looking dead on this board so I’ll give my 0.02...The recent sale of the cash sucking & competitive commercial side of the business was much needed and debt can come down a decent amount now.The remaining private aviation business is a near monopoly, and has customers that are quite insensitive to price increases. Not to mention private flights will soar post-pandemic, and we are in an era where connectivity is essential.Operating income of $22M in Q3, at a time when nobody was flying, is insanely good. That’s $90M operating income annualized in the middle of a pandemic when almost nobody is flying.Let’s conservatively call it $200M (Ann.) of operating income once the pandemic is over and $80M (Ann.) of interest expense... maybe $40M capex... that’s $80M cash flow for a <$1B company, a 12 multiple.Trading at 12x cash flow in a growing industry is one of the cheapest prices for a growth company you can find... And I’m not the only one that’s noticed. There’s a PE firm gobbling up as many shares as they can over the past month. Could be looking at a takeover. My price target for the next 12 months either organically or in a takeover situation is conservatively around $16/sh. Good shot at 40% gain in 12 months from today’s $11/sh in my opinion. Not sure you’re getting that kind of return in many other names from the high-priced starting point of today’s market prices.Just my opinion, good luck to all."

This is the best investment on the market imo it’s can only go up
