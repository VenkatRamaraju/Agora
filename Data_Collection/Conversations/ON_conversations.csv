"Needham Analysis about GTAT Acquisition:On August 25, ON agreed to acquire GT Advanced Technologies (GTAT) for $415 million. The company plans to finance the acquisition with its revolving credit and cash balances, which may burden its already heavily leveraged balance sheet. Possible Rationale and Outcomes of the AcquisitionNonetheless, the acquisition may have more pros than cons. Notably, GTAT is a silicon carbide (SiC) and sapphire materials supplier, which will help ON rapidly meet the rising demand for SiC products in areas like power applications, especially in the Automotive and Industrial end markets. The company expects to help GTAT scale its operations by providing its manufacturing expertise, resulting in faster development of SiC materials.The acquisition is expected to have no material impact on ON’s top-line and is likely to be slightly dilutive to the earnings per share (EPS) in the first year after the transaction closes. Nonetheless, GTAT will be accretive to the EPS from the second year onwards.￼Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill seems to be excited with this decision. His bullish sentiment reflected on his reinforcement of a Buy rating on the stock with a price target of $60. “We view these developments as positive for Automotive and Industrial segment top-line growth,” he explained.Gill observed that with this acquisition, ON aspires to reduce the time-to-market (TTM) and increase the supply of materials available to customers. He believes that the acquisition will boost the company’s margins over the years.Traction inverters are most in need of SiC materials. Notably, up to 20% of traction inverters are expected to be made from SiC materials by 2025.Gill noted, “Overall, SiC is expected to be a $1B market by 2025, with high demand for its energy density, faster switching, and higher breakdown voltage characteristics.”The Wall Street also seems optimistic on the stock and has a Strong Buy consensus based on 17 Buys, 2 Holds, and 1 Sell. The average ON price target of $54.05 implies 22.8% upside potential from current levels.￼￼"

Results are in line with expectations, Revenue is adjusting to Trump universe, what else did you expect ?Company is doing better than their peers, outlook is pretty good and strong job report says there is no imminent recession. Plenty of time for the company to adjust and stay profitable."
Good morning for ON!No news but excellent news from Avago and speculative good news on Trade Deal.
The fact that nobody is mentioned they are the main supplier of Tesla.
This is the worst stock I own. I’m down 30% but I hate to realize a loss.. don’t need the money so I’m holding but is there legit reason for it to return to higher prices or was it overpriced?
"From Power E*Trade TODAY: Target $22:80 to $23.10A bullish continuation Diamond was confirmed 8/7 at 10:30. This pattern tells us that the price has broken upward out of a consolidation period, suggesting a continuation of the prior uptrend. The pattern formed over 105 hours and 0 minutes, which is a rough guide for how long it might take to reach the target price of 22.8 - 23.1."

AVGO said to be looking at smaller buyout targets than QCOM. ON may be a good fit.
Shaking my head...ON has less then 10 percent exposure on sales to China...yet the scam market operators have taken it down from 23 to 18...eroding market cap as if the company is going to collapse if the trade deal is not reached....crooks stroll on scam street...

"This results in an intrinsic value of $29.2. Compared to the current share price of $18.43, the stock is quite good value at a 36.9% discount to what it is available for right now."
This stock is going to skyrocket. Every major car maker will need ON to be successful. Big week and big mo this ahead for ON.
no way ON is going back to valuations of 6 quarters past . this is a 24 dollar stock
"This will end up red I am afraid, the big money boys are still gaming the tech sector. Too much of a dichotomy between companies that should be reacting in the same fashion. We have AMAT down today even though earnings next week and Lam blew the numbers off the hook. We have AMD and MU down and we have NVDA blowing up today even though they had poor numbers and weak guidance. There is still no logic or flow to anything in the tech sector. So my guess is that they will end up taking the sector down one more time based on false narratives about chip cycles or trade concerns or even the possibility of a recession. Eventually this and the whole sector will climb and probably net a 50% return by year end, it is just when that take off happens and when does the big money stop gaming the sector."
"Weird to see this down today. I must have seen multiple upgrades and and like 10 PT increases. Morgan Stanley was the only one to go negative reducing the PT to 25 bucks. Go figure. Morgan Stanley says it is so, it is so."

"A well respected Stock Market Guru (who is seldom wrong) has set a target price of $50 after earning report. It was nearly $44 on Monday. We will see if he is right at least with the direction of the momentum. Today stock price was probably manipulated by Hedge Funds who had sold call options $39 and higher. They increased the supply driving down the price and wiped out all of the options that expired on Friday! ON Monday, the upward momentum for ON will go ON again!!! Stock was up 53 cents in after hours trading!"

I don't worry about short term price action. Bought ON a few years back and kept adding. I added this morning in the 22's. I will hold until I see growth slow. Plan to pocket another 50 percent here in another year. The story is good here. Do not over react. Patience will be rewarded.

Sanction and control from US gov on semi is hurting the free market. Many companies and factories are accumulating chips in case they are sanctioned/restricted by US gov. It caused a big shortage in chip !!!
"2/8/18: In the low $21 range today -- great buying opportunity for a stock that turned in $1.46 in earnings over the last 4 quarters. This stock should be up in the $30 range, in my opinion, but we'll have to wait i out."
Read through the presentation. Looked great. Very pro M&A in the semi industry. Talked like they are looking for acquisitions. Thoughts on that JC? You seem to be most knowledgeable about ON. Would ON be a buyout candidate? Not sure who could afford them though? I was thinking they might go after CY. Would that be a good fit? I am new to ON and not as knowledgeable as the rest of you on here.
Upgrades coming soon….
It should be at 27-30 this a healthy company
Why is this stock not at $30 and climbing? ON is doing everthing right
Taking off today. + $ 1 since we saw the one month Head shoulder stock formation yesterday and bought and strong under $21
"Been waiting for this opportunity, so now with everything on SALE I will go shopping. The reality, you can not produce a vehicle with out their chips. Many manufacturers product the vehicle and let them sit until they get the chips."
NEW ATH SOON
"I think AMD's earnings will be a blowout, since companies like $MRVL, $ON, $MU which have significant datacenter exposure reported significant growth in that segment. AMD is objective the leader in datacenter processors for now."
"I decided to take a position in ON based on its low valuation. I was comparing price divided by EBITDA per share (my favorite value metric) for over 20 semi stock and only MU is cheaper than ON. MU is a unique situation being in the memory space. It seems that the average multiple for semi cos with their own fabs is about 10. The multiple for ON is 6.8, about 50% below the average. There are 4 other firms under 10: CRUS (8.4), STM (8.3), INTC (7.2) and DIOD (7.4), but ON is still the lowest. Furthermore, ON's projected earnings growth rate is right in line with the semi industry average for the next 5 years at around 15% per year. I really think ON should be selling closer to $30, but ultimately the market will decide."

Baidu Selects ON Semiconductor Image Sensors for autononous driving program
"management to showcase two items at the analyst day: 1) Breadth of product cycles: ON’s power management products extend beyond autos, and into many new growth markets in data center (cloud servers); 5G (base stations); electric vehicles (Silicon carbide) and advanced driver assist systems, many of which are brand new content gain opportunities; and 2) Potential to target higher 40-45% gross margins vs our/Street’s <39% outlook for the next few years. Higher GM can drive l-t EPS power towards $2.50-$3 in our view, and importantly help expand ON’s forward PE that has been ~11x and well below peers largely due to (mistaken in our view) perception of lower GM/lower value-add products."
"Looks like they did the shock and awe approach to dropping prices for the tech sector one more time, they used the ""poor"" numbers from Xilinx and Intel to dump the sector at the open and now are buying in again to drive it up one more time. The news media will cite improved trade talks which everyone knows is all but a done deal as the catalyst."

I heard about ON the other day on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
"*tap, tap, is the mic on?*This is how things are likely to go down. Wei Chung joined ON Semi as a tag-a-long to El-Khoury. Wei Chung followed Vijay Ulal from Maxim to FSC and the company worked to trim themselves for sale to ONSEMI at the time. Then he got a pay day and moved to Cypress and now back to ONSEMI. See the trend here? He's not an innovator AT ALL. I suspect he's convinced El-Khory he knows the old FCS playbook and what factories they could shut down. Covid and the automotive semi surge has likely has spoiled his plans in the short term so far as it would be suspect to trim in the middle of a record semi shortage. ONSEMI is primarily making parts with internal factories which is counter to how any company he's worked for prior. He likely will try and shutter factories, non-manufacturing offices, and support groups as ""cost cutting"" with opportunity to trim the company for sale. Also should keep an eye on Wei Chung as there has been speculation he's on the take so keep an eye on which factories he tries to steer business towards, especially in Taiwan. He's not an innovator or going to bring ONSEMI the next iPhone product so all he knows is to push more MFG to offshore subcons and eliminate/reduce the internal MFG footprint. If you are an ONSEMI employee, I would avoid any of Wei Chung's staff especially his low level minion Helen. When you meet her, you'll know it. She's so insecure you'll probably know what Uni she went to as she's like a pilot and will tell you where she went to school within the first 30 minutes of meeting her. Best advice is avoid her as she has Wei Chung's ear and will make comments about people and group value even when she has no or superficial knowledge of facts. Buyer beware, there are sharks in the water."
"ON Semiconductor price target raised to $53 at Jefferies after analyst day Jefferies analyst Mark Lipacis raised the firm's price target on ON Semiconductor to $53 from $51 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares after the company revealed its new 2025 operating model at its analyst day meeting yesterday. ON expects to grow revenue at a 7-9% compound annual growth rate, improve its gross margin by 640 basis points to 45%, and improve its operating margin by 830 basis points to 28% between 2021-2025, said Lipacis, who also noted that ON said it will look to exit smaller, inefficient fabs."
On is still undervalued and trading around 3x sales. It will reach around 7 billions revenue next year with next year's PE around 17-18. Its competitors like NXPI and MRVL are trading around 5-6x sales. The new management is trying to improve the company's margin. ON can be double or triple within 6-12 months due to its low value as well as EV tailwinds..
When is ER?
ON Semiconductor reached an all time high at 37.70
"Just sold my position in ON. Double TOP formation has just formed (kiss of death if you are Bullish). Every time I have ignored this chart pattern I've regretted it (Big Time). Also, overall Market is at all time highs. It should turn lower later today or next week. That will take ON down with it further!! Be careful, this is NOT THE TIME to be a Hero!!"
I'm looking forward to this surpassing 50 in the near future!!
"However, the stock sold off ~7% earlier today on concerns related to 1)higher spending - opex going up 10% in Q3E, faster than sales growth; 2) higher capexexpected to stay elevated at 8-9% of sales in 2018/19; 3) stretching lead times in theface of macro deceleration (for instance in consumer white goods in China); and 4)limited FCF generation and buybacks in 1H. We highlight these concerns but believe thestock over-reacted and presents an enhanced Buy opportunity, trading at just 11x our2019E P/E vs double digit EPS growth and low leverage that presents attractive M&Aand/or enhanced share buyback options."
"Okay, just doubled down on my recent purchase of ON at 17.67!! First purchase was in the low 23s. Very good resistance around 17.50. Not sure where the bottom is but they beat their recent earnings and revenues. Yes, the China Trader war will hurt future sales but no one at this point has a clue how long this war will last, or how it will really effect sales. All you can do is pick your spots on where to add more shares."

"Hey guys and gals just wondering your take on this article. If you scroll down it quotes the CEO of ON saying....China is weaker than normal, weaker than seasonal,” said Keith Jackson CEO of ON Semiconductor. What is your take on this....is it a subtle way of saying our numbers are not going to be that good for the reporting quarter... little confused on this... comments? Thanks for your input --Scott ....article web page posted below...https://www.investopedia.com/how-china-s-slowdown-is-biting-into-u-s-corporate-profits-4584871?utm_campaign=quote-yahoo&utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=referral&yptr=yahoo"
It seems ON will follow TER or going down Monday its e/r for sure $34 could be possible !
"this is consistent with other semi following good results - CY, SWKS, etc"
"I would agree with your thoughts concerning ON aligning more with STM than TXN, though with the acquisition of Fairchild, their customer base is much more diversified than STM which was very dependent on auto as was the pre-Fairchild ON. With Fairchild, their customers include OEMs who build systems for utilities, power management systems for all sorts of consumer electronics and military customers who may not be impacted by the slow down in China and the temporary weakness in autos as was STM. I think ON has a fair report, maybe not blow out numbers, but I would expect meeting or slightly surpassing expectations, the market reaction will be dependent on whether the overall markets are strong or weak the day that they report. I wouldn't expect much more than a 3 to 5% move either way. I think most of the appreciation in this one has been already milked out of it with the pre-mature Goldman and Morgan Stanley upgrades for the semi sector. They are merely pumping the sector that they have been bearish on for nearly two years, I assume to make money for their wealthy clients whom they told to move into that sector."
52 next week ??
If I base myself on Microns Earnings I would say that the Semiconductor business is on fire. I know expect that every maker of electronic components will see higher sales and hopefully improved profitability. Fingers crossed that ON heads back over 40 by end of July
Good morning my fellow Americans.There is a semiconductor shortage..you should be buying.
Everyone keeps saying high volume and 5% gain....do we know why though? And reliable wise comments. ?/Thanks

Thank you. Took the best profit I had this year. Closed off 3% from day high (and lower than I sold). These things usually settle down as the excitement wears off. Plus you have the media trying to muck up the economy with more lock-downs all over.

I am Short at $39.08 with a lot of shares, so even at $37/.50 I will have an outstanding profit. My next play will be a Short Sell of SYY.

"Without a doubt, probably the best move made by any publicly traded company that I have followed or owned happened today. Yes it was risky, but it was also genius, ON semiconductor came out with their three year forecast. Will they be held to that, sure to some point, but we all know companies have these forecasts, why not make it public to your shareholders? They do own the company at the end of the day. Simply genius, I may buy shares again soon."
Giving back the gains....gotta love this stock!
This is going to the moon tomorrow. How does it feel to be wanted by Tesla.
gonna touch 50 soon!
"More info:Earlier today, STMicroelectronics posted positive preliminary Q3 results and raised its full-year sales outlook.Rosenblatt Securities analyst Kevin Cassidy says the news is positive for ON Semiconductor (NASDAQ:ON), which has a similar auto end market exposure.Cassidy now sees ""likely upside to our and consensus estimates"" for ON and maintains a Buy rating.The analyst also notes that STM's news seems to show that auto demand continued to accelerate through September.Context: Other chip stocks with auto exposure include NXP Semi (NXPI +5.8%), Maxim Integrated (MXIM +2.7%), and Texas Instruments (TXN +1.9%).ON shares are currently up 5.9% to $22.96.Previously: STMicroelectronics guides Q3 and FY20 revenue above consensus (Oct. 01 2020)"
intel down to 47 from a high of 58...ON down from a high of 27+ to 22+...both reporting blowout quarters and forecasting strong outlooks...and yet taken down by scam market...if that is not a rigged and market makers not manipulating ..then maybe someone needs to educate us on why the price action is what it is ?
It’s got a buy rating on 7-19
Were there any analysts today that come out with recommendations/upgrades/downgrades? I have not been able to find any so far.
"Scott, do you have any stocks right now which aren't frustrating to you? If so, you are doing better than most. With the markets being played like at no other time in history, there is no way of predicting what any stock will do. Fundamentals have no basis of reality in current trading. You are right that this stock should be higher, much higher not sure about that one, but definitely should be in the low 30's to mid 30's based simply on its P/E both trailing and forward and comparing that to the overall S and P average and even more so the average P/E of all stocks historically. You really can't let the current markets get you down. There is a concerted effort by the analysts, financial and main stream news media, the uber wealthy to try and drive the economy into a recession to discredit the President. It is just proving to be a lot harder than people thought since unemployment levels are at historic lows. Yet they were successful in creating enough uncertainty and angst by tanking the markets until Christmas Eve, to cause retail sales to not be as strong as they should have been. Just be patient."
Earnings coming 2/5 
"Just bought back into ON after selling it near 20 bucks a few months ago. Stock IMO is very cheap here, considering its earnings and revenues. Overall Market is really crazy right now. Could be the rally is based on early month inflows into mutual funds/hedge funds being put to work. Stock may have bottomed but just in case I bought 1/2 of what I needed!!!"
Heavy volume. Impressive sign....next wk wii reward the loyals
"Like ON for a few reasons:1) They are in automotive and industrial semiconductor chips supply, currently there is a shortage;2) New management team from Cypress, the CEO, CFO. I used to be a Cypress share holders and have done well under their stewardship.3) The only drawback I can see is the high forward PE so will sell puts to acquire at the price I like."
"GS UPGRADES ON Semi to BUYGoldman Sachs upgrades ON Semi (NASDAQ:ON) from Neutral to Buy and raises the target from $22 to $26 citing an improved position on secular growth opportunities in data center and telecom chips, ADAS camera sensors, and auto-related chips.Analyst Mark Delaney says ON could still face cyclical pressures, but sees evidence ""ON is improving cycle to cycle"" and thinks the semi cycle risks are priced into the stock.ON shares are up 2.4% pre-market to $21.51."

"CFRA MAINTAINS BUY OPINION ON SHARES OF ON SEMICONDUCTOR CORPORATION2:05 pm ET August 2, 2021 (CFRA) PrintWe up our 12-month target price to $50 from $41 on a near-peer P/E of 18.5x our '22 estimate. We raise our '21 EPS view to $2.43 from $1.64 and '22's to $2.71 from $2.08. ON posts Q2 EPS of $0.63 vs. $0.12, beating the $0.49 consensus. Sales grew 38%, better than expected, led by growth in automotive (+69%), computing (+59%), consumer (+38%), industrial (+24%), and communications (+2%). Gross margin widened 320 basis points from Q1 to 38.4% and we see further improvement ahead, as ON looks towards further rationalizing its cost structure/product portfolio and focuses on a more asset light manufacturing strategy. We believe ON will be able to outgrow the broader industry by 1.5x-2x, driven by its content growth potential, led by image sensors/silicon carbide, within the automotive market. ON remains in a supply constrained environment, as end-demand remains robust and customer inventories depleted, supporting longer lead times/revenue visibility. We see ON raising growth targets at its Analyst Event on 8/5."

"Wow, the shorts and the general negative nancy's are out in force trying to convince Americans and investors that the economy really isn't doing as well as it obviously is. And yet again we have the Morgan Stanley analysts who has been saying that the semiconductor market was going to collapse since the Trump election claiming that ON is going to 14 dollars a share. Truly amazing, they are completely deluding themselves and the investment community based on their political beliefs and their desire to tank the economy, truly amazing."

"The news is out! Ex Cypress CEO El-Khoury is the new CEO. What do you guys think? I think it is good news considering he definitely has the experience to run a semiconductor company of similar size and target market, and he is most certainly not opposed to selling.

Is ON the secret supplier for SAV to Elon Musk?
Estimates have actually risen so much that the stock now has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) suggesting this relatively unloved stock could be due for a breakout soon. This will be especially true if ON stock can build momentum from here and find a way to continue higher of off this encouraging trading development
"Does anyone really, and I mean really believe that ON and so many other tech stocks are down for any other reason than manipulation? If trade concerns were a real concern, why wouldn't they impact NVDA and AMD, both chip providers who sell a LOT of products to Chinese and European vendors. Why wouldn't Apple, probably the one company in America that has the biggest current and future exposure to China not be impacted. Inventories being high? Again, why can MU which provides memory be pounded while NVDA and AMD which provides GPUs and CPUs be soaring? None of that logic applies, next false narrative and at least make it plausible."

"More details from IB:Rosenblatt Securities increased ON Semiconductor’s price target to $35 (57.7% upside potential) from $30 and reiterated a Buy rating amid expectations of gross margin expansion.Rosenblatt Securities analyst Kevin Cassidy said on Tuesday that ON Semiconductor’s (ON) gross margin is likely to continue expanding through 2021, given the company’s better product mix and improving fab utilization. “This, followed by better than expected 300mm East Fishkill production yields, drive upside to our [gross margin] GM estimates in 2022,” Cassidy wrote in a note to investors.On Aug. 8, ON reported better-than-expected top-line results for 2Q as revenues of $1.21 billion beat analysts’ expectations of $1.18 billion. The company’s adjusted EPS of $0.12 surpassed Street estimates of $0.02.Benchmark analyst Ruben Roy raised the stock’s price target to $28 (26.2% upside potential) from $24 and reaffirmed a Buy rating. Roy wrote in a research note that he “is encouraged with ON’s gross margin outlook and a renewed focus on longer-term gross margin expansion”.Leba911, MEng. PhD"

"12:34 pm: More central banks sound the alarm over near-term economic impact of the coronavirusMalaysia’s central bank said Wednesday that first-quarter growth will be affected by the outbreak that spurred shutdowns in China in efforts to contain the virus’ spread. “The overall impact of the virus on the Malaysian economy will, however, depend on the duration and spread of the outbreak as well as policy responses by the authorities,” Bank Negara Malaysia said in a statement. For its part, Malaysia has agreed to set up a joint working group with neighbor Singapore to coordinate responses to the virus outbreak. (see 7:42 a.m. update)New Zealand’s central bank, which kept its official cash rate unchanged at 1%, said it assumed the overall economic impact in the country will be short and mostly concentrated in the first half of 2020. Governor Adrian Orr predicted around six weeks of disruption, with the assumption that some normalization would happen over March and that travel restrictions to China are lifted, Reuters reported.Last week, the Philippine central bank warned of an “adverse impact” on economic activity and market sentiment in the near-term due to the outbreak."

Already own TSM and believe that because chip stocks were one of the 1st groups to fall in this Bear Market, they will be one of the groups to eventually lead us out of this morass!! Really like the well diversified business of ON. Also like the fact they are UP today, in a down market. Chart indicates a VERY Solid Double Bottom recently. Wish I had the guts to back up the truck, but we could be heading down to retest the recent Market lows very soon!!"

"Stock inexpensive even including some downside risksEven as companies have given a sluggish Q1/2019 outlook, their stocks have done welldue to positioning and due to perception of Q1 guide creating the “last EPS cut” for theyear. This assumes resolution of trade tensions, but assuming they are resolved, webelieve SMidcap semis with more autos content (ON, NXPI, CY) and potentially a 5Ggrowth kicker, could do relatively better than larger-cap more industrial exposed peers.For 2019, we model ON sales to expand ~2.6% YoY and pf-EPS of $1.89. Even if salesgets revised down to say flat to -2%, and pf-EPS to say $1.65-$1.75, in our view thestock’s <12x PE still remains compelling at a ~30%+ discount to peers. ON’s strongunderlevered (<2x net debt/EBITDA) balance sheet and solid FCF generation (9%+ FCFyield) provides flexibility for enhancing buybacks and/or considering any M&A"
short sellers...market makers picking up inventory and scaring the retail investor....ON outlook is strong and it would not surprise me that ON and CY merge...analog semi sector consolidation is in the works...and that does not need China approval...

"Semiconductors possess specific electrical properties. A substance that conducts electricity is called a conductor, and a substance that does not conduct electricity is called an insulator. Semiconductors are substances with properties somewhere between them. ICs(integrated circuits) and electronic discrete components such as diodes and transistors are made of semiconductors. Common elemental semiconductors are silicon and germanium. Silicon is well-known of these. Silicon forms most of ICs. Common semiconductor compounds are such as gallium arsenide or indium antimonide.Semiconductors became essential for many electronic appliances as well as for social infrastructure that support our everyday life.Semiconductors play an important role in equipment control in a variety of fields, such as operating air conditioners at a comfortable room temperature, improving automobile safety, laser treatment in cutting-edge medical care and many more. Moreover, the advances of semiconductor technology have driven systems efficiency, miniaturization and energy savings, which in turn help to preserve the global environment in addition to achieving safe and comfortable life and to create prosperous future.Semiconductors were discovered all the way back in 19th century. In the 1940s, transistors were invented. Radios, which used vacuum tubes until then, were significantly downsized and became portable. A widely known semiconductor is silicon. Electronic components using semiconductors are called semiconductor devices, including the IC, which is an integrated circuit of transistors. Semiconductor devices mounted inside many electronics appliances are important electronic components that support our everyday live."

"Waiting till it hit $17, then is a great buy opportunity"
Thank You to All that are selling!! Because I Bought more!! Blue light special BABY!!!
Guess on price action on Monday??Will probably depend on what management will say in earnings call??
"Well I do understand downgrade but I don't agree with it. The thing is that there will be 2 very positive quarters now it is sort of given and then they probably expect things to return to normal + Q1 is not the strongest quarter seasonally overall. So in other words they expect a normal kind of cycle here. But I think it is not a normal kind of cycle - did you hear before about production halts due to semiconductor shortages? While other firms like $MRVL, $MCHP, $ON forecast very strong demand for 2022 I am sure business will be booming here as well, because firms are reluctant to increase their production capacity significantly - not to get into overproduction when things improve - instead they try to outsource production for the time being where possible. Then again next year will have a significant momentum in consumer PCs and servers because of rotation to DDR5 and new processors, mobile also should be strong because of further expansion of 5G, cause many people still haven't rotated to a 5G phone."
"I just started looking at this company. Can anyone tell me why their gross margin is so much less than many other, if not most other, semi companies? A lot of semi companies have GMs of 60% or more. ON only had GMs of 37% last year. That is a big difference and it certainly explains the lower valuation for ON. Do they make commodity chips with less engineering input? Of the semi stocks that I compared, only CY was down in this 40% area for GMs. But even its valuation is better than ON's"
Yep the semis have no taken over as the market leader.
"When the recession is coming in a few month, speculators ans institutions have to sell volatile stocks and buy conservative dividend stocks in order to maintain acceptable portfolios for their investors. The world is now in recession alarm, it rapidly needs Europe and China trade agreements to avoid such an outcome. Recession + Trade War would reduce significantly ON value."
Morgan Stanley said same thing in April 2018
"Darin, if ITW which I know is an industrial play though also tied to automotive, dropped for two days after earnings, though they did peak at the open on the second day, if you could get it at a low today and sell the first thing in the AM tomorrow, you could probably make a quick .50 to .75 per share but if your timing is bad, you will end up down as by the end of day it will probably be down once more. It should start to recover on Wednesday and Thursday assuming no other story lines about World War III starting or something else."

Curious anyone know if this got any coverage on CNBC yet? I don't know who is on Powerlunch today but maybe they will talk about it then. I should have added more on the recent pullback but happy with this move today!
ON Semiconductor price target raised to $48 from $46 at Susquehanna Susquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland raised the firm's price target on ON Semiconductor to $48 from $46 and keeps a Positive rating on the shares. The analyst said his confidence in the company's successful turnaround continue to grow as management's tone during their meetings was generally upbeat.
"ON is increasing its margins quickly. Last year, its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) margin was 20.5%. By the end of 2023, analysts expect it should rise to 30.6%. ON’s currently low margins are the main reason it’s valued below its peers. But as margins rise, so will its valuations. This makes ON extremely undervalued at these prices."
I saw the results but I do wonder how the market is going to react to these results?
Under valued should be 50-70
Trying to look through the TXN good report and STM negative report and see the differences. Interesting. Any thoughts on how the ON report will go on the 5th? Seems they are aligned a little closet to STM than TXN in their businesses. There are others on here who are much more knowledgeable than I am on this. Any thoughts?
"ON is a screaming BUY now, loaded up 3,290 shares for cheap price."
There was a leak this morning about Quantenna Com. Acquisition. Several millions shares changed hands during the first hour. Very bad for us. This is forbidden by law
"ON Semiconductor Corporation (Nasdaq: ON) plans to announce its financial results for the second quarter, which ended June 29, 2018, before the market opens on Monday, July 30, 2018.The company will host a conference call at 9 a.m. Eastern Time (EDT) on July 30, 2018, following the release of its financial results.

Acqusition is more interesting than speculations over yield curve inversions.
"On is very undervalued and trading around 3x sales. Its competitors like NXPI and MRVL are trading around 5-6x sales. The new management is trying to improve the company's margin. On is also a potential take-over target. No matter what, believe ON can be double or triple within 6-12 months due to its low value as well as EV tailwinds.."
Running today.

"Dr., pretty much as I figured though the trade concerns are exacerbating the reaction, of course the reaction is being pumped by big money Wall Streeters, by the end of the week, all concerns will again be mitigated and the stock prices will go up once again. In the end, the small retail investors will panic and sell, the big money boys will buy at wild discounts and then send their analysts out to pump the stocks, sectors and markets overall as unheard of values. Then the small retail investors will jump back in fearing that they will miss the next major push and then the big money will dump again and send out their analysts to explain that the markets are afraid of something, maybe the Tooth Fairy."
Breaking out of the handle
Looks like TXN blew the doors off all expectations with a triple beat.That bodes very well for this stock as well.
This stock is about to get crazy and out of reach because they make everything needed for autonomous cars and there’s a shortage of semiconductor out there. Get onboard or see the ship sail by. Strong Hold the big financial company’s are bringing down the price so that we sell they buy at discount and then it shoots without a ceiling.
Why is ON price diving?
Loving this.
"all day long there was a buy order at 36.10 of upwards of 200,000 shares. Some one does not want this to below that. I am guessing that they are going to have great earnings in a few weeks."

But two stocks, ON Semiconductor and Nvidia, may be poised to rebound by the most significant amounts.
