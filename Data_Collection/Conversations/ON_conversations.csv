Read through the presentation. Looked great. Very pro M&A in the semi industry. Talked like they are looking for acquisitions. Thoughts on that JC? You seem to be most knowledgeable about ON. Would ON be a buyout candidate? Not sure who could afford them though? I was thinking they might go after CY. Would that be a good fit? I am new to ON and not as knowledgeable as the rest of you on here.
"Weird to see this down today. I must have seen multiple upgrades and and like 10 PT increases. Morgan Stanley was the only one to go negative reducing the PT to 25 bucks. Go figure. Morgan Stanley says it is so, it is so."

"More details from IB:Rosenblatt Securities increased ON Semiconductor’s price target to $35 (57.7% upside potential) from $30 and reiterated a Buy rating amid expectations of gross margin expansion.Rosenblatt Securities analyst Kevin Cassidy said on Tuesday that ON Semiconductor’s (ON) gross margin is likely to continue expanding through 2021, given the company’s better product mix and improving fab utilization. “This, followed by better than expected 300mm East Fishkill production yields, drive upside to our [gross margin] GM estimates in 2022,” Cassidy wrote in a note to investors.On Aug. 8, ON reported better-than-expected top-line results for 2Q as revenues of $1.21 billion beat analysts’ expectations of $1.18 billion. The company’s adjusted EPS of $0.12 surpassed Street estimates of $0.02.Benchmark analyst Ruben Roy raised the stock’s price target to $28 (26.2% upside potential) from $24 and reaffirmed a Buy rating. Roy wrote in a research note that he “is encouraged with ON’s gross margin outlook and a renewed focus on longer-term gross margin expansion”.Leba911, MEng. PhD"
Read an article Thai Samsung is possibly looking to buy with their big cash position. The article mentioned they want an auto semi maker and suggested NXPI as a possible candidate. What about ON? Thoughts?

Will we break the 52 week high today ?

"This is not bad guidance, sorry. Shorts better cover!...“We once again delivered strong performance in the fourth quarter despite slowdown in macroeconomic conditions. Key secular trends driving growth in our content in automotive, industrial, and cloud-power end-markets remain intact, and we remain upbeat about our medium to long term outlook. Our design-win pipeline in our strategic markets is growing at a strong pace, our customer engagements are strengthening, and our competitive position is improving significantly,” said Keith Jackson, president and CEO of ON Semiconductor. “Despite confidence in our medium to long term outlook, we remain cognizant of slowing macroeconomic conditions, and we are managing our business prudently to adjust to changing demand environment.""“Along with strong revenue performance, we intend to continue to deliver solid margin and free cash flow performance through strong execution on operational front.”"
"Covered my ON Short Sell at $37.50 for a faster than expected and GREAT profit on a lot of shares! Short at $39.08, Cover at $37.50 early on the very next trading day! This is why I LOVE to be a Pure Earnings Short Seller. All you gotta do is pick the right stock, and its NOT hard to do, especially not in a Raging Bull market full of Irrational Exuberance ahead of earnings releases. :-) Good Luck Folks! I am moving on to my next Short Sell, and it will be SYY."
Thanks you Micron for good words about Semi! We need now more help from President Trump!
"company is dumping this stock, slowly but surely!"
"Zacks ranking has the word ""BUY"" !!"
"Hey guys and gals just wondering your take on this article. If you scroll down it quotes the CEO of ON saying....China is weaker than normal, weaker than seasonal,” said Keith Jackson CEO of ON Semiconductor. What is your take on this....is it a subtle way of saying our numbers are not going to be that good for the reporting quarter... little confused on this... comments? Thanks for your input --Scott ....article web page posted below...https://www.investopedia.com/how-china-s-slowdown-is-biting-into-u-s-corporate-profits-4584871?utm_campaign=quote-yahoo&utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=referral&yptr=yahoo"
Jeff Brown recommending ON. He said this company in sweet spot of technology.
"10,000 open contracts for Feb15 $20 put vs 200 open contracts for Feb15 $20 call.that equates to a lot of selling pressure, but it could backfire on shorts."
over 50$ soon and will continue up much farther from there
Morgan Stanley said same thing in April 2018
ON Semiconductor is up 9.78% to 42.88

"How bout that, ON is kicken #$%$! just like my previous post predicted!! shorts running for cover!!"
"Changing of the market leadership guard by the semis.Semi stocks are also a cyclical sector and are leading the way over more defensive software, a possible sign of a change in broader stock market leadershipThe tech sector has been boosted by a recent rebound in chip stocks, which have been mostly rising since the beginning of June. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index is up 10.9% in the past month, and 7.2% for the month of July so far. It is up 35.2% year-to-date."
Tons of cash on hand great products great team and a market cap of 1.4B how is that possible ? EXTREMELY UNDERVALUED $on to catch and 
"Just bought great bargain price for 8,705 shares...."
Thank you. Took the best profit I had this year. Closed off 3% from day high (and lower than I sold). These things usually settle down as the excitement wears off. Plus you have the media trying to muck up the economy with more lock-downs all over.
"Wow, the shorts and the general negative nancy's are out in force trying to convince Americans and investors that the economy really isn't doing as well as it obviously is. And yet again we have the Morgan Stanley analysts who has been saying that the semiconductor market was going to collapse since the Trump election claiming that ON is going to 14 dollars a share. Truly amazing, they are completely deluding themselves and the investment community based on their political beliefs and their desire to tank the economy, truly amazing."
"Just bought a few shares of ON semiconductor. Already own TSM and believe that because chip stocks were one of the 1st groups to fall in this Bear Market, they will be one of the groups to eventually lead us out of this morass!! Really like the well diversified business of ON. Also like the fact they are UP today, in a down market. Chart indicates a VERY Solid Double Bottom recently. Wish I had the guts to back up the truck, but we could be heading down to retest the recent Market lows very soon!!"
This is the undervalued stock that is on the cutting edge of the technology and clean energy revolution.
"Does anyone really, and I mean really believe that ON and so many other tech stocks are down for any other reason than manipulation? If trade concerns were a real concern, why wouldn't they impact NVDA and AMD, both chip providers who sell a LOT of products to Chinese and European vendors. Why wouldn't Apple, probably the one company in America that has the biggest current and future exposure to China not be impacted. Inventories being high? Again, why can MU which provides memory be pounded while NVDA and AMD which provides GPUs and CPUs be soaring? None of that logic applies, next false narrative and at least make it plausible."
"Rosenblatt Securities analyst Kevin Cassidy maintained a Buy rating on ON Semiconductor on Wednesday, setting a price target of $60, which is approximately 37.61% above the present share price of $43.6."

Rosenblatt gives new target Buy $60
"Needham Analysis about GTAT Acquisition:On August 25, ON agreed to acquire GT Advanced Technologies (GTAT) for $415 million. The company plans to finance the acquisition with its revolving credit and cash balances, which may burden its already heavily leveraged balance sheet. Possible Rationale and Outcomes of the AcquisitionNonetheless, the acquisition may have more pros than cons. Notably, GTAT is a silicon carbide (SiC) and sapphire materials supplier, which will help ON rapidly meet the rising demand for SiC products in areas like power applications, especially in the Automotive and Industrial end markets. The company expects to help GTAT scale its operations by providing its manufacturing expertise, resulting in faster development of SiC materials.The acquisition is expected to have no material impact on ON’s top-line and is likely to be slightly dilutive to the earnings per share (EPS) in the first year after the transaction closes. Nonetheless, GTAT will be accretive to the EPS from the second year onwards.￼Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill seems to be excited with this decision. His bullish sentiment reflected on his reinforcement of a Buy rating on the stock with a price target of $60. “We view these developments as positive for Automotive and Industrial segment top-line growth,” he explained.Gill observed that with this acquisition, ON aspires to reduce the time-to-market (TTM) and increase the supply of materials available to customers. He believes that the acquisition will boost the company’s margins over the years.Traction inverters are most in need of SiC materials. Notably, up to 20% of traction inverters are expected to be made from SiC materials by 2025.Gill noted, “Overall, SiC is expected to be a $1B market by 2025, with high demand for its energy density, faster switching, and higher breakdown voltage characteristics.”The Wall Street also seems optimistic on the stock and has a Strong Buy consensus based on 17 Buys, 2 Holds, and 1 Sell. The average ON price target of $54.05 implies 22.8% upside potential from current levels.￼￼"
"Just sold my position in ON. Double TOP formation has just formed (kiss of death if you are Bullish). Every time I have ignored this chart pattern I've regretted it (Big Time). Also, overall Market is at all time highs. It should turn lower later today or next week. That will take ON down with it further!! Be careful, this is NOT THE TIME to be a Hero!!"

nice rebound going backup
"management to showcase two items at the analyst day: 1) Breadth of product cycles: ON’s power management products extend beyond autos, and into many new growth markets in data center (cloud servers); 5G (base stations); electric vehicles (Silicon carbide) and advanced driver assist systems, many of which are brand new content gain opportunities; and 2) Potential to target higher 40-45% gross margins vs our/Street’s <39% outlook for the next few years. Higher GM can drive l-t EPS power towards $2.50-$3 in our view, and importantly help expand ON’s forward PE that has been ~11x and well below peers largely due to (mistaken in our view) perception of lower GM/lower value-add products."

ON Semiconductor CEO to be on Mad Money today.
"Without a doubt, probably the best move made by any publicly traded company that I have followed or owned happened today. Yes it was risky, but it was also genius, ON semiconductor came out with their three year forecast. Will they be held to that, sure to some point, but we all know companies have these forecasts, why not make it public to your shareholders? They do own the company at the end of the day. Simply genius, I may buy shares again soon."
Giving back the gains....gotta love this stock!
Under valued should be 50-70
"This results in an intrinsic value of $29.2. Compared to the current share price of $18.43, the stock is quite good value at a 36.9% discount to what it is available for right now."

AVGO said to be looking at smaller buyout targets than QCOM. ON may be a good fit.
"ON Semiconductor price target raised to $53 at Jefferies after analyst day Jefferies analyst Mark Lipacis raised the firm's price target on ON Semiconductor to $53 from $51 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares after the company revealed its new 2025 operating model at its analyst day meeting yesterday. ON expects to grow revenue at a 7-9% compound annual growth rate, improve its gross margin by 640 basis points to 45%, and improve its operating margin by 830 basis points to 28% between 2021-2025, said Lipacis, who also noted that ON said it will look to exit smaller, inefficient fabs."

He says QTNA might face ""stiff"" competition from those with ""requisite connectivity assets"" like NXP Semi (NYSE:NXP) and Cypress Semi (NASDAQ:CY).BofAML stays at Buy on ON with a $31 PT.ON Semi shares are up 0.2% pre-market and QTNA gains 18%."

"I just started looking at this company. Can anyone tell me why their gross margin is so much less than many other, if not most other, semi companies? A lot of semi companies have GMs of 60% or more. ON only had GMs of 37% last year. That is a big difference and it certainly explains the lower valuation for ON. Do they make commodity chips with less engineering input? Of the semi stocks that I compared, only CY was down in this 40% area for GMs. But even its valuation is better than ON's"

"Okay, just doubled down on my recent purchase of ON at 17.67!! First purchase was in the low 23s. Very good resistance around 17.50. Not sure where the bottom is but they beat their recent earnings and revenues. Yes, the China Trader war will hurt future sales but no one at this point has a clue how long this war will last, or how it will really effect sales. All you can do is pick your spots on where to add more shares."
"12:34 pm: More central banks sound the alarm over near-term economic impact of the coronavirusMalaysia’s central bank said Wednesday that first-quarter growth will be affected by the outbreak that spurred shutdowns in China in efforts to contain the virus’ spread. “The overall impact of the virus on the Malaysian economy will, however, depend on the duration and spread of the outbreak as well as policy responses by the authorities,” Bank Negara Malaysia said in a statement. For its part, Malaysia has agreed to set up a joint working group with neighbor Singapore to coordinate responses to the virus outbreak. (see 7:42 a.m. update)New Zealand’s central bank, which kept its official cash rate unchanged at 1%, said it assumed the overall economic impact in the country will be short and mostly concentrated in the first half of 2020. Governor Adrian Orr predicted around six weeks of disruption, with the assumption that some normalization would happen over March and that travel restrictions to China are lifted, Reuters reported.Last week, the Philippine central bank warned of an “adverse impact” on economic activity and market sentiment in the near-term due to the outbreak."

"*tap, tap, is the mic on?*This is how things are likely to go down. Wei Chung joined ON Semi as a tag-a-long to El-Khoury. Wei Chung followed Vijay Ulal from Maxim to FSC and the company worked to trim themselves for sale to ONSEMI at the time. Then he got a pay day and moved to Cypress and now back to ONSEMI. See the trend here? He's not an innovator AT ALL. I suspect he's convinced El-Khory he knows the old FCS playbook and what factories they could shut down. Covid and the automotive semi surge has likely has spoiled his plans in the short term so far as it would be suspect to trim in the middle of a record semi shortage. ONSEMI is primarily making parts with internal factories which is counter to how any company he's worked for prior. He likely will try and shutter factories, non-manufacturing offices, and support groups as ""cost cutting"" with opportunity to trim the company for sale. Also should keep an eye on Wei Chung as there has been speculation he's on the take so keep an eye on which factories he tries to steer business towards, especially in Taiwan. He's not an innovator or going to bring ONSEMI the next iPhone product so all he knows is to push more MFG to offshore subcons and eliminate/reduce the internal MFG footprint. If you are an ONSEMI employee, I would avoid any of Wei Chung's staff especially his low level minion Helen. When you meet her, you'll know it. She's so insecure you'll probably know what Uni she went to as she's like a pilot and will tell you where she went to school within the first 30 minutes of meeting her. Best advice is avoid her as she has Wei Chung's ear and will make comments about people and group value even when she has no or superficial knowledge of facts. Buyer beware, there are sharks in the water."
"This will end up red I am afraid, the big money boys are still gaming the tech sector. Too much of a dichotomy between companies that should be reacting in the same fashion. We have AMAT down today even though earnings next week and Lam blew the numbers off the hook. We have AMD and MU down and we have NVDA blowing up today even though they had poor numbers and weak guidance. There is still no logic or flow to anything in the tech sector. So my guess is that they will end up taking the sector down one more time based on false narratives about chip cycles or trade concerns or even the possibility of a recession. Eventually this and the whole sector will climb and probably net a 50% return by year end, it is just when that take off happens and when does the big money stop gaming the sector."
I heard about ON the other day on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
Curious anyone know if this got any coverage on CNBC yet? I don't know who is on Powerlunch today but maybe they will talk about it then. I should have added more on the recent pullback but happy with this move today!

"Dr., pretty much as I figured though the trade concerns are exacerbating the reaction, of course the reaction is being pumped by big money Wall Streeters, by the end of the week, all concerns will again be mitigated and the stock prices will go up once again. In the end, the small retail investors will panic and sell, the big money boys will buy at wild discounts and then send their analysts out to pump the stocks, sectors and markets overall as unheard of values. Then the small retail investors will jump back in fearing that they will miss the next major push and then the big money will dump again and send out their analysts to explain that the markets are afraid of something, maybe the Tooth Fairy."

"ON Semiconductor price target raised to $60 from $55 at BofA BofA analyst Vivek Arya raised the firm's price target on ON Semiconductor to $60 from $55 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares. The analyst remains ""firmly in the stronger-for-longer camp"" for semiconductors given their ""critical role in the rapidly digitizing global economy."" The companies face ""newfound pricing power and supply discipline"" with a ""very lean supply chain,"" Arya tells investors in a research note. He calls ON a top pick."
gonna touch 50 soon!
We have liftoff! Possible breakout! Thoughts?
"Well I do understand downgrade but I don't agree with it. The thing is that there will be 2 very positive quarters now it is sort of given and then they probably expect things to return to normal + Q1 is not the strongest quarter seasonally overall. So in other words they expect a normal kind of cycle here. But I think it is not a normal kind of cycle - did you hear before about production halts due to semiconductor shortages? While other firms like $MRVL, $MCHP, $ON forecast very strong demand for 2022 I am sure business will be booming here as well, because firms are reluctant to increase their production capacity significantly - not to get into overproduction when things improve - instead they try to outsource production for the time being where possible. Then again next year will have a significant momentum in consumer PCs and servers because of rotation to DDR5 and new processors, mobile also should be strong because of further expansion of 5G, cause many people still haven't rotated to a 5G phone."
From a day to day perspective this stock is frustrating to watch.
Why is this stock dropping?
"Been waiting for this opportunity, so now with everything on SALE I will go shopping. The reality, you can not produce a vehicle with out their chips. Many manufacturers product the vehicle and let them sit until they get the chips."
Piper Sandler: Overweight just out today: $45Last target: $35Dr. Leba911
"I would agree with your thoughts concerning ON aligning more with STM than TXN, though with the acquisition of Fairchild, their customer base is much more diversified than STM which was very dependent on auto as was the pre-Fairchild ON. With Fairchild, their customers include OEMs who build systems for utilities, power management systems for all sorts of consumer electronics and military customers who may not be impacted by the slow down in China and the temporary weakness in autos as was STM. I think ON has a fair report, maybe not blow out numbers, but I would expect meeting or slightly surpassing expectations, the market reaction will be dependent on whether the overall markets are strong or weak the day that they report. I wouldn't expect much more than a 3 to 5% move either way. I think most of the appreciation in this one has been already milked out of it with the pre-mature Goldman and Morgan Stanley upgrades for the semi sector. They are merely pumping the sector that they have been bearish on for nearly two years, I assume to make money for their wealthy clients whom they told to move into that sector."
"ON is modestly bid up here in the pre-market on very thin volume, but let's wait until the 9:00 AM Conference Call gets underway and then volume builds up into the open. I see sellers coming in and driving the price down. 9:00 ET is an Interesting time for a Conference Call, company seems to think they can use positive spin to build forward momentum into the open, but I think the opposite will happen as the overall market realizes the ER numbers are just not good enough to justify a Green day."
16.7 million short shares have to be covered. ON will be at least double or triple.
Upgrades coming soon….
I'm still holding all my shares even after being up 6% this morning - not even tempted to sell - this thing will be at $40 in no time.
Named to Fortune 500 list. Nice. This thing is so under the radar - maybe will get some more exposure and press now. Analyst upgrades hopefully soon. See this at $30 or more by end of year.
"TER is a very good semiconductor equipment, but it sinked deeply after its lately earning report ....Careful ON could be sinking as well on this monday 's earning report...."
There sure is going to be a ton of buys for short covering when ON beats estimates.ON is the one stock on wall street for a company with a lot of business and an ethical leadership team.
"On is very undervalued and trading around 3x sales. Its competitors like NXPI and MRVL are trading around 5-6x sales. The new management is trying to improve the company's margin. On is also a potential take-over target. No matter what, believe ON can be double or triple within 6-12 months due to its low value as well as EV tailwinds.."

"ON Semiconductor (NASDAQ:ON) had its price target upped by stock analysts at Susquehanna from $57.00 to $63.00 in a report issued on Friday, The Fly reports. The firm currently has a “positive” rating on the semiconductor company’s stock. Susquehanna’s price objective would indicate a potential upside of 40.56% from the stock’s previous close."
Breaking out of the handle
If I base myself on Microns Earnings I would say that the Semiconductor business is on fire. I know expect that every maker of electronic components will see higher sales and hopefully improved profitability. Fingers crossed that ON heads back over 40 by end of July
On is still undervalued and trading around 3x sales. It will reach around 7 billions revenue next year with next year's PE around 17-18. Its competitors like NXPI and MRVL are trading around 5-6x sales. The new management is trying to improve the company's margin. ON can be double or triple within 6-12 months due to its low value as well as EV tailwinds..

"this is consistent with other semi following good results - CY, SWKS, etc"
"The news is out! Ex Cypress CEO El-Khoury is the new CEO. What do you guys think? I think it is good news considering he definitely has the experience to run a semiconductor company of similar size and target market, and he is most certainly not opposed to selling. (He sold Cypress to infenion for 9 billion.) So at least we know we have a CEO that will not derail a potential sale in order to keep his job."
This stock is about to get crazy and out of reach because they make everything needed for autonomous cars and there’s a shortage of semiconductor out there. Get onboard or see the ship sail by. Strong Hold the big financial company’s are bringing down the price so that we sell they buy at discount and then it shoots without a ceiling.
To da MOON!
ON historically posts revenue & earnings the weekend before the formal release. check the website.
"I think AMD's earnings will be a blowout, since companies like $MRVL, $ON, $MU which have significant datacenter exposure reported significant growth in that segment. AMD is objective the leader in datacenter processors for now."
There is a semiconductor shortage yet every day this company drops. There’s something going on that I don’t know. Are insiders selling? Please let me know.
ALERT !BUY MORE ON THIS BIG OPPORTUNITY DIP....COULD BE $50 BY TOMORROW....
"Trust Securities: Buy, new price: $51"
"Looks like they did the shock and awe approach to dropping prices for the tech sector one more time, they used the ""poor"" numbers from Xilinx and Intel to dump the sector at the open and now are buying in again to drive it up one more time. The news media will cite improved trade talks which everyone knows is all but a done deal as the catalyst."
"On Semi is in the sweet spot. Every Auto manufacturer is crying for chips, i.e. partial reason why the acquisition of GTAT, very high demand"
Looking good today! Nice ER!
ON Semiconductor price target raised to $48 from $46 at Susquehanna Susquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland raised the firm's price target on ON Semiconductor to $48 from $46 and keeps a Positive rating on the shares. The analyst said his confidence in the company's successful turnaround continue to grow as management's tone during their meetings was generally upbeat.
"There is a heavy load of institutions as shareholders for this stock. Gotta tell you this company is a winner. With the automobile industry just getting started with electrical cars, trucks, etc. this company will be in a timely fashion demand for a very long time."
Bought months ago. It went high because more hedge funds are buying. Good long term investment.
"Like ON for a few reasons:1) They are in automotive and industrial semiconductor chips supply, currently there is a shortage;2) New management team from Cypress, the CEO, CFO. I used to be a Cypress share holders and have done well under their stewardship.3) The only drawback I can see is the high forward PE so will sell puts to acquire at the price I like."

"CFRA MAINTAINS BUY OPINION ON SHARES OF ON SEMICONDUCTOR CORPORATION2:05 pm ET August 2, 2021 (CFRA) PrintWe up our 12-month target price to $50 from $41 on a near-peer P/E of 18.5x our '22 estimate. We raise our '21 EPS view to $2.43 from $1.64 and '22's to $2.71 from $2.08. ON posts Q2 EPS of $0.63 vs. $0.12, beating the $0.49 consensus. Sales grew 38%, better than expected, led by growth in automotive (+69%), computing (+59%), consumer (+38%), industrial (+24%), and communications (+2%). Gross margin widened 320 basis points from Q1 to 38.4% and we see further improvement ahead, as ON looks towards further rationalizing its cost structure/product portfolio and focuses on a more asset light manufacturing strategy. We believe ON will be able to outgrow the broader industry by 1.5x-2x, driven by its content growth potential, led by image sensors/silicon carbide, within the automotive market. ON remains in a supply constrained environment, as end-demand remains robust and customer inventories depleted, supporting longer lead times/revenue visibility. We see ON raising growth targets at its Analyst Event on 8/5."

"Semiconductors possess specific electrical properties. A substance that conducts electricity is called a conductor, and a substance that does not conduct electricity is called an insulator. Semiconductors are substances with properties somewhere between them. ICs(integrated circuits) and electronic discrete components such as diodes and transistors are made of semiconductors. Common elemental semiconductors are silicon and germanium. Silicon is well-known of these. Silicon forms most of ICs. Common semiconductor compounds are such as gallium arsenide or indium antimonide.Semiconductors became essential for many electronic appliances as well as for social infrastructure that support our everyday life.Semiconductors play an important role in equipment control in a variety of fields, such as operating air conditioners at a comfortable room temperature, improving automobile safety, laser treatment in cutting-edge medical care and many more. Moreover, the advances of semiconductor technology have driven systems efficiency, miniaturization and energy savings, which in turn help to preserve the global environment in addition to achieving safe and comfortable life and to create prosperous future.Semiconductors were discovered all the way back in 19th century. In the 1940s, transistors were invented. Radios, which used vacuum tubes until then, were significantly downsized and became portable. A widely known semiconductor is silicon. Electronic components using semiconductors are called semiconductor devices, including the IC, which is an integrated circuit of transistors. Semiconductor devices mounted inside many electronics appliances are important electronic components that support our everyday live."
Everyone keeps saying high volume and 5% gain....do we know why though? And reliable wise comments. ?/Thanks
wow glad i found this one. its a game changer and buying more and more
"ON is increasing its margins quickly. Last year, its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) margin was 20.5%. By the end of 2023, analysts expect it should rise to 30.6%. ON’s currently low margins are the main reason it’s valued below its peers. But as margins rise, so will its valuations. This makes ON extremely undervalued at these prices."
"Today we go up helping by TXN earnings release last day. Possibly $27 before earnings release on 3, February."
liking this a lot
