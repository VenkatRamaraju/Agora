"*tap, tap, is the mic on?*This is how things are likely to go down. Wei Chung joined ON Semi as a tag-a-long to El-Khoury. Wei Chung followed Vijay Ulal from Maxim to FSC and the company worked to trim themselves for sale to ONSEMI at the time. Then he got a pay day and moved to Cypress and now back to ONSEMI. See the trend here? He's not an innovator AT ALL. I suspect he's convinced El-Khory he knows the old FCS playbook and what factories they could shut down. Covid and the automotive semi surge has likely has spoiled his plans in the short term so far as it would be suspect to trim in the middle of a record semi shortage. ONSEMI is primarily making parts with internal factories which is counter to how any company he's worked for prior. He likely will try and shutter factories, non-manufacturing offices, and support groups as ""cost cutting"" with opportunity to trim the company for sale. Also should keep an eye on Wei Chung as there has been speculation he's on the take so keep an eye on which factories he tries to steer business towards, especially in Taiwan. He's not an innovator or going to bring ONSEMI the next iPhone product so all he knows is to push more MFG to offshore subcons and eliminate/reduce the internal MFG footprint. If you are an ONSEMI employee, I would avoid any of Wei Chung's staff especially his low level minion Helen. When you meet her, you'll know it. She's so insecure you'll probably know what Uni she went to as she's like a pilot and will tell you where she went to school within the first 30 minutes of meeting her. Best advice is avoid her as she has Wei Chung's ear and will make comments about people and group value even when she has no or superficial knowledge of facts. Buyer beware, there are sharks in the water."
"On Semi is in the sweet spot. Every Auto manufacturer is crying for chips, i.e. partial reason why the acquisition of GTAT, very high demand"
"DOWN AGAIN TOMORROW for ON as BIG WHALES of AAPL, AMZN plunged deeply in after hour earning reports....NEXT STOP UNDER $44.00SELL...SELL...AND SELL...."
"I think AMD's earnings will be a blowout, since companies like $MRVL, $ON, $MU which have significant datacenter exposure reported significant growth in that segment. AMD is objective the leader in datacenter processors for now."
Way oversold....back to 48 very soon imo
over 50$ soon and will continue up much farther from there
On is still undervalued and trading around 3x sales. It will reach around 7 billions revenue next year with next year's PE around 17-18. Its competitors like NXPI and MRVL are trading around 5-6x sales. The new management is trying to improve the company's margin. ON can be double or triple within 6-12 months due to its low value as well as EV tailwinds..
"Plunge again tomorrow for sure by AAPL, AMZN, which are e/r reported bably in after hours today !The whole market sink tomorrow !!!!!!!!!!!!"
ON will dominate in EV space and there is one other small up-and-comer to look at who might become a perfect target acquisition of ON once a new bi-directional application is commercialized next year...look at IPWR!
"ON Semiconductor Co. (NASDAQ:ON) Director Gregory L. Waters purchased 17,000 shares of the firm's stock in a transaction on Tuesday, September 7th. The shares were acquired at an average price of $45.26 per share, with a total value of $769,420.00."
wow glad i found this one. its a game changer and buying more and more
Consolidation than push pass 50
just sold 800 shares...will buy back next week when lower...
"It is time to load up EV related stocks such as ON, ACLS if you believe in EV and TSLA."
ON: A SCREAMING BUY...BUY MORE TODAY !
"ON Semiconductor price target raised to $60 from $55 at BofA BofA analyst Vivek Arya raised the firm's price target on ON Semiconductor to $60 from $55 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares. The analyst remains ""firmly in the stronger-for-longer camp"" for semiconductors given their ""critical role in the rapidly digitizing global economy."" The companies face ""newfound pricing power and supply discipline"" with a ""very lean supply chain,"" Arya tells investors in a research note. He calls ON a top pick."
100 soon !!!
Bought months ago. It went high because more hedge funds are buying. Good long term investment.
"Well I do understand downgrade but I don't agree with it. The thing is that there will be 2 very positive quarters now it is sort of given and then they probably expect things to return to normal + Q1 is not the strongest quarter seasonally overall. So in other words they expect a normal kind of cycle here. But I think it is not a normal kind of cycle - did you hear before about production halts due to semiconductor shortages? While other firms like $MRVL, $MCHP, $ON forecast very strong demand for 2022 I am sure business will be booming here as well, because firms are reluctant to increase their production capacity significantly - not to get into overproduction when things improve - instead they try to outsource production for the time being where possible. Then again next year will have a significant momentum in consumer PCs and servers because of rotation to DDR5 and new processors, mobile also should be strong because of further expansion of 5G, cause many people still haven't rotated to a 5G phone."
"Analog chip vendors Texas Instruments (TI) and Onsemi have both made upward adjustments in their chip prices as delivery lead times have been prolonged to over six months, and their peer makers in Taiwan are expected to follow suit soon, according to...Cage Chao, Taipei; Willis Ke, DIGITIMESWednesday 15 September 2021"
