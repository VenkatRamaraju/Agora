Awesome day today.
What a great buy at these levels!!!! Beautiful dividend
Got at $94.50 
"Even though it's a miss, it's a damn good report. Great earnings, great cash-flows, paying down debt...accumulate on weakness."
Great buy @ under $66
Suspected something awful was in the making when the walk back from $118 kicked in. Didn’t suspect the CEO LEAVING. is Grace not a competitor? They are being acquired by years end. Tough to pick a bottom here. Maybe look at graces new owners.
"Remember there are huge gains for those who bought in the $30’s $40’s and up to $120 over the past year or so. Have to be many selling to lock in those gains or limit losses if they bought high. Tops are difficult to read, bottoms near impossible!"
"gas is up, oil is up, that makes feedstock prices up, lowering margins on on products that sold on contract. beware that an earnings miss may be just down the road."
Looks like the Lyb dip happened today the 21st. Note to self.. buy all of your sticks at or around the 20th if every month.
I don't see any problems at all. Seems they are very excited about paying down debt and buying back shares. Unplanned outages are unfortunate but demand is robust

"Great ---Early Bird--- Buying this morning! Nibble, nibble, and hopeful for some lower dips to add more! glt"
Anyone notice the dips on the 20th of each month?
Just bought some more… good luck everyone. Bargain in 2021
"they may have some margin pressures going forward, but their earnings are fantastic. so what if they did not beat a very high earnings projection amount. they made gobs of money. nice fat dividend too. this is a great company."
I am voting AGAINST the stock repurchase plan. I would prefer to see a DEBT REDUCTION PLAN. The forward PE of 6 should be able to go up without a stock buyback. The previous stock buybacks have not helped much. Loweringing the debt builds a more solid financial foundation able to withstand hard times while reducing interest expense.
"LYB has over 15% dividend buyback yield when you include the Dutch tender. I was a buyer at 83,79, & 75. This doesn’t even take into account the recent dividend increase. Looks good to me."
The 20th is tomorrow. If the lyb dip doesn’t happen… maybe buy the clx or kmb dip that happened today and hopefully more so tomorrow.
What an absolutely beautiful safe dividend
Should have bought more at $93
Buyer at $92.00 for a 5% yield
Got this at $95.75 today 
Got more at 91.61…
mewSA article....dont buy LYB!
What a beautiful stock!
Wow. My investment yesterday is worth more today. This company feels right.
Larger question becomes does Patel take his people with him to Grace. Seems very likely as Standard paid a big premium for the complacent Grace. Must have had a plan to bring Patel and friends in to clean house there.
"Revenue grew Q over Q and cash from operations was the biggest in 8 quarters . Cash Flow statement isn't broken down but shows LYB accumulated $400 million in cash after investments , debt reduction and dividends https://www.lyondellbasell.com/globalassets/investors/earnings-release/2021/q3/3q21-earnings-release-non-gaap-website-tables.pdf"
"mr besell was the company he took company stock from $64 to $118 now herecome thescaryscary crashcrash back below $70 ,he is the company, it will beveryvery hard to replace him ,guess thierwastalk he was leavingthat iswhythestock startedto crashcrashfom $118 ,then when it came true thestock evem crash more and more ,this wont stop crashing until it goesback below $70 ,get what you can now orget alotlot less then $70 soon beveryvery afaid tolossalotlot moremoney below $70,run run tolthe exit exit door as fast as you can"
It will be a beat! and scene. Good luck longs
It's one thing to open up a position when a stock is trading at or below the mid-way point of the 52 week hi/lo.Right now that number is $92.37. LYB is a strong company in the materials sector and has a Forward Dividend & Yield $4.52 (4.91%) I seriously don't think the 'sky' is going to fall in on LYB!
$90.75 and we will be at a 5% yield 
One more purchase. Too good to pass up.
Peter… we are buyers. Let it fall. I am accumulating.
Long LYB! Great company with superb dividend
"Any doubt about LYB, just look at what they manufacture and refine. They manufacture petrochemical products that are used in a wide range of industries, including in the manufacturing of personal care products, lightweight plastics, food packaging, automotive components, for medical applications, biofuels, and more. It’s ironic that all the ""green people"" who despise oil and plastics when many of their 'health foods and products are packaged in, quiet, don’t tell them!"
only tech is allowed to win !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
if LYB approaches 5 pct yield I'm in with strong position....waiting
"Added to my position at $95.00. Down a few bucks but that's ok. Strong earnings, good dividend, important products!"
"If the price of the shares keeps dropping, who isn’t adding? Awesome eps and dividend. A drop in eps is still a screaming buy at this valuation."
