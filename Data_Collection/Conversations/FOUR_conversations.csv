BRIEF-Shift4 Payments Says October Payment Volume Is Up Over 80% Versus Similar Period A Year AgoBY Reuters— 1:00 PM ET 10/28/2021
"Many people are seeking for stability in this unstable crypto space and even the stock market, A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now. I'd say it's wrong to just sit back hold and wait maybe incur some losses along the line, that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making profits should be the way of life that being said, the market is still majorly about BTC at the moment and I'll advise current investors and newbies to take advantage of the Mr. Arthur's copy Trading platform, a platform that handles people who lack understanding on how to maneuver the crypto space and stock market, to help them recover loss from the crash and also accumulate more positive returns, with this platform i went from having 1.4btc to 7btc in just 9 weeks. If you are interested in getting started, just send Arthur a message on What*sapp>>>>>>> +447901191306 or Tel**e**gram @ArthurFX47"
wow big drop this is unbelievable. where is isaac man
Is there any bad news? Why does FOUR drop like a stone? Is there anybody here who can explain it?
The statistics section in yahoo finance says Four's (TTM) is 1.18B. That's so far off. Four processed 1 billion in a week this past year. How can the info be so off?
"$1.3 billion in cash, price to sales ration of 4, $2 in EBITDA, FISERV takes this down along with the PAX raid, typical overreaction..."
Anyone else buying?
Why the drop today?
$100 target end Q1 2022
What the heck - step out and my stop was triggered. Out at $64.00 - was hoping for high 60's today.I'll take the gains from yesterday. Now waiting to reenter? UNREAL!
"hopefully, there wont be any more good news, otherwise this might implode."
"Shift4 , the leader in integrated payment processing solutions, today announced that October payment volume is up over 80% versus the similar period a year ago, and active merchant counts are up over 25% for the same period. While this record performance is strong across all core markets, the sports and entertainment vertical is particularly strong, with over 80 venues and sports teams adopting Shift4 software and payment services during the past several months.Despite constrained supply chains around the world, Shift4 has been able to support this growth through a wide variety of payment devices, with over 40 PCI validated devices using Shift4’s proprietary encryption. Possessing so many unique hardware certifications is central to Shift4’s integrated payment strategy: it has afforded the company significant optionality in order to meet current and anticipated demand without any disruption.“We look forward to sharing details on our strong performance during our Investor Field Day on November 10th at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas,” said Jared Isaacman, Shift4 CEO. “In addition to continued progress across our core markets, we’ve got some very exciting wins in new verticals, including the most significant TAM expansion initiative yet. We are excited to share more details on these notable wins, product and market updates as well as to set expectations for the year ahead.”"
Target $65 achieved. Thank you.
this all started with searchlight and secondary deal
"Shift just released a business update that is quite strong/upbeat...with a small float compared to other stocks it seems shorts and day traders are playing with it big time, unless there is something else...they also addressed their technology offering which appears to address the PAX situation head on..."
"Down 8% on heavy volume. Looks like institutions are bailing. Too much debt, too much competition, not enough good news."
Target $55-65 oh i said that already
Yahoo! has been so bad lately - especially the FOUR board. I like using http://alert-sounds.com/ now instead for my daily research.
"The company released a brief update on October payments volume, saying payments volume in October grew 80% from October 2020, while active merchant counts have jumped 25% on a year-over-year basis. But seeing as this is good news, it is unlikely to have driven the stock down.What seems to be driving the dip has to do with recent news regarding an FBI raid of the U.S. operations of the Chinese company Pax Global Technology, a maker of payments terminals.Pax sells these terminals to companies all over the world. The cybersecurity website KrebsOnSecurity reported that the FBI raid may be related to the potential role of Pax-manufactured terminals in cyberattacks on companies in the U.S. and European Union."
"OK, so anyone see that Q3 earnings landing page image on Shift 4 Website......."
