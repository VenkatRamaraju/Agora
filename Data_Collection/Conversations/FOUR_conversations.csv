Just love these investigations. Wonder who's paying these firms? Meanwhile Four is growing at a fast competition average and on the verge of leading space.
Talk about good faith and free advertisement!!!
"The FUD is real! Here is how i see it, greatest risk to CEO is launch and reentry. Launch date coincides with the options expiration 9/17(not insider trading, @mellowme) so those that got in early $30-$40 are willing to buy the insurance at $80 & $85. The OCT calls at 80 are already starting to climb. If all goes well which it will(powers that be willing), the premium they paid for the insurance will decay with the SP rise, and the calls will print to cover the insurance costs. $2.00 ish delta(difference of call/put after rise)(worst case) to buy insurance for huge amounts of money invested....anybody double check me here?"

"FOUR will be atleast $80 by next week, just watch"
So every time he wants to play space pilot we as investors can expect this. They have done nothing with 3dcart that could compete directly with shopify. Jared prefers to fly which is fine then sell the company as he is using ig as his piggy bank. individual investors he could care less about.

"Shift4 Payments FOUR: This Allentown-based company is a provider of integrated payment processing and technology solutions. Earlier this month, it reported weaker-than-expected first-quarter earnings and revenues. Investors are all the more concerned about the firm’s high valuation after disappointing quarterly results. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and has a VGM Score of D. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2021 earnings per share has been revised downward by 6 cents over the past 30 days."

Time to turn this ship North - a few weeks before earnings so hoping it can get closer to $90.00 - a nice news release on a new acquisition would be nice.
"I think this one may be the hidden gem that you will look back in two years and say, why didn't i buy more."
Four is cheap!

"My reaction to this FOUR stock slide of 15% in the past week is buy more!Shift4 Payments is on track to become one of the most important Fintech companies in the market. They've blown out expectations, especially in the last Earnings Release, while the market remains oblivious.The company continues to grow rapidly and profitably, and is led by a Founder/CEO of the highest order, i.e a visionary and superb executive with future potential at the level of Dorsey, Gates, Page, Jobs, Bezos, Hastings, etc., that is the young Jared Isaacman of SpaceX fame.FOUR is much more than a reopening the economy play. They are grabbing market share across all verticals. FOUR is a combination of SQ, LSPD, SHOP, and PYPL. Moreover, FOUR is better positioned for the future technological evolutionary landscape for finance and far more interesting than SQ or LSPD at this point.Like UPST in January, sellers will be kicking themselves next year as FOURs continued grand slams on November 3, and in subsequent earnings reports finally make believers of all hypergrowth software followers.There can't be many multi bagger opportunities in the market like FOUR. I know of none. FOUR is my #2 holding as i remain unwilling to part yet with my soaring UPST shares which i was also lucky to have purchased quietly in early January after Michael Jackson's CNBC interview got me to take a look. But today I bought more FOUR."
"Searchlight may have more in store, anyone board go to there website of listed public traded companies and pull up there ticker graphs....notice a theme? Love to know your thoughts?"
"Can't wait to see the news - take a look at today's chart by the minute - bigger sells hitting the bid - insiders, employees, institutions selling - volume up and end of Friday Friday was telling. Should have bought those puts back in the 90's."
Major wins not enough to offset threat of dilution. FOUR would prefer debt to equity but still uncertainty calls for caution. No runaway train here.
This stock is great - had sell order at $86.00 and already sold. Thought I'd be buying more in mid 70's today versus selling.
put buying now in the $75 and $70 range - big boys bringing it down - low float so they are having fun
Who wants to bet Searchlight Capital Partners selling heavy again - how many million shares did they want to sell and for whatever reason chose not to? Some large buys coming in only to be met with larger sell orders. Not looking good - would like to buy more in the 70's so holding off.
something in the works as FOUR is down to $84 premarket
Im going to grab a beer when 100+lets do this my guys!
come back in 5 years
I love talking to myself. No one argues with me. echo? echo?
This now explains why Searchlight dumped so many times just prior to earnings!
what co pre-releases earnings but not not really... and then re-announces they are releasing earnings..???.
Why up ? Any news ?
today they are buying the $70 a $75 puts - ridiculous we have to sit here and lose our value while the CEO plays pilot!
why has FOUR fallen away?most days are down now
"OK, big day today, share volume up, if entertainment and travel are rebounding in 2021 and 2022, would Imagine FOUR looking at upgrades shortly, restaurants start to recover first, then hotels and travel, timing of their public offering appears to be quite advantageous...solid cash position, new acquisition, seems a lot to like.Imagine a Square lite, but with more international reach..."
Four up almost 5% after successful lift off. Looking for another 5% after successful mission completion. October calls looking good.
Am I the only one holding FOUR?
Company is at or near profitability which is saying a lot since it took Square a decade to get there.
"Too many tech companies are fully priced at this point, so I'm looking for new blood in the form of recent IPOs: $KC, $LMND, $DADA, $ZI, $FOUR, and $QH."

Why the dump before earnings? Makes you wonder!
Yesterday was an overreaction. Hence the run back up to $84 in the last 30 mins before the close.
So Searchlight actually increased their holdings last quarter - now they decided to exit???? HMMMMMMM https://whalewisdom.com/filer/searchlight-capital-partners-lp
21% of all shares are short
Feel like I’m chasing if I start a position. Too late?
We should have new CEO who focus on business more than playing like this!

"For those who have no idea why FOUR is in a great situation right now. Their move to buy 3dcart was brilliant! 3dcart IMO is the best website builder on the market right now - tested and demoed SHOP, WIX, Weebly, Site123, BIGC, GoDaddy, you name it. 3dCart ranks with the big boys and now that FOUR bought them and is offering anyone who builds their website with 3dcart (now called Shift4Shop) will get the top plan at no monthly cost as long as they use FOUR as their payment processor. They state the rate is 2.9% plus .30 per transaction which is in line with all the players.Monthly plans at the competitors to have your website on their platforms run cost anywhere from $20 (barely selling anything) to thousands per month. Also the competitors jack your monthly rates as you sell more per year - if do you more then 400k in a year in sales you really get into pricey monthly plans. 400K is actually easy to do with an online store and we've been over 400k for many years. So offering no monthly fees if stores use their payment processor is brilliant! FOUR has been managing payments for 20 years now so it's not like it's a newbie.Only issue I see is FOUR better have access to many servers as this announcement starts to get out to website owners. Also support has to be ramped up at Shift4Shop as I would think tons of business is headed their way and they better be prepared to play with the big boys (SHOP and BIGC). I still wonder why folks like SHOP - their fees are outrageous and the one irritant with their system is customers have to place all their info (name, address, etc. into their system to get a shipping quote on the items in their shopping cart). For this very reason I would never use their system along with their crazy high fees.When you place something into a shopping cart you simply want to place your shipping zip code into the cart and see your shipping cost. Shift4Shop has allowed this since their inception nearly 20 years ago. SHOP became popular due to their advertising and got lucky with being out there in the public eye when COVID hit.So FOUR reminds me of SHOP since SHOP also has their inside payment processor. FOUR has a huge advantage since they are a payment processor for many years and FOUR has another huge advantage is that they are the ""player"" in the hotel and restaurant payment industry. All those pay at your table devices you are starting to see - think of FOUR.I would predict in a year or so many of these big brands will have their websites at Shift4Shop as well so FOUR better be building out support and servers! Offering no monthly fees for your website is going to the heart of these other players (SHOP, BIGC, Weebly, Wix, you name it) PLUS as I mentioned early 3dcart now called Shift4Shop was one of the top website builders in the market - their features are top notch and now with the support of Shift4 buying them - well it was a brilliant move by Shift4 to buy 3dcart and get into the website space!Best news as well is I bet ya barely anyone has heard of Shift4Payments - it's one of those payment processors behind the scenes yet the players in the restaurant and hotel industry know them. Buying into the website builders - FOUR is set to launch especially since IMO 3dcart was one of the top in the business. And now you have the announcement of the Space flight and all the promo that will be coming out to support that - you have Jared (CEO and founder of Shift4 and jet pilot to command the flight) hooking up with Elon to support this mission and give to St. Jude - what an awesome plan.I would also think Shift4Shop should be hiring to update the ease of building a website to allow more drag and drop features, more tech staff is needed, more support is also needed as more and more people come to Shift4Shop - it wouldn't surprise me either to see Shift4Shop relocating to a larger facility in the near future as they are going to be the disruptor in the website building space. I can only imagine the big boys over at SHOP, BIGC, and WIX wondering what to do!!!!"
Watch for upgrades. This is an off the radar payments play.
just sold for a nice little profit - we shall see what next week brings? Their debt level is keeping this stock down.
That ER report was fantastic. I have been very tempted to play this one a bit in order to take advantage of the big swings. But there is such great present and future value here i am just going to sit back and buy the dips instead of trading the highs.
problem now is only folks buying is shorts covering. If Big Man opens his mouth again about taxes next leg down support is $72.00 level.

"Not good news for stockholders. Labaton Sucharow, a nationally ranked and award-winning shareholder rights law firm, is investigating potential violations of the federal securities laws and breach of fiduciary duties claims against Shift4 Payments, Inc."
Every time this swings down I buy more. Seen too many of those low life announcements. I believe they want people to bail and lower the price for a better buying opportunity for biggies.
I like that premarket head fake. having the stock down by $1.30Relax and enjoy this ride. I not re-assessing for at least one year.

"Going to assume the new share count is 88 million, if I am mistaken, please correct me.At 88 million share count (80 million plus what was announced today, assume the Searchlite shares are dilutive) this means FOUR will have $7.59 more cash per share ($678,000,000 total) more than they have now...sure seems they are doing things well, again the Q2 pre-announcement was stellar, they have 5-star assets, are growing into even more 5-star offerings and we don't even yet know what they have up their sleeve after this capital raise.Curious what the green after hours is about, but we will take it..."
"Not wise to have a CEO of a company jet off to space - places the stock at a high risk - anything should happen, well?? So every time he wants to go up which could be quite often, we have to sit and wait to make sure he makes it back??"
I wish they would utilize shift4shop (bought out when it was 3dcart) Really nice program and they seem to be letting it languish - never hardly any users on their forums and it just seems like they are not placing the energy into it. Program could compete with SHOP and they should really be pushing the no monthly payments more if you use shift4shop as your payment provider.
"FOUR: Shift4 Payments sees Q2 revs above consensus (92.33)Co issues upside guidance for Q2 (Jun), sees Q2 (Jun) gross revs of $345-350 mln vs. $292.07 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Net Income of approximately $3.5 million to $4.5 million.Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $43 million to $45 million."

There is a floor and a ceiling to the settlement price for 4 tranches of stock to be settled in mid-2024, that is when the tax bill will come due.There is no dilution of shares but the stock likely stays under $85 for a few days...Someone bought $85 puts for settlement this month prior to the deal being announced...if any of this is incorrect, please correct me.Looked this up and there is precedent, it has been done previously but the IRS doesn't like it, but apparently they haven't stopped the practice.Doesn't change my outlook for the company, staying long for the long haul..."

In my opinion and especially in my portfolio this stock is the most UNDERVALUED. With only 6.4b market cap it is being sold atleast -80% discount. I feel really bullish about this one. Holding the bag with many shares
Someone knows some type of insider info as this stock is getting crushed lately?? Anyone find any news out there?? You'd think by the way the stock is reacting that JI is stuck in space.

I hope everyone saw this coming. Early positive earnings release followed by secondary offering is an attempt to keep price up before dilution. Manipulation?
"Noahlotyo's plan for higher silver. PREMISE: Most winning traders are short premium, and think they are geniuses for winning 98.8 percent of the time. BUT NOT THIS TIME!! So we simply show these geniuses THE GREATEST MARKET TRUTHISM, which is true of options as well as stocks. ""HE WHO SELLS WHAT ISN'T HIS'N BUYS IT BACK OR GOES TO PRISON"". WHOA!! If you want to squeeze the SILVER price, Buy up all the SLV puts and calls, especially out of the money calls. Then buy all the underlying but only 100 percent paid in full SLV shares. Then buy all of the out of money calls on the few mostly silver Miners, THEN make certain any silver miner Shares are 100 percent for paid in cash. Then you become friends with any big silver futures traders and show them HOW NEEDLESSLY the Commodity exchange and all stock exchanges HAVE BEEN ENOURMASLY SUCCESSFUL in keeping the price low. First convince the truly bullish silver commodity community to get rid of all futures that you they have on margin. THIS IS WHAT THE HUNT'S TAUGHT ALL OF US IN 1980. YOU MUST BE IN AS MANY SILVER FUTURES PAID IN FULL BY CASH. This may mean a short term drop in silver, and in any drops BUY AS MANY OUT OF THE MONEY CALLS AND PUTS. SO we are long SLV, Large silver equities, and long futures. THESE MUST ALL BE PAID FOR IN CASH. Next we own out of the money calls and puts in The Miners, SLV and in 2 month silver calls. All at once. the word gets out that 1) there are rumors the future traders are going to call in all of their futures/ taking delivery that is. 2) Then there is as buzz that SLV traders are going to take delivery (assuming minimum ""call provision"" )YES. THEY DEMAND DELIVERY FOR WHATEVER THE SLV'S Prospectus states. Then the word comes that all equity longs, and the smaller SLV LONGS are making phone calls to the respective brokers with THESE Instructions: DO NOT LOAN OUT A SINGLE SLV SHARE, AND STOP lending my shares in miners) and I mean NOW!( there may have to sign papers signed. The reason the Hunts got it up to $80 in 1980, was their BUYING ON MARGIN. Here is a BIG TIP. Regional Exchanges do (or did) REGULATE themselves ..including setting margins. So when the silver traders were BROKE they had a meeting raising OVERNITE the Hunt's margin, Which the Hunt's could not meet and silver's low got to below $four. THIS IS WHY WE ARE GOING TO DO THE HUNT'S IN REVERSE, using the Army, air force, marines, navy and SPECIAL OPS. I have wondered for years why a Bill Gates did not have some phone doing this. BUT LIKE OUR NEW AMERICAN WAR CRY, we can do unimaginable things. Together, LETS RUN SIVER TO $150. If it bombs (we do have our puts- why I recommend them?"") It is all part of stripping the ""short premium guys even less to buy premium wise. I have trade 35 years, ALWAYS LONG VOLATILITY, losing in two years. Our enemies win 98 percent, clueless that when that one guy rolls sixes after sixes , THAT IT JUST CANNOT HAPPEN AGAIN! yeah, right. Long today USAS, USEG and HUSIF!! Being Long , having paid for everything in cash, with not a single short derivative IS DELICOUS!!"
Bad news incoming?
"NEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / August 12, 2021 / Labaton Sucharow, a nationally ranked and award-winning shareholder rights law firm, is investigating potential violations of the federal securities laws and breach of fiduciary duties claims against Shift4 Payments, Inc. (NYSE:FOUR)."
$50 yet?
"It looks like longs are buying insurance policy with puts. Nothing wrong with that. A successful mission, which I think this will be, will put four back on track to 85+."
Nice day for FOUR today - looked like someone knows news is coming out in the next couple of days? No reason for it to spike over $90 - next week will tell. We need to break through $90 and hold it so we can continue to $100
$two $three $four
Thought this would open at $40 pps. Good buy right here..
"Outstanding quarter, increased guidance for the full year, approximately $2 per share EBITDA, looking very good!"
"Before the market opens next Tuesday, the July report on retail sales will be released — and the numbers could be ugly. Data from Bank of America Global Research published Thursday suggest the Census Bureau's report on retail sales will show a 2.3% decline in July from the prior month. Current Wall Street expectations are for sales to decline by a more modest 0.2%, according to data from Bloomberg. In June, retail sales rose 0.6% from the prior month, and May's data was revised higher as well. ""Total card spending [in July] was down 1.3% on a month-over-month seasonally adjusted basis,"" wrote Bank of America economists, led by Michelle Meyer. ""Slicing the data further, retail sales ex-autos was down a more notable 2.4%."""
Anybody getting into the 2nd offering???
"Stock is still overvalued at current price 69.50. Too much competition, too much debt, too little promotion. I still believe in this company but the value is in the IP and the customer base. Makes sense for this company to be swallowed by a whale."
Ya. Even when you post a Yahoo news item they most often delete it. Very confusing.
"Hey! Congrats to breaking the 100! Who was going to sip the wine when that happened? Took a bit longer than we thought, but just the same, it happened."
"Wow it appears they sold too soon!There are not many fintechs with single digit price to sales ratio and also have a large established base of business. Don't know where Mellow Me lives but restaurants and bars here in North FL are busy, yes they are looking for more help, but everyone is getting served because folks are moving away from union/socialist Dem states to free, open for business states."
surpasses billion weekly payments and stock instantly drops
Four is gold!
Heard rumors. Buy out walking near by
should you invest in this space?
$55-65 might be a good entry point
wow market is up huge and this red...
"BOA reiterated Buy with PT of 110, Evercore reiterated overweight and raised PT to 108 from 101. I'd say today is a complete overreaction. Form 4's in a few days will show if searchlight is the culprit of the dumping today."
So Searchlight is sold out - another insider is selling - just watch the volume and big blocks selling at the bid.
I already lost 2000 euros in that stock.
Just hang in there ! It’s up.. the QR Code Contactless Payment FOUR developed is fit for Covid-19 prevention. 
It seems to be getting more and more comfortable crossing that $100. line. soon we will test $110.Then who knows what happens.
I feel like there will be an inverse relationship to the directional travel of the ship on wednesday as well as Saturday or Sunday when they land :-)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyG1p3X1l74
raised enough with note offering they decided not to offer the shares for sale
"I'm worried about some of the questionable accounting in their ER, but I'm cautiously long. Namely because HQ is up the road and I want them to be good for the local economy lol."
There is something I don’t understand about this company
Searchlight just sold a bunch of additional shares. How many times have they sold in the past month or two??? Thinking double digits. If they keep selling FOUR will be back in the $60's. May explain the put options and the short interest spiking recently - insiders doing their damage.
Why is the stock down?
"It doesn’t take much to move this thinly-traded stock - up or down. With economy reopening and earnings coming up, the glass is half full!"
Does anyone know that INTEL buy shares of SHIFT4
"With economy opening up, momentum keeps building. Strong buy!"
"Great stock, what are chances of being taken over?"
"Too much competition, too much debt. CEO not focused. Value is in IP and customer base. Takeover candidate?"
Gonna blow the doors off next Q? To the moon Alice! To the moon......
Like to deal in facts but I have to say the price action here suggests some big players might be joining us small guys...
"Searchlight needs to STOP selling - here's some info. from the market as a whole - watch the insidersThe insider Sell/Buy ratio is calculated by dividing the total insider sales in a given week by total insider purchases that week. The adjusted ratio for last week dropped to 20.75. In other words, insiders sold almost 21 times as much stock as they purchased."
"Once this is a $30B market cap stock , shares will be trading at $355 "
You buy this & you don’t sell until it’s market cap is over $100B Thank Me Later
$75 yet?
Read their full history.https://www.shift4.com/wp-content/themes/shift4/assets/pdf/S4P-Company-Timeline.pdf
four pre-announced earnings so there shouldn’t be any surprises. No runaway train here. Just a slow ride with more dilution acting as a brake.
"Edgar SEC filings after hours yesterday Searchlight Partners sold 926,000 shares at average price of $90.89 - I would say about 25% of their holdings. They sold on 3/16/21"
He needs to step down to play space pilot - too much impact on the stock price. Stock price also impacts financials of his company. Launch window is later tonight and we flounder for 3 days until we see if it can land. How many people will say no thank you and buy another stock with less risk??Potential with the company but not as long as he puts his desires elsewhere - need someone else running the helm of Shift4
once market collapses shortly this will drop 50% or more..
FOUR is heavily processing for restaurants and retail stores. All opening quickly with temps over 60 degrees. Human behavior is all that matters.
not enough gas on this stock and it's still performing
https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200624005276/en/Visa-Launches-Small-Business-Hub-Entrepreneurs-PutHere’s a good news from Visa with Shift4 Payments in partnership.
Major collapse before earnings suggests institutions bailing. Where are the cheerleaders?
"Just watched the video on their site. Honest question: Why aren't the longs worried that the industries they primarily serve are hospitality based (hotels, restaurants, resorts, etc.). Does that not portend a huge drop in revenue for the foreseeable future? Not short the stock' not knowledgeable in the stock; an honest question."
"I don’t know what I would do without the help of (http://Thetraderguide.com). Their watchlists are so well researched and help me make the best possible picks when it comes to investing. Not only do they save me time, but their advice has shown to be tried and true!"
tempted to buy more. I don't see what's fundamentally changed in long term case.
Markets have been punishing good earnings... watch out and beware..
"So now we know why they released the Q2 earnings early...guessing we won't get more clarity on this acquisition until earnings. The numbers were very good, looking to hear about Q3 guidance."
21% short float
"Four is the bigger version of when Square started.....May be a bumpy road, but long term Four will succeed.....Square started out with that card reader attachment for phones.....FOUR will be a contactless payment system dealing with big time players like hotels, casinos, stadiums, venues, and etc....Not to mention their 3d CART purchase which is similar business to shopify if that works out....FOUR is lined up for the reopen...I still like Square, but Four is a seasoned company ready for big time success"
"Sell sell sell here. Dilution offering like vrm just did.30's could happen then.This is a bad option mostly because their point of sale system setup is too complicated to learn and too time training by management.Budah, grab some nvta right now."
Just don't care...Their numbers are great and getting better all the time...
when i posted few days ago about large put position bought day prior to the announcement you cant tell me insider trading info didnt happen
"anyone else seeing this where you live. A number of restaurants (both large and small) have started closing early or even eliminated opening on days during the week. They can't get workers. Chipotle in our area now has suspended all dine in, all take out and the only way you can get food from Chipotle is to order on their app and they will bring the food out to you. Needless to say parking lots are looking empty now at many restaurants and getting worse by the week. Restaurants are already struggling and this new issue is putting quite a few in our area on the verge of simply closing down."
$55-65 Target
Looks Ready To Run 
2021? Jared Isaacman has continued to make major advancements every year with this company and i am sure 2021 will be the same. I look forward to that moment. Good luck in 2021!
"Stock has far too many debt obligations already scheduled.Could need another placement of dilution before a stimulus passes than finally reaches the average person.Zi, zoom info the major zm partner a much wiser choice, few if any debt payment obligations exist or are due."
FOUR is down 8.01% to 45.61
dead cat bounce today
"Today was exactly like a bowl of Rice Krispies.....five minutes after your pour the milk in it, drawn out over 8 hours."
Next support at $75.00 - may place an order around $68.00 since this market needs 1 good purge and you never know.
Lez go
Big deal today! 3d cart!
"What don’t we know, hospitality and leisure up 74k jobs today, yet a company grounded in hospitality and leisure gets pummeled, apparently Wall St knows something we don’t…"
Time to split this puppy. Too expensive for the Robinhood crowd. 4 or 5 to 1 should be about right.
more lockdowns will drive this lower..
Wow What is the best price to start building a position at FOUR. I am not a US citizen and never heard of them.
"$APPS is one of my favourite growth stocks rn. Another 4 are: $ACMR, $ONTO, $FOUR and $SHLS - I've covered them here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmXgr-AKZ-w$APPS is probably the best value along with $ACMR and $ONTO. $FOUR is very promising, but it's priced a bit steep and I'm a bit worried about $SHLS 's finances so I'll put those two on my watchlist. Thoughts?"
payments taking off. FOUR is a steal. lets go
110 next week? I think so...
Bank of America double UPGRADE to $92!!!!
BUY BUY BUY! this is great buy
"SHOP, PYPL, and SQ all looking rough in this market. AAPL should be $10 bucks higher and struggling. FOUR has to hit it out of the park in this market."
break $80 - $75 is next level
FOUR reached an all time high at 69.69
Keeping this. I sold PYPL way too early at 95...
Forces working to keep this down. I’m starting to see cracks in the dam. I expect 95 soon.
