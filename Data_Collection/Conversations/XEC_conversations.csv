"Gas prices are set to climb another 20 cents a gallon this summerStephanie Asymkos: Tue, July 6, 2021, 7:00 PMPump prices are climbing with summer travel in full swing with little relief in sight.Through August, motorists could see the national average rise another 10 to 20 cents, according to AAA, putting the national average over $3.25 per gallon this summer.“Robust gasoline demand and more expensive crude oil prices are pushing gas prices higher,” said Jeanette McGee, AAA spokesperson.The predictions come after U.S. gasoline demand set a new pandemic-era high over the Fourth of July, with national demand rising by 4.7%, according to GasBuddy. The national average is up over 3 cents since last week, and as of Tuesday, the national average stands at $3.12 per gallon, according to GasBuddy.U.S. gasoline demand set a new pandemic-era high over Fourth of July, with national demand rising by 4.7%. (REUTERS/Mike Blake)U.S. gasoline demand set a new pandemic-era high over Fourth of July, with national demand rising by 4.7%. (REUTERS/Mike Blake)“Gasoline demand over the holiday weekend certainly did not disappoint as millions of Americans flooded the roads for the long weekend, guzzling down gasoline at a clip not seen in years,” Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis for GasBuddy, said in a press release. “In the process, we could have set new all-time records for consumption.”Aside from demand stateside, geopolitical tensions are putting upward pressure on prices for crude oil, the raw material used to make gasoline. The meeting among the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries was canceled this week after a dispute between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates over the cartel's oil production.“We had hoped that global crude production increases would bring some relief at the pump this month, but weekend Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) negotiations fell through with no agreement reached,” McGee said. “Crude prices are set to surge to a seven-year high.""Another factor that could affect prices is the June-to-November hurricane season in the Atlantic when the U.S. crude oil market moves when there are interruptions in Gulf Coast production.For the country’s cheapest fill-up, southern states Mississippi ($2.73), Louisiana ($2.75), and South Carolina ($2.79), lead the way. The country’s most expensive gas can be found on the West Coast: California ($4.29), Hawaii ($3.96), and Washington ($3.79).“For now, with imbalances in supply and demand continuing, motorists will continue digging deeper to pay for gasoline as prices are likely headed nowhere but up until global supply starts to catch up with the surge in demand,” said De Haan.DIAMOND HANDS...HODL!IIII$CDEV $XEC $SM $MTDR $SU $OXY $MRO $LPI $KOS $VET $CVX $XOM $SUN $WLL $OAS $EOG $COG $APA $RIG"

"This is an odd situation to say the least. Everyone on this message board is upset because XEC sold to COG too cheap. However, it appears that COG sold to XEC. First of all, XEC shareholders will be just over 50% of the new company equity, not just under 50%. Second of all, Jorden is going to be running the new company.With that said, I can't possibly understand why the share swap wasn't done as 1 XEC for 4 COG instead of 4 for 1.?? That would certainly look better on the final outstanding shares count. That would leave us with less than twice as many XEC shares as there are now. I have to admit, I never saw this one coming. Not even on my radar. I have expected a CVX to buy XEC for a year now."

"Why Oil Keeps Rising Even as Other Commodities Pull BackAvi Salzman: June 2, 2021 11:09 am ETPrices of commodities like steel and corn have pulled back from the highs they hit last month, but oil has continued to climb, buoyed by signs of increasing travel around the world and new pressures on supply.Brent crude futures, the global benchmark, were trading 0.4% higher, to $70.56 a barrel, on Wednesday. West Texas Intermediate futures were up 0.3%, to $67.94 a barrel.Oil has risen for some of the same reasons as other commodities — the speed of the reopening and supply shortages in some areas.But other factors are also at play that may prolong the oil rally even as some other commodity prices have begun to decline. Morgan Stanley analyst Devin McDermott wrote in a note published Wednesday that political dynamics were likely to cap the growth in oil supply even as demand continues to rise in the years ahead.The International Energy Agency recently wrote that oil-and-gas companies would have to keep their capital expenditures at or below 2020 levels for the world to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050. McDermott expects public company shareholders will demand that companies adhere to this rule. Exxon Mobil (ticker: XOM), Chevron (CVX), and Royal Dutch Shell (RDS. A) all faced reckonings last week over their climate impacts, and the pressure will only grow.Demand, however, may not drop as much as supply — though there is a robust debate going on about whether demand has already peaked or could keep rising for at least another decade.Morgan Stanley oil strategist Martjin Rats expects demand will keep rising to 107 million barrels a day by 2033, from 100 million barrels at the start of 2020. To satisfy that increasing demand, Rats expects state-owned oil companies and private firms will have to ramp up production, and oil prices will need to rise to fund that expansion. Currently, public companies account for about half of oil supply. Prices might even have to rise to $80 a barrel to induce private companies and state-owned ones to cover the gap. Rats increased his long-term Brent price target to $60 from $50.McDermott thinks that different stocks will outperform depending on oil prices. At $60 West Texas crude prices, APA, formerly Apache (APA), Diamondback Energy (FANG), Ovintiv (OVV), ConocoPhillips (COP), and Devon Energy (DVN) look attractive, he says.At $70, those stocks still look good, as do companies with more financial or operating leverage like Murphy Oil (MUR), Occidental Petroleum (OXY), and Continental Resources (CLR).DIAMOND HANDS!IIII$CDEV $XEC $WES $SM $MTDR $FLNG $SU $OXY $MRO $LPI $KOS $VET $CVX $XOM $SUN $WLL $OAS $EOG $COG $APA"

"REMEMBER HOW THE BRILLIANT EUROPEANS WERE GOING ALL IN ON WIND AND SOLAR?Gas Is So Scarce in Europe That Coal Is Making a ComebackVanessa Dezem, Jesper Starn and Isis Almeida: Tue, June 15, 2021, 2:00 AM(Bloomberg) --Europe is so short of natural gas that the continent -- usually seen as the poster child for the global fight against emissions -- is turning to coal to meet electricity demand that is now back to pre-pandemic levels.Coal usage in the continent jumped 10% to 15% this year after a colder- and longer-than-usual winter left gas storage sites depleted, said Andy Sommer, team leader of fundamental analysis and modeling at Swiss trader Axpo Solutions AG. As economies reopen and people go back to the office, countries like Germany, the Netherlands and Poland turned to coal to keep the lights on.Europe has long been at the forefront of the battle to reduce global warming. The continent has the world’s largest carbon market, charging the likes of utilities, steel producers and cement makers for polluting the environment. But even with record carbon prices this year, low gas reserves mean burning coal -- the dirties of fossil fuels -- has become more widespread again.“Energy demand has been pretty strong in Europe and we have seen a recovery from the pandemic,” Sommer said in an interview. “Gas storage is so low now that Europe cannot afford to run extra power generation with the fuel.”The return of coal is a setback for Europe ahead of the climate talks in Glasgow later this year. Leaders of the world’s biggest economies failed to set a firm date to end coal burning at the meeting of the Group of Seven at the weekend in Cornwall, U.K.Europe faced freezing temperatures earlier this year, boosting demand for heating at a time liquefied natural gas cargoes were being sent to Asia instead. Russia sent less gas to the continent via Ukraine ahead of the start of the Nord Stream 2 link to Germany, expected later this year.All of that mean that European storage is currently 25% below the five-year average and benchmark Dutch gas surged more than 50% this year. Futures are currently trading near their highest level for this time of the year since 2008.“People thought Russia was going to book more capacity via Ukraine and that just hasn’t happened in a meaningful way,” said Trevor Sikorski, head of natural gas and energy transition at consultants Energy Aspects in London. “The market is super tight, it’s trying to get less gas into power.”Electricity demand, which crashed as the coronavirus locked down cities from Frankfurt to London, is now back. Usage in countries including Germany, Spain and the Czech Republic are above the five-year average, while demand is flat in Italy and France, Morgan Stanley said in a report Monday.With gas supplies already tight amid heavy maintenance cutting flows from Norway, utilities have turned to coal to keep the lights on. While the price of carbon is trading near a record, many have hedged it years in advance. That means burning coal could still be profitable.Generators with “highly efficient” new plants can probably manage to produce power from coal until 2023, even with high carbon prices, Axpo’s Sommer said.The G-7 recognized that coal is the single biggest cause of greenhouse gas emissions in its final communique. But the group promised only to “rapidly scale-up technologies and policies that further accelerate the transition away from unabated coal capacity.”“It’s not a great a message to be sending,” said Ursula Tonkin, portfolio manager of the Whitehelm Capital Low Carbon Core Infrastructure Fund, the Australia-based company that has $4.4 billion of assets under management in all of its funds.While it would be “fantastic” if politicians came to a deal, coal is likely to be phased out anyway by 2030, 2035, said Tonkin. “Politics are important, but you also have the economics of the transition really kicking in within that timeframe,” she said.DIAMOND HANDS!IIII$CDEV $XEC $SM $MTDR $SU $OXY $MRO $LPI $KOS $VET $CVX $XOM $SUN $WLL $OAS $EOG $COG $APA"

"Oil demand at new record as inventory rapidly declinesThu, July 8, 2021, 3:17 PMPavel Molchanov, Raymond James Energy Analyst, joins Yahoo Finance to discuss the OPEC+ meeting, demand in oil, and oil production.This is an excellent Video Transcript- I want to ask about US crude, if you think that we could see an uptick there in that production.PAVEL MOLCHANOV: Well as far as supply in the US and, indeed, just about anywhere outside of OPEC, that's not likely at all in the next six months. Capital budgets across the board this year by oil companies are the lowest they've been in decades. Maybe that will change in '22. We will find out at the end of the year.But as it stands, we're not looking for US supply or Brazilian supply or North Sea supply to pick up for quite a while. The entire industry is so fixated on discipline-- capital discipline, supply discipline. So OPEC countries have the ability to ramp production back up at their discretion, but in the US the rig count is at a level where there's just not going to be production growth in the foreseeable future.- And just last one for you here. I think this is the question that so many folks are really wondering because a lot of consumers have been paying a lot of attention to what's been happening to oil lately because they've been feeling the pain at the pump, so to speak. So let's just ask, how much longer you think that that could continue?PAVEL MOLCHANOV: Well, I'll take a step back and say that US consumers actually have it really good when it comes to fuel prices, globally speaking. Yes, of course, prices are higher than they were a year ago or two years ago. But compared to what their counterparts pay across Europe, in Japan and Australia, it's much cheaper. Even in California, the most expensive gasoline, it's cheaper.So if demand gradually recovers to pre-COVID levels by, let's say, next summer and OPEC continues to ramp production back up, we think that the price of crude, the main determinant of gasoline, obviously, will be flattish to slightly up from current levels. And it's worth pointing out, the commodity market is actually signaling that prices will go down from current levels. We disagree. We think prices are more likely to be higher, not dramatically, but maybe a little higher by the end of the year than they are today.IIII$CDEV $XEC $SM $MTDR $SU $OXY $MRO $LPI $KOS $VET $CVX $XOM $SUN $WLL $OAS $EOG $COG $APA $RIG $CVEO"

"""Market Thirsty For Oil""Thomas Hum: Yahoo FinanceThu, July 15, 2021, 11:58 AM·As for longer term expectations for energy as the world economy recovers from the pandemic, Tsakos Energy Navigation (TNP) COO George V. Saroglou said that he remains hopeful for the oil market, citing OPEC’s diligent management of the collapse in demand, continued restoration of oil barrel production levels, and a market “thirsty for oil.”“Oil demand is recovering from the monumental losses of last year. And after a strong demand growth year in 2021, experts now see a return to the pre-COVID demand levels by next year,” Saroglou said.The International Energy Agency (IEA) forecasted in June that global crude oil demand will return to its pre-pandemic high during the final quarter of 2022.

"Oil Extends Gain From 2018 High With Saudis Upbeat on DemandBen Sharples: Tue, June 1, 2021, 8:37 PM(Bloomberg) -- Oil extended gains after closing at the highest since October 2018 as OPEC+ provided an upbeat assessment of the demand outlook and the prospect of a speedy return of Iranian barrels to the market waned.Saudi Arabia’s Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said demand “has shown clear signs of improvement” as the alliance ratified an output boost for July. His Russian counterpart also spoke of the “gradual economic recovery,” with the comments driving West Texas Intermediate up by 2.1% and pushing Brent above $70 a barrel at the close for the first time since 2019.Adding further support to the market was an indication that talks to revive a 2015 nuclear accord with Iran has been delayed for now. An Iranian official said a deal is now expected to be finalized in August.Oil is up around 40% this year as the recovery from the pandemic in the U.S., China and parts of Europe boosts the outlook for fuel consumption, despite a Covid-19 resurgence in countries such as India. Global demand may rebound to levels seen before the outbreak in a year, according to the International Energy Agency, signaling a quicker comeback than its previous estimates.The prompt timespread for Brent was 41 cents in backwardation -- a bullish market structure where near-dated prices are more expensive than later-dated ones. That compares with 9 cents at the start of last week.OPEC+ ministers agreed Tuesday to press ahead with an increase of 841,000 barrels a day in July, following hikes in May and June, although the group didn’t give any hints on future supply moves. There’s reason to be cautious about the second half of the year, with the outlook dependent on two hard-to-predict factors: the coronavirus and nuclear talks between Iran and the U.S.Diplomats had hoped to fully restore the nuclear deal before Iran’s June 18 presidential elections, after which the presidency of Hassan Rouhani will wind down. An agreement is expected to result in a lifting of U.S. sanctions and an increase in Iranian oil exports, although there are varying estimate on how much crude could return to the market.DIAMOND HANDS!IIII$CDEV $XEC $WES $SM $MTDR $FLNG $SU $OXY $MRO $LPI $KOS $VET $CVX $XOM $SUN $WLL $OAS $EOG $COG $APA"
