feels like thin ice.......
"I don’t know what I would do without the help of (http://Thetraderguide.com). Their watchlists are so well researched and help me make the best possible picks when it comes to investing. Not only do they save me time, but their advice has shown to be tried and true!"
So glad to have my margin full paid for......rebalancing the 401k as the price of stocks go up......feeling good!
"When are we hitting new all time high? We all know it’s matter of time, but I guesstimate lot of shorties will cover and we’ll hit in no time!What do you think longs!Anyway I’m holding forever unless I need the money!"
"Had a nice running streak, buy low sell high repeat repeat repeat. But now this thing is lagging the other indexes. Bought at 220 hoping for a quick bounce to new highs. Been waiting and waiting. Looks like my running streak is running out. What to do? Sell for a meager 1% profit, or patiently wait for that elusive new high????"
IWM will break 230 level before SEPT guys since AUG is the best month for stock market!
"Sold near the high, lucky me. Now, try to scoop it back up near a bottom. What price is right? Any suggestions?"
Probably just another dip buy some more 
First time it has been below the 200dma since last Sept
still not time to buy
Got my cash ready.
why the Russell 2000 has been so weak for the past 6 months? why?
The P/E is still so high on this eft.....so hard to short though due to retail investors loving it.
"Led the market on the way up, now struggling while the large caps keep going higher. Go figure. Frothy trading is a sign it will drop. VIX is ticking higher every day, then know something."
I got cash and I'm waiting for the big fall. September is typically the worst month for stocks. Will we get that long awaited correction this month? Sell in May never happened. We can't keep getting lucky forever. Or if we do get lucky I'll just let my 60% stocks continue to make me money.
"Triple bottom is in, over sold, time is right to blast higher, I am all in."
We need them to pay a higher dividend in this time of mass inflation!
Buy the dip they said 
I bought some puts to hedge my portfolio. new ATH soon but today was overdone IMO.
Bear market ...... in China.
"Just scooped it up at 5% discount from where I sold it last week. I'm on a roll with the swing trading. Ok, now we need the buyers to jump in and run it up again. Or if it goes lower I'll buy some more. Either way I'm happy . So so satisfying."
"It seems that the the short attack has ended, hopefully. This could be a good entry point again."
"Posting for a friend if you do not meet the margin call, your brokerage firm can close out any open positions in order to bring the account back up to the minimum value. This is known as a forced sale or liquidation. Your brokerage firm can do this without your approval and can choose which position(s) to liquidate. just sayin"
"I loaded up all my cash little early at $224, but hey I’ll sit and wait, since this is index etf I will be on long term position for years if I have to!GLTL!"
"Again FED got in and helped poor fundamentals, all the indices have same chart same BS, this is a bull trap, they are adjusting their positions before a massive correction, unload your positions before times up. This is a serious bearish market, look at chart, it’s in clear downtrend."
Anyone buying the dip on iWM? Think we are all waiting to see if breaks down in this trading range. Should be interesting to see if iWM capitulates
Wow! A lot of corruption going on and a lot of people buying PUTS on IWM...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XEtb2vM8cc
"Short comment on #AMC. Short's managed to get AMC off the NYSE Threshold list last Friday, not clear exactly how this was done but looks like exposure converted from Fails to Deliver (#FTD) to outright naked shorts and then packaged into the #IWM ETF. I'm really not going to waste more brain power on this. Citadel is a market marker and between them and their ""friend"" #Virtu control 80% of retail orders. They can more or less dictate price on slow volume days. Allegations of buy orders being delayed as much as 35 days through Citadels data flow. How likely is that? Hard to verify baring an audit, but it is true that dark pool trading accounted for over 65% of volume for the last 5 trading days and over 50% over the last month.Meanwhile, retail orders continue to be overwhelmingly buy oriented. The only selling is coming from shorts using the dark pools to mute buying pressure. The short-ladder attacks from last week seem to shifted to a numb inducing slow drip lower. The degree of overt manipulation is mind blowing. I am told #Citadel employs a team of psych Phd's to design price moves designed to drive retail interest away. The media attacks are clearly not working so the recent price campaign has escalated, driving it from $59 to $39 last week, a brief surge back to $49 and today's slow drip from $46.50 to $42.50 at the close. I really think Citadel needs to fire their pysch experts. Most retail is holding and bought large amounts in March. Many likely did sell a small amount in June like I did, to cover their initial investment. For example, I was long at $9.60 and sold at $53.40, enough to cover my buy in and show a decent realized gain. My remaining position is a free rider. The price could go down to $12 and many holders would still be in the money. There were 3.2 million retail holders in March, there are likely 5 million now, there has been no dilution so how are new buyers finding shares without the price rising considerably?The longer Citadel delays this, the more the final bill will grow. The #DTCC has put most of their amendments into effect, so one wonders just how much free reign the #SEC will give Citadel and the 22 other shorts before strongly worded suggestions become more forcibly made directions. I thought in March the situation was a danger to financial stability. At this point I give up worrying about it as it appears officials in Washington have no clue the damage being done. If nothing else, the failure of officials to reign in Citadel all the while the stock is under a huge media spotlight will undermine confidence in the fairness of the market for retail participants. Which in turn will reduce retail activity and hurt longer term profitability for Citadel. So stop with the games and get on with popping the cyst."
"$IWM $QQQ green pre-market, do we finally see a bounce here?"
We told these companies to raise their dividends! They have failed us! Inflation!
"Honestly it bounced very quickly last 2 days, and we’ll expect a pull back! I think it should build a support at $210 to $215, we might test $210 again! We’ll see!If you have a good profit I would sell, otherwise hold it forever!!"
"Pretty quiet today, hope y'all haven't been cleaned out by the choppy trading."
The IWM train is about to leave the station. Get on before it hits New all time highs.
I hope this thing turns around at 214 support
The secret of your future is hidden in your daily routine. Successful people do daily what the unsuccessful only do occasionally
"it bounced at $215, Bullish formation for the coming week."
It’s so cheap at the all time high. Only up 60% since Election Day. Chase it because the upside is infinite.
IWM about to drop through the 200EMA any day now. Look out below... Predictable small bounce at 208 and a couple of other times on the way down. Still needs to fill the gap way down to 165. That would be a decent buy level.
"Lots of headwinds. On the other hand lots of tailwinds. Which will win out? I'm up to 40% cash in case the headwinds win, and 60% stocks in case the tailwinds continue. Whatever happens let it happen. I'm ready."
