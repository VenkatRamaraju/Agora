Ex plane how this low div payer skips past a market melt ? WOW
All the CNBC bobble heads were predicting a 10% drop if the dems won - I guess not !!!
The time to raise rates is now! $QQQ $IWM
"Where does the incessant bid under these markets come from? Feels like I’m the only one who needs to sell something to buy something new. The fed balance sheet hasn’t really grown since June according to their website although I suspect they’ll be needed for the $2.8t the govt plans to unleash. At some point this is all reflected in the stock markets trading over $40 trillion and over 2x GDP. At some point the economic output of the US private sector needs to justify the markets up here rather than just the government spending and people not paying rents and mortgages and daycare costs. Maybe people are lining up to buy $50,000 Tesla’s and peloton bikes and luxury vacations and second homes but the math doesn’t really support it"
time to bail
"Well i am new here, but shorting this for so many reasons. Wanted to start in March, but have feeling the drop is more imminent than I thought"
"When are we hitting new all time high? We all know it’s matter of time, but I guesstimate lot of shorties will cover and we’ll hit in no time!What do you think longs!Anyway I’m holding forever unless I need the money!"
Russell resembling the Nasdaq in late August. Correction coming.

Way to frothy in short term I would suggest taking some profits here.
"Other indices UP (FOR NOW), IWM DOWN......you are seeing a triple top.....Market Reality, Agree or Disagree: In the scheme of things, we have only had a 4.7% “mild” correction since last October’s high discounting this rally of course. The following details provided are proof, in my opinion, that we have been buoyed by a false premise. From a technical perspective this is not really a bear market, yet. Last December was a fear reaction created by the Fed. We’ve had a Fed printing liquidity driven market for nearly the last 10 years. When the market thought that was all over, this sparked the sell-off. In reality, interest rates are really not all that high. This is about liquidity, pure and simple. So far, the China trade situation and government shutdowns are diversions from the truth, and have been non-factors since last December. If China really does become a “big deal”, this will prolong the upward bias, short-term (3 months). If you can picture a see-saw or scale with buyers on one side and sellers on the other, if both are participating in the market action, you have relative balance. Presently, there are no sellers which explains why volume has been lacking. This is also demonstrated and supported by volume equity put/call ratios. Furthermore, companies are using the “cheap money” to buy back stock, falsely inflating valuations, to offset negative earnings impact and negative forward guidance. Factors such as market valuation, legitimate monetary policy, ISM numbers, corporate earnings, and forward guidance that could be considered counterbalances have been completely set aside. If balance is ever restored and counterbalances ever re-considered, we will re-visit at a minimum, the Dec lows again. Once this happens, the effect of margin debt un-winding could bring us down to much lower levels if triggered. Until then, this party will likely continue. Technical analysis is not valid here because there is no balance. However, a blatantly obvious head-and-shoulders pattern is staring us right in the face. (2/18’, 10/19’, present day). Artificial liquidity and behavioral economics continue to guide this market along with the following cognitive biases; “Optimism bias”, “Bandwagon effect, “Ostrich effect”, and the “Focusing effect”. Without some random “fat-tail” distribution event out of left field occurring, this is what we can expect going forward. Trade with caution. To be continued…"
The P/E is still so high on this eft.....so hard to short though due to retail investors loving it.
"There must be some sort of mistake. IWM appears t be DOWN! How can that be?? The economy is the best it's ever been, so stocks should do nothing but go up!"
"From a standard deviation perspective you are looking at a bell curve where the Russell in the last two months has run in the 99th percentile. In other words, if a baseball player's average is .250 and he gets on a hot streak batting .400 for a couple weeks that only statistically happens very, very rare 1% of the time . 68% of all occurrences occur 1 standard deviation on either side of the average. We are so overdue for a reversion back to the middle, which at how frothy it is now, would be an extreme drop."
The markets are all overbought and overvalued. The big bubbles are going to burst very soon.
PUMP those assets up Central banks....it's the only thing you can do to save the world economies from the massive debt they are in!!!!!!!!
Robinhood continues to buy I continue to sell to them lol!
First day in more than six months that iwm is green and spy is red. Houston we’re ready to launch!!!
It has been a good run.....cashing out some more today.....
"With regards to revenues of the 50 biggest components, I’m didn’t include PFGC which does nearly $30 billion of revenues and doesn’t earn any meaningful profit the other names earned annualized sales based on Q3 of around $100b with the largest contributors being LAD, BLDR, BJ, and EME. These four companies which are basically low margin distribution companies make up nearly $50 billion of the $100 billion. The remaining 45 components combined basically did $50 of revenue and are collectively worth around $380 billion hence trading at an average price to sales of an outrageous 7.5x sales. Many IWM trade north of 12 sales including names such as FOLD, HALO, PACB, NVTA, NEO, EDIT, APPN, VRNS, NVRO,LSCC, BEPC, QTWO, BL, NVAX, ARWR, NTRA"
we have know this thing was bloated for a while. Many of us made more money than we could ever dream of! it was awesome. Now we take profit and enjoy! Margin paid off living free!
"When the snowball starts going downhill from a parabolic move up like this, it will turn into an avalanche very, very quickly."
"SAVA is a game changer for this ETF, Xmas morning tomorrow!"
"Hey PALADIN why so confrontational? We're not all shorts, day traders, fomo, yolo, momo or whatever you want to characterize people as. I was just stating the facts, the Russell is overvalued in terms of earnings and market cap, earnings now stand at -36 P/E, that's correct, negative. Now I understand the future prospects of some companies in this index, but I'm just not naive enough to believe it's components can turn things around in the next few years to justify these valuations, maybe I'll be proven wrong, but I won't put my hard earned money on it. This euphoric behavior can go on much longer then most of us expect, without making any sense, that's what manias do. No need for me or anyone else to get in front of a freight train when its full steam ahead, either you get on board, get out of the way or wait to it derails. Inevitably it will derail at this speed, it's just hard to say when or what catalyst will trigger it. So in the mean time I'm having fun watching all the speculative juices flowing. I'm all cash for now and happy with my fractional interest earned, neutral. Have fun!"
We need them to pay a higher dividend in this time of mass inflation!
"""This is the simple reason you can't believe the P/E ratio for the Russell 2000 right now. If you want the real P/E for an index, you NEED TO INCLUDE THOSE COMPANIES THAT ARE LOSING MONEY. (doh!)If you answered wrong you're in good company. The two incorrect P/E ratios in my quiz come from very reputable sources: The 17.5 ratio comes from Morningstar's reporting for the iShares Russell 2000 ETF IWM. The 14.1 is what iShares reports for that same ETF.Both numbers are significantly below the index's long-term average for the P/E ratio.The reason these two firms report such low P/E ratios is that THEIR CALCULATIONS EXCLUDE FIRMS THAT ARE LOSING MONEY. In many years, this exclusion has little impact. But not now, since a significant percentage of the small- and mid-cap firms that are in the Russell 2000 index are losing money. By excluding those firms, the calculations ARTIFICIALLY make the small- and mid-cap sectors APPEAR SIGNIFICANTLY UNDERVALUED.In the large-cap sector, in contrast, the prevalence of unprofitable companies is lower, but still not insignificant. Notice from the chart from 10% of the companies in the S&P 500 SPX have lost money over the last 12 months.The reason that the Russell 2000's trailing P/E is meaningless is that companies in the benchmark collectively lost money over the last 12 months. As Deluard put it, ""the 'real' P/E is meaningless with a negative denominator."" Don't try to wriggle out from underneath this conclusion by shifting your focus to ESTIMATED EARNINGS OVER THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. DELUARD SAYS THE RUSSELL 2000'S FORWARD P/E CURRENTLY STANDS AT 132.""$IWM $SPY $DJI"
"Oscillators back through the roof again, overbought territory. Major pullback coming. Listen to Bubbles and see my past predictions, always right. just like trump."
"I was hoping for a small pullback before Christmas but looks like this will grind higher given all the perception around Stimulus, elections, Fed Monetary Policy, and seasonality. Well nothing wrong with making money by following the price action but this rubber band is stretched. We will get a pull back I suspect but we may have to wait for a few days or weeks. Crazy! Be careful at these heights."
"I’ve now analyzed slightly over 100 of the biggest names in iWM. These approx 105 names represent approx 20% of the index and they are collectively worth around $700 billion or $7 b billion on avg. these 105 stocks by my estimates trade just under 7x sales, over 120x earnings and at a price to book value in the 20-25x range. These valuations are more than double the S&P 500 and NDX indices. I firmly believe the IWM has 75-80% downside at the current level. Just my two cents but at some point the Fed will need to recalibrate away from suppressing interest rates to influence asset prices towards funding the fed govt running budget deficits."
"Posting for a friend if you do not meet the margin call, your brokerage firm can close out any open positions in order to bring the account back up to the minimum value. This is known as a forced sale or liquidation. Your brokerage firm can do this without your approval and can choose which position(s) to liquidate. just sayin"
So glad to have my margin full paid for......rebalancing the 401k as the price of stocks go up......feeling good!

"Michael Wilson, Morgan Stanley’s chief U.S. equity strategist, said he was “a bit leery about the fact that small caps have become a perceived safe haven in the event of trade conflicts,” and that this “perception may now be overpriced.”"
"$QQQ $IWM I think it's quite odd the talking heads on CNBC/ Bloomberg point to ""daily"" Covid 19 data as a barometer for daily complexion and directionality of the markets, without any regard to the 3-10 day lag in the data. Those who've been tested complain of having to wait 3-10 days to discover their prognosis. In essence, today's headline figures are yesterday's reality. It's possible the curve will flatten 3-10 days before the headline indicates."
"Russell's actions today almost guarantee we will break through 200 day average this week, and go at least a few percentage points below it. These interest rates will continue to slowly rise through at least December. Could see 3.40% on the Ten Year by end of month!!!"
"$CBAT thank you lord for helping us to break the 5 resistance and ESPECIALLY for helping us to stay green on a very RED $IWM day.We all humbly come to you and ask for your continued help and guidance and strength. I know there are many people here who have been bagholding for months and please help them to stay strong mentally and emotionally and please, please reward us all with big gains in the next month. Lord, we thank you for the gift of life and ask that you help those in need. In Jesus’ name, we prayAMEN "
A bit strange that the Fed came out with bank buy backs when they could have saved that ammo for a bit later given the stimulus is about to be passed. Something is going on that we do not know yet.. They are throwing everything at the market to prop it up all at once.
I no longer have the FOMO.

strong dollar should be good for stocks that don't really earn any profit
Has anyone tried to quantify how long this massive short squeeze in IWM will go on for. For example I am reading short interest is at 29% so almost 1 of every 3 shares of the index is short BUT then there are also massive shorts in the underlying names. It appears to be getting stretched but I'm afraid that one compounds the other and pushes this ETF towards 275-300 before it settles down. Anyone have any smart thoughts please
Tell you shorts take some profits. Not saying close everything but IWM is frothy for short term: day or two.
The bulls might have just been trapped in the short term. Let's see what happens overnight.

"Fall, fall, fall. The cheaper, the tastier. "
"Another decent article on bubbles from Bloomberg today. I’ll agree SPY and QQQ are overvalued. I just would not call them bubbles. At the end of the day most of the companies in SPY and QQQ are profitable and they do buyback stock and bring share count down. They all have pretty sophisticated board of directors and most of these companies will benefit from a weak dollar. iWM on the other hand has most of its components losing money, issuing stock hand over fist, have board of directors that care more about their stock options than the shareholders and yet still trade with valuations of around 10x book value and a ridiculously high price to sales ratio. Why on earth didn’t Bloomberg mention the Russell 2000 as this is truly where the bubble is. IWM has increased way more than the index lets on when you realize companies like PLUG have doubled their share count in four years as the company’s losses have gone up $400mn in four years selling fuel cell systems which is a technology that has been around for decades and decades."

"Honestly it bounced very quickly last 2 days, and we’ll expect a pull back! I think it should build a support at $210 to $215, we might test $210 again! We’ll see!If you have a good profit I would sell, otherwise hold it forever!!"

"This week should turn full parabolic skitzo bipolar boomerang ditch digging widow maker. Hope, if your not heavily liquidated you are well backed up by some inverse ...."
"The 50 largest components of IWM have Q3 annualized earnings by my estimate of only 3 billion dollars with the largest contributors being LAD, ESNT, and BJ which each earn around $500mn annually base on annualizing the most recent quarter. This means the remaining 47 components combined earn a measly $1 billion and basically trade at 400x earnings. To put it in perspective, MUFG of Japan has probably earned $30 billion of comprehensive income due to the performance of MS and it’s $60 billion stock portfolio. The stock trades for 2x that amount at $60 billion market cap."
Bias still up more than likely will continue to grind higher at least today and next day. If you are expecting a pullback not likely to happen this week. You will just get frustrated if you look at the market the next two days: will be a grind higher. Risk of going long at this point for the next week (rest of this year) offers a possible 1 or 2 % up side while a risk of an impulse lower 5 to 10% without warning. If you are up this year well probably hedge if you are still long. It will be interesting next week cause it does feel like there will be a lot of profit taking once this month is over. I wonder if those retail guys might take profits next week regardless of having to pay taxes for gains they had this year. It might be smart to front run the profit taking in January regardless of tax timing. We will see.
"Manipulation, sell and buy sp500, this is worthless index."
IWM touched around $170 pre-pandemic when the economy was doing pretty good. It's almost 30% higher now with things not so great. Something's gotta give at some point.
I heard about IWM the other day on (http://Multistockalerts.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
Stocks take the stairs up and the elevator down.
"$ATOS: we are waiting for news, I hope they announce it soon, just we had an update regarding K-8, pay attention to it, FYI: $QQQ is neutral to bullish, and this is good for us. I expect a green day tomorrow for Nasdaq, around .50%$SPY looks bearish, as I mentioned yesterday it dropped from 393 to 389, huge sell-off, and If I be right, it's just the beginning, tomorrow I expect it bounce up to 391-392, and then fall to 389 and lower key levels, $IWM is bearish so if you have small caps, be cautious, I prefer to close them because hedge cost for small caps is too much, I prefer lose some gains and be on cash, I expect it IWM hits 215 and 212,DIA: Neutral. these are just my ideas, could be wrong 100%. good luck"

why the Russell 2000 has been so weak for the past 6 months? why?
No stimulus at all. Black Swan is coming. The markets will be hit hard. Better sell now and take your money.
"17% of IWM's holdings are financials which is quite alarming given that banks currently hold billions in loans in retail stocks(12% of holding) that are teetering near bankruptcy.

The Fed has talked for ten years about the risk of staying at the zero bound for too long. The risk is obvious and it’s here! Bitcoin Tesla and IWM are what happens. No one wants to go on CNBC or Bloomberg and say sell stocks now. They all say not yet. Valuations are stretched but no sell off yet. I’ll gladly say go to cash and sit tight. Get out of tesla iWM Bitcoin. focus on stocks with predictable businesses paying dividends. You’ll be far better off in 12-18 months.

Good to hear Bank of America peddling small caps on Bloomberg this morning and yet they didn’t even mention one small cap to buy. Is it that hard to name one stock? These analysts are paid millions to sit at a desk all day to come up with trade ideas for their best customers and then guide the rest of us along. Smart money gets in first and then the rest of us are supposed to follow like lemmings. Just look at Bitcoin and ARKK as proof. Bloomberg could ask what names these analysts would buy with their hard earn money so the rest of us can see how full of it they really are. There are cheap small cap names out there but you really need to search for them. Overall many small caps have dim chances of achieving sustainable profitability and will likely result in huge losses for investors getting in late

"Yet again the muppets saying the Russell 2000 underperformance of the past few years is about to reverse. If these analysts took five minutes to go analyze the companies that make up the IWM they would see companies that have issued massive amounts of stock particularly in the biotech space and the companies blew all the cash they raised. Share counts have exploded so if you factor in market caps, the russell 2000 has dramatically increased over the years. Mirati has increased share count nearly 100%. So has PLUG. So has RARE.

1st Gap below is target next week. 2nd large gap december traget
If the economy is so good why would small caps take the brunt of the hit?
The negative comments continue. Why not invest elsewhere instead of continuing the fomo posts?
LOL so what if they might pass a Stimulus: already should be baked in. So what if vaccines coming: already new that. We are close to the Big guys pushing to sell signal: not sure if within days or maybe they will wait for more of a melt up and pull the trigger maybe after the 26th. The Trend is your friend until it is not lol.
IWM about to drop through the 200EMA any day now. Look out below... Predictable small bounce at 208 and a couple of other times on the way down. Still needs to fill the gap way down to 165. That would be a decent buy level.
"complete nuttyness. only being pushed up because people are running from tech and the nasdaq for their life, when will it set in that this index is NOT a value index. it's an index with negative earnings, the MOST speculative stocks in the market belong to the R2K. BIG CRASH EVENT HORIZON.... B U B B L E....."
Got my cash ready.
"Chicago PMI declines to 59.5 in February vs. 61.1 expected......but sure, rally the futures on the stimulus bill passing the house everyone was fully expecting since it was announced."
"According to the WSJ, as of 7/31/20 estimated price to earning ratios for the next twelve months:S&P 500 at 25.45x earnings (historical average is 15x)NASDAQ 100 at 31.12 times earningsRussell 2000 is at 110.01 times earnings! Who in the world would pay that? There's way too much free money in the hands of the inexperienced. This needs to end. When people finally realize that the Russell 2000 is triple what it should be, it will come down hard."
with a very high expense ratio how long before you have to pay them to own the stock!
IWM will break 230 level before SEPT guys since AUG is the best month for stock market!
"Sold near the high, lucky me. Now, try to scoop it back up near a bottom. What price is right? Any suggestions?"
"$IWM $QQQ green pre-market, do we finally see a bounce here?"
"Sector rotation is about to start guys, big boys will dump travel/leisure/NAS stocks into small cap stocks. Watch!"
Probably just another dip buy some more 
"the R2K is the most overbought it's been since inception, over 22 years. SMART money is expecting a 25% pullback. They already made their money and are heading to the exits. Bagholders beware."
yes it is green!

looking for 151 gap fill to short here
"2021, SP from 3700 to 4400 , IWM stays the same at $218. really? ???"
Good to see Mike Wilson of Morgan Stanley coming around to seeing how overvalued IWM truly is. I certainly question his P/E of 34 times earnings for IWM. That number seems too low to me. I’m around 50-60 times if you includes negative earnings and weight the individual name P/E’s rather than applying a simple arithmetic mean. I’m sure the FED will attempt to save the day tomorrow. Let’s see if it works. The fed isn’t done in its quest to provide unlimited cheap money to hedge funds to make more billionaires out of them. I’m sure these hedge funds will hire all the central bank employees as a thank you when we finally realize how this group of academics has truly screwed things up to the most spectacular epic colossal level and we finally fire every one of them.
"too far too fast. outpaced market, outran it's coverage. pullback inevitable."
Bear trap 
Be careful buying on margin! Not sure what margin rates are but buying IWM with a 1% dividend and paying margin rates north of 5% is math that really isn’t in your favor. I have cash brokerage accounts. No buying on margin and no options trading. Many years ago I found that my cash account consistently outperformed my margin account so I shut down my margin account and have been far less stressed out ever since.
COVID was the single greatest thing to ever happen to the Russell. I thank God every single day for COVID and all the millions who have their lives in order to facilitate the 145% surge in this index the last 9 months.
I got cash and I'm waiting for the big fall. September is typically the worst month for stocks. Will we get that long awaited correction this month? Sell in May never happened. We can't keep getting lucky forever. Or if we do get lucky I'll just let my 60% stocks continue to make me money.
"Hanging men at work, very bearish indeed. Next stop $200"
over price today
It probably would be a smart thing for the longs to take some profits here. The Big guys are waiting for the last of the Retail guys to go long before they take profits in short term: looks like we are really close to that. I suspect we have at minimum a 5% dip in short term then we will continue higher again. Like a Broken record lol. I am amazed that this Index is so high given all the junk companies in it. All the people buying etfs are kind of supporting these companies. But o well the trend is your friend.
"Russell held it together better than other indexes through FED talks, nice sign."
"The 12 largest components in IWM are collectively worth $133 billion. These companies collectively only have $1 billion of book value, the compAny with the highest tangible book value is DECK with $1.2 billion. Collectively, these companies make no money. The most profitable of the biggest 12 components is LAD. The biggest money loser is CZR. . In terms of sales these 12 companies do annualized sales based on Q3 sales of around $43 billion of which two companies, LAD and BLDR, are distributors which represent 55% of the total. Backing those two companies out, the remaining 10 companies are worth around $117 billion and only did approx $20 billion in sales thus trading a very high 6x sales. Get out of this index before it drops 75-80%."
"I’ve been day trading for years and I’m so glad I finally found (http://Thetraderguide.com). They’re pre-market watchlists cover all the latest market-moving news, and they don’t beat you down with tons of ads. Highly recommend!"
"Great Escape point here for this BUBBLE territory ETF. RSI and oscillators are EXTREMELY overbought, fluctuating in the 80's."
"look out below! Thanks for the extra room to short this in TZA next week. Make me another 60% in 10 trading days. Every analyst out there thinks this can get to under 80 considering it's SUPER high exposure to small banks and high risk small business with high debt loads considering that half of the countries businesses are on lockdown or closed right now. Look for TONS of defaults on loans. TZA can make you rich. Even if you're a permaBull, you should move over to the dark side at this point, we have a lot farther to fall."
"If it smells like a bubble, and wobbles like a bubble....it's a bubble. ""What percentage of small- and mid-cap stocks are reporting losses? I was unable to get data for the companies in the Russell 2000, but Vincent Deluard, global macro strategist at investment firm StoneX (formerly INTL FCStone), told me in an email that it’s more that 50%. I could get the necessary data for the S&P Small-Cap Index (the S&P 600) and for the S&P Mid-Cap Index (the S&P 400) via FactSet. The accompanying chart shows what I found: Nearly a third of small-cap stocks lost money over the last 12 months, and a fifth of mid-cap stocks."""
Retail Sales falling everywhere......stock market is a central bank MIRAGE and will crater soon enough.
small caps look REALLY REALLY TOPPY at this level. the slightest bad news could bring this back down 5-10%. I think I'd be selling up here. Load back up at 140.
"Led the market on the way up, now struggling while the large caps keep going higher. Go figure. Frothy trading is a sign it will drop. VIX is ticking higher every day, then know something."
"From Josh Brown: According to Jon Krinsky at Baycrest, 83% of the Russell 3k names got back above their 200-day moving averages last week, a record going back seven years to 2013. It wasn’t bearish then and it’s not likely to be bearish now. Especially given what’s happening under the surface, in the Russell 2000 small cap names. Here’s Krinsky: 'If one was worried about a false breakout for small-caps, last week’s second consecutive close above the 2018 highs should alleviate that somewhat. Furthermore, one could argue that a new bull market for small-caps is just beginning after over two-years of drawdowns.'"
You know the markets are broken when the only catalyst for a market rally is that it sold off the day prior.
Riding support level all day.Last 30 minutes will be interesting.If it collapses below $130 it's going back to the $125 Fibonacci level.I'm happy I bought on Friday and held over the weekend.Nice little profit this morning because of the gap up.Overall I still think the market will retest the March 23rd lows though.
"Days like this, good time to cost avg a short position.Markets that go up on mere comments are temporary. If anything the extreme volatility is even more bearish.Enjoy your one day win."
Wow! A lot of corruption going on and a lot of people buying PUTS on IWM...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XEtb2vM8cc
tanking again ! every day !
IWM looks very tired.....tie to buy some $172 PUTS for early October.
What a great place to deliver FTD on AMC the IWM I doubt the shareholders of IWM see any of that green that was delivered on pallets from a 747 to the fund manager for this favor.
I heard about IWM the other day on http://tradenow.xyz. It’s looking like an interesting play.
"Just Google ""Russell 2000 price to earnings ratio""."
Warren Buffet just sold out of almost ALL his financials including JPM (per CNBC)!! With KBE index a huge part of IWM....beware!
240 is coming shorts
"My broker shows that shorts increased by 3% since Monday--91 mil shares short now.So, folks are adding lots of shorts up here, which sure makes sense to me. This will likely get squeezed higher for some time, though, as we have been seeing. Price discovery is dead."
Forced liquidations at hedge funds have begun. They are having to throw out the baby with the bath water. The shorted names are going crazy while all the indexes are red. Play with house money on the casino stocks and use some profits to buy puts on the indexes.
Many of these companies borrow from outside the US. Not sure traders fully grasp the idea of a global yield curve. market forces.. more like market farces! Algo's are programed to sell on US inversion.
"IWM holding above ALL Moving Averages. Above the short, mid and long-term MA.Came 7 pts. shy of the new 52 wk high it made yesterday 6/12/18 at 167.94. Today HOD was 167.87. Technically still Bullish, and has more reasons than some of the other Indecies to run higher. MO, gut luk. I am and have been long since then end of May. "
Good to see a hedge fund blowing up for being massively levered long in nonsensical tech stocks trading at stupid valuations (versus a short S&P 500 index short as a hedge ?!?! I assume) nomura $2 billion loss from this hedge fund it seems? Question is how many other opaque hedge funds are using absurd leverage. If this is common practice to lever up big by borrowing at Libor the stock markets could get quite hairy as prime brokerages are forced to reel in client leverage following greensill and this hedge fund blowup and $2 billion nomura loss. It simply isn’t worth it to them to pick up pennies to potentially lose billions as nomura just learned. One client just wiped out a years worth of profits at nomura. I’d say they ain’t gonna get burned again. Tech stocks and biotech stocks have been trading lower as of late. Best to steer clear until the second and third shoes drops. If that never happens you’ll have plenty of time to get back in to tech stocks trading 10 15 or 20x revenuesDon’t try to catch the falling knife Know what you own and own it unlevered.
The top is close.....$190 likely.............then SWOOSH! This ETF has LEMMINGS written all over....those new Robinhood investors who don't know has FAST stocks go down.Central banks have created asset bubbles of EPIC PROPORTIONS....housing is started to turn down as well because it is so over priced!
"From FT: ""As the earnings season draws to a close, companies within the Russell 2000 stock index — the small-cap benchmark — have reported an aggregate loss of $1.1bn, compared to profits of almost $18bn a year earlier, according to data provider FactSet. Meantime, the much bigger companies within the benchmark S&P 500 index have posted a 34 per cent aggregate drop in earnings, to $233bn.""In other words, the 2000 companies in this index combined are losing money."
I’ve now analyzed the largest 350 index weightings of the IWM. the largest 350 companies make up around 42-45% of the index. On average the non-financial companies I’ve analyzed trade around 85x earnings and nearly 14x tangible book value. These 350 companies are worth nearly $1.5 trillion and the amount of capital they’ve destroyed is just incredible. Very very few companies in the IWM have positive retained earnings. I’d say 40% of the 2000 companies in the Russell are unprofitable. This constant trade idea peddled on CNBC to bet on IWM to outperform QQQ just seems insane to me. How can you bet against world class companies with enormous barriers to entry (which do trade at lofty valuations of say 30-60 times earnings) with huge cash balances and little debt while betting on small companies trading 85 times earnings on average that have little competitive advantage and huge amounts of goodwill and debt is absolutely baffling. But this is what all the “experts” keep saying on the media. They need to do their homework. I’ll remain short IWM (avg short price of $198) and sleep well having it as a hedge against my long book.
IWM calls 160 strike 9/20 in at 0.95 tried to give you a hint but you thumbed it down. Oh well.
I heard a talking head on the news say that it was a sector rotation into technology from the small caps
The $IWM January 2023 Call Options are a $teal
"I’ve now aggregated the top 50 components of IWM and the results are pretty incredible. The top 50 companies are collectively worth a little over 400 billion with PLUG and RUN being the largest market caps. The tangible book value of the top 50 names combined is around $17 billion. Of the $17 billion, the largest contributors are ESNT and SSB and BEPC. These three companies have around $10 billion of book value meaning the remaining 47 names only have $7 billion of tangible book value or they basically trade north of 50x book value."
gap fill
You do have to wonder where the US consumer has all the money to support 70% of the US economy by buying peloton bikes iPhone 12s Tesla’s online gambling home restoration hardware furniture as well as food inflation higher home costs and higher prices everywhere in pretty much everything.
We told these companies to raise their dividends! They have failed us! Inflation!
Since IWM companies generally don't have a lot of cash...won't their buybacks be limited to little to none? Seems like IWM will fail at $168....AND if it breaks the 50 day average will crash much lower.
"Wow.Seemingly unlimited Fed money and 26% short interest make this rocket up and up.Gotta try to catch some downside, someday, cause I could never buy this in the stratosphere."
No real reason to short this etf at these prices.
Well my take volatility picks up next 3 to 4 weeks. We get a little sell off but do not fall off a cliff. Then melt up middle to end of 1st quarter and rest of year.
lol they are exerting a lot of energy to Keep within a short trading range for the last few hours today: in context of low volume. Lets see if it breaks in last hour.
"I’m seeing huge blocks of $iwm getting dumped upwards of 100k blocks. Btw, got stopped out of my short today. No biggie. Next play.

It’s so cheap at the all time high. Only up 60% since Election Day. Chase it because the upside is infinite.

These companies in the IWM continue to issue huge amounts of stock thereby diluting existing shareholders and most have never demonstrated an ability to earn consistent profits or any profits for that matter
https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stock-analysis/062516/russell-rebalance-study-what-you-need-know.aspYou can short this to the bank like clockwork. Big drop next monday
I was thinking maybe the conclusion of the Senate runoffs regardless of who are the winners will result in another pop to the upside. Kind of a relief to just get things to a conclusion.

Buy some more of this dip  everything is looking up 
"Nice sale today, bought a little here. If it goes lower buy some more. Yummy yummy yummy ."
"Had a nice running streak, buy low sell high repeat repeat repeat. But now this thing is lagging the other indexes. Bought at 220 hoping for a quick bounce to new highs. Been waiting and waiting. Looks like my running streak is running out. What to do? Sell for a meager 1% profit, or patiently wait for that elusive new high????"
I’d say 2021 will be the year of insider selling for IWM. The greed that these company’s management teams exhibited in giving themselves huge stock awards and stock options over the past 5 years will be equaled by their greed to lock in the billions they fleeced from shareholders through stock sale after stock sale. Wall Street sell side firms remain complicit with these companies as the gravy train is just too huge for them to expect the whole bunch to be decent and honest. The shareholders will be the ones feeling the pain.
"Forward P/E 91.7, Russel excludes negative earnings."
Something going up really fast does not mean there is a bubble. I could see a correction like what happened to the NASDAQ recently but not a bubble burst.

I hear ya Doug. Keep in mind a lot of these iWM components have awarded them huge stock grants and stock options (similar to Tesla) year in year out and now these management teams own over 10% of the companies for free!

I’m shorting more of this IWM. Seems to track well with my longs. Difference is my long trade under 10x with clean balance sheets. These stocks are scarce as can be today. Simply aren’t many of them in the stock markets these days. As for garbage companies trading 10 or 15 or 20x sales and 20-30 times book value there are unlimited of them and lots of them are in the Russell 2000. When IWM cheerleading stops by “experts” and the financial media it’s gonna be one hell of a fall
Roughly 95% of the equities added to the index during reconstitution had more cash than debt on their balance sheet.
Selling some more off....profit taking!
Too far outside the OSC channels and showing overbought. Trend line puts it back to 158 after the impeachment later today.

Good to see IWM up 12 since Friday. Stimulus. Stimulus. Stimulus. Economy will reopen and show huge pop for certain areas of the economy. I just don’t think IWM is very representative of the reopening trade. IWM is loaded with unprofitable biotech and tech companies which aren’t going to be big beneficiaries from the reopening. IWM also has big financial exposure to mid size banks which arent going to be big beneficiaries either. Many IWM have also “stopped” going up the past few months. Could be ominous. Easy come easy go on shorting IWM but I think I’ll win in the end being short this against my longs.
LOL I could stop this uptrend by just going long.

The IWM train is about to leave the station. Get on before it hits New all time highs.
"Queue the circuit breakers. The market officially caught Covid 19! Luckily, it's chance of survival is greater than 97%. Considering the mortality rate, not sure this virus poses an existential threat to the markets or to the population at large. But markets will have to come to terms with a move from containment to treatment. Perhaps a 2%( mortality rate) reduction in federal liabilities can be seen as.. horrible to say.. wont say it. Still don't understand why this virus only impacts boomers and not children. I suspect over 50,000 people in the US already have the virus and just don't know it. Was just in contact with someone who fell sick with CV (age 60+) and he seems to be on the mend. His symptoms were: mild cough, 101 fever and chills, which went away with OTC pain relievers. Suffice it to say, he's feeling better, but mad about being stuck in quarantine for the next week. $SPY $QQQ $DIA"

"This is not investing, more like gambling, buying with no care to fundamentals. Balance sheets no longer matter, debt no longer matters, valuations no longer matter, what matters is price acceleration and the greater fool theory. This is not the case for all equities but it is the case for most stocks especially the Russell, mind blowing what people are paying for some of these stocks. I've seen some froth over the years but this is mindless behavior. The Government and the Fed are to blame, leverage is off the charts, bullishness is off the charts and complacency is off the charts. The speculation has spilled over to many asset classes and commodities, including real estate, this is not healthy for a sustained recovery. When just about everyone you run into is a market guru, boast about their recent trades and gains, that's usually a sign that it may be time to head for the exits."
Don't buy puts. The timing is next to impossible. I bought in December after a 20% rise in a month the March $185s thinking I was safe going that far out. Now we are 40% above the 200day. Just buy the VXX so you take out the expiration element if you are looking to hedge.
"R2K largest quarter in history = largest Bubble in history. So largest POP in history when this manipulated index and particularly this manipulated ETF, which actually tracks nothing at all comes back to earth. These iShares ETF's are a complete scam. They don't track any stocks in the index, they trade like a free floating vessel with no underpinning securities to them. That's why the R2K can go up 1% in a day, and this can go up 2%. They should be investigated for fraud and pumping. But when this baby starts to sell off and the smart money cashes in for EOY, LOOK OUT BELOW. Happens tomorrow, guaranteed. Nobody wants to be locked into gains with Capital gains tax increases coming this year 100%."
see ya at 75 soon...
When this gets into 203 level.....i might take a short term long position.
It is not to late to make millions! Just buy short term calls!
Still no increase in dividend. I need something that makes more than .6%
It’s nice that IWM has amalgamated all of the most overvalued Garbage stocks into one neat etf. IWM looks likes once in a decade short opportunity with the P/E probably around 150 if you include the negative earnings companies and the price to book value way north of ten times if you back out intangibles and goodwill. The most honest metric for comp purposes is price to sales with I can’t seem to find for IWM but I’d say it’s easily north of 5 with the s&p 500 approaching 3.
HUGE reversal day....open up at highs and rolled over big time! Bloomberg had a report today saying weak economic data cannot be ignored by the markets for much longer.....this is ripe for a $10 decline rapidly!
IMO the futures pop on the 1.9T stimulus passing is gonna fizzle. It’s the old adage; be careful what you wish for. 20% of the dollars in circulation have been printed in the last year alone.
"The bond vigilantes were out in full force yesterday, selling off anything and everything that had an unreasonably high amount of debt.... probably in response to the ignoramuses touting the Modern monetary theory as a rational for more government spending and larger deficits. I'm sure MMT was invented by some shill in an attempt to shift sentiment on WS and instigate the fiscal hawks. I know plenty of lugubrious fund managers and traders dissatisfied with 2019 rally, and are way behind on their short positions in $IWM. I'm not sure I follow their lead. Their theory rely's on this ""flight to quality"" phenomenon in part caused by Fed rate hikes. And, as the economy grows, the Fed should resume a series of potentially damaging rate hikes, which, ultimately serves as a headwind to many higher debt-holding small cap companies. Only problem is.. that Powell just signaled a more dovish stance moving forward. WS remains hard at work manufacturing the next reason to sell."
Why not a $4 trillion stimulus? $5? $6t? The reality is all this is doing is exacerbating the rich poor gap and the Fed and Congress know it. There are 20mn people on some sort of assistance and their skill sets are wasting away. As I stand in Union Square NYC it’s a ghost town. A shell of its former self. The only thing going on is construction on practically every other building which could all be an epic waste of time. Americans need to learn new skills and new trades. The government needs to help these individuals by opening free Vocational and skill and programming schools across the country to reinvigorate the work force with relevant skills
Good to see JPM downgrade the small caps. People investing in this space stand to lose a lot of money sadly. Most of the larger names in IWM are unprofitable or trading north of 100x earnings. Most trade over 10x book value. Most pay no dividend. And most of issued tons of stock and diluted existing shareholders. Most of these companies have done nothing than enrichen the management teams who have given themselves tons of stock options for absolutely nothing . It’s only when these stocks lose half their value that people will realize what they own in these garbage companies
"Short comment on #AMC. Short's managed to get AMC off the NYSE Threshold list last Friday, not clear exactly how this was done but looks like exposure converted from Fails to Deliver (#FTD) to outright naked shorts and then packaged into the #IWM ETF. I'm really not going to waste more brain power on this. Citadel is a market marker and between them and their ""friend"" #Virtu control 80% of retail orders. They can more or less dictate price on slow volume days. Allegations of buy orders being delayed as much as 35 days through Citadels data flow. How likely is that? Hard to verify baring an audit, but it is true that dark pool trading accounted for over 65% of volume for the last 5 trading days and over 50% over the last month.Meanwhile, retail orders continue to be overwhelmingly buy oriented. The only selling is coming from shorts using the dark pools to mute buying pressure. The short-ladder attacks from last week seem to shifted to a numb inducing slow drip lower. The degree of overt manipulation is mind blowing. I am told #Citadel employs a team of psych Phd's to design price moves designed to drive retail interest away. The media attacks are clearly not working so the recent price campaign has escalated, driving it from $59 to $39 last week, a brief surge back to $49 and today's slow drip from $46.50 to $42.50 at the close. I really think Citadel needs to fire their pysch experts. Most retail is holding and bought large amounts in March. Many likely did sell a small amount in June like I did, to cover their initial investment. For example, I was long at $9.60 and sold at $53.40, enough to cover my buy in and show a decent realized gain. My remaining position is a free rider. The price could go down to $12 and many holders would still be in the money. There were 3.2 million retail holders in March, there are likely 5 million now, there has been no dilution so how are new buyers finding shares without the price rising considerably?The longer Citadel delays this, the more the final bill will grow. The #DTCC has put most of their amendments into effect, so one wonders just how much free reign the #SEC will give Citadel and the 22 other shorts before strongly worded suggestions become more forcibly made directions. I thought in March the situation was a danger to financial stability. At this point I give up worrying about it as it appears officials in Washington have no clue the damage being done. If nothing else, the failure of officials to reign in Citadel all the while the stock is under a huge media spotlight will undermine confidence in the fairness of the market for retail participants. Which in turn will reduce retail activity and hurt longer term profitability for Citadel. So stop with the games and get on with popping the cyst."
Lets see dividend of .80% and expenses are .20.....you get .60%......you could almost get that in government bond......Bloated big time! Take the margin off!
I already paid off all my margin what do I have to worry about?
So many more put than call options on this one..
"LOL so got a small pullback in short term but the silly retail guys will take it up one more time and the big guys will let them so they can sell in mid December. Got possible tax changes next year, and year end rebalancing for Fund Mangers that may have to balance back into more Bonds. The followers will jump on selling band wagon next month once they realize this. Very short Term (day or two) bullish, short term Bearish (week out), midterm neutral, Long term Bearish."
Sooo anyone here??
"Bank earnings, possible serious civil unrest, Covid 19 & most dangerous of all is Jerome Powell foot in mouth moment at the Jan 26 Fed meeting ! 2 week window - perfect for long put trades !"
It would be comical if Barron’s top ticked the Russell 2000 with its buy the Russell call last week. Comical in the fact that they used an erroneous 18x P/E ratio to justify its call. Brilliant timing and terrible reporting. Is PENN 18x? PLUG? CZR 18x ? RUN? NVAX? RDFN? How about a mea culpa from Barron’s for its total laziness.
isn't this chart along with the spy chart way too extended above its 200 day moving average ? if you look at the charts throughout their history they always pull back towards that average to some degree or another when we get too high above or too low below it. it's as if the 200 day moving average acts as a magnet. so why isn't that happening ?
"if this closes the week green, it will go to 300... If not this may be a real correction. So far I'm still bullish. The Resistance was gapped on monday. I believe chances are it willfinish the week over 230. That would be very bullish for the short term."
"Just scooped it up at 5% discount from where I sold it last week. I'm on a roll with the swing trading. Ok, now we need the buyers to jump in and run it up again. Or if it goes lower I'll buy some more. Either way I'm happy . So so satisfying."
Tech stocks carrying the market now.....I do NOT see IWM hitting all-time highs....SHORT it at $160!!!
"Sold!!!! But just a potion in case I'm wrong. Now let them #$%$ the market with more interest rates talk so that I can buy it back for a discount. Loving this volatility. Buy low sell high buy low sell high repeat repeat repeat. Yummy yummy yummy, so so satisfying."
"Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccines Effective in Real World, CDC Says $PFE $SPY $QQQ $DIA $IWM"
"Here is why I would NEVER SHORT THIS RIGHT NOWThe index has a short interest of 26-29% PLUS some of the names in the INDEX have crowded shorts like 30-50%. On top of those technicals the top Russell sectors are very under-owned like financials at 15.5% (rates going higher) and energy (oil and gas going higher) and some play right into the Biden free money / socialism trade like consumer discretionary (13% of index), Healthcare for all (21% of index) and Industrials -infrastructure trade (15.33%)"
"It's really sad how many not too bright ""investors"" are short IWM as it continues to make new all-time highs, including today. Stay long and strong! Psst: For beginners: NEVER short momentum because of valuation!"

Clearance sale. Time to do some shopping. But keep plenty of cash for possible better deals ahead. 
"IWM wants to break down....problem with these small cap stocks is they generally cannot participate in the big stock buybacks since they don't have the cash......when investors finally realize that central banks cannot prop up asset prices forever with their scam, these stocks WILL get hurt the most.....and QUICKLY. That said, look for a strong employment report tomorrow and short anywhere at $159-$160."
It closed above 200 dma which is good but I don't know why it's lagging when even dow is going up. Some consolidation may be?
"Every chart I come up with shows reset tp between 949 and 1000. I cant believe it will be that bad but, math is a strange factor."
I'm not a small cap kind of guy anyway. Was just checking out this quote and chart because a dude on Seeking Alpha mentioned the Russell 2000 as being overlooked by peeps.
"Isn't it supposed to be 'sell the news'. Only in this market does rumors drive it up, news drives it up, bad unemployment news drives it up...."
The bulls are in for a rude awakening. It reminds me of the arrogance of the bears in 2009-2010. The script has flipped and it’s closing in on time for the masses to be flogged.Remember the pain trade;“markets will deliver the maximum amount of punishment to the most investors from time to time.
"bubbles is always right..... back to overbought, ... says chaikin money flow. Negative..... up on low volume."
last chance to escape before the POP...................... STill overbought and over priced.
lol over 200 still??

solid downturn in % of companies trading above the 50day MA. look out below
"If you look into the markets there are some gems that this ETF is missing. Plenty of super low PE companies with no debt, cash on hand, and market caps that can grow into this ETF. Here are a few I am currently blown away by based on their financial situation. They are also really sneaky, meaning no one, and I mean no one, is paying attention to them:* KLR (CPAAS company like Twilio but at a way better valuation and already a global company)* LAKE (getting back to work stock, protects blue collar workers, also has suits for Covid defense)* PLOW (Construction, building, engineering, winter/snow outfitting, and outfitting equipment for trucks and vans)Anyways, point is, there are some gems. Not sure why the current holdings are PENN gaming and Caesar’s when there are actual getting back to work names like the above.Curious to hear your thoughts."
"Lots of headwinds. On the other hand lots of tailwinds. Which will win out? I'm up to 40% cash in case the headwinds win, and 60% stocks in case the tailwinds continue. Whatever happens let it happen. I'm ready."
"One other thing...1/3 of the Russell 2000 lost money the past 12 months. It will be over 50% in the next 12 months, at least."
The great thing about Wall Street and the media is they turn any event into a buying opportunity. But when they are wrong there is no mea culpa
IWM is heading towards $230 - $235 slowly guys!Big boys will switch to mid-cap stock shortly since BIG Tech/Biotech/Banks are overbought.
"Keep being bearish, ill be happy to sell you shares at 2X the price when you're forced to cover."
So basically the US stock markets were worth $15 trillion in 2000. Now they are worth $40 trillion. Fed government debt was $6 trillion in 2000. Now over $25 trillion. US household debt was $5 trillion in 2000. Now it’s over $15 trillion. What is there to worry about with IWM trading north of 100x earnings? Seems like a good day to fade the open. Corporate tax rates are going up. That’s a guarantee
"Does rebalancing cause a surge or a drop in IWM? I read each share entering the index gets 11% increase on average, this should cause IWM surge right? And would that be on Friday or Monday?"
"Can anyone explain why the Russell 2000 is mirroring the Dow Jones?It’s been this way the last couple months I’ve been following it, and I do not understand the correlation between blue chips and small-caps, they seem like polar opposites."
The whole markets are extremely overbought and the big bubbles are ready to burst hard.
"Doubling my margin today, up up and away...Margin call? huh? where? yeahhh baby... stonk up to the MOON"
Decent article on Bloomberg about frothy markets but they failed to look at small caps which are trading with valuations well in excess of the S&P 500 which as Bloomberg notes is at a record prices to sales. iWM’s price to sales is probably double the S&P 500. Also IWM small caps are issuing stock like the ice age is coming while large caps on the whole are maintaining share buybacks.
Feels like an outstanding day to short more iWM. Of course I’ve been telling myself that since $190.
Why is this soaring on NO VOLUME
Glad I got out at the open! I told you guys to pay off your margin!
Watch out for the retail rally......they love to pay over bloated prices for their etfs!
"Guess I’ll keep trimming longs to short more IWM. Got to live the valuation gap between value and growth. Never seen anything like it. Got to love it when casinos trade 5x sales with loads of debt, when each individual shake shack is worth $20 million, when RUN and other small caps can basically raise money issuing converts or selling stock hand over fist, when PLUG gets valued on 2030 EBITDA. It all ends in tears."
Below 133.28? should those stress tests be not so good tonight? and then filling the mid May gap. Big move if so. Here's to SRTY. Technicals and fundamentals also suggest its more probably than not.
I love how CNBC brings out a short seller to tank the market further after it was slightly green. I wonder if they got a cut of the put options?
"All the Gaps below will be filled before it resumes up. Bearish short term Neutral Midterm, Bullish Long Term."
This is headed for 120 after midterms. GREAT exit point right here.
"According to the Wall Street Journal's Market Data Center, the average small cap growth stock currently trades at a whopping and nosebleed....112x earnings......Small caps need to decline approximately 30-40% to have ANY... semblance of fair and rational value, that is aligned with historical averages.....Sell or short the bubble...TZA"
Someone tell me how this bucket of bones is green ? No more reversal regardless of how much cash sleepy Jo sprinkles on the market. Up .38 in PM.
Inflation is eating up any amount of dividends on qqq and iwm plus some. Time to raise rates to help the poor. $IWM
feels like thin ice.......
Saying again....Russell 2000 index selling at 73.45 times earnings as of 7/24/2020. This is according to the wall st journal website. Nasdaq 100 sells at 32.92 times earning and people think that's overvalued!
"Did anyone catch volume today on the S&P?Avg volume : 4,996,584,745Today’s Vol. : 2,406,150,594Less than HALF avg. daily volume.What a joke!"
"If any of you are looking for a nice long term secular play check out the news on toshiba and then basically buy anything in Japan. Japanese stocks have always traded cheap based on price to book value and are all loaded up with cash and equities and real estate. If this toshiba lbo is allowed to happen by a foreign lbo shop, Japanese stocks will get bid up in a massive way. There is nowhere else in the world where you can buy stocks below the net cash on their balance sheet, stocks with huge stock portfolios. Go do some digging and get in early before all the Wall Street muppets start promoting japan"
