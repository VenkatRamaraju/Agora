Trumps veto on defense bill of $785B will effect this co. And all others!
"The LA Times article will also allow you to access via link Senator Warren's letter to Chair Khan on July 16, 2021 which sets forth her concerns about vertical integration of suppliers into fewer and fewer major military suppliers to the U.S. government, and the anti competitive effects of these mergers. Only 4 pages long, but very dense content, and insightful on where Warren wants to go with these matters. Well worth the read! GLTA"
Soaring up with good volume. Bullish crossover in MACD and Stochastic oscillator at foxchart.
"Up because SpaceX StarShip blew up on the landing? The flight went amazingly well, proving control, but the new Raptor engines failed again. Blue Origin has also been having major issues with their new methane booster, long delaying ULA's plan to replace the Russian RD-180 on Atlas V (demanded by both U.S. and Russian governments). Would be good for ARJD if their AR-1 engine development were resurrected, though unlikely due to cost. Developing a new liquid engine competently is expensive."
If $34 can hold? Should be Okay!!Fiona
Any news? Why down 3% this morning? The markets are up.
when is the earnings release date?
"$5 billion for this company seems awfully low, seems LMT is getting quite a a bargain."
Defense and national security per today’s task force so staying bullish here
Is it Intelsat Q4 causing this spike?
"wait a minute, ajrd has backlog sales 1billion plus larger than their market cap???"
"Okay, just found the news on stocktwits. They missed earnings estimates by 4 cents. Here's the rest: Aerojet Rocketdyne misses by $0.04, reports revs in-line (32.15 +1.31) Reports Q3 (Sep) earnings of $0.17 per share, $0.04 worse than the two analyst estimate of $0.21; revenues rose 4.3% year/year to $484 mln vs the $487.48 mln Capital IQ Consensus. Total funded backlog as of September 30, 2017 was $2.1 billion compared with $2.3 billion as of December 31, 2016."
Wow what a earnings report!!!Look for AJRD to acquire a company with all that cash!!!!imo...Fiona
continued ability to meet all cnc deliverables in question. Over-wrapped composites are acontinuous series of hit and miss .

Can I still buy the share and get the paying price from Lockeed Martin
They have some crazy technology. Only getting more funding from govt. I'm thinking buy
"MF article is poor , they don’t even mention all private companies involved in space launches."
"Seems like there is very little recent news, no conversation, and lots of movement on this one. Anyone know what is driving this stock to move/drop?"

Close of the deal soon

"The Los Angeles Times had an article on August 12, 2021 titled ""FTC chair urges blocking more M&A as Lockheed deal looms."" In it, Lina Khan, the FTC chair, is described as reviewing US regulatory policy re: m&A activity in the military sector, and has proposed opposing certain mergers outright, in an open letter to Senator Warren. The article also mentions Raytheon's opposition to the merger. Sorry I didn't post the link, but you can Google it. You have to disable your ad blocker to get access to the article, but you don't have to subscribe to gain access. No mention of any consequences of merger failure, or possible government remedies to allow the merger, e.g. selling off certain assets, (except in a very general sense of describing certain tools the government can use when reviewing m&a activity to allow mergers to go through.) Pretty good article though, and worth a read. GLTA"
Can’t buy anymore! Bought in at $19.90 $21.00 $28 $46 $45 twice area!Going to $70’sFiona
hard to break the $43 resistance. also following the downward trendline. could the consolidation the last 6 days be the bottom ?

Northrop was allowed to buy Orbital. Why should then the Lockheed-Aerojet deal be stopped. Northrop now has an unfair advantage. There is no reason to stop this merger.
Folks.... The buy out share price is $51. No matter what the price will be at $51 as the buy out out deal close??

Hello out there!lol

IMHO buyout coming in a few weeks. Not many number #1 companys left for a buyout in this area
Disappointing price action. Adding a bit more

"So, I have to ask. Why does AJRD management take the route of not doing conference calls (and very few presentations)? Seems odd for a billion dollar defense company. There is so much to like here. Sure seems that if they promoted the company at all it would bring more investors on board."
Were adjusted earnings 61cents??
"Without LMT I believe AJRD is highly undervalued at 3B market cap. The deal will happen it's just a slow crawl, if LMT were smart they'd start buying AJRD so it'll cost them less when the deal goes through."
What's the latest news causing it to be down another 5% today?
"Any one hearing anything on other offers? With MAXR jumping so much today, this offer just seems woefully inadequate, especially when you include the land. Where's Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos when you need them? Martin Marietta, Raytheon, and Boeing might also be good candidates."
Will buy more if it gets close $34
I’m in acquire as long as it’s beaten down like this on below avg volume? Oversold for certain. Scaling in because it could get worse! And want dry powder
I hay one question does LM get the 12 acres of Ca. Real estate.
This is a very rare gift from the Wall Street Gods….in the next month or so this stock will go up 23%….amazing it’s being overlooked…
Almost 2% jump in few minutes? Red to green in down market. Maybe there’s news coming? 1:35 pm currently
"New released of $1.8B contract to make more RS-25 ""Space Shuttle Main Engines"" for SLS, but the stock price drops 2.3%. Must have already been baked into the price."
Was there a problem with Lockheed acquiring them? I’m just confused why this has dropped so much
Aerojet Rocketdyne is up 5.97% to 42.59
AJRD reached an all time high at 42.61
so if you buy now does that mean it will definitely go up to $51
When will the buy out deal be done??
good luck
"Could it be that AJRD is retesting 34 because of Biden being up in the polls? Perhaps the thinking is that a Biden presidency will not be as aggressive with the space force. I see Raytheon etc. following the same pattern the last week or so. I'd like to buy more of AJRD here, but concerned about the aforementioned. Thoughts?"
Aerojet Rocketdyne is up 6.82% to 43.44

If we are to go off the RSI then you could argue that a pull back next day or so could occur on AJRD before rallying up. Ive been struggling with this stock lately. Some of my other trades have been from aw-esomeSTOCKS which are working out pretty well.
"Anyone out there heard any news on the proposed merger? I just checked Aerojet's website, and they don't have anything on it since some SEC filings in December 20, 2020. In response to the Warren letter, a group of 13 Congress people from both sides of the aisle voiced their approval of the proposed merger in a formal letter to the Pentagon and Deputy Director Kathleen Hicks, per Mike Stone on 9-1 of Reuters 10 days ago. That's a good sign--anyone know anything else new? Thanks in advance!"

Lower. Lows... Sorry to say... But ready to buy more!Fiona
Any chance this share price will be dropped to $30/share? I hope Money makers will shake the share down before the Buyout deal close....
"I have 1.5k shares loaded up since $29, really hoping for a $40+ if buyout from Boeing takes place. Whole defense industry getting stronger and better!"

"The pay date for $5/share = 03/24/2021 per company news December 20,2020What will the share price be after the payment date??? Current price #$%$ new share price and until the buy out deal close then the share price will be $51????"
"SpaceX' Crew Capsule was destroyed Apr 20 in strap-down test-firing of the ""launch abort"" engines (Super-Draco). This will set them back for months or a year, as they are running out of money. This puts Boeing in the lead for ISS astronaut delivery. AR makes many of the engines on the Boeing capsule. Of course if SpaceX goes bankwupt, AR will be well-positioned."
Keep pushing!
Ppl finally realizing this 24% upside Arb trade with prob likely 85% chance to go through is a good deal…

"SpaceX competes with their new Raptor methane engine. Fanboys think all is great after the recent StarShip SN5 short hop flight. But, one year ago during the StarHopper flight, the Raptor engine was failing as it landed (bright yellow plume). In a recent test on the McGregor stand, Elon Musk tweeted they reached a new chamber pressure, but the engine suffered ""some damage"". The StarShip SN6 flight has been delayed a week, apparently due to engine issues (plus weather?). Meanwhile Blue Origin's BE-4 large methane engine is still having problems after 3 years of development testing. From wikipedia:""... Denver Business Journal 21 August 2020, ULA CEO Tory Bruno noted an ongoing issue with BE-4’s turbopumps."" The upside for both companies are their billionaire heads, if they don't lose interest dallying in rocket engines."
Missed big time!.38
Subtract debt
"SLS with the Aerojet engines failed its test today, major component failure on the engine"
"SpaceX StarShip hop performed flawlessly. There was a fire at the top of the Raptor engine, but perhaps benign. Might have been something like tape or an oil film burning since no sign of liquids or gases escaping. The main thing is that the engine worked well at low-throttle, which is the hardest part of landing. Their earlier Merlin engine descended from the Lunar Lander engine, so was designed for low-throttle stability. But Raptor is apparently still in development, and may not have proven 100% thrust yet. Seems like Blue Origin's BE-4 methane engine is in even worse limbo, falling years behind and no reports of a full-duration 100% thrust firing yet, so ULA's Vulcan vehicle is still on-hold. Still, unlikely that AR's AR-1 engine development for ULA will be resurrected."

"I read the merger agreement and there is a $150 Million fee. I assume that Aerojet Rocket Dyne gets $150 Million if the deal fails. If I am wrong it could be they have to pay LMT instead if they get sold to a higher bidder. Usually waiting for the merger costs everyone money and there are fees for both sides for non completion. NXPI collected a fee when their merger failed. Some of the cash went to a stock buy back and later the company started to pay a dividend. The stock has doubled since the failed merger. It appears that Traitor Joes administration might block the merger. However, not all it lost, administrations come and go as well as FTC heads. Low enough this might entice another bidder again."
AJRD reached an all time high at 50.24
"I just read one engineer's report on the Starliner ""faulty valves"". BOEING IS RESPONSIBLE. Heavy rains at launch site, combined with a prolonged exposure to environmental moisture. This is certainly due to the design of the protective elements that are supposed to protect the entire capsule from excess moisture prior to launch. Just like a TV set or phone, the manufacturer doesn't expect you to basically ""leave it out in the rain"" for a week amd expect it to work. Another huge Boeing screw up. Zero liability for Aerodyne at all"

They had some interesting insights about AJRD on http://stocktip.xyz. Definitely made me think twice about the company.
Just multiply 12 thousand acres times $80.000.00 an acre you have $1 billion and thats cheap for Ca. real estate . So they got the whole company for $3 billion and change. Problem is who can compete with a cash offer?
"RTX: If you want to challenge the deal, offer more!"
"If LMT fails to close the buy out, what adverse consequences happen, and does AJRD benefit? I always felt LMT stole this deal, and AJRD got the short end of the stick. The California real estate alone made this deal a steal. If this deal closes you can capture a quick 10k on a thousand shares. What am I missing?"
Get ready for lift off after earnings
"This puppy just appeared on my investment ""radar"" a few days ago after reading how it was involved with the engines of the Cassini probe that plunged into Saturn's atmosphere over the weekend. Although admittedly the stock has made one heckuva move, I like the business this company is in. With additional defense spending and black box projects on the horizon, I believe this stock could be a VERY Profitable investment during the next few years. With that said, look for a very possible pull back into the upper 20s."
