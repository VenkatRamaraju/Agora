Was there a problem with Lockheed acquiring them? I’m just confused why this has dropped so much
What has caused this sudden rise in AJRD's price today?
LMT needs to improvecits offer! 51 + 5 usd is not enough!
Lower. Lows... Sorry to say... But ready to buy more!Fiona
"Any one hearing anything on other offers? With MAXR jumping so much today, this offer just seems woefully inadequate, especially when you include the land. Where's Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos when you need them? Martin Marietta, Raytheon, and Boeing might also be good candidates."
See you at $75 this Year!Fiona
China.
NASA/ Space is a go
They have some crazy technology. Only getting more funding from govt. I'm thinking buy
"Dead cat bounce! Got to test $28 - $30I’m long, but the charts don’t lie! Plus missed earnings! Big time!Fiona"
Hello out there!lol
"The pay date for $5/share = 03/24/2021 per company news December 20,2020What will the share price be after the payment date??? Current price #$%$ new share price and until the buy out deal close then the share price will be $51????"
AJRD- Aerojet Rocketdyne Cp.- Looks like shares are going as high as: $24-$26. Dollar area in the next 6-18 months- or higher. Strong growth and earnings trending very much higher by a supreme leader in it's specialized field! Buy!
"Without LMT I believe AJRD is highly undervalued at 3B market cap. The deal will happen it's just a slow crawl, if LMT were smart they'd start buying AJRD so it'll cost them less when the deal goes through."
AJRD reached an all time high at 42.61
Stock continues to correct as I predicted 4 days ago. Its reaching very close to a buy point (low 32 would be great). Good Luck if you still own this puppy.

"AJRD somewhat confusing, report did not look good, stock sold off this AM but has since recouped all losses. Makes no sense , but what do I know"
"I have never seen a swing like this without earnings.... A short hit, followed by news of an acquisition. Congrats to whoever was able to take advantage of the swing. I was watching, but the opportunity past me."
$35 it’s a Buy!
Aerojet Rocketdyne is up 6.82% to 43.44

AJRD is up 4.97% to 25.97

Just multiply 12 thousand acres times $80.000.00 an acre you have $1 billion and thats cheap for Ca. real estate . So they got the whole company for $3 billion and change. Problem is who can compete with a cash offer?
LM acquisition?
$75 by year end!
AJRD reached an all time high at 43.95
Any news? Why down 3% this morning? The markets are up.
Earnings suposed to be today? why nobody talks here?

Can I still buy the share and get the paying price from Lockeed Martin
Okay so it hit a high of $57 for the year and we sell for $56 I don’t think so and we include 12 thousand acres of Ca. Real estate.
Nice to see the announcement about completing the propulsion system for the Artemis II mission. Hope there is a lot more coming. To the moon and beyond!

"The Los Angeles Times had an article on August 12, 2021 titled ""FTC chair urges blocking more M&A as Lockheed deal looms."" In it, Lina Khan, the FTC chair, is described as reviewing US regulatory policy re: m&A activity in the military sector, and has proposed opposing certain mergers outright, in an open letter to Senator Warren. The article also mentions Raytheon's opposition to the merger. Sorry I didn't post the link, but you can Google it. You have to disable your ad blocker to get access to the article, but you don't have to subscribe to gain access. No mention of any consequences of merger failure, or possible government remedies to allow the merger, e.g. selling off certain assets, (except in a very general sense of describing certain tools the government can use when reviewing m&a activity to allow mergers to go through.) Pretty good article though, and worth a read. GLTA"
Any news on the dip??
AJRD is up 7.32% to 29.75
Folks.... The buy out share price is $51. No matter what the price will be at $51 as the buy out out deal close??
"If the dividend is $5, the share will be dropped by $5....the new share price is $52-$5 = $47....is that the final price of the share at the closing buyout???? How much did LTM offer for each share?"
Successful final engine fire test. No reason for stock not going +50
"SpaceX competes with their new Raptor methane engine. Fanboys think all is great after the recent StarShip SN5 short hop flight. But, one year ago during the StarHopper flight, the Raptor engine was failing as it landed (bright yellow plume). In a recent test on the McGregor stand, Elon Musk tweeted they reached a new chamber pressure, but the engine suffered ""some damage"". The StarShip SN6 flight has been delayed a week, apparently due to engine issues (plus weather?). Meanwhile Blue Origin's BE-4 large methane engine is still having problems after 3 years of development testing. From wikipedia:""... Denver Business Journal 21 August 2020, ULA CEO Tory Bruno noted an ongoing issue with BE-4’s turbopumps."" The upside for both companies are their billionaire heads, if they don't lose interest dallying in rocket engines."

Great hopes for AJRD. Urgently needed rocket motors approaching an awaiting launch vehicle.
SELL
If we are to go off the RSI then you could argue that a pull back next day or so could occur on AJRD before rallying up. Ive been struggling with this stock lately. Some of my other trades have been from aw-esomeSTOCKS which are working out pretty well.
Congratulations
What's the latest news causing it to be down another 5% today?
AJRD reached a new All Time High at 37.44
"If LMT fails to close the buy out, what adverse consequences happen, and does AJRD benefit? I always felt LMT stole this deal, and AJRD got the short end of the stick. The California real estate alone made this deal a steal. If this deal closes you can capture a quick 10k on a thousand shares. What am I missing?"

"This puppy just appeared on my investment ""radar"" a few days ago after reading how it was involved with the engines of the Cassini probe that plunged into Saturn's atmosphere over the weekend. Although admittedly the stock has made one heckuva move, I like the business this company is in. With additional defense spending and black box projects on the horizon, I believe this stock could be a VERY Profitable investment during the next few years. With that said, look for a very possible pull back into the upper 20s."

They want employees to get involved, but threaten they will be fired if they post anything that might be considered detracting of AR, like even positive suggestions.

Did you buy the dip? A gift!
When will the financial report come out?
Wow. That a HUGE miss.
"Could it be that AJRD is retesting 34 because of Biden being up in the polls? Perhaps the thinking is that a Biden presidency will not be as aggressive with the space force.

"Up because SpaceX StarShip blew up on the landing? The flight went amazingly well, proving control, but the new Raptor engines failed again. Blue Origin has also been having major issues with their new methane booster, long delaying ULA's plan to replace the Russian RD-180 on Atlas V (demanded by both U.S. and Russian governments). Would be good for ARJD if their AR-1 engine development were resurrected, though unlikely due to cost. Developing a new liquid engine competently is expensive."

Northrop was allowed to buy Orbital. Why should then the Lockheed-Aerojet deal be stopped. Northrop now has an unfair advantage. There is no reason to stop this merger.
Drop? Two upbeat reports yesterday - all 16 engines tested and ready for NASA's Space Launch System and additive manufactured RL-10 engine (injector & other tricky parts) was proven in testing and will reduce cost. Did they lose a contract or something? Any rumors about THAAD production? A primary like Raytheon bypassing them to make products in-house?

I would accept 20% of one share of LMT they can keep the cash and we can decide when to sell.
"Okay, couldn't stand being out of this stock even though I still think its going lower (could be dead wrong about it going lower). Anyway, just used this significant weakness to buy back into it at 32.46!!"
AJRD reached an all time high at 47.29
what is implication of $5 special dividend?
"I read the merger agreement and there is a $150 Million fee. I assume that Aerojet Rocket Dyne gets $150 Million if the deal fails. If I am wrong it could be they have to pay LMT instead if they get sold to a higher bidder. Usually waiting for the merger costs everyone money and there are fees for both sides for non completion. NXPI collected a fee when their merger failed. Some of the cash went to a stock buy back and later the company started to pay a dividend. The stock has doubled since the failed merger. It appears that Traitor Joes administration might block the merger. However, not all it lost, administrations come and go as well as FTC heads. Low enough this might entice another bidder again."
"Way Overvalued!!!! Price will not hold, guaranteed. Don't get burned."
"SpaceX StarShip hop performed flawlessly. There was a fire at the top of the Raptor engine, but perhaps benign. Might have been something like tape or an oil film burning since no sign of liquids or gases escaping. The main thing is that the engine worked well at low-throttle, which is the hardest part of landing. Their earlier Merlin engine descended from the Lunar Lander engine, so was designed for low-throttle stability. But Raptor is apparently still in development, and may not have proven 100% thrust yet. Seems like Blue Origin's BE-4 methane engine is in even worse limbo, falling years behind and no reports of a full-duration 100% thrust firing yet, so ULA's Vulcan vehicle is still on-hold. Still, unlikely that AR's AR-1 engine development for ULA will be resurrected."
"Letitgrowknows is correct that this MB is quiet. Others I visit are GM (few posts) and TSLA (gazillions of posts and fun). He is overly-enthusiastic about additive manufacturing. AM w/ metal alloys has been growing in all industries w/ many trade articles for years. SpaceX is also producing production parts w/ AM. I would expect Blue Origin is too, though they are notoriously secretive."

Disappointing price action. Adding a bit more
"SpaceX' Crew Capsule was destroyed Apr 20 in strap-down test-firing of the ""launch abort"" engines (Super-Draco). This will set them back for months or a year, as they are running out of money. This puts Boeing in the lead for ISS astronaut delivery. AR makes many of the engines on the Boeing capsule. Of course if SpaceX goes bankwupt, AR will be well-positioned."
"SpaceX' new Raptor methane engine suffered its 2nd failure in StarShip testing. First was in the first Hopper test when it was melting as it landed (yellow plume). Last night was in the 3rd static-fire where it melted at the start. Blue Origin's new methane BE-4 engine is also having issues after years of testing, with Bruno of ULA tweeting it is turbo-pump issues. Bad for them, thus good for AR."
AJRD is down -5.82% to 25.41
"I just read one engineer's report on the Starliner ""faulty valves"". BOEING IS RESPONSIBLE. Heavy rains at launch site, combined with a prolonged exposure to environmental moisture. This is certainly due to the design of the protective elements that are supposed to protect the entire capsule from excess moisture prior to launch. Just like a TV set or phone, the manufacturer doesn't expect you to basically ""leave it out in the rain"" for a week amd expect it to work. Another huge Boeing screw up. Zero liability for Aerodyne at all"
They had some interesting insights about AJRD on http://stocktip.xyz. Definitely made me think twice about the company.
Close of the deal soon
