AJRD reached an all time high at 54.53
"Hoping for $34 but doubt it!$38 should be the bottom!Too much going on with this co. Mars, etc..."
"RTX: If you want to challenge the deal, offer more!"
Especially read the comments after the article:https://spacenews.com/firefly-partners-with-aerojet-rocketdyne-mulls-ar1-engine-for-beta-launch-vehicle/
"$5 billion for this company seems awfully low, seems LMT is getting quite a a bargain."
LMT or BA should buy
Drop? Two upbeat reports yesterday - all 16 engines tested and ready for NASA's Space Launch System and additive manufactured RL-10 engine (injector & other tricky parts) was proven in testing and will reduce cost. Did they lose a contract or something? Any rumors about THAAD production? A primary like Raytheon bypassing them to make products in-house?
Why not sell all the real estate and keep only the building they have as a home. Billions for shareholders and a company to boot.
When will the buy out deal be done??
#$%$ is going on with this stock????
What has caused this sudden rise in AJRD's price today?
"Way Overvalued!!!! Price will not hold, guaranteed. Don't get burned."
Anyone know if and when they’ll ever start giving a dividend?
continued ability to meet all cnc deliverables in question. Over-wrapped composites are acontinuous series of hit and miss .
"wait a minute, ajrd has backlog sales 1billion plus larger than their market cap???"
Northrop was allowed to buy Orbital. Why should then the Lockheed-Aerojet deal be stopped. Northrop now has an unfair advantage. There is no reason to stop this merger.

"I have 1.5k shares loaded up since $29, really hoping for a $40+ if buyout from Boeing takes place. Whole defense industry getting stronger and better!"
"Deal will be closed in Q4, what a joke!"
future abilities to meet Thadd deliveries in question.
"SLS with the Aerojet engines failed its test today, major component failure on the engine"
hard to break the $43 resistance. also following the downward trendline. could the consolidation the last 6 days be the bottom ?
Awesome!!!!!
This is a stock and sector I want to be in so I've been buying the dips this week. Really like this sector long term. $SPCE $MAXR $AJRD
"I have never seen a swing like this without earnings.... A short hit, followed by news of an acquisition. Congrats to whoever was able to take advantage of the swing. I was watching, but the opportunity past me."
"New released of $1.8B contract to make more RS-25 ""Space Shuttle Main Engines"" for SLS, but the stock price drops 2.3%. Must have already been baked into the price."
"China is launching nuclear capable hypersonic missiles and this is being held up by the FTC over a small 4B acquisition…give me a break. There is zero % chance this doesn’t go through, with these new developments, it is a MUST that LMT takes over AJRD and advances their missile tech."
Staying long and strong in the defense stocks and national security. Salute to USA

This was nothing more than a short hit apparently. One analyst pretending to know the future.
@Hanswurst... What will the price of the share be after the payment of the special dividend? $47 ????
Successful final engine fire test. No reason for stock not going +50
"If the dividend is $5, the share will be dropped by $5....the new share price is $52-$5 = $47....is that the final price of the share at the closing buyout???? How much did LTM offer for each share?"

"SpaceX StarShip hop performed flawlessly. There was a fire at the top of the Raptor engine, but perhaps benign. Might have been something like tape or an oil film burning since no sign of liquids or gases escaping. The main thing is that the engine worked well at low-throttle, which is the hardest part of landing. Their earlier Merlin engine descended from the Lunar Lander engine, so was designed for low-throttle stability. But Raptor is apparently still in development, and may not have proven 100% thrust yet. Seems like Blue Origin's BE-4 methane engine is in even worse limbo, falling years behind and no reports of a full-duration 100% thrust firing yet, so ULA's Vulcan vehicle is still on-hold. Still, unlikely that AR's AR-1 engine development for ULA will be resurrected."

Nice to see the announcement about completing the propulsion system for the Artemis II mission. Hope there is a lot more coming. To the moon and beyond!
I love this stock. any idea or rumors? bought this years ago at 3$ a share
Does anyone know who owns or controls the test stands in Florida?
When will we get the $5/share dividend???
"This puppy just appeared on my investment ""radar"" a few days ago after reading how it was involved with the engines of the Cassini probe that plunged into Saturn's atmosphere over the weekend. Although admittedly the stock has made one heckuva move, I like the business this company is in. With additional defense spending and black box projects on the horizon, I believe this stock could be a VERY Profitable investment during the next few years. With that said, look for a very possible pull back into the upper 20s."
When will the deal of buy out be done?
Almost 2% jump in few minutes? Red to green in down market. Maybe there’s news coming? 1:35 pm currently
5.4 Billion in contracts!!!
Disappointing price action. Adding a bit more
Would it not hit $50 pm with the 51+5 buyout? Any reason why it should dip despite a higher price buyout?

"I just read one engineer's report on the Starliner ""faulty valves"". BOEING IS RESPONSIBLE. Heavy rains at launch site, combined with a prolonged exposure to environmental moisture. This is certainly due to the design of the protective elements that are supposed to protect the entire capsule from excess moisture prior to launch. Just like a TV set or phone, the manufacturer doesn't expect you to basically ""leave it out in the rain"" for a week amd expect it to work. Another huge Boeing screw up. Zero liability for Aerodyne at all"
"Mark my words, this deal will end up getting done at a higher price, closer to $65-70 either from LMT increasing its offer or from a second bidder showing up. As an AJRD shareholder, I am honestly not that enticed with $56 per share... AJRDs expertise in propulsion systems is worth more than $4.4B. Mark this post."
Defense and national security per today’s task force so staying bullish here
Didn’t the co blow allIt’s cash 400 million in specialDividendWhy does Ajrd have to pay 150 million breakup fee?
"Up because SpaceX StarShip blew up on the landing? The flight went amazingly well, proving control, but the new Raptor engines failed again. Blue Origin has also been having major issues with their new methane booster, long delaying ULA's plan to replace the Russian RD-180 on Atlas V (demanded by both U.S. and Russian governments). Would be good for ARJD if their AR-1 engine development were resurrected, though unlikely due to cost. Developing a new liquid engine competently is expensive."
so if you buy now does that mean it will definitely go up to $51
Get ready for lift off after earnings
AJRD is up 7.32% to 29.75
"SpaceX' new Raptor methane engine suffered its 2nd failure in StarShip testing. First was in the first Hopper test when it was melting as it landed (yellow plume). Last night was in the 3rd static-fire where it melted at the start. Blue Origin's new methane BE-4 engine is also having issues after years of testing, with Bruno of ULA tweeting it is turbo-pump issues. Bad for them, thus good for AR."
"If the potential of the merger to take this to $51 was not enough, now you have a company with great earnings. Low risk to the downside till next earnings, and merger still on the works just delayed"
Just multiply 12 thousand acres times $80.000.00 an acre you have $1 billion and thats cheap for Ca. real estate . So they got the whole company for $3 billion and change. Problem is who can compete with a cash offer?
$35 it’s a Buy!
AJRD- Aerojet Rocketdyne Cp.- Looks like shares are going as high as: $24-$26. Dollar area in the next 6-18 months- or higher. Strong growth and earnings trending very much higher by a supreme leader in it's specialized field! Buy!
"Without LMT I believe AJRD is highly undervalued at 3B market cap. The deal will happen it's just a slow crawl, if LMT were smart they'd start buying AJRD so it'll cost them less when the deal goes through."

Any chance this share price will be dropped to $30/share? I hope Money makers will shake the share down before the Buyout deal close....
"SpaceX' Crew Capsule was destroyed Apr 20 in strap-down test-firing of the ""launch abort"" engines (Super-Draco). This will set them back for months or a year, as they are running out of money. This puts Boeing in the lead for ISS astronaut delivery. AR makes many of the engines on the Boeing capsule. Of course if SpaceX goes bankwupt, AR will be well-positioned."

Aerojet Rocketdyne $AJRD AcquisitionMerger Factsheet for traders and investors looking to trade the merger arbitrage spread https://mergerarbitragelimited.com/aerojet-rocketdyne-ajrd-acquisition/
"I read the merger agreement and there is a $150 Million fee. I assume that Aerojet Rocket Dyne gets $150 Million if the deal fails. If I am wrong it could be they have to pay LMT instead if they get sold to a higher bidder. Usually waiting for the merger costs everyone money and there are fees for both sides for non completion. NXPI collected a fee when their merger failed. Some of the cash went to a stock buy back and later the company started to pay a dividend. The stock has doubled since the failed merger. It appears that Traitor Joes administration might block the merger. However, not all it lost, administrations come and go as well as FTC heads. Low enough this might entice another bidder again."
Can I still buy the share and get the paying price from Lockeed Martin
"The pay date for $5/share = 03/24/2021 per company news December 20,2020What will the share price be after the payment date??? Current price #$%$ new share price and until the buy out deal close then the share price will be $51????"
way oversold . buy and hold!
$AJRD twitter says the CFO stepped down. Questions about the CFA certificate he claimed to hold.
"What is the logic that Zacks research to give this stock a ""strong sell""? LMT is buying it in Q3 of 2021 for $51/share ... all cash. That will be 7-10% gain. AJRD will cease to exist after the buyout in Q3."
AJRD is up 5.77% to $32.25
The buy out deal gets approved. The share price will be $51/share + $5/share dividend now???
I would accept 20% of one share of LMT they can keep the cash and we can decide when to sell.
"Letitgrowknows is correct that this MB is quiet. Others I visit are GM (few posts) and TSLA (gazillions of posts and fun). He is overly-enthusiastic about additive manufacturing. AM w/ metal alloys has been growing in all industries w/ many trade articles for years. SpaceX is also producing production parts w/ AM. I would expect Blue Origin is too, though they are notoriously secretive."
If we are to go off the RSI then you could argue that a pull back next day or so could occur on AJRD before rallying up. Ive been struggling with this stock lately. Some of my other trades have been from aw-esomeSTOCKS which are working out pretty well.
Great hopes for AJRD. Urgently needed rocket motors approaching an awaiting launch vehicle.

"The Los Angeles Times had an article on August 12, 2021 titled ""FTC chair urges blocking more M&A as Lockheed deal looms."" In it, Lina Khan, the FTC chair, is described as reviewing US regulatory policy re: m&A activity in the military sector, and has proposed opposing certain mergers outright, in an open letter to Senator Warren. The article also mentions Raytheon's opposition to the merger. Sorry I didn't post the link, but you can Google it. You have to disable your ad blocker to get access to the article, but you don't have to subscribe to gain access. No mention of any consequences of merger failure, or possible government remedies to allow the merger, e.g. selling off certain assets, (except in a very general sense of describing certain tools the government can use when reviewing m&a activity to allow mergers to go through.) Pretty good article though, and worth a read. GLTA"

"Anyone out there heard any news on the proposed merger? I just checked Aerojet's website, and they don't have anything on it since some SEC filings in December 20, 2020. In response to the Warren letter, a group of 13 Congress people from both sides of the aisle voiced their approval of the proposed merger in a formal letter to the Pentagon and Deputy Director Kathleen Hicks, per Mike Stone on 9-1 of Reuters 10 days ago.

"SpaceX competes with their new Raptor methane engine. Fanboys think all is great after the recent StarShip SN5 short hop flight. But, one year ago during the StarHopper flight, the Raptor engine was failing as it landed (bright yellow plume). In a recent test on the McGregor stand, Elon Musk tweeted they reached a new chamber pressure, but the engine suffered ""some damage"". The StarShip SN6 flight has been delayed a week, apparently due to engine issues (plus weather?). Meanwhile Blue Origin's BE-4 large methane engine is still having problems after 3 years of development testing. From wikipedia:""... Denver Business Journal 21 August 2020, ULA CEO Tory Bruno noted an ongoing issue with BE-4’s turbopumps."" The upside for both companies are their billionaire heads, if they don't lose interest dallying in rocket engines."

"Could it be that AJRD is retesting 34 because of Biden being up in the polls? Perhaps the thinking is that a Biden presidency will not be as aggressive with the space force. I see Raytheon etc. following the same pattern the last week or so. I'd like to buy more of AJRD here, but concerned about the aforementioned. Thoughts?"
