Aerojet Rocketdyne is down 5.35% to 43.89
"I have 1.5k shares loaded up since $29, really hoping for a $40+ if buyout from Boeing takes place. Whole defense industry getting stronger and better!"
"Letitgrowknows is correct that this MB is quiet. Others I visit are GM (few posts) and TSLA (gazillions of posts and fun). He is overly-enthusiastic about additive manufacturing. AM w/ metal alloys has been growing in all industries w/ many trade articles for years. SpaceX is also producing production parts w/ AM. I would expect Blue Origin is too, though they are notoriously secretive."
Will buy more at $30Should be the bottom...
Recently recommended by Technology newsletter I follow.Just the beginning of the big ramp up in commercial space industry including satellite internet etc ...also military/defense.Chart looks good. UptrendStarted an opening position. Will buy on any significant dips.
Aerojet Rocketdyne is up 26.21% to 53.06
AJRD- Aerojet Rocketdyne Cp.- Looks like shares are going as high as: $24-$26. Dollar area in the next 6-18 months- or higher. Strong growth and earnings trending very much higher by a supreme leader in it's specialized field! Buy!
Will buy more if it gets close $34
USA
The buy out deal gets approved. The share price will be $51/share + $5/share dividend now???
AJRD reached an all time high at $39.33
"Woooooow, AJRD now near lowest levels of the day, down over 11%. Sure looks like its going much lower. Probably get downgrades early next week, sending it down to 24 and change area. Monitor stock for double bottom before buying more shares or adding to current position. Remember, it only takes ONE STOCK to wreck your portfolio (if you buy too much of a bad one)."
This is overpriced! I bought in at $48.00. Sold all at $42.00 for a loss! Bought in at $50.00. Sold all at $42.00 after months of bobbing price doing nothing? Now it’s still too pricey!
AJRD reached an all time high at 50.85

Drop? Two upbeat reports yesterday - all 16 engines tested and ready for NASA's Space Launch System and additive manufactured RL-10 engine (injector & other tricky parts) was proven in testing and will reduce cost. Did they lose a contract or something? Any rumors about THAAD production? A primary like Raytheon bypassing them to make products in-house?
This is a stock and sector I want to be in so I've been buying the dips this week. Really like this sector long term. $SPCE $MAXR $AJRD

"The LA Times article will also allow you to access via link Senator Warren's letter to Chair Khan on July 16, 2021 which sets forth her concerns about vertical integration of suppliers into fewer and fewer major military suppliers to the U.S. government, and the anti competitive effects of these mergers. Only 4 pages long, but very dense content, and insightful on where Warren wants to go with these matters. Well worth the read! GLTA"
Any chance this share price will be dropped to $30/share? I hope Money makers will shake the share down before the Buyout deal close....

"Seems like there is very little recent news, no conversation, and lots of movement on this one. Anyone know what is driving this stock to move/drop?"
From what I know: the share price will be dropped to the same amount of the dividend on the ex-dividend date.... What will the share price be???
What has caused this sudden rise in AJRD's price today?
hard to break the $43 resistance. also following the downward trendline. could the consolidation the last 6 days be the bottom ?
AJRD is down -5.07% to 28.62
Northrop was allowed to buy Orbital. Why should then the Lockheed-Aerojet deal be stopped. Northrop now has an unfair advantage. There is no reason to stop this merger.
Can I still buy the share and get the paying price from Lockeed Martin
"AJRD somewhat confusing, report did not look good, stock sold off this AM but has since recouped all losses. Makes no sense , but what do I know"
This was nothing more than a short hit apparently. One analyst pretending to know the future.
Explain the 7% drop?
I love this stock. any idea or rumors? bought this years ago at 3$ a share
Only thing red on my board
"Okay, just found the news on stocktwits. They missed earnings estimates by 4 cents. Here's the rest: Aerojet Rocketdyne misses by $0.04, reports revs in-line (32.15 +1.31) Reports Q3 (Sep) earnings of $0.17 per share, $0.04 worse than the two analyst estimate of $0.21; revenues rose 4.3% year/year to $484 mln vs the $487.48 mln Capital IQ Consensus.

"So, I have to ask. Why does AJRD management take the route of not doing conference calls (and very few presentations)? Seems odd for a billion dollar defense company. There is so much to like here. Sure seems that if they promoted the company at all it would bring more investors on board."
"wait a minute, ajrd has backlog sales 1billion plus larger than their market cap???"
Almost 2% jump in few minutes? Red to green in down market. Maybe there’s news coming? 1:35 pm currently
"SpaceX' Crew Capsule was destroyed Apr 20 in strap-down test-firing of the ""launch abort"" engines (Super-Draco). This will set them back for months or a year, as they are running out of money. This puts Boeing in the lead for ISS astronaut delivery. AR makes many of the engines on the Boeing capsule. Of course if SpaceX goes bankwupt, AR will be well-positioned."

"I just read one engineer's report on the Starliner ""faulty valves"". BOEING IS RESPONSIBLE. Heavy rains at launch site, combined with a prolonged exposure to environmental moisture. This is certainly due to the design of the protective elements that are supposed to protect the entire capsule from excess moisture prior to launch. Just like a TV set or phone, the manufacturer doesn't expect you to basically ""leave it out in the rain"" for a week amd expect it to work. Another huge Boeing screw up. Zero liability for Aerodyne at all"

"I read the merger agreement and there is a $150 Million fee. I assume that Aerojet Rocket Dyne gets $150 Million if the deal fails. If I am wrong it could be they have to pay LMT instead if they get sold to a higher bidder. Usually waiting for the merger costs everyone money and there are fees for both sides for non completion. NXPI collected a fee when their merger failed. Some of the cash went to a stock buy back and later the company started to pay a dividend. The stock has doubled since the failed merger. It appears that Traitor Joes administration might block the merger. However, not all it lost, administrations come and go as well as FTC heads. Low enough this might entice another bidder again."
"SpaceX StarShip hop performed flawlessly. There was a fire at the top of the Raptor engine, but perhaps benign. Might have been something like tape or an oil film burning since no sign of liquids or gases escaping. The main thing is that the engine worked well at low-throttle, which is the hardest part of landing. Their earlier Merlin engine descended from the Lunar Lander engine, so was designed for low-throttle stability. But Raptor is apparently still in development, and may not have proven 100% thrust yet. Seems like Blue Origin's BE-4 methane engine is in even worse limbo, falling years behind and no reports of a full-duration 100% thrust firing yet, so ULA's Vulcan vehicle is still on-hold. Still, unlikely that AR's AR-1 engine development for ULA will be resurrected."
Subtract debt
People that run the company could care less about shareholders.
"What is the logic that Zacks research to give this stock a ""strong sell""? LMT is buying it in Q3 of 2021 for $51/share ... all cash. That will be 7-10% gain. AJRD will cease to exist after the buyout in Q3."

"This puppy just appeared on my investment ""radar"" a few days ago after reading how it was involved with the engines of the Cassini probe that plunged into Saturn's atmosphere over the weekend. Although admittedly the stock has made one heckuva move, I like the business this company is in. With additional defense spending and black box projects on the horizon, I believe this stock could be a VERY Profitable investment during the next few years. With that said, look for a very possible pull back into the upper 20s."

"SpaceX' new Raptor methane engine suffered its 2nd failure in StarShip testing. First was in the first Hopper test when it was melting as it landed (yellow plume). Last night was in the 3rd static-fire where it melted at the start. Blue Origin's new methane BE-4 engine is also having issues after years of testing, with Bruno of ULA tweeting it is turbo-pump issues. Bad for them, thus good for AR."
"SpaceX competes with their new Raptor methane engine. Fanboys think all is great after the recent StarShip SN5 short hop flight. But, one year ago during the StarHopper flight, the Raptor engine was failing as it landed (bright yellow plume). In a recent test on the McGregor stand, Elon Musk tweeted they reached a new chamber pressure, but the engine suffered ""some damage"". The StarShip SN6 flight has been delayed a week, apparently due to engine issues (plus weather?). Meanwhile Blue Origin's BE-4 large methane engine is still having problems after 3 years of development testing. From wikipedia:""... Denver Business Journal 21 August 2020, ULA CEO Tory Bruno noted an ongoing issue with BE-4’s turbopumps."" The upside for both companies are their billionaire heads, if they don't lose interest dallying in rocket engines."

"The Los Angeles Times had an article on August 12, 2021 titled ""FTC chair urges blocking more M&A as Lockheed deal looms."" In it, Lina Khan, the FTC chair, is described as reviewing US regulatory policy re: m&A activity in the military sector, and has proposed opposing certain mergers outright, in an open letter to Senator Warren. The article also mentions Raytheon's opposition to the merger. Sorry I didn't post the link, but you can Google it. You have to disable your ad blocker to get access to the article, but you don't have to subscribe to gain access. No mention of any consequences of merger failure, or possible government remedies to allow the merger, e.g. selling off certain assets, (except in a very general sense of describing certain tools the government can use when reviewing m&a activity to allow mergers to go through.) Pretty good article though, and worth a read. GLTA"

"Up because SpaceX StarShip blew up on the landing? The flight went amazingly well, proving control, but the new Raptor engines failed again. Blue Origin has also been having major issues with their new methane booster, long delaying ULA's plan to replace the Russian RD-180 on Atlas V (demanded by both U.S. and Russian governments). Would be good for ARJD if their AR-1 engine development were resurrected, though unlikely due to cost. Developing a new liquid engine competently is expensive."

In response to the Warren letter, a group of 13 Congress people from both sides of the aisle voiced their approval of the proposed merger in a formal letter to the Pentagon and Deputy Director Kathleen Hicks, per Mike Stone on 9-1 of Reuters 10 days ago. That's a good sign--anyone know anything else new? Thanks in advance!"
Just multiply 12 thousand acres times $80.000.00 an acre you have $1 billion and thats cheap for Ca. real estate . So they got the whole company for $3 billion and change. Problem is who can compete with a cash offer?
