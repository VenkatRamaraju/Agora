Didn’t the co blow allIt’s cash 400 million in specialDividendWhy does Ajrd have to pay 150 million breakup fee?
What about Lockheed sale effective 4q at $51?
Ppl finally realizing this 24% upside Arb trade with prob likely 85% chance to go through is a good deal…
This is a very rare gift from the Wall Street Gods….in the next month or so this stock will go up 23%….amazing it’s being overlooked…

"China is launching nuclear capable hypersonic missiles and this is being held up by the FTC over a small 4B acquisition…give me a break. There is zero % chance this doesn’t go through, with these new developments, it is a MUST that LMT takes over AJRD and advances their missile tech."
"If the potential of the merger to take this to $51 was not enough, now you have a company with great earnings. Low risk to the downside till next earnings, and merger still on the works just delayed"
"The LA Times article will also allow you to access via link Senator Warren's letter to Chair Khan on July 16, 2021 which sets forth her concerns about vertical integration of suppliers into fewer and fewer major military suppliers to the U.S. government, and the anti competitive effects of these mergers. Only 4 pages long, but very dense content, and insightful on where Warren wants to go with these matters. Well worth the read! GLTA"
hard to break the $43 resistance. also following the downward trendline. could the consolidation the last 6 days be the bottom ?
Northrop was allowed to buy Orbital. Why should then the Lockheed-Aerojet deal be stopped. Northrop now has an unfair advantage. There is no reason to stop this merger.

"Anyone out there heard any news on the proposed merger? I just checked Aerojet's website, and they don't have anything on it since some SEC filings in December 20, 2020. In response to the Warren letter, a group of 13 Congress people from both sides of the aisle voiced their approval of the proposed merger in a formal letter to the Pentagon and Deputy Director Kathleen Hicks, per Mike Stone on 9-1 of Reuters 10 days ago. That's a good sign--anyone know anything else new? Thanks in advance!"
"If LMT fails to close the buy out, what adverse consequences happen, and does AJRD benefit? I always felt LMT stole this deal, and AJRD got the short end of the stick. The California real estate alone made this deal a steal. If this deal closes you can capture a quick 10k on a thousand shares. What am I missing?"
FTC news?
Was there a problem with Lockheed acquiring them? I’m just confused why this has dropped so much
"The Los Angeles Times had an article on August 12, 2021 titled ""FTC chair urges blocking more M&A as Lockheed deal looms."" In it, Lina Khan, the FTC chair, is described as reviewing US regulatory policy re: m&A activity in the military sector, and has proposed opposing certain mergers outright, in an open letter to Senator Warren. The article also mentions Raytheon's opposition to the merger. Sorry I didn't post the link, but you can Google it. You have to disable your ad blocker to get access to the article, but you don't have to subscribe to gain access. No mention of any consequences of merger failure, or possible government remedies to allow the merger, e.g. selling off certain assets, (except in a very general sense of describing certain tools the government can use when reviewing m&a activity to allow mergers to go through.) Pretty good article though, and worth a read. GLTA"
"I read the merger agreement and there is a $150 Million fee. I assume that Aerojet Rocket Dyne gets $150 Million if the deal fails. If I am wrong it could be they have to pay LMT instead if they get sold to a higher bidder. Usually waiting for the merger costs everyone money and there are fees for both sides for non completion. NXPI collected a fee when their merger failed. Some of the cash went to a stock buy back and later the company started to pay a dividend. The stock has doubled since the failed merger. It appears that Traitor Joes administration might block the merger. However, not all it lost, administrations come and go as well as FTC heads. Low enough this might entice another bidder again."

"Without LMT I believe AJRD is highly undervalued at 3B market cap. The deal will happen it's just a slow crawl, if LMT were smart they'd start buying AJRD so it'll cost them less when the deal goes through."
