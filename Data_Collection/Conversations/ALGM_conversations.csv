"this is the most quiet, consistent stock I own."
Allegro MicroSystems is up 5.14% to 34.38
Hard to believe no one talks on this stock. I just grabbed a decent position in ALGM. I just don’t think the word is out yet. So much potential with a booming market in EV. Not a whole lot of big competition with the sensor markets either. Hopefully this is my next ROKU or SQ.. I picked both of them up right after dropping as an IPO but my mistake in them was not buying enough .. I won’t make that mistake on ALGM!!!

"It seems that the offering is non dilutive, I might be wrong? The company is not issuing shares and it said it will not benefit from it. It’s meant for insiders who want to sell their shares. I wonder if this has something to do with the lockup shares that will expire soon that is pressuring the stock from flying? Anyone here who sees it this way?"
"The only reason I found out about this company is from the fact that I get Seeking Alpha emails regarding the stocks that I own. TXN is one of them, and the email was actually about ALGM, though I received it because TXN was mentioned as a competitor. That perked up my interest...and after reading about the company, I got in on the ipo date. Same thing today happened with PubMatic...ipo is today, and since I own GOOG, I received an email because GOOG is a competitor. PubMatic seems like the real deal, and is ipo'ing today at a dirt cheap price."
Great long term investment
This is such a buy. One of the few IPOs that makes money and grows topline nicely. TEAM was like this a few years back around these prices and now its $182..this will do the same imo
Any rumors?
"I bought this last month when I decided that I had finally found a company that could have the similar trifecta that I saw in my biggest winner ENPH 3 years ago. An enabling technology, in a new and growing industry that (most importantly) most people had NOT YET NOTICED. This third factor is the hardest. ALGM fits these criteria, except the underlying industry has shifted from solar to electric and driverless cars."
Hope my order filled for 32.50 today
Hope close above 35
Loving this stock more every day! Go ALGM.
"11% up in premarket, any news?"
"From almost $37 down to $29 with no reason? Does not make any sense, simply manipulation."
Good earnings hopefully it will go back up to 27￼
Anyone is long on this company?
Should have been sold yesterday
this looks like a pretty solid semiconductor play! am I missing something?
"Should have been sold around 35, missed that boat"
