So hard to trust this lol
very undervalued company....
this dog is about to hunt the shorts!!! let's go!!!
Why does this trade at a mega discount compared to CHWY?
CEO bought $1m worth shares around $22...So it would be worth long holding....
"great company, definitely going up"
"IPO is $27, it has lots of rooms to grow"
"Trajectory is $30+, long overdue."
CHWY: 7B Revenue - 27B MCWOOF: 5B Revenue - 7B MCWhich is undervalued and a better buy?!
"steady climb,stock a steal under $30, dogs everywhere,locations will double"

They will not let it break 22 to the upside....go figure
$Chwy overvalue$woof undervalue
The float is being shorted 29.7%!? holy smokes. I’ll wait for this to hit rock bottom and buy in
I think the company has show a lot of strength the last couple quarters and this is an overdue rise.
Compared to other companies woof should be double
"CHWY’s valuation is an absolute joke.$7b revenue: $27 MC and they are not even profitable.WOOF $5b revenue: $7b MCTHEY ARE PROFITABLE. They WAY more avenues for growth available to them because their B&M let them have: Vets, Grooming, Training, local delivery’s for online purchases saving on shipping costs… Do the math guys."
SNAP tanked... it is $5B with $100B market cap... gez... WOOF with annual sales $5-6billion and market cap $7B...way undervalued
I cannot believe the revenue to MC valuation on this. What a gift.
No way but up. Under valued with substantial growth potential!
