Looks like rolling out National TV ad campaign. Whole Health
make no sense at all from 6% below to 3.8% up and then down to red....
"Take a chill pill, investors. Petco is clearly undervalued while Chewy is clearly overvalued. That’ll switch as fund managers begin to worry about valuations. And they will. Every year Chewy is in business the growth rate will slow. Petco is already mature but still doing great. They are like Walmart in one sense, they’ll continue to grow at a decent clip. They’re recession proof. And as safe an investment as any."
"Should be $50 by Christmas. Heck, it should be $50 right now."
"Copied from Friday news at investor place. No comment required.... simple ... super bullish WOOF stock. For Q1 2021, the company reported revenue growth of 27% to $1.4 billion. For the same period, the company acquired 1.2 million new net customers. This was the third consecutive quarter where more than one million customers were acquired.It’s also worth noting that the market for pet care was worth $109 billion for FY2020. Over the next five years, the market size is expected to increase to $157 billion. Therefore, there is a big addressable market and this is likely to ensure that healthy growth sustains.From a financial perspective, the company reported a positive free cash flow of $68 million for Q1 2021. For the comparable period last year, FCF was negative.With positive FCF, the company is well-positioned to deleverage. Another important point to note is that the company’s comparable sales increased by 28% in Q1 2021. If comparable sales growth remains strong, it’s likely that EBITDA margin will continue to improve."
I would never sell my dog so why would I sell my woof? Buying the dips.
Too bad. Good news in an unstable market now. Not much increases
Have yet to see a Petco TV commercial.
Back to $22
"$25 this week ,new buyers or m&a deal coming soon, selling CHWY and buying WOOF"
I've done 3 petco vs chewy purchases and Petco has arrived first every time. fyi
"simple solution new ""shareholders"" very simple somebody wants it down on big up day ,so on a down day it just maybe goes down more,, now the answer JUST BUY EVERY DAY this WEEK< for now just BUY up to $25, you'll make a ton of $$$$"
this is top trend for a reason
looks like not enough steam to really get this going. party is over. not even sure if this can hold 20 anymore.
does anybody know if there's an earnings date?
Chewy has a market cap of 47b. Petco is $4b. Looks like Woof has some room to run.
Been watching this stock lots of potential. Expected a Pull back as most IPO’s do. Got in at 25.75 hoping that’s the base and it’s to the moon from here
One month chart finally starting to show that incremental climb
Yahoo shows 1 year PT of $87.33?
"Apparently, there was misinformation about the end of the lockup period for insiders. It was thought to be mid July based on a 180 day lockup period. But according to the Nasdaq, it's a 221 day period that ends tomorrow. That means you could see some serious insider selling starting tomorrow and that is why the stock is still heavily shorted. Once we get past that selling period, the stock should go up based on strong earnings and the reduced threat of heavy selling."

way undervalued stocks...load it up till $25 before earnings
What a dooooog....no upside at all !
Who’s buying more prior to earnings?
I feel this stock is under valued. 3 times I've bought from both chewy n petco. petco arrived first and with no damage. One Chewy order arrived with dented cans. No big deal. What I do think is cool and smart if that Chewy will send you a card and gift when one of your animals dies. I do not know if Petco does that. Very cool and smart in keeping a loyal customer. My friend shops for his pets at Chewy. I prefer Petco for both store and online.
They will not let it break 22 to the upside....go figure
"When the analysts say ""Buy"" = Code words for ""Fly"". Works everytime.Another way to say is ""Good luck"" really translates to ""Bad Luck"". lol.Good Luck!"
We never going to see below $21 until next quarter result
$WOOF = Petco = $$$$
This company has High debt to equity.
and yes i like chewy but its price is too high petco is a safer and way more profitable company right now specially at less than $30 lol it is like a gift
"One thing to remember is that WOOF included a 17 million dollar charge for expenses of public offering in their latest earnings. This charge was a one time expense. That coupled with the unique offerings of online business, curbside/in store pick up, you have the ingredients for earnings beat 2021/2022."
22.00SELL signal
"I put in an order at 18, but seems like it’s not yet trading? Was anyone else able to get in and buy?"
Holding strong for long....
competitor not doing well is not a good reason to go up. its gona cause is this going to happen to u too effect.
Here comes the squeeze
Now that Petco is delivering food in one day this stock has to go up. I think eventually it will be on a par with Chewy if not better
"covers all areas of pet care,stores have everything, ceo at top of his game easily $40 by end of year. New analyst rec's out $47.50"
Here we go $WOOF! $WOOF!
The dangerous is high PE. I think $8 be good entry.
All I know that last years third-quarter￼ revenue was￼ $3.58 billion￼. You figure out what this company is worth? How many times yearly revenue￼?
Sell and buy at 22
"what is wrong with this one? earing good, forecast strong.. tank 3% in a big green day"
This will continue to trade within a tight band ($26-28) at least until the 1st quarter results are available or there's some sudden development that will move it drastically in either direction.
BOUGHT 3000 SHARES TODAY.
Looks like a TEENS stock for life !
$6.7B market cap and has a $2.12B gross profit (TTM) with debt of $3B. It could pay off the debt and still make a profit within 2 years. Institutions hardly hold any position. I think it’s some where around 75% insider ownership. This thing is screaming BUY

Dementia Joe will give it to you straight from the shoulder
what a #$%$!
this stock will pop this week with a great earnings report.
Pet adoptions have grown significantly during the pandemic. Petco has been committed to a digital first approach. Petco’s bottom line is definitely going to beat estimates ($1.35B). The question is their model profitable? They are set to earn 0.18 EPS for 2021. I think there is a high chance of beating top line as well. If their guidance beats growth then we should see $WOOF in the 30s or 10B market cap; 30% upside.
good news compounding with short squeeze more and more likely by the day :)
Anyone else think that Petco will hit $30 in the next 30 days?
please do not cold the retailers heart
"Geez, Tom sure wants those TEENS real bad, I think he’s out of luck. Poor Tom."
Woof has $1.7B in debt which was reconsolidated to another loan which matured in 2028. I thought it was much worse. I’m buying more today...
"Not every stock is Gamestop. Just because this was a recent IPO doesn't mean the stock is going up to $50 in a flash. Yes Chewy is rockin it now for the time being primarily because of Covid. Eventually people will go back to the specialty retailers, especially pet stores. There are only PetSupplies, Petsmart and Petco in that sector with Petco having more natural choices. We will see a gain at some point in the next 52 people. You are looking at a upside/downside of 20%. That puts your INVESETMENT currently at an approximate $5 swing ($20-$30) either way. Look at the fundamentals, investing is about getting a return on your money, not about being rich overnight. Being patient and making sound decisions pave the way to wealth. If you personally feel good about WOOF buy more stock in small increments when you see the stock on the downside. Eventually you will be rewarded."
Bank of America Securities upgraded to buy. Hopefully overall markets will keep it afloat today...
Time to load up the truck.
The float is being shorted 29.7%!? holy smokes. I’ll wait for this to hit rock bottom and buy in
Congrats to those that bought in today.
"This stock clearly lacks ammo. Even with CHWY suffering, it's not able to move in and capture market share.WOOF price is not going to move up unless another company decides that it makes for an attractive takeover target."
Does anybody know what is going on with this Dog? Is time to cover short or keep shorting?
#WallStreetBets would love this type of action. $RMO and #WOOF for that matter both look as though short interest around 30%
I’m holding strong as this stock/company will get the credit it is earning soon. Added again at 20.85. Will start selling at 25.00. Sell until I cut current holdings in half then hold for a long run. Good luck all!
who let the dogs out woof woof
They need to accelerate the store remodels…taking too long. Need to sell all the awful product they had at discount and transition to new offerings and health care. Long range prospects are awesome. Load up now.
"This always happens, I buy and it goes down lol"
The race with chewy n petco will be how they handle supply chain issues.
This stock has failed to perform since its offering. Im confused how so many people think its still a good idea to buy in. I dont care what you read on here just look at the performance.
Teenie bopper
stayed above 22. that's great
"Insider Monkey reported today that the number of hedge funds buying Petco recently, has risen by 25."
"very easy choice, pets every where, stores every where , insider buying no stopping industry, $37.50 before end of year, very strong ceo"
"here we come""SHORTS"" the reddit guys will push price over$25"
"If you have never experience PETCO than it’s worth the trip. I don’t own a pet, just fish yet wherever I go there’s a smile, how are you, etc. I’m in for other reasons, the transitional side just makes this stock more enjoyable to own. And hopefully profit from."
This dog better be good to its owners today. Otherwise No treats.
I am wondering the financial result
"I’m holding because Petco is a good name, and people are over indulgent with their pets. Me being one of them."
 whooo$30
"According to CNBC, WOOF is the most shorted stock on the market at 108%."
Finally some positive momentum!!!
under valued...hold long and strong

Comical - market manipulators try every headfake to push a good stock down when retail investors buy in.Guess what - I’ll buy some PUTs to make some money while I acquire more and more shares for the long run.
"Looks like someone is about to let the dogs out, woof...woof... woof woof!"
buying this stock was a mistake
"What other forums do you use to see conversations about stocks? This one is sometimes good, but I’d like other options. Ty!"
CHWY is about to crush this stock after their earnings report
Petco has a new partnership with DoorDash same day delivery. I like dog food.
When i bought FB onIPO it dropped from 30 to 20 and i sold. If i kept them i would not be typing here.WOOF I decided to Hold
Awesome just loaded up
"Cramer interview w/ CEO ! Nice!!1) 3.54 B Rev 2)21.5 m customers/ picked up 1m in 3rd QTR3)1470 Centers4) 26,000 Partners5)Same day Delivery are 30% of rev. / 3.3 million new pets 2020"
"Go WOOF GO! I may need to get some ""Cheap Sunglasses"" your future is so bright! I think we'll open above $22 tomorrow looking at the current futures!Then we move closer to $25 by Friday... Go WOOF Go!!!"
I'm buying into earnings.
I bought WOOF because I thought that having the medical clinics in the store were going to set them apart. I hope that happens eventually. I go to Petco all the time and the sales staff at my Petco store is phenomenal.
"Upgrades should start pouring in, the rest of the week..,"
"great company, definitely going up"
The worst stock ever!!! woof woof woof
In at 29
Shorts really don't want to see this go higher
WOOF $25 on the horizon
"Not sure how to feel about Woof?Here's a fun little exercise: Just go to Chart and Click the 1 month view, Hmmm...Next, Do the same with Chewy.If you have been Long Woof, you might feel -- Yes, I knew I was Right!!And ya are. - Growing Omnipresence in Online Sales and Loyalty Rewards along with actual Grooming stations and Veterinarian Services - Yes, WOOF is Coming on.Yes Chwy has been overvalued. One is losing in Double Digits (Chwy) And one is Coming on in Baby steps, Not losing Ground (Woof) Can't WAIT for Next Earning Date!"
"finally, it reached 25"
Maybe a downgrade will help. Upgrades sure haven’t.
The trend is going up from now!
Meanwhile CHWY has a 37 Billion dollar market cap...this market is so crooked.
Chewy is killing this company and will continue to do so. Interesting they never say how many pet hospitals they will add. Their stores are too small for that. Not going to happen. All hype.
"WOOF: 80 million float. +/- 25% Short. Quarterly Earnings Growth (yoy) 909.40%, Quarterly Revenue Growth (yoy) 18.70%Have a nice day!"
"Smash Shorts!!!! Yes,let's go to $ 30+ "
Back to 25
"one very smart investor in there""BUYING today, watch how he buys X thousands of shares and backs away for 3 or 4 hours, I'm buying every day up to $27"
$WOOF $WOOF $WOOF !!! --- Petco at 35% short interest & rising its very ripe for a short squeeze
"Buckle up for the ride up. All aboard, except for Tom and Pete."
Keep shorting as WOOF is going higher and higher￼. WOOF WOOF
Petco typically not the leader in pets supply in most markets. The potential Is still enormous. I would recommend a rigorous quality improvement program for the stores. Need to be super clean and sales staff buttoned up and we could prosper.
$WOOF broke 50 dma $$$!!!!
"there is strong uptrend expected until $50, if you do the math on fundamentals"
Great conf call. Lt shareholders should listen
$WOOF about to break out to $25..... above 50 sma
"With all the attention being on RBLX, WOOF has made a nice little run this week."
Short interest on WOOF is approx 35%; how much longer will the short will try to keep this down? And for what reason?
$WOOF
"Crazy low prices right now, this is a must buy below $26 which was the entry point for the public on Thursday. Great hold here just remember it’s not only Petco the entire market has been going down the past few days. Expect a big spike this week don’t lose miss out"
just a matter of time before shorts bail on wood. company progress gaining steam every day.
Imagine panic selling 3 days into a new IPO.
WOOF is up 5.50% to 23.96
retail sales numbers are up. look it up.$23.00+ on deck.
They had some interesting insights about WOOF on (http://Rightpicker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"just keeps going up a little every day,watch the forward statement on eps release, ceo insider buying easy money ,dogs every where.lots of cash on balance sheet"
Making Petco a health and wellness company is going to be a huge positive in the ER tomorrow. More gains coming!
Buy and Hold !
WOOF - WOOF is accumulating bones! Relax Son.
invested in this company since late feb and early match with 5000 shares...now I really start challenging my judgement with this type of performance. it had a great results and strong guidance last week. But it seems that it doesn't matter or related with its stock performance....maybe it just another Walmart which doesn't worth long term holding...
"This wasn't the only stock to fall today, it was part of a broader market sentiment when many good names lost 3-6%. There's no need to panic."
"This deal seems a little sketchy to me. I’ve reached out to IR for better understanding. Not sure if it is dilutive and only benefitting a major shareholder not the company. Uh, I’d like to issue more shares and rake in some cash too. Maybe that’s too simplistic."
bought call option right before close. We will see how it turns out. Too many bag holder though. 55% institutional ownership and recentl offering at $24. I hope it doesn't turn into CLOV at the open tomorrow
"Bullish... With pandemic and increasing pets by 10X times, it will grow by at least 4x by end of this year!"
It’s odd to me this board gets so little traffic
Is there a Walmart buy out?
like WOOF business and CEO dedication - added 500 shares today for long term
"Looking at Chewy and missed it, now hoping for some growth here in WOOF."
"Looking at CHWY’s numbers WOOF is looking like a steal, easy buy and hold 5X opportunity here."
Soon this stock will jump to $50 it’s not hard to see. I’m in at 28.
"Ceo takes his dog to work every single day, great guy, great company!"
"with the current WOOF store locations and product mix, if they would add mobile service including grooming, auto routine pet food delivery, plus potential mobile pet medical service, they would be unstopable."
Petco will recover soon. stores crowded and growing. financials are beating the street.
Can someone explain why the optimism on this stock and what catalyst to explain potential price jump from current levels. I am a prospective investor and can’t find data to help me with my investment decision
"What a joke, this should be $25 today, at the least!"
Jim Cramer talking about it . This is going to fly !
Charts saying WOOF is a nice buy at &17.55 or below
buy lots of woof stock
Petco a great opportunity @ this price
WOOF should be flying tomorrow in $30s after earnings! Go  
In at 30. I'll play along...
"if like pet sector, it is worth holding it for long... added 200 shares today for long"
Everything is red today. Before a holiday. It will bounce back and it will bounce quick . Stay put . Look into peck aswell.
I brought WOOF is one of the better values on wall street! And they have the steady earnings to back it up! Pet business is good even in a recession! Not selling a single share for years!
WOOF.....WOOF!!
I can’t believe CHWY is up $8 and we are in the negative￼
petco going up! $23 at least today!
Wait till Cramer changes his view on WOOF tonight! You just can't ignore a great business model and sequential quarter gains the way WOOF has performed! See you at $25! Unreal you can still buy WOOF under $20!!!!
this by far the worst performer in my entire portfolio kinda disappointing i had moderate hopes this was a 35-45$ stock im a long term holder
I was telling my wife my loser stock is Petco and her response was when she recently visited a local Petco store it was dirty and shelves half empty. She left and hit Pet Smart and said it was clean and shelves were full and she found what she was looking for. I still own the stock but maybe not for long. I hate selling a stock when down 25% but I’m afraid it could down a lot more soon. Pet sells are through the roof the past year so how is this company losing the battle so badly?????
great hold today and business are good
"Thanks guy, loaded October 1st call options. Good luck and see you green shortly"
yo can these guys at least get morty and maple to go spend money there?
I didn't sell any of WOOF shares.... it is one of the only brick mortar in Pet sectors...I will hold for long... I feel the dog populations is about 70% of human in US.... I believe 80% of family has at least one dog in US... great business for long
"People already mentioned it below, but I wanna make sure that new people to this thread know that the CEO bought over $1 million worth of shares on Tuesday last week. Great sign of confidence. If you are new to the thread, this is a great opportunity to get in!"
Petco Health and Wellness Company is up 6.94% to 21.38
"Hi - I'm a shareholder in Petco and want to see if a class action suit can be filed against them. They recently announced very good earnings and than had a conference call to discuss. A day or two later they announced a secondary stock offering that caused the stock price to plummet. I believe they knew of this offering prior to the conference call and had a responsibility to disclose such during the call. I have lost over $20,000 so far"
"Raised capital for what I would imagine...upgrade stores, install sales programs and develop a competitive web presence. Great space to be in."
"Do we think this has hit its fair value yet? $25 seemed like were it wanted to go, but perhaps it has found a solid base around $28?"
Over bought
Good investment both short and long term.
I bought some shares early on and have always wanted to add more. I was hoping for a dip and it looks like I found one. I’ll be watching this closely and will add more when the selling pressure subsides. GL all! Build your own pet ETF! $WOOF $PETS $CHWY $STIC $PAWZ
I heard about WOOF the other day on (http://Rightpicker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
Pet owners looking for a personal touch which they don't get online. Chewy is losing market share while Petco is booming. So many shares short as a percent of the float bodes well for longs.
Eddie with Woof Woof
"Lol keep reporting me, but the fact is. They have shown growth of sales to $1.4 Billion and even a profit in a growing industry. Brick and mortar has more costs yes, but it also offers more avenues of income other companies do not, such as: grooming, training and vet health Clinique for pets in emergency’s. Stores can also be used to ship products locally at reduced costs as well. WOOF offers a pretty comprehensive online store as well. I don’t see why so much negativity here, so I assume there are just many shorts taking advantage of a newly tradable stock."
"Looks like the Teens might be gone for good, it should slowly but steadily climb to a fair valuation comparable to Chewy."
Hold Tight... 50 coming soon!

If you are long you have to remember not everyone is long. There are traders who will take profit so don't get frustrated if the stock has pull backs. It's not going straight to 30. If it did I would sell myself and I'm long. Pullbacks are healthy. Add to you position on pullbacks.

Operating income up 84%--The market is paying up for growth.CHWY not even profitableWOOF profitableIPO proceeds will pay down the debt and profit goes to the bottom line.If they can show growth---this is a 60.00 plus play...
Who sold the shares?!!! Now?!!!
I believe the silent periods ends this week(2-8) on Woof. analysts can come out with their ratings.
“Earning call” on yahoo doesn’t mean earnings report will be given. It’s the expected date for the company to announce report date.
"Waiting for bottoming,then buy more!"
"Came out same day as CHWY last year, was a slow start too but is now past $100. Petco is a huge national corporation, don’t stress about a slow IPO day "
"never chase the runs in this stock. Everyone is expecting this to go much higher, and it will, but the game on is to short these runs to make double on the way up. it would be less stressful if we could break up this game by letting the stock settle and build along the way. I would love if the reverse happened and the shorts got caught at the end of the run, but its prudent to buy cheap."
This is going to explode everday from now. Buy buy buy
Do not sell!!!! $26 on realistic horizon!
Once I get to $21.65 I am out for good and will never look back and will delete WOOF from my portfolio￼. Good luck to us all longs
I think...I hope a deal with Walmart...perhaps a buyout is in the offing.
Bought $100k total of $BARK and $WOOF today
"I love my dog,"
this dog dont hunt!!! run forest run!
Who bought the last dip?
"I’ve been day trading for years and I’m so glad I finally found (http://Thetraderguide.com). They’re pre-market watchlists cover all the latest market-moving news, and they don’t beat you down with tons of ads. Highly recommend!"
"All, I’ve read few Google articles all petco’s stocks and its competitors. Based on my own analogy I’ve bought WOOF $29.75 last week considering low price. However on past Friday AH it went down! Hope WOOF trades much higher tomorrow since it’s price is much lower than it’s competitors."
Woof stole the market share from Chewy. Good news
SELLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL here now.................................me wait for low teens
bought at 29.2 so disappointed with its performance
—My last purchase at $17.92 was just *luck.￼ that’s about as close as you’d ever hope/*guess to come to the low.￼ see ya at $31+ Love it!
Woof is no start up or wanna be big dog. This is the real deal and they are quickly transforming the industry.
this dog is about to hunt the shorts!!! let's go!!!
Time to cover Tom.
Citi upgrade with 31 PT!
Played the ipo hype and lost. Thought for sure this would’ve been a winner. Guess I’ll be long here for awhile...
$WOOF=7.41B and $CHWY=33.11B. eazy peezy. Prediction: Petco will own Chewy eventually.
I'm buying today. this company is growing and beating on earnings consistently.
Back to TEENS ..again.
SELLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLget out NOW. headed for teens again.
What possibly is there not to like about PETCO?
NO Upside here..back to TEENS.
Rolling now get on board the dog train
Before the Bell tomorrow! Pet supply store Petco Health and Wellness (WOOF) will report Q2 earnings before the market opens tomorrow 08/19/2021.
2 dollars in 5mins
I am bullish on Petco (WOOF). I think it is a solid buy in the $20 - $24 range with a short term upside of $31 which makes it very attractive.
Should I buy at this price? Or do you think it’ll dip and better opportunity ? Don’t be harsh please I’m fairly new to this!
"Now $30, next stop $40"
Lesson learned. I bought this way too high on its first day of trading. Never again.
And back to red we go !
WOOF will hit $30 after earnings this month.
"wiht current Chwy earning, Chewy has $7B Revenue with loss at market cap $33 B... WOOF is $5B revenue with market cap $7B.... WOOF is much cheaper and definitely worth holding long"
"like usual, we get to buy at an inflated price because we are not insiders."
"Let’s fly to $40... Additionally, data from meme stock tracker Swaggy Stocks indicates that interest and sentiment toward WOOF are quite positive, with the stock amassing more than 12% of the comments on the WSB forum while sentiment is very positive. This could support the continuation of this current positive momentum as, to some extent, there is a fundamental case to be made about WOOF at $40 per share. Source: Economywatch JUNE 15, 2021"
always a sell off after earnings 
Easy double chance at these prices.
"Old data, but. 9.91% of Float Short, Short interest 14.88M. Open interest in the 8/20 dte of 3760 Put side 17-19. 12/17 dte next largest volume. Looks like it might be a long slow slog, we shall see what action brings the bell."
$WOOF is Petco = $$$$$$
Look for a buyout soonsingle digits.
"Sit back and enjoy the 3-5% each day, steady climb to $40 by year end!"
$WOOF $UPWK $PINS can't trust this anymore!
"This deserves to be sold but funny thing is right after you sell your holdings, the stock will soar."
Who’s ready for earnings! 1290 shares here. Ready to be on a tropic beach somewhere...

did anyone notice someone invested 2 million shares 2 times to bring this stock somewhat back from the depths?
why did you buy the stock in the first place*1-you believed in the company and its fundamentals.2-you bought the hybe .3-you have no idea why you bought it.having said that its not the first or the last company to drop 10 or 20 percent. i for one i believe in company good luck to all longs
We had a nice day my fellow Woofers! A little pullback but that is normal. Remember we Woofers would never sell our dogs so why would we sell our Woof stock? Lets hold to 100 and higher!!

$6B cap with $5B above revenue - very good ROI and valuation...but its stock price is not up...Can they sell to amazon? I am sure Amazon would love add its prime store locations plus unique pet sectors on its portfolios.Chewy is $7B with $35B market cap..ridiculous plus it has no store locations...
$Chwy overvalue$woof undervalue
"I buy this stock on the dips. I’m a big fan of Petco. I bought two Chihuahua puppies last month, and I spoil them, as Petco makes it affordable to do so. I bought some puppy food and easter toys yesterday for curbside pickup. And I’m not done shopping; I have chew toys and a lounge mat in my cart right now. I’m taking advantage of their sale that currently beats the competition. I use the Petco app mostly, as I find it user friendly. Right now, Petco has a 25% off deal that’s automatically applied at checkout if your order is over $50 and for curbside pickup."
"This dog can’t walk, I am loosing my patience."
above 22 a share finally
PetCo margins are 42% while chewy is 27%. Obviously PetCo CEO was right in using stores as distribution and same day delivery with doordash deal . In store and curbside margins the best. Chewy has to ship those giant bags of dog/cat food while PetCo uses its network for much higher profit margins. Chewy needs to come down and PetCo needs to go up. I bought more PetCo today at 21.09 this thing is way oversold.

We maintain our target of $40 by end of year.
"Looks like our projected revenue for the year is $6+ billion and we are even coming out with positive earnings, yet we are trading around $7b. Fundamentals looks strong, going to $30+ "
"Great report, looks like a little pre market manipulation going on but this should fly in the next few weeks!"
"own the shares, sell the calls - long, stable, dividend(eventually) - Not growth stock. part of diverse portfolio."
This is my first ipo buy in. I wish all those that bought in as well a successful and profitable year.
Patience...wait til lock down period is over and all the profit takers shake out....then buy it.
And home delivery execution is going well.
moment I sell it will start climbing
"Own the stock as have been a customer and find they excel in selling great products you cannot find at other pet stores. When my dog was ill, I was advised to put her on foods, other products I found a large variety of at Petco. For her sensitive skin, I found the best shampoos at Petco. Even tho its not in a glamorous neighborhood, I shopped here over everywhere else for the largest variety of specialty needs and found the best selection at great price."
Chewy is tanked. It is crazy that WOOF's market cap is $6.7 B with Revenue $6B plus it has brick mortar and profitable. This company shall be worth $12B market Cap with stock price around $40.. way under valued..
"Beat earnings, earnings growth , Future looks good ; the stock still took a beating today ??? What is it the so called smart money does not like about Petco"
