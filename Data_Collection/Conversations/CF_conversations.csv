B of A raise price target to 67
"CF stock price seems very attractive at these levels. Some forecast of a weaker second half due to slowing global economy. However, people got to eat, What else do you guys like out there? Bought some MOS on the pullback the other day.https://www.dtnpf.com/agriculture/web/ag/crops/article/2021/07/21/potash-hits-highest-price-8-years"
Anyone know the problem with CF? Big drop in price on high volume. I don't see any news.

blowout earnings today
Yara Intl (YARIY) is another good leading indicator that CF is doing just fine. Yara is a nitrogen fertilizer producer out of Norway and is often a company that CF compares itself during their quarterly presentations. Yara announced their earnings last week which were superb. Not only did they announced an extraordinary dividend distribution. Yara also generates excellent free cash flow like CF. They said that their India plant is performing well amid the COVID-19 so I imagine the circumstances would not be wildly different for CF. Yara stock was at $20 at the beginning of the year while CF was at $45. Yara stands at $17 today while CF at $26. On a relative basis Yara is down 15% YTD while CF is down 42% YTD. I expect to see the stock move up on earnings and the company should execute on their buyback program if the stock remains here. Right now they are under a blackout rule until earnings are announced plus two days.
"@Sandy OK, I am feeling much better today since this is moving up instead of down for the first time since I have owned it. You know me from the BG board too. I just wonder if it is finally moving because the overall market is up (S&P), or is that press release about Ammonia production for Hydrogen Energy, causing some green investment interest? I really can't believe that is moving the needle for this big company. Either way, I will be happy to tell my friends I am going green! That is actually a joke if you knew me."
"1) Crossing Overbought line ... .. 2) NG price too high that it will ""eat"" into Q3 profit 3) P/E about 29 that is way over Chemical P/E average of 19.Time to taking profit now before it too late. Will see it back to around 50 again."
China is buying the US corn crop. Price up 6% today on drop in expected ending inventory
Ag super cycle is underway. Clear sailing for at least 2 years.
It touched almost 47 just yesterday. 7% fall. Incredible.
"I am long here but I have to tell you, I would have predicted that the price of Natural Gas would have killed this stock (not the company) at least near term. I guess the pricing of Nitrogen is keeping up with Nat Gas? Oddly enough, I hate to hear the word hedged as a Natural Gas investor, but I hope CF is hedged on lower gas prices than $5.00!"
"Yesterday, during the 4th qtr conference call, management referenced buying back stock in the low 40's. Well, I hope today they're backing up the truck and loading up with the stock being $41.35 at the time of this writing!"
"Has anyone here looked into UAN? They are small and thinly traded, but their upside is much greater than CF. They already have Blue ammonia and trade at a huge discount. They are my biggest holding and I think the upside is incredible. If you believe in CF, you should take a look at UAN."
It seems like this stock wants to move higher that it's 52 week high. Might have to wait until the next earnings release.
The stock is undervalued and people don’t understand the tremendous free cash flow that is being generated. Blue ammonia is going to be big and CF is well positioned to prosper. You will not be able to time when investors decide to join the party. Just go long term and collect your nice dividend yield in the meantime.
"I'm no analyst...Seems like the CEO is saying buy this puppy! I might have to go above my 10% allocation for CF in my portfolio. Am I missing something here? Statements from CEO W. Anthony Will.""In the past 12 months, a highly volatile period that included very low prices, our employees remained focused on operational excellence, and as a result, we're able to generate nearly $900 million in free cash flow over that time."""" We retired $1.1 billion in high interest debt, paid $280 million in dividends to our stockholders, invested in additional North American production by repurchasing the publicly traded common units of Terra Nitrogen Company for $388 million, repurchased $90 million worth of our shares, and still ended this quarter with more than $1 billion of cash on the balance sheet.""""But I think in the near-term back to Dennis' comments earlier, we view our shares as being a tremendous value right now...""""And our other alternatives are buying our shares back, we believe it's very attractive value...""""Longer term, we believe global market fundamentals will continue to enable CF Industries to generate significant cash through the foreseeable future."""" Along with our consistent operational performance, this should further strengthen our cash generation, and allow us to create significant shareholder value."""
$70 coming
Why is CF sharply lower in a surging market???
"Favorable comments and improving outlook for CF today. Have been accumulating for the past 6 months, which hasn't been easy riding CF down. CF is well position with production capacity, distribution network, operating cost, div yield, stock buybacks and FCF to return to pre-covid levels and beyond."
I follow cf for years .. very good growth company.. previous high $250. Or thereabouts then one for five forwards split ..then it drop to $22.00 ..
$8 corn and $20 beans by December with the dry hot weather. Huge sales of fertilizer coming.
CF can buy nat gas from us market for EU production
(http://Stocks-tracker.com) is a must for any trader. Their watchlist which covers pre-market movers is one of the best researched in the industry. I don’t start trading without reading their daily email each morning!
"most AN sold in spring so most of nat gas used in spring, must be over reaction"
we will run past $50 this week
this stock is as undervalued as xxxx. Maybe should push to reddit to get some proper value.
CF should have a nice tailwind from last q's beneficial input costs. This company is well off its yearly high and has plenty of cash flow and should continue buying stock and funding its nice div on its way back to the mid 30's
I have been an occasional poster on this board over the years. I have been a supporter of CF management recognizing the efficiency of the operations and financial management. Over the years my CF position grew to about 12% of my portfolio by accumulating in the low 20's to mid 40's. Three weeks ago I sold my entire CF positions. One critical factor in my decision to unwind CF was the lost opportunity of capital gains from having such a large position in CF. Over the past three weeks the capital gains I realized from unwinding my CF position has out performed my capital gains from being long CF for the past few years. CF is a well run company that the market seems to ignore. I will continue to watch CF and hopefully take another position in mid October before 3rd qtr earnings release in early November. Perhaps CF should not be as focused on stock buybacks and paying down as much debt as it has. Imagine if half of those dollars allocated for buybacks and debt reduction were returned directly to the shareholders through dividends. I hope to acquire a position in CF again; just before more FCF is directed to its dividend. GLTA!
"CF tailwinds. 1) because urea prices have been so low for the past 6 years, new supply has been short of ever growing demand. Late last year the markets figured that out,i.e. demand was even with or exceeded supply and urea prices started up. Each year to meet growing demand a $4b plant that takes about 4 years to build needs to come online. That has not been happening. 2) Nat gas in EU have tripled and so has the prices of coal in China. From the news it appears that it's not profitable or barely profitable for both EU and China to produce urea. That puts further pressure on urea prices. 3) Grain stocks are at a 10 year low. This should lead to more acres of corn and more N fertilizer applied to existing acres. So in 2011&2012 when urea was $500 a ton CF made $5.72 per share. Since that time N production per CF share has doubled. Some from share buybacks and some from increased production. I can't say CF's earnings could double from here for one because nat gas was cheaper in 2011-2012, could they make $8 or $9 per share, possibly, even if it trades for 8x that's still $72 a share. My math says, assuming urea stays in at this price range, that CF is trading at a 30% FCF forward yield. Do your own DD, but it's all easy to see looking at their quarterly presentations which are some of the best in the market."
Fertilizer prices including UAN and Urea have been ripping all quarter.CF earnings are guaranteed blowout.May 5th is going to be HUGE!Green ammonia story is the long term bonus story as well....
anyone know why CF is dropping?
"Here WE Go, Back up to 47.00"
"I came across some excellent commentary regarding strong urea demand from India. Bodes well for CF. Investors are not paying enough attention to this company. August saw two, back-to-back India tenders as government buying agencies struggled to keep up with high farmer demand following a late start to purchases this year due to COVID-19. Seasonal rains continued to support strong fertilizer demand in India, and a lack of exports from China drove prices higher through the month, culminating in the purchase of 1.7 mmt of urea to end August.The Egypt FOB price rose to $280/mt, up $20-$30 from July prices following higher prices achieved from the India tenders, which until August, had been far below before moving in line with prices at this time last year. Brazil prices strengthened to a lesser degree, ending August around $5 higher to $268-$275/mt CFR as the country is in between crops at the moment and quiet, similar to the U.S.Overall, the international market was quiet and watched India for indications on where prices would move. Higher prices did indeed follow, though to a lesser degree in the U.S. during this seasonally slow period. In the short term, our outlook on international urea is stable to soft, with India expected to call for more of the global supply in the coming weeks."

"I don't have the background to infer I'm able to analyze a stock. I do spend a considerable amount of time reading different analyst reports. When it comes to CF, there is a consensus among those that do proclaim to be analytical this company generates considerable free cash flow. That cash flow has been used to expand capacity significantly, pay down debt and share buy backs. Apparently, there is a senior note of $500m due in May of 2020 at 7.125%. It appears that CF is building up some dry powder to pay this off which will add put CF's balance sheet in a stronger position. There is the thought that CF should increase the dividend to reward shareholders. I would be in favor of a dividend increase, but, I am patient and am willing to wait until this cash cow throws off more direct cash to it's shareholders. In the meantime, keep buying back share and keeping some powder dry to payoff another $500m."
Food shortages will drive fertilizer to records.
"Direct hit to the Donaldsonville facility, as it appears. The largest facility in the fleet. I hope all will be OK!"
"A significant price surge, which DTN designates #$%$ or more, occurred in each of the past three weeks for all eight of the fertilizers DTN tracks.

Barons good read Farming Appears to be the Place to Look for Growth in the Second Half
"@gary @Sandy Looks like the huge spike in Natural Gas is taking its toll on CF today. I guess I can live with that because I own a lot more Nat Gas stocks than CF or Yara. Gary, what it the best place for me to track Anhydrous Ammonia pricing and is that the main this that I would want to look at for Nitrogen fertilizer?? What about UAN or is that the same thing? I track tons of commodities from Corn, Soybeans, to Aluminum and Iron Ore, Oil & Gas, but I never see UAN or Nitrogen fertilizer?"
Anyone have a good explanation for the recent run-up? Based on the price of N. Fert. and Urea and expected flat future earnings I'm wondering if this is just another temporary run-up until it once again trades back down to the mid to high 20s.
"Markets are a real-time weighing machine. Futile to fight daily/weekly/market moves. Be a scale, measure earning power. Sure the China/coal and EU/natty high prices relative to USA natty will be solved fairly shortly and take the top out of the N fert market. What can't be solved quickly is the imbalance in supply and demand also the 10 year low in grain inventories. Even at the peak of corn harvest pressure, corn is still over $5 a bushel. Yes, some days USA natty goes up, joe trader takes some provides, EFTs that hold CF have to sell, indiscernable influences. Yes, the top will come out of N fert market, but N fert prices will be elevated for quite a while and analysts will keep boosting EPS almost weekly."
52W high!
Monster earnings. 1.26 per share 2nd quarter versus 0.81 expected. High 50's by end of August.
Anhydrous ammonia keeps going up - $743 per ton. CF is printing %
Expect a very nice surprise and a bunch of buyback this last qtr at about $27 million $ a month and CF was in low $20's a while. Rain fall was up thru first 6 months which will require more fert use also.
hh-+
"Sold naked $27 puts for $1.11. I already own CF (700 shares), but my goal is to acquire more at these cheap prices if assigned. If not assigned, I will still add more shares. The world got to eat, and commodities are bound to go higher with infinite money printing. Thats my bullish thesis, and I'm sticking to it."
"New deal between CF and UK Government (keeping the Billingham plant running through at least January, despite high gas prices) October 11th 2021(Bloomberg) -- The U.K. food and drink industry averted the threat of a fresh carbon-dioxide supply crisis after agreeing to pay more for the gas from fertilizer company CF Industries Holdings Inc., which makes it as a byproduct.With a three-week government-brokered solution about to end, a U.K. subsidiary of CF Industries reached an agreement on CO2 pricing with customers to allow it to keep its Billingham site running through at least January. That will secure output of the gas used in everything from food processing to the nuclear power sector while prices for natural gas -- a key fertilizer feedstock -- remain high, the government said."
"Looks like nitrogen will double again this year. No fertilizer, no corn"
closing down UK facilities due to high ng price.
earnings look super!!!! WHAT IS HOLDING THE STOCK BACK?
"Anyone else notice how CF seems to be trading in conjunction with China trade rumors? Seems when a rumor starts that the US and China will re-open trade discussions, CF goes down (China dumping urea, etc. in US). When there are no discussions and tariffs are likely to be applied, CF goes up. Anyone else notice this trade?"
50 ..now what folks?
"Corn and wheat prices moving up nicely over the last month. According to DTN the three fertilizers that were slightly higher include DAP with an average price of $439/ton, up $8; MAP $459/ton, up $17; and urea $362/ton, up $1. UREA being up is a very good sign. India (INDA) is up too indicating economy is picking up there. I would expect CF to start moving up as investors recognize the improvement in pricing."
"OK, I am new here. I just bought in at prices ranging from 31 to high 29s over the month of Oct. Is there some underlying problem with this company that I don't know about? Perhaps I have caught another falling knife? Is it only weak as of late because the price of natural gas is going up? Could it be that simple? I suspect natural gas is going much higher in the next 60 days. Is that a good reason to not by more CF at these levels? I know very little about Ag companies. The only other one I own is BG and I realize it is different than a fertilizer company."

You would think the fert market had collapsed instead of a potential supercycle of strong pricing
Would love to know what the net subsidy is that CF is getting to off-set their Nat Gas cost
CF Holdings seems like a hidden gem that many have missed while the stock has been down due to the pandemic. People still need to eat and nitrogen fertilizer is a necessary input for crop farmers. This business is kind of boring so it's not like Amazon or Netflix so maybe that's while they're overlooked. They are low cost producers and generate excellent cash flow. Management runs the business well. They pay a nice dividend yield of 4.4%. The stock could easily run back up to $45-50. If you go to the company's website there are some excellent presentations outlining what they do and some financial valuation.
 was up 6.42% today 
International ammonia prices spiked up. Not sure if it’s a trend yet.
"Sounds very goodCorn prices surged another 2.5% Friday, closing out its best week in four years and climbing to five-year highs. Worries over late plantings and plenty more wet weather ahead continue to create significant tailwinds. July futures gained 11 cents to $4.53, with September futures up 10.5 cents to $4.5825.Corn basis bids continued to come in steady to firm across the central U.S. Friday, rising 1 to 8 cents across interior river terminals and up 5 cents at an Indiana ethanol plant today.Private exporters reported to USDA the sale of 4.9 million bushels of corn for delivery to unknown destinations during the 2019/20 marketing year, which begins September 1.Turkey has purchased 3.9 million bushels of corn in a series of provisional international tenders that closed earlier today, from optional origins."
Any word on what is causing today’s increase?
"A few days ago when Zack showed a strong buy rank #1, I promptly sold. When Zack has a stock ranked #5 Strong Sell, it will be worth while to follow the stock for a possible purchase. I bought CF when Zack said sell it and I sold CF when Zack said strong buy it. Thank you Zack (no need to say that they are a bunch of geniuses)."
Jet stream tailwinds
"CF reports soon and I think it is worth reading through the Yara conference transcript which is CF's closest competitor. @gary I would not read too much into FMC's announcements as I don't recall them being cited as a close comp. Correct me if this is wrong. Yara management said they feel we are now in a demand driven market versus a supply drive market due to rising prices which is positive. They were questioned about rising fuel costs and maintaining a margin, which they said yes. CF presented last quarter a EBITDA sensitivity to natural gas and urea. Everything has been moving up so CF should have a positive outlook. Also, on the Yara call there were lots of questions surround blue ammonia. It sounds like a lot of investment is going on in this direction. Yara stock price has been moving up the past few days.Here's the link to the Yara transcript.https://seekingalpha.com/article/4404645-yara-international-asa-yariy-ceo-svein-tore-holsether-on-q4-2020-results-earnings-call"
"CF: I started a hedge fund 30 years ago. Engineering background. Turns out, accurate predictions about the future are almost impossible. Tomorrow or the next minute are driven by an extreme amount of unknown and unknowable variables. True genius is finding the simplest thing possible with almost no variables or else sitting on your hands."
"like uranium, commodity hoarding will begin..usual suspects...china, russia and the rest of the world will panic..wish I could buy more"
"OK, is anyone buying more here? This is getting scary especially when I see MOS up today. I realize they produce a different product but still in the same sector."
This is crazy 47 yesterday now 43.78-with upgrades. What am I missing?
KABOOM = good grain prices and good yields means farmers are pre-ordering nitrogen like crazy
"CF reported and continued to generate excellent numbers. Their margins were good and their ability to generate significant free cash flow in this environment is evidence why this company is well managed and worth owning as an investor. The future outlook looks positive with corn planting looking decent. India demand up. Compared to their peers they are low cost, efficient producers by looking at their ppt slides (which btw are very detailed compared to many companies). I do wish they had purchased back some stock when it fell into the mid 20's. This stock could easily bounce back into the 40's and 50's pre-COVID. The dividend yield is 3.5%. The company is simply underfollowed in my opinion."
Why does this thing go down much faster than it goes up? S&P is at all-time high and this thing is 20% BELOW it's high of just a few weeks ago!
"Berenberg raises pt to 60, rating to buy."
"During the conf call , mgt said they were buying back stock and also returned to shareholders the respective amts of the dividend payment....as if this was something wonderful. Meanwhile all the stock does is go down. Is mgt aware that investors purchase stock primarily for the appreciation in stk price. My read is mgt buys the stock back so they dont have to pay the divid yield. Isnt that wonderful for an investor. Note to MGT: if you wish to reward shareholders, increase the dividend or invest in growth."
I tired of getting more opportunities to buy CF at a good price. Time for price appreciation. Let's increase the dividend and stop the buybacks.
"Bunge reported this morning excellent numbers, which bodes well for CF who will report next week. While not in the same business segments as CF it is a related peer group company. Remember, CF is in the S&P500 so it will trade down with the market. I expect CF to report decent numbers as usual, showing strong cash flow from operations. Management is really skilled at cranking out free cash flow despite different agri-market conditions. Looks like a good buying opportunity in spite of poor stock price action. Business fundamentals still intact. India is back with tenders. Bunge said in its earnings press release, ""In Fertilizer, we now expect full-year adjusted results to be slightly higher than last year."" This is good supporting outlook for CF.Bunge (BG) – The agriculture commodities company reported adjusted quarterly earnings of $2.47 per share, compared to a consensus estimate of 20 cents a share. Revenue came in above estimates as well. Bunge saw strong demand for oilseed processing and soy products, and the company lifted its full-year outlook. The shares rose 6% in premarket trading as of 7:40 a.m. ET."

"Like I said , they will need over a billion in buy backs to prop this stock up. Too many sellers."
Blow out earnings Aug. 9. Ammonia prices have doubled over 2020.
"Did I read it correctly, they missed earning a little and the stock was down pre market and now it's pushing higher......."
"CF came in a little light but not unexpected. the recent updated analysts had around a 7-10 cent loss. what is important to understand is the totally abnormal global natural price spread that happened due to the pandemic. Already, the spread is returning to a more normalized state. World economies are picking up with a vaccine coming on the horizon. the stock was at ~47 last year. With a 4.5% yield one can wait for a nice rebound. this is a well managed company."
"I've always felt selling stock is a far more difficult decision making process than taking on a position. Tax ramifications are a factor as you mentioned, but usually I usually don't worry too much about it. Maybe, that's because most of my investments are in retirement accounts. Therefore, hearing that others are selling simply for tax reasons only affirms my view of a buying opportunity. The FCF this company is generating is excellent in this environment. It really shows how well it is managed. I would like to see more insider purchasing by management (NOT issued via options)."
"CF Industries (CF) is a company that will play a big role in food security and mitigating climate change over the upcoming years. They manufacture and distribute nitrogen fertiliser, as well as other hydrogen and nitrogen products. These are used for clean energy, emissions abatement, fertiliser, and other industrial applications. From a financial perspective, the company looks strong in resuming positive earnings, after a slight slip into negative during 2017.Revenue for 2021 is estimated at a strong $4.38bn, recovering from a slight dip seen in 2020. Since 2015, total assets have remained around the same, recorded at $12.17bn in 2019. The company however decreased their debt from $5.54bn to $3.96bn during the same timeframe. This represents an improved and healthy liquidity at 0.325. Shares are currently $43.40, well below their record high of $68.92 in 2015."
Donaldsonville facility is up and running again.
"Time to fess up when one is wrong. I indicated that some analyst at Bernstein didn't know what he was talking about. Perhaps, I should have listen to him! My bad. However, I'm still adding."
"Anyone know why the gap up the last two days? 12/13 of June.......no news that I can see, must be a large hedge fund/etf/or Mutual fund building a position."
Why did CF go up? Analysts are finally figuring out what I posted 11 days ago. They are drastically behind in marking up earnings. CF could make $9 per share if they maintain such a high energy cost advantage. What price does urea have to get to such that China and the EU can make money shipping it here? Also how far is demand below supply and how long will it take for producers to increase supply?
If CF can break above $31 this week and stay there / slowly climb higher it will be great from a chart pattern perspective.
"US natural gas vs. EU nat gas vs. China Coal is only 1/3 of the story. The stock is trading like a inverse of US natural gas, but there are longer term issues at play here, the supply/demand is in CF's favor and so is the grain stocks. Corn as not been $5 per bushel during harvest pressure for almost 10 years."
"It does appear that this company is starting to trade in some correlation with Nat Gas. Gas is down some today and the stock is strong. @vman Not sure exactly what you mean when you say CF can buy U.S. gas for its European plants?? How does that work in reality? If you are talking LNG from the U.S., that trades with the European gas market as soon as it arrives. I love CF and I am excited for everyone. I also know much more about gas than I do fertilizer production."
anybody selling now is throwing away money!
Huge earnings beat! Will now cross 55 in a hurry.
after market today or tomorrow there will be bad news coming
I own 95% of the Jan 21 '22 $65 Call - Price paid... .30 (up 560%)!!! I also own 18% of the Jan 21 '22 $47.50 Call - Price Paid... .85 (up 660%)!!! It's going to be a wild year!!!The sky is the limit for CF Industries!
"Its yet another day with ugly commodity stocks. At least a few are bucking the trend but only up a little. ADM is holding up and INGR is too. What frustrates me the most is these big selloffs (yes, I consider over 4% off already depressed shares to be significant) is no news. What is specifically wrong with CF today??"
"@NYSE what are you thinking now on CF? Still time to buy more? I hate buying more at this price but I already made a mistake by selling my other fertilizer stock, YARIY. I bought that at 20 and sold at 22 and it is heading for 24 already. Same goes for MOS. I sold it way too soon. So it is CF or nothing for me in fertilizer space now. Higher natural gas prices may hurt CF but Nat Gas is still very low on a relative basis over 5 years."
