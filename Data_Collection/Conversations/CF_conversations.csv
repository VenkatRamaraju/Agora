closing down UK facilities due to high ng price.
"1) Crossing Overbought line ... .. 2) NG price too high that it will ""eat"" into Q3 profit 3) P/E about 29 that is way over Chemical P/E average of 19.Time to taking profit now before it too late. Will see it back to around 50 again."
"I am long here but I have to tell you, I would have predicted that the price of Natural Gas would have killed this stock (not the company) at least near term. I guess the pricing of Nitrogen is keeping up with Nat Gas? Oddly enough, I hate to hear the word hedged as a Natural Gas investor, but I hope CF is hedged on lower gas prices than $5.00!"
Jet stream tailwinds
"It does appear that this company is starting to trade in some correlation with Nat Gas. Gas is down some today and the stock is strong. @vman Not sure exactly what you mean when you say CF can buy U.S. gas for its European plants?? How does that work in reality? If you are talking LNG from the U.S., that trades with the European gas market as soon as it arrives. I love CF and I am excited for everyone. I also know much more about gas than I do fertilizer production."
"@gary @Sandy Looks like the huge spike in Natural Gas is taking its toll on CF today. I guess I can live with that because I own a lot more Nat Gas stocks than CF or Yara. Gary, what it the best place for me to track Anhydrous Ammonia pricing and is that the main this that I would want to look at for Nitrogen fertilizer?? What about UAN or is that the same thing? I track tons of commodities from Corn, Soybeans, to Aluminum and Iron Ore, Oil & Gas, but I never see UAN or Nitrogen fertilizer?"
"CF tailwinds. 1) because urea prices have been so low for the past 6 years, new supply has been short of ever growing demand. Late last year the markets figured that out,i.e. demand was even with or exceeded supply and urea prices started up. Each year to meet growing demand a $4b plant that takes about 4 years to build needs to come online. That has not been happening. 2) Nat gas in EU have tripled and so has the prices of coal in China. From the news it appears that it's not profitable or barely profitable for both EU and China to produce urea. That puts further pressure on urea prices. 3) Grain stocks are at a 10 year low. This should lead to more acres of corn and more N fertilizer applied to existing acres. So in 2011&2012 when urea was $500 a ton CF made $5.72 per share. Since that time N production per CF share has doubled. Some from share buybacks and some from increased production. I can't say CF's earnings could double from here for one because nat gas was cheaper in 2011-2012, could they make $8 or $9 per share, possibly, even if it trades for 8x that's still $72 a share. My math says, assuming urea stays in at this price range, that CF is trading at a 30% FCF forward yield. Do your own DD, but it's all easy to see looking at their quarterly presentations which are some of the best in the market."
"New deal between CF and UK Government (keeping the Billingham plant running through at least January, despite high gas prices) October 11th 2021(Bloomberg) -- The U.K. food and drink industry averted the threat of a fresh carbon-dioxide supply crisis after agreeing to pay more for the gas from fertilizer company CF Industries Holdings Inc., which makes it as a byproduct.With a three-week government-brokered solution about to end, a U.K. subsidiary of CF Industries reached an agreement on CO2 pricing with customers to allow it to keep its Billingham site running through at least January. That will secure output of the gas used in everything from food processing to the nuclear power sector while prices for natural gas -- a key fertilizer feedstock -- remain high, the government said."
B of A raise price target to 67
we will run past $50 this week
52W high!
"Markets are a real-time weighing machine. Futile to fight daily/weekly/market moves. Be a scale, measure earning power. Sure the China/coal and EU/natty high prices relative to USA natty will be solved fairly shortly and take the top out of the N fert market. What can't be solved quickly is the imbalance in supply and demand also the 10 year low in grain inventories. Even at the peak of corn harvest pressure, corn is still over $5 a bushel. Yes, some days USA natty goes up, joe trader takes some provides, EFTs that hold CF have to sell, indiscernable influences. Yes, the top will come out of N fert market, but N fert prices will be elevated for quite a while and analysts will keep boosting EPS almost weekly."
Food shortages will drive fertilizer to records.
"US natural gas vs. EU nat gas vs. China Coal is only 1/3 of the story. The stock is trading like a inverse of US natural gas, but there are longer term issues at play here, the supply/demand is in CF's favor and so is the grain stocks. Corn as not been $5 per bushel during harvest pressure for almost 10 years."
50 ..now what folks?
Any word on what is causing today’s increase?
(http://Stocks-tracker.com) is a must for any trader. Their watchlist which covers pre-market movers is one of the best researched in the industry. I don’t start trading without reading their daily email each morning!
Why did CF go up? Analysts are finally figuring out what I posted 11 days ago. They are drastically behind in marking up earnings. CF could make $9 per share if they maintain such a high energy cost advantage. What price does urea have to get to such that China and the EU can make money shipping it here? Also how far is demand below supply and how long will it take for producers to increase supply?
"CF: I started a hedge fund 30 years ago. Engineering background. Turns out, accurate predictions about the future are almost impossible. Tomorrow or the next minute are driven by an extreme amount of unknown and unknowable variables. True genius is finding the simplest thing possible with almost no variables or else sitting on your hands."
Would love to know what the net subsidy is that CF is getting to off-set their Nat Gas cost
