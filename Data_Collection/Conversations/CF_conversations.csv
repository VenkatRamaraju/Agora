"So, some analyst at Bernstein comes out with a price target of $37 and CF sells off by 3%. Turns out it was an opportunity to add more. Appreciate the opportunity from whomever this so call analyst is. Their reasoning has to do with Coal prices in China! Quite a reach with historically, low Natural Gas in the US and shipping cost from China to the US. With product distribution infrastructure, debt retirement, stock buybacks and CF's proven efficiency with managing cost, it is well suited to continue generating consistent profitability. This stock will return to the high 60's where it belongs."
CF just announced they are seeking action against Russia and Trinidad for unfairly dumping UAN fertilizer product into the US. they are looking for the US gov't to apply tariffs similar to those recently allowed against Morocco for dumping phosphate type fertilizers
"Bank of America analyst Steve Byrne double-upgraded three crop-input stocks, Nutrien (NTR), CF Industries (CF) and Corteva (CTVA), to the equivalent of Buy all the way from Sell.Back to precovid prices in no time. Can’t wait to hear earnings."
"Not sure how Corona Virus impacts the use of nitrogen fertilizer. Since CF is at $20 a share at the time of this post, I am compelled to keep adding. Our food supply distribution chain is intact. Appears that the weather is cooperating unlike last year with a record wet spring. Looking forward to CF's 1st qtr conference call."
Lots of oil and gas used to make fertilizer. Should be a buy
"Look at the three year chart. Long term basing formation, and it should build to the $60 level once again, just like Bernstein recently stated. First stop $50, which is Cowen's short term target. Today's B of A semi-downgrade just creates another fiirm, which will help drive it back to its old highs. They will eventually get onboard, just like they did with Intel today. Of course, they have already missed the first 25% of the move, but better late than never is their motto."
50 ..now what folks?
"OK, is anyone buying more here? This is getting scary especially when I see MOS up today. I realize they produce a different product but still in the same sector."
Makes me nervous....selling off the week before earnings. Hope it isn't because the hedge/mutual fund/large stake holders know something.
"@NYSE what are you thinking now on CF? Still time to buy more? I hate buying more at this price but I already made a mistake by selling my other fertilizer stock, YARIY. I bought that at 20 and sold at 22 and it is heading for 24 already. Same goes for MOS. I sold it way too soon. So it is CF or nothing for me in fertilizer space now. Higher natural gas prices may hurt CF but Nat Gas is still very low on a relative basis over 5 years."
"Investors rotating back into basic material stocks with a vaccine on the horizon. CF is well positioned and will continue to create excellent cash flow on its basic business. Also, with Biden being elected the green ammonia effort will have some real support behind it. This is not just the US but the world. And CF has the biggest ammonia plants and distribution global network."
Blow out earnings Aug. 9. Ammonia prices have doubled over 2020.
Why did CF go up? Analysts are finally figuring out what I posted 11 days ago. They are drastically behind in marking up earnings. CF could make $9 per share if they maintain such a high energy cost advantage. What price does urea have to get to such that China and the EU can make money shipping it here? Also how far is demand below supply and how long will it take for producers to increase supply?
"I read the Iran still selling urea and ammonia to countries b/c there is a discrepancy in sanction language...but now US likely going to clarify that any country/organization buying urea, ammonia or methanol from Iran will be subject to sanctions. If true, and if happens, that will tighten the nitrogen market up further, and also possibly cause industry to partially shut down in Iran...all very good for CF. If true, but reported by Reuters.Here's a related story from WSJ, pre the attack a few days ago in persian gulf.https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-delays-petrochemical-sanctions-on-iran-11559295001"
Is no one looking at the report? This is a sleeping Message Board.
Ag super cycle is underway. Clear sailing for at least 2 years.
"A significant price surge, which DTN designates #$%$ or more, occurred in each of the past three weeks for all eight of the fertilizers DTN tracks. The following are average fertilizer prices per ton and percent increases compared to last month as of Feb. 24:?DAP, $600, 22%.?Urea, $457, 18%.?MAP, $648, 15%.?UAN32, $288, 15%.?UAN28, $245, 14%.?Anhydrous, $530, 10%.?Starter, 10-34-0, $522, 9%."
"Nat gas in April 19 is $2.65 m/cf. Management said yesterday they are still very positive about the future of low nat gas, supply curtailments, China was a 1x boom bust and won't come back into export market in material way. They find the stock buyback very accretive and attractive, and an M&A deal would have to be compelling and clean pathway to exceed accretion from buying their own stock."
Gotta love the price action after every quarterly with CF.Hilarious!See you back at $50
UAN market is FUBAR
"Anyone know why the gap up the last two days? 12/13 of June.......no news that I can see, must be a large hedge fund/etf/or Mutual fund building a position."
"Corn and wheat prices moving up nicely over the last month. According to DTN the three fertilizers that were slightly higher include DAP with an average price of $439/ton, up $8; MAP $459/ton, up $17; and urea $362/ton, up $1. UREA being up is a very good sign. India (INDA) is up too indicating economy is picking up there. I would expect CF to start moving up as investors recognize the improvement in pricing."
Why is CF sharply lower in a surging market???
"Held up pretty well during recent sell off. I've been a long time CF holder. My dream is wake up one Monday morning to find out John Deer bought them out. I have 5,000 shares and I'm looking to sell. Don't see a reason for the stock to move unless Urea prices jump up significantly, or China agrees to import more from US in order to stop using coal to produce their own"
"CF tailwinds. 1) because urea prices have been so low for the past 6 years, new supply has been short of ever growing demand. Late last year the markets figured that out,i.e. demand was even with or exceeded supply and urea prices started up. Each year to meet growing demand a $4b plant that takes about 4 years to build needs to come online. That has not been happening. 2) Nat gas in EU have tripled and so has the prices of coal in China. From the news it appears that it's not profitable or barely profitable for both EU and China to produce urea. That puts further pressure on urea prices. 3) Grain stocks are at a 10 year low. This should lead to more acres of corn and more N fertilizer applied to existing acres. So in 2011&2012 when urea was $500 a ton CF made $5.72 per share. Since that time N production per CF share has doubled. Some from share buybacks and some from increased production. I can't say CF's earnings could double from here for one because nat gas was cheaper in 2011-2012, could they make $8 or $9 per share, possibly, even if it trades for 8x that's still $72 a share. My math says, assuming urea stays in at this price range, that CF is trading at a 30% FCF forward yield. Do your own DD, but it's all easy to see looking at their quarterly presentations which are some of the best in the market."
"We are the only ones down today! Even NTR, Mos is up. Any thoughts?"
"I am long here but I have to tell you, I would have predicted that the price of Natural Gas would have killed this stock (not the company) at least near term. I guess the pricing of Nitrogen is keeping up with Nat Gas? Oddly enough, I hate to hear the word hedged as a Natural Gas investor, but I hope CF is hedged on lower gas prices than $5.00!"
$70 coming
"I was able to read into CF and all their nitrogen based products, plus their cash reserves are recovering from 2019 lows, with a really healthy liquidity position in terms of total assets and debt. Check out the research review @ecoshares on Instagram, they're a private limited company that only review climate change related firms."
"I'm no analyst...Seems like the CEO is saying buy this puppy! I might have to go above my 10% allocation for CF in my portfolio. Am I missing something here? Statements from CEO W. Anthony Will.""In the past 12 months, a highly volatile period that included very low prices, our employees remained focused on operational excellence, and as a result, we're able to generate nearly $900 million in free cash flow over that time."""" We retired $1.1 billion in high interest debt, paid $280 million in dividends to our stockholders, invested in additional North American production by repurchasing the publicly traded common units of Terra Nitrogen Company for $388 million, repurchased $90 million worth of our shares, and still ended this quarter with more than $1 billion of cash on the balance sheet.""""But I think in the near-term back to Dennis' comments earlier, we view our shares as being a tremendous value right now...""""And our other alternatives are buying our shares back, we believe it's very attractive value...""""Longer term, we believe global market fundamentals will continue to enable CF Industries to generate significant cash through the foreseeable future."""" Along with our consistent operational performance, this should further strengthen our cash generation, and allow us to create significant shareholder value."""

"CF has drifted down to $45.65 at the time of this writing. With FCF of $1b, paying off a senior note of $500m due in May of 2020, is this the time to add? I'm have been dollar cost averaging down from a high of $50 a couple of weeks ago. Hopefully, this will pay off with 3rd qtr earnings around the corner. Hoping for CF trading near it's 52 week highs!"
"CF is paying off significant debt and buying back a lot of stock. Never good to miss analyst expected earnings, which will hurt the stock price, however, there is much value being created by mgt. I recall the CEO highlighting the production facilities run 24/7 and eventually we sell all that is produced. Also, not to look at CF as a quarterly business as opposed to six months at a time, or something to that effect. Tremendous cash being generated at CF. Paying off $500m @ 7.125% and another $250m @ 3.4% before year end. Brought back $72m in shares in the 3rd qtr alone. Mgt keeps using catch phrases like, "" drive substantial cash generation, support our cash generation, allowing us to build on this track record in 2020 and beyond.” During prior conference calls mgt has indicated cash flow into the foreseeable future. At some point I sense the cash will more directly to the shareholders via dividends. Why not with 6% of CF shares held by insiders! I will add on dips and look forward to mgt shifting excess cash flow from debt repayment/share buybacks, to the shareholders."
"Favorable comments and improving outlook for CF today. Have been accumulating for the past 6 months, which hasn't been easy riding CF down. CF is well position with production capacity, distribution network, operating cost, div yield, stock buybacks and FCF to return to pre-covid levels and beyond."
"Yesterday, during the 4th qtr conference call, management referenced buying back stock in the low 40's. Well, I hope today they're backing up the truck and loading up with the stock being $41.35 at the time of this writing!"
"Some months ago it appeared that the fun and games would be over when urea hit about $325 per ton, i.e. the Chinese would ramp production. Now with Chinese coal, imported natural gas, and oil up, urea has to go to $400 a ton before China will supply urea. Since we import 30% they are the swing player, look for CF's eps est to keep ramping and so will the stock. They could make $3.65 to $5.00 in 2019. $60 to $75 for the stock or high is quite possible. As a long as CF's energy source, i.e. U.S. nat gas prices behave."
Fert prices remain on the uptrend despite all the noise.Margins as Gary said will be far superior to European competition and should surprise to the upside on the August call
we will run past $50 this week
Anhydrous ammonia keeps going up - $743 per ton. CF is printing %
B of A raise price target to 67
Anyone have a good explanation for the recent run-up? Based on the price of N. Fert. and Urea and expected flat future earnings I'm wondering if this is just another temporary run-up until it once again trades back down to the mid to high 20s.
"The purchasing period is coming. If you have transacted CF stocks for few yeras, you would know that it is a typical cyclical one. As spring is the main - fert application - season, I think the price will slightly go down a little bit. Globally Ammonia market is still very quiet (but some signals appear the price is moving up) and urea price is also stable and weak. Overall, fert demand in the world might be very high. It means the next year would not be good as this year. However, this company is still interesting for me. With the most competitive production cost and with one of the big domestic market. I think it will meet the golden age in few years again. And furthermore Ammonia is discussed in several countries as reforming into Hydrogen."
Farmers planting the most row crops ever. Fertilizer sales will be a record
10% of float is short....... with a 50% earnings beat! Got to love it!
"Continuing to load up on CF. CF paid off $500m due in May of 2020 and $250m of a $500m note due in 2021. In addition to stock buy backs since Feb of 2019 of $250m, which retired 5.7m shares. CF has a remaining $750m authorization to buy back shares through 2021. Natural Gas prices continue to be near historical lows and CF sells all it produces running it's plants 24/7 with the exception of downtime for maintenance. With lower interest payments on debt, significant share buy backs on an ongoing basis, CF is well positioned to generate significant FCF with the rise or fall of fertilizer prices. If prices rise more $'s to the bottom line; if prices decrease significant interest savings on debt pay down and savings on dividend payments due to share buybacks. I relate this to paying down my own debt and mortgage years ago. I'm retired now and have no debt or mortgage with FCF that I get to enjoy. Sooner or later CF will be recognize for what it is, a cash generating machine. Patience will reward those of us that remain long."
International ammonia prices spiked up. Not sure if it’s a trend yet.
"1) Crossing Overbought line ... .. 2) NG price too high that it will ""eat"" into Q3 profit 3) P/E about 29 that is way over Chemical P/E average of 19.Time to taking profit now before it too late. Will see it back to around 50 again."

"As indicated I would start another position in CF. This time, wish me luck!"
Thank you to Management for the 50% beat! Great job!
Sub $20 on Thurs. with the loss posted today. In the best of times these guys can't perform anywhere near expectations. A minus 360 percent surprise.
Some smart people are starting to recognize that CF is more than just a steady cash flow generating basic materials company (see article below). Today's negative price action tells you funds are swapping out of basic materials and into growth stocks as the stock market moves sharply up. Little do they know that CF is actually turning into a compelling growth story. https://seekingalpha.com/article/4384475-cf-industries-winged-bull

$8 corn and $20 beans by December with the dry hot weather. Huge sales of fertilizer coming.
The market is finally coming to grips with the fact we have an environmental extremist running the country who don't care what industries they take down to achieve their goals. Investors are finally realizing Energy prices are going way up under this administration.
Perhaps it is now time to use the $750m line of credit to accelerate the authorize stock buybacks.
"I don't have the background to infer I'm able to analyze a stock. I do spend a considerable amount of time reading different analyst reports. When it comes to CF, there is a consensus among those that do proclaim to be analytical this company generates considerable free cash flow. That cash flow has been used to expand capacity significantly, pay down debt and share buy backs. Apparently, there is a senior note of $500m due in May of 2020 at 7.125%. It appears that CF is building up some dry powder to pay this off which will add put CF's balance sheet in a stronger position. There is the thought that CF should increase the dividend to reward shareholders. I would be in favor of a dividend increase, but, I am patient and am willing to wait until this cash cow throws off more direct cash to it's shareholders. In the meantime, keep buying back share and keeping some powder dry to payoff another $500m."
"My belief is that until the Trade Wars issue is settled Ag stocks will continue to correct. Ag companies are only now start to recover from a four year down cycle because of over supply and reduced demand, so another ""Trade Hurricane"" could destroy the recovery and depress their business much longer."

LoL CF initiated at a hold with a $10 target. CF Industries initiated with a Hold at Berenberg Berenberg analyst Rikin Patel initiated CF Industries with a Hold and $10 price target citing premium valuation.
The CF money train is leaving the station. Better get on board for the coming run to $80.
Down another .80 in After Hour trading.
"Looks like nitrogen will double again this year. No fertilizer, no corn"
"Has anyone here looked into UAN? They are small and thinly traded, but their upside is much greater than CF. They already have Blue ammonia and trade at a huge discount. They are my biggest holding and I think the upside is incredible. If you believe in CF, you should take a look at UAN."
CF is a strong company but still could lose 1/3 of it's value and visit the 2016 lows.
Upgrades are rolling in
The price of corn is up 3% today over $5.80/bu. Very bullish for the nitrogen biz. Profits to be announced May 5 will be massive
"During the conf call , mgt said they were buying back stock and also returned to shareholders the respective amts of the dividend payment....as if this was something wonderful. Meanwhile all the stock does is go down. Is mgt aware that investors purchase stock primarily for the appreciation in stk price. My read is mgt buys the stock back so they dont have to pay the divid yield. Isnt that wonderful for an investor. Note to MGT: if you wish to reward shareholders, increase the dividend or invest in growth."

"I bought more again today because of FOMO. If CF keeps ripping higher, I might miss opportunity to average down altogether. I have large positions in 5 major agri-business stocks. We will see how this plays out. If share prices don't recover in short-term, I will keep buying. If share prices recover, I will start a new holding somewhere else. Thats my story and I'm sticking to it!"
"They just cut their UAN price significantly in the Ohio Valley, a bad move on their part and a sure thing to cause grief from their customers, who had paid higher prices previously and are still holding those tons unsold."

What's going on with CF?Falling last few days Somebody looking to load up cheap shares before earnings
anybody selling now is throwing away money!
Is a Mitsui buyout in play?
"I came across some excellent commentary regarding strong urea demand from India. Bodes well for CF. Investors are not paying enough attention to this company. August saw two, back-to-back India tenders as government buying agencies struggled to keep up with high farmer demand following a late start to purchases this year due to COVID-19. Seasonal rains continued to support strong fertilizer demand in India, and a lack of exports from China drove prices higher through the month, culminating in the purchase of 1.7 mmt of urea to end August.The Egypt FOB price rose to $280/mt, up $20-$30 from July prices following higher prices achieved from the India tenders, which until August, had been far below before moving in line with prices at this time last year. Brazil prices strengthened to a lesser degree, ending August around $5 higher to $268-$275/mt CFR as the country is in between crops at the moment and quiet, similar to the U.S.Overall, the international market was quiet and watched India for indications on where prices would move. Higher prices did indeed follow, though to a lesser degree in the U.S. during this seasonally slow period. In the short term, our outlook on international urea is stable to soft, with India expected to call for more of the global supply in the coming weeks."
It touched almost 47 just yesterday. 7% fall. Incredible.
earnings look super!!!! WHAT IS HOLDING THE STOCK BACK?
"CF reported and continued to generate excellent numbers. Their margins were good and their ability to generate significant free cash flow in this environment is evidence why this company is well managed and worth owning as an investor. The future outlook looks positive with corn planting looking decent. India demand up. Compared to their peers they are low cost, efficient producers by looking at their ppt slides (which btw are very detailed compared to many companies). I do wish they had purchased back some stock when it fell into the mid 20's. This stock could easily bounce back into the 40's and 50's pre-COVID. The dividend yield is 3.5%. The company is simply underfollowed in my opinion."
CF 50 in next month.
"I added some more shares this morning and was delighted when it started moving up this afternoon. My main attraction to this stock is the concept of using hydrogen as a long-distance fule. The big disadvantage of using hydrogen is that the storage and transport of hydrogen is expensive. However, using ammonia as an intermediate stage reduces the costs. This company is well-positioned to dominate this market."

"Like I said , they will need over a billion in buy backs to prop this stock up. Too many sellers."
Expect a very nice surprise and a bunch of buyback this last qtr at about $27 million $ a month and CF was in low $20's a while. Rain fall was up thru first 6 months which will require more fert use also.
I tired of getting more opportunities to buy CF at a good price. Time for price appreciation. Let's increase the dividend and stop the buybacks.
"up or down, earnings ? what say you..."

"CF is bucking a very ugly day in the market and even uglier day for energy. With energy, it is never safe to go back in the water! What I would really like to know is this. Is this idea of Blue Hydrogen fuel real or just or just another fusion reactor that doesn't exist? I first heard the term reading a report on one of my Natural Gas producers. Is Blue Hydrogen something that is made from natural gas or is it to replace natural gas? Seems that CF is not the only company excited about it. Why would a natural gas company be excited about it? So ""Green"" Ammonia is required in the processing, storage and transportation of ""Blue: Hydrogen?"
"UREA / Fert. should still be protected via tariffs on China after a trade settlement is negotiated. The reason is Trump loves US farmers / ag. biz, and the Chinese are obviously dumping.

"Here WE Go, Back up to 47.00"
"I was wrong...CF didn't have to wait until it's next earnings release to hit a new 52 week high! I'm no analyst so go easy on me. It seems with the low cost of natural gas, overseas producers reducing or cessation of nitrogen fertilizers, rising prices, lower capital expenditures, higher fertilizer manufacturing production, acquisition of TNH seems to bode well for CF. Hopefully, we return to the mid sixties level before end of the year with this perfect storm."
I told u!!! Enjoy the ride and take profits on the way!!!
"New deal between CF and UK Government (keeping the Billingham plant running through at least January, despite high gas prices) October 11th 2021(Bloomberg) -- The U.K. food and drink industry averted the threat of a fresh carbon-dioxide supply crisis after agreeing to pay more for the gas from fertilizer company CF Industries Holdings Inc., which makes it as a byproduct.With a three-week government-brokered solution about to end, a U.K. subsidiary of CF Industries reached an agreement on CO2 pricing with customers to allow it to keep its Billingham site running through at least January. That will secure output of the gas used in everything from food processing to the nuclear power sector while prices for natural gas -- a key fertilizer feedstock -- remain high, the government said."
If CF can break above $31 this week and stay there / slowly climb higher it will be great from a chart pattern perspective.
Food shortages will drive fertilizer to records.
"sell CF buy back @ 25-30,, or buy BMY QCOM"
CF Holdings seems like a hidden gem that many have missed while the stock has been down due to the pandemic. People still need to eat and nitrogen fertilizer is a necessary input for crop farmers. This business is kind of boring so it's not like Amazon or Netflix so maybe that's while they're overlooked. They are low cost producers and generate excellent cash flow. Management runs the business well. They pay a nice dividend yield of 4.4%. The stock could easily run back up to $45-50. If you go to the company's website there are some excellent presentations outlining what they do and some financial valuation.
this stock is as undervalued as xxxx. Maybe should push to reddit to get some proper value.
Old NYSE informed this tread two weeks ago a long position was entered (near the low). I also informed this thread the last time old NYSE went long the stock was at $15 and rose to $50.

This is crazy 47 yesterday now 43.78-with upgrades. What am I missing?
China coming and this will rise fast.

Anyone know the problem with CF? Big drop in price on high volume. I don't see any news.
Monster earnings. 1.26 per share 2nd quarter versus 0.81 expected. High 50's by end of August.
"CF reports soon and I think it is worth reading through the Yara conference transcript which is CF's closest competitor. @gary I would not read too much into FMC's announcements as I don't recall them being cited as a close comp. Correct me if this is wrong. Yara management said they feel we are now in a demand driven market versus a supply drive market due to rising prices which is positive. They were questioned about rising fuel costs and maintaining a margin, which they said yes. CF presented last quarter a EBITDA sensitivity to natural gas and urea. Everything has been moving up so CF should have a positive outlook. Also, on the Yara call there were lots of questions surround blue ammonia. It sounds like a lot of investment is going on in this direction. Yara stock price has been moving up the past few days.Here's the link to the Yara transcript.https://seekingalpha.com/article/4404645-yara-international-asa-yariy-ceo-svein-tore-holsether-on-q4-2020-results-earnings-call"

"Its yet another day with ugly commodity stocks. At least a few are bucking the trend but only up a little. ADM is holding up and INGR is too. What frustrates me the most is these big selloffs (yes, I consider over 4% off already depressed shares to be significant) is no news. What is specifically wrong with CF today??"
"Any predictions on earnings to be released today? Hopefully, stock buy backs and paying down debt will be reflected in better margins going forward. It would be nice to see CF climb back towards $50."
its a strong sell and good stock to short at this price there is bad bad news coming so it will go below $20
"As the stock is breaking out, Zack is still looking in the rear view mirror and screaming sell, sell, sell. Once CF hits $35 then we are going to hear from another genius named Cramer."

CF will hit 50 before summer is over.
This is a great opportunity to start or add to a position in CF. They report in a little over a month so we should get some pretty good numbers. This stock is way undervalued.
"Miss not owning CF, it is a great company, I still follow it. Hope to join soon."
"Anyone else notice how CF seems to be trading in conjunction with China trade rumors? Seems when a rumor starts that the US and China will re-open trade discussions, CF goes down (China dumping urea, etc. in US). When there are no discussions and tariffs are likely to be applied, CF goes up. Anyone else notice this trade?"
"The average retail price of UAN28 is 26% higher than at the same time last month. With an average price of $306/ton, the nitrogen fertilizer is the most expensive it's been since 2015. (DTN Chart)OMAHA (DTN) -- Retail fertilizer prices tracked by DTN for the second week of March 2021 continue to show considerably higher prices. Once again, all eight of the major fertilizers were up a significant amount, which DTN designates #$%$ or more, for the sixth week in a row.Half of the fertilizers continue to be double digits higher from the previous month. UAN28 was staggering 26% higher compared to last month with an average price of $306/ton. UAN28 is now above the $300/ton level for the first time since the second week of September 2015.Also higher was UAN32, which was 21% higher from last month. The liquid nitrogen fertilizer had an average price of $344/ton."
"Time to fess up when one is wrong. I indicated that some analyst at Bernstein didn't know what he was talking about. Perhaps, I should have listen to him! My bad. However, I'm still adding."
Decision on dumping uan on Friday causes this to rocket higher
"@Foster here's an excellent article I came across that helped me understand the potential. Lots of detail, flow processes & infographics, and explanation. The article was written about two years ago. Yara seems to be a little further along on the process than CF, but these kinds of things don't happen overnight. Sounds very promising and makes CF & Yara VERY interesting investments. I have yet to listen to CF's presentation last week but the slides look impressive. https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/07/ammonia-renewable-fuel-made-sun-air-and-water-could-power-globe-without-carbon"
"nice, ..... now just need analyst to boost their 2022 earnings estimates for another leg up"
BofA analyst upgrade from hold to buy. Good entry price right here......
MOS numbers were great today. CF is headed to the stars
Any word on what is causing today’s increase?
Fertilizer stocks like CF and MOS that came out tonight confirming that Q1 has rocketing pricing and margins will be PHAT!
"like uranium, commodity hoarding will begin..usual suspects...china, russia and the rest of the world will panic..wish I could buy more"
"Sold naked $27 puts for $1.11. I already own CF (700 shares), but my goal is to acquire more at these cheap prices if assigned. If not assigned, I will still add more shares. The world got to eat, and commodities are bound to go higher with infinite money printing. Thats my bullish thesis, and I'm sticking to it."
CF should have a nice tailwind from last q's beneficial input costs. This company is well off its yearly high and has plenty of cash flow and should continue buying stock and funding its nice div on its way back to the mid 30's
Why does this thing go down much faster than it goes up? S&P is at all-time high and this thing is 20% BELOW it's high of just a few weeks ago!
Huge earnings beat! Will now cross 55 in a hurry.
Anyone buy Augu$t calls on Friday like me?Lemmings soldInvestors bought
"Chinese Urea subject to 10% tariff starting 9/24, and up to 25% tariff starting 1/1/19."
I think it just market volitility.... natural gas all over the place but oil production will be down still ....cf will have advantage over competition....nice growth this year.... should have good demand next spring..... nitrogen prices could be higher....& so would be margins
"A few days ago when Zack showed a strong buy rank #1, I promptly sold. When Zack has a stock ranked #5 Strong Sell, it will be worth while to follow the stock for a possible purchase. I bought CF when Zack said sell it and I sold CF when Zack said strong buy it. Thank you Zack (no need to say that they are a bunch of geniuses)."
really happy that CF is heading upwards and hoping it could reach 2019 levels. however at the same time. it does not seem to really follow the Nitrogen price fully. N prices has been heading up since the start of 2020 with very few dips in between.
"Bunge reported this morning excellent numbers, which bodes well for CF who will report next week. While not in the same business segments as CF it is a related peer group company. Remember, CF is in the S&P500 so it will trade down with the market. I expect CF to report decent numbers as usual, showing strong cash flow from operations. Management is really skilled at cranking out free cash flow despite different agri-market conditions. Looks like a good buying opportunity in spite of poor stock price action. Business fundamentals still intact. India is back with tenders. Bunge said in its earnings press release, ""In Fertilizer, we now expect full-year adjusted results to be slightly higher than last year."" This is good supporting outlook for CF.Bunge (BG) – The agriculture commodities company reported adjusted quarterly earnings of $2.47 per share, compared to a consensus estimate of 20 cents a share. Revenue came in above estimates as well. Bunge saw strong demand for oilseed processing and soy products, and the company lifted its full-year outlook. The shares rose 6% in premarket trading as of 7:40 a.m. ET."
It's a shame that the price has plummeted today. But it is still very attractive stock for me with not that bad spread. Low NasGas price and relatively resistant urea price. These days I imagine how Ammonia price will go moving. Several weeks ago after the unexpected S/D from one factory in SEA it has going up. So I hope this drift goes continuously. And I read some articles that Ammonia is mentioned for one of the friendly-energy. Marine fuel energy and raw material for hydrogen extraction(decomposition..?)The moment will come not very soon but it is not that far.
Jet stream tailwinds
"Agricultural commodity prices exploding, stay long. Remember, old NYSE is the Grand Old Parr."
Nitrogen shortage is on the way. Prices to rocket higher.
"Did I read it correctly, they missed earning a little and the stock was down pre market and now it's pushing higher......."
Wow had to delete my last post... It didn't make much sense. What does make sense is that DND and @CF went into the index at the same time. $CF knows how to get things done and that stock might end up with a new high out of the many Tech names they support including DND. Enjoy the week Mr. Proud and Mr. Daviau. I'll be buying up some @CF.TO on the slump. If there ever is one. I'm out of my silver miners right now. Too nutsiecoocoo don't have a clue now that $26 is the price of spot... but i digress. Again sorry about the last post. What a mess.
CF is in a benefited industry from inflation. Urea price has soared since late last year. Yesterday Nola Barge price jumped up again.
"most AN sold in spring so most of nat gas used in spring, must be over reaction"
China is buying the US corn crop. Price up 6% today on drop in expected ending inventory
The stock is undervalued and people don’t understand the tremendous free cash flow that is being generated. Blue ammonia is going to be big and CF is well positioned to prosper. You will not be able to time when investors decide to join the party. Just go long term and collect your nice dividend yield in the meantime.
I would have thought that Coronavirus would have helped CF.....who wants Urea / Nitrogen products from China right now??
"This should be sitting at $55 bucks about now. Not entirely sure why its performing so poor, but earnings out soon and expect a jump."
"The Street upgraded CF to a buy in a report posted yesterday, the 13th of March. Their target price is $54.47, but, as might be expected, this upgrade has not been reported in stock news. All we seem to see recently are two downgrades, which, hopefully, have chased all the short term traders out of the stock. The concern about the international price of urea is overblown, and I would trust CF's expectations versus any Wall Street analyst. Even the Citigroup analyst in his negative report yesterday stated that the stock could reach $55, if urea prices remain steady."
Good read cf a competitor of UanCF Industries: A Cash Machine Thriving On Cheap Natural Gas $CF https://seekingalpha.com/article/4291792
Yara Intl (YARIY) is another good leading indicator that CF is doing just fine. Yara is a nitrogen fertilizer producer out of Norway and is often a company that CF compares itself during their quarterly presentations. Yara announced their earnings last week which were superb. Not only did they announced an extraordinary dividend distribution. Yara also generates excellent free cash flow like CF. They said that their India plant is performing well amid the COVID-19 so I imagine the circumstances would not be wildly different for CF. Yara stock was at $20 at the beginning of the year while CF was at $45. Yara stands at $17 today while CF at $26. On a relative basis Yara is down 15% YTD while CF is down 42% YTD. I expect to see the stock move up on earnings and the company should execute on their buyback program if the stock remains here. Right now they are under a blackout rule until earnings are announced plus two days.
"Would love this stock to go to $30, don't think it will happen. We just need another upgrade from Zack's and we may get there."
CF crossing 50 and rise to 60 very soon.
"Guys something people don't mention is CF has massively cut debt, while keeping total assets steady. Their debt/assets ratio is 0.329 for fiscal 2020. You can see all this in depth @ecoshares on Instagram. They're on a mission to advocate climate change fighting companies."
Inflation in everything but natural gas. What could be better for a nitrogen fertilizer manufacturer?? I hate it for gas investments but CF is a beautiful company right now!!

Easy $60 by July. Corn planting and fertilizing are going to be through the roof this year.
"Vertex announces reimbursements for Slovenia, Slovakia and Romania for #cysticfibrosis medicines. We’re pleased that in Eastern European countries more people with #CF will be provided with access to a #CF medicine."
closing down UK facilities due to high ng price.
Nat gas to fertilizer plants have been shutdown. Nitrogen fertilizer prices are jumping.
anyone know why CF is dropping?
Old NYSE pick up a good block of shares down here.
"China largely uses coal to make urea, not natural gas."
"If CF does not deliver a blowout quarter like last time +58% upside surprise, will tank to $25- level."
after market today or tomorrow there will be bad news coming
blowout earnings today
"I've always felt selling stock is a far more difficult decision making process than taking on a position. Tax ramifications are a factor as you mentioned, but usually I usually don't worry too much about it. Maybe, that's because most of my investments are in retirement accounts. Therefore, hearing that others are selling simply for tax reasons only affirms my view of a buying opportunity. The FCF this company is generating is excellent in this environment. It really shows how well it is managed. I would like to see more insider purchasing by management (NOT issued via options)."
Based on land auctions the last 2 weeks land prices are up 20%. Farmers are going to go all in this year with a massive corn crop to satisfy Chinese demand. Fertilizer volumes and prices are going to rocket higher.
Fertilizer prices including UAN and Urea have been ripping all quarter.CF earnings are guaranteed blowout.May 5th is going to be HUGE!Green ammonia story is the long term bonus story as well....
"@gary @Sandy Looks like the huge spike in Natural Gas is taking its toll on CF today. I guess I can live with that because I own a lot more Nat Gas stocks than CF or Yara. Gary, what it the best place for me to track Anhydrous Ammonia pricing and is that the main this that I would want to look at for Nitrogen fertilizer?? What about UAN or is that the same thing? I track tons of commodities from Corn, Soybeans, to Aluminum and Iron Ore, Oil & Gas, but I never see UAN or Nitrogen fertilizer?"
"Sounds very goodCorn prices surged another 2.5% Friday, closing out its best week in four years and climbing to five-year highs. Worries over late plantings and plenty more wet weather ahead continue to create significant tailwinds. July futures gained 11 cents to $4.53, with September futures up 10.5 cents to $4.5825.Corn basis bids continued to come in steady to firm across the central U.S. Friday, rising 1 to 8 cents across interior river terminals and up 5 cents at an Indiana ethanol plant today.Private exporters reported to USDA the sale of 4.9 million bushels of corn for delivery to unknown destinations during the 2019/20 marketing year, which begins September 1.Turkey has purchased 3.9 million bushels of corn in a series of provisional international tenders that closed earlier today, from optional origins."

"does everyone think this company is going nowhere? What happened to the mgt thinking the stk was sooo undervalued, the buyback, etc? Did we turn that quickly or do they not know the market?"
(http://Stocks-tracker.com) is a must for any trader. Their watchlist which covers pre-market movers is one of the best researched in the industry. I don’t start trading without reading their daily email each morning!
"OK, I am new here. I just bought in at prices ranging from 31 to high 29s over the month of Oct. Is there some underlying problem with this company that I don't know about? Perhaps I have caught another falling knife? Is it only weak as of late because the price of natural gas is going up? Could it be that simple? I suspect natural gas is going much higher in the next 60 days. Is that a good reason to not by more CF at these levels? I know very little about Ag companies. The only other one I own is BG and I realize it is different than a fertilizer company."
"Looks like a classic cup & handle formation with about a 10% off the high of 39.32. If it passes 39.32, that will be a very good sign of a runup. Here's hoping."
"According to a ""State of the Union Address at a CF plant we are now exporting a lot of our product to South America and Europe. Things are looking great with the 2 new Ammonia plants, 2 new UREA granular plants producing record numbers and the buying of the stock Terra Nitrogen is further strengthening their place as a leading producer in the world. My prediction is $60 within 2 weeks to a month."
"But yes, CF is advantaged with low nat gas costs vs other N producers that use nat gas at higher prices, or use coal to make urea."
"Berenberg raises pt to 60, rating to buy."
"CF: I started a hedge fund 30 years ago. Engineering background. Turns out, accurate predictions about the future are almost impossible. Tomorrow or the next minute are driven by an extreme amount of unknown and unknowable variables. True genius is finding the simplest thing possible with almost no variables or else sitting on your hands."
"unless it is the CF finance dept, of course"

The last time old NYSE purchased this stock it sold for $15. It went to the $50s after that. Today old NYSE made his initial purchases.
"CF Industries (CF) is a company that will play a big role in food security and mitigating climate change over the upcoming years. They manufacture and distribute nitrogen fertiliser, as well as other hydrogen and nitrogen products. These are used for clean energy, emissions abatement, fertiliser, and other industrial applications. From a financial perspective, the company looks strong in resuming positive earnings, after a slight slip into negative during 2017.Revenue for 2021 is estimated at a strong $4.38bn, recovering from a slight dip seen in 2020. Since 2015, total assets have remained around the same, recorded at $12.17bn in 2019. The company however decreased their debt from $5.54bn to $3.96bn during the same timeframe. This represents an improved and healthy liquidity at 0.325. Shares are currently $43.40, well below their record high of $68.92 in 2015."
35 area looks like the next stop.
"@Sandy OK, I am feeling much better today since this is moving up instead of down for the first time since I have owned it. You know me from the BG board too. I just wonder if it is finally moving because the overall market is up (S&P), or is that press release about Ammonia production for Hydrogen Energy, causing some green investment interest? I really can't believe that is moving the needle for this big company. Either way, I will be happy to tell my friends I am going green! That is actually a joke if you knew me."
Big spike today. More than 6%!!! What is driving this???
With a market cap of only 233M CVR Partners (UAN) has tremendous upside
You would think the fert market had collapsed instead of a potential supercycle of strong pricing
"@Me @Lookiing Good You guys are great! I am going to read that whole piece on Hydrogen when I get home from the gym. I never thought I would get excited about Natural Gas and Fertilizer again. Funny, I found BG trying to find a fertilizer investment. So I actually bought BG first and have done great. But in fact, BG is very small in fertilizer and only in South America. So I went into CF at too high of a price $31.00 and just bought a boatload more at $26.17 to average down. I may keep all of it along with BG and consider it Core. Good Luck!"
"Put your trust in old NYSE when he writes, this will be much higher before the investment world takes notice."
CF Industries reached a 52 Week high at 46.83
"CF came in a little light but not unexpected. the recent updated analysts had around a 7-10 cent loss. what is important to understand is the totally abnormal global natural price spread that happened due to the pandemic. Already, the spread is returning to a more normalized state. World economies are picking up with a vaccine coming on the horizon. the stock was at ~47 last year. With a 4.5% yield one can wait for a nice rebound. this is a well managed company."
Barons good read Farming Appears to be the Place to Look for Growth in the Second Half
I have been an occasional poster on this board over the years. I have been a supporter of CF management recognizing the efficiency of the operations and financial management. Over the years my CF position grew to about 12% of my portfolio by accumulating in the low 20's to mid 40's. Three weeks ago I sold my entire CF positions. One critical factor in my decision to unwind CF was the lost opportunity of capital gains from having such a large position in CF. Over the past three weeks the capital gains I realized from unwinding my CF position has out performed my capital gains from being long CF for the past few years. CF is a well run company that the market seems to ignore. I will continue to watch CF and hopefully take another position in mid October before 3rd qtr earnings release in early November. Perhaps CF should not be as focused on stock buybacks and paying down as much debt as it has. Imagine if half of those dollars allocated for buybacks and debt reduction were returned directly to the shareholders through dividends. I hope to acquire a position in CF again; just before more FCF is directed to its dividend. GLTA!
