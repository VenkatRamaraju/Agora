"Off topic -- There are many in the US and Europe who want their citizens to sacrifice something in order to reduce emissions from the burning of fossil fuels.While we fret about burning oil and gas, coal futures have surged to a record high of $210 per metric ton, coming from $83 at the end of April. While dealing with electricity shortages, China has returned to burning coal... but is now vowing to achieve emissions standards and reach carbon neutrality by 2060. That's a good target date because everyone involved will be dead. This obviously raises some questions about the value of US efforts to promote ""clean"" energy. #MPC #PSX"

"MS -- 9/7 --Ready for Takeoff: Initiating on Refining & Marketing – Summary and Price TargetsWe initiate coverage of the Refining & Marketing sector with an Attractive industry view. The core of our thesis revolves around a recovery in air travel and jet fuel demand that will drive higher set utilization and better product pricing. OW HFC, MPC, VLO; EW PBF, PSX; UW DK.Initiating coverage of Refining & Marketing with an Attractive industry view: Wesee a favorable set-up following the sector's 20-25% sell-off. The industry nowsits near all-time low valuations relative to the S&P 500 (an 8-9x EV/EBITDAdiscount vs. historical ~6x). While this implies an anticipation of major negativerevisions ahead, we see 5-10% upside to 2022 consensus EBITDA estimates.Macro view — keep it simple; watch jet demand. Refining remains one of thefew portions of the industrial economy that has yet to fully recover from theglobal pandemic. We see hampered jet fuel demand as the most importantreason why. With global flight volumes limited, jet fuel demand and pricing areweak. This is also weighing on other fuels (gasoline, diesel) as refiners shiftproduction away from this disadvantaged product. We see the positive feedbackloop of increasing demand and pricing across most major products driving anindustry-wide recovery in 2022. Catalysts to watch are COVID case trends, globallockdown measures, and global mobility trends. Secondary catalysts include USbiofuels policy clarity, OPEC+ production unwinds, and capital return increases.Our stock picks are based on our view of asset positioning, energy transitionopportunity, capital availability, and earnings revisions. We rate VLO and MPCOW. In addition to upside to consensus estimates, we favor their renewablespositioning and capital deployment potential, respectively. We rate HFC OW onoverly-bearish consensus expectations. We rate DK UW, due to less upwardrevision potential — we do not favor integrated models at this point in the cycle.Similarly, PSX (EW) has an integrated model that offers through-cycleoptionality, but hampers near-term revisions. We rate PBF EW, as we see it as ahighly-levered player, but we see balance sheet risk as fairly priced.Risks to our call: Global refining capacity growth may pressure global marginsmore than we forecast. Environmental policy has both upside and downside risksin increasing capital spending needs or further supporting biofuel development.Meanwhile, there may be a more structural change in global mobility than weanticipate, which could keep jet fuel demand and thus margins relatively muted.Finally, Hurricane Ida has shut down meaningful refining capacity — we assessrisk to covered companies inside.Price TargetsDK_ UW __ $20.00 HFC OW__ $40.00 MPC OW__ $75.00 PBF EW___ $12.00 PSX EW __ $80.00 VLO OW __ $80.00"

"Oil and Gas Journal Sep 1st, 2021 Excerpts #MPC #PSXTimeframes for full restoration of operations at Louisiana’s major refining and petrochemical complexes remain uncertain amid extensive regional power outages in the aftermath of Hurricane Ida.The US Department of Energy (DOE) confirmed that as of 7:00 a.m. EDT on Sept. 1, seven of Louisiana’s nine major refineries that undertook precautionary shutdowns ahead of the hurricane’s arrival remained offline. While two refineries located in the Baton Rouge area—spared by the storm’s severest impacts—had initiated the restart process as of Aug. 31, DOE said the sites would not reach full production rates for at least several days.ExxonMobil Corp. subsidiary ExxonMobil Fuels & Lubricants Co. confirmed via official social media channels late on Aug. 31 that it was safely progressing restart of its 520,000-b/d Baton Rouge integrated refining and petrochemical complex in Baton Rouge, La., which did not sustain any major damage from the hurricane and maintained reduced operations throughout the weather event to stabilize equipment and minimize emissions. While it did not specify a timeframe for the complex’s return to full operation, the operator did warn the site would experience some flaring during the restart process.At midday on Aug. 31, Royal Dutch Shell PLC confirmed assessments started on the morning of Aug. 30 at its 230,611-b/d integrated refining and petrochemicals complex in Norco, La., indicated that there was some evidence of unidentified building damage at the site, which lost power during the storm. Later that afternoon, however, the operator confirmed via social media posts the Norco complex—though still without electrical power—was in “a safe and stable condition” but would continue to experience flaring events until power was restored.In another late-day Aug. 31 post to a separate official social media account, Shell said post-storm assessments were now completed at its Geismar, La., chemical manufacturing plant along the Mississippi River, about 20 miles south of Baton Rouge. Operating at reduced rates, the Geismar site—which produces 400,000 tonnes/year (tpy) of ethylene glycol and 1.39 million tpy of alpha olefins from ethylene feedstock it receives from the Norco complex—also was in “a safe and stable condition” and did not lose power during the storm, according to the operator.As of midday on Sept. 1, Shell had no timeline for when Norco and Geismar would be able to resume full operations.On Aug. 31, Valero Energy Corp. confirmed to OGJ via e-mail that it was in the process of conducting a thorough assessment of equipment and potential structural impacts from Ida at subsidiaries Valero Refining Meraux LLC’s 125,000-b/d refinery in Meraux, La., and Valero Refining New Orleans LLC’s 215,000-b/d refinery in Norco. The company said it also was working with third-party suppliers and utility providers on restoration of services to enable the restart process, for which there is no current estimate.As of its most recent operational update issued late in the day on Aug. 31, Phillips 66 confirmed via a statement to the company’s website that post-storm assessments were ongoing at its 255,600-b/d Alliance refinery in Belle Chasse, La., which remained shuttered. The operator said timelines for the site’s restart remains largely dependent on assessment impacts and as well as reliable access to electricity and other utilities in the region.Corporate policies requiring no disclosure of information regarding daily operations at manufacturing sites continues to leave the situational status unclear for Marathon Petroleum Corp.’s 578,000-b/d refinery in Garyville, La., and PBF Energy Inc. subsidiary Chalmette Refining LLC’s 185,000-b/d dual-train coking refinery in Chalmette, St. Bernard Parish, La., outside of New Orleans."

See you at $100 by year end.
Valero's gulf coast indicator (indicative crack spread) for last week is over $10 for the first time since the end of 2019.
"There seems to be some frustration over the fact that refiner stocks are not keeping up with the increasing price of oil. Oil producers are benefiting from bullish sentiment based on expectations of rising oil demand (based on opening economies) and of OPEC+ ability to control oil production. (OPEC is meeting as I write this.) The sentiment ignores increasing global electrification and the threat of the Covid variant. I don’t know how long this bullish sentiment lasts but I doubt oil gets close to $100. I could be wrong.Refiners are not sellers of crude oil. They are buyers paying the increasing oil price. They count on gasoline and diesel prices to keep up with oil but these fuels trade as separate markets – with prices based on supply and demand of those fuels. The optimal situation for refiners is high fuel prices, low crude oil prices (thus a strong crack spread) and strong demand for fuel. Low crude prices also discourage EV adoption. US refiner stocks, on a day-to-day basis, often move in tandem with oil producers becauseUS fuel demand numbers affect both groups. Also, major refiners are included in all energy funds and indexes. These mostly consist of producer stocks and move with oil.I apologize to those for which all of this is obvious. Nevertheless, trying to explain or justify moves in energy – including refiners – is mostly a guessing game. Good luck to all. #MPC #PSX"
"Notable comment from 8/3 PSX conference call -- Jeff Dietert -- Vice President, Investor Relation“…….. We are seeing Refining rationalization, 3.7 million barrels a day of announced closures; 800,000 a day of temporary outages that could become more permanent; and we're up to about 1.7 million barrels a day of capacity that's been announced as considering either terminals or other types of service or potential shutdown. So that rationalization is a big piece of it as well. And I think we're expecting more closures to be announced.” #MPC #PSX"

Slow slide back. $59 swing down? I'm bear over all Bull long Look to buy in again.Anyone else see a drop. Market retrace I'm thinking
A month ago they were writing about virtually a non existent spread between the price of Brent and WTI and that severely impacted the margins of companies like Valero. Have you taken a look lately at the spreads now. You would think they would be buying but no now their worried about the slowing growth due to the Delta Variant. Don't listen to these people. Just understand that eventually reason returns and what is 60 now can easily become 75 again.

"Americans Keep Driving Despite Virus Concernsby Bloomberg|Jeffrey Bair|Thursday, August 26, 2021Americans Keep Driving Despite Virus ConcernsAmericans are still buying up fuel to make the most of summer travel despite a new wave of Covid-19 outbreaks.(Bloomberg) -- Americans are still buying up fuel to make the most of summer travel despite a new wave of Covid-19 outbreaks, allaying fears a resurgent virus would choke off the oil market’s remarkable recovery this year.Fuel consumption, measured by the amount of gasoline sent to the market, last week rose to the highest level since the end of July. The figures defy expectations that Covid-19 concerns would keep more Americans at home and drive down demand.The consumption boost offers encouragement to an industry bedeviled by the volatile recovery from the pandemic. Delta’s spread has put thousands in intensive care, prompting worries that summer travel would fizzle out well before Labor Day, which is the traditional end of the season. Tracking those concerns, oil’s stellar year-to-date rally cooled in the first half of August.“Still a lot of Americans are willing to get out and live their lives in the midst of Covid,” said Robert Yawger, director of the futures division at Mizuho Securities.Americans’ penchant for hitting the road is also showing up in stockpiles. Gasoline supply in the region including New York last week dropped to its lowest in nearly four years. Cash-market prices in New York Harbor and Houston increased Wednesday in response, along with futures. The spread of gasoline over crude oil rose more than 12%.Despite the uncertainty in the market, U.S. oil refiners have on the whole navigated the latest twists and turns with success, Yawger said.“More often than not, they get that math wrong in a normal year,” he said.#MPC, #PSX, #HFC"

"Sunnier outlook means it's refining's turn to shine, J.P. Morgan saysFeb. 22, 2021 7:44 PM ETValero Energy Corporation (VLO)By: Jason Aycock, SA News EditorWeighing the latest information from Texas' deep freeze, J.P. Morgan is reflecting on a more optimistic outlook for U.S. refineries - and says it would shift some capital that way, with industry conditions improving.The firm is raising crack spread forecasts, taking into account not only shorter-term supply disruption impacts from the Texas freeze, but also pent-up demand from the COVID-19 recovery, and longer-term impacts of ""permanent U.S. capacity reductions, particularly for gasoline.""Refiners have lagged exploration/production companies during the recovery, ""for good reason, until now,"" the firm says. Downstream has lagged upstream by about 13% since the end of 2019, and the recovery off the bottom has been slower for refining margins than for oil prices.""Refiners have been hit by the double whammy of weak demand and tight crude diffs caused by OPEC Plus curtailments and shale discipline,"" the firm says. ""However, with demand now improving and OPEC Plus committed to release some barrels back to the market, we think that this should be good for refiners.""Meanwhile, the weight of COVID-19 on near-term mobility should begin to lighten, in part due to vaccine distribution progress. That could make gasoline distribution dynamics ""fairly snug"" considering capacity reductions.And diesel margins could take a little longer to recover given knock-on effects of a lagged recovery in demand for jet fuel - though demand has been strong on a combination of shipping-related end markets and cold weather.Extending its models into 2023, J.P. Morgan sees about 20% total return potential for the sector by the end of the year. (Further out, it says electric vehicle penetration rates will become a headwind, though likely not until at least 2025.)In terms of individual stocks, the new look has led to shuffled ratings as well. It's staying Overweight on Valero (NYSE:VLO) due to ""pure-play GC refining exposure and growing Renewable Diesel business,"" and it's upgrading Marathon Petroleum (NYSE:MPC) to Overweight as well - ""as we like its post-Speedway sale setup, with higher torque to refining, improved spending discipline on capex/opex, a much improved balance sheet and potential for material share buybacks.""A Valero price target boost to $87 from $71 implies 17% upside, while a raise in its Marathon target to $67 from $52 implies 22% upside from current pricing.It's also upgrading Par Pacific Holdings (NYSE:PARR) to Neutral since it's materially lagged peers so far in 2021.On the flip side, it's downgrading Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) to Neutral, expecting lower-than-consensus earnings this year. And it's staying Neutral on HollyFrontier (NYSE:HFC) due to near-term capex profile.The firm is also remaining relative Underweight on Delek U.S. Holdings (NYSE:DK) and PBF Energy (NYSE:PBF) due to valuation/leverage profiles.#MPC#PSX"

Such announcements may affect refiner stock prices more than the reality affects earnings but investors can't ignore this administration's goals – even if set to be measured after they’re gone.“WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden will sign an executive order Thursday that sets a target for zero-emissions vehicles to account for half of all automobiles sold in the U.S. by 2030, according to senior administration officials.Establishing the non-binding goal is part of a series of actions Biden will announce aimed at jump-starting a dramatic shift toward electric vehicles and part of the administration's broader agenda to tackle climate change and compete with China. The president will sign the order with executives from Ford, GM and Stellantis on hand as well as leaders from the United Auto Workers union as a display of their support for the efforts.""“Biden will kick off development of long-term fuel efficiency and emissions standards that would apply to heavy-duty vehicles in addition to cars, SUVs and pickup trucks, officials said. The Environmental Protection Agency will also announce they're unwinding former President Donald Trump's rollback of near-term fuel efficiency and emissions standards.”“The new executive order applies to battery electric, plug-in hybrid electric and fuel-cell electric vehicles. According to the Pew Research Center, electric vehicles accounted for less than 2% of U.S. automobile sales in each of the past three years, putting the U.S. behind 19 other nations and the world's overall share. China has more than double the amount of electric vehicles on the road and is growing electric vehicle sales at more than twice the rate compared to the U.S., according to Pew.” #MPC #PSX"

Future development opportunities are being assessed.** TotalEnergies said it would convert the Grandpuits refinery into a biofuel and plastics recycling complex, ending crude refining at the site in early 2021.** Eni is evaluating the conversion of its Livorno refinery in northwest Italy into a biorefinery. Eni has already converted two of its Italian refineries and is looking to almost double its biorefining capacity to around 2 million mt/year by 2024, and expand this by at least five times by 2050, as part of a pledge to achieve complete carbon neutrality by 2050.** Portugal's Galp said in April 2021 that the last units at its Porto refinery should be stopped at the end of the month and decommissioning will then start, to be followed by decontamination. In a regulatory filing Dec. 21, 2020, the company said it would discontinue refining operations at the Porto refinery from 2021 and concentrate its core refining activities and future developments at the larger Sines refinery. The site at Porto will remain a logistics hub, but the company will assess other ways to use the facility.** Petroineos said its plan to transition the configuration of its UK Grangemouth refinery would be phased in during 2021.

"The $1.3 trillion infrastructure bill (actually $550 million in new money) includes several items that may affect refiners. The bill is likely to be stalled, or killed, by House Democrats who want to combine the bill with the larger $3.5 trillion “human infrastructure” bill. Nevertheless, these items in the Senate approved bill, all criticized by liberal progressives, may affect US refiners.$10 billion for carbon capture, transport and storage. This may be a good option for refiners down the road.$8 billion for hydrogen – opposing interpretations on whether funding is limited to hydrogen produced only from clean sources.

"(Bloomberg, 9/10/21) -- Phillips 66 may idle a New Orleans-area refinery that suffered so much damage during Hurricane Ida that repairs may be too costly, according to people familiar with the operation.Chief Executive Officer Greg Garland is scheduled to visit the Alliance refinery in the suburb of Belle Chasse, Louisiana, next week, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the information isn’t public. Company spokesman Bernardo Fallas said there’s no operational update or timeline for restarting the facility.The refinery, which can process more than 250,000 barrels of crude a day, was shut on Aug. 28, the day before Isa slammed into southeast Louisiana with ferocious winds and drenching rains. A 9-foot wall of water punched a hole in the refinery’s protective levee and inundated the plant.The damages may complicate Phillips 66’s efforts to find a buyer for an asset it was trying to unload before the storm because of “market conditions and the evolving energy landscape.” #VLO, #MPC"

"OT -- Goldman Cools on Conoco But Likes 8 Other Oil Stocks -- Barron’s Oct 11, 2021 #MPC #PSX""The price of oil keeps rising, and the stocks of oil companies with it. Now, some analysts think the strategy of how to play the rebound is changing, too.For much of the past two years, investors and analysts have been focused on which oil companies can keep their costs down and send more of their profits back to investors as dividends and share buybacks. That’s led to more companies reducing their drilling budgets, paying off debts and slowing down plans to explore for new oil deposits.But there’s a counterargument to that strategy.There’s evidence now that demand for oil and gas isn’t going away in the near term, and the next few years will actually be characterized by high prices and underinvestment. That’s why Saudi Arabia is investing in expanding its production capacity to 13 million barrels a day from 12 million, even as U.S. and European oil firms slim down and reduce production. Goldman Sachs analyst Neil Mehta thinks that investors ought to consider companies that have access to long-term sources of oil and gas. Mehta picked eight of those companies as potential investments that can pay off over time as oil prices stay high amid a supply shortage.Goldman forecasts that the world will use 106 million barrels of oil per day in 2030, versus assumptions from European oil companies that demand will be around 100 million barrels. The eight stocks should return 18% in the next year, on average, Mehta predicts.Hess (ticker: HES) owns a stake in a major oil project off the coast of Guyana in partnership with ExxonMobil (XOM) and Chinese company CNOOC (883Hong Kong) that is expected to produce considerable amounts of oil for the next decade. Mehta expects the company to increase its cash flow by 15% a year through 2030, from $10 per share this year to $30 in 2030. He sees shares rising to $106 from a recent $92.Exxon’s Guyana project, and its refining, chemicals and liquefied natural gas divisions give it one of the strongest asset bases in Big Oil, according to Mehta. He sees shares rising to $68 from a recent $62.50.Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) has one of the largest positions in the Permian Basin that Mehta expects to pay dividends for years — literally and figuratively. Pioneer has a variable dividend policy that could offer investors a dividend yield of 11% in 2022, Mehta estimates. He sees shares rising to $213 from a recent $196.Occidental Petroleum (OXY) has been held back for the past couple of years because it added substantial debt when it bought competitor Anadarko Petroleum. But investors may be overlooking the strength of its resource base in the U.S. and Middle East, as well as its chemicals division, Mehta asserts. He sees shares rising to $40 from a recent $34.Small-cap Kosmos Energy (KOS) has promise because of an offshore natural gas project in West Africa that it’s constructing with BP (BP), Mehta writes. It’s expected to start service in the second half of 2023. He sees shares rising to $4 from a recent $3.30.Mehta also likes three Canadian oil companies — Cenovus (CVE), Suncor (SU) and Canadian Natural Resources (CNQ). He thinks they own resources that should pump out oil for years, and deserve more attention from American investors. Mehta has become less positive on ConocoPhillips (COP), though. He downgraded his rating to Neutral from Buy based on the company’s outperformance in recent months. It’s up 73% since his February upgrade, versus 15% for the S&P 500. He sees 4% total return for the stock in the next year, less than other oil stocks."

"Valero Energy named Top Pick at CIti in tighter refining marketFeb. 24, 2021 3:48 PM ETValero Energy Corporation (VLO)By: Carl Surran, SA News Editor3 CommentsValero Energy (VLO +2.9%) is named Top Pick with a $95 price target at Citi, saying the company offers the best earnings exposure to a tighter refining market caused by the Texas winter storm, which accelerates an already improving 2021 refining outlook.Also, the ""U.S. Energy Transition narrative is speeding up, and the market continues to grossly underprice VLO's clean energy plans,"" Citi's Prashant Rao writes.Valero is ""the lowest-cost industry operator, with the greatest refining earnings exposure, the largest USGC asset concentration, and the most consistent operating record,"" according to Rao. ""In sum, VLO is best situated to take advantage of the present environment.""J.P. Morgan recently weighed in with a more optimistic outlook for U.S. refineries, rating Valero and Marathon Petroleum as buys."
"Yeah, beat Zack's est. of 27c. Didn't see revenue."
Enjoy the ride.....the charts point to over 100. We haven't had a run up like this in years and who knows when it will happen again. Unfortunately the downside to all of this is the inflationary pressure it will place on the US and interest rates. The Nasdaq is already feeling the consequences and at some point wall street will take serious notice. Eventually the impact gets down to mainstream America...So enjoy now but be smart enough to know when to pull the plug....
"Barrons -- Americans Are Getting Back on the Road. 3 Stocks to Buy.-- By Andrew Bary, May 29, 2020Driving is rebounding as the economy reopens and Americans take to their cars, viewing them as being more protected spaces than airplanes, trains, or other mass transit. That looks bullish for Marathon Petroleum (ticker: MPC) and other big refining stocks, such as Valero Energy (VLO) and Phillips 66 (PSX), that have bounced off their March lows, but are still down an average of 30% this year.Marathon, whose shares trade around $35, is a play on rising gasoline demand. It is also a sum-of-the-parts story, with the No. 1 independent U.S. refiner by capacity planning to spin off its valuable Speedway division by year end.Speedway is the No. 2 company-owned gasoline and convenience-store group in the country, behind only Alimentation Couche-Tard of Canada (ATD.B.Canada). Thanks to high-margin impulse purchases by drivers, convenience stores command higher valuations than supermarket chains. Marathon could be worth more than $50 a share in a breakup.Phillips 66 and Valero are favored by J.P. Morgan analyst Phil Gresh. Valero is a well-managed pure-play refiner with a strong balance sheet. Phillips 66 is the industry leader with the safest dividend, and it offers a “best in class alternative to the oil majors,” Gresh recently wrote. Phillips 66 has refining, pipeline, chemical, and retail businesses—everything except energy production. Marathon yields 6.6%; Valero, 5.8%; and Phillips 66, 4.6%.Gasoline demand was down around 40%, year over year, in April, but the comparison improved to an estimated 20% drop in May, according to Gresh. Investors are focused on gasoline usage during the remainder of 2020. Mizuho analyst Paul Sankey has predicted “record” demand for the fuel this summer, as Americans vacation domestically, rather than taking trips abroad.Gresh is not quite as optimistic, forecasting a 5% drop in demand in the third and fourth quarters. He wrote last week that he saw “negative factors like the recession (unemployment) and telecommuting more than offsetting the positive factors like the shift from air/mass transit to vehicles and the possibility of more staycations this summer.”Gasoline prices, now averaging about $2 a gallon for regular nationally, aren’t expected to rise much this summer, based on futures quotes, even with a strong driving season.The outlook for refining is admittedly not rosy at the moment. Jet fuel demand is weak, and utilization rates are historically low. The entire U.S. industry—with the exception of Phillips 66—is expected to lose money in 2020, but investors are looking out to 2021 and 2022, as they are with other hard-hit industries.And Marathon may be the cheapest stock in the group.At its current share price, investors are effectively paying little or nothing for the company’s refining business when factoring in the potential $20 billion value of Speedway and the $13 billion market value of Marathon’s majority stake in MPLX (MPLX), one of the country’s largest pipeline operators.Credit Suisse’s Manav Gupta wrote this month that he is pleased that Michael Hennigan, who became Marathon’s chief executive in March, is focused on “strict cost control, capital discipline,” and operational improvement. Hennigan’s predecessor, Gary Heminger, was more of an empire builder.The activist investor Elliott Management took aim at Marathon and Heminger last September, arguing that the stock, then around $55, was “severely undervalued” and worth at least $89 a share on a sum-of-the-parts basis.Elliott’s broadside came when the refining business was much stronger than it is now, but if the stock merely gets back to $55, it would be about a 55% gain.#MPC #PSX"
"Going higher than the $82 price target. Many reasons for that. Devaluation of the $$, supply reduction, inflation, DC policies, etc...."
This country is wide open. The interstate in WNC is bumper to bumper. If this stock hit 83 in the early spring.... Why shouldn't I believe it won't hit the 80s between now and November dividend.
"I am at a loss on some topics, but how is it that the markets and politicians could care less about inflation? Am I getting to old to see what is around the corner because I have no idea."
Phillips 66 (PSX) just increased its quarterly dividend by 2% to $0.92 per common share and said it has repaid the $500 million owed on its delayed draw term loan agreement maturing in November 2023.This is not huge but makes a good statement for refiners. #MPC
I hope they locked in lower natural gas prices a few months back. Operating expenses are going to be much higher at these current (and growing) prices heading into winter.
"So, we now have four major fears which are expected to crash the market -- Covid, Fed tapering, debt ceiling, and Asian contagion -- with the latter causing today's unpleasantries. In the background remain fears of growing inflation, higher taxes, and Q3 earnings being hurt by supply chain issues. I know I've forgotten something but I think the ""wall of worry"" is well established.I think that in the next two days, we will know if we are looking at a significant correction or increased volatility. I am still leaning towards the latter but that's admittedly self serving. Good luck."
Oil is under manipulation right now
To be fair - it’s a rarity to see Valero UP on a big down DJIA day . That’s quite a positive going forward IMO .
"The options market definitely feels september will be a down month for oil, but beyond that, they seem to think oil will recover nicely."
Finally.
VLO gets an upgrade from MS and oil is down. VLO is down. So did HFC and they are down. Bad day to get an upgrade.
"Good or bad news, Market up market down, VLO goes down. This will be a long wait to $80, a LONG wait."
"Thoughts about debt ceiling battle and impact on stocks/economy? This has the probability of getting messy pretty quickly and just wondering if people think high yield stocks from the oil and gas space might hold up decently considering product demand globally would remain fairly intact. I really cannot see either side taking a scorched earth approach by burning down the economy to prove a point. If it still doesn't work itself into reconciliation (maybe through ammendment at 11th hour?) I think R's get the D's to concede on limiting the corporate rate increase to 25% plus no cuts to defense in exchange for passage. You can't sell the benefits of FDR 2.0 if the legislation never gets to the spending phase and I think at some point the left will recognize that. I also don't think either side wants their lobbyists hammering them over the corporate increases and this gives a backdoor for both to save face, see their agenda's dinged but intact (assuming there are two agendas...) and provides more than enough attack ad fodder for both in time for October/November deployment."
"Barron's March 26Oil-refiner stocks jumped on Thursday and they could continue their run, one analyst wrote in a note upgrading several stocks. The refiners will undoubtedly be hurt as fewer people use gasoline and other products made from crude oil amid the coronavirus shutdown. Several have already had to cut the amount of crude they are processing. But the stocks have arguably already taken all of that into account and then some, argues Jefferies analyst Chritopher Sighinolfi.Even though Covid-19 will have “a severe impact on 2020 refined product demand, resulting in acute financial pressure in the second and third quarter, we see the virus’s passing, low interest rates, fiscal stimulus, low energy prices, and globally destocked supply chains fueling a return to more normal conditions in 2021,” Sighinolfi writes.The stocks jumped after the Senate passed a stimulus bill that will put more money into the hands of millions of Americans. While crude oil ended the day down more than 7%, gasoline prices were down 0.6%. If product demand improves and crude prices stay low, refiners can make money off the spread between crude and petroleum products. Valero (VLO), one of the largest independent refiners in the U.S., rose 15% on the day.Refiners were in a relatively strong financial position going into this crisis. The industry has changed considerably since the last major economic shock. Some refiners, including Phillips 66 (PSX), have spun off from large integrated companies. Others have also added pipeline businesses that help stabilize their operations.Just as important, they have become more conservative with their balance sheets and “are sitting on meaningful cash positions and largely undrawn and substantial liquidity facilities,” Sighinolfi writes.Based on analysts’ 2021 estimates, almost all the refiners are trading below 10 times earnings, with some trading below 6 times.Sighiolfi upgraded five stocks to Buy from Hold. They included HollyFrontier (HFC), Holly Energy Partners (HEP), Phillips 66 Partners (PSXP), Phillips 66 and Valero."

"Opinion -- Too many people seem to be accepting the “science” that global warming is 100% caused by man’s burning of fossil fuels. I don’t have answers but I think all of us should have questions.The first question is why all these US climate issues are peaking now, while man-made air pollution was much higher several decades ago. There are several sites that report continuous improvement in US air quality. The following is from the EPA.“Air Quality Trends Show Clean Air ProgressNationally, concentrations of air pollutants have dropped significantly since 1990:Carbon Monoxide (CO) 8-Hour, 78%Lead (Pb) 3-Month Average, 85% (from 2010)Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) Annual, 59%Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) 1-Hour, 51%Ozone (O3) 8-Hour, 25%Particulate Matter 10 microns (PM10) 24-Hour, 46%Particulate Matter 2.5 microns (PM2.5) Annual, 43% (from 2000)Particulate Matter 2.5 microns (PM2.5) 24-Hour, 44% (from 2000)Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) 1-Hour, 90%Numerous air toxics have declined with percentages varying by pollutantDuring this same period, the U.S. economy continued to grow, Americans drove more miles, and population and energy use increased.”The second question should be about the possibility of alternative explanations. The ""science"" says the sun is growing larger and brighter and will envelope the earth in 5 billion years. Solar flares and sunspots, the heat generated from the sun, the tilt of the earth, and the distance of the earth from the sun, are all assumed to be constant. Yet the ""science"" says the sun is quite active. Again, I don’t know the answer. I just have the questions.The final question is to what extent does the US contribute to the global level of carbon dioxide. Do we make a real difference? The US emitted 5.3 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2018, making up 15% of the world’s emissions. This will be significantly lower in the past two years for reasons related to the pandemic. The Chinese have recently gone back to burning coal. Only Europe seems committed to cutting CO2 emissions. Each of you can evaluate the commitment of your home state. Please share your views if you’re so inclined. There are no right answers. #MPC #PSX"

"BEIRUT, Aug 22 (Reuters) - The Lebanese government said on Sunday that it was raising gasoline prices by 66% in a partial reduction of fuel subsidies as it seeks to ease crippling shortages that have brought the country to a standstill.The increase in 95-octane gasoline prices would take effect immediately, the government said in a statement. It follows the state's decision on Saturday to change the exchange rate used to price petroleum products in a bid to ease the shortages.The fuel crisis worsened this month when the central bank said it could no longer finance fuel imports at heavily subsidised exchange rates and would switch to market rates.The government, concerned about the impact of price rises, in a compromise agreed with the central bank on Saturday to raise prices, but by less than the market rate, to allow subsidised imports to resume for now.￼<img src=""https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/USJVNYCQTBOU3N2QAWSK5L6YRQ.jpg"" alt=""People push their cars due to a lack of fuel, near a gas station in Dora, Lebanon, August 17, 2021.

"MS has apparently not yet replaced Benny Wong, the analyst that covered refiners. Thus, no comments were released after earnings. As always, MS does make Morningstar reports available -- although these carry much less weight with markets. The Morningstar opinion is best summarized as follows:""Our fair value estimate ($81) and narrow moat rating are unchanged. Although the economic recovery willremain bumpy, especially as an international recovery lags the U.S., we continue to expect a return inrefined product demand to prepandemic levels. This should allow for higher utilization rates and strongmargins. With the recent sell-off, Valero shares are looking more attractive. Outside of the macroenvironment, Valero remains well positioned given its high-quality asset base and leadership position inrenewable diesel where expansion projects are ongoing"
A 5% increase in dividend would put VLO at $4.12 per annum and ~5.35% yield at current price. Just an observation...

"Never let it be said that I only post positive articles on refiners""Refiners Have Gotten a Boost from the Power Crunch. It Won’t Last.""Barron’s Oct. 12, 2021 #MPC #PSXOil refiners are heading into earnings season on a strong run. The pandemic is easing in much of the world, leading to higher demand for gasoline and aviation fuel. The natural gas shortage that’s causing gas prices to rise around the world is causing some gas-users to switch to oil products for generating electricity, further boosting demand. And those trends are boosting the bottom line: Refiners are likely to post their first quarter of solidly positive earnings since the pandemic started. The stocks of most U.S.-based refiners are up 10% to 20% in the past month. Phillips 66 (ticker: PSX) is leading the pack, up 23%. Valero Energy (VLO) has risen 19%, HollyFrontier (HFC) is up 13%, and Marathon Petroleum (MPC) is up 11%. “It makes for a good short-term view,” said Citigroup analyst Prashant Rao in an interview.But the medium and longer term isn’t as rosy for refiners. There are at least three negative trends that could slow their rebound, and even send the stocks in reverse.The most immediate danger is that high prices for oil products will start to erode demand for those products. High oil prices could cause people to use less of it, or government policies meant to curb high costs could force changes in behavior.“Right now there’s a very, very positive environment,” Rao said. “But there’s some fears around what happens later in the winter.” Another problem is that a quirk in the market that has historically helped U.S. refiners isn’t helping them quite as much anymore. There has been a spread between the international price of crude oil and the U.S. price for several years. The international price, Brent, has traded at higher levels than the U.S. one, West Texas Intermediate, or WTI. That’s because there was an oversupply of U.S. oil. U.S. refiners were able to buy U.S. crude at low prices and process it into products that they sent overseas, making a wider margin than their international competitors.But U.S. producers have been pumping out less oil this year because they’re more focused on fixing their balance sheets than drilling new wells. The spread between Brent and WTI is now about $3, versus $6 two years ago.The third challenge is potentially an even more consequential and long-lasting one. More refineries are being built around the world, at a rate that is outpacing demand for oil products, Rao said. The pandemic may have slowed oil demand, but it didn’t slow refinery projects enough. So even as refiners work to get back to their prior operating levels, new competitors are getting close to opening.“Because you lost a year of oil demand, you had too many refiners in the world,” he said. “And now there’s new refineries in the Middle East and China coming on top of that. You’re going to have excess capacity for multiple years is what it looks like.”Refining capacity is likely to outpace demand by 1 million to 2 million barrels a day in the next two to three years, Rao said. As in any industry, too much capacity hurts prices, and the analyst expects refiner profitability to “take a step down from where it was before the pandemic.”Rao still likes some names. In particular, Valero still has particularly profitable operations, and is among the furthest along in transitioning to renewable fuels, including renewable diesel. In the next two to three years, about a quarter of its cash flows are likely to come from non-petroleum sources, he said."
"Oil can't hold any gain. Zero news from the last three days that is in anyway negative. Price of oil keeps to steadily climb. Carry forward prices across the board also increasing. Oil stocks: slight increase followed by corresponding drop, then continued drop. Hold the line, baby."

"The New Test Facing Big-Energy CEOs: How to Be Credible in PublicStephen Arbogast Barrons June 4, 2021 Excerpts""In reality, the energy CEOs’ challenge goes well beyond communications. The real issues in the transition to a lower-carbon energy future remain largely submerged. What are these issues? First, are the solutions touted by climate activists—such as wind and solar power and battery storage—really adequate to accomplish the goals? Second, what collateral damage are we willing to accept in pursuit of the transition goals? Those might include higher energy costs, grid instability, geopolitical consequences, lifestyle changes, and slower economic growth. Third, what trade-offs are climate activists willing to make to give industry and governments more-feasible and lower-cost transition pathways?To illustrate the third issue, are climate activists ready to support long-distance transmission lines or pipelines to carry carbon dioxide? Oklahoma wind power could be economical in North Carolina, but that would require new power lines through four states. Technology exists to capture CO2 at the natural-gas power plants that keep the grid reliable, but use or storage of that CO2 probably involves transporting it to the Gulf Coast. Shifting the discussion to such issues with enough credibility to facilitate negotiations with diverse stakeholders now lies at the heart of the CEOs’ public role.To get to net zero emissions by 2050, Duke must grow its electricity generation fleet from today’s 58 gigawatts to 105 GW. Some of this growth will meet higher demand as the economy electrifies. A good deal involves replacing high-capacity power generation, like coal plants, with intermittent generation. Adding renewables, even with battery storage, doesn’t compensate for shuttered fossil fuel or nuclear capacity. Even after a 40 GW buildout of wind and solar, Duke will need to extend its existing nuclear fleet and keep considerable natural gas in the mix. Finally, there are 13 GW of we-don’t-know-what in the resource plan. Duke called them “zero emissions, load following resources,” or Zelfrs. Small modular nuclear reactors and carbon capture were mentioned as possible solutions.This exercise in reality-checking brings up many issues for discussion. How much capital would be required? What will it cost, and what power prices would be required to accomplish it? What consequences does it pose for other issues, like the competitiveness of North Carolina’s economy? Will the Zelfrs materialize? Would less aggressive decarbonization by Duke yield a better overall solution? Duke hasn’t yet provided its answers to such questions. But now there is a framework within which to discuss them. This kind of comprehensive framework empowers CEOs to present the difficult realities facing them and address them with shareholders, investors, and society.Oil and gas firms face a harder credibility challenge. Their business appears more directly threatened, and it’s more difficult for them to see new business opportunities that promise attractive returns.One credibility test will involve carbon capture sequestration/utilization. Developed at scale, it could preserve much energy infrastructure and be useful in the developing world, where fewer transition options exist. But for it to emerge, oil and gas CEOs are going to have to move beyond mere messaging. They are going to have to prove that they have capture technology, and invest the money to show that it works at scale and can be deployed in some locations where, with current incentives, it can reward investors. Creating some facts on the ground like these would better position fossil-fuel CEOs to take up other issues that they properly feel shouldn’t remain submerged.Over time, the transition will require all energy CEOs to address the submerged issues in their sector or face challenges from investors and the public. For example, at some point, renewable-firm CEOs will be called to address renewables’ “all-in costs,” the natural limits to their growth, and the necessary complements to their deployment. The sooner all energy CEOs can move their messaging to their action plans for addressing such complex challenges, the sooner we can achieve an affordable transition that mitigates serious climate risk.""#MPC #PSX"
"When the supplies get tight, and Mr. Market realizes it is not going to see rapid resumption of levels required (due to Bide. Policies here, lack of Russian concern for our lroble.s, and an OPEC much closer to capacity than widely believed), a rapid run up of the price of oil to upper 80's at least will occur. Since most firms in this industry are already seeing big FCF increases, prices will pop. We have been more than patient and I believe that is about to be rewarded."

Distillate inventories dropped 1.7 million barrels in the week. Distillate demand was stronger than last weekProduction of gasoline last week averaged 9.3 million bpd, which compared with 10.1 million bpd a week earlier.

"Outline of MS 2/23/21 Note on refining outlook (actual note too long to post)""We hosted a webcast with refining experts at Turner, Mason & Co. and had a discussion on their recently published 2021 refining outlook, demand recovery, crude differentials, and the potential for more refinery closures. We offer our 5 key takeaways and a summary of the discussion.1) The full impact of the Texas freeze is expected to extend beyond the immediate areas affected. 2) Light-heavy differentials expected to widen over the next year. 3) Refinery closures could take a pause this year, but 2022+ could see another surge. (note refers to Chinese teapot refiners -- reasoning not really explained)4) Robust margins expected over the next couple of years coming out of COVID.5) Don't see peak demand until beyond 2040… Contrary to many consultant forecasts, TMC does not see peak demand occurring within the scope of their forecast, which extends out to 2040. They are generally more optimistic than many other analysts, forecasting stronger product demand recovery and longterm growth. That said, they do acknowledge that the pace of demand growth should slow over time."
I read the cc transcript over the weekend and liked it very much. Things look set for a strong rebound. Management were not concerned about RIN prices so I guess in reality the RINs only matter to those who are short the stock.Amazing price action today which follows pattern over the last few months.

"Goldman Sachs analyst Neil Mehta also released top 2020 picks in oil and gas, looking in particular at major oil companies and refiners. Among the majors, he prefers Chevron (CVX) and ConocoPhillips (COP) to Exxon Mobil (XOM). Exxon has been spending more aggressively than its two competitors on increasing production. “Our stance continues to prefer companies that have superior free cash flow generation and returns profiles, which trade at discounted valuation multiples,” Mehta wrote.Among refiners, Mehta prefers Valero (VL)), Marathon Petroleum (MPC) and Phillips 66 (PSX), which should benefit from new United Nations standards for shipping fuel that should increase demand for higher-margin cleaner fuels. Those so-called IMO 2020 rules go into effect on Jan. 1. Among those stocks, Marathon is Mehta’s favorite."

"Gas Prices May Keep Rising After Labor Day. Blame Hurricane Ida -- Barron’s 9/2/21 #MPC #PSXLabor Day weekend traditionally signals the conclusion of the U.S. summer driving season, but it may not mark the end of the peak period for gasoline prices, which stand near their highest since 2014.Atlantic storm Ida, which hit the U.S. Gulf Coast as a Category 4 hurricane on Aug. 29, led to the shutdown of some key Gulf Coast refinery operations, and it’s still not clear when those may fully resume.On Wednesday, Entergy (ticker: ETR), which provides power for states including Louisiana and Mississippi, said it would take time to fully restore power given significant damage across the region. The Wall Street Journal reported it could take weeks to resume refinery operations due to widespread power outages.· The disruption comes at a time of increased travel, and as gasoline consumption continues to recover from the effects of Covid restrictions on the economy.Gasoline demand has been strong over this summer, at around 3.5% below 2019 levels, says Ken Robinson, market research manager at workforce management and reimbursement platform Motus. Travel volume data suggest that people “remain more comfortable driving than flying.”U.S. motor gasoline supplied, a proxy for demand, was at 9.5 million barrels per day on average over the four weeks ended Aug. 27, up from 8.9 million barrels per day the same period a year earlier, according to the Energy Information Administration. For roughly the same period in 2019, implied demand was at 9.7 million barrels per day.Gasoline may still have room to rise as Robinson expects Ida, which affected offshore wells, ports, refineries and pipelines, to “drive gas prices to their 2021 peak.” He estimates a potential, but temporary, five- to nine-cent increase in prices due to the storm that would likely ease off by early October “at the latest.”Retail gasoline prices have already inched higher following the storm, with the average national price at $3.174 a gallon on Sept. 1, up from the week-earlier average of $3.147, according to AAA. Reformulated gasoline futures haven’t climbed over the past seven days but at $2.11, gained nearly 76% from 52 weeks ago.Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at travel and navigation app GasBuddy, predicts an even larger price impact from the storm. Ida may lead to a five- to 15-cent per gallon rise in retail gasoline prices, he says, and a rise at the top end of that range would mark a new peak for prices this year. The worst-case scenario would be several weeks of power outages at refineries that lead to a retail gasoline price spike of more than 15 cents, he says.Either way, the potential for more disruptions remains since Atlantic hurricane season remains far from over. The season officially ends on Nov. 30 and the National Hurricane Center shows three more weather systems brewing in the Atlantic basin.Gasoline demand traditionally slows down after Labor Day, and prices for the fuel typically start to decline, says Andrew Gross, a spokesman for AAA. With the increasing Covid case numbers, he said AAA would expect prices to decrease.However, the hurricane season stands as an important “caveat that could spike gas prices,” he says. The impact of a significant storm like Ida could be “felt for weeks in terms of regional spikes in gas prices due to demand, infrastructure damage, and transportation issues,” says Gross.With prices so close to the year’s high, it wouldn’t take much to reach a new peak. In early August, gasoline prices reached $3.19 a gallon, the highest in seven years, according to Gross.It’s likely that while gasoline prices may ease in the post-Ida period, they will probably remain above $3 a gallon through early fall, he says."
"For what it's worth, nine moderate House Democrats -- enough to block passage -- told the Speaker on Friday that they will not vote for a budget resolution meant to pave the way for the passage of a $3.5 trillion social policy package."
Looks like China's efforts to go all in on electric cars has backfired. I don't know if you have been reading up on it or not but China has a severe electricity shortage. Coal stocks are way down and natural gas prices have skyrocketed to $30/mmbtu. They are shutting down numerous industries to conserve electricity and will contribute greatly to all the supply chain shortage we are having now. How does this world think we can go all in on electric cars when there seems to be problems everywhere on providing the electric we just need today?
"$4.20 per gallon of gas. Sure, refiners are hurting..."

"Thank goodness for pipelines!Canadian oil exports to the U.S. jump with new pipeline startupBy Bloomberg Thursday, October 7, 2021, 6:38 AM MDTOil barrels Source: iStock/Guven PolatCanadian oil shipments to the U.S. jumped to the highest volume since the start of the year thanks in part to the startup of a long-delayed Canadian pipeline. Weekly oil deliveries from America’s northern neighbour reached 4.04 million barrels day, the most since January, according to the Energy Information Administration. It’s only the third time the U.S. has imported more than 4 million barrels a day of Canadian crude since the agency began compiling weekly data in 2010.It’s likely these increased flows will be the new norm mainly because of the expanded Line 3, said Elisabeth Murphy, ESAI Energy LLC upstream analyst for North America. In fact, weekly volumes should start to average closer to 3.7-3.8 million barrels a day from here, from current levels of around 3.5 million, she added. New course on scope 2 and scope 3 emissions that are generated due to the production of oil and gas products.Click hereThe additional barrels from Canada come as a relief to U.S. refiners struggling with less supply from OPEC+, shrinking imports from Latin America, and more recently, the loss of about 30 million barrels of Gulf of Mexico production after Hurricane Ida. Gulf Coast refineries have increasingly been pulling from Canada to offset the crude production in the Gulf of Mexico that remains shut since Hurricane Ida swept through over a month ago, said Shirin Lakhani, director of global oil service at Rapidan Energy Group.Last week, Enbridge Inc. started its new Line 3 crude pipeline after years of delays. It can transport 760,000 barrels a day of heavy and light oil, nearly double the size of the old line it replaced.#mpc, #psx, #hfc"

"MS 9/29 paper - Feedback on Our Launch & What's Changed (Highlights only)Following our initiation, our investor conversations suggest a marked preference for producers vs. refiners, though MPC is a popular holding. The largest development since our launch has been increasing clarity on biofuels policy, which alleviates near-term RINs pressure, but will drive LT uptake.Reminder of our thesis — bullish sector outlook on oil demand recovery, low valuations. What's happened since our launch? The market has moved into a relatively ""riskon"" mindset over the past few days in light of major supply constraints across key commodities, driving the R&M group higher in sympathy with the broader Energy sector. Valuation remains compelling, in our view. Market-wide fundamentals have been mixed. Crack spreads have softened somewhat as most refineries restarted shortly following Hurricane Ida, while crude oil production was more meaningfully impacted. Importantly, though, product-specific dynamics have been moving in line with our thesis (strengthening jet/diesel pricing, gasoline more stagnant). Demand data points from weekly DOE figures have been solid, largely on robust diesel demand. Our focus remains on data points that point to the path forward in 2022, and here, we continue to watch COVID case trends, which have shown signs of the Delta wave plateauing abroad and declining in the S , and broader mobility measures, which generally point to continued recovery in transportation activity. The two largest changes since our launch were on the biofuels front. First, the draft budget reconciliation language released by the House Ways & Means Committee would provide a meaningful tailwind for biofuels producers through the end of the decade. We detailed the impact on sustainable aviation fuel in particular here, but also note that the potential extension of the $1.00/gal renewable diesel blender's tax credit is a major tailwind for producers (most exposed right now: VLO, with HFC and MPC next). Second, Reuters reported that the EPA has recommended meaningfully reduced blending requirements for the 2020 and 2021 Renewable Volume Obligation (RVO). This has caused Renewable Identification Number (RIN) pricing to fall materially, effectively lowering the cost refiners face to offset their petroleum-based fuels production. The market has traded this relatively fairly, in our view, with refiners outperforming biofuels producers, andespecially those like PBF who have explicitly stated that they have not been purchasing RINs at elevated prices. Long term, the direction of travel is clear, though US biofuels policies and Low Carbon Fuel Standards are likely to increasingly favor biofuels production. Refiners without a meaningful biofuels strategy will likely face lower multiples and, potentially, more pressure on cash flows. #MPC #PSX"

Originally, only about half of Baton Rouge was shut, but eventually was forced to shut down fully, a company spokesperson said Aug. 30.""The ExxonMobil Baton Rouge Refinery is shutting down units to stabilize operations. Once we confirm we have access to needed feedstocks and third-party utilities to stabilize our systems, we will begin the process of returning to normal operations,"" said Julie King in an email.King said that the refinery and adjacent chemical plant did not sustain any significant damage during the storm.At Marathon's 578,000 b/d Garyville refinery, operations were shuttered prior to arrival of the storm.""Our Garyville refinery was safely shut down prior to Hurricane Ida's arrival. We are currently assessing a timeline for safely resuming operations,"" said Jamal Kheiry, Marathon spokesperson via an Aug. 30 email.75% refining capacity impactedAlmost 75% of Louisiana's refining capacity was impacted by Hurricane Ida as of Aug. 30, which made landfall on the 16th anniversary of the deadly Hurricane Katrina back in 2005.Louisiana has about 2.95 million b/d of crude processing capacity, according to the most recent information from the Energy Information Administration.Refineries in the western part of the state clustered around the oil hub of Lake Charles and Port Arthur, Texas, were operating, albeit at reduced rates.Citgo Petroleum, which had slightly reduced rates at 418,000 b/d Lake Charles refinery, had returned to full capacity.

@Dennis Can you confirm for me that the VLO Indicators for crack spreads have taken into account the impact of RINs? It seems there is a note stating it is adjusted for RINs. I tried to calculate VLO Indicator Crack Spread by the formula on the website but couldn't match the indicator number VLO shows. Have you tried to calculate their crack spreads?
