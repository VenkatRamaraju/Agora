Valero price Target raised to 93 by Argus Research.
VLO……$100 is coming!
"Argus analyst Bill Selesky raised the price target on Valero Energy (NYSE: VLO) to $93.00 (from $83.00) while maintaining a Buy rating.The analyst commented, ""We are reiterating our BUY rating on Valero Energy Corp. (NYSE: VLO) and raising our price target to $93 from $83 amid strengthening refining industry fundamentals, including gasoline crack spreads that have risen substantially over the last month. We expect Valero to see higher demand for gasoline over the remainder of the year and into 2022, as well as increased demand for diesel and jet fuel. We also look for improved refining margins. As such, we expect sales and earnings to rise in the coming quarters. Over the long term, we expect Valero to benefit from its size, scale, and diversified business portfolio, which includes refining, midstream, chemicals, and marketing and specialty operations."""
VLO adj. earnings of $1.22 vs. est. of $.94 and sales of $29.52B vs. est of $$24.55B.

"OT -- Goldman Cools on Conoco But Likes 8 Other Oil Stocks -- Barron’s Oct 11, 2021 #MPC #PSX""The price of oil keeps rising, and the stocks of oil companies with it. Now, some analysts think the strategy of how to play the rebound is changing, too.For much of the past two years, investors and analysts have been focused on which oil companies can keep their costs down and send more of their profits back to investors as dividends and share buybacks. That’s led to more companies reducing their drilling budgets, paying off debts and slowing down plans to explore for new oil deposits.But there’s a counterargument to that strategy.There’s evidence now that demand for oil and gas isn’t going away in the near term, and the next few years will actually be characterized by high prices and underinvestment. That’s why Saudi Arabia is investing in expanding its production capacity to 13 million barrels a day from 12 million, even as U.S. and European oil firms slim down and reduce production. Goldman Sachs analyst Neil Mehta thinks that investors ought to consider companies that have access to long-term sources of oil and gas. Mehta picked eight of those companies as potential investments that can pay off over time as oil prices stay high amid a supply shortage.Goldman forecasts that the world will use 106 million barrels of oil per day in 2030, versus assumptions from European oil companies that demand will be around 100 million barrels. The eight stocks should return 18% in the next year, on average, Mehta predicts.Hess (ticker: HES) owns a stake in a major oil project off the coast of Guyana in partnership with ExxonMobil (XOM) and Chinese company CNOOC (883Hong Kong) that is expected to produce considerable amounts of oil for the next decade. Mehta expects the company to increase its cash flow by 15% a year through 2030, from $10 per share this year to $30 in 2030. He sees shares rising to $106 from a recent $92.Exxon’s Guyana project, and its refining, chemicals and liquefied natural gas divisions give it one of the strongest asset bases in Big Oil, according to Mehta. He sees shares rising to $68 from a recent $62.50.Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) has one of the largest positions in the Permian Basin that Mehta expects to pay dividends for years — literally and figuratively. Pioneer has a variable dividend policy that could offer investors a dividend yield of 11% in 2022, Mehta estimates. He sees shares rising to $213 from a recent $196.Occidental Petroleum (OXY) has been held back for the past couple of years because it added substantial debt when it bought competitor Anadarko Petroleum. But investors may be overlooking the strength of its resource base in the U.S. and Middle East, as well as its chemicals division, Mehta asserts. He sees shares rising to $40 from a recent $34.Small-cap Kosmos Energy (KOS) has promise because of an offshore natural gas project in West Africa that it’s constructing with BP (BP), Mehta writes. It’s expected to start service in the second half of 2023. He sees shares rising to $4 from a recent $3.30.Mehta also likes three Canadian oil companies — Cenovus (CVE), Suncor (SU) and Canadian Natural Resources (CNQ). He thinks they own resources that should pump out oil for years, and deserve more attention from American investors. Mehta has become less positive on ConocoPhillips (COP), though. He downgraded his rating to Neutral from Buy based on the company’s outperformance in recent months. It’s up 73% since his February upgrade, versus 15% for the S&P 500. He sees 4% total return for the stock in the next year, less than other oil stocks."
Really good to see VLO shrugging off Goldman's valueless opinion today.
It's a beautiful day when you look through your portfolio and discover that you had your financial advisor buy 100 shares of VLO last summer and forgot about it :)

"Thank goodness for pipelines!Canadian oil exports to the U.S. jump with new pipeline startupBy Bloomberg Thursday, October 7, 2021, 6:38 AM MDTOil barrels Source: iStock/Guven PolatCanadian oil shipments to the U.S. jumped to the highest volume since the start of the year thanks in part to the startup of a long-delayed Canadian pipeline. Weekly oil deliveries from America’s northern neighbour reached 4.04 million barrels day, the most since January, according to the Energy Information Administration. It’s only the third time the U.S. has imported more than 4 million barrels a day of Canadian crude since the agency began compiling weekly data in 2010.It’s likely these increased flows will be the new norm mainly because of the expanded Line 3, said Elisabeth Murphy, ESAI Energy LLC upstream analyst for North America. In fact, weekly volumes should start to average closer to 3.7-3.8 million barrels a day from here, from current levels of around 3.5 million, she added. New course on scope 2 and scope 3 emissions that are generated due to the production of oil and gas products.Click hereThe additional barrels from Canada come as a relief to U.S. refiners struggling with less supply from OPEC+, shrinking imports from Latin America, and more recently, the loss of about 30 million barrels of Gulf of Mexico production after Hurricane Ida. Gulf Coast refineries have increasingly been pulling from Canada to offset the crude production in the Gulf of Mexico that remains shut since Hurricane Ida swept through over a month ago, said Shirin Lakhani, director of global oil service at Rapidan Energy Group.Last week, Enbridge Inc. started its new Line 3 crude pipeline after years of delays. It can transport 760,000 barrels a day of heavy and light oil, nearly double the size of the old line it replaced.#mpc, #psx, #hfc"
VLO reported improved crack spread indicators on their website this morning especially Gulf coast. Ethanol and Renewable diesel prices are also looking very favorable. If these crack spreads and prices hold VLO should easily crush the analyst 4th Q earnings estimate. A couple other positives are 1) Jet fuel consumption should increase as international travel picks up in November and 2) additional renewable diesel capacity goes online this quarter. I'm anxious to listen to the conference call Thursday. Hopefully some positive news but a little worried as to impact of Ida on earnings.

"Ah yes, the corruption of Goldman Sachs. Early in the week you knew by looking at the put options that VLO would drop hard below $79. The analyst covering the stock reiterates his sell order but increases his target price by a few dollars, as usual. This is how GS makes its extraordinary profits. They are not so much smarter than anybody else. Having a former CEO as Treasury Secretary also helps although that is not the case at the present time. This is just my opinion of course."
A 5% increase in dividend would put VLO at $4.12 per annum and ~5.35% yield at current price. Just an observation...
"San Francisco gasoline price surges as storm disrupts area refineriesOct. 25, 2021 5:55 PM ETSpot gasoline prices in the San Francisco area are poised to hit record highs as record rainfall caused disruptions at two northern California refineries, Bloomberg reports.Physical gasoline prices surged $0.125 to the strongest premium over Nymex gasoline futures since mid-August, according to the report, as traders expect supplies will tighten in the days ahead.Chevron's (NYSE:CVX) Richmond refinery reportedly shut multiple units on Sunday with elevated flaring observed, and PBF Energy's (NYSE:PBF) Martinez refinery experienced an operational upset, according to a regulatory filing.Valero Energy's (NYSE:VLO) Benicia refinery already was down from the start of the month due to scheduled maintenance.Retail prices in the city were averaging $4.727/gal today, according to AAA, just a penny short of a record high set in 2012.The National Weather Service says the heavy rain and winds along the West Coast were caused by a ""bomb cyclone"" and an ""atmospheric river.""#MPC, #PSX, #HFC"
"Never let it be said that I only post positive articles on refiners""Refiners Have Gotten a Boost from the Power Crunch. It Won’t Last.""Barron’s Oct. 12, 2021 #MPC #PSXOil refiners are heading into earnings season on a strong run. The pandemic is easing in much of the world, leading to higher demand for gasoline and aviation fuel. The natural gas shortage that’s causing gas prices to rise around the world is causing some gas-users to switch to oil products for generating electricity, further boosting demand. And those trends are boosting the bottom line: Refiners are likely to post their first quarter of solidly positive earnings since the pandemic started. The stocks of most U.S.-based refiners are up 10% to 20% in the past month. Phillips 66 (ticker: PSX) is leading the pack, up 23%. Valero Energy (VLO) has risen 19%, HollyFrontier (HFC) is up 13%, and Marathon Petroleum (MPC) is up 11%. “It makes for a good short-term view,” said Citigroup analyst Prashant Rao in an interview.But the medium and longer term isn’t as rosy for refiners. There are at least three negative trends that could slow their rebound, and even send the stocks in reverse.The most immediate danger is that high prices for oil products will start to erode demand for those products. High oil prices could cause people to use less of it, or government policies meant to curb high costs could force changes in behavior.“Right now there’s a very, very positive environment,” Rao said. “But there’s some fears around what happens later in the winter.” Another problem is that a quirk in the market that has historically helped U.S. refiners isn’t helping them quite as much anymore. There has been a spread between the international price of crude oil and the U.S. price for several years. The international price, Brent, has traded at higher levels than the U.S. one, West Texas Intermediate, or WTI. That’s because there was an oversupply of U.S. oil. U.S. refiners were able to buy U.S. crude at low prices and process it into products that they sent overseas, making a wider margin than their international competitors.But U.S. producers have been pumping out less oil this year because they’re more focused on fixing their balance sheets than drilling new wells. The spread between Brent and WTI is now about $3, versus $6 two years ago.The third challenge is potentially an even more consequential and long-lasting one. More refineries are being built around the world, at a rate that is outpacing demand for oil products, Rao said. The pandemic may have slowed oil demand, but it didn’t slow refinery projects enough. So even as refiners work to get back to their prior operating levels, new competitors are getting close to opening.“Because you lost a year of oil demand, you had too many refiners in the world,” he said. “And now there’s new refineries in the Middle East and China coming on top of that. You’re going to have excess capacity for multiple years is what it looks like.”Refining capacity is likely to outpace demand by 1 million to 2 million barrels a day in the next two to three years, Rao said. As in any industry, too much capacity hurts prices, and the analyst expects refiner profitability to “take a step down from where it was before the pandemic.”Rao still likes some names. In particular, Valero still has particularly profitable operations, and is among the furthest along in transitioning to renewable fuels, including renewable diesel. In the next two to three years, about a quarter of its cash flows are likely to come from non-petroleum sources, he said."
What we saw a couple of minutes ago is called spoofing. VLO was pushed down 70 cents in about a minute. Who knows but I point the finger at Goldman.

"So I've got one for you all (#PSX, #MPC, #VLO, #HFC). I was looking at earnings reports tonight, noticed I had somehow missed VLO's earnings, which were reported back on 10-21-21. I thought, how can this be, I'm usually pretty good at keeping abreast of such things. Then I checked the ""new and improved"" Yahoo Finance Company Earnings Calendar. No joke, they don't list VLO reporting earnings on 10-21-21. It gets better. For PSX, they don't report earnings will be posted on 10-29. Ditto for MPC and HFC. I'm sure there will be a ""conspiracy theorist"" out there, so please know like always, I did my due diligence. Last earnings cycle (May), all the oil majors, minors, midstreams, refiners, you name it, all were included. I post the average number of earnings that were posted during peak weeks"
Going up on Monday
Report showing volume at Cushing is down & a slight build in inventories. IMO it is seasonal. I doubt this will be a sustained trend since the government has kinked-off production & people will not be quick to change driving habits. As we get closer to the holidays volume will increase & oil/refiners as well.
Phillips 66 (PSX) just increased its quarterly dividend by 2% to $0.92 per common share and said it has repaid the $500 million owed on its delayed draw term loan agreement maturing in November 2023.This is not huge but makes a good statement for refiners. #MPC
"Tighter supplies drive Asian gasoline margins higherPublished date: 26 October 2021Firmer regional demand, refinery disruptions and reduced Chinese supplies have all combined to propel Asian gasoline margins to their highest level since December 2015.The Asian gasoline margin, or the Argus 92R Singapore gasoline price against Ice Brent crude, has increased to $16.91/bl, the highest level since 14 December 2015 when it was $17.42/bl.Margins had already been on the rise since the end of September with reduced shipments from key supplier China.

Enjoy the ride.....the charts point to over 100. We haven't had a run up like this in years and who knows when it will happen again. Unfortunately the downside to all of this is the inflationary pressure it will place on the US and interest rates. The Nasdaq is already feeling the consequences and at some point wall street will take serious notice. Eventually the impact gets down to mainstream America...So enjoy now but be smart enough to know when to pull the plug....
"For anyone interested, these are the 10/18 MS comments on Delek, Holly Frontier, and PBF Energy. Delek (DK): We are constructive into 3Q as we see scope for near-term upward revisions, largely driven by the company's Refining segment. Beyond near-term operational updates, we expect focus on the call to center around potential for the company to receive Small Refinery Exemptions (SREs) from the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program. We currently do model this occurring and treat it as a one-time ~$180MM windfall in 4Q from RINs monetization. Meanwhile, incremental focus will likely be on DK's updated thoughts around a potential buy-in to the Bakersfield renewable diesel project operated by GCE Holdings Acquisitions, LLC, and any further planned expansion in the company's Retail business.HollyFrontier (HFC): We are cautious into 3Q earnings season. While we are quite constructive on the LT potential for HFC and see a significant upward revision in 2022 on strip commodity prices, we see limited scope for revisions in Q3 and Q4, largely due to the planned maintenance at the company's Navajo, NM refinery, which will limit the company's ability to capitalize on near-term market strength. We expect focus on the call to be on closing timelines for the company's acquisition of Sinclair Oil and Shell's Puget Sound Refinery, as well as a status update on its renewable diesel project in Artesia, NM. We are currently modeling the ramp-up of renewable diesel production through 1H22, a 4Q closing for Puget Sound, and a mid-2022 closing of Sinclair Oil.PBF Energy (PBF): We are neutral into 3Q earnings as we see some noise in 3Q estimates due to differing treatment of the company's expected RIN mark-to-market. Some leading edge estimates >$250MM appear quite aggressive to us, though we do expect the company to benefit from a meaningfully improving macro environment. We expect focus will largely center around major cash uses into year-end and early 2022. The company had guided to ~$550MM of cash outflows in 2H related to environmental programs, and has not been buying RINs at elevated prices to meet its 2021 obligations. Meanwhile, PBF continues to evaluate whether to move forward with its proposed renewable diesel project in Chalmette, LA – the company recently said that it expects to reach final investment decision is expected in the coming months, and we therefore could see scope for an update here in 3Q."

"MS --3Q EPS Preview: Rising Tide -- Oct 18, 2021 #MPC #PSXIndustry indicators strengthening as gasoline and diesel demand remain robust; jet is starting to look healthier. Demand data points since our launch have been strong. Jet fuel, the laggard to this point, has seen demand trend closer to the 5Y average, while diesel demand has been exceptionally strong. Product cracks are reflecting these improvements, with both diesel and jet cracks moving back towards their pre-COVID levels. Meanwhile, gasoline cracks have come down somewhat vs. our prior deck, but net-net, our price deck for 2022 has moved materially higher (~$2-3/bbl). Regionally, Midwest and Midcon cracks have strengthened the most vs. our prior update, generally resulting in more significant revisions for inland-oriented refiners like MPC and HFC. We do not expect the market will fully pay for these high prices on the curve right now, but we do think it will nonetheless reward beats-and-raises across the group this quarter.Picks into earnings and what we are watching: We are generally in line with consensus in 3Q, so our tactical picks are focused on revisions to 4Q21 and 2022 — we expect the largest positive near-term revisions out of MPC and VLO on the large cap side, and DK and PBF among the small/mid caps. Meanwhile, we see more limited near-term revisions to PSX and HFC. We expect the overall demand recovery will be front and center, but beyond this, biofuels have been the most topical point in our investor conversations. Based on the current project pipeline, there is growing concern that the industry is already set to overbuild biofuels capacity, but there are potential mitigating factors on both the demand (more states adopting Low Carbon Fuel Standards) and supply side (project slippage/cancellation). MPC and HFC will likely have the most attention on their projects, as MPC has yet to share a fully-loaded budget and HFC is currently running a bit over budget vs. initial guidance. We expect updates on Hurricane Ida's impact will be given, but only see PSX's Alliance facility as at risk of serious investment need, or potential sale/shutdown.Raising estimates and price targets on higher price deck. As discussed above, our average cracks are ~$2-3/bbl higher in 2022. We are risking our capture assumptions somewhat, and assume a certain degree of multiple compression on these high values, as we do not expect the market to fully capitalize these earnings without global oil demand data points on a universally firmer footing. Nonetheless, we raise our 2022 EBITDA forecasts by ~12%, with HFC, PBF, and VLO benefitting most. Our median PT is higher by 14%. WHAT'S CHANGED?

"GERS Receives Contingency Offer To Restart Litigation Against Ethanol Industry...This includes Valero's unlicensed use of GERS' oil extraction technology.CleanTech subsequently received an opinion of counsel that its remaining seven of twelve corn oil extraction patents are clearly valid and enforceable, along with a contingency-based offer to restart the infringement litigation from scratch. We are evaluating our rights and remedies in connection with all applicable matters, and we are unable to characterize or evaluate the probability of any outcome at this time Quote:Further, in connection with ongoing patent filings, the USPTO allowed CleanTech’s new corn oil extraction patents after considering the very information that the District Court found to have been withheld, and upon which the bulk of the District Court’s rulings were based. All of the information alleged to have been “knowingly withheld” from the USPTO in connection with the patents in suit was provided to and considered by the USPTO prior to issuance of several additional patents that are not covered by the District Court’s prior rulings (the “New Patents”). The USPTO subsequently disagreed that deception of any kind occurred when, on February 21, 2020, it issued another patent to us after reviewing the very evidence that was allegedly “withheld,” along with everything the defendants ever submitted and claimed, as well as the District Court’s 2014 and 2016 rulings – all in light of the facts that were never presented to a jury. Significantly, the new patent was allowed by the same examiner that the District Court said was deceived. In other words, the same patent examiner that was allegedly deceived looked at the purported evidence and claims of deception, and disagreed that she had ever been deceived. Thus, in issuing that patent, the examiner concluded that the inventive process was not “ready for patenting” in July 2003, that an invalidating “offer for sale” did not occur in July 2003, and that the “ready for patenting” and “offer for sale” information that the District Court determined to have been “deliberately withheld” from the USPTO was immaterial to patentability."
