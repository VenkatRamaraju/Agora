Steady move up on a market down day. Seeing strong price increases with volume upticks. Things are pointing upwards. Should see upward revisions on target price from analysts soon.

GNTX stock price is currently in a bubble. The only reason it is currently up is because of the company share repurchasing. I will wait for the stock price to dip back below $25 which it will with all the chip and part shortages happening globally. A domino effect is starting to take place across the auto industry. 
"if this is a tech company within the automotive industry, it seems like a good deal"
"Making a nice move today! 10% dividend increase, surprise bonus for all the employees and a visit from Gov. Snyder. A great company now buying back more of its stock too!!"
"Wow, beat expectations even with the tariffs being on and 7 new product launches in the next six months, this company is going up! New price target of $28 by JP Morgan recently looks like it’s spot on!"
This stock just took off the past few weeks.
just buying back shares I think
My thoughts on GNTX remain positive as a value buy at these prices. Keep an eye out though for any estimated earnings revisions coming out in advance of the release later this month.
"nice run up in share price, and yet not expensive compared to the market"
Just came across GNTX. Seems like a quiet steady stock that has a good balance sheet. Seems like a solid stock to pick up and hold onto…
Zack’s just added GNTX to its #1 strong buy list
Any negative news out on GNTX to justify the large volume drop in share price today?Valueline came out last week raising GNTX to #1 in timeliness.GNTX I’d trading at a price well below it’s historical average PE and now seems a screaming value buy

"I think that if they would increase the dividend, you would get the ""income seekers"" interested, and then we could see a nice increase in share price"
Another reason why GNTX share price should be much higher!https://www.barrons.com/articles/spacex-docks-with-space-station-why-investors-should-care-51590937086?siteid=yhoof2&yptr=yahoo
"Gentex hit a new all time high at $24.10. All before the quarterly report comes out, sounds positive to me!!"
