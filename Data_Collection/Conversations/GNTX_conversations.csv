GNTX stock price is currently in a bubble. The only reason it is currently up is because of the company share repurchasing. I will wait for the stock price to dip back below $25 which it will with all the chip and part shortages happening globally. A domino effect is starting to take place across the auto industry.

Steady move up on a market down day. Seeing strong price increases with volume upticks. Things are pointing upwards. Should see upward revisions on target price from analysts soon.
Bought this around 17.50 or so in 2015. Sold today. They have a great product and dominant position but I'm not sure the lack of innovation might not have this one peaked at the moment. Big buybacks of stock is usually a sign that new opportunities are not being identified.
new technology products are encouraging

"The biggest issue with GNTX right now is number of employees , there a great place to work, and they do good for the community but there VERY VERY Heavy on middle management and other areas, they need to clean house and make the people who stay work. There is a lot of wasted money being sucked up by hire more so I don't have to do that anymore. this is a debt to there earnings also."
