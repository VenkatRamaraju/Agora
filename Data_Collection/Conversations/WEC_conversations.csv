What is with WEC stock price?
The Snow Clown reiterates $95 by Thanksgiving.
Div increased 7% 3000 shares ave cost $39.67love it
Ahhh. Very good Q3 and YTD. Guidance also good. Frequently there is an adverse relationship between utilities and DJI. Not today! WEC outperforming an up market.
"""We Energies Foundation donates $100,000 to Milwaukee 'Rebuild and Revitalize' effort""BS! Round up those who caused the damage, & make them pay. If they don't have any money, make them do the construction work for zero wages."
"From 8-K filed last week---On March 10, 2021, Tom Metcalfe, President of Wisconsin Electric Power Company, Wisconsin Public Service Corporation and Wisconsin Gas LLC (collectively, the “Utility Subsidiaries”), notified WEC Energy Group that he and his family have made the difficult decision to relocate to Australia for personal reasons. Mr. Metcalfe will remain as President of the Utility Subsidiaries until the end of 2021. Effective January 1, 2022, Mr. Metcalfe will assume an advisory role for several months to help with the transition of his successor, who will benamed in due course later this year."
"This stock is great. In light of the Covid-19 scare, massive unemployment, volumes 10% lower than budget and everything else, WEC is thriving, not laying anybody off, hiring executives with $100,000 signing bonuses and paying a great dividend. Hopefully the customers use their stimulus check to pay their utility bills so the good times continue to roll."
Does not help when Congressmen and Senators are selling millions and claiming they had nothing to do with it. Yeah right. If the whole thing collapsed what are you going to do with your money. Either you believe in the ability of people to come back or you don't I guess. Take care and best wishes to all.
Volume buys coming in. Turn around time.
"Upon a closer review of the 10-K, this company has four headquarters (if you count the posh offices overlooking Lake Michigan), three power plants that will be idled, a ton of share-based compensation and a high level of non-utility expenses. When is the next utility rate case?? Hopefully the PSCW is gearing up!!"
When will a SPLIT come?
"It just ""tickles me"" to see the short term thinking at these chat boards. Utilities are not a trade-in/trade-out investment. They have always been capital commitment intensive with returns geared toward income versus growth. The best way to ""grow"" a utility investment is to reinvest their (usually) outsized yields. Drips are the most cost efficient way to do so. I would also advise avoiding utilities in the overly high-regulated locals. Can you say PG&E? Great company, but terrible customer base."
"As one analyst indicated today, the Other Interest, net line for the 2017 2nd quarter was not restated for pension and OPEB expenses. It was $13.1 million in last years presentation and $13.1 in this years presentation. Should it have been different?"
"Just read an interesting article in the WI State Journal re the legality of leasing solar power equipment in WI. Apparently the law prevents non-utility companies from providing leased solar equipment, so homeowners are forced to pay for the full system up-front. Even though there's huge demand for solar, most people can't afford the $10K - $20K cost so they do without. WHY AREN'T WE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF OUR MONOPOLY BY OFFERING LEASED SOLAR SYSTEMS TO HOMEOWNERS? This is easy marginal revenue."
I don't understand the drop in price. I would think people would flock to utilities. It is one of the few industries that will stay in operation. Are they just a victim of the mutual fund / ETF selling? The lack of usage due to factory closures? What am I missing? Thoughts?
Down on a 500 point up day.. #$%$
great company
"In light of projected higher utility prices this winter, WEC's systems, coupled with the inherent cost-plus pricing, ensure that utility managers never will be responsible for overruns and bad decisions. Competitive power generation markets also incentivize utilities to pursue reliability and avoid power outages and brownouts. In this period of persistent inflation and supply chain disruptions, consumers don't need record-high utility bills. Yet, that is what some are bound to get this winter - especially if their utilities are stuck with monopoly pricing on wholesale power. Some forecasters predict that natural gas prices this winter will be the highest in 13 years. Utilities that can pivot in competitive markets to other power sources will be able to help their customers. Utilities in monopoly systems will just pass the cost on to consumers. If we care about minimizing greenhouse gas emissions, we must support market-oriented power generation across the board. If we care about minimizing greenhouse gas emissions, we must support market-oriented power generation across the board."
Here comes 90 dollars a share.
Been a inverse relationship between market performance and utilities for over 1-1/2 years now.Earnings beats from individual equities does not outweigh that.First interest then inflation fears.Prevailing
Interest rates are going to zero. Buy
"Other than the banking sector higher interest rates adversely impacts nearly all equities. With WEC and other utilities investors seem to fixate on rates. That’s understandable but do rising rates impact earnings on utilities more than other equities? It sure impacts share price more. Why is this? Last Q good earnings report was offset by interest rate fears and share price continued to drop. The affects of the polar vortex will again boost revenue disproportionately to increased costs and hence earnings will rise,Do u think they will again be more than offset by int rate fears? Yellen and fed reserve board state they don’t intend to ease the prime as they want economy to improve.All opinions appreciated"
Great discussion regarding the Kiefner & Associates study during the first quarter 2020 conference call. Billing associated with the Chicago gas pipe replacement program are very high because the utility is performing activities normally completed by the city. The city does not want to complete this work because of their very high debt levels. WEC needs this very profitable project to fund the executives investment into the world champion Milwaukee Bucks.
"November 10 2020 the price was 106$. Now 87? Dividend up and no significant change in customer base, management, or revenue. This is why when investment experts tell me to put more money in the market I laugh. I guess the stock market has always been a joke, but as I get older I have trouble advising my grandchildren to participate."
Here comes 80 a share. Then what?
so I'm thinking 63.00 is the new buy number.. 72.00 is the sell.. any thoughts.. I was buying at 59.00 but don't see it going down
A quiet board here. Making a portfolio move today ahead of earnings tomorrow. Cutting all growth stocks by 50% and moving proceeds into WEC today. Am worried about what Trump does post election. His antics may throw markets into turmoil. Would bode ill for Wall Street. Need a safer haven. I dislike making this move directly after last week beat down in NASDAQ. Wish me well....
"BUY!..Buy!, buy.....now!...i did!"
They announced today (12/6/18) a dividend increase of 3.75 cents per share or 6.8 percent over the current quarterly rate.
So earnings are good. Dividend is up on quarter. So let's sell. What? As usual market makes no sense.
4 weeks ago I said be 100 by summer

"Don't get me wrong - I love this company, and have been a stockholder for many years, through several mergers and acqusitions - but why is it up over 3% on a day when the DOW's fallen 10%, and XLU/VPU are both down over 6%?"
Hedge fund drive by...They're focusing on sectors that haven't been pummeled yet.
"WEC will not collapse - this selling on the wind farm purchase is ill advised in my opinion. This is forward looking leadership. Yes utes have run hard and have been top performers BUT for good reason...yield, cash flow and growth. Boolean"
"Electric / Natural Gas will be here for generations to come......and the Graft will keep going up / ......and as the dollar shrinks, the price will rise!....any time is a good time to buy....BONUS; Dividends !"
I smell...SPLIT?
What is going on with this stock today
Just reinvest the dividendsIt will be 100 by summer
Had great earnings. Would have thought the price would be higher
