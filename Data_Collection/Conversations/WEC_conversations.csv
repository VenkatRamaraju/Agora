Does not help when Congressmen and Senators are selling millions and claiming they had nothing to do with it. Yeah right. If the whole thing collapsed what are you going to do with your money. Either you believe in the ability of people to come back or you don't I guess. Take care and best wishes to all.

"From 8-K filed last week---On March 10, 2021, Tom Metcalfe, President of Wisconsin Electric Power Company, Wisconsin Public Service Corporation and Wisconsin Gas LLC (collectively, the “Utility Subsidiaries”), notified WEC Energy Group that he and his family have made the difficult decision to relocate to Australia for personal reasons. Mr. Metcalfe will remain as President of the Utility Subsidiaries until the end of 2021. Effective January 1, 2022, Mr. Metcalfe will assume an advisory role for several months to help with the transition of his successor, who will benamed in due course later this year."
A quiet board here. Making a portfolio move today ahead of earnings tomorrow. Cutting all growth stocks by 50% and moving proceeds into WEC today. Am worried about what Trump does post election. His antics may throw markets into turmoil. Would bode ill for Wall Street. Need a safer haven. I dislike making this move directly after last week beat down in NASDAQ. Wish me well....

"Other than the banking sector higher interest rates adversely impacts nearly all equities. With WEC and other utilities investors seem to fixate on rates. That’s understandable but do rising rates impact earnings on utilities more than other equities? It sure impacts share price more. Why is this? Last Q good earnings report was offset by interest rate fears and share price continued to drop. The affects of the polar vortex will again boost revenue disproportionately to increased costs and hence earnings will rise,Do u think they will again be more than offset by int rate fears? Yellen and fed reserve board state they don’t intend to ease the prime as they want economy to improve.All opinions appreciated"
so I'm thinking 63.00 is the new buy number.. 72.00 is the sell.. any thoughts.. I was buying at 59.00 but don't see it going down

"It just ""tickles me"" to see the short term thinking at these chat boards. Utilities are not a trade-in/trade-out investment. They have always been capital commitment intensive with returns geared toward income versus growth. The best way to ""grow"" a utility investment is to reinvest their (usually) outsized yields. Drips are the most cost efficient way to do so. I would also advise avoiding utilities in the overly high-regulated locals. Can you say PG&E? Great company, but terrible customer base."
What is going on with this stock?
"Just read an interesting article in the WI State Journal re the legality of leasing solar power equipment in WI. Apparently the law prevents non-utility companies from providing leased solar equipment, so homeowners are forced to pay for the full system up-front. Even though there's huge demand for solar, most people can't afford the $10K - $20K cost so they do without. WHY AREN'T WE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF OUR MONOPOLY BY OFFERING LEASED SOLAR SYSTEMS TO HOMEOWNERS? This is easy marginal revenue."

Great discussion regarding the Kiefner & Associates study during the first quarter 2020 conference call. Billing associated with the Chicago gas pipe replacement program are very high because the utility is performing activities normally completed by the city. The city does not want to complete this work because of their very high debt levels. WEC needs this very profitable project to fund the executives investment into the world champion Milwaukee Bucks.

"WE Energy's high power rates are sending businesses elsewhere. Read it and weep shareholders. Klapp put your company's future into expensive, dirty coal and not you have to pay the piper. lolMADISON, Wis. — Wisconsin's high electric rates could spark some of its big manufacturers to move or expand elsewhere, state regulators have been warned.Wisconsin's average electric rates are highest among eight Midwest states for the first time since 2006, according to a report approved by the Public Service Commission last month.Comments submitted in response to that report say those rates make it hard for industries to remain competitive, the Wisconsin State Journal reported (http://bit.ly/2bElNIN ). And that's led to calls for fostering price competition, such as allowing users to choose their power providers instead of being restricted to the current utility monopolies.Wisconsin's electric rates average 10.97 cents per kilowatt-hour. Other states range from 8.65 cents in Iowa to 10.87 cents in Michigan. The U.S. average is 11.02 cents, the report says.For industrial customers, Wisconsin's rates are also the highest among the eight Midwest states at 7.81 cents per kilowatt-hour compared with 6.06 cents to 7.25 cents for the other states.The Wisconsin Industrial Energy Group, representing more than 30 of the state's largest companies, and the Wisconsin Paper Council submitted a joint statement to the PSC contending that electricity is not available ""at reasonable prices"" in Wisconsin compared with other states.""It is particularly troubling to note in a state whose economy is built on manufacturing that in 2015, not only did Wisconsin have the highest average industrial rate when compared to surrounding states, the Midwest and U.S. averages respectively, but the growth rate from 2001 to 2015 was the highest as well,"" the groups said.Charter Steel says it won't move out of Wisconsin, but it may do its growing elsewhere.""The noncompetitive cost of electricity in the We Energies' service territory is a key reason we are looking to expand outside of Wisconsin for future growth projects,"" said Bob Venable, president and chief operating officer of Charter Manufacturing, Charter Steel's parent company.Milwaukee-based We Energies spokesman Brian Manthey said the utility has worked closely with its industrial customers to help lower their energy costs was perceived as a funny joke by the media and they enjoyed a long period of mirth."

"As one analyst indicated today, the Other Interest, net line for the 2017 2nd quarter was not restated for pension and OPEB expenses. It was $13.1 million in last years presentation and $13.1 in this years presentation. Should it have been different?"
"November 10 2020 the price was 106$. Now 87? Dividend up and no significant change in customer base, management, or revenue. This is why when investment experts tell me to put more money in the market I laugh. I guess the stock market has always been a joke, but as I get older I have trouble advising my grandchildren to participate."
Interest rates are going to zero. Buy
"This company might be prime for consolidation. Leadership is nearing retirement and wants to spend its time in highly visiable non-core activity, the recently appointed CEO is on-leave and may not be able to return due to items beyond his control, the recent Integrys acquisition has many fires to tend to and may not be working out as hoped and what used to be a company that had some of the best rates in the country is now charging some of the highest. It was a good run but it might be time for further industry consolidation!!"
"Nice little finish up on the Friday of the 15th with a lot of activity in the last 30 minutes. I think people will take stock this weekend, notice the economy is opening back up, and start next week a little more positive. WEC might see a few percentage loss revenue at the next earnings call but not enough to warrant the drop in share price over May. It'll all bounce back, we just need to be patient."
Stock has had a $7.00 run in 5 days.Needs to fall back again to $85.00 to be a buying chance again.
Been a inverse relationship between market performance and utilities for over 1-1/2 years now.Earnings beats from individual equities does not outweigh that.First interest then inflation fears.Prevailing

"This stock is great. In light of the Covid-19 scare, massive unemployment, volumes 10% lower than budget and everything else, WEC is thriving, not laying anybody off, hiring executives with $100,000 signing bonuses and paying a great dividend. Hopefully the customers use their stimulus check to pay their utility bills so the good times continue to roll."
"In light of projected higher utility prices this winter, WEC's systems, coupled with the inherent cost-plus pricing, ensure that utility managers never will be responsible for overruns and bad decisions. Competitive power generation markets also incentivize utilities to pursue reliability and avoid power outages and brownouts. In this period of persistent inflation and supply chain disruptions, consumers don't need record-high utility bills. Yet, that is what some are bound to get this winter - especially if their utilities are stuck with monopoly pricing on wholesale power. Some forecasters predict that natural gas prices this winter will be the highest in 13 years. Utilities that can pivot in competitive markets to other power sources will be able to help their customers. Utilities in monopoly systems will just pass the cost on to consumers. If we care about minimizing greenhouse gas emissions, we must support market-oriented power generation across the board. If we care about minimizing greenhouse gas emissions, we must support market-oriented power generation across the board."

In December 1999 I bought $2500 worth of WEC because my family refused to follow simple suggestions to conserve energy in the house. My theory was if you can't beat them join them. I reinvested all dividends since then. Today that $2500 is now worth over $26000. Hopefully I can 10X my money again in the next 15 years.
I don't understand the drop in price. I would think people would flock to utilities. It is one of the few industries that will stay in operation. Are they just a victim of the mutual fund / ETF selling? The lack of usage due to factory closures? What am I missing? Thoughts?
Why is this company going down when all the fundamentals show a great stock? It went up to 75 but now at 67. What is are the crooked institutions doing?
