bad investment paid $25 a share sold at $9.80 never again
"It's been 4 months or so since AFIN was consistently trading in the $8''s.After dropping to $8.03 last Friday, it's been making a slow recovery this week, but is still trading below $9. I know everyone knows that AFIN has been collecting 100% of their rent recently and are expanding their property portfolio, but this hasn't saved the share price from drifting downwards these last few months. I jumped in last week believing that AFIN's share price hit bottom. Only time will tell if that is the case, but I will admit that I was very attracted by the yield amount that AFIN seems to be able to cover with no issues. I'm not concerned about AFIN specifically, but I do have some concerns of a general market correction in the near future that could take AFIN with it.Good Luck to all AFIN Investors."
"Do not sell your shares to Mackenzie, they are crooks. you can sell them here any pay no costs."
AFIN is down 5.08% to 10.84
"The surge in price in September was based on extremely heavy volume. My guess is that a large institutional buyer was picking up shares and then stopped. There will probably be another scoop up as the REIT index funds rebalance and buy shares before December. However, the class B shares coming on the market will likely push the price back down. I don't think we will see stability in pricing for another six months."
This turned out to be a bit of a racket so far...the offer from McKenzie that once seemed crazy to take now seems the opposite. The ARC folks or someone had to make good money because investors certainly didn't and up until conversion time still had no indication or reason to believe the value would fall over 40% in such a short period. Glad I only invested the small amount I did on this poorly managed offering. Collectively with all of the dividend reinvestments and buying of shares still down over 30%...that defines terrible investment...well done ARC.
"last dividend payment was sep 15th, .07cents per share no other data available"
I’m filling out the MacKenzie forms for the FIRST RINE EVER !!!! And I’ve invested in Untraded REITS that have liquidated for over a decade and never have. THIS IS AWFUL and mind numbingly POORLY PERFORMING STOCK!!!!! $2 BELOW MacKenzie????? UNHEARD OF!!!!!!
Anyone know if the quarterly dividend is temporary and they will switch back to monthly in the future?
"Issuing shares below NAV isn't a problem like some would have you believe. First of all the ""true"" NAV isn't 15 - its closer to 11/ The market isn't stupid - when companies trade below NAV - the market is saying the assets are priced incorrectly on the books- And the true NAV is shown by the stock price- but leaving that aside - even if they did a 10% offering of new shares at 11 and you combine that with the other shares at 15 NAV - the new blend is 14.65 ( not a big dilution- and now sitting on 150 new million in cash) Also don't worry about them issuing stock with a 10% dividend only to invest the money at 8.5%- doesn't seem to make sense, however the new investment at 8.5% isn't solely funded by the stock issuance - that's only 40% of the new investment capitalization - the other 60% comes from borrowing at 4% so the blended ""cost of the new buildings"" is closer to 8%- so very slightly accretive - And be VERY VERY happy that this company just raised 400 million new dollars from institutions- 242 million in debt at 4% followed by the equity raise of 150 million- almost all in fresh new hands."
I would think real estate is easy to value- these guys have 3 billion worth- the stock has lost 500 million in value since November? hard to believe the underlying properties tubed like that-
American Finance Trust is down 7.16% to 7.52
"Realty Income (o) is trading at 67 with a 26 book value = 2.5 times bookAFIN at 10 with 15 book = .70 times bookO has a market cap of 20 billionAFIN cap is 1 billionO can easily buy AFIN as it is 20 times the sizeassuming the 15 book is 30% over stated then the real book is 10.50O can do a stock swap at 2x book or 21 a share and it would be a very accretive for Othis is what the active investors will be demanding and the sharks are circling - 800,000 shares swapped hands last to days. Get em while they are cheap"
"Insiders own .0038, that should tell you all you need to know."
"Well Harry,I hope your corect.I bought in at $25,and my fa keeps telling me we ought to sell,but my gut and wallet say not yet."
"Can this thing hold 11 for once? Probably not, it failed miserably the last two times it broke 11."
who are the sellers ? other than the company? who would want to sell real estate below its fair value and yielding 11%
"Interest rates starting to spike quickly....this could offer opportunity as most real estate and income plays start to pullback. Could see drop back below $14, which would offer better yield going forward."
"Let start some action, all 50,000 early investors who lost our shirts! Please start calling Girard Gibbs LLP who is specialized in non traded REIT lawsuit. 1-866-981-4800. Let's put those management criminals in jail and recover our money! We can make it happen!"
"AFIN declared a dividend of $0.2125 per share of Class A common stock payable on July 15, 2021 to Class A common stock holders of record at the close of business on July 12, 2021."
What about the news that AFIN is joining RMZ reit index? Will this help?
"Rated as overvalued and bearish here now, and insiders at only < 1/2 %. of stock. No thanks."
"Huge increases in expenses paid to AR Global management eating up much of the profitability and becoming a gas station reit in the future. No share repurchases. A do nothing board of directors. But there is still value in the spread between the net asset value (14-16) and the share price (10). So in spite of management taking shareholders to the cleaners every quarter, there still is value to be unlocked."
Can ANYONE OUT OR ON HERE PLS EXPLAIN WHY YOU ARE SELLING traded shares on NASDAQ while MacKenzie has a $15 mini tender offer on the table for a month now that’s good for another week or so???? THIS IS NOT MAKING SENSE TO ME AT THESE LEVELS....only on levels >$15 which ought to be a FLOOR NOT A CEILING WE ARE NOW 20% UNDER
How low can it go?
American Finance Trust is up 4.93% to 8.52
"I bought AFIN and GNL, both part of ARC Invetments, through a broker and was told that when they go public they usually increase in value. Apparently some prior REITs they sold did just that when they went public. I paid the equivalent of $30 per share for GNL (accounting for 1:3 reverse split) and around $25 for AFIN. GNL is now mid $19s and we know where AFIN is. I've lost a ton of money on both of them. Sure I've been getting dividends but that doesn't offset the 30-50% decrease in market value. I actually bought more AFIN in the open market after the IPO in the $13-15 range and I thought it would recover. Again, I'm getting a nice dividend so it's not a total loss, but we were told the asset value was $23-25 per share. I think they lied, or the market isn't believing it. How hard is it to verify asset value anyhow?"
AFIN has a 10.5% dividend at $8.13. Where else can you make that type of return in investments & AFIN has now everyone paying their rent. AFIN is a Still at the price today. I was always taught if you're gonna to steal make sure you don't steal slowly. Thanks for giving me the chance to pick up more at these super low price on a good company. Experts are calling for $11 to $13 a share within 1 year. On those projections it'll have a return of over 50% in one year. Thanks.
"Stop & Shop, Aldi's, Trader Joe's, Sanofi, Fresenius, DaVita, CVS and Walgreens are substantial tenants of AFIN....these are solid businesses still open and doing banner business so has to be good bet long term. Anything under $5.00 to $6.00 here is a steal, with delicious dividend yield."
Does anyone know any reason to hold onto this stock any longer or is everyone selling it?
"Read the 10Q. Book value is around $15. No share buybacks taken place as of today, 150 million available to do so if the board pleases. Two new lawsuits filed against AR Global for misleading shareholders. AR Global now billing for salaries of certain employees separately in addition to the fees they charge."
For all of you want to mini tender your Awful shares to MacKenzie — their number is 1-800-854-8357Good luck. It expires a week from tomorrow
"I thought Q3 was a great quarter, the call was very positive too. Adjusted Funds from Operations (""AFFO"") increased 20.3% to $25.5 million or $0.23 per share compared to $21.2 million or $0.20 per share in the prior quarter and increased 8.9% compared to $23.4 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, in the prior year third quarterThe stock was $15 one year ago now its $6What am I missing."
"It's been a loooong 5 years. At this point, I'm hoping to get back what I put into it, but my confidence in this stock is declining rapidly. I won't ever invest in a REIT again!!"
"Great fund here, but RSI above 70 shows over bought & looking for pullback to enter. RSI back near 60 would be good entry"
is AFIN price falling now on expectation of second tier of shares coming to market soon and will be sold by some brokers right away to try for another commission or is there some other bad news I missed?
Just wondering if AR still values the NAV of the shares not distributed at $23.56.
"Oh great Form 4 filings, maybe insider buying. Nope free 8647 shares for each of the four so called independent directors. SMH."
How to become a millionaire................ invest TWO million in AFIN
clnc was down big today also on earnings announcment. It went public in similar manner to AFIN (except CLNC went liquid all at one time) and had recovered much of its initial market fall but got hit hard today as well. Might have been some general institutional shorting or something that hurt them both. CLNC had a write down as I recall from reading the summary report press release
"Look at GOODM or a well managed fund DFP that I own for superior management compared to this turd which I own along with GNL (bought at $19-20), ARI (bought at $16 and earned 5 years high dividends despite it current low price)."
They just announced today dividends for everything except common shares.

too much debt! thats reason for hi div!!!!!
AFIN reached an all time low at 8.87
why Afin not buy there stock back if its NAV is 15-16??
AFIN reached an all time low at 5.75
Nobody even bothers to post on here anymore. GETS WORSE AND WORSE AND WORSE NO END IN SIGHT. PLACEMENT ON INDEX NOT A LICK OF ANY DIFFERENCE FOR MONTHS NOW!!!!!
I can see MacKenzie offer as a FLOOR....but as a CEILING??? No freakin way!!! CAN ANYONE DO MATH ANYMORE??????
"A but hopeful share price broke thru the seemingly $15 ceiling prob created by latest MacKenzie offer ? (I’d have thought that ought be a floor!) then $16 this week.....for some reason my Yahoo roster shows $0.00 ???? Wth? Some tech error am sure hoping as that would be the last straw!Any updates on class action ? (Which usually I despise as a boon for law firm!) but here?? Seems kind of issue here as folks wanting immediate liquidation shouldn’t have driven price down 45% when total shares traded average 200,000 to 300,000 (500,000-700,000 the first few days as folks having to liquidate did)aa but for 50,000,000 shares debuting on NASDAQ THATS a tiny 1% per day! Something fishy??"
How is that McKenzie bought this steaming pile of excrement for $15 a share? They must know something...or not...
What happened? biggest drop ever in a day.
"Response for investor relations department: In August, AFIN announced that we would be amending our dividend policy to pay dividends quarterly, in arrears, instead of monthly. Accordingly, the next declared and paid dividend will be for the 4th quarter and paid in January. The record date for that dividend has not yet been announced. The annualized rate remains $0.85/share."
"WTH is going on with AFIN? It has dropped from $10.80 in the last 2 trading days to $9.55. Why is anyone selling this great dividend stock plus America is opening up again with the vaccine. Heavy selling was on Friday last week at the close. Some huge investors or funds are selling, Why?"
Shame. Shareholders had one chance to vote their anger and to vote down the incompetent board member up for election but instead affirmed him 5:1 which instead sends a message that we are happy losing $1 every month in value. Now the board and management will feel empowered to continue their fiddling and show us an 8 handle on the share price soon.
"Spoke with class action lawyer about this fiasco. Said he wouldn't take up case because AFIN's disclosures allow them to basically run a criminal enterprise (my words paraphrasing). NEVER invest in NON-TRADED REITS because they deceive unsuspecting, unsophisticated investors with complex legalese full of disclosures that give them a get out of jail card. He said the only course of action I could take with any chance of getting $ for my losses is to go after my broker through FINRA arbitration."
Why NOT accept MacKenzie now??? $15!!! Why is ANYBODY SELLING AT ONE PENNY SUB-$15???? ****THIS MAKES ZERO SENSE AT ALL ******
Did I read right this morning the dividend almost doubled to $1.875 a year?
Interest rates are so low that this dividend becomes extremely attractive. Will they have to cut it though?
change of control in the works?
Someone must know something. why did the company tell me not to sell to Mackenzie at 15?
"I am buying more, I cannot find any reason it dipped so much - any idea? It dropped 2x what other similar REIT dipped"
"This is like watching a train wreck. Although I got out a few weeks ago, I find myself keep coming back to see how much further this thing can drop."
The large surge in price over September was likely an institutional buyer that temporarily elevated share price. I say this based on the large volume over multiple days. Hopefully as REIT indexes rebalance some more institutional buying will take place. I think it will be a bumpy ride for at least the next six months.
buyers and sellers finally matched- 11.50 is my very near term target- will hang around there for a few quarters
Just received my proxy statement. Any reason to vote for any of the nominees or proposals?
"We invite investors, broker dealer contacts and financial advisors to join us for a webcast with AFIN’s executive leadership to review company information and the upcoming conversion of its Class B-1 shares into Class A tradable shares (Nasdaq:AFIN) on October 10, 2018."
"People who are interested in class action suit against AFIN, please google ""non traded reit attorney"". I already sent my document to Girard Gibbs LLP. I am going to contact every law firm, at least who is on the first page. I need my money back from those cheaters!"
"Announced issuance of $200M in new shares to purchase new properties at 8%+ cap rates, to increase AFFO. Hate to be holding a short position right now. Possibly could flush them over the next few days. Carry cost to short AFIN is high plus the dividend."
read an article yesterday where this was listed as one of 4 underpriced reits - and should be trading low teens
"Q2 Adjusted Funds from Operations (""AFFO"") grew 35.4% to $28.7 million or $0.26 per share from $21.2 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, in the prior year second quarter. Looks good to me"
AFIN could easily see a share price of $13 to $15 within a year. As America gets back to work & covid is finally controlled AFIN will rocket a great deal higher. People want to get of their homes and live Free again. AFIN is a bargain and it pays over 10.5% dividend. Buy any dip and hold.
About a 4.3% cut in dividends over the year. I can understand the thought process. Dividend is now about 13.7% at $6.20/share—I can live with that
Nice move today and up bulgy after hours. Any idea why? Maybe the rent report yesterday?
American Finance Trust is up 7.38% to 8.44
YET ANOTHER DECIMATION AND ANOTHER BY DAR ALL TIME LOW
Less than 1/2 % insider ownership on what appears anyway to be a stable investment. Revealing.
"Today's earnings report indicates AFIN continues to add debt and properties to its' porfolio yet can't or won't make the dividend payments as promised. Also, they keep expanding as they continue to LOSE money. As a former 32 year commercial R.E. appraiser, this is a terrible investment in poor or crooked management. Sure, buying here at $15/share is like GNL when it traded at 50% of its' IPO price ($15/$30) last year."
Will this stock ever go up? I bought at 25!
"there has been and end of day buyer for the last week- today 100,000 shares in the last few minutes on upticks- same thing the few other days last week that did over 800,000. those days the buys were closer to 200,000 shares in last 20 minutes again on upticks. so there are deep pockets accumulating here - but disguised on down days. They let it drift in the AM then come after it"
Quarter earnings are out and the stock just drifts to new lows. Now down almost 60% from what we paid five years ago for it. I could not see anything bad in the report yet people keep selling it. I thought the dividend might be cut again since it is now over 10%. No announcement to that effect so why is there no interest in buying at this level? I would take Mackenzie's $15 offer now gladly from three months ago. My advisor and the company told me not to because the stock was worth at least 18 if not 23. It would seem most original investors that wanted to sell should have by now so can anyone tell me why it will go back to even 12 when no one is buying it seems at 10.5? What do others seem to know that I dont? I never thought it would go below 15 just a quarter ago! Down hundreds of thousands and dont know what to do? Anyone know anything? Thanks!
"Sorry, no issuance. My assistant looked at an old prospectus. Up on good earnings report yesterday? Still hate to be short at this price, with the cost and cost of a big dividend."
"AFIN is selling stock:In May 2019, the Company established an “at the market” equity offering program for Class A common stock (the “Class A Common Stock ATM Program”), pursuant to which the Company may from time to time, offer, issue and sell to the public up to $200.0 million in shares of Class A common stock, through sales agents. The Company sold 432,247 shares sold under the Class A Common Stock ATM Program for gross proceeds of $6.1 million, before commissions paid and additional issuance costs of approximately $0.1 million, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019.They sold stock at $14.11 ave price"
AFIN reached a new 52 Week High at 17.05
Investor Relations told me January
"The company won't provide addresses of its properties. I looked up the 4 featured properties on their website and they'll all in tier 5 markets. In other words, in the middle of nowhere. That's how they're getting 7.5 to 8 cap rates. They're buying properties that no one else will bid on. That's okay until your tenant leaves or you need to sell the property. Better do your homework before buying this company. You'll be much better off buying NTST, O, NNN, STOR, or WPC."
bought 7000 shares today at 10.19 to replace the 7000 I sold at 11.70 last month.

"According to the price at today's close, unless I'm missing something, those that got in as a non-traded REIT are now out 45% on their initial investment. Please let me know if I'm missing something there. My next question to those that are familiar with non-traded REITs: I had one other experience with a non-traded REIT that liquidated. In that one, I was offered a buyout price on my initial investment of roughly 12% over my or to keep the shares as a publicly traded stock. Fortunately I chose the buyout price, it is now trading at less than 10% of that. My question is why wasn't the buyout price an option with this REIT? No choice but to get out at the publicly traded price with this REIT. Any insights appreciated."

is it stabile company? no bankruptcy?
is anyone still in this stock that paid 25 like me?
glad I got out of this post at around 15.
bought another 5000 shares today at 10.25 - tons wrong with this outfit but the risk/reward is way to compelling to overlook
Buying here—current divi rate for the next 3 months at this price is 17%?! Crazy. No brainer for me. GLTA
Ave in low 5’s—going to keep this one for years with their above average divi!
"You have to consider dividend payments which were actually return of capital to adjust your cost basis. A lot of non-traded reits do not prove to be not good investment opportunities but are promoted on the dividend payment as income but as stated above, some of these payments are not dividends because the income cannot support the dividend and is a bet on future real estate values and rental increases, therefore, cash is provided for these payments by selling more units in the reit, I bought into this when it was non-traded and like everyone else would have a loss if I sold. I choose to keep mine for now. Just one of those investments that turn short term holders into long term holders."

4.25% drop on the first day of the year? Why?
Now below the price of the insider buying. This stock and management continues to be a disgrace.
Are we headed for a double bottom at $4.20? Didn't think it would head down again after looking at the tenant list.
See today's new about FINRA arbitration regarding AFIN. Let's all get involved to get SEC/FINRA's attention on the management team. They are the criminals who stole our money!
Claimed NAV value highly suspect so no institutional buyers. AFIN management refused to answer any questions about how their so called peers traded relative to NAV&
Pretty sad when you can feel good at getting out at $11.03.
American Finance Trust is up 6.44% to 6.28
"If McKenzie (a vulture discount purchase fund) is offering $15 per share for traded shares of AFIN, they must be hoping for $20 price in the not too distant future or they would not go through the trouble Not sure why they are making an offering for those shares when they can buy in the open market for less. Has anyone figured that out"
"I've been holding onto this stock for about 4 years now and like many have bought in at the $25 level. It's sickening to watch how far this has fallen, but I'm sticking with it. Most REITs do pretty well over time and I believe this will come back eventually and grow higher than the original purchase price. I'm just glad I invested with money I didn't need to get by with at the time. In fact, as of yesterday I bought more at 9.50. I believe book value is somewhere around the $15 range so even if everything went to pot, that is basically what we can expect to revert back to."
"New low after new low now nearing low end of trading range from JULY ($14.40-14.90) which we’ve never seen since 9/8/18 most recent MacKenzie offer expired 9/8/18 Oh....the pain ....such a disappointing company truly it has been the entire 5 years I’ve never stopped complaining to the guy who recommended it to me Sept 2013 even unTRADED they were awful to deal with....I’d hope the institutionals would have seen some real valuation by now and were with higher volume near 1,000,000 as it rose $15 to $18+ now paltry volume pushes price way way down......I don’t get why ANY former unTRADED shares owner would NOW he selling ?? If desperate for capital those were 2+ months ago so who the hell is selling NOW ?? If bought more between July and last week the. It’s a recent (re-) killing yet again....???"
They are doing roadshows now. Will help awareness and the story. Hopefully will help the price as a result.
Worse and worse and worse and worse and worse and...&.....
its a no brainer - NOTHING in the REIT world that I have seen trades anywhere near book / most 2.5-4X / just sit back and cash your monthly checks- until this is sold to another monster REIT like O for 16-17
"Can anyone here help me on the ex-dividend date? I know if you buy on the ex-dividend date you supposedly don't get the dividend and the stock drops accordingly. The AFIN ex-dividend date was 1/8/21. However, AFIN in a recent release said ""AFIN declared a dividend of $0.2125 per share of Class A common stock payable on January 15, 2021 to common stock holders of record at the close of business on January 11, 2021."" This seems to conflict with the definition of the ex-dividend date ""f you purchase a stock on its ex-dividend date or after, you will not receive the next dividend payment. Instead, the seller gets the dividend. If you purchase before the ex-dividend date, you get the dividend. .."""
I’m taking MacKenzie offer for the first time EVER out of decade plus years of dozens of mini tender offers of theirs...pretty sad when a stock falls beneath them on the scale of honor....Of course “1st Law is Jeff” now in force = means stock will now SKYROCKET YOU JUST WATCH!!!!!! Prob by tmro or so. You’re welcome everybody 
"They recently issued preferred stock and filed a 10k. This means underwriters and auditors have looked at their financials. If they had anything material to disclosed they would have been required to disclose it in the prospectus. They recently declared dividends for April, May and June...so no cut announced until after Q1 earnings. Yet the trading in the stock is like this is some kind of microcap scam or pot stock. I don't quite get it. It is up to the board to take action but unfortunately they are all rubber stamps for AR Global. It is an unfortunate situation here."
Tanking again on 1st possible custodial shares (B-1 this tranche) trading day...exactly like July 20th was ....just AWFUL!!!!!!!!
The stock became public to add liquidity for the long term holders. Many wanted to sell and have been doing so. That's the slow drip drip down you have been witnessing.There is basically no coverage or firms touting the shares. How one even finds out about them is a mystery to me. Just need one or two new analyst coving the company - even with a neutral rating to get some positive action. There was something slipped into the 4th q conference call that you do need to be wary of though. They were asked if they would include capex into their AFFO numbers going forward as many NNN 's do - they are considering it- that would drop it down to .85 from 1.02 / could be part of the selling
"Glad to see the CEO was pleased about how the first day of trading went:AFIN News Release (obtained from the AFIN website):American Finance Trust Successfully Completes First Day of Trading on NasdaqJuly 19, 2018NEW YORK, July 19, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- American Finance Trust, Inc. (""AFIN"") successfully completed its first day of trading of its shares of Class A Common Stock today on The Nasdaq Global Select Market (""Nasdaq""). Trading of AFIN's common stock commenced this morning under the ticker symbol ""AFIN."" After opening at $13.15 and reaching a session high of $16.80, the stock closed the day at $15.00, with approximately 600,000 shares traded during the day.Michael Weil, AFIN's Chief Executive Officer commented, ""We are pleased with the results of today's listing and appreciate the confidence and support provided by our more than 50,000 long-term shareholders and their financial advisors. This event marks an important milestone for us as we believe it provides a strong platform for future growth, offers daily liquidity to investors who invested in our public non-listed shares and an opportunity for new investors to own shares of a well-diversified REIT."" Mr. Weil continued, ""I want to thank BMO Capital Markets, AFIN's financial advisor with respect to the listing, for the skillful advice and guidance offered in bringing our shares to the market. This event also demonstrates the commitment we share with our independent directors to creating a liquidity event designed to deliver optimal results for shareholders."" As of March 31, 2018 AFIN's high quality diversified portfolio consisted of 558 single-tenant net lease and multi-tenant retail and lifestyle center properties with an average weighted remaining lease term of 8.3 years. Its 19.1 million square foot portfolio was 94.3% occupied at that time.The Class A shares listed today represent approximately 50% of AFIN's outstanding shares of common stock. The Company's Class B-1 and Class B-2 shares, representing approximately 25% each of AFIN's outstanding common stock, will automatically convert to Class A shares and become listed on Nasdaq no later than 90 days and 180 days, respectively, from today. As a result, all of the shares of common stock will be fully listed before January 15, 2019..."
Why the big jump today and large volume?
"Getting close to 1 year since going public and price discovery has been impossible for this stock. NAV at time it went public was over $20, reached $17.50 as a public company, offered $15 by Mackenzie Capital, traded as low as $9.36, 100k shares purchased by Director Lisa Kabnick for around $10.50, company announces a big 200 million dollar shelf offering when stock breaks $11. Book value is around $15. Only sure thing is that REITs in general have performed phenomenally except this one."

Why is this going up so rapidly. No real news.
If you all get a chance visit the afin website and listen to the Nareit webcast given by the CEO Mike Weil. I can't summarize what he said because Yahoo deletes it. But you will get good insight to the current situation at Afin.

"Remember, management proclaimed that these shares were worth $23.56 BEFORE THE REVERSE SPLIT, so they should be worth $47.02 now. Just based on the past history of the crooked financial reporting plus some of mgt going to jail, you have to wonder how much smoke these morons are blowing. Also, there was a tender offer in April 2018 from KacKenzie Capital Mgt for $15.35/share but management stated the offer price was under the current estimated per share NAV and the board recommended that stockholder do not take the offer................... This is a REIT started by Nicolas Schorch so the stink is still around."
I see no record of AFIN paying a dividend for Oct. and I find no statement about about forward dividend payments. Can anyone shed some light on this? Did I miss something?
"Why my shares went from $25 to $13. They said that after the appraisal to go public, that would be the fair price. Is AFIN not telling the thrush. Is it right? I was mislead when bought it. I am ready to suit."
"If the management thinks the NAV is $23.50, why would they list for $13 to start?To them, they knew the shares worth only $13. They have been fooling all the shareholders for too long!"
AFIN reached an all time low at 9.26
"Thank you B74. If I had not been suckered into buying AFs 5 REITs 4 years ago with money from expired Muni Bonds, I wouldn't have lost 50% of my equity (luckily or unluckily about $350K or 3% of my equity)."
"Capital raising overload. The street doesn't like the fact that in a short period of time they did a preferred offering, shelf offering and now a secured note offering. There seems to be a lot of competition for NNN properties and trying to buy buildings like crazy now feels like the wrong move."
We should hopefully hear about the next dividend for the common shares in the morning. The previous dividend was $0.2125
"Just received my monthly dividend of $177.47. At this rate,if price and dividend remain constant, in just 11 more short years I'll be back to even on my original investment as a non-traded REIT. Everything after that will be like icing on cake."
choo choo- trains leaving the station....
Why is this down from over $15 not long ago to $13.25 today?
SeekingAlfa has an interesting article today on AFIN.
getting traction
Any reason for the stock to go higher in the next few months? It is up 45% from the low this year already. If they are paying 150% out of their earnings how long before that becomes an issue?
Question - if afin is not making a profit why is the price going up ??
they keep getting semi neg press about the size of the ceo comp for this size market cap company. might have something to do with stagnant pps. im holding long
Why is this going up finally?
"NEARING ALL TIME LOW OF FIRST TRADKNG DAY...DEJA VU, ALL OVER AGAIN"
I guess BMO all alone with coverage..... 12 dollar target- i'll take 11 plus the divi
"oh,thanks John"
who is selling at these levels? But as you know for every seller there is a buyer. So stock going somewhere. I bought at 9.79 yesterday 9.63 today.....It looks like a divi cut is on the way-
"Not a lot of confidence here. I was in from the beginning and hate to sell at a loss. But after listening to management call, I came away with the impression of complacent, mediocre management. Staying in for now, hoping for a buy-out by a firm with better management."
Way to go Lisa. Director bought 100000 shares this week. That explains the pop this week.
The issuing if new shares of stock is a negative right? That dilutes the value of the existing share value? Is that why we are hitting new lows? Anyone know anything?
"Some nice price movement upwards recently. The release for the B1 shares should come within the next 30 days, will that dilute the price once it hits the market, or will this upward trend be unsustainable as more people sell as the price reaches their pre-listing price of $25."
What a gift AFINP has become. Buyers now are eligible to receive the $.48 dividend on 10/15. The premium is basically gone on this issue just because a few more preferred shares were offered yesterday. Just added to my position...will be back to $26 in a few days...
Can't understand why people would sell 23 days before the next dividend.
"The shares can be issued at any time. If they are, the $200M will be used to purchase 8%+ cap rates, raising their AFFO. Good report yesterday."
AFIN reached an all time low at 8.00
American Finance Trust declares $0.2125 dividendForward yield 11.44%Payable Jan. 15; for shareholders of record Jan. 11; ex-div Jan. 8.This great news
"AFIN holdings: names as Stop & Shop, Aldi's, Trader Joe's, Sanofi, Fresenius, DaVita, CVS and Walgreens are substantial tenants of the Company"
Just checking with the group about forming a class action law suit against these Crooks - who is interested and willing?
Nope no traction. Continues to underperform its peers and gets hammered because of its ongoing shelf offering. Hopefully dividend is not cut for next 3 mos to make things even worse.
Is time to buy yet?
"Hard to believe a REIT with solid properties and tenants, with an NAV above $16, continues to drop. I bot more today at $9.75 and hope my falling knife does not cut me."
"I finally got my shares tendered. When the management told you not to do, you know doing the opposite is always right. The devil management team robbed every investor's hard earned money, with no mercy. Is there anyone participating in the class action? Please share your thoughts."
"AFIN holds solid names like Walgreens and CVS, which are doing strong business while most other stores are closed. Seems safer bet"
Was anyone else buying between $13.50 and $15? I was. This will be pushing $20 in no time.
Didn't they also do a 2 for 1 reverse split?
Mike Weill and crew are absolutely criminals. From an NAV of 23.50 to 15...great job.
what happened today? 3 times daily volume
"Quite frankly harry, we really dont care what a Gecko-type genius you are playing in afin stock. Even most of the BofD wont touch this p0s."
"THAT IS EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE CAPITAL: 3,200,000 shares of its 7.375% Series C Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock. How can any kind of return be made when you spend 7.375% for capital (plus all the legal fees) to buy single-tenant assets in the 6.5 to 7.25 CAP rate? You can't buy any quality assets in the 7.5% plus range. I know that for a fact because I've been in the commercial real estate business for 35 plus years!!!They should be buying back their preferred shares not issuing more!!!!!!This should be a major red flag!!!!"
"Upgrade B. Riley FBR: Neutral to Buy 3/26/202010:01 am ET March 26, 2020 (Benzinga) B. Riley FBR changed the rating for American Finance Trust Inc (NASDAQ: AFIN) from Neutral to Buy.

American Finance Trust's stock last closed at $6.97 per share."
AFIN is down 4.98% to 11.25
harry seems to be a company plant or using too much pot.
Can anyone please add explanation or opinions on recent events. I am a shareholder that paid $25 a share 5 years ago. 1. Why did the stock go up 5% today?2. Why did they issue preferred stock today and is that bad or good?3. The article released Sept 3 stating the dividend payout is 155% of the cash flow seems very serious and I assume cannot continue. The dividend will have to be cut right?4. Is there any reason this stock can go higher this year? Any reason to continue to hold this stock?Thank!
pretty sure single digit days are numbered- no real bid bashers left- almost no short interest- where is the stock coming from?
Has anyone else noticed that there are NO insiders owning this stock?? Shows a lot of confidence in its outcome.......
what's going on? I love this spike
AFIN is up 5.19% to $14.19
AFIN is up 5.08% to $13.87
I lost big time on this one. I now have Kyros Law out of Florida looking into my brokers actions. They feel I have a case that can be arbitrated. They charge 1/3 of any recovery. Yes they may be ambulance chasers but it is worth a shot.Check out their web site. I will take any help I can get.
American Finance Trust is up 7.77% to 8.18
Let's have a class action against AFIN. There are too many things went wrong here. Management just grabbed all share holder's money.
Will it be a class lawsuit?
American Finance Trust is up 14.04% to 7.23
American Finance Trust is down 4.99% to 10.48
It looks like they had negative surprises the last 4 quarters on earnings. I wonder if they are going to have to lower this dividend soon?
New to this one---anyone got any thoughts as to where the bottom is???
I took a stab and started a new position today at 9.79 / what am I missing? RIDA had a nice write up in seeking alpha- said not covering dividend but optimistic by year end 2019 they will be- with a few acquisitions and leasing some dark space- probably one of the safer bets going these days
"My old broker, the one show sold me this POS, said just wait until its included in a index and the price will go up. It has been included and the price keeps going down. Did I mention that he was my old broker??????"
"I was told over the phone that the share price fell due to the market, not due to any set price. People who received their shares placed market orders to sell. At the other end, buyers were ready to buy the shares at whatever low price they could get the shares for. The first transactions set the initial price. The price will not go up until buyers outnumber sellers, which won't be this week, I'm sure. In the meantime, the dividend is 9.2 cents per share each month, for a 7.3% yield at $15.00. I figure it would take 5 years to recoup our money absent any rise in share price."
what happened today to afin. is it anticipation of next layer of shares coming liquid
"nope cash cow for insiders is all,,, good for them"
American Finance Trust is down 5.01% to 9.86
How you guys like the dilution?
The company today filed for 200 million common and 50 million preferred offering. However it is a shelf offering so it may not even happen or happen over a long period of time. In any case that explains why there is no buybacks.
Don’t forget the dividend cut prior to listing.
"Someone sold a huge amount of this stock at the open. Volume is at 385,000 already in the first 5 minutes of trade today. Anyone have any news on AFIN today?"
Obviously a market leader with the complete respect of the investing community................. said facetiously.
May again a good time to start nibbling here around 6...
Buy this dip. AFIN collected 100% of their rents last month. Afin is paying over 10% dividend. Thanks for the dip. This will rock over $11 within 6 months.
$3.5 B NAV and $1.5 B market value? seriously.
This is the shorts getting squeezed. Conservative book value is $16+. Deloitte audited the portfolio in April 2018 and assigned a $23 value. We have been accumulating more shares since $9.50 (have others at $13) and will not sell any below $16 and might collect the dividends far beyond that.
Another great article on AFIN today at seeking alpha- from RIDA- it's about the preferred - but relates to common as well obviously - basically said AFIN firing on all cylinders - the new 242 million in debt was AAA rated - speaks to the quality of borrower (AFIN) / their debts are property specific - so if one goes under lenders cant go after preforming buildings/ they have 3.3 billion in properties with 1.6 billion in debt so not over levered....and more....
"10 year rate keeps rising after rate cut, which could mean moving back above 2%.....not death nail for AFIN, but could see pullback to $12 to $12.50 level"
So when do they typically announce the dividend. I don't see any more listed.
"This is the shorts getting squeezed. Conservative book value is $16+ and institutions are buying now. Deloitte appraised the portfolio in April 2018, at $23."
"You would expect that if NAV is really $23.56, and now trading at $14 and change, the insiders would be scooping up the shares. Will be interesting to see if they did any purchasing at this low price, or sold before the price drop."
American Finance Trust is down 6.78% to 6.19
All the class action talk has settled down now that we're on a tear... interesting
American Finance Trust is up 13.50% to 8.49
What happened at close today with a big seller coming in late. Could it be the group that made the tender offer?
American Finance Trust is up 4.93% to 6.17
