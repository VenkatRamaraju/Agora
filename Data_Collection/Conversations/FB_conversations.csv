FB algorithms have destroyed more friendships than they have created. Zuckerberg is Goebbels reincarnated. Evil propaganda will lead to a second civil war for America.
Think it bottoms at $290ish before teh dust settles then starts to climb again.
Buy the dip. Markets making new hights. Target $ 400.
Buy ACBL
"Everything the whistleblower had to say, has been addressed... So That's old news now, back to running"
Added another 30 share around $318 per share.
"Wisconsin investigating FB involvement in elections!!!! Wisconsin Special Counsel Fires Off Multiple Election Subpoenas. It’s important to note that Wisconsin is approaching the election problems differently than other states. Gableman is conducting a criminal investigation. Depending on his findings – and possible indictments – that could in turn lead to a full, statewide forensic election audit. In the meantime, it looks like Gableman’s investigation will finally start to shed some light on why Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg’s employees ran Wisconsin’s 2020 election, rather than state election officials."
I heard about FB the other day on (http://Rightpicker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
A-social media seems to a better description of it … charge everyone 10 ct for every posting and invest it in something worthwhile ..
"Gonna drop below $300 before year's end. Simply no enthusiasm for the stock or its leadership. Fact is, just the opposite is true. But FB has danced this dance before, bad publicity i.e., and come out on top in the end. I believe history will repeat itself there. However, in the meantime, there's gonna be several good buying opportunities presented to us with prices 10% to 20% lower than today's pps."
"Thinking People understand Facebook employssignificant numbers of hard working people, leases millionsof square feet of commercial real estate and pays billionsin taxes to our treasury. With sleepy Joey, spending OPM,and lacking clarity and alacrity in Cannabis Legalization,let us not bite hand that feeds us."
"FB is the greatest advertising and most powerful platform of modern times.It shows in their quarterly numbers when FB earnings are up, the stock would bounce back to 400..."
A management team focused on mitigating personal risk is not one focused on shareholder interests. Shareholders desperately need a C-Suite dedicated to enhancing shareholder value and interests. My hope is for the SEC to force a change in management.
"Sunday on 60 Minutes: The Facebook whistleblowerA former employee, who recently filed anonymous federal complaints against Facebook, reveals her identity on 60 Minutes, Sunday."
"Will accept losses on third short position, and go long on plug"
I wouldn't complain about being given the opportunity to buy cheaper.
This stock is oversold on the RSI so we'll see this back in the 320s soon. Good opportunity for swing traders to buy in.
$340s next week.
I’ll be a buyer at $60 or less. Massive class action.

60 minutes just ripped Facebook big time. Distinctly worse than other forms of social media.
As of now I sold all my tech stocks and 100% in fb ...
Facebook is not a buy at this point even though it’s risk is very low. There’s little to no more growth available unless somehow they decide to split the stock thus driving it upwards. Good luck to all and may the best of luck be with Facebook. We all know the negative health impacts it has on our youth and how addictive it is. Also just how it destroys creativity plus how it isolates this generation from making real life connections in person because they are always stuck on the phone looking at Kim kardashian or some pop star/artist that could care less about them.
I still think a dividend would do more to help this stock than anything else.
Does this 2 year employee really have the credibility and knowledge about the inner details of Facebook to be a whistleblower or is she just looking for her 5 minutes of fame on camera?
"This move down is sold out now... The one analyst opinion, and he already sold before he came out with his opinion. The was the wash out of the weak holders"
"What really matters is the SEC investigation, especially for bag holders and Facebook's management"
FB is untouchable when that be something if Wisconsin with their voter fraud investigation be the ones to take down FB!!!
Today’s full outage is what happens when you transition most of your IT staff to unqualified H1-B visa applicants and offshore staff from Bangalore.
Saw a legal add on tv that said if you have been a Democrat for more than 20 years and now have significant brain damage then you might be entitled to financial compensation.
The whistleblower bs is factored in well before we hear about it. The recovery today was institutional investors grabbing shares at a discount. Wouldn’t surprise me if we see $330 tomorrow
Back to 380 in blink of an eye. Watch
Its all non sense political postering. The democrats have an extremely weak majority and arent going to do anything right before an election where they are likely to lose big. They are focused on other things like the debt ceiling. Adding more. See you at $400.
"When the shorty Michael Burry bought FB and short TSLA, you knew it was time to sell FB and buy TSLA!"
"I've read about her in different online channels, if she wasn't perfect at this, no one would speak good of her i trust her. Dm her on Facebook for more enquiries Julia Grayson she's genuine"
"After the whistleblower scandal the reaction will subside Fb will do nothing as usual, Congress will do a whole lotta nothing as usual and Fb will continue to make money hands over fist. Then another scandal will happen rinse and repeat. What’s the problem??"
"Earning season, definitely will be higher next week. Buy the dip now if u can."
"Tough regulation is needed and politicians that have been bought/rented should be exposed. No one denies that Facebook's product can have useful and productive uses. But, what it has become is quite another thing. At best, it's a mouthpiece for all opinions, whether thought out or crazy. It flatters this cacophony to call it ""social media"". It's the world's largest bulletin board, for everything.The FB algorithms then go to work, in the name of engagement, delivering to each ""user"" content from this vast bulletin board in order to maximize connection. Yes, there is a business motive to do this, which taken by itself is completely legitimate. But, that's not the full story. All the technical language and defenses that FB is working hard every day and such may sound seductively benign and sincere, but it's clear enough that it's insidiously dangerous. The company is now following a familiar script: obfuscation, attacking critics, and old-fashioned lobbying. We should be able to discern what is happening and demand this be brought under control."
"Facebook Could Underperform in Third Quarter: AnalystFacebook has been under intense pressure in recent weeks from an investigative reporting series by The Wall Street Journal, heated Congressional hearings and intensifying talk of how regulators might rein in the power of the social networking giant. But what would really hurt the social media giant with investors is a bad quarter, and one prominent analyst thinks there’s danger lurking in September quarter results.Evercore ISI analyst Mark Mahaney late Thursday added Facebook (ticker: FB) to his firm’s “tactical underperform..."
"NYT Part 1 : Facebook Is Weaker Than We KnewA trove of leaked documents, published by The Wall Street Journal, hints at a company whose best days are behind it.One possible way to read “The Facebook Files,” The Wall Street Journal’s excellent series of reports based on leaked internal Facebook research, is as a story about an unstoppable juggernaut bulldozing society on its way to the bank.The series has exposed damning evidence that Facebook has a two-tier justice system, that it knew Instagram was worsening body-image issues among girls and that it had a bigger vaccine misinformation problem than it let on, among other issues. And it would be easy enough to come away thinking that Facebook is terrifyingly powerful, and can be brought to heel only with aggressive government intervention.But there’s another way to read the series, and it’s the interpretation that has reverberated louder inside my brain as each new installment has landed.Which is: Facebook is in trouble.Not financial trouble, or legal trouble, or even senators-yelling-at-Mark-Zuckerberg trouble. What I’m talking about is a kind of slow, steady decline that anyone who has ever seen a dying company up close can recognize. It’s a cloud of existential dread that hangs over an organization whose best days are behind it, influencing every managerial priority and product decision and leading to increasingly desperate attempts to find a way out. This kind of decline is not necessarily visible from the outside, but insiders see a hundred small, disquieting signs of it every day — user-hostile growth hacks, frenetic pivots, executive paranoia, the gradual attrition of talented colleagues.It has become fashionable among Facebook critics to emphasize the company’s size and dominance while bashing its missteps. In a Senate hearing on Thursday, lawmakers grilled Antigone Davis, Facebook’s global head of safety, with questions about the company’s addictive product design and the influence it has over its billions of users. Many of the questions to Ms. Davis were hostile, but as with most Big Tech hearings, there was an odd sort of deference in the air, as if the lawmakers were asking: Hey, Godzilla, would you please stop stomping on Tokyo?But if these leaked documents proved anything, it is how un-Godzilla-like Facebook feels. Internally, the company worries that it is losing power and influence, not gaining it, and its own research shows that many of its products aren’t thriving organically. Instead, it is going to increasingly extreme lengths to improve its toxic image, and to stop users from abandoning its apps in favor of more compelling alternatives.You can see this vulnerability on display in an installment of The Journal’s series that landed last week. The article, which cited internal Facebook research, revealed that the company has been strategizing about how to market itself to children, referring to preteens as a “valuable but untapped audience.” The article contained plenty of fodder for outrage, including a presentation in which Facebook researchers asked if there was “a way to leverage playdates to drive word of hand/growth among kids?”It’s a crazy-sounding question, but it’s also revealing. Would a confident, thriving social media app need to “leverage playdates,” or concoct elaborate growth strategies aimed at 10-year-olds? If Facebook is so unstoppable, would it really be promoting itself to tweens as — and please read this in the voice of the Steve Buscemi “How do you do, fellow kids?” meme — a “Life Coach for Adulting?”The truth is that Facebook’s thirst for young users is less about dominating a new market and more about staving off irrelevance. Facebook use among teenagers in the United States has been declining for years, and is expected to plummet even further soon — internal researchers predicted that daily use would decline 45 percent by 2023. The researchers also revealed that Instagram, whose growth offset declining interest in Facebook’s core app for years, is losing market share to faster-growing rivals like TikTok, and younger users aren’t posting as much content as they used to.“Facebook is for old people” was the brutal verdict delivered by one 11-year-old boy to the company’s researchers, according to the internal documents."
"The calm before the storm? Dunno. But it won't be long before the pols call in FB. They Dems need to show resolve in some topical area prior to the November 2, 2021 elections or risk losing big time. Keep an eye on the race for governor in Virginia. Typically a Dem stronghold, would be a huge upset if the GOP win that election."
Facebook revenue is 40x snapchat
Don't fight the market!
So it did hit 330..Let us see if other FAANG stocks hit pe of 24?
"Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen testifies before the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Consumer Protection on Tuesday. Haugen, a former product manager on Facebook’s civic misinformation team, according to her website, revealed herself as the source behind a trove of leaked documents. On her personal website, she shared that during her time at the company, she “became increasingly alarmed by the choices the company makes prioritizing their own profits over public safety — putting people’s lives at risk. As a last resort and at great personal risk, Frances made the courageous act to blow the whistle on Facebook.”https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0YcvkpgiZU"
"Why I see FB is a good short opportunity, simply there isn’t enough money in the world of “advertising” to keep the current growth rate going."
"Advertisers WILL STAY with Facebook. They have no other better avenue. Small, mid, and large businesses survive off Facebook advertising. Media noise always gets it wrong creating and Buying opportunities..proving fact. Good Luck"
Alfi and facebook!! Wow!! Check out the tweet! Booom! #ALF #FB
No way FB gets regulated otherwise so does Google and everyone else even Amazon. Big tech runs America.
"Oh now they put in safety regulations for kids. Ya. Very thoughtful. Only after they feel the heat, not out of true senserity or their own knowledge of the damage they have caused over several years. I could see children or parents having good cause for lawsuits in the near future, now that they have been exposed. They could lose billions in class actions."
"Facebook is like a telephone. People are responsible for what they put on there. Facebook isn't responsible for what people do. Good grief, you can't blame a company for what individuals do. That is like saying a cell phone is responsible for the words a person says. If you don't like Facebook, don't get on there. I don't use FB."
"Correction of the overall market is imminent. Tech will be hit particularly hard, as the Covid tech craze is slowly fading. Add the legal issues and possible antitrust action against FBInstaWApp and it´s easy to predict where this stock will be going in the short/mid term. It will be back, but at this time I´m not going near FB."
"Facebook amazing not question about.PAYO, PSFE, FINV, GGPI, STAF and MVST and NIO and ASTR are the best!!!Beast "
5$ dollars up today would be great
"FB provides a platform for people to communicate with their family and friends, and to present their opinions for all kinds of things. Most of people enjoy the service. It's not perfect but has made progress with time. I understand that Politicians attack FB for their own purposes, however what I don't understand is why some people hit FB so much but still using it everyday. Mark has an over 90% of employee satisfactory rate in FB. Two whistle blowers found some secrets nobody knows after one got fired and another's job was eliminated. What a joke!!!"
"A few days ago I’ve deleted my FB account. My life did not change at all since I was not getting any real value from FB anyways, but it feels so good to not be a part of the problem anymore."

"funny how fb was offline yesterday, hmmm, did nt want the whistleblower to trend?"
life was so much more enjoyable today with no social media.
Shareholders are stuck with a discounted share price until there is a major change-out of the C-Suite! Shareholders want Zuckerberg out!! !
I'll buy FB when it hits 260
Taking it to 326. I do not have high expectations
"After seeing the 60 minutes interview and politicians rallying up against facebook, I have no doubt that FB will crash another 20%-30% or maybe even more until all of this over, I sold it with a loss last week, but I hope I made better choice."
In with 123 shares at $332. Am I going to be bag holding come Christmas? RSI shows over sold at this level. Earnings is expected to beat. Company has amazing financials. Can’t imagine it’s held down much longer.
FB on 30% discount- whole world use it for everything. bigger picture it will turn around soon to $400
"Bad news and worse has all been baked in. This hasn't dropped 15% on flowers and rainbows. NOW is the time to start averaging in. I have never owned FB until this opportunity to buy a solid company with a great moat at a fair price. Do you really think that the amount of social networking is going to decrease considering Twitter, Instagram etc.? I'm actually hoping FB will tank some more so that I continue to grow the position. If not I'm delighted where I am!"
"Next time you pick a short, maybe choose a company that has less than $85 billion in annual revenue and 45% margins."
If you have a human heart sell your stocks now. FB has a huge impact on our children and this isn't helping instead it ruins their childhood.
"FB dose like some kind of man, he will standup EVERY TIME after being beatdown. WHY? because US needs FB more than FB needs US. Without FB, CHINA will take the international SM platform. The value of FB should be recognized as a freedom speech in the WORLD. In US we can say whatever we want and like to complain everything everyday. However FB is THE only communication place where people can talk freely in many counties. I like FB."
The whistleblower got her interviews and probably a book deal. Now she's last weeks news
They had some interesting insights about FB on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.

"Leading human rights groups launch ‘How to Stop Facebook’ campaign: call for data privacy legislation ‘strong enough to end Facebook’s current business model.’40+ organizations say clearest path for lawmakers to reduce Facebook’s harm is to ban the data harvesting & surveillance practices that fuel Big Tech’s harmful algorithmsWASHINGTON - As Congress debates how best to address the dominance and harm of Facebook in the wake of whistleblower Frances Haugen’s testimony, a group of 40+ human rights organizations have launched HowToStopFacebook.org, a major new campaign that will drive emails and calls to legislators demanding: * A full Congressional investigation into Facebook’s harms, using subpoena power* A real Federal data privacy law that makes it illegal for companies like Facebook and YouTube to collect the enormous amount of data they use to power their harmful and personalized recommendation algorithms. The campaign page calls for a law “strong enough to end Facebook’s current business model.”The campaign page, built by Fight for the Future, features a stunning animation from designer Vasjen Katro, and the 40+ participating organizations include Accountable Tech, Article 19, Center for Digital Democracy, FairPlay, Global Voices, Media Justice, National Hispanic Media Coalition, Presenté, Public Knowledge, United We Dream, Ranking Digital Rights, SumOfUs, Win Without War, and the Sex Workers Project of the Urban Justice Center. “The problem with companies like Facebook and YouTube is not that they host user generated content, it’s that they use surveillance-driven algorithms to pick and choose what content goes viral and what content no one sees, in order to keep us all on the platform clicking and scrolling to maximize advertising revenue,” said Evan Greer (she/her) director of Fight for the Future, “The enormous amount of data that these companies harvest about all of us is the fuel supply that powers these harmful algorithms. It’s challenging to regulate algorithms directly, but lawmakers can cut off the fuel supply for Facebook’s destructive machine by enacting a real Federal data privacy law strong enough to effectively kill surveillance capitalism as a business model.” “Facebook’s surveillance capitalist business model is fundamentally incompatible with basic human rights, and disproportionately harms Black and brown communities by silencing our voices while artificially amplifying racist and harmful content,” said Myaisha Hayes (she/her), Campaign Strategies Director of Media Justice, “Facebook’s surveillance machine is putting our communities and our democracy in danger. It’s time for lawmakers to cut off their fuel supply by passing a strong data privacy law.”“Congress could take a massive step to reduce Facebook’s power and influence if it passed a strong, comprehensive privacy law now. Facebook, as well as other tech companies, have shown that when given the opportunity, they will exploit consumers’ data rather than protect it,” said Sara Collins, Policy Counsel at Public Knowledge. “The harms described by Ms. Haugen are fueled by unrestrained data collection and data use. A federal privacy law that addresses collection and use, rather than relies on outdated notions of notice and choice, would begin to rectify the power imbalance between internet users and tech companies.”"
"I learned a lot tonight. EVERYTHING you put on Facebook is the property of Facebook. You can delete something, but they keep a copy forever, that they can sell."

Great buying opportunity
"ALL FAKE PULLDOWN created by hedgies, their games are ending. the more we buy/ accumulate this level, the more explosive the short squeeze become.

FB only gets this high cuz of unnoticed criminal activity now that it's discovered FB will tank to the bottom.
"Facebook remains the cheapest stock in the large cap category..............Forget about the fake crises and threats of regulation......>Facebook will come out of anything it faces even stronger....easy double from here in the not too distant future.

"Facebook whistleblower to appear before UK ParliamentFrances Haugen, the Facebook whistleblower who accuses the technology giant of putting profit ahead of safety, will give evidence to the UK Parliament later this month.Ms Haugen will appear before the Online Safety Bill committee on 25 October.It is examining a law to impose obligations on social-media companies to protect users, especially children.Ms Haugen alleges Facebook harms children's mental health and stokes division in society.Facebook firmly denies any such allegations, with boss Mark Zuckerberg labelling them ""illogical"".'Damage profits'The former Facebook employee had handed over internal documents to the Wall Street Journal newspaper, which ran a series of news stories in September about Facebook's inner workings.Giving evidence to a US Senate committee last week, she said Facebook refused to make changes that would make the platform safer because it might damage profits.And she is calling for government regulation of the technology giant - both in the US and around the world.The UK's Online Safety Bill is potentially one such piece of regulation.Damian Collins, who chairs the committee reviewing the draft legislation, said Ms Haugen's information to date had ""strengthened the case for an independent regulator with the power to audit and inspect the big tech companies"".""There needs to be greater transparency on the decisions companies like Facebook take when they trade off user safety for user engagement,"" he said.Mr Collins also accused Mr Zuckerberg and former UK Deputy Prime Minister turned Facebook communications chief Nick Clegg of wanting to ""stop any insights into how the company manages harmful content... unless they have personally approved them"".Ms Haugen has also been invited on 8 November to a committee of MEPs investigating ""the negative impact"" of big tech firms on users."
What now? Total joke. Whistle blowers lol. Yeah ground breaking info. How naive were people? This company will continue to be the de facto platform and crush earnings for years to come.
"Right Now, this is -- TOXIC ---- hated equally by the democrats, the republicans and most countriesALL tech companies have a life cycle and this one is past its use-by-date.-----think MySpace ---"
"Haugen’s testimony was a “Big Tobacco moment” for Facebook — a reference to past revelations that major cigarette companies knew their products were addictive and deadly. Facebook has weathered a number of scandals in recent years, but some industry experts agree with Blumenthal’s assessment that the company is facing a “moment of reckoning.”They argue that this latest crisis is different from previous ones because it suggests that Facebook’s leadership was actively complicit in the damage its products does, rather than simply being taken advantage of by bad actors. Some argue that the combined pressures of public outrage, employee discontent and potential hits to the company’s stock price may be enough to convince CEO Mark Zuckerberg to change Facebook’s underlying structures that boost controversial content. Recent critical statements by lawmakers from both parties also suggest that Congress may have the momentum to pass legislation that forces Big Tech firms to adjust their business models."
Why is this dropping in pre-market ?Should be at 329+
"PEs as of business close today:MSFT. 38Google 31Apple 28Facebook 24Such a very disturbing reality; why is there no trust in Facebook, no belief in its growth story?? Even Walmart trades at a significantly higher pe - 39!!The answer lies in the distrust of its leadership team and disbelief in its strategy. NO CREDiBILITY MEANS NO PRICE PREMIUM!"
Fb took all year to stop covid misinfo... but the genie is out ofThe bottle .. who is responsible? Yup Facebook
Share price will never be positioned at a premium until Zuckerberg is ousted!
Still not too late to buy now. $350 easy by year end
Zuck sold 1/100 of a percent of his shares yesterday as part of an automatic trading program. Anyone else smell bear desperation?
"Facebook whistleblower to testify before CongressFormer Facebook product manager Frances Haugen, the whistleblower behind a major leak of internal company documents, is set to testify before US lawmakers for the first time on Tuesday.Haugen publicly revealed herself to be the Facebook whistleblower during an interview that the CBS television program 60 Minutes aired on Sunday. The 37-year-old gathered thousands of pages of documents and communications, some of which The Wall Street Journal used to publish a series of stories about how Facebook is aware of the harm the company's platform can inflict, including on the mental health of teenagers. ""There were conflicts of interest between what was good for the public and what was good for Facebook. And Facebook, over and over again, chose to optimize for its own interests, like making more money,"" Haugen said during the 60 Minutes interview. She worked on Facebook's efforts to combat election interference and misinformation for nearly two years before leaving the social network in May. Now lawmakers are trying to learn more from Haugen about what type of regulation could help keep social networks such as Facebook more accountable. The Senate Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, and Data Security is holding a hearing, titled ""Protecting Kids Online: Testimony from a Facebook Whistleblower."" Tuesday's hearing comes less than a week after Facebook's head of safety, Antigone Davis, appeared before Congress. Facebook says The Wall Street Journal mischaracterized its research, noting that its platform also has benefits such as helping people keep in touch with family and friends. The company, which suffered a massive outage on Monday, has been plagued by numerous scandals including about data privacy.What to expectUS lawmakers will likely press the whistleblower for more details about what she learned while working for Facebook and other tech companies. Before joining Facebook, Haugen worked for Google, Yelp and Pinterest. ""Facebook's actions make clear that we cannot trust it to police itself. We must consider stronger oversight, effective protections for children, & tools for parents, among the needed reforms,"" tweeted Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat who chairs the Senate subcommittee hosting the hearing. Lawmakers are trying to gather more information, including from companies outside of Facebook, as they weigh what type of regulation to pass. Last week, Blumenthal, along with Democrats Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts and Rep. Kathy Castor of Florida, reintroduced the Kids Internet Design and Safety Act. The bill would ban features such as ""likes"" and follower counts for users under the age of 16 years old. The legislation also addresses other issues such as manipulative marketing and the amplification of harmful content."
E/R next week. Load it up. Good numbers are expected as usual.
I can't wait for Oct 25. FB will be back in $360's.
Futures flying !!! Facebook will go up 2% tomorrow!!!
"Facebook 'accountable to no one,' whistleblower will say in testimonyWASHINGTON, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Former Facebook employee and whistleblower Frances Haugen will tell Congress Tuesday that the social media giant faces no oversight, comparing it to tobacco companies denying harm and government seatbelt mandates, according to testimony seen by Reuters.""When we realized tobacco companies were hiding the harms it caused, the government took action. When we figured out cars were safer with seatbelts, the government took action,"" Haugen's written testimony before a Senate Commerce subcommittee set for Tuesday says. ""I implore you to do the same here."""
Might end close to green.
"One side: whistle blowers, human right groups, politicians and millions who complain the service that they use everyday. Another side: FB and its thousants hardworking employee, billions users, millions advertisers. Pick your side, PLEASE."
Facebook is down because they are trying to delete the evidence on their servers. I hope congress doesn’t believe it’s a tech issue. Dear congress ... please recover the deleted files that fb has been doing.
Short SNAP buy FB. Money in the bank
Very hard to say where FB will end up. It’s been on a downtrend now for a month . It’s gonna be a Rocky stock for the next few weeks/months . That’s for sure. I wouldn’t go to heavy until we get a good confirmation/close above a strong support
Facebook purchased the patents from Blackberry. $BB $FB
Fb gave me a chance to purchase it every two years. in accordance with the government's policy
The big short Michael Burry is unloading his FB long to cover his TSLA short
"Bought FB for the first time. I do not agree with their platform but here to make $$$$. How many times did FB management faced crisis and Congress. They always bounce back. Congress should be busy doing people's work. Gasoline at $4 a gallon, inflation the border a mess. Parents should in charge of watching their kids not FB. What is wrong with our country. I say FB is a $400 stock. Just a matter of time"
WHAT OTHER PLATFORM HAS 1 BILLION USERS? FACEBOOK HAS 3.5 BILLION.
big money at the corner. ready guys. i bought a lot.
Stock can’t stay out of the news. Any headline knocks this down $3-$4. Longs wake up and scour the news hoping not to see anything Facebook related.
"There is an article in this week's Barron, in which the impact on FB from the whistle blower last week is assessed. The impact on FB is summarized in the following 5 areas: 1) user - no impact, 2) advertiser - no impact, 3) internal spending on security - Yes, may get increase, 4) Stock price - it's the cheapest one in the top tech companies, and 5) businesses other than AD, such as E-payment, online shopping for small business, VR, etc. - important for FB however there is no impact due to the current event. It's a very reasonable study. Good luck!"
"All of the whistleblower complaints were addressed in the Netflix film Social Dilemma a couple of years ago. Her info is not new, yet FB lost $100 billion in value. Me no comprendo"

did anyone else see Mark Mahaney on CNBC half hour ago? FB is his number one pick but i did not see price target. Did you? Uber his 2nd pick with $70 target.
The most bearish thing that comes to mind is if the FTC bans future acquisitions entirely. I do expect this to happen but I also think that any potential competitor will have a hard time scaling up to compete with Facebook. The reason why this company is worth 900 billion today is because of the instagram acquisition. Without it i'm not sure it would even be worth $300 billion.
"If you believe that a big tech company can only go up indefinitely, check out Microsoft between ‘99 and 2014. For 15 years they were going nowhere until they reinvented themselves."

Facebook prioritizing profits over people. Gee what big American company doesn't do that?.......... Still waiting ...... waiting ................ Still waiting ........ waiting ? name one? waiting?
"It's one thing for a former employee to accuse a company, it's quite another when they have the documents that prove the accusations factual. That was the case last night on ""60 Minutes"" when the Whistleblower zinged FB and made the company and it's leadership look pretty guilty.As an aside, Zuck isn't a very likeable personality. Really need someone else to be the face of Facebook."
FB is 20% of my current portfolio. Not even worried with what I'm hearing. FB is a money machine. $450 next year.
"Dow and Nasdaq both up handsomely, yet FB red by almost $4.00. Yesterday's NY Post story certainly isn't helping FB's already tarnished image. People and businesses would leave FB in droves if there were a better alternative available. Thankfully, for FB, there isn't one."

"Why has there been no public commentary from Zuckerberg, except for the missive sent to employees? Is that the best a CEO and CoB can do for his company? Is that leadership? Zuckerberg and Sandberg are hiding behind a wall of attorneys, and shareholders are stuck without solid representation within the company. Tough to accept!"

Frances Haugen tied to hedge fund short FB
If Zuckerberg was innocent he would speak up and defend himself instead of hiding in his moms basement.
"2 whistle blowers, one was fired, and anther's position was eliminated, now they are backed up politicians trying to destroy the greatest SM company in the world. Nobody likes politicians however they know how to manipulate people's mind for their own purpose. ""House of Cards"" describes politician well."
3 days ago this was falling off the cliff. I guess the righted the ship. Total bs selling for tute accumulation only. Total manipulation
Just wait a few weeks and the market will find its next headline at another company and Facebook will go back up.

"Uh oh! Prison for Zuck? I guess that depends on the country he visits perhaps, and who he acted against? A disgruntled FB employee:“I’ve found multiple blatant attempts by foreign national governments to abuse our platform on vast scales to mislead their own citizenry, and caused international news on multiple occasions. I have personally made decisions that affected national presidents without oversight, and taken action to enforce against so many prominent politicians globally that I’ve lost count.”A Facebook spokesperson said the company had invested billions in improving security against networks who attempt to misuse the platform. “We have [...]taken down over 150 networks seeking to manipulate public debate since 2017, and they have originated in over 50 countries, with the majority coming from or focused outside of the US. Our track record shows that we crack down on abuse abroad with the same intensity that we apply in the US.”"

All the $FB dip buyers be like
Thanks again guys
Has anyone else noticed that even tho this has dropped over 12% the macd is still green and starting to curl back up? Looks like it’s about to head higher.

"Intentionally being driven down to the 200 day moving average via bs hit piece tactics, Someone big wants to buy in for a very large stake ahead of earnings on the cheap. Expect to hear record earnings numbers on this one and an immediate 7% pop on the “news” followed by a massive rally back to all time highs. Then for some reason you’ll never hear any negative news again for at least another quarter…"
imagine having bought this every time it dipped 15%.
"$85 billion in revenue growing 37% a year. No costs to serve adds. Margins improving despite being 45%. 3.5 BILLION users, which is 5x the next ecosystem. 1/5 valuation per dollar of revenue (and per user) of Snap. Sounds like a great short. Go for it."
now we go to $ 400. New high is coming. :-)

"Social media firms serve as gateway for scammers, says finance watchdogSocial media sites such as Facebook and Instagram serve as a “gateway” for fraudsters, the City watchdog has warned, as it demanded they take tougher action on financial scams.While the Financial Conduct Authority praised Google for having changed its terms for financial advertisements this month, the regulator’s head of enforcement said other tech firms were lagging behind.“Social media sites are effectively a gateway in which scammers are getting access to vast numbers of people in the population through online searches,” Mark Steward said during the FCA’s annual public meeting on Tuesday.“We are putting them on notice that we expect them to be involved in this process of protecting the community,” he said, adding that the FCA would otherwise “have to take action”.The FCA has waged a long-running battle with social media firms and search engines amid a spike in online fraud, which the Home Office has said makes up about 86% of all fraud in the UK. The trend has been attributed in part to the Covid crisis, which has led to more criminal activity online.In total, scammers stole about £4m a day from UK consumers in the first half of the year, according to the banking lobby group UK Finance, which warned last week that the level of fraud was posing a national security threat.A coalition of banking and tech companies has launched an emergency helpline – accessed by dialling 159 – for people to report and check financial scams. The hotline will connect callers directly to their bank’s fraud prevention service."
Up now in the premarket... You just have to wait til 7:30 and or 8:00... Most brokers don't let you buy until those times.
Alot of talking down on tech stocks but I believe in a company like FB which is resilient
say good buy... This thing is taking off
"FB trading in way, WAY oversold territory!*** However, the silver lining is that the volume is quite modest, so; this decline is an obvious buyer’s opportunity!"
Fake news didn’t drive FB down. About to hit 350 - 370
"Facebook misled investors about its reach, whistleblower tells SECInternal documents released ahead of Senate hearing reveal years-long decline in younger users in the USFacebook has misled investors about the size of its audience and concealed a years-long decline in younger users in the US, said Frances Haugen, a whistleblower, in a complaint to the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The data scientist, who worked at Facebook until May, will appear before US senators in Washington at a hearing on Tuesday after a series of damning interviews on CBS’s 60 Minutes and the Wall Street Journal, engulfing Facebook in its biggest reputational crisis for years. She plans to urge lawmakers to regulate the social media group more tightly, likening it to tobacco companies that hid the dangers of smoking, opioid makers, and carmakers before seat belts became mandatory, according to written remarks. “When we realized tobacco companies were hiding the harms it caused, the government took action,” she said in remarks published ahead of the hearing. The latest allegations that Facebook “misrepresented” its “reach and frequency” metrics form one of eight complaints Haugen filed to the SEC, which were first reported by CBS News. A drop in Facebook’s younger users continued even during the coronavirus pandemic, when overall social media use surged. “During Covid, every cohort’s use of Facebook increased, except for those 23 and under, which continued to decline,” the complaint said. Haugen, a former Facebook product manager, pointed to internal company projections that a drop in engagement from American teens could drive an overall decline in its US daily users by as much as 45 per cent between 2021 and 2023. Lawyers for Haugen cite internal company documents dating back several years to support the whistleblower’s allegations of “material misrepresentations and omissions” to investors, including through SEC filings and testimony to US Congress. In letters to the SEC written by Whistleblower Aid, a non-profit legal organisation that has identified itself as representing Haugen, Facebook was also accused of failing to take action against extremism, hate speech, human trafficking and ethnic violence on its apps, including Instagram. The complaint about Facebook’s reach said that “for years, Facebook has misrepresented core metrics to investors and advertisers including the amount of content produced on its platforms and growth in individual users”, especially in “high-value demographics” such as American teenagers. “By delivering too many ads to users that the advertisers did not want to pay for, Facebook overcharged advertisers on a vast scale,” the complaint said.Haugen’s legal team cited internal Facebook records showing that more than 15 per cent of new accounts created by teenagers are secondary or duplicates. Facebook usage among young adults aged 18 to 24 “continues to decline”, according to excerpts from internal documents in the SEC filing, while young adults “spend less time, produce less and send fewer messages” on the social network. Jason Kint, head of Digital Content Next, a trade body representing online publishers, and a persistent Facebook critic, said in a series of tweets that the allegations were “deadly” and “incredibly damning”.Facebook is already fighting a class-action lawsuit in California over claims that its estimates of advertisers’ “potential reach” included duplicate and fake accounts. Earlier this year, court filings showed that Carolyn Everson, then one of Facebook’s top advertising executives, warned colleagues to “prepare for the worst” over the claims. Everson resigned from Facebook in June."

FB is still on pace to top $400 by December 31!

Seems like the new whistle blower that just came out is just bitter that she got fired.
Look for a major reversal today. Any close plus today will cause a run to $340's next week. Just from a technical point of view
"Folks FB is noway near-premium to where the share price will rise to. The recent dip once again was another point of entry for anyone continuing to seek an exceptional 2021 into 2022 which will continue to remain an even more profitable year as the market reopens and new social, remote, autonomous and business trends take hold of the Internet's evolution to 3.0."

"Got that sinking feeling that FB is gonna drop below $300 in the near future. FB is a perfect spiral for becoming a political football. Every pol is gonna make social media a focus in their re-election campaign. FB is an easy target, especially since the whistleblower exposed some of its dirty laundry, which for the sleazy pols is akin to placing raw meat in front of a pit bull. They just can't get enough. Pity, because I suspect revenues and earnings will continue to rise, however that may not be enough to fend off the effects of the pols firing one broadside after another at the bow of the Good Ship Facebook."
"The whistleblower is a distraction to keep us from hearing what is really going on. Zucker has bigger troubles. Do your homework, Gateway Pundit, Breitbart, WND, Press California, Epic Times are all reliable news sources. Fakebook, Twitter, You Tube and Google are all censoring truth."
"FB last revenue from advertising was 29 Billion (Very strong), but here is that thing many are missing, I can’t see this revenue growing, Unless businesses from other planets start to advertise on FB. The 425$ price target is not realistic to me, sure the share price could go to 1000$, and it go to 145$, who knows."

However, Facebook did not take her findings seriously, alleged Zhang."

You’re right I was wrong it’ll be down between six and seven dollars today Facebook
"So the whistleblower says FB lied to us, oh boo hoo. How are they any different than the politicians that are suppose to regulate them. They are no different than them or any of the othe corporate leaders however we need corporations."

FB media attacks tied to hedge funds trying to buy cheaper calls
"My fellow FB homies,1. I am on the sidelines sitting on some dry powder2. I am waiting for FB to reach $300 before I feel comfortable to jump in and buy some FB stock3. My understanding is that a second employee is going to testify against FB4. I think that FB is a strong company and that the government and FB can agree on some basic new rules to protect minor kids as well as to stop crazy people from using FB to create chaos in America (Example: January-6-2021 chaos in Washington, DC)5. So, short term (meaning the next 30 days), we are going to see FB red most of the days... towards the $300 price6. This basically means that FB will be visiting lower prices...7. Many people, including myself, think that FB will probably reach $300 during October-20218. I do think that FB issues are temporary, and the stock will go back to $370-$390 by the end of year...9. Fair enough?Peace!"
FB proves again that negative press only brings good buying opportunities for those wanting to get in on the dips. Good Luck

"I really don’t understand people expecting big earnings. FB already declared they are not expecting growth: With respect to guidance for the second half of the year, Facebook said it expects ""year-over-year total revenue growth rates to decelerate significantly on a sequential basis as we lap periods of increasingly strong growth."""
"I sold FB during the whistleblower announcement after 7 years of holding onto this, but to be fair to Zuckerberg, he's made you all a lot of money over the years, so why the mass hate? I dont get itWaiting to get in at a lower price or just anti-zuck?"
I heard about FB the other day on (http://Multistockalerts.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
"FB reiterated overweight with a $450 price target at JPMorganNegative Facebook news flow seen before, buy the selloff, says JPMorganFacebook shares are up 22% year-to-date but down 13% from recent highs ""on considerable negative news flow,"" JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth tells investors in a research note. Going into the Q3 results, the analyst is ""comfortable"" with his Q3 revenue estimate of $29.5B and he does not believe investors are expecting much upside. Heading toward earnings, the setup is ""fairly different"" with the shares closer to $330 than $380, says Anmuth. The analyst recommends buying Facebook on the pullback, saying the negative news flow has been seen before and that Facebook itself continues to call for regulation. Anmuth keeps an Overweight rating on the shares with a $450 price target."
"FB will lose more on the down day and gain less on the up day. Another word, it will underperform the market until next ER"
This whistleblower this will pass and Facebook will recover like in the past. Buy the dip
"FB 450-500 will come. Hedgies game are ending, MILLENIALS are buying in mass. I see Zillow (Z), COIN , WDC short squeeze is happening. Buy in mass FB, Z, WDC, COIN, AMZN, JBLU all will keep correcting weeks"
"FB stock remains on “massive sale” with tremendous upside from these bargain basement levels with a solid Q3 in the books, and strong business liftoff to its current strongest Qtr of its fiscal year that will deliver record revenues and profits to close out this year!*** Earnings and profits are the key drivers of stock profits— not a bunch of noise!"
"I've heard from several that the iOS privacy change has had a material impact on advertising effectiveness on Facebook. Without the same level of targeted advertising, ad spend didn't / doesn't go nearly as far (and Facebook has been forced to offer free advertising in compensation). I think we'll see some of this noise in the numbers. Probably good for Google and Amazon (I'm not invested in any of these businesses)."
May be FB will give cautionary outlook and that news leaked out? Their growth plans are in disarray because they put certain plans on hold for further evaluation.
"Some libnut gets all huffed up in a tizzy because FB isn't doing enough to censor conservatives, goes before Congress to vent and the stock plummets.... Thanks for the gift. Too easy."
"Roro, lets see how your short does. So far you are down and pooing bricks."
"U.S. senator asks Facebook CEO to retain documents linked to testimonyWASHINGTON, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Senate Commerce Committee Chair Maria Cantwell on Tuesday called on Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg to preserve all documents related to a testimony last week from company whistleblower Frances Haugen.""The testimony ... raises significant concerns about whether Facebook has misled the public, federal regulators, and this committee,"" said Cantwell, a Democrat. ""This committee will continue its oversight and work to pursue legislation to protect consumers’ privacy, improve data security, and strengthen federal enforcement to address the digital harms that are the subject of these hearings.""She asked Facebook to preserve and retain internal Facebook research referenced by Haugen and Facebook’s evaluation of the research; ranking or composition systems; experiments or recommendations to change those ranking systems and the impact of Facebook’s platforms on children and teenagers under the age of 18.Cantwell's letter cited ""the potential danger that social media platforms pose for spreading divisive content was demonstrated, with horrifying consequences, by the role the Facebook platform played in fomenting ethnic violence against the Rohingya.""She added ""the role of Facebook’s platform in the Rohingya tragedy illustrates the horrible consequences that failing to effectively limit the spread of divisive content on social media platforms can have in inflicting public harm.""Last month, a U.S. judge ordered Facebook to release records of accounts connected to anti-Rohingya violence in Myanmar that the social media giant had shut down, rejecting its argument about protecting privacy as ""rich with irony.""Last week, the Commerce Committee harshly criticized Facebook, accusing Zuckerberg of pushing for higher profits while being cavalier about user safety, and demanded regulators investigate whistleblower accusations that the social media company harms children's mental health and stokes divisions.Zuckerberg defended the company, saying the accusations were at odds with Facebook's goals.Haugen called for transparency about how Facebook entices users to keep scrolling, creating ample opportunity for advertisers to reach them.Haugen, a former product manager on Facebook's civic misinformation team, left the nearly $1 trillion company with tens of thousands of confidential documents."
Keeps getting pushed down but is still printing higher lows and higher highs
FB is like food or pain reliever. Everything has two sides (good and bad). It is up to you how you use it. My church used it for gatherings and my family used it to share positive news. That’s the beauty. We controlled our destiny guys and gals.
hold for the long haul
"If you think discounting back 37% growth by an extra 1/4% matters, get outta here. So Facebook changes its algo, big deal. It still has 3.5 BILLION USERS that advertisers pay to access. The stock is cheap at $400. Thinking its going lower is DELUSIONAL. The whistleblower clearly has an agenda. She will be discovered."
Shareholders will NEVER achieve the potential full value of their holdings until Zuckerberg is gone. Change out the C-Suite NOW!!!
"My prediction is the SEC will come after Zuckerberg and his management team for misleading investors and threaten them with jail time, forcing a change in the management team. As a major shareholder, I want to see significant change, especially Zuckerberg stepping aside. He’s had nearly four years since the Cambridge-Analytica fiasco to burnish the company’s reputation and restore public confidence; he has failed; it’s time for a change."
I need to add another position before markets ramps up so bring on some negative press. Those naysayers always gets FB wrong. Good Luck
