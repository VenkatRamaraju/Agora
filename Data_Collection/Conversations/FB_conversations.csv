"About 4 weeks ago, FB came out with very nice earnings, ahead of estimates, but fell because they accurately and correctly told us that the year over year comparisons were not expected to continue, but rather return to a figure more in line with a comparison from two years ago. The pandemic simply caused improper comparisons. The stock fell.It is now returning to a figure that reflects a healthy expansion of about 20%. That means a doubling (in my opinion) of every 4 years for revenues and earnings. And since we have a pe of about 25, you should expect the stock price to follow. There vr could be a game changer - think Apple, and their Iphone - they had a very nice business before, but after!!!! Of course, that means that vr is really a game change.I do think 1,000 in 2025 is possible, and 2,000 by 2029 is very possible."

Split and dividend are overdue. Huge revenue and low debt ratio call for it.
"Facebook apologizes after labeling part of Declaration of Independence ‘hate speech’Facebook’s policies for censoring hate speech have again come under fire after the social media giant labeled a passage from the Declaration of Independence as hate speech.Facebook apologized to a Texas newspaper on Tuesday for deleting its post that included the passage. The Liberty County Vindicator had been posting excerpts of the Declaration of Independence daily leading up to July 4th. The first nine posts were published without a problem. The 10th post, which included paragraphs 27 through 31 of the Declaration of Independence, was deleted by Facebook."
"Michael Burry, the very smart guy who made 300 million shorting the sub prime mortgage market in 08 has a 2.3 billion dollar hedgefund. 10 stocks make up 90 percent of the fund. Facebook, as of this writing, is the number two position in his fund. He owns 350000 shares. Interestingly his number one position is a short on Tesla. Over 1 billion dollars. There you go. Smart guys invest in Facebook."
Long and Proud. $420 EOY here we come. No reason to sell before $800. Only another year folks. Cheers.
"I got in around $250 but only bought 3 shares. Regretting it massively.This will be $1,000 per share in a few years"
"If you’re a day trader, you should definitely check out (http://Pick-stocks.com). They send a watchlist covering the top pre-market movers every day before the open. It’s a great way to pick out potential trades for the day."
Facebook is a cash cow company look forward to see which direction they go in the future as they will have the money and resources to branch out.

You can never keep FB down for very long.
FB is undervalued
"Facebook and others doing ‘not nearly enough’ to stop COVID misinformation, surgeon general saysCriticism comes a day after Facebook quietly released its delayed first-quarter ‘content transparency report’U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy again criticized the role of social media in spreading COVID-19 misinformation Sunday, a day after Facebook Inc. quietly released a delayed report on its top-performing links.“The speed, scale and sophistication with which [misinformation] is spreading and impacting our health is really unprecedented,” Murthy said Sunday morning during an interview on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “And it’s happening largely, in part, aided and abetted by social-media platforms.”While acknowledging that some steps have been taken by social-media companies to crack down on the spread of misinformation, Murthy said “it’s not nearly enough.”“There are people who are superspreaders of misinformation,” he said. “And there are algorithms, still, which continue to serve up more and more misinformation to people who encounter it the first time. These are things that companies can and must change. And I think they have a moral responsibility to do so quickly and transparently.”Murthy cited an online myth that spurred the Food and Drug Administration to tweet Saturday that people should not use a drug intended for livestock as a treatment or to prevent COVID-19. The drug ivermectin can be toxic to humans, and Murthy said its use highlights “the profound cost of health misinformation.”Murthy’s comments came hours after a Saturday-night news dump by Facebook FB, +1.20%, which released its delayed first-quarter “content transparency report.” On Friday, the New York Times reported the findings had been shelved earlier this year after Facebook executives feared it would make the company look bad. Among the Facebook report’s findings: Its most-viewed link between January and March was a news story about a CDC investigation into the death of a doctor who had received the COVID-19 vaccine two weeks earlier, and that the Epoch Times, a newspaper that has spread right-wing conspiracy theories, was the 19th-most popular Facebook page in the first quarter.While the news story about the doctor was legitimate, some questioned why an article that cast doubt on the safety of the vaccine and was promoted heavily by anti-vaccine groups was distributed so widely by Facebook’s algorithm.Facebook had released its second-quarter content transparency report last week. That too, drew criticism.In a Medium blog post, Brian Boland, Facebook’s former vice president of product marketing, sharply criticized Facebook’s report, calling the data released “generally useless” and saying “this entire effort is a PR stunt.”"
