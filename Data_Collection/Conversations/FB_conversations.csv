"U.S. senators aim to stop vaccine misinformation by going after tech's legal immunityWASHINGTON, July 22 (Reuters) - Two Democratic U.S. senators on Thursday will add to the stack of bills going after Section 230 - a law that protects tech companies from being sued over content posted by users - making such platforms responsible for health-related misinformation.The legislation introduced by Amy Klobuchar and Ben Ray Lujan requires internet platforms such as Facebook to take down health and vaccine-related misinformation during public health emergencies or be held liable for that failure.It also directs the Department of Health & Human Services to issue guidelines on what constitutes health misinformation.""These are some of the biggest, richest companies in the world and they must do more to prevent the spread of deadly vaccine misinformation,"" Klobuchar said.The bill quotes a study from the Center for Countering Digital Hate that found social media platforms failed to act on 95% of coronavirus-related disinformation reported to them.Kevin Martin, a vice president of public policy at Facebook, said the company supports reforming Section 230.""We believe clarification on the difficult and urgent questions about health related misinformation would be helpful and look forward to working with Congress and the industry as we consider options for reform.""The Health Misinformation Act is not the first bill targeting tech firms' liability shield from Senator Klobuchar, who chairs the Senate antitrust subcommittee.Earlier this year, she co-sponsored another bill called the Safe Tech Act with two fellow Democrats. It aims to make social media companies more accountable for enabling cyber-stalking, targeted harassment and discrimination on their platforms."

"Facebook shut down German research on Instagram algorithm, researchers sayResearchers at AlgorithmWatch say they were forced to abandon their research project monitoring the Instagram algorithm after legal threats from Facebook. The Berlin-based project went public with the conflict in a post published Friday morning, citing the platform’s recent ban of the NYU Ad Observatory.“There are probably more cases of bullying that we do not know about,” the post reads. “We hope that by coming forward, more organizations will speak up about their experiences.” “the company cannot be trusted”Launched in March 2020, AlgorithmWatch provided a browser plug-in that would allow users to collect data from their Instagram feeds, providing insight into how the platform prioritizes pictures and videos. The project published findings regularly, showing that the algorithm encouraged photos that showed bare skin and that photos showing faces are ranked higher than screenshots of text. Facebook disputed the methodology but did not otherwise take action against AlgorithmWatch for the first year of the project.In May, researchers say Facebook asked to meet with the project leaders and accused them of violating the platform’s terms of service. Another objection was that the project violated the GDPR, since it collected data from users who had not consented to participate.“We only collected data related to content that Facebook displayed to the volunteers who installed the add-on,” the researchers say in their defense. “In other words, users of the plug-in where only accessing their own feed, and sharing it with us for research purposes.”Still, the researchers ultimately chose to shut down the project, believing they would face legal action from the company if it continued.The algorithms that manage news feeds on Facebook and Instagram are immensely powerful but poorly understood, and Facebook’s policies make it difficult to study them objectively. The NYU Ad Observatory, which tracked political advertising on the platform, saw its researchers banned earlier this month amid accusations of data scraping. In November, the company made similar legal threats against a browser called Friendly, which let users reorder their feeds chronologically. CrowdTangle, another popular tool for Facebook research, was acquired by the company in 2016.Facebook has some mechanisms for researchers to collect data directly from the company, including the Ad Library and its Social Science One partnerships. But AlgorithmWatch says the oppositional nature of their research makes the data inherently untrustworthy.“Researchers cannot rely on data provided by Facebook because the company cannot be trusted,” researchers say. “There is no reason to believe that Facebook would provide usable data, were researchers to replace their independently collected data with the company’s.”"

"Top Lawmakers And Consumer Advocates Condemn Facebook’s Decision To Block Academic Research On Political AdsA day after Facebook disabled academic researchers’ efforts to study political ad-targeting, critics including several top U.S. senators say the social network should be doing more to improve transparency.On Tuesday, Facebook announced it disabled access for a group of New York University researchers who have spent the past year studying how misinformation is spread through political ad-targeting on the platform. The group, called the NYU Ad Observatory, began in September 2020 in collaboration with thousands of volunteers who downloaded a plug-in to automatically send researchers copies of the political ads served to their accounts.Although Facebook has been in contact with the Ad Observatory since last year, the company didn’t shut down their accounts until yesterday—just hours after researchers said they informed Facebook that they were studying the spread of disinformation on the platform related to the January 6 attacks at the U.S. Capitol.The move comes almost exactly two years after Facebook’s landmark settlement with the Federal Trade Commission, which in 2019 fined the Silicon Valley giant $5 billion over data privacy violations. As a part of the settlement, the FTC also imposed new data privacy restrictions and new accountability standards.Lawmakers who have pushed for regulating digital advertising in recent years condemned Facebook’s decision. In an emailed statement sent today to Forbes, U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar said “it is vital that social media companies both protect user data and improve transparency.” U.S. Senator Mark Warner—a vocal critic of Facebook and other tech giants—also released a statement describing Facebook’s decision to cut off the Ad Observatory as “deeply concerning.” And on Twitter, U.S. Senator Ron Wyden said he’s asked the FTC to “to confirm that this excuse is as bogus as it sounds.”“After years of abusing users' privacy, it's rich for Facebook to use it as an excuse to crack down on researchers exposing its problems,” Wyden wrote.Klobuchar, a co-sponsor of the Honest Ads Act—a bipartisan bill that would modernize federal election laws to make social media advertising subject to the same rules as broadcast and print ads—said there are “serious problems with social media platforms that facilitate the spread of misinformation.” (Last month, she also introduced new legislation to hold Facebook and other tech companies accountable for health-related misinformation including content related to vaccines.)“As we face threats to our democracy, we need more transparency from online platforms, not less,” she said. “That is why I am deeply troubled by the news that Facebook is cutting off researcher access to political advertising data, which has shown that the company continues to sell millions of dollars’ worth of political ads without proper disclosures.”According to Warner, the Ad Observatory’s efforts have “repeatedly facilitated revelations of ads violating Facebook’s Terms of Service, ads for frauds and predatory financial schemes, and political ads that were improperly omitted from Facebook’s lackluster Ad Library.”“For several years now, I have called on social media platforms like Facebook to work with, and better empower, independent researchers, whose efforts consistently improve the integrity and safety of social media platforms by exposing harmful and exploitative activity,” Warner said. “Instead, Facebook has seemingly done the opposite. It’s past time for Congress to act to bring greater transparency to the shadowy world of online advertising, which continues to be a major vector for fraud and misconduct.”"

Apple disrupted the Facebook's surveillance business!
"Facebook and its advertisers are ‘panicking’ as the majority of iPhone users opt out of tracking(Bloomberg) -- When users get asked on iPhone devices if they’d like to be tracked, the vast majority say no. That’s worrying Facebook Inc.’s advertisers, who are losing access to some of their most valuable targeting data and have already seen a decrease in effectiveness of their ads.The new prompt from Apple Inc., which arrived in an iOS software update to iPhones in early June, explicitly asks users of each app whether they are willing to be tracked across their internet activity. Most are saying no, according to Branch, which analyzes mobile app growth. People are giving apps permission to track their behavior just 25% of the time, Branch found, severing a data pipeline that has powered the targeted advertising industry for years.“It’s been pretty devastating for I would say the majority of advertisers,” said Eric Seufert, a mobile analyst who writes the Mobile Dev Memo trade blog. “The big question is: Are we seeing just short-term volatility where we can expect a move back to the mean, or is this a new normal?”Facebook advertisers, in particular, have noticed an impact in the last month. Media buyers who run Facebook ad campaigns on behalf of clients said Facebook is no longer able to reliably see how many sales its clients are making, so it’s harder to figure out which Facebook ads are working. Losing this data also impacts Facebook’s ability to show a business’s products to potential new customers. It also makes it more difficult to “re-target” people with ads that show users items they have looked at online, but may not have purchased.Seufert estimated that in the first full quarter users see the prompt, the iOS changes could cut Facebook’s revenue by 7% if roughly 20% of users agree to be tracked. If just 10% of users grant Facebook tracking permission, revenue could be down as much as 13.6%, according to his models. The first full quarter with the prompt is the third quarter. Facebook reports second quarter earnings at the end of July.Most retail websites include Facebook software that sends detailed customer data back to the social network, including when a Facebook user makes a purchase. Facebook can then use that data to better understand what a retailer’s target customer looks like, and show that retailer’s ads to other people on Facebook who match that profile, known as a “lookalike” audience.But as people have asked Facebook and other apps not to track their behavior, the social networking company has started to lose access to this data. Gil David, a media buyer at Run DMG who spends about $1 million on Facebook ads per month for clients, said the company used to know about the vast majority of his client’s sales. Now that data is inconsistent. With one larger client, Facebook captured just 64% of sales. With a smaller client, just 42%.Zach Stuck, another media buyer who runs Homestead Studio and spends millions on Facebook ads per month, has seen the same changes. Facebook used to capture around 95% of the sales data from his clients. In one case now, there is a 57% gap between sales he can see on Shopify and what Facebook is reporting, he said.Since Facebook has a smaller sample of data, an advertiser may be paying to reach someone who doesn’t quite fit their target audience, making the ads less effective for the amount of money advertisers spend.“What Facebook was great at is they were able to see who bought and find that user’s buyer behavior – what other websites are they visiting, what other things are they doing,” Stuck said. When it can’t see this data, Facebook can’t accurately find “other people that might be able to buy a product similar to that.”Missing this sales data also makes it harder for Facebook to properly measure the impact of its ads because media buyers don’t know how many sales are being driven by their marketing campaigns. Facebook used to tell advertisers how many sales it made within certain demographic cohorts – women in Texas, or 18- to 25-year-old men, for example. The company has stopped sharing that level of detail, advertisers say.Apple has made privacy a foundation of the company’s latest marketing effort around the iPhone, pushing back against the digital advertising industry that has collected immense amounts of user data for years in ways that few people understood. The tagline for the company’s new iPhone television commercial is, “Choose who tracks your information… and who doesn’t.” The privacy changes apply to all app developers on the iPhone, not just Facebook."

"Facebook and others doing ‘not nearly enough’ to stop COVID misinformation, surgeon general saysCriticism comes a day after Facebook quietly released its delayed first-quarter ‘content transparency report’U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy again criticized the role of social media in spreading COVID-19 misinformation Sunday, a day after Facebook Inc. quietly released a delayed report on its top-performing links.“The speed, scale and sophistication with which [misinformation] is spreading and impacting our health is really unprecedented,” Murthy said Sunday morning during an interview on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “And it’s happening largely, in part, aided and abetted by social-media platforms.”While acknowledging that some steps have been taken by social-media companies to crack down on the spread of misinformation, Murthy said “it’s not nearly enough.”“There are people who are superspreaders of misinformation,” he said. “And there are algorithms, still, which continue to serve up more and more misinformation to people who encounter it the first time. These are things that companies can and must change. And I think they have a moral responsibility to do so quickly and transparently.”Murthy cited an online myth that spurred the Food and Drug Administration to tweet Saturday that people should not use a drug intended for livestock as a treatment or to prevent COVID-19. The drug ivermectin can be toxic to humans, and Murthy said its use highlights “the profound cost of health misinformation.”Murthy’s comments came hours after a Saturday-night news dump by Facebook FB, +1.20%, which released its delayed first-quarter “content transparency report.” On Friday, the New York Times reported the findings had been shelved earlier this year after Facebook executives feared it would make the company look bad. Among the Facebook report’s findings: Its most-viewed link between January and March was a news story about a CDC investigation into the death of a doctor who had received the COVID-19 vaccine two weeks earlier, and that the Epoch Times, a newspaper that has spread right-wing conspiracy theories, was the 19th-most popular Facebook page in the first quarter.While the news story about the doctor was legitimate, some questioned why an article that cast doubt on the safety of the vaccine and was promoted heavily by anti-vaccine groups was distributed so widely by Facebook’s algorithm.Facebook had released its second-quarter content transparency report last week. That too, drew criticism.In a Medium blog post, Brian Boland, Facebook’s former vice president of product marketing, sharply criticized Facebook’s report, calling the data released “generally useless” and saying “this entire effort is a PR stunt.”"

"About 4 weeks ago, FB came out with very nice earnings, ahead of estimates, but fell because they accurately and correctly told us that the year over year comparisons were not expected to continue, but rather return to a figure more in line with a comparison from two years ago. The pandemic simply caused improper comparisons. The stock fell.It is now returning to a figure that reflects a healthy expansion of about 20%. That means a doubling (in my opinion) of every 4 years for revenues and earnings. And since we have a pe of about 25, you should expect the stock price to follow. There vr could be a game changer - think Apple, and their Iphone - they had a very nice business before, but after!!!! Of course, that means that vr is really a game change.I do think 1,000 in 2025 is possible, and 2,000 by 2029 is very possible."

"Facebook Recalls 4 Million Oculus Quest 2 Virtual Reality Headset Inserts After Complaints About Skin IrritationFacebook has recalled the foam insert of its popular Oculus Quest 2 virtual reality headset, according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), the federal agency that oversees the safety of most household products. The announcement comes after thousands of complaints from consumers that the headset causes rashes and other skin irritation on the face.Kelly Crothers of San Diego told Consumer Reports that she noticed a problem shortly after buying an Oculus Quest 2 for her son in March. “The irritation is extreme swelling and redness,” she told the company in April, describing her son’s face. “This is pretty ridiculous,” she added.Similar comments have peppered the likes of Facebook, Reddit, and YouTube in recent months following the October 2020 release of the $299 virtual reality headset. These complaints all say roughly the same thing: that using the Quest 2 for even just a few minutes causes redness, swelling, or other irritation.“My eyes are swollen, I have a rash where the headset sits, it’s itchy, and painful,” another user, Mitchell Brown, wrote on Facebook. “It might not be an allergic reaction, but this shouldn’t have happened to anyone.”“What started as a little itch every now and then became intense itching, redness, and now swollen eyes,” said Christine Ann, also on Facebook. “No doubt I am sensitive to some component of it.”The CPSC cited more than 5,700 complaints from consumers regarding skin irritation following the use of the Oculus headsets.William Wallace, manager of safety policy for Consumer Reports, says the company should have acted sooner in the face of the issues flagged by users.“It shouldn’t take more than 5,700 complaints for Facebook or any other company to launch a recall,” he says. “They need to test products thoroughly on the front end to avoid harm, and when something goes wrong, they need to act quickly.”"

"FTC official says Facebook’s actions violated 2019 consent decree, and it failed to notify FTC firstWASHINGTON — A senior Federal Trade Commission official is criticizing Facebook’s move to shut down the personal accounts of two academic researchers and terminate their probe into misinformation spread through political ads on the social network.Facebook wrongly used a 2019 data-privacy settlement with the FTC to justify shutting down the New York University researchers’ accounts this week, Samuel Levine, acting director of the FTC’s consumer protection bureau, said in a letter Thursday to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg,Levine also said Facebook failed to honor a prior commitment to notify the FTC in advance of taking such an action.Facebook maintained that the researchers violated its terms of service and were involved in unauthorized data collection from its massive network. The academics, however, say the company is attempting to exert control on research that paints it in a negative light.The NYU researchers with the Ad Observatory Project had for several years been looking into Facebook’s Ad Library, where searches can be done on advertisements running across Facebook’s products.The access was used to “uncover systemic flaws in the Facebook Ad Library, to identify misinformation in political ads, including many sowing distrust in our election system, and to study Facebook’s apparent amplification of partisan misinformation,” Laura Edelson, the lead researcher behind NYU Cybersecurity for Democracy, said Wednesday.Facebook agreed in a 2019 consent decree settlement with the FTC to pay a record $5 billion for alleged violations of the privacy of users’ personal data.But Levine said in his letter that the consent decree allows Facebook to create exceptions to data collection restrictions “for good-faith research in the public interest.”“While it is not our role to resolve individual disputes between Facebook and third parties, we hope that the company is not invoking privacy — much less the FTC consent order — as a pretext to advance other aims,” the letter says.Facebook’s action against the NYU project also cut off other researchers and journalists who got access to Facebook data through the project, according to Edelson, the NYU lead researcher."
"UK watchdog: Facebook’s Giphy ownership will hurt animated images competitionLONDON (AP) — Facebook‘s ownership of Giphy will hurt competition for animated images, U.K. regulators said Thursday, meaning the social network could ultimately be forced to unwind the deal if the provisional findings are confirmed.The Competition and Markets Authority said its investigation found the acquisition would hurt competition among social media platforms because there’s only one other big provider of GIFs, Google’s Tenor.Giphy’s library of short looping videos, or GIFs, are a popular tool for internet users sending messages or posting on social media.The deal will also reduce digital advertising competition by removing a potential rival from the market, the watchdog said. It started looking into the acquisition last year, shortly after Facebook announced its plan to acquire Giphy in a deal reportedly worth $400 million.The acquisition also faces scrutiny from regulators in Australia and Austria, underlining concerns about how such acquisitions can affect competition in local markets.Prior to the deal, Giphy had been considering expanding its paid advertising services to other countries including the U.K. That would have added a new player to the market and encouraged more innovation from social media sites and advertisers, the CMA said.But Facebook terminated Giphy’s paid advertising partnerships after the deal, it said.“Giphy’s takeover could see Facebook withdrawing GIFs from competing platforms or requiring more user data in order to access them. It also removes a potential challenger to Facebook,” which dominates the U.K.’s 5.5 billion pound ($7.6 billion) display advertising market, inquiry chair Stuart McIntosh said. “None of this would be good news for customers.”McIntosh said the watchdog would now seek feedback on the provisional findings before issuing its final report on Oct. 6.“Should we conclude that the merger is detrimental to the market and social media users, we will take the necessary actions to make sure people are protected,” he said.Facebook is facing increased scrutiny over acquisitions that might have previously escaped notice amid rising concern that the digital giants are amassing greater market power. The CMA and European Union and German regulators are all looking into the company’s plan to buy Kustomer, a customer management platform."

No none is breaking up Facebook. These are nonsensical lawyers who think they know business. The company is wholly intertwined. No chance some Harvard wannabe lawyer who is trying to create buzz for himself is going to mandate FB break up.

"Australia warns Facebook spreading misinformation via WhatsApp amid Sydney lockdownNew South Wales Health has issued a warning about misinformation circulating on WhatsApp that claims Sydney supermarkets will close as part of the ongoing lockdown, with owner Facebook saying it is working to limit the spread of misinformation on its private messaging app.It was reported that a screenshot purporting to be from NSW Health saying that supermarkets would close for four days as part of the Covid-19 response was circulating on WhatsApp.Supermarkets in NSW have remained open during the greater Sydney lockdown and are considered essential retail. In a statement on Friday, the state’s health department urged people not to take advice from anywhere but the official NSW Health channels.“NSW Health is urging people to use trusted and credible sources of information to inform them about the most up-to-date Covid-19 information in NSW,” a spokesperson said.Misinformation being circulated through group chats on WhatsApp has been an ongoing issue throughout the pandemic, not just in Australia but around the world."

"Facebook let fossil-fuel industry push climate misinformation, report findsFacebook failed to enforce its own rules to curb an oil and gas industry misinformation campaign over the climate crisis during last year’s presidential election, according to a new analysis released on Thursday.The report, by the London-based thinktank InfluenceMap, identified an increase in advertising on the social media site by ExxonMobil and other fossil-fuel companies aimed at shaping the political debate about policies to address global heating.InfluenceMap said its research shows the fossil-fuel industry has moved away from outright denying the climate crisis, and is now using social media to promote oil and gas as part of the solution. The report also exposed what it said was Facebook’s role in facilitating the dissemination of false claims about global heating by failing to consistently apply its own policies to stop erroneous advertising.“Despite Facebook’s public support for climate action, it continues to allow its platform to be used to spread fossil-fuel propaganda,” the report said. “Not only is Facebook inadequately enforcing its existing advertising policies, it’s clear that these policies are not keeping pace with the critical need for urgent climate action.”The report found that 25 oil and gas industry organisations spent at least $9.5m to place more than 25,000 ads on Facebook’s US platforms last year, which were viewed more than 431m times. Exxon alone spent $5m.“The industry is using a range of messaging tactics that are far more nuanced than outright statements of climate denial. Some of the most significant tactics found included tying the use of oil and gas to maintaining a high quality of life, promoting fossil gas as green, and publicizing the voluntary actions taken by the industry on climate change,” the report said.The report noted a rise in spending on Facebook ads in July 2020, immediately after then-presidential candidate Joe Biden announced a $2tn climate plan to promote the use of clean energy. The spending remained high until after the election four months later.“This suggests the oil and gas industry uses Facebook advertising strategically and for politically motivated purposes,” the report said.InfluenceMap said it found 6,782 energy industry ads on Facebook last year promoting claims that natural gas is a green or low carbon fuel, even though research by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says otherwise.“These messages are often packaged in adverts promoting the climate-friendliness of oil and gas companies and the necessity of oil and gas for maintaining a high quality of life,” the report said.InfluenceMap also drew attention to the part played by industry-funded groups led by the American Petroleum Institute, which spent $3m on Facebook ads last year portraying fossil-fuel companies as climate-friendly.InfluenceMap said that while Facebook removed some ads for making false claims or failing to include a disclaimer identifying them as about environmental politics, it permitted many others to go unchallenged.“Given Facebook’s long and troubling history with disinformation, it is deeply concerning that Facebook has now determined that climate disinformation is reportedly “immune to fact-checking”, said the senators, including Elizabeth Warren.“The climate crisis is too important to allow blatant lies to spread on social media without consequence.”"

"White House sees YouTube, Facebook as 'Judge, Jury & Executioner' on vaccine misinformationWASHINGTON, July 23 (Reuters) - The White House has YouTube, not just Facebook, on its list of social media platforms officials say are responsible for an alarming spread of misinformation about COVID vaccines and are not doing enough to stop it, sources familiar with the administration's thinking said.The criticism comes just a week after called Facebook and other social media companies ""killers"" for failing to slow the spread of misinformation about vaccines.A senior administration official said one of the key problems is ""inconsistent enforcement."" YouTube - a unit of Alphabet Inc's Google - and Facebook get to decide what qualifies as misinformation on their platforms. But the results have left the White House unhappy.""Facebook and YouTube... are the judge, the jury and the executioner when it comes to what is going on in their platforms,"" an administration official said, describing their approach to COVID misinformation. ""They get to grade their own homework.""Social media companies have come under fire recently from President, his press secretary, Jen Psaki, and Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, who have all said the spread of lies about vaccines is making it harder to fight the pandemic and save lives.A recent report from the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), which has also been highlighted by the White House, showed 12 anti-vaccine accounts are spreading nearly two-thirds of anti-vaccine misinformation online. Six of those accounts are still posting on YouTube.The fight against vaccine misinformation has become a top priority for the White House at a time when the pace of vaccinations has slowed considerably despite the risk posed by the Delta variant, with people in many parts of the country hostile to being vaccinated.The requests to Facebook and YouTube come after the White House reached out to Facebook, Twitter and Google in February about clamping down on COVID misinformation, seeking their help to stop it from going viral, another senior administration official said then.""Facebook is the 800-pound gorilla in the room when it comes to vaccine misinformation... but Google has a lot to answer for and somehow manages to get away with it always because people forget they own YouTube,"" said Imran Ahmed, CCDH founder and chief executive.The senior administration official cited four issues on which the administration has asked Facebook to provide specific data, but the company has been reticent to comply.These include how much vaccine misinformation exists on its platform, who is seeing the inaccurate claims, what the company is doing to reach out to them and how does Facebook know the steps it is taking are working.The White House’s broad concern is that the platforms are ""either lying to us and hiding the ball, or they're not taking it seriously and there isn't a deep analysis of what's going on in their platforms,"" the official said."

"Is it any wonder that California burns EVERY summer? Of course it’s climate change, and has nothing to do with Progressive Culture, which lies to the masses and sets special rules for the “little people,” some of whom glare at the mansions and vineyards of the rich with disdain. And the lying extends to the public, who must know that the little people are not revolting because of jealousy—climate change is the cause. Yet, if you listen to the news in states OTHER THAN IN PROGRESSIVE CA, OR or WA, you can read about the guy caught throwing firebombs out the window of his car in OR, or the Asian woman in a bikini on drugs or the college professor caught starting fires upwind of fire fighters in CA. Of course, this is muffled by the Progressives because THAT is what they do best. The tool of a repressed Progressive is fire—we’ve seen it in our cities and we see it in California. IMO, It’s time to execute arsonists in the town square."

"Not worried about this new FTC complaint. Lina Kahn literally hates big tech. This is like Scott Pruitt when he headed the EPA. I am still betting the FTC won’t win the battle at the end of the day. This lawsuit will take years to reach the end, they were saying possibly until 2023-2024. That gives me 2-3 extra years to watch the money roll in. FB is trading up on the news, so that tells me the smart money isn’t worried. Even in the worst case scenario that FB is broken up, I don’t foresee that meaning the end of FB. Only a moron thinks FB is in serious danger."

"Valueline Aug. 6, 2021: Facebook reported a strong performance for the March quarter, and this pattern likely continued in the June period. The company was set to announce results for the second quarter as this Issue went to press. Daily active users and monthly active users continue to increaseat a good pace. The company is benefiting from the transition in consumer demand toward products and away from services as well as an ongoing shift to online commerce. These changes have been supporting Facebook’s advertising business, given its strength in product verticals soldthrough online commerce. Growth ought to slow in the back half of the year though results should remain solid overall. Moderate gains in active users should continue to benefit results here. Advertising revenue increases should be driven by higher prices. However, performance ought to be affected by ad targeting headwinds resulting from regulatory and platform changes. An evolving European regulatory climate may well also present challenges. Even so, we have increased our estimates for full-year 2021, and now expect that revenues and earnings per share will both rise by morethan 30%.Long-term prospects appear solid, and we envision strong growth from 2022 onward. The company remains well positioned in the social media space. Active users should continue to increase at a good pace. Mobile advertising ought to remain an important performance driverin the near term. Investment in new technologies will likely pay off down the road. That said, political and regulatory challenges remain a concern here.This stock carries wide appeal at this juncture. The shares are ranked to outpace the broader market averages for the coming six to 12 months. We anticipate strong growth in revenues and earnings per share for the company over the pull to mid-decade. From the recent quotation, this equity offers attractive long-term total return potential. Moreover, Facebook earns good marks for Safety, Financial Strength, Price Stability, and Growth Persistence. Subscribers seeking exposure to the social media space ought to take a closer look.Michael Napoli, CFA August 6, 2021Target $1,500 by end of 2024"

"Like I said the day after earnings........Facebook had blowout earnings, and the last thing FB management wanted was having blowout earnings along with a big spike in its share price making headlines.....with ""regulatory"" talk making the rounds in Congress and other countries , facebook will always put out a revenue quidance warning in their earnings CC when they have blowout earnings.

I personally ignore those CC warnings, and buy if the stocks really take a dive ......shares are headed to a breakout !"
