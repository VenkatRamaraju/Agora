"Yesterday, was one of the best in years, intra-day reversal off and oversold condition. Look for this thing to run for 3-5 days towards the falling 50 Day Moving Average (at least).That's over 40 years of charting experience, taught by Bill O'Neil back in the 1980's."
Pete Najarian just took a few minutes talking about buying of FB $325 calls with Nov 6 expitations. Somebody is betting serious $$$ that FB will be in the neighborhood of $330.00 next week.
"""In a desperate move to deflect the company issues, Facebook today announced they officially changed their name to Meta.""LOL....Meta is short for Metamucil. As if the market will forget the fact that their ad revenue is way down, class action lawsuits are everywhere, and there's no catalyst to stop the bleeding in the stock."
Ok folks I have been watching FB for quite a while and finally decided to YOLO in here and NVDA…. I love the rebranding and the vision and the valuation for this world dominating innovative company. Looking forward to many years of surprise upside GLTA
Facebook isn’t responsible for teens social media habits. That’s all on the parents. Every time Facebook is accused of something those who have sold have missed out on big gains. Those that capitalized on the dip have made out handsomely. This time will be no different. $400 in Feb
"Meta—schmeta, a name change isn’t going make anyone forget about the Zucker’s shenanigans. Sounds like this may be preparation for the impending break-up."
"META/FB remains in the extreme trading bargain as the top, TOP value stock in FAANG and the cheapest growth stock in the S&P 500!"
"These are years away....true today you see company with 80% profit margins (ceo investing in new high margin massive digital businesses) trading below historic valuations, with the street forecasting its digital ad business to grow by 50% while you wait on new investment returns. no debt. Just announced 50 BILLION share buy back...... today media hates them because media is losing advertisers every day..... haters try to compare them to tobacco????? wrong!! they don't make tobacco. compare them to the magazines. newspapers. billboards who were paid for tobacco ads. Noone has ever blamed a billboard for causing cancer. Haters are not investors."
BREAKING NEWSFB changed its name to Ron Artest;):)
"If you bought FB everytime it was accused of wrongdoing, you have done great. If you sold FB when it was accused of wrongdoing, you have missed out on great gains. This time won't be any different."
"FB Strong Buy: Increased in Financial Institutions holding to 4,203 F.I., and also increased in percentage of FB shares held by F.I. Since the announcement of $100B Metaverse investment, many F.I. have quietly accumulated lots of FB shares in recent days. FB price will appreciate sharply in the near future"
Today we held above the 200 DMA. No mystery plunge into the close. Volume was high. Follow through on Monday preferably through the 15 DMA at $327 would be a good confirmation. $330 next week? Extremely doable.
Cathie Wood just bought a bunch of Facebook
"With the incredible competitive ‘moat’ enjoyed by Meta the probability is that they will grow their core market share and with it revenues. The danger is that the time and resources invested in the new technology, will distract them from the core business, as my grandmother used to say ‘I need to stick to the knitting if you want your cricket jumper finished’. Knitting a new jumper is risky, not least because VR and AR have not had an overwhelming ‘WOW’ moment reaction across a board consumer base. However, it seems that MZ and Meta have developed this technology differently from what most of us have so far have experienced and their faith in its future is reassuring considering how well they know their markets and tech. I am prepared to back their ideas and parasite my way to success. If they are wrong we will find out relatively quickly, take the pain and regroup. This is a relatively low risk downside investment with an exponential upside."
"Well well well, Miss Cathie Wood starting with a 86,417 share entry into Facebook for the first time in any of her holdings, ARKW next generation Internet ETF. Yep I think the direction Facebook ie Meta is going fits that bill quite nicely. You all understand what that means right? She will continue accumulating over the next several days and weeks. Also I love all the negative chatter and jaded comments on this board, just gives more confidence to buy buy buy. Care to join in?"
$1 Trillion is spent annually on travel..... once you are home it's only a memory.... What would you pay to see the entire world virtually???
"Cathie with another 200K Buy order worth of shares today. I mentioned in my last post that there will be follow-through buying from her initial 84k share purchase, now totaling 90 million dollars worth. Expect more in the coming weeks. Buy this thing on Monday before it really takes off from the severely oversold levels."
"After official announcement of meta watch, this is crossing 400 easy!"
Digital wallet combined with a stable cryto.....will save millions of consumers $$$. No global bank has 2.8 billion customers combined with 200 million busines clients.... not even 1/10....... media repeats negative babble over and over...REALITY......2.8 billion customers and 200 million business clients...says the WORLD LOVES META. Biggest banks world maybe 1/10 the size........META is digital... no bricks and morter costs.... employees could be Avatar..... their banks cost would be much lower than any other bank in the world....with massive scale... What is a bank worth with 100 million customers?? 1 Billion customer??
