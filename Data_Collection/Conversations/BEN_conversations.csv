Anyone alive in BEN’s forum…. Quiet stocks usually make the best stocks but this one is eerily quiet
"I'm out. 50% gain plus dividends over the last year or so. Not bad, although market as a whole gangbusters. I don't think it's a bad play, but AUM still not expanding. Last year with a 5% dividend was a nice play. Coulda put more in ETSY etc though. Good luck longs."
"Many people are seeking for stability in this unstable crypto space and even the stock market, A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now. I'd say it's wrong to just sit back hold and wait maybe incur some losses along the line, that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making profits should be the way of life that being said, the market is still majorly about BTC at the moment and I'll advise current investors and newbies to take advantage of the Mr. Arthur's copy Trading platform, a platform that handles people who lack understanding on how to maneuver the crypto space and stock market, to help them recover loss from the crash and also accumulate more positive returns, with this platform i went from having 1.4btc to 7btc in just 9 weeks. If you are interested in getting started, just send Arthur a message on What*sapp>>>>>>> +447901191306 or Tel**e**gram @ArthurFX47"
I just bought some of this stock because I feel that I needed to diversify my assets some. It is a solid company with a lot of experience and know how. Its dividends are quite good also.
"Bought into this one today. Low debt, plenty of cash on hand, near 52 week low, almost 7% dividend yield. Dont see nothing but upside from here."
"to anyone posting bullish articles , do you own any of BEN’s product-ETF, mutual fund, etc. or stock trading through BEN?"
I'm thinking of buying a couple of shares for the nice dividend. Any opinions on why this may or may not be a good buy?
"Asking this here because the message board on the stock that I am most interested in for this sector is dead - do you think these companies struggling with AUM could see at least a partial reversal in trends by embracing more closed end funds, considering that CEFs are expanding in popularity?"
"Multi year lows and executives filing Form 4's and selling the stock, not a food sign."
"Good company, under valued.Selling below book value and 60% below the pre market sell off in February. Nice dividend over 6% is comparable to high yield bond funds. The valuation that was most telling was Enterprise value/revenues .56. The company is buying Legg Mason an outstanding outfit that contains the Royce funds. Hard to imagine you won't get at least a 25-30% move in the next 6-12 months which along with the dividend makes a fine total return. This could even double. Excellent risk reward opportunity."
Is it good to buy BEN for 1-3 month hold
#ben please research how the process works. The FDA just puts a calendar together. Doesn’t mean they stick to it and if anything was gleaned from the earnings call is that they are in label discussions. Sounds positive but they have some time stil left on the clock to announce approval. Hoping for a slam dunk and possibly buyout shortly after or 3-6 months from now would be outstanding.

"HArd to believe now green, and getting greener, oin tis name. We'll see if it can withstand the earnings release. :)"
"I plan to hold $GS, and I am getting used to the daily volatility. I'm down $3 a share as of today, but Stuff happens. I wonder if anyone here has an opinion about $BEN, which I am considering buying. I can't find anything fundamentally wrong with BEN or GS, but maybe you have. By nature and experience, I prefer boring dividends to rolling the dice on low-odds growth plays."
"$29.97 as I type, getting closer to the JP Morgan price target of $29. All of those BEN executives sold stock just days before report came out, wonder if they knew. Time for another announcement of a stock buy back that will never be completed. Just think how much money has been wasted with those buy backs. I also wonder what the average price was on the buy backs, low to mid $40's?"
"This year my husband (who retired 22 years ago) and I acquired 26,000 shares of BEN. He raised a questionon the company's website on June 17 as to the amount of debt BEN holds directly or for one or more or its funds from Chesapeake Energy--no response. A week prior to that he had asked someone in shareholder relations to send him a copy of BEN's last Annual Report--no response. Is this typical of BEN's response to shareholders?"
What is going on with this stock?
"In 1992 BEN bought out the great Sir John. Templeton was not just a world-class global enterprise, it had a culture that was commensurate with its pedigree. Now? The Johnson family is decent and smart, but they tend to draw on consensus at the expense of those who try to do what is right. I guess good investment performance cures most ills, but operationally the technology infrastructure that was built over the years was extraordinary"
"Same old play book. Buy back of 80 million shares. Stock hits a new 52 week low yesterday and all they can come up with to save the business is buy back more stock even though they were not even close to buying back all the stock from prior announcements. Stock has gone nowhere in 10 years. It would be interesting to know how much they have lost on all those buybacks. Well, at least it means there is a buyer out there which is good with all the selling going on from the Johnsons."
