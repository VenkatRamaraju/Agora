"Here's the problem with ALL the asset manager stocks.......Fidelity Management said they will offer ZERO FEE index funds. So the street thinks that Fidelity announcement puts additional press on the income of all asset managers and also slows their growth of AUM (assets under management). Therefore, Blackrock, Ben, TROW, Invesco are all suffering greatly. I don't know how Fidelity can do that. Maybe higher fees on the rest of their offerings will cover the loss of fees on the Index funds."
"to anyone posting bullish articles , do you own any of BEN’s product-ETF, mutual fund, etc. or stock trading through BEN?"
$BEN Target Raised by Morgan Stanley Underweight USD 22 » USD 24
"I'm out. 50% gain plus dividends over the last year or so. Not bad, although market as a whole gangbusters. I don't think it's a bad play, but AUM still not expanding. Last year with a 5% dividend was a nice play. Coulda put more in ETSY etc though. Good luck longs."

"Why is this dog over $20.00?From the FT Franklin Templeton has been named the world’s worst-selling retail fund manager for 2020 after investors pulled almost $50bn from the US group, marking the latest sign that it is struggling to turn round its fortunes."
"Back to the Covid crash prices from the Spring. Not the absolute lows, but below the post-recovery bottoms. I think that's unwarranted.You could tell from analyst questions they aren't buying what management is selling. AUM still down, and expected to have outflows into the January quarter (end of year selling). And of course the bad quarterly report coincided with market melting down a bit, too.That said, with a bit of earning disappointment, partially driven by costs, but they didn't get much credit for the prior quarter EPS beat.There's some integration cost. And AUM turnaround doesn't happen overnight.Given the diversity now of the business with the bolt-on Legg Mason merger, I think the AUM bleed ultimately slows down. BEN floated up with the rest of the industry with the Eaton Vance buy by Morgan Stanley.BEN still throws off a big dividend, it isn't under threat near term, and at some point i think the shrinkage stops. I know everyone says mutual fund dinosaur but I don't see this as an ice cube that'll completely melt away. They ares today but making enough of the right moves now finally. But it'll likely be a few quarters out before the turn becomes apparent."

Does anyone know what’s the date for December dividend?Thanks!
Is it good to buy BEN for 1-3 month hold

"damn, down to bottom of GR price, with an even lower P/E. I'm tempted to get a few shares, but negative earnings and revenue for the last 5 years?....."
BEN reached a new 52 Week Low at $29.27
BEN - going up 20% by the end of this month. WATCH. My mom tells me I am smart every day.
"Started positions in BEN last week, Friday 8/28/20, at $21.18. Both in IRA and a reular account. Mostly as a dividend play, but it seems awfully cheap as well. People have been moving away to passive accounts for a while, and growth stocks are go-go right now. And I have some of those as well (CRWD, PINS, ETSY etc). But I think hey, SOMEONE has to pick stocks for there even to be a passive index. Buying Legg Mason adds scale. And I think there'll be a move to value when this liquidity fed move dies out some. Some of my plays in that mode have been SIMO, BMY, MMM and BEN. Plus NOBL and IQDF (hey, I like passive ETFs too)."
Franklin Resources is down 7.50% to 17.39

This stock has now dropped by over 20%. Anyone have any idea what the reason for this is?
Michael Price added shares of BEN in his 12-20 reporting.
"Time for me to get out of BEN, now a faded blue chip. Management can't figure out how to increase the AUM. Change is needed at the top, not some silly corporate social responsibility report."
"Look at all the free stock being doled out today on the Form 4's, disgusting considering what has happened to this stock over the last 10 years, ""certain performance criteria...were achieved"" UFB!"
BEN is down 4.91% to 22.27
"WOW. go look at a 5 year graph of BEN. the markets have been up, yet Ben is down down down... s.m.h."
"Boost up the dividend to 0.28, ben doing better after acquisition just need to minimize the administrative fees."
Cheap but dividend is too small in spite of margin. FCF is also low

Why has BEN's stock performance been quite awful compared to other asset managers this past year?I sold all my BEN last March @ 42ish.Sold some TROW 12/16 @ 78ish and some 4/17 @ 73ish.Price Check:BEN 45.29TROW 117.28Quite the divergence.

Thank you Mr Market. Established 1/3 position at 20.19 and will nibble in the high teens if available. Ten year money with a nice dividend.
BEN is one of my favorite dividend growth stocks. I talk about dividend growth stocks on my youtube channel. The channel is really focused on new and beginner investors looking to invest in dividend growth stocks and ETFs. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrg6IDPf4a7pUKTN90n6syg

This is a raciest company!!! I can not believe people supporting Franklin Resources!!
"BEN was moving up with some value stocks until the market sold off and value went down with others, but now the growth stocks have bounced back some (off yesterday's bottom stucff like crowdstrike and zoom bounced hard and ended well into green) while value really didn't. A little headfake leader rotation then right back to the summer trade.BEN really needs to show increase AUM and arrest of outflow."

Buy out coming!
"Earnings ok this morning (2/2/21), and rising equity prices increased AUM, but net outflows still $10 billion or so. They bought back over $40 million (IIRC) at a price around $21, so not bad. Returning money with that a dividend. Would love to see fund flow stabilize."
Franklin Resources is up 5.18% to 33.70

"This year my husband (who retired 22 years ago) and I acquired 26,000 shares of BEN. He raised a questionon the company's website on June 17 as to the amount of debt BEN holds directly or for one or more or its funds from Chesapeake Energy--no response. A week prior to that he had asked someone in shareholder relations to send him a copy of BEN's last Annual Report--no response. Is this typical of BEN's response to shareholders?"

"$25.60ish last Wed morning. $25.30ish a week later. The market has ""shrugged"" at the acquisitiononce it was digested. Not a ringing endorsement."
"Good company, under valued.Selling below book value and 60% below the pre market sell off in February. Nice dividend over 6% is comparable to high yield bond funds. The valuation that was most telling was Enterprise value/revenues .56. The company is buying Legg Mason an outstanding outfit that contains the Royce funds. Hard to imagine you won't get at least a 25-30% move in the next 6-12 months which along with the dividend makes a fine total return. This could even double. Excellent risk reward opportunity."
Looking to invest some tax refund money into a solid dividend paying stock. Looking at BEN and would appreciate any advice from current shareholders. Thank you!
"I'm OUT!Sold all my shares this AM @42.59; been long since 5/03.I'm not as sanguine re money managers, as I was in 2003...."
BIOA going up
any clue what their holdings or strategies are?
BEN is down 13.03% to 15.75
Assets under management down another $8.6 Billion even with the market roaring up since election day. Nice to see all the Form 4s today awarding themselves more stock even though they pay themselves millions. The common has had a very nice run since the election but is still down from 10 years ago.

"In 1992 BEN bought out the great Sir John. Templeton was not just a world-class global enterprise, it had a culture that was commensurate with its pedigree. Now? The Johnson family is decent and smart, but they tend to draw on consensus at the expense of those who try to do what is right. I guess good investment performance cures most ills, but operationally the technology infrastructure that was built over the years was extraordinary"
Hey Any Suggestions on BEN hold?
Franklin Resources reached a 52 Week high at 28.06
"$29.97 as I type, getting closer to the JP Morgan price target of $29. All of those BEN executives sold stock just days before report came out, wonder if they knew. Time for another announcement of a stock buy back that will never be completed. Just think how much money has been wasted with those buy backs. I also wonder what the average price was on the buy backs, low to mid $40's?"

"Asking this here because the message board on the stock that I am most interested in for this sector is dead - do you think these companies struggling with AUM could see at least a partial reversal in trends by embracing more closed end funds, considering that CEFs are expanding in popularity?"

"Same old play book. Buy back of 80 million shares. Stock hits a new 52 week low yesterday and all they can come up with to save the business is buy back more stock even though they were not even close to buying back all the stock from prior announcements. Stock has gone nowhere in 10 years. It would be interesting to know how much they have lost on all those buybacks. Well, at least it means there is a buyer out there which is good with all the selling going on from the Johnsons."
BEN reached a new 52 Week Low at 37.67
why is $BEN up that 10% today?
I will no longer own BEN stock. Franklin Templeton is going after the public pensions of citizen wage earners.I hope that public pension funds and especially CalPers will no longer invest in Franklin Templeton stock or funds. Boycotting the Beast is the only way to influence Franklin Templeton's predatory capitalism which is at war with American Labor.

I wonder if anyone here has an opinion about $BEN, which I am considering buying. I can't find anything fundamentally wrong with BEN or GS, but maybe you have. By nature and experience, I prefer boring dividends to rolling the dice on low-odds growth plays."

"This company has too many overpaid management people who harm the company with their behaviour and arrogance on the ground. Most operating employee treated bad from what I ve been told. Management takes millions in compensation for self and those who made the company the real employees earn like cleaners - this company is just a fake shine and brings money for investment to countries like ucraina and Argentina who will never return the money! While a few years back IVZ was at AUM near 400 Billion, Ben was at over 750 Billions. Now Ben is at 700+ n IVZ above 900 Billion!"

"I want to buy too, but I’m concerned that many old mutual fund companies like BEN, are facing headwinds from the ETF trend. Some are converting their funds to ETF’s."
I just bought some of this stock because I feel that I needed to diversify my assets some. It is a solid company with a lot of experience and know how. Its dividends are quite good also.

#ben please research how the process works. The FDA just puts a calendar together. Doesn’t mean they stick to it and if anything was gleaned from the earnings call is that they are in label discussions. Sounds positive but they have some time stil left on the clock to announce approval. Hoping for a slam dunk and possibly buyout shortly after or 3-6 months from now would be outstanding.
