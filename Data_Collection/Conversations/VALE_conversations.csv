28 percent already up baby!!!!
No one pulls more Nickel out of the ground then VALE
Especially if you have profits.
Unless you think Iron ore prices are going to crash this is a steal
12+ would be huge...
the production report comes out Friday before open and will include sales data. looks like the share price is gearing up for it
Any Dividend news ?
This should be 3x what it is
FCX Forward PE 29 ?? Less than 1% Div . If Vale PE were 29 it would be trading at $146.00 a share and still be a better buy than FCX
This stock doesn’t want to go down. All other miners down again today except VALE. Bodes well. GLTA.
"(Bloomberg) -- Brazil’s mining authorities have started a probe into Vale SA over a possible cover-up regarding safety procedures that could lead to a fine of up to 20 percent of its 2018 gross revenue.The country’s mining secretary, Alexandre Vidigal de Oliveira, said in an interview that he requested an investigation into whether the company colluded with auditors to mislead authorities over the risk assessment of the mining rejects dam that collapsed near Brumadinho in the state of Minas Gerais. If convicted under Brazil’s anti-corruption law, the maximum penalty could be around 25 billion reais ($6.6 billion) based on estimates of preliminary 2018 data. By contrast, the mining code sets a 3,000 reais limit for fines.Vale’s net revenue was 127 billion reais in the 12 months through September 2018."
The nickel powder we produce in ontario is number one for the batterys and none has been produced since the workers walked off may 31 you will definitely see a drop in the quarter earnings

""We’re here to re-privatize Vale.""State-development bank BNDES intends to sell Vale shares but has yet to find a good moment to do so, Mattar said.Vale’s shares, which had lost 28% in the aftermath of last month's deadly tailings dam break, have ticked higher following the remarks."
18 1/4- 18 1/2 below this I believe we will have a wait...... Just my research..... any reasonable responses !!!
Seems to me there has been some negative press that could have caused stock to go down. However stock hasn’t gone down and is a hair away from a new high . Hmmmm.
Another special payment to shareholders in Sept? Think so?
RIO who is competitor is down 2.5%. So this is down 7% because of strike. Which will be resolved. Buy!
$18 good entry point . Then really really undervalued .
"Vale finalizes $7B settlement over Brazil dam breakFeb. 04, 2021 10:32 AM • Vale confirms it reached agreement with Minas Gerais officials to pay 37.7B reais ($7.03B) in compensation to the Brazilian state where the collapse of its mining dam two years ago killed 270 people. • Vale shares are lower today after rising 3% yesterday as reports indicated a settlement was imminent. • The court settlement is the biggest in Brazilian history but does not affect several pending homicide and environmental charges in the case. • The deal comes near the two-year anniversary of the Brumadinho disaster, giving affected communities a framework for compensation and reparations and removing a legal overhang for Vale shareholders. • Vale just released iron ore production figures that missed expectations, including a nearly 5% Q/Q decline."
You are all SIMPS. If you haven’t listened to Elon say they NEED nickel like yesterday then you would know the demand is higher than any other metal right now.

"RBC Lowers Vale Price Target After 'Enormous Tragedy' In Brazil, Anticipates $10B Liability2:56 pm ET February 4, 2019 (Benzinga) PrintBrazilian mine operator Vale SA (NYSE: VALE) dominated news headlines after one of its dams in the town of Brumadinho burst, killing dozens of people, with hundreds still missing. The fallout could weigh on investor sentiment and the stock, according to RBC Capital Markets. The Analyst Analyst Tyler Broda maintained an Underperform rating on Vale with a price target lowered from $11 to $9.The Thesis Vale's dam disaster is an ""enormous tragedy, and a near-unthinkable one,"" and it remains unclear what led to the failure, Broda said in a Monday note. The company did receive declarations attesting to the physical condition of the dam from a geotechnical firm in late 2018, and the company itself inspected the dam in late January, the analyst said. Vale's public response has been a ""positive one,"" as management is cooperating with investigations, Broda said. While this marks a notable improvement from the company's 2015 Samarco disaster, the public outcry is ""full of outrage and anger,"" including courts freezing around $3 billion of Vale's funds, he said. Looking forward, the financial impact is difficult to quantify, although Vale will likely pay for all damages, the analyst saidIf Vale is found to be in some way responsible for the disaster, the financial impact will exceed any recent fines, Broda said, adding that a base case estimate suggests Vale will pay $10 billion in penalties. Price Action Vale shares were trading down 4.1 percent to $12.06 at the time of publication Monday."
Will Vale get out of this Valley. Not walking . Probably need a Super Cycle.
sell 16
Vale is down 4.92% to 21.75
Any news causing the drop ?
Iron Ore spot price at $221. Almost back to new highs. So much for China.
With the settlement in the rear-view mirror we will be looking at $20 pretty soon. At a guess I would say early April. I'm up nicely since my buy in Oct. and I will be holding for a long time.
The only good news so far is that the big drop is on low volume. very concerned about a repeat performance.
Only dropped $0.16 on ex dividend date even though dividends were about $0.44. Looks like demand for Vale shares is strong. I think the next leg up to $30 will start on Friday.
What can move this stock higher next couple months. Nothing .
Good news for Vale the strike is over 2500 back to work.
Very good news coming by the end the day tomorrow .
Infrastructure packages and ev is where it’s at.
"This report is outstanding in my opinion. Net debt was reduced to US$ 11.5 billion in 2Q18, supported by the highest second quarter free cash flow in 10 years, amounting to US$ 3.1 billion in 2Q18. Net debt has been reduced by almost US$ 11 billion over the last 12 months. They have announced a share buyback of $1B USD over the next 12 months. Absolutely awesome report! I’m still reading but from what I read so far this is what us long’s have been waiting for for many years. Congrats to the leadership over at Vale for an outstanding quarter."

By the end of October iron ore will be below 100. Where will Vale be ? Any guesses ? Can still get to 25 at them prices ?
"in 2016 vale's break even price for iron ore was 43 dollars a tonne. today it is $39 dollars a tonne. that means that anything that vale gets above $39 a tonne goes into their pockets. even at $80 dollars a tonne vale is cleaning up. at the current price of $165 dollars a tonne they are REALLY cleaning up!!!!!!!!! vale has 7.2 billion proven iron ore reserves. at $80/tonne sale price-40 lifting costs=$40 profit per tonne. 7.2 billion tonnes/5 billion shares outstanding=1.44 tonnes/share of vale stock x $40 profit=$57.6/share.at 7.2 billion tonnes with no further capex to find new ore at a rate of 400 million tonnes produced per year vale has about 18 years of iron ore. other iron producers have similar reserves and as ore is mined out price will go up as supply of high grade ore is used up. the $57 dollar a share value of vales iron assets completely ignores other mineral contributors such as gold, nickel, copper and several others. nickel makes up about 12% of vales mineral reserves and will play an increasingly important role to earnings. by my tally this is the most undervalued stock on the market."

Looks like $1.49 EPS in 2Q21 according to Vale's investor site. Around what was expected
A stock that is trading at half book value and a forward P/E of 6 should go up 50-100% especially as world demand heats up.
Why the resistance at 23?
But then you have Brazils rivers drying up. Big increase in transportation costs. Lots of uncertainty which the market hates
What is the ex-div date?
If I had a dollar for every time the words dividend and undervalued appeared on this post I’d be rich . Enough already.
"If you think it is a good buy at $11.20 with the uncertainty of the cost of this disaster in claims and future increased costs relating to the upgrading of their handling of tailings then I would ask you, what do you think is the upside price per share? If you think $18 by end of 2019 is that enough potential gain to assume the risk of a further cratering and future crippling operational costs? I won't consider the stock again above $9.00 per share."
Vale and NIO are the only safe chinese companies to own (because they dont need China)
Its iron ore deposit has the capacity to supply the entire planet Earth for the next 500 years! Vale is a very profitable company and the book value per share is 40. The price is less than 25... So it is undervalued. Vale is a Brazilian company. I live in Brazil and I know it is a wonderful company to invest in.
Dividend showed up today in my IRA. They didn't subtract the foreign tax or ADR fee - HAPPY!
Should stop paying so much in dividends and start paying off debt. Times aren’t always good in business. See it changing here already.
need to break this $23 resistance anyhow.

"it is not clear why china cut back on its ore shipments but one theory suggests that beijing has been concerened about carbon emissions and has even imposed quotas on its own internal operations which it has been trying to ramp up as the world emerges from the post coronavirus environment. it is important to note that the quality of iron ore facilitates 1. the grade of steel that can be made with it 2. the cost of making that steel and 3. the amount of carbon emissions needed to make it. of the largest producers we have:1. vale 67% pure(source= vales website)2. bhp 62% pure (source= mining news)3. rio tinto 56-62% pure (cant remember where i saw this....hard to find data on rio tinto on this topic)thus as a rule higher grade ore commands a higher price. as a rule of thumb i would say that for every +5% purity the ore would sell for an additional 20% premium. treflis says that vale's average price per tonne has traditionally been $107 but may go to $127 this year. from what i can see their average price per tonne should be even better than $127. the price got up to over $200 but dropped to $172 after the chinese threatened cutbacks. china is by far the largest importer of iron ore and tradionally australia has enjoyed an advantage in terms of shipping costs(i would assume) because of its closer proximity to china. if, however the chinese are becoming more environmentally concerned it could well move vale to the front of their line and rio tinto to the back."

"Sorry folks, it probably fell because I bought shares, everything falls after I buy!"
What am I missing here? the financial ratios are the lowest I've seen for such a big company.
"in my last post i demonstrated the correlation between vale stock and the price of iron ore. in this post i will attempt to determine the mid term and long term direction of iron ore price. first of all we put forward the fundamental axiom of economics which states that price is determined by supply and demand. the supply side of the equation is pretty well defined as the big iron ore producers give guidance on production several years out in their quarterly presentations.So lets talk about the variable in this equation that is hardest to predict: demand. demand. iron ore for 2020 was about 2.19 billion tonnes growing at a fairly constant rate of about 3-5% yearly. of this 2.19 billion tonnes china alone consumed 1.17 billion tonnes, or slightly more than half of the entire world supply @ a growth in iron ore consumption of 9.5%, well over the world average increase.it poses the question why do the chinese consume so much more iron ore than the rest of the world? indeed they are third in total economic output behind the US(22T) and EU(15.3T) China(14.5T). Well the answer is recycling. the EU recycles over 50% of used scrap iron, the US recycles 47% of used scrap while china recycles less than 10%. china is a superpower that is racing to catch up in some things. china is actually buying scrap iron from other countries and stockpiling it and have announced a 5 year plan to recycle 23% of domestic scrap in 5 years. when they do that it will, all other things being held equal, dramatically reduce the price of iron ore, and thus unfortunately the price of vale stock. still 5 years is a ways off.now for the good news. out of the 2.19 billion tonnes of world ore consumed 12% of that ore is used in automobiles of which about 76 million are produced worldwide. the average car is 60-65% steel by weight and it takes 1.6 tonnes of iron ore to make 1 tonne of steel. consider that the growth rate of gas driven vehicles has averaged -1% over the last 10 years while the average growth of EVs is 50%. consider that the US bureau of statistics estimate that 20% of all cars on the road will be EVs by the year 2030 and 58% will be EVs by the year 2040. consider further that there are 1.4 billion cars in the world now. that means that 1400 million x .2 new EVs will be produced over the next 10 years or 280 million. that means that 280 million x .625(the % of steel in a car) x1.6 units of iron to produce that steel x the average ev weighs about 2 tons=56 million additional tonnes of iron ore will be needed yearly over and about the 3.5-5% world iron ore growth rate i mentioned which would cause the growth rate of iron ore demand to increase by about 3% based on that one thing alone. 3% increase in iron ore use may not sound like much but it will have a dramatic effect on price to the upside. now lets look at profit margins and how iron ore prices affect them. i will use the Tesla model 3 as an example since i understand its financial dynamics best. a model 3 sells for about 40k and costs about 28k to make. that gives you gross margins of about 43%, that means that for every dollar of sales 43 cents go back to the producer in profit. now of that $28,000 cost how much of it is from buying iron ore? well we said that 65% of a car was steel by weight and a car weighed 2 tons that would be , shall we say, $150/tonne x 2 tons=$300 in raw materials for the iron to make the car....that is about 10% of 1% of the entire cost of making the car. suppose you raise the price of iron ore to $600 it would still only be about 1/5th of 1% of the cost of the car. so is the buy of the goods(the iron ore), in this case going to miss the opportunity to make $12,000 on a tesla model 3 because he is so cheap he wont pay a few $100 in increased iron ore prices? what do you think?in summary i conclude that there are 2 massive forces at work here with respect to the short, intermediate and long term price of iron ore. on the negative side we have chinas ability to increase its scrap iron recycling capacity. based on its own projections that will have little or no short term effect, moderate to significant intermediate effect and probably a very great effect as the EV market becomes saturated which will take more than 20 years by most projections. thus if ev sales ramp up faster than chinas ability to build a recycling network then vale goes up in the intermediate term with iron ore price and other strategic metals such as mangenese(used for steel making and nickel(for NCM batteries, the 4680 battery). on the other hand if EV sales sputter and china ramps up recycle faster than anticipated iron producers stock(vale) will suffer. imho ev sales will win this race but no way to be sure."

"Flavio (CEO) said he sees the current quarter to be in line with what we just saw for the the fourth. He also believes the demand for iron ore will continue and that Vale is very comfortable with the price remaining in the $60-$70 range. From my perspective a very good quarter. Yes, there were some higher costs and of course currency issues (Vale has no control over that), but there was plenty to like here. Just the debt reduction alone was very positive. Now, as shareholders we should be hearing some good news on the future dividend policy come the end of March, that's when the Board decides."

Nickel and lithium will be the most in need items in the entire world. This will be at $100 plus next year easy
I bought into this stock thinking it’s a great shelter in possibly stormy waters ahead and I’ve been seeing a lot I find needlessly alarming. A company this big and profitable should have above average safety and above average employee relations. It might cost a billion dollars in cash or two or three but the share price will go up far more than that if these issues are resolved.
"TL;DR VALE I a producer of COBALT, which Musk stated (in an interview following Battery Day), was actually the mineral who's scarcity was the limiting factor in the production of EV batteries (that while a shortage of Lithium was expected, the Cobalt shortage would have the greatest impact). Producers of Cobalt are just as few as producers of Lithium, qnd as this fact becomes abundant, it will drive hype pushing prices of producers 10X that of the Lithium producer price boom. AND if research continues and the price of mass production gets a little cheaper, then NMC batteries will be the standard, and we will see both Nickel and Cobalt demand and prices skyrocket. But Cobalt will be the scarce resource and will command an intense premium. VALE IS WELL POSITIONED FOR THE BATTERY MARKET.Everyone is mentioning nickel as Vale's top ""product,"" but it's Cobalt. Elon Musk actually said that Cobalt is the limiting factor in battery production. While nickel is used in older, less expensive battery cells, particularly Nickel-Cadmium & Nickel Metal Hydride batteries (""NiCads"" & ""NiMH; which were/are commonly used in relatively low-power consuming digital cameras for their relative lightweight compared to traditional, non-rechargable Alkaline or the very low energy density ZnC & ZnCl). Nickel will be important, as the EV market begins to move into the developing markets with specialized lightweight vehicles and the ultra-economy consumer vehicles, so the investment in Nickel R&D will be a long run return still. But the energy density, maximum output power, recharge speed, and battery lifespan of Lithium based batteries is (aside from experimental and currently disproportionately expensive solid state battery technology cells) is far superior to any batteries that use Nickel as the cathode, particularly for applications such as EVs. The most common Lithium batteries all use Cobalt: Lithium Cobalt Oxide batteries are used in most smartphones, but can be flammable, so other ionic salts utilizing Cobalt are also used, such as Lithium Iron Cobalt... and lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide, which is some of the most promising new affordable battery cell tech. Since Cobalt had previously only been used in so-called ""super-alloys"", which had applications in very specialized sectors such as jet engines, dental implants and high tensile titanium. For this reason, not many producers already exist. But Cobalt containing Lithium batteries are creating and are poised to create a demand which the world has never seen. That will be the limiting factor which will cause the impending battery shortage.While Musk stressed the importance Lithium in the impending battery shortage, he later stated in an interview that it was actually COBALT that would be the limiting factor in production.So it is likely that Nickel will soon have a use in the battery industry, but be a far less profitable resource, especially considering the abundance of Nickel that can be reclaimed already in circulation (I mean that figuratively, not talking about the coins), while Cobalt is an already scarce resource. While it hasn't been brought to light yet, the demand for Cobalt in the relatively recent future will greatly surpass that of Lithium, and the hype and price boost surrounding all producers of the metal will be ten times that of the Lithium spike after battery day!"

"12/7/2020 0340 GMT - Jefferies reckons Vale will be the biggest beneficiary from the latest boom in iron-ore prices, winning the ""value versus volumes sweepstakes."" Iron-ore miners have spent recent years trying to balance the two after big, costly expansions boosted output but also caused a sharp downturn in prices. Now, the commodity is at an almost eight- year high and miners are expected to generate big profits and log big capital returns, Jefferies says. ""Vale is best positioned, in our view,"" the bank says of the Brazilian miner. Vale's stock is trading at a weaker earnings ratio to rivals BHP and Rio Tinto, it says"
I have a question regarding Vale's logistics operation. Vale has a fleet of vessels (e.g. Valemax) for shipping iron ore and other metals across the oceans. They were mainly constructed in China and South Korea. Are these ships partly owned by other companies as well?
"• Vale (NYSE:VALE) reports Q4 iron ore production fell 4.7% Q/Q but rose 7.9% Y/Y to 84.5M metric tons, as rainy weather and restrictions on waste disposal at some mines slowed operations. • Q4 production of iron ore pellets slid 17% Q/Q and 24% Y/Y to 7.1M metric tons, hurt by reduced availability of feed from the company's Brucutu and Itabira mines and maintenance at one of its pellet plants. • But Q4 iron ore sales jumped 26% Q/Q and 6.3% Y/Y to 82.8M mt, while pellet sales edged up 0.3% from the previous quarter but fell 22% Y/Y to 8.5M mt."
"If we can close around $15.40 or so on a dividend adjusted basis, we'll be near an 8-year high and going higher on Asian demand and stimulus."
buy the dip?
It is ironic that this board is so quiet when Vale is five years high. Who is still sticking around and have been through two dam bursts? Where is GolfShoes and others?Haven't sold any share since 2015 here.
What time do they usually post results?
"@MT....you'll love the irony...not yet ready to call it a generational stock just yet, but I've owned for awhile and bought more last week and this morning - #MT-....just on their investment in form energy...form energy- google that one. Also backs up logic to owning #BHP, #RIO and #VALE."
Vale way undervalued ! Should be trading in the 30 range
"VALE is benefitting from commodities (more precisely, base metals) run up. Another way of looking at it, its just the loss of purchasing power of the U.S. Dollar due to exploding borrowing/printing by the U.S. government. Another ""inflation hedge"" I own is RIO. Also big in iron, and the other base metals. Since my aim is to ""take advantage"" (or at a minimum, defend against) the imminent decline in the purchasing power of the USD (and for that matter all the other currencies that are linked to it), I find base metals to be the best. Iron, copper, nickel, and zinc are all required for survival day to day in the modern industrial world. So is food, but it can go up and down a lot due to other factors (weather, disease, government farmer subsidy policy). And precious metals (gold, silver) are also affected a lot by ""investor sentiment"" and central bank (gov.) policies. As far as I know, the (corrupt) politicians leave their hands off iron, copper, nickel, and zinc, at least in the democratic countries (of course, in China/Russia EVERYTHING is 100% state controlled).So between RIO (Australia/UK) and VALE (Brazil) I feel diversified in the base metals. I also own several oil companies. The key is not to own ""fantasy"" stocks (Which most popular or tech stocks have become). All I can do is own base metals, and watch the politicians destroy the U.S. economy and the U.S. dollar. Anyone have other interesting ideas around this theme?"
"Thoughts on VALE - with no love or hate.The first thing we have to have in mind is that - as it happened here in the US with big tobacco in late 90s - VALE is a central engine in public revenue to states, cities and Federal Government. Companies in that category are almost ""state run"", they just dont know it or pretend that they are not. Add to that the fact that the brazilian economy depends heavily of the inflow of dollars that VALE produces every single day and you have a perfect case for your institutional/governmental landscape risk anaysis. There is a intense alignment between the treasury and VALE.Get a grip: the Brazilian recurrent deficit annually is in the league of the US$30 billlion. And VALE would have a HUGE impact if they're results got hammered. They pay two types of taxations in Brazil: royalties - a consistent stream of revenue based on the natural resources they explore - and they pay revenue taxes and corporate profit taxes. They also pay environmental fees that keep most of the regulators in the sector up and running.This is a liberal - conservative in US political terms - government. They are not going to interfere with the company, at least not in bright day light. If the executives fail in dealing with the social and political agenda in regards to the accident, maybe, they will put some heat on the board and Bradesco/Mitsui to make a change.But, Schvartsman, differently from the CEO at the time at Samarco, did his home work really well: a) went to Brasilia, showed a consistent plan to eliminate all wet damms; b) they will start settlement pays right now; c) they will offer sources of financial support for the need in conjunctionn with the settlement; d) they will not return money to the shareholders in the near/short term, either through buybacks or dividends; and e) they postponed the results of the last quarter to march, when the overall sentiment of the accident will be less afected by the emotions that such an accident bring to all of us.In terms of revenue: they met with their custommers, not a single one made mentions of reviews contract outputs. So there is faith in the capacity of the company to perform and manage its risk to keep operating at high level.The ore landscape: sorry, they produce 40% of the earths iron ore. You can cry, scream, but they are by far, the most relevant player in the sector by far.Balance Sheet: where's the debt? Differently than most of their competitors the level of leverage is the lowest in the sector, all thanks to Schvartsman. Operational/Disaster Risk: if they really go for the kill and decommission all the wet damms, the environmental risk/operational risk that they face every day will be consistently mitigated. SD11 and the mines in Para, do not use that technology anymore and are the assets that are responsible for the major production of the company now and in the future - more and more.China: if you dont believe that the China economy will keep growing in a steady/but surelly rate, you should not buy VALE, but also you should buy any company in the US as well, since the billions of chinese that are more and more eager to consume, live in new houses and with still a tremendous demand for infrastructure are still thirsty.What can go wrong: decommission is not a simple process - as we saw last week. So they have to be really careful in order to avoid new disasters like this. Also, there is a lot of cities that are already desperate with the possibility of those mines being closed and the political agenda may turn out to impact them twice: 1) making it hard to decommision; 2) asking for money comp for the municipalities and state for the revenue impact - this is Brazil, the government can do things like that....So, with all that in mind, my game plan since the disaster was:1- I shorted the stock monday using puts;2- When I saw that the CEO was in Brazilian, went long;3 - With the US-China talks, kept long;4 - Today, I am keeping long;5 - With a free mind to change my strategy if the landscape changes."

"I am wondering if Vale is worth the gamble of trading for a profit. A few months ago, Vale was above $15 a share. I thought about selling for a profit. I hesitated and “V” went back down to the mid “13”s. Today we are looking at breaking $16 for the first time in years and the worrier in me is starting to think again. I know that CFRA thinks that “V” can reach $18 within 12 months. What do you folks think."
"Kinda quiet on Vale for past few days which is nothing new---price above $12 and appears to be closing for a new 52 week high by year end-----IO prices continue to be stable and much higher than GS-BSS projected and new leadership appears focused to make changes happen! With the current price of IO and solid earnings it is likely a great year to pay down a big chunk of debt in 2018 and move to higher dividends. It would not surprise me if they looked at some % formula based on FCF net of payments, reserve and expenses to expand S11D and cut back on other mine production while getting litigation behind them on dam break. March will be interesting to see the plan open up and all I can say is Santa--I really have been good!"
Never trust Brazilian Companies. there is too much fraud and investigations that go along with these. I have taken a beating in the past on another beauty called PBR (Petrobras). Endless investigations and government frauds made me throw in the towel . there are much better players like FCX and BHP that are much better managed.
"Yep, VALE should be making big bucks even though iron ore prices have significantly retreated from their highs, but the overhang of much more than a hundred billion R$s (5.3/1 vs US$) in fairly likely court ordered liability payments (State and Fed actions) is a real buzz killer."
Nancy Pelosi’s refusal to take up the infrastructure which amazingly passed the Senate unless she gets everything else she wants is hurting us. She could unravel the whole deal. Usually I think she’s shrewd but I think this is going too far. It’s being too greedy in my opinion.
Steady up... Vale will double this year.
"Spot copper, iron ore, nickel prices - ALL THREE - higher today, and with China news, likely going much higher."
"Brazil exported 33.68MT of iron ore in June, a 9-month high"
"China Baowu Group, the world’s top steelmaker, on Thursday (Jun 24) said it would join forces with Vale and Shandong Xinhai Technology to make stainless steel raw material nickel pig iron (NPI) in Indonesia."
people says that market is overvalued and we have Vale with ev/ebitda of x2.8 + look at the free cash flow of it too
"First time in a while VALE doesn’t sustain its opening gains, how does it go up 2% and fully retreat, people cashing out already?"
In at 20.94
don t understand why is down..just sold my MP and went all in on VALE ...financials are now a screaming buy
Does anyone have an opinion as to the above average # of shares and the quick down and pop right back? Maybe just the strike ending? Thanks in advance
We just got an upgrade from 19$ to 23$ target from RBC Capital. Little does everyone know that this will be above 30$ maybe even 50$. My humble opinion of course.
Just amazing how much this stock is undervalued. In the history of the market I never saw a stock so undervalued. Don’t understand how everyone is missing this great buying opportunity. So many dumb people. Should have been buying since 23 when everyone was talking undervalued.
#$%$ in the red lol
Anyone know when the ex-div date for the September dividend?
"Remember Vale is a very powerful company with a lot of leverage all around them , not worried at all."
Nice! 43 cents extra divi to be paid July 8th!
"The reduced import of iron ore in China will be from Australia, the amount from Brazil will be unchanged or more"
Any reasons for the drop?
"If VALE pays $1 a year in dividends, and the share price is just $12, that implied a yield of 8% which is very high. I'm starting to think that the reason it is so under priced is that most commonly data sources don't know about VALE's dividends (because of the temporary freeze since last year?).When the databases show 8% yield, buyers will bid this up. Should be over $20/share."
Anyone knows the next dividents date.
RIO announced a $5.61 dividend along with their earnings. Expect VALE to announce something similar tonight. Maybe $1.50 ?
"Isn't it great when the CFO goes, ""We have too much money"" and distributes special dividend bonuses to shareholders?"
How's that 'dividend run' looking now Birnn?
Volume is going crazy here we go $22 incoming
Imagine where this will be when the absurd amount of shorts have to cover
now wait for 18.2x and BUY if you really want or wait for further sell-off to 16(s) -
"One share of Vale is about the same #$%$ pounds of copper. Yet 1 share gives you $1.50 in dividend a year, do yourself a favor and buy Vale."
Should pay down debt with cash . Not so much in dividends.
I am bullish on the company but it's hard to own shares in a company when it does stuff like this to it'semployees.....Company pays out almost 5 billion dollars in dividends in the 1st quarter of 2021 now trying to take away health benefits from employees! ..stay strong Sudbury
sell sell sell Brazil I have too deth
this stock has levered free cash flow of 95 billion and a market value of 101 billion? 95 billion debt but 70 billion cash? ebitda twice that of debt? the market has a very glass half empty view of this stock. they like tim cook and apple and frown on companies that need to get REAL WORK done. if nickel is as important to the EV future as elon musk thinks it will be vale is worth $40 easily. every day of no more mining mishaps or dam failures brings vale closer to a higher bond rating than the BBB it has now. if it wasnt for social paranoia and a more stable government vale would have a AA bond rating.
"Does anyone know when, if, and how much of a dividend will be paid at end of this year? I can't find a mention of one. Thanks in advance."
Mark it $23 EOW
Vale earnings to be released after market close tomorrow (Tuesday 2/27). I am looking for about $.32 per share....but the keys will be both '18 guidance and debt reduction strategies.Still thinking $20 by end of the year.
"Given the potential VALE has in earnings growth, this stock should be up a dollar each month until the end of this year. At least $29 by Christmas?"
Sell VALE and buy CLF to be happy. Right Michael?
Does Vale have a share buy back program? It would seem to me that a company who prefers to give dividends than see its share price rise except little by little would also want to buy back shares and let the shares it buys back start to appreciate while its cost of paying dividends go down. Either way - it’s hard to be in a sounder stock.
Vale will post Huge earnings Increase!
Lots of fake news in US about prices abating today. It’s a total joke since Dems to spend another $3.5T!
23 undervalued. 22 undervalued. 21 undervalued. Almost 20 undervalued. Probably not undervalued. Just everyone thinks so . Wrong ! It’s not .
Dividend run ready to start !!!
"Earnings today, Go Longs!"
The little gold nuggets in the vale 
let's close over $15 today! go Vale!!
Vale hit the Buy zone yesterday according to I.B.D.
When this is triple digits next year people will be slapping themselves that they never bought at rock bottom
"The stock is also trading ex-dividend today, those holding it through today will get .3983/share come September when the dividend is paid out. Good Luck and have a nice weekend!"
"i came up with this formula to predict vale's future share price: first i looked at historical data from previous years to try and find a correlation between iron ore price, production(quantity) and share price. i found the following data: iron ore price mt produced. stock price coefficient(iron pricexproduction)/stock price2017 $80 366 10/sh avg 29002018 $70 384 12.5/sh avg 21002019 $100 302 12.5/sh avg 24002020 $88 300 7.5 /sh avg 3500 (note , this year anomalous maybe due to cov)2021 $130(est) 343(vale gdnce) $17.82 /sh 2500(estimate based on average conditionsmy estimate of average iron ore price was based on futures prices from sept21-feb22. notice that the 2021 projected price is close to the current market price. notice that if we assume $140 per tonne to be the average price the estimated stock price would be 140x343/2500=$19.2/share. thus every $10 change in average iron ore price means about a $1.3 change in the price of vale stock. iron ore makes up about 80-85% of vale's total sales volume and but although i tend to hold them equal in determing stock price i think they will favorably aid the bottom line in the near term.....in a word....EV'svale gives guidance in 2022 of 400 mt we get a stock price estimate for end of 2022 of: $12.8/sh@$80/tonne$16/sh @$100/tonne$20.8/sh @$130/tonne$24.5/sh @$150/tonne$28/sh@$175/tonne$32/sh@$200/tonneas you can see, based on these assumptions, the price of the stock can vary quite a bit based on the expected price of iron ore. my next post will be a long boring analysis of the direction of the price of iron ore but will be more qualitative than quantitative like this one was. $$"
Lots of volume right now........going GREEN real soon........)

Lewis SÃO PAULO--Brazilian mining giant Vale SA reported its profit soared in the first quarter from a year earlier amid strong demand from China from a low level a year earlier because of Covid-19 pandemic restrictions at the start of 2020.Vale said Monday it had net income of $5.5 billion in the period, up from $239 million in the first quarter of 2020. Net operating revenue rose to $12.6 billion from $7 billion in the year-earlier period. The company reported adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of $8.4 billion, from $2.9 billion a year earlier.The company said earlier this month that iron ore output rose 14.2% from the first quarter of 2020 and sales of iron ore rose 14.8% from a year earlier. Net operating revenue from China jumped to $7 billion in the first quarter of this year from $3.2 billion in the same period a year earlier, Vale said.Demand for iron ore in China was stronger in the first quarter compared with a year earlier as the Asian country's gross domestic product surged, growing 18.3% in the same period. The rapid expansion of Chinese GDP was partly because of an economic slump at the start of 2020 caused by coronavirus pandemic-related social distancing measures.""Without a doubt it's very important for Vale that China is one of the economies that most quickly recovered from the crisis,"" said Ilan Arbetman, an analyst at Ativa Investimentos. Vale's production of premium iron ore should also help the Brazilian company, Mr. Arbetman said, because China ""has been raising the bar for quality commodities and Vale's production from its operations at Carajas is purer"" than from other sources.Vale said demand from China could face an impact in the rest of 2021 because of environmental restrictions there, but added that expected high prices for steel in and outside of China should also help support iron ore premiums."
Am I wrong or does VALE have a P/E ratio of about 1.35:1? Based on their last 4 quarters of earnings. Why is Yahoo's number 6:1? Either way this is ridiculously low.
Fibonacci retracement just reached. Load the boat
"Vale, one of the world’s top producers of iron ore and nickel, has been active in Indonesia since 1968 through PTVI, which mines nickel ore and makes intermediate product nickel matte.The Bahodopi project will use electricity from natural gas-fired power stations for the smelting process, Baowu said, adding that carbon emissions would be cut by 60% as a result."
"VALE now over 8% yield. I do not care if VALE price never goes higher. I'll site here and count my money every year. If EV ever becomes reality, car co. all over the world will need Vale's nickel. And copper etc. Long term hold for me"
"Very nice volume behind the price appreciation, excited for Friday. Goodluck board!"
Is anyone else buying right now? I’ve been long and I’m about to put in a large buy order
"I just saw on YouTube that Vale supplies a lot of nickel for those batteries in Tesla cars. Is that a ""big deal"" or not? Probably a drop in the bucket for Vale>"
vale has 2 things going for it:1. it produces the best quality iron ore in the world and has huge reserves and2. it is the worlds leading producer of nickel. on battery day elon musk said that he envisioned making improved batteries and the superconductor but would need much more nickel to achieve scale. 2 years ago electric cars made up 1% of all cars on the road. today they account for 3%. by 2025 they are expected to account for 10%. by 2030 28% and by 2040 58% of the world car market. if you think that tesla stock is perhaps overpriced right now then maybe buying into the supply chain(VALE) is the next best thing.
The realized sell price in Q1 of their ore was about $165 on average. Q2 will at least be $190 if not $200 on average. That’s a 20% increase after a blowout Q1. Earnings season will be fun.

support at $17. hope it doesn't break past that.
Solid.
Vale upgraded at Morgan Stanley on improving cash flow story
"New 52 week high! Woohoo… While it may fall tomorrow due to ex-dividend, I think it will continue its march up till earnings day in July"
With a big dividend coming in Sept. its hard to believe such nonstop selling.
It sure looks like there's a group of investors that think the April 26th numbers are going to look good......keep on a truckin........GREEN is a beautiful color......:)

seems like if mr market didnt like vale's earnings report the dumping should have happened yesterday and not today(7/30). could be another big friday sell off by the institutions to make sure options expire worthless.
Poll at conference in Perth says IO to avg. 71 per ton this year.

How often does this pay out a dividend?
"the most significant variable in vales intrinsic value, and thus its expected share price is the price of its underlying commodity, iron ore. it is interesting to note however that the other two big iron ore producers rio tinto and bhp both posted solid gains today so the investors who traded the stock today saw some problem with vale other than ore price. one might then look to recent litigation threats against vales joint venture samarco but since vale and bhp own an equal stake in samarco would not bhp be equally affected today? i am having difficulty understanding what mr market is trying to tell me today.its interesting to note that institutions own only 27% of this stock because given its rock solid assets and reliable growth one would think that it would be more. the 3 biggest institutions black rock, state street and vanguard own almost 10% of all the stock in the entire stock market so courting institutional ownership is vitally important to price stability of a stock. blackrock made some kind of declaration awhile back that they were going to divest themselves in great part of environmentally unfriendly companies, targeting big oil for awhile(but then they bought back in again). my point is that big investors are no longer entirely buying cash flow but they are, to some degree buying their politics? vales assets, and potential future assets are vastly undervalued by my analysis..............so i grasp at straws trying to explain to myself the current reality."
"Have you ever watched game shows that poll the audience to help the contestants to know what to do? They are right almost all the time. The Polling is in.

This was amazing!! The dam settlement wasn’t enough to cause a dent while bringing resolution to this legal issue . And 77 cent dividend is icing on the cake!!
"Q4 did great in-spite of the settlement. We're 70% of the way thru Q1 and the average price of iron ore has increased about 20% and nickel has increased by at least 12% from Q4. That's all money that goes to the bottom line. From a balance sheet perspective, the cash-on-hand at 12/31 is essentially equal to the sum of their current liabilities. As Borat would say: Great Success!"
$WIMI $VALE $NTES This is brewing and consolidating. Ready for big multi day RUNNnnnnnnnn
Looks like huge buyback this am and again after hours
Iron ore 65% to 58% spread is completely blowing out on high met coal prices. Good for high quality producers like $VALE and $CIAFF and good for #drybulk ton miles. Expect more high quality IO to come from the Atlantic in coming years.
A company that makes this much money and pays such a great dividend is pathetically undervalued here. Justice in the world obtains at $59.
I'm so impressed with VALE that I went all in premarket. I could have done a little better had I waited. HA! Ticker shows I'm about even now. Vale should be above 20 soon - I think.
Nickel prices soaring…
@anthony dont you forget about Nickel ? Today 12% of Vale`s sales is on Nickel and going forward this will grow very much. In some years from now I do think that Nickel will be as important as Iron ore for Vale (us) and will drive the share price way above >50.
By the price of Vale’s stock yesterday as well as Rio and BHP one would never expect that IO was up almost 5% and at ab3 month high. 65% was over $90. So much for the projections of a 4th quarter average in the mid to low 50’s.

"Iron is breaking above $140/ton.China and Australia are having a trade war, so China will import more iron from Brazil (VALE).Why VALE is still under $25 is difficult to explain."
Did this thing really sell off because of the strike ? Would seem there would be more to it. Stock is dirt cheap. Not counting big dividend.
Always hear people complain when they lose money that the stock is manipulated. Never this is not the right stock to buy right now . I made a mistake. But everyone said undervalued. What did I know .
sell sell
