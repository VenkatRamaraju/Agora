"Prosecutors will not make Vale pay back much , watch and see , buy now ."
"i came up with this formula to predict vale's future share price: first i looked at historical data from previous years to try and find a correlation between iron ore price, production(quantity) and share price. i found the following data: iron ore price mt produced. stock price coefficient(iron pricexproduction)/stock price2017 $80 366 10/sh avg 29002018 $70 384 12.5/sh avg 21002019 $100 302 12.5/sh avg 24002020 $88 300 7.5 /sh avg 3500 (note , this year anomalous maybe due to cov)2021 $130(est) 343(vale gdnce) $17.82 /sh 2500(estimate based on average conditionsmy estimate of average iron ore price was based on futures prices from sept21-feb22. notice that the 2021 projected price is close to the current market price. notice that if we assume $140 per tonne to be the average price the estimated stock price would be 140x343/2500=$19.2/share. thus every $10 change in average iron ore price means about a $1.3 change in the price of vale stock. iron ore makes up about 80-85% of vale's total sales volume and but although i tend to hold them equal in determing stock price i think they will favorably aid the bottom line in the near term.....in a word....EV'svale gives guidance in 2022 of 400 mt we get a stock price estimate for end of 2022 of: $12.8/sh@$80/tonne$16/sh @$100/tonne$20.8/sh @$130/tonne$24.5/sh @$150/tonne$28/sh@$175/tonne$32/sh@$200/tonneas you can see, based on these assumptions, the price of the stock can vary quite a bit based on the expected price of iron ore. my next post will be a long boring analysis of the direction of the price of iron ore but will be more qualitative than quantitative like this one was. $$"
@anthony dont you forget about Nickel ? Today 12% of Vale`s sales is on Nickel and going forward this will grow very much. In some years from now I do think that Nickel will be as important as Iron ore for Vale (us) and will drive the share price way above >50.
If I had a dollar for every time the words dividend and undervalued appeared on this post I’d be rich . Enough already.
"Isn't it great when the CFO goes, ""We have too much money"" and distributes special dividend bonuses to shareholders?"
I'm so impressed with VALE that I went all in premarket. I could have done a little better had I waited. HA! Ticker shows I'm about even now. Vale should be above 20 soon - I think.
"Remember Vale is a very powerful company with a lot of leverage all around them , not worried at all."
this stock has levered free cash flow of 95 billion and a market value of 101 billion? 95 billion debt but 70 billion cash? ebitda twice that of debt? the market has a very glass half empty view of this stock. they like tim cook and apple and frown on companies that need to get REAL WORK done. if nickel is as important to the EV future as elon musk thinks it will be vale is worth $40 easily. every day of no more mining mishaps or dam failures brings vale closer to a higher bond rating than the BBB it has now. if it wasnt for social paranoia and a more stable government vale would have a AA bond rating.

Volume is going crazy here we go $22 incoming
Iron ore 65% to 58% spread is completely blowing out on high met coal prices. Good for high quality producers like $VALE and $CIAFF and good for #drybulk ton miles. Expect more high quality IO to come from the Atlantic in coming years.
"SAO PAULO/RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazilian prosecutors asked a bankruptcy court on Wednesday to compel miners Vale SA and BHP Group Ltd to fully pay off their Samarco joint venture's 50.7 billion reais ($9.47 billion) debt, according to a court document reviewed by Reuters."
"Sorry folks, it probably fell because I bought shares, everything falls after I buy!"
$22 next week
"it is not clear why china cut back on its ore shipments but one theory suggests that beijing has been concerened about carbon emissions and has even imposed quotas on its own internal operations which it has been trying to ramp up as the world emerges from the post coronavirus environment. it is important to note that the quality of iron ore facilitates 1. the grade of steel that can be made with it 2. the cost of making that steel and 3. the amount of carbon emissions needed to make it. of the largest producers we have:1. vale 67% pure(source= vales website)2. bhp 62% pure (source= mining news)3. rio tinto 56-62% pure (cant remember where i saw this....hard to find data on rio tinto on this topic)thus as a rule higher grade ore commands a higher price. as a rule of thumb i would say that for every +5% purity the ore would sell for an additional 20% premium. treflis says that vale's average price per tonne has traditionally been $107 but may go to $127 this year. from what i can see their average price per tonne should be even better than $127. the price got up to over $200 but dropped to $172 after the chinese threatened cutbacks. china is by far the largest importer of iron ore and tradionally australia has enjoyed an advantage in terms of shipping costs(i would assume) because of its closer proximity to china. if, however the chinese are becoming more environmentally concerned it could well move vale to the front of their line and rio tinto to the back."
"I really like that idea of Vale to start making iron ore briquettes. Suppose they are able to include some alloy metals in the briquettes? Can you imagine the demand for those, and what the stock price will zoom to? Your grandchildren will love you for your foresight."
Looks like huge buyback this am and again after hours
Remember that VALE SA is going up . Buy now !
RIO announced a $5.61 dividend along with their earnings. Expect VALE to announce something similar tonight. Maybe $1.50 ?
"What has happened to this stock?A few weeks ago it was higher than CLF,Iconsidered buying it and was surprisedtoday to see it at $19.55,$10 lower thanCLF,haven't done any research,just opinions!"

"I am not a lawyer (God forbid!) but this goes against very basic legal principles doesn't it? it's as if you have an LLC but they still go after your personal assets. what's the point of having a separate legal entity? I think these self-righteous prosecutors may be preparing to run for office or just shorting the stock?and China... can't blame them for shooting down the prices, they have the power, maybe Vale should shut down a few mines in Minas Gerais and see if the Chinese can build bamboo skyscrapersand management.... buybacks? when? there is plenty of cash, and if there isn't then borrow at 4% and buy stock that yields 10%, am I oversimplifying?I am mad as hell... haha"
"in my last post i demonstrated the correlation between vale stock and the price of iron ore. in this post i will attempt to determine the mid term and long term direction of iron ore price. first of all we put forward the fundamental axiom of economics which states that price is determined by supply and demand. the supply side of the equation is pretty well defined as the big iron ore producers give guidance on production several years out in their quarterly presentations.So lets talk about the variable in this equation that is hardest to predict: demand. demand. iron ore for 2020 was about 2.19 billion tonnes growing at a fairly constant rate of about 3-5% yearly. of this 2.19 billion tonnes china alone consumed 1.17 billion tonnes, or slightly more than half of the entire world supply @ a growth in iron ore consumption of 9.5%, well over the world average increase.it poses the question why do the chinese consume so much more iron ore than the rest of the world? indeed they are third in total economic output behind the US(22T) and EU(15.3T) China(14.5T). Well the answer is recycling. the EU recycles over 50% of used scrap iron, the US recycles 47% of used scrap while china recycles less than 10%. china is a superpower that is racing to catch up in some things. china is actually buying scrap iron from other countries and stockpiling it and have announced a 5 year plan to recycle 23% of domestic scrap in 5 years. when they do that it will, all other things being held equal, dramatically reduce the price of iron ore, and thus unfortunately the price of vale stock. still 5 years is a ways off.now for the good news. out of the 2.19 billion tonnes of world ore consumed 12% of that ore is used in automobiles of which about 76 million are produced worldwide. the average car is 60-65% steel by weight and it takes 1.6 tonnes of iron ore to make 1 tonne of steel. consider that the growth rate of gas driven vehicles has averaged -1% over the last 10 years while the average growth of EVs is 50%. consider that the US bureau of statistics estimate that 20% of all cars on the road will be EVs by the year 2030 and 58% will be EVs by the year 2040. consider further that there are 1.4 billion cars in the world now. that means that 1400 million x .2 new EVs will be produced over the next 10 years or 280 million. that means that 280 million x .625(the % of steel in a car) x1.6 units of iron to produce that steel x the average ev weighs about 2 tons=56 million additional tonnes of iron ore will be needed yearly over and about the 3.5-5% world iron ore growth rate i mentioned which would cause the growth rate of iron ore demand to increase by about 3% based on that one thing alone. 3% increase in iron ore use may not sound like much but it will have a dramatic effect on price to the upside. now lets look at profit margins and how iron ore prices affect them. i will use the Tesla model 3 as an example since i understand its financial dynamics best. a model 3 sells for about 40k and costs about 28k to make. that gives you gross margins of about 43%, that means that for every dollar of sales 43 cents go back to the producer in profit. now of that $28,000 cost how much of it is from buying iron ore? well we said that 65% of a car was steel by weight and a car weighed 2 tons that would be , shall we say, $150/tonne x 2 tons=$300 in raw materials for the iron to make the car....that is about 10% of 1% of the entire cost of making the car. suppose you raise the price of iron ore to $600 it would still only be about 1/5th of 1% of the cost of the car. so is the buy of the goods(the iron ore), in this case going to miss the opportunity to make $12,000 on a tesla model 3 because he is so cheap he wont pay a few $100 in increased iron ore prices? what do you think?in summary i conclude that there are 2 massive forces at work here with respect to the short, intermediate and long term price of iron ore. on the negative side we have chinas ability to increase its scrap iron recycling capacity. based on its own projections that will have little or no short term effect, moderate to significant intermediate effect and probably a very great effect as the EV market becomes saturated which will take more than 20 years by most projections. thus if ev sales ramp up faster than chinas ability to build a recycling network then vale goes up in the intermediate term with iron ore price and other strategic metals such as mangenese(used for steel making and nickel(for NCM batteries, the 4680 battery). on the other hand if EV sales sputter and china ramps up recycle faster than anticipated iron producers stock(vale) will suffer. imho ev sales will win this race but no way to be sure."
Will Vale get out of this Valley. Not walking . Probably need a Super Cycle.
Pure manipulation so the big dogs can get in cheap
When this is triple digits next year people will be slapping themselves that they never bought at rock bottom
"the most significant variable in vales intrinsic value, and thus its expected share price is the price of its underlying commodity, iron ore. it is interesting to note however that the other two big iron ore producers rio tinto and bhp both posted solid gains today so the investors who traded the stock today saw some problem with vale other than ore price. one might then look to recent litigation threats against vales joint venture samarco but since vale and bhp own an equal stake in samarco would not bhp be equally affected today? i am having difficulty understanding what mr market is trying to tell me today.its interesting to note that institutions own only 27% of this stock because given its rock solid assets and reliable growth one would think that it would be more. the 3 biggest institutions black rock, state street and vanguard own almost 10% of all the stock in the entire stock market so courting institutional ownership is vitally important to price stability of a stock. blackrock made some kind of declaration awhile back that they were going to divest themselves in great part of environmentally unfriendly companies, targeting big oil for awhile(but then they bought back in again). my point is that big investors are no longer entirely buying cash flow but they are, to some degree buying their politics? vales assets, and potential future assets are vastly undervalued by my analysis..............so i grasp at straws trying to explain to myself the current reality."
Cheapest call options on a quality stock j could find
"in 2016 vale's break even price for iron ore was 43 dollars a tonne. today it is $39 dollars a tonne. that means that anything that vale gets above $39 a tonne goes into their pockets. even at $80 dollars a tonne vale is cleaning up. at the current price of $165 dollars a tonne they are REALLY cleaning up!!!!!!!!! vale has 7.2 billion proven iron ore reserves. at $80/tonne sale price-40 lifting costs=$40 profit per tonne. 7.2 billion tonnes/5 billion shares outstanding=1.44 tonnes/share of vale stock x $40 profit=$57.6/share.at 7.2 billion tonnes with no further capex to find new ore at a rate of 400 million tonnes produced per year vale has about 18 years of iron ore. other iron producers have similar reserves and as ore is mined out price will go up as supply of high grade ore is used up. the $57 dollar a share value of vales iron assets completely ignores other mineral contributors such as gold, nickel, copper and several others. nickel makes up about 12% of vales mineral reserves and will play an increasingly important role to earnings. by my tally this is the most undervalued stock on the market."
"@anthony would like to add that it takes >250 tons of steel to make one windturbine. Dont know how many wind turbines there are going to be produced in the years to come. but quite a lot I guess (ESG). Btw, it takes Nickel as well to make steel :-)"
23 undervalued. 22 undervalued. 21 undervalued. Almost 20 undervalued. Probably not undervalued. Just everyone thinks so . Wrong ! It’s not .
18 1/4- 18 1/2 below this I believe we will have a wait...... Just my research..... any reasonable responses !!!
VALE will be $25 in a few months.
"""Brazilian prosecutors asked a bankruptcy court on Wednesday to compel miners Vale SA and BHP Group Ltd to fully pay off their Samarco joint venture's 50.7 billion reais ($9.47 billion) debt, according to a court document reviewed by Reuters.Samarco filed for bankruptcy protection in April as it struggled to restructure its debt, which it stopped servicing after a dam burst at a mine in 2015, killing 19 people, releasing a giant torrent of sludge and halting production.Prosecutors consider Samarco's co-owners to be responsible for the disaster and are seeking a restraining order that would oblige them to cover its debt, according to the document."" I'think the market is overreacting to the news. The 10 billion demanded against both companies, must be compared with 300 billion in revenues per year of VALE alone."
I’ve been watching this for a month now to get in but it keeps coming down lol. What’s a good price?
What am I missing here? the financial ratios are the lowest I've seen for such a big company.
"Yep, VALE should be making big bucks even though iron ore prices have significantly retreated from their highs, but the overhang of much more than a hundred billion R$s (5.3/1 vs US$) in fairly likely court ordered liability payments (State and Fed actions) is a real buzz killer."
chart says 19.5-20 first - fundamentals don't agree.let's see how it goes for next 3 weeks as volatility to be expected. IMO
Its iron ore deposit has the capacity to supply the entire planet Earth for the next 500 years! Vale is a very profitable company and the book value per share is 40. The price is less than 25... So it is undervalued. Vale is a Brazilian company. I live in Brazil and I know it is a wonderful company to invest in.
