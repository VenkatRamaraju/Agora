Buy at 70
Tyson Foods reached a 52 Week high at 83.42
V-O-L-A-T-I-L-I-T-YBuy strong resilient companies and low price because of Delta paranoia.
Tyson back to 90. It's inevitable.
"Dividend coming soon, investor day next month. Buy more Tyson. Expansion into Soylent green soon. All employees vaxed. Chicken wings and chicken sandwiches for fall football season."
"Nov Tyson 80 calls active. Captures earnings i believe, they sold for over $2. Time to add more tyson"
"Wow, hit the 80 and was sideways, now rising 80.80. looks like moving out of tech?"
"Adjusted net earnings per share for this quarter was $1.94, 28% increase from the prior year. The stock was $80 around this same time last year, Feb. 2020. How is this still in the $60s?"
Tyson already declared the next dividend payable in December. Hoping next earnings call we can get a increase for next year. Get closer to 3% with stock price closer to highs. With expected earnings does it look plausable ?

Buy or sell Puts @ $72.
"Got dividend. Covered call premium. Life is good. Tsn earnings were great and the company keeps on executing. Labor day steaks, ribs, chicken on the grill along with hillshire products. Tsn is a winner."
Will Tyson raise their dividend this year?
Does Tyson sell weed infused chicken.  yum yum
Probably not going any higher before ER. Mid Bollinger and 20 & 50 day are below $80.
"Dunno what the white house is complaining about meat prices, they gave everyone stimulus checks and link cards to go out and buy steaks and riot. Then they had to raise wages and put in Covid19 restrictions. Of course prices were gonna rise. Plus they approved the consolidation and sales of our protein to foreign investors like Brazil and china. Then regulations on flatulence and how chickens need to be able to be cage free and flap their wings before they get there heads cut off. I heard bacon was going to $10 a pound in California due to new pug regulations. The white house complaining is more wag the dog for other issues. Controlling the narrative."
Any reason for the post market down 12%?
"Tyson Foods (NYSE:TSN) had its price target raised by analysts at BMO Capital Markets from $84.00 to $95.00. They now have an ""outperform"" rating on the stock.This represents a 19.7% upside from the current price of $79.34. Per market Beat"
"Tsn dudes down after hours. I thought they were selling lots of meat and everyone is vaxed. Everyone wants a chicken sandwich. Dunno why these dudes down, hope they raise dividend. I'm eating all the stuff they make and tell all my friends and family to eat this stuff, I need the stock price up bigly."
is corn and soybean getting more expensive for TSN? will that eat into profits? or can they pass it on to consumers?
