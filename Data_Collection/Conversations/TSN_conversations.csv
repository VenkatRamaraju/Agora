"Morningstar Research Note, May 4, 2020No-Moat Tyson Facing Several COVID-19 Challenges, but Shares Compelling for Long-Term Investors4:16 PM ET 5/4/20 | MorningstarRelated Quotes 4:00 PM ET 5/4/20Symbol Last % ChgTSN55.32 0.00%Real time quote. We plan to lower our $91 fair value estimate for no-moat Tyson by a mid-single-digit rate, as we now think strength in retail will not offset weak food-service demand, and incremental costs should modestly lower operating margins (beyond our 8% prior outlook). We initially assumed strength at retail (45% of 2019 sales) would offset declines in food-service (31%), but as some food-service capacity cannot be adjusted for retail, we plan to modestly lower our fiscal 2020 sales forecast.Tyson's second-quarter results (sales grew 4.2% and the operating margin declined 170 basis points to 4.6%) were overshadowed by the broad disruption ensuing from the coronavirus outbreak. For one, Tyson is experiencing outsize worker absenteeism in its production facilities. Protein processing is labor-intensive, with employees standing near one another, which has led to COVID-19 outbreaks at several plants. We estimate about a third of beef and pork capacity is impacted, with plants either closed for several days, or running slower line speeds. This disruption has caused livestock prices to fall, while prices for cuts of processed meat have increased, which lowers Tyson's cost while increasing its selling prices. We think this benefit will be substantial, as livestock is the largest cost component for Tyson's beef and pork segments, which account for nearly half of operating profit. As such, we expect this benefit to offset a material portion of incremental costs, such as $120 million (0.3% of sales) in frontline bonuses, temperature scanners, protective equipment, guaranteed pay related to disruptions in shifts and sick time, and fixed cost deleveraging as plants are temporarily idled for cleaning, quarantines, and/or weak demand.Shares fell 8% on the report, trading in 4-star territory. We think Tyson is best suited for long-term investors. Even given volatile swings in profit margins that can occur in commoditized businesses, we think the margin of safety is attractive."
I like what I see from a technical analysis. 3 month chart shows support & accumulation. Added 200 more shares
"Yacktman Focused Fund bought 700,000 shares of Tyson Foods"
"Is this a rotation out of tech, into food, value?"
"One of the most socially responsible meat companies in the US. Big exports to Asia this year, rise in beef prices and lower cattle prices should lead to a stellar Q."
Added a few shares today. Its just too cheap to ignore.
Funds are already starting to swarm into TSN. Big money will be chasing cheap Yield - your getting 3% for only 10 p/e. I believe TSN will trade over $80 in July.
Beat on everything with improved outlook. Will spike!
We’ll touch 60 tomorrow.
"As jim cramer said, if stocks that benefit from the trade deal go down more of a reason to BUY"
is corn and soybean getting more expensive for TSN? will that eat into profits? or can they pass it on to consumers?
They gonna lose half their employees 
"Seems like a great opportunity to get long here, stock down 11% in a few days on good news-analyst upgrade and price target hike, and plants back at full production. Dividend is very safe here as well. Let's see 62's by the close today!"
Protein will be desired for quite some time I believe... TSN to $106 by 2nd QTR
Thanks for the discount!
"I like it, but why is it up ? The upgrade to equal weight or the other news ?"
They didn't start exporting to China until the first of the year. The last quarter wouldn't reflect any deals with China. The next quarter should pay out well. Sometimes you must wait for payouts this stock isn't going to double overnight.
"I’m going to help you. TSN will keep going up, so buy as much as you can. Ask yourself this, will people be eating chicken in 3,5,10,30 years from now ? YES. No new companies are going to try to take over the chicken market. TSN has full integration with too high a cost to entry. In our lifetimes, TSN will be $100,$250, maybe even $500 a share. Learn how to invest. Hang on to some nice yield, while this steadily climbs a year after year"
"Wingstop(WING) which sources chicken from TSN, is trading near all-time highs. It's just a matter of time before TSN rallies back up to the 80's. You get paid a fat dividend while you wait."
When are earnings reported?
"The biggest risk is not even being talked about in the media. Just doing a little bit of research you can see that the number of infections at meat plants all over the US is incredibly disproportionately higher than than anywhere else in the state in which they reside. It doesn’t take a genius to see that if we can infect the tigers in the Bronx zoo, we can also infect the animals at these farms. The point is that under older regulations, these companies are not required to disclose coronavirus because they are common in livestock. They are using this old guidance to get away with not reporting it now even when they know that the infection is going back and forth from humans to animals. Tyson foods is a strong sell and an opportunity to buy out of the money puts."
Been patiently holding and adding all year. Finally breaking out
Jim Cramer also did a piece on this last night on CNBC shedding light on the potential of this company in 2020 naming it his number one BUY at the moment. That kind of exposure doesn't hurt.
Anyone noticed the chicken sections in grocery stores are still mostly empty? I think this has to move towards 80 soon.
"Got dividend. Covered call premium. Life is good. Tsn earnings were great and the company keeps on executing. Labor day steaks, ribs, chicken on the grill along with hillshire products. Tsn is a winner."
"How is/are these stocks going down? When er comes out whoever sells will be kicking themselves. I’m not pumping anything either. Pretty much common sense that meat industries are surging right now. Even if restaurants and or sporting events are not happening, people are still loading up on food. Most people have gained weight during this quarantine. If they do not beat expectations in ER, I will be very surprised.. IMO of course. I don’t have a crystal ball. But when you go food shopping the supermarkets are still empty. Food flying off of the shelves."
"03:38 PM EST, 02/19/2020 (MT Newswires) -- Tyson Foods' (TSN) shares declined nearly 2% in Wednesday late-afternoon trading after the company, during a CAGNY conference in Boca Raton, Fla., said that a slowdown in port activity in China has resulted in less exports to the region.Tyson executives said in a presentation that the company is witnessing some pressure in China due to the coronavirus outbreak."
Tyson heading back to all time highs Not sure why it’s not already there They will blowout earnings and give great guidance looking for a 15% pop on Monday
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/goldman-sachs-sees-high-quality-173100747.html
big short term reaction on a quality company. was waiting for such an opportunity.
"Tyson in perspective: Oversold right now due to COVID 19 and its now 45% down from the highs. The Dec - 18 low is around 50 so expect it to base around this figure. Can it go lower? Yes, if the market takes it down, but this will only be temporary. Food sales are lower right now due to worldwide shutdowns but this won't last forever and once COVID takes its course TSN will recover very fast and will be backordered for months. Consider this a BUYING opportunity and don't let yourself get taken down with the rest of the sheep."
"Their shares will go up the next couple weeks as people buy for the dividend pay out, then the stock will drop again to a normal level."
They should increase the dividend.
Yes I am Short but take a look at this and tell me that there is no way I am right.https://twitter.com/CNN/status/1252821179867357184?s=20
"Surpassing $40B in sales, market cap only $21B I think TSN has a lot of room to run !"
how much extra business is Tyson going to get from China? I'm hoping to hear some good guidance next earnings.
"Market up 1,100 and this is red...."
"This from Thompson-Reuters: CCTV, China's state-run television outlet, said the deal would satisfy China's increasingly demanding consumers by supplying products like dairy, poultry, beef, pork, and processed meat from the United States."
"With PPP in place and soaring meat prices, TSN could have a major eps beat ! I want to see $75"
"JUST ANNOUNCED PLANT-BASED PRODUCTS, BIIIIIIIG JUMP TODAY!!"
I’ve just bought into Tyson foods for the first time as a dividend play! I thought I’d use this Dip as my entry point! I’ve seen The financial results and I’m wondering why this dip has happened ??? Not complaining though! The dips bought me my entry point 
headline news - tyson virus transparency made it vulnerable to china ban. - tyson is the only american meat producer company to see china to slap a ban on some of its shipments
TSN is a powerhouse. I see many takeovers of the faux meat sector. Buyer at these levels.
"Seems TSN has joined the ""boring stock"" category. I'll just sit back and collect the divies..."
Wow just wow
Bought it at 92.5... Wondering if i should buy more of this for the long term run. Any suggestions?
Who added on the dip ? I sold puts knowing it was an overreaction. Look at the market .. TSN $80 is inevitable.
Cramer is usually on point and he's charitable trust bought more on Monday.. Don't know why this thing is going all over the place today
They say buy the dips. The same people said it would be up $75 today after earnings.
"CFRA LIFTS OPINION ON SHARES OF TYSON FOODS, INC. TO STRONG BUY FROM BUY10:14 am ET January 29, 2020 (CFRA) PrintWe lift our 12-month target by $5 to $105, 14.2x our FY 21 EPS estimate and a premium to TSN's five-year forward mean of 13.0x. We lift our FY 20 EPS estimate by $0.10 to $6.66 and FY 21's by $0.07 to $7.42. TSN shares have underperformed the market YTD (down 7% vs. S&P 500 up 1.5%), and we see this as an enhanced buying opportunity to purchase the largest diversified protein player in the U.S., with earnings forecasted to grow at a 17% CAGR over the next two years (among the highest in Packaged Foods). We believe TSN's FY 20 guidance is very conservative since it doesn't include the impact of African Swine Fever or realistic opportunities from recent trade agreements (excluding Phase One of U.S.-China, U.S.-Mexico-Canada, U.S.-Japan). Also, the coronavirus situation in China could result in greater demand for overseas protein. Lastly, we believe TSN could emerge as the leader in the plant-based protein space, given its embedded relationships throughout the supply chain and global reach."
Hmm... I wonder what happens for an industry leader (with giant infrastructure barriers) in basic economics when the industry has a large demand and limited supply.
when investors realise that food is in great demand now and will be more.
I love Tyson foods steady trucking
"Tyson Foods (NYSE:TSN) had its price target raised by analysts at BMO Capital Markets from $84.00 to $95.00. They now have an ""outperform"" rating on the stock.This represents a 19.7% upside from the current price of $79.34. Per market Beat"
They beat earnings and the price still went up?
Good thing I bought 100 TSN instead of a meme stock on jan 4.  Thank you Tyson
Meat prices are skyrocketing. Chicken prices have doubled in two weeks.
"Meat is flying off the store shelves, restaurants are open, prices have skyrocketed means big profits for TSN."
Chicken will never go out of style
"Gotta be in it for the long haul. Investments in clean meat will result in large scale future growth, short term problems should be resolved in the near future."
"Regardless of its current price, TSN is a good defensive stock. I’m down around 8% and will more than likely add to my position today."
Pork margins are up 340 percent. Bacon is headed to $10 a pound. Huge profits for TSN. They have millions of pounds in storage.
How much revenue and earnings does this company have to generate before people realize the under priced valuations?
"Pilgrim's Pride, not Tyson is under investigation.. This will bounce back. A good way to get a quick 5% discount.."
Food demand is high at these times. Tyson will be up huge once they announce the back orders they will be filling.
"300,000 shares traded and we lose 1,47%. It will recover tomorrow. We are fine"
We are grilling Tyson Chicken about 3 times a week !
Downward trajectory for this stock is so frustrating. Just don't understand why has been going down so much recently.
TSN is down -100.00% to 0.00
"Bottom line: While the results of the quarter were disappointing we believe the dynamic in China, despite the potential coronavirus-related delays noted above, support our view that pork exports to the region stand to increase as a result of the African Swine Fever. According to a note we received today from Bernstein, the analysts believe China has lost ""at least 65% of its hogs,"" equating to nearly a third of the ""global swine herd,"" adding that ""China is now buying 9.5% of U.S. pork production (vs. 1% in the year-ago period)."" However, there is still a gap between supply and demand (demand being well above supply) and as a result the analysts believe that there is still room for pork exports to China to increase (benefitting Tyson) and that prices can remain elevated ""in 2020 and beyond.""Additionally, while many of those farmers impacted by the African Swine Fever did switch to raising chickens, as CNBC reported late last night, the coronavirus is now taking its own toll on the Chinese chicken market as ""millions of chickens may soon perish in coming days as much-needed feed is not getting to them in time,"" because of shutdowns hitting the supply chain. This follows earlier reports of an H5N1 bird flu outbreak in Hunan that forced the culling of ~18,000 poultry.Given the growing pent-up demand for pork and chicken internationally as a result of disease outbreak and resulting infrastructure congestion, and management's reaffirmed guidance that chicken operations internally are set to improve year on year thanks to factors within their control, we maintain our One rating. We believe patience will ultimately be rewarded as pork imports into China pick up and especially should Chinese farmers be forced to significantly reduce the livestock inventories -- forcing the country to seek supplies elsewhere, i.e. from sources such as Tyson Foods."
Profit taking. I see it in a lot of stocks in the past hour.
Tyson already declared the next dividend payable in December. Hoping next earnings call we can get a increase for next year. Get closer to 3% with stock price closer to highs. With expected earnings does it look plausable ?
"So far this year has been a consistent decline in share price for TSN despite great showing on previous earnings report. Hopefully stigma of potential affect on China tarrifs on pork products has been fully absorbed into stock price sentiment and a reasonable May earnings report can pull this stock out of its spiraling decline. It has most of the marks of a great company. Good profits, leader in industry, decent dividend payment and good future prospects. Only issue that is not stellar with this company is the reputation of management not quite being as high as you would like, but not bad overall. Still feel confident that TSN will prove to be a solid investment down the near future."
"Searching for answers on this one....Even when market was up today, this thing was down a good amount. Anyone have insights?"
"I'm looking to get in at the open tomorrow on the pure speculation that after this deal is signed tomorrow, China turns around and announces they're buying a boat load of pork from Tyson. P/E of 16 is just gravy in my book. Someone please tell me if I'm not thinking of a key factor in my speculation before I pull the trigger tomorrow. My stop loss just triggered this morning in BABA and I have those funds earmarked for this name."
Buy or sell Puts @ $72.
"Lots of Buy reiterations today from Goldman Sachs,BMO Capital, JPMorgan, Barclays. Plants that have been sidelined 2 weeks ago are starting to come back on line now after deep cleaning and being fitted for partitions/hand sanitizing stations/outside seating areas. Don't let the big #'s of workers who tested positive scare you,they are releasing data from tests done 2 weeks ago, the majority of them(80-85%) are asymptomatic or have mild flu/cold like symptoms which subside after a couple of weeks. Only 5 out of a 1000 on average may need hospitalization. What Tyson should be doing is moving their older at-risk workers into different positions or just paying them disability to stay at home for a few months until the situation improves. That way they can reopen the remaining plants with much lower risk."
"So I went back and reviewed the conference call with the Action Alerts Club membership.. Here are the items covered in the hour long call regarding Tyson:A Must Buy--NOW.-Tyson known for very conservative guidance... Did not focus guidance on China, specifically major impact of African Swine Fever.-China's poultry severely at risk b/c they don't have enough Soybean.-A special license was approved in mid-Dec allowing Tyson to export their goods into China-China's recent Tariff cuts (2/5) signals desperate need for US chicken, beef and coveted pork products.-America's continued love for chicken-- e.g. McDonald's new chicken sandwich.-Tyson has the specific brand of processed pork, preferred by the Chinese population.-2% yield vs.1.6% you get in treasuries.. did I also mention ""must buy"" with the Club's cost average at $87."
NEW UPGRADE: $83 PT I’ve been telling people to load up on dips. 30% gain and 3% dividend - buy and hold
I think TSN buying Hillshire Farms was a brilliant move. I will own Tyson forever.
"Tyson starting to see huge increase in pork exports, 600% increase YoY to be exact. Chicken demand is expected to double in China too. I am long on TSN at 15% below ATH, this is a good discount price to enter at. Vegan market will hopefully experience a lot more growth this year too."
I'm out guys. So much for speculation in pork. Haha In at 90 and out this morning. Waste of several weeks. A swing and a miss. At least BABA is 5 points below where I sold to buy this. Now its back to BABA for their earnings next week. Good luck to those that are long and strong. I'm sure next quarter earnings will be better.
Why on earth would anyone sell this stock ? Buying opportunity. Ultra low p/e dividend looks amazing now at this price.
This is THE time to load up imo. Think just one year from now. There’s no way the stock can be lower. Chicken demand is higher. Prices are higher. Yield is more .. it’s a no brainer
V-O-L-A-T-I-L-I-T-YBuy strong resilient companies and low price because of Delta paranoia.
TYSON has the lowest price to sales ratio in company history right now. I think this is the perfect time to BUY.

"Dunno what the white house is complaining about meat prices, they gave everyone stimulus checks and link cards to go out and buy steaks and riot. Then they had to raise wages and put in Covid19 restrictions. Of course prices were gonna rise. Plus they approved the consolidation and sales of our protein to foreign investors like Brazil and china. Then regulations on flatulence and how chickens need to be able to be cage free and flap their wings before they get there heads cut off. I heard bacon was going to $10 a pound in California due to new pug regulations. The white house complaining is more wag the dog for other issues. Controlling the narrative."
helping me here? corn down to 3 1/2 year lows gas down for trucks people looking for chicken
Any reason for the post market down 12%?
"CHICAGO, March 19 (Reuters) - Demand for U.S. meat at grocery stores will likely exceed supplies for at least another week, the chief executive of Tyson Foods Inc told Reuters on Thursday, as the coronavirus pandemic fuels panic buying among shoppers.Food manufacturers say overall meat supplies are ample to feed the millions of Americans hunkering down in their homes after state and local governments closed schools, bars and restaurants in an escalation of ""social distancing"" policies aimed at containing the virus.But a surge in demand for products from chicken and beef to dry pasta at supermarkets has left store shelves and meat cases empty, alarming consumers.""Once we are able to replenish supplies, which is probably going to take another week or so, then I think that we'll be back in better equilibrium between supply and demand,"" Tyson CEO Noel White said in an interview.He later added: ""In the short term, being a matter of weeks, there are some imbalances that exist.""The ""imbalances"" are more demand than supply in sectors like retail stores, White said. The total amount of beef, pork and poultry available in the United States is up about 2% to 3% from last year, he said.Orders for meat from grocery stores were significantly higher than usual through the weekend, after demand began to shift away from restaurants last week, White said.""The demand hit very quickly,"" White said. ""The order fill rate has improved. It's still not where we would expect it to be.""Increased buying at supermarkets has lifted overall demand for meat, although the increase has been largely offset by reduced demand from restaurants, White said. Demand from casual dining restaurants, in particular, has suffered, though fast-food restaurants continue to benefit from strong drive-through traffic, he said. Tyson is the largest U.S. meat supplier and counts companies like McDonald's Corp as customers.To meet increased retail demand, Tyson has shifted processing facilities to produce food for grocery stores instead of restaurants, White said. The company is running slaughterhouses at full capacity and on weekends, he said.U.S. cattle futures have dropped sharply on concerns slaughterhouses will close if the novel coronavirus spreads among workers.To avoid shutdowns, Tyson has begun taking employees' temperatures at two processing facilities and is expanding the practice to all U.S. workers, according to the company. It expects deliveries of several thousand thermometers on Thursday,"
Cramer said don't invest in this so obviously you shouldn't invest in this.
After earnings I don’t expect to ever see TSN under $70 again. It’s trading unreasonably low. We have a new $83 PT on the stock. I think we see $76 soon.
I'm on the edge of my tolerance level with this stock. It can't seem to hold 90+ sustainably. Is the coronavirus partly to blame for the decline on top of today's bad earnings? The whole reason I bought into TSN was because I believed it would get into the fake meat business and fry Beyond Meat. Is this a sound theory? If not somebody tell me otherwise and I will sell my shares.
"TSN vaccinates thousands of their workers. Clears the way to $100 a share, bigger dividends, and growth."
"Dividend coming soon, investor day next month. Buy more Tyson. Expansion into Soylent green soon. All employees vaxed. Chicken wings and chicken sandwiches for fall football season."

"From today's TSN Earnings Call transcript (cont.):""Within the ecommerce channel, we witnessed significant sales growth including a more than 140% month-to-month growth rate in our core business lines sold to a major ecommerce customer. We expect this trend to continue.Looking forward, our market insight, channel flexibility, access to raw material and growing demand give us long-term optimism. We are responding to the changes in consumer demand by pivoting our branded investments and innovation to more value-oriented offerings and two formats and sizes relevant for rapidly evolving channel dynamics such as e-commerce acceleration. Our retail businesses and brands are well-positioned to deliver sustained growth even if we enter into a recessionary environment."""
"In the quarter ended June 29, the beef unit recorded sales of $4.2 billion. Sales volumes and prices rose from a year earlier.That means at least $0.7B and lower margin due to redirection and more workers."
"just in from Cramer...TSN was downgraded today by ? and he states its an excellent buying opp...sounds like to the moon with the new trade deal...he is in it for $50,000....at $90.81...he is restricted right now or he would participated in a buy this a.m.....no guarantees of course...anything can happen...its the stock market....maybe they will short it once again and more shaky hands will fall out...shake the tree ....we should be fine..."
"Shares of Tyson Foods, Inc. TSN rose 2% as China announced exemption of U.S. pork and soybeans from additional tariffs"
"TSN’s innovation outlook is trending up based on a current score of 58 out of 99, outperforming sector average. Jobs growth over the past year has decreased and insiders sentiment is negative. TSN is an Average Performer in terms of sustainability. It is most exposed to Israel Chemicals Ltd. as its supplier. Over the past 4 quarters TSN beat earnings estimates 4 times and it pays dividend lower than its peers. I might have to reseach Israel Chemicals but overall I like it. Here is a biotech on my watchlist as well https://profiledstockpicks.com/zxper"
"I was smart enough to pick up 12K shares under $48. I can’t believe people were selling this under $50. Buy now, and hold for 2 years. Collect a nice dividend and make 80% return."
Sanderson farms is being purchased for 4 billion. That is the reason Tyson popped.
"Once the economy and restaurants start opening back up, there's no way this stock doesn't go back up into the 70's. This will happen a lot sooner than you think. CEO already said food service is improving every week since June so take out the one-time $300 Million expenses(employee bonus for example) and EPS for next quarter will be even greater than this quarter. 13 PE with $6 EPS = $78 PT in the short term."
Unvaxx truckers are stating they will not deliver anything to Tyson. This is about to get ugly I'm afraid. Hope their chicken fingers can walk themselves to the store.
Well this stock is popping today. May not be a giant growth stock but still has a lot of room to make up for its pre covid pricing. Some opportunities in artificial meats as well.
Ex dividend 31st
"a real bargain at this price. strong balance sheet, with largest volume capabilities in the industry and retail brand presence. will outperform the market ."
Wow!!!!!! $1.94 eps.. For comparison PepsiCo reported $1.47$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
Finally...!! only 30 points to make up my entry of 80!! Cmon Tyson!
Vaccine roll out puts TSN back at full production. Higher meat prices mean higher profits.
"From today's TSN Earnings Call transcript:Now, let’s discuss some channel dynamics we’ve observed in the wake of COVID-19. Each of our businesses has witnessed a profound shift from foodservice to retail. Our retail business remains strong and our core retail lines posted gains of more than 20% in the last 13 weeks, outpacing total food and beverage, as well as the top 10 food manufacturers. While panic buying has subsided from extreme levels, we continue to see 15% to 40% volume increases versus last year, depending on the category. As a result of these trends, we have successfully increased volume, margin and share within retail. Historically, approximately 45% of our total Company sales were the retail, 40% food service and 15% international. During early Q3, we saw our retail sales move to approximately two-thirds of our total Company sales"
This company is poised well across the meat proteins and understands the need to add value added product lines with higher margins.
Time to buy more?
"Very bullish news on Moderna vaccine today, I have a strong feeling that Trump will direct the company to give the vaccine to at-risk population like Tyson and other meat plant co. workers as part of an expanded trial. Stock should rally much higher from here"

Last earnings they had a selloff then the stock proceeded to climb 30%. I’m staying seated thank you very much
Wow just seeing this earnings beat. Buying another 150 shares. Want to sell for next summer vacation.
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-tariff-exemptions-boost-u-233006556.htmlFinally.. some good news!
Why did this tank at 2 pm?
Announcment of plant based product position Tyson very well in capture additional markets.
Tyson will be making some of McDonald's plant based burgers McDonald's usually splits suppliers. Every item in store is DEVELOPED in their kitchens! They will trademark their recipe.
"Tyson is among the investors in Memphis Meats (MM). Unlike plant-based companies like Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods, MM is growing its protein substitute from animal cells. TSN sold its interest in Beyond Meat because TSN has all the structure in place to develop its Raised and Rooted product. The investment announced today in MM carries TSN in its natural area. It will be interesting to see how this develops with other investors on board. https://www.dropbox.com/sh/a8d448rg2ia38wb/AADm73yA_KTatQr7C4RmZHTEa/Press%20releases?dl=0&preview=Series+B+press+release.pdf&subfolder_nav_tracking=1"
Highest corn prices since 2014. When we had a drought. Hope we don't get a drought this year. Maybe buy fertilizer stocks.
JP Morgan gave TSN a upgrade.
They sure had nice earnings and guidance last qtr. Did they talk T all about raising dividend?
"Tsn dudes down after hours. I thought they were selling lots of meat and everyone is vaxed. Everyone wants a chicken sandwich. Dunno why these dudes down, hope they raise dividend. I'm eating all the stuff they make and tell all my friends and family to eat this stuff, I need the stock price up bigly."
"Amazing buying opportunity. Lowest Price to Sales in company history. Safe dividend, low p/e. Sold a ton of puts, hoping I get put at $70"
"This is when you buy, when the stock price is extremely depressed...if you are trying to catch the low, good luck, yall know what they say...those who try to buy the lows are buying out of greed and very rarely ever get it right."
TSN is too cheap and the best value growth stock for the increase recovery business and profits with increase meat prices.
TSN is currently undervalued using the metrics such as P/B and PER. It has posted steady growth in revenues and overall EPS over years/quarters. It has healthy cash flow from operations and able to cover dividends and retiring debt to make the balance sheet mightier. JPMooroon wants TSN in their porfolio bad because year 2021 will be known as INFLATION. TSN will be one of the companies benefit a lot from the upcoming inflation. Even my grandmother knows the inflation will have to come because of the current steroidal cash injection due to the COVID. You will see unthinkable outperformance in commodity based sectors including TSN. JPMooroon knows this and wants a lot of TSN.
The most effective weapon against the corona virus is chicken soup. This is going to be a great quarter for Tyson

"This one is such a deal right now. About as cheap a stock as you can find right now. Debt down, earnings up, revenue strong. All the chicken is sold out in grocery store again. This should be $80. Easy one to keep adding."
"Wow, hit the 80 and was sideways, now rising 80.80. looks like moving out of tech?"
"Are the Chinese taking deliveries or not?I get that restaurants are a big 0, but grocery stores are strong, will stabilize and divert inventory.Anybody have clarity on the continued drop? I hear they are working around the clock to meet demand, etc.This is a consumer defensive stock that I bought on China deliveries of beef, chicken, especially pork.. I get everybody needs to eat, but what gives here?Great div while we wait, but am I missing something here? Or is this just a result of corona, entire market down, so TSN down?"
"I don't know why the jump today. I just sold the Oct 26 Covered Calls $66.5 strike for $1.78. The option premium is rich and serves as a cushion being TSN goes up and down. I bought TSN @ 62.9 as a ""forever"" stock holding to collect divvy and Call option premium."
I added 200 shares at $87.45 earlier this morning. Seems like a no brainer.
"Were only a dollar or two away from the point of all these lawsuit's claim shareholders were mislead about a pandemic. Seems to me tsn stock can easily rise on good earnings to the price these lawyers claim shareholders were mislead. Hard not to think they are frivolous. Last earnings I thought they had a beat, increased dividend, and buyback of shares and or paid down debt. Hard to think these lawsuit's have much merit. Looking to see if Tyson can go back to 70 here on earnings next week."
"Over reaction. Earnings were good. Yes you may have some higher input costs, but with automation, excess capacity, and the idea they raise prices. plus restaurants opening. Yeah wasn't a bubbly guidance as there was caution. But in the end solid results all things considered. Room for improvement in some areas, that can be achieved."
Buy at 70
"Finally took my middling profits today. Had hoped that this would be a great stock for the COVID recovery and love the dividend. It is a great company with an almost unassailable position. However, it quickly becoming a political whipping boy and the hyenas are tightening in on it. I believed for much of my investing career that the ""invisible hand of the market"" would ultimately prevail. However, the game has changed. Political posturing; a banana republic judiciary and the broad sense of entitlement in this once great country have made these external concerns pre-eminent.I hope I'm wrong and that you guys make a bunch of dough. Go get'm!!"
"Record output,Record pricesRecord demandThis is really a tough one to figure out."
TSN is the middleman between cheap stock and expensive end product. And they're the best in the business at it.
absurdly cheap but ehhh not too late
"Let's just take a second to reflect on Cramer who bought this stock in the high-80's and repeatedly told his viewers to buy the stock when asked about it until a couple of weeks ago when he capitulated and told his viewers ""don't buy,don't buy"" when plants were closing down because of coronavirus . His initial bullish view will be proven right in a big way in the coming few weeks."
Undervalued and stable...Good stock to invest in. I am a long-term investor and bought more.
Ex-dividend on Thurs. Get in while you can
TYN inked a new deal last month with the Republic of Kazakhstan which is the latest one internationally. TYN is the largest meat producer in the U.S. Its sheer size will be of benefit in growing its revenue streams worldwide.https://www.tysonfoods.com/news/news-releases/2019/12/tyson-looks-expand-beef-operations-internationally
Trump acting today to cut off any liability for the meat processors due to employee lawsuits.
Just bought some $TSN for the first time today in premarket... I love so much about the future of this company.
This is a very good buy. End user food costs keep going up. TSN has cornered the market. They will see higher revenues for the next decade.

Great earnings and better guidance. Tyson has to go to $100 by summer.
"Tyson CFO on CNBC today said that the company plans to expand its plant-based chicken line, which also has a healthier plant/beef blend burger product that competes with Beyond Meat but with much less saturated fat and calories.. The brand name is Raised and Rooted and it's selling extremely well. https://www.raisedandrooted.com/products/"
Meat workers included in next phase of large-scale vaccinations
Trump won’t let Tyson American owned fall in disgrace and controversy while Smithfield owned by the Chinese (I believe) continues to work and sell to Americans. Trumps ego doesn’t work like that govt assistance will push Tyson through and satisfy Tyson employees with fat stimulus checks. That being said I also see a play here for plant based near ie BYND. It’s not like playing moderna and say J&J risking it in INO. Okay both sides I say they will both come out on top meat is going no where but people are shifting with the times and health is more and more a concern. Long and strong in all mentioned minus J&J. BABA ready to go too. Good luck happy investing
What happened? I don't see any news to explain this rapid drop all of a sudden.
"Earnings beat, paid down debt, raised dividend. What's not to like"
"Big chicken problem, read the Dow Jones wire report. Restaurant closed everywhere, so not buying any chicken from Tyson. This impact should be MUCh BIGGER this coming quarter than the quarter that was reported today. No light at the end of the tunnel near-term. This could lose $50 today."
"TSN: largest meat producer in US, 43.2B revenue, 2.14B income, 5.3% yoy growthHRL: second largest meat producer in US (w some other brands), 9.61B revenue, 908M income, -3.3% yoy growthDespite Tyson making a good deal more money, they’re valued at less than HRL by market cap, 19.3B v 26.0B. There may be reasons to value HRL dollars more than TSN, but the premium right now is marked.Imo value here. It’s not like market sentiment has always been against TSN, they’ve been at higher prices w less money in the past."
Nice! Bought 1200 shares this morning thinking it would be a safe play through the election. Happy with today’s outcome! What’s the news though?
"So does convid-19 = no one eats any more? This is panic time and thus illogical. Yes, the impact of this virus will probably get more pronounced, but I don’t believe it means people will also die of starvation. Tyson is over sold in comparison to other stable stocks."
Thiese temp closures will only raise processors profit margins due to shortages. They have the leading position in the industry and this will not be a longer term issue with safety
"Gotta love how Cramer talks out of both sides of his mouth. He strongly recommended it to a premium stock pickers service when it was 90, now he says the products are selling globally, gas is low, and feed is low.. but the Mgt has problems communicating.. so he reluctant on recommending.. watch out for that guy.. Tyson is a buy, even with restaurants being closed.. Demand is strong in other buckets."
Why is the news of Tyson Plant-based meat made price lower? Don't Tyson investors like the news?
"What happens in low interest rate environments, funds buy up strong consumer goods companies with good yield. TYSN is the obvious stock to buy. Buy now and take advantage of a dividend that’s 3X the 10 Year and should see a 20% climb"
75 by august
"11,000 official post-shot deaths according to VAERS and over 45,000 deaths reported but covered up according to a CDC whistle blower. Tyson management is not thinking straight. Maybe they already got the shot and that's why they're not thinking straight."
What is Tyson doing to stop the spread so they can get back to work
Analysts are saying it will return to $90 soon.
"The pre-market sell-off has also broken support near $58.50, exposing immediate downside into the lower $50s. More importantly, the rollover raises the odds for a critical test at the March low and megaphone support in the $40s. Traders should watch OBV if that happens because a breakdown through the red line ahead of price predicts that the stock will soon follow, confirming a downtrend that could reach the lower to mid-$30s.The Bottom LineTyson Foods stock is selling off after a weak quarter, warning that the meat processor's shares could drop to five- or six-year lows in the coming months."

Will Tyson raise their dividend this year?
"bad bad sign for tyson and the real meat market, reseach done say vege meat will 40 percent of the meat market in thecoming 2 to 3 to 4 years notgood sign for tyson"
"TSN protein based plant based products will grow beyond the Beyond meat, and can knock most competitors down with its branding and high quality trend record. A lot of run way to growth"
"Today's news of China temporarily halting chicken imports from one of Tyson's plants in AR is simply revenge for Trump's latest insults at the country.This section of an Irish Times article on the news sums it up nicely:""China’s customs authorities had started testing all shipments of imported meat for the virus, while officials in some major cities were also checking the products at domestic markets. In a statement on Thursday, China Customs said all 32,174 samples of imported seafood, meat, vegetables, fruit and other related products had tested negative.""On Thursday, June 18th, just a few days ago, China tested 32,174 samples of imported meat and found ZERO coronavirus on them! I wonder what happened in the past couple of days to make them change their minds and target just one chicken plant, as a warning to Trump no doubt. The words Kung flu perhaps?"
Bought at 80 and change because of tariffs beings eased and huge demand from China but instead of selling at a big loss I bought the weakness. Moral of the story always have some dry powder to buy more into weakness to off set your $
"Hey folks. Has the demand for this companies products ever been this high in history? Has TSN ever been able to command the prices they now get? If you understand capitalism at all, you know this one is a big winner."
TSN is using their size and star power to grab major market share. With cattle and hog prices as low as they are and prices spiked over the last 2 months they are lowering prices to where others can't go. Genius.. back to 90 by July 4
It’s a 90$ stock. Enjoy those dividends on the ride up. $80 by jan 1
Anyone know should I sell or hold because pre mkt isn’t looking to good along with the announcement today
Tyson should get in the dog market in China revenue would double
"Does anyone think this price drop is because of Index funds selling? People still need to eat and the grocery stores are selling product as fast as they can get it. On the other side, demand from restaurants have cratered."
"What a wild dray! Grabbed 500 shares @ $56.70. Tyson Foods isn’t going anywhere. They will be just fine, we all have to eat. Good luck and good health everyone! "
Strong recovery play w/ Vaccine out - this should be at $90 - pre covid price
"Don't listen to shorter Henry. There is absolutely no evidence of coronavirus passing between humans animals in these plants. While the large number of infections is concerning, meat production is a critical function and Tysons will work with officials to improve safety and cleanliness in their plants to keep them running. Any reduction in output will cause a rise in prices which will ultimately benefit them as well. So in my mind it's a win / win situation for them. Tysons is also a leader in the growing meat substitute category. Finally, their stock is cheap right now with a forward PE of 8.6. I think this stock is a buy."
"When people find an alternative to eating food then I'll sell my shares. Just like these electric vehicles. When these ev owners install windmills and solar panels all over their property, then I'll sell my oil stocks."
Another tricky day of trading. TSN looks strong. Buy on any pullback!
It will report record free cash flow generated for the year! TTM shows great increase in FCF
Worlds largest protein producer. Be 85 by June. Don’t panic corona will pass and all will be okay.
I'm thinking this isn't the end of the world for TSN. I might buy a little more today if it stays down when the market opens
"isle 9, blue light special....right now TSN limited sale....back up your truck to the utility dock now....limited number of shares left...."
Is China on a hunger strike? WTH.. why won’t this sp move north? Thought they were accepting deliveries at the ports?
