how much did yall get per share last dividend payment?
"Yield is now 20%. I think the payout is safe. I admit; it's a small outfit, the CEO not great at IR; but he knows the business. I have some reservations; it's in a long downtrend. But it's gotten so cheap and it's got some great assets; just can't resist."
"Read this article, top 4 stocks for August, 2021, # 4 is BKEP. Price to Book based on the 1.49x industry average stated below & at the current $3.31 price would equal to a $4.93 share pricehttps://stocknews.com/news/cgau-arlp-co-bkep-4-top-stocks-to-buy-under-10-in-august/It closed Friday’s trading session at $3.34. In terms of trailing-12-month Price-to-Book, BKEP is currently trading at 0.36x, which is 75.9% lower than the 1.49x industry average. In terms of trailing-12-month Price/Sales, BKEP is currently trading at 1.20x, 10.8% lower than the 1.35x industry average.BKEP’s POWR Ratings reflect this promising outlook. The stock has an overall A rating, which equates to Strong Buy in our POWR Ratings system.The stock has an A grade for Value, and a B grade for Sentiment and Quality. In addition to the POWR Ratings grades we’ve just highlighted, one can see BKEP ratings for Growth, Stability, and Momentum here."
Bkept in the dark more like it! what's up here?
"I meant to say yesterday, maybe this week not today will be the last time BKEP trade in the $2 range. For long time holders like myself, i do hope i start seeing green on the BKEP line. Go BKEP."
"Dividend will be paid on August 14th 2019, 4 cents per ordinary shares."
It looks like there is a new 13G report on Edgar concerning ERGON. It looks like they just acquired an additional 2.4 million preferred shares from European fund at a price of about 5 and a quarter a share. Ergon was already the largest preferred shareholder previous to that acquisition.
Looking for significant growth over next 5 years. The demand for construction materials is about to surge. A bipartisan Congress will push for approval of a huge Infrastructure Package. BKEP should directly benefit. I am a new investor in the long haul .
Ergon has 3 asphalt terminals for 90 million that Bkep buys . The close the one with the least business and later decide to sell the others back for 60 million. Ergon was one of the largest holders of Blue Knight. Infrastructure bills haven’t ever made a significant difference in share price.!!!!!
"Sept 2019..Ergon pulled the non-binding offer after it was unable to reach an agreement with the Conflicts Committee, according to an SEC filing.Ergon last month offered to acquire all outstanding BKEP common units it did not already own for $1.35/unit and all Series A preferred units it did not already own for $5.67/unit."
They will miss AGAIN!
Outstanding debt is now 99 Million. I believe it was close to 250 prior to the sale.
"Event date. Last year the Divi announcement (P.R.) was April 23, 2018"
"I think today is a good entry point for BKEP, once the infrastructure bill is signed this stock will go above $4 within few weeks."
+5% from last year Q1..
Volume was 3X average today with a very large purchase around 2pm. These are the institutions moving in. The 13Gs on edgar are a trove.
Buying more first of next month.
What do you think the Infra-Structure Plan from the Federal Government will do for this stock? Multi-trillion dollar plan to rebuild the country's infra-structure. Things like bridges and roads and whatever else. This has presence in 26 states where a lot of rebuilding will take place. Cross fingers that companies like this will benefit.
ridiclously cheap
when earnings coming out
whats going on with this?
BKEP or BKEPP?Which would you guys recommend?
"Could it be over in a few years?EVs, Oil, And ICE: Impact By 2023 And Beyondhttps://seekingalpha.com/article/4225153"
Some big buyers this AM premarket
Why does m1 have it removed?
"Nice mention regarding dividend paying stock. We will be getting 4 cents on February 12th, at Friday's close it's an 8 percent yield. This stock has the potential to appreciate as well."
buy the preferred bkepp is a no brainer buy under 6
FYI. Last years announcement on when the earnings for 4th qtr would be released happened on March 2nd
We just keep marching higher overcoming small resistance along the way. Too bad I was low on cash when it got near 1.00; I got as much as I could; 2500 shares. That's the catch 22 with these downturns; you spend all your cash too soon not realizing how ridiculously low it will get. I had to scrape up my personal cash to get what little I got. I should take some profit but I really believe they will have blowout quarter. They may hit on all cylinders; and they have a lot of cylinders! I think they are nearly recession proof and a good hedge against oil price drops. Read their reports and study their earnings history in recent years and you'll see what I mean.
Buyout offer of $1.35 which probably will not be voted in should now be bottom price support for this stock. Dividend will be paid Aug 14.
This is the good news the longs have been waiting for.
Sell Alert! Going back to $1.12
"It has been confirmed that this will require a unitholder vote. Next issue. Why on earth did they offer BKEPP with a par value of $6.50 and way out of the money conversion feature this hefty premium?. It makes zero sense and I don't think it will hold up. The only reason BKEPP is trading where it is is due to ""yield chasing"" which everyone knows is a dangerous game. BKEP, as the common equity should be intitled to the residual value of the firm beyond the fixed claims.Move BKEPP's consideration down to the proper $6.50 and the deal multiple up to 11 on enterprise value/EBITDA, (Not including massive cost savings Ergon will enjoy due to cutting overhead and integrating into their org) and the common is worth $6 unit."
It would appear that looking forward after the cut they have a lot of potential for growth both on the stock price and possible increase in the dividend. Do some DD on this and you will find a lot more positives for Blueknight.
1 just wanted to thank bkep share holders who dumped this stock and I got around 20000 shares around 3.2o have 15000 of BKEPP so thanks for giving me your shares
The trend is our friend here. Basing over $2 bucks with volume picking up

Nice earnings report
it's buying time buy buy buy get it while you can cause I am
"if backwardation increase bkep will be hurt in asphalt business, but maybe would be compensated with pipeline business, the storage the same tha asphalt"
deference between bkep and bkepp?
Anyone know when to expect earnings report?
Took a starter on this.
Form SC 13G/A Blueknight Energy Partne Filed by: Invesco Ltd.
Dividend cut in half- but .16 a year is a good dividend at today's share price.
The Preferred Units may be the best option here..and trading at 2016 levels..
"if you question this company's future or dividend, go listen to the last earnings call from the website. make particular note of their 6.6 million barrels at Cushing with storage levels rising fast, meaning demand for storage. new infrastructure bill on CNBC the last 48 hours with Dems and Reps pushing for it, which means historic demand for asphalt in the potential pipe. and pay particular attention to the dividend ratio in the call. go listen to it."
What happens if they cut dividend? Will this fall below 1$ ? Then will stock be delisted ?
Good they kept the dividend distribution as last quarter.It is going to be better going forward. I’ll add more in the coming weeks.Currently own only 4 k will add another 6 kGL!
It seems that Ergon controls the board of Blueknight - so what happens now - so they just sent the email buyout offer to themselves?
We should see good jump tomorrow after infrastructure news.
Who was selling today. Pretty strong volume but on the downside.

Do you think the dividend will go back up near 0.58 after the sale?
We should a good bounce higher then. Will we break the $3 price anytime soon?
I am new to this stock. What is the difference between BKEP & BKEPP?
This is getting in buy range again. on watch
"This is getting so cheap at $70m market cap Im thinking someone might just do a buyout. While it loses $ on a leverage basis, it has net assets worth a possible breakup/liquidation of the company."
Up 10% today on no news. We all know it was way undervalued and still is! Apparently the market knows it also. Getting to $2 is probably certain but we'll need a good ER/CC to get much higher.
IMO smart decision to cut the dividend to 0.16 a year at these prices. There is the possibility to use some of the capital saved by the company to re-purchase shares :)New CFO seems to be a great hire! These recent actions by the CEO and $BKEP leadership give me confidence to purchase additional shares at $1.11 :)
They are offering 244 millions for the shares they do not own which is about 30 percent of the outstanding shares. Anyone have a clue between the preferred abs the ordinary shares what price will this offer put on each type of shares?
"In the past 6 months 11 insiders bought 404,267 shares.Great place to be with dividends and infrastructure."
"Still have my 9,000 shares from 2 years ago. I have no idea what is moving BKEP, and my hope is that something great is taking place."
BKEPP down 40 cents today. Everything related to oil is in the toilet!
China going full electric with 487 car makers!https://insideevs.com/turns-out-china-has-an-astounding-487-electric-car-makers/
I am seeing some positives for this company but would think the insiders would be buying if it was going somewhere.
"I believe (We need to get the company to *officially* confirm this) that this will need to go to a unitholder vote as GP only owns 31% of total units (BKEPP + BKEP).After selling the growth story, the unique value of these assets to the investing public, the incredibly opportunistic timing, the consideration offered by Ergon to the common (BKEP) units is highly inadequate.In no way, shape or form can this be called a ""good faith"" offer in light of the unique value and growth opportunity that is being taken from us that has been documented by *the company's own investor presentations* as recently as last month.Indeed, there are clear indications that absent increased consideration, this was not a good faith effort on Ergon's part - supressing the common units distribution with a ""growth story"" rationalization, in light of subsequent events, apears to be an act of bad faith.Clearly, given the company's pristine balance sheet and ample cash flow, they could have *substantially* raised the distribution this year, which would have supported the unit price - it would never have fallen to this opportunistic price, even during the ""dead period"" of news they are obviously taking advantage of.People don't just cook up things like this overnight - Ergon was 100% aware of what was being told to the investment public by BKEP management.On the positive side, the small relative value of the common units (Only valued at 26% of the deals current Enterprise Value: $138M BKEP, $291M BKEPP, $104M debt) means that even a moderate uplift in the deal's multiple could offer substantial extra consideration for BKEP's unitholders.For example. Just a 10% increase in the proposaed acquisition's Enterprise Value (BKEP + BKEPP + Debt) would boost BKEP's consideration from $3.32 to $4.62 per share. Investors in BKEP *must* contact the conflicts committe and let your voice be heard."
"Just charting the two symbols and comparing them together. the ordinary share under-performed the preferred share by a wide margin the last four years. Historical this will adjust back, that means, the ordinary shares should gain a lot to make up for the difference, if we include the dividend difference then the difference is even much bigger. I expect the ordinary shares to gain 300% percent at least to match the preferred performance. This will happen if BKEP management does a good and honest job and not interested only in taking risk at the expense of the ordinary shares, like so many companies in this field do."
its about time for some action and new PR from BKEP. When is earnings? What about a dividend announcement?
Infrastructure bill getting close
"A good entry price below $4, adding more ?"
That’s a fine throw in the towel from the very top. Well see if that Prefered divy holds up now.
"Along with AMR's financial deterioration, this news posted in late December might have added to their decision to suspend. Headline: ""Cimarron Express Pipeline, LLC, Has Filed Suit in Kingfisher, Logan and Payne County Seeking to Take Land for Pipeline."" Might not be a lot of suits for a 65 miles line, but still, the legal and delays could be a part."
Rev went way up but didn't bring earnings up with it. That is very scary. Margin going to zip.
everyone getting out this morning???? I thought we had to wait till end of the day!!!
Company shouldn't even consider any buyout for less than $1.50 per share.
"Looks like we've found the new trading range. I would accumulate now, Blueknight is going to pop after a quarter or two of post divestment normalized quarterly reports. The road blocks are behind us now."
"For what it is worth, at least good news is included in this September 25 2018 write up. https://seekingalpha.com/article/4208113-knight-ready-battle-back"
"ownership terms or partnership agreement has not changed after Ergon made a buyout offer of 1.32 few months ago before withdrawing it. If Ergon had an authority to execute the deal without unit holders consent , Ergon would have done at time itself. Actually what realy happened was bkep share went beyond 4. Now this news of buyout when congress is discussing infra bill feels fishy to me. I won't surprise if stock jumps to 5/6 in the near future."
"BLUEKNIGHT ENERGY PARTNERS: (BKEP) $2.83 Up $.26 in premarket trading… If you did not buy BKEP on our flash alert yesterday at $2.66, by all means buy it today while it is still flying under the radar screen! The company reported earnings after the close yesterday and the market obviously liked what they heard. Even if it opens at $2.83, this little under the radar LP will still be yielding over 6% with an extremely bullish point & figure chart. We now see the stock appreciating to a “tentative” $7.00 per share. More in tomorrow’s newsletter on this jewel. MDO"
Shorted 9500 so far 1.44 Avg
Let us hope we see good surprise in earnings.
Price will return to $3.00 soon. I hope it will become $5.00 before end of year.
Wondering if Bandera v. Boardwalk will have any implications. If this is pulled out from underneath us at an extreme discount to enterprise value a lawsuit should be explored.
Several insider purchases recently; saw it on Schwab.
Bought this on the crash. Took a while for it to bounce back. Nice Div. Will sell above 2
BKEP should conclude the sale some time later this month.
"Blueknight Energy Partners, L.P is up 6.21% to 3.58"
I work little in this field in oilI work on pipline made 1000 doller week back in 80's this stock is self-sufficient. even if electric-car take over the roads still have blacktop
Hmmmm......It looks like there is something coming up. 2 gaps up mid day on higher volume in less than a week? Could be Ergon making another run at them or........??
High Beta. Low PEBullish or bearish?
it is a buying opportunity now. This stock is giving a good entry point for new investors.
"bkep the only way to reach it potential, if bkep pay .14 dividend back year half ago"
$BKEP will fly to the 5’s soon. ALL they do is Asphalt and they dominate in 26 states. Only a matter a time before the institutions load up.
"This offer is a joke. The last few year we took a dividend cut to pay off loans, and improve the company. With our stronger company that we payed for need to get the benefit. Long BKEP and BKEPP."
This BKEPP vs. BKEP question bothers me. Question does the fact that they bought back preferred shares and not regular shares mean anything for the future performance of both share prices?
"With 32 cent dist, 3.20 is reasonable price to me."
"more buying orders, bigger than normal today."
"Tues State of the union speech to include ""The president will call on Congress to produce an infrastructure package"" which should bode well for us moving forward as Blueknight Energy Partners has 53 liquid asphalt terminals and storage facilities located in 26 states............map.....http://www.bkep.com/operations"
I bought several thousand shares when it was ca. $2.67 so I have a long ways to go before breakeven. Good luck to all of you.
do anybody know that bkep election is about?
Is this the straw?
"Hey, people I'll give little nugget I bought bkep 1.24Now found other oil stock I been watching, and bought it it has potential go hight. And stock is BTEGF"
They will cut the divided too.
I agree with DSR. Read the transcript of earnings call. Solid....https://seekingalpha.com/article/4217283-blueknight-energy-partners-bkep-ceo-mark-hurley-q3-2018-results-earnings-call-transcript
Ex date is when?
Not sure I'm seeing any difference in the September presentation and the presentation last month. Same?
Is the true value of BKEP around $6?
"BKEP seems to be picking up some steam. The upgrade by ZACKS and their ability to still pay dividend even at a lower amount is still positive that they survived the carnage of the OIL and gas MLPs. Potentially it can go a lot higher to around 2.5 to 3 by year end. They own asphalt facilities in 26 states, road will always need to be built and paved and repaved."
Perhaps a Div increase coming.
Can’t believe people are selling at these prices.
Is there really and chance for BKEP to make it? I have quite a few shares and have a average price of $2.69 and it feels like there is no bottom.
Keep in mind ..we are unitholders in a partnership..as opposed to shareholders in a corporation.. our rights are limited..
How did DG pick up so many shares?
"BKEP -Despite setbacks in 2018, BKEP appears poised for a recovery in 2019.

we need a solid break above the 2.21 peak in February 2019 to hopefully break above 2.50 toward the 3 range. This stock has at least a fifty percent appreciation and not a bad dividend at this price?
should pop to 2.75-3 bucks in short order
Maybe $3 today?!?!?
"Filing outhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1392091/000139209119000014/a8kcimarronprojectupdate.htmItem 8.01. Other Events.On May 10, 2018, Blueknight Energy Partners, L.P. (“BKEP”), affiliates of Ergon, Inc. (“Ergon”), and Kingfisher Midstream, LLC (“Kingfisher Midstream”), a subsidiary of Alta Mesa Resources, Inc. (“Alta Mesa”), announced the execution of definitive agreements to form Cimarron Express Pipeline, LLC (“Cimarron Express”). The venture contemplated the construction and operation of a new crude oil pipeline serving STACK producers in central Oklahoma with a new 65-mile, 16-inch crude oil pipeline extending from northeastern Kingfisher County, Oklahoma, to BKEP’s Cushing, Oklahoma, crude oil terminal.Ergon and Kingfisher Midstream each own 50% of Cimarron Express. Ergon, owner of the general partner of BKEP, holds its ownership in Cimarron Express through a wholly owned subsidiary of Ergon, Ergon - Oklahoma Pipeline, LLC (“Devco”). Ergon and BKEP also entered into an agreement (the “Agreement”) that gives each party rights concerning the purchase or sale of Devco, subject to certain terms and conditions. Under the Agreement, BKEP has the right, at any time, to purchase one hundred percent (100%) of the authorized and outstanding member interests in Devco from Ergon for the Purchase Price (as defined in the Agreement) by giving written notice to Ergon (the “Call”). Ergon has the right to require BKEP to purchase one hundred percent (100%) of the authorized and outstanding member interests of Devco for the Purchase Price (the “Put”) at any time beginning the earlier of (i) eighteen (18) months from the formation of the joint venture company to build the pipeline, (ii) six (6) months after completion of the pipeline, or (iii) the event of dissolution of the Cimarron Express joint venture.BKEP and Ergon have been informed that Kingfisher Midstream has made the decision to suspend future investments in Cimarron Express as Kingfisher Midstream has determined that the anticipated volumes from the currently dedicated acreage, and the resultant project economics, do not support additional investment from Kingfisher Midstream at this time. As of December 31, 2018, Cimarron Express had spent approximately $30 million on the pipeline project. Both BKEP and Ergon are currently evaluating the status of the investment in Cimarron Express. To the extent the Put is exercised in the future, BKEP would be responsible for 50% of the total amount spent by the pipeline project plus interest at 9% per annum. BKEP anticipates the principal cost of the Put could be reduced by $4 million to $7 million upon the sale of the assets of the Cimarron Express joint venture, for a total net cost to Blueknight of $8 million to $11 million plus interest."
"BKEP board issued an additional 4,000,000 shares on March 4th 2021 offered at $2.27 according to a recent S-8 filed with the SEC. Any comments is appreciated."
"Go listen to last earnings call on company website. Company announced that Cushing market came back big time, and they roughly 90% OF THEIR ENTIRE STORAGE WAS CONTRACTED BY DECEMBER, and they ""expect to be fulling contracted going into 2019."" Operational rates at crude oil pipelines by the company are surging and became profitable in September after spending substantial funds on fill up, which BKEP will be paid back. Demand for crude trucking services have been increasing and the company increased rates Oct 1st so they expect positive cash flows to return. My question is: What if the 'put' is not placed on BKEP? What if another company takes the investor place of Alta? A new capital partner. The oil business is booming in OK and crude oil prices are rising to very bullish levels. I don't think the company is doomed."
Why the selloff today?
"most of the leading indicators, including robinhood, have this stock at a strong buy. I just got me about 2,500 shares. let's wait and see.."
Do not waste your time or your money on this dog with fleas! Lots of much better opportunities in the market.
BKEP is one of those lost diamond rings found in the trash heap. It has been beat up for reasons that are temporary and already being cured.
Looks like only 1 analyst covers Blueknight..looks like we are first to the party..
should small retail investors wait or get out ?
"The earning report looks great, now let’s see what the market reaction will be. Yesterday the large buy orders maybe the confidence the market has in the future of BKEP."
I like larger dividend the BKEP well take care of itself
Some pf the numbers on yahoo are wrong. Q1 earnings were positive and show yoy growth of about 10%. Yahoo had them negative. Yahoo indicates bv of $11+! Don't know if true or not. Pretty incredible if true. Perhaps this is more undervalued than I thought. The recent sale of non-core assets fetched a good price and will lower debt by a third. This is a smart move with rates likely to go higher. Debt/EBITDA will be under 3.5 which is very good.
"Sad to say, but I believe the show is just about over. The more I examine BKEP it really has no place to go. The more I look at the financials for it, it is bad. Going forward, no place for it got. Will be taking a large short term loss. Good luck to all of you."
"The first question comes from Jeffrey Doppelt with Merrill Lynch. ""I have a large position in Blueknight as an individual holder and as for clients I go over quick numbers with you, more than 550,000 of the common units and more than 105,000 of preferred. I actually have a couple of questions. The first question is regarding the disposition of essentially all of the units held by 2 directors back in September. Can you comment on that? And are they still directors of the company.""CEO..""All right. Well, I can't comment on the disposition of the units. They are still directors of the company, but I obviously can't comment on those personal transactions. So..."""
"Are we anticipating a dividends increase for Q1 and if so what would it be? In the past when bkep was trading in the $3 dividends there were paying out .08 per unit or .32 annually, roughly 10% yield. I think it was even in the .14 cent range before that, I'm guessing it could go back that again. Not a bad stock to hold just for dividends."
Buy when you have a chance. It will not stay at $1 range.
If they offer $4 to $4.25 for the common they may actually be able to steal this outfit. The preferreds don't matter. Steal it when it is down and out?
"This will have about 12% yield with the expected cut, better coverage, lower debt load, and the potential for growth. Even better, their business is all domestic, essentially unbothered by trade issues. A relatively safe place while Trump fights the trade wars."
"Divvy safe.. Turbo Tax handles K-1's easily..so easy, even a caveman can do it.."
FYI according to I.R. distribution announcement tomorrow....didn't say pre or post market as it was on my answering machine
"2020 Annual Report.."" Holders of our Preferred Units and common units have limited voting rights and are not entitled to elect our General Partner or its directors. Unlike the holders of common stock in a corporation, unitholders have only limited voting rights on matters affecting our business and, therefore, limited ability to influence management’s decisions regarding our business. Unitholders did not elect our General Partner or the Board and have no right to elect our General Partner or the Board on an annual or other continuing basis. The Board is chosen by Ergon. Furthermore, if the unitholders are dissatisfied with the performance of our General Partner, they have little ability to remove our General Partner. Amendments to our partnership agreement may be proposed only by or with the consent of our General Partner. As a result of these limitations, the price at which the common units will trade could be diminished because of the absence or reduction of a takeover premium in the trading price."""
Will fall to around 1.65-1.75 they need to cut the divy again
Like the BKEP story here. Used to own this in 2016 but sold. Always wanted it to be pure play asphalt. Just reviewed IR presentation from November. Can anyone confirm if the GP is traditional where they take percentage of cash flows? Looks that way on presentation. I will pull 8/10K b4 buying but just asking? That would be a downcheck if they retained that burdensome arrangement. Most MLPs have ditched that as it is blatantly against unitholder interests. Thanks in advance
There are plenty of producers in central Oklahoma..the Cimarron Express Pipeline is not dead yet..plus the planning stage is paid for..
this a good stoxk to hold on to for dividend?
"Bullish on the preferred, bearish on the common"
Rated a buyhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-stocks-under-5-buy-185006764.html
I think a higher offer will be presented soon .
Gone from $1.13 in early Jan 19 to $1.84 close today or up 60%.
Ergon making a bid again?
any thoughts regarding the Saudi situation's effect on this stock? So far seems like none...
"so, with this sale they are asphalt terminals and storage only?"
Anyone knows why the preferred shares went up a bit but the ordinary shares dropped over 7 percent. that's unusual.
Based on the result I’m expecting some increase to dividend next qtr. May be 5 cents.Gl!
Maybe today will be the last time BKEP trade in the $2 price range. The recent up movements tell us more buying ahead.
"So, this flew up to $2.20 from $1.10ish on div announcement and then drops down to $1.10ish because the Cimarron Pipeline might be cancelled? And I say might because couldn't another entity or an existing partner already involved pick it back up? ...and, one would think management knew of the fragility of the pipeline deal prior to div announcement. I'd say this is a stock that was already out of favor and this pipeline issue could be temporary and if not still doesn't justify a selloff down to these levels. We'll see tonight and tomorrow! Gl2yall, I'm hanging in for now!"
This should be flying to the moon soon after Bidens speech today! Just got in at 24$ ... never too late i. guess? Any suggestions for cheap infrastructure stock? thoughts on $PRIM $RXN $ROAD $CLF $FCX $BKEP ?
"Dividend cut imminent, 30%. Probably falls further."
"confirmed 8 cents....OKLAHOMA CITY--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Blueknight Energy Partners, L.P. (NASDAQ:BKEP - Common Units) (NASDAQ:BKEPP - Preferred Units) (“BKEP” or the “Partnership”), announced today that the board of directors of its general partner has declared a quarterly cash distribution on the Partnership’s common units of $0.08 per common unit, as well as a cash distribution of $0.17875 per unit on the Partnership’s preferred units. The fourth quarter distributions for both the preferred and common units remain unchanged from those paid for the third quarter of 2018. The distributions are payable on February 14, 2019, on all outstanding common and preferred units to unitholders of record as of the close of business on February 4, 2019."
Now waiting for $1.40.
"Glover; This BKEP oil company 1 1/2 year ago new MANAGMENT. And back then, pay $.14 dividend, then $.08 and now .04"
When they start paving roads in the warm weather this will take off
Even though it's still way undervalued; it's due for a pause. Lots of traders bought in the low 1's so it's tempting to take profits. Other than that there is no doom to worry about. When they report and announce the dividend longs will be pleased with their purchase. I got some at 1.13 but also got some near 1.60 and considered that an incredible bargain!
What made it move up 7% today? Can't find any news on the web the would make it jump.
2.50 more likely
Someone bought nearly 1 million shares at $3.26. Someone is optimistic.
"This is a forgotten stock that very few are paying attention to it. This company will only become an asphalt storage facility in few days, divesting itself from all other oil related businesses. They will be able to pay down all their debts if they chose to and be able to retire or buy back many preferred shares. They will increase the dividend and they will become a stable company with very good and steady revenue stream. They have a good presence in the asphalt business in 26 states."
Looks like we found a bottom - jumping off the floor with over 10% price run up following high volume! Looks good to me!
BKEP or BKEPP? What’s the difference and which one is better to own?
This will test a new low.
going under a buck dividend will be cancelled buyer beware
Once the infrastructure bill is signed BKEP will continue its ascent.
Not complaining but why is this running so hot?Not this high since 2018
So; they lost $1.36 per share! Oh; but they promise a good quarter coming; they been making that promise every quarter for about a year; and each quarter gets worse. About Cimarron they tell us what we already know. I was hoping for a miracle; like what to do to save the company. You can't keep losing money and paying a dividend. Just be honest and say so! Then; it might have some value as a speculation.
I like investing in solid companies with beat down stock prices...I think I found one here.
$BKEP is at such a bargain price right now. Road construction is already picking up and Blueknight gets paid to deliver the more products it moves. We are going to see good earnings seasons and then a huge pop when Bidens infrastructure bill passes. After that its just going up from there.
"Blueknight Energy Partners, L.P. Names New CFO9:00 am ET April 11, 2019 (BusinessWire) PrintBlueknight Energy Partners, L.P.

Any predictions about stock price after an infrastructure bill is passed?
Looks like we will be lucky to get $3.75 - negotiating a price with themselves is a tough situation for shareholders.
"$2 is too low, 3 and higher would be reasonable. There was an offer for $1.35 a share and it was turned down, politely. I think I agree with others on this board, that asphalt prices will go higher after the economy moves back into higher gear, sooner or later. It all depends who is a major share holder and what is their price to give up the shares."
Up from 1.12. That tells me this stock is overpriced right now. Who wants to buy at this point paying extra 80%?
This has held great during the sell off. Granted it has taken a beaten before. Hopefully wonder how the progress of the pipeline is going
against offer of 1.35. management doing good job in difficult energy market.
BLUEKNIGHT ENERGY PARTNERS: (BKEP) $2.945 Up $.235… New 52-week high and loving this chart. For now our price objective is $6.50 but we will be raising the objective with a print of $3.00.
"I sold b4 xdiv. After seeing MMLP earnings, who does similar stuff, glad I sold. I'm not bearish long term; but q4 was a tough quarter in many areas besides oil prices. I plan to read the ER and listen to the CC B4 I buy. I think there's a future here but Im fearful of q4 report. A so so report could send this back to the prior lows or worse. I elected to hold MMLP through ER, since it looked better than BKEP and lost big! GLTAL."
About time bkep.. about time.
Big announcement this morning? wondering how far this stock will go especially after it's recent high of 2.42
"It is a good entry point at this level, it will continue to build higher as earning expand better than expected."
"anyone know why the negative reaction today to the positive earning report, after a nice reaction after market yesterday after the earning announcement?"
Will take a 10% yield any day..
It is time to go now!!
Be ready to accept $3.75-$3.80.
They were supposed to announce the Dividend distribution today.Gl!
I'm in it for short at 2.22!!! Heading for 2.20!!
"But ""as well as a cash distribution of $0.17875 per unit on the Partnership’s preferred units."" This was not reduced, been the same for years. For me that is madding part for me, the small investor gets it in the ###."
Dividend is .08. They said they would and they did.
Nice pop today. Pre-earnings accumulation? Any ideas
Run Rabbit Run!!!
Having a nice move up today
Hello all. Am intrested in learning more about this company. Dividend seems pretty high... Not complaining but just s little odd. Bought just 66 shares today. I am a lower volume day trader. And this is my first stock in this sector. Also own a MJN Stock and bank stock. Wouldnt mind tossing in 15-20 shares in here at a time while staying updated on the dividend it self.I see they have been paying dividends since 2007 which is a positive check mark for me. Has anyone in here been compounding this stock as well. Thanks guys hope too hear back :) Happy investing
"We've had a couple dips in last few days which was due considering how far we've risen. Hopefully, those who waited for a dip got some shares. I will have more cash soon so it probably goes higher soon; Murphy's law!"
It seems we lost steam today?
Here we go. Hopefully some clarity on thishttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/blueknight-energy-partners-l-p-213000400.html
When do the K-1's for this MLP come out?
please correct me if i'm wrong. yes dividend is .08 but if you buy the current share price. you pretty much get .16 cents per share if you bought twice the amount of shares in comparison to .145 when it was $5.4. looks like a win with also great growth in EPS
About 1100 Call Option Contracts have been bought today so far. Great news for the long on BKEP.
"Love it, but what is moving the stock price up so fast? I have 9,000 shares and even with all the upward movement I still have a paper loss. 2 months ago I thought all hope was lost, but thank God I decided to hold."
"Don't know about oil shorts, do know that despite what the Fed tells you, we're starting to see inflation.Oil is a commodity, and as more dollars (3+ TRILLION) start to chase less goods/services, prices rise (look at cost of gas).Do your own DD on FCX (used to own) and VALE (currently own) - basic material companies that have dramatically risen over last year +/-Infrastructure means oil byproducts (asphalt) and lots of $$$ and the SAFE Act, mean think about cannabis stocks If you want to safely play OIL, look at the ETF XLE (I own)Think BKEP being out of mid-stream and focused on asphalt is a boring, but rewarding place to be"
"Let's us hope this is the start of a recovery. Momentum is on the positive side, like they say the trend is your friend."
"this flat chart is pointing to accumulation and upward sign, hopefully after the transactions announced last month are completed this month."
"I’m waiting for a buck. With oil eventually in the 30’s, drilling will slow down so no storage need. Just store in the ground. Another dividend cut coming."
Unfortunately there is no incentive to buy this until they announce Divi or something positive. Divi cut or suspension likely so.......................
BKEP is making higher highs and higher lows on clothing the last few trading sessions. This is very positive for the stock at least for the short term traders. It could hit 2 depending on the earning results next month and market conditions.
What we now know compared to last fall shows the company in much worse shape then during the previous dip in Dec '18. So yes it should go much lower. Interestingly the preferred hasn't yet fallen to the previous dip in the mid $4's. I expect it will eventually retest that low. They will certainly cut the common and probably the preferred also according to recent CC.
I have noticed for the past few weeks the share volume is steadily moving up. I also noticed some sound and reputable companies holding their shares. The insiders are confident and hold close to 10% of company shares. Sounds like a buy at this price and steady dividend income. Feel free to critique my opinion.
never has there been infra since ike
how does this 30% dividend work ?

Blueknight Energy: Paving The Highways To Stable And Generous Dividends..
Bkep back 2 years pay .14 dividend but that was old managment
"Listened to the latest call again. Q3 is usually a very strong rev and earnings month. Pipe business is a very good play they have pivoted to, especially liquids in Oklahoma."
"Very pleased with the direction of Blueknight. I am particularly happy with the reduction in debt. This is now a unique company in the MLP sphere and most importantly, its stable."
"Are people slowly accumulating this without driving up stock price? Is it fairly price at the moment or is this undervalued? I feel like this should go higher but perhaps there's dilution concerns, management decisions, etc."
"$15 mil is prepayment for asphalt from Ergon. It is on 10-K.Looks like this year will be turn around to bkep. Storage almost fully under contract and pipeline volume doubled.We will see dist rate next month. If it is 6 or 4 cent per Q, SP go up a lot."
Is ergon going to take it private? Makes sense since after Covid the asphalt market is going to huge.Gl!
"M and Neil My wife worked for Exxon, so we’re longI own a MP that just went all asphalt $BKEP, not hawking it, just like it better than $PAVE or $ROADCertainly more “affordable” to start a positionGLTA"

"Buy now, before the return to the $4 range soon. This is a good entry point into the stock now."
"Slowing climbing on low volume, even on a down market day. just imagine what happens when an infrastructure bill gets passed."
"It's only money, I had to pickup 2,000 more shares, but that is it!"
"Strange, why would they make such a lowball bid - I just don't get it."
"how can the profit from last year equal the market cap? EPS of 7+ and book of 10 and its trading as on OTC flyer with assets or revenue... because of one potential hit of 10 mill from a stall project..which i'm sure can be spread over time and written off, if it were to go that way. im sure there's others avenues for protection or retribution for getting screwed like this which will limit this hit.."
excellent beat. should be at 5. Making americas roads drivable again.
Looks like the preferred would not take a hit if there is a distribution cut..any comments from the preferred out there?? Anybody??
"27 days ago, i wrote below that it seems that BKEP will jump soon. I hope this is the real one that i am hoping for. This company is way undervalued going forward while the rest of the stock market is over valued. Investors can get better than 10 percent dividends while hoping for some appreciation in the near future. 1.55 was the recent high in the last two years, if we close above that today, it will be a positive. let's hope so."
"It seems BKEP is eyeing the $4 price range. May the $3 range is almost over, let us hope soon."
"Dylan-This is to you; I didn't post on VLNCF board, because I'm not hawking/pumping this, just put this in the back of your mind, or the side of your mind, after we hit $10USD with VLNCF (TCU's for all!)$Blueknight (Nasdaq: $BKEP and $BKEPP) is a publicly traded master limited partnership that owns the largest independent asphalt terminalling network in the country.

They will cancel the dividend and common going under a buck
"I was going to buy at $2.50, then $2.20, then $2.00, then $1.80 but it just keeps dropping and with oil going back into the low 50’s it really hard to pick a bottom. I guess ‘I’ll wait for $1.60."
"its looking bad if it continues i will bail out, monitoring closely!"
Going to be a terrific earnings report in early March. Make sure you have cash to scoop up shares if it droops after xdiv. You want to own this b4 ER/CC.
There will be a vote. Call the company and ask for yourself.
A dividend cut is coming. This will go under $1.
Blueknight Energy reached a 52 Week high at 1.60
Here are the Top 10 Owners of Blueknight Energy Partners LP. impressiv:https://money.cnn.com/quote/shareholders/shareholders.html?symb=BKEP&subView=institutional
Dividend coverage improved from 0.82 to 0.92
"Added a few more @ 2.15 today.. but that will be it for me until we start seeing some upside. Nice volume lately tells me there's support at these levels. Holding long, collect dividends while waiting for price increase. Gl2ya"
"I discovered when cut just mentioned. I really expected it to fall further. But I did some more dd on it. Now, I understand better why it didn't fall very much. They cut in order to exploit an opportunity w/o diluting to get cash for growth. So, a solid 10% while waiting for probable growth is not a bad deal. Also, technicals indicate it's turning bullish. I don't expect much cap gain, yet; but I think it doesn't go lower either. If things pan out, it will soon be paying higher than .58."
cheap cheap cheap cheap unreal
"In @ 2.70, moved the order up from 2.50 as it didn't seem it will go that low, but now that I bought it, it probably will in a day or two :) I buy for long term anyway though so I'm looking for slow and steady rise to $4 with a decent div income while the company recovers."
"Maybe just a keystroke error - did they actually mean an initial offer of $4.32, not $3.32?"
Agree the volume is steady and higher than usual. It has a solid base to move up from this level.
DG Capital is the largest institutional owner of BKEP at ~7%. The other institutional owners have in aggregate roughly 30% of the outstanding common.
A close above 1.80 is what we need today.
"Love it,patiently waiting for a nice run with my dividends buying more."
I should just pull the trigger and by $38k of this. It’ll be worth $45k in a month. The biggest infrastructure spending in our nations history happening… buying stock in an asphalt company is a no brainer. Kinda like investing in Clorox when COVID hit.
bkepp the perfered shares are dirt cheap at 5.30 should be trading at 6
I bought 5000 shares at $3.51 and only wish I had purchased more.I won't be selling any time soon.
