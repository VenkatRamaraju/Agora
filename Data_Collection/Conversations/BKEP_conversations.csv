"It has been confirmed that this will require a unitholder vote. Next issue. Why on earth did they offer BKEPP with a par value of $6.50 and way out of the money conversion feature this hefty premium?. It makes zero sense and I don't think it will hold up. The only reason BKEPP is trading where it is is due to ""yield chasing"" which everyone knows is a dangerous game. BKEP, as the common equity should be intitled to the residual value of the firm beyond the fixed claims.Move BKEPP's consideration down to the proper $6.50 and the deal multiple up to 11 on enterprise value/EBITDA, (Not including massive cost savings Ergon will enjoy due to cutting overhead and integrating into their org) and the common is worth $6 unit."
"This offer is a joke. The last few year we took a dividend cut to pay off loans, and improve the company. With our stronger company that we payed for need to get the benefit. Long BKEP and BKEPP."
No volume..
"Barron's today..Blueknight Energy Partners (BKEP)DG Capital Management revealed a 7.7% interest in the asphalt company, equal to 3,193,778 shares. On Oct. 12, DG Capital delivered a letter to Blueknight Energy Partners that opposes a recent deal proposed by Ergon, the parent of Blueknight Energy Partners GP. Under the Oct. 8 deal, Ergon will offer $3.32 per Blueknight Energy Partners share, plus an additional $8.46 for each Blueknight preferred share. DG Capital believes that the overall deal undervalues the firm, especially as Blueknight has “substantial liquidity and balance sheet capacity,” which should have led to larger distributions to common shareholders. DG Capital also feels that Ergon is self-serving, as it holds 60.4% of the noted preferred securities. Given that stake, DG Capital feels that Ergon’s proposal “improperly shifts value” to preferred holders away from the common shareholders."
"Notice that Blueknight has NOT issued a press release. Why? It appears they do not want to alert common unitholders to what appears to be a self dealing scheme by the GP - suppress the unit price, support the preferred price via repurchases, then do this low-ball offer for the common that rips an enormous amount of value out of our hands."
"I feel that this offer will face the same fate as the first offer. It will not receive any response, business as usual. Maybe in two more years another offer is submitted with a higher price."
"From DG capitals letter to Mr. Ligon: ""Ergon’s cynical effort to steal value and lock the Company into a proposed merger transaction with a steep discount price being offered to common unit holders, just before the infrastructure bill is passed, should be summarily rejected. It is rank self- dealing, and neither the Board nor the Conflicts Committee should sanction it."""
"Hello,I have a query on the EV, in yahoo it is 253.73M but in seekingalpha it falls to -126.83M why this difference so important? how much do you think she is? on my screener it is also negative but if it is wrong it changes all, another error that I don't understand the price to book in yahoo is at 82 but book value per share 9.27 $, normally with such a large book value per share the price to book should be below 1"
still no update on the buyout offer?
"From DG Capitals letter to Chairman of the board: ""At a minimum, it would appear to be a breach of fiduciary duty for the Board to enter into or approve a proposed transaction that strips common unit holders of such value and improperly shifts value to preferred unit holders"" (End of the letter): ""DG Capital’s position that the fair market value of the common units exceeds $6.00 per unit and that is without accounting for the additional potential upside to the value of the Company’s common units resulting from the passage of the proposed infrastructure bill, which the Company expects to be significant."""
The distribution announcement should have been out by now. Should be out any day now. I am eagerly awaiting this one.
"ownership terms or partnership agreement has not changed after Ergon made a buyout offer of 1.32 few months ago before withdrawing it. If Ergon had an authority to execute the deal without unit holders consent , Ergon would have done at time itself. Actually what realy happened was bkep share went beyond 4. Now this news of buyout when congress is discussing infra bill feels fishy to me. I won't surprise if stock jumps to 5/6 in the near future."
Not a single update from BKEP board on the offer.
"2020 Annual Report.."" Holders of our Preferred Units and common units have limited voting rights and are not entitled to elect our General Partner or its directors. Unlike the holders of common stock in a corporation, unitholders have only limited voting rights on matters affecting our business and, therefore, limited ability to influence management’s decisions regarding our business. Unitholders did not elect our General Partner or the Board and have no right to elect our General Partner or the Board on an annual or other continuing basis. The Board is chosen by Ergon. Furthermore, if the unitholders are dissatisfied with the performance of our General Partner, they have little ability to remove our General Partner. Amendments to our partnership agreement may be proposed only by or with the consent of our General Partner. As a result of these limitations, the price at which the common units will trade could be diminished because of the absence or reduction of a takeover premium in the trading price."""
"Couple years ago Ergon was offering $1.35 per common shares to acquire BKEP and the board rejected their offer. Not sure how much more shares did Ergon acquired since their first offer. The question here is what legal leverage we have against Ergon’s offer? It someone can answer this will be much appreciated. DG capital management has their eyes on this deal and they are trying to squeeze Ergon with more money, will they succeed unless they have a legal axe to grind. It is hard to muster a fight without the board and the large investors."
Keep in mind ..we are unitholders in a partnership..as opposed to shareholders in a corporation.. our rights are limited..
"It's important to note that both the CEO and the independent directors would be financially hurt by accepting this low ball buyout. The issue is that the general partner seems to be acting in bad faith for their own self dealing. I don't think Blueknights management or independent directors are desiring this, this was strictly the Lampton Boy's ill-conceived power play. When this is over the General Partner should be removed and a new one sought. I know that's virtually impossible, but it should be explored. Our GP should be a partner, not a self dealing good 'ol boys club trying to strip assets from shareholders to boost their ow private family interests."
"Dg Capital ..""Reference is made to that certain letter from Ergon, Inc. (“Ergon”), the parent of Blueknight Energy Partners G.P., LLC (the general partner of the Issuer (the “General Partner”)), to the Board of Directors of the General Partner (the “Board”), dated October 8, 2021, a copy of which was filed as Exhibit 99.H to a Schedule 13D/A filed by Ergon and certain other persons related thereto on October 8, 2021 (the “Ergon Letter”). Pursuant to the Ergon Letter, Ergon proposed to acquire all of (i) the outstanding Common Units representing limited partner interests in the Issuer and (ii) the outstanding Series A Preferred Units representing limited partner interests in the Issuer, in each case, not already owned by Ergon and its affiliates (the “Proposed Transaction”). The Reporting Persons believe that the consideration being offered for the Common Units in the Proposed Transaction substantially undervalues the Common Units. As a result, the Reporting Persons currently intend to oppose the Transaction, including with respect to the Common Units beneficially owned by the Reporting Persons."".."
"I believe (We need to get the company to *officially* confirm this) that this will need to go to a unitholder vote as GP only owns 31% of total units (BKEPP + BKEP).After selling the growth story, the unique value of these assets to the investing public, the incredibly opportunistic timing, the consideration offered by Ergon to the common (BKEP) units is highly inadequate.In no way, shape or form can this be called a ""good faith"" offer in light of the unique value and growth opportunity that is being taken from us that has been documented by *the company's own investor presentations* as recently as last month.Indeed, there are clear indications that absent increased consideration, this was not a good faith effort on Ergon's part - supressing the common units distribution with a ""growth story"" rationalization, in light of subsequent events, apears to be an act of bad faith.Clearly, given the company's pristine balance sheet and ample cash flow, they could have *substantially* raised the distribution this year, which would have supported the unit price - it would never have fallen to this opportunistic price, even during the ""dead period"" of news they are obviously taking advantage of.People don't just cook up things like this overnight - Ergon was 100% aware of what was being told to the investment public by BKEP management.On the positive side, the small relative value of the common units (Only valued at 26% of the deals current Enterprise Value: $138M BKEP, $291M BKEPP, $104M debt) means that even a moderate uplift in the deal's multiple could offer substantial extra consideration for BKEP's unitholders.For example. Just a 10% increase in the proposaed acquisition's Enterprise Value (BKEP + BKEPP + Debt) would boost BKEP's consideration from $3.32 to $4.62 per share. Investors in BKEP *must* contact the conflicts committe and let your voice be heard."
DG Capital has top notch counsel. He deals in fraudulent transfer.https://brownrudnick.com/people/sigmund-s-wissner-gross/
