Where are the products to sell for BLUE?
Live on the call for BlueBird SVBLeerink presentation - Initial data suggests that patients have other gene mutations / classical drivers for AML present. More investigation in progress - but looks promising.
"single digits is coming, it is inevitable."
"That’s what you get, when you have incompetent CEO, $236 in 2018 to $18.5 in 2021!!!"
REGN has deal with BLUE (pricing BLUE at around $233) from 8/18 (link below) - now that REGN stock price has appreciated they can use that as a currency and buyout BLUE. :)https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bluebird-bio-regeneron-pharms/regeneron-to-invest-100-million-in-bluebird-jointly-develop-cancer-therapies-idUSKBN1KR18I
"Okay Crystal Blue Ball people. Spark tripled in value practically in 30 days. Blue much stronger and deeper program. here is how Spark was bought out- note the bidding war: December 2018. Spark CEO Jeffrey Marrazzo and Roche CEO Dr. Severin Schwan meet in Teterboro, N.J., where Schwan informs Marrazzo of Roche’s interest in exploring a potential acquisition of Spark. Later in the month, Roche makes an offer to buy Spark for $70 per share. The offer is deemed insufficient by Spark’s board. January 2019: Marrazzo sends an e-mail to Schwan suggesting that they talk after the 2019 J.P. Morgan Annual Healthcare Conference in San Francisco. Spark’s board, senior management and advisers, Centerview and Goodwin Procter, also meet at the conference. The company tells Roche its offer would need to be “well in the $80s” to be considered. Roche says it is interested in exploring further talks. Before the month ends, Spark’s newly formed transaction committee decides to contact two other potential buyers, both of which express an interest in a deal. Roche submits a new offer at $73 per share, which is again rejected by Spark’s board as inadequate.February 2019: Spark receives a $75 per share offer from “Party C,” whose identity is not disclosed. Spark decided to allow Roche and Party C access to a “virtual data room” to conduct additional due diligence. The other unnamed potential acquisition partner, ""Party A,"" informs Spark it is not prepared to make an offer. The company continues discussions with another company, referred to only as ""Party B,"" that it is in advanced talks regarding a potential hemophilia A collaboration, but not an acquisition. Before the month ends, Party B submits terms for a worldwide collaboration that includes a $450 million upfront payment. Party C submits a proposal to acquire Spark for $84 per share. Roche submits a proposal to buy Spark for $91 per share. Spark establishes a bidding proposal that results in Roche Holdings submitting a “revised final proposal” of $114.50 per share in cash. Party C submits a “revised final proposal” of $105 per share."
"I did not listen to every word of the investors conference, but a LOT of information, and a LOT of exciting stuff. New programs, the pipeline is full, and will only expand at this point. The biggest question that that did not address, is ""How do we make money?"" They are going to have some amazing products!! They will change lives!! They will ""cure"" diseases!! But, how does this all move into a profitable company for little investors. Maybe I missed that part of the presentation, but a lot of today was on research and all the new things that are figuring out and getting into. If they are not going to get bought out, when will they start making money? That is the question."
More good news! bluebird bio Presents New Data from Ongoing Phase 1/2 HGB-206 Study of LentiGlobin Gene Therapy for Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) at 61st ASH Annual Meeting and Exposition
If you feel good about BLUE sell at the money puts and buy at the money calls for Jan 23.
"The whole Lenti Globin thing simply sank the stock to the 20s from the 40s a cut of 50% on a patient developing cancer FIVE years after being treated in trial! Just ask yourself how often patients with that kind of composition would have developed cancer on their own?The co was being careful and responsible to announce it and halted the trial without external pressure and promptly was punished by the share price drop. FDA then jumped in to stop the trial.It is clearly seemingly an event not resulting from Blue bird. With the strong possibility of FDA approval of the drug partnered with BMY, the stage may be set for pharmas who had viewed BLUE as a potential acquisition to act now either before or after FDA approval in March taking advantage of the suddenly dropped price."
reality. the mirror don't lie.
"I was bullish on BLUE, but not as strong as what I used to be anymore. When management halted entire R&D because that one person got cancer, prices dropped more than 30%. After investigation to proved they have nothing to do with that, prices should recover but it didn’t. With this latest approval with BMY, prices should move higher but it didn’t.It seems like WS lost its faith and interest in this company and mainly because the management. Lastly, can someone tell me why they have a approved drug in Europe, that could generate tons money/profits, but management decided not to making any sales?What’s wrong with this company? This is why I am not so bullish on BLUE anymore, this became my worst investment ever."
"Biotech bag holders are a unique bunch. They hold on for far too long. They think a turnaround is just around the corner. Still others cite book value, value of patents, value of cash on hand. All this means little. BLUE is a dying biotech. There is still $18 in the stock. Get it before it is gone."
Why it is up in a down day?
Beti-cel BLA announced to come by third quarter. Means at most 3 weeks from now...
"Given the near 90% crash in stock price, and that the entire portfolio is now valued at somewhere between $600m and $700m (the rest of the value is cash), it's hard to believe there is going to be another leg down. If anyone wants to buy the stock (or the company, for that matter) now is the time to do it. A fair market price for the company is now $50-$75. We're talking $3.4B to $5.1B for this entire company. BMY or REGN could snap BLUE up with petty cash and not one BLUE shareholder would complain because the chances of BLUE seeing $50-$75 again on its own are minimal. Plus, I think I speak for everyone when I see it would be nice to never have to see or hear NL again."
This will doom crsp
And there it is ......Finally positive news and good results
"Nice activity today, bought a day early but oh well what's $2/share in the long term"
Still think if ever a buyout REGN. Saw something about 2 wks ago that Blue had 17 more products coming on line. The co. Seems so fishy overall like a make or break senario. Yeah tmrrw carries a lot of weight. Would love to see a ground swell movement like what happened with gme & amc swarm to vote Nick & board out. Can you imagine what would happen to blue if a CEO of the caliber of msft or nvda in the bio field took it over?
BLUE is up in a down day. Anybody Knows any thing?
"Have a feeling we're going lower hate to say it, but we're talking about Blue."
In for 250 shares at $19!!!
"What a let down. In such a promising industry, a former leader must really be hung up in the trees to self defeat like this. Glad I’m holding a diversified basket in the CRISPR industry."
I remember when this was a high flying Baker Bros stock. They loaded the boat in 2016 and sold in 2018 between 137 -181 a share with an average price of $159.59. I traded right along with them and purchased this stock in the twice in the high 20's and sold in the 30's. Pay attention when Baker's start selling shares. They will do it gradually and you won't know what hit you.
Good news is 10 percent of the shares are sold short so there is somebody to cover.
We are all to blame. The EGT court case told of all of the illegal wrongdoings. The stock was 200 and we refused to read the court documents. There should be jail time...
Guys its time to move on and buy Beam
"So, everyone got caught by Motley Fool article that CRSP will beat BLUE. Guys talking out of his other hole. CRSP is in P1.5 clinical trial and BLUE will complete BLA by mid-2021. Thought this was 7/1 so BLUE mgmt is it late.Here is excerpt from 6/11 PR (it's at the bottom of PR, net to last para):bluebird bio is on track to complete its rolling Biologics License Application (BLA) submission to the FDA for beti-cel in mid-2021. This submission is anticipated to include adults, adolescents and children with transfusion dependent β-thalassemia across all genotypes (including non-β0/β0 genotypes and β0/β0 genotypes). Beti-cel is not approved in the U.S.Here is the link: https://investor.bluebirdbio.com/news-releases/news-release-details/betibeglogene-autotemcel-beti-cel-one-time-gene-therapy-bGLTA in stock casino!"
"[[ ... Bluebird bio still plans to complete its data submission to FDA this year “pending resolution of the [FDA] hold,” Obenshain said Monday. Gregory added that given the debilitating effects of cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy and the risks involved in the only other treatment, bone marrow transplant, “We believe the benefit-risk profile of [the gene therapy] remains favorable.” Malik stresses that the safety concern revealed this week doesn’t diminish the benefits of the many lentivirus-based gene therapies approved or under investigation, which she notes have now been used to treat more than 300 patients with more than a dozen medical conditions. “This is a severe adverse event,” she says, but “we should never lose sight of the fact that so many patients … have been helped.” And the company’s finding could “help scientists and researchers design safer and better vectors for the future.” ...]]https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/08/gene-therapy-clinical-trial-halted-cancer-risk-surfaces?utm_campaign=news_weekly_2021-08-13&et_rid=16759399&et_cid=3882149"
Just browsing and notice how this stock went down. Wow. probably lots of bagholders on this board. GLTA.
"BMY paid 200m last year and now Shares costs/profits for Abecma in the U.S. this is good news that the FDA approved this drug, but I think the FDA is showing that they are willing to work with BLUE, and other biotechs, to bring drugs to market. I am sure y'all have seen the 8 week train wreck biotechs have experiencing and I think this news could turn the entire sector.next up resumption of LentiGlobin trials,last... blue has had extreme volatility over the years, with spikes to $200-250 and collapses back down. Now, I think there is a legit chance BLUE can start another spike, and stay strong."
"I hate that when CEO smile in front of the camera during last earning and said: All birds are doing fine I mean who gives a phaq about that Cuckoo's Nest? This company is sinking, SP proves that, and entire management should be held accountable."
"BLUE is undervalued and under covered. Look at the small volume of shares changing hand. Perfect time for gradual accumulation. Regardless buyout or not, it should move up gradually before the FDA decision in March. I believe there will be more data release before that, so these catalysts will move the shares, unless we receive FDA rejection which can always happen regardless how strong the data was.Will know in a couple months. Worth the wait."
"Look at the price of BLUE in 2018. It was over 200.00 a share. Who still holds this since the last 3 years? With the huge price crash of this stock, the day traders will take over and keep selling for quick profits for months. Many funds were forced to sell with the huge percentage drop so your only hope is for new funds to start the bio pump back up."
"What’s going on. This was a behemoth 5 yrs ago and it drop so badly, why?"
"I can't believe BMY isn't going to make a play here. This feels just like the CELG deal, where the stock fell through the floor and BMY just happened to be there with a saving offer. I feel BMYs fingerprints all over this brutal collapse.I'll be shocked if BLUE isn't taken out before the end of the year."
"No one really cares that they pulled out of Europe. It was obvious to everyone that Nick couldn't make the case for Zynteglo. And CALD is such a small market it's not worth the effort. Why is this part of the lede? Another hold sucks. But this hold is for a specially designed vector, a vector they don't use in any other program. It is an isolated incident. But the market doesn't see it that way, obviously, since this is now two holds in one year. It doesn't matter that the first hold was a false positive. They postponed the TDT filing to sometime in Q3. This after they said ""mid-2021"" in a press release in mid-June. This is just typical. This company has a blatant disregard for timelines and fessing up to their own incompetence. I'll believe this filing when I see it. In any event, TDT is a small market, with just 1,500-odd patients living with TDT in the US. This company needs to succeed with SCD. With 22k patients living with SCD, this is the biggest market for them. I don't honestly know what they mean when they say they'll give an update on SCD at the end of the year. That's even vaguer than a fake timeline. Previously, the company said mid-2022 for a renewed filing for SCD. Given that they are still focusing on the newly manufactured vector used in the phase 1/2 HGB-206 study (data update coming at ASH), I'm wondering if they will postpone filing until late-2023, when that study completes. That means, at best, they beat CRSP to market by a few months, and it also means that they will be at the end of their cash runway (so, more dilution to come before diving into a highly competitive market with better-capitalized competitors--the makings of a success story if ever I heard one, NOT ). Abecma did $24m in revenues (split 50/50) in Q2. That's something. I think the cancer division could be self-sustaining in two years. I think it's possible that they won't have to dilute shareholders further. But, that said, if Nick is in charge, I'm sure he'll dilute shareholders and pay himself a big bonus for making the deal. That's just the way it goes around here. Did I miss anything? What a lovely day."
We didn't even have to wait for the spin-off to fail to get diluted again. Lovely. This story just keeps getting better.
"What does PFE's acquisition of TRIL for $2.3 B say about the valuation of 2seventy? TRIL has about $291m in cash. It has two promising blood cancer compounds, but no approvals. TTI-621 and TTI-622 are both in phase one. 2seventy has its own blood cancer compound, CRB-402, to treat multiple myeloma. It too is in phase one. But 2seventy also has a potential blockbuster already on the market. Obviously, that is split with BMY. At $2.3B, 2seventy would be worth roughly $35 per share. For that, BMY would get a potential blood cancer drug, the other half of the Abecma revenue, and $400m in cash. I honestly don’t know why they wouldn’t just pull the trigger.More than anything, what this deal says to me is that big pharma sees good value in the small biotech oncology space. This is positive, I guess. I’m totally frustrated and completely disgusted with NL and his mismanagement of BLUE. Nevertheless, I still believe that there is unrecognized value here. And so we wait…"
"I do not understand. 3 weeks have passed since the release of their horrible report. what has been done during this time why hasn’t NL contacted the shareholders yet? on the chart, prices are constantly falling, many failed decisions have been made over the years, including entering the European market, which shows his inability to make decisions. Why is NL not responsible for this? Why does NL continue to perform poorly and not retire? why is the board of directors silent? where is the development strategy? the company continues to work as it did and slides into oblivion."
Down 15% in 5 days with no news and low colume....Very interesting. If I was hedging I would short CRSP and buy ADVM and BLUE...Both ADVM & BLUE are down 70-80% from peak while CRSP is down about 15%. Call it law of averages...Buy low and sell high...Good Luck to all and do your due diligence always...
I believe that shareholders and the board of directors should force Nick Leschly to leave. he is not able to manage the company well and make it profitable. this will be well received by investors. this is now one of his few steps that will make the price rise.
"Back up the truck and load up....Another good news and stocks down again...Unfortunately, BLA delay of a month is starting bite into uncertainty....Good Luck to all and do your due diligence always..."

"Boy, since 2018 this has gone from $200 to under $20. Amazing how this company has completely destroyed itself. What exactly are we getting when this finally splits? $5 companies each? Wow"
"Being among the most undervalued biotechs with plan to splitting the co into two to focus more closely on respective drug development will bring huge value to shareholders. Completion of separation will be carried out by the end of the year according to the announcement. If so, why it has announced almost a year ahead? I believe this is to indicate openly the co is for sale and the clear focus of the two current divisions can be bought separately. This will be much more appealing to any interested party to take the portion to fit its own operation. A very brilliant move. Quite likely one of the two divisions has already been spoken for by BMY pending FDA approval decision in March..If this recent move is to bring its value to that of its peers, Blue share will be at close to $100."
Yes 0.06% up after hours. LOL
"Yeah, I have never seen more than a few shares of BLUE moving in after hours... This was several thousand shares Bidding at a substantial premium to the days high. This is Definitely the most suspiciously positive after hours action I have yet seen to suggest that some kind of big news might be announced in short order..."
"We still have the Final EU approval news coming in less than 60 days.Also later this year the BB2121 update and potential SCD results. Lot of catalysts still around. With BLUE it seems like the sentiment takes hue swings on a monthly basis. BLUE usually bounces back. There was no fundamental issue this past week, and we took a huge cut in stock price. Biotechs in general got hit, but BLUE was hit harder. Volume is really low too, which means the trend is not widespread. Rough few days.....until we bounce...which we should."
Carful trying to catch this thing by the beak
Big action in the March 15 BLUE options at the $170 strike. Guess the options traders feel we are going higher...in the near term.
"If ever a suitor wanted to make a hostile bid, now seems the time. My guess is $42 a share would get a yes from all the institutional holders. and the buyer gets everything including half of all abecma sales for a net cost under $2B. $BMY - where are you?"
"That's what I thought, like I said few days ago every time Leschley shoots his mouth off we go down. Which proves no one trust or believes in him. Another reason he should resign now. Cuomo did."
buy blue today will get double money
"Possible buy in time, for those interested in the spin off. Jmho"
Why the company has over 1billion dollar on its balance sheet? Any thoughts?
https://cnb.cx/3vTlC47
Even Blue getting some action today!
"You would think abecma a block buster with bmy behind it, but I'll make a prediction I don't think the split will do anything might make things worse make everything weaker. More uncertainty we are in a bad place here it very much worry's me."
EGT and BLUE have reached a settlement. Curious if it is mentioned in the earnings report. I am guessing the $ amount is not disclosed...
"Ameritrade is still showing Earnings as Today in pre-market, -1.70 is the estimate... Will update if/when my screen updates from Estimate to Actual... (Go BLUE!!)"
No matter how you slice it there's just no hope.
"Unexpected small spike. ""Hope in the time of Blue."""
"Exits are hard to time. Onno van de Stolpe rode high for years after founding Galapagos. Yet, after presiding over a period in which Galapagos’ share price fell 80%, wiping out billions of dollars in value, van de Stolpe is hitting the exit on a low ebb—and leaving with the future of the biotech in doubt. Van de Stolpe founded Galapagos in 1999 and served as CEO from its early R&D days through to the commercial launch of filgotinib in Europe. Over that time, van de Stolpe guided Galapagos back from its jilting by AbbVie, landing deals with Gilead for JAK1 inhibitor filgotinib and later the $5 billion pact that looked to secure the independent future of his biotech. Barely two years after the second Gilead deal, Galapagos is searching for a way out of a predicament created by a series of R&D setbacks.Responsibility for leading the search will fall on a new CEO. Van de Stolpe, having seen his long-time chief scientific officer hand in his notice, is set to leave as CEO once a successor is appointed. An external search is now underway.Galapagos noted that the next CEO will have more of a science-focused background, RBC Capital Markets remarked in a Monday note. ""Though van de Stolpe was well-liked for his humility, integrity, and transparency, given the company's recent high-profile setbacks, we expect investors will view the potential for new leadership as an opportunity to bring in fresh perspectives as the company looks to rework their internal R&D processes,"" RBC's Brian Abrahams wrote. Shares in Galapagos rose 5% to above $58 in the wake of the news. Galapagos traded above $270 early last year. Since then, filgotinib has been shown to be a busted flush, going from a blockbuster in waiting to a drug with no future as a rheumatoid arthritis treatment in the U.S. in a matter of months. Things went from bad to worse as ziritaxestat failed a phase 3 idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis trial and Toledo, the SIK inhibitor program Galapagos has hyped for several years, underwhelmed in its first clinical test.The SIK inhibitor program may appear again, but, with midphase studies of the first candidate falling well short of expectations, it will be years before the preclinical prospects show whether Galapagos’ belief in the mechanism is justified. With cash in hand and the late-phase pipeline looking thin, Galapagos is planning to buy its way out of the predicament. RELATED: Gilead's $5B Galapagos black hole widens as pair tosses out phase 3 asset after flop""We expect Galapagos will continue to develop assets for novel targets but with new input from a science-oriented leader to help further mitigate risks and aim to enable better returns on pipeline investments,"" RBC said. Galapagos is looking for late-stage phase 2 or 3 assets in inflammation and fibrosis, which has been the biotech's core focus, according to Jefferies analysts. Gilead continues to have ex-EU opt-in rights through the companies' existing alliance, but the Big Pharma has indicated a willingness to finance a deal. The analysts, while acknowledging that van de Stolpe’s exit is unlikely to surprise people, raised concerns that the time spent on the search for a new CEO could limit “the likelihood of much needed meaningful near-term in-licensing deals for late-stage assets.”RBC expects the CEO search to be conducted with ""some urgency"" given the need to replace the CSO and conduct business development. Gilead will likely have a say in who becomes the next chief executive of Galapagos, given the company's two board seats. RELATED: Galapagos avoids 'complete whiff' as key anti-inflammatory drug fails to beat placebo in midphase trials""A new candidate could engage the Gilead partnership differently and potentially facilitate a restructuring and/or deeper integration of Gilead's expertise into Galapagos decision making,"" RBC said."
They better report some solid number. Market does not forgive any miss.
any price on the offering.
The stock closed up today.Now it's only 30% below it's 200day MA. There is no hope.
If U R retail trader dont touch this until mid Aug no need to help MM (market Manipulator) shorts. Buy it oon th eway up after a good news...Desperate attempt o keep price down...
Not much out of either JPM presentation. Nick did laughably say execution had been strong over the last year.
"Their BB2121 CAR should be approved by the end of next month. It will be the first BCMA CART approved for commercialization in the US. Even with new approval later this year, this asset alone will be worth the current market cap. Panic selling happens all the time. I see upside potential of 40-50% by April."
BLUE appears to be the latest MEME stock.
"SVB Leerink Downgrades bluebird bio to Market Perform From Outperform, Adjusts Price Target to $20 From $64"
The downward trend is not nice. Will wait for a further SP decline before revisiting. 
"@if nick mismanaged the company, why is he allowed to lead the new company"
U have to hand it to analysts and hedge fund opinions. Apparently 4 months suspension is all that separates from rest of pack to catch-up. I doubt it. Clinical trials and NDA takes quite a bit of time. 4 months is nothing. Real measure is when P3 is complete and NDA takes another 9-12 month to approve and usually not on first try...Company has products that are selling overseas...Under 30 is worth a gamble albeit small one. Biotech should always be small bets..Good Luck to all and do your due diligence always...
and another 100K shares to Nick. Must be for the massive shareholder value created
Bluebird intends to work with regulators with the goal to have the clinical hold for eli-cel lifted as soon as possible. The biotech company still thinks that it will be able to complete the U.S. regulatory submissions for the drug in treating beta-thalassemia and CALD this year
anything positive is non news. negativity matters.
The private placement is a big vote of confidence. This is trading at near cash value. Very little downside and lots of upside potential. Will accumulate a bit more here
"FDA releasing a PDUFA decision on Saturday March 27 does not make a lot of sense to me. FDA employees are not going to be working on a Saturday. So, it is my guess is that PDUFA news is released tomorrow (on Friday). Now, it could come after markets close but I think it will be tomorrow. So, now it is really a waiting game. The short and the longs have placed their bets. Time will tell who wins."
"There's lots of claptrap on here about analysts losing faith, but on this very page you can see that there are 20 covering BLUE, that a majority rate it either a buy or a strong buy, with an average target of $48. They know this company will ride its products to significant growth in the coming year. Buy and be patient. You will be rewarded."
Finally we have some volume. Very strong the last two days.
@max at split what will each company priced at?
"How bad has BLUE's stock performed relative to the sector? BLUE would have to trade at $75 right now to be flat with the XBI (biotech ETF).Interestingly, when you compare the two charts, BLUE's collapse from being put on Hold happened the same week the XBI peaked and started rolling over. Since then, BLUE has collapsed nearly 50%, while the XBI has dropped 28%. The XBI looks like it's trying to rally off the bottom. BLUE does not. The XBI is 27% above its yearly low. BLUE is a few pennies above its yearly low. There may very well be a rally coming for Biotech. I just don't know if there's a rally coming for BLUE. TDT remains the best bet to move the needle. But I just can't figure out where they are with it. Their silence is deafening. As for SCD, we're still looking at April next year as far as I can tell. And who knows if that moves the needle when they finally announce. They've lost any meaningful lead to better-financed companies with better technology. Twelve years and nothing to show for it is just so damning. As much as I absolutely loathe Nick, and I constantly marvel at his ability to be both completely incompetent and highly compensated, I think the move to outsource their manufacturing is actually smart. It's one thing to be incompetent, as Nick is, but it's another to be so stubborn that you can't acknowledge your own limitations. That National Resilience group is smart. They understand that people like Nick are idiots. And they have found a way to take advantage of them. Good for them. But Nick is at least smart enough to know that all his problems with regulatory (which go back to Zynteglo getting delayed for 18 months when they were told to ""tighten up"" their manufacturing processes) can now be smoothed over. And this may help. It doesn't help with their inability to get paid, another area of massive incompetence. But that will be on whoever acquires them. So, yeah, just another day in paradise."
"Evidence suggests the design of the viral vector contributed to the patient's cancer, Bluebird said in a news release."
Under $20 buy here
BMO raised price target to $192...and outperform. Cowen initiated coverage today with an outperform. Anyone know price target?
Why fresh new lows?
Any chance of a buy out now? Whoever gets this gem will be richly rewarded!
"If the SCD Data is positive on June 14th, we are looking at a major jump in the stock and valuation!"
looks like it's headed for a new all-time low. Nick must be celebrating.
Glad I sold this (for still a significant loss!) long ago! Wow....
"BLUE is marching towards full exoneration from this latest debacle. 1st patient has other reasons for the diagnosis - they were dosed 6 years ago, and vector presence is also limited.2nd Patient quite possibly is not even diagnosed correctly with MDS.Unfortunately these are very sick patients, and it's heart breaking to have such diagnosis.But it hopefully doesn't block the path for so many others to benefit from this treatment. The presentation and the way BLUE is handling is, very professional and rooted in solid science. It's not a done deal yet, but i was very optimistic after listening to their presensation."
BLUE Plant Mgr defected to BEAM.
You guys OK over here?
"I cannot believe that the potential FDA approval is approaching, while the stock is in red. What logic is controlling this stock?"
"Was listening to Motley Fool’s biotech presentation. As a reward for listening in,they promised to reveal the name of a sure shot biotech stock on the cusp of greatness. And that stock was.... drum roll.......BLUE !"
Something wrong going on today. 60 cents in green. How come? I hope things go on this way.
lowest closing price in 7 years
Blue where are you buddy ? Blue come home boy.
"Rather than 'crashing', BLUE is rocketing higher. With JUNO going for a cool $8 billion having only the third-to-market cellular immunotherapy for leukemia/lymphoma, BLUE looks undervalued to a potential acquirer interested in the blockbuster potential of their multiple myeloma, beta-thalassemia, and sickle cell disease treatments currently in pivotal trials."
Any reason why is it a bit up?
Are you prepared for 20 & under?
CRSP just reported. They say they will file an IND for TDT and SCD in 18-24 months. The end game is here. Every question for Nick on this upcoming CC should be about when they will file. They are out of time.
"I put an order in to buy more at $17.50. If not today, I'm sure it'll get there tomorrow or the day after. I don't see it making new all-time lows. I just don't."
"new 52 week low, <4% above all time low. Nice work, Nick"
Buying Anab now.Is in talks with GSK and several others for buy out.
Bring a $3B bid to buy this babe now! I'd vote for $3B now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"I think $20 is the ceiling until they file for TDT ""in the next few months"" if we can believe anything these people say (hint: you can't)."
Definitely should have bought on the big dip. Itchy feeling shares wish to bounce back on technicals.
Now for the dead cat bounce.
"Two months ago, I predicted blue Stock would go to ""33 to 36 dollars"" on the news of the lifting of the clinical hold. Even my cynical prediction was too optimistic, as it only went to 32. But, as I've been saying for months, all anyone had to do was look at QURE's price action when its clinical hold was lifted to get a preview. And, what do you know? QURE went up a measly 3% when its clinical hold was lifted....The exact same response as BLUE. BLUE just has to PROVE it has a pathway to profitability. It has to sell drugs, and not just get them approved. Nothing else is going to move this stock."
"I am bleeding badly in this stock depite they able to get important approval, management is cause.They giving up market before even trying is unherd specially when treatment consider breakthough treatment.They should atleast give fair try before give up such big market."
"Not sure what to make of this alliance with Resilience and the transfer of their manufacturing facility to Resilience. I guess costs go down in short run, but if they bring drugs to market, wouldn't the costs go up if they have to contract out for drug production."
well time to start a position ....as such srtp as will blue birdie !
This is worst investment. I will stay away from this. Cash burning rate is so high. I can take chance at $5.
"Institutions are continuing to buy. I am guessing they are hedged to the down side, but not sure. Certainly some have jumped out, but JP Morgan for example, doubled their position over the last six months.It take balls, but maybe it is the right thing to do. Nick still needs to go.....he is a disaster."
Are the senior managers in a coma or so? No response at all?
"The presentation was pretty impressive - I think he made it clear that there are a lot of things in the pipeline. He also mentioned that BLUE is historically very quiet about their research, but they are learning to get better at that art. Hinting that people don't appreciate the scope of research that's going on there."
With slow growth in EU can you imagine where the market would be today if Trump wouldn't have jumped all over Powell.
"shorts are just talking their position and trying to instill fear. blue has multiple positive news stories this last 4 weeks, plenty of cash, solid research.... it'll simply be bought out for $38-40"
I’m guessing they are pulling as much preliminary data as they can find to show us all is still ok. Maybe a publication also on lenti-g safety.
"So, I listened again to the webcast presentation of bluebird of March 10, and it is clear that bluebird had yet to file any formal Complete Response to Clinical Hold. Indeed, before that would even be possible, bluebird would have to complete its study of the MDS case to determine whether that was MDS and/or caused by the vector. Over and over again, Nick said that bluebird was ""engaged"" with the FDA and that there was a ""back-and-forth"" going on with the FDA, and he refused to even put a timeline on the regulatory side as he said until their data analysis was complete for the MDS case, they couldn't even begin the process of applying to lift the clinical hold. Nick also said they were on the ""tail end"" of the data collection for the AML case, and that they would do ""confirmatory"" work for that AML case. Anyway, after listening to the call, it confirmed that there is a zero percent chance that anything will happen by April 10. And, given we've yet to hear any further information on the MDS case, it might even be a safe assumption that that data collection and review is still ongoing, and that we are not even within the 30 day window yet for the bluebird to file, and the FDA to review a Complete Response to Clinical Hold. So, hopefully, by the end of this month that ball gets rolling, and the Hold gets lifted by the end of May."
Making lemons out of lemonade. You would think lifting the suspension would be a positive but I guess having no sales is better than disappointing sales.
Holding up pretty good considering the index selling.
"Glad I took an L at the $30s to invest elsewhere, this company is awful"
I think they will sell the non-cancer half of the company

HOW IS CHIEF BLUEBIRD TODAY? LOL
"So, the press release about the Regeneron deal didn't specify what percentage of targets would be eligible to be partnered targets (upon a regeneron opt-in) and what percent would only be able to be wholly owned by bluebird. It turns out that roughly 50% of the ""programs"" (which could mean something different than 50% of the targets) will be wholly owned by bluebird, and not be eligible for 50/50 profit sharing by regeneron. That fact makes me like the deal even more (and I already loved the deal). Here's the best story I've read so far on the collaboration: http://www.bioworld.com/content/regeneron-bluebird-all-cancer-cell-therapies"
"value destroyed. $25.00 offer and it would be approved on a buyout. common holders get smacked while a large bio can take the cash, take the pipe/research, and fire/shutter everything."
I interviewed there a few years ago and asked is they were concerned with their editing technology and LVV having an affinity to insert at Stop codons and other critical sequences that tell cells to stop producing and growing (ie tumor concern?). Their bio safety officer asked “how do you know that” and I said “Harvard-Yale bio safety symposium). Needless to say I didn’t get the job…thank god. Less than 9% of gene therapy companies invest in Genentech editing…wonder why.
Is BLUE a buy-out target after the secondary?
New study reveals fresh safety concern linked to CRISPR gene editing. Now they know how we feel?
"$59.00 to $43.00 on the FDA wanting 1 year more of data... $43.00 to $25.00 on fear of a negative cancer response in 2 patients. 1) looks highly likely that the cancer was not the result of the treatment. 2) we are 3.5 months into that extra year of follow up data.for those willing to buy/hold i'd say there are good odds that BLUE recovers to $40-45.00 or 35-50% returns. I believe by December there are high odds we are back to the $60.00 range or 100% return.... finally, positive trial data and i think BLUE is $75.00-80.00 when they file. Lastly.... Approval and i think BLUE is $125.00-150.00. considering that they sit on 1.1b of cash, this is one of those scratch off lottery tickets where everyone wins some sort of prize!"
"It’s approved, we shall see how prices going to reflect on Monday, hopefully it recovers the early losses, I say at least 30% pop"
"I can't wait for BLUE to announce that FDA has given them a 'green light' to resume their trials. It is coming and it probably will happen soon (maybe this week). So, couple that announcement along with the pending approval of their PDUFA on March 27th and you have a recipe for dramatic price movements upward. So, lean back, relax and let this news play out. I know I will."

"This is indeed very very good news. Not just because i am BLUE shareholder and a BMY shareholder. It is very good news mostly for all those suffering from Multiple Myeloma.

I wouldn't be surprised if Nick ditches an actual call and just does a press release Q2
"11.8 vs 12 months. Please we saw this with Kite and Juno. They will adjust and get there. Did a little trading after hours. Staying long, Monday may see a different light - the stuff works its just takes time to get it perfect. FDA would have not told them to speed it up if it wasn't a winner."

Abecma was approved by the U.S. FDA in March of this year. The peak sales for Abecma are estimated to be around $2 billion."

"The Jefferies analysts puts the peak sales for Skysona at just $74 million. That's why no one cares. It's such a small market that it just doesn't move the needle. Again, approvals are great, but sales would be better. Maybe some day."

"Just listened to CC, and BLUE is done with their review of the one incident. That is great news, but we still need the FDA and Europe to lift holds. This WILL happen, and that is good, but we are not sure when.Hopefully, this is just the start of good news. ;-)"
"EC approval for Skysona. No one cares. Why? I don't think anyone believes they will be able to make a deal with the payors, that is, Skysona is likely Zynteglo part deux. Hope I'm wrong.

Hi Max. I am stuck here and badly. I have seen your posts and you seem like an intelligent dude. What do we do here? As you mentioned the stock price reminds me of Tesoro and celgene before they got acquired. Fully build manufacturing facility and spin-off upcoming. How can this not be primed for buyout? They don’t seem like they have a plan to survive as a stand-alone company. Question based on the science and synergies who would benefit from tucking in this company? I am ready to start an activist campaign to push for this outcome. My losses and purchase price are scary here. It’s insane. Misery loves company bro. How deep are you here. You said you would buy more at $25. Well here we are. Are you? Should I ? My wife doesn’t know the mess I am in here. Luckily I have Luckin coffee to bail me out somewhat. Good luck man and keep posting.
I hope I can recup my losses with Anab.GSK and others are trying to buy out Anab. StreetInsider confirmed that meeting are going on.Since a few days...hardly any volume...it wont take that long.Let see...
"Recap of the ""value"" of start up biotech co's like BLUE. Yesterday's buyout of CELG by BMY is the first volley of a major M&A spree in the pharma sector. The large companies need to enter the areas of gene editing, immuno oncology and CAR T. Bill George, former CEO of Medtronic, gave a rather lengthy rationale of why big pharma ""must"" acquire the start up biotech co's in these areas. He said the large price tags for these small companies are more than worth the risk...and...are MUST haves or be left behind. He did an amazing job at Medtronic and served on the board of Novartis for quite some time. He is an industry insider and knows his business. Investors in companies like BLUE tend to agree with him. Btw....I overstated CELG's valuation of their share of bb2121...it is more like $2.71 billion. Blue has again become a target....and...a rather valuable one. GLTA"

"current sp brings back nostalgic memories for me; I bought blue at 22 in Jan 2014, saw it go down to today's levels (17.50 or so) within several weeks; I sold at 105 in Feb 2015 (13 months later); had I held on 3 more months I could have sold it at 205; still the best personal trade ever for me........unfortunately, this go-around we are unlikely to see a bounce back to 100; I am with GBT, I have been touting on the boards for a while now that both gene therapy and gene editing are not practical, nor cost effective for scd; sexy stuff when scientific american publishes articles about how the gene therapy/editing will cure scd but look at the costs and also the capability/mindset of scd patients; only 40% covid vaccinated, very conservative, do you think they will line up for gene editing/therapy? incredibly expensive and will never be practical, neither of the two; oral tablets are the way to go; gbt601, the successor to oxbryta could be a potential functional cure given its greater efficacy at much lower doses; i concur with brad loncar who posited what i had to say above;"
don't panic guys. BLUE is a gem.
"No new news on insider selling by Mark Vachon (on the am of Dec11 - before stock offering announced to public), but an article in The Ledger Gazette was published on Dec 24. If yahoo lets me post the link, here it is. I had mentioned this in prior posts, but here it is in print. The Ledger Gazzette published the insider selling by Jeffrey Walsh, CFO and Strategy Officer Mark Vachon is on Blue's board. https://ledgergazette.com/2017/12/24/mark-vachon-sells-7000-shares-of-bluebird-bio-inc-blue-stock.html. CEO Nick Lechly sold a lot of shares, AFTER the stock offering was announced; he sold at an average of about $186. No complaints about the CEO selling. But the other 2 guys should be investigated by the SEC. IMHO"

"I listened to the call from yesterday. It seems we will know within weeks if Blue's drugs are to blame. As per mgmt, there are several possible reasons for this and one of patients was treated over 5 years back. They seems cautiously confident - but obviously didn't want to minimize the possiblity of the worst case scenario. It does seem like, by the time ide-cel approval comes through, we will know more about this as well. If ide-cel is approved, Blue stock should be double of this price. The oncology side is still on track for separation and hopefully bought by BMS."
JUNO got bought for 10 billion BLUE is much more robust!$400 sooner than later JUNO was red for along time before it got bought and doubled.
Seems like a nice entry point. Cheers.
I looked at the data and institutions are in fact net buyers and have been for a little while. Put that with a couple of pieces of toast and you still wouldn't have a sandwich.
Company should be shut down selling therapy and drugs at prices only the rich can afford. Maybe they would be making money if they priced them at an affordable price.

"For those who missed the Gilead earnings yesterday, the post earnings commentary highlighted certain stocks that are potential buyouts (by anyone, not just Gilead). Top of the list are Bluebird, Crispr, Editas, Intellia, then some others with less potential. All these 4 stocks spiked up after hours then this morning (CRSP was up 20% before falling back to...now 13% up). All of these stocks are pulling back from their highs today. Bluebird is certainly top of my list and added a bunch of shares that I had lost on a stop price (really rookie move). Celgene sold a lot of its Crispr shares because Juno (the company they bought if you've been asleep for the past few months). Juno has a strong collaboration with Editas Medicine. Bayer bought the Crispr shares that Celgene owns. Editas holds the Crispr patents, but did not go up as much as Crspr (I think that Crspr is further along in its trials but don't quote me on that). So, there you have it. I am convinced that Bluebird will be bought out, but this spike is not indicative of pending buyout (not that anyone knows about). I got burned with a stop, so not selling. BOTTOM LINE: DON'T SELL. YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN A BUY WILL HAPPEN, BUT IT WILL HAPPEN --imho."
"I have to laugh when I look at BLUE's chart. It was in a downtrend for 18 months. The day before earnings, it actually peaked above the trend. It LOOKED like it was getting ready for blastoff (which is why I added to my position) and then....we got Nicked. The next long-term buy point is $35-$38. I just don't see any reason to buy it here. Perhaps shareholders can put some pressure on Nick to give up his salary and not take any more options and stock compensation given that, oh, you know, he has destroyed billions of dollars of shareholder wealth. A guy can dream."
"Sum of the parts will be worth more than the whole. As we head into the second half of the year, we will see two things: 1) the biotech space correction will have run its course 2) the IB’s will begin their work on hyping the separate companies . I look to see the sum of the two companies to be worth quite a bit more than today’s whole. As each new entity becomes more focused, they will independently become better acquisition targets which will in turn drive valuations"

The market is clearly correcting. And the first stocks to get thrown overboard are the junk stocks. BLUE is a junk stock. No earnings. Huge losses. Questionable prospects going forward. Decidedly mediocre leadership (I'm being kind here). The only question is how low it goes when the generals start correcting. I don't see it trading below $18. But I honestly won't be shocked if it drops below the $24.25 low set a few months back.

"Surprise early Ocean delivery date!?!?!? This morning Henrik Fisker put out three (3) tweets that he later deleted. The most critical stated… “Fisker Ocean will start deliveries in November next year, in both US & Europe ! Matte blue will be a launch color! .#Fisker #love #EVs #ESG #blue #screen” I did get a screen shot of this tweet. I do not know if he deleted the tweet because it was an early delivery secrete he was not supposed to release, or if it had an impossible timeline, considering the public announcement thus far is that assembly would start on Nov. 17, 2022. For deliveries to be occurring in the US on even the last day of November 2022, the 30th, that would mean that manufacturing would have to begin, at minimum, a month earlier, Oct. 17, 2022 than publicly announced. It will take at least a month to; build the cars, test them, get them to port (Trieste, Italy is closest), get them on a boat, 14 day Atlantic float, clear customs, distribute them by rail or semi from port.In the two other separate tweets today, Henrik tweeted that the Ocean will come with a 17” screen and standard 20” rims, with a 22” rim option."
I know I'm going to make a lot of people on this board angry but as a long term holder I have to brace myself with the possibility that even though the news looks good it could open lower or pop then crater. Seen it happen so many times. Sell the news?

"Abecma gets conditional approval in the EU (ex the UK). That's good for Blue. Oh, wait, they already sold the EU rights for $200m so, in the immortal words of Willie Wonka, they ""...get NOTHING!"" That said, the EU gave conditional approval for a fourth line, that is, after the three standards of care fail. The FDA approval was for the fifth line. So, BLUE doesn't get any money from this, but the approval for the fourth line is probably good for the stock as it shows that Abecam can (perhaps) quickly work its way up the treatment list. Nah. Why would I think the stock could go up? That's what got me into this mess in the first place."

"No pain, no gain! Blue will win! See Barron's comments below""The thalassemia gene therapy was approved in June by regulators in Europe, where it is being marketed as Zynteglo. But the first patients are only now being treated, because of the Covid-19 pandemic and lengthy negotiations with government health agencies over reimbursement for the one-time treatment.With each of the rival programs showing effectiveness, many analysts think bluebird will enjoy an advantage given its head start. At Mizuho Securities, analyst Difei Yang thinks bluebird is far undervalued. He rates the shares a Buy and says the stock can more than double, to $123.RBC Capital Markets analyst Luca Issi sees pros and cons in the different techniques used by the rivals, but sees no evidence yet that those differences will matter in the clinic. But with Crispr up fourfold since March, to a $10 billion market capitalization, Issi sees the stock as priced for perfection. """

"This company has billion dollar on hand and I was checking BMY CVR (I hold them as well from CELG merger) and I thought if one of 3 meet goal then BMY will pay some cash but what I found was surprise.CVR stands for Contingent Value Right. This CVR will entitle you to receive a one-time potential payment of $9.00 in cash upon Federal Drug Administration (FDA) approval in specified indications of all three of the following milestones:ozanimod by December 31, 2020,liso-cel (JCAR017) by December 31, 2020, andide-cel (bb2121) by March 31, 2021.If the CVR milestones are not all achieved, no payment will be made, and the CVRs will expire.So BMY ready to pay huge amount and CELG board ready to accept $9 with all 3 as contingency means each of asset worth Billions to BMY. ($9 is about $7B in payout)Now this is only 1 of many in pipeline of BLUE and all those them have very good clinical result. so why such sell off?"
some newly hired employee just got a ton of stock at a killer price

"Already seeing bids of $209+ in pre-market, maybe the tailwinds of the conference will push BLUE back up to the 220's today!! :)"
BLUE will sloly but surely get back to the mid $40s.. Shorts are controlling the price while covering that's all. Been telling you that since the halt was lifted...Just hold and check back in a couple weeks.

"three times normal volume, triple option expiration. big players wanted in, but they wanted in on their price- they would take a million shares, but not at 200, they wanted to pay 184. Market maker took out all the stops, and got the selling going . same thing with JUNO before buyout. now the sellers are potentially out. Stop losses out. 185 is your floor, just like 178 was your floor for the last month. 9 billion is NOT a high market cap for the potential of this company. Their therapy in combination with other programs could lead to a cure for many types of cancer-- think about a cure for cancer . What would a company like that be worth?"
Looks like lifting clinical hold meant nothing. can't find a bottom
"I haven't been this confident about a single stock since I owned Abgenix (bought by Amgen in 2005). I bought some more shares in extended hours trading today at 194, and increased my position post-ASCO by 21.4%. As I mentioned in Mid-may, I believed that this EHA event was going to be the BIG news, and that ASCO wasn't going to be a significant mover of the stock. I continue to have a strong conviction that the data will be great. Hopefully, SCD data shows five or six ""functional cures."" Fingers crossed. Good luck...."
Burning through 100 million cash per quarter with no results. Too late to be sold. Their survival rate is lower than those of their patients.
"From SA: Updated results from a Phase 2/3 clinical trial, Starbeam, evaluating bluebird bio's gene therapy Lenti-D in patients with a rare severe inherited disorder called cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy (CALD) showed a sustained treatment effect. The data were presented at the European Pediatric Neurology Society Congress in Athens.Treated patients remained free of major functional disabilities (MFDs) for as long as five years (and counting) with no reports of graft failure or treatment-related deaths. No new safety signals have been observed.The study is assessing the safety and efficacy of autologous CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells transduced with Lenti-D lentiviral vector encoding human adrenoleukodystrophy protein. In other words, stem cells are extracted from the patient, modified with Lenti-D, then infused back into the patient after myeloablative conditioning (bone marrow activity is intentionally decreased to reduce the risk of complications).88% (n=15/17) of treated patients who reached or would have reached 24 months' follow-up and completed the study are still alive and MFD-free.Development is ongoing."
"BUSINESS SEPARATIONIn January 2021, bluebird announced its intent to separate into two independent, publicly traded companies (bluebird bio and 2seventy bio). The company expects the separation to be completed by the end of 2021 and to be tax-free to bluebird shareholders.why separate the company into 2 offering a tax free benefit to shareholders unless one half has been sold?"
New Dilema…. Sell and buy lower near all book value or hold….. looks like holding is the best option. Unbelievable 25% SP decline. Not happy and not averaging down at this point.
The question on everyone's mind is how low do we go? I have no idea. The billion dollars everyone thinks is the saving grace will be whittled down along with the sp.
doesn’t this company have something like $17 per share in cash. plus an approved product. plus a deep pocketed partner.
There is no interest in this stock very small volume. I'm hoping for a buy out as the stock price gets cheaper in value by the day.
Juno doubled after being driven down. same with Blue--only slooowww mootttioon . look at the chart. we are headed to $250 buy out
street giving blue the bird
Looking for $2.70
BLUE. 1B CASH... so you can buy the company and get teh cash value plus the rest of the company for 300-400b. seems like the market is saying they are done. might as well sell the pipeline & call it a day. pathetic. foolish that i thought $31.00 was good value.
Around 2M+ shares shorted in last month. It explains the PPS drop...Someone wsi betting big on PPS drop despite all the good news in last months....Look for pro forma earnings in 2Q ER. Last year's 2Q had unusual bump due to one time event. Should look for steady recovery in Revenue from 1Q21 & 4Q20...Good LUck to all and do your due diligence always...
"One step forward, two step backward."
Strange the Blue drops 3% while it's a clear threat to Crispr. Some of that CRSP money should be flowing into Blue. Not sure what negative conclusions everyone drew from this. NYT article was positive too. Who is selling based on good news?
"Like many of you I have been lucky with KITE, JUNO and now BLUE. Any thoughts on the next Biotech stock to invest in?"
Institutional holdings going up steady past few weeks. dont be surprised to see a blast back over $30.00 here soon
"SP decreased by almost 50% in about 6 month......I'm speechless. Are there any long still here? If you are still long this, what's the reason?"
What did Gene Editing do- took away the sails of several Gene Therapy Drug Companies with Hudred M to over Billion dollar pipelines- Why? Ask this before you sell your stock at a lower price than what you bought for- taking profits is fine with me: 2021 so far been quite bad year for trad gene tx..-from 52 week high (VYGR ADVM both -EV)$VYGR -72%$ADVM -85%$QURE -43%$BLUE -54%$avro -57%$PASG -56%$GBIO -53%$SRPT -59%
Short term technicals: As you are all aware...we broke above trend line...yay!!! 50 day MA now sits above 200 day MA. Longterm RSI still at 67....short term RSI dropped to 50 as a result of yesterday's sell off...yay!!! Now we are ready to move higher. Maybe NOT today...but in the near term (next few weeks) we are heading into the 170's....just my opinion based on the chart. With most of the shorts out at this point we can regain the ground we lost last year...at least a big chunk of it. GLTA. Great week for longs!!!
"if the news of the approval is baked in, and I do not think it is, we are soon to be generating cash. The gene editing process that BLUE uses will soon be understood to be applicable to many other genetic disorders. This approval may have been expected, but certainly has a lot more to go. BLUE will be taken out, as it could prove to be ""priceless"" in the future. (yes I am long, and yes, I think BLUE will start to move outside of the general ""IBB"" stock trend.) we shall see. "
Absolutely agree with the previous poster. Totally mismanaged company and always has been.
"With 1 bil in cash, how can this company valuation be 1.2 bil on stock price of 18.50$."
It’s buying time on weakness and technicals. Everyone seems so complacent of the SP direction with few shares outstanding (67.5 million) and fewer “trading”. Jmho
Feel like I'm at the airport in Afghanistan trying to get out!
"Insiders sold their shares at 53$, then the news came out and the stock collapsed. On 18 feb they acquired shares. Another fact: individuals with sickle cell anemia have increased chance of leukemia. The question was it a manipulation"
"So I didn't say anything bad about you either. Biotech stocks are a high risk. The Director performs his duties based on common sense. I bought the first time for $19.5. The day before yesterday I sold at $18.5, yesterday I bought again at $17.6. With a further fall, I will increase my share in the deposit. According to your logic, the Chinese president is also not good, because Chinese stocks have fallen? Are you used to everything having to grow? What do you say when the rest of the American stock market collapses? Will you jump from a skyscraper?)))"
Basic fundamentals. Market Cap 1.8 Billion. Cash position( securities/ equivalents) 1.0 Billion. As of Mar 2021Company spin offInvestment worth it. cheers.
"$BLUE uses an entirely different technology when compared to $BEAM, $CRSP, $EDIT and $NTLA. $BLUE was using a gene therapy that was much older and less precise. Today you can pick up bargins in gene editing stocks. Good luck to everyone. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pcYlTR_mh8 . The underlying gene editing technologies used by $BEAM, $CRSP, $EDIT and $NTLA is still sound."
Private placement from investment firm = legit oversight at the board level. Finally
"This is how you do it:Velodyne Lidar Inc's founder David Hall on Monday called on Chairman Michael Dee to resign from the sensor maker's board, blaming him for a steep fall in the company's stock price.""Dee has spearheaded major business decisions that leave him responsible for the company's nearly 80% stock price decline, in my view,"" Hall, who was removed as chairman earlier this year, said in an letter to the board.Where is this for BLUE? #NickMustGo"
"end of quarter window dressing has funds dumping it so they don't have to tell investors they held this dog this quarter, funds will buy after June 30"
EDIT with no product approval and two years behind gene therapy SP 66.With FDA approval Blue sp went from 30 to 19.Well done job!!! More stock for Nick .
after Europe sudden approval ...no reason for the selling unless someone with a lot of money (short) is really scared from the this news and the coming ones...
"Use what's left of your money and by Organon. It has the right management, philosophy, products and spends the money where needed-------> research and development."
Is there any other gene therapy company that has more TDT patients signed on to their trials and showed higher efficacy over longer period than BLUE? They had 51 patients enrolled showing 100% efficacy after 7 years? Does that not count for something
how does ceo smile with a straight face to investors?
MRD-neg results are fabulous!!!
Truly outstanding.
2 seventy to be bought out for $55.00/share
"now BLUE is for SALE! make a bid!!!!!!!!!!!!!! $40 is fair, take it!!!!!!"
"A contrarian voice in the wilderness: MIZUHO SECURITIES THINKS BLUEBIRD BIO’S STOCK IS GOING TO RECOVER""In a report released today, Difei Yang from Mizuho Securities maintained a Buy rating on Bluebird Bio with a price target of $70.00.""-I'm looking for other rating changes."
"Just updated after the approval. Morgan Stanley Maintained at $45, SVB Leerink Outperform up to $72, Mizuho Securities up to $70. Not bad."
Nice FDA approved! next week is the approval to continue the research shooting this back to 100$. Don't miss the boat!
Has anyone heard when we should expect the spin off?
