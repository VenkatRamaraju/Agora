This is worst investment. I will stay away from this. Cash burning rate is so high. I can take chance at $5.

when will blue meet cvls?vote.
SA saying EMA finds no relationship between BBIRD Zynteglo and AML....WHY WE ARE DOWN AGAIN ??????????????????????
Institutional holdings going up steady past few weeks. dont be surprised to see a blast back over $30.00 here soon
lowest closing price in 7 years
Do you think there are plans for blue to be acquired?
Does anyone know how current shares will split in October to 270 and bluebird? Thank you
how does ceo smile with a straight face to investors?
Will Nick resign at the investor event?
"hold on, NTLA disease is likely contagious for all gene editing stocks."
"new 52 week low, <4% above all time low. Nice work, Nick"
The downward trend is not nice. Will wait for a further SP decline before revisiting. 
Yes 0.06% up after hours. LOL
ugh. the long hard slog of investors in biotech
My buy price is below 25 when MMS have finish shorting and then they will have to cover n the way up. Unfortunately shorting over period results in margins calls everyday...Good Luck to all and do your due diligence always....
"SP decreased by almost 50% in about 6 month......I'm speechless. Are there any long still here? If you are still long this, what's the reason?"
"How bad has BLUE's stock performed relative to the sector? BLUE would have to trade at $75 right now to be flat with the XBI (biotech ETF).Interestingly, when you compare the two charts, BLUE's collapse from being put on Hold happened the same week the XBI peaked and started rolling over. Since then, BLUE has collapsed nearly 50%, while the XBI has dropped 28%. The XBI looks like it's trying to rally off the bottom. BLUE does not. The XBI is 27% above its yearly low. BLUE is a few pennies above its yearly low. There may very well be a rally coming for Biotech. I just don't know if there's a rally coming for BLUE. TDT remains the best bet to move the needle. But I just can't figure out where they are with it. Their silence is deafening. As for SCD, we're still looking at April next year as far as I can tell. And who knows if that moves the needle when they finally announce. They've lost any meaningful lead to better-financed companies with better technology. Twelve years and nothing to show for it is just so damning. As much as I absolutely loathe Nick, and I constantly marvel at his ability to be both completely incompetent and highly compensated, I think the move to outsource their manufacturing is actually smart. It's one thing to be incompetent, as Nick is, but it's another to be so stubborn that you can't acknowledge your own limitations. That National Resilience group is smart. They understand that people like Nick are idiots. And they have found a way to take advantage of them. Good for them. But Nick is at least smart enough to know that all his problems with regulatory (which go back to Zynteglo getting delayed for 18 months when they were told to ""tighten up"" their manufacturing processes) can now be smoothed over. And this may help. It doesn't help with their inability to get paid, another area of massive incompetence. But that will be on whoever acquires them. So, yeah, just another day in paradise."
New study reveals fresh safety concern linked to CRISPR gene editing. Now they know how we feel?
Volume is gone.And now we wait...for...something positive...if that's even possible. Wake me up in November.
I interviewed there a few years ago and asked is they were concerned with their editing technology and LVV having an affinity to insert at Stop codons and other critical sequences that tell cells to stop producing and growing (ie tumor concern?). Their bio safety officer asked “how do you know that” and I said “Harvard-Yale bio safety symposium). Needless to say I didn’t get the job…thank god. Less than 9% of gene therapy companies invest in Genentech editing…wonder why.
Buying Anab now.Is in talks with GSK and several others for buy out.
CRSP just reported. They say they will file an IND for TDT and SCD in 18-24 months. The end game is here. Every question for Nick on this upcoming CC should be about when they will file. They are out of time.
Any reason why is it a bit up?
HOW IS CHIEF BLUEBIRD TODAY? LOL
Why it is up in a down day?

The private placement is a big vote of confidence. This is trading at near cash value. Very little downside and lots of upside potential. Will accumulate a bit more here
Heading to $10
"Given the near 90% crash in stock price, and that the entire portfolio is now valued at somewhere between $600m and $700m (the rest of the value is cash), it's hard to believe there is going to be another leg down. If anyone wants to buy the stock (or the company, for that matter) now is the time to do it. A fair market price for the company is now $50-$75. We're talking $3.4B to $5.1B for this entire company. BMY or REGN could snap BLUE up with petty cash and not one BLUE shareholder would complain because the chances of BLUE seeing $50-$75 again on its own are minimal. Plus, I think I speak for everyone when I see it would be nice to never have to see or hear NL again."
"Surprise early Ocean delivery date!?!?!? This morning Henrik Fisker put out three (3) tweets that he later deleted. The most critical stated… “Fisker Ocean will start deliveries in November next year, in both US & Europe ! Matte blue will be a launch color! .#Fisker #love #EVs #ESG #blue #screen” I did get a screen shot of this tweet. I do not know if he deleted the tweet because it was an early delivery secrete he was not supposed to release, or if it had an impossible timeline, considering the public announcement thus far is that assembly would start on Nov. 17, 2022. For deliveries to be occurring in the US on even the last day of November 2022, the 30th, that would mean that manufacturing would have to begin, at minimum, a month earlier, Oct. 17, 2022 than publicly announced. It will take at least a month to; build the cars, test them, get them to port (Trieste, Italy is closest), get them on a boat, 14 day Atlantic float, clear customs, distribute them by rail or semi from port.In the two other separate tweets today, Henrik tweeted that the Ocean will come with a 17” screen and standard 20” rims, with a 22” rim option."
What did Gene Editing do- took away the sails of several Gene Therapy Drug Companies with Hudred M to over Billion dollar pipelines- Why? Ask this before you sell your stock at a lower price than what you bought for- taking profits is fine with me: 2021 so far been quite bad year for trad gene tx..-from 52 week high (VYGR ADVM both -EV)$VYGR -72%$ADVM -85%$QURE -43%$BLUE -54%$avro -57%$PASG -56%$GBIO -53%$SRPT -59%
Around 2M+ shares shorted in last month. It explains the PPS drop...Someone wsi betting big on PPS drop despite all the good news in last months....Look for pro forma earnings in 2Q ER. Last year's 2Q had unusual bump due to one time event. Should look for steady recovery in Revenue from 1Q21 & 4Q20...Good LUck to all and do your due diligence always...
same as every other day. wait till March 22 for any mess to clear ..
The market is clearly correcting. And the first stocks to get thrown overboard are the junk stocks. BLUE is a junk stock. No earnings. Huge losses. Questionable prospects going forward. Decidedly mediocre leadership (I'm being kind here). The only question is how low it goes when the generals start correcting. I don't see it trading below $18. But I honestly won't be shocked if it drops below the $24.25 low set a few months back.
"now BLUE is for SALE! make a bid!!!!!!!!!!!!!! $40 is fair, take it!!!!!!"
BLUE is up in a down day. Anybody Knows any thing?
"I think $20 is the ceiling until they file for TDT ""in the next few months"" if we can believe anything these people say (hint: you can't)."
U have to hand it to analysts and hedge fund opinions. Apparently 4 months suspension is all that separates from rest of pack to catch-up. I doubt it. Clinical trials and NDA takes quite a bit of time. 4 months is nothing. Real measure is when P3 is complete and NDA takes another 9-12 month to approve and usually not on first try...Company has products that are selling overseas...Under 30 is worth a gamble albeit small one. Biotech should always be small bets..Good Luck to all and do your due diligence always...
looks like it's headed for a new all-time low. Nick must be celebrating.
"I do not understand. 3 weeks have passed since the release of their horrible report. what has been done during this time why hasn’t NL contacted the shareholders yet? on the chart, prices are constantly falling, many failed decisions have been made over the years, including entering the European market, which shows his inability to make decisions. Why is NL not responsible for this? Why does NL continue to perform poorly and not retire? why is the board of directors silent? where is the development strategy? the company continues to work as it did and slides into oblivion."
Any chance of a buy out now? Whoever gets this gem will be richly rewarded!
"value destroyed. $25.00 offer and it would be approved on a buyout. common holders get smacked while a large bio can take the cash, take the pipe/research, and fire/shutter everything."
"Tweet tweet, where is the CHIEF Blue Bird?"
"What does PFE's acquisition of TRIL for $2.3 B say about the valuation of 2seventy? TRIL has about $291m in cash. It has two promising blood cancer compounds, but no approvals. TTI-621 and TTI-622 are both in phase one. 2seventy has its own blood cancer compound, CRB-402, to treat multiple myeloma. It too is in phase one. But 2seventy also has a potential blockbuster already on the market. Obviously, that is split with BMY. At $2.3B, 2seventy would be worth roughly $35 per share. For that, BMY would get a potential blood cancer drug, the other half of the Abecma revenue, and $400m in cash. I honestly don’t know why they wouldn’t just pull the trigger.More than anything, what this deal says to me is that big pharma sees good value in the small biotech oncology space. This is positive, I guess. I’m totally frustrated and completely disgusted with NL and his mismanagement of BLUE. Nevertheless, I still believe that there is unrecognized value here. And so we wait…"
"Use what's left of your money and by Organon. It has the right management, philosophy, products and spends the money where needed-------> research and development."
Where does it end?
$800M net cash and annual losses of ($620M). This company won't be long for this planet.
Hi Max. I am stuck here and badly. I have seen your posts and you seem like an intelligent dude. What do we do here? As you mentioned the stock price reminds me of Tesoro and celgene before they got acquired. Fully build manufacturing facility and spin-off upcoming. How can this not be primed for buyout? They don’t seem like they have a plan to survive as a stand-alone company. Question based on the science and synergies who would benefit from tucking in this company? I am ready to start an activist campaign to push for this outcome. My losses and purchase price are scary here. It’s insane. Misery loves company bro. How deep are you here. You said you would buy more at $25. Well here we are. Are you? Should I ? My wife doesn’t know the mess I am in here. Luckily I have Luckin coffee to bail me out somewhat. Good luck man and keep posting.

I hope I can recup my losses with Anab.GSK and others are trying to buy out Anab. StreetInsider confirmed that meeting are going on.Since a few days...hardly any volume...it wont take that long.Let see...
"Unexpected small spike. ""Hope in the time of Blue."""
I'm sure early next week we will see a new 52 wk low. AI says down trend near term and future long term. By the time they split the co. in two their won't be anything to split.

"Biotech bag holders are a unique bunch. They hold on for far too long. They think a turnaround is just around the corner. Still others cite book value, value of patents, value of cash on hand.

buy blue today will get double money

Good news is 10 percent of the shares are sold short so there is somebody to cover.

"No one really cares that they pulled out of Europe. It was obvious to everyone that Nick couldn't make the case for Zynteglo. And CALD is such a small market it's not worth the effort. Why is this part of the lede? Another hold sucks. But this hold is for a specially designed vector, a vector they don't use in any other program. It is an isolated incident. But the market doesn't see it that way, obviously, since this is now two holds in one year. It doesn't matter that the first hold was a false positive. They postponed the TDT filing to sometime in Q3. This after they said ""mid-2021"" in a press release in mid-June. This is just typical. This company has a blatant disregard for timelines and fessing up to their own incompetence. I'll believe this filing when I see it. In any event, TDT is a small market, with just 1,500-odd patients living with TDT in the US. This company needs to succeed with SCD. With 22k patients living with SCD, this is the biggest market for them. I don't honestly know what they mean when they say they'll give an update on SCD at the end of the year. That's even vaguer than a fake timeline. Previously, the company said mid-2022 for a renewed filing for SCD. Given that they are still focusing on the newly manufactured vector used in the phase 1/2 HGB-206 study (data update coming at ASH), I'm wondering if they will postpone filing until late-2023, when that study completes. That means, at best, they beat CRSP to market by a few months, and it also means that they will be at the end of their cash runway (so, more dilution to come before diving into a highly competitive market with better-capitalized competitors--the makings of a success story if ever I heard one, NOT ). Abecma did $24m in revenues (split 50/50) in Q2. That's something. I think the cancer division could be self-sustaining in two years. I think it's possible that they won't have to dilute shareholders further. But, that said, if Nick is in charge, I'm sure he'll dilute shareholders and pay himself a big bonus for making the deal. That's just the way it goes around here. Did I miss anything? What a lovely day."

"[[ ... Bluebird bio still plans to complete its data submission to FDA this year “pending resolution of the [FDA] hold,” Obenshain said Monday.

Definitely should have bought on the big dip. Itchy feeling shares wish to bounce back on technicals.
Could this be the start of something wonderful?
This will doom crsp
boom to $100's if gene theraphy is announced to treat covid! ha ha! boom!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Eight years as a public company. The stock is right where it started. Just an awful company.
totally agree with Max. #NickMustGo
Looking for $2.70
Seems like a nice entry point. Cheers.
We're in another bad down trend I don't know if tmrrw we start to pull out of it or it gets worse. Nick shootn his mouth off is usually not good.
Looks like lifting clinical hold meant nothing. can't find a bottom
Under $20 buy here
got suckered into this stock thinking the co is going to be split into 2 so they will be acquired.
Just browsing and notice how this stock went down. Wow. probably lots of bagholders on this board. GLTA.
"I haven't paid attention to BLUE for many months and am surprised to see it this low. I always liked the company, just never bought into it"
"read their quarterly report. I did not see any intelligible development strategy in it. the only caveats are that we may not be able to and you may lose all your money. when they started the market of commercial genetics was not developed and they could raise the price to 200 with words. Now many promising companies are on their heels and they just need a development strategy. however, Nick continues to destroy his company and someone has to stop him, otherwise we will lose everything."
Not much out of either JPM presentation. Nick did laughably say execution had been strong over the last year.
Burning through 100 million cash per quarter with no results. Too late to be sold. Their survival rate is lower than those of their patients.
If you feel good about BLUE sell at the money puts and buy at the money calls for Jan 23.
We didn't even have to wait for the spin-off to fail to get diluted again. Lovely. This story just keeps getting better.
Even Blue getting some action today!
Short it!

"EC approval for Skysona. No one cares. Why? I don't think anyone believes they will be able to make a deal with the payors, that is, Skysona is likely Zynteglo part deux. Hope I'm wrong.

Shame on the board, and shame on ME for sticking around...but, if there is possibly income from actual treatment, i think the stock would move higher.so many have been burned on this, it will take time to turn investor sentiment around.i am still hopeful, in spite of Nick, there is something worthwhile in this company..."
Still think if ever a buyout REGN. Saw something about 2 wks ago that Blue had 17 more products coming on line. The co. Seems so fishy overall like a make or break senario. Yeah tmrrw carries a lot of weight. Would love to see a ground swell movement like what happened with gme & amc swarm to vote Nick & board out. Can you imagine what would happen to blue if a CEO of the caliber of msft or nvda in the bio field took it over?
Now for the dead cat bounce.
"current sp brings back nostalgic memories for me; I bought blue at 22 in Jan 2014, saw it go down to today's levels (17.50 or so) within several weeks; I sold at 105 in Feb 2015 (13 months later); had I held on 3 more months I could have sold it at 205; still the best personal trade ever for me........unfortunately, this go-around we are unlikely to see a bounce back to 100; I am with GBT, I have been touting on the boards for a while now that both gene therapy and gene editing are not practical, nor cost effective for scd; sexy stuff when scientific american publishes articles about how the gene therapy/editing will cure scd but look at the costs and also the capability/mindset of scd patients; only 40% covid vaccinated, very conservative, do you think they will line up for gene editing/therapy? incredibly expensive and will never be practical, neither of the two; oral tablets are the way to go; gbt601, the successor to oxbryta could be a potential functional cure given its greater efficacy at much lower doses; i concur with brad loncar who posited what i had to say above;"

Something wrong going on today. 60 cents in green. How come? I hope things go on this way.
25 million first quarter selling is huge.2seventy will be spun off tax free and immediately be bought out.they backed out of europe because bp has their own plans there.this is a very strong buy
I wouldn't be surprised if Nick ditches an actual call and just does a press release Q2
"That’s what you get, when you have incompetent CEO, $236 in 2018 to $18.5 in 2021!!!"
so many missed the Trillium buyoutand so many will miss it here
BLUE appears to be the latest MEME stock.
Continue to buy on weakness. Investing wisely and not foolishly.
Is there any other gene therapy company that has more TDT patients signed on to their trials and showed higher efficacy over longer period than BLUE? They had 51 patients enrolled showing 100% efficacy after 7 years? Does that not count for something
I going to short this way down to low 20's since that is the gap from 5 years ago!MMs (MArket Manipulators) are so predictable in how they sell and buy shares!GLTA in stock casino!
"Abecma gets conditional approval in the EU (ex the UK). That's good for Blue. Oh, wait, they already sold the EU rights for $200m so, in the immortal words of Willie Wonka, they ""...get NOTHING!"" That said, the EU gave conditional approval for a fourth line, that is, after the three standards of care fail. The FDA approval was for the fifth line. So, BLUE doesn't get any money from this, but the approval for the fourth line is probably good for the stock as it shows that Abecam can (perhaps) quickly work its way up the treatment list. Nah. Why would I think the stock could go up? That's what got me into this mess in the first place."
There is no interest in this stock very small volume. I'm hoping for a buy out as the stock price gets cheaper in value by the day.
Why the company has over 1billion dollar on its balance sheet? Any thoughts?
"As per BMY, the demand outstripped supply. while it's a snag, it's a fixable problem and they Are already catching up. Its a good problem to have, rather than having no demand."
You don't go into a market like Europe and introduce a product without first finding out if they can afford it also if you have enough of a need. Doesn't seem smart to me!

The question on everyone's mind is how low do we go? I have no idea. The billion dollars everyone thinks is the saving grace will be whittled down along with the sp.
"All the shorts.....certainly guessed/called this correctly....Nick, i am guessing, will get into politics next. The perfect place for him."
"Bit unfortunate, once funds start selling they will sell out no matter what the news!I still see low 20's as the bottom!GLTA In stock casino!"
"Unreal for a biotech in a promising sector.This management, particularly the CEO and the whole Board have no shame to continue to “lead” this co to oblivion! They all should resign from their cushy jobs at the investors’ expense."
We are all to blame. The EGT court case told of all of the illegal wrongdoings. The stock was 200 and we refused to read the court documents. There should be jail time...
"The Jefferies analysts puts the peak sales for Skysona at just $74 million. That's why no one cares. It's such a small market that it just doesn't move the needle. Again, approvals are great, but sales would be better. Maybe some day."
"What a let down. In such a promising industry, a former leader must really be hung up in the trees to self defeat like this. Glad I’m holding a diversified basket in the CRISPR industry."
Company should be shut down selling therapy and drugs at prices only the rich can afford. Maybe they would be making money if they priced them at an affordable price.
"Well, they have 45 days from the end of the quarter to file their 10Q. Today was day 35. I can't even believe I have to post this."
BLUE. 1B CASH... so you can buy the company and get teh cash value plus the rest of the company for 300-400b. seems like the market is saying they are done. might as well sell the pipeline & call it a day. pathetic. foolish that i thought $31.00 was good value.
Looks like the mkt is really enthusiastic about Monday's Q2 ER...
With this cash burn rate it's 6 months away from dilution.Otherwise empty pockets in just a year.
some newly hired employee just got a ton of stock at a killer price
well time to start a position ....as such srtp as will blue birdie !
No matter how you slice it there's just no hope.
Bluebird intends to work with regulators with the goal to have the clinical hold for eli-cel lifted as soon as possible. The biotech company still thinks that it will be able to complete the U.S. regulatory submissions for the drug in treating beta-thalassemia and CALD this year
New Dilema…. Sell and buy lower near all book value or hold….. looks like holding is the best option. Unbelievable 25% SP decline. Not happy and not averaging down at this point.
I’m guessing they are pulling as much preliminary data as they can find to show us all is still ok. Maybe a publication also on lenti-g safety.
"So I didn't say anything bad about you either. Biotech stocks are a high risk. The Director performs his duties based on common sense. I bought the first time for $19.5. The day before yesterday I sold at $18.5, yesterday I bought again at $17.6. With a further fall, I will increase my share in the deposit. According to your logic, the Chinese president is also not good, because Chinese stocks have fallen? Are you used to everything having to grow? What do you say when the rest of the American stock market collapses? Will you jump from a skyscraper?)))"
Down nearly two bucks since lift of trial suspension...Funny. SHort in total control and looking to score big on retail weak hands...Good Luck to all and do your due diligence always...
Bring a $3B bid to buy this babe now! I'd vote for $3B now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Carful trying to catch this thing by the beak
"This is how you do it:Velodyne Lidar Inc's founder David Hall on Monday called on Chairman Michael Dee to resign from the sensor maker's board, blaming him for a steep fall in the company's stock price.""Dee has spearheaded major business decisions that leave him responsible for the company's nearly 80% stock price decline, in my view,"" Hall, who was removed as chairman earlier this year, said in an letter to the board.Where is this for BLUE? #NickMustGo"
I believe that shareholders and the board of directors should force Nick Leschly to leave. he is not able to manage the company well and make it profitable. this will be well received by investors. this is now one of his few steps that will make the price rise.
Down 15% in 5 days with no news and low colume....Very interesting. If I was hedging I would short CRSP and buy ADVM and BLUE...Both ADVM & BLUE are down 70-80% from peak while CRSP is down about 15%. Call it law of averages...Buy low and sell high...Good Luck to all and do your due diligence always...
"That's what I thought, like I said few days ago every time Leschley shoots his mouth off we go down. Which proves no one trust or believes in him. Another reason he should resign now. Cuomo did."
Glad I sold this (for still a significant loss!) long ago! Wow....
I looked at the data and institutions are in fact net buyers and have been for a little while. Put that with a couple of pieces of toast and you still wouldn't have a sandwich.
reality. the mirror don't lie.
Why fresh new lows?
Basic fundamentals. Market Cap 1.8 Billion. Cash position( securities/ equivalents) 1.0 Billion. As of Mar 2021Company spin offInvestment worth it. cheers.
"Not sure what to make of this alliance with Resilience and the transfer of their manufacturing facility to Resilience. I guess costs go down in short run, but if they bring drugs to market, wouldn't the costs go up if they have to contract out for drug production."

"Exits are hard to time. Onno van de Stolpe rode high for years after founding Galapagos. Yet, after presiding over a period in which Galapagos’ share price fell 80%, wiping out billions of dollars in value, van de Stolpe is hitting the exit on a low ebb—and leaving with the future of the biotech in doubt. Van de Stolpe founded Galapagos in 1999 and served as CEO from its early R&D days through to the commercial launch of filgotinib in Europe. Over that time, van de Stolpe guided Galapagos back from its jilting by AbbVie, landing deals with Gilead for JAK1 inhibitor filgotinib and later the $5 billion pact that looked to secure the independent future of his biotech. Barely two years after the second Gilead deal, Galapagos is searching for a way out of a predicament created by a series of R&D setbacks.Responsibility for leading the search will fall on a new CEO. Van de Stolpe, having seen his long-time chief scientific officer hand in his notice, is set to leave as CEO once a successor is appointed. An external search is now underway.Galapagos noted that the next CEO will have more of a science-focused background, RBC Capital Markets remarked in a Monday note. ""Though van de Stolpe was well-liked for his humility, integrity, and transparency, given the company's recent high-profile setbacks, we expect investors will view the potential for new leadership as an opportunity to bring in fresh perspectives as the company looks to rework their internal R&D processes,"" RBC's Brian Abrahams wrote. Shares in Galapagos rose 5% to above $58 in the wake of the news. Galapagos traded above $270 early last year. Since then, filgotinib has been shown to be a busted flush, going from a blockbuster in waiting to a drug with no future as a rheumatoid arthritis treatment in the U.S. in a matter of months. Things went from bad to worse as ziritaxestat failed a phase 3 idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis trial and Toledo, the SIK inhibitor program Galapagos has hyped for several years, underwhelmed in its first clinical test.The SIK inhibitor program may appear again, but, with midphase studies of the first candidate falling well short of expectations, it will be years before the preclinical prospects show whether Galapagos’ belief in the mechanism is justified. With cash in hand and the late-phase pipeline looking thin, Galapagos is planning to buy its way out of the predicament. RELATED: Gilead's $5B Galapagos black hole widens as pair tosses out phase 3 asset after flop""We expect Galapagos will continue to develop assets for novel targets but with new input from a science-oriented leader to help further mitigate risks and aim to enable better returns on pipeline investments,"" RBC said. Galapagos is looking for late-stage phase 2 or 3 assets in inflammation and fibrosis, which has been the biotech's core focus, according to Jefferies analysts. Gilead continues to have ex-EU opt-in rights through the companies' existing alliance, but the Big Pharma has indicated a willingness to finance a deal. The analysts, while acknowledging that van de Stolpe’s exit is unlikely to surprise people, raised concerns that the time spent on the search for a new CEO could limit “the likelihood of much needed meaningful near-term in-licensing deals for late-stage assets.”RBC expects the CEO search to be conducted with ""some urgency"" given the need to replace the CSO and conduct business development. Gilead will likely have a say in who becomes the next chief executive of Galapagos, given the company's two board seats. RELATED: Galapagos avoids 'complete whiff' as key anti-inflammatory drug fails to beat placebo in midphase trials""A new candidate could engage the Gilead partnership differently and potentially facilitate a restructuring and/or deeper integration of Gilead's expertise into Galapagos decision making,"" RBC said."
"I can't believe BMY isn't going to make a play here. This feels just like the CELG deal, where the stock fell through the floor and BMY just happened to be there with a saving offer. I feel BMYs fingerprints all over this brutal collapse.I'll be shocked if BLUE isn't taken out before the end of the year."
I remember this company. What happened?
