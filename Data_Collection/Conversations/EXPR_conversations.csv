"It is just a profit taking day, that is normal in the stock market. Wait and be patient to enjoy $$$. Those who sold today, probably are the ones who bought at $3 or $4. They probably sold at $7.5 to buy again at a lower price, but unfortunately for them, the resistance is around $6.5 now. Remember, patience is a key to success."
Solid fundament
"On my minute chart for Express, 6.57 is resistance one and the stock must get though this level before it can move forward. Next resistance level is 6.96. Need more volume to get through these levels. JW"
Great stock. But in the market you always sell the news.
"Wmt, Tgt, M, FL................retailers are beating earnings and have positive outlook for future earnings. Can't wait to see EXPR earnings"
Buy the rumor sell the news worked perfectly. Once the trade positions work themselves out this stock will move higher. I bought more. GREAT earnings will work itself into share price. patience
Buy buy strong buy going $10 today just wait & watch
"Remember what I said that 5 days ago? ****************************CJ5days agoI said it yesterday, Macy’s, TJ Max, all retail exploding, EXPR market cap comparison and sales is much Stronger, shorts will literally get crushed in coming days unless they cover, their entire investment in puts will get wiped out! Big miss calculation in their part!"
"News out now on the estimate earnings preview by 3 analysts on my Schwab Street Smart Edge platform. For the present quarter is a loss of 30 cents compared to the same quarter a year ago of l.48 . Revenues of 447m compared to the same quarter last year of 245m. The three analysts have a ""hold"" on the stock. JW"

Tim Baxter gave an interview a couple weeks ago with a bullish outlook hinting at strong earnings. I'm guessing we will see positive net income and free cash flow. This thing is so undervalued and should be $40 at a minimum. Only a matter of time. Mark Aug 25th on your calendar for the pre-market earnings report.
"Just as I predicted - positive net income and operating cash flow. This is the quarter where Express begins their comeback. This will eventually reach $40. Market cap will eventually reach $5 billion, on par with Revolve. Tim Baxter knows how to run a company. He is an awesome CEO. Today, the comeback begins. This is no longer a meme stock. This is a solid company with billions of revenue and solid fundamentals, that is severely undervalued."
"Bought another 100 shares, what a discountIMO PT is 10"
$8+ next week
loaded up 2k shares at 6.45 :D
thank you for the shares
8.50 Thursday........guarantee
That is weird that this is dropping- sell on the news? Is that what is happening? Just curious- I will buy more - earnings were good
Even though I sold 75% of my shares at $7.50 I don't get why this stock is selling off after a surprise profit? The explanation of where it came from also makes no sense. The street was expecting a smaller loss. The valuation has be getting close to dirt cheap but that doesn't always mean a rally will happen. Seems to me this is a good company but a broken stock
Profits and revenues exceeded estimates and stock is down ?? Don’t get it
