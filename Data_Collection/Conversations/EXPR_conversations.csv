It's not the short sellers that are driving this stock down since earnings. Future profits amid the economic pressures that determine in are what's on Investors minds when it comes to EXPR and others in the sector. This stock has been telegraphing for quite some time now that it wants to trade around the $4.50-$4.75 range
people are talking about $20 $40 blah blah blah I want to see this thing hit at least eight with some strength so far it hasn't shown me that
chart speaks for itself !!!

Not sure how I ever traded without (http://financialdeals.tech)! Their daily emails give me all the info I need to make the best decisions when it comes to trades!
It’s coming guys
I feel a continuation coming 
"News out now on the estimate earnings preview by 3 analysts on my Schwab Street Smart Edge platform. For the present quarter is a loss of 30 cents compared to the same quarter a year ago of l.48 .

Bought this sock accidentally. Didn't even knows that was. Now I make profit with it
not much volume or action in price..this shld hv been 7.25 today at least
Will Express maintain its gains this morning into the afternoon? Is this a short squeeze? Can it hit 6 dollars a share today? Are the hedge funds back into the stock. JW
???? is this cross $8?
Not even considering anything until $10/share.
"Stop whining like a bunch of little girls. In the last month EXPR I was gone from $4.50 to over 750 if you didn’t sell some calls or take a little profit, that’s your problem.

"Not worried one bit, I am not selling until the market cap reaches a reasonable valuation of $5 billion."
Thank you market manipulators for giving me a chance to buy more!!!!
Where are all the new posts ? The last one I see is from a week ago?
"feel like there are a ton of new and confused traders in here so I'm going to help explain what's happening...Gamestop (GME) and (AMC) are two failing companies who's stocks got a bump in the market due to some recent good, but ultimately inconsequential news. That jump caused large multi-billion dollar short-selling hedge funds to short GME and AMC stock with the assumption that they'd continue to fall after their bumps.(Short selling is when someone borrows shares at a higher price then sells it with the assumption that they can buy the shares again later (1/29) at a cheaper price, give those shares back and then pocket the difference.)This is where we the people (FB, Reddit, Twitter..) come in to ruin their day.A bunch of us agree to flood AND HOLD! the stock with unexpected new money, causing the stock price to rise instead of fall. This causes the short sellers to lose money because they are going to have to give back those borrowed shares in the future (1/29).As the short sellers watch the stock rise alomg with their losses, they start folding one by one and buying the stock in order to give the shares back and close their position. Buying those shares causes the stock to rise which in turn puts MORE pressure on the short sellers and more of them have to buy more shares... This is called a SHORT SQUEEZE.On Friday (1/29), time will be up for many of the short sellers. They'll have to close out their positions by buying stock which will cause AMC, EXPR, and GameStop to sky rocket.That is why you BUY NOW (apply pressure and start your investment) and HOLD. Because every person that sells is relieving the pressure and reducing the billions of dollars the hedge funds will owe us, the little guys.The price will go up, and it will go down, just buy it and hold it at LEAST until Friday 1/29. I copied this comment so Copy and paste to educate the people!God Bless Longs ... I wish you all become millionaires with this stock"
It is retreating now.
meme stocks are soaring again. expr will follow. very low float and good entry right now
$10 coming up soon hold your pants! 
My prediction: it will be a good ER. It will touch 9. Will dip back to 7.50 end of week
Any explanation for the decline? No bashers please.
^^^Express CEO Tim Baxter very bullish as company executes its turnaround strategy
Looks going to close around $6.40
EXPR might be a powerful meme stock.
"Is this a short squeeze today ? On my minute chart 5.98 is the next resistance. Now, will Express retrace all the gains today? JW"
I need this at $1-2.
8.50 Thursday........guarantee
That stock is $50 worth I don’t know why keep going down every single day Earning was good Cash  flow good  future Good  
The entire stock market is up except expr! Total manipulation by hedgies!
"Just as I predicted - positive net income and operating cash flow. This is the quarter where Express begins their comeback. This will eventually reach $40. Market cap will eventually reach $5 billion, on par with Revolve. Tim Baxter knows how to run a company. He is an awesome CEO. Today, the comeback begins. This is no longer a meme stock. This is a solid company with billions of revenue and solid fundamentals, that is severely undervalued."
"no doubt that Hedge funds players have great faith in this one, so be smarter and let them pay you want and not what they want. Keep holding."
"We will get better clarity on retail apparel sales in the next two days. TGT and TJX report Wednesday morning, and KSS and M report Thursday morning."

"WHY EXPR IS DOWN AFTERHOURS: Hedge fund managers, Short sellers, and Market Makers are using their extended hour trading to scare retail traders (You) off. Most retail traders (You) lack the ability to trade before and after the market opens/closes. This is why it is currently down. Once retail traders (You) are able to get back in at market open tomorrow, this will again go up. This is an attempt to scare ppl away from the stock. It will happen every single evening for the next several days so be prepared for this. If it is to stressful for you, please put away your phone/computer and check again in the morning.

You’ll regret if you don’t buy now. Just saying
"Guys and gals of express. This is why you have to hold your shares no matter the price right now. Find out what the short expirations are and what the stock price needs to be. Next week is what is at amc have been working and holding towards. It's a very interesting read. But this is why you have to HOLDPLS READ AND SHARE SO EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS THE NEXT PHASE:To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:AMC current status (30JAN2021) :AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us)Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that.Today’s target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)So Monday when they’re forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher.But this isn’t even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher.Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008. AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there’s a lot more room to grow. On the high end we’re talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until ThursdayMy recommendation:1. HOLD2. Buy more on Monday if you can afford it because it’s going to violently rise3. Enjoy the ride until AT LEAST Thursday evening when all the shorts expire and the price is at it’s highest.I am not a financial advisor nor a registered stock broker. I simply have done my DD (Due diligence) and reflecting on passed events. Every stock has risk but it’s all about risk mitigation. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity so be mindful what you’re dealing with. If you have any questions I will try my best to answer them.Happy trading, GREAT job today everyone.

why down today...while GME and AMC holding ok
"not talking bad but this earnings run for most companies has done nothing but tank so i will buy puts bearish sign, then immediately sell them after earnings, bullish sign. then buy calls bullish sign"
Numbers r good why going down
"When most ppl don’t buy call options for $Expr, this will rise hard! This is why they manipulate the price now!"
Can we expect a $5.50 share range by dec? Or is that too hopeful. Looks like it may just be heading down from here on.

Good morning fellow longs
Nobody knows what's really going on with EXPR. I'm thinking do investors feel this business will survive in this retail environment we are in
They had some interesting insights about EXPR on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
Solid fundament
higher highs...higher lows
"The chart very bullish, ready to break all time high!"
The manipulation on this stock is disgusting
Solid company on the right track. Making great progress. When this starts flying it's going to catch a lot of people off gaurd.
cash out at $7.05 / 60% profit. volume is getting thin. not gonna be greedy with mkt topping
"Very positive articles in ""Barron's"" this weekend about retail stocks like Macys, TJ Max, Kohl's, and Ross Stores. Hope this is a good omen for Express that reports earnings in the morning on August 25th. Now the big question, "" As a person who holds shares do you continue to hold into earnings on Wednesday?"" JW"
Wow... this finding bottom anytime soon?
Buying in around 6 could make you some decent money
Can we make 10? I need to pay my rent lol
"if you look at the AMC chart and the EXPR chart for today, they have practically the identical shape"
Profits and revenues exceeded estimates and stock is down ?? Don’t get it
"Look at this stock few month ago, it was almost half of today's value, this new resistance (give or take around $4.6) is a great new. keep holding and enjoy."
Massive short squzze on the way get ready bois!
"Gals and Guys, this will fly soon (very near future) and the sky is the limit, you either jump in by buying more and hold to enjoy the $$$$$$$$$$$$$. or sit back and keep whining and crying that you missed the boat and why it went down for few days. remember, Patience is a key to success.STOP WHINING, hold and hold strongly and sell at the price you want."
"I Never understand how certain companies with great earnings are just incapable of awarding their investors on their investment! That’s your function as a board and ceo and instead they reward short sellers and attract their interest, me soon to be included! Why would you invest in this company long knowing where it will go!"
"$EXPR is similar to $SCVL. The latter also had great revenues and earnings but is down today, and $SCVL has outstanding fundamentals. For some reason Apparel is doing poorly today even on fantastic news. I'll be buying more of both."
I am a believer I think we can easily crack $8 by the end of 2023 which represents a health return. Buying $EXPR better than buying gold or crypto

"What a great buy this stock is, the sky is the limit with this one. Hold and sell only with your price and the not the forced price on you . Wait and enjoy the coming $$$$$"
"I am sure we get pummeled today, but I think it is a fine play to buy and hold. We can break 10 by the end of the decade so just hold tight"
"Well, at least this isn't corrupt?"
"Sold @ almost $7, will rebuy if goes below $5. Volatility is good to make profit"
"Shorts positions do not expire.Don't sell on Friday.The longer you hold, the less shares available, increasing the price and making it unavailable to these shorters to buy back at lower price.Equals, the longer it takes for shorters to buy back at lower price, equals higher interest charged to them---and higher interest means decreasing profits; so, they got no choice but to buy back shares at a much higher price.But if no one is selling, they have to set their buy order at even higher pricesIf no one is still selling, then they even have to set buy orders at higher price.So just hold."

2nd Quarter Whale Wisdom site shows an increase in hedge fund holdings of 50.94 % and an improvement in the put/call ratio of 28%.
Tim Baxter gave an interview a couple weeks ago with a bullish outlook hinting at strong earnings. I'm guessing we will see positive net income and free cash flow. This thing is so undervalued and should be $40 at a minimum. Only a matter of time. Mark Aug 25th on your calendar for the pre-market earnings report.

Regardless EXPR probably being held back a little by common investor concerns over Delta. 2-3 weeks from now when case counts wane for reasons nobody really understands ( see Indida and it's Delta crisis from earlier this summer) EXPR will achieve a more reliable price. I imagine we will easily crack 6-6.50 before year end"

What an awful weak management to allow shorts and manipulators to take over their company! We need real strong corporate experience here! Time for these rookie clowns to get voted out in my opinion.
"Hey guys who are holding. Don't worry about after hours or pre-markets prices. Most retail traders don't trade during AH or PM. These prices will be determined mostly by hedge funds. Whether the add more shorts (drop price) or cover shorts (increase price) it doesn't matter. We're all here for the short squeeze. If we don't sell there's not enough shares to cover the shorts PERIOD.Another thing, a lot of RobinHood traders left that platform. Some platforms require 3 business days to transfer money into before you can even trade. So there might be a lot more movement Tuesday or Wednesday when those retail investors can buy.This is a waiting game to see who blinks first. Most of us bought stocks with cash not on margin. So we can wait forever. The shorts either out right shorted usually that's on margin (they paying interest). If they bought put options, everyday the stock doesn't change their premiums depreciate as it nears expiry. Time is on our side. Be patient, don't panic and sell early. This will go up once they realize our resolve."

So discouraging day to day on Express. Is this being controlled by Hedge Funds or shorts or both? The stock starts the morning with some gains and by lunch time it heads back down. Macy's continues to go up the last few weeks. JW
Even though I sold 75% of my shares at $7.50 I don't get why this stock is selling off after a surprise profit? The explanation of where it came from also makes no sense. The street was expecting a smaller loss. The valuation has be getting close to dirt cheap but that doesn't always mean a rally will happen. Seems to me this is a good company but a broken stock
"Keep holding until $10 atleast guys, trust. "
Ummm... is that not a head and shoulders pattern from early June on?
THIS WEEK ME MOOOOOON 
"Wmt, Tgt, M, FL................retailers are beating earnings and have positive outlook for future earnings. Can't wait to see EXPR earnings"
"Very good results, share price should increase substantially to reflect the positive news."
I just sold at my buy price of $5.45--- May buy back if and when it goes to 4.00
"Take a look at A D T X. only 3rd company with a covid pill for 90 3rd world countries, not vaccines that are hard to ship to so many places and must be refridgerated. market cap should be higher than vxrtit is insulting, float so small, when they pop it, will be banaNA b a ba nana!sektor"
Last week CEO said they are making money and went up to $7.50 to $8 now back to under $5. I hope EXPRESS earning Aug-25 will be good. Get chance to get this range $4.75- to $4.80 . Next week and following earning week might be $10 above
I think the only way to get this stock turned around is for us longs to give up and short it. For sure that will make it go up for me. Is EXPR really worth almost 30% lower after their earnings report?
"Remember what I said that 5 days ago? ****************************CJ5days agoI said it yesterday, Macy’s, TJ Max, all retail exploding, EXPR market cap comparison and sales is much Stronger, shorts will literally get crushed in coming days unless they cover, their entire investment in puts will get wiped out!

"Bought another 100 shares, what a discountIMO PT is 10"
Back to $2 shall we?
This trade is becoming very predictable. Buy tomorrow at around $4.75 and then sell at $5.10 the next day. Do this over and over again and make money. This can't lose strategy could work at least until earnings day
vRUS stock will blow up
"The hedge funds pushed the Cramer buy, buy, buy button."
Extremely strong price action. It's gonna pop.
"For everyone whining and complaining you do realize this stock is up 465% this year dont you? Stop whining, watching the stock daily, and instead just treat it like a savings account.

Exactly CJ
"Hey, the short trade is working until it's not. Profits will soon determine the SP"
This is red tomorrow lol
Just depressing how management has literally lost this company to shorts! Just sad!
"Remember, $10 is the deserved price target. 2nd quarter earnings coming in about a month."
"It is going down. Where ""short squeeze"" is?"
Profit taking driving stock down.
Looking forward to August and the move up!
Hey CJ...stock up...you should thank management today
Aren’t we suppose to be going in the other direction?????
