Buying more call options for today. Incredibly high number of $1 puts for 7/16. These are obviously being used to hide reported short interest. over 1mil shares borrowed to short today alone. Short sellers are buyers eventually just hold.
"I said it yesterday, Macy’s, TJ Max, all retail exploding, EXPR market cap comparison and sales is much Stronger, shorts will literally get crushed in coming days unless they cover, their entire investment in puts will get wiped out! Big miss calculation in their part!"
thank you for the shares
what a #$%$..Thanks for nothing EXPR
^^^Market Cap 2 Low
Not even considering anything until $10/share.
Any explanation for the decline? No bashers please.
"not talking bad but this earnings run for most companies has done nothing but tank so i will buy puts bearish sign, then immediately sell them after earnings, bullish sign. then buy calls bullish sign"
I waited 15minuts at checkout...blowout earnings this quarter
"no doubt that Hedge funds players have great faith in this one, so be smarter and let them pay you want and not what they want. Keep holding."
"There is news about Black Rock and Express, but I could not open the filing. Does anyone on the board have information about this issue? Thanks JW"
^^^Goin ^UP^
"$AMC $GME $BB $EXPR Are the best plays in the market and will be for a LONG time. IFYKYK Not financial advice strictly an opinion. ""Meme"" stocks is just a label to insight FUD sort of like ""Conspiracy Theorist"" I'm not a fan of $HOOD"
Last week CEO said they are making money and went up to $7.50 to $8 now back to under $5. I hope EXPRESS earning Aug-25 will be good. Get chance to get this range $4.75- to $4.80 . Next week and following earning week might be $10 above
"News out now on the estimate earnings preview by 3 analysts on my Schwab Street Smart Edge platform. For the present quarter is a loss of 30 cents compared to the same quarter a year ago of l.48 . Revenues of 447m compared to the same quarter last year of 245m. The three analysts have a ""hold"" on the stock. JW"
Buy buy buy  this will hit $20 soon
I am a believer I think we can easily crack $8 by the end of 2023 which represents a health return. Buying $EXPR better than buying gold or crypto
Tim Baxter gave an interview a couple weeks ago with a bullish outlook hinting at strong earnings. I'm guessing we will see positive net income and free cash flow. This thing is so undervalued and should be $40 at a minimum. Only a matter of time. Mark Aug 25th on your calendar for the pre-market earnings report.
Bought this sock accidentally. Didn't even knows that was. Now I make profit with it
"Hedge funds will attack this stock like they do with every company with good earning release. Buy more on the dip, screw them!"
push it up
chart speaks for itself !!!
Yea it’s go break out hard soon
"Not bashing, just a question. Does the price tumbling over 40% from just a few weeks ago concern anyone? I mean why such a devastating fall?"
Extremely strong price action. It's gonna pop.
EXPR might be a powerful meme stock.
I will say it once again the stock hits $8 I'm out bye bye until then I'll hold
why down today...while GME and AMC holding ok
I will sell at $20.... all of them.
"$EXPR, $SCVL, $JWN are all down today on great earnings and revenues. For some reason investors are pulling out of retail apparel today. Oh well, all are at bargain prices for the rest of us."
buckle up! we're going to the moon 
^^^Get ON the ^X-Press
Numbers r good why going down
"I Never understand how certain companies with great earnings are just incapable of awarding their investors on their investment! That’s your function as a board and ceo and instead they reward short sellers and attract their interest, me soon to be included! Why would you invest in this company long knowing where it will go!"
"The chart very bullish, ready to break all time high!"
I owned 3500 shares td Ameritrade average cost  6.65 & in Robinhood 1k average cost  7.27 more than 2K loosing right now
"If you think Express is overvalued at this market cap and short it, you deserve losing your money. This is an obviously suppressed stock, with no real bear case other than the COVID shutdown impact. Earnings look good, and retail is rebounding."
$GT $UPWK $Expr on FIRE!!
Profits and revenues exceeded estimates and stock is down ?? Don’t get it
This is red tomorrow lol
Shorts continue to control this stock. What a disappointment. JW
Macys had a good quarter. Is this a good omen for Express? JW
I keep adding on dips... hold and then hold some more. 3 weeks till a double up!
^^^Short Squeeze Come On
"Added an other 400 shares , holding total 5000 at this time .."
How high can we go?
"if you look at the AMC chart and the EXPR chart for today, they have practically the identical shape"
"1/3 of shorts gave up; short shares dropped from 6,400,000 to 4,230,000. Even shorts believe EXPR is way undervalued."
Where have all the rocket ships gone?
Good morning fellow longs
"On my minute chart for Express, 6.57 is resistance one and the stock must get though this level before it can move forward. Next resistance level is 6.96. Need more volume to get through these levels. JW"
$10 coming up soon hold your pants! 
"Wmt, Tgt, M, FL................retailers are beating earnings and have positive outlook for future earnings. Can't wait to see EXPR earnings"
This goes red tomorrow
Can this dog ever go up 2 days in a row ?
Should green up soon if stock hold $6.7 before 10.30am
"It is moving, can EXPR break the resistance at 6.98? JW"
"Very positive articles in ""Barron's"" this weekend about retail stocks like Macys, TJ Max, Kohl's, and Ross Stores. Hope this is a good omen for Express that reports earnings in the morning on August 25th. Now the big question, "" As a person who holds shares do you continue to hold into earnings on Wednesday?"" JW"
"Just as I predicted - positive net income and operating cash flow. This is the quarter where Express begins their comeback. This will eventually reach $40. Market cap will eventually reach $5 billion, on par with Revolve. Tim Baxter knows how to run a company. He is an awesome CEO. Today, the comeback begins. This is no longer a meme stock. This is a solid company with billions of revenue and solid fundamentals, that is severely undervalued."
Just depressing how management has literally lost this company to shorts! Just sad!

Ummm... is that not a head and shoulders pattern from early June on?
Bought more today @ 4.45
this will bounce back before EOD
Big gap up coming. Momentum is building.

"Wow. Hey Charles, I hung on to those August puts today (Almost sold them yesterday!). What are your thoughts about Tuesday, I am thinking about dumping them? Or would you hold for another week?"
higher highs...higher lows
I use the lion shirts to wipe up messes on floor now.
people are talking about $20 $40 blah blah blah I want to see this thing hit at least eight with some strength so far it hasn't shown me that
It is retreating now.
DIAMOND HANDS will pay off
Should I cash some of my options
EXPR's chart is very bullish. Whenever there's a pullback it shows higher low and higher high with each rally. We will see $9 ~$9.25 at the next rally.

"Here we go again, this stock can't hold any gains and it is very disappointing. I hope the next quarterly report will say this company has a future. Just broke the RL price of 4.90 and heading to 4.79 on my minute resistant chart. Will 4.79 hold? JW"
"I’ve been holding since last year, I know for a fact that Express is valued much more. This disgusting game won’t scare me.Express more then $20 BOY mark my words."
"Hey, the short trade is working until it's not. Profits will soon determine the SP"
Will sell my LCID at $20 and buy more EXPR. The look like it ready to breakout!
It’s coming guys
I bought 2K average cost  6.79 I am not worried  that is $40 stock will soon $40 today will be $10
"I’ve been day trading for years and I’m so glad I finally found (http://Pick-stocks.com). They’re pre-market watchlists cover all the latest market-moving news, and they don’t beat you down with tons of ads. Highly recommend!"
cash out at $7.05 / 60% profit. volume is getting thin. not gonna be greedy with mkt topping
"Remember, Patience is a key to success"
I hope today will be $10 ?? Any moment
@Jim I listening. What is your point?
Someone bought 1M. This will skyrocket EOW.
Fake news - SQUELCHEDPatience pays off. $BBBY $NAKD $GME $BB $AMC $EXPR $MORE?
Drop all you want I wont panic as wanted!
I love the smell of breakouts in the morning.
Maybe a short squeeze tomorrow..
^^^CEO says ComeBack assured on ^EXPR^
"These survivors are all eventually going to get rewarded as the virus case load dips yet again. Strange how it spikes, nobody does anything differently, and then it recedes without good reason. Regardless EXPR probably being held back a little by common investor concerns over Delta. 2-3 weeks from now when case counts wane for reasons nobody really understands ( see Indida and it's Delta crisis from earlier this summer) EXPR will achieve a more reliable price. I imagine we will easily crack 6-6.50 before year end"
"Remember what I said that 5 days ago? ****************************CJ5days agoI said it yesterday, Macy’s, TJ Max, all retail exploding, EXPR market cap comparison and sales is much Stronger, shorts will literally get crushed in coming days unless they cover, their entire investment in puts will get wiped out! Big miss calculation in their part!"
THIS WEEK ME MOOOOOON 
They had some interesting insights about EXPR on (http://Thetraderguide.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"Why panic, when the market is down, this may also be down., what is new about that, just like most other stocks. If you are worried, then never get in. Hold to Win. Lots of good potential in this stock. For sure you will celebrate when you win, but you will cry when you loose, so hold to be a winner to celebrate and don't be a looser because you sold early when this skyrockets."
Solid company on the right track. Making great progress. When this starts flying it's going to catch a lot of people off gaurd.
"If you look at different charts, this appears to be the next one to breakout among Meme stock."
and she is holding $6.00
LEVI apparel sales exceeded expectations; so will EXPR sales also exceed expectations.
Rocket time
Anyone know why this stock climbed today. I don’t have that much In the stock(only 400 dollars) was planning on buying it gradually. Is this just a fluke? Or is there anything worthy that is making it move?
"Sold @ almost $7, will rebuy if goes below $5. Volatility is good to make profit"
Massive short squzze on the way get ready bois!
Weak hands out. Strong hands stay:)
"Again, be careful on catching a falling knife. This might be pricey right now."
Earning was good cash flow good in hand  where is problem

"shorts own this, dominate it and run the show, long investors just like the board are hostages to their will and power."
Buying in around 6 could make you some decent money
FYI this is not a meme stock.This has strong fundamentals And on the 25th it’s going to redeem itself
Solid fundament
"Hedge fund players know the great potential in this one, otherwise they would not be here to scare you to sell so they buy. Play it smart or be a looser."
"The most bullish sign indicating a price reversal is coming is the amount of bashers and FUD that's thrown around about a stock. I've witnessed it time and time again. Within the last 12 months, I bought $LXU for $1.08; now it's at $8. Bought $BTU for $1.34; now it's at $9. Bought $EXPR for $0.87; now it's at $5. Bought $TELL for $0.95; now it's at $4. This, too, will be a multi-bagger within a few months. No doubt about it. What's my secret? Bottom-fishing *extremely* oversold companies. Clover Health, people, is as oversold as they come. All of those aforementioned investments, by the way, had a *ton* of ""lawsuit"" articles, doubters, bashers, short sellers, etc. No asset in the world stays extremely oversold and undervalued forever. Eventually value investors come along and scoop cheap stuff up. Same will happen here. Just be patient. $CLOV"
Not selling
Just wait .... it’s gonna blow people will fomo & it will drive it higher
"It is going down. Where ""short squeeze"" is?"
Looks like its warming up for next take off!
How exciting.#AMC #GME #BB #EXPR # NOK
"Hedgies are shorting trying to keep this one down. They are bleeding funds battling the retail investors on several meme plays. They can't keep these stocks down forever. AMC, EXPR, GME, SNDL, CLF and more"
This stock is a strong  buy
Great stock. But in the market you always sell the news.
I couldn’t be happier with the daily emails I get from (http://Pick-stocks.com). They give me the best daily advice based on stock market news and help me make wiser decisions when it comes to investing. An absolute must for any investor!
"Good Morning, Quick reminder that roughly 30% of daily volume for the past 3 months has been short volume. There are an insane amount of $0.50 puts for 7/16 obviously being used to hide short positions from when they were opened (January 28- Feb 2) Dates sound familiar? The hole is being dug deeper and deeper, or if you'd prefer to think of it this way. The short sellers are pulling the rubber band back further and further until it snaps and this ticker goes flying."
20 here we come. tomorrow boom boom day
8.50 Thursday........guarantee
Can we make 10? I need to pay my rent lol
You’ll regret if you don’t buy now. Just saying
The company may give a June/qtr sales and ATM update Thursday morning. It could be a big positive.
"When most ppl don’t buy call options for $Expr, this will rise hard! This is why they manipulate the price now!"
"I don’t get it, company reports great numbers but guess people don’t want this stock to succeed for some reason smh"

Best of both worlds meme and turnaround!

"Keep holding Girls and Boys. I am still holding to my 90,000 sharesRemember, patience is a key to success, and sell with the price you want Keep holding. This will jump just like AMC did. $10 is low for this one, aim higher to win big."

^^^Why Shares of Express Are Jumping Today?
Will Express maintain its gains this morning into the afternoon? Is this a short squeeze? Can it hit 6 dollars a share today? Are the hedge funds back into the stock. JW

^^^X^^^Press
Looks going to close around $6.40
Even though I sold 75% of my shares at $7.50 I don't get why this stock is selling off after a surprise profit? The explanation of where it came from also makes no sense. The street was expecting a smaller loss. The valuation has be getting close to dirt cheap but that doesn't always mean a rally will happen. Seems to me this is a good company but a broken stock
5 day chart shows cup and handle..... let’s gooooooo!
That stock is $50 worth I don’t know why keep going down every single day Earning was good Cash  flow good  future Good  
This should run like $AMC this week!!
That is weird that this is dropping- sell on the news? Is that what is happening? Just curious- I will buy more - earnings were good
"Gals and Guys, this will fly soon (very near future) and the sky is the limit, you either jump in by buying more and hold to enjoy the $$$$$$$$$$$$$. or sit back and keep whining and crying that you missed the boat and why it went down for few days. remember, Patience is a key to success.STOP WHINING, hold and hold strongly and sell at the price you want."
^^^But at 10-30 Sell at 1-30!
"$EXPR is similar to $SCVL. The latter also had great revenues and earnings but is down today, and $SCVL has outstanding fundamentals. For some reason Apparel is doing poorly today even on fantastic news. I'll be buying more of both."

"Very good results, share price should increase substantially to reflect the positive news."
Buy the rumor sell the news worked perfectly. Once the trade positions work themselves out this stock will move higher. I bought more. GREAT earnings will work itself into share price. patience
10-Q for the second quarter looks a lot better than the first quarter 10-Q. It should help move the share price upwards.
Closing over $6

Thank you market manipulators for giving me a chance to buy more!!!!

It going to cross $20 by July 16 th hold on

"Just received one of the items I ordered Wednesday night at 11:30PM. The rest of my order should be delivered on Monday.

I've been holding shares for over a year now and I just keep adjusting my price target up to what they can be worth after they get back on track. Of course if this reddit craze continues, I may see my target much sooner, or just raise it even higher!"
