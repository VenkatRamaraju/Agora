They had some interesting insights about EXPR on (http://Rightpicker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"Stop whining like a bunch of little girls. In the last month EXPR I was gone from $4.50 to over 750 if you didn’t sell some calls or take a little profit, that’s your problem. Management sounded upbeat analyst questions were realistic and complementary. Forward guidance was OK You have an￼an off day app and sometimesDays like this separate them in for the boys you clear out some weak hands weak hands I hate Siri sometimes, you’ll be fine the stories pretty good they think they can do 1 billion in e-commerce in the next two years relax you’ll be fine.￼"
"If you look at different charts, this appears to be the next one to breakout among Meme stock."
"The chart very bullish, ready to break all time high!"
"Just as I predicted - positive net income and operating cash flow. This is the quarter where Express begins their comeback. This will eventually reach $40. Market cap will eventually reach $5 billion, on par with Revolve. Tim Baxter knows how to run a company. He is an awesome CEO. Today, the comeback begins. This is no longer a meme stock. This is a solid company with billions of revenue and solid fundamentals, that is severely undervalued."
Come on REDDIT favorite fly to $40
"On my minute chart for Express, 6.57 is resistance one and the stock must get though this level before it can move forward. Next resistance level is 6.96. Need more volume to get through these levels. JW"
I couldn’t be happier with the daily emails I get from (http://Pick-stocks.com). They give me the best daily advice based on stock market news and help me make wiser decisions when it comes to investing. An absolute must for any investor!
10-Q for the second quarter looks a lot better than the first quarter 10-Q. It should help move the share price upwards.
Nobody knows what's really going on with EXPR. I'm thinking do investors feel this business will survive in this retail environment we are in
"Will the story be the same for Express today, up in the morning and down in the afternoon with a lower low? Will the back to school and Christmas revenues and earnings make a difference in a rise in the stock by the end of the year? Or, will the hedge funds and short sellers keep Express from rising and drive it lower. Time will tell !!! Love you."
@zackmorris buying again #CEI .... waoooooo great news.get in while its too cheap.@elonmusk also buying just tweeted.... ;)#CEI would be next #amc #tsla #gme #expr
vRUS stock will blow up
Where are all the new posts ? The last one I see is from a week ago?
this will bounce back before EOD
Solid company on the right track. Making great progress. When this starts flying it's going to catch a lot of people off gaurd.
Just depressing how management has literally lost this company to shorts! Just sad!
"not talking bad but this earnings run for most companies has done nothing but tank so i will buy puts bearish sign, then immediately sell them after earnings, bullish sign. then buy calls bullish sign"

Roxanne Meyer of MKM Partners has a buy rating on EXPR with a $6 price target. The price drop is overdone.
"I remember buying 7100 shares for like $5,000 look at it now"
And here is yahoo deleting comments that don’t benefits hedges again.
EXPR might be a powerful meme stock.
"I said it yesterday, Macy’s, TJ Max, all retail exploding, EXPR market cap comparison and sales is much Stronger, shorts will literally get crushed in coming days unless they cover, their entire investment in puts will get wiped out! Big miss calculation in their part!"
To the moon!
Aren’t we suppose to be going in the other direction?????
"Shorts, manipulators and day trader dream is expr! Up in the am down in the pm. Repeat Monday through Friday!"

Beautiful up trend! Slow and steady!
"They coned you all with that holiday season BS didn’t they, kept you all in? Nothing will ever change with retail investors. Stock market these days is just a Chanel to transfer money from little guys to hedge funds and elite. Year after year!"
^^^Buy Op^^^
I heard about EXPR the other day on (http://Multistockalerts.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
Bought this sock accidentally. Didn't even knows that was. Now I make profit with it
Ummm... is that not a head and shoulders pattern from early June on?

"I’ve been holding since last year, I know for a fact that Express is valued much more. This disgusting game won’t scare me.Express more then $20 BOY mark my words."
cash out at $7.05 / 60% profit. volume is getting thin. not gonna be greedy with mkt topping
Classic wall street move keep strong!
I feel a continuation coming 
"Like I said, this stock can never maintain its gains, when it goes up you sell, it’s a day trader dream stock since it never keeps going up! Shorts and manipulators run the company not the management, they are powerless!"
"Not worried one bit, I am not selling until the market cap reaches a reasonable valuation of $5 billion."
The manipulation on this stock is disgusting
Solid fundament
So will be squeeeeeeezed big- another GEM
So discouraging day to day on Express. Is this being controlled by Hedge Funds or shorts or both? The stock starts the morning with some gains and by lunch time it heads back down. Macy's continues to go up the last few weeks. JW

If stock around 6.7 till 10.30 am will move higher to $10 cause earning was great 
I bought 2K average cost  6.79 I am not worried  that is $40 stock will soon $40 today will be $10
"Gals and Guys, this will fly soon (very near future) and the sky is the limit, you either jump in by buying more and hold to enjoy the $$$$$$$$$$$$$. or sit back and keep whining and crying that you missed the boat and why it went down for few days. remember, Patience is a key to success.STOP WHINING, hold and hold strongly and sell at the price you want."
Macys had a good quarter. Is this a good omen for Express? JW
"Just bought 100sh, WSB TAKE IT TO THE MOON."
I hope today will be $10 ?? Any moment
Macys up 3 dollars to day due to heavy Call buying and a positive holiday season. Is this a good omen for Express? I realize Express is not Macys. JW
"Take a look at A D T X. only 3rd company with a covid pill for 90 3rd world countries, not vaccines that are hard to ship to so many places and must be refridgerated. market cap should be higher than vxrtit is insulting, float so small, when they pop it, will be banaNA b a ba nana!sektor"
That stock is $50 worth I don’t know why keep going down every single day Earning was good Cash  flow good  future Good  
"@CJ I don't see anywhere on this board you posting a few weeks ago saying this stock will go down to $4...I do see you complain about management and the CEO almost every other day though.Funny how we replay things different in our minds than reality. Keep trying. Are you still holding a position even though you ""knew"" it was going to $4 a few weeks ago?! Why not sell then and buy back lower?!"

"It is just a profit taking day, that is normal in the stock market. Wait and be patient to enjoy $$$. Those who sold today, probably are the ones who bought at $3 or $4. They probably sold at $7.5 to buy again at a lower price, but unfortunately for them, the resistance is around $6.5 now. Remember, patience is a key to success."
"@CJ...do you hold a position in EXPR, and at what avg price? Maybe you should sell and go away instead of complaining daily?!Institutions are trying to push out weak hands to buy cheaper before holiday season...you can help the cause."
"For everyone whining and complaining you do realize this stock is up 465% this year dont you? Stop whining, watching the stock daily, and instead just treat it like a savings account. Patience people. If it was easy to get rich in a few weeks in the stock market, we would all have lots of dollars and money would be worthless."
Rocket time
"Is this a short squeeze today ? On my minute chart 5.98 is the next resistance. Now, will Express retrace all the gains today? JW"
Buy the rumor sell the news worked perfectly. Once the trade positions work themselves out this stock will move higher. I bought more. GREAT earnings will work itself into share price. patience
I think the only way to get this stock turned around is for us longs to give up and short it. For sure that will make it go up for me. Is EXPR really worth almost 30% lower after their earnings report?
^^^Express (EXPR) Stock Stands Out in a Strong Industry
"When most ppl don’t buy call options for $Expr, this will rise hard! This is why they manipulate the price now!"
We will see $8.50 tomorrow
How high can we go?
FYI this is not a meme stock.This has strong fundamentals And on the 25th it’s going to redeem itself
$GT $UPWK $Expr on FIRE!!
Even though I sold 75% of my shares at $7.50 I don't get why this stock is selling off after a surprise profit? The explanation of where it came from also makes no sense. The street was expecting a smaller loss. The valuation has be getting close to dirt cheap but that doesn't always mean a rally will happen. Seems to me this is a good company but a broken stock
This stock is a strong  buy
Drop all you want I wont panic as wanted!
It's not the short sellers that are driving this stock down since earnings. Future profits amid the economic pressures that determine in are what's on Investors minds when it comes to EXPR and others in the sector. This stock has been telegraphing for quite some time now that it wants to trade around the $4.50-$4.75 range
Is this stock riding on Macy's jet stream? Why is this insolvent company's stock going up?
Not selling
"Panic sell bs is the oldest trick in wall street. Won’t work on this old man, been around too many years to figure this bs out by hedgies"
Hey CJ you should be happy...CFO is leaving the company!
Yea it’s go break out hard soon
Congratulations
ohhhh yeh ylu weaklings! sell those golden nuggets ive been scooping them all up all day average now at $6.62 with 1682

Can we expect a $5.50 share range by dec? Or is that too hopeful. Looks like it may just be heading down from here on.
"I Never understand how certain companies with great earnings are just incapable of awarding their investors on their investment! That’s your function as a board and ceo and instead they reward short sellers and attract their interest, me soon to be included! Why would you invest in this company long knowing where it will go!"
Extremely strong price action. It's gonna pop.
"Hedge funds will attack this stock like they do with every company with good earning release. Buy more on the dip, screw them!"
thank you for the shares
"Very good results, share price should increase substantially to reflect the positive news."
Thank you market manipulators for giving me a chance to buy more!!!!
Start of the Thanksgiving and Christmas rally.
Another down day with new lows day after day. I assume several hedge fund are together riding this up for a small gain and then down to a new low. Still no news from the company. I did send an email to the man who oversees the investment category at the company. I am sure it will not make a difference. Does anyone on the board have any information about insiders buying? JW
Feels like I dodged a bullet. Sell the news. Wishing all good luck and feeling bad for what is happening. The market is rigged against the retail investor.
Should green up soon if stock hold $6.7 before 10.30am
loaded up 2k shares at 6.45 :D
Buy buy strong buy going $10 today just wait & watch
"News out now on the estimate earnings preview by 3 analysts on my Schwab Street Smart Edge platform. For the present quarter is a loss of 30 cents compared to the same quarter a year ago of l.48 . Revenues of 447m compared to the same quarter last year of 245m. The three analysts have a ""hold"" on the stock. JW"
Buying in around 6 could make you some decent money
It is retreating now.
Buy buy buy  this will hit $20 soon
Virtual investor event today 
Any explanation for the decline? No bashers please.
"Back on August 26th, MKM raised their price target to $6. Has anyone seen any information from the other three analysts who were present at the earnings call and virtual investor event?"
Best of both worlds meme and turnaround!

Profit taking driving stock down.
"Very positive articles in ""Barron's"" this weekend about retail stocks like Macys, TJ Max, Kohl's, and Ross Stores. Hope this is a good omen for Express that reports earnings in the morning on August 25th. Now the big question, "" As a person who holds shares do you continue to hold into earnings on Wednesday?"" JW"
"shorts own this, dominate it and run the show, long investors just like the board are hostages to their will and power."
"Remember what I said that 5 days ago? ****************************CJ5days agoI said it yesterday, Macy’s, TJ Max, all retail exploding, EXPR market cap comparison and sales is much Stronger, shorts will literally get crushed in coming days unless they cover, their entire investment in puts will get wiped out! Big miss calculation in their part!"
Is there any legal action or filing a complain with SEC can be taken ??
Tim Baxter gave an interview a couple weeks ago with a bullish outlook hinting at strong earnings. I'm guessing we will see positive net income and free cash flow. This thing is so undervalued and should be $40 at a minimum. Only a matter of time. Mark Aug 25th on your calendar for the pre-market earnings report.
I am a believer I think we can easily crack $8 by the end of 2023 which represents a health return. Buying $EXPR better than buying gold or crypto
$10 coming up soon hold your pants! 
"I don’t get it, company reports great numbers but guess people don’t want this stock to succeed for some reason smh"
My prediction: it will be a good ER. It will touch 9. Will dip back to 7.50 end of week

You’ll regret if you don’t buy now. Just saying
8.50 Thursday........guarantee
"The chart is looking very bullish, its gearing up for a nice run up. Buy and hold!"
"$EXPR to validate rumors of an buyout deal, announcement pending.."
back to $1 soon
Will Express maintain its gains this morning into the afternoon? Is this a short squeeze? Can it hit 6 dollars a share today? Are the hedge funds back into the stock. JW
meme stocks are soaring again. expr will follow. very low float and good entry right now
That is weird that this is dropping- sell on the news? Is that what is happening? Just curious- I will buy more - earnings were good
Fun fact exactly one year ago we closed at $0.66.
Earning was good cash flow good in hand  where is problem
Great stock. But in the market you always sell the news.
Look at the volume increase. There is buying and selling. Going on 9 million. JW
I hope the price keeps going down. We all know the real value of this company and I'm loading as much as possible. Thanks. LONG #$%$ APE KONG ?
