^^^Fair Value of $12-18 on X-Press
20 dollars coming. Get ready for a ride guys 
I don’t know how I ever traded without using (http://Thetraderguide.com)! I look forward to their daily emails each morning that list pre-market movers based on thoroughly researched stock market and world news. I highly recommend anyone who invests in the stock market!
"I'm holding this time, I've watched so many of these go from $7 to $25 it makes me sick, not missing out this time!"
Closing over $6
Why isn’t wsb talking about this?
"Gals and Guys, this will fly soon (very near future) and the sky is the limit, you either jump in by buying more and hold to enjoy the $$$$$$$$$$$$$. or sit back and keep whining and crying that you missed the boat and why it went down for few days. remember, Patience is a key to success.STOP WHINING, hold and hold strongly and sell at the price you want."
Is this stock riding on Macy's jet stream? Why is this insolvent company's stock going up?
Not selling
"@Conner I don't usually short. Buying puts if I see weakness is more my thing. Brought a boatload of August $8.00 put options today. I wish I had of brought yesterday, but you can't win them all. . I reckon I'll make a small fortune over the next few weeks. What say you? This thing has downtrend written all over it. See you guys tomorrow. I'll tell you tomorrow how I knew."
"If we focus on the short term we forget about the long term, PAYTIENCE"
"Hedgies are shorting trying to keep this one down. They are bleeding funds battling the retail investors on several meme plays. They can't keep these stocks down forever. AMC, EXPR, GME, SNDL, CLF and more"
Shorts continue to control this stock. What a disappointment. JW
"Today is the last day for 2nd quarter of stock market, may not run well but looking forward to July and August!"
"watching paint dry is fun, whether you are long or short"
what a #$%$..Thanks for nothing EXPR
My prediction: it will be a good ER. It will touch 9. Will dip back to 7.50 end of week
I feel a continuation coming 
Went to the mall EXPRESS packed with shoppers!!!!!!!
Just get to 8.00 already!
ITS GO TO 10$ tomorrow get ready
Tim Baxter gave an interview a couple weeks ago with a bullish outlook hinting at strong earnings. I'm guessing we will see positive net income and free cash flow. This thing is so undervalued and should be $40 at a minimum. Only a matter of time. Mark Aug 25th on your calendar for the pre-market earnings report.
Thank you market manipulators for giving me a chance to buy more!!!!
Ummm... is that not a head and shoulders pattern from early June on?
"1/3 of shorts gave up; short shares dropped from 6,400,000 to 4,230,000. Even shorts believe EXPR is way undervalued."
Buy buy strong buy going $10 today just wait & watch
^^^Short Squeeze Come On
This is red tomorrow lol
"$AMC $GME $BB $EXPR Are the best plays in the market and will be for a LONG time. IFYKYK Not financial advice strictly an opinion. ""Meme"" stocks is just a label to insight FUD sort of like ""Conspiracy Theorist"" I'm not a fan of $HOOD"
Profits and revenues exceeded estimates and stock is down ?? Don’t get it
"Hey, the short trade is working until it's not. Profits will soon determine the SP"
Aren’t we suppose to be going in the other direction?????
We will see $8.50 tomorrow
Could've bought AMC at $9 but I backed out at the last second. This time I'm going to go with my gut instinct and load up on this stock until it's atleast $20. Hodl strong apes and don't panic .
"It is just a profit taking day, that is normal in the stock market. Wait and be patient to enjoy $$$. Those who sold today, probably are the ones who bought at $3 or $4. They probably sold at $7.5 to buy again at a lower price, but unfortunately for them, the resistance is around $6.5 now. Remember, patience is a key to success."
easy buy at these prices!
Big gap up coming. Momentum is building.
Switching to call options today!
This stock is killing me and now I know what it means when the shorts control a stock. Nicolas is correct in trying to catch a falling knife. I guess I have dead money until the quarterly report. JW
"Just bought 100sh, WSB TAKE IT TO THE MOON."
ohhhh yeh ylu weaklings! sell those golden nuggets ive been scooping them all up all day average now at $6.62 with 1682
"The most bullish sign indicating a price reversal is coming is the amount of bashers and FUD that's thrown around about a stock. I've witnessed it time and time again. Within the last 12 months, I bought $LXU for $1.08; now it's at $8. Bought $BTU for $1.34; now it's at $9. Bought $EXPR for $0.87; now it's at $5. Bought $TELL for $0.95; now it's at $4. This, too, will be a multi-bagger within a few months. No doubt about it. What's my secret? Bottom-fishing *extremely* oversold companies. Clover Health, people, is as oversold as they come. All of those aforementioned investments, by the way, had a *ton* of ""lawsuit"" articles, doubters, bashers, short sellers, etc. No asset in the world stays extremely oversold and undervalued forever. Eventually value investors come along and scoop cheap stuff up. Same will happen here. Just be patient. $CLOV"
"Not worried one bit, I am not selling until the market cap reaches a reasonable valuation of $5 billion."
Why is it that retail investors that hold long term get burned 99% of the time? Because it's rigged.
"Remember what I said that 5 days ago? ****************************CJ5days agoI said it yesterday, Macy’s, TJ Max, all retail exploding, EXPR market cap comparison and sales is much Stronger, shorts will literally get crushed in coming days unless they cover, their entire investment in puts will get wiped out! Big miss calculation in their part!"
Buying more call options for today. Incredibly high number of $1 puts for 7/16. These are obviously being used to hide reported short interest. over 1mil shares borrowed to short today alone. Short sellers are buyers eventually just hold.
I love the smell of breakouts in the morning.
EXPR 1 bagger to $10+. Bull
Something absolutely wrong here
The chart is looking good for a breakout
Someone bought 1M. This will skyrocket EOW.
"Keep in mind, this is a $15 stock aside from Reddit. Time your position, do not sell. 30% today is nothing but 10% to a $15 stock."
This will be $10 by end of this week
The shorts are obviously in control for the last 3 days. The only solace I can take is that volume has been quiet. It does concern me that there doesn't seem to be a lot of people following it.
Profit taking driving stock down.
Let’s send this thing to the moon!!!! 8$ EOD?
This should run like $AMC this week!!
Maybe a short squeeze tomorrow..
Drop all you want I wont panic as wanted!
I brought a BOATLOAD of calls today!
"Again, be careful on catching a falling knife. This might be pricey right now."
"I said it yesterday, Macy’s, TJ Max, all retail exploding, EXPR market cap comparison and sales is much Stronger, shorts will literally get crushed in coming days unless they cover, their entire investment in puts will get wiped out! Big miss calculation in their part!"
$AMC$GME$EXPR
Just added another 4030 shares to my portfolio......bargain today.
I never understood that trading can be seamless until i used a brokerage recommended by Greg Maxwell I met him on telegram @gregfxglobalI was able to grow my 1.9 BTC to 10 BTC within a short term trading tenure being under his guidance
"I don’t get it, company reports great numbers but guess people don’t want this stock to succeed for some reason smh"
"If you look at different charts, this appears to be the next one to breakout among Meme stock."
The manipulation on this stock is disgusting
I am a believer I think we can easily crack $8 by the end of 2023 which represents a health return. Buying $EXPR better than buying gold or crypto
^^^CEO says ComeBack assured on ^EXPR^
"News out now on the estimate earnings preview by 3 analysts on my Schwab Street Smart Edge platform. For the present quarter is a loss of 30 cents compared to the same quarter a year ago of l.48 . Revenues of 447m compared to the same quarter last year of 245m. The three analysts have a ""hold"" on the stock. JW"
Classic wall street move keep strong!
"Here we go again, this stock can't hold any gains and it is very disappointing. I hope the next quarterly report will say this company has a future. Just broke the RL price of 4.90 and heading to 4.79 on my minute resistant chart. Will 4.79 hold? JW"
Did I mistake I just jump in $6.91 with 2000Shares I can keep it for next week or sell it please advice me
Where have all the rocket ships gone?
Let the Squeeze begin..................$9......by EOW.................GL
Hurray a better buying price for more calls!!
"Macy’s shooting up, tjmax same, shorts will get crushed on this post earnings"
"EXPR following chart sequence from AMC and GME, about a month or so behind - learn more at https://twitter.com/aboutheoptions/status/1408471900762804226?s=20"
"1.6 million shares have been borrowed to short in the first hour of trading. Get ready to see stars next week, i'd take advantage of this inorganic dip they're causing right now. Just bought another 250 shares and 5 $12 7/16 calls."
"Fantastic run this week! When in doubt zoom out. This is a value play, hold and enjoy the ride next week.Remember we already passed the second wave of shorts from February. The pressure is building."
"It is going down. Where ""short squeeze"" is?"
"Not bashing, just a question. Does the price tumbling over 40% from just a few weeks ago concern anyone? I mean why such a devastating fall?"
That is weird that this is dropping- sell on the news? Is that what is happening? Just curious- I will buy more - earnings were good
Pushing it down to lock in lower prices... this will be 10 in a month. Mark this post!
Buying in around 6 could make you some decent money
"Just as I predicted - positive net income and operating cash flow. This is the quarter where Express begins their comeback. This will eventually reach $40. Market cap will eventually reach $5 billion, on par with Revolve. Tim Baxter knows how to run a company. He is an awesome CEO. Today, the comeback begins. This is no longer a meme stock. This is a solid company with billions of revenue and solid fundamentals, that is severely undervalued."
How exciting.#AMC #GME #BB #EXPR # NOK
How high can we go?
"SSR is on for tomorrow. Buckle up shorts, longs gonna take you for a ride this week."
$8+ next week
Should I cash some of my options
GET READY BOIS
get ready...just starting booster for rocket 
Any explanation for the decline? No bashers please.
Bought EXPR today
Looks like its warming up for next take off!
Solid company on the right track. Making great progress. When this starts flying it's going to catch a lot of people off gaurd.
I will sell at $20.... all of them.
"I’ve been day trading for years and I’m so glad I finally found (http://Pick-stocks.com). They’re pre-market watchlists cover all the latest market-moving news, and they don’t beat you down with tons of ads. Highly recommend!"
Slingshot engaged lol
cash out at $7.05 / 60% profit. volume is getting thin. not gonna be greedy with mkt topping
LEVI apparel sales exceeded expectations; so will EXPR sales also exceed expectations.
Price hasn't fallen under VWAP average all day. Even with the RSI resets and dips. Good Luck next week shorts. Excercised my 5 $5 calls today and bought another 200 shares. Now we wait.
^^^Goin ^UP^
Come on REDDIT favorite fly to $40
I keep adding on dips... hold and then hold some more. 3 weeks till a double up!
Goes north of $10 AH easy. Pure manipulation to bring it back down. Just like the others this will run huge AH and Monday....Cheers!
^^^Get ON the ^X-Press
This week it will be $10 plus
"I remember buying 7100 shares for like $5,000 look at it now"
Rocket time
"if you look at the AMC chart and the EXPR chart for today, they have practically the identical shape"
Fake news - SQUELCHEDPatience pays off. $BBBY $NAKD $GME $BB $AMC $EXPR $MORE?
^^^$430M Market Cap is Too LOW
"Remember, $10 is the deserved price target. 2nd quarter earnings coming in about a month."
8$ coming soon
this stock is the pits
"Very positive articles in ""Barron's"" this weekend about retail stocks like Macys, TJ Max, Kohl's, and Ross Stores. Hope this is a good omen for Express that reports earnings in the morning on August 25th. Now the big question, "" As a person who holds shares do you continue to hold into earnings on Wednesday?"" JW"
I need at least $8.60 back
"Hedge fund players know the great potential in this one, otherwise they would not be here to scare you to sell so they buy. Play it smart or be a looser."
Best of both worlds meme and turnaround!
Small float and High short interest on $IMTE would be a huge squeeze if gets good volume $CUEN $EXPR $CLOV
Just hold on until $15
Even though I sold 75% of my shares at $7.50 I don't get why this stock is selling off after a surprise profit? The explanation of where it came from also makes no sense. The street was expecting a smaller loss. The valuation has be getting close to dirt cheap but that doesn't always mean a rally will happen. Seems to me this is a good company but a broken stock
Moon or Mars
Buy the rumor sell the news worked perfectly. Once the trade positions work themselves out this stock will move higher. I bought more. GREAT earnings will work itself into share price. patience
"not talking bad but this earnings run for most companies has done nothing but tank so i will buy puts bearish sign, then immediately sell them after earnings, bullish sign. then buy calls bullish sign"
EXPR.. buy & hold for $15-$20 by end of year!! There are millions of apes.. Everyone by 100 shares & destroy the hedgies!!
people are talking about $20 $40 blah blah blah I want to see this thing hit at least eight with some strength so far it hasn't shown me that
"Wow. Hey Charles, I hung on to those August puts today (Almost sold them yesterday!). What are your thoughts about Tuesday, I am thinking about dumping them? Or would you hold for another week?"
Can this dog ever go up 2 days in a row ?
Express is up 17.53% to 5.35
"There is news about Black Rock and Express, but I could not open the filing. Does anyone on the board have information about this issue? Thanks JW"
If stock around 6.7 till 10.30 am will move higher to $10 cause earning was great 
"Hedge funds will attack this stock like they do with every company with good earning release. Buy more on the dip, screw them!"
"no doubt that Hedge funds players have great faith in this one, so be smarter and let them pay you want and not what they want. Keep holding."
"Bought another 100 shares, what a discountIMO PT is 10"
push it up
IMO we get upgrades in mourning
Macys had a good quarter. Is this a good omen for Express? JW
It’s coming guys
^^^But at 10-30 Sell at 1-30!
"Wmt, Tgt, M, FL................retailers are beating earnings and have positive outlook for future earnings. Can't wait to see EXPR earnings"
I owned 3500 shares td Ameritrade average cost  6.65 & in Robinhood 1k average cost  7.27 more than 2K loosing right now
It is now obvious that Express is just a day trading stock. It is now under the control of the shorts. So disappointing. JW
thank you for the shares
Sorry guys. Conner was right and I was completely wrong. And I paid dearly for my mistake!
2nd Quarter Whale Wisdom site shows an increase in hedge fund holdings of 50.94 % and an improvement in the put/call ratio of 28%.
This goes red tomorrow
buckle up! we're going to the moon 
The company may give a June/qtr sales and ATM update Thursday morning. It could be a big positive.
I will say it once again the stock hits $8 I'm out bye bye until then I'll hold
Feels like I dodged a bullet. Sell the news. Wishing all good luck and feeling bad for what is happening. The market is rigged against the retail investor.
Extremely strong price action. It's gonna pop.
"We will get better clarity on retail apparel sales in the next two days. TGT and TJX report Wednesday morning, and KSS and M report Thursday morning."
Anyone know why this stock climbed today. I don’t have that much In the stock(only 400 dollars) was planning on buying it gradually. Is this just a fluke? Or is there anything worthy that is making it move?
Minor setback for a major comeback
and she is holding $6.00
"What a great buy this stock is, the sky is the limit with this one. Hold and sell only with your price and the not the forced price on you . Wait and enjoy the coming $$$$$"
Time to load up
Back to $10 soon
I waited 15minuts at checkout...blowout earnings this quarter
"Just received one of the items I ordered Wednesday night at 11:30PM. The rest of my order should be delivered on Monday. What's crazy is when I ordered I think the estimated delivery date was between July 10th and 12th. This is clearly a company that is turning it around. I've been holding shares for over a year now and I just keep adjusting my price target up to what they can be worth after they get back on track. Of course if this reddit craze continues, I may see my target much sooner, or just raise it even higher!"
stock market does a transfer of wealth from the impatient to the patient
I use the lion shirts to wipe up messes on floor now.
here we go!
reddit
Bought more today @ 4.45
Bought this sock accidentally. Didn't even knows that was. Now I make profit with it
chart speaks for itself !!!
not much volume or action in price..this shld hv been 7.25 today at least
https://trendytoros.com/stocks/opinions/expr/
Last week CEO said they are making money and went up to $7.50 to $8 now back to under $5. I hope EXPRESS earning Aug-25 will be good. Get chance to get this range $4.75- to $4.80 . Next week and following earning week might be $10 above
this will bounce back before EOD
^^^Why Shares of Express Are Jumping Today?
It going to cross $20 by July 16 th hold on
Good article from Investor Place stating Express is undervalued based on prospective positive cash flow by Mark R. Hake. His expectations are for a price of $9.58.
"Good Morning, Quick reminder that roughly 30% of daily volume for the past 3 months has been short volume. There are an insane amount of $0.50 puts for 7/16 obviously being used to hide short positions from when they were opened (January 28- Feb 2) Dates sound familiar? The hole is being dug deeper and deeper, or if you'd prefer to think of it this way. The short sellers are pulling the rubber band back further and further until it snaps and this ticker goes flying."
Look at the volume increase. There is buying and selling. Going on 9 million. JW
How do we know the SSR is on?
"Keep holding Girls and Boys. I am still holding to my 90,000 sharesRemember, patience is a key to success, and sell with the price you want Keep holding. This will jump just like AMC did. $10 is low for this one, aim higher to win big."
Solid fundament
"Keep holding until $10 atleast guys, trust. "
"Must be painful today. If the sentiment is not good on the weekend, you can expect this to open much lower on Tuesday! This second round of short squeeze on meme stocks is already fading and will be over in less than a week."
Told you. Next time it tries to move it will be for real. This time we have what I call a fake out.
^^^Buy IN at 5-74
"$EXPR is similar to $SCVL. The latter also had great revenues and earnings but is down today, and $SCVL has outstanding fundamentals. For some reason Apparel is doing poorly today even on fantastic news. I'll be buying more of both."
$10 coming up soon hold your pants! 
"The hedge funds pushed the Cramer buy, buy, buy button."
EXPR's chart is very bullish. Whenever there's a pullback it shows higher low and higher high with each rally. We will see $9 ~$9.25 at the next rally.

"Power hour to $8.. everyone buy 10 shares., I am getting more!!"
"On my minute chart for Express, 6.57 is resistance one and the stock must get though this level before it can move forward. Next resistance level is 6.96. Need more volume to get through these levels. JW"
"It is moving, can EXPR break the resistance at 6.98? JW"
why down today...while GME and AMC holding ok
@Jim I listening. What is your point?
Looking forward to August and the move up!
EXPR doesn't disappoint!
"Remember, Patience is a key to success"

"^^^Express, Inc. Announces Two Events: Second Quarter 2021 Financial Results to Be Reported on August 25, 2021; Virtual Investor Event to Be Hosted on August 26, 2021"
"Would love to see $7.5 today. Going to need RSI to reset and not have too big of a dip and this thing has some real room to run. We just passed over 2nd wave shorts from the bounce in Feb. Tons of pressure will be building on shorts, keep holding and let it blow."
I bought 2K average cost  6.79 I am not worried  that is $40 stock will soon $40 today will be $10

I GOT SMOKED BUYING PUTS!!!!
Yea it’s go break out hard soon
Should green up soon if stock hold $6.7 before 10.30am
Just wait .... it’s gonna blow people will fomo & it will drive it higher
"If you think Express is overvalued at this market cap and short it, you deserve losing your money. This is an obviously suppressed stock, with no real bear case other than the COVID shutdown impact. Earnings look good, and retail is rebounding."
Bought 818 shares at $7.30. Nervous bit had a gut feeling. Anyone holding over the weekend. This stock scares me.
It is retreating now.
The storm is coming. Nothing can stop what is coming. Eyes wide open. Got popcorn? All peices in play. We are more connected than you think. $AMC $GME $BB $EXPR JAN. 27TH alarm clock.
"Very good results, share price should increase substantially to reflect the positive news."
Great stock. But in the market you always sell the news.
20 here we come. tomorrow boom boom day
loaded up 2k shares at 6.45 :D
Not even considering anything until $10/share.
here we go baby
"Why panic, when the market is down, this may also be down., what is new about that, just like most other stocks. If you are worried, then never get in. Hold to Win. Lots of good potential in this stock. For sure you will celebrate when you win, but you will cry when you loose, so hold to be a winner to celebrate and don't be a looser because you sold early when this skyrockets."
"Hold for three key points in time: 2nd quarter earnings calls in Aug, Black Friday, and 3rd quarter earnings call in Nov. 2021 is golden year for apparel retail. Again, this is undervalued stock by market cap and by daily volume. Look it up against gap and american eagle. Hold long term you will multiply your profit and gain tax free over a year."
AMC will do the same soon!
$10 here we come!!
Touches $12 next week.....bank on it!!!
Looks going to close around $6.40

Good morning fellow longs
"Look at this stock few month ago, it was almost half of today's value, this new resistance (give or take around $4.6) is a great new. keep holding and enjoy."
"Holding up well, setting up nicely for the next leg up"
"nice mm manipulation today to keep options OTM, I loaded up on calls, see you on the moon"
$-10-$19 this week. And the next $28
"I am sure we get pummeled today, but I think it is a fine play to buy and hold. We can break 10 by the end of the decade so just hold tight"
They had some interesting insights about EXPR on (http://Thetraderguide.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
DIAMOND HANDS will pay off
"These survivors are all eventually going to get rewarded as the virus case load dips yet again. Strange how it spikes, nobody does anything differently, and then it recedes without good reason. Regardless EXPR probably being held back a little by common investor concerns over Delta. 2-3 weeks from now when case counts wane for reasons nobody really understands ( see Indida and it's Delta crisis from earlier this summer) EXPR will achieve a more reliable price. I imagine we will easily crack 6-6.50 before year end"
"big dip, load up on calls"
"Added an other 400 shares , holding total 5000 at this time .."
"Stop whining like a bunch of little girls. In the last month EXPR I was gone from $4.50 to over 750 if you didn’t sell some calls or take a little profit, that’s your problem. Management sounded upbeat analyst questions were realistic and complementary. Forward guidance was OK You have an￼an off day app and sometimesDays like this separate them in for the boys you clear out some weak hands weak hands I hate Siri sometimes, you’ll be fine the stories pretty good they think they can do 1 billion in e-commerce in the next two years relax you’ll be fine.￼"
THIS WEEK ME MOOOOOON 
higher highs...higher lows
They had some interesting insights about EXPR on (http://Rightpicker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
I couldn’t be happier with the daily emails I get from (http://Pick-stocks.com). They give me the best daily advice based on stock market news and help me make wiser decisions when it comes to investing. An absolute must for any investor!
Bought EXPR today at 5.9
To the meme's out there lets get this stock up in 20 dollar range so they can sell some stock and help this American company on their way back!!!!!!!!!
This trade is becoming very predictable. Buy tomorrow at around $4.75 and then sell at $5.10 the next day. Do this over and over again and make money. This can't lose strategy could work at least until earnings day
Congratulations now is out of danger ️ now 10.3 am went to $6.73 now time to run  buy buy strong buy
