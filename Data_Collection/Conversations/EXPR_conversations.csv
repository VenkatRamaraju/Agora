"@CJ...do you hold a position in EXPR, and at what avg price? Maybe you should sell and go away instead of complaining daily?!Institutions are trying to push out weak hands to buy cheaper before holiday season...you can help the cause."
Roxanne Meyer of MKM Partners has a buy rating on EXPR with a $6 price target. The price drop is overdone.
Is there any legal action or filing a complain with SEC can be taken ??
"Will the story be the same for Express today, up in the morning and down in the afternoon with a lower low? Will the back to school and Christmas revenues and earnings make a difference in a rise in the stock by the end of the year? Or, will the hedge funds and short sellers keep Express from rising and drive it lower. Time will tell !!! Love you."
So will be squeeeeeeezed big- another GEM
Hey CJ...stock up...you should thank management today
Another down day with new lows day after day. I assume several hedge fund are together riding this up for a small gain and then down to a new low. Still no news from the company. I did send an email to the man who oversees the investment category at the company. I am sure it will not make a difference. Does anyone on the board have any information about insiders buying? JW

It's not the short sellers that are driving this stock down since earnings. Future profits amid the economic pressures that determine in are what's on Investors minds when it comes to EXPR and others in the sector. This stock has been telegraphing for quite some time now that it wants to trade around the $4.50-$4.75 range
"They coned you all with that holiday season BS didn’t they, kept you all in? Nothing will ever change with retail investors. Stock market these days is just a Chanel to transfer money from little guys to hedge funds and elite. Year after year!"
Macys up 3 dollars to day due to heavy Call buying and a positive holiday season. Is this a good omen for Express? I realize Express is not Macys. JW
"$EXPR to validate rumors of an buyout deal, announcement pending.."
This will be epic.
Start of the Thanksgiving and Christmas rally.

"@CJ I don't see anywhere on this board you posting a few weeks ago saying this stock will go down to $4...I do see you complain about management and the CEO almost every other day though.Funny how we replay things different in our minds than reality. Keep trying. Are you still holding a position even though you ""knew"" it was going to $4 a few weeks ago?! Why not sell then and buy back lower?!"
