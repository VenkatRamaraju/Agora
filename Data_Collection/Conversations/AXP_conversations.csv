"This stock is getting crushed, run away as fast as you can. Sell and buy peanut butter instead."
Visa tanking on slowing growth...Master card tanking too...Only the rich AMEX customer seems unscathed so far......we will see.....
Why is growth expected to be flat next year? Been wanting to buy this one for a long time but my timing of interest has been horrible. If someone who follows the company could chime in I'd appreciate it. I get that the soft comparisons to 2020 will be gone. But still expected to see like at least a 10% expected growth.
AXP is up 5.18% to 186.67
"For the long term, there's still a lot more this can go. At $39B it can easily be scooped up by a $V Visa which has a $500B market cap, or $MA with a $330B market cap, or $PYPL $JPM $BAC $AXP. Affirm is disrupting the space, and adding so much value. Consumer spending are reaching records - look at bank earnings this AM, and Ecommerce continues to accelerate, making this a no brainer for the long run."

$AXP top expectations +5%. So $V and $MA will do.
AXP inched a little closer to that $200 mark this week. Good solid earnings coming up should push it over.
Shareholders need a LARGE dividend increase.
"With a PE of 8, beating the street, increased sales and revenues, $DFS is still a great buy and has tons of room to grow before catching up to $V, $MA, and $AXP. Could easily be a $300 stock today. With this small pull back, it's a great opportunity to get in."
Based on expected five years earnings growth AXP should be trading at about 70% higher.
"AXP's new company motto should be ""Let's Go Brandon"" because this company is too sinking like a rock!"

AXP and MA is a buy at these levels as Consumer Spending is going to rebound and CORP travel coming back
"There's a lot of end of the world woke talks on this thread. I shall refrain from discussing politics but AXP has gone through tough times before and managed to bounce back. Remember when it last Costco? In an era of ESG investing, all else equal, AXP will be an attractive investment for generation Z investors."
"As a travel card specialist, it needs to work on its card acceptance rate outside of the US. The expectation should be to wipe out your card and be able to use it. Having to ask a merchant if you're accept AE implies that accepting an AR is the exception and not the norm."
This pop lasts for about few days and then gives back. It cannot sustain this move when Conssumer spending is going to slow down 4th Qtr.It's manipulated by Institutions to pump up and they will dump around later
