Still .55 x 4 x18=$39.60... LKQ is way too far beat up on this at $30s..for a stock that could be $50 just down the pike.
great entry base. numbers will bring it back and higher by next quarter.
"LKQ is a good recession stock, when times become difficult, new car sales shift to repairing used ones .... ANDTariffs are adding to new car prices. BUY this stock on any drop"
LkQ beat revenues with 2.7 billion est + 2.63 B..but fell short with .55 with ests at .59.. Wow that does not seem that bad ..guess a great buying time..RE: My price average is now $15. So I am still way up.
LKQ is down -13.04% to 32.69
Why would a company like this get hammered so bad? less driving so l fewer accidents and fewer repairs until we can move about freely? It's now trading at book value with a current ratio of 2. I'm adding to my position!
"Just bought a few thousand shares on Thursday at $26.21. My one year goal is $34-35. The slowing of the company's growth rate to 8-10% per year appears priced in. Also, a slowing economy means fewer cars being sold....and more older cars on the road likely to be needing repairs."
NOT SELLING!!!
"Good, looks like we are out of that slump and back in the gravy ..$40 near term and hopefully $50 + at 2020"
Currently long with a target price $51
"TWST: Did you want to mention one final company?Mr. Villere: There’s another business called LKQ (NASDAQ:LKQ). It’s a common term for like, kind and quality. They’re basically supplying refurbished and recycled auto parts to mostly body shops that are the same as new or OEM parts, but they’re about 20% to 50% cheaper. They’ve been under a little bit of pressure. They had a weaker quarter. And I think that creates the opportunity.They’re just finalizing an acquisition of something called Stahlgruber, which is the leading aftermarket parts distributor in Germany. And at their most recent analyst day, they talked about trying to improve margins, and they think they can improve their EBITDA margins about 500 basis points over the next 36 months. It also trades much cheaper than its peer group — down at almost 13 times numbers when you look at some of their peers that trade closer to 18 to 19 times.It’s just a key part of an insurance company’s business, and they are able to replace and fix your car with an exact like-in-kind part, but a much, much cheaper part, so one that I think is going to still work out well. And it is still very cheap.https://www.twst.com/interview/buying-high-quality-businesses-that-arent-on-wall-streets-radar"
down enough for me. just started a position. gltal
"Thoughts on this earnings call. Gm strike still has stuff on delay, huge car exchange with all these new car deals (recondition business on trades) and parts plant closures. Seems used parts are in demand. Up up"
I don't want to sound like Zolly but this is almost a sure bet going back to the 40's
This stock went up over 70% for the year and just crushed earnings. PE is only 18. Upped guidance. It should be much higher. Guess it’s not sexy.
good earnings today lkq is a company that will thrive on good times or bad .people not buying new cars fixing old and accidents will always haplen aswell .
people will be driving again and smashing .the body shops are still busy with work left over .im in the auto repair business and use lkq regularly.this is a no brainer stock for me .wish they had dividends !
you should see their new headquarters being built by me in Nashville. its awesome and the future is very bright.
soon everyone will be keeping their cars for ever so these guy will make a fortunate selling use dparts
"After this German deal is set revenues per share will be about $38, up from about $31.55 and price about $50. to $58 IMHO."
