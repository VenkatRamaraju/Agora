"Long term, it's a solid company. The basis of it works. Used auto parts will be around for a LONG time, if not MORE considering cars have more and more parts each year that cost on average more. Dismantlers will be the KINGS of this business."

Why would a company like this get hammered so bad? less driving so l fewer accidents and fewer repairs until we can move about freely? It's now trading at book value with a current ratio of 2. I'm adding to my position!

"Just bought a few thousand shares on Thursday at $26.21. My one year goal is $34-35. The slowing of the company's growth rate to 8-10% per year appears priced in. Also, a slowing economy means fewer cars being sold....and more older cars on the road likely to be needing repairs."

"TWST: Did you want to mention one final company?Mr. Villere: There’s another business called LKQ (NASDAQ:LKQ). It’s a common term for like, kind and quality. They’re basically supplying refurbished and recycled auto parts to mostly body shops that are the same as new or OEM parts, but they’re about 20% to 50% cheaper. They’ve been under a little bit of pressure. They had a weaker quarter. And I think that creates the opportunity.They’re just finalizing an acquisition of something called Stahlgruber, which is the leading aftermarket parts distributor in Germany. And at their most recent analyst day, they talked about trying to improve margins, and they think they can improve their EBITDA margins about 500 basis points over the next 36 months. It also trades much cheaper than its peer group — down at almost 13 times numbers when you look at some of their peers that trade closer to 18 to 19 times.It’s just a key part of an insurance company’s business, and they are able to replace and fix your car with an exact like-in-kind part, but a much, much cheaper part, so one that I think is going to still work out well. And it is still very cheap.https://www.twst.com/interview/buying-high-quality-businesses-that-arent-on-wall-streets-radar"

I work in the auto industry and the usage of aftermarket/refurbished parts by insurance companies and extended warranties is being pushed to the point OEM's are struggling. This is a growing industry no doubt. As long as management performs this company cannot lose
