I see higher volume towards the end of business day... at all time high . Strong buy
HST is down -100.00% to 0.00
Will this puppy ever pay a dividend again?
"Today 10/11/2019.........RBC cut Host Hotels & Resorts price target to $19 from $23. Maintained a market perform rating. No mention of this ""headline news"" on the Yahoo news feeds. Why??????? Because yahoo News is filtered so you won't get the FULL information you need on a company........only what Yahoo wants you to see."
All I hear is Echo…. Anyone here??
When can we expect an announcement about restoring the dividend? Think this earnings call? Thanks!
What will happen when volume pickes up? Strong buy
Host Hotels & Resorts reached a 52 Week low at 13.74
"The extra $.05 per share dividend is an indication of the strength in their balance sheet. No where to put the ""extra"" cash flow so they are returning it to the shareholders ......as they should. This stock gets an UPGRADE by me. Price target of $20/share by March 31, 2020."
"Look at the replacement cost of these hotel properties, in combined, it costs 2X the market cap of this company. Talk about under-valued stock, yeah, I just added another 1000 shares to my existing 700 shares. My cost basis is now about $13 altogether. Sure, I'm still down, but I'm feeling just fine. Now, I do turn around and write OTM covered call to further lower cost basis. This stock is a keeper."
"$mark @@at casinos, malls, and now $HST hotels... could possibly be a huge development for the stock $5"
Hotels should convert to haunted houses. So ghostly
"Of all the stock advice services I have used, I find (http://Fairstox.com) to be one of the absolute best! Their advice is well researched, helpful, and up to date. I don’t know how I ever went about day trading without reading their newsletter first!"
It’s been more than a year since the dividend has been “temporarily” suspended.
Going under 12 I promise you.. will trade 10-13 for the next two years if you’re lucky. Dividend... who knows what financing levers they’ll need to pull to prop up earnings and stabilize share price..
"Dividend?Tease me, say dividend is coming soon"
Picked as last trade on CNBC halftime report by Najarian. He bought it while on air.
Should have a great quarter back into the 20s Long term hold
Bullish this week. Looking to see $15
"Cheap, margin is too small compared to Hilton, dividend is generous, forward guidance is bearish with low PEG ratio which kinda makes no sense"
