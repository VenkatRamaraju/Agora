"The extra $.05 per share dividend is an indication of the strength in their balance sheet. No where to put the ""extra"" cash flow so they are returning it to the shareholders ......as they should. This stock gets an UPGRADE by me. Price target of $20/share by March 31, 2020."

"08/14/2020 - This stock will rocket back above $14 by end of Fall 2020. Management will bring back dividend bit by bit by end of the year. By mid 2021, HST will be back to what it used to be. People are so sick and tired of staying home that they are outright ignoring these stay-at-home order. You think this $10/share price will last? Think again."

"Look at the replacement cost of these hotel properties, in combined, it costs 2X the market cap of this company. Talk about under-valued stock, yeah, I just added another 1000 shares to my existing 700 shares. My cost basis is now about $13 altogether. Sure, I'm still down, but I'm feeling just fine. Now, I do turn around and write OTM covered call to further lower cost basis. This stock is a keeper."

I like it.......sell some 3.375% notes (due in 2029) and use the proceeds to eliminate 5.25% and 6% debt. And also do a couple of high margin projects. GOOD MOVE!
