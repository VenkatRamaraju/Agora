Just peeking in doing a little research on what Bard buys. This company just had a terrible earnings and the stock price goes up? Makes no sense. Overpriced.
Notice subway surfer did not deny working for white diamond.
Buyout ?
CEO Ward Paxton has died at the age of 83. RIP
Looks like the shorts are starting to cover. Time for them to move on.
short at 6.15 out at 4.95 easiest money in awhile. Thx fellas!
my life savings :(
Good to see Insiders buying.
"Why A Cybersecurity Expert Who Calls Intrusion And Its New Shield Product “Garbage” - $4 Price Target (INTZ) Here are the summary points: Intrusion (INTZ) hired a promotional CEO last year, launched a new product called Shield, and its stock has risen 800%+. Shield has no patents, certifications, or insurance, which are all essential for a new cybersecurity product. Shield is based on open-source data already available to the public. The datasheets and white papers on INTZ’s website don’t show details on what their products do, they just have empty buzzwords. The companies that took part in Shield’s beta test case study are associated parties. INTZ’s new chairman of the board, Tony LeVecchio, was also the chairman of the board for UniPixel (UNXLQ), which was a touch screen technology pump and dump scam that went bankrupt and faced SEC charges. INTZ’s own investor relations rep said the former CFO, who was with the company for 34 years, resigned because he’s “scared to death”. The Paxton family sold hundreds of thousands of INTZ at $8 apiece in October of last year, and are continually selling shares today, with millions more shares to go. https://whitediamondresearch.com/research/why-we-agree-with-a-cybersecurity-expert-who-calls-intrusion-and-its-new-shield-product-garbage-4-price-target/"
It would’ve nice to get some news on sales after their Beta test. I wold think with the recent security breaches sales would be very strong if the product works as well as management reported.
"ya know, if everyone who owns shares just doesn't offer to sell under $20, this thing will go up..."
Funny how the shorts want us to do their due diligence for them. So the first White Diamond report quoted cyber dad so he’s obviously lying and is a plant. And Subway if you guys are so legit how come I can’t find any information on where your business is located? A random “info” email as your companies only contact doesn’t scream legitimate whatsoever. But keep trying Wall St. obviously doesn’t believe you with the stocks performance today.
Jack Blount is proving a lot of naysayers wrong! I am glad I read the right tea-leaves...
"is anyone else confused as to why INTZ is NOT being mentioned by big media, since Shield supposedly neutralizes EXACTLY what we're being told has happened? I get it - it's a tiny compnay - but GEEZ - you can't tell me the bozos on this message board (I'm including me on that description) are smarter than all the analysts, IT people, the companies that have recently seen Blount and been told about the Shield product... why the HELL isn't MSFT just BUYING this company outright? I'm long INTZ, don't get me wrong - been in since $12 - just seems like this is the PERFECT STORM for some major headlines on Intrusion..."
"Added on the dip, like what company has to offer. Now that legal issues are off the board, hope company has some positive news for us. Still think we have a 10 bagger if they con execute."
Great SEC investigation
Every time i bought this stock it drops. I bought 23.3 thinking it is the lowest but ... no
Nice comeback.
So what day do they officially hit the Nasdaq?
I'm buyin the dips into 2021.
"well THAT was interesting. Closed RIGHT on $11. Picked up some shares at the end thinking the limit orders wouldn't fill. the Nasdaq papers were filed today, it *looks* like it uplists tomorrow... so was this another swoop to clear off limit sells and collect shares for a (hopeful) pop tomorrow? Stay tuned!"
"I posted weeks ago my hope that Shield would prove to be effective against the recent Russian hack of our critical public/private infrastructure. Today's confirmation by management to this effect is incredibly important. IMO, Shield is bound for adoption on a mega scale. GLTA"
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-strong-buy-penny-stocks-143623262.html
"I was literally just thinking this thing is ripe for a fake short report.White Diamond is a total joke, with a terrible track record.I am going to wait and see what happens at ER, if I give back profits then so be it...They just announced 50,000 seats with the product on sale for only 2 months, I need to see if they can expand on that.Hopefully they announce some more deals to put this BS to rest.With that said, this is still a speculative stock and who knows exactly where we will end up."
Blount where are you? If he doesn't respond soon stock will be 4bucks
idk I feel like I told you all 2 days ago that this wasnt gonna last  were probably going to see low 3s by tomorrow.
@coolguydupe Agreed.... this is a home run or a dud...time will tell. They sure have been spending the capital by hiring a lot of people over the past few months from what I can tell. The company must believe they have a winner with Shield... hopefully they do.
"the way the press release reads, it sounds like Blount may have been fired? Plus I think they're looking for a company to buy them out. If nothing else, they're going to raise money, probably with new shares. I had a lot of hope for this company."
Kimberly Clark is a huge company. hopefully just the beginning!
Blount bought on 5/11 5724shs @ 9.94.Levecchio on 5/12 bought 5000shs @ 9.72
The best response to the short hit piece is to announce several more major contracts.
No idea why this stock is dropping. This company is growing very well and by 2022 will have a positive Earnings. No reason this stock is below 20
Powerful and huge after hours coming
@brokemelvin!  make some money instead of hating
Green after hours .
This little known World security company will not survive 2021 without being bought out. They have the largest unique botique entity catalogue of any including Palo or Crowd or Comv
"It looks as if the security crisis is over; otherwise, this company would be at 30 right now. In the meantime lawyers are riding on the backs of these investors."
"New here with a small grab of shares - trying to get a feel for the potential. Does anyone know if Shield can be used in tandem with other security platforms? In other words, if a firm is using Crowdstrike or ZScaler, is it feasible to also use Shield to get the breaches already in the system? If it CAN work in tandem, this could get really popular really fast - it wouldn't be so much a competitor to those companies as it would be complimentary."
Does anyone know the reason for today's >20% gain in the first trading hours?
Time to buy?
No negative posting of a video clip has any power over your stock unless you act on it. I ignore those who have no vested interest in my wealth building. I treat it like a parade here it comes there it goes. I hold steady and make money.
Buy the dip! today/tomorrow volume will be 2x. Returning to $5 very soon.
"Company doing all the right things to grow, and seems to have a great product that just proved out in beta testing. Holding for long term..."
Any suggestions for a good entry point?￼
"seriously, I'm in big trouble now, how did I buy 15k worth at the top??"
"Kimberly Clark, 3 yr deal.That is a great sign. They wouldn't do a 3 yr deal if this wasn't good...It is as simple as that."
Such a big opportunity here.
"Read the disclosure, on White Dimond. Its just a hit piece, guys."
Should not have provoked MXL.
what's running this up ?
"I just bought in a small position, today."
anyone ever file a class action suit against companies that write fraudulent short reports?
Trying to make a base ?
Just opened up a position with 1000 shares. No reason this shouldn't be right back where it left off
New INTZ report published today:https://whitediamondresearch.com/research/while-intrusion-is-buying-fake-awards-we-are-lowering-our-price-target-from-4-00-to-2-50/
sell while you can
Someone leaked the pricing of the offering...only thing I can think to explain the 60% drop over the last week. I hope the SEC investigates.
"Man what a deal, I've been waiting to get in this thing with some more shares, did a market order buy at open, filled at $8.4!Now let's sell some cybersecurity! I like this company and I think it is a lucky buy point given it's potential!"
"Very interesting times for Intrusion. Impressed by the investor call, Jack has always been a positive speaker and obviously believes in the future potential of Shield. The value in this product is unlimited and the investment in a strong Executive team is another positive step towards future shareholder value.Happy to hold throughout 2021, interested to see how the beta testing goes with the Fortune 100 & 500 companies Jack mentions in the call. As mentioned by a number of previous posters, this company is a relative unknown for most. This may change soon - good luck to all investors."
EOD prediction - $4.30Did I get it right ?
Volume Please
forsure touches 7 bucks again with the float n volume
"At this rate of decline the company doesn't need to respond , the stock will be $ 4.00 next week ,the short report target"
@----- is a notorious pumper and shorty. He’s done this with other stocks. Has he already claimed to have purchased millions and will retire off this?
"LMAO -45% drop and your response is ""company is growing very well"""
"Oh well, unfortunately 10% holder Michael Paxton has filed to sell 50,000 shs"
Will go back up to 6.00
NEW CONTRACT -- do it. Boolean
"If this drops more I will definitely buy more.Nobody has made a legitimate bear argument at all in anyway.The 3 yr Kim Clark deal and the massive vendor team they have brought online show that there are a lot more reasons to be bullish than bearish.Any fraud (with a proven track record of fraud) can claim a stock is a scam, but there is no evidence to indicate a scam in anyway."
"Nobody knows about this !!!A True ""Hidden Gem"" !!I'm cautiously super optimistic !"
Well... without news... it could recover even today.
Strong buy - big money wants in hence the premarket bs yet again
They need a lot of funds to push their product out. Losing an experienced CEO like Jack is a huge loss and will take time to recover from. This thing will trade low for awhile until they can show sales are picking up.
Intrusion is up 16.44% to 12.68
Why do people post negative comments if they are not shorts?Good Samaritans I suppose.
"Shield stopped more than 77 million threats, protecting businesses from serious cyberattacksPLANO, Texas, Jan. 13, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- With recent cyberwarfare attacks being carried out against the United States, the general availability of the new cybersecurity solution from INTRUSION Inc. (NASDAQ: INTZ), Shield, comes at a time when it’s never been more important to expertly protect U.S. organizations – public and private, large to small. Shield is the first solution for the enterprise that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to not only identify malicious activity within a network but to kill the connection, thus stopping those threats in their tracks, protecting companies from debilitating cybercrime.“This product just does not exist in the market today and is sorely needed,” said Aaron, chief information security corporate officer (CISCO) for B. Riley Financial, who participated in beta testing.Beta testing of INTRUSION Shield confirmed the solution’s efficacy by stopping a total of 77,539,801 cyberthreats from 805,110 uniquely malicious entities attempting to breach 13 companies that participated in the 90-day beta program. Shield was able to continuously protect these companies from ransomware, denial of service attacks, malware, data theft, phishing and more. In fact, analysis by INTRUSION also concluded that Shield would have defended against the Sunburst malware that was at the heart of the recent cyberattacks involving SolarWinds and FireEye, which impacted many government agencies and 18,000 SolarWinds customers.“With the high-risk patterns we’ve incorporated into the rule set that feeds our AI, along with the reputation and suspicious activity that it searches for while monitoring all traffic in and out of a network, we can confidently say Shield would have protected our customers where clearly other security approaches failed,” said Jack B. Blount, President and CEO of INTRUSION. “The malware had been living on the SolarWinds network for at least nine months undetected – it got past firewalls and many other cybersecurity products. This is all the more reason companies need a multi-layered approach to cybersecurity, and specifically one that stops threats in real-time to protect them from the damage cybercriminals can cause over time.”All companies participating in the beta program have made the decision to move forward with Shield in production.“The Shield solution has shown us that virtually every network is already infected, and front-end protection is not possible. The understanding that networks are already compromised and that the only means of protection is to monitor and restrict outgoing traffic is the breakthrough of the Shield philosophy,” said Richard, President of NovaTech.Additionally, false positive security alerts – where legitimate traffic is identified as a threat – are a significant problem among cybersecurity solutions available today, with Ponemon Institute reporting that most cybersecurity companies see mistaken alerts happening 33% of the time. Cybersecurity professionals spend hundreds of hours investigating these alerts only to determine ultimately that there was no threat. Beta testing for Shield showed a median false positive rate of 0.001% of all traffic, far surpassing other solutions on the market and allowing businesses to run uninterrupted. Multiple beta customers were happy to report they saw zero false positives using Shield.“Businesses simply can’t afford to keep using the same cybersecurity solutions that aren’t adequately protecting them,” said Blount. “As shown by our beta testing results, Shield offers the best new layer of protection to keep businesses of all sizes safe from the cybercrime that causes hundreds of them to go out of business completely.”“The ease and instant protection of Shield has been great,” said Michael, Portfolio Manager for Bard Associates. “It’s so simple to implement and run, yet highly effective.”Shield is the only real-time, AI-based cybersecurity solution that utilizes the world’s largest Big Data Cloud of databases built upon 25 years of tracking and researching cybercrime activities. The solution’s AI uses this information to kill known threats, as well as to learn the behaviors of both safe and malicious network traffic. It then works from the inside out – every millisecond of every day – identifying all attempted malware connections coming into, living on, and going out of a network, and immediately stopping them without human intervention.Shield is now available at a low cost of $20 per seat ($2,000 minimum) per month with no annual contract required. Visit https://www.intrusion.com/shield for more information.INTRUSION will be releasing case studies from Shield beta testing in the coming weeks.About INTRUSION Inc.INTRUSION, Inc. is a global provider of entity identification, high speed data mining, cybercrime and advanced persistent threat detection solutions.

Awesome news! This is just the beginning - they just gained awesome credibility in the market. This could be up to $8M in recurring revs from this customer alone.
"This is a joke, right. The CEO said the Company is growing and positive earnings by 2022, but the stock is down 52%. This guy has a future in politics."
"well OF COURSE this hit piece by some 4th rate short house must be true! Kimberly-Clark are well known to do ZERO due diligence before handing over their site security to a new company. All you gotta do is say ""please""..."
conf call was very good. just need to patiently wait to 2021 and add in dips...
Blount is out. He promised a lot that he didn’t deliver. Now the board has to explain why Shield isn’t selling. Maybe their star product doesn’t work after all.
Good price holding !!! Will be up tmr good luck

"INTZ is a fast growing, profitable small cap stock, pretty nice."
Probably some short outfit paid a gig worker to write that white diamond masterpiece.
"Hey White Diamond, how's your CLSK short looking ?!?!?!How much $ did you lose on that one??? What a total joke you are.I know you look on this board, because the basis for your fake short report was made from some comments on this board... Great analysis right there..."
got back in! lets go
What news is driving the stock up yesterday and today?
"Jack Blount the CEO and president of this business is the the guy that turned IBM from 50million dollar company into a 2 billion dollar company in just 6 years, if ever there was a company to invest in and feel in safe hands its this mans company. good luck to all when this company hits the big bucks "
"INTZ is a scam if I have ever seen one. They took 20 year old technology, put some lipstick on it and selling a hope. As an IT and cyber professional with over 20 years in the field I can tell you that Shield is smoke and mirrors vaporware at its best. There are dozens of other companies out there offering way better solution and are not valued at 400M. INTZ revenue tells the full story. Reality just needs to catch up to it."
cant wait to buy a new car
Bravo on your Due Diligence Dennis.
Time to buy
Gap up today
No I won’t. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/independent-product-testing-firm-ten-173000968.html
So I guess my two thumbs down are from you the white diamond employees like cyber dad.
"Besides shield they are working on cloud and all these other applications, this company has got it."
"Seems to me, this is the best time to buy!"
This will be a multi-day runner 
"The Intrusion website has been redesigned - big changes that must have been underway under Blount. I was on the site two days ago, so this change is very recent. It still has Blount in a video, but he's off the list of their leadership team. A new page for partners - lots of them - although what ""partners"" means for Intrusion is not clear. Eight actual clients are listed. https://www.intrusion.com/about-intrusion/"
This company is poised for strong growth. Not sure what earnings will look like and we are on a slight pullback from highs. Buy today and then tomorrow to spread the risk if you are looking to add. Hold long term. Should double again by the end of the year.
"Form 4 filed. Director Anthony Levecchio bought on March 3 5000 shs. @ 20 and 5000 shs. @18,55. Great to see insiders buying on open market."
"Dennis, just to make it clear I have no idea who White Diamond is and never heard of them before they put out the first report on INTZ. I am who I said I am. Technology and Cybersecurity professional working in the field for a very long time. Online posting is not my thing. When I came across Intrusion story I was compelled to comment as I was appalled by their audacity and claims they were making. I broke my own rule and offered my 2c respectfully to whomever was interested to read. We all make our choices…good luck with yours. BTW, did you get to read new report from Kayode Omotosho on Seeking Alpha?"
Thank you fraudulent shorts...gave me a chance to add to my position
"Scroll thru all the lawsuit threads, about seven down. You will see something that a might strike your fancy as a long."
"I like how all the law firms say ""on behalf of the investors..."" while offering anyone stupid enough to sign on with them pennies compared to what they would make. And at this point, I think there are more lawyers after this than investors waiting for them to go away. What will it take - one lawyer for every share of stock?"
Any suggestions for initiating a new position? I love the space and INTZ's technology. Thank you
Great news!This is just the beginning.
"INTZ's presentation at the Needham Conference was impressive. Most impressive in my mind was a comment by President and CEO Jack Blount at the 39:07 mark of the 40 minute broadcast when he said :...we're gonna be in the billions of dollars in Shield sales in a few years."" Management enthusiasm perhaps but he knows better than me what they expect as guidance in the years ahead. That comment must have turned a few analyst heads, don't you think?"

Yet another report of Russian state hacking of government and corporate IT systems has arisen. Can anyone here assess the likelihood that SHIELD would have surfaced the hacks before damage was done? I don't have the background for it. Thanks.

I also notice that you haven't named a single point that's wrong with the report, your not backing up your statements. WDR does. Therefore, you are the one who is the fraud."
dont sell

"I'm all-in so I can't buy more at this point, but GEEZ PEOPLE - read the earnings report. Let me spoon-feed you. Unless Blount is flat-out lying about... well,... EVERYTHING, what you have here is:1) a very early-stage, tiny company's new cyber security product that apparently is a disruptor. 2) it approaches security targets in a different way than anyone else – it tracks odd activity INSIDE the client’s day-to-day workings and targets the things wiggling strangely and kills them.3) because of how it works, it killed the Solar Winds attack based on the activity inside clients’ accounts. That alone tells you it is something different. They didn’t even know it was Solar Winds until they looked at their logs. Up to then it was just another thing they killed.4) the product has been based on a database they developed WHILE SERVING THE GOVERNMENT FOR 20 YEARS.5) They don't have the money (right now) to plaster it all over CNBC – again, they’re tiny. Their CEO has been working inside the government for DECADES.6) Along with Kimberly -Clark, the product is currently being pitched/sold to a number of other large companies as well as a new, additional service TO THEIR GOVERNMENT CLIENT.7) unlike any other cyber security software, Shield can be installed in THREE MINUTES.8) Even though companies sign on to use it, it takes time for these large companies to implement ANYTHING since it has to pass their boards before they can move forward. Then they move forward one location at time – can hardly blame them for that, can you? It’s their friggin’ SECURITY.9) so big things move slow and once they do, the incremental moves to the stock price add up to a much higher price before you decide it’s good enough “now” for your investment capital.Everyone always cries that they WISH they could find a company nobody knows about and make a killing before the crowd finds out. WELL,… THIS IS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE."
