"Jack Blount the CEO and president of this business is the the guy that turned IBM from 50million dollar company into a 2 billion dollar company in just 6 years, if ever there was a company to invest in and feel in safe hands its this mans company. good luck to all when this company hits the big bucks "
Just opened up a position with 1000 shares. No reason this shouldn't be right back where it left off
"INTZ is a scam if I have ever seen one. They took 20 year old technology, put some lipstick on it and selling a hope. As an IT and cyber professional with over 20 years in the field I can tell you that Shield is smoke and mirrors vaporware at its best. There are dozens of other companies out there offering way better solution and are not valued at 400M. INTZ revenue tells the full story. Reality just needs to catch up to it."
"I'm all-in so I can't buy more at this point, but GEEZ PEOPLE - read the earnings report. Let me spoon-feed you. Unless Blount is flat-out lying about... well,... EVERYTHING, what you have here is:1) a very early-stage, tiny company's new cyber security product that apparently is a disruptor. 2) it approaches security targets in a different way than anyone else – it tracks odd activity INSIDE the client’s day-to-day workings and targets the things wiggling strangely and kills them.3) because of how it works, it killed the Solar Winds attack based on the activity inside clients’ accounts. That alone tells you it is something different. They didn’t even know it was Solar Winds until they looked at their logs. Up to then it was just another thing they killed.4) the product has been based on a database they developed WHILE SERVING THE GOVERNMENT FOR 20 YEARS.5) They don't have the money (right now) to plaster it all over CNBC – again, they’re tiny. Their CEO has been working inside the government for DECADES.6) Along with Kimberly -Clark, the product is currently being pitched/sold to a number of other large companies as well as a new, additional service TO THEIR GOVERNMENT CLIENT.7) unlike any other cyber security software, Shield can be installed in THREE MINUTES.8) Even though companies sign on to use it, it takes time for these large companies to implement ANYTHING since it has to pass their boards before they can move forward. Then they move forward one location at time – can hardly blame them for that, can you? It’s their friggin’ SECURITY.9) so big things move slow and once they do, the incremental moves to the stock price add up to a much higher price before you decide it’s good enough “now” for your investment capital.Everyone always cries that they WISH they could find a company nobody knows about and make a killing before the crowd finds out. WELL,… THIS IS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE."
Funny how the shorts want us to do their due diligence for them. So the first White Diamond report quoted cyber dad so he’s obviously lying and is a plant. And Subway if you guys are so legit how come I can’t find any information on where your business is located? A random “info” email as your companies only contact doesn’t scream legitimate whatsoever. But keep trying Wall St. obviously doesn’t believe you with the stocks performance today.
"well OF COURSE this hit piece by some 4th rate short house must be true! Kimberly-Clark are well known to do ZERO due diligence before handing over their site security to a new company. All you gotta do is say ""please""..."
Anyone notice that hit piece yesterday is no where to be found. Drive by shorter. Did anyone sell?
No idea why this stock is dropping. This company is growing very well and by 2022 will have a positive Earnings. No reason this stock is below 20
Kimberly Clark is a huge company. hopefully just the beginning!
We riding this to $10 today or what? 
No I won’t. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/independent-product-testing-firm-ten-173000968.html
"New here with a small grab of shares - trying to get a feel for the potential. Does anyone know if Shield can be used in tandem with other security platforms? In other words, if a firm is using Crowdstrike or ZScaler, is it feasible to also use Shield to get the breaches already in the system? If it CAN work in tandem, this could get really popular really fast - it wouldn't be so much a competitor to those companies as it would be complimentary."
Great news!This is just the beginning.
Big companies are trading this stock. This will be HUGE!!!
Any suggestions for a good entry point?￼
"Company doing all the right things to grow, and seems to have a great product that just proved out in beta testing. Holding for long term..."
The best response to the short hit piece is to announce several more major contracts.
This little known World security company will not survive 2021 without being bought out. They have the largest unique botique entity catalogue of any including Palo or Crowd or Comv

"If this drops more I will definitely buy more.Nobody has made a legitimate bear argument at all in anyway.The 3 yr Kim Clark deal and the massive vendor team they have brought online show that there are a lot more reasons to be bullish than bearish.Any fraud (with a proven track record of fraud) can claim a stock is a scam, but there is no evidence to indicate a scam in anyway."
@coolguydupe Agreed.... this is a home run or a dud...time will tell. They sure have been spending the capital by hiring a lot of people over the past few months from what I can tell. The company must believe they have a winner with Shield... hopefully they do.
Just peeking in doing a little research on what Bard buys. This company just had a terrible earnings and the stock price goes up? Makes no sense. Overpriced.
Every time i bought this stock it drops. I bought 23.3 thinking it is the lowest but ... no
Time to buy?
Any suggestions for initiating a new position? I love the space and INTZ's technology. Thank you
Company needs to respond with a KIMBERLY CLARK type of NEW ACCOUNT and bring in top/bottom line growth along with margin expansion...Intrusion attorney can work on the SHORT REPORT and file suits where appropriate. Boolean
"This is a joke, right. The CEO said the Company is growing and positive earnings by 2022, but the stock is down 52%. This guy has a future in politics."
"Nobody knows about this !!!A True ""Hidden Gem"" !!I'm cautiously super optimistic !"
"Form 4 filed. Director Anthony Levecchio bought on March 3 5000 shs. @ 20 and 5000 shs. @18,55. Great to see insiders buying on open market."
why did this go to 29$?
"Kimberly Clark, 3 yr deal.That is a great sign. They wouldn't do a 3 yr deal if this wasn't good...It is as simple as that."
"Man do we need some news!! CEO, contract….. anything, in at 12 not giving up yet!!!!"
(http://Rightpicker.com) is a must for any trader. Their watchlist which covers pre-market movers is one of the best researched in the industry. I don’t start trading without reading their daily email each morning!
"INTZ's presentation at the Needham Conference was impressive. Most impressive in my mind was a comment by President and CEO Jack Blount at the 39:07 mark of the 40 minute broadcast when he said :...we're gonna be in the billions of dollars in Shield sales in a few years."" Management enthusiasm perhaps but he knows better than me what they expect as guidance in the years ahead. That comment must have turned a few analyst heads, don't you think?"
Does anyone know the reason for today's >20% gain in the first trading hours?
"is anyone else confused as to why INTZ is NOT being mentioned by big media, since Shield supposedly neutralizes EXACTLY what we're being told has happened? I get it - it's a tiny compnay - but GEEZ - you can't tell me the bozos on this message board (I'm including me on that description) are smarter than all the analysts, IT people, the companies that have recently seen Blount and been told about the Shield product... why the HELL isn't MSFT just BUYING this company outright? I'm long INTZ, don't get me wrong - been in since $12 - just seems like this is the PERFECT STORM for some major headlines on Intrusion..."
They need a lot of funds to push their product out. Losing an experienced CEO like Jack is a huge loss and will take time to recover from. This thing will trade low for awhile until they can show sales are picking up.
Awesome news! This is just the beginning - they just gained awesome credibility in the market. This could be up to $8M in recurring revs from this customer alone.
"Very interesting times for Intrusion. Impressed by the investor call, Jack has always been a positive speaker and obviously believes in the future potential of Shield. The value in this product is unlimited and the investment in a strong Executive team is another positive step towards future shareholder value.Happy to hold throughout 2021, interested to see how the beta testing goes with the Fortune 100 & 500 companies Jack mentions in the call. As mentioned by a number of previous posters, this company is a relative unknown for most. This may change soon - good luck to all investors."
"Excellent investor call yesterday. All INTZ needs is for one of these government entities or a Fortune 100 company to buy Shield, prove its not ""to good to be true"", and INTZ could be back over $100 by the end of the year."
