Arent we all in tears for the West’s ?These grifters have been shopping cheating trainers for years with goose eggs for results.And now West’s want to sue ?He ought to be ashamed of himself. Another rogue owner who received his just due.
"Santa Anita has approved a shrine to honor and immortalize Bob Baffert. It is expected to be completed by July 15, 2022"
"Let's get a TC racehorse every year. Why not ?Help resuscitate this dead game or will it ?Have either Pletcher or Baffert win the K Y Derby.Preakness remains a joke as too many K Y entrants defect.If the TC is on the line, conflicts exist between dual ownership ,minority owners paid for not entering, jockeys stiffing their mounts, horses used for blocking purposes, etc, yup, that's the ticket.Bob bafferts old motto "" do whatever it takes !"" Sad the racing oligarchs have adopted this druggies advice."
"Who’s in charge of the enhanced drug testing at CD during Breeders Cup week ?What time do they report for work ? 6 pm est ?Shameful racing yet again.Why I don’t bet CD and watch with one eye opened ?Jaywalk, case in point,"
Correction: hotel only tripled its room rate for days of Breeders Cup. Hope there is a very good reason.
Market's up and this one is down for no apparent reason other than Profit booking maybe?
CHDN rescinds 3 for 1 split ??Enjoy the ride back to reality.
Churchill Downs reached an all time high at 177.06
"BOAF criticizes horse racing savior for spending 32 million on Chinese crafted Pegasus statue while the iconic demonic CDI contracts their tasteless pig vomit mint julep glasses to some Mitch McConnell endorsed slave labor manufacturer who had Tiznow winning twice,Say it ain't so."
Anyone at CDI notice how well TSG has done with ye olde Cakder Race course ?? bOAF ?
"Blind squirrel theory confirmed by Bernie's posts below. He is correct in asserting that the stewards did get it the Derby ruling correct, even if they had to be prodded by jockeys' objections instead of making the call themselves. Safety/integrity have to be paramount to the sport, especially in light of what's going on at Santa Anita and the damper that is putting on the sport."
"Admit that my expectation of the BC relocation was in error. Whether it be at Santa Anita or Churchill, the most important thing is the health of the horses. I often visit various tracks and will be at Saratoga in the coming days. That meeting is probably the best in the entire U.S. and includes the best horses, trainers, and jockeys. It will be a very entertaining watch on FS2 starting on Thursday, July 11. In the meanwhile, I hope many CHDN shareholders have read about the incredible success Derby City Gaming is having for the company. The growing importance of gaming within Churchill only adds to its almost certain future success. By the way, I do not remember which poster targeted the stock to be $120 come earnings time, but congratulations on a very good call."
"Earnings estimates range from the $2.70's with Zack to $2.97 at earnings whispers. Was at $3.03 at the latter, but has been reduced in recent weeks. The TD Ameritrade site shows an estimate of $2.81, which is down from $2.90 only a week ago. The only earnings beat that can move the stock higher will have to show a $3 handle. If not, the stock will probably succumb to some profit taking of consequence. I am a long term holder; thus, I will ride the wave either higher or lower. Let's hope for the former."
CHDN is up 4.90% to 250.35
The face of horse racing.Bob Baffert.Another joke.
"CD should be BANNED from hosting any racing venue . Period, not even 2k claumers."
"A golden opportunity, with the FG under quarantine, handle off 40% from last year, why not get the demolition crew from Calder and work a two fer, similar to the coupons stuffed and boaf use when dining at long john silvers, and put the FG and Louisiana horsemen out of their misery ?"
"Bought at 40 years ago-200 shares-$8,000. now own 650 shares-valued at $74,000."
"wow. have you noticed the ""huge"" trifecta payouts at CD since they increased their takeout? $8.40, $14.60, $11.20, and many more.with their increase in their takeout, and the continued dime on the dollar breakage, you've got to be out of your mind to bet exotics at CD.CD: ""where greed tops heritage""."
Caton Bredar shouldn't be disappointed.She's missing nothing.Same old same old.
CHDN reached a new All Time High at 254.00
Companies like CHDN should be utilizing the cutting edge security devices from AiTX. Besides the added security and convenience it will reduce expenses significantly.
"Nice post-split rally. Heading into earnings call late Feb/early Mar, then the Kentucky Derby. I think all of this will help sustain a rally to break solidly above the resistance trendline on the one year chart."

"Split adjusted float is only 33.02m, with over 86% of shares held by insiders and institutions. The company is in a buyback mode right now, with only approx. 4.4m shares out there to buy back. Do the math, this is going up now through May (post Kentucky Derby), at least."
Has Baffert ever won a grade 1 race with any horse that wasn’t junked ? The face of racing is and always has been a grade 1 cheat.
Lots of spam artists on here.Be careful.This stock is not for the faint hearted.
"It’s really crushing watching CD employees and fans be humiliated and targeted by BLM..Who would ever-dream Louisville would become a nightmare.Especially with greaseball Pitino gone.Hang in there buds.Uhhh, putting a BLM decal on the back of your Beamer don’t help.Keep your chins up,"
"CD stuck with plenty of unsold tickets.Hotels are vacant throughout Louisville.Assume the "" gouging "" undertook by team Johns has had its unintended consequence., empty seats, vacant hotels, no shows, etc.275 $ a share.Please."
Bernie's BIG weekend !
"Oxford Casino in Maine sucks $101.7M out of the locals but Governor Janet Mills thinks sports betting would be too harmful to Maine residents? That's total ""BS""!!! She's just scared a few good sports bettors would wipe out her revenue sweep from the casino."
"Running a K Y derby in September ?Too funny.How’s Baffert going to keep his 3 year olds on the frog juice .Just run a virtual K Y derby, give bob the trophy, and wait till next year.Just say Buh bye to past enthusiasm and ticket prices, for sure ."
CHDN is the 4th largest holding in IWO - The Russell 2000 Growth ETF!

"Jay borenstein, you will be singing a different tune might quick. Nice spam."
It’s so nice of CHDN to buy 1 million shares from Duchossis. Such a joke.
Maybe Bernard will buy the stock
Obvious CD was more concerned with the outside climate than keeping an eye on Bob Baffert.Add “ Authentic “ to the long list of doped up equines under Baffert tutelage.Absolutely amazing this cheat still has a trainers license .

"The very new ETF with the symbol BETZ has CHDN as a core holding. That's what I expected. The interesting fact is that the ""Thematic Relevance"" for CHDN being included is not horse racing or casinos, but ""Sports Book."" That's the reason that I bought CHDN several months ago."

"This archaic Kentucky Derby point system has made the triple crown series "" BORING ! ""It will guarantee 7 horses each year from baffert and pletcher. 8 other entrants that have no chance.

Good I dropped VERIZON for my govt issued OBAMAphone. What a great country !
Looks like RAIN RAIN and more RAIN for the K Y derby.Are any tornadoes expected ?
Another weekend of boring listless coverage by NBC. Another boring Kentucky Derby. Attendance DOWN. Handle DOWN. Flash ratings DOWN 9%.
"Rick, got to teach your kids how to shoot a free throw"
"the model for corporate greed in a dying industry. maximum legal takeout, with taxes and high breakage (twice what nyra tracks are), an industry built on cheating jockeys, trainers that are crooks and druggers; no national governing agency; tracks that look the other way. the players don't have a prayer. used to be fun."
Getting the earnings ready for reporting
"Stock under accumulation between $120 and $125 before next move higher. Continued growth in sports book looks very impressive, coupled with new northern Kentucky track and gaming venue. Excellent growth stock in very high quality portfolios. Actually expect major Vegas/Macau company -- i.e. MGM, Wynn, or Sands -- to take a run at Churchill eventually. It may have already occurred, though I doubt it could have remained quiet in today's market environment. Whether management would even agree to talks is an interesting question; however, the age of largest Churchill shareholder (97) must be taken into consideration. The way management is going about its daily business of grow at a rapid pace is an interesting way to keep suitors away in the near term."

"Most every trainer at one time another served under a leading trainer. Pletcher Lukas , Motion Shepard, Chad Brown Frankel, etc.Who helps Bob with his greatness ?I'm stumped once again."
"You know your racetrack is ready to close when the feature on a Memorial Weekend racing day is a ' Maiden Special Weight.,'Buy bye, Arlington Park.RIP."
"Management is going to take advantage of the current low interest rate environment with the construction of the new project in northern Kentucky. This will be in direct competition with New York's growing thoroughbred industry. With far better and more temperate weather, one would expect much of New York's winter season to gravitate back home to Kentucky. Coupled with a new gaming venue, the bottom line of Churchill has nowhere to go but up and up. Without any doubt, this company is destined to become a major national force in the gaming industry."
"One day, my dream, is to turn on NBCSN and see the Breeders Cup at CD mired in yellow police tape as ICE agents politely perp walk the Bafferts, Sadler, Millers , et al, out of their box seats at CD into a small paddy wagon with a couple of #$%$ brothers in it"
"i realize the market is down, and the fact that chdn has just run up nice. but shouldn't this be up today with the derby just running and the huge money they HAD to make over it??"
"Some of BOAFs most notable quotes1. "" chdn is a sell. I'm out ( 28$ )2. Calder race course is one of CDIs prized assets.3. "" TVG will be out of business in five years ( 2008 )4. Arlington Park is "" not "" a white elephant.5. "" Harlows bathrooms are adequately equipped with toilet paper ""6. "" trump could never win """
"When Arlington Park sells, CHDN will pick up between $250mm and $500mm in cash. The track is comprised of approx 250 acres valued at $1mm to $2mm/acre. Cash flow is modest in an evolving industry that has long moved to e wagering. It is very infrequent that a company has an opportunity to garner this type of cash without issuing new equity or selling a cash producing operation. A sale, which will happen, will change the risk profile dramatically at a time the market has embraced internet sports wagering and CHDN is a leader."
"It's coming! The Illinois House on Saturday approved a comprehensive expansion of gaming in the state. This means 1200 gaming positions at Arlington Park (+ sports betting), expanding up to a total of 2000 positions at Rivers, and sports betting for all casinos. This finally happened because the state needs the tax revenue too much. Our politicians aren't very good with other peoples money."
FS moving Preakness to Laurel.Florida Derby becomes the first leg of the Stronach 3.10 million dollar purses with cumulative point totals for bonus.Sad to see the KY Derby meet its peril.
"The few devestors that are short this stock are being decimated, and it will continue for many more months. After a one year consolidation, which was completed in May, the stock is on a clearly delineated breakout, and it counts into the $170's eventually. With such a narrow float, and with the company buying back stock, the only thing that could stop this juggernaut is a bear market, which I do not envision for a number of years. I thoroughly enjoy seeing ill advised shorts getting crushed. The few times I went short, I got hurt pretty badly. All I can say is ""never again."""
"Other than an earnings miss, what’s driving this down the past 5 days"
Has McPeek peaked ?
"the hana race track ratings are tempered by a lot of superfluous information designed as a smoke screen to hide the screw job the public is getting in takeout percentages and breakage. if they wanted to be objective, they would adjust the takeout percentages based on breakage rates. nyra tracks still break a nickel on the dollar; ky tracks twice that."
Hope the FBI make their presence known at this years K Y Derby drugfest !Guaranteed you won’t see Bob Baffert or Doug ONeill anywhere near the winners circle.

"According to Earnings Whispers and Benzinga, Churchill beat both on the top and bottom lines once again. Dow Jones reflects the bottom line without the adjustments necessary to arrive at the correct earnings per share number of $2.83. Wish we could have seen $3.00, but the startup costs of various venues took a small bite, even though they are capitalized."

"The latest fatal injury to a thoroughbred at Santa Anita raises speculation about the future of the Breeders’ Cup.Twenty-seven horses have died at Santa Anita in less than six months.Churchill Downs said it is ready to host again if racing at Santa Anita is deemed too risky.“If they had an accident at Santa Anita, my God, the publicity would be off the charts,” WAVE 3 News contributor Billy Reed said. “There’s a movement in California right now to ban thoroughbred racing.”By comparison, there were 36 deaths on all Kentucky tracks in all of 2018. That was at a rate higher than the national average. There were 24 deaths in 2018 at Churchill Downs.""The Breeders' Cup team knows we're available to step up and host if we're ever needed,"" Churchill spokesman Darren Rogers said.For the city of Louisville, the return of the Breeders' Cup for the second straight year would be an economic gift.Breeders’ Cup visitors spent $50 million when Churchill Downs hosted last year."
"Horsemen and racetracks continue to get the shaft from Las Vegas based casino race books. LV race books are REFUSING pari mutuel STRAIGHT wagers.

"Over the last three trading days, CHDN is up 16% and DKNG is down."
they dont make too many mistakes 1 more meet at the formerly great arlington park and the sale of very valuable property after covid and real estate like this will demand top dollar
"With Susquehanna's price target of $140 as of this a.m., it is only a matter of days (or weeks) before Telsey, Jefferies, and JP Morgan raise their price targets as well. Maybe they will just wait until earnings next week, but they would be better advised to adjust their outlooks prior to the 31st. That way they can look like heroes for their followers. Just my take."
"Continuing tragic problems at Santa Anita should almost certainly result in the relocation of the Breeders Cup to Churchill. This is also another reason for the continuing stock strength. If one reviews the stock chart, he (she) would see that the past over 12 months has been one of consolidation of prior years' gaiins. This decisive breakout could reach a number few of us can even imagine. As mentioned a few days ago and before the recent stock strength, a possible takeover is certainly a very strong possibility. However, it is going to take a very high offer to secure stockholder approval. The longer prospective suitors wait, the higher the price. Personally, I would rather continue to ride the independent wave."
"Kentucky moving towards sports gambling In November, Senator Julian Carroll unveiled a revised version of the sports betting bill originally filed in 2017. The bill would include gambling on both college and professional sports and would also include a heavy tax rate of 3% of the handle along with a $250,000 initial licensing fee.In January, two more bills were introduced to continue the push for sports gambling in Kentucky. These bills would allow sports betting as well as daily fantasy sports and online poker.While there are other focuses in Kentucky, sports betting still seems to be a high priority with a bright future in sight."
"Wheeling, West Virginia2006How embarrassing !"

"CNBC this a.m. by owner of 76'ers and New Jersey Devils: as far as new industries tied to sports, the advent and expansion of sports gaming will result in profits in the tens of billions of dollars over the coming decade. Quite obviously, Churchill is positioning itself to be a major participant in this evolving profit center. Recent expansions, including their application in Waukegon and last evening's announcement for northern Kentucky is probably only the tip of the iceberg. This forward looking management team is going to put Churchill in the merger sites of the most major of players in the gaming industry. This stock, with only 40 million shares outstanding, will fast become a must in institutional growth portfolios."
Is the bernie below the same guy who has a $7 price target on a stock that's trading around $150?That guy was a real idiot.

"11/26 FRANKFORT, Ky. — Attorney General Andy Beshear sent a letter to state lawmakers asking them to legalize casinos and sports betting as the way raise money to save Kentucky's ailing public pension system.""The solution is not to cut legally promised benefits ..."" Beshear said in a two-page letter to legislators on Monday. ""The answer is simple – expanded gaming including casino, fantasy sports, and sports gaming, as well as preparing for the eventual legalization of online poker.""Churchill Downs Incorporated operates as a racing, gaming, and online entertainment company in the United States.

"Kentucky one step closer to legalized sports gamblingKentucky continues to inch forward with its plans to introduce sports gambling. A House committee in the state unanimously approved a bill this week that could conceivably open the doors to the activity, but there is still a long road ahead before it finally is given the green light.Kentucky took the first step to legalizing sports betting on Wednesday as a legislative committee strongly endorsed a bill that one estimate says would bring in at least $20 million a year in new taxes.Kentucky seems to be in a race with its neighbors to make sports betting legal following a U.S. Supreme Court decision last year that struck down a federal law that had banned the industry in much of the country. West Virginia has already legalized sports betting, and state officials in Tennessee, Ohio and Illinois are considering it.If they are going to do it, Kentucky lawmakers have an economic incentive to do it quickly. An analysis by the firm Commonwealth Economics found the state could generate as much as $48 million a year in taxes if Kentucky legalizes sports betting while most of its neighbors do not. But if all the other states have sports betting, Kentucky’s revenue projections drop to $20 million a year.The proposal approved Wednesday by the Kentucky House Licensing, Occupations and Administrative Regulations Committee would spend some of that new money on regulating the new industry and setting up a program to help people with gambling addiction problems. But most of the money would be go to the state’s public pension systems, which are estimated to be at least $39 billion short of the money needed to pay benefits over the next three decades.Wednesday, the Republican-dominated committee approved the bill without a single “no” vote, while Democratic Rep. Dennis Keene voted “pass.” But the bill will need significant support to make it out of the state legislature before it adjourns for the year on March 29. Last year, state lawmakers approved a two-year spending plan that does not expire until June 30, 2020. Because the new bill would raise and spend money, it would require at least 60 votes from the 100-seat House of Representatives to pass."

sports gambling has entirely transformed the racetracks in NJ. The Meadowlands in North NJ maybe 20 min from NYC is jammed now and it was a ghost town. sports gambling is coming to KY and not only with tracks be jammed more people but so will the casinos like Derby City Gaming will have a sports book. this is a new revenue stream and it will take this stock into the 120's to the towards the 150's bye the end of 2019
The stewards decision was correct. I’m surprised it took so long.Saez May have been on more controlled substances than his horse.Turning for home he clearly shut off Shugs horse on the rail. Then pinballs out and almost forced War of Wills down to the ground. And if Wills went down figure another 5 to 8 horses crossing the finish line without their jockeys and a couple of horses euthanized.CDI needs to ban Saez for life.As for Servis it’s about time. You’re a disgrace.

"The stock move in CHDN is def perplexing when you figure that this mgmt team has done some transactions that have greatly negatively affected shareholders. Sold this Big fish for a song back in 2017. Was hugely acquisitive in 2018 and 2019 at the wrong time. Company is now straddled with $2 billion of debt plus its share of Midwest gaming debt of several hundred million. CHDN’s investment in Midwest is currently valued at $800 million more than the underlying assets which suggests maybe its overstated and needs to be impaired? But no need to worry because CHDN continues to grant itself huge amounts of stock which get adjusted for performance targets! Awesome! Stock awards of over 500,000 shares are currently floating around out there. Management continues to be very good to itself."

The old owner of Arlington Park continues to buy this stock on the open market. Is he right or wrong about this.
Up over 8 points today to 140! Still no one here?
earnings are tomorrow . if we get some good numbers and guidance i could see this go over 100
"Less than one hundred thousand shares in a very strong up market environment. Thus, no sign yet of short covering. Since well over two million shares are short, batten down the hatches for a major up day in the not too distant future. This baby can fluctuate with the best of them, and I expect to see an over $130 print fairly soon. It will not be like the unfettered spike last time, which really was a market order that was eaten alive. Do not know how long it will take for the review of their recent casino license in Waukegon to be completed and determined. That will give it further impetus. Earnings not due for nearly two more months. Company buyback of shares helps give it a floor during market downswings in this era of a trade war. If the news can stay positive for more than a couple of days, maybe it can get going on the upside. Also, an eventual sale of the poorly performing Arlington Park would be helpful as well.

i have been saying when sports gambling passes this stock would rise. and here we go. now i was talking about KY but thats still on the back burner its Illinois that just went through and CHDN owns the big race track in Arlington Ill. that and all of their otb in that state is moving this up . new revenue stream and i think this goes up another 10 percent before next earnings.

Long on CHDN good mgt. I never posted a stock before until this one BRGGF. (b2b software for gambling companies) ONLY 30 MILLION market cap . price to sales about .75 revenue growth 50 pct and they just signed Kambi and rumor has it churchill downs is working with kambi now also. They also signed sbtech and countless others in last year. Every time i research them i find their valuation too good to be true. Earnings are tomorrow morning so i would get in today as its only . I find downside limited but upside who knows 10x 20x 5x 50xTake look at BRGGF its market cap is only 35 million .Its P/S is only .75 revenue growth 50 % and its b2b software and just signed deals with sbtech and kambi and numerous others. Looks like chdn getting rid of sbtech to go with GAN and KAMBI announcement coming soon although CEO of Gan hinted at it already.

"the last time i was at Churchill downs two years ago, i noticed i was not getting my twin spires points. when i asked the teller, she advised that you no longer get points when you bet at the track. but you still got points when you bet on line. i wondered what kind of marketing program would incentive you to stay home and bet, rather than coming to the track! i did some research and soon found out why: the horsemen get a reduced share when you bet on line vs a bet placed at the track!"

"Since CHDS increased their takeout to the maximum legal limit on all bets, and they continue to break a dime on each dollar, it's IMPOSSIBLE to make any money at CD anymore. I haven't been out there in two years, and used to hardly miss a day after work. When CD went corporate, greed took over."

the least popular governor in the united states by a poll recently is the Kentucky gov republican Matt Bevin and he is running for reelection. There is no way he can win against Kentucky Attorney General Andy Beshear. Beshear is all for legalizing sports gambling to shore up the pension debt the state has. CHDN just bought Turfway park 10 miles south of Cincinnati. sports gambling will be in KY So soon with the New Gov Beshear who definately wins. Bevins has always been against sports gambling and made up stories and lies of how gambling leads to suicides every day of the year. look it up. with sports gambling next year all over kentucky this is a 160.00 stock. not only will there be new revenue from all over the state we now get Ohio revenue too. and keep the folks from gong to Indiana.

"As has been reported, the next meeting of the directors of the Breeders Cup is during the last week of June. Other than the tragedies that continue at Santa Anita, the major topic of conversation should be whether the racing industry's world series event should be one focused on the multiple horse deaths at Santa Anita. The California governor and senior senator are both onboard for further investigation and even a closure of the track until the cause has been determined. Obviously, the racing surface may need to be fully replaced, since the existing surface is not safe after the major storms that California has endured this past winter and early spring. The majority of the directors hail from Kentucky farms -- i think it is nine out of fifteen. While they should not reflect a Kentucky bias, there is little doubt that the Breeders Cup races should be relocated this year."

Churchill Downs looks to close on Midwest Gaming dealthe Illinois Gaming Board is due to vote on the tentative agreement between Churchill Downs (CHDN +0.8%) and Midwest Gaming at a meeting on March 1.Churchill Downs hopes to acquire a majority stake in Midwest Gaming.The deal is expected to close in the first half of this year if approved by the regulator.
"Speaking of the K Y Derby, it looks all West Coast to me. CD can't stop baffert. Too afraid I reckon."
What is the reason for buying back the stock/
"Wondering out loud whether the new gaming license just applied for will preclude Churchill from expanding the number of gaming positions at Arlington. Do not know if the expansion requires a new license or just a revision to the existing one. This is an important question since only six new licenses are allowed under the new Illinois gaming bill, as approved by the legislature and signed by the governor. If Arlington cannot be expanded by Churchill under its existing license, there may be a good chance of Arlington's sale, as has been discussed in some press reports."
"Wear your hat proudly, Gov. Steve Beshear and BOAF."
Hocus pocus.Ouch.
Is CHDN restating their earnings ?
Stay home if you don't like to be robbed by a cheating casino. PERIOD!
whats the deal with Churchill holding back the signal to Nevada ? budging ? not ? Fairgrounds will be a nada also ?
"The largest shareholder, as a result of the purchase of Arlington in Illinois, is now 97 years old. No matter how he has structured his holdings, whether by trust or whatever, the eventual tax bill is going to be a windfall for Liz Warren, God forbid, or whoever is running the show at the time of his passing. The next positive announcement should be the gaming in Arlington, which must be determined by the end of August. Then it will be two months of no news as Churchill awaits its next earning report. I have to believe that an eventual sale of Churchill is in the cards, no pun intended. Continued patience will be the best course, again no pun intended."

LVS or MGM swoops in and buys them out, 180 a share?? or even better they start to do some buying now as they are growing. buy the NJ Meadowlands and take northern NJ and their sports book or some other state that has legalized it. now is the time. all this sports gambling is in its infancy."

"Very disappointed that Baffert's reputation has now been greatly tarnished. Since the 1960's, when I used to frequent Golden Gate Fields and Bay Meadows in the San Francisco Bay Area, one would have hoped that the industry had finally been cleaned up. In those days, I befriended a few of the ""straw hat and cigar smoking"" handicappers to learn of the day's drugged horses. The daily double had become an important source of funds to continue my college education at Berkeley. It worked out quite well on many an occasion. But here we are 50 years later, and the same nonsense continues in California, at least. Of course, it is most probable that it continues behind the scenes nationwide. It will now become 100 percent necessary to test the blood samples of the major stakes winners across the country. Since it is like the Olympics for horses, we should expect nothing less. Purses will have to be impounded until everything is proven to be on the up and up. The first failures will make the headlines I am certain. The Baffert story has not received the play that it deserves, but as the Breeders Cup approaches, I hope the story becomes front and center."

"Over 10% of the outstanding shares of Churchill Downs were ADDED to hedge funds and institutional investors in the first quarter of 2019. This was reported yesterday (the 25th of July). One can easily see that this new 4.22 million shares in positions is quite simply shares removed from the public float. This further explains the increasing volatility of the price in recen weeks. If the earnings are as positive as I hope (and anticipate), she should move up quite nicely in coming days. Of course, this is dependent upon a reasonably stable overall market environment. I have to believe that Susquehanna's first Churchill coverage so close to an earnings release had some positive background ""feelings"" to have published it yesterday."

"Pullback is excellent opportunity to add to positions. Louisville newspaper reports yesterday that a downtown hotel has almost sextupled its room price for days of Breeders Cup races. Whether they have been clued in with some inside information, we will see on Thursday. That is the final day that would allow races to be relocated to Churchill Downs. The meeting is this Thursday in Lexington. Let's hope the directors have the common sense to relocate the races to defuse the potentially explosive reporting that could occur from Santa Anita. That would be a strong negative for the entire industry."

"Jerry Bailey May have upped my dear friend , BOAF, as the thoroughbred dummy.When asked why bob Baffert can keep producing all these GR 1 winners he replied , “ nothing unusual. Baffert has a keen eye for picking young ones. “Jerry, try dipping your hair plugs in Freon and repeat that procedure till it yields the right results."

"Oxford crowd and profits are good. New Hotel and more slots coming there. Smalll part of the company , but a very profitable casino."
"With the semi-controlling family being up there in years, and with Mario Gabelli's dual pronged interest, this could shape up as a perfect takeover target. Stock has acted extremely well in terrible market environment, especially today. Not enough of a short interest to result in a squeeze. Definitely under accumulation almost every day. Substantial upside move definitely in the cards."

Running the Kentucky Derby in September is like holding Christmas in March.
61 to 140 in ten weeks! Bwahahaha! Maybe next time you will listen.
"Anyone interested in buying this stock, watch the order depth and/or options prices to get a read on short term stock price direction. I've noticed that the options prices move up or down a good 5-10 minutes before the stock price moves in that same direction. CHDN isn't the most liquid stock in the world. If you watch how buy/sell orders are stacking up in Level II, or alternatively, just watch option prices near the current strike price, you could get a little advance warning about the direction of the stock price (short term). FYI. Most options prices follow the stock price, but I've found CHDN to be opposite."

Likely to drift further down until mid April. I'll wait a few weeks to add.
Phony stock.Accounting irregularities bigly.
"I tried once before here to post about CHDN, but it was deleted. I believe that CHDN is the undervalued way to play sports betting, much better than the over-hyped and over valued Draft Kings. Do some homework on what CHDN is doing in that area. CHDN had run up large before everything was shut down. It is doing the same again now."

"Highly doubt with all this BLM extortion, Breona Taylor distorted facts, prospects for more division with Obama’s handpicked president COMMIEla Harris, a run for the roses may be a thing of the past.It’s not like CD is situated in a safe area.Hope you can keep the slots tight and the crime down."
Watch this thing tank Monday morning. They flushed like 30% of their value with the DQ catastrophe. Derby makes money but if it doesn’t lead to more butts in seats the rest of the year CHDN loses money. That debacle is not bringing more people to the track.
"Reckon there won’t be a record setting KY Derby this year, got to think there won’t be any K Y derby this year, have to tighten them slots up in Oxford , that’s the ticket, m."

TSG better have some glue handy if and when Arrogate ever has enough junk in him to show up in a race. Watch his last workout and it looks like Arrogate hind legs are ready to snap. Assume Baffert scratches out of the Pegasus the week of.
