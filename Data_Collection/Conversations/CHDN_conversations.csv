Will Betonallfours post his Derby picks pre race ?Let's wait and see
"Offcourse the moment that I sell it, after holding it for months it goes up by 32 points. I missed out on 38,000 dollars. God I have the worst luck ever."
"chdn should look to expand. they can buy tracks that are in states with sports gambling now or ones that are about too.this is the ONLY stock in the gambling sector at a 52 week high, and it keeps going up. . would mgm or lvs be interested in buying chdn? not that i want that to happen but they too have to look to expand. buying a winner does that."
It’s simply too funny. CD has been catering to these West Coast chemists posing as trainers and now what I’ve been saying for years has come true.Way to go CD. Hope your slots work out for ya !!
Electing Obama had its consequences. And this mayhem is only in the first inning . Race hustlers are back in business and corporate America gave BLM billions . Hope CDI is putting tons of extra security in each of their casinos . Y’all will need em
CHDN reached a new All Time High at 247.05
"Bought at 40 years ago-200 shares-$8,000. now own 650 shares-valued at $74,000."
"Split adjusted float is only 33.02m, with over 86% of shares held by insiders and institutions. The company is in a buyback mode right now, with only approx. 4.4m shares out there to buy back. Do the math, this is going up now through May (post Kentucky Derby), at least."

"The few devestors that are short this stock are being decimated, and it will continue for many more months. After a one year consolidation, which was completed in May, the stock is on a clearly delineated breakout, and it counts into the $170's eventually. With such a narrow float, and with the company buying back stock, the only thing that could stop this juggernaut is a bear market, which I do not envision for a number of years. I thoroughly enjoy seeing ill advised shorts getting crushed. The few times I went short, I got hurt pretty badly. All I can say is ""never again."""
Getting the earnings ready for reporting

"Stock under accumulation between $120 and $125 before next move higher. Continued growth in sports book looks very impressive, coupled with new northern Kentucky track and gaming venue. Excellent growth stock in very high quality portfolios. Actually expect major Vegas/Macau company -- i.e. MGM, Wynn, or Sands -- to take a run at Churchill eventually. It may have already occurred, though I doubt it could have remained quiet in today's market environment. Whether management would even agree to talks is an interesting question; however, the age of largest Churchill shareholder (97) must be taken into consideration. The way management is going about its daily business of grow at a rapid pace is an interesting way to keep suitors away in the near term."
"Stock does not seem to care that the Breeders Cup is staying in southern California. Board decided that a unanimous evidence of support for Santa Anita was more important than the potential safety of the horses. Let's all hope that nothing catastrophic occurs during the event. In actuality, maybe it is best that Churchill avoid the publicity of horse deaths during the event this year. It is certain to be a major topic of concern -- rightfully so!"
"CD should be BANNED from hosting any racing venue . Period, not even 2k claumers."
How CHDN comes up with their earnings
"This archaic Kentucky Derby point system has made the triple crown series "" BORING ! ""It will guarantee 7 horses each year from baffert and pletcher. 8 other entrants that have no chance. CDI overlooks the drugging by the big stars. Preakness has always been a full race riddled with defections. The Belmont is the ultimate BORE. Imagine Baffert had to enter restoring hope to make sure justify wasn't bothered by Ortiz for Smiths dirty tactics against Good Magic.Back to sleep, everyone. 247 days u till the pegasus World Cup challenge"
Maybe Bernard will buy the stock
Looks like RAIN RAIN and more RAIN for the K Y derby.Are any tornadoes expected ?
"Kentucky one step closer to legalized sports gamblingKentucky continues to inch forward with its plans to introduce sports gambling. A House committee in the state unanimously approved a bill this week that could conceivably open the doors to the activity, but there is still a long road ahead before it finally is given the green light.Kentucky took the first step to legalizing sports betting on Wednesday as a legislative committee strongly endorsed a bill that one estimate says would bring in at least $20 million a year in new taxes.Kentucky seems to be in a race with its neighbors to make sports betting legal following a U.S. Supreme Court decision last year that struck down a federal law that had banned the industry in much of the country. West Virginia has already legalized sports betting, and state officials in Tennessee, Ohio and Illinois are considering it.If they are going to do it, Kentucky lawmakers have an economic incentive to do it quickly. An analysis by the firm Commonwealth Economics found the state could generate as much as $48 million a year in taxes if Kentucky legalizes sports betting while most of its neighbors do not. But if all the other states have sports betting, Kentucky’s revenue projections drop to $20 million a year.The proposal approved Wednesday by the Kentucky House Licensing, Occupations and Administrative Regulations Committee would spend some of that new money on regulating the new industry and setting up a program to help people with gambling addiction problems. But most of the money would be go to the state’s public pension systems, which are estimated to be at least $39 billion short of the money needed to pay benefits over the next three decades.Wednesday, the Republican-dominated committee approved the bill without a single “no” vote, while Democratic Rep. Dennis Keene voted “pass.” But the bill will need significant support to make it out of the state legislature before it adjourns for the year on March 29. Last year, state lawmakers approved a two-year spending plan that does not expire until June 30, 2020. Because the new bill would raise and spend money, it would require at least 60 votes from the 100-seat House of Representatives to pass."
"Fidelity has reported that they hold over 4 million shares of CHDN, up from just over 3 million shares two quarters ago. They have doubled the size of their holding over the past three years."

"The last straw for me was when they quit giving twin spires points on bets placed on-site, while still giving points on bets placed on-line. I couldn't understand the logic. Did they not want me there buying $5 cans of beer? The real answer is the horsemen get a smaller cut from on-line bets.PS, The track with the fairest takeout in North America is Woodlawn. Makes a big difference in your potential winnings."
I saw Larry Birkhead and Dannielynne made it to the red carpet yet again.Bravo.

This stock is a CAN'T LOSE!
Watch this thing tank Monday morning. They flushed like 30% of their value with the DQ catastrophe. Derby makes money but if it doesn’t lead to more butts in seats the rest of the year CHDN loses money. That debacle is not bringing more people to the track.
"this is just running up crazy over 160. i was way off here. I thought news from KY and legalized sports gambling would drive this up but thats not whats doing it. its from all the other states that they already have a presence in like ohio, illinios and indiana and others. KY will eventually pass this bill with the new Governors blessing. so i guess when that news finally happens this is new 185 to 190."
"BOAF, any scuttlebutt roaming around Louisville about KFC using transgenders to portray the iconic Colonel ? Probably more interest in who will be highlighting the next KFC commercial than which horse will win the K Y Derby this year."

I’ve been on this board for 15 years and I have to honestly state if there was an award for bottom feeders Matt would win hands down. Sure sounds Matt is mentally challenged.What a whack job.

"300 before 3, bernie. Please tell me some other stocks you suggest shorting, like you touted way back when as CHDN traded in the 30s. I don't watch enough CNBC to see if there's anyone else in the world this bad at picking stocks."

whats the deal with Churchill holding back the signal to Nevada ? budging ? not ? Fairgrounds will be a nada also ?
Expect to see some really fancy cooking going in Chdn s accounting office
Opening day tomorrow down in the bayou. Excited ?
Betonallfours sister.
nice to know that cdi is focusing on expanding pseudo slot machines while horse racing is dying on the vine.
"Let's get a TC racehorse every year. Why not ?Help resuscitate this dead game or will it ?Have either Pletcher or Baffert win the K Y Derby.Preakness remains a joke as too many K Y entrants defect.If the TC is on the line, conflicts exist between dual ownership ,minority owners paid for not entering, jockeys stiffing their mounts, horses used for blocking purposes, etc, yup, that's the ticket.Bob bafferts old motto "" do whatever it takes !"" Sad the racing oligarchs have adopted this druggies advice."
"Horsemen and racetracks continue to get the shaft from Las Vegas based casino race books. LV race books are REFUSING pari mutuel STRAIGHT wagers. When will CDI and TSG quit exporting their signal to these buffoons ????The war on straight wagers has begun. MGM, Stations, BYD, and now Caesars, roughly 86% of all parimutuel wagers, REFUSE to take place and show wagers on horse racing, MGM currently limits straight wagers at 500$ TOTAL, BYD will not take ANY show wager, STATIONS, aka Red Rock gaming, run by celebrated Las Vegas FBI informant Art Manteris, limits show wagers at 100$, Caesars is a tad more adventurous offering 200$ on short fields ( six or less ),Tens of thousands dollars per day are not finding their way into the parimutuel pools because these sickening racetbook managers simaltaneousky agreed to screw the straight horse players and indirectly SCREW the horsemen who bring us"
"What a great stock to own! Hope that there is still a 5% short position. It will only add fuel to the fire over time. Next stop will be the addition of gaming tables to Arlington. Needs to be determined by the end of August. Have yet to see anything as of yet. This should add additional pop to the stock, even though the gaming will not be available for at least a year."
"I sold my 122 cost shares at 193 this morning. I'm not really a trader, but this early move was over the top. I'll be back if we get a chance at a reasonable settled price."
From twitter:Pete Najarian @petenajarian 33mMy son would agree with yaRedan Resources @RedanResources 1h@petenajarian Your #1 gambling stock should be CHDN rather than Draft Kings! Have a look at what CHDN is doing in sports betting. You will have to dig a little. The stock is roaring.
Churchill Downs to erect 30 foot marble statue of Bob baffert in infield. About time.
I mourn for Breonna .I will always mourn .I am comforted her bereaved mother bought an 800k home CASH MONEY and a brand new Bentley .I mourn for Breonna
earnings are tomorrow . if we get some good numbers and guidance i could see this go over 100
all time high today-139 plus . when the the KY Sports betting get passed? will CHDN be at 160?
"Wondering out loud whether the new gaming license just applied for will preclude Churchill from expanding the number of gaming positions at Arlington. Do not know if the expansion requires a new license or just a revision to the existing one. This is an important question since only six new licenses are allowed under the new Illinois gaming bill, as approved by the legislature and signed by the governor. If Arlington cannot be expanded by Churchill under its existing license, there may be a good chance of Arlington's sale, as has been discussed in some press reports."
"Continuing tragic problems at Santa Anita should almost certainly result in the relocation of the Breeders Cup to Churchill. This is also another reason for the continuing stock strength. If one reviews the stock chart, he (she) would see that the past over 12 months has been one of consolidation of prior years' gaiins. This decisive breakout could reach a number few of us can even imagine. As mentioned a few days ago and before the recent stock strength, a possible takeover is certainly a very strong possibility. However, it is going to take a very high offer to secure stockholder approval. The longer prospective suitors wait, the higher the price. Personally, I would rather continue to ride the independent wave."
Hope the FBI make their presence known at this years K Y Derby drugfest !Guaranteed you won’t see Bob Baffert or Doug ONeill anywhere near the winners circle.
"DERBY WEEKAll-sources handle for Opening Night, Saturday, April 28, through Derby Day, Saturday, May 5, rose to a new record of $311.2 million, up 9% from the previous record of $285.1 million set last year. Attendance for those five days was 375,346, up 7% over 2017."
"Since CHDS increased their takeout to the maximum legal limit on all bets, and they continue to break a dime on each dollar, it's IMPOSSIBLE to make any money at CD anymore. I haven't been out there in two years, and used to hardly miss a day after work. When CD went corporate, greed took over."
"RIP John Asher, great guy, great ambassador for horse racing and the ying to the yang that is cold, corporate image of Churchill Downs. Really the one person at Churchill Downs who is irreplaceable -- the place won't be the same without him."
does anyone think there will be 10- 20 thousand allowed at the derby
"The gambling expansion bill passed over the weekend by the Illinois legislature authorizes six new casinos, sports betting and slots at O'Hare and Midway as well as truck stops. Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker is expected to sign the bill shortly.Union Gaming's John DeCree says slot suppliers are a key beneficiary of the new legislation given the sheer magnitude of newly authorized gaming positions, calling out Churchill Downs CHDN (CHDN +1.4%) is an obvious beneficiary with its Arlington Park racetrack and sports betting across its OTB network in the state."
"Maine governor Janet Mills vetoed the bill the would have allowed sports betting at Oxford Casino.Very sad day in Maine when one woman decides that grown adults can't manage their on money and decisions.Wish CHDN would have ""convinced"" her to lighten up a bit and allow freedom in her little corner of America."
"BOAF, old bud, say, friend, if you’re out there looting size 41 R Brioni or Zegna sport coats work for me.Plus anything Gucci .Louis Vuitton, please don’t bother. Too ghetto."
"Kentucky moving towards sports gambling In November, Senator Julian Carroll unveiled a revised version of the sports betting bill originally filed in 2017. The bill would include gambling on both college and professional sports and would also include a heavy tax rate of 3% of the handle along with a $250,000 initial licensing fee.In January, two more bills were introduced to continue the push for sports gambling in Kentucky. These bills would allow sports betting as well as daily fantasy sports and online poker.While there are other focuses in Kentucky, sports betting still seems to be a high priority with a bright future in sight."
"The largest shareholder, as a result of the purchase of Arlington in Illinois, is now 97 years old. No matter how he has structured his holdings, whether by trust or whatever, the eventual tax bill is going to be a windfall for Liz Warren, God forbid, or whoever is running the show at the time of his passing. The next positive announcement should be the gaming in Arlington, which must be determined by the end of August. Then it will be two months of no news as Churchill awaits its next earning report. I have to believe that an eventual sale of Churchill is in the cards, no pun intended. Continued patience will be the best course, again no pun intended."
Why doesn’t Churchill Downs buy William Hill?

"Pressure Isle.That dump.Did well when there weren't casinos in Cleveland.Smack in the middle of nowhere.Buffalo/niagra falls area over saturated with casinos.Bright spots to presque isle.There's a few motel 6 types hotels next door.Don't need to buy cigarettes, the entire casino reeks of smoke.When the chef runs out of beef, plenty of cheap horses available.Got me again on this senseless acquisition."
Anyone read the Yelp reviews on the Calder Casino ?Entertaining and funny.UCMTSU. No way.Run past the Calder employees posts and it is widely accepted that the casino itself is an eyesore which serves frozen food and is like a post office.241 on this stock ?See you at 20.
Lots of spam artists on here.Be careful.This stock is not for the faint hearted.
"chdn is cheap. ONLY 4 bil market cap. in the gambling stocks its the only one at a 52 week high. their revenue streams will be growing with sports gambling soon all over Illinois. KY will eventually get their wish too and pass that too. and i was saying chdn will grow and is cheap. why wouldnt they be bought out? what would it take? LVS or MGM swoops in and buys them out, 180 a share?? or even better they start to do some buying now as they are growing. buy the NJ Meadowlands and take northern NJ and their sports book or some other state that has legalized it. now is the time. all this sports gambling is in its infancy."
"have you noticed the weak exotic bet payouts this year? that's the result of the highest takeout percentages in the industry combined with 10 cent breakage ( round down) on each dollar bet. when Churchill went corporate, greed took over.their new slogan should be : ""where greed tops legends"". and the industry wonders why horse racing is dying."
"Management is going to take advantage of the current low interest rate environment with the construction of the new project in northern Kentucky. This will be in direct competition with New York's growing thoroughbred industry. With far better and more temperate weather, one would expect much of New York's winter season to gravitate back home to Kentucky. Coupled with a new gaming venue, the bottom line of Churchill has nowhere to go but up and up. Without any doubt, this company is destined to become a major national force in the gaming industry."
"If I ever get audited again by the IRS, ( hopefully not since I changed my political party to Democrat ) can I borrow one of those sharp CDI accountants. We’re they previously employed at Sunbeam ?"
Like Twinspires can compete against TVG and Expressbet !What a waste of money runn8ng commercials on nbcsn all day.
the least popular governor in the united states by a poll recently is the Kentucky gov republican Matt Bevin and he is running for reelection. There is no way he can win against Kentucky Attorney General Andy Beshear. Beshear is all for legalizing sports gambling to shore up the pension debt the state has. CHDN just bought Turfway park 10 miles south of Cincinnati. sports gambling will be in KY So soon with the New Gov Beshear who definately wins. Bevins has always been against sports gambling and made up stories and lies of how gambling leads to suicides every day of the year. look it up. with sports gambling next year all over kentucky this is a 160.00 stock. not only will there be new revenue from all over the state we now get Ohio revenue too. and keep the folks from gong to Indiana.
CHDN earnings “ beat “
Likely to drift further down until mid April. I'll wait a few weeks to add.
"BC handle DOWN 4 % .Good job, CD !"

"Betonallfours, you’ve been a fade on this stock for years.When the creative accounting disappears it will be game set and match for me yet again.Horse racing is finished.

"Great management! Could not make the numbers work at Arlington, and the table has been set for the eventual sale of this venue. Illinois is too tough an environment in which horse racing must operate. Was not surprised by this decision, especially with the application last week for a gaming license not tied to horse racing. Management is building a gaming empire brick by brick. This is a spectacular long term investment, though the short term has not been too bad either."

"In fact, it was 34% rise from trough in 2018 until a couple weeks after Kentucky Derby. Even if we count that from now in January, that puts it at over $352 by mid-May. Pre-split numbers, of course. By that time it would be 1/3 of that due to the 3:1 split (ex-dividend of January 28)."
Phony stock.Accounting irregularities bigly.
"The latest fatal injury to a thoroughbred at Santa Anita raises speculation about the future of the Breeders’ Cup.Twenty-seven horses have died at Santa Anita in less than six months.Churchill Downs said it is ready to host again if racing at Santa Anita is deemed too risky.“If they had an accident at Santa Anita, my God, the publicity would be off the charts,” WAVE 3 News contributor Billy Reed said. “There’s a movement in California right now to ban thoroughbred racing.”By comparison, there were 36 deaths on all Kentucky tracks in all of 2018. That was at a rate higher than the national average. There were 24 deaths in 2018 at Churchill Downs.""The Breeders' Cup team knows we're available to step up and host if we're ever needed,"" Churchill spokesman Darren Rogers said.For the city of Louisville, the return of the Breeders' Cup for the second straight year would be an economic gift.Breeders’ Cup visitors spent $50 million when Churchill Downs hosted last year."
"It wasn't that long ago CD security strong armed paralyzed Secretariat jockey Ron Turcotte for not having handicapped credentials,"
The stewards decision was correct. I’m surprised it took so long.Saez May have been on more controlled substances than his horse.Turning for home he clearly shut off Shugs horse on the rail. Then pinballs out and almost forced War of Wills down to the ground. And if Wills went down figure another 5 to 8 horses crossing the finish line without their jockeys and a couple of horses euthanized.CDI needs to ban Saez for life.As for Servis it’s about time. You’re a disgrace.

"Over 10% of the outstanding shares of Churchill Downs were ADDED to hedge funds and institutional investors in the first quarter of 2019. This was reported yesterday (the 25th of July). One can easily see that this new 4.22 million shares in positions is quite simply shares removed from the public float. This further explains the increasing volatility of the price in recen weeks. If the earnings are as positive as I hope (and anticipate), she should move up quite nicely in coming days. Of course, this is dependent upon a reasonably stable overall market environment. I have to believe that Susquehanna's first Churchill coverage so close to an earnings release had some positive background ""feelings"" to have published it yesterday."

"Excellent management, new acquisitions and investments starting to pay off, Japan covering Derby big winner especially for wager side of business, well over $120 by next reporting period!"
"Less than one hundred thousand shares in a very strong up market environment. Thus, no sign yet of short covering. Since well over two million shares are short, batten down the hatches for a major up day in the not too distant future. This baby can fluctuate with the best of them, and I expect to see an over $130 print fairly soon. It will not be like the unfettered spike last time, which really was a market order that was eaten alive. Do not know how long it will take for the review of their recent casino license in Waukegon to be completed and determined. That will give it further impetus. Earnings not due for nearly two more months. Company buyback of shares helps give it a floor during market downswings in this era of a trade war. If the news can stay positive for more than a couple of days, maybe it can get going on the upside. Also, an eventual sale of the poorly performing Arlington Park would be helpful as well. Patience will definitely pay off in the long run."

"It's coming! The Illinois House on Saturday approved a comprehensive expansion of gaming in the state. This means 1200 gaming positions at Arlington Park (+ sports betting), expanding up to a total of 2000 positions at Rivers, and sports betting for all casinos. This finally happened because the state needs the tax revenue too much. Our politicians aren't very good with other peoples money."

"Admit that my expectation of the BC relocation was in error. Whether it be at Santa Anita or Churchill, the most important thing is the health of the horses. I often visit various tracks and will be at Saratoga in the coming days. That meeting is probably the best in the entire U.S. and includes the best horses, trainers, and jockeys. It will be a very entertaining watch on FS2 starting on Thursday, July 11. In the meanwhile, I hope many CHDN shareholders have read about the incredible success Derby City Gaming is having for the company. The growing importance of gaming within Churchill only adds to its almost certain future success. By the way, I do not remember which poster targeted the stock to be $120 come earnings time, but congratulations on a very good call."
"the last time i was at Churchill downs two years ago, i noticed i was not getting my twin spires points. when i asked the teller, she advised that you no longer get points when you bet at the track. but you still got points when you bet on line. i wondered what kind of marketing program would incentive you to stay home and bet, rather than coming to the track! i did some research and soon found out why: the horsemen get a reduced share when you bet on line vs a bet placed at the track!"
"Seem like some pretty sound acquisitions. Take out a competitor in Mississippi and get a strong foothold in Pennsylvania via a racino, but the bigger target in that state is legalized sports gaming, which CHDN is just waiting to pounce on.Bernice, I know I told you to buy at $30, but you might want to get back in before it hits $330."
"Who wants to be in Louisville in November ?Or any other month ? Breeders Cup needs to be in Cali or GP,"
What a pair to draw to....Unga Dale Romans and Rick Pitino in the winners circle at GP Saturday.Those two deserve one another !
anyone know whats up? Down $11
FS moving Preakness to Laurel.Florida Derby becomes the first leg of the Stronach 3.10 million dollar purses with cumulative point totals for bonus.Sad to see the KY Derby meet its peril.
"wow. have you noticed the ""huge"" trifecta payouts at CD since they increased their takeout? $8.40, $14.60, $11.20, and many more.with their increase in their takeout, and the continued dime on the dollar breakage, you've got to be out of your mind to bet exotics at CD.CD: ""where greed tops heritage""."
"Speaking of the K Y Derby, it looks all West Coast to me. CD can't stop baffert. Too afraid I reckon."
"Oxford crowd and profits are good. New Hotel and more slots coming there. Smalll part of the company , but a very profitable casino."
Companies like CHDN should be utilizing the cutting edge security devices from AiTX. Besides the added security and convenience it will reduce expenses significantly.
TV ratings for K Y Derby DOWN 13%.Wonder why ?LMFRIGGINAZZOFD
CHDN reached a new All Time High at 242.15
My bad. To think TSG would come down hard on Horse racing’s Lance Armstrong was shortsighted on my part. Stronachs a cheat. As is Baffert. Birds of feathers flock together.
"I tried once before here to post about CHDN, but it was deleted. I believe that CHDN is the undervalued way to play sports betting, much better than the over-hyped and over valued Draft Kings. Do some homework on what CHDN is doing in that area. CHDN had run up large before everything was shut down. It is doing the same again now."
"the model for corporate greed in a dying industry. maximum legal takeout, with taxes and high breakage (twice what nyra tracks are), an industry built on cheating jockeys, trainers that are crooks and druggers; no national governing agency; tracks that look the other way. the players don't have a prayer. used to be fun."
Here comes the spammers.CAVEAT EMPTOR
Earnings?
"take two horses-- the same weight as derby winner-- and medicate with the salve. wait two days with one, and two weeks the other, and then take blood samples. check results. problem solved."
Acquisitions are starting in the sector with the draftkings announcement. $GNOG could be a target $CHDN $DKNG $MGM $PENN
Spammers alive and well on CHDN board.
Got to hand it to Baffle Bob.Shrines honoring him should be erected on ALL racetracks.
The Ax man.Reckon when all that Baffert ' magic ' wears off we all see what happens.Hope everyone at CD enjoyed the tribute to Justify.Surprised that piece of junk could still stand.
"K Y Derby attendees must really feel like schmucks when they're belted with rain, year after year.NBC was "" blacking "" up the coverage today.It's about time.For a while I was believing the only Afro American permitted on CD grounds was Michael Jordan."
Rumor has it that gan and kambi are replacing sbtech as software providers for churchill online website sportsbook.Check out BRGGF b2b software provider like gan but 35MILLION market cap same growth as gan but its price to sales .75 (gan is 117) BRGGF just signed sbtech and kambi agreements. Goood luck on churchill im in longterm
Buying stock in a company cooking their books can be deleterious to your financial well being !
Long on CHDN good mgt. I never posted a stock before until this one BRGGF. (b2b software for gambling companies) ONLY 30 MILLION market cap . price to sales about .75 revenue growth 50 pct and they just signed Kambi and rumor has it churchill downs is working with kambi now also. They also signed sbtech and countless others in last year. Every time i research them i find their valuation too good to be true. Earnings are tomorrow morning so i would get in today as its only . I find downside limited but upside who knows 10x 20x 5x 50xTake look at BRGGF its market cap is only 35 million .Its P/S is only .75 revenue growth 50 % and its b2b software and just signed deals with sbtech and kambi and numerous others. Looks like chdn getting rid of sbtech to go with GAN and KAMBI announcement coming soon although CEO of Gan hinted at it already.
"BOAF, how about a bake sale in Louisville to benefit Billy Johns gapped teeth ? Your Mamaws possum vittles should do the trick.Plus you could get on "" all fours "" with a fifth of Makers Mark and perform what you do best,Put me down for a hundred, son.#MCSA"
"RIP CHDN's shareholder pass program, the company's last vestige of doing right by its customers."

"With Susquehanna's price target of $140 as of this a.m., it is only a matter of days (or weeks) before Telsey, Jefferies, and JP Morgan raise their price targets as well. Maybe they will just wait until earnings next week, but they would be better advised to adjust their outlooks prior to the 31st. That way they can look like heroes for their followers. Just my take."
"Bob Baffert, the ' Barry Bonds ' of horse racing.the guy who some have credited for saving this game has actually destroyed it. Baffert couldn't hold Darnell's shoe laces."

"Reckon there won’t be a record setting KY Derby this year, got to think there won’t be any K Y derby this year, have to tighten them slots up in Oxford , that’s the ticket, m."
Running the Kentucky Derby in September is like holding Christmas in March.
"Looks like I got in a little too early, again. Started accumulating shares in February based only on their acquisition of 62% of Rivers Casino near Chicago. Rivers is a 1st Class operation and management there does almost everything right."
"Highly doubt with all this BLM extortion, Breona Taylor distorted facts, prospects for more division with Obama’s handpicked president COMMIEla Harris, a run for the roses may be a thing of the past.It’s not like CD is situated in a safe area.Hope you can keep the slots tight and the crime down."
"Very disappointed that Baffert's reputation has now been greatly tarnished. Since the 1960's, when I used to frequent Golden Gate Fields and Bay Meadows in the San Francisco Bay Area, one would have hoped that the industry had finally been cleaned up. In those days, I befriended a few of the ""straw hat and cigar smoking"" handicappers to learn of the day's drugged horses. The daily double had become an important source of funds to continue my college education at Berkeley. It worked out quite well on many an occasion. But here we are 50 years later, and the same nonsense continues in California, at least. Of course, it is most probable that it continues behind the scenes nationwide. It will now become 100 percent necessary to test the blood samples of the major stakes winners across the country. Since it is like the Olympics for horses, we should expect nothing less. Purses will have to be impounded until everything is proven to be on the up and up. The first failures will make the headlines I am certain. The Baffert story has not received the play that it deserves, but as the Breeders Cup approaches, I hope the story becomes front and center."
Hope Gary Barber takes up cokeheads wests on his 5 million dollar side bet. Let’s be frank. If Maximinm Security ran straigh5 war of wills would be seek8ng the triple crown in 3 weeks.
"When Arlington Park sells, CHDN will pick up between $250mm and $500mm in cash. The track is comprised of approx 250 acres valued at $1mm to $2mm/acre. Cash flow is modest in an evolving industry that has long moved to e wagering. It is very infrequent that a company has an opportunity to garner this type of cash without issuing new equity or selling a cash producing operation. A sale, which will happen, will change the risk profile dramatically at a time the market has embraced internet sports wagering and CHDN is a leader."
"Jay borenstein, you will be singing a different tune might quick. Nice spam."
What is the reason for buying back the stock/
sports gambling has entirely transformed the racetracks in NJ. The Meadowlands in North NJ maybe 20 min from NYC is jammed now and it was a ghost town. sports gambling is coming to KY and not only with tracks be jammed more people but so will the casinos like Derby City Gaming will have a sports book. this is a new revenue stream and it will take this stock into the 120's to the towards the 150's bye the end of 2019
"The very new ETF with the symbol BETZ has CHDN as a core holding. That's what I expected. The interesting fact is that the ""Thematic Relevance"" for CHDN being included is not horse racing or casinos, but ""Sports Book."" That's the reason that I bought CHDN several months ago."
"11/26 FRANKFORT, Ky. — Attorney General Andy Beshear sent a letter to state lawmakers asking them to legalize casinos and sports betting as the way raise money to save Kentucky's ailing public pension system.""The solution is not to cut legally promised benefits ..."" Beshear said in a two-page letter to legislators on Monday. ""The answer is simple – expanded gaming including casino, fantasy sports, and sports gaming, as well as preparing for the eventual legalization of online poker.""Churchill Downs Incorporated operates as a racing, gaming, and online entertainment company in the United States. It operates through Racing, Casinos, TwinSpires, and Other Investments segments. The company operates 4 racetracks, including Churchill Downs Racetrack in Louisville, Kentucky; Arlington International Race Course in Arlington Heights with 11 off-track betting (OTB) facilities in Illinois; Fair Grounds Race Course in New Orleans along with 12 OTBs in Louisiana; and Calder Race Course in Miami Gardens, Florida. It also operates five casinos, which provides brick-and-mortar real-money casino gaming services with approximately 10,000 gaming positions; and operates 3 hotels. In addition, the company through TwinSpires.com operates mobile and online wagering business; and a platform for betting on horseracing, as well as offers streaming video of live horse races, replays, and an assortment of racing information. Stock IS 268 right now.After this split from right here, the stock will be 86 dollars a share and the float is ONLY 11M and legalized sports gambling will run this up and any action will run this up. this is a 125 dollar stock come march madness. Then the Horses triple crown comes up again. the chart this year is so so. but all of 18 is so so. but look at the run its been on. this stock has soared and will soar a lot more. IMO."
$110 by earnings conference call? That should launch a new rally leading into the Kentucky Derby.
its good to be long $chdn
"CNBC this a.m. by owner of 76'ers and New Jersey Devils: as far as new industries tied to sports, the advent and expansion of sports gaming will result in profits in the tens of billions of dollars over the coming decade. Quite obviously, Churchill is positioning itself to be a major participant in this evolving profit center. Recent expansions, including their application in Waukegon and last evening's announcement for northern Kentucky is probably only the tip of the iceberg. This forward looking management team is going to put Churchill in the merger sites of the most major of players in the gaming industry. This stock, with only 40 million shares outstanding, will fast become a must in institutional growth portfolios."
Loving this one for a long time...its only gearing better
CHDN reached a new All Time High at 304.84
i have been saying when sports gambling passes this stock would rise. and here we go. now i was talking about KY but thats still on the back burner its Illinois that just went through and CHDN owns the big race track in Arlington Ill. that and all of their otb in that state is moving this up . new revenue stream and i think this goes up another 10 percent before next earnings.
Kintuckys signature industry and only true contribution
Was that BOAF in the Ft. Lauderdale airport ?One sick #$%$.
"Earnings estimates range from the $2.70's with Zack to $2.97 at earnings whispers. Was at $3.03 at the latter, but has been reduced in recent weeks. The TD Ameritrade site shows an estimate of $2.81, which is down from $2.90 only a week ago. The only earnings beat that can move the stock higher will have to show a $3 handle. If not, the stock will probably succumb to some profit taking of consequence. I am a long term holder; thus, I will ride the wave either higher or lower. Let's hope for the former."

"According to Earnings Whispers and Benzinga, Churchill beat both on the top and bottom lines once again. Dow Jones reflects the bottom line without the adjustments necessary to arrive at the correct earnings per share number of $2.83. Wish we could have seen $3.00, but the startup costs of various venues took a small bite, even though they are capitalized."

"Pullback is excellent opportunity to add to positions. Louisville newspaper reports yesterday that a downtown hotel has almost sextupled its room price for days of Breeders Cup races. Whether they have been clued in with some inside information, we will see on Thursday. That is the final day that would allow races to be relocated to Churchill Downs. The meeting is this Thursday in Lexington. Let's hope the directors have the common sense to relocate the races to defuse the potentially explosive reporting that could occur from Santa Anita. That would be a strong negative for the entire industry."

Not the tank I was looking for today but I made my $10k on the short nonetheless and I covered. Put $8k in my pocket and bought puts with the other $2k. I suspect a much bigger drop is still coming. Good luck either side.
It's opening day at CD and one week to the K Y Derby.Just say NO to Caton Bredar.Don't forget the box seats for the Brooks brothers.What would CDI betting be without the robots ?
"Anyone interested in buying this stock, watch the order depth and/or options prices to get a read on short term stock price direction. I've noticed that the options prices move up or down a good 5-10 minutes before the stock price moves in that same direction. CHDN isn't the most liquid stock in the world. If you watch how buy/sell orders are stacking up in Level II, or alternatively, just watch option prices near the current strike price, you could get a little advance warning about the direction of the stock price (short term). FYI. Most options prices follow the stock price, but I've found CHDN to be opposite."
zacks got the letters wrong for this. the shell company has gone up 1000% today.
"What an honest industry. Celia promises Oaklawn will resolve the Baffert split sample drug inquiry ""quickly""--a month ago. Love to know who Bob pays and how."

"The stock move in CHDN is def perplexing when you figure that this mgmt team has done some transactions that have greatly negatively affected shareholders. Sold this Big fish for a song back in 2017. Was hugely acquisitive in 2018 and 2019 at the wrong time. Company is now straddled with $2 billion of debt plus its share of Midwest gaming debt of several hundred million. CHDN’s investment in Midwest is currently valued at $800 million more than the underlying assets which suggests maybe its overstated and needs to be impaired? But no need to worry because CHDN continues to grant itself huge amounts of stock which get adjusted for performance targets! Awesome! Stock awards of over 500,000 shares are currently floating around out there. Management continues to be very good to itself."
what happened at oaklawn? how were his two suspensions there weeks ago resolved? too much smoke over the years for there not to be fire. it's such a shame that such a personable person has to cheat. it will hurt if he's suspended. but it will hurt all of the industry if it's found true and is whitewashed.
