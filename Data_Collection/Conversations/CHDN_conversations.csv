"Kentucky moving towards sports gambling In November, Senator Julian Carroll unveiled a revised version of the sports betting bill originally filed in 2017. The bill would include gambling on both college and professional sports and would also include a heavy tax rate of 3% of the handle along with a $250,000 initial licensing fee.In January, two more bills were introduced to continue the push for sports gambling in Kentucky. These bills would allow sports betting as well as daily fantasy sports and online poker.While there are other focuses in Kentucky, sports betting still seems to be a high priority with a bright future in sight."

they dont make too many mistakes 1 more meet at the formerly great arlington park and the sale of very valuable property after covid and real estate like this will demand top dollar
"I sold my 122 cost shares at 193 this morning. I'm not really a trader, but this early move was over the top. I'll be back if we get a chance at a reasonable settled price."
anyone know whats up? Down $11
I mourn for Breonna .I will always mourn .I am comforted her bereaved mother bought an 800k home CASH MONEY and a brand new Bentley .I mourn for Breonna
"i realize the market is down, and the fact that chdn has just run up nice. but shouldn't this be up today with the derby just running and the huge money they HAD to make over it??"
CHDN earnings “ beat “
"When Arlington Park sells, CHDN will pick up between $250mm and $500mm in cash. The track is comprised of approx 250 acres valued at $1mm to $2mm/acre. Cash flow is modest in an evolving industry that has long moved to e wagering. It is very infrequent that a company has an opportunity to garner this type of cash without issuing new equity or selling a cash producing operation. A sale, which will happen, will change the risk profile dramatically at a time the market has embraced internet sports wagering and CHDN is a leader."
A heartfelt speedy recovery for the majority leader from Moscow.Everyone remember when Harry Reid had his workout “ accident ? “Hope “ MM “ didn’t double cross Russian foreign agents.
"CNBC this a.m. by owner of 76'ers and New Jersey Devils: as far as new industries tied to sports, the advent and expansion of sports gaming will result in profits in the tens of billions of dollars over the coming decade. Quite obviously, Churchill is positioning itself to be a major participant in this evolving profit center. Recent expansions, including their application in Waukegon and last evening's announcement for northern Kentucky is probably only the tip of the iceberg. This forward looking management team is going to put Churchill in the merger sites of the most major of players in the gaming industry. This stock, with only 40 million shares outstanding, will fast become a must in institutional growth portfolios."
"Offcourse the moment that I sell it, after holding it for months it goes up by 32 points. I missed out on 38,000 dollars. God I have the worst luck ever."
Expect to see some really fancy cooking going in Chdn s accounting office
This stock is a CAN'T LOSE!
"Nice post-split rally. Heading into earnings call late Feb/early Mar, then the Kentucky Derby. I think all of this will help sustain a rally to break solidly above the resistance trendline on the one year chart."
Nice ER and guidance.
i have been saying when sports gambling passes this stock would rise. and here we go. now i was talking about KY but thats still on the back burner its Illinois that just went through and CHDN owns the big race track in Arlington Ill. that and all of their otb in that state is moving this up . new revenue stream and i think this goes up another 10 percent before next earnings.
Churchill Downs isn’t exactly situated in an upscale area . Oh well . Reckon y’all should be happy CD structure is still intact .
Running the Kentucky Derby in September is like holding Christmas in March.
"Santa Anita has approved a shrine to honor and immortalize Bob Baffert. It is expected to be completed by July 15, 2022"
FS moving Preakness to Laurel.Florida Derby becomes the first leg of the Stronach 3.10 million dollar purses with cumulative point totals for bonus.Sad to see the KY Derby meet its peril.
"Anyone interested in buying this stock, watch the order depth and/or options prices to get a read on short term stock price direction. I've noticed that the options prices move up or down a good 5-10 minutes before the stock price moves in that same direction. CHDN isn't the most liquid stock in the world. If you watch how buy/sell orders are stacking up in Level II, or alternatively, just watch option prices near the current strike price, you could get a little advance warning about the direction of the stock price (short term). FYI. Most options prices follow the stock price, but I've found CHDN to be opposite."
Looks like RAIN RAIN and more RAIN for the K Y derby.Are any tornadoes expected ?
"11/26 FRANKFORT, Ky. — Attorney General Andy Beshear sent a letter to state lawmakers asking them to legalize casinos and sports betting as the way raise money to save Kentucky's ailing public pension system.""The solution is not to cut legally promised benefits ..."" Beshear said in a two-page letter to legislators on Monday. ""The answer is simple – expanded gaming including casino, fantasy sports, and sports gaming, as well as preparing for the eventual legalization of online poker.""Churchill Downs Incorporated operates as a racing, gaming, and online entertainment company in the United States. It operates through Racing, Casinos, TwinSpires, and Other Investments segments. The company operates 4 racetracks, including Churchill Downs Racetrack in Louisville, Kentucky; Arlington International Race Course in Arlington Heights with 11 off-track betting (OTB) facilities in Illinois; Fair Grounds Race Course in New Orleans along with 12 OTBs in Louisiana; and Calder Race Course in Miami Gardens, Florida. It also operates five casinos, which provides brick-and-mortar real-money casino gaming services with approximately 10,000 gaming positions; and operates 3 hotels. In addition, the company through TwinSpires.com operates mobile and online wagering business; and a platform for betting on horseracing, as well as offers streaming video of live horse races, replays, and an assortment of racing information. Stock IS 268 right now.After this split from right here, the stock will be 86 dollars a share and the float is ONLY 11M and legalized sports gambling will run this up and any action will run this up. this is a 125 dollar stock come march madness. Then the Horses triple crown comes up again. the chart this year is so so. but all of 18 is so so. but look at the run its been on. this stock has soared and will soar a lot more. IMO."
It's opening day at CD and one week to the K Y Derby.Just say NO to Caton Bredar.Don't forget the box seats for the Brooks brothers.What would CDI betting be without the robots ?
TV ratings for K Y Derby DOWN 13%.Wonder why ?LMFRIGGINAZZOFD
"Hey BOAF, any talk of moving CD to the old Aksarben ?You know you will never run another KY Derby , with spectators again ?How times have changed.Stat safe, bud. Fortunately, I live in ot those areas that are 99.56% pure !"
Set a low limit and buy low and set a $20 increase to sell.... been doing this for years and it pays the bills!!!!!
What is the reason for buying back the stock/
Dividend increase 3 for1 stock split announced
"RIP John Asher, great guy, great ambassador for horse racing and the ying to the yang that is cold, corporate image of Churchill Downs. Really the one person at Churchill Downs who is irreplaceable -- the place won't be the same without him."
Obvious CD was more concerned with the outside climate than keeping an eye on Bob Baffert.Add “ Authentic “ to the long list of doped up equines under Baffert tutelage.Absolutely amazing this cheat still has a trainers license .
"The last straw for me was when they quit giving twin spires points on bets placed on-site, while still giving points on bets placed on-line. I couldn't understand the logic. Did they not want me there buying $5 cans of beer? The real answer is the horsemen get a smaller cut from on-line bets.PS, The track with the fairest takeout in North America is Woodlawn. Makes a big difference in your potential winnings."
"Stock under accumulation between $120 and $125 before next move higher. Continued growth in sports book looks very impressive, coupled with new northern Kentucky track and gaming venue. Excellent growth stock in very high quality portfolios. Actually expect major Vegas/Macau company -- i.e. MGM, Wynn, or Sands -- to take a run at Churchill eventually. It may have already occurred, though I doubt it could have remained quiet in today's market environment. Whether management would even agree to talks is an interesting question; however, the age of largest Churchill shareholder (97) must be taken into consideration. The way management is going about its daily business of grow at a rapid pace is an interesting way to keep suitors away in the near term."
