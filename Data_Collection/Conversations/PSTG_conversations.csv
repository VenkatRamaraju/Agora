"Pure Storage upgraded to Outperform at Cowen; tgt $301:12 PM ET 4/8/19 | Briefing.com. Cowen upgrades PSTG to Outperform from Market Perform and sets target price at $30. Competitive dynamics within NAND should push procurement costs below what investors contemplate, and PSTG is the most significant beneficiary from this change. Firm expects PSTG to double revs and quadruple EPS from C2018 to C2021 to achieve at least $1 in EPS as PSTG transforms its portfolio toward a higher-margin, software-centric model. Firm views Pure Storage's revolutionary approach to NAND flash mgmt (DirectFlash software) as a sustainable competitive moat against competitors who procure SSDs for their hybrid and all-flash arrays, and they see co best positioned among the entire memory supply chain from precipitous declines in NAND ASPs over the next few quarters. Firm is beginning to see significant adoption of Pure's model, manifested in changes in the composition of PSTG's balance sheet: accelerating deferred revenue growth and higher PP&E to sales. They postulate that this initial adoption portends (A) a healthy, multiyear revenue backlog, and (B) transformation into a true hardware-software SaaS business model that will drive sustainable ROIC above its hardware-software competitors."
"glad, I'm long and have accumulated gradually 500 stocks, avg. @20, PSTG is going to the moon tomorrow :-)"
Pure is back on track and looks like guidance is bullish! Still fairly cheap with only a 6 Billion market cap. Other larger tech company may show interest (ie. Cisco who's already partnered with them)! Will continue to hold !!!!
I’m relatively new to this stock… Who are the most likely take over candidates that would acquire Pure Storage??
6 analysts raised Pure's target price after the Analyst's Day and Product Launch.
The market is down and this thing is holding strong around $24 a share. Imagine a solid green day.
Pure Storage Accelerate Starts Monday in Austin TX lets see what is Announced? Could help drive additional markets
Thank PSTG.
I am watching closely its earning
Gonna be green tomorrow
"Pure Storage (NYSE:PSTG) shares are rallying after a note from JPMorgan analyst Pinjalim Bora calling the company ""well positioned in the market to take share from other large incumbent storage vendors.""Bora says Pure Storage could pick up additional market share on its path toward re-accelerating growth and increasing its recurring revenue mix.JPMorgan maintains an Overweight rating and $32 price target on Pure Storage.Pure Storage shares are up 8.4% to $19.77."
Very low downside from here - if your willing to hold - this is a very solid enterprise software / hardware company - cloud - storage - 5G - genomics data - big data - Gardner #1 enterprise vendor. What more is there to like! Buy and hold long term - you will be rewarded! I’m adding long term calls at these bargain prices! Even if market tanks this will be taken over by a major cloud vendor. Low downside - huge upside!
One of the few undervalued technology stocks out there. Stay long...
Can we get a power hour please?
"And ""where she stops...nobody knows'. I have been in this position previously, although Covid-19 certainly puts a unique spin on the situation. Long term investors no doubt are still in a position of substantial overall gains on their Pure Storage investment. The only ""nervous Nellie's"" would be those that bought in on the climb to $29 and are now caught at a loss.The overall sentiment must be that the future bodes well for this stock. Should this be your inclination, there are many strategies you could employ. The most obvious would be to average down, thus protecting your original investment with measured points of entry. This would allow you to exit on the way up again, without feeling the pressure of waiting until share price hits $29+. The other alternative is to take a wait and see approach. Should s/p climb...no worries, averaging up is now on the table in a positive environment. Finally, the last alternative is to hold, wait, and should the factors dragging the price down be transient in nature, attempt to time the bottom and push added resources into a substantially undervalued stock. Whatever you decide, the best course of action is to always have an entry plan, and exit plan. Best wishes to all!"
What do the knowledgeable think if IBM's announcement today of it's new smaller cheaper flash array introduction to serve their and PSTG's hybrid cloud market. IBM is omnipotent and really BIG. Some thought IBM was best candidate to acquire IBM. ???
Paul Mampilly of Profits Unlimited put a buy on PSTG at noontime. He's been money!
"I'll tell you what I didn't like about PSTG. I rode it up to high 20's...and sold it on the way down before turning a profit into a loss. Lesson learned...again!. Look at all those $0 cost RSU's the board and mgmt has granted itself, that get exercised and reported in Form 4's. PSTG is diluting shareholders at a pretty high clip. Looking at their Q1 10Q, Note 11 on Page 24, their Wtd Avg. Shares used for eps went from 223.8M to 243.3M over a year. That's 9.6% dilution, primarily due to stock options and RSU's exercises. The Common Stock Equivalents table in the same note shows unvested Options, RSU's (free shares!), and shares associated with Notes, which won't go into dilution until/unless the price per share goes north of $26 or so. I think that's the reason for the statement that inclusion of these items would've been anti-dilutive, as additional shares below strike price are not counted in fully diluted shares. With the stock price down, that's actually helping dilution, as undoubtedly, there are a lot of stock options that are now underwater, and therefore don't count in fully diluted shares.Between salaries, bonuses, and grants, continuing grants, and continuous option exercises, PSTG is driving Operating Income and EPS to well below where it should be for a company at nearly $2B, and now growing < 30%. GAAP and non-GAAP earnings went south in Q1. In my view, the financial model is broken. And a big part of that broken are the massive grants and RSU's that resulted in nearly 10% dilution over the past year. Yes, it's ""non-cash"" to the company. But that means a major chunk of the negative cashflow from operations is weakening the company's balance sheet, vs. being paid for by issuing more stock. Some cash is received from the stock option exercises, at $2, or $4, or $7/share, or whatever the average grant prices are. But the RSU exercises by board members and shareholders pays nothing to the shareholders' company.To be fair, most tech companies do this. RSU's have now been around for...maybe a few decades now. But a) it's a matter of degree, and b) if a company's financial model is working; i.e., they are showing a market required profit/rate of return, that makes it a lot more ok vs. a company losing large amounts of money at projected $1.7B revenue and a 27.4% growth rate.PSTG does have a lot going for it. Great products addressing a growing market...albeit that growth for PSTG is much lower than it used to be. Solid management. But in my view, the share of gross margin + the impact of dilutive options and RSU's at PSTG going to mgmt/directors is out of whack for non-employee/non-board shareholders. This was a big reason why I exited last quarter, and I believe this is a big reason why shares have been languishing, and the P/S ratio is so low. With the growing sales force that mgmt mentioned in the last quarterly con call, if they execute, we could see growth re-accelerate, and the stock price recover. I thought about re-buying in when I heard that, because I do think sales mgmt is solid. But...given the continuous dilution noted above, I decided to leave that possibility for others. GLTA."
"Even though ARK is selling, I still think that this a good play on data in support of IoT, AI, blockchain to ensure that data can be compiled, stored and accessed quickly and easily. I don't currently plan to sell and will most likely add on any continued weakness. PSTG CEO Charles Giancarlo was the former Chief Technology Officer for Cisco and has a current partnership in place with Cisco."
"Undervalued at these levels, 1.6B annual revenue and growing. 70% plus margin, software company margin. Best solution in the market. No forklift upgrades, customers appreciate. Go long, don't worry about day to day price movements. Eventually business grows, stock catch up."
"This is a great value stock. Despite the market turmoil this stock will go to at least 30 where it belongs. They make a lot of money, have a great product and adopting a saas model."
crushed it-24+ possible tomorrow-congrats
Pure will beat top and bottom but Pure hasn't reached the broad base of investors that it needs to reach the next major level. In a few years they'll be talking about Pure on CNBC etc and how there isn't a better choice in data management etc etc... and they be piling on!
"Great product, easy to manage compared to other competitors. Many companies are switching to Pure from a complex environment. No wonder it's now the leader in Gartner's storage vendor quadrant and stock price is going up naturally."
This is the Quarter I was hoping for from last year! Fingers crossed!
"So PURE won a deal with one of the top 10 hyperscalers. In the conference call they said they expect to be able to do a lot more business with this hyperscaler and other hyperscalers. The following is some of the discussion in the q&A.And do you expect this to kind of be the beginning of more potential hyperscale customer traction for the company going forward? And I have a follow-up.CharlieGiancarloYes, it’s a part of their overall operations. So I think the answer is affirmative from the question that you asked. And, we do feel that this is sustainable both in the sense of continuing with this customer, as well as we think it's the beginning of seeing other similarly situated hyperscale customers starting to look at flash as a real alternative.As you may know, most of the hyperscalars, the vast majority of what they store, they store on disk. They may have a little bit of flash in their servers, but for the most part, all storage is on disk. And we think this is the beginning of breaking that structure. We finally have the kind of price performance that can really compete within the disk market."
My wife works for Pure. And I love coming here and seeing nobody posting because it shows how under the radar it still is. We appreciate the extra time to load up at bargain prices. See you all in a couple years!
Eventually the weak hands will be out and PSTG will hold these gains.

Does this classify as to the moon?
9/09/19 Susquehanna Upgrades - Positive 25.0 I'm still waiting for Stifel Nicolaus or one of the same analyst firms to ignite the rocket.
PSTG has over a Billion in cash on hand and are adding to this figure each qtr with their 35-38% rev growth each qtr. They doubled their company size in 2018 (went from approx 1500 people to now approx 3000 employees - sales force growing globally)! Transforming into a software defined company.
"The elephant in the room is obvious. In spite of record quarterly sales, in spite of most 10mil++deals all-time, and in spite of any other bells and whistles this year-end produced, there is concern. Year to year revenue was flat. For all intents and purpose, there was zero growth this past year. Having said that, going into the next quarter, having a record-breaking quarter to build on is promising. Once again Pure Storage investors need to remain patient. Should quarter one be another record breaker, business will be showing a resumption of phenomenal growth."

"Pure Storage (PSTG) saw a positive improvement to its Relative Strength (RS) Rating on Monday, with an increase from 76 to 83. Over 100 years of market history shows that the stocks that go on to make the biggest gains tend to have an 80 or higher RS Rating as they begin their biggest runs."
"William Blair – Pure Storage, Outperform rating“We attended Accelerate 2019 and came away with reinforced conviction that Pure Storage is a tremendously underappreciated growth story. Management articulated its ‘modern data experience’ vision for the next decade and rolled out an expanded product portfolio, continuing its heritage of innovation and broadening the serviceable market for its technology (total addressable market expansion from $24 billion in 2016 to $50 billion today). Yet, at its current scale, Pure is no longer just an upstart innovator, but has become a safe choice for enterprises—which should allow the company to deliver a broader suite of products to the world’s biggest buyers.”"
We hold long enough. Please go up
This stock is still undervalued

Financial Data coming out soon. Let's see what the analysts conclude in conjunction with the earlier announcements.
"The layoff rumour most likely has merit, but you have to understand the dynamics to appreciate the reasoning. No doubt the new COO Paul Mountford is the hitman. After 10 years of friendships and social bonding, it is near impossible for existing management to release all those employees that are redundant, unable to adapt to changing landscapes, or just plain lazy. Mountford will expertly reorganize the workforce into a group that is smaller in number but collectively better able to achieve and exceed goals. Short term pain...long term gain. That is what Mountford was hired to do no doubt. When he is finished he will move on to another organization and ply his trade. Company severance packages will most likely be generous to help affected employees recover and find suitable employment elsewhere. This type of downsizing is often necessary to ensure the company that is reorganizing has all the right people in all the right places for maximum sustained growth. This would be a positive evolution of Pure Storage in spite of the temporary unsettling atmosphere."

@Kevin or @John - what do you think now ? I personally feel the earnings were excellent ..understood the deferred revenue from subscription and contract management issue but these need not to be taken into consideration from Company fantastic growth...I even feel more confident in this company and their prospects...awesome company to Own for next couple of quarters..
"Over valued, can buy at my 17"
This company is a mainstay in my portfolio. I add when I get consecutive down days. it has served me well! calls and options too. easy money to do other things. I recommend it to friends and they get amazed. I am guessing some company gonna get their mind right and try to acquire them in 2022.
Pstg. Predictably the market responded exactly opposite of logic.

Why down after the analyst meeting? Anyone know who is selling?
"Pure Storage (NYSE: PSTG), the IT pioneer that delivers storage as-a-service in a multi-cloud world, today announced further expansion of its robust subscription services portfolio.

For applications running on Kubernetes, Portworx Cloud Consumption aligns spend to actual hours of usage.￼Demand for flexible, pay-as-you-go consumption has never been greater, as customers come to expect the same cloud consumption model and experience whether their solutions and infrastructure is on-premises, at the edge, or in the cloud."
Shooting up nicely ahead of earnings. Good thing coming?
"If you have a short position in this, cover now shorty!"
"I really hope we finally get a base around $30. This company is showing some nice consistency in its performance and better yet, growth is accelerating."
"The earnings are going to be the best PURE has ever had by long shot. Upgrades will come fast and furious. They just released their flash-flash-cloud offering called ObjectEngine. None of their competitors have anything close to it. A full rack ObjectEngine solution delivers 2 PB of Object Storage. Data Protection and Backup is currently top of mind within IT departments and Pure has the best product in the industry, by far! Also, they just took another first step in the NVMe space by announcing an NVMe over ethernet solution. Buy below $20 as this will never again see sub-$20. Don't think they get bought in the near term but I can easily see a buyout next year late for more than $60-$70/share by the likes of CISCO or Hitachi.I'm long (avg price of $16); and am holding for minimum 18 months!! Again, just my humble opinion but I really believe Pure will be a BIG winner before end of 2021. Best of Luck to all the investors!!"

This has increased the delivery speed of the AI development environment, empowering developers with self-service capabilities.

Hopefully the company will close 4Q on a strong note (last day for 4Q is Jan 31st for Pure). Guidance will also be key when they report earnings in late Feb. stock should be in 20s if all goes well.

Olympus using Pure for AI and someone is selling?
"interesting about subscription services exceeding expectation, While Q4 results were below the company's guided ranges, they were directly impacted by two distinct items. First, a process breakdown at a contract manufacturer prevented a number of orders from shipping in the quarter. Second, Pure exceeded its expectations in selling the company's ES2 subscription offering, which ultimately drives positive long-term economics for Pure, but resulted in lower revenue recognized in the quarter. Except for these two items, our revenue and profits would have been within our guided range."
I'm a Puritan!!

$PSTG Target Raised by Stifel Europe Buy USD 28 » USD 30 Target Raised by Deutsche Bank Buy USD 29 » USD 32
"We all wish we had of sold at $29...and if/when it hits $40 we all will say we are glad we didn't sell at $29. As stated before, it is almost impossible to predict markets fluctuations. If we could we would all be rich. Nothing has changed fundamentally since the free-fall from $29 started. A small earnings blip does not explain why all data storage enterprises have fallen with Pure Storage. More established companies with years of stability and/or dividends have still fallen dramatically...just not to the extent of Pure. I would have sold at $29 in hindsight but my over riding feeling was, and still is, that there is more on the table. I always select my investments base on primarily long term outlooks, and continue to feel comfortable that positive forward stock price will present itself. Time will tell."

The only problem with this stock is Data Storage has never been very sexy. But I believe that is changing as we all become more and more data central. A stocks success is half business and half psychological. Both of these are improving but the psychological part is what will rocket PSTG to a whole new level.

"Does it feel to anyone else that this run is different? The climb isn't in anticipation of a good quarter or an event like so many times before, but rather because Pure is finally showing its true value.I feel like this may be the year Pure really gets the recognition it has deserved all along."
Revenues Beat/ Margins Beat. EPS loss more than expected. Conference call should drive us positive tommorow to new highs. Study the NTNX chart and story. This will be a darling.
This was no surprise for hodlers. It was expected to beat expectations in Q3 and Q4 2021 onwards .. Turned out it started in Q2
"I usually find that when large funds purchase blocks of shares for long periods of time...it isn't that they have any particular knowledge of events to unfold. Rather, they have been in the market long enough to understand that certain conditions are presenting that warrant their attention. Having said that, upcoming events that may propel Pure Storage are on the horizon. The debt of $500,000,000 incurred a while back is guaranteed at $26 and change per share. Coupled with the always present takeover activity that follows successful startups, I would think something in the next 2 or 3 quarters may be possible. I'm holding to discover the outcome."
"Earnings, forward guidance, news, acquisitions, sentiment, overall market. Basically that's it. Negatively, earnings have been mixed the past 3 quarters with no guidance. The takeover of Portworx, general market sentiment, along with AARK's sustained purchase of Pure shares is the catalyst inching us higher.If you believe growth at Pure Storage has peaked...get out now. I am not of the opinion growth has flattened. Maybe in the short term, but overall it is the next 1...2...3 years that this stock is going to breakout. That is what we are waiting for. Continued growth will finally turn this company into a profit making beast. When Pure Storage finally transitions to sustained profit, that will be the time to exit.Nothing in technology is a sure thing. One breakthrough by a competitor spells instant turmoil. Your reason for staying long is the firm belief that Pure Storage will push the boundaries, and be the breakthrough enterprise that leads the industry. AARK did not purchase millions and millions of shares in anticipation of fantastical profit immediately. It is a process of thoughtful evaluation coupled with sound internal metrics, driving the need to maximize investor positions. Time will tell."

"When I purchased 1800 shares at $11.50 my decision was always based on two important principles. The first principal was on Pure Storage having all the parameters that I required to initially invest. The second parameter was should unforeseen difficulties affect my investment would I be prepared to hold long term. This is that moment. Since nothing has changed other than sentiment, the obvious response will be to hold long term. This drop in share value is being experienced across the board in data storage. Economy...cyclical norms...trade wars (especially affecting tech) may all be at play. Right now we are seeing market highs everywhere, but data storage seems to be struggling. I always ask myself...what would Warren Buffett ( Graham/Dodd ) do in this situation. Hold long is the answer. We have all been conditioned to immediate gratification. This is the time to be strong and let this sector recover. Ya...I wish I had sold at $29. But I didn't, because I thought at the time there was still more on the table. Sooooo....no advice here for all the others in the same spot...but....I'm in long term...lets see the end of this story."
"Everyone - Please take a moment to empathize with people who bet long prior to the earnings. Its a very difficult day for them and their heart certainly aches in pain as they await their fate on tomorrows open. Please be patient with small cap tech stocks, they need to build up momentum and sometimes they get ahead of themselves.... Long term"

Pure continues to outpace the competition in growth, and is well positioned to continue adding shareholder value."
