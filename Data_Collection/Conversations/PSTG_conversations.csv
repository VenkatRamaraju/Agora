Financial Data coming out soon. Let's see what the analysts conclude in conjunction with the earlier announcements.
"""Pure Storage is looking to re-define itself from a maker of high-end all-flash arrays to a data services company. The reason behind this is twofold. Pure says it is what the market wants, but it also allows the company to access the multiples of an as-a-service company.""If this is successful hodlers will be well rewarded."
"Pure Storage (NYSE: PSTG), the IT pioneer that delivers storage as-a-service in a multi-cloud world, today announced that DC BLOX, a provider of interconnected multi-tenant data centers across the Southeastern U.S., has adopted FlashBlade, Pure's unified fast file and object (UFFO) storage solution, delivered via Pure as-a-Service to power the growing storage infrastructure needs of its customers and accelerate local economic growth."
This is the Quarter I was hoping for from last year! Fingers crossed!
"9/28/2021....................Pure Storage Leads the Industry with New Services and Software to Further Expand its Vision of the Modern Data Experience……………………….Pure Storage Introduces Pure Fusion: A Self-Service, Autonomous Storage-as-Code Platform Built for Limitless Scale…………….Pure Storage Unveils Portworx Data Services, the Industry's First Database-as-a-Service"
Super undervalued for a long time. $40 PT by EoY.
The only problem with this stock is Data Storage has never been very sexy. But I believe that is changing as we all become more and more data central. A stocks success is half business and half psychological. Both of these are improving but the psychological part is what will rocket PSTG to a whole new level.
"Does it feel to anyone else that this run is different? The climb isn't in anticipation of a good quarter or an event like so many times before, but rather because Pure is finally showing its true value.I feel like this may be the year Pure really gets the recognition it has deserved all along."
"New launch event on September, 28 on purestorage's website."
"Pure Storage (NYSE: PSTG), the IT pioneer that delivers storage as-a-service in a multi-cloud world, today announced the release of a new Pure Validated Design (PVD) in collaboration with VMware to provide mutual customers with a complete, full-stack solution for deploying mission-critical, data rich workloads in production on VMware Tanzu."
"Iguazio, the MLOps (machine learning operations) company, today announced that it has become a Pure Storage technology partner. The new partnership will empower enterprises to unlock the value of their data and bring data science projects to life in an efficient, automated and repeatable way.Together, Iguazio and Pure Storage empower enterprises to continuously roll out new AI services by adopting a production-first mindset using technologies which later allow them to scale with AI. By providing enterprise grade capabilities around data management, scale and performance and a layer of abstraction and automation, enterprises can start to focus on their business applications and not the underlying infrastructure."
Hold on tight! Portworx acquisition is contributing a lot on subscription services as we all already know. Q3 is revenue will be a beat!
This company is a mainstay in my portfolio. I add when I get consecutive down days. it has served me well! calls and options too. easy money to do other things. I recommend it to friends and they get amazed. I am guessing some company gonna get their mind right and try to acquire them in 2022.
Pstg. Predictably the market responded exactly opposite of logic.
why the selling today?
Eventually the weak hands will be out and PSTG will hold these gains.
6 analysts raised Pure's target price after the Analyst's Day and Product Launch.
"Pure Storage (NYSE: PSTG), the IT pioneer that delivers storage as-a-service in a multi-cloud world, today announced that Olympus, the world's leading provider of endoscopes and other medical devices, selected AIRI, Pure's reference architecture for AI (artificial intelligence), to contribute to the rapid provision of AI development for the company.￼AIRI, a modern AI infrastructure jointly architected using Pure Storage FlashBlade and NVIDIA DGX-1 Systems, gives Olympus the speed, scalability, and flexibility it needs to continuously develop and deploy high-performance, data-intensive applications. The FlashBlade Unified Fast File and Object (UFFO) platform hosts hundreds of terabytes of data, feeding images and other data into AI and ML (machine learning) models to produce increasingly accurate results over time.When Olympus introduced AIRI into its architecture, they also introduced on-demand storage provisioning for containerized environments. Pure's proactive support has enabled the launch of a container-based AI development platform and environment, while helping to drive more efficient use of resources overall. This has increased the delivery speed of the AI development environment, empowering developers with self-service capabilities. In addition, Pure's FlashBlade and Evergreen Storage solutions proved to be a meaningful benefit by supporting swift upgrades without downtime. Developers are now freed from the burden of resource management in the AI development environment."
Unfortunate the Nasdaq has to tank today of all days.
