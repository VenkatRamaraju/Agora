"If FTC blocks the merger with Abbvie, then who will/can/should buy SOLY?At what price?"
"I got out the same day the announced this horrible deal. I took my profit and walked away. Yet, I truly wish this deal doesn't go through. It felt like a rip-off for those who put their money on this promising company."
https://www.fiercebiotech.com/medtech/abbvie-s-allergan-aesthetics-faces-extended-ftc-probe-550m-soliton-acquisition. Interesting article over FTC and acquisition. Odd that FTC would have concerns about a new tech development from a anticompetitive standpoint. I can’t say I would be disappointed if this merger fell apart with this undisclosed support payments to the largest shareholder.
"This deal is clearly not happening. Whether that's good or bad, I have no idea. We're closer to the pre deal price than the takeover number."
"Boy, they were very successful at shaking out the shares and emptying out the retail shareholders from this stock board. Absolutely dead and buried as to the interest in the outcome and final conclusion of this once phenomenal opportunity. R.I.P."
Love being right all the time. I sell all my high risk holding and buy SOLY for arbitrage. Market is going down while my SOLY will pay me a 9% arbitrage for holding for three or four months. Then I will be sitting on a boatload of cash around the end of the year to see what I want to buy at lower levels.
"Like many others, I sold shares that were long term capitol gains. No reason to hold this stock anymore. Which ever way the sale goes, I expect management to get a flurry of lawsuits after the decision."
Would anyone like to explain what is going on in two sentences?
"So I notice SOLY is up 4+% pre-market and, thinking something is up, I check again 20 minutes after the opening. Alas, down 1%. I have now held my shares for in excess of 1 year and wondering when I am going to get my $22.60 a share. I suppose being a DIY investor means you sometimes remain lost in the woods."
"Bottom line, the SEC should investigate the trading activity by parties involved, including Allergan, AbbVie and insiders at Soliton."
I did not sell. I am still in shock as to the lowball buyout. Am I too emotional? Stubborn?
"With the way the stock has sold off over the past couple weeks, I wonder if insider trading is happening? Any opinions?"
"Just visited the SOLY website -- AGAIN with hopes of finding any current news --- ZERO FOUND!!!As before May 12 2021 was the latest entry on either News - Press Releases - Investors SectionRidiculous that SOLY management has not made any type of statement since May 12!!!The should have released earnings info, and as most of us owning the stock are waiting for merger- buy out news - you would think they would care enough about their shareholders to at least say something - anything - even we do not have any news for you.SOLY management has done as poor a job of relating to -- caring for - their shareholders as any company I can remember over years of investing!! Did not like the selling of SOLY and especially the price - and now the no news from SOLY!!They should be ashamed, but caring so little as they have clearly shown for their shareholders, I am sure they are not!!! So, no news, no opinion except get this done and give me my money!!!"
Anybody know when the buyout gets consummated and the $22.60/share is realized?
"Let's breakdown this manipulated, fake fright fest the crooks have unleashed.If there was real concern.the volume would be 10 times higher. There are few if any buyers (except me).At 20.25, there is an 11.8% return, which could be realized any day...very likely within the next 3 months. Not gonna find that anywhere else.If the deal falls through, the downside is about $3-5, based on pre-takeover price, and the overwhelming disappointment in the $22.60 bargain basement price.Risk/reward is what the market is all about. This is worth it."
Going to be interesting if the merger goes bust. I increased my holding almost fivefold lately based on the arbitrage gain. Like where a hospital gown with my $&# feeling the breeze. Wanted to take a breather from the market for a few months with the expectation the arbitrage would exceed the market gain or loss. All good but I will be taking a hit in the short-term if this goes bust.
My gut feeling is the deal will close in the next few weeks since the insiders have too much in it. Anyone know if there is a way to check FTC on the detail of the 2nd request and on company's response? And to find out when the company has 'substantially' answer the 2nd request?
"If you believe the deal goes through, 13% return is guaranteed."
Would love to know what’s taking the FTC so long on this deal. Should be pretty straightforward unless COVID has them understaffed and operating at a much slower pace. There doesn’t appear to be anything that would raise anti-trust issues in a deal like this. Very interesting to watch . . .
"Not sure about most here, but I'd LOVE to see the deal collapse. I didn't buy in for just a double plus."
