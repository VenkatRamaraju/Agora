"Having been following SOLY for about a year now, the application of the RAP technology on both removing tattoos and reducing cellulite kind of seems a bit like old news now. But it’s not old news, it’s brand new, game-changing technology that has the very real potential to flip these very substantial markets on their head. I believe that the tattoo removal market is vastly underestimated the current 10-12 application, 1-2 year process is so bad. In terms of cellulite reduction, the RAP process will be the one and only non invasive and effective treatment. More specifically, it’ll be the only process able to sever the fibrotic septa which causes cellulite without the application of a hypodermic needle. And then there is potential with keloid scars. At this point, I don’t believe there is a lot of awareness or a broad understanding of what this company is bring to the table and what the potential is here. But that is going to change and when it does, this stock with it’s small float is likely going to take off. And our heavily involved short friends are going to help facilitate this when they are forced to cover. I realize that none of this is new and most of us here are very well aware of these details but it’s good to take a step back and reassess what this is and what we have here. Best of luck to all!"
"I’ve been looking at the SOLY and the InMode (INMD) charts looking for similarities and differences. In particular, I zeroed in on the six month period between March 2020 to September 2020 where INMD went from $17.26 to $36.22. In comparison, in the last six months SOLY has gone from $7.68 to $16.70 which in terms of percentage is almost exactly the same. The interesting for us now is what happened the following six months. In the case of INMD, it more than doubled to $76.61 which if SOLY could reproduce would put us at $33.40 by early Fall 2021."
I feel like a broken record. However I’ll say it for the people in the back “I just bought more Soly!” Soly will be bought out by ALLERGAN. It’s just a matter of time. They’re sitting on the advisory board watching first hand every milestone that Soly is achieving!! Hope nobody misses boat. Good Luck to all !! 
"Zeltiq Aesthetics (ZLTQ), it’s Coolsculpting product and it’s sale to Allergan (AGN) frequently come up when discussing Soliton (Soly) and it’s Rapid Acoustic Pulse technology. Because the Zeltiq experience is usually interpreted as the gold standard, this prompted me to compare the charts of these two companies (prior to Zeltiq being sold to Allergan in August 2017). The Soly chart looks dramatically better than the Zeltiq chart over the first year. Most notably Zeltiq was down more than 60% a year after it was listed while SOLY is up more than 250% during its first year and it has never gone below its price when listed. You can interpret this anyway you want but the takeaway for me is that the investors have shown more confidence in Soly and the value proposition is better. I believe the next six months could be very good for this stock and I’m excited to see what happens."
"When volume is low and price still goes up, sellers are drying up. Good sign for what's ahead. Good luck with the 2.1 million shares short. Oh, and if you want to short more, be my guest."
"With the way the stock has sold off over the past couple weeks, I wonder if insider trading is happening? Any opinions?"
"The institutional investors are sitting pat through these ups and downs. It’s the retail investors taking penny profits and jumping ship on dips that are holding this thing back. And then those same people complain and express frustration that the stock hasn’t taken off. If this describes you, do us a favour and find something else to do for a while and I expect you’ll be pleased with what you find when you check back on SOLY in a few months."
Going to be interesting if the merger goes bust. I increased my holding almost fivefold lately based on the arbitrage gain. Like where a hospital gown with my $&# feeling the breeze. Wanted to take a breather from the market for a few months with the expectation the arbitrage would exceed the market gain or loss. All good but I will be taking a hit in the short-term if this goes bust.
Insiders and Institutions slowly accumulating.Insiders opting for stake in company rather than cash up front.Institutions believe insiders believe...good enough for me.
"Nearly every chronic liver condition eventually results in scarring or fibrosis. Because liver fibrosis offers no symptoms, it is often missed until it becomes more advanced and transitions to cirrhosis. Despite extensive study and research, there is currently no treatment options/medications to reverse cirrhosis and the life expectancy of a person with this condition is 2 years or less. Soliton’s Rapid Acoustic Pulse (RAP) has been demonstrated to reduce the effects of liver fibrosis by 42% in a recent animal study. To the best of my knowledge, this result is unprecedented in both human and animal studies and I’d be shocked if one of the very large multinational pharmaceutical companies doesn’t partner with Soliton to conduct a clinical trial."
Well i just bought 25 shares with my unemployment check i hope i didnt make a mistake. Good morning and good luck All soly Strong!!!

"Cellulite approval has come and gone with little fanfare, and sp didn't receive pop I expected. Likely expectations were built into price, but were they? Here's what's not being considered that should start to leak in coming weeks: detail on marketing and sales roll out. we know they expect to sell 25 units of the RAP device at ~70k in the next two months, but how are they expecting to bring awareness to capability. As many say, you only get one shot to launch a product, so I suspect an influencer has or will be identified to wet appetite for the technology. New indication POC trials scheduled for Q2'21 in the investor presentation were all mentioned as dependent on Covid. I suspect they'll be able to confirm information here soon, and largely dependent on vaccine rollout. Expect news gets better in March and April and will be a supportive catalyst. Interest from large medical equipment companies and possibly Abbvie. Many say they'll need to provide evidence of a successful rollout before companies consider an offer... I completely disagree. A company could come in and buy cheap now vs. a heavily inflated valuation a year from now. And by cheap, I mean 3-4x current levels. Product could complement existing offering and/or help a company's leverage when negotiating with distribution channels (i.e. product covering most of the shelf). Cellulite's potential is underestimated. When they say treatment is delegable you can imagine the reach broadening out beyond high end aesthetics and med spas. This one depends on how they get people's attention and customer adoption rates. Potentially a large retail/franchise opportunity. The last point would be exceeding general expectations related to feedback from customers/timing/revenue. Some items that are top of mind. Very much looking forward to coming weeks and months!"
Me waiting for Soly to run to $15+ tomorrow.
"Soly ... listen up providers struggling for content ( believe me I have been reduced to watching Barney Miller reruns) .Netflix , Hulu , Amazon , could use a new Series called TAT OFF... following individuals making life changes and removing TATS using SOLY. ....getting TATs make statement but so does removing TATS .It writes itself."
"The Keloid / Scar trials taking place at same locations as Cellulite trials, that would indicate to me that the sites conducting cellulite had promising outcomes."
"This deal is clearly not happening. Whether that's good or bad, I have no idea. We're closer to the pre deal price than the takeover number."
"This is a Company that is doing things the right way.The technology is innovative , promising, and marketable.The owners have a track record of getting a new technology approved to market and then selling when time is right.I think this will be a stock when people look back when it is $75 + in (12 to 24 months) and say ....wait this thing sat at 10-10.50 a share for months like a coiled spring...how did I miss this?!?"
"The 3 conference announcements made by SOLY this morning scheduled for next week are targeted toward institutional investors. Could really shake things up, and we see start seeing volume and new deep pocket money coming to the table."
"So, the investors are not giving much weight to tattoo FDA approval.Wow."
TICK TOCK shorts...Tick Tock
Down almost 10% yesterday but only on 384k volume. I'm not worried one bit. Wait for big volume buying.
I'm thinking they got an approval letter from the FDA Friday afternoon and they will issue a PR saying so on Tuesday am. We shall see.
coolsculpting 2.4b inmd 2.8b soly 330m...think we may be undervalued
Who in their right mind is selling right now ???
Love being right all the time. I sell all my high risk holding and buy SOLY for arbitrage. Market is going down while my SOLY will pay me a 9% arbitrage for holding for three or four months. Then I will be sitting on a boatload of cash around the end of the year to see what I want to buy at lower levels.
"Last Spring when SOLY received FDA approval for the Rapid Acoustic Pulse technology for the tattoo indication, the stock rose 380% in one week. With completion of the pivotal trial and submission to the FDA imminent for the cellulite indication, this should be a strong buy."
"The shorts have done very, very well with this stock and made a ton of money here. But with that said, if they aren’t able to leverage their considerable buying power to dictate the price action on a extreme low volume day like today, they’re finished."
Got a nice pamphlet in the mail emphasizing what they've accomplished with before and after photos of what the device can do to help people with keloid scars. It turned out beautifully. Go SOLY!
Does someone know when product will finally be released so revenues can start? Have they announced a target date?
The hedges and the shorts are having a field day dropping this for crumbs. SOLY has delivered on 100% of goals and is only weeks/a couple months away from sales launch. The sale price is a gift!
"Allergan is a $66 billion dollar pharmaceutical company that acquires, develops, manufactures and markets brand name drugs and medical devices in the areas of medical aesthetics, eye care, central nervous system, and gastroenterology. In 2017 Allergan purchased Zeltiq Aesthetics for $2.4 billion dollars to get access to their body sculpting Coolsculpting technology. Last year, Soliton acknowledged working with an unnamed (for contractual reasons) “multi-billion dollar global aesthetics company” to test the combination of SOLY’s Rapid Acoustic Pulse technology with their technology. I don’t know that this is Allergan but I do know that Allergan and Zeltiq’s fingerprints are all over this company. For example, Brad Hauser is both an independent director at Soliton AND the current Vice President, R&D and General Manager for Coolsculpting at Allergan Pharmaceuticals. Prior to these roles, Mr. Hauser served as the Vice President of Research and Development at Zeltiq Aesthetics. Ms. Danika Harrison is another independent direct at Soliton and a former Senior Vice President of Global Marketing at Zeltiq Aesthetics. Soliton has an 8 member Science Advisory Board that includes 7 members that also sit on Allergan’s Medical Advisory Board."
"People should understand that it’s not actual but potential revenues that will move share price. If SOLY releases an early read on cellulite trial and update on keloid, which we could see as soon as the first weeks of December, volume and share price will move sharply. The company also mentioned no need for a cash raise until q3 2020 (barring they don’t find additional revenue potential indications for RAP - which would be net positive for shares). Also, if trials prove positive, capital for further development of RAP will likely come in the form of a buyout from a larger suitor."
"More good news to come. What we know will happen soon.- May 15-16 presentation.- Cellulite long term results.- Launch of Resonic to 25 key customers.- 1Q earnings release with detailed Highlights of 2020 and 2021.- Comments from doctors and customers about cellulite and tattoo removal.- 2Q earnings - not expected much but we should get a good idea of unit cost and cartridge cost. Plus more input from doctors and customers.- Keloid scar update and trial results.- Liver fibrosis update and trial results.- 3Q earnings with detailed comments from doctors and clients with detailed sales and earnings.Other updates I am looking for in 2021- Some new trials with potential indications for skin elasticity and other.- Advertising and marketing plan for cellulite and tattoo removal with detailed information on roll out.- Keloid scar roll-out.As you can read, Soliton has a lot of reasons to release news. This company has done everything it said it will do and the accuracy will continue. This is what you look for when investing in a company long term. Also the Innovative Technology will catch the attention of many long term investors."
Many are yet to see the potential of this company. An article like the one published is exactly what we’re looking for. Let’s go longs
We'll see $30 easy this year.
"Just curious, how many longs have shares that are in a Margin account?Cash account?Fully Paid Securities Lending Program?We can fight back against the short attack by changing your accounts to cash and not lending your shares through any program. It would be interesting to see what happens to the stock price if we all did it at the same time. I would guess over 1 million shares would need to be purchased and/or covered. The stock price moves on very small volume up and down. Who is in?"
Buy rating just issued by Maxim with a $22 price target.
Everthing is ready.Just waiting for FDA.
"Why do I accumulate and not day trade SOLY?SOLY has wild card... rev could grow over time as they role out...probably could day trade if that the path.BUT BUT with SOLY management past, contacts, space, and percentage owned by a few insiders ...you could go to sleep on Tuesday share price 17 and wake up Wednesday with shares price 50 because buy out offer negotiated."
"Over the weekend, I was looking at Soliton’s management team, the science advisory board and the independent directors. That’s an impressive group of individuals! However, one thing really jumped out at me and that was the groups attachment to the former Zeltiq Aesthetics. If you recall, Zeltiq was the company that developed Coolsculpting which was eventually sold to Allergan for $2.5 billion. Seven of the eight doctors on Soliton’s science advisory board were members of the Zeltiq medical advisory board. Two of the three independent directors at Soliton had big jobs at Zeltiq. In fact, Brad Hauser has served as the Vice President, R&D and General Manager for CoolSculpting at Allergan Pharmaceuticals since Zeltiq was acquired by Allergan and prior to that he served as the Senior Vice President of Research and Development at Zeltiq. There’s been a lot of chatter about the likelihood that Soliton will be bought out at some point by Allergan or another larger aesthetic company. Looking at the Soliton team, that’s essentially what they do! Co-founder and Executive chairman Walter Klemp dropped a big hint to this effect a couple of months ago when he talked about the Zeltiq experience. And for those of you that don’t know Mr Klemp, he has 30 yrs of experience building companies, developing and marketing therapeutic devices and drugs from concept through FDA approval and orchestrating mergers and acquisitions. The last thing I’m going to say is Soliton’s market cap is essentially 5% of what Allergan paid for Zeltiq to get its Coolsculpting technology. That’s A LOT of upside for Soliton investors moving forward!"
.....don’t be surprised if today is a sell the news event... I’m ready with more cash
"Soliton (NASDAQ:SOLY) is down 1.5% in light postmarket trading after a shareholder filing to offer shares.The filing registers just over 1M shares at a proposed maximum price of $10.24 each, setting up a $10.4M offering.The company won't receive any proceeds.Selling stockholders include Remeditex Ventures LLC, Vertical Holdings and ALS Investments LLC; after the offering, they would hold stakes of 53.5%, 1.8% and 2.5% respectivel"
There are now at least 6 law firms looking at the sale of Soliton to Abbvie. Does anyone know if this is typical with sales like this or if this is unusual and specific to this particular sale?
"Just a little first quarter of 2021 information on SOLY:Closing Price Dec 31, 2020 = $7.68Closing Price Jan 29, 2021 = $10.86 up 41.4%Closing Price Feb 26, 2021 = $13.28 up 22.28%Closing Price March 31, 2021 = $17.57 up 32.30%Second quarter is going to be epic!Go SOLY!"
"FDA approval why important? From marketing (paid by soly ) can say it works,safe!More importantly from third party ...bloggers, web, tv, magazines, etc.etc. That are hungry for content can do stories on SOLY and put their (law departments) at ease because it is FDA approved so a government agency has said it is safe and effective."
"Since the process for the tattoo indication has already been approved and approved quickly by the FDA, I would expect the approval for the cellulite indication to come very soon. It’s the same process!"
People really need to read that filing from yesterday. Look at the number of outstanding shares and who owns and do a little research. I find it curious that they did not announce any dilution to progress this company along and this was their chance. I expect that they may have another plan. Tuesday could be interesting
A positive early read on cellulite trial results will have a significant impact on share price from current levels. I suspect news coincides with making their large partnership public. Two strong catalysts. Patience may be rewarded in the next few weeks.
"I own 15k shares been here a long while, cost basis around 10.50....I saw it hit 18 ...do you know how many shares I sold......ZERO."
Last week we were talking when /if it would break through 15 and hold... no worries added more .
"HOUSTON, Oct. 10, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Soliton, Inc.

"I’m long SOLY with avg cost basis of $8.20. I’m holding for the big payday, but watching SP do it’s ups and downs is torturous. So many times I thought of trying to swing trade SOLY, looking back with hindsight could have easily doubled or nearly tripled the number of shares I hold with no additional capital, I wonder if others here felt that way. But the reason I never did was ‘What if THIS is the time SOLY doesn’t swing’. FOMO of the good things to come!"
"For our friends that may be getting a little twitchy to sell and take profits, this is a $50+ stock all day long so don’t lose track of that."
https://www.fiercebiotech.com/medtech/abbvie-s-allergan-aesthetics-faces-extended-ftc-probe-550m-soliton-acquisition. Interesting article over FTC and acquisition. Odd that FTC would have concerns about a new tech development from a anticompetitive standpoint. I can’t say I would be disappointed if this merger fell apart with this undisclosed support payments to the largest shareholder.
"Over 570,000 shares shorted yesterday. Over 420,000 shares naked shorted (shares not properly borrowed... in fact don't exist) yesterday. Google: naked short data. If this company is overpriced, why is the average analyst price target $18.67, why are the biggest shareholders (including a billionaire) not selling and why are the shorts working so hard to keep the price where it is? And, why all of the sudden do we have all these SOLY bashers?"
You know what the best part of today is? This stock is still way undervalued. Congrats SOLY longs.
So. Anyone have another gem to invest in? This was it for me. Gotta find something else now.
I added 1000 shares today 500 at 12.45 and 500 at 10.75. I believe in the people running this company.. looking into their record.. they have done this before and made their shareholders a solid profit! they have a plan.. gl all
"I listened to the conference call and was very pleased with what was presented. Although he referenced several times how limited he was in terms of providing info about the 510(k) application for cellulite reduction, it was clear to me that Klemp is very optimistic about getting clearance via the 510(k) pathway. More specifically, he said (I’m paraphrasing) having gotten to this point without a hard no, the probability of getting cleared via the 510(k) goes up dramatically. The other thing that Klemp mentioned that I had been unaware is that staff - and not just doctors - will be able to use the RAP to treat cellulite. This is a huge cost advantage. And lastly, Lori Bisson the executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer mentioned that adopters should be able to recoup their investment in the hardware with 1 year. I was both surprised and really impressed with this."
"In a recent animal study, Soliton’s Rapid Acoustic Pulse (RAP) technology has been demonstrated to reduce liver fibrosis by 42%. Given that the condition kills 2,000,000 people/year, what do you believe would be the impact on the company’s market cap IF the RAP can be demonstrated to reduce liver fibrosis in humans? For your consideration, the liver fibrosis market has been projected to become $25 billion/year WITHOUT a treatment that reduces liver fibrosis in humans."
This much potential deserves a market cap of $1 Billion plus
John I miss you buddy.
"@Michael, I think the issue stems from a comment made on the call that FDA has now come back and requested more information and it will take 4 to 6 weeks to respond then another 30 days or FDA decision"
Did anyone notice that they filed for a mixed shelf of up to $75M Friday after the close? Don't know how I missed that... helps to explain the selloff today...
Positive long-term cellulite results. The SOLY story just keeps getting better.
"Just visited the SOLY website -- AGAIN with hopes of finding any current news --- ZERO FOUND!!!As before May 12 2021 was the latest entry on either News - Press Releases - Investors SectionRidiculous that SOLY management has not made any type of statement since May 12!!!The should have released earnings info, and as most of us owning the stock are waiting for merger- buy out news - you would think they would care enough about their shareholders to at least say something - anything - even we do not have any news for you.SOLY management has done as poor a job of relating to -- caring for - their shareholders as any company I can remember over years of investing!! Did not like the selling of SOLY and especially the price - and now the no news from SOLY!!They should be ashamed, but caring so little as they have clearly shown for their shareholders, I am sure they are not!!! So, no news, no opinion except get this done and give me my money!!!"
"As hard as it is for some people to believe that SOLY may well get to $50+ some day, I'll share this personal example with you. A little more than two years ago, I bought some shares in this tiny internet tv startup in the low $30s, thinking that effective implementation of its business plan might get it to $100 or more some day. People on their message board at the time scoffed at the notion that the company would ever be successful, much less ever reach $100 and the shorts definitely controlled the stock price. In less than a year, the stock got all the way to $130, so I sold thinking I better not push my luck. I've purchased and sold the stock a few times since, almost always making money in the process. Fast forward to now and ROKU is at $450 and climbing. Now, I'm not saying that SOLY is the next ROKU. But, best in class technology, a large demand for the product/service offered, a smart, well connected and aggressive leadership team and execution of a solid business plan (and a very possible sale to a larger aesthetics company) can easily take this stock much higher than it is now and perhaps much higher than you even think it can get. So, unless I see something that materially changes this company's outlook, I'll be holding on to my shares for the foreseeable future."
As the word gets out about SOLY the investor base will expand and the Short market manipulation “Driving it down 8% on 50k shares” will be over.
"This is not just tax loss selling. It is shorts (you know, the folks that already have a 2 million share short position in a stock with a float of 10 million shares) trying to take out stop losses and get people to panic sell so they can begin closing out their short positions before the new year because they know when FDA approval is granted for cellulite treatment, they will be toast."
"Stock wise: What's REALLY sad is that this stock is being bought out at less than its all-time high of $29? Plus, I am not sure if the new owners will continue with the research to bring to market the liver fibrous component of RAP? (That will be very sad!!!)"
"Hello everyone. I sadly sold all my shares, couldn’t wait any more. Thanks to all longs that gave me the strength to hold till now. Will miss you guys."
Added1k shares
"They did mention at the meeting the market potential of of all products. Tattoo, cellulite, keloids scar, plus 1 or 2 others they are working on. That number is $20 billion in market potential.I wonder what percentage of market share that equals."
"When I see drops like this on no news and on such low volume, it represents a time to add. Added 1k shares at 17.05. Potentially huge news from this company could come at any time."
Someone’s accumulating in small lots to try and limit upside. This is going much higher.
Hi SOLY Longs. I've been holding this stock for more than a year now. I'm very happy to see we're gaining momentum not only in commercial launch but as well as the stock price. I strongly believe we will catch up to INMD's stock before end of year. GL to all who held on through the pandemic!
This is the only stock I will hold during a market correction. Cost basis is low enough and only good news ahead.
"Well folks, the day is finally here... Been waiting for the cellulite trial results since mid-2019. Although it has been a long wait, I’m sure it will be well worth it. Cheers to all my SOLY longs who have had the patience to stick around. Let’s have a day!"
"A couple of years ago, Allergan purchased Zeltiq Aesthetics for $2.48 billion or $56.50/share. With less shares than Zeltiq, if soliton was to be sold and generate the same type of money, the stock price would be $142/share or over 900% from the current price. Food for thought....."
"Chris, good list. Buy you've left off the very biggest of future for this company in addressing what are currently inadequately met needs: 1) Scarring as the result of Breast Cancer and Breast Augmentation surgery. Can you imagine how this new approach would revolutionize THAT experience? (painless)2) FROZEN SHOULDER (scar tissue in and around the shoulder joint) aka ""Adhesive Encapsultis"" FYI it affects 2-5% of the 320 million people living in the US: https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frozen-shoulder-adhesive-capsulitis3) Peyronies Disease: No one likes to talk about it, but this condition may affect up to 23% of all men over 45! https://apexhealthcenter.com/peyronies-disease-statistics/4) Cirrosis of the Liver. Simply stated, cirrosis means scarring, and that is precisely what RAP technology was developed to address. About 1 in 200 adults ages 45 to 54 in the United States has cirrhosis. Researchers believe the actual numbers may be higher because many people with cirrhosis are not diagnosed. It is currently considered to be irreversable with a high mortality rate.This is just a beginning. The list of unmet medical need far exceeds the cosmetic one and the combined current costs can only be measured in the 10's of BILLIONS (my estimate, most likely much more!)Each of these categories represents billions, but safety and efficacy studies are required first and that is an expensive proposition. SO, it's one step at a time, with each indication financing the studies for the next. In my view, Klemp and Company have saved the best for last!BUY SOLY. BUY IT AND HOLD IT. It has far greater reach than ""cool sculpting"" ever could and as stated, that company sold out to Allergan for 2.4 billionFor the record, I am not an investment advisor and the opinions expressed here are ""SOLY"" my own!"
Just wait until the MSM runs a story on this
Why is stock down. Wow. This should be at least $15. Good luck.
The company has a unique new technology that will almost certainly give them a foothold in several multi billion markets and the stock can’t hold $15. It’ll almost certainly be double or triple this value in the late Winter or early Spring but it doesn’t seem to matter. Very strange.
"There’s always been a lot of talk of a buyout with this company. While I have always agreed that this is almost certainly going to happen, I thought it wouldn’t be for a while to allow SOLY to get its products to market, generate some revenue and increase the stock value (much like Zeltiq did before it was acquired). However, this delay in filing the 510(k) has me sort of second guessing this. SOLY has been sitting on the tremendous cellulite pivotal trial results for months. In that time, they’d almost certainly have prepared the 510(k) application and it would certainly be ready to go. So then why would the company not file the application while the stock took a three day nose dive? For me, the most likely answer is that they are in the middle of something with another company like the $171 billion AbbVie which already owns the Coolsculpting which is a excellent complement to SOLY’s RAP process on cellulite."
"So the stock gets wacked in the last 10 minutes of trade and then a bulk trade for about 140k shares goes off right at the close at $7.66, the exact closing price... does anyone else smell price manipulation? There must have been a prearranged bulk sale at today's closing price, whatever that happened to be, maybe with the underwriter of the secondary offering? Whatever it is, it's total manipulation!"
Added more.
27% reduction from a single painless treatment is magic
bought more at 10.67. patience will pay off
"Without fuel, even the very best and most efficient gasoline powered cars will eventually run out of gas and stall out. This is much the same with a pre revenue company like Soliton except the fuel is not gasoline, it’s news. And while it would be fabulous if the old news would draw in new investors, new money and keep the stock price up, that’s not how that works and the ultra low volume that we’ve been seeing lately is a clear indication of this. So my ask to SOLY management is give us something that will get eyes on this company and this stock, help generate some interest in the market and get this thing turned around!"
The MC is less than 400M and still has a long way to go. When they get bought out it will be a minimum of $2B (~$100/share). It will happen so just buy and hold.
"Let's breakdown this manipulated, fake fright fest the crooks have unleashed.If there was real concern.the volume would be 10 times higher. There are few if any buyers (except me).At 20.25, there is an 11.8% return, which could be realized any day...very likely within the next 3 months. Not gonna find that anywhere else.If the deal falls through, the downside is about $3-5, based on pre-takeover price, and the overwhelming disappointment in the $22.60 bargain basement price.Risk/reward is what the market is all about. This is worth it."
"It’s easy to get caught up in the details in forums like this and perhaps lose track of the big picture so I thought it might be useful at this point to remind everyone why we’re here or at least why I’m here. When the RAP is cleared, Soliton will have the only product in the world that severs the fibrous septae that causes cellulite and does it without piercing the skin. There are no others, it’ll be one of one. So if you think that women might appreciate a device that greatly improves the appearance of cellulite by addressing the cause of cellulite with no down time, no anesthesia, no bruising, no swelling, no bleeding and relatively no pain, please bid accordingly."
I did not sell. I am still in shock as to the lowball buyout. Am I too emotional? Stubborn?

"RESONIC is truly a breakthrough technology with the potential to revolutionize the aesthetics market, and Capital Laser & Skin Care could not be more excited to be one of the FIRST in the world to make it available to their patients......Capital Laser and Skin Care."
"Brad Hauser is an independent board member at Soliton. Brad is also the Vice President of Sales and Marketing at Allergan, the company that owns Coolsculpting. And before that, Brad has been the Vice President, R&D and General Manager at Zeltiq, the company that developed Coolsculpting and was sold to Allergan. Coolsculpting for fat reduction and Rapid Acoustic Pulse (RAP) technology for cellulite are an obvious partnership. This is like a really easy puzzle with a handful of great big pieces....."
"If you are long this stock, do yourself a big favor and make sure the shares are held in a cash account and with no Fully Paid Lending Program in place. Short sellers cant short your shares if in a cash account. If you have the shares in a margin account, your brokerage is most likely lending your shares out and making a lot of money as the lending rate per Fintel is 3.19%."

"315k shares traded short yesterday alone. My oh my, it’s going to be an explosion on approval day."
"David nothing has changed with the exception that I bought more shares at 11.50 . Doesn’t phase me at all.Buy in cash and hold until company allowed to do what it is designed to do.IN 12 -24 months will be new crop of Shorts and Longs agrueing why SOLY not worth price which will be $50 based on how they rolling out devices , structuring revenue streams, co-branding...etc.Have been here many times before and have always made money."
"In 2017 Allergan bought Zeltiq Aesthetics and its Coolsculpting technology for $2.475 billion or $56.50/share. At the time, Zeltiq had almost three times as many shares (43,805,000) as Soliton does now (15,000,000). At the same sell price, Soliton shareholders would receive $165/share. Soliton is currently $10.46/share."
Great news coming this week!!!
"January 27, 2020 | Houston, TX | Soliton, Inc. (NASDAQ: SOLY), a medical device company with a novel and proprietary platform technology licensed from The University of Texas on behalf of the MD Anderson Cancer Center (“MD Anderson”), today announced positive proof-of-concept (POC) study results out to 12 weeks using its Rapid Acoustic Pulse (RAP) Device for the treatment of fibrotic (keloid and hypertrophic) scars. “We were excited to share the 12-week follow-up results at this key dermatology conference, amongst some of the top physicians in this field,” stated Christopher Capelli, MD, founder, President and CEO of Soliton. “The clinical results clearly demonstrate that an overall average reduction in both the volume of the scars and the height of the scars at the 12-week follow-up after the intial single 6-minute treatment is continuing without the need for further dosing. We are very encouraged by these positive results that further substantiate the merit of our RAP device and look forward to continuing the development and enhancement of its clinical program.” The data was presented in the abstract, “Volume And Height Reduction of Fibrotic Scars Shown With 3D Imaging 12 Weeks After Non-Invasive Treatment With a Rapid Acoustic Pulse (RAP) Device In a Proof Of Concept Study” at the Maui Derm for Dermatologists 2020 meeting. The objective of this single-site POC IRB-approved human clinical study was to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of the RAP device for the temporary improvement in the appearance of fibrotic scars. A single 6-minute RAP session was used to treat 11 fibrotic scars in 10 participants. Images were analyzed using proprietary software for changes in scar volume and height from pretreatment to the 12 week follow-up. 3D scar assessment of the pre- and post-treatment photographs of 11 treated scars demonstrated an average reduction in volume of 29.6% (p<0.01) and an average reduction in height of 14.6% (p<0.005). While the 12 week data represents an improvement in volume reduction over the 6 week volume reductions of 27% previously announced, this was without any additional treatment, suggesting that the scars continued to improve over time. This continued improvement from a single treatment is especially important as keloid scars are prone to recurrence after treatment with existing therapies. Patients treated with steroid injections see recurrence rates as high as 50%, while patients treated with a chemotherapeutic agent have recurrence rates as high as 47%. Overall, the treatment of fibrotic scars using the RAP device proved safe and tolerable during this POC study. Follow up results at 12 weeks demonstrate that the RAP device provides significant improvements in the appearance of fibrotic scars from a single 6-minute noninvasive treatment, with minimal pain, and most patients express satisfaction with the scar improvement. Grand View Research estimates the global market for keloid and hypertrophic scars may reach $10.2 billion by 2025."
"Just a reminder, keep your shares in a cash account and cancel any Fully Paid Lending Program. Do not let the shorts push the stock price down. SOLY has some very big news announcements coming soon and the long term stock holders can stop shorts. Also, over half of the outstanding shares are held by insiders and/or restricted. This puts the float around 10.5 million shares. The longs have the opportunity to tighten up that float by removing your shares from shorts and you do this by holding shares in cash account with no FPL program. Long term holders and investors can significantly shrink the float and should take this very seriously. Hold long and strong."
"Shorts, thanks for the additional 2000 shares at $16.5. I'll take good care of them."
"The 5, 20, 50, 100 and 200 day moving averages are all green again."
"Not sure if short sellers are pushing it lower because of the 30 days or less needed to review the additional requested information or is it longs selling because they are impatient. Either way, new investors have a chance to make $1.30 per share or about 5% on an investment in the stock at today's price."
So what didn't the market like about the new released this morning?
"Can anyone confirm that Remeditex bought an additional $9,450,000 worth of shares on June 17th?"
"InMode did it’s IPO in August 2019 and it was priced at $14/share. Today InMode is $70/share which represents a market cap of $2.65 billion on $206 million in revenue. If you think that Soliton can do this type of revenue, then you know now know how the market values this and you’ll understand the opportunity that is available here with SOLY."
I have been buying SOLY as it has been going down from 16 to 10 but now am wondering if that’s the right strategy. When would you expect a run up?
"I got out the same day the announced this horrible deal. I took my profit and walked away. Yet, I truly wish this deal doesn't go through. It felt like a rip-off for those who put their money on this promising company."
"Listened to the quarterly call and everything continues on track. Planned rollout to 25 sites, and device will be sold and booked as revenue, likely all in Q2. Sites offer mix of either cellulite and tattoo removal, some exclusively tattoo (high volume). They test and learn on approximately 1000 patients, and use this to fine tune/calibrate their offering for full blown commercial launch in 2022. Results also used to broaden out marketing. Wouldn't be surprised if a few celebrities are clients. My two cents... if results are successful, news will leak, word will spread across the aesthetics community, and this likely gets bought sooner than most people think. The other alternative, an established medical equipment co. takes a large equity position to hedge their bets. Question was raised on whether devices could be manufactured to keep up with demand. Response was this is a non-issue. They appear more focused on training and the customer experience. More reason to believe a large company would come in, leverage their sales staff, and reap huge economies quickly. Should be an interesting year."

worth at least $50
"Just a few days before the secondary (offered at $8.30), SOLY was trading in the $14-15 range.How many here expect it go that range after the approval?"
"SOLY 4Q came in at 22 cent loss, one cent better than estimate. Reiterated has adequate funding to 3Q 2022."
Eventually soly will break loose from the shorters like Roku did. Then the sky's the limit. Or a larger medical company will come along and buy up SOLY.
I feel sick to my stomach. I will participate in a class action. If you are an attorney please reach out to me. I have 50K shares and the amount they sold for is criminal. The company left huge amounts of money on the table and the shareholders got ripped off. A $1 billion market cap sale should have been the very minimal price.. I am literally out $3.75 million because of managements decision to sell.
"Contemplating either joining a class action law suit (if any), or go alone suing Soliton!!!"
What's happening here? Market maker games or legit concerns?21.31-22.60 is a free 5%? What am I missing?
Remeditex continues buying shares to remain the controlling holder of SOLY. They'll negotiate sale to a larger medical aesthetics company at multiples of their average buy price. A straight-forward execution plan to - develop - market - sell.
"To the moon, finally we have all been waiting for. Patience is key!"

"John,Sixty percent of SOLY shares are held by institutional investors. IF the ""big guys"" were cashing out then volume would be more than 100,000 shares a day."
"Many of you have commented about SOLY needing to ""get the word out"" about their technology and its imminent commercialization. I fully agree. Today is a big step in that direction with the Cantor Fitzgerald investor conference call. As word gets out, more individual and institutional investors will choose to invest in this company."

"Today was a day (a good one for sure) but not ""THE"" day. ""THE"" day is when SOLY jumps three or four dollars a share (at least) and has over a million shares traded. THAT is the day people who know little or nothing about SOLY will want to jump on board, the shorts will start covering and wished they hadn't heard of SOLY and will become the base point for higher stock price closes."
"Spoke to a girl getting a tattoo removed today. Said she and SO MANY were waiting on Soliton, but the removal places said they can be done before approval comes around. She isn't happy."
Placed an order for 2500 shares at $10 and got filled on 1500 of them... thank you very much!
yah it won't cost anything to hold and see if something happens...I won't vote for this price
Added 2000 shares
"Interesting to hear some people speak about dilution. The company will need to issue shares, but the past shows they issue very small amounts. Over the last year, they have only issued around 2,000,000 shares outstanding.2018 10K shows 14,613,0002019 10K shows 16,932,184I think any new dilution will be around 1 million shares and as the price moves higher the amount of shares will be less. The company is in a great position and the cellulite news on March 21 just adds potential of more favorable terms."
"This is exactly why I don't try to time the market with the vast majority of my holdings. The reality is that I (we) don't know exactly when something is going to pop and if you truly believe in the company you are invested in, you buy and hold until the fundamentals change."
"The equity market is strange! Based on particular information, this stock rolls up to over $21. Absolutely nothing changes with respect to the very same information and the stocks rolls back to $10."
No volume... again.Why no interest after such an important announcement and milestone?
That straight line for hours is not natural or normal with over 200k shares traded thus far.

"We have a double bottom = yesterdays bottom was 11.18 and todays bottom was 11.50 so 11.50 is the NEW support. However we need to remember that yesterday was the worst day of all of 2019 for the markets, so it may take a few days for people to see that SOLY has formed a double bottom. We ARE off to a slow start but gibe SOLY time and the volumes will pick up."
"Zeltiq Aesthetics (ZLTQ) and it’s Coolsculpting technology is often referenced as an example of what could happen with Soliton (SOLY) and the Rapid Acoustic Pulse technology. However, looking at the ZLTQ chart, you notice a HUGE difference between the two stocks. Where as the ZLTQ stock spent two years well below its IPO price, SOLY has been as high as +600% and never below its IPO price. In other words, although it might not feel like it, the market has been much more enthusiastic about SOLY than it had been about ZLTQ which was eventually sold to Allergan for $2.48 billion."
I feel like I'm in the dessert looking at a mirage of palm trees and water... are we actually green when the rest of the market is deep in the red?? Please tell me I'm not dreaming!
Investors business daily article states that Abbvie's future success is tied to it's aqquisition of Allergen and it's aesthetics business. Hmmm! Can you say Soliton to the rescue! BooYaa!
Would love to know what’s taking the FTC so long on this deal. Should be pretty straightforward unless COVID has them understaffed and operating at a much slower pace. There doesn’t appear to be anything that would raise anti-trust issues in a deal like this. Very interesting to watch . . .
"Remeditex is a venture capital firm that invests in high quality, innovative, early stage projects. Currently it has $74,348,614 invested in three companies: Soliton Inc., Miragen Therapeutics and Apollo Endosurgery. Very interesting is the fact that Remeditex’s investment in Soliton represents 93.5% of the total investment. I highlight this here because I would think it would be very unusual for a venture capital firm to essentially go all in on a single pre revenue company. That is unless they know something that we don’t......"

Longs waiting for quick buy out to cash in ...have a problem ( good problem) to have.SOLY creators do not want to leave money on table especially when we talking Billions.Tattoo - works FDA approvalCellulite - works FDA approvalIf story stopped there buy out would be in the bag ...BUTSOLY actively working to see if it works for keloid scars...that a multi billion dollar industry.If it does then tedious FDA approval begins ...wait there is more if it works and gets approved for Keloid scar ....what about internal scaring ....much harder to treat....BUT very small improvements make huge difference. If SOLY go down this road ...$100 share price would be laughable.So sit back and ask yourself do you want to buy a Porsche with your SOLY profits or a Ferrari .
"“We discovered in preclinical testing that our patented technology (RAP) may have the potential to blast apart fat cells which we believe could make today’s most popular fat reduction technologies even more effective.This new discovery caught the attention of a multi billion dollar aesthetics company. Since then we’ve begun a collaboration trial with them using Soliton’s RAP to potentially accelerate that company’s fat reduction device. If Soliton’s RAP improves their fat reduction technology, this could form the basis for an important strategic relationship.”........Walter Klemp, Co-Founder and Executive Chairman, Soliton, Inc."
My gut feeling is the deal will close in the next few weeks since the insiders have too much in it. Anyone know if there is a way to check FTC on the detail of the 2nd request and on company's response? And to find out when the company has 'substantially' answer the 2nd request?
"I have seen a whole lot of negative talk about soly on here lately, and I really wanted to point out a few things. 1: There are still 3 major indications yet to be released (Scar, Cellulite, Fibrotic disorders) and that when they are this stock will have its day assuming the assumption of it working is a true one. 2: Looking at most of the Biotech tickers we are envious of, most of them had a long and brutal period of poor volume and a dithering price, this is not something to feel doomed about. 3: this is a funded venture! at least for the time being, and as it stands has one of the largest potentials for growth with the tattoo device already approved. As far as im concerned this is not an if but when, and all of the slowness now wont mean a thing in 3 months."
It’s interesting the volume is not rocketing but the price is??? Good days are ahead for this company.
I’ve been on this stock for just less than 2 yrs so I can confirm that today’s price action is very unusual. I’m speculating that the company will disclose positive news either today after hrs or in the morning.
LTG was named an Agency of the Year in the PR industry in 2019
"Management can’t do what they did with that offering, put the $35,000,000 in the bank and then just sit on their hands. I had been very impressed with the management up until this point but clearly they aren’t getting it."
Congrats to the shorts. They brought it back from 30% up premarket. Not surprising. No change to my long thesis. I’m holding and sleeping well. Good things coming.
"Some of you probably got this from Soliton in the mail today; ""We went public back in February of 2019 and since then has never been in a better position than it is right now, both financially and scientifically. Learn about the top 10 things that we have accomplished since our IPO and what we have planned for the future by visiting: "".

Maxim gave a target price of $25.
The float on Soly is also low at 10 million....At some point in the near future soly will announce orders. Perspective companies were waiting for FDA clearance. This standard practice. let the games begin.
"I wanted to comment on some of the discussions below about the Soliton business model. I'm in the medspa industry myself which initially attracted me to this stock, as there are no effective cellulite treatments currently on the market, although there are companies selling equipment for this which doesn't do much and is very painful for the patient. At the same time, it is definitely one of the most common questions from women - ""do you have anything that treats cellulite?"" We also have CoolSculpting equipment and Soliton's business model should be pretty similar to that. I actually called their investor relations last year to ask some questions about it, as we're very interested in being on their short list to get the equipment in their initial limited launch. The person I spoke with confirmed that much and also told me that they're working on making the tattoo removal and cellulite treatment part of the same machine with interchangeable attachments to treat each of the above.The CoolSculpting business model is as follows (give or take a few dollars):- Initial investment on the part of the service provider is about $150k for a single machine or $250k - 280K for two machines. The reason for two machines is to be able to perform ""dual treatments"" which go much quicker and is more appealing to the patient (e.g. having both arms or thighs treated at once instead of one than the other). I would say that at least half if not most of the providers end up purchasing two machines since just one would be a disadvantage in the very competitive market (you don't want to have just one when the medspa or derm down the street has two). I would imagine a similar approach for Soliton, since it's based on a very similar treatment protocol. By the way, this price is to purchase the equipment (usually financed through a third party) and I don't think that leasing is even an option.- After the initial sale is made, the money from the providers really starts to roll in for Allergen from the providers, since each treatment cycle costs on average about $150 to purchase, which is then typically marked up to between $600 - $750 by the provider. If an average woman, not particularly heavy, wants to have her midsection treated, it usually takes between 6 and 10 cycles for the FIRST round. The second round is performed about 3 months later, is optional, and is usually discounted a bit further. Many also buy both rounds upfront, forking over about $8k - 15k to ONLY treat one area of their body. Allergen then collects about $2000 - $3500 from the provider. Oh and they also charge additionally for the provider to purchase additional applicators (attachments) for the different body parts, which are several thousand each.So this is a pretty lucrative business model, as each ""treatment cycle"" is just a computer chip that allows the machine to perform its task. There's barely any additional cost to Allergen for these chips. In addition, they also charge for insurance on the machines, etc. They do offer certain discounts and incentives to the providers, but all in all, these sort of machines are major cash cows!I don't know what this stock is going to do until the commercial rollout, but the management team would really have to fumble the launch for the cash flow growth to not take off quickly. The only thing that will hold them back is their ability to manufacture and support enough of this equipment. Demand on the part of providers and consumers will be through the roof! And I'm not even mentioning tattoo removal and keloid scars, and for whatever else they may discover RAP is effective. Over the next few years this should be a huge winner!"
"""We are excited to reveal our pointed and powerful marketing strategy... and fuel sustainable growth we believe will support long-term shareholder value."" ⁃ Dr. Chris Capelli, Soliton President, CEO and co-founder in last Press Release"
Well looks like soly is still being the same.You know what waiting for FDA approval is great but and I'm not kidding with tat removal alone should boost solys price at least 5 times IMO.Although cellulite is a nice advancement we are still going to do quite nicely with soly.So let's stop stressing over FDA approval and wait for sales on tat removal.Soly Strong
"They can manipulate this all day long, I’m not selling a single share anytime soon"
"Plug power was $2.00 last year, now over $70.00 I hoping ""Soly"" does same thing. Chances are Soly will sky rocket. Can anyone say triple digits? We can all hope."

"Bottom line, the SEC should investigate the trading activity by parties involved, including Allergan, AbbVie and insiders at Soliton."
"MM/Shorts are creating panic with the latest S-1 because they know lot of people with lack of ability to understand S-1 are here. Adding rumors saying there are additional shares being issued. First of all, you guys need to read the original financing news properly and co-relate to the S-1 filing.Here is the original announcement:Soliton will sell an aggregate of 675,000 shares of the Company's common stock at $14.00 per share. Each share will be sold together with a warrant to purchase 0.7 shares of common stock. Each warrant has an exercise price of $16.00 per share. Total shares to be issued = 675,000 + (675,000 * 0.7) = 675,000 + 472500 = 1147500 (You will see this number in latest S-1)Shares 675,000 are at $14 Shares 472500 are at $16Average price of all shares 1147500 = $14.72 This is exactly matching in original announcement and latest S-1 filing. What is there to confuse?"
"I expect the size of the large and growing tattoo removal market is severely constrained and I believe Soliton is uniquely positioned to help leverage this mostly untapped market. More specifically, there is information that more than 75% of people with tattoos in the US would like to have one or more of their tattoos removed but only 11% actually follow through and have a tattoo(s) removed. If that’s accurate, it would mean that 64% of Americans with tattoos would like to have a tattoo(s) removed but have not followed through. That represents a lot of people and a tremendous opportunity for a new product like Soliton’s RAP that can dramatically improve the extremely unpleasant laser only process by making it much, much faster (2-3 applications with laser & RAP vs. 10-12 applications with laser only)."
"Fellow soly longs I am sorry I have done you a disservice ...I have told you that with tat, cellulite , and scar the promise land would be 100. I did not know about liver fibrosis....that means it works internally on scaring ,,it is painless , safe, noninvasive,...The promise land is now 250 +...I am sorry I let you down."
"The float in this is so small, the number of shares short and 60% of shares are locked up....any really big news could send this sky high"
"I think a lot of people were hesitant to jump in on yesterdays results because of the way SOLY has dropped in the past on news, but staying in the green yesterday was huge. In my opinion the results were nothing short of spectacular and this will soon become a household name and the gold standard in cellulite treatment. I expect to see more investors jumping in today and in the days / weeks to come, driving the price up as awareness spreads. Need our marketing firm (Tailfin) that we hired back in December to start getting the word out."
The primary endpoint was to establish safety and tolerability of RAP. That was achieved. I think folks are missing the point!!!
"Not sure about most here, but I'd LOVE to see the deal collapse. I didn't buy in for just a double plus."
"For those that haven't checked out the Resonic web site yet, I attach the link: https://www.resonic.com/.It is full of good information, including pictures and videos. As more practices obtain the Resonic equipment, the practice locator will be updated. Treatment pricing will be determined by each practice. However, Soliton last year provided information on the competitive pricing of cellulite treatment technologies. This presentation indicates an expected price for SOLY's technology (Resonic) of $2500 per session. This compares favorably to Emtone, Cellfina and Cellulaze, which range in price from $3100 to $5775. Obviously, this doesn't tell us the pricing for the Resonic device or individual cartridges. We will need more information to accurately estimate these costs but does provide some framework to work with. I didn't see any cost comparison information on tattoo removal but it is safe to say it will be less expensive than laser alone since number of required treatments is greatly reduced."
"HOUSTON, Aug. 29, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Soliton, Inc., (Nasdaq: SOLY) (""Soliton"" or the ""Company""), a medical device company with a novel and proprietary platform technology licensed from The University of Texas on behalf of the MD Anderson Cancer Center (""MD Anderson""), today announced that it is planning a proof of concept (POC) clinical trial for the use of its RAP technology for the treatment of keloid and hypertrophic scars.￼Keloid and hypertrophic scars represent wound healing gone awry. A typical example would be a post-surgical scar that grows beyond its boundaries. Existing published research suggests that factors relating to the wound-healing environment (including tension at the boundary of the scar) can cause fibroblasts to become stuck in a hyper-productive loop, unable to stop the production of collagen that leads to the thickened, raised and dense structures often associated with these fibrotic scars. The American Osteopathic College of Dermatology estimate that keloids affect around 10 percent of people, whereas hypertrophic scars are more common. Keloid scars a more prevalent among populations with darker pigmentation. Hypertrophic scars affect men and women from any racial group equally, although people between the ages of 10 and 30 years old are more likely to be affected.Grand View Research estimates the global market for keloid and hypertrophic scars may reach $10.2 billion by 2025. There are few treatment options available for fibrotic scars, which in addition to being disfiguring, can also cause significant discomfort. Current treatment methods include surgical excision of the scar of corticosteroid injections, laser treatment or cryotherapy. Some patients even receive radiation to help prevent the return of the scar. The most common treatment is the direct injection of steroids into the scar, however this can require multiple injections and may not be a permanent solution.Join our more than 200K fans here to follow the Company: https://soly-investors.com""Our preclinical studies combined with published literature on the behavior of fibrotic tissue have suggested that our acoustic shockwaves may be capable of disrupting stiff, sclerotic structures created by unwanted fibrosis, of which keloids and hypertrophic scars are just one example. Beyond this, we may also be able to help reset the targeted tissue to more normal fibroblast activity for lasting effects,"" said Dr. Chris Capelli, CEO, President and Co-founder.The Company's device for use as an accessory to a 1064 Q switch laser for tattoo removal was cleared on May 24, 2019, however technology for the treatment of cellulite and fibrotic scars is investigational and not available for sale in the United States. Soliton will file additional 510(k) applications for the use of RAP technology in these indications."
It's time to surpass 15.
"I am always looking for ‘tells’ to help with investment decisions. During a recent virtual course on laser and aesthetic skin therapy covered by MDedge, Dr. Omar Ibrahimi, Founding Medical Director at the Connecticut Skin Institute mentioned Soliton and said he anticipates that RAP device will make a “significant impact” in the field of tattoo removal. But more importantly was that he identified the fact that he owns stock in Soliton. For me, that’s the gold standard – when an expert in the field puts his/her own money in the stock because they see what the company is bringing to the table and they know the potential."

"A couple thoughts... even with large buys from Sio Capital and Monashee from the capital raise, we still don’t know the largest buyer of shares. Either shares were bought and held in inventory by the underwriters or a big name investor could be released soon. Second, the news to use Aesthetics Solutions for distribution gives more weight SOLY will be looking to sell if/when the opportunity makes itself available."
"574,000 shares of SOLY were shorted in the last two trading days that’s why the dip. 287,000 of these shares were naked short shares (shares that weren’t properly borrowed)."
What's going on? I bailed a few days after announcement and it held $22.32 to $22.55 for months.Why down to $20??Maybe it's not working that great and word got out?
"Patience, faith and I’m not selling a single share anytime soon."
"Some posts on the site amuse me. Attempting to know when it's appropriate to value a company at 7x sales is a guessing game. SOLY's plan is to sell well before its full potential materializes. Remeditex, Klemp, Capelli, and now Hauser have a price target in mind that would satisfy both their egos and pocketbooks, and my bet is they pull the trigger if the rollout is successful this year. So, to those who say you need 150mm in realised sales to get a 1B market cap I disagree. If there's ample evidence in the product, receptivity, the ability to deliver and execute, share price will be determined by a probable forecast of future sales for cleared indications, and incremental sales for promising indications yet to be cleared. The three primary unknowns here are the success of execution (this year), ultimate size of these markets (which I suspect are larger than currently estimated when safety is a non issue), and demand for yet to be cleared indications. Throw in the excess liquidity we currently have today with relatively low market rates. If a suitor were to project the company captures 5% of these markets with growth rates at mid double digits for several years thereafter, and finally determines this could be uniquely differentiated from competing products we're not even close to getting it right on valuation. Many pre-revenue companies have been sold for large dollar premiums based on potential sales, and this will be no different. Why a successful rollout will bring the herd, and they'll be chasing your shares. Barring no systemic event this will be in the high 20s/low30s before quarter end."
"If you believe the deal goes through, 13% return is guaranteed."
"Currently, the tattoo removal market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 12.7% through 2023 and reach $27.3 billion. The market is currently dominated by laser and surgical solutions, primarily in the North American region, which acts as the natural cost barrier for a wider spread adoption of the removal of tattoos. This means that a cheaper and less invasive solution will create a more wide-spread increase in demand for the service. Laser removal takes about 10 sessions because of damage which is done to the skin with more than 2 or 3 passes with the laser alongside the fact that traditional laser solutions don't get to the lower surfaces of the skin, which leaves traces of the tattoo. Soliton's solution, after using a lower-powered laser to break up the initial layer of ink, not only gets to all the levels of ink within the skin but also can do multiple passes on the skin without damage, so the entire tattoo can be removed in only 2-3 sessions (compared to the 10 needed for laser removal)"
"What has been clearly demonstrated today is that regardless of news, short sellers control this stock 100%. Makes me angry."
Going thru $16 tomorrow... 
"HOUSTON, Oct. 1, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Soliton, Inc., (Nasdaq: SOLY) (""Soliton"" or the ""Company""), a medical device company with a novel and proprietary platform technology licensed from The University of Texas on behalf of the MD Anderson Cancer Center (""MD Anderson""), today announced it has completed all patient treatments in the keloid scar proof-of-concept trial. Join our more than 200K fans here to follow the Company: https://soly-investors.comThe study, conducted by Dr. Brenda LaTowsky, Board Certified Dermatologist at Clear Dermatology & Aesthetic Center in Scottsdale, AZ, was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy for all patients through a 12-week time point. The study will monitor and track the progress of the results at both the 6-week and 12-week timepoints from initial treatment in order to evaluate both the near-term and continued longer-term effects.Dr. Chris Capelli, President, CEO and co-founder of Soliton, commented, ""We eagerly anticipate the follow-up visits with these patients. Demonstrating success in this trial would lay a foundation for Soliton to pursue treatment for many other fibrotic disorders.""Keloid and hypertrophic scars represent wound healing gone awry. A typical example would be a post-surgical scar that grows beyond its boundaries. Existing published research suggests that factors relating to the wound-healing environment (including tension at the boundary of the scar) can cause fibroblasts to become stuck in a hyper-productive loop, unable to stop the production of collagen that leads to the thickened, raised and dense structures often associated with these fibrotic scars. The American Osteopathic College of Dermatology estimates that keloids affect around 10 percent of people, whereas hypertrophic scars are more common. Keloid scars are more prevalent among populations with darker pigmentation. Hypertrophic scars affect men and women from any racial group equally, although people between the ages of 10 and 30 years old are more likely to be affected.Market Research Futures estimates the global market for keloid and hypertrophic scars may reach $3.9 billion by 2023. There are few treatment options available for fibrotic scars, which in addition to being disfiguring, can also cause significant discomfort. Currently, the most common treatment is the direct injection of steroids into the scar, however this can require multiple injections and may not be a permanent solution."
2 FDA approvals for two separate multi billion dollar markets Tatto and cellulite with potential for scar treatment another multi billion dollar market??? Do the math ...say SOLY captures 25 Percent (way low) of the current market that puts them easily in Billion dollar range. Basic math.
"If FTC blocks the merger with Abbvie, then who will/can/should buy SOLY?At what price?"
$15 2 weeks ago.is it a buy?
"Ok ..now back to normal..goes up $3 on 800,000shares and will go $2 on 80000 shares.Institution accumulated what they want...see you at $100"
"When it goes to market, Soliton’s Rapid Acoustic Pulse will be the only single application, noninvasive, long lasting and effective cellulite treatment on the market. In a $4 billion and growing market, it will be one of one."
"Big announcement this morning with the appointment of former Allergan exec in charge of Coolsculpting, Brad Hauser, as the new CEO of SOLY. Good time to add."
"Sometime between now and very early next year, three things are going to happen that cumulatively will launch Soliton’s stock into the stratosphere: it will announce positive results from it’s Keloid POC Clinical Study, it will submit an application to the FDA for the Cellulite Indication and it will go to market with the Tattoo Removal Indication. I would shocked if this isn’t a $50 stock by Q3 next year."
I did not get a chance to invest in to any of the ARK Innovation Funds or ETF's. From what I understand is they seek out and invest in companies with unique and innovating technologies. Does RAP technology qualify?
This should be investigated
shouldn't this be trading near $14? where the private placement will be?
"My expectation is RAP technology receives the validation many of the longs on this site have been waiting for in the next few weeks. The vicissitudes of short term traders will only work to support those that believe in the technology. Funny that a couple of institutional investors who participated in the offering back in July have already moved on (e.g. Monashee). Fast money investors without patience or foresight cashing in on small dollar moves will likely regret not holding their sizeable positions. Many people have speculated on potential upside after the approval of the cellulite. After giving it some thought, I suspect the run will be larger than many imagine. Even with the issue of new shares this past year, a second indication, and as I mentioned further validation of the technology are catalysts because of unknown potential. They'll have created a baseline. What that baseline is in the minds of investors we'll come to see shortly. To say 29/share reached when tattoo was approved fails to consider all recent developments in their calculation. I'll throw this out there, and it's only a prediction. This will likely move to 11 or 12/share in the next week or two just before the announcement. Shorts and fast money will have trouble figuring this one out. If the announcement is positive they will have a couple halts in trading to balance out supply and demand levels at the higher price. Three to four times current price puts the company at a market cap of around 550 to 750mm. In my estimation not unreasonable at this early stage in the game. Yes, we could fall back into the mid teens, but I suspect a new higher baseline after the volatility shakes out. Vaccine development and distribution play into the intermediate and longer term timing of execution, but this seems to line up well with their thoughtful roll out in 2021 and beyond."
"The market cap as of Friday is about 20% below what it was in Dec. 2019... Since then the company has done a big capital raise and will not be doing another one until some time in 2022, released very positive results from the cellulite trial and is about to get FDA clearance for it... the major markets meanwhile are higher than they were in Dec. 2019... there's a disconnect here that makes no sense, almost like an arbitrage opportunity..."
"Secondly, it it me or do the people here have an incredibly short time frame for seeing profits from this investment? It seems that they are confusing investing with a magical banking machine where you put a $1 in today and draw out $4 at the end of the week. Soliton has only been listed for less than a year and it’s more than doubled during that period but by many of the comments, you’d think it was down 90%. At this point, even the shorts are acknowledging that this stock will likely fly in the next month or two but this seems to be too long for a lot of people on this forum. I can’t make any sense of this at all."
"Like many others, I sold shares that were long term capitol gains. No reason to hold this stock anymore. Which ever way the sale goes, I expect management to get a flurry of lawsuits after the decision."
"""More than 75% of the 60 required prospective patients have been successfully treated across the four clinical sites in the pivotal trial.""https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/soliton-announces-majority-of-patients-treated-in-pivotal-cellulite-trial-expects-all-patients-treated-by-november-2019-2019-09-24?mod=mw_quote_news"
"Been quiet around here for a while but what else is there to do in 2020 but drink some beers, go to sleep and wait for 2021. Like everyone am still sitting tight and waiting for approval. With every day that passes we get closer to approval, launch and a Covid vaccine. Patience will be rewarded. Just kick back, and then enjoy the show, hold your shares tight and be happy."
Congrats LONGS!!!!
"Private Investors will most likely wait for stock to reach $40 level on jan2020 quarter, they will not like to loose as per the wishes of shorts."
"I really like this stock! Their entry into the tattoo billions is perfect timing. I have interviewed 100s of people with tattoos and at least 80% would love to have at least one or two removed. The time, cost and pain of laxer removal is awful. Soliton process and procedures will skyrocket their growth. The stock potential is incredible! At this time we are really starting on the launching pad. My target price is at least three digits."
Does anyone else find today's action peculiar given no announced news?
"Soliton’s Chief Operating Officer Joe Tanner just bought 41,000 shares. I believe this purchase will give him just under 300,000 shares total. Just follow the money!"
"Anyone who has done any due diligence here knows that Brad Hauser held leadership roles with Zeltiq, Allergan (after it purchased Zeltiq in 2017) and AbbVie (after it purchased Allergan in 2019). The thing you might not know - or at least I didn’t know - is that Brad’s twin brother Brent travelled exactly the same path to Zeltiq, Allergan and now AbbVie where he is currently a Vice President. I have always thought the fix was in for Soliton to be purchased by AbbVie and I think I’ll stick with that ;)"
"This is the highest close since June 23, 2020. Maybe SOLY is ready to take off. I like the slow building of the stock. I see a breakout. Good luck."
* SOLITON INC - WILL FILE AN ADDITIONAL 510(K) APPLICATION FOR USE OF RAP TECHNOLOGY TO IMPROVE APPEARANCE OF CELLULITE. Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:
"I’m not a shorter but I wish i do wish that I sold this stock prior to this. I say this because I would have sat on the proceeds and bought more shares whenever this thing bottoms out. With that said, I’m not selling at this point and I would strongly encourage anyone in the same position to hold as well. Everyone is going to make money on this stock! It may be a bumpy ride for a while but we’re all going to do well with this company/stock. Whenever this thing hits bottom and starts to turn around, I will be doubling my position. This is the tough part people, don’t sell/discount your shares and the shorters won’t be able to drive down the price. Best of luck to all!"
