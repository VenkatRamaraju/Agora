How would a Biden Presidency affect the stock markets?
"Well, just bought in under 40 bucks. Hope it works out..."
Done zero since spinoff. Forget it!!!
Never thought I'd get another chance to get DOW at these prices. 4.9% dividend. WOW !!!!!
My finger is on the trigger for a Monday buy.. Was just hoping to get it again in $25 range. What a Golden opp to earn 10% while it eventually goes back to $60 and you almost triple your initial investment.. DOW 30 company.. What more could a stock investor want? Anyone agree?
This could turn out to be a great stock to hold long term if they grow that dividend. Outstanding rate to start with.
Analyst James Sheehan in today's article gives his estimate for Dow's free cash flow at $5.7 billion which is way more than needed for the dividend. He issues a buy with $47 price target. The stock should be going way up.
Someone is buying since 10 am and flipped us to the positive side. Any thoughts?
"I guess I was wrong, this is trading like its going out of business, LOL. 7 out of 8 days down."
"Dow was once a great company but under Andrews rule they bought Rohm &Hass at a premium, stripped the units of people and resources, they were lead, seduced or willingly CombinedWith DuPont, kept the people in Limbo for almost 3yrs trying to breakup into 3 pieces to get more value out of the parts. We all know that that strategy cost hundreds of millions to implement, made the lawyers and bankers rich and the activist investor got out with no loss.. But the long term investors got nothing but value destruction. Then a lot of stock was bought back and now on the books as a loss. See now they are going to sell off core infrastructure (railroads,Docks). The sites that once were crown jewels are nothing more than industrial parks that you need a lawyer by your side to manage. When the companies were split DuPont was given the lions share of Dow’s Specially products that had high margins and leading edge positions in the market. Those assets had at least a $15 to $20billion NPV. Dow got very little for these assets. The true embarrassment of this is that Andrew got significant compensation for the Rohm & Hass deal and we paid him $45million plus to go away after the DuPont fiasco. Dow has drifted into a company whose strategy is seems to be one around financial engineering and less about fundamental new technologies. This is too long.. I am surprised that a Lawyer has not filed a lawsuit on behalf of the Stock holders about all the unmet promises. The current leadership is very strong and I hope they understand that financial engineering is not the best way forward. They need Some moon shots on technology to restore the company to what it should be."
When will DOW announce their dividend? Will it affect the pps?
Welcome to the chat room everyone! #1st post
"As we wait for earnings, lets give a thumbs up that they are better than expected for all the longs out there. Was also curious what you guys thought about this Small cap play. What do you think? https://cannabis-stocks.market/Weedtoyourdoor"
After much consideration I decided to considerably add to my position this morning. I like the divi. The stock has been a 'pain in my rear' but one has to look at the long term. With a divi exceeding 5% and probably will increase going forward it makes sense for the LONG TERM. Probably will suffer in the interim. Dividend cushions the negative short term.
Hold her steady
Where's the shareholder lawsuit for OLD DOW shareholders?????? Long time DOW shareholders have been ripped off by the investment bankers and managements.
It is so obvious that the analyst at Bank of America Securities has shorted this stock. The followers again no nothing and his analysis is self serving. So said that this down grade initiated the stop losses to trigger. Be careful and do your own analysis. Good balance sheet and sales will be up.
"Couldn’t help to buy 3,000 shares of DOW today before closing at $42.00. Great chemical company with good dividend. Will sell at $50.00."
Ex-Div = Aug 30
Earnings up! Market pulling us down bad jobs report people not working anymore!
Nice return in less than a month around 10%
"Dow's Plexiglass sales should be through the roof - all restaurants I have visited and many stores are using it for dividers! As more states open, the plastic shields and dividers will save many restaurants from going down to 50%. I had lunch a a place yesterday here in San Diego, and the owner had installed plexiglass shields between booths, so he did NOT need to reduce capacity. He also enclosed the cashiers cage in plexiglass. Dow should be selling lots of this product! Perhaps even for airlines."
Glad I bought at $48
Don’t low oil prices help Dow Inc
Dow Inc is hanging tough!!!!! Great company!!!! IMO Just keep on giving me that beautiful dividend!!!!!
Approximately how much a share dividend? I heard about a 5 percent yielder.
In at 43.25. Like the Div Yield. Should be good for long term.
"SHM today approved .70 dividend, payable June 12."
for those of us that received DOW shares from the breakup is anyone adding additional shares to their position and why please. Thank you
So Dow decides not to donate money to anyone who tried to hold up the election.Sounds like the company has taken a political stand.
"Following the DD merger, DOW lost at least some of it downside protection...... it now must have a strong economy to prosper. It looks like better economic days are ahead, and if so, DOW should do relatively better. Regrettably, they've sold some of their underlying assets and will need to pay more to use those 'backoffice and support' services. I'm looking forward to the rest of this year, but if the US economy tanks afterward, DOW will not be the place to be. GLTA"
Glad I kept faith with DOW despite naysayers.
Cramer just say $50 value?
"I've been holding DOW (the original one) since the 2009 downturn. Since, it has merged with DuPont into DWDP. And then split into 3, CTVA, DD, DOW. Looking to liquidate all 3 in the near future. Unfortunately the brokerages back then didn't track cost basis the way they do nowadays. While I still have all the records, it's definitely going to be a pain to convert and split them up, especially since I reinvested dividends every time.Anyone gone through similar and have suggestions/tips? I am wondering if it's acceptable to simply lump everything together."
I jumped in at 22.94 when everything was coronavirus doom and gloom LOLOLOL
"Jim Fitterling on Bloomberg markets, guiding earnings up 8% for the 1st Q."
"3m inflation warning ️ this am ominous for Dow imo. Plus the 5 consecutive days of pump and dump shows you what pros are doing,,"
"Oversold, this was the bottom today."
Originally part of Valueline dividend portfolio. Did recover from DD but it took 5 years so I’ll sell on any weakness. Lesson learned like Buffett run on any merger even acquisitions. Been a dope for 5 years
Why does the stock have a 52-week low of $21.95 and negative EPS of $3.17 - yet has climbed steadily to $57.75. Part of the 52-week low can be explained by the coronavirus crash but almost tripling since then with a negative EPS of $3.17 is mind boggling.
He all but said the dividend is safe for the next 12-18 months.
"Bought another 1,000 at $49.25.... why are the weak hands selling ?? Always the little guys panic and sell their cheap shares to the big boys. The world  economies will be growing in 2020, this is a great entry point for DOW. Holding all the way till $65 while I collect the dividend. Good luck to all the longs."
Very simple this is a Buy Buy Buy now !!
CEO was on CNBC powerful statements about demand and EV will be a money maker.
Well boys and girls futures up 255 based on possible China  trade deal. Forget about DOW dropping after ex-dividend date this news is much greater than just dividend. This thing is going back to $55 soon. The company should buyback all they can in the low 44’s before the stock price jumps back to the 55’s. This is great news for DOW !!! And remember it still has a great dividend.
Quite the volume today..12M+
I don’t think market appreciates “corporate culture”...Price keeps falling.
"Howdy folks, how’s that unlocking of share holder value going today? Don’t know how much more value I can stand."
"Short term I made a mistake adding to this 'disaster'. DWDP has definitely outperformed it. Many 'experts' got this wrong, too.Will just wait it out. Long term think it is still a good stock. Short term anything can happen."
Watching Fettering on CNBC it seems he was unwilling to provide a straight forward answer to the current state of Dow’s businesses. He spoke of this and that price but failed to give consolidated perspective . He did comment that May and June wouldn’t be strong but not to want degree. He did speak to pandemic specific safety measures the company was executing. Eisen and Frost however failed to request current numerical financial specifics. Also they failed to ask if Dow has furloughed or terminated any employees. All in all not a very good interview. We’re left in the dark .
"I hope everyone is well. in my humble opinion the divy will be cut as a precaution to build up capitol. It's just good governance against dropping oil prices. when the CEO spoke , oil was at 30 and he was very optimistic is would stay there or go higher. I don't mean to scare anyone, its just that in 2009 all was good until it wasn't for DOW. On a separate subject , I'm so disappointed in the government in not cementing a deal today. I'm beside myself they couldnt find a middle ground. stay safe"
"Dow (6.5% yield)Dow (DOW) sells commodity and specialty chemicals. Investors now avoid this stock because weak pricing and sales are dragging down revenue (down 14% in the second quarter from a year earlier). Investors also worry about recession, which really hurts cyclical companies.But insiders are saying these fears are misplaced. Three directors bought over $1.6 million worth of stock at $46-$46.70 in early August. Value investor George Putnam agrees with insiders that the stock looks attractive at this level. His Turnaround Letter has a good record, so he's worth listening to. He thinks the company's cost cutting, debt-reduction efforts and attractive valuation all make Dow a buy now."
Over 9% div on today’s purchase. We’ll see what that looks like in ten years.
"Dow is doing just fine. Even though the expected revenue is down slightly, its main natural gas resource to make all products and heat is way down. I mean thirty percent less. Do you know how much Dow is paying for natural gas every year? 30 percent less of main feed source plus 1/3 of less head count would make it way more competitive and even thriving."
So when does this trade
DOW reached an all time low at 30.12
I think Dow would like to own upstream supply chain which is a security in itself. The company uses natural gas to make mostly everything and heat up process equipment. @40 percent of revenue is used to pay for natural gas.
"Folks... DOW is oversold !! This company is a powerhouse in industrial chemicals and materials, just don’t understand why investors are selling at a 52 week low when the company is paying almost a 7% dividend. It has very strong financial and over seven research facilities around the world. Possible buybacks at these low levels can boost this much higher. Good luck to you !!"
Dwn 10% in a month
Redemption is finally Underway...A Very Long Wait for all the Suffering?
Dow wins a billion dollar settlement and the stock price drops?
GM tanking huge today....They used to say as GM goes so goes the country...hmmmm
"Grandfather left me 175.86 shares of Dow Dupont in which he had a cost basis Of $25.24 per share.Now have CTVA, DD and DOW what is my cost basis in each of these stocks?"
"Folks this is a great company with great assets !! 12 month price target  of $65... they are currently buying back shares with their $3 billion stock buyback program. Another good thing is that recently 3 Directors purchased a lot of stock between the prices of $46 - $48 when it dropped down from $59 - $60. So when you have all these things going on for a high paying dividend stock, it’s time to buy !! Good luck to all the Longs."
DOW will have okay earnings. Many projects at DOW have resumed and business is back to normal
Gonna snag some at $56.50 today
Paying over a 9% dividend and the basic feedstock for a chemical company is crude oil. Amazing. Probably one of the best buys on wallstreet.
"Be patient, Dow was written up in Barron's and this will pay a 5.9% dividend. Market top and traders took profit."
Now this is the end my friends. This is the end. Last day to sell before the bull is gone with the wind.
wow why is this selling off?
Dividend is now 5.8% at current price.
hard to swallow a Dow stock dropping close to 20 percent from its recent high at this point in the market with no particular news. A 4% + dividend is great but not when the stock is performing so poorly. And…. Hard to sell calls when there is no premium.
The Board should seriousLy consider the leadership and direction of the company when it consistently loses value at a % rate much greater than the overall market decline and never recovers at the same rate when the market turns around. A shareholders meeting is on the horizon and it’s time for change.
"Positive Barron's write up in The Trader column, may see a Monday AM bump..."
$46 a good price long term investment (6+ years)?
We've been bouncing around from 52 to 56 for a couple of months......it's just about time for the next leg up for DOW INC.......
should I add more before or after earnings?
Will Clorox warning affect Dow today ? It’s tanking huge pre market.
IMHO Many will assume that Fitterling’s refusal to comment specifically on the current state of Dow’s operations is an admission that he believes the stock market’s posture is correct. Wonder if he’s giving the same treatment to institutional holders. He should come out and defend the dividend with his job or admit that it is in danger of being cut.
"do we expect this stock to test the July 2019 lows? if so, would it be time to consider taking a position? how are they handling their debt? i like the dividends."
"As the markets get pricey and complicated investors buy these high dividend yield safe companies. I should have bought more at $47.25, but well it is what it is. Good luck to all the believers."
"Nice to see a press release from DOW related to the chemical industry....... looks like they have been playing with their chemistry sets following the DOW/DD merger. GLTA""Dow plans investments to boost adjusted profit growth by $3 billion, move toward zero-carbon emissions"""
"What a wonderful investment this stock has been. Bought a year ago, up almost 100% plus a 4% dividend and it is going on up from here."
INVESTORS: We should be happy - we all continue to LOSE MONEY ON THIS GARBAGE COMPANY led by BOZOS - but we do have this to be proud of: Dow named 2020 Best Place to Work for LGBTQ+ Equality by Human Rights Campaign Foundation
"Projected to $68...Alembic Global analyst Hassan Ahmed maintained a Buy rating on Dow Inc on Monday, setting a price target of $68."
"Analyst lowers DOW's pt because ""this is as good as it gets for Dow."" I say the best is yet to come. Buy."
It’s always “manipulation” when the share price goes down - Idiocracy.....
"Dow just announced building a zero carbon emission ethylene cracker, so they will clean the air we breath but polluting earth with plastics"
Well said BigBux. Could it go lower? Sure but it's a great time to buy or initiate a position as I did today. 700 shares at $43.24. Would love that X 5 patiently buying if and when it dips further. you have quality and a 6.5% div to help here...
There is always someone out there trying to make a name for himself. I’ve been at this for 40 years and finally believe that this is a sound investment. DOW could reach 70$ this month but even 60$ is just fine. They’ll pay a nice dividend along the way. Just stay calm.
Thumbs up for shareholders value. Unlock you some.
whats the big move attributed to?
Does anyone know if the tougher new EPA rules restricting the use of hydroflourocarbons (for ac systems) will help or hurt DOW?
Sell all stocks on the opening today. The bull is dead. Long live the bear. Have good reason for posting this Cash is King
"Pull up a 6 month chart for DOW. See where it was pre-COVID-Crash? See what happened WITH the COVID-Crash? Ouch!But do you see what is happening with it SINCE the COVID-Crash?Yeah, it's really bumpy, no doubt about it - boing boing boing!But, over time, it's none-the-less getting back to pre-COVID-Crash levels.If you're daytrading DOW...well...worry! There is no rhyme nor reason behind that bumpiness other than your fellow daytraders and they do NOT care about your anxiety!But, if you're in DOW for the ""long term"" YOU are winning (still)!Has anyone mentioned the outstanding dividend return recently?"
5% dividend yield. I think it is good after AT&T and Verizon
"Great quarter!! Great momentum!! Hate to see the short term profit makers drive the price down, but this tactic will dry up and the ‘investors’ will resume investing in a triple ‘A’ company. Buy! Buy! Buy!"
Theo physics do you still have shares of Dow
"Okay, kids, here's your official guide to stock action after an earnings report: Bad news is bad, stock sells off. Good news is good, stock sells off. Good news is very good, stock sells off. However, there is a 25% chance the stock rallies after good news, or stays flat after bad news. Any questions? :)"
"The downgrade from GS is so interesting! Who would believe in this downgrade since Dow is going to boom in this super cycle for everything. Buy more at dip, then keep holding with awesome dividend yield and super cycle growth. Long HOLD!!!"
CEO stated to Jim Cramer on CNBC that the dividend WILL NOT GET SLASHED. He also stated he is buying his stock. All good news for stakeholders. Happy Trading
Has anyone seen Theoretical Physics? Just wondered what his next call will be so I can do the opposite. Still waiting for $30 DOW stock price?
"Ignore the haters. Bitcoin goes up...Bitcoin goes down. It's the way it is and always has been. Two years ago, people were bad-mouthing it when it dropped to 4000. A year ago, people were panicking when it dropped to 9000. Now people are losing their minds when it dropped to 30000. See a pattern here? That’s why it very good to have a professional who guides you on your trade and management your investments .. @Kanielnolasco12 does not encourage failure. Even if you do they compensate you. I was able to grow my coin from 2 BTC to 8 BTC with their strategies on the Telegram platform. He a highly recommended professional"
Loosing faith in Valueline who stayed with DD and DOW after the merger was called but dumped bough as the losses deepened. I dumped 80% when Buffett’s dumped. Right now DOW is $600 red DD $98-$72 after 5 years. Lesson learned dump on every merger. Missing out on winners the past 5 years is aggravating
I'm confused. Pretty sure the closing price yesterday was 69.57. Did yahoo delete the div from yesterdays closing price? Is this a new thing? wth...
Rising rates will chase buyers back into chemicals. Dog whistle city in fact.
When will this hit 70$And when is 80
Luv those dividends![showed up around 02:45 this AM in broker account]
"wait til you see real plan and picture: Dow material in every stretchable clothes everybody likes to wear(explosive demand), most soft rubber parts and gaskets in vehicles and tools, tempupedic mattresses, plastic wraps, insulation panels,...main component for ethylene glycols, propylene glycols, propylene for hard plastic, ..."
Can someone please explain to me what are the positives for owning DOW? I feel this is a continuation of the downtrend of DWDP - I can't afford this enormous loss. Thank you
Zacks say strong sell??? Makes me want to double down on this pos. Always do the opposite of what Zacks says and you will make money.
"The last dividend was announced Apr 2, record date May 31, payable on June 14.If one adds 3 months, the next announcement should have been around the beginning of July, payable around mid September. So far no announcement as of August 8. Should one be concerned?"
Entire sector down. With a market pull back a good entry point may be $45-50?Anyone have any opinions?
"Well, I think JPM originally set a target price of $49. We are pretty much there so get ready for take off."
Wondering if it will stay 'up here' thru the next ex-div date..is 70 cents worth holding if it drops a couple or 5 bucks after? hmmmmmm......
"US EPA calling out the countries that pollute the oceans with plastics. China, Vietnam, India, Thailand, Sri Lanka. DOW working on alternatives to single use plastics. There’s a need for this technology."
"purchased 25 share, great dividend"
Bill Clinton caused this prob with NAFTA and WTO. 26 years a catastrophe its going to take awhile to fix it.
The key  to this beat is the positive guidance and we got it !! Folks this is the time to buy DOW.
"I just added DOW to my buy list. With the latest upgrade in earnings, this stock has the potential of a triple. In any event, with a 10 P/E and close to a 5% yield, this is a long-term buy and hold."
BoA analyst says look elsewhere because DOW is at the top of its game lol. Say what? Buy.
Downgrade Good time to buy more
$0.70 per share quarterly div
Cramer said last night chemical companies are out of favor and would sell DOW? Thoughts?
DD was a huge buy for hedge funds Dow not on the list
All chemicals are up today except this one. What gives? I loaded up anyway.
What's a good buy in price for DOW? Do we expect solid long term growth and continued dividends along the way?
This is a great time to get in and hold long. Dividend will not be cut and the stock is cheap!
40’s here we come. Then we may see some significant pressure from outside and sweeping changes at the top.
President TRUMP is THE man!
"I remember buying this stock under $7 about 10 years ago, sold ~$60, oh the memories... price is cheap, but still too rich for me... can't go wrong with this one though... will definitely go up, chill out and quite panicking..."
How’s that whole unlocking of shareholders value working for you today.
Will DOW pay a dividend?
Get use to it. Feel Dow will be stuck in trading range 42-52 for the next year or more. Merger and breakup of Dow/Dupont did not unlock value. Just added more overhead.
"I bought into DOW last year right around this time.It has finally exceeded my buy-in price, not taking into account the added ""plus"" of dividends.This is good."
if you sell Dow today are you entitled to the dividend or do you have to wait another day?￼
Last earnings on October 24th DOW was at $47.50 and after earnings it jumped to $56 on only 8 trading days on October 8th. This time we might see a bigger jump. I would not be short before earnings.
Do you guys think it’s gonna try to head to $34ish?
"Tread carefully. Dow is an international company and industrial production worldwide is slowing, including the USA. July manufacturing USA: - 0.2%. Also, the stock has been trending downwards in a falling oil (feedstock) price scenario. Your thoughts please."
I should have bought under $60…now it’s upward and onward- this stock won’t look back
I see we are getting the awards sweepstakes completed early this week.
"I’d like to see more share repurchases without selling off assets….. from what I recall, $3B in DOW buybacks were supposed to be made following the DOW/DD split….. I’m not sure all those shares have been purchased yet."
"Dow/DuPont ‘Market cap pre-merger = $130B (2015);What is it now? Yes, my calculations say $130B.Great spin job!"
Cramer just said he is loading up on Dow. Don’t know is this is good or bad...LOL!
Great dividend play in the bargain bin! Scoop up some shares on the down low while they are on Halloween clearance.
I’m up 50% with DOW. I bought after Buffet disclosed he bought it. 
"Well I see it’s holding on above $48.25 so I just bought another 1,000 shares of DOW at $48.25. My 5,000 share pay a yearly dividend of $14,000 bucks... not bad while I wait to $60 - $65 to sell. Folks you have to buy when there is blood in the water."
DuPont’s CEO and CFO were shown the door for lack of management urgency. Will Fitterling be shown the door as well.
sure has come to life today.......:)
"DOW sells off after earnings every quarter. Wait a couple of days, buy at a discount, and the stock recovers and moves higher every time."
One of the most valuable stocks with 40% upside potential and a fair value above 100..
"I bought into DOW mid summer for the Dividend... I always look at the Dividend Yield, P/E ratio and Dividend as of Earning...Additionally I look at the forecasted Earnings for next year... I chased the market for years and suffered for it...Now I let the data drive my investment decisions...Long term DOW will perform..."
"The best investment guidance anyone can use on this stock is do the exact opposite of that TP guy. I’ve never witnessed anyone so wrong on a stock before. It’s hilarious. When he said “rocket ship to 80” it cratered as fundamentals plummeted, all the while attacking those that were bearish. Now he’s just the opposite. Hilarious. He totally ignores the company financial forecasts. Maybe he has a pet rock or something that advises him."
This is easy money. Great value and 8% dividend.
Earnings revisions up have been breathtaking. Amazing the stock is still penned to the low $60's. Buy.
"Earnings call tomorrow. In general I think all the chemical / comm companies have posted better than earnings. DOW's mid year earnings beat was a shocker. I was set to jump in at $41 and it quickly got away from me. In general DOW and LYB should be trading a bit higher given the revenue/debt numbers and the solid dividend. I don't think buying DOW really requires too much thinking. It might drop 10% over the year due to cyclical changes, but over 2 or 3 years and 18% return and 15% growth...well, that's the story I'm telling myself anyway."
DOW dividend pay out is around 5.34% not bad when the 10 year is under 1.9% GET some
oil prices negative. dow will have enormous materials cost savings next couple quarters
"DOW trades like a bank....put simply, it the only place to put money.....because you get nothing basically keeping it a bank savings or checking acct. 5.5% Div is nice."
I bought 5000 shares today in advance of Fitterling’s interview with Kramer tonight. I’m confident this stock is a good buy right now!!!

"This is a buy, for the Dividend alone!"
can someone please help me and explain what I am seeing in my account with Schwab. The day of the split it showed in my Schwab account I received 50 shares of DOW price was $53.50. The stock is much higher today so tonight when I looked at my account why am I showing a loss? I would appreciate any help understanding this. Also my DWDP a and DOW cost basis from the day of the split off was different then what I am seeing tonight.
"Well, it looks like I picked a good time to take a long position. I’ve been buying over the last week with the intention of dripping the dividend and then using it for income over the next 30 years."
Still lots of room left!
"Bearish article out today from Seeking Alpha questioning profit margjns, earnings and sustainability of dividend for 2019. Not good news."
wasn't Jim Cramer pushing this for months before the spin-offs?
Next order $55
I'm slapping my self for not selling on the pop to almost 50.
why is this stock going down?? they charge double the pricing in the market as of Nov 20..results should be great this should easily be valued at 75$:-(
"This stock is exhausting.... Goes up when the market goes down, and vice versa."
I own a few shares after DD split it up - picked up another 150 today - will nibble if it goes lower - like the DIVI
Good buy right now!!!
All this share holder value is making me giddy with excitement
Can someone tell me what the opening price of this new DOW on day it officially started to trade
Appears DD was the better choice
Why in the world did Dow merge with DuPont -- this was supposed to be good for stock holders??????????
Data points ( Dow=$43.38/ share & S&P 500 about 2847) where ML called out a sell on Dow. Let’s compare these to future relative Dow stock performance. Funny how ML didn’t have a sell when Dow was 15+ points higher.
Why is this tanking today??
Picked up more this morning. Good luck longs.
"When jobs data is less than half the ""estimates"" I'd headline the news as: ""Estimates radically incorrect suggesting need to recalibrate estimating formula""...And I think the Markets will reflect that take on this ""news"" the same way before long today."
i see blaming Trump on a trade deal. NAFTA WTO and Subprime lending was all Bill Clinton and Dems trying to make USA a 3rd World nation. Trump is trying to fix that 30 year wrong for Americans and America
What is going on after hours?
this is a trade deal must. ridding it out
Will they maintain their dividend?
"just a heads up....you can eliminate troubled posters by using the ""mute"" feature located at the right of the posters name(three dots)....Easy, peasy and they're gone for good."
"DOW is moving in an overall uptrend....$50 by Friday and back to $53 within 20 days, if the Covid 9 fears subside.Buy anything under 48.40, IMO"
$45.50 today ??
Remember where Dow was before the spin-offs? Sad state of affairs. What happens when the next recession hits?
"Our meeting just broke up and I can confide that we believe the stock will settle at 61.50 by the end of next week. Looking for 70 by August. The analysts was correct in that the 49 dollar figure lined up with the information he was given and that was confirmed by the accounting department before the separation. Adding the enterprise value and good faith, this stock could be demanding 75 to 150 dollar valuations. As I reiterate, stay calm and look for 61-63 next week. It’s just a number so that’s no reason to jump out of your seats."
is Dow a strong producer of propylene? I am hearing a large increase in price for Feb propylene.
"From Cramer tonight:Next Friday earnings..Q1 2021 earnings release: 6 a.m.; conference call: 8 a.m.Projected EPS: $1.12Projected revenue: $11.09 billion""If PPG is any guide from last night, it should put up some amazing numbers, allowing the stock to break out to the $70s,"" he said.We shall see..."
Sum of the parts has not exceeded the whole.
I bought it for the dividend and a small rise in share price. I'll be happy with an 8% total return in a year.
We need some leadership change at the Board and organizational level. This team is not prepared to deal with the current issues impacting the marketplace. It’s why the stock is literally taking a beating much worse than the % market decline. This happens consistently and much more regularly. This leadership ship of Board and management should be held accountable to the shareholders. I think shareholders are letting these guys off the hook too easy. We need to exert more pressure for change.
"This will go back to $52 easily in a day or two. Very strong company with many products for the manufacturing sector. Just bought 1,000 shares !!"
Will buy under $61
Being a trader will never make more profit than a long term investor! Simple logic to invest in this wonderful company and their business!
Buy below $30
DOW DECLARES DIVIDEND.......70 cents a share payable on 9/13/2019. Should give some action tomorrow. Maybe will add some more shares.
"That there hasn't been a class action lawsuit initiated by shareholders with old Dow stock (before this merger, split, reverse split-continuing stock price plunge) - resulting out of this (Liveris, Breen) debacle is , to me, a wonder …."
Anybody who bought this week take a bow.
"To understand the 3x the Market drop one only needs to look at the collapse of oil prices of 20% in the last 24 hours. With further projections of the price war to drop it to $20/ barrel, this stock will fall further yet if that happens. So it’s not management caused."
"Investors do know that the price of natural gas affects DOW more than oil, right?"
Buying the dip.
"Hmmm, do I want to try and catch a falling knife?"
"DOW: EX-DIVIDEND tomorrow: 5-27-2021, record date: 5-28-2021. dividend : .70 cents..."
When will they anounce a dividend date?
Are rising energy prices good or bad for DOW. Anybody know?
Nothing short of fabulous news. Buy.
The cumulative value of the spin-offs to date is $45.26/share. This is for the benefit of that rocket ship guy who said it WILL hit $80 by eoy.
"ha! sure enough, JPM just weighed in again with an upgrade."
"Volatility should be expected until a couple of quarters can be analyzed. In many ways, this is a new company with little credible predictions for revenue, earnings, necessary capital expenditures, etc.Don't listen to all the unqualified noise, including a single analyst, stock buybacks or secret manipulations. Probably a solid long-term and boring stock to own."
Be careful with Zacks a 50% stock picker success rate. However Valueline has it in their Dividend Portfolio
Order in at 57.76
"Solid chart,story, and dividend. Will be investing in this next week along with WLKP."
Seems like that 1.1 billion settlement woulda gave us a little pop
Why down so much B of A downgrade???
Earnings estimates climbing again. Buy.
"Is Dow still a chemical company? It seems it now thinks of itself as some NGO or social engineering outfit. I read more about LBGQT, climate change, lovey-dovey pats on the backs to each other, community giving, self promoting of executives, employees boasting...….how about they get back to being a solid chemical company. The current crop of executives are left overs of the Liveris years, time to replace them all."
"I still can't help but think Andrew Liveris sold this company down the river. Dow was strong on it's own, and if DuPont was a different company with a different CEO, there were cost efficiencies to be obtained, but Breen is not a skilled executive, and DuPont had so many hidden liabilities that I certainly would have run from, because they couldn't be effectively evaluated and assessed. Dow should have remained a stand alone company, and they could and should have doubled their stock price in this very attractive environment. Instead, it's been dead money. I'm from Detroit, and we've seen this ""merger of equals"" sham before with Chrysler and Mercedes Benz (all senior management's options immediately vested, and even middle managers earned 2-3 years salary on close. Top management all left with huge golden parachutes. Now we have Fiat doing the same thing to Chrysler again. Merger of equals. Hah!) Liveris had a really large golden parachute at $52 mil plus, while next 4 execs took 8 figures out too. Wow! I'm a capitalist first last and always, but sure wish the law would evolve such that these egregious money grabs could be challenged as a complete violation of the fiduciary duty owed to shareowners by management. Best to all, and Happy New Year. Good thing I own some Micron and Rite Aid, which shows what competent management can do with great companies that have previously been run into the ground by some of those in the C suite who just went oink oink oink, ""Where's mine?!!"""
Nice divvy for patiently waiting folks!
"above sma(200), sma(50)"
How is that shareholder value working for you today?
"The sell-off is due to oil price rise fears. DOW uses petroleum distillates to make polymer products, which is their biggest source of revenue."
Initiated a position today with the intent to buy tomorrow if down on earnings. A nice stock with 6% div to add to my long term income portfolio.
Why is DOW so much more volatile daily than the broader market ?
PPI this morning confimed my love for DOW. Buy.
"really folks what is wrong with this company? Mr. market usually knows more than us little guys, so what is being said by these current prices"
This should be a nice start of the recovery. We need about $65 on these shares just to keep them interesting.
Can this hold today!
This is unbelieveable! But was below 10 bucks in 2009.
If I were to sell DOW or DD?
when are we going to see an increase in the dividend?
why are we getting destroyed today ?
Grabbed another 100 Friday. A good long term entry point.
Not the 1st time Dow plants have been flooded or impacted by major natural events.
"I bot today at 22.95 per share. The chart looked over sold and the 10 percent is an added bonus. Hope I made the right choice. Also, added to my position of Ford and bought Haliburton.Kevin"
"Looking at the second half of 2020, Dow still holds recovery potential. Looking at airlines, cruise lines, hotels and casinos, most of the lost business will not be recovered."
