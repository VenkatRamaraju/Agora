DOW is committed to this dividend!!!!
I see Zacks weighing in on DOW. Zacks is two brothers who rate stocks. Google their success rate which is only 50%. Fisher and Nassar at the other end 68%. Do not ever use Zacks to buy anything. The numbers they publish are fine but in many cases do not know the truth risks in buying a certain stock
"This thing is making so much money. If they would cut back all the woke theme advertising g for just a minute and actually talk about future revenue streams, this could hit 100."
Hold is now out weighing buy. For the dividend stay for growth run
CEO on Mad Money tonight?
Why is this tanking today??
$63 after earnings
"As expected, this was a sell the news event if one is still holding. Even though demand seemed to overcome high inflationary pressure this quarter , it all goes back to confidence as to whether this can continue. Right now confidence has weakened. As far as this thing doubling or tripling going forward, no chance. Earnings growth is not that strong year over year beyond this year and now that we’re a pure commodity play here expect low p/e multiples. Gone are the days where the hold Dow carried a 15-18 p/e. We’re now more comparable to a Lyb chemical stock that consistently carries a single digit p/e."
Bought more at 55.71
In!
tHANK YOU Lord for the deep discount $56+ per share see you all at $58 per share
"@Don Regarding your concern about Natural Gas costs killing DOW, I also own CF which is a huge Nitrogen Fertilizer company who has the same problem. However, let me remind everyone that Dow actually owns a lot of natural gas producing wells in Oklahoma. I don't know if they actually have a way to get their own gas to where it is used for manufacturing, but it is a fact they own gas production. How much is another? It seems like I remember it being in a joint venture between them and DVN. So it is not all cost to Dow. They may actually be making some profit on gas production. I am sure it wouldn't be enough to move the needle for Dow."
Not many are impressed. I think we are following worst case analysis after the merger. 4 1/2 year failure as the analysts cheered the debacle. Maybe maybe the future then 5 years then fear of more of the same. Next time follow Buffett run ever merger and acquisition. I cut my holding at the time but kept 100 shares for a maybe but wrong
How sustainable is this big dividend ?
What is going on with this stock??
why are we getting destroyed today ?
This baby is getting ready to make a nice run into the eighties. Get on board now .Only upside here.
"Well, I keep adding in the 56's and below. It will pay off sooner or later, in the meantime i get the divy!"
"I just added DOW to my buy list. With the latest upgrade in earnings, this stock has the potential of a triple. In any event, with a 10 P/E and close to a 5% yield, this is a long-term buy and hold."
I added also. this will rebound
