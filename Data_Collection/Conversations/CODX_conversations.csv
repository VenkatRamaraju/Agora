"Everything sounds good. One huge criticism. Stop optimizing the Eikon and get it out there. It will never be 100% optimal. Once you made hundreds of millions on it, get the next, improved, version out, and replace the original at a low cost to the buyers - maybe even taking a small loss. Getting the Eikon out there gaining market share is what is needed now. Getting it out there to optimize with real world experiences is also much more efficient than doing that in an ivory tower. That's how every other successfull company in the world does it."

SARS-CoV-2 Test Used in New Community Surveillance Method in ItalyPeer-reviewed results describe the Company's test being used to confirm the presence of the virus on community waste, including mutated strainsSALT LAKE CITY, Sept. 8, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Co-Diagnostics, Inc. (Nasdaq: CODX), a molecular diagnostics company with a unique, patented platform for the development of diagnostic tests, announced today that its Logix Smart COVID-19 Test Kit was used by Italian researchers to confirm the presence of SARS-CoV-2, including mutated strains of the virus, in a community surveillance method of testing single-use waste, with the peer-reviewed results published in the journal Science of the Total Environment.The innovative approach for surveilling communities involved testing the saliva left on single-use glasses and bottles for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in 20 different sites in Northern Italy during the second peak of COVID-19 in January and February 2021. The objects tested, including plastic coffee cups, plastic glasses, beverage cans, and plastic bottles discarded in snack bars, cafes, schools, and businesses, were swabbed, pooled, and then analyzed at the Istituto Superiore di Sanit√† using commercially available PCR reagents. Researchers then used Co-Diagnostics' Logix Smart COVID-19 Test to corroborate the results with complete concordance. The positive samples were later sequenced, and some were found to contain the presence of mutated variants of the virus.Dwight Egan, Chief Executive Officer of Co-Diagnostics, remarked, ""We are pleased to add this study to the growing list of scientific literature that supports the value and utility of our testing technology, and specifically our original COVID-19 test that we developed in the earliest days of the pandemic. Demonstrating that the virus can survive in saliva samples on surfaces long enough to allow for surveillance of the community may allow for another tool in the fight against the pandemic, and we believe that the Logix Smart test, built on our patented CoPrimer platform, was chosen as the assay to confirm the results due to its reputation as a high-quality SARS-CoV-2 PCR test.""The Science of the Total Environment paper can be found here. < https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004896972104818X >###"
"Viral load and Time till early treatment begins is a major factor on how bad the infection will end up being. Major reason Masks help reduce viral load which gives the body's immune system time to react to the virus . Cheap lateral flow test have highest false negatives early on. PCR test can detect better than all the other test. A false negative test wastes valuable time and gives the virus more chances to spread.The more virus you have in you the sicker you can get, Vaccinated or Unvaccinated . test."

Dwight, I was wondering so this Eikon testing platform is this basically a lab in a box that I'm going to have at home?Dwight Egan: I think that's not a bad way to characterize it. It's a it's a very small device, you know, think of it as being about 4.5, 5.5 inch square. This was featured not too long ago on NBC television on today's show, where they were showing what kind of things are likely to happen as people go back to work in the United States and what workers could expect to see. And they highlighted our Eikon device and showed us a quick demonstration of how it would be used and how simple it is to use.So I mean, the important thing about it is a direct saliva or nasal swab sample from the patient, which is self administered. And it just goes right into the little box, you close the box. And then you use a cell phone app to activate the test and start it.You can then walk away go back to work, go back to your desk, go back to whatever you were doing in your home. And let the results come to you in less than 30 minutes. And then of course, because of the Bluetooth connectivity and connectivity into the cloud, all the other data distribution points into the cloud for public health and other reasons will also be able to be accommodated. What makes this device really unique are a few things but one of them is the fact that it doesn't require extraction to get to the pathogen. And that's one of the main things that has made it so, this has not happened before in our world of molecular diagnostics, and why it has required very sophisticated labs to do the process.So when we talk about being able to take it out of that environment because we've gotten rid of extraction, which is very unique and very important, along with lyophilizing our product, and then along with developing a device with world renowned experts who are really trailblazers, and known internationally for their ability to do rapid PCR, which as I mentioned, they've done for other companies. That gives you an idea - why this is in fact, as you characterize a lab in a box, but it's a very unique lab in a box, I don't think it should be viewed as just another iteration of what's been coming down the pipe. And, of course, the fact that it's PCR, you know, Gold Standard Diagnostics, at the end of the day, also sets it apart from many of the offerings that are currently out there. And this box will last for many years in the hands of a school or a business or a home, wherever it's placed. This is not a throwaway device, the very inexpensive consumable is used once to put the saliva into - puts in the box, and then you discard that. But the box itself has a long-term utility for the purchaser of it.Theodore O'Neill: You've got a lot of cash on the balance sheet now, is there any thought about giving away the stock is about buying shares back?Dwight Egan: We don't have any thoughts about that, right now.We have a lot of cash.We have been able to finance our operation and our R&D, which is significant, especially with respect to the Eikon product. We're all about creating value for our shareholder base, and anything that we think would enhance that are things that we will consider and take under advisement but for right now, I think the best way for us to proceed is to keep our heads down and execute on the delivery of this Eikon product with associated test menu. And we think that's going to catapult us into an a very important place in the universal or international molecular diagnostics territory. This is a - in our minds truly a revolutionary product. And we're very excited about taking it out. We believe that we have to have cash reserves on hand so that we have all the flexibility we need to launch this worldwide marketing.We have a lot of good distributors, and but it's going to be a big test to take it out to the world, both domestically and internationally.So right now, we're accumulating cash. We plan on continuing to accumulate cash and get this product ready to go###"

"It is really pretty simple although they seem to make it complex, example: If you have a sick animal farming you isolate them from the herd and treat them asap , you do not treat them and re-introduce them back into the herd till they are clear of the disease. By vaccinating people already infected with covid and no previous test , you have a person in which the virus has a better chance to learn to avoid the vaccine. It may take months but when they spread the virus it has become more resistant to the vaccine. And doing this over and over with different types of vaccines just increases the chance of a monster variant . We have known this for many many years."

"Interesting article .. Delta variant .. COVID-19 PCR testing vs Antigen (Non-PCR) testing###But can the actual COVID tests on the market detect the Delta variant?To put it simply: not always. While the Delta variant (otherwise known as B.1.617.2) may be the pathogenic offspring of the novel coronavirus, it carries distinctive biological markers that some among the dozens of commercially available COVID tests from academic institutes and medical giants may not be able to sense.Testing for the Delta variant usually has to be done on a more precise level involving polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing platforms, which tend to be more accurate and sensitive to genetic variations within the coronavirus. But that level of testing also takes more time than a rapid response test which may return results within a half-hour but miss out on some of the biological details. Those faster diagnostics may be able to sense whether or not you‚Äôre generally infected with COVID, but not necessarily whether it‚Äôs the Delta strain specifically that‚Äôs afflicting you. ###"

"That is how much known about each of VOCs/VOIs .. many with warning signs on Mu after Delta ..### VOCs:Delta variant (B.1.617.2, AY.1, AY.2, AY.3)The delta variant was identified in India in October 2020. It gained dominance quickly after it was first reported in the U.S. in March 2021. In fact, delta has now spread so much that it has splintered into several sub variants, referred to as ""delta plus."" Delta plus variants have a mutation in the spike protein found in both the beta and gamma variants that may help to evade neutralizing antibodies. While around 13% of infections in the U.S. are from delta plus variants (AY.1, AY.2, and AY.3), it behaves similarly to the delta variant. Collectively, all the delta lineages make up 80-95% of sequenced infections in the country.Like other VOCs, delta has multiple mutations in its spike protein. What makes delta unique is that it is much more efficient at latching onto your cells and is much more contagious.""The delta variant is clearly the most contagious variant we've dealt with,"" Ellerin said. ""You ultimately have survival of the fittest ... the more 'fit' viruses, those with a replication advantage, ultimately win out. Currently, that's what we're facing with delta.""According to the CDC, delta is about twice as infectious as the original strain and estimated to be 60% more infectious than alpha. People infected with the delta variant have been reported to have viral loads 1,000 times higher than other variants. This contributed to the CDC changing its guidance on masks for vaccinated people.""Masks decrease the likelihood of acquiring COVID-19 and act as source control,"" Ellerin said. ""Which means if you have it, you are less likely to spread it.""Studies are still looking at how well vaccines and monoclonal antibodies can neutralize the threat of delta.""The vaccines are really very effective,"" Wildes said. ""For those who are on the fence, I think this has really helped me and a lot of people around me to remind them that if you get COVID and you've been vaccinated, you're clearly not as sick as the people I'm seeing in the ICU each day that have not been vaccinated.""### VOIs::Mu variant (B.1.621 and B.1.621.1)The mu was first sequenced in Colombia in January 2021. It has been documented in 39 countries, including the U.S., where cases in California and Florida were linked to travel from South America. The CDC reports that the percentage of COVID-19 cases caused by the mu variant has been falling since July, and the mu variant caused about 0.2% of COVID-19 infections in the U.S. the week of Aug. 20-27. While the CDC does not currently list the mu variant as a VOI, the WHO designated it as one due to outbreaks in Europe and increasing infections in Colombia and Ecuador, where the mu variant is responsible for 39% and 13% of COVID-19 infections, respectively.Early research from Italy shows mu is susceptible to antibodies produced by the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, but they don't work as well as they do against the original strain or alpha variant. Early research from the U.K. found specific mutations may help mu escape the immune system.###"

"Reports of Mu have been widespread in recent months.

In early August, Reuters reported that seven fully vaccinated residents of a Belgian nursing home had died from an outbreak of B.1.621.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not yet list Mu as a variant of interest or a variant of concern, though the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control has previously listed it as a variant of interest. The ECDC, an agency of the European Union, says that there is evidence that the mutations in the variant now known as Mu has an impact on transmissibility and immunity.Mu is the first new variant to be added to the WHO‚Äôs list of variants of interest since Lambda was added in June. Delta, the most recently added variant of concern, was upgraded to that status in early May."

Tate Reeves held a press conference claiming that the virus only causes ""sniffles"" in children under 18. Reeves speculated that maybe one or two children had died from the virus in the state since the beginning of the pandemic, before state Health Officer Dr. Thomas Dobbs corrected him. To date, seven children have died of COVID-19 in Mississippi.According to state data, at least 18,825 students have tested positive for COVID-19 within the first month of school and more than 15,000 had to quarantined last week alone."""""""

"The latest Simply Wall St. about CODX is surprising. ""Three-year EPS growth being relatively non-existent overall""? Not so. ""There's potential for the P/E to fall to even lower levels if the company doesn't improve its profitability."" These guys must want blood. For the 12 months ended June, gross profit margin was 83.5%, operating margin was 65.5%, net margin was 50.5%, ROA was 75.3%, and ROE was 80.7%. At the closing price on 8/13, FCF per share was $1.76; cash per share, $2.43; price/book, 3.6x; price/sales. 3.3x; and the LTM P/E ratio, 6.1. If CODX makes $1.20 EPS for 2021, that works out to a P/E ratio of 8.8. Reasonable stuff to me."
"In the long term, Co-Diagnostics noted that epidemiologists have argued that the rapid spread of the coronavirus and the appearance of mutant strains mean that COVID-19 could remain in varying forms for years, or potentially decades, similar to other endemic diseases like flu, the common cold and HIV.Relatedly, the company expects that other tests will also become available on the device, such as strep A, RSV, influenza A, influenza B and potentially any pathogen that can be sampled from a patient using saliva or a swab. It is expected that the new platform will be available for submission for regulatory approval later this year, the company said."

But some experts say it's harder to find testing appointments than last winter, when large, drive-thru sites fueled more than 2 million daily tests. At-home testing kits are also flying off of shelves as antigen test makers hustle to meet rising demands after scaling back manufacturing in spring.As COVID-19 positivity rates surge, some worry the high percentage of positive tests in the U.S. means too many people are foregoing testing because it's too hard to get an appointment.‚ÄúPositivity has climbed to highs that we haven‚Äôt seen since the big winter surge,‚Äù said Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. ‚ÄúPositivity for me, above all, is a measure of whether we are doing enough testing.

This new test, they suggest, could kickstart testing expansion, since supplies of current testing kits and reagents have been limited, and it could be deployed in remote locations, including clinics and airports, due to its ease of use and portability.The study was conducted by researchers at Simon Fraser University, BC, Canada, and results were published last week in The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics.‚ÄúThis research offers a cheaper, faster alternative to the most reliable and sensitive test currently used worldwide, without sacrificing sensitivity and reproducibility,‚Äù says molecular biology and biochemistry professor Peter Unrau, who led the team.Unrau, along with Ph.D. candidate Razvan Cojocaru and Master‚Äôs student Iqra Yaseen, first evaluated test sensitivity in the lab.‚ÄúThe microchip kit miniaturizes the reaction volumes by 10-fold, resulting in lower reagent consumption and faster assay times (as low as 30 minutes vs approximately 70 minutes), while maintaining the same gold standard in sensitivity as the higher-volume techniques,‚Äù they reported.:###"

"More testing more testing more testing. Writing is all around us........"""""" Yahoo FinanceHere‚Äôs the cost of going unvaccinatedRick NewmanRick Newman¬∑Senior ColumnistThu, August 26, 2021, 2:22 PMDelta Air Lines broke new ground recently by requiring unvaccinated employees to pay an extra $200 per month for company-provided health insurance. That may be a bargain for workers refusing to get vaccinated against Covid-19.The average cost of hospitalization for Covid-19 is around $20,000, according to recently published data from the Kaiser Family Foundation. At $200 per month, it would take 100 months of added premiums, or more than 8 years‚Äô worth, to cover the cost of a Covid hospital visit. That doesn‚Äôt cover lost worker productivity, testing and other disruptions, which is probably why Delta‚Äôs chief health officer said recently that the $200 monthly surcharge wouldn‚Äôt come close to fully covering the added costs related to unvaccinated workers.[Read more: Vaccine mandates: Here are the companies requiring proof of inoculation from employees]Delta (DAL) said the extra payments are meant to impose some accountability on unvaccinated workers who are raising costs and risks for everybody. Other companies could follow suit. The Food and Drug Administration‚Äôs full approval of the Pfizer Covid vaccine on Aug. 23 removes legal barriers some companies felt prevented them from requiring workers to get vaccinated, or treating unvaccinated workers differently from those who have gotten their shots. More companies are now requiring workers to get jabbed, and there‚Äôs some evidence more Americans will now be willing to get their shots."""""""""""""

Little things, like relieving yourself or sitting up in bed, become too difficult for you to do on your own. Your oxygen saturation rapidly declines when you move about. We transfer you to the intensive care unit.Stage 3. You‚Äôre exhausted from hyperventilating to satisfy your body‚Äôs demand for air. We put you on noninvasive, ‚Äúpositive pressure‚Äù ventilation ‚Äî a big, bulky face mask that must be Velcro‚Äôd tightly around your face so the machine can efficiently push pressure into your lungs to pop them open so you get enough of the oxygen it delivers.Stage 4. Your breathing becomes even more labored. We can tell you‚Äôre severely fatigued. An arterial blood draw confirms that the oxygen content in your blood is critically low. We prepare to intubate you. If you‚Äôre able to and if there‚Äôs time, we will suggest that you call your loved ones. This might be the last time they‚Äôll hear your voice.We connect you to a ventilator. You are sedated and paralyzed, fed through a feeding tube, hooked to a Foley catheter and a rectal tube. We turn your limp body regularly, so you don‚Äôt develop pressure ulcers ‚Äî bed sores. We bathe you and keep you clean. We flip you onto your stomach to allow for better oxygenation. We will try experimental therapeutics.Stage 5. Some patients survive Stage 4. Unfortunately, your oxygen levels and overall condition have not improved after several days on the ventilator. Your COVID-infested lungs need assistance and time to heal, something that an ECMO machine, which bypasses your lungs and oxygenates your blood, can provide. But alas, our community hospital doesn‚Äôt have that capability.If you‚Äôre stable enough, you will get transferred to another hospital for that therapy. Otherwise, we‚Äôll continue treating you as best we can. We‚Äôre understaffed and overwhelmed, but we‚Äôll always give you the best care we can.Stage 6. The pressure required to open your lungs is so high that air can leak into your chest cavity, so we insert tubes to clear it out. Your kidneys fail to filter the byproducts from the drugs we continuously give you. Despite diuretics, your entire body swells from fluid retention, and you require dialysis to help with your renal function.The long hospital stay and your depressed immune system make you susceptible to infections. A chest X-ray shows fluid accumulating in your lung sacs. A blood clot may show up, too. We can‚Äôt prevent these complications at this point; we treat them as they present.If your blood pressure drops critically, we will administer vasopressors to bring it up, but your heart may stop anyway. After several rounds of CPR, we‚Äôll get your pulse and circulation back. But soon, your family will need to make a difficult decision.Stage 7: After several meetings with the palliative care team, your family decides to withdraw care. We extubate you, turning off the breathing machinery. We set up a final FaceTime call with your loved ones. As we work in your room, we hear crying and loving goodbyes. We cry, too, and we hold your hand until your last natural breath.I‚Äôve been at this for 17 months now. It doesn‚Äôt get easier. My pandemic stories rarely end well.Karen Gallardo is a respiratory therapist at Community Memorial Hospital. """""""""
Chilean health regulator approves CoronaVac use among children over age 6
"Horsemen of the apocalypse continue to ride at full gallop. Tests are in full demand......"""""" In western South Dakota‚Äôs Meade County, more than one in three COVID-19 tests are currently returning positive, and over the last three weeks, seven-day average case counts have increased by 3,400 percent. This exponential growth in cases is likely attributable to the 81st Sturgis Motorcycle Rally, which drew an estimated half a million visitors to Meade County and its environs from Aug. 6 through 15, potentially acting as a superspreader event.The pandemic is surging nationally, not just proximal to biker chaos in South Dakota. Defined in large part by the emergence of the highly transmissible Delta variant, the United States is experiencing its fourth surge of COVID-19 right now, and our nationwide case counts have increased by 64.4 percent over the last 21 days. (For more on our methodology, see our note at the bottom of this column.)But while Southern states have been the main drivers of this surge thus far, the recent spike in cases in South Dakota warrants special concern.The state more broadly has witnessed a 686.8 percent increase in daily case counts over the past three weeks, currently more than 10 times the nationwide rate. Meade County‚Äôs post-Sturgis uptick is certainly a contributor to this state-level increase, but neighboring counties have experienced a sharp incline in cases, too‚Äîranging from a 1,900 percent increase in the past three weeks in Butte to a 1,050 percent increase in Lawrence.

Oh well POTUS+CDC+.. made a BAD move to tell folks to enjoy 07/04 without masks after fully vaccinated .. disregarding the warnings about COVID-19 VOCs/VOIs non-stopped mutations with new strains capable spreading and breakthrough even those fully vaccinated ..Delta is just one of many upcoming VOCs/VOIs ..Hope this time they are moving back in the right directions and be consistent not to make another mistake again .. Masks+Vaccination .. Testing/Contact-Tracing ..
Wait a couple of weeks after all the kids go back to school and then it will hit the fan. Unvaccinated kids in school never a good idea under a pandemic. Mask are a band aid approach they help but the young do not always do as they are told.
"Here in New Hampshire they are calling for more and more testing. College students that are vaccinated will be tested once a week and non-vaccinated students will be tested twice a week, mandatory! Why this stock is not skyrocketing right now is beyond me. I won't be selling my shares until we hit at least 35 which is a real possibility with all the testing being required again. GLTL"
"COVID-19 PCR Testing vs Non-PCR Testing ..Which test is beest ..Coming soon .. EIKON COVID-19 PCR Testing .. Accurate, Inexpensive, Fast###COVID-19Which test is best for COVID-19?January 5, 2021 By Robert H. Shmerling, MD, Senior Faculty Editor, Harvard Health Publishing:The bottom lineIf we had fast, highly accurate, and inexpensive home testing, we could repeatedly test ourselves before going to work, heading off to school, or otherwise spending time near others. If the tests were more accurate, we could more confidently rely on testing to know when it‚Äôs safe to relax distancing, masking, and other protective measures. But we aren‚Äôt there yet.While we‚Äôre lucky to have reasonably accurate tests available so early in the course of a newly identified virus, we need better tests and easy access to them. All tests should undergo rigorous vetting by the FDA as soon as possible. Ideally, they should be covered by health insurance or offered free of charge to those who are uninsured. Lastly, widely available tests and short turnaround times for results are essential for effective contact tracing and getting this virus under control while awaiting widespread vaccination.###"
