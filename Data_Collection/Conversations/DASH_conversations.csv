"Christopher Payne (President and COO) and Andy Fang, who I believe recently appeared on CNBC hyping the company, have both sold $millions of stock in the past couple of months. Look at InsiderBuyingSelling for the exact amounts."
Q: How many shares can SoftBank sell for $182.95A: NONE![The premarket block trade offered 11.4 million shares at $182.95 to prevailing market prices]
How do you know when the music stops? Are they gonna tell you?
"I can’t wait until this earnings when once again, DASH reveals to the world they will never be profitable... model just doesn’t work as consumers only use it now cause a company is willing to deliver food to their doors at a loss!!! "
"Goldman says 187 target and the stock goes up, BA says a buy and it goes up even more... now worth more than Uber, go figure"
So lets compare Dash to Fedex.Dash market cap $71 BillionFedex market cap $68 BillionOne of these companies is either severely undervalued or one of these companies is severely overvalued.Which one is it??
"If you liquidated Fedex you would get billions of dollars from cash, hardware, buildings, and materials etc. What would DASH be worth to liquidate? Nothing! How are these two companies valued the same? Answer, they should not be!!!"
What will the manipulated trading range be this week for DoorTrash?
Remarkable strength. Give DASH underwriters a raise.
"Worth $70bb? A total joke, fake upgrade, buy the fake value"
"I wish selling short was not so addicting. Just when I thought that this was a sure thing the market does just the opposite. This stock is up about 18 % since August 2nd, unbelievable!"
"In a worst case scenario for SoftBank and Sequoia Capital, computer modeling indicates no path forward for the incremental unloading of their positions and they exit en masse resulting in perhaps as much as a 90% correction.Of course, an announcement by DOL or DOJ targeting DoorDash’s blatantly illegal employment practices would effectively achieve the same result.If neither of those things happen, Q3 earnings looms ominously on the horizon.The vultures always come home to roost."
"$dash violates proposition 22 in California. It treats drivers as employees, rather be than independent contractors. It forced drivers to take unprofitable trips, by psychologically usesing ecceptance statistics lol"
We should rename this group Sour Grapes
"Just dropped $6 in 10 mins, right about when I was selling short."
"Restaurants are beginning to close their dining rooms and become take out/delivery only due to staffing reasons. Doordash conquers those kinds of issues. Next time you’re at a Panera Bread, take a look at their setup. If you’re having these issues, why not simply downsize your restaurant and give the customers what they want…which is takeout and Doordash delivery. Delivery is the future…period."
"DoorTrash went past the moon, and next target is Mars!! They will colonized mars and charge fees to deliver rocks.."
Great pairs trade: Short DASH with a P/S of 18 and buy UBER with a P/S of 6.
Needs to close below 214
"Thanks for another successful transaction of $25, 000. I'm so glad trading in your platform FacebookStephanie A William"
It’s like printing money!!!
Softbank trying their best to keep up the pump.....Insiders are going to foil their plan....lol
who wants to bet that today AH there will be notices of additional exec sales? it seems to be like clockwork on Friday after close
These prices are looking too good not to short. Overvalued.
"I see everybody on this board saying Doordash is grossly overvalued or a doomed company. However, this is far from true. Doordash already has an operating cash flow margin of 14%. Additionally, unlike their competitors they have high quality growth which is why their gross margins are improving year over year, they have over 55% of the growing delivery market in the U.S., and have a pristine balance sheet with a cash/total liability ratio of almost 3X. On top of this, with growing revenues and consolidation in the industry they will be able to lower their fees and improve their competitive edge and compete with restaurants rolling out their in house delivery systems."
Nuclear war could happen and DASH would still be green. Most manipulated stock ever.
haha Ok now what? Who is gonna buy all these massively over priced shares? Who?
Anyone know who’s propping this up??
Volumes speak volumes. Check the key view. Short volume (owed for) from July 15 + topped 13.3 million shares. The institutional ownership is over 91%. Which way we going?
"Dash current market cap 74 billion on 4 billion of revenue, Fedex current market cap 60 billion on 84 billion revenue . Either Fedex is way undervalued or Dash is way over valued, you tell me."
There must be some pending news. Maybe they are going to invest in Bitcoin. Trying to hold my short with a substantial loss.
Looking forward to the next pumper fake news from dash today!
"As tempting as it is to buy puts... be patient my friends. They still have $3.5b on the balance sheet from the IPO.... however from dec 31 to June 30 they managed to burn over $1b in cash. If this pace maintains, will likely be best off to buy puts/short next April/May although it’s entirely possible they’ve ramped up the Burb rate this q. Institutions won’t sell until this cash falls off the balance sheet... although it 100% will given this company will never earn a penny."
75b market cap lmao. Who is acc buying at these levels ?
"Want to see manipulation? Just go look at the open interest on tomorrow’s 195 calls and 185 puts.... 0% chance this stock could ever leave this range when considering that. If something drives price up, Softbank will sell it down. If something drives price down, SoftBank will just buy it back up. 100% illegal, if the SEC just looked into who is buying and when, and who has the open option positions on this stock it would be simple to prove manipulation."
Let's see if Dash ends the day under the $200 mark .
"Oh my God, I hadn’t checked this in a while. Finally loading puts again."
loaded up on puts today!
Only in this market would a non profitable company see it's market cap increase nearly 7b in a week when it's net revenue is only around 4b... no logic whatsoever.
"Well.. as you all know now, I have lost a lot of money shorting Doordash. I then bought puts in July thinking it was going to tank under $130….. it is now almost $200 so… I currently hold November puts at a strike of $170 and I am getting out of my position. This obviously won’t ever go under $180 again (not this year at least) so as soon as this touches $185 or so, I’m selling at a loss and getting out. Clearly this stock is manipulated and controlled by hedge funds and they are all super long on this.- Lawsuits- Insiders selling- Earnings loss- Never produced a profit- Prop 22 ruled unconstitutionalAnd yet… this stock is on its way to $200.. (up 27% in the past month or 3 months.. something like that)That is ILLOGICAL and deserves an investigation. But whatever.. good luck to all the bears who are stronger than me."
"I’ve been curious how Chipolte, a simple fast food shop, can continuously have stock price at such an elevated P/E. Just noticed that 90+% of their stock is institutionally owned. Similar club to Dash. Would be interesting to see list of all $50B+ companies that are vastly owned by institutional investors, to stay clear of"
Today is the day we break thru 180180 is only 6% away. DASH very heavily margined stock that we can break 180 even before lunch.
GrubHub with better financials is valued 35% off this.
short it
Don't forget these guys GS softbank and Susquehanna all hedge with options. So they manipulate the price so they can zero out all of the calls and or puts they've sold as well. Then they sell the underlying stock at the elevated price. It looks like literally no retail is touching this thing anymore.
Our FREE GUIDE can help you protect your money from tax increases before it’s too late! (http://Irsredalert.com)
"Its not how much revenue you make, its how much of that revenue you keep!!Dash is very good at increasing revenue, but not so good at keeping any of it........."
"Now approaching cap value of Uber, a company that is also with over priced stock, 4x total sales, and competes with food delivery and has ride share to boot."
"This is not quantum physics. A very small cadre of institutional investors control almost all of the stock. Anybody with any degree of common sense knows that this is a fundamentally doomed company—including the institutional investors.So, if you are an institution and you want to cash out, how do you sell 90% of the outstanding shares without driving the price down on your way out the door?Enter an incremental exiting strategy.Institutional actors limit the daily supply of shares available which, when coupled with speculative COVID-19-related retail demand, has driven the share price progressively higher.In a perfect world, the institutions would continue this strategy while they unload a couple million shares per day ad infinitum until they had sufficiently exited their long positions while profiting off options underwriting in the interim (that alone—if anything—should draw the scrutiny of federal regulators.)The only problem with this strategy is that it is time-dependent and the institutions know that DASH is likely to have burned through most of its cash by Q2 2022. Further, it is arguable that there is sufficient retail demand to absorb supply longitudinally.DASH’s Q3 earnings are likely to show accelerated losses and declining revenue which, when coupled with the eventual decline of speculative COVID-related demand, should create substantial downward pricing pressure.Nevertheless, it is likely that institutions will continue to drive DASH shares higher over the next 60 days systematically exiting long positions absorbed by unsophisticated retail investors while simultaneously profiting off of options underwriting activities.Of course, and as I have cautioned before, regulatory intervention could occur at any time. If it does, the potential for losses for those with long positions will know almost no limits. Conversely, potential profits for those short will also be extraordinary."
I still think buying a home is the best investment any individual can make..
"This is the prime company to short, 65B for food delivery"
How long can DASH lose $100 million a quarter and how long can it trade north of 13x sales and be worth over $60 billion before investors realize they are playing with fire. Should DASH stock be work 2.5 times VIAC?
PTON and DASH are doing really well Chuck
This seems to be like GME and AMC.
What happened??
So now we know who has been propping this up. Made up analysis by BOA.
Dash model will never make money! Restaurant profits from the alcohol sales not food. Margins aren’t there. The paid for analyst can make up any story and disappear before earnings. Happens all the time.
"Its so hard to decide on which company to choose. 1. Doordash with their sophisticated logistics approach to delivery. Reminds me of my newspaper delivery days!2. Fedex with their old school delivery using wasteful trucks/planes/trains to move our stuff.One makes money and one loses money, so which do we choose??The money losing one of course, thats why dash has a much higher valuation the fdx!!crazy times.......think ill buy a peloton"
This new 'dashpass' they are advertising will help them lose money even faster.
The biggest bagholder of all the time : Softbank. Lol
"Here's a nice little comparison. Door Dash is now valued at more then Darden restaurants AND Yum brands. These two companies are the holders of Pizza Hut, KFC, Taco Bell for Yum Brands and Darden's is the parent company of Olive Gardens, Outback Steakhouse and numerous other restaurant chains. Isn't it just amazing how a company that has virtually no assets and even more important, no earnings can be valued at more then some of the largest restaurant companies that they are dependent on delivery orders from?"
"If you short DASH, you will lose because the HOUSE hold over 90% of the shares outstanding. It is the bestlong candidate regardless of fundamental or over valuation. Every short will be squeezed going forward."
"This is a disaster in the making. Soaring gas prices. Soggy, cold deliveries. Competition galore. What could go wrong?"
"$65.3b soggy fry delivery company. I REPEAT, $65.3 BILLION SOGGY FRY DELIVERY COMPANY!!! DO YOU NOT SEE THE PROBLEM WITH THIS LOL?"
"Because we already know how manipulated this is, be prepared for a guaranteed close between 190-193"
Picked up some $215 puts expiring tomorrow. Over 5000 open interest on $210 calls. Institutions won't let them expire deep ITM... IMO!
$30 stock
Volume now 14.8 million shares w/ after hours.
Falling like a rock !!
I literally couldn't imagine buying this at $100. It's a $40 stock under the most optimistic cash flow circumstances. They will easily burn through their cash by next summer at this rate.
"I expected the Dash longs to be quite today on this board, but not even hearing any crowing out of the shorts."
Total trashy manipulation. Are the giving SoftBank the Gold Medal for driving the price up and paying off analysts?
"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The New York City Council on Thursday approved legislation to license food-delivery apps including Grubhub, DoorDash Inc and Uber Eats and to permanently cap commissions they can charge restaurants.The companies say the price controls are unfair and vowed to fight them."
"Oh I see, now I can get my booze delivered with my pizza, so now I totally get why this at the value it is"
Good bye to a 67 BILLION dollar valuation to a company that will never be profitable.HELLO DASH PASS !!!!!!
Timber
This is going to put fedex and ups out of business!!
Didn't they guide a slow ?
I’ll take one for the team and buy some shares Monday so it’ll drop down to a reasonable price.
Any longs are fooling themselves to think that dash is a company worth over 50 billion. I am so happy I was $3 million short this thing at 206 (documented in this chatboard) and held out the ride to 225. 180 here we come!
"It’s so hilarious how this company has this valuation honestly, once the next earnings comes out and once again they show how good they are at losing money this will finally come down. By then, I’m sure SoftBank will have unloaded all their shares onto these poor bagholders holding $200+ shares when the share price drops to $80"
"We may have picked the wrong stock to short. DASH is a CNBC Disruptor 50 stock so they are going to keep this stock propped up every chance they get. My comment gets deleted if I post the link but head over to CNBC and search for DASH and you will see the article published yesterday, Sept 23 and the comments by Cramer on Sept 21."
Watch this jump when Dash starts delivering weed!
Dash might be in a process of issuing additional offering.
"DASH ACCOUNTING ISSUESThese issues are not illegal, but are something to be aware of. All are found in DASH’s shareholder report dated August 12, 2021.1. In the quarter ending June 30, 2021, DASH had $175M in stock-based compensation expenses. This amount is not counted in cash flow or Adjusted EBITDA, yet it is a real expense.2. Sales and Marketing expenses increased to $427M from $168M in the prior year quarter. I believe a big portion of this increase was for driver incentives to recruit enough drivers. If this had been classified as a cost of revenue, the gross profit margin would have been much lower.3. Note that cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities combined decreased approximately $200M in the first six months of this year. The company is burning cash."
I add shares at all prices. Dollar cost average and it has worked beautifully. Winners like WIMI will make your account balloon over the years. $DASH $VENA
It's take down crime ridden stocks day. SoftBank wins the prize for best manipulated stock
"Raise driver pay by alot. Force Uber to do the same. Make Uber unable to put eats profits to cover uberx losses. Uber forced to sell eats. Doordash buys Ubereats and controls market and stock goes to 1k. Don't race to bottom, race to top."
Uber has the same food business at DASH plus the largest ride share and transportation on the planet and DASH is almost worth more than UBER. Let that sink in … dash should be around $100 and I believe it will get there by EOY
"I simply can’t believe they allow this thing to trade like this and they do 0 about it, LMAO"
"Hey 2000's called and they want their webvan back bawhaha I have seen this movie before,"
So app crashes bad yesterday and impacts/costs are still unknown at this point and more insider selling last night and trending towards green open? Seems legit
My price unchanged at $50. Hope they pump this to $255 so I will short more.
"Be patient shorts... I keep saying it. Let them manipulate it higher before entering, just means bigger gains after the inevitable drop."
"Going up on low volume, which means it can fall back very easily , the ugly has just begun in the stock market ."
There is no reason that dash cant be the first food delivery company to reach a trillion bazillion dollars!Didnt Cathy said so?
"Up 5.66 with 45 min to go. If typical, selling starts soon and this will drop at least $3-4 to end the day."
I am on the sidelines but this stock is worth no more than $30/sh under the most optimistic income projections. Could be the most overvalued exchange listed company. There will be a Wile-E-Coyote moment where the bottom literally falls out and nothing to brace the price collapse. That's when I jump in for the elevator ride down.
Shorts finally got up off their seats and cheered for an hour this morning until they realized it was going right back up 
This NYC councel ruling was bad for dash right?
For me my longs are up and dash is only up below 1% thats fine. This stock is weak...
eventually automated delivery will happen and all these people will be out of work. That will take things into the stratosphere
The city of Chicago is bringing a lawsuit against Grubhub and Doordash for unethical practices.
"Wal-Mart teaming up with Ford to come up with AI deliveries, Now how will that impact Dashes model since is depends on real people using their worn out vehicles to deliver for them ."
This type of business will be met with government regulations. Salaries/benefits/and whatever else they believe 1099 individuals don't have. The climate will have a negative impact for everyone involved.
Nasdaq up 1% and dash ends day flat.... lets go!!
"This was originally posted after Q2 earnings. I will post chapter two later today in light of the wire services’ coverage of DD’s introduction of alcohol delivery.DoorDash University: Pump & Dump 101–an introduction to stock pricing manipulation.Instructor: Tony Xu, CEO DoorDashGraduate student assistant: Yun Li, markets reporter for CNBC et al.Course syllabus: in this class you will learn the basic concepts of manipulating the price of DoorDash stock to benefit yourself at the expense of others. At the end of this course you should be able to:1. leverage mass media contacts to disseminate by proxy untimely and irrelevant information in an effort to frame public discourse while redirecting attention away from abysmal earnings reports that would otherwise have a negative material affect on the price of DoorDash stock;2. conceal this behavior from regulatory agencies tasked with enforcement and compliance of federal securities laws;3. Unjustly enrich yourself and your friends at the expense of retail investors who have made direct and indirect purchases of DoorDash stock through retail investment accounts and mutual fund allocations, respectively.Chapter One: Leveraging CNBC TechCheck...After releasing a disastrous quarterly earnings report that clearly indicates DoorDash GAAP EPS losses are accelerating, it is highly advisable to have the CEO conduct an interview with a CNBC reporter utilizing the TechCheck format. The CNBC reporter should be briefed prior to conducting the interview on talking points favorable to DoorDash while avoiding those of a critical nature that may focus unwanted attention on issues material to the future performance of DoorDash stock.Here is an example of a good talking point: “Tony, let’s talk about how DoorDash is going to make lots of money for investors by refocusing its resources on grocery delivery and bringing InstaCart to its knees.”Conversely, here is an example of a bad talking point: “Tony, your Q2 2021 earnings report indicated that DoorDash EPS losses accelerated using GAAP standards while you and your executive team were selling DoorDash stock as fast as you could. Now how do you explain that?”Chapter Summary: like the old saying goes, if you keep repeating the lie over and over again, people will start to believe it. Using mass media and press sycophants to sell the lie by proxy is an efficient and persuasive method to artificially drive stock prices higher while DoorDash executives make millions by dumping their stock to unsuspecting and unsophisticated retail and institutional investors.Chapter Two to follow in a future post..."
"Question: if DoorDash has over a million active drivers and an established logistics application, why on earth do they not expand into a the rideshare segment of the market just as Uber entered the delivery business?Makes all the sense in the world, right?Answer: because a substantial percentage (perhaps as high as 70% based upon analytical estimates) of all DoorDash drivers are driving non-insured/under-insured vehicles without proper registration in blatant violation of state and, perhaps, federal laws (RICCO).DoorDash can’t enter into rideshare as they know it will bring additional attention and scrutiny to their already substantially illegal labor force.A WARNING TO DOORDASH: every incident where an individual uses your application and makes false statements about their legal status to operate vehicles on local, county, state, and federal roadways constitutes federal wire fraud under Section 18, 1343 USC. You are not only complicit in these illegal acts, but encourage them as well.A WARNING TO COMPANIES WHO SUBCONTRACT WITH DOORDASH: you are equally complicit by in these illegal activities."
"Amazing. Money printer at feds might be going brrrrrrrr, but the money burning furnace at door dash is going vrooooooommm."
Why is a delivery service platform trading at a price to sales of 16?
This is one of the most manipulated stock......It will never be profitable but hedge funds trade it back and forth to run the value up way past even outrageous. So now they will sell alcohol?? So now a 20 year old driver will put the company in bankruptcy for serving delivery booze to underage customers willing to pay 20 dollars for delivery of a 20 dollar six pack of bud light. What a joke. Out of business in a year.
Justeattakeaway's revenue= 2.042 billion USDDoordash's revenue= 2.886 billion USD.Justeattakeaway's market cap= 14.17 billion USDDoordash's market cap= 74.52 billion USD.Wth is happening here?
"As someone that does delivery for doordash, it actually makes me wonder, first off, since the vast majority of times the orders are not ready when we go to pick them up, one has to just sit back and ask themself, who's going to take the order to the car? Whose going to take the order from the car to the customer's door? When a customer uses a delivery service to place an order, they are expecting service. That means timely and efficient delivery of their order. We keep hearing about autonomous electric cars, but the day will come when they are not they are made out to be. One of the reasons that auto company in the world is trying to get into the electric self driving cars, isn't for the profits from the car but more importantly the constant revenue stream they are going to get from owners to update the software such as the mapping necessary to even think about autonomous driving. Next, anyone that thinks they are going to get away without having to pay highway taxes, which are collected from the sale of gasoline is dreaming. There is already talk about charging a per mile fee, tax to offset the loss revenue from more efficient autos and now the electric cars."
"Amazon all over again. ""No one will use online shopping."", ""No one will ever use doordash after covid."" lol. ""The cap is too big, it's not like they are in every town"". No pizza huts or KFCs around me though. To be honest."
The “upgrade” was based on an unachievable 2026 revenue estimate. It’s a pump. What analysts give a price target based on a hypothetical 5 year out scenario ? Last ditch effort to pump. I’m expecting dash to do a secondary any day now.
"Longs, best opportunity of the year to buy Dash! so strong!!!"
I spoke to a fund manager today and asked him what do funds think about analyst upgrades... he said the bigger the company the more incentive their is for an analyst to have a buy rating out so that they use their firm on mergers and offerings.... DASH is crazily overvalued and analysts cant lower their PT because of softbank and DASH mgmt
Doordash to the moon
"I’ve officially closed out my long position. Sold too early / on the way up, but DoorDash treated me wel"
"No surprise, SoftBank starting to unload their shares. They only sold a few billion worth cause any more and they’ll tank this stock cause nobody wants it."
Cramer says buy DASH now in full speed. Way to go!!!
"Great week very good start... if you look at other high flying names their off 20-30% off their highs... zm, roku, pton, etc. this will get to below 170 soon"
"....And another 150,000 shares sold by insiders 8/30/21 SEC 8K reports. Never ends!!!!"
Why would you buy Doordash when $UBER is sitting at around the same valuation. They have 5xs the revenue and a much more diversified biz. Way overpriced stock.
Imagine $SOLO and door $DASH partnership   
"There must be a reasonable explanation why or how is Doordash worth $12.5 Billion more than Fedex??Dash m. cap $73.3 billionFedex m. cap $60.8 billionPE ratioDash........funny, never ever made a profit!Fdx , PE 13Makes me want to hop on a bike and start delivering!!"
"I've been short for awhile, and despite firmly believing this stock should be closer to $50 and will get there eventually, it is so obviously manipulated that it is impossible to time it. I see Softbank and others trying to rotate out, hence the big block sales especially in the morning and near the close, but mutual funds are consistently buying via algo buys all day, keep the price up. This will eventually decline, most likely when the Nasdaq dumps and institutions run for cover, but when that happens in this irrational market is anyone's guess. Long term puts are probably the safest way to play it."
Anyone here know how much Meituan is worth? Spoiler alert: a lot more than $60b
That was a nice artificial pump. They’re doing everything in their power to keep this poop ship afloat.
"the best solution is to avoid this stock, let the institution play by themself. You can never make money on this one doesn't matter you long or short. The institution controls the volume and their cost base is so low. They can make money on any situation except the stock loses liquidity totally. just not worth it to bet on this one."
How do they keep this floor at 180-182?
Goldman Sachs issues price target neutral $187
"Negative earnings. Missing earnings expectations. Diluting shares every quarter. By all means, do buy more. Lol!"
"Dash should just buy FedEx, since they’ll soon be delivering beds and dressers, they’ll need bigger vehicles than Dasher bikes and scooters."
"Of course. The moment l got in, it has been dropping. The story of my life. Thinking after an upgrade, l won’t miss this time. Got in @ 205. Hasn’t seen it go up afterwards. Why people are dumping it ?"
I bet anyone except for the government could build another doordash from scratch right now for under 10 billion dollars (Like Walmart).
Yawn.... low volume algo manipulated runup
Today was a push and pull between real sellers and momentum traders
I see it around 256-260
dash driver marching in front of CEO's home for better pay. Beter get ready for the wheels to fall off of this wagon! Softbank stock manipulators!!!
"DoorDash Trivia: Fact or fiction?Claim: “DoorDash, Inc. operates logistics platform, DoorDash. The Company’s DoorDash platform connects merchants, consumers and Dashers. It offers Pickup that allows consumers to place advance orders, skip lines and pick up their orders. DoorDash for Work provides merchants with group orders and catering orders for businesses and events. Its logistics service, Drive, enables merchants to fulfill consumer demand that they have already created through their channels. DoorDash handles payment acceptance from consumers through a third party payment processor that manages credit card transaction processing. Its merchant software portal allows merchants to track business performance on a number of metrics, including how long a Dasher waits for an order, order accuracy, and reports on incremental sales. It provides customer support for any orders placed through its local logistics platform. Its subscription product, DashPass, serves as a membership program and offers consumers access to merchants.”Fact: DoorDash is nothing more than a money losing delivery company employing several hundred thousand permanently underemployed individuals—a large percentage of which illegally operate unregistered and uninsured vehicles."
here we go not even 700k shares traded softbank self trading club!!!
"While traveling I have been asking at restaurants who they send more meals with and so far there are more Grub Hub, followed by Uber Eats and few Door Dash. Perhaps I am just eating at the wrong places...or..."
Total volume today was 12.7 MILLION SHARES. Average volume has been 2.9 million shares.BOA's just raised price target makes one suspicious!
Doordash has a market cap of 74 billion Ford motor 54 billion gm market cap 74 billion us steel market cap 6 billion a company with a app delivering food is insane you tell me this market is sane which one of these companies will make America great again
I couldn’t be happier with the daily emails I get from (http://Fairstox.com). They give me the best daily advice based on stock market news and help me make wiser decisions when it comes to investing. An absolute must for any investor!
Doordash continues to have major APP problems last year it was out every Friday night for hours---- this year some of the same---- but the last few days their APP was deactivating new drivers after 1 delivery...people also were not getting their orders on time....sounds like thier IT dept is not very good at updating their APP..it is a constant mess---sooner or later it is going to catch up to this overvalued company IMO
"As a restaurant owner, here is my 2 cents:Restaurant job is a tough job, hard to find labor. Every shop's labor is set for its normal production capacity. Dash is for the gap. During the shelter time, the gap is big. When business back to normal, I normally turn off dash for couple hours for a day, and peak hour for lunch plus dinner are 4 hours. The dine in and store pickup always priority over Dash orders since the 25%-30% cut. lots of restaurant post higher price on Dash compare to on its own menu. The average ticket is $50 for store, then only half of it for dash ticket. Dash is mostly for fast food. The less ticket amount the less profit margin for Dash. The management understand all this but how to carry on their 60 billion story? Revenue is growth. To make this happen, they use lots of promotion. That's why more revenue the more expense not profit. But, at least the story can carry on. this won't last long if just domestic, then expand to oversea. But, Dash maintain its driver partly depend on customer tips. Yes, a 60 billion company maintain its workforce depend on tips. What if Japanese don't give tips? The management paint another picture for you: We delivery grocery, flowers......these are all very thin profit margin business. To get driver for those deliver, Dash depend on Tips again to squeeze some margin for themself. Even this, the driver gets fair pay? Dash is very difficult to turn profit if they pay the drivers fairly we all know that. However, Dash cost every Taxpayer and Auto Insurance policy holder for their revenue more or less. The driver drives his own car for this 1099 job. How many of those report to insurance company the detail mileage? I don't know? but that could impact the rate more or less because this mileage. Drivers have no health insurance benefit, and there might be other social benefit associate now or in the future. Who is paying for that? Obviously not Dash. And some poster saying that this is a 500 billion business. Even it is, how many 5 dollar, 6 dollar tickets to make that happen? How much actually cost behind it which is not paid by the company but the Government or the taxpayer would eventually pay for that."
"Tried to order some food yesterday with DoorDash, the price seemed exorbitant at $99 including delivery fee, other fees . Checked the restaurant's web site, the prices were 30% cheaper and picked up myself. The total came to just $67. Do you think I am going to use DoorDash next time unless I was desperate?"
I am so happy this stock is finally back to my short cost. Now hopefully it breaks 200 and the real games begin
"Softbank sells large block at $182.50 and a week later it trades at nearly $195 , in what world does that make since ?"
"Confused about the valuation? Don’t be. The big boy institutions are using mass media and “analysts” (do your own research is my advice) to redirect attention away from earnings reports which are crystal clear: the more revenue DD generates (a large % of which is driven by costly internal promotions) the greater their losses.This is accomplished via myriad methods but the two most common are one, “analysts” setting price targets completely inconsistent with earnings and industry-specific market conditions and two, carefully crafted and engineered PR campaigns targeting retail investors and mutual fund managers to create demand.Once the demand has artificially engineered, the largest institutional holders strangle the supply of available shares creating a supply/demand imbalance in favor of the sellers who then slowly and systematically sell shares throughout the trading day. Trading volume is typically low (just like today) when this is happens.The goal in the end is this: the largest institutional holders of the stock need to sell as many shares as possible for as much as possible before Q3 earnings are reported or the company is the subject of some cataclysmic news event, e.g. DOJ/DOL investigation into labor practices, which should be the beginning of the end for DoorDash and Tony Xu—the latter of whom would be well advised to have his team of criminal defense lawyers ready to go.Who foots the bill in the end for this massive fraud occurring in real-time? The little guys of course. Working class people who make regular contributions to their retirement accounts via mutual funds and unsophisticated retail investors who have been duped into buying one of the greatest lies in the history of Wall Street."
"That’s it, now passed Uber in market cap. Not bad for a pizza delivery app"
One sale and the stock plummets. Wait until a secondary offering. It will be a 20% down day.
"My 21 year old college college kid used DoorDash for the first time today and figured out even after getting their first time user discount how much more it was to use the service. She said never again, she is one and done . Now she was using her money, so other kids her age using daddys money probably would not care what it cost."
I hope you all realize this keeps getting pumped to keep bring in tons of buyers for the Insiders to sell to. You are being scammed by the best in the world...
Almost 10 percent drop today. What will happen tomorrow? 20 percent up. That’s how the crooks make their $$.
"Vegas has this service now.Locovegas.coopWHY LOCO?LoCo Vegas is your local solution for third-party food delivery. Unlike the big guys, we don’t charge high commissions on each purchase to local restaurants who are just trying to get their food out to the customers who love it. Why? Because those local restaurants owners own LoCo Vegas too! That means LoCo Vegas is a sustainable, affordable model for small business owners, it keeps your money in your community and offers better prices and customer service for hungry people like you. So dig in!"
"New reports of restaurants turning off DoorDash tablets to prevent new orders—including national chains like Outback. Why? The small restaurants are likely driven by monetary concerns. Large chains are likely driven by employees that dislike DoorDash as it makes their life easier to simply stop accepting orders.Interestingly, DoorDash sends autonomous notifications to restaurant management to alert them when an employee has disabled DoorDash (closed the store to incoming electronic orders) who in turn call employees in an effort to prevent this.Small, independent restaurants whose owners turn off DoorDash are targeted with monetary incentives to induce them to start accepting orders again."
DASH Senior executives have sold 23 million shares in the last 6 months and not purchased 1 share. This includes the CFO who should know what the company is worth selling in the 150's. This does not include the softbank sale from last week of 11.4 million shares.
It was upgraded yesterday and still closed Red? Wow. Just wow.
Don't Forget its downgraded by Goldman Sachs.
3.5 x the market capitalization of domino’s pizza. This market maker price manipulation will be hard to keep up into Q4.
Best opportunity to short and win big
More headaches for DASH. Walmart to start its own delivery service independent of the Walmart business. Called GoLocal.
"$72 BILLION for a food delivery app (that might cost $10M to produce) company under massive competition from all over with almost no barrier to entry, that loses more money every quarter. Talk about a risky game of Jenga with money."
Any bets that this drops by 12 tomorrow? Too many 210 calls that would print otherwise. Someone is going to lose $15M
"So, SoftBank shows they don’t have confidence in this company as they are unloading shares and your telling me there are other buyers out there who want this awful company? What a load. I’m not selling my puts, I’m holding while this thing bleeds below $120 over the next 30 days because it has to now."
Is there a lock up still in effect by which initial buyers can not sell there shares until this date passes?
Loaded more calls. DASH is the gift that keeps on giving!
180 lets goooo
"So who’s buying Dash as the institutions are ditching it in droves? One possibility are retail investors with the following three defining characteristics:one, they are actual active Dash customer’s amazed at how the company is able to make McDonalds, Wendy’s, and Taco Bell arrive at their door at all hours of the night for free;two, they are betting on another Covid-related lockdown which, even if it were to occur, would simply complicate Dash’s problems as they have retooled their business model to leverage economies of scale (they now have to do 10 deliveries to generate the revenue of the typical pandemic-era delivery) and with less drivers and more small deliveries, the large orders will be significantly delayed;three, they are unsophisticated kids with money in the bank for the first time in their lives due to Covid-related federal unemployment benefits and eviction moratoriums who have, in their infinite wisdom, decided that Dash makes sense (like GameStop and AMC.)In the end, they lose virtually every penny (and will likely be living in their parents’ basements) wondering what went wrong. I suppose they can drive for Dash to make ends meet. :/"
I can’t believe the market is going to allow SoftBank to unload all their shares at these prices.... creating tons of bagholders. They unloaded $2 billion and the price has gone up 10% since? Does no one see the problem with that lmao
We are getting close to the end of the momentum bullrun. I saw it with wayfair at 330’s and zoom and 400’s (this year). We are going to look back in 30 days and say that 220’s were the highs
We are starting to see cracks in the DASH armour only a matter of time before its below 200
I think it's interesting that even with relatively low volatility the DASH options are very expensive on both sides. There is no gamble that makes sense here. The price is fixed right here at this absurd valuation.
The high gas prices will kill this company.
Two firehouse subs: 21.00 Door Dash delivery fee 14.00. Drove the 3.4 miles to pick it up. This company will never be profitable. NEVER
The fact that DASH hasnt positively reacted on this pumper news means that this is going a lot lower......
good luck selling when there are no bids.
Uber and Grubhub are not going to concede the delivery market. Could be a big price war coming!
The manipulation can only go on for so long. This thing isn’t even worth $100 let alone $200.
Every trader should use (http://Fairstox.com)! Their watchlists help me make the best possible stock picks each day. I never start a trading day without their advice!
I’m short everybody! I’ve been waiting since the ipo. I clock forward to posting more about why their revenues are about to decline
DASH = another Softbank Wework 2.0!!!!
Someone just dropped 2M on 190C 9/17s.
"Besides the day Softbank unloaded $2b in stock, today is the first day in awhile when I see weakness in the stock despite the market jumping. Not sure it will mean anything but perhaps a sign."
WHY IS THIS ALWAYS GREEN
"According to a survey of 500 food app delivery workers from Cornell University's Worker Institute, the average hourly wage for a NYC delivery driver, including tips, is $12.21, falling to $7.87 without tips. New York City's minimum wage is $15 an hour for employees.Those low wages have resulted in one-third of delivery drivers working seven days a week and another one-third working six days a week, but despite all the time drivers spend at work, delivery companies aren't making work conditions any better. Around half of the delivery drivers say they've been in an accident or crash while doing deliveries, and three-quarters of those workers paid for the resulting injuries themselves. The lack of protections also harms more than half of the drivers who have experienced bike theft, of which three in 10 were physically assaulted during those incidents."
Insiders dumping on you bulls. This gonna end well. https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/DASH/insider-trades/
"I tried dashing and wasted my 1 hour. Declined many trash orders, and afterwards doordash put me on pause for 10 minutes. I went home with no deliveries. What a waste..."
"Time to buy when insiders are selling and bad news piling on!!!Yes, it's counter intuitive, but that's how it's working nowadays on the Street."
Soggy French fry delivery company keeps going up due to corruption. How is this not a headline?
Almost 4% runnup and no news. Yeah right.
What happen now they are gonna lose another 300 millions that’s why is going up today?
SEC should be looking into serious fraud manipulation here....
We know they manipulated the market but this is almost criminal 255 for a stock that doesn’t make money and probably will never do
DoorTrash cannot deliver food properly with all the trash orders. How are they going to partner up with others?
Did Mr. Yu sell more today?
Now the analysts have a new buzzword to justify the high valuations for our short candidates. It is Total Addressable Market (TAM); earnings per share (EPS) no longer applies. The new metric is supposed to express the underlying potential of the particular product or service. Don't worry folks our day will come when the digested food waste hits the air circulation device. If you have been shopping lately you know that the latest inflation numbers are pure hogwash.
"Last month, Dash up 20+%, Grub down 16%. You’d rhink these boys would ride together?"
With door dash you don't need counterparties to trade. Softbank just trades it with itself and varying intermediaries. I wish I could trade that way!
Be smart folks. Buy and or hold. $DASH $VENA
Buy buy buy!!! Dash is your only hope in a down market!
"Softbank throws blah-blah billion at doordash. Softbank throws blah-blah billion at Uber. Seems like Softbank is saving one to punish the other then vice versa at the end of the day. The net result is both companies waste way too much money. I would too. Softbank will always bail us out anyway, right?"
What gives me confidence that this stock will ultimately breakdown very hard is once a week I see insider selling. Today it was $11 mil sale by the CEO
$DASH being sued in three states New York for commission caps and Chicago for predatory business practices which will also result in commission caps. California and the US government working to declare gig economy workers as full time versus being on contract. Half the normal trading volume and the stock goes up everyday. Nothing to see here.
They had some interesting insights about DASH on (http://Rightpicker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"Look Daddy, this stock is manipulated real bad... Could it be SoftBank. What does Gary Gensler the SEC Chairman think?"
here's a bit of information that you might find interesting. In last year's annual report over 40 pages were devoted to just explaining the potential risks the investing public needs to take into consideration. These points are very well laid out and must conclude that they are laid out for one and only one reason and that is to protect themselves from liability as there is definitely no guarantee that this company will ever be able to really be profitable. And yet here we are with a valuation of over $75 billion. Unimagineable.
"Dash now at this point in the day has a slightly larger market cap than Fedex, now does anyone have a sane argument to justify that ?"
"Door Dash's prospects into 2021, in the best case scenario the stock is priced at approximately 62x forward EBITDA. Are you kidding me?? There is no path to profit. Even if the CEO continues to steal tips from drivers and rips off small businesses and restaurants. With all the uncertainty on economic factors that are outside of its control, not to mention the rapidly increasing competition, it's difficult to argue that the stock is attractively valued."
I am raising target from 250 to 290 !
"Nice pop this morning worthy of an added short. Insiders will be hovering around their keyboards around 10:30 AM EDT to dump another tranche of their shares, and the $DASH will end up around flat for the day."
"How does this company have a larger mkt cap than FedEx? (i know that they are in different business niches and that FDX has a larger EV because of its debt, but really?)And on top of that, insider sales are going through the roof and likely to accelerate given the most recent leg up."
so as a DD driver for the last 3 years the company has done nothing to attract keep their ICs...as a matter of fact they do just the opposite...lowered pay and deactivate for dubious reasons...without warning...they are definitely not driver-friendly...it will catch up to them sooner or later...when a correction does hit this may drop 50%..valuation is way high
"Quick recap of yesterday: SoftBank sale of 20% of holding goes through nearly a % point lower than they wanted, Tony unloaded another load of shares, Walmart announces incoming local delivery business which will directly compete with DoorDash because their is 0 barrier to entry, Phizer gets full approval which further validates the pandemics end is in sight which is only reason DASH seen this growth (and even larger losses). Seems like a great day for this manipulated stock to go green right?"
I can’t stop laughing
