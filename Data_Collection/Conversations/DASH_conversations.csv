Sell this stock. This business model literally isn’t viable
"Gas prices have doubled, if DASH doesn’t offer gas credits to drivers they will lose more drivers. It’s a disaster waiting to happen. Stock really isn’t worth more than $80 a share."
Big drop today
I couldn’t be happier with the daily emails I get from (http://Fairstox.com). They give me the best daily advice based on stock market news and help me make wiser decisions when it comes to investing. An absolute must for any investor!
with dash pass I just saved $24 off my order. Including $9 tip it came to $47.40 for three entrees. And they bring it straight to my door.
What gives me confidence that this stock will ultimately breakdown very hard is once a week I see insider selling. Today it was $11 mil sale by the CEO
Did Mr. Yu sell more today?
Based on the type of day it was in the market I am happy with this performance. Only way this name is going down pre-earnings is a ARK nasdaq selloff (which is due) or company specific news
Lol - $DASH Market Cap up 2.6 Billion today after $115 million in shares traded. Manipulation at its finest. Keep on coming $SFTBY - you don't scare me.
why even pretend. Softbank should just set the closing price in the morning and be done. No need for these shenanigans and pretend trades. Just shut it down and be done with it.
WTRH Let’s see shorts lose 500% or more. See them buy their borrowed shares at a $7 to $10 range…. $GRUB $DASH $WTRH $UBER $LYFTMORGAN STANLEY owns almost 13 million shares of WAITR. M&A buy what acquirer do you foresee???
"As a customer, I don’t see how this company will be in business in 10 years. Just waited an hour for food, then the driver takes a pic of the bag in his car and marks it delivered. Had to go through the process of getting a refund then order from the competition. This isn’t the first time this has happened, but it’s the last time I use this app. I hope you all lose every Penny you have invested in this company for the way they treat customers. You deserve it."
Interesting that insiders are selling their shares.
How the heck is DASH a tech stock? Billionaire Philipe Laffonte has it as his number 1 pick in his top five ‘tech’ stocks.
"Uber has partnered with Tesla. Dash has partnered with Bed, Bath and Beyond."
Whats going on here??
"To those hoping to profit off what intelligent DD drivers know and what the majority of sophisticated retail investors suspect: the company is highly likely doomed.Not 180, not 150, not 100, not 50, and not even 15. It is worthless given current logistical and regulatory constraints (and if you think the recently passed NYC regulations were bad, just wait until the DOL turns its cards face up—NYC was a slap on the wrist.)Tony Xu and his corrupt cadre of executives have fleeced the drivers, the restaurants, and even their customers. It is a textbook example of what can and will go wrong without regulatory oversight.The business growth that DD enjoyed was primarily a function of two variables:one, COVID-19 for self-evident reasons;two, their ability to severely undersell established competitors like GH and UE by engaging in blatantly fraudulent activities that run the gamut—from misappropriation of driver gratuities to employing individuals they know (or have the ability to know) are illegally operating motor vehicles in a commercial capacity under the direct supervision and direction of DD (sometimes across state lines (pay careful attention to that, Mr. Xu as food picked up in Manhattan and transported across the GWB to Jersey City constitutes interstate commerce under federal law.))But the most amazing part of it all is the fact that despite the massive amount and diversity of fraud committed by DoorDash and its executive team, it STILL manages to lose money by the hundreds of millions in an operating environment that simply could not have been more favorable due to the COVID-19 lockdowns.DoorDash and its stock ultimately implodes. It is not a question of if, but rather when. In the interim, Xu and his lieutenants will continue to unjustly enrich themselves on the backs of those who simply lack the sophistication necessary to unravel this massive and tangled web of fraud and deceit.Any individual that purchases this stock—long or short—is playing Russian roulette."
"Who's turn to sell today, Tony or Andy??"
Vaccine for 5 to 11 years old will be approved soon. That's good news for DASH!!?
"I wonder if a guy that steals tips from his drivers, takes the waitress tips off other tables when he out spending his insider sales money?Andy Fang exercised options to purchase 40,000 Doordash shares for $0 on October 12. They then sold their shares on multiple transactions in the open market. They sold at prices ranging from ($0.00) to $203.81 to raise a total of $15,991,570 from the stock sale."
still far away from $50 price target. boring!
So now Dash does almost everything. The can deliver what Amazon can in under a hour? That's wild just to think about. I need tweezers. Doordash tweezers. Lol. I see a quick buy out here maybe. My opinion.
can anyone justify 66 billion for this company?
"Gas prices doubled, inflation skyrocketing. People aren’t going to pay an extra $15-20 to have a Big Mac delivered very much longer. Short this stock!!!"
pff just sold it in time..next up $GRUB hopefully they will double soon :-)
Falling like a rock !!
I know something no one knows. but I am not telling. lol. you should hold is all I'm saying.
Little worried about DD. Word has it the base pay has dropped to poverty levels. Expecting drivers to absorb vehicle maintenance costs is unsustainable and quality drivers will drop out. They should be mindful of the competition and take care of drivers.
I spoke to a fund manager today and asked him what do funds think about analyst upgrades... he said the bigger the company the more incentive their is for an analyst to have a buy rating out so that they use their firm on mergers and offerings.... DASH is crazily overvalued and analysts cant lower their PT because of softbank and DASH mgmt
"Everyone whom I've seen working for door dash looked homeless, living out of their barely running car, with expired tags, bald tires, and a cracked windshield."
stock should really be trading closer to 20....6 billion market cap
"I'm currently driver of Doordash and they pay us ridiculously low. hopefully, they'll change this otherwise if you invest in here you will just lose money. I keep skipping orders cuz it's not worth the time taking it thus customers will be dissatisfied. if people are dissatisfied most likely your business won't be successful."
"No matter what the amount, any tip is a good tip and you should say THANK YOU. But a Door Dash driver took back the food because the tip was only 8 dollars for a 12 mile delivery. What is the cost of delivering food? Not high enough to EVER make a profit and not even close for a 72 billion dollar valuation of a terrible company. This will end. People will not pay more for delivery and tip then the cost of the food. I realize this stock price is currently controlled by institutions and hedge funds squeezing investors that know that unprofitable companies will eventually be worth zero. The reputation of this company is terrible. The valuation is a joke and soon, the restaurants that feel they have no choice will get tired of this terrible service. DASH TO ZERO."
DASH looks like it is about to drop. Be careful guys. I have been reading http://the-alphatrader.com/ and their stocks have been doing way better.
This company will be bankrupt in 2 years. Guaranteed. Mark this post.
"So me and my wife stop to get a quick bite at a local restaurant and this guy comes in that looks like he belongs to a Mexican gang , complete with full body gang tattoos and wife beater t-shirt and sagging shorts and goes to the counter to pick up an order, now the guy seemed nice enough and had his young son with him and I have learned a long time ago not to judge a book by it's cover . He got his order and left , but about 15 mins latter he is back and that is when I realized he was a DoorDash driver, now I know this guy is probably a cool dude but I just wonder what some of the Karens out there think when they see him get out of his car in front of their high dollar house to deliver their DoorDash order. DoorDash drivers definitely come in all different types."
I am considering writing a seeking alpha article on why dash is a great short. It would be based on 4 reasons. 1.Valuation 2. Labor shortage/wage hikes 3. Rising oil costs 4. Government regulation. Do you think I should take 2 hours of my life to do this?
"Of course. The moment l got in, it has been dropping. The story of my life. Thinking after an upgrade, l won’t miss this time. Got in @ 205. Hasn’t seen it go up afterwards. Why people are dumping it ?"
"Any big drop in the market could result in banks selling Softbanks colaterlized shares, leading to a mass rush for the exit. Perhaps with bad earnings?"
180 lets goooo
