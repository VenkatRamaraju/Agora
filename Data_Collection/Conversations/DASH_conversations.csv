"Going up on low volume, which means it can fall back very easily , the ugly has just begun in the stock market ."
What happen now they are gonna lose another 300 millions that’s why is going up today?
"It’s so hilarious how this company has this valuation honestly, once the next earnings comes out and once again they show how good they are at losing money this will finally come down. By then, I’m sure SoftBank will have unloaded all their shares onto these poor bagholders holding $200+ shares when the share price drops to $80"
This NYC councel ruling was bad for dash right?
"Want to see manipulation? Just go look at the open interest on tomorrow’s 195 calls and 185 puts.... 0% chance this stock could ever leave this range when considering that. If something drives price up, Softbank will sell it down. If something drives price down, SoftBank will just buy it back up. 100% illegal, if the SEC just looked into who is buying and when, and who has the open option positions on this stock it would be simple to prove manipulation."
Good bye to a 67 BILLION dollar valuation to a company that will never be profitable.HELLO DASH PASS !!!!!!
Softbank trying their best to keep up the pump.....Insiders are going to foil their plan....lol
I bet anyone except for the government could build another doordash from scratch right now for under 10 billion dollars (Like Walmart).
Remarkable strength. Give DASH underwriters a raise.
Doordash to the moon
Lol - $DASH Market Cap up 2.6 Billion today after $115 million in shares traded. Manipulation at its finest. Keep on coming $SFTBY - you don't scare me.
"I wonder if a guy that steals tips from his drivers, takes the waitress tips off other tables when he out spending his insider sales money?Andy Fang exercised options to purchase 40,000 Doordash shares for $0 on October 12. They then sold their shares on multiple transactions in the open market. They sold at prices ranging from ($0.00) to $203.81 to raise a total of $15,991,570 from the stock sale."
So lets compare Dash to Fedex.Dash market cap $71 BillionFedex market cap $68 BillionOne of these companies is either severely undervalued or one of these companies is severely overvalued.Which one is it??
I hope you all realize this keeps getting pumped to keep bring in tons of buyers for the Insiders to sell to. You are being scammed by the best in the world...
"I see everybody on this board saying Doordash is grossly overvalued or a doomed company. However, this is far from true. Doordash already has an operating cash flow margin of 14%. Additionally, unlike their competitors they have high quality growth which is why their gross margins are improving year over year, they have over 55% of the growing delivery market in the U.S., and have a pristine balance sheet with a cash/total liability ratio of almost 3X. On top of this, with growing revenues and consolidation in the industry they will be able to lower their fees and improve their competitive edge and compete with restaurants rolling out their in house delivery systems."
The “upgrade” was based on an unachievable 2026 revenue estimate. It’s a pump. What analysts give a price target based on a hypothetical 5 year out scenario ? Last ditch effort to pump. I’m expecting dash to do a secondary any day now.
Looking forward to the next pumper fake news from dash today!
Uber has the same food business at DASH plus the largest ride share and transportation on the planet and DASH is almost worth more than UBER. Let that sink in … dash should be around $100 and I believe it will get there by EOY
"Be patient shorts... I keep saying it. Let them manipulate it higher before entering, just means bigger gains after the inevitable drop."
This seems to be like GME and AMC.
"Nice pop this morning worthy of an added short. Insiders will be hovering around their keyboards around 10:30 AM EDT to dump another tranche of their shares, and the $DASH will end up around flat for the day."
"I simply can’t believe they allow this thing to trade like this and they do 0 about it, LMAO"
Don't Forget its downgraded by Goldman Sachs.
Why would you buy Doordash when $UBER is sitting at around the same valuation. They have 5xs the revenue and a much more diversified biz. Way overpriced stock.
Needs to close below 214
I’ll take one for the team and buy some shares Monday so it’ll drop down to a reasonable price.
"DASH ACCOUNTING ISSUESThese issues are not illegal, but are something to be aware of. All are found in DASH’s shareholder report dated August 12, 2021.1. In the quarter ending June 30, 2021, DASH had $175M in stock-based compensation expenses. This amount is not counted in cash flow or Adjusted EBITDA, yet it is a real expense.2. Sales and Marketing expenses increased to $427M from $168M in the prior year quarter. I believe a big portion of this increase was for driver incentives to recruit enough drivers. If this had been classified as a cost of revenue, the gross profit margin would have been much lower.3. Note that cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities combined decreased approximately $200M in the first six months of this year. The company is burning cash."
It’s like printing money!!!
"Look Daddy, this stock is manipulated real bad... Could it be SoftBank. What does Gary Gensler the SEC Chairman think?"
Great pairs trade: Short DASH with a P/S of 18 and buy UBER with a P/S of 6.
"This is a disaster in the making. Soaring gas prices. Soggy, cold deliveries. Competition galore. What could go wrong?"
Only in this market would a non profitable company see it's market cap increase nearly 7b in a week when it's net revenue is only around 4b... no logic whatsoever.
"the best solution is to avoid this stock, let the institution play by themself. You can never make money on this one doesn't matter you long or short. The institution controls the volume and their cost base is so low. They can make money on any situation except the stock loses liquidity totally. just not worth it to bet on this one."
"I'm currently driver of Doordash and they pay us ridiculously low. hopefully, they'll change this otherwise if you invest in here you will just lose money. I keep skipping orders cuz it's not worth the time taking it thus customers will be dissatisfied. if people are dissatisfied most likely your business won't be successful."
"Amazing. Money printer at feds might be going brrrrrrrr, but the money burning furnace at door dash is going vrooooooommm."
"How does this company have a larger mkt cap than FedEx? (i know that they are in different business niches and that FDX has a larger EV because of its debt, but really?)And on top of that, insider sales are going through the roof and likely to accelerate given the most recent leg up."
"Its not how much revenue you make, its how much of that revenue you keep!!Dash is very good at increasing revenue, but not so good at keeping any of it........."
"Time to buy when insiders are selling and bad news piling on!!!Yes, it's counter intuitive, but that's how it's working nowadays on the Street."
"If you liquidated Fedex you would get billions of dollars from cash, hardware, buildings, and materials etc. What would DASH be worth to liquidate? Nothing! How are these two companies valued the same? Answer, they should not be!!!"
Any longs are fooling themselves to think that dash is a company worth over 50 billion. I am so happy I was $3 million short this thing at 206 (documented in this chatboard) and held out the ride to 225. 180 here we come!
"Negative earnings. Missing earnings expectations. Diluting shares every quarter. By all means, do buy more. Lol!"
Almost 10 percent drop today. What will happen tomorrow? 20 percent up. That’s how the crooks make their $$.
"Its so hard to decide on which company to choose. 1. Doordash with their sophisticated logistics approach to delivery. Reminds me of my newspaper delivery days!2. Fedex with their old school delivery using wasteful trucks/planes/trains to move our stuff.One makes money and one loses money, so which do we choose??The money losing one of course, thats why dash has a much higher valuation the fdx!!crazy times.......think ill buy a peloton"
"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The New York City Council on Thursday approved legislation to license food-delivery apps including Grubhub, DoorDash Inc and Uber Eats and to permanently cap commissions they can charge restaurants.The companies say the price controls are unfair and vowed to fight them."
"I've been short for awhile, and despite firmly believing this stock should be closer to $50 and will get there eventually, it is so obviously manipulated that it is impossible to time it. I see Softbank and others trying to rotate out, hence the big block sales especially in the morning and near the close, but mutual funds are consistently buying via algo buys all day, keep the price up. This will eventually decline, most likely when the Nasdaq dumps and institutions run for cover, but when that happens in this irrational market is anyone's guess. Long term puts are probably the safest way to play it."
The fact that DASH hasnt positively reacted on this pumper news means that this is going a lot lower......
We are starting to see cracks in the DASH armour only a matter of time before its below 200
"As tempting as it is to buy puts... be patient my friends. They still have $3.5b on the balance sheet from the IPO.... however from dec 31 to June 30 they managed to burn over $1b in cash. If this pace maintains, will likely be best off to buy puts/short next April/May although it’s entirely possible they’ve ramped up the Burb rate this q. Institutions won’t sell until this cash falls off the balance sheet... although it 100% will given this company will never earn a penny."
"This is the prime company to short, 65B for food delivery"
For me my longs are up and dash is only up below 1% thats fine. This stock is weak...
I can’t stop laughing
Justeattakeaway's revenue= 2.042 billion USDDoordash's revenue= 2.886 billion USD.Justeattakeaway's market cap= 14.17 billion USDDoordash's market cap= 74.52 billion USD.Wth is happening here?
"Softbank throws blah-blah billion at doordash. Softbank throws blah-blah billion at Uber. Seems like Softbank is saving one to punish the other then vice versa at the end of the day. The net result is both companies waste way too much money. I would too. Softbank will always bail us out anyway, right?"
"I expected the Dash longs to be quite today on this board, but not even hearing any crowing out of the shorts."
"There must be a reasonable explanation why or how is Doordash worth $12.5 Billion more than Fedex??Dash m. cap $73.3 billionFedex m. cap $60.8 billionPE ratioDash........funny, never ever made a profit!Fdx , PE 13Makes me want to hop on a bike and start delivering!!"
"Here's a nice little comparison. Door Dash is now valued at more then Darden restaurants AND Yum brands. These two companies are the holders of Pizza Hut, KFC, Taco Bell for Yum Brands and Darden's is the parent company of Olive Gardens, Outback Steakhouse and numerous other restaurant chains. Isn't it just amazing how a company that has virtually no assets and even more important, no earnings can be valued at more then some of the largest restaurant companies that they are dependent on delivery orders from?"
Any bets that this drops by 12 tomorrow? Too many 210 calls that would print otherwise. Someone is going to lose $15M
"Oh my God, I hadn’t checked this in a while. Finally loading puts again."
DASH Senior executives have sold 23 million shares in the last 6 months and not purchased 1 share. This includes the CFO who should know what the company is worth selling in the 150's. This does not include the softbank sale from last week of 11.4 million shares.
Best opportunity to short and win big
PTON and DASH are doing really well Chuck
"That’s it, now passed Uber in market cap. Not bad for a pizza delivery app"
Doordash has a market cap of 74 billion Ford motor 54 billion gm market cap 74 billion us steel market cap 6 billion a company with a app delivering food is insane you tell me this market is sane which one of these companies will make America great again
"This was originally posted after Q2 earnings. I will post chapter two later today in light of the wire services’ coverage of DD’s introduction of alcohol delivery.DoorDash University: Pump & Dump 101–an introduction to stock pricing manipulation.Instructor: Tony Xu, CEO DoorDashGraduate student assistant: Yun Li, markets reporter for CNBC et al.Course syllabus: in this class you will learn the basic concepts of manipulating the price of DoorDash stock to benefit yourself at the expense of others. At the end of this course you should be able to:1. leverage mass media contacts to disseminate by proxy untimely and irrelevant information in an effort to frame public discourse while redirecting attention away from abysmal earnings reports that would otherwise have a negative material affect on the price of DoorDash stock;2. conceal this behavior from regulatory agencies tasked with enforcement and compliance of federal securities laws;3. Unjustly enrich yourself and your friends at the expense of retail investors who have made direct and indirect purchases of DoorDash stock through retail investment accounts and mutual fund allocations, respectively.Chapter One: Leveraging CNBC TechCheck...After releasing a disastrous quarterly earnings report that clearly indicates DoorDash GAAP EPS losses are accelerating, it is highly advisable to have the CEO conduct an interview with a CNBC reporter utilizing the TechCheck format. The CNBC reporter should be briefed prior to conducting the interview on talking points favorable to DoorDash while avoiding those of a critical nature that may focus unwanted attention on issues material to the future performance of DoorDash stock.Here is an example of a good talking point: “Tony, let’s talk about how DoorDash is going to make lots of money for investors by refocusing its resources on grocery delivery and bringing InstaCart to its knees.”Conversely, here is an example of a bad talking point: “Tony, your Q2 2021 earnings report indicated that DoorDash EPS losses accelerated using GAAP standards while you and your executive team were selling DoorDash stock as fast as you could. Now how do you explain that?”Chapter Summary: like the old saying goes, if you keep repeating the lie over and over again, people will start to believe it. Using mass media and press sycophants to sell the lie by proxy is an efficient and persuasive method to artificially drive stock prices higher while DoorDash executives make millions by dumping their stock to unsuspecting and unsophisticated retail and institutional investors.Chapter Two to follow in a future post..."
This type of business will be met with government regulations. Salaries/benefits/and whatever else they believe 1099 individuals don't have. The climate will have a negative impact for everyone involved.
That was a nice artificial pump. They’re doing everything in their power to keep this poop ship afloat.
"Well.. as you all know now, I have lost a lot of money shorting Doordash. I then bought puts in July thinking it was going to tank under $130….. it is now almost $200 so… I currently hold November puts at a strike of $170 and I am getting out of my position. This obviously won’t ever go under $180 again (not this year at least) so as soon as this touches $185 or so, I’m selling at a loss and getting out. Clearly this stock is manipulated and controlled by hedge funds and they are all super long on this.- Lawsuits- Insiders selling- Earnings loss- Never produced a profit- Prop 22 ruled unconstitutionalAnd yet… this stock is on its way to $200.. (up 27% in the past month or 3 months.. something like that)That is ILLOGICAL and deserves an investigation. But whatever.. good luck to all the bears who are stronger than me."
"I’ve been curious how Chipolte, a simple fast food shop, can continuously have stock price at such an elevated P/E. Just noticed that 90+% of their stock is institutionally owned. Similar club to Dash. Would be interesting to see list of all $50B+ companies that are vastly owned by institutional investors, to stay clear of"
"Dash current market cap 74 billion on 4 billion of revenue, Fedex current market cap 60 billion on 84 billion revenue . Either Fedex is way undervalued or Dash is way over valued, you tell me."
Two firehouse subs: 21.00 Door Dash delivery fee 14.00. Drove the 3.4 miles to pick it up. This company will never be profitable. NEVER
"DoorTrash went past the moon, and next target is Mars!! They will colonized mars and charge fees to deliver rocks.."
I literally couldn't imagine buying this at $100. It's a $40 stock under the most optimistic cash flow circumstances. They will easily burn through their cash by next summer at this rate.
"Last month, Dash up 20+%, Grub down 16%. You’d rhink these boys would ride together?"
"Restaurants are beginning to close their dining rooms and become take out/delivery only due to staffing reasons. Doordash conquers those kinds of issues. Next time you’re at a Panera Bread, take a look at their setup. If you’re having these issues, why not simply downsize your restaurant and give the customers what they want…which is takeout and Doordash delivery. Delivery is the future…period."
More headaches for DASH. Walmart to start its own delivery service independent of the Walmart business. Called GoLocal.
Today was a push and pull between real sellers and momentum traders
GrubHub with better financials is valued 35% off this.
"$65.3b soggy fry delivery company. I REPEAT, $65.3 BILLION SOGGY FRY DELIVERY COMPANY!!! DO YOU NOT SEE THE PROBLEM WITH THIS LOL?"
Watch this jump when Dash starts delivering weed!
Let's see if Dash ends the day under the $200 mark .
Is there a lock up still in effect by which initial buyers can not sell there shares until this date passes?
"If you short DASH, you will lose because the HOUSE hold over 90% of the shares outstanding. It is the bestlong candidate regardless of fundamental or over valuation. Every short will be squeezed going forward."
"Besides the day Softbank unloaded $2b in stock, today is the first day in awhile when I see weakness in the stock despite the market jumping. Not sure it will mean anything but perhaps a sign."
I am on the sidelines but this stock is worth no more than $30/sh under the most optimistic income projections. Could be the most overvalued exchange listed company. There will be a Wile-E-Coyote moment where the bottom literally falls out and nothing to brace the price collapse. That's when I jump in for the elevator ride down.
Goldman Sachs issues price target neutral $187
"Who's turn to sell today, Tony or Andy??"
Volume now 14.8 million shares w/ after hours.
The manipulation can only go on for so long. This thing isn’t even worth $100 let alone $200.
"I’ve officially closed out my long position. Sold too early / on the way up, but DoorDash treated me wel"
loaded up on puts today!
"My 21 year old college college kid used DoorDash for the first time today and figured out even after getting their first time user discount how much more it was to use the service. She said never again, she is one and done . Now she was using her money, so other kids her age using daddys money probably would not care what it cost."
"Thanks for another successful transaction of $25, 000. I'm so glad trading in your platform FacebookStephanie A William"
"New reports of restaurants turning off DoorDash tablets to prevent new orders—including national chains like Outback. Why? The small restaurants are likely driven by monetary concerns. Large chains are likely driven by employees that dislike DoorDash as it makes their life easier to simply stop accepting orders.Interestingly, DoorDash sends autonomous notifications to restaurant management to alert them when an employee has disabled DoorDash (closed the store to incoming electronic orders) who in turn call employees in an effort to prevent this.Small, independent restaurants whose owners turn off DoorDash are targeted with monetary incentives to induce them to start accepting orders again."
The high gas prices will kill this company.
This is one of the most manipulated stock......It will never be profitable but hedge funds trade it back and forth to run the value up way past even outrageous. So now they will sell alcohol?? So now a 20 year old driver will put the company in bankruptcy for serving delivery booze to underage customers willing to pay 20 dollars for delivery of a 20 dollar six pack of bud light. What a joke. Out of business in a year.
Picked up some $215 puts expiring tomorrow. Over 5000 open interest on $210 calls. Institutions won't let them expire deep ITM... IMO!
We are getting close to the end of the momentum bullrun. I saw it with wayfair at 330’s and zoom and 400’s (this year). We are going to look back in 30 days and say that 220’s were the highs
Falling like a rock !!
$DASH being sued in three states New York for commission caps and Chicago for predatory business practices which will also result in commission caps. California and the US government working to declare gig economy workers as full time versus being on contract. Half the normal trading volume and the stock goes up everyday. Nothing to see here.
"To those hoping to profit off what intelligent DD drivers know and what the majority of sophisticated retail investors suspect: the company is highly likely doomed.Not 180, not 150, not 100, not 50, and not even 15. It is worthless given current logistical and regulatory constraints (and if you think the recently passed NYC regulations were bad, just wait until the DOL turns its cards face up—NYC was a slap on the wrist.)Tony Xu and his corrupt cadre of executives have fleeced the drivers, the restaurants, and even their customers. It is a textbook example of what can and will go wrong without regulatory oversight.The business growth that DD enjoyed was primarily a function of two variables:one, COVID-19 for self-evident reasons;two, their ability to severely undersell established competitors like GH and UE by engaging in blatantly fraudulent activities that run the gamut—from misappropriation of driver gratuities to employing individuals they know (or have the ability to know) are illegally operating motor vehicles in a commercial capacity under the direct supervision and direction of DD (sometimes across state lines (pay careful attention to that, Mr. Xu as food picked up in Manhattan and transported across the GWB to Jersey City constitutes interstate commerce under federal law.))But the most amazing part of it all is the fact that despite the massive amount and diversity of fraud committed by DoorDash and its executive team, it STILL manages to lose money by the hundreds of millions in an operating environment that simply could not have been more favorable due to the COVID-19 lockdowns.DoorDash and its stock ultimately implodes. It is not a question of if, but rather when. In the interim, Xu and his lieutenants will continue to unjustly enrich themselves on the backs of those who simply lack the sophistication necessary to unravel this massive and tangled web of fraud and deceit.Any individual that purchases this stock—long or short—is playing Russian roulette."
"Christopher Payne (President and COO) and Andy Fang, who I believe recently appeared on CNBC hyping the company, have both sold $millions of stock in the past couple of months. Look at InsiderBuyingSelling for the exact amounts."
3.5 x the market capitalization of domino’s pizza. This market maker price manipulation will be hard to keep up into Q4.
"As someone that does delivery for doordash, it actually makes me wonder, first off, since the vast majority of times the orders are not ready when we go to pick them up, one has to just sit back and ask themself, who's going to take the order to the car? Whose going to take the order from the car to the customer's door? When a customer uses a delivery service to place an order, they are expecting service. That means timely and efficient delivery of their order. We keep hearing about autonomous electric cars, but the day will come when they are not they are made out to be. One of the reasons that auto company in the world is trying to get into the electric self driving cars, isn't for the profits from the car but more importantly the constant revenue stream they are going to get from owners to update the software such as the mapping necessary to even think about autonomous driving. Next, anyone that thinks they are going to get away without having to pay highway taxes, which are collected from the sale of gasoline is dreaming. There is already talk about charging a per mile fee, tax to offset the loss revenue from more efficient autos and now the electric cars."
Why is a delivery service platform trading at a price to sales of 16?
As a short I dont like this deal they signed today. People can say they are like instacart and they get a higher valuation
Soggy French fry delivery company keeps going up due to corruption. How is this not a headline?
Anyone here know how much Meituan is worth? Spoiler alert: a lot more than $60b
What will the manipulated trading range be this week for DoorTrash?
Cramer says buy DASH now in full speed. Way to go!!!
"Raise driver pay by alot. Force Uber to do the same. Make Uber unable to put eats profits to cover uberx losses. Uber forced to sell eats. Doordash buys Ubereats and controls market and stock goes to 1k. Don't race to bottom, race to top."
Be smart folks. Buy and or hold. $DASH $VENA
I still think buying a home is the best investment any individual can make..
Doordash continues to have major APP problems last year it was out every Friday night for hours---- this year some of the same---- but the last few days their APP was deactivating new drivers after 1 delivery...people also were not getting their orders on time....sounds like thier IT dept is not very good at updating their APP..it is a constant mess---sooner or later it is going to catch up to this overvalued company IMO
Dash model will never make money! Restaurant profits from the alcohol sales not food. Margins aren’t there. The paid for analyst can make up any story and disappear before earnings. Happens all the time.
haha Ok now what? Who is gonna buy all these massively over priced shares? Who?
SEC should be looking into serious fraud manipulation here....
Nuclear war could happen and DASH would still be green. Most manipulated stock ever.
DASH = another Softbank Wework 2.0!!!!
"Longs, best opportunity of the year to buy Dash! so strong!!!"
I am so happy this stock is finally back to my short cost. Now hopefully it breaks 200 and the real games begin
75b market cap lmao. Who is acc buying at these levels ?
Total trashy manipulation. Are the giving SoftBank the Gold Medal for driving the price up and paying off analysts?
"Great week very good start... if you look at other high flying names their off 20-30% off their highs... zm, roku, pton, etc. this will get to below 170 soon"
Yawn.... low volume algo manipulated runup
Buy buy buy!!! Dash is your only hope in a down market!
"I tried dashing and wasted my 1 hour. Declined many trash orders, and afterwards doordash put me on pause for 10 minutes. I went home with no deliveries. What a waste..."
Volumes speak volumes. Check the key view. Short volume (owed for) from July 15 + topped 13.3 million shares. The institutional ownership is over 91%. Which way we going?
So now we know who has been propping this up. Made up analysis by BOA.
"....And another 150,000 shares sold by insiders 8/30/21 SEC 8K reports. Never ends!!!!"
"Dash now at this point in the day has a slightly larger market cap than Fedex, now does anyone have a sane argument to justify that ?"
It was upgraded yesterday and still closed Red? Wow. Just wow.
Insiders dumping on you bulls. This gonna end well. https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/DASH/insider-trades/
low volume pump again! I sold married put today:)
180 lets goooo
"Wal-Mart teaming up with Ford to come up with AI deliveries, Now how will that impact Dashes model since is depends on real people using their worn out vehicles to deliver for them ."
"I wish selling short was not so addicting. Just when I thought that this was a sure thing the market does just the opposite. This stock is up about 18 % since August 2nd, unbelievable!"
Now the analysts have a new buzzword to justify the high valuations for our short candidates. It is Total Addressable Market (TAM); earnings per share (EPS) no longer applies. The new metric is supposed to express the underlying potential of the particular product or service. Don't worry folks our day will come when the digested food waste hits the air circulation device. If you have been shopping lately you know that the latest inflation numbers are pure hogwash.
What happened??
I spoke to a fund manager today and asked him what do funds think about analyst upgrades... he said the bigger the company the more incentive their is for an analyst to have a buy rating out so that they use their firm on mergers and offerings.... DASH is crazily overvalued and analysts cant lower their PT because of softbank and DASH mgmt
"Oh I see, now I can get my booze delivered with my pizza, so now I totally get why this at the value it is"
"Question: if DoorDash has over a million active drivers and an established logistics application, why on earth do they not expand into a the rideshare segment of the market just as Uber entered the delivery business?Makes all the sense in the world, right?Answer: because a substantial percentage (perhaps as high as 70% based upon analytical estimates) of all DoorDash drivers are driving non-insured/under-insured vehicles without proper registration in blatant violation of state and, perhaps, federal laws (RICCO).DoorDash can’t enter into rideshare as they know it will bring additional attention and scrutiny to their already substantially illegal labor force.A WARNING TO DOORDASH: every incident where an individual uses your application and makes false statements about their legal status to operate vehicles on local, county, state, and federal roadways constitutes federal wire fraud under Section 18, 1343 USC. You are not only complicit in these illegal acts, but encourage them as well.A WARNING TO COMPANIES WHO SUBCONTRACT WITH DOORDASH: you are equally complicit by in these illegal activities."
$30 stock
These prices are looking too good not to short. Overvalued.
Anyone know who’s propping this up??
"Dash should just buy FedEx, since they’ll soon be delivering beds and dressers, they’ll need bigger vehicles than Dasher bikes and scooters."
We know they manipulated the market but this is almost criminal 255 for a stock that doesn’t make money and probably will never do
"$72 BILLION for a food delivery app (that might cost $10M to produce) company under massive competition from all over with almost no barrier to entry, that loses more money every quarter. Talk about a risky game of Jenga with money."
Total volume today was 12.7 MILLION SHARES. Average volume has been 2.9 million shares.BOA's just raised price target makes one suspicious!
"Of course. The moment l got in, it has been dropping. The story of my life. Thinking after an upgrade, l won’t miss this time. Got in @ 205. Hasn’t seen it go up afterwards. Why people are dumping it ?"
How do you know when the music stops? Are they gonna tell you?
Almost 4% runnup and no news. Yeah right.
Timber
"Goldman says 187 target and the stock goes up, BA says a buy and it goes up even more... now worth more than Uber, go figure"
My price unchanged at $50. Hope they pump this to $255 so I will short more.
"Up 5.66 with 45 min to go. If typical, selling starts soon and this will drop at least $3-4 to end the day."
Imagine $SOLO and door $DASH partnership   
Didn't they guide a slow ?
"According to a survey of 500 food app delivery workers from Cornell University's Worker Institute, the average hourly wage for a NYC delivery driver, including tips, is $12.21, falling to $7.87 without tips. New York City's minimum wage is $15 an hour for employees.Those low wages have resulted in one-third of delivery drivers working seven days a week and another one-third working six days a week, but despite all the time drivers spend at work, delivery companies aren't making work conditions any better. Around half of the delivery drivers say they've been in an accident or crash while doing deliveries, and three-quarters of those workers paid for the resulting injuries themselves. The lack of protections also harms more than half of the drivers who have experienced bike theft, of which three in 10 were physically assaulted during those incidents."
"We may have picked the wrong stock to short. DASH is a CNBC Disruptor 50 stock so they are going to keep this stock propped up every chance they get. My comment gets deleted if I post the link but head over to CNBC and search for DASH and you will see the article published yesterday, Sept 23 and the comments by Cramer on Sept 21."
"I can’t wait until this earnings when once again, DASH reveals to the world they will never be profitable... model just doesn’t work as consumers only use it now cause a company is willing to deliver food to their doors at a loss!!! "
I think it's interesting that even with relatively low volatility the DASH options are very expensive on both sides. There is no gamble that makes sense here. The price is fixed right here at this absurd valuation.
What gives me confidence that this stock will ultimately breakdown very hard is once a week I see insider selling. Today it was $11 mil sale by the CEO
dash driver marching in front of CEO's home for better pay. Beter get ready for the wheels to fall off of this wagon! Softbank stock manipulators!!!

"This is not quantum physics. A very small cadre of institutional investors control almost all of the stock. Anybody with any degree of common sense knows that this is a fundamentally doomed company—including the institutional investors.So, if you are an institution and you want to cash out, how do you sell 90% of the outstanding shares without driving the price down on your way out the door?Enter an incremental exiting strategy.Institutional actors limit the daily supply of shares available which, when coupled with speculative COVID-19-related retail demand, has driven the share price progressively higher.In a perfect world, the institutions would continue this strategy while they unload a couple million shares per day ad infinitum until they had sufficiently exited their long positions while profiting off options underwriting in the interim (that alone—if anything—should draw the scrutiny of federal regulators.)The only problem with this strategy is that it is time-dependent and the institutions know that DASH is likely to have burned through most of its cash by Q2 2022. Further, it is arguable that there is sufficient retail demand to absorb supply longitudinally.DASH’s Q3 earnings are likely to show accelerated losses and declining revenue which, when coupled with the eventual decline of speculative COVID-related demand, should create substantial downward pricing pressure.Nevertheless, it is likely that institutions will continue to drive DASH shares higher over the next 60 days systematically exiting long positions absorbed by unsophisticated retail investors while simultaneously profiting off of options underwriting activities.Of course, and as I have cautioned before, regulatory intervention could occur at any time. If it does, the potential for losses for those with long positions will know almost no limits. Conversely, potential profits for those short will also be extraordinary."
eventually automated delivery will happen and all these people will be out of work. That will take things into the stratosphere
here's a bit of information that you might find interesting. In last year's annual report over 40 pages were devoted to just explaining the potential risks the investing public needs to take into consideration. These points are very well laid out and must conclude that they are laid out for one and only one reason and that is to protect themselves from liability as there is definitely no guarantee that this company will ever be able to really be profitable. And yet here we are with a valuation of over $75 billion. Unimagineable.
"Vegas has this service now.Locovegas.coopWHY LOCO?LoCo Vegas is your local solution for third-party food delivery. Unlike the big guys, we don’t charge high commissions on each purchase to local restaurants who are just trying to get their food out to the customers who love it. Why? Because those local restaurants owners own LoCo Vegas too! That means LoCo Vegas is a sustainable, affordable model for small business owners, it keeps your money in your community and offers better prices and customer service for hungry people like you. So dig in!"
One sale and the stock plummets. Wait until a secondary offering. It will be a 20% down day.
DoorTrash cannot deliver food properly with all the trash orders. How are they going to partner up with others?
Nasdaq up 1% and dash ends day flat.... lets go!!
Big drop today
Uber and Grubhub are not going to concede the delivery market. Could be a big price war coming!
"Tried to order some food yesterday with DoorDash, the price seemed exorbitant at $99 including delivery fee, other fees . Checked the restaurant's web site, the prices were 30% cheaper and picked up myself. The total came to just $67. Do you think I am going to use DoorDash next time unless I was desperate?"
so as a DD driver for the last 3 years the company has done nothing to attract keep their ICs...as a matter of fact they do just the opposite...lowered pay and deactivate for dubious reasons...without warning...they are definitely not driver-friendly...it will catch up to them sooner or later...when a correction does hit this may drop 50%..valuation is way high
Did Mr. Yu sell more today?
