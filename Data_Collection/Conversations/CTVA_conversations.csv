"Corteva is easily the best of the Dupont spinoffs... This will be $40+/- in 12-18 months and will continue to grow nicely long term from there. Profits will really take off in 2023 when the $1B annual RoundUp licensing fee expires. Folks worried about a couple bucks near term are going to miss out on the huge gains longer term. I'll start buy more if/when we see $24-ish prices again. If not, I'm happy with what I already own."
"Starboard shills - you want to change management at CTVA, a company that is barely 18 months old and its management team has weathered 3 major crises - down cycle in major commercial crops (e.g. corn soybeans), the crazy tarriffs with China that essentially gave the US China Soybean market to Brazil, and the Pandemic - and still the stock has risen 40% while the S&P is up less than half that. The only reason Starboard wants at CTVA is to break it up and leave it in pieces for short term gain. This looming proxy fight is going to distract and undermine the company's efforts to exploit all the progress it has made - shame"
Hope it goes up and up
I believe CTVA is roughly 20% undervalued here.Great LT hold.
What if any does this stock pay on dividends? there is no information on the ticker it says N/A
Sure glad I sold
Seed orders should be rolling in...Looks to be a big year!
"I was just looking through their annual report and trying to decipher it. To me it's unreadable and impossible to get even a vague understanding of this company's financials. What stands out to me are the restructuring and integration costs, plus their huge amount of goodwill. You would think that after years of planning the split-up of DowDu most of these charges would already been taken care of. Has anybody else looked at the report."
"I initiated a position in CTVA today @ $29.50. Only purchased about 15% of desired position, so more than happy if the shares drop further as I plan to average in over the coming weeks, months and maybe even years. Corteva is so well positioned long term IMO. Fully expect them to build on the areas they already lead in and to overtake Bayer/Monsanto in the others in due time. Good luck CTVA longs."
Too expensive
For now I am sticking with current management and their slate of directors. The company has hardly had time to perform on its own and COVID has not helped.
when do you think all the changes will be done
Dang good quarter!

Trying to wrap my mind around this new company. This is my only ag stock so have a lot to learn. Who would you say is Corteva's #1 competitor? My guess is Bayer after the Monsanto purchase. Any others come to mind?
Pretty good earnings
"This is a huge company. I still find it remarkable how few people go to this message board. There is also little news on CTVA. Just compare it to what was its sister company DOW which I also own. This is a quiet little stock with a mega market cap. I don't know what to make of this as an inflation trade either. All I know is with all the talk of food inflation, Corn prices are very weak, Soybeans are very weak. The only grain that is running off the charts is Oat."
"New EU rice herbicide, Rinskor, approved..Formal EU approval has been issued for Corteva Agriscience’s new rice herbicide, florpyrauxifen-benzyl (trade-marked as Rinskor), and will commence on July 24th for ten years."
"This new CEO ran NTR, a huge Ag company in Canada. It looks like the market approves so far."
great earnings
when is corteva going to pay it's dividend
"Despite the ups and downs in the short term Corteva owns the highest number of patents in Crispr, a new engineering tool. Considering that this technique is relatively new, it is very interesting to observe how Corteva has been investing time and resources in research, so that it currently leads the number of patents, even more than Bayer. I think this research into modification of seeds will give very good profits."
"Both Syngenta and Bayer are struggling with their seeds businesses. CTVA has an opportunity to break free of license costs and expand its customer base with its products. And its Ag Chem offerings are expanding and growing nicely. The Seeds and Ag Chem markets are highly cyclical boom and bust - as is the production agriculture industry as a whole. A good cycle is ahead, especially with less friction between the US and China. Should be positive for CTVA. My view - stick with current management team - they know the business and industry. The Starboard sharks are just after a short term sugar high - reject them. My view."
Could someone tell me why 9 out of 10 times the market is up ctva is down but like today the market is down and ctva is up every time the market is down? like today the market is down big time but ctva is up? does not make sense to me? any thoughts?
So much to like with CTVA... Building a position and expect no less than a double within 3 years from the current $25 per share. Good luck CTVA longs!
"Soybeans in ‘21...“The U.S. Department of Agriculture and early trade guesses indicate U.S. farmers are expected to plant a record of more than 90 million soybean acres, up around 7 million from 2020. This is due to historically tight ending stocks at 120 million bushels and prices not seen for several years. Where those acres will come from depends on the state.“"
to soon to jump ship?
Farmers are all on planting corn and soy. Ag dept. report today was extremely bullish for this seed and ag chem company. $60 on next earnings.
Worried about rains in the farmland.
will CTVA pay a qtrly. dividend ?
"Corteva and competitors are in the process of refunding seeds and chemicals to farmers unable to plant this season due to weather. Corteva is a long term play with significant upside potential, not a stock for short term, emotional investors."
What was the opening price on this stock when it was first traded?
What happened today to cause a sudden 5% drop?
"Worth noting, with spring ramp up...“Corteva said it expects its Enlist seeds to be planted on 20% of U.S. soybean acres this year, double the company’s previous estimate.”"
"I own this stock and read the message board, I also own new DD but there is no conversation for it WHY?"
You can't eat a Google.
"I am long on ctva. It is a company that makes sense to me. I inherited out of the spin off, but after reading up on the company, I began to appreciate it more. Then the news came that the hedge fund bought a position and wrote that ctva has untapped potential. That report added $2 to the share price and it is holding it. So, should I buy another 100 shares? Is this stock going to move above $40 in the next year? Will they bump the dividend?"
Corteva announced a $.13/qtr dividend today & a $1 billion stock buyback. Shooting for a 25-35% of net income for dividends in the future. Good to hear.
