TXT reached a new 52 Week Low at $51.80
Txt only does well when Cessna and Bell are both running together.
It is time to turn this thing around.
Did Lockheed buy Textron yet?
"The movement of TXT to a pure play aviation company continues. The selling of its' Tool and Test business eliminates another non-aviation business. Bell, TXT Aviation, much of Systems and even parts of Specialized Vehicles (aircraft support and movement vehicles) are involved in aviation. This is a much more important fact than whether Donald Trump tweets something about Kim Jong Un as some on this board seem to suggest. If you are interested in owning Textron, understand what business it is in and its' strategy to build and operate that business. The market values NPV of future cash flows and they are driven by strategy and operations. Using this message site to prosecute political points of view about current events or even worse old historical complaints is amusing but adds little value to my analysis of what to do with my money."
What’s going on here? Any news on the bombardier takeover?
"According to the SEC website, among others, over the last 3 months, insiders have sold a total of 458,112 shares at an average price of $55.04 in multiple transactions. Doesn't exactly inspire confidence that the stock will reach the $60's again anytime soon. Between the pitiful dividend, poor management who refuse to unlock shareholder value, and market disrespect for Textron, this is an frustrating stock to own (suffering for decades now and counting...)"
How about $ 72.00 per share?
"I am out. Bought 3,400 shares at $24 sold them today at $40.62. Very nice profit. I think now TXT will be trading between highs $30s and low $40s ranges for a while until coronavirus uncertainty is gone for good. After that I can see TXT at low $50s."
It sure is a slow process getting back to the $ 70 dollar range.
"Anyone noticed, that the US is currently buying 14 attack hovercrafts from Textron? Assuming that the big ones from Russia in the 1980ies had cost USD100M, this means USD1-2B! for Textron, today.(News from March 2020):https://www.textronsystems.com/products/ship-shore-connector"
is this board still up and running?
Headed in the right direction.
Textron is up 11.33% to 29.96
"cheap, surprisingly low margin and dividend"
I told y’all about 6 weeks ago when she was 40 that you would see the mid 20s soon. Hope you listened.
Down another .93 cents to $54.08. This robot is in plummet mode. Look out below!!!!!!!TXT needs to have a healthy dividend instead of just dreams and blue sky IMHO.
Textron reached a 52 Week low at 38.01
"Finally after my post of two months ago, we are back to the $70 range. Took a long time."
i think we see a sell off down to about 26 soon. because of the Democrats. DenocRATS have tried hard to stop this country from going back to a great country and opportunity for all that would like to work.

"Textron is now an Aviation/aerospace company that has this Industrial segment. Industrial is really an automotive supplier (plastic fuel tanks) and something called Textron Specialty Vehicles. TSV is an interesting mix of golf carts, industrial vehicles, aircraft towing and service vehicles, snowmobiles and small all terrain vehicles. A mix of vehicles that seem to have no strategic connections accept the name 'specialty vehicles'...you could put pogo sticks in that mix if you wished. Last addition was Arctic Cat, a money losing company. Now it looks like Arctic Cat was the cause of TSV/Industrial imploding in the 3rd quarter. Not sure when they knew this was coming. It sounds to me that the strategy of TSV and the final addition of Arctic Cat is the culprit. Not sure I would depend on Textron to be a great investment until it fixes its overall strategy. Does it want to be an aerospace company or just a 1960's conglomerate? As an aerospace company, it has some interesting parts that would attract some M&A attention."
"TXT published its 10K today. The company continues to become more of an aviation company with an Industrial hodgepodge added on. Bell, Textron Aviation and now Textron Systems, with UAV and Flight Simulation and Training, are focused on aviation both commercial and military. They walked away from a $100 million/year weapons business for reasons that appear to be connected to concern about the politics of weapons than anything else. As an owner of TXT, it would be very helpful, if management gave us a clear idea of what the plan is."
All I can say just be patience your money will owe there for you!
Great news coming.
Great to see the 2 cent dividend.
"I recall scott Donnelly picking plucked out of GE back when Textron thought GE was the be all, end all of companies...looks like scott got out at a great time!"
"Does anyone know how we can encourage an activist investor to become involved with TXT? This company needs to be broken up to unlock shareholder value. The BOD, CEO and upper mgmnt appear quite content with the status quo, as they make their multi million dollar salaries regardless of the severely undervalued share price and pitiful dividend. I also still find it suspicious, in my opinion, that there was much insider selling at $55? The share price is being driven into the ground, with no end in sight, unless an outside entity forces them to care about shareholder value, like most companies do."
3Q release on 10/18 … is today's tanking due to a leak??
That’s quite a price target change from $38 to $50!

"Gekko and Anonymous,The blaming of Lewis Campbell for all of TXT problems continues to mystify me. Jim Hardymon bought fastener companies...fluid and power companies (what was that, anyway?). He had a plan to keep quarter to quarter eps growth and that meant you had to just buy eps, which they did. If you look at TXT today and the TXT that existed in 1998, they are not the same companies. Donnelly is making us an Aviation centric company with an Industrial group attached. I still would love to hear what Donnelly has for a plan. The analysts on the quarterly calls keep focusing on Cessna and Bell...and next quarter...not helpful to the long term investor."

I hope the massive 2 cent dividend isn't at risk. :-). Probably time to acquire and break up this dumpster fire and release what's left of the shareholder value.
"The only answer now after our endurance, in my opinion is to BREAK IT UP, but the we have been saying that for many years now, how do you feel about TXT earnings and paying .02 cents, how do you feel about the SALES by insiders at numbers way above current price, how do you feel about the executive compensation/payroll and benefits, how do you feel about all the law suits and the IMAGE it presents even if we might think it worthless, how do you feel about the direction and organization of TXT right now? How does earning 4 eps sound and being in the cellar, and paying 2 cents to everyone except themselves at corporate.Like others I have a lot of blood and memories from the good things we did at AVCO, TXT, bringing us prestige and respect and we may still be doing it but it doesn't show or feel as good.(even with SFW, PKPR )Krug"

"I can get constructive on its back half and full year guidance. At the end of the day gross margin is improving, which is a good thing."
"It is hard to not be concerned about Textron at the moment. The stock is down well over 10% since the earnings announcement. It certainly is not because of the earnings itself, they were up. But, of course, the revenues were down and the growth projections of management are less than stellar. Bell and Cessna are still solid assets. However, Bell's growth is dependent on a new commercial a/c (525) and a win on a future army program that is still a couple years in the future for even development. Cessna's growth is predicated on the new Longitude, probably pretty solid, and the improvement in the overall biz jet market. While Textron has become more focused on aviation over the past few years, with a continuing notable position in defense as well. It still has the industrial business which is really a hodgepodge of 'specialty' vehicles and a plastic fuel tank business. While they divested the tool and test business, they doubled down on specialty vehicles by purchasing a financially challenged snowmobile maker. The old adage that you either grow or die seems like an apt thing to remember. The growth of its' parts is certainly a challenge.Its' individual parts may be more valuable to someone else's more focused portfolio and I hope they are at least seriously looking at this as a strategic option."

How are they maximizing shareholder value and dividends compared to their industry peers? Why is the share price being held down?"
Slowly but surely going up. Glad that I invested at $22-$24 ranges.
