Practically they destroyed the stock price today.
"Nice numbers, especially 2019 outlook … $3.75 at high end and great free cash flow … should support climb to mid-60's"
"... solid base over $70 ... $80+ is truly possible ... electric planes with vertical take-off capability will facilitate the building of non-runway airports which, finally, will open the demand for the commercial use of the V-22 ..."
will climb back to $72 range resume today? I'm betting it will.

"Friday's coordinated airline short fails*A group of shorts thought that significant airline insider selling in February, combined with the decline provoked by increasing bond yields on Friday, was a very good sign to sell airlines. By 11:30 eastern, the trend reversed after realizing that since over 50% of U.S. 65 year olds have been vaccinated, the Covid-19 mortality rate was effectively cut by 40%. *This is just my opinion of course.$JETS $ACDVF $AAL $UAL $LUV $JBLU $DAL $ALK $SKYW $HA $CJT.TO $ALGT $TXT $GD $RYAAY $WIZZ.L $0753.HK"
Great to see the 2 cent dividend.
"Yahoo increased the price target recently to $59.58. Seems like there is a lot of forward momentum for a number of reasons. Predictions by anyone for good 4th Q numbers and subsequent stock price rise into the low $ 60's? Also, due to tax reform, does anyone think TXT may now finally channel at least some of their capital into increasing their abysmal dividend? Thoughts? My best wishes to all of you for a happy, healthy, and prosperous 2018!"
This stock you can buy and forget.
"Textron is now an Aviation/aerospace company that has this Industrial segment. Industrial is really an automotive supplier (plastic fuel tanks) and something called Textron Specialty Vehicles. TSV is an interesting mix of golf carts, industrial vehicles, aircraft towing and service vehicles, snowmobiles and small all terrain vehicles. A mix of vehicles that seem to have no strategic connections accept the name 'specialty vehicles'...you could put pogo sticks in that mix if you wished. Last addition was Arctic Cat, a money losing company. Now it looks like Arctic Cat was the cause of TSV/Industrial imploding in the 3rd quarter. Not sure when they knew this was coming. It sounds to me that the strategy of TSV and the final addition of Arctic Cat is the culprit. Not sure I would depend on Textron to be a great investment until it fixes its overall strategy. Does it want to be an aerospace company or just a 1960's conglomerate? As an aerospace company, it has some interesting parts that would attract some M&A attention."

Time for a leadership change. Donnelly hasn't delivered.
"Time for all shareholders en masse to contact the Board of Directors and executive management via email, phone calls, &/or mail. I believe an investigation needs to be done as to why TXT is at one of its lowest levels in years, considering their financials are not that bad, they are being awarded military contracts, investing in innovation such as partnering with Uber on air taxi prototypes etc, and the stock market is at record highs! How are they maximizing shareholder value and dividends compared to their industry peers? Why is the share price being held down?"
It sure is a slow process getting back to the $ 70 dollar range.
I am puzzled by price in relation to earnings report.
"Does anyone know how we can encourage an activist investor to become involved with TXT? This company needs to be broken up to unlock shareholder value. The BOD, CEO and upper mgmnt appear quite content with the status quo, as they make their multi million dollar salaries regardless of the severely undervalued share price and pitiful dividend. I also still find it suspicious, in my opinion, that there was much insider selling at $55? The share price is being driven into the ground, with no end in sight, unless an outside entity forces them to care about shareholder value, like most companies do."
Nice beat
