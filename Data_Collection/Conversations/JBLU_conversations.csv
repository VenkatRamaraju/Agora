"PROMISES PROMISESSo glad that management has assured us for years that 2020 is their year and earnings will be about $2.50 a share. If that is the case we should be trading around $25 for sure. November is not a good omen but lets give them the benefit of the doubt. If they do not execute and provide excuses, its well past the time for management change. The fact that management and the directors sell every share they are awarded when they vest does not show great confidence. No more excuses. Time to perform or get out of Dodge."

It's just getting a good share price thats lacking. We were getting back to $20.00 + and then Covid hit. I got no luck.
Jet Blue will be taken over in next 3 to 6 months. Boeing will still have problems with 737 & other airlines need to cover their routes they have stopped flying too. Jet Blue is a way for the Southwest & others to pick up their cancelled routes & they fly the same types of aircraft as Jet Blue. Take over price is somewhere between $26 to $30's. Buying every dip.

"CFRA KEEPS HOLD OPINION ON SHARES OF JETBLUE AIRWAYS4:28 pm ET May 7, 2020 (CFRA) PrintWe cut our target to $10 from $22, a discount to JBLU's book value per share given Covid-19 has introduced high uncertainty for the return to profitable airline operations. We cut our 2020 EPS estimate to -$2.87 from $2.36 and set 2021's at -$0.47. Q1 adjusted EPS of -$0.42 vs. $0.16 beat consensus by $0.01. Q1 revenue fell 15% YoY, with Covid-19 pushing JBLU into loss making territory along with the rest of the airlines. TSA checkpoint traffic was still down 94% YoY as of May 6, and we think the air travel recovery will lag most economic activities due to perceived health risks of flying. Also, high unemployment will leave airlines with excess capacity for several years, in our view, making EPS growth hard to come by, especially with ballooning debt. We note that during the last downturn, U.S. passenger miles did not recover the 2007 high until 2014. Unlike some peers, we are confident JBLU will survive, having entered the crisis with EBIT-to-interest coverage of 13x vs. a peer median 10x."
$20 is definitely coming due to mandates for vaccine now FDA has approved.
JBLU will trend similar to AAL. Time to buy!
jblu is a well run company and can weather any storm. I know some pilots that work for them. they say they wouldn't work for any other airline
jet blue is not a big airline so its chances to weather this is some what better and it has a good balance sheet
Will JBLU ever return to $20 range ?only after Fauci moves to China
unvaccinated people are only ones dying from covid. No need to worry about these deaths. These people took a firm stand not to be vaccinated.

"Here's the thing people don't understand about Buffet. He's a growth investor, he plans to buy strong companies to hold for many years who's business will expand. He's leaving airlines not because he thinks they'll stay at these lows for years but because with the debt they're taking on and current fleets airlines will be unlikely to grow for years. This doesn't mean he expects bankruptcy, he says many times how well they're being run and that they're doing the right things. What this just means is that you as an investor need to have a strategy. If your strategy is also growth you should sell. If it's value or speculation its a strong buy over the next year"

Just have to weather the storm and sharp minds know Jet Blue will get through it.#longandstrong"
"Haven't looked at the whole company but from the New York area, Southwest and Jet Blue would have great synergies. Different airports, more of a direct system, Caribbean exposure with little overlap, plans for Europe. Combined with the fact that LUV wants to diversify due to the Max fiasco and United's airbus purchase, it makes a lot of sense. The combined entity would make it a 1st tier airline with the ability to compete on all levels."
Robin Hates please resign. I have been asking for years. You add no value or do anything good for JBLU. 5 years no growth. Covid is not the excuse for JBLU it is just badly managed. We don't need flights going to Montana.

"I, like many on the board I've held Jetblue for many years wondering if and when it would break out into the high 20s and low 30s feeling that this breakout was close at hand.

Likely they all knew but didnt want to be the first to sell just in case the stock did what AAL did on Thursday, dropping early morning from the high and then ramping right back up through the afternoon. I was holding AAL on Wed from $11.85 and ended up selling too early on Thursday at $13.25. Threw away $180,000.I got in to JBLU late afternoon on Thursday since its shares are really depressed in comparison to AAL.

Come on JBLU ! 5 years ago this was a thriving airline with promise. Since then it has traded on a level of mediocrity. Even before the pandemic it started looking good again then the pandemic hit the fan. I suspect a big part of the problem is its a small regional airline and Robin Hayes adding flights to Montana doesn't help.

"I think Delta variant will not be too much of an impact unless the Gov is going to lock us down again for political reasons. Honestly 70% of the US received at least 1 shot. Eventually, with the second shot, most of Americans will be protected. If they catch the virus, chances are will be very mild. People will start travelling more and more and no-vax people, well, their made their choice, they can deal with the consequences."
"In stead of bailouts for airlines, why not offer a tax credit to evey American that covers 50% of the cost of vacation air travel and lodging. This would immediately help the entire hospitality sector and create an even larger number of jobs previously lost in industries that support the hospitality industry. This would bring back travel and more importantly renew confidence in the effectiveness of safety measures put in place that sound science has proved effective in stopping the transmission of Covid-19."

"Looks good to me I am adding on th dips..JetBlue Airways (JBLU) is eligible to receive $936 million in payroll grants. Caiado estimates that JetBlue(JBLU) will issue 2.6 million warrants, worth 1% of shares outstanding."
"But investors were more focused on the outlook, and in particular the company's expectations for costs. Third-quarter cost per available seat mile (CASM), a common industry metric, is expected to be up 11% to 13% from two years ago before the pandemic, nearly double analyst expectations. And the company warned that costs could remain stubbornly high into 2022, meaning there will be no easy fix.Although demand has returned from pandemic lows, a lot of the travel today is by price-sensitive leisure flyers. JetBlue's cost structure leaves it poorly positioned to compete for customers in a low-fare environment relative to ultra-discounters like Spirit Airlines."
What's a good entry point???
"Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1158463/000115846321000075/jblu-20210909.htmJetBlue Airways Corporation (""JetBlue"" or ""the Company"") announced today an operational and financial update of its business.The Company now expects flown capacity for the third quarter of 2021 to decline approximately 1%, when compared to the third quarter of 2019 (“year over two”). This compares to the Company’s prior planning assumption for capacity to be between flat to down 3%, year over two. The Company plans to continue to manage and align capacity with demand on a rolling basis.Given the recent uptick in COVID-19 case counts, JetBlue has experienced some softness in bookings and an increase in customer cancellations, which has impacted revenue for the third quarter of 2021 by approximately four points compared to the third quarter of 2019. This is partially offset by strong July 2021 revenue, and as a result, the Company now expects revenue to decline between 6% and 9% during the third quarter of 2021, year over two. This range compares to the Company’s prior planning assumption of a revenue decline between 4% and 9%, year over two. Looking beyond the third quarter, the Company is also seeing the recent bookings softness extend into the fourth quarter trough periods, though the Company currently anticipates that leisure demand for peak holiday travel will hold up relatively well. JetBlue continues to expect a choppy and non-linear demand recovery and may not be able to predict changes to revenue due to additional COVID-19 related disruptions or other factors.The Company continues to expect CASM Ex-Fuel (1) for the third quarter of 2021 to increase between 11% and 13%, year over two. As of September 9, 2021, JetBlue has not entered into forward fuel derivative contracts to hedge its fuel consumption for the third quarter of 2021. Based on the forward curve as of September 7, 2021, JetBlue expects an average all-in price per gallon of fuel of $2.09 in the third quarter of 2021.The Company now expects EBITDA for the third quarter of 2021 to range between $75M – $125M, compared to our prior planning assumption range of $75M – $175M."
"MARKET PULSEJetBlue to add flights as part of plan to operate more than half of typical summer capacityBy Tomi KilgorePublished: Jun 18, 2020 9:52 am ETJetBlue Airways Corp. JBLU-0.71% said Thursday it was adding 30 new domestic flight routes to markets where leisure travel is showing signs of strength, as it looks to operate more than half of its typical capacity this summer. ""Coronavirus has transformed airline route maps, and as we begin to see small signs of recovery, we continue to be flexible with our network plans to respond to demand trends and generate cash in support of our business,"" said Scott Laurence, head of revenue and planning at JetBlue. The air carrier also said it was launching premium-service Mint flights between Newark, New Jersey and Los Angeles and San Francisco. The stock slipped 0.8% in morning trading. It has rallied 54.4% over the past three months, while the U.S. Global Jets ETF JETS-1.1% has climbed 41.1% and the S&P 500 SPX-0.14% has advanced 29.8%."
This is a joke … down 7%?!
"news from ALK, cutting routes between NY and CA later this year. Jblu can add a few more. pilot contract nearing completion. let's go Jblu."
JBLU is going to go through the roof this week and I'm saying this because all the other airlines did last week and I think JBLU hitting 20 dollars this week and 25 end of next week. big week for this Airline
Investors I’m telling you the keys to success is to see one year in advance... Seriously think about where the world will stand in 2022... Will the traveling be in high demand next spring??? Will it be the craziest Spring Break ever??? Will people want to drive in grid locked traffic??? Family reunions will be a main priority for 95% of the world population.....All airlines will return to pre COVID-19 days....BUY the Airlines!!!Airlines are the most essential industry in all universes.....................#AAL #UAL #BA #LUV #JBLU #DAL #MESA #ALK #SKYW #HA #^DJI #^IXIC
"On the surface it looks like good earnings, positive revenue and load factor trends, and nice reduction of debt. This stock should start its climb to 20+."
"I keep hearing that jblu is one of the better situated, or at least “currently financially stable enough” to weather the pandemic —But is there any concern that it could face restructuring under bankruptcy? I get concerned that the airlines (including jblu) will use any, and all, options at there disposal to get through this —And just wondering if anyone felt that filing for a bankruptcy, wiping out the shareholders and re-emerging with a new raise of capital with stock is entirely off the table?"
Earnings in 2 days. Get ready for a huge jump in share price.
"Ole Warren Buffett struck out. People gonna fly. Period.$AAL, $JBLU."
Beats earnings expectations the last 4 quarters after the pandemic and some clown gives it a downgrade. Wall street hates JBLU for some reason.
Run up to 20 soon.
"I like the sound of this. Something good for a change. (JBLU) on Monday said it will implement a $125 million accelerated share-repurchase program with Barclays Bank PLC, completing a $750 million buyback program."
Okay Wall street. We have 5 quarters of meet or beating the analysts expectations. JBLU doesn't fly in China. No Boeing MAX Jets in our fleet.So how's about a nice healthy bounce up for a nice change ?

"This stock appears to be frozen at around $17.50. The company has great potential but the leadership team has little vision and lack any excitement in proposing opportunities to potential investors. To have vision you need to have been brought up to be confident and creative but I think the Jetblue management team are a lot like union employees, give me the sure thing and we'll coast from there. No need to take risks that could cost me a paycheck and benefits. Just saying...."
"""We now charge customers for baggage - look at us adding value to shareholders."" Nevermind the blow to customer satisfaction... If management thought charging baggage fees and continuing to expand in already tapped markets as opposed to new markets were going to propel JBLU into the future and excite investors, then it only continues to show how out of touch they are with both customers and investors. I thought Investor Day is supposed to excite investors, not crater your stock price."

"Thank you to those who are selling. I am buying your shares by the thousands. Please, go sell some more and go hide under the bed... this stock is not for you!

"JBLU, you just can't get out of your own way. Blame the hurricane, cut costs that negatively impact customer experience and act surprised when demand is down, charge an additional baggage fee and start to nickel and dime customers, that will help demand also. Have an airline that primarily services Florida and the Caribbean and don't build ""losses"" from hurricanes during hurricane season into your projections. You're supposed to try and stay in the GREEN, not the RED, red is BAD. Vent over..."
"The question for investors is less which airline stocks might survive, but which will come back fastest in a world still dealing with COVID-19?The conventional wisdom is that short routes are better than long ones, that cash is king, and that cost containment will make everyone a winner when the virus is gone.But how long will the virus be here? How many people will fly so long as it’s around? How long until the industry gets back to something like normal? How much cash is enough? These are the questions the market is now trying to answer."
You all need to calm down. This is one of the best structured airlines. They have low debt and proper management. Airline travel is on track to be pre-covid levels by August/September. Take this as a buying opportunity and appreciate the results later.
They had some interesting insights about JBLU on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
