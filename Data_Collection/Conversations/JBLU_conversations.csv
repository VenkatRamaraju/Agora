all airlines are undervalued so much... They are a no bariner to hold long term
Another nice little round trip flight below $15 and back.
well its goldman that explains a lot
"Air traffic so high, LAX had to expand off site parking."
Time for a merger or a buyer of this company
Why does Wall street hate JBLU? This company has beat expectations 4 Qtrs. in a row and it still trades like a failure. I have been critical of some of the decisions Hayes has made however doesn't this performance deserve a decent bid?
don't care... everyone is moving to Florida and JetBlue has the best northeast corridor. they have to let them compete in Boston that's all and it's a shoe in.
"I am a buyer at SUB $14, and not before. End of store, guys & gals."
Its like watching paint dry
Back to 19 soon
"Red again, did they miss or just same ole same ole from JBLU?"
They had some interesting insights about JBLU on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
1 step head followed by 4 steps back. Well. This is going to be a long ride in this market and we are only 6 months in
"I don't care. Buy low sell higher is the only way to go. Jetblue is not at $30 but at $15 only. That means buy low now sell high later when pandemic is over with. Pandemic will end within the next two years or even earlier. If not completely ended, we just keep on taking yearly vaccines and covid treatment drugs to survive. Everything must go back to normal."
Another beat for JBLU but no love from Wall street. That's 5 quarters and it stands still or pulls back. Why does Wall street hate JBLU?
2022 will definitely be a much better year for the airline industry. Kids from 5 to 11 will be vaccinated. Everything is coming back to normal.
would like to know if the same analyst that downgraded the stock also sold the stock prior to downgrading it
Now boarding for the traditional holiday season run-up in airline stocks.
