According to recent study from Hopkins Pfizer vaccine only 53% effective against delta variant while Moderna over 76% effective.
"Markets up, good news on MRNA, yet we are down over 5%. Why thoughts on why?"
"REUTERS 08.30.2021""As of Aug. 8, 991 people had died in Japan after receiving COVID-19 shots from Pfizer/BioNTech, and 11 after receiving Moderna's. No causality between the injections and the deaths has been established, according to the health ministry."""

"Well, looks like as long as the ""flu"" exists, so will Modernahttps://scitechdaily.com/recovering-from-covid-19-doesnt-guarantee-antibodies-or-confer-immunity-to-re-infection/"
"Analysts consensus EPS for 2021 and 2022 is $29 and $36 respectively and just based on conservative forward PE of 20, MRNA should be valued at least $580 - $720.In 2023, new revenue streams will come from CMV Vaccine and Flu+Covid combo vaccines"
Literally - unbelievable...seriously...who would have thought we'd see green today?!?!? Wow - this stock is unstoppable. IMHO - I was personally hoping for less than a 5% drop...lol...not that it matters because this is a minimum three-year hold for me with everything this company has going for them. Congrats longs...you called it again. Wow...
This was down on Friday because the short funds on WS were looking towards the story breaking over the weekend. This will be a short term blip...hours and at most a couple of days...just enough for them to cover up their positions and then right back up. The short funds rarely lose and I would not put it past them to have created this situation because life means nothing to them.
400$ soon
Steve Weiss on CNBC says MRNA in a core holding his hedge fund. His target price for MRNA is $700. I am buying a few shares at a time for long haul.

Research Moderna’s pipeline of vaccines and therapies. NEVER SELL! Moderna is truly a once in a lifetime investment opportunity.
Who moderates this board anyway? I post things on here that alot of times disappears right away
"Moderna vaccine is safe , protects you from serious illness and death. Decreases the viral load and chance of infecting others . Decreases the chance or some say eliminates the ability of the virus to mutate. Mutations are the most serious public health issue we face today. Every unvaccinated person that gets infected ( and ironically the longer they live) is a reservoir for the virus to mutate. Dangerous variants are increasing and we only know of a few. There is no escape from this virus or one of its mutations. None zero. Risks are rare and when the risk/benefit is factored in the choice is clear. Get the vaccine. It’s not a government plot, it’s the government trying to save society. I’m long still Moderna stock and glad when the stock goes up. However not posting trying to influence the stock price. Trying to influence somebody to get the vaccine and try and educate if I can."
"New York Times: Just OutBy Emily AnthesAug. 30, 2021Updated 5:20 p.m. ETNew data presented to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention committee provided more evidence that the Covid-19 vaccines provided robust protection against severe disease through July, after the Delta variant of the coronavirus had spread widely through the United States.Scientists also confirmed that the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna shots confer a small risk of heart problems in younger men, but that the benefits still outweighed the risks.At the committee’s meeting on Monday, Dr. Sara Oliver, a C.D.C. scientist, presented unpublished data from Covid-Net, a hospital surveillance system. All three vaccines used in the United States remained highly effective at preventing hospitalizations from April through July, when Delta became dominant, the data suggested.For adults under the age of 75, the shots were at least 94 percent effective at preventing hospitalizations, a rate that has remained steady for months, Dr. Oliver said. Protection against hospitalization did decline in July for adults 75 or older, but still remained above 80 percent."
"Good News, the Japanese have found why there was a contamination.""The health ministry said on Monday it appeared that some of the cases were caused by needles being incorrectly inserted into vials, breaking off bits of the rubber stopper. Other vials from the Okinawa and Gunma lots can continue to be used, it said."""
FDA Permanent and Full Approval within 2-3 weeks or sooner.
Watch things after FDA booster meeting today.
Delta surging. Hospitalizations way up. Schools unsure about reopening. And MRNA is down? World is upside down
Quebec (Canadian Province) now allowing third shots. Just a matter of time when rest of Canada follows.
"I'm vaccinated and, no, I don't know what's in it - neither this vaccine, the ones I had as a child, nor in the Big Mac, or in hot dogs, or in other treatments…whether it's for cancer, AIDS, the one for polyarthritis, or vaccines for infants or children. I trust my doctor when she says it’s needed. I also don't know what's in Ibuprofen, Tylenol, or other meds, it just cures my headaches & my pains ...I don't know what's in the ink for tattoos, vaping, or every ingredient in my soap or shampoo or even deodorants. I don’t know the long term effect of cell phone use or whether or not that restaurant I just ate at REALLY used clean foods and washed their hands. In short ...There's a lot of things I don't know and never will… I just know one thing: life is short, very short, and I still want to do something other than just going to work every day or staying locked in my home. I still want to travel and hug people without fear and find a little feeling of life ""before"".As a child and as an adult I've been vaccinated for mumps, measles, rubella, polio, chicken pox, and quite a few others; my parents and I trusted the science and never had to suffer through or transmit any of said diseases ... just saying. You are not vaccinated, I respect your choice,I am vaccinated, respect my choice ...I'm vaccinated, not to please the government but:* To not die from Covid-19.* To NOT clutter a hospital bed if I get sick.* To hug my loved ones * To Not have to do PCR or antigenic tests to go out dancing, go to a restaurant, go on holidays and many more things to come ...* To live my life.* To have my kids/grandkids go back to school and play sports. * For Covid-19 to be an old memory."
60 days til earnings. The manipulation window for shorts and unscrupulous institutions ends in 50 days. EVERYBODY knows it will be over 500 then.
People forget about Mrna’s pipeline. That’s where the real value lies that’s making this Mammoth company reach 1 Trillion dollars by 2024.
"Analysts with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. are more bullish. The bank has a buy rating on Moderna, estimating that its shot could drive $36.2 billion of sales next year, some $15 billion more than Bloomberg’s consensus estimates. “We see upside to these numbers given supply and pricing dynamics,” said analyst Asad Haider."
Moderna plans to advance its experimental HIV vaccine into clinical testing soon.
Who got in at $362 and change..congrats!
"Latest news!!! WHO warns of possible 236,000 new COVID-19 deaths in Europe by December, and Fauci says U.S. could see another 100,000!! Studies has proven booster helps! Vacc stock is going to rocket once again!!! "
"MRNA will be back in the GREEN and UP by market close. We may even be UP BIG on a major reversal after this way overblown reaction to the Japan news which is transitory and not attributable to anything MRNA did. Smart investors including the BIG BOYS knew this and jumped in with both fists flying at this nice buy op. Major Major block BUY at $366 that took this one from $366 to $372 in a flash. Now at $376. Weak longs shaken out and smart shorts covering while they can before the BIG move back up. Remember Boosters coming, Full FDA in the near term horizon and other pipeline product news of significance,HIV vaccine clinical testing start fast approaching. Shorts have had their 3 days. The Longs are taking control NOW again for the coming weeks and months ahead. Go MRNA!!!"
Squeeze alert...shorts profits gone
Shorts are so quiet
It's a FUD created by Reuters. Misleading reporting and pumping Astrazenca!
