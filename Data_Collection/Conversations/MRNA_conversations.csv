"would be a great price to buy, only -$333 more to reach Pfizer."
"Covid deaths in the USA the last 4 days --Monday-908 Tues-1405 Wed-1456 Thurs-1292Deaths had been down to 271, 462, 387, 321 -- the last week of July - before Delta went wild.Where is the Outrage ? Seems insane that there are still people looking for any excuse to talk down the taking of vaccines! If it wise for me to ""also"" wear a mask when around other people - I can do that small thing. Doctors, nurses, EMTs have used masks daily for decades to reduce the chance of spread of disease.The News has moved on to lead with other stories.Covid-19 will not stop mutating and coming back. Maybe not ever- but certainly not until the living decide to do what they can to reduce the spread.I'm 75 years old now. I remember the ""March of Dimes"" in grade school to pay for development and use of Polio vaccine. I know people personally that got polio as children - and lived with their disabilities the last 65 years. Will Covid ever let go of the ""long-haulers"" ?Bless the bio-scientists who never gave up - spent the last decades figuring out the key to making these new vaccines ! Not just the winners - bless them all. There were many efforts that led to dead ends. Science is like that. Bless them all !"
"I have said this before. Moderna opted for a higher 100 mcg dosage and 28 days for booster because they wanted the best outcome for their patients especially the elderly. Pfizer knowing that they have a constraint in storage product conditions, they opted for the lowest dosage possible with the shorter 21 days for the 2nd dose booster. That is a marketing strategy to move product thru the supply chain not science based or patient focus. SpikeVax is the best stuff on the market bar none."
I’m surprised at the stark divergence of MRNA & BNTX today
"Understand facts rather than fake news whispering to your ears a million times over and over by Shorts.The Spain facility has been reopened and continued to produce Moderna vaccine. The contamination lot is isolated and the material is being examined. The 2 people who died are being examined for the cause so let that process goes through before any judgement. Millions of people already taken Moderna vaccine and they are fine - including my family, extended families, and friends, and myself. So this could be either other health issues or because of allergic reaction to whatever is the contamination. For all we know it might also be foul play."
Who got in at $362 and change..congrats!
"Markets up, good news on MRNA, yet we are down over 5%. Why thoughts on why?"
Pulmonologist in Alabama said yesterday that the few vaccination breakthroughs are people with comorbidity especially extreme obesity. If ever there was a time to lose weight. He wishes we had vaccine mandate for everyone.
I am in East Texas. Quite a few school systems are shutting temporarily for a week or so to clean and catch back up on absent teachers. Lots of wait and see.
"Moderna vaccine produced more antibodies than Pfizer's:Global cases of COVID-19 top 217 million as study finds Moderna vaccine produced more antibodies than Pfizer's-A study comparing individual immune responses to two major COVID-19 vaccines has shown that Moderna's (MRNA) created more than double the antibodies than that of Pfizer (PFE) and BioNTech (BNTX).

Looks like this is heading to $320
"Who want a metal injection directly into your blood stream from Moderna?""August 27, 2021 07:42 AM ET (BZ Newswire) -- BiotechMetallic particle is believed to be a contaminant found in a batch of Moderna Inc's (NASDAQ:MRNA) COVID-19 vaccines delivered to Japan, Japanese public broadcaster NHK reported, citing sources at the health ministry.Japan suspended the use of 1.63 million doses more than a week after the domestic distributor, Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd (NYSE:TAK), received reports of contaminants in some vials.Several Japanese companies cancelled worker vaccinations and the European drugs regulator launched investigation."
Research Moderna’s pipeline of vaccines and therapies. NEVER SELL! Moderna is truly a once in a lifetime investment opportunity.
"Canada approves Moderna’s COVID vaccine for adolescents Aug 27 (Reuters) - Canada on Friday authorized the use of Moderna Inc's COVID-19 vaccine in adolescents, with the country's health regulator calling it safe and effective for the 12 to 17 age-group.The vaccine was previously authorized for use by Health Canada in only adults over the age of 18.The two-shot vaccine is not yet authorized in the United States to treat children between 12 to 17, but was recommended for approval in Europe and has been cleared in the UK.While most children develop mild or no symptoms with COVID-19, they are still able to spread the virus and some remain at risk of becoming seriously ill.Canadian health authorities said they will continue to monitor the safety of the vaccine and take action if any concerns are identified.The Washington Post had reported last week that U.S. health officials are reviewing Canadian data that suggests a higher risk of a rare heart condition in younger adults than the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, citing people familiar with the review.

"New York Times: Just OutBy Emily AnthesAug. 30, 2021Updated 5:20 p.m. ETNew data presented to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention committee provided more evidence that the Covid-19 vaccines provided robust protection against severe disease through July, after the Delta variant of the coronavirus had spread widely through the United States.Scientists also confirmed that the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna shots confer a small risk of heart problems in younger men, but that the benefits still outweighed the risks.At the committee’s meeting on Monday, Dr. Sara Oliver, a C.D.C. scientist, presented unpublished data from Covid-Net, a hospital surveillance system. All three vaccines used in the United States remained highly effective at preventing hospitalizations from April through July, when Delta became dominant, the data suggested.For adults under the age of 75, the shots were at least 94 percent effective at preventing hospitalizations, a rate that has remained steady for months, Dr. Oliver said. Protection against hospitalization did decline in July for adults 75 or older, but still remained above 80 percent."

In a year or two David will be driving a Chrysler K if he keeps shorting this stock. I'm muting. Bye bye shorty
The volume was way too low for that big price rally this morning. That's why it's pulling back and the candlestick by the end of the day with the gap down is more bearish than anything. Stock does not have support until low $300's but the continuation of this downtrend could intensify and stock could likely be trading in mid to high $200's for a while until it bottoms out
"Don’t sell now, AH big news waiting, $430 by Friday"
"I am an investor since may 2020 and still holding... moderna is often referred to as the tesla of the biotech but it is not reflected in its multiple (without speaking about its profitability)... once CMV will enter phase 3 and results about booster efficacy at 50ug (instead of 100) will hit, everyone here will regret not to have bought more"

"I'm vaccinated and, no, I don't know what's in it - neither this vaccine, the ones I had as a child, nor in the Big Mac, or in hot dogs, or in other treatments…whether it's for cancer, AIDS, the one for polyarthritis, or vaccines for infants or children. I trust my doctor when she says it’s needed. I also don't know what's in Ibuprofen, Tylenol, or other meds, it just cures my headaches & my pains ...I don't know what's in the ink for tattoos, vaping, or every ingredient in my soap or shampoo or even deodorants. I don’t know the long term effect of cell phone use or whether or not that restaurant I just ate at REALLY used clean foods and washed their hands. In short ...There's a lot of things I don't know and never will… I just know one thing: life is short, very short, and I still want to do something other than just going to work every day or staying locked in my home. I still want to travel and hug people without fear and find a little feeling of life ""before"".As a child and as an adult I've been vaccinated for mumps, measles, rubella, polio, chicken pox, and quite a few others; my parents and I trusted the science and never had to suffer through or transmit any of said diseases ... just saying. You are not vaccinated, I respect your choice,I am vaccinated, respect my choice ...I'm vaccinated, not to please the government but:* To not die from Covid-19.* To NOT clutter a hospital bed if I get sick.* To hug my loved ones * To Not have to do PCR or antigenic tests to go out dancing, go to a restaurant, go on holidays and many more things to come ...* To live my life.* To have my kids/grandkids go back to school and play sports. * For Covid-19 to be an old memory."
"Moderna vaccine is safe , protects you from serious illness and death. Decreases the viral load and chance of infecting others . Decreases the chance or some say eliminates the ability of the virus to mutate. Mutations are the most serious public health issue we face today. Every unvaccinated person that gets infected ( and ironically the longer they live) is a reservoir for the virus to mutate. Dangerous variants are increasing and we only know of a few. There is no escape from this virus or one of its mutations. None zero. Risks are rare and when the risk/benefit is factored in the choice is clear. Get the vaccine. It’s not a government plot, it’s the government trying to save society. I’m long still Moderna stock and glad when the stock goes up. However not posting trying to influence the stock price. Trying to influence somebody to get the vaccine and try and educate if I can."

"Just a reminder that mRNA technology is essentially ""instructions"" that tell your body to create things - Covid-19 proteins in this case. Their pipeline is so valuable, because of all the things it can teach your body to do?

"Prevnar has yearly 6 billion in sales. Gardisil has yearly 3 billion in sales. If our CMV, RSV, Flu vaccines take off we have conservatively 10 billion in sales a year. Our pipeline is strong. With Covid looking to become endemic, we will likely have billions in yearly revenue as well. Long term this is a hold. There could be a pull back between when our next drug targets ""hit"" and a slowdown post covid hype. For me, it's hard to time markets, so I'm in this for the long haul"

"Isn’t it odd that in every city, hospitals are overloaded with anti-Vaxers at a rate of 29-1? Almost as if that ratio, 29-1, was scripted. Not 28-1. Not 30-1 in some cities. No, they are all 29-1 unvaccinated versus vaccinated."

"Shorts , are you enjoying this. I bet you are."
Sadly the going back to school is not panning out particularly well. Our children need to be vaccinated!
"I am fully vaccinated. When It comes to anti-vaxers that is individuals choice if they want to get vaccinated or not. However, with that said I think it is time to give them something to think about that would affect them directly: Insurance companies should put out a notice giving policy holders by a certain date Lets say Dec 1st that they must be fully vaccinated or by Jan 1st if they are hospitalized with Covid their insurance with not cover them. They would be free to choose carrier so their freedom of choice would not be violated.Some municipalities are already telling employees that they must be fully vaccinated, if not, they will not received any paid sick leave should they contract Covid.It is time for everyone to do their part. No politics involved here as I am a full Independent and vote both sides of aisle."
"Moderna Inc.’s Covid vaccine generated more than double the antibodies of a similar shot made by Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE in research directly comparing immune responses to the inoculations.A study of almost 2,500 workers at a major Belgium hospital system found antibody levels among individuals who hadn’t been infected with the coronavirus before getting two doses of the Moderna vaccine averaged 2,881 units per milliliter, compared with 1,108 units/mL in an equivalent group who got two jabs of the Pfizer shot.Bloomberg"

"instead of buying high go buy $ZM while it's low. Could it sell off more? yes but I'm seeing a lot of bullish signs. We have a big GAP fill, statsically 92% of gaps on charts get filled but more importantly volume is very high selling pressure is intense yet it is getting completely absorbed by buyers and price is very steady still yet. Once sellers are exhausted price is likely to squeeze up"
I am long on moderna but I am tired of manipulated pumping and dumping Leave this stock alone

FDA Permanent and Full Approval within 2-3 weeks or sooner.
Bio E catalyst this week. I can see $30 by mid September if Bio E apply for EUA and Clover announce its p3 results. What people misssing is that DVAX deals with 4 vaccines and all 4 seems to be approved by EOY.So $30 is a mere target for huge covid market. DVAX market cap should be at least 10B by EOY.$NVAX $MRNA $BNTX
This was down on Friday because the short funds on WS were looking towards the story breaking over the weekend. This will be a short term blip...hours and at most a couple of days...just enough for them to cover up their positions and then right back up. The short funds rarely lose and I would not put it past them to have created this situation because life means nothing to them.
Steve Weiss on CNBC says MRNA in a core holding his hedge fund. His target price for MRNA is $700. I am buying a few shares at a time for long haul.
"The faster MRNA comes down to the $300-320 range the better. There is a clear up trend line that it follows. The stock will take off once it touches that trend line. It can reach trend line over the next 1-2 weeks by dancing in the $370 range or take a hit down to the $300-320 range. In any case, the uptrend is your friend. Once it hits that trend line this stock will take off…next stop $700. I’ve owned this stock for almost two years now and have see how it operates. Slowly, it has grown from 1% of my portfolio to 5% (just by relative appreciation). Hang in there!"

Looks like BNTX and Moderna are no longer trading twins and have diverged. Maybe people are shifting over to Moderna based on this latest info that it is 2x better vaccine (in terms of lasting antibodies).

$400 tomrw. It was at $401 when false news from Japan on contamination hit. It sold off but didn’t recover fully with the clarification.
MRNA stock moving higher now. I think it's on the news that the anti-Boosters are leaving the FDA.
"The CDC committee looked at data from across the US showing unvaccinated adults are being hospitalized for COVID-19 at rates roughly 16 times higher than the vaccinated.As of August 23, 0.006% of vaccinated Americans (fewer than 9,000 people) have had a severe enough case of COVID-19 to be hospitalized, according to CDC data.The number of vaccinated people who've died from COVID-19 is even smaller. Of the 636,015 American COVID-19 deaths, just 2,063, or 0.3% have been in vaccinated people, a tiny fraction when you consider that more than 174 million people are fully vaccinated in the US."
"1.6 million doses rejected in Japan The ministry said later in the day that the substance that had been mixed in may have been metal. ""It's a substance that reacts to magnets,"" a ministry official said. ""It could be metal."""

"The study authors suggested the higher level of messenger RNA (mRNA) in Moderna's vaccine, as well as the longer interval between doses, could explain the antibody responses. Moderna shots are given four weeks apart vs. three weeks for the Pfizer/BioNTech jabs"
Japan news way overblown. Appears to have been caused by wrong needles used breaking off the rubber seal into the vials of the vaccine. Those selling on this news or who sold or who thinks this is news worth continuing shorting on after MRNA has already dropped $20 plus on this over reaction to this news of limited doses being temporarily suspended will miss the BIG ride UP this week as full FDA approval gets closer and closer. Impending official news of the start to MRNA’s HIV vaccine candidate soon in the coming weeks also highly likely to propel this beast of a stock even higher in the near term days and weeks ahead. Looking forward to the shorts eating and breathing in the fumes and dust of the MRNA rocket  ship as it prepares for near term launch and lift off again. Watch and learn.
Short squeeze today
"Analysts consensus EPS for 2021 and 2022 is $29 and $36 respectively and just based on conservative forward PE of 20, MRNA should be valued at least $580 - $720.In 2023, new revenue streams will come from CMV Vaccine and Flu+Covid combo vaccines"

Moderna becoming a gold standard in vaccines with global footprint. CMV virus and flu vaccines coming. Perhaps a cancer vaccine too. Yearly Covid vaccines will be required. Future is amazing and we haven’t even taken into account the companies they will buy with huge cash buildup.
New study shows that Moderna makes twice as many antibodies as Pfizer.
Don’t be disheartened. Japan news is nothing but noise. These types of corrections are a part of this trade. Fair value of this stock is about $700. Current correction will continue for a week or so till it hits about $300-320. Uptrend is still intact. Momentum will be back once it touches $300-320. Stock will set a new high once it trades in that range. I did not expect MRNA to become such a large portion of my portfolio but it did that due to significant appreciation over the past 1.5 years. I’m still holding strong and loving it!!!
"Capital gain is taxed at 20%, short term capital gains are taxed at 40%. If the the new Capital gain tax is 43.5% what will be the short term Capital gain rate be?"
Were the contaminants found in vials at the Okinawa plant the same ones linked to the incident that is possibly related to the deaths of the 2 Japanese men? Or is this an entirely different finding?
Moderna is among hedge funds’ favorite stocks to short as the investment strategy reboundsAs the news regarding the efficacy Moderna vaccine piles up the shorts is trying to dampen the mood. They will like to squeeze as much lemon before they cover. Hold on to your shares... Once they realize they cannot get any more juice (they did not figure out the outcome studies) it will pop
Is full approval of MRNA happening soon?
well if it does get down to 350 I might buy another 100 shares.
"Moderna Creates Twice as Many Antibodies as Pfizer, Study ShowsBy Jason GaleAugust 30, 2021, 10:54 PM EDTDo Covid Booster Shots Work?UnmuteDo Covid Booster Shots Work?Moderna Inc.’s Covid vaccine generated more than double the antibodies of a similar shot made by Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE in research directly comparing immune responses to the inoculations.A study of almost 2,500 workers at a major Belgium hospital system found antibody levels among individuals who hadn’t been infected with the coronavirus before getting two doses of the Moderna vaccine averaged 2,881 units per milliliter, compared with 1,108 units/mL in an equivalent group who got two jabs of the Pfizer shot."
"Latest news!!! WHO warns of possible 236,000 new COVID-19 deaths in Europe by December, and Fauci says U.S. could see another 100,000!! Studies has proven booster helps! Vacc stock is going to rocket once again!!! "
The EU found ABUS 069 patent valid and rejected MRNA's invalidity arguments.
I have a feeling this will close green
$420s tomorrow
Shorts getting nervous tonight. They know that all their profits from Friday could disappear.
New vaccine study shows Moderna outperforming Pfizer in preventing breakthrough caseshttps://youtu.be/SfWbDZw_Kuc
"Moderna COVID-19 vaccine created more antibodies than Pfizer/BioNTech’s , Belgian study shows 04:25 AM EDT, 08/31/2021 (MT Newswires) -- Moderna's (MRNA) COVID-19 jab created more antibodies compared with the vaccine co-created by Pfizer (PFE) and BioNTech (BNTX), based on an independent study conducted on healthcare workers in Belgium.In the study, higher antibody titers were observed in participants vaccinated with two doses of mRNA-1273, demonstrating a significantly higher humoral immunogenicity of the SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Previously infected participants also had higher antibody titers compared with previously uninfected participants.A total of 688 workers were vaccinated with mRNA-1273 and 959 with BNT162b2.Moderna shares fell 0.5% in recent premarket activity. Pfizer shed 0.3%, while BioNTech American depositary shares slipped 0.1%.Price: 372.00, Change: +1.31, Percent Change: +0.35"
"New Axios-Ipsos poll finds lowest vaccine opposition ever since vaccine release. (8/31/21 - today ).Only one in five (20%) Americans say they are not likely to get the coronavirus vaccine, the lowest level since we started tracking. Hard opposition, those not at all likely, has dropped to 14% of adults.Be still my soul !"
MRNA might need Q3 earnings report to remind people they are making money hand over fist
"Ha. Japan, learn how to give a shot verify story first before jumping the gun with moderna co."

This good new should push this to $700 real soon.
Literally - unbelievable...seriously...who would have thought we'd see green today?!?!? Wow - this stock is unstoppable. IMHO - I was personally hoping for less than a 5% drop...lol...not that it matters because this is a minimum three-year hold for me with everything this company has going for them. Congrats longs...you called it again. Wow...
"Israeli government started yesterday administrating the 3rd shot to every one over 12 years old, nearly half the population are after the 3rd shot without any problems/side effects.IMO, the two Japanese that died, died from other reason, this is still under investigation, the metal found in some vaccine tubes can't pass the thin injection, anyway hundreds of millions of shots already been injected without a problem."
$425.00 by end of this week... Guaranteed!!!
Don’t have the reference but just read the article that the FDA yesterday decided to hold off on their recommendation for the 3rd boosters just yet and concentrate on getting the unvaccinated vaccinated.
"Vaccine contamination blamed on incorrect use of needlesJapan's health minister said it was highly likely that foreign matter found in Moderna's Covid vaccines in Okinawa were caused when needles were stuck into the vials.Some Moderna shots were temporarily halted in Okinawa on Sunday after foreign materials were discovered in vials and syringes.The health ministry said later that needles may have been incorrectly inserted into vials, breaking off bits of the rubber stopper.""Whatever the reason (for the foreign matter) we have heard that there is no safety or other issues,"" health minister Norihisa Tamura said, adding that it was not uncommon for foreign material to enter a vial with other vaccines.""We will continue to gather information and report back."""
Biden considering boosters at 5 months. Bears will cry next week!!

"Needles not Vaccines .. Japanese need to read instructions before using it.This mistake cost billions yesterday. With this news and antibodies studies, we should be over 400 again today !"
I am betting on both MRNA and ZM for a quick rebound on oversold conditions
Moderna 94% Efficacy for 6 months after 2nd jab
"As of Aug. 8, 991 people had died in Japan after receiving shots of Pfizer Inc's vaccine and 11 after receiving Moderna's, but no causality between the injections and the deaths has been established, according to the health ministry. Adverse reactions have been reported at a frequency of 0.01% for the Moderna shot.In the fatalities reported on Saturday, each man had a fever the day after his second dose and died two days after getting the fever. There has been no evidence that their shots contained contaminants, a health ministry official told reporters."
Moderna saves lives Moderna does not cause death end of story
"""Moderna COVID-19 vaccine gets Health Canada approval for kids 12+""Why is MRNA not spiking way up with this news today? Anyone know why? It's dropping back down :("
Look what’s happening at zoom. The same thing will happen to moderna
Canada has approved Moderna for children 12 to 17.
"Most of my shares were purchased around 23-24 usd. Just wanted to thank those that are shorting the stock, a price opportunity for others to buy and hold for the long term. But, please stop making up scientific fantasy stories that discourage further vaccinations. My background is in theoretical quantum mechanics and microbiology. Moderna is a great buy!!!"
Squeeze alert...shorts profits gone
"Moderna's COVID-19 Shot Elicits Higher Antibodies Than Pfizer/BioNTech Jab, Fake news didn't report this￼￼"
All I can say is that moderna is the best!!Can’t hold it down. Go longGo moderna!!!!
"Just out:The Japanese government said no safety or efficacy issues had been identified and the suspension of the three Moderna batches was a precaution.“At this time, we do not have any evidence that these deaths are caused by the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine. It is important to conduct a formal investigation to determine whether there is any connection.""Fumie Sakamoto, the infection control manager at St. Luke’s International Hospital in Tokyo, cautioned against drawing a connection between the shots and the fatalities reported on Saturday.“There may only be a temporal relationship between vaccination and death,” Sakamoto told Reuters. “There are so many things we still don’t know to make any conclusions on these two cases.”"
I’m a buyer at this level.
"Looks like computerized bot sells that likely triggered stop losses that cascaded to take MRNA stock price down a nice notch from $390 to $381. This appears to have occurred simultaneously with other Covid related stocks BNTX and NVAX which are all down. Stay the course and keep your calm. MRNA will reverse back to the upside soon. Too many positives going for it with near term horizon full FDA approval and boosters forthcoming. Someone may be wanting to scoop up major shares on the cheap today before this one gets taken back UP and UP. If not today, next week. May be painful to watch and endure right now but that is all part of investing, there will always be ups and downs, stay the course. MRNA will reverse course back to the strong upside soon."
According to recent study from Hopkins Pfizer vaccine only 53% effective against delta variant while Moderna over 76% effective.
"Beside Covid-19, Moderna to begin human trials for two experimental HIV vaccines by using messenger RNA."
"Forbes:Research is also showing that protection provided by Covid-19 vaccines begins to wane after several months. These developments are making a real case for booster vaccinations and Moderna is perfectly poised to cater to this market with its mRNA technology which can be more quickly adapted to fight new variants. This could mean that Moderna’s highly lucrative Covid-19 vaccine revenues are likely to continue for the foreseeable future (rather than just being a one-off pandemic product), likely causing investors to re-rate the stock higher.Moderna has a large development pipeline that includes another nine vaccines and 13 therapeutics in areas including immuno-oncology and rare diseases. Four of the company’s developments, including its CMV vaccine and personalized cancer vaccine, are in the phase 2 trials and any positive data surrounding these developments could also help the stock. [1] With Moderna poised to generate big profits from its Covid-19 shot (as much as $10 billion this year), it will have the resources to bolster its pipeline further in the coming years.https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2021/08/17/moderna-stock-at-400-what-are-the-risks/"
"not this week, but soon, Moderna will beat it's last high of $498, it always does"
Great buy price. Let the kiddos play and try to scare. Hold strong. We all know it's going up.

39 unopened vials with contaminants from 1 lot are being investigated. That lot & 2 adjacent lots were pulled for safety inspections. So 3 lots totaling 1.6M doses are getting inspected to determine if more than 39 vials are contaminated. MRNA hasn't issued any statement stating the cause or the next step. ROVI produced them & TAKATA distributed them. That's all that's been released so far... GL LONGS.
