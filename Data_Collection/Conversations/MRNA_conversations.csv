"CAMBRIDGE, Mass., October 25, 2021--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Moderna Inc. (Nasdaq: MRNA), a biotechnology company pioneering messenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics and vaccines, today announced positive interim data from the Phase 2/3 study, called the KidCOVE study, of mRNA-1273, the Company’s vaccine candidate against COVID-19, in children 6 to under 12 years of age. This interim analysis showed a robust neutralizing antibody response after two doses of mRNA-1273 at the 50 µg dose level with a favorable safety profile. Moderna plans to submit these data to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), European Medicines Agency (EMA) and other global regulators in the near term."
400 by the end of the week?
"I watched the FDA advisory committee on Pfizer 5-11 yr old and come to the conclusion that the panels risk benefit discussion is unscientific. They mostly discuss moral responsibility and societal implications. One panel member that sits on the fda I believe and she’s the one in uniform actually states that the fda has an analysis of the adverse side effects risks scoring from the VAERS database. Given that they will have to extrapolate from other subgroups (12-17 most likely) I like to see those data published for the public to see especially the analysis of the risk scores with severity and occurrences. “VAERS is a passive reporting system, meaning it relies on individuals to send in reports of their experiences to CDC and FDA. VAERS is not designed to determine if a vaccine caused a health problem, but is especially useful for detecting unusual or unexpected patterns of adverse event reporting that might indicate a possible safety problem with a vaccine. This way, VAERS can provide CDC and FDA with valuable information that additional work and evaluation is necessary to further assess a possible safety concern.”https://vaers.hhs.gov/about.html"
Turned down the Pfizer Vax and got my Moderna booster…
What we need is approval for 12-17 and 5-11. Right now the market is pricing that out for us and its keeping us at 340. Once approval comes for those age groups we will see a large gap up.
"Moderna (MRNA) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth:Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Moderna (MRNA) reports results for the quarter ended September 2021. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 4, 2021, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Moderna would post earnings of $6.01 per share when it actually produced earnings of $6.46, delivering a surprise of +7.49%."
"Extremely light volume and narrow trading range . I believe that this is good, as a base price has formed. It is ready to catapult upwards."

"I know that its covid vaccine news is dominating Moderna SP, and it well should. But the real test of whether or not Moderna is the biotech Amazon DEPENDS on Moderna PROVING THAT IT'S NOW VALIDATED PLATFORM CAN BE EASILY EXPANDED TO ITS OTHER CANDIDATES. That a single success of candidates in that platform, in this case the mRNA-1273, will serve as catalysis for the success of the others. That is why in my opinion, the start of CMV phase 3 clinical trial is the single most important news this week."

Demands on Cov viccines are high in 2022. Pfizer is expecting 4 B doses and Moderna is expecting 2-3 B doses. At least I believe 2022 still a good year for vaccine makers. With that volumn estimation， Moderna should be over $500. Somebody may say vaccine requirements will drop in 2023. But who knows？Nobody can predict what will happen in 2023 accurately. Just like many people argued with Tesla two years ago. No body can force you to buy or sell stock. All are based on your own judgement.

"Moderna Announces First Participant Dosed in Phase 3 Pivotal Registration Study of Its mRNA Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Vaccine.--CMV is a latent virus that remains in the body for life after infection and can lead to lifelong medical conditions.--mRNA-1647 combines six mRNAs in one vaccine, which encode for proteins for the prevention of CMV infection.Moderna, Inc. (Nasdaq: MRNA), a biotechnology company pioneering messenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics and vaccines, today announced the first participant has been dosed in the Phase 3 pivotal registration study of mRNA-1647, the Company's cytomegalovirus (CMV) vaccine candidate. This study is known as CMVictory.""CMV is a complex, latent virus and represents a significant unmet medical need. The CDC estimates that 1 in 200 babies are born with CMV, and approximately 1 in 5 of them will have devastating sequelae such as hearing loss, seizures, and blindness. We believe that our mRNA vaccine technology is well-suited to provide protection against this latent virus,"" said Stephane Bancel, Moderna's Chief Executive Officer. ""The start of the second Phase 3 study in our company's history is an exciting milestone for Moderna and I would like to thank the Moderna team as well as our partners at clinical trial sites. This study will allow us to get closer to our goal of addressing this unmet need with a preventative mRNA vaccine against primary CMV infection.""CMV is a latent virus that remains in the body for life after infection. In adults, initial infection with CMV often goes undetected. The CDC estimates that over half of adults are infected by age 40. For most healthy individuals, CMV does not pose a long-term health risk, but it can lead to lifelong medical conditions. For some, including those with weakened immune systems or infants born with CMV infection, it can have serious consequences. A pregnant mother with an active CMV infection may pass the virus to her unborn child, resulting in congenital CMV infection. Although most infants with congenital CMV appear normal at birth, approximately 1 in 5 will have long-term health problems such as hearing loss, vision impairment, learning disabilities and decreased muscle strength and coordination.(1,2) Some newborns with congenital CMV appear very ill at birth with jaundice, rash, liver and spleen enla rgement, and seizures. Congenital CMV is the leading infectious cause of birth defects in the United States.(3)Moderna's mRNA vaccine portfolio includes candidates against respiratory viruses, candidates against tropical viruses, and candidates against latent viruses. Latent viruses remain in the body for life after infection. mRNA-1647 is the Company's first attempt to help protect people from latent virus infection with a vaccine. Moderna is also advancing vaccine candidates against other latent viruses including Epsten-Barr virus (EBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). EBV is a member of the herpesvirus family that includes CMV, herpes simplex virus (HSV), and varicella-zoster virus (VZV). EBV is spread through bodily fluids (e.g., saliva) and contracted primarily by young children and adolescents. It is a major cause of infectious mononucleosis (IM) and associated risks to other long-term medical conditions including an increased risk of developing multiple sclerosis by approximately 4 to 10-fold, certain lymphoproliferative disorders and cancers and autoimmune diseases(4,5). HIV is the virus responsible for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), a lifelong, progressive illness with no effective cure. Worldwide, approximately 38 million are currently living with HIV(6) ; including approximately 1.2 million in the U.S.(7) Approximately 2 million new infections are acquired worldwide each year, and approximately 690,000 of those people die.Cytomegalovirus is a genus of viruses in the order Herpesvirales, in the family Herpesviridae, in the subfamily Betaherpesvirinae."

"500mln doses total for 2021/2022. Revenue will be still in Billion+ even at lower price.Oct 29 (Reuters) - Moderna Inc (MRNA.O) on Friday announced a pact with the GAVI vaccine alliance to supply a further 56.5 million doses of its COVID-19 vaccine in the second quarter of next year to low- and middle-income countries.This will be in addition to an earlier commitment to supply 60 million doses in the second quarter of 2022 to GAVI, which co-leads the COVAX facility for equitable distribution of COVID-19 shots around the world.The COVAX facility, backed by the World Health Organization and GAVI, has delivered some 400 million COVID-19 vaccine doses to more than 140 low- and middle-income countries, but several countries run the risk of failing to meet WHO's target of 40% vaccination coverage by year-end. Moderna said the doses will be offered at a low price and GAVI continues to retain the option to procure 233 million additional doses in 2022, for a potential total of 500 million doses between this year and next."
