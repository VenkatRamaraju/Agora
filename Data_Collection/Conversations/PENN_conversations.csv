Approx. 33.4K $80 call options contracts that expire 10/29 changed hands today. That is an enormous bet. I don't see a similar hedge anywhere else in the future. I hope the buyer knows something!
SCR deal completed. I even got the cash value of my fractional shares.
SCR shareholder anyone?? We need SCR motivation here. PENN chat is dull...common SCR!!
"Did great in New Jersey in September, 4 million in gross revenue. Getting a piece of that market share."
Anyone know when they will have the option to buy a larger stake in Barstool?
Anyone with RBC Direct Investing who has their SCR.TO shares converted to PENN yet? I am still waiting!!!
"theres no way people are still holding when this stock is still down YTD right? with inflation you are just getting stuffed in a locker, bail and pick literally any other stock."
Falling prices 2 weeks prior to reporting what should be an earnings beat. Defies common sense. Casinos are packed.
Sports gaming in NJ: $PENN NJ had Sept market share of 5% vs up 2% m/m. $CZR NJ to 6% vs flat m/m and $MGM share increased to 16% from 9%/11% in Aug/July. DraftKings had 17% market share vs. 25%/20% over the past two months.
You guys realize they are pushing it down to get more shares before the earnings blowout next week…..
"Berenberg initiated coverage, buy. price target $95"
"SCR shares finally converted, glad to be apart of PENN"
"This is a total trading stock, buy low, sell high in a week or so."
"I've just been adopted into the Penn family & will hodl it. I bought SCR stock over a year ago because of the popularity of it's sports following app. It's the dominant player in Canada with over 4M active users nationally and over 1.4M in Ontario alone. Check it out if you haven't! Penn should see some gambling revenue soon as the provinces are opening up to the private sector soon. I'm thinking for the early December which is our CFL's grey cup - and they need the revenue! Relative to the US, our numbers are like another large state. But it all helps!"
"Hey! If you want to buy here and play it to 78-80 and then repeat then this is your stock, can’t get out of its own way. Easily my most frustrating stock"
"Need to sustain this trip back to the 80s now, I think 100 could be right around corner if all goes right and earnings provide great guidance.. Dave isn’t sleeping til 200, then it’s yacht party time"
earnings are going to make this stock rip violently higher
Man there is a committed seller here. Not big volume just enough to cap any rally. You have had 3 upgrades on this company in the last 30 days and it can not get out of its own way. The shorts know the stock has broken short term support and all they have to do is knock it down 30 cents on an up day and the algos will do the rest. Even zacks and Investors BD say it is undervalued.
California will put a homeless tax on the ballot tied to sports betting. is this why PENN has been trending down?
"Goldman Sachs reiterates Buy with a $115 price target, only 55+% higher than today, and price falls. There is a powerful short working this stock."
