"just jumped in, future bag holder reporting for duty"
"Launching in Tennessee, Arizona, Ontario and Quebec. I think it can go up higher"
Sold my SCR shares at a 76% gain. Bought 100 shares of Penn. excited to add more and hold for years and reap the rewards
Where Janet ??
Does PENN benefit off pizza sales?
Lost nearly all gains from a phenomenal earnings day. Hedge funds own this stock. Slowly sinking it back to the low 60’s. Makes no sense but when the system is fixed they have the big money and can do what they want
NFL pre games start next week. NFL season only a few weeks away. This is the sweet spot for PENN. $100.00 by end of September. $150.00 by Christmas.
https://twitter.com/stoolpresidente/status/1419720829588357122?s=20I smell a $PENN buyout ;)))))

Dave Portnoy Says Company Is in Talks With Major Sport to Air Games
85 today???
I am really annoyed one step forward and 10 backwards just want to exit without a loss its been 40 days
listening to Frank .... fly me to the 
Reversal in process. This will be 100 by october.
What's going on with the nosedive at the end of the day?
Possibly a buyout target from a deep pocket casino operator for the geographic diversity and growing online sports betting? ...just a theory...
Stopped going to Plainville. I couldn't get a beer at video poker bar or trotter bar. Also no one walking around serving. wrote email to Plainville and Penn management and got no response. Terrible way to run a company. No alcohol at a casino. You had to go into a regular restaurant to get a beer. I walked right by and out the door.

Welcome to options expiration Friday ladies and gentlemen. Games being played
"Volume is good today, expecting another run up of 3-4%, followed by red candles tomorrow"
"Will be back to triple digits and beyond in no time, this stock will dominate the market and there is no comparison."
I would like to thank Keith Gill for this pic. I did bail @130 but looking back this is the play that made me. GLTA I’m still holding GME AMC SNDL and recently with the CLOV. Meme stock multimillionaire here and why everyone want me to sell my AMC/GME?
$PENN $MRNA $RBLX $WISH
I miss Janet
PENN charts are still pointing down for the time being. I decided to hold my PUT's through the weekend.
This will be $140 soon
"The market dips are the perfect excuse to go stop loss hunting as it happened today, the hard part is to distinguish real drops from weak hands cleansing. For PENN it is clear it is the latter."
"The technical setup is great as we have a triple bottom formed in the 65-66 area, the stock is oversold, NFL season and further legalization is coming, the Covid curve is about to bend... get long or cover if you are short, cause the bounce is coming."
Down over 11% since a phenomenal earnings a week and half ago in a close to all time high’s market. Explain that one! Lol
"Given how solid this company is and how much upside it has, I have no doubt this dip truly is pure stop loss hunting"
Raise your hand if you are a new bag holder.
shorts big mad rn
Portnoy just announced the barstool Sportsbook coming to Colorado and Virginia next week
Did this stock have a 2:1 split or??
Weiss on CNBC just said one of the cheapest stocks out there. He bought last week and is happy with it.. sees massive growth potential
SCR holders waiting for acquisition thumbs up here and post your position.Excited to join PENN soon.900@33.65
Penn National Gaming is up 5.73% to 77.76
THE BOTTOM IS IN!! ADDING SHARES. NEXT STOP 110.
"Can we just let people make the right decisions for their family? If you want to get vaccinated or wear a mask fine, if not fine. I'm sure if no one went outside ever again some lives would be preserved but at what cost? This has been going on for like 18 months, time to move on and let people decide for themselves."
was at one of there casinos people wearing mask but the place was crowded o and I loss .
Now I am glad I sold when I sold. I will buy back even more if it drops below $70.
Why the drop with DRAFT kings is up???
I don't see any reason to own this debt machine. Next support is $43.
THIS ONE IS GOING TO THE MOON!!!!!!
and almost red in pre. citadel still short. worst market ever
The FED may ruin the momentum for the very short term on this and then we could see $85+
I been saying for a while now this stock will make a Tom Brady come back.
great day!
Can Wall Street really be this wrong? or is there something we don't know? How come DKNG's price action is way better than PENN's when PENN's is so much better in numbers?
the 80 shorts are hoping to get there by the end of the day the 75 have already waved the white flag
hope all is well in the gulf they have quite a few properties there ..
"Dipped my toes in, Numbers/futures look good.Double in a year???"
Barstool Sportsbook opening in New Jersey next week
Over $200 in a year! And you can take that to the bank!!!
300 shares premarket up over 2 grand in less than 3 hours
"Why would anyone sell at these levels - now is the time to be loading the truck, cause you might not see it back in the 60s ever again. We have more states legalizing, we have Canada up and running in a week, NFL season about to begin, the Delta variant will not lead to lockdowns, consumers are flush with cash... Is Afghanistan your reason to sell PENN?! Really?!"
"Kids, this Big Gobbler keeps hitting its head on DOWNsloping 5O DMA in secular bear. No touch, mmkay. We will let pips know when it is safe. It is a no touch until then. Easy Basic charting 1O1."
Goldman maintains Buy for Penn. Updates PT to $124 from $149. I'll take that all dayhttps://www.benzinga.com/quote/PENN
"Looking at the chart, moving averages are looking good for it to climb higher. Looking at the 4-hour chart it looks even better. Bullish"
"Really interesting watching opening night of NFL. Huge ad spending by Draft Kings, Fan Duel, and Caesars. Not one ad related to Penn. Barstool SB not having to spend on that while still being able to target new customers through other networks I think will really help going forward, especially with its younger demographic. Long this stock"
"If you look at the U.S. Gambling Index, the chart reads like PENN. Look at the weekly chart on $DJUSCA... the price doesn't want to go higher than the midband.... and the last 3 candles are stuck at the middle bollinger band resistance. PENN chart looks about the same on the weekly with the last 3 candles sitting just above the midband and below the the 50MA. I think PENN will trend down this week."
Nice pop
Why in the world is this selling off?
"The impression I get of this board for the mots part is one individual with multiple profiles having a conversation amongst themselves with the ultimate goal of scaring people out of their shares, probably getting paid $.01 per post LMAO!!!!!"
$100+ in September.
I’m loving this run
Dear gamblers if your looking to play the games this weekend TMC might help your bank roll. Moving towards a gamma squeeze and starting to talk on wsb and Stocktwits Up 11% after market
"I would buy the hell out of this at this level. I already control 7,000 shares in options for 2023. This think is a rocket after numbers come out from a full NFL season"
the shorts are looking like toast on friday
This half-off sale biscuit needs to clear 77 convincingly or else it is just a bearish head and shoulders. We suspect many got in at 120 and rode it ALL the way down and they should be very careful since this remains a SHORT for day traders. Massive resistance at 76.5 area.
im conservative in thinking how high my stock will grow but you you guys might be right about 100 real soon
"And so the launch begins. Buy more now? Get in? The whole idea is buy low sell high, right?"
Looks like the whole gambling industry is being impacted Looks at WYNN and others Same pattern
Does this continue tomorrow or do we get a slapped with a big red day
$Penn doing us right
Best performer on the S&P today the beast has awoken.
Volume still very low. Hmm 
Buy more… sweet sweet PENN
"$PENN also has one of the best relationships with it's customers in my opinion. If you live in a state where the barstool sportsbook is allowed, you know exactly what I'm talking about, the user experience is unmatched."
I finally got out at $83. Enough profit already. I will get back in if it drops. At this point it is just difficult to judge which way it will go.
i hope all this pain is worth in next year
"To think PENN will drop any lower than it’s current levels is preposterous. Short interest continues to increase with NFL right around the corner….it’s about to be a bad time to be a BEAR in the gambling industry. When PENN pumps up 5-10%, you better believe it will be all over your children’s and friends friend social media. And if you don’t understand what I am talking about….you already lost. Leave in glory or go down on flames…TO THE MOON."
JUST A THOUGHT - position of $PENN $DKNG $SCR $GENI going into the fall is a winning strategy. Pullbacks will likely be shallow and few through year's end.
This stock is a steal heading into the NFL season. If you don’t see that you have no clue about how incredibly big sports betting will become in the next 10 years
4 more house the shorts will be toast
"The company beat on earnings and revenue, it’s going in the right direction. Got to like the aggressiveness the take the digital gaming space"
Sorry guys I bought in Friday so this has no chance to go up
I also own $SCR $DKNG $GENI adding to all on dips. gl2a.
"Have a great weekend , Partners"
I bought at 65 because I like Dave portnoy and no reason else 
Opened the position today 
I've averaged up 3 times now. MP is estimated to own 15% of rare earths. It's like $DKNG or $MTTR or $UPST or $PENN or $ETHE or $TCNNF ...Buy the dips and be patient.
"Anyone who viewed this company as undervalued as I did after this amazing earnings report and strategic acquisition need to hold their shares. I'm a swing trader, and normally I would take my profit after buying in premarket. However if you look at the chart, we're just getting started. Over $80 would not surprise me next week."
"Let's not forget, this is a historically brick and mortar casino company in a transformative phase. Delta variant fears and low vaccine rates in hot spots have all gambling sector in the gutter. Over time, the disruption will occur. But for now, PENN gets lumped into the old school casino model. There is zero love right now for this sector. I'm am staying long, but my sights are set on the long term. Hang in there."
so why was this down last week?
Finally break-even on my PENN shares. Those initial shares over $110 have been painful the past few months.
ARE WE SQUEEZING?!!!!!! PENN & DKNG....BUY AND HOLD!
Will buy when price is $40
"Mark my words this the low of PENN, tomorrow is a big day. Earnings and first NFL pre-season game."
"I just heard about the acquisition this morning, saw the stock was down 2% to start the day and loaded up on shares... feel like I just got away with theft"
What does this mean??? (Penn National Gaming Option Alert: Jan 21 $150 Calls Sweep (3) near the Ask: 474 @ $0.7 vs 2384 OI)
Sold Today. We are rules based and must protect our profit at a 50% rate of ROI. May come back when the dump is over. No doubt the best gambling stock.
Has anyone else heard MGM might also be interested in PENN? A stretch but would have to pay a big premium.
The bottom is in. Added shares. Double down. gl2a.
"Once people learn how great THE SCORE is for Penn, this stock will moon "
I bought in yesterday for the first time. NFL will kick off soon as well as college football. Then NHL. If she dips I'll get more.
70 by lunch. 71 EOD
Their playing whack a mole again as usual.
Down again i am selling when it hits $84.50 seems some resistance there
"$101 estimate…with football ramping up, it’s gonna happen quickly!"
Penn shares made a Golden Cross. I sold out of PFE to double my already profitable position on PENN and DKNG. Enjoy Football season and enjoy the membership growth of on line gambling.
Any good portfolio manager knows to have a full position of $PENN $DKNG $SCR $GENI going into the fall. Pullbacks will likely be shallow and few through year's end.
I own penn and I made some college football bets today. been doing that for many years..the gov needs legalized it and tax it..
Breakout buy point.. finally broke through 75
It's a sinking ship
So penn was forming a Bull Flag similar to draftkings a huge spike from 65-84 pull back to 81 now breaking thru previous highs of 84 towards 85. We should a move higher to 90.
$80 by EOW?
PENN & DKNG BUY & HOLD
"Where you at Janet? We know you are lurking, how did Dave hurt you today#$%$"
to 100++?
"TO THE MOON! Football coming too, LFG!"
"I'm Back In on the AM Selloff..... I SOLD Last Week OVER $70....In Today 1,900 Shares @ $64.12..... Interested To See Where ThisSettles In The Next Few Days.."
Earnings reports and acquisition announcement exceeded even my wishful thinking. Glad that I averaged down as this was tanking instead of bailing. This should get back to triple digits by the next earnings call in early November.
"Great company in both the fundamentals and technicals, a leader in a growing and very profitable sector of mobile sports betting … yet sp down 50% from just 5 months ago …"
Sports betting just okay'd in Connecticut
Sold my 250 shares of SCR and bought 115 shares of PENN. This is better than the offer if PENN moves up because there is a fixed cash price plus 0.238? shares of PENN. Buying PENN now gets you the full share price increase instead of just 0.238.
Portnoy on the investor call. Snowden coming on CNBC at 12 eastern today. Should be interesting to hear.
Janet ran out of Her ALWAYS
"Milestone is exactly what it implied by its definitionIt’s not an Acquistion or megerLikely just a milestone of downloads, active customers or maybe monthly revenue Penn CEO was a bit hush on the conference call around how they were going to get stickiness of customersSaid he wasn’t going to chase customers just to jump over for a promotionBecause those people will move into the next promotionHe said something about waiting, sounded like some kind of announcement So maybe some milestone along with some other announcementMaybe another partnership or customer loyalty program etc But assuming the milestone will be interesting but not stock movingIn order for this to turn up to the 80s or 90s it’s going to take a good old fashion quarter crush followed by a big guidance raise"
About to come up on CNBC! Tune in!
"""It's time for my to fllyyyy"". Can't keep a great stock up 1XX% EPS Y/Y down too long."
Aaron where you at? What are your charts saying now? Sad man
i wouldnt want to be a short today the only one with a miniscule shot are the ones at 80 and miniscule is not where i would want to be
"If people had Green Bay in their parlay, that should've brought in huuuuge $$$ for Penn."
"Hold Strong guys, wait for their next report. Remember, they spend basically nothing on Marketing and are profitable. Valuation will soar"
"How can anyone argue that this stock isn't a absolute smash hold. If you don't see it doubling from here in the next 2 years you don't understand sports gambling and the demand for it. Also, do some research on how much money DK and FanDuel are spending on marketing.... it's UNREAL! Penn spends hardly anything on marketing, it's all driven by barstool. Simple finance folks"
Have you guys heard of the Sling TV partnership?
"Trolls are out in full force this morning, why is that? None of these people own penn so they likely are worried about the news surrounding the stock as a positive and trying to persuade people from buying with their lousy opinions. Buy and hold, this isn’t a get rich overnight scheme but I can assure this company is going up"
power hour on reverse
Just take the buyout from $PENN already like everyone else!!!!
It was $14 before. Good entry be 21 ~~
$150 within a yr
Triple bottom at 64 for what it’s worth.. gambling sector is full of bargains. Covid will peak sooner than later and patience will be rewarded
Surprised no Janet today!!! She must have found another stock to torment With her PMS negativity LOL
PENN closed above the 100 Day ema (79.65). The 200 Day ema sits at $88.88.
The best way to win in gambling stocks that have on line as a driver is buy Both Penn and DKNG Hold until 3 weeks after Super Bowl then decide what you want to do.
Goldman’s Sachs has a $153 tag on this…get with program…98% of these posters here are bums…buy calls…
We might see 80 today. The Russell 2000 needs to touch 224.
"People need to start seeing the big picture here.. news just out “Barstool Sports and MLB have engaged in ""significant negotiations about having national midweek games on the site’s platforms.” Penn live betting as barstool televises games."
MAJOR BREAKOUT COMING - PENN = -6.08% BELOW SMA200 - You are welcome - God Luck!!
Beautiful day today
Janet?
I bought 500 this morning to add to my score win win
I made nice $ on this last year. Bailed with a very nice profit. Good luck. Hold hold hold but when you see it happening (if it does) sell and jump back in
"good week, get ready next weeek"
SCR GANG checkin in! LFG! been holding SCR for 3 years now
Stock well positioned for a legendary run that will exceed last year. Canada sports gambling opens up this week and Penn one of the major players. Not to mention Penn expansion into new states. Target $150 by January.
So what’s with these gains the past days? No real news besides the SCR purchase.
"This has nothing to do with fundamentals, Hedge funds are positioning themselves to pay for the short squeeze in AMC, therefore they are abandoning their other short positions."
This stock will likely be over $200 this time next year if we keep getting ER’s like this one!
It’s official we are above the 50 Day moving average.
"A transfer of wealth. Buy millions of dollars of $SCR, get your parent company to buy them out, cash out of $SCR when it goes up 75%. Good way to clean money for Dave, just wonder if the SEC agrees."
Here come the upgrades. $1.17 in a seasonally weak quarter!! They could be at $6 eps this time next year. Stock will be at 120!
I look at this everyday and just watch it go up $3-4
When is the exact ex? record day for buying SCR.Thanks.
Let’s squeeze this
Alright betting the house
"Wells Fargo starts off coverage of Penn National Gaming (NASDAQ:PENN) with an Equal Weight rating. The cautious view on Penn stands out with the firm doling out Overweight ratings on Caesars Entertainment, Churchill Downs, DraftKings, MGM Resorts and Boyd Gaming."
This will run to 200 with the AMC short squeeze. I feel the same hedge funds in Amc are in this stock. They are the ones that pushed it to 150 then dropped it to 64. And Now they know the jig is up. No more naked shorting to over manipulate the hell out of stocks.
Where are all the people that were on here this morning bashing the stock.. looks like the market woke up and realizes the potential this deal has
"Hello, I'm new to Penn. I bought 1000 shares today. Just curious as to if anyone is worried about the almost 12 billion in debt it shows? Please serious responses only. Thanks"
I have a feeling this won't move much until SCR deal is finalized.
Finished red 12 of last 14 trading days. Hedge funds are unrelentingly tanking this
"A red finish for the 4th day in a row after a phenomenal earnings report ? Makes no logical sense, other than the fact that the shorts do what they want"
5 weeks ago I predicted that PENN would purchase either GAN or SCR.Today they announced the purchase of SCR.
Wow - what info wee sellers at the open using? Seems somebody was telling fibs about the company to buy it cheaper or get options cheaper. Sad how trading works. IMHO
I am waiting for a dip entry point today. I already have quite a boatload in PENN and DKNG but both are growing sales at over 400%. Too early for me to do it now but I will probably be doing yet today. Down 2.19 currently.
All of the orders routed to the dark pools are finally being shown on the lit exchanges. T plus 35.
Very odd huge dip
Something wrong here
the shorts are all in jeopardy today from 80 on down
Is there a hazing for us Score folks coming on board?
2 hours and there will be alot of sorry shorts from 75 to 80 no chance
All long just hold strong football is less than a month away. These hedge funds are shorting this stock to force the weak hands out.
Easily $100 after Q4 numbers come out
Bill c218 legal now aug 27 in Canada single games sports betting. Penn just bought score . Buy baby buy
This stock will run when the NFL seasons starts.
I have made lots of profit already here. I am getting tempted to cash out the profits. Any opinion?
"Uptrend may be upon us, lower highs, and higher highs for 5 plus days could mean the lows are behind us. I remember last summer we started gaining momentum before NFL"
"question - anyone located near one of these properties to report on ""foot traffic?"" I consider these casinos to be more local traffic that tourist. Locals seem to be more consistent gamblers ... probably no airplane ride involved to visit the properties either. Should trade differently that other ""vegas"" style casinos."
$64 lol
"How can this stock continue to perform so badly after great earnings? The outlook is excellent with the upcoming NFL season, new states opening sports books, casinos opened and humming along. This is why average investors HATE the markets"

"Long time SCR holder, what a pleasant way to wake up this morning. Sold my shares in SCR and bought PENN. Excited to see this get back to $140."
Took profit .. historically PENN drops in sept and oct and I also don’t trust the market .. next 30 days will be extremely bumpy
Going to the moon!!! Well positioned to dominate an exploding industry folks
"Solid company the clear financial winner along with DKNG but this will be making more money for a long time. Buy both today for big long term gains. We have College and Pro Football and post season Championships coming and MLB playoffs along with World Series and Super Bowl and Post Season College Bowls and Championship Tournament. Big dollars and two stocks are going to disproportionately gain, PENN and DKNG. Good luck to all"
Barstool sports book is officially live in State on NJ !! Let’s goo 
"I know very well this message will be deleted as quickly as it's posted.some body at higher echelon should look at the way Charles town, Hollywood casino ,W.Va is operating now a days. Following is a brief description.* Ticket cashing machine are not operating all over the floor with few exceptions. Dollar change is not tender to the customers.* Majority of the ATM machine is operated by the casino and the customers received no cash but a receipt to take to the cashier with more than a hour long wait with heavy duty fee.* Cafeteria menu prices are extremely high comparing to other casinos.* after the pandemic, stop altogether complementary drinks on floor.I hope the management will not take it as a criticism, but suggestion for improving the daily operation which will bring more revenue and hence increasing the stock price as well."
ive never seen a stock be red every single day for 7 months
Consolidating before the football season and should rise higher in September.
"This stock is so cheap compared to Draftkings. 2x sales and PE of only 25 now after earnings. This is a double by Superbowl,$150.00 target"
This is going back up to the highs 120$ soon 
just good old fashion stock manipulationpump and sell at end of August to take little mans moneyreally nothing new for wall street suits
"Barstool Sportsbook and TheScoreBet coming to Ontario, let's goo"
I think the Fall schedule will be very kind to $PENN $DKNG $SCR $GENI . Holding PENN thru 200.
"With single event sports betting in Canada becoming legal tomorrow night, do you think we will hear word soon on TheScore Bet app being released in some provinces? With NFL and NHL around the corner this would be a big boost for both SCR and PENN."
breakout boys
Has anyone used the PENN sports book and the DKNG book? Not legal where I am at and I am curious after today's beating...
Dave just posted (in the last hour) a picture of cactus. He clearly is in Arizona. The announcement has something to do with Arizona going live with online gaming any day now. He also mentioned during a pizza review he posted today that this is probably the biggest announcement in barstool history. Not sure why? Not sure why arizona going live is bigger than any other state. They must have a big partnership to announce? Maybe a full barstool branded casino? I don't know.. Something like that. I still dont see how that's bigger news for barstool then the Penn acquisition. But who knows. The announcement 100% has to do with arizona..good luck to the longs tomorrow 
Wow! Is this a 20 dollar stock or a 110 dollar stock? Didn't it just have a positive earnings surprise?

Bought in yesterday and already strongly regretting it.

Buy the dips. Thank me after football season when there are AT LEAST 10 Barstool Sportsbook locations.

One Green Day on earnings day and it’s reverted right back to red everyday since. Slowly sinking right back to mid 60’s. The shorts came right back after getting squeezed last week on earnings day and slowly tanking this again. Incredible
"Vol quite light for such a move. So far, this pattern just short covering panic/confirmed a bearish head and shoulders today. Possible retest to 71 area on light vol would be constructive long."

bought at the dip this morning at 64. 59 what a difference an hour makes
Looks like effin shorts established a new baseline pump it to higher 84s then start dumping this has happened twice this week
