Easily $100 after Q4 numbers come out
"PENN has ZERO exposure to Macau, am I missing something?"
i started buying penn stock at 17 dollars bought again for a 23 dollar average sold some at 92 but still have a lot left
"Given how solid this company is and how much upside it has, I have no doubt this dip truly is pure stop loss hunting"
Triple bottom at 64 for what it’s worth.. gambling sector is full of bargains. Covid will peak sooner than later and patience will be rewarded
This company is better than MGM and market cap is half....Buy hold buy more...
hope u bought the dip
When is the exact ex? record day for buying SCR.Thanks.
"Solid company the clear financial winner along with DKNG but this will be making more money for a long time. Buy both today for big long term gains. We have College and Pro Football and post season Championships coming and MLB playoffs along with World Series and Super Bowl and Post Season College Bowls and Championship Tournament. Big dollars and two stocks are going to disproportionately gain, PENN and DKNG. Good luck to all"
Penn National Gaming is up 5.73% to 77.76
Sorry guys I bought in Friday so this has no chance to go up
$ELYS Washington D.C. Sees First Local Business Approved for Sports Betting LicenseThey saw the future in US sports betting with class B$DKNG and $PENN probably would pay a fortune for this alone
So penn was forming a Bull Flag similar to draftkings a huge spike from 65-84 pull back to 81 now breaking thru previous highs of 84 towards 85. We should a move higher to 90.
(http://Thetraderguide.com) is a must for any trader. Their watchlist which covers pre-market movers is one of the best researched in the industry. I don’t start trading without reading their daily email each morning!
Over $200 in a year! And you can take that to the bank!!!
"Really interesting watching opening night of NFL. Huge ad spending by Draft Kings, Fan Duel, and Caesars. Not one ad related to Penn. Barstool SB not having to spend on that while still being able to target new customers through other networks I think will really help going forward, especially with its younger demographic. Long this stock"
"Wells Fargo starts off coverage of Penn National Gaming (NASDAQ:PENN) with an Equal Weight rating. The cautious view on Penn stands out with the firm doling out Overweight ratings on Caesars Entertainment, Churchill Downs, DraftKings, MGM Resorts and Boyd Gaming."
"Looking at the chart, moving averages are looking good for it to climb higher. Looking at the 4-hour chart it looks even better. Bullish"
"Barstool Sportsbook and TheScoreBet coming to Ontario, let's goo"
$80 by EOW?
"Same thing happened last year at this time, stock kept selling off until end of October, then tripled from November to SUperbowl. Time to buy your shares and enjoy the ride up, $150+ by Super Sunday."
May this rise continue and annihilate all shorts in its path.
I've averaged up 3 times now. MP is estimated to own 15% of rare earths. It's like $DKNG or $MTTR or $UPST or $PENN or $ETHE or $TCNNF ...Buy the dips and be patient.
Has anyone else heard MGM might also be interested in PENN? A stretch but would have to pay a big premium.
Seems like a disproportionate price collapse today compared to other gambling stocks.
Why in the world is this selling off?
Finally break-even on my PENN shares. Those initial shares over $110 have been painful the past few months.
we lost alot of our early gains but the shorts are toast
What’s the news of this and $SCR together?
I think Dave made the wrong hedge fund manager mad.. it looks like the stock has a big short. If anyone else has any knowledgeable feedback please share. I’d like to hear peoples insights.. every time it looks like it’s about to run it’s get pushed back down.
Sold my 250 shares of SCR and bought 115 shares of PENN. This is better than the offer if PENN moves up because there is a fixed cash price plus 0.238? shares of PENN. Buying PENN now gets you the full share price increase instead of just 0.238.
Can someone explain what is going on? No bad news why the drop?
THE BOTTOM IS IN!! ADDING SHARES. NEXT STOP 110.
Nice pop
Buy Buy Buy
Anyone wondering why 8% increase today. It is due to PENN's subsidiary Barstool Sports' one bite frozen pizza getting a deal with Wal-Mart
"Great company in both the fundamentals and technicals, a leader in a growing and very profitable sector of mobile sports betting … yet sp down 50% from just 5 months ago …"
Welcome to options expiration Friday ladies and gentlemen. Games being played
Something wrong here
lets get this to $100 by thanksgiving GOBBLE GOBBLE!!!!!!
"The market dips are the perfect excuse to go stop loss hunting as it happened today, the hard part is to distinguish real drops from weak hands cleansing. For PENN it is clear it is the latter."
CT postpones gaming in the state
Looks like effin shorts established a new baseline pump it to higher 84s then start dumping this has happened twice this week
Stopped going to Plainville. I couldn't get a beer at video poker bar or trotter bar. Also no one walking around serving. wrote email to Plainville and Penn management and got no response. Terrible way to run a company. No alcohol at a casino. You had to go into a regular restaurant to get a beer. I walked right by and out the door.
I have made lots of profit already here. I am getting tempted to cash out the profits. Any opinion?
lots of shorts friday lets hope we can rise a little and stop them but what ive noticed in other stocks they usually get the job done
the shorts are looking like toast on friday
"This has nothing to do with fundamentals, Hedge funds are positioning themselves to pay for the short squeeze in AMC, therefore they are abandoning their other short positions."
I own penn and I made some college football bets today. been doing that for many years..the gov needs legalized it and tax it..
"The shorts and MMs continue to beat this down. When they finally decide to take it the other way, it will rain a sunny day. Until then clinch and buckle up. Good entry point here for a LONG position."
do we keep todays gain or see 72 again? Lets vote i see 72 coming once more
$150 within a yr
Still cheap both DKNG and PENN have a pretty clear run to 100
"#$%$ to high price REO, not great, new business legal bookie, party is over"
"question - anyone located near one of these properties to report on ""foot traffic?"" I consider these casinos to be more local traffic that tourist. Locals seem to be more consistent gamblers ... probably no airplane ride involved to visit the properties either. Should trade differently that other ""vegas"" style casinos."
Weak hands do not make money. Looks like the shake down is complete and PENN finally ready to move up to 100 by December.
whos ready to test the yearly low????
This is going back up to the highs 120$ soon 
Beautiful day today
Bill c218 legal now aug 27 in Canada single games sports betting. Penn just bought score . Buy baby buy
"A red finish for the 4th day in a row after a phenomenal earnings report ? Makes no logical sense, other than the fact that the shorts do what they want"
"You are holding on the way down. Dow is at 35000, Nasdaq at 15000, and the sell off is coming. You haven’t Sold. It’s going to get crushed with everything else. This is how Wall Street makes money. Retail investors hold to the bottom. Cry all the way down. This will get extremely cheap. Then buy"
"Rich valuation, a reasonable price is 50."
"Hold Strong guys, wait for their next report. Remember, they spend basically nothing on Marketing and are profitable. Valuation will soar"
Steve Weiss is a #$%$!! 2 weeks ago on CNBC he was ALL IN on PENN!!! #$%$!
im conservative in thinking how high my stock will grow but you you guys might be right about 100 real soon
What type of earnings are we expecting nov 4th ? Better then last q?
Took profit .. historically PENN drops in sept and oct and I also don’t trust the market .. next 30 days will be extremely bumpy
"Let’s hang tight for another ride! Once we see Delta peak out, it will ride again!"
"If you look at the U.S. Gambling Index, the chart reads like PENN. Look at the weekly chart on $DJUSCA... the price doesn't want to go higher than the midband.... and the last 3 candles are stuck at the middle bollinger band resistance. PENN chart looks about the same on the weekly with the last 3 candles sitting just above the midband and below the the 50MA. I think PENN will trend down this week."
This will be $140 soon
Weaks are so shaken off this puppy. I'm not technic but that's a sexy chart.
Sold Today. We are rules based and must protect our profit at a 50% rate of ROI. May come back when the dump is over. No doubt the best gambling stock.
ARE WE SQUEEZING?!!!!!! PENN & DKNG....BUY AND HOLD!
portnoy seems desperate with all the hoodie promotions. I think DKNG and others are swamping them in share.
This stock will run when the NFL seasons starts.
Janet?
was at one of there casinos people wearing mask but the place was crowded o and I loss .
"Portnoy posted video on Twitter today that has a lot of good knowledge in it, suggest you watch and emphasizes why they are the play in the gambling sector over $Dkng and everyone else"
rhe shorts look like ti could be real trouble friday
"50% off from its highs and blown away by CZR on its stock performance. Jay has got lots of work to do just to try to catch up, good luck Davie boy"
Sentiment is coming back..Momentum building as we near earnings. Shorts gonna get squeezed big time
Looks like the whole gambling industry is being impacted Looks at WYNN and others Same pattern
big rally today sad i sold my chdn at 220 they just sold the chicago bears a valuable piece of property
People who can't go to Vegas will use Penn to fulfill their gambling needs...
"And so the launch begins. Buy more now? Get in? The whole idea is buy low sell high, right?"
Will buy when price is $40
"Launching in Tennessee, Arizona, Ontario and Quebec. I think it can go up higher"
16 dollars in a little over two weeksNow that’s volatile Hope to see a basic bounce back to mod 70s soon
Now I am glad I sold when I sold. I will buy back even more if it drops below $70.
Barstool Sportsbook opening in New Jersey next week
Reversal in process. This will be 100 by october.
MAJOR BREAKOUT COMING - PENN = -6.08% BELOW SMA200 - You are welcome - God Luck!!
In case you missed it.. Roth capital initiated coverage on $Penn with a BUY at a 107 PT and Sell on $Dkng with PT of 41.. do with that as you will
Does this company make all the pens in the world?
Why the drop with DRAFT kings is up???
Opened the position today 
portnoy seems to be panicking. all these sweatshirt promos ???I think it's law of diminishing returns with the Barstool crowd. DKNG and BetMGM likely gaining large market share.
Stock is poised for a move one way or the other. Place your bets……
quadruple bottom in on daily chart... let's rally the close. big nfl game tomorrow let's go PENN!
I am waiting for a dip entry point today. I already have quite a boatload in PENN and DKNG but both are growing sales at over 400%. Too early for me to do it now but I will probably be doing yet today. Down 2.19 currently.

My Friday is feeling excellent!
This half-off sale biscuit needs to clear 77 convincingly or else it is just a bearish head and shoulders. We suspect many got in at 120 and rode it ALL the way down and they should be very careful since this remains a SHORT for day traders. Massive resistance at 76.5 area.
"Man, I don't know at this point... Does someone have some information regarding the deal or bad news in general? $PENN keeps going higher and this keeps going down. Going green intraday doesn't even mean anything anymore. I hope we get updated on the deal ASAP.Anyway IMO, in 5 years DKNG will either be 5x or $0. All the acquisitions and risks they are taking will either go very well or bankrupt them..."
"Sport gambling is a real business. World Series, super bowl, nba, and college sports. A stage that would cost billions to create is offered to gamblers for free. No big investment in real property, up keep etc…..Draft King, penn and others will grab market share. The market will grow and other products will be introduced. Penn has earnings and has pulled back to attractive levels…..BUY"
Casinos every place have I have visited have been packed. Football season is underway. Online betting market is increasing. I think anybody betting that PENN will not beat earnings is ignoring what is in plain site.
Can Wall Street really be this wrong? or is there something we don't know? How come DKNG's price action is way better than PENN's when PENN's is so much better in numbers?
"Booming Industry, does not even take into account college betting.AGA Research Predicts Record 45.2 Million Americans Will Wager on 2021 NFL SeasonThe number of Americans planning to bet on the NFL has increased 36% y-o-y to 45.2 millionEight more states have legalized betting since 2020, while NFL fan enthusiasm has also grownAround 5 million will wager online this season, representing substantial y-o-y growth of 73%The US gaming sector saw record monthly revenue in July, reaching $4.83bn for the month"
Down again i am selling when it hits $84.50 seems some resistance there
I bought at 65 because I like Dave portnoy and no reason else

It’s official we are above the 50 Day moving average.
just good old fashion stock manipulationpump and sell at end of August to take little mans moneyreally nothing new for wall street suits
PENN about to get the NFL gold rush! The run to $100 a share is happening.
"Good company sick stock, all casino's higher and this is lower. Same story every day? The only casino with earnings and sports betting"
So what’s with these gains the past days? No real news besides the SCR purchase.
The best way to win in gambling stocks that have on line as a driver is buy Both Penn and DKNG Hold until 3 weeks after Super Bowl then decide what you want to do.
Consolidating before the football season and should rise higher in September.
nfl season rocket ship just like you guys said! lol!
"have to wait for the next earnings, hopefully they blow the estimates out of the water"
This will run to 200 with the AMC short squeeze. I feel the same hedge funds in Amc are in this stock. They are the ones that pushed it to 150 then dropped it to 64. And Now they know the jig is up. No more naked shorting to over manipulate the hell out of stocks.
I hope whoever is shorting this gets destroyed.. they were fed a bone with the market sale off but we were about to take off when we hit the 80s. Fully expect it to resume
Barstool sports book is officially live in State on NJ !! Let’s goo 
Does PENN benefit off pizza sales?
"It is very interesting to compare the statistics (from Yahoo) for the gaming stocks that come up to compare to PENN. Pull up CZR, WYNN, MGM, and DKNG. Check out the P/E ratio's, both trailing and forward. Also earning, price/book ratios, price to sales, enterprise value/revenue. Look at the earnings estimates for the last 4 quarters and how PENN beat 3 out of 4 times. None of the others beat 3/4 of the time.If any/all of those other stocks deserve a rally, then PENN absolutely does as well. I think it is just a matter of time before what is obvious to me becomes increasingly apparent to the gaming sector investment market. I think it is time to buy more. I think there will be a run up into earnings."
"Vol quite light for such a move. So far, this pattern just short covering panic/confirmed a bearish head and shoulders today. Possible retest to 71 area on light vol would be constructive long."
"I would buy the hell out of this at this level. I already control 7,000 shares in options for 2023. This think is a rocket after numbers come out from a full NFL season"
shorts big mad rn
"Barstool App wouldn't work on sunday. wouldn't recognize location, then couldn't login at all. they must have lost a lot of business on opening NFL weekend. bettors #$%$ off and may look for more reliable app."
85 today???
"$101 estimate…with football ramping up, it’s gonna happen quickly!"
under valued should be in the nineties if not more.
"The technical setup is great as we have a triple bottom formed in the 65-66 area, the stock is oversold, NFL season and further legalization is coming, the Covid curve is about to bend... get long or cover if you are short, cause the bounce is coming."
Jeff Mills on Fast Money has $Penn as his final trade.. starting to pick up steam from the talking heads with him and Weiss on board now
we are flying higher today
Sports betting just okay'd in Connecticut
Surprised no Janet today!!! She must have found another stock to torment With her PMS negativity LOL
I think the Fall schedule will be very kind to $PENN $DKNG $SCR $GENI . Holding PENN thru 200.
We might see 80 today. The Russell 2000 needs to touch 224.
Stock well positioned for a legendary run that will exceed last year. Canada sports gambling opens up this week and Penn one of the major players. Not to mention Penn expansion into new states. Target $150 by January.
Cup and Handle Chart forming now. Bet on the Breakout
Why are we down so much pre market?
"really instills confidence when we go down on a big market rally , great ."
This stock is a steal heading into the NFL season. If you don’t see that you have no clue about how incredibly big sports betting will become in the next 10 years
"People need to start seeing the big picture here.. news just out “Barstool Sports and MLB have engaged in ""significant negotiations about having national midweek games on the site’s platforms.” Penn live betting as barstool televises games."
"this stock wants to go up big time...Shorts, day traders get out of the way. Y'all going to miss it"
listening to Frank .... fly me to the 
"Seems like I see a lot of ad's about Draftkings on tv. Never anything about Barstool or Penn. Doesn't the Br#$%$ for Penn realize that 90 to 95% of gamblers DO NOT change Bookies once they are comfortable trusting another? Once a gambler finds ""My Bookie"" he never changes. So, with all of the advertising Draftkings puts on the air the more popular they become and their client base grows like a cancer between friends and family by word of mouth. Looks like Draftkings is kicking Penn's #$%$ in the PR Dept. Is there even a Penn or a Barstool sports? How do you know? This company is like a Wall Flower!"
"FINV, PAYO, PSFE, STAF and MVST and NIO and ASTR are your favorite diamonds "
"With single event sports betting in Canada becoming legal tomorrow night, do you think we will hear word soon on TheScore Bet app being released in some provinces? With NFL and NHL around the corner this would be a big boost for both SCR and PENN."
"This will rocket  to the moon with AMC, because I feel the same hedge funds are in both stocks. It will be a rocket  to the "
Goldman’s Sachs has a $153 tag on this…get with program…98% of these posters here are bums…buy calls…
Weiss on CNBC just said one of the cheapest stocks out there. He bought last week and is happy with it.. sees massive growth potential
Score and with Canada is a great deal what Pain release old song but I am going to buy more since I am getting more shares and pain with my score play I read somewhere that they increased the share percentage to 50 %..hope its true like .options at this pount
"Why would anyone sell at these levels - now is the time to be loading the truck, cause you might not see it back in the 60s ever again. We have more states legalizing, we have Canada up and running in a week, NFL season about to begin, the Delta variant will not lead to lockdowns, consumers are flush with cash... Is Afghanistan your reason to sell PENN?! Really?!"
Best performer on the S&P today the beast has awoken.
PENN & DKNG BUY & HOLD
"""It's time for my to fllyyyy"". Can't keep a great stock up 1XX% EPS Y/Y down too long."
Penn shares made a Golden Cross. I sold out of PFE to double my already profitable position on PENN and DKNG. Enjoy Football season and enjoy the membership growth of on line gambling.
