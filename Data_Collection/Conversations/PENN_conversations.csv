So what’s with these gains the past days? No real news besides the SCR purchase.
People who can't go to Vegas will use Penn to fulfill their gambling needs...
The best way to win in gambling stocks that have on line as a driver is buy Both Penn and DKNG Hold until 3 weeks after Super Bowl then decide what you want to do.
Stock well positioned for a legendary run that will exceed last year. Canada sports gambling opens up this week and Penn one of the major players. Not to mention Penn expansion into new states. Target $150 by January.
When is the exact ex? record day for buying SCR.Thanks.
This stock is a steal heading into the NFL season. If you don’t see that you have no clue about how incredibly big sports betting will become in the next 10 years
Sold my 250 shares of SCR and bought 115 shares of PENN. This is better than the offer if PENN moves up because there is a fixed cash price plus 0.238? shares of PENN. Buying PENN now gets you the full share price increase instead of just 0.238.
"With single event sports betting in Canada becoming legal tomorrow night, do you think we will hear word soon on TheScore Bet app being released in some provinces? With NFL and NHL around the corner this would be a big boost for both SCR and PENN."
MAJOR BREAKOUT COMING - PENN = -6.08% BELOW SMA200 - You are welcome - God Luck!!
im conservative in thinking how high my stock will grow but you you guys might be right about 100 real soon
"The technical setup is great as we have a triple bottom formed in the 65-66 area, the stock is oversold, NFL season and further legalization is coming, the Covid curve is about to bend... get long or cover if you are short, cause the bounce is coming."
"And so the launch begins. Buy more now? Get in? The whole idea is buy low sell high, right?"
"Vol quite light for such a move. So far, this pattern just short covering panic/confirmed a bearish head and shoulders today. Possible retest to 71 area on light vol would be constructive long."
"$101 estimate…with football ramping up, it’s gonna happen quickly!"
Reversal in process. This will be 100 by october.
"This has nothing to do with fundamentals, Hedge funds are positioning themselves to pay for the short squeeze in AMC, therefore they are abandoning their other short positions."
Barstool Sportsbook opening in New Jersey next week
Finally break-even on my PENN shares. Those initial shares over $110 have been painful the past few months.
We might see 80 today. The Russell 2000 needs to touch 224.
Penn shares made a Golden Cross. I sold out of PFE to double my already profitable position on PENN and DKNG. Enjoy Football season and enjoy the membership growth of on line gambling.
