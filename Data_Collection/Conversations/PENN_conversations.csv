"I know very well this message will be deleted as quickly as it's posted.some body at higher echelon should look at the way Charles town, Hollywood casino ,W.Va is operating now a days. Following is a brief description.* Ticket cashing machine are not operating all over the floor with few exceptions. Dollar change is not tender to the customers.* Majority of the ATM machine is operated by the casino and the customers received no cash but a receipt to take to the cashier with more than a hour long wait with heavy duty fee.* Cafeteria menu prices are extremely high comparing to other casinos.* after the pandemic, stop altogether complementary drinks on floor.I hope the management will not take it as a criticism, but suggestion for improving the daily operation which will bring more revenue and hence increasing the stock price as well."
Finally break-even on my PENN shares. Those initial shares over $110 have been painful the past few months.
This will absolutely positively be red tomorrow morning. This is headed to 60. Will be down 60-65% before this stops then get stuck for years
Dave Portnoy Says Company Is in Talks With Major Sport to Air Games
85 today???
"Green? Who would have thought, the big boys thank you for the cheap shares! LMAO!"
Back to $3.75 where it belongs....
some news broke i guess
"Anyone who viewed this company as undervalued as I did after this amazing earnings report and strategic acquisition need to hold their shares. I'm a swing trader, and normally I would take my profit after buying in premarket. However if you look at the chart, we're just getting started. Over $80 would not surprise me next week."
Has to break $75 and downward channel to become truly bullish...
About to come up on CNBC! Tune in!
what are your guy's thoughts on earnings?
"With single event sports betting in Canada becoming legal tomorrow night, do you think we will hear word soon on TheScore Bet app being released in some provinces? With NFL and NHL around the corner this would be a big boost for both SCR and PENN."
Anyone else getting killed in the market this summer?
70 by lunch. 71 EOD
Sports betting just okay'd in Connecticut
Long time Score holder and I’ve just been adopted into the penn family & rather happy! For those not familiar with Score check out the app. I don’t know a better sports app & have checked out many. Feel free compare and let me know.
Not done dropping. Still green and will close red. Overvalued and overhyped. Market is going to correct all week and this with it
Wow - what info wee sellers at the open using? Seems somebody was telling fibs about the company to buy it cheaper or get options cheaper. Sad how trading works. IMHO
MAJOR BREAKOUT COMING - PENN = -6.08% BELOW SMA200 - You are welcome - God Luck!!
What’s going on with penn and Arizona ????
"Hi everyone, I'm new to Penn gaming. Just invested $23,000 in 300 shares. Good move in anyones opinion? The stock seems beaten down for some reason."
PENN closed above the 100 Day ema (79.65). The 200 Day ema sits at $88.88.
"I’ve been day trading for years and I’m so glad I finally found (http://Pick-stocks.com). They’re pre-market watchlists cover all the latest market-moving news, and they don’t beat you down with tons of ads. Highly recommend!"
Dave just posted (in the last hour) a picture of cactus. He clearly is in Arizona. The announcement has something to do with Arizona going live with online gaming any day now. He also mentioned during a pizza review he posted today that this is probably the biggest announcement in barstool history. Not sure why? Not sure why arizona going live is bigger than any other state. They must have a big partnership to announce? Maybe a full barstool branded casino? I don't know.. Something like that. I still dont see how that's bigger news for barstool then the Penn acquisition. But who knows. The announcement 100% has to do with arizona..good luck to the longs tomorrow 
One Green Day on earnings day and it’s reverted right back to red everyday since. Slowly sinking right back to mid 60’s. The shorts came right back after getting squeezed last week on earnings day and slowly tanking this again. Incredible
So what’s with these gains the past days? No real news besides the SCR purchase.
$Penn doing us right
I been saying for a while now this stock will make a Tom Brady come back.
Is there a hazing for us Score folks coming on board?
I'm long on PENN
4 more house the shorts will be toast
Bill c218 legal now aug 27 in Canada single games sports betting. Penn just bought score . Buy baby buy
"Why would anyone sell at these levels - now is the time to be loading the truck, cause you might not see it back in the 60s ever again. We have more states legalizing, we have Canada up and running in a week, NFL season about to begin, the Delta variant will not lead to lockdowns, consumers are flush with cash... Is Afghanistan your reason to sell PENN?! Really?!"
after buying score they say they are the biggest in north america
"Can we just let people make the right decisions for their family? If you want to get vaccinated or wear a mask fine, if not fine. I'm sure if no one went outside ever again some lives would be preserved but at what cost? This has been going on for like 18 months, time to move on and let people decide for themselves."
Serious question here. Is this a better investment than DKNG? Thanks for any educated answers.
back below $70 soon. yes sir!
Penn National Gaming is up 5.73% to 77.76
Finished red 12 of last 14 trading days. Hedge funds are unrelentingly tanking this
Lowest forward looking PE of any casino I just dont get it?????
"Milestone is exactly what it implied by its definitionIt’s not an Acquistion or megerLikely just a milestone of downloads, active customers or maybe monthly revenue Penn CEO was a bit hush on the conference call around how they were going to get stickiness of customersSaid he wasn’t going to chase customers just to jump over for a promotionBecause those people will move into the next promotionHe said something about waiting, sounded like some kind of announcement So maybe some milestone along with some other announcementMaybe another partnership or customer loyalty program etc But assuming the milestone will be interesting but not stock movingIn order for this to turn up to the 80s or 90s it’s going to take a good old fashion quarter crush followed by a big guidance raise"
The fact that this hasn’t started to trend up with the ER upcoming that had updated positive revenue forecasts is a very grim sign. Plus that huge block that just went up before opening tells me it will be a long hard road back to triple digits.
"Will be back to triple digits and beyond in no time, this stock will dominate the market and there is no comparison."
Bowl games have been dead since the era of college football playoffs with exception to the bowl games included in the first round of said playoffs. I bet none of you can name a single team that has played in The Arizona Bowl off the top of your head. This is so laughable.
"Vol quite light for such a move. So far, this pattern just short covering panic/confirmed a bearish head and shoulders today. Possible retest to 71 area on light vol would be constructive long."
It’s official we are above the 50 Day moving average.
I feel the need for &100
Where Janet ??
"Dipped my toes in, Numbers/futures look good.Double in a year???"
We might see 80 today. The Russell 2000 needs to touch 224.
"How can anyone argue that this stock isn't a absolute smash hold. If you don't see it doubling from here in the next 2 years you don't understand sports gambling and the demand for it. Also, do some research on how much money DK and FanDuel are spending on marketing.... it's UNREAL! Penn spends hardly anything on marketing, it's all driven by barstool. Simple finance folks"
Does this continue tomorrow or do we get a slapped with a big red day
What does this mean??? (Penn National Gaming Option Alert: Jan 21 $150 Calls Sweep (3) near the Ask: 474 @ $0.7 vs 2384 OI)
Sold my SCR shares at a 76% gain. Bought 100 shares of Penn. excited to add more and hold for years and reap the rewards
NFL pre games start next week. NFL season only a few weeks away. This is the sweet spot for PENN. $100.00 by end of September. $150.00 by Christmas.
"This has nothing to do with fundamentals, Hedge funds are positioning themselves to pay for the short squeeze in AMC, therefore they are abandoning their other short positions."
"Kids, this Big Gobbler keeps hitting its head on DOWNsloping 5O DMA in secular bear. No touch, mmkay. We will let pips know when it is safe. It is a no touch until then. Easy Basic charting 1O1."
the shorts are looking like toast on friday
Harrison bought the dip at $120 and kept buying all the way down. guess he had enough pain and left. rip
Wow! Is this a 20 dollar stock or a 110 dollar stock? Didn't it just have a positive earnings surprise?
Penn shares made a Golden Cross. I sold out of PFE to double my already profitable position on PENN and DKNG. Enjoy Football season and enjoy the membership growth of on line gambling.
Average price target is still $106. NFL season is upon us and they are opening a casino in PA.
I think the Fall schedule will be very kind to $PENN $DKNG $SCR $GENI . Holding PENN thru 200.
People who can't go to Vegas will use Penn to fulfill their gambling needs...
"Long time SCR holder, what a pleasant way to wake up this morning. Sold my shares in SCR and bought PENN. Excited to see this get back to $140."
"The company beat on earnings and revenue, it’s going in the right direction. Got to like the aggressiveness the take the digital gaming space"
ARE WE SQUEEZING?!!!!!! PENN & DKNG....BUY AND HOLD!
Dave trying to manipulate a stock price. sure that's going to go over real well w the SEC. don't be bagholding when the lawsuit drops.
"This stock is so cheap compared to Draftkings. 2x sales and PE of only 25 now after earnings. This is a double by Superbowl,$150.00 target"
This has to be the bottom for this. It’s down 50% from the ath 142.
Overblowing the covid spread again to cause panic selling and the big guys to then buy in at years lows and ride everything right back up … this is just one big game
the 80 shorts are hoping to get there by the end of the day the 75 have already waved the white flag
Best performer on the S&P today the beast has awoken.
"Let's not forget, this is a historically brick and mortar casino company in a transformative phase. Delta variant fears and low vaccine rates in hot spots have all gambling sector in the gutter. Over time, the disruption will occur. But for now, PENN gets lumped into the old school casino model. There is zero love right now for this sector. I'm am staying long, but my sights are set on the long term. Hang in there."
I’ve heard no one who is scared of covid this time around.. seems to just be propaganda. I’m vaccinated so I could care less. If your not vaccinated by this point you most likely are choosing to live your life as you please. So who’s hiding out scared of covid? This doesn’t just pertain to $Penn but market wide this is ridiculous. Fear mongering at its finest
$100+ in September.
ha Penn looks like it's a year ahead of DraftKings
Earnings reports and acquisition announcement exceeded even my wishful thinking. Glad that I averaged down as this was tanking instead of bailing. This should get back to triple digits by the next earnings call in early November.
Beautiful day today
"The word ""catastrophe"" doesn't quite cover this."
"good week, get ready next weeek"
2 hours and there will be alot of sorry shorts from 75 to 80 no chance
"I'm Back In on the AM Selloff..... I SOLD Last Week OVER $70....In Today 1,900 Shares @ $64.12..... Interested To See Where ThisSettles In The Next Few Days.."
When is the exact ex? record day for buying SCR.Thanks.
"To think PENN will drop any lower than it’s current levels is preposterous. Short interest continues to increase with NFL right around the corner….it’s about to be a bad time to be a BEAR in the gambling industry. When PENN pumps up 5-10%, you better believe it will be all over your children’s and friends friend social media. And if you don’t understand what I am talking about….you already lost. Leave in glory or go down on flames…TO THE MOON."
I backed the wrong horse. Should have bought DKNG
"And so the launch begins. Buy more now? Get in? The whole idea is buy low sell high, right?"
Nice pop
THE BOTTOM IS IN!! ADDING SHARES. NEXT STOP 110.
"I've been following penn closely for a few months, I think this could be a great entrance point. Q2 was a lot better than I thought it would be. I remember the PE on yahoo above 300, not its 24 with a lower forward PE as well. They do have a lot of debt but in line with industry. I see this as a hybrid between traditional casinos and online gambling. I think penn having barstool really sets them apart from the other companies in the industry. I am not a huge barstool fan, but they have a religious following and with icasino becoming a legal in more states, I think that could drive revenue more than expected. They had a solid cash flow statement as well. Penn has already lost like half its value from its highs, I do not see it going lower, with a low forward PE. I think they are in better financial position today then when they were above 100s. What are some thoughts?"
JUST A THOUGHT - position of $PENN $DKNG $SCR $GENI going into the fall is a winning strategy. Pullbacks will likely be shallow and few through year's end.
"Great company in both the fundamentals and technicals, a leader in a growing and very profitable sector of mobile sports betting … yet sp down 50% from just 5 months ago …"
"NO VOLUME AARON, SHOULD BE UP BIG TOMORROW."
Down 10% in one week and 34% in 6 months …. It’s down literally everyday now
breakout boys
A lot of people in these comments don't understand how arbitrage works lol
"question - anyone located near one of these properties to report on ""foot traffic?"" I consider these casinos to be more local traffic that tourist. Locals seem to be more consistent gamblers ... probably no airplane ride involved to visit the properties either. Should trade differently that other ""vegas"" style casinos."
the shorts are all in jeopardy today from 80 on down
I honestly can’t believe we are green today lol I’ll take it
to 100++?
"A lot of bag holders , thanks Dave!"
Where are all the people that were on here this morning bashing the stock.. looks like the market woke up and realizes the potential this deal has
Highly suggest PENN users buy into RSI before it gets bought out
Huge news as they are first movers to get Canada market share.. will be massive for their future prospects. This is big time
This half-off sale biscuit needs to clear 77 convincingly or else it is just a bearish head and shoulders. We suspect many got in at 120 and rode it ALL the way down and they should be very careful since this remains a SHORT for day traders. Massive resistance at 76.5 area.
im conservative in thinking how high my stock will grow but you you guys might be right about 100 real soon
"Barstool Sports is the official sponsor of the Arizona Bowl and will have broadcasting rights.....A power house in sports gambling/media has officially entered the world of college sports... ""We are getting into the live sports broadcast game. you know what this means, the Moon is a little bit closer!"" -El Presidente"
Lost nearly all gains from a phenomenal earnings day. Hedge funds own this stock. Slowly sinking it back to the low 60’s. Makes no sense but when the system is fixed they have the big money and can do what they want
"Trolls are out in full force this morning, why is that? None of these people own penn so they likely are worried about the news surrounding the stock as a positive and trying to persuade people from buying with their lousy opinions. Buy and hold, this isn’t a get rich overnight scheme but I can assure this company is going up"
just filed w the SEC. should be an open and shut case since Dave admits on camera buying millions of dollars of $SCR over the past month.
I also own $SCR $DKNG $GENI adding to all on dips. gl2a.
Portnoy on the investor call. Snowden coming on CNBC at 12 eastern today. Should be interesting to hear.
BARSTOOL and PENN will be huge in sponsoring college athletes. Adding more!
Down 50 dollars in the last 6 months and 10 dollars in the last 5 days. What is the faith that this thing will actually come back. Between this FEYE and SAVE it completely tanked my portfolio.
Raise your hand if you are a new bag holder.
dont knownwhat happened but we all know itll go right back down ina second
"The impression I get of this board for the mots part is one individual with multiple profiles having a conversation amongst themselves with the ultimate goal of scaring people out of their shares, probably getting paid $.01 per post LMAO!!!!!"
"I said it'd be heading to mid-60's but didn't think it'd be THIS quick! I have to correct myself based on this new information, probably heading to $60 eow. Yikes!"
The FED may ruin the momentum for the very short term on this and then we could see $85+
June 2022 @ 100 were under $5 a month ago
Just getting smoked
"In two months, if price stays at current level, it will at or below 0% return for 1 year. Absolutely terrible."
RSI is at 27. way oversold
Boy i can’t wait till  Football
"Everyone relax, all gambling stocks down."
Buy Target at $58 
5 weeks ago I predicted that PENN would purchase either GAN or SCR.Today they announced the purchase of SCR.
Breakout buy point.. finally broke through 75
Stock well positioned for a legendary run that will exceed last year. Canada sports gambling opens up this week and Penn one of the major players. Not to mention Penn expansion into new states. Target $150 by January.
The corner was turned at 63 and a bottom was found.. now we rise
hope all is well in the gulf they have quite a few properties there ..
Joining from thescore family
"Bottom is in. Do not be greedy, tough to get ultimate bottom, but this feels close. NFL seasons starts in a few weeks, training camps, big bets going to start in weeks."
"A transfer of wealth. Buy millions of dollars of $SCR, get your parent company to buy them out, cash out of $SCR when it goes up 75%. Good way to clean money for Dave, just wonder if the SEC agrees."
Is Janet period over?? Hope today feels better 
Patience is the name of this game!
"""It's time for my to fllyyyy"". Can't keep a great stock up 1XX% EPS Y/Y down too long."
This stock will run when the NFL seasons starts.
Buy more… sweet sweet PENN
PENN buying the rest of barstool ???
Buy the dips. Thank me after football season when there are AT LEAST 10 Barstool Sportsbook locations.
Slowly backing out of the 80s going into the holiday weekend
great day!
so why was this down last week?
This stock is a steal heading into the NFL season. If you don’t see that you have no clue about how incredibly big sports betting will become in the next 10 years
"Before the COVID-19 pandemic, Penn National purchased a 36% stake in Barstool Sports. Then, the virus hit, and stocks crashed. Penn's stock went from around $38 a share to nearly $8 a share.Today, the stock's trading around $70 a share, good for a 782% gain since last March."
I made nice $ on this last year. Bailed with a very nice profit. Good luck. Hold hold hold but when you see it happening (if it does) sell and jump back in
Janet ran out of Her ALWAYS
What's going on with the nosedive at the end of the day?
stock makes me want to k myself
"I don’t know what I would do without the help of (http://Thetraderguide.com). Their watchlists are so well researched and help me make the best possible picks when it comes to investing. Not only do they save me time, but their advice has shown to be tried and true!"
"I wonder what the news is, can’t wait to find out"
"I just heard about the acquisition this morning, saw the stock was down 2% to start the day and loaded up on shares... feel like I just got away with theft"
great buy going to 100 buy oct.
Barstool Sportsbook opening in New Jersey next week
i didn't know PENN could hoo green anymore? figured it was part of getting added to the SP
All stay long this stock is bound to Make a Tom Brady comeback.
I finally got out at $83. Enough profit already. I will get back in if it drops. At this point it is just difficult to judge which way it will go.
This stock is very strong despite everything and I am sure that we'll see 100$ in August . I love it. And Dave knows something .
"People need to start seeing the big picture here.. news just out “Barstool Sports and MLB have engaged in ""significant negotiations about having national midweek games on the site’s platforms.” Penn live betting as barstool televises games."
"Penn National Gaming PENN set to open Hollywood Casino York, PA August 12, 2021. Brick and mortar - something DKNG doesn't have. Sub-70 buying opportunity of a lifetime right here people."
when football starts this stock is a great buy at this low number.
"Where you at Janet? We know you are lurking, how did Dave hurt you today#$%$"
I don't think it'll sink to $65 tomorrow. $66 more likely.
PENN to $85 by EOW. Official news article hasn't even came out.....You are here first. And its over sold.........TO THE MOON BABY!
Here come the upgrades. $1.17 in a seasonally weak quarter!! They could be at $6 eps this time next year. Stock will be at 120!
This will be $140 soon

I don't see any reason to own this debt machine. Next support is $43.
$80 by EOW?
120 by the end of the superbowl in 2022..HOLD.
Portnoy just announced the barstool Sportsbook coming to Colorado and Virginia next week
All of the orders routed to the dark pools are finally being shown on the lit exchanges. T plus 35.
I’m loving this run
Earnings are going to be a game changer.
I’m 30k in on DKNG but dang this stock looks appealing. Found the floor and going to explode! Should I diversify and get in? Portnoy is awesome too
SCR holders waiting for acquisition thumbs up here and post your position.Excited to join PENN soon.900@33.65
Janet is back on the first red day in a week.. total coward
NFL season in 6 weeks
What happened to PENN price? It fell as usual
Now down 53% from the 142 ath. Nice
"Frack…hitting 6 month low, 1/2 of the high (142). That’s got to be a buy signal, right?"
Bought in yesterday and already strongly regretting it.
Told y’all over a week ago that 60’s were incoming and I was laughed at.
Why is this getting killed ?
$64 lol
i hope all this pain is worth in next year
Making Portnoy the face of this company was a mistake
"The only national name recognition is Fanduel and Draftkings. They HAVE to spend some money at some point on national ads and marketing. All I saw on every homerun Monday night were Draftking ads. $142 was way overdone, but all us longs feel like Barstool could be doing much more than just cookie reviews, bachelorette recaps, and crying about the Yankees. Let's go Snowden!!!"
300 shares premarket up over 2 grand in less than 3 hours
Need a +$5 day soon or will tread for a while.
I couldn’t be happier with the daily emails I get from (http://Thetraderguide.com). They give me the best daily advice based on stock market news and help me make wiser decisions when it comes to investing. An absolute must for any investor!
Sell while you can! This chart is setting up for a big fall!
"just fixed the algo , sorry guys"
$150 within a yr
North Carolina close to allowing sports betting https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article253547474.html
"Just set a price alert for when this breaks 85, which it will in conjunction with AMC SQUEEZE. I Wonder if it goes to 200 during the Amc SQUEEZE. Hmmm. I can't wait to find out."
same move yesterday
It'll lose $10/share in the next week. Those who dumped toward the end of today know it too. Check out the volume and price drop end of day.
"Volume is good today, expecting another run up of 3-4%, followed by red candles tomorrow"
All long just hold strong football is less than a month away. These hedge funds are shorting this stock to force the weak hands out.
"What a beating this has taken now since begininng of the year. Down 53% from its high and still in decline.Unfortaunetl;ly, going to have to sell part of my position and believe its best done before earnings this quarter."
the only stock in the red on my whole board lmaoto the moon indeed
Barstool sports book is officially live in State on NJ !! Let’s goo 
Down over 11% since a phenomenal earnings a week and half ago in a close to all time high’s market. Explain that one! Lol
Love these prices can’t wait to buy more
"The shorts and MMs continue to beat this down. When they finally decide to take it the other way, it will rain a sunny day. Until then clinch and buckle up. Good entry point here for a LONG position."
I wonder how much naked shorting is happening in this stock 
Did this stock have a 2:1 split or??
i wouldnt want to be a short today the only one with a miniscule shot are the ones at 80 and miniscule is not where i would want to be
"Up almost 3 dollars per share 20 minutes in, then all buy orders get routed to dark pools. I wonder if they are also spoofing?"
"The technical setup is great as we have a triple bottom formed in the 65-66 area, the stock is oversold, NFL season and further legalization is coming, the Covid curve is about to bend... get long or cover if you are short, cause the bounce is coming."
WAS I RIGHT OR WAS I RIGHT? 1 day ago I said that Once AMC takes off so will PENN AND VIAC.
Nice chart if you had a go-cart with no engine hahahahahahahah
Going to the moon!!! Well positioned to dominate an exploding industry folks
Told you. Read my post from yesterday.
I have made lots of profit already here. I am getting tempted to cash out the profits. Any opinion?
Big day for RSI up 6% after hours yesterday
Reversal in process. This will be 100 by october.
SCR GANG checkin in! LFG! been holding SCR for 3 years now
ive never seen a stock be red every single day for 7 months
Any idea what the odd volume increase at end of day was from? A rare above average volume day and looks like most of it came in last hour
remember people love to gamble this stock is a great buy at this price 100 plus by fall.
"Uptrend may be upon us, lower highs, and higher highs for 5 plus days could mean the lows are behind us. I remember last summer we started gaining momentum before NFL"
https://twitter.com/stoolpresidente/status/1419720829588357122?s=20I smell a $PENN buyout ;)))))
I bought in yesterday for the first time. NFL will kick off soon as well as college football. Then NHL. If she dips I'll get more.
Triple bottom at 64 for what it’s worth.. gambling sector is full of bargains. Covid will peak sooner than later and patience will be rewarded
Lots of blood flowing in the Casino sector. Time to start nibbling.
and almost red in pre. citadel still short. worst market ever
Look at all these positive comments. Red red red
I am really annoyed one step forward and 10 backwards just want to exit without a loss its been 40 days
Draft king's user growth falls short of expectations
Spend 2 billion and people think thats good for short term equity price....smh....you have to make that 2 billion back then start from there. These decisions are for long term sustainability and survival not short term bull runs. But thats a logical financial take so im sure nobody agrees...yolooooo to the mooon hahaha what a time to be alive.
"$PENN also has one of the best relationships with it's customers in my opinion. If you live in a state where the barstool sportsbook is allowed, you know exactly what I'm talking about, the user experience is unmatched."
"Have a great weekend , Partners"
"Down 1.5% on no volume.. ok, no doubt that a hedge is holding this down.. their time will come with NFL getting closer"
This will run to 200 with the AMC short squeeze. I feel the same hedge funds in Amc are in this stock. They are the ones that pushed it to 150 then dropped it to 64. And Now they know the jig is up. No more naked shorting to over manipulate the hell out of stocks.
power hour on reverse
Let’s squeeze this
"PENN has a bright future, i’m on board. Sold my SCR and locked in huge profits to buy PENN"
Def seems like news comingReally large volume spikeSomeone knows something All other casino stocks still down
Janet?
Goldman maintains Buy for Penn. Updates PT to $124 from $149. I'll take that all dayhttps://www.benzinga.com/quote/PENN
Prez said big announcement in 2 weeks 
Everyone bashing the Arizona bowl with barstool…do an ounce of research on barstool and you’ll find out that their rabid fan base will be at that bowl….not only that but everyone will want to watch it…college students love barstool as well so that will be the bowl everyone wants to play in
Nothing new here to reportA rigged game by the big boys/ as the market is and always will bePenn will keep going down until the suits get every penny they canGambling at tables much more fun than this blood bath
Opened the position today 
So much for that spectacular ending to the trading week you all have been calling for all week. Monday will be even worse for it. Heading to mid 60's soon.
"I don't see any reason to buy this. Yes, 43 be ok to take chance. Still risk to 14."
"This stock is falling like how Afghanistan fell to the Taliban. At this rate, it'll be $40 in a month."
"Once the over exaggerated COVID fear subsides again, this will run"
bought at the dip this morning at 64. 59 what a difference an hour makes
Possibly a buyout target from a deep pocket casino operator for the geographic diversity and growing online sports betting? ...just a theory...
Milestone announcement this could hit $90 tomorrow!!
PENN & DKNG BUY & HOLD
Is it me or this is getting really undervalued?
czr had blow out earnings I think penn will do the same I go to one of their casinos always nice crowd. stay long my friend
Back to 100s really soon. #footballseasonbaby
By barstool acquiring the naming rights they are setting themselves up to provide in stadium betting.. if they control everything from naming rights to tv in a legal state then it’s a no brainer.. realize why this is important to the bigger picture
Ever since they got bumped up into the S&P it’s been a bloodbath. Long term should be fine but my goodness lol
Any good portfolio manager knows to have a full position of $PENN $DKNG $SCR $GENI going into the fall. Pullbacks will likely be shallow and few through year's end.
"How can this stock continue to perform so badly after great earnings? The outlook is excellent with the upcoming NFL season, new states opening sports books, casinos opened and humming along. This is why average investors HATE the markets"
Ripping!!
those who bought at 63 is so good
Mighty quiet today I guess the circus has left town lmao
"Let's do an exercise on PENN's cash situation.At the end of the 1st qtr. they had $2.062 billion in cash during the second qtr they sucessfully added another $300 million giving them $2.362 billion. They just announced that they are selling $400 million more giving them cash of $2,762 billion.Unlike many of the other gaming companies the are not losing money and and burning cash. They as any operating company need cash for operations. As the end of 2019 they had $437 million in cash. As a conservative estimate let's say the need $462 million. That gives them $2.3 billion in excess.My question is why. Are they planning an acquisition? They have stated their goal is to be a low cost igaming / sports betting operator.Would they aquire a platform such as GAN or be interested in buying SCR and entering into Canada (they already own 5%)."
I would like to thank Keith Gill for this pic. I did bail @130 but looking back this is the play that made me. GLTA I’m still holding GME AMC SNDL and recently with the CLOV. Meme stock multimillionaire here and why everyone want me to sell my AMC/GME?
I have a feeling this won't move much until SCR deal is finalized.
This has to be the worst stock in the history of stocks. Absolutely nothing but down since March when everything else rebounded since.
The bottom is in. Added shares. Double down. gl2a.
shorts big mad rn
"When Amc squeeze hits, this stock will breakout."
lets gooo
SOLD On the POP.Taking a Few Thousand George Washington's To the Bank !
Can you believe thisTotally sad for those who bought at the top or any day since middle of March Makes me sick the games these guys play with stock manipulation to drive price down on no news
"some nice price action today. Buyers still here, hedgies not the only ones that can move the price."
reversal ...yikes
Monday tankathon coming
I bought 500 this morning to add to my score win win
Will finish 9.96% up EOD.
"I hate to say it, but this will go into the 40s. Entire sector taking a beating. Sports betting not becoming legal in more states fast enough. The states that didn’t vote for it will have to wait for there next legislative sessions which is a year out. The states that have approved it are dragging their feet. NY wants a kings ransom to do it in their state. Penn said they would be in a new state every month thru the end of year and aside from Indians, they have not moved in to other states. This was a pump and dump."
listening to Frank .... fly me to the 
This could push high 50’s by end of month. Same pattern forming as the last three months. Massive resistance builds each time price is pushed down big time. Happening here as well.
This stock will likely be over $200 this time next year if we keep getting ER’s like this one!
Just another rigged market
PENN heading to the $1nn range longs!!!!!
"$101 estimate…with football ramping up, it’s gonna happen quickly!"
Crushed the quarterRevenues approx up to 200 m higher and earnings will be well above 1.00 a shareSorts will cover quicklyUpgraded tomorrow Could we see the 90s early next week ?
"TO THE MOON! Football coming too, LFG!"
"Any dreams of this thing “taking off” are dead. It will be a long slow crawl back to triple digits. Maybe early next year but definitely not sooner, and that’s a stretch. You are high as hell to think otherwise and obviously don’t understand how legislative sessions work in regards to more states approving sports betting. Like I’ve said previously, the states that were on the fence this year did not pass any legislation and it has been curbed until the next session. Even then there is no guarantee. Keep screaming “to the moon!” Lol"
"$DKNG, $PENN Flying right now!!!!"
$PENN $MRNA $RBLX $WISH
"Mark my words this the low of PENN, tomorrow is a big day. Earnings and first NFL pre-season game."
Sold my 250 shares of SCR and bought 115 shares of PENN. This is better than the offer if PENN moves up because there is a fixed cash price plus 0.238? shares of PENN. Buying PENN now gets you the full share price increase instead of just 0.238.
Congrats all great move on the score monster move !!!
Do I hear $60! $60 on the board?
I am glad there is support around $72. That should keep shorts away.
"oh yeah triple bottom, inverse head and shoulders NEEDS to hold today and reverse course asap"
Draftkings is a much better play. You realize barstool followers are broke college kids right? You won’t build a gambling company from eating golden brown chocolate chip cookies and dominos
Aaron where you at? What are your charts saying now? Sad man
"Hello, I'm new to Penn. I bought 1000 shares today. Just curious as to if anyone is worried about the almost 12 billion in debt it shows? Please serious responses only. Thanks"
Huge Milestone: a huge stone set up beside a road to mark the distance in miles to a particular place.
"PENN and the rest of this sector has not shaken the old image of just catering to gamblers. These are becoming OMNI-channel technology companies. Every state in the next 5-8 years will be open for online betting. PENN has positioned itself nicely with brick and mortar, online, and now direct to client access via Barstool. It's been a gut punch to all longs going from 142 to 68 but we have to think long term. I expect Q2 results to be really solid. I keep adding here below 70. Good luck."
Come on Port e stop doing cookie reviews and get in the game.
"Football pre-season, yes, preseason, will be the catalyst to take us to $100.00 by September"
The best way to win in gambling stocks that have on line as a driver is buy Both Penn and DKNG Hold until 3 weeks after Super Bowl then decide what you want to do.
Portnoy gonna get fat eating pizza when this hit 40
Has a huge barstool fan…advice to you guys…get to truly know el Prez…and you’ll never doubt your investment with this company
I've averaged up 3 times now. MP is estimated to own 15% of rare earths. It's like $DKNG or $MTTR or $UPST or $PENN or $ETHE or $TCNNF ...Buy the dips and be patient.
see you in the 90s by the end of month.
"A red finish for the 4th day in a row after a phenomenal earnings report ? Makes no logical sense, other than the fact that the shorts do what they want"
"Unfortunately following earnings, this will fall to $59 and change before any move higher"
"If you’re a day trader, you should definitely check out (http://Pick-stocks.com). They send a watchlist covering the top pre-market movers every day before the open. It’s a great way to pick out potential trades for the day."
PENN launch heading for $1nn
"Once people learn how great THE SCORE is for Penn, this stock will moon "
"I hold draftkings but no penn. been buying regularly for a year now and avg cost is just over 48. For all you bag holders in penn land, you’re not alone. Fast forward a decade and online sports betting will have exceeded most any projections in my opinion.GLTA"
