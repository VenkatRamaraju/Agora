"￼UPDATEApril 23, 2020Our CACC Short Is Playing Out as Planned... Plus, Tanker Stocks Rally!Our short position in Credit Acceptance Corp (CACC) is playing out well for us.In a recent SEC filing, the company said that many consumers are delaying payments on car loans, which has led to a “significant decrease” in the payments they’ve been able to collect.The filing also said that management has had to devote significant time to assessing the impact of the coronavirus on the company’s operations and financial position.As a result, CACC is delaying reporting quarterly results. The news made the stock tumble 13%.Other auto lenders are also taking it on the chin. Santander Consumer USA (SC), for example, has seen a “significant decline” in new auto loans.It also expects the coronavirus outbreak to have a “materially more significant impact” on the performance of its outstanding loans than “even the most severe historical natural disaster.”Ally Financial (ALLY) said that 25% of its customers are deferring their auto loan payments. Even more startling, 76% of those customers have never asked for a deferral before, and 70% have never been late on a car payment.In other words, even people with good credit can’t make their payments. So the situation will be even worse for CACC, since it caters to folks with terrible credit scores.Look, we don’t take any pleasure in watching people struggle through an impossible situation. It’s rough out there. But it’s our job to help you protect and grow your wealth no matter what’s going on in the world, and that’s what we’re aiming to do here.No surprise, ratings agency Fitch has changed its outlook for the US auto finance industry from stable to negative. It said that rising unemployment could ultimately result in “large operating losses” for the industry.Meanwhile, CACC’s founder Donald Foss is still unloading shares. He’s sold approximately $9.6 million worth of CACC stock in the last two weeks alone.At the same time, short interest in CACC surged to 12.7% as of the end of March. That means an increasing number of investors are betting against the stock.￼CACC has tanked 38% in the last two months. But it is still overvalued. It’s currently trading at price-to-book of 2.2, while its peer group trades at an average price-to-book of 0.5.In short, our bear thesis here is still intact, and we are sticking with our CACC short."
I’m guessing many of the buyers are day traders and short covering. REMEMBER if you are short and covering even if you have made a profit Always remember to ask yourself if this is a good buy. Would I be buying this if I was not covering. The inevitable answer in no. Im covering under 100.
"Patient put holder :-(, waiting for July 17 puts, already red :-("
This is not a day trade. Earnings in April will not tell the story. October earnings will be a better gauge of CACC issues. I continue to add to my position. Good luck and be patient
"Credit Acceptance Corporation (Nasdaq: CACC) (referred to as the “Company”, “Credit Acceptance”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) today announced a consolidated net loss of $83.8 million, or $4.61 per diluted share, for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to consolidated net income of $164.4 million, or $8.65 per diluted share, for the same period in 2019."
Just to give you an idea of what this company has done to people. Read some of these horror stories. Including the very recent ones. Total lack of humanity.https://www.consumeraffairs.com/finance/credit_acceptance_corp.html?#sort=recent&filter=none
"I have a short postition, and I completely agree with all the postings. But, I also have some mixed feelings about the price of the stock. Why it is not going down ????All those things mentioned are also known by other people, and the price of the stock is still above $ 300.-. Maybe current stockholders think that this company will survive, with less competitors. You get more poor people, who will also look for services of this loan shark. Just my doubts for this moment."
"Now, in the latest indication that banks are bracing for even more default pain, this time stemming from what even before the coronavirus crisis was the next subprime disaster-in-waiting, namely auto loans. According to CNBC, Wells Fargo is hitting the brakes on its auto loan business, until recently a major source of revenue for the company.The bank, one of the biggest lenders for new and used car purchases in the U.S., sent letters to hundreds of independent auto dealerships last month telling them that the San Francisco-based company was dropping them as a customer, according to people with knowledge of the situation.Wells Fargo confirmed that the bank, which only makes auto loans through car dealerships, will no longer accept loan applications from most independent shops which typically sell used cars, unlike franchise dealerships that focus on new vehicles from specific manufacturers."
"￼ALERTApril 07, 2020Short More CACCHere’s a silver lining to all the mayhem...Back in February, we recommended shorting Credit Acceptance Corporation (CACC) and we are already up 36%. The outlook for the company has gotten even worse, and we think the stock will fall further from here.CACC loans money to people with low credit scores to buy used cars. As you can imagine, very few people on the low credit spectrum are borrowing money to buy a car right now. The economy is on tilt, unemployment is skyrocketing, and a lot of folks are more worried about paying for groceries than buying a secondhand car—and rightly so.The CEO of CarMax, a used car retailer, said same-store sales plummeted at least 50% in the last two weeks of March at most locations.In addition, with people losing their jobs, defaults on the loans CACC has already made will make a big jump. And the company will probably end up pursuing repossession, since the cars are the collateral for these loans.The problem is the value of that collateral is tanking as I write, because nobody is in the market for a car. So CACC will have to mark down the value of their assets significantly. Earnings over the next few quarters are going to be ugly.CACC has seen a lot of insider selling lately too. The company’s founder, Donald Foss, has sold 30,666 shares within the last two weeks alone. The total value of those shares was $8.4 million.CACC’s valuation is still too high as well, even after shares dropped 36% over the last month. It’s currently trading at 1.8 times book value.This stock should not be trading at a premium to book because the company is probably sitting on a bunch of assets that will become impaired. A book value of 0.75 is a more fitting valuation.At 0.75 times book, CACC would be about a $100 stock. That’s about 60% below the current share price—and even that price target may end up being generous.Recommendation: Increase your allocation to a short position in Credit Acceptance Corp. (CACC) from 2% to 4% at the market."

April data from subprime asset-backed securities showed delinquency levels across card, auto, and other loans were flat, she said. “Fiscal policy is really keeping the subprime borrower afloat.”Markets have responded — the gap between yields on subprime-backed securities and US Treasuries has dropped sharply, while new deals have met high demand.In auto loans — the largest and most liquid part of the subprime ABS market — $3bn in securities have been issued since the start of May, roughly equivalent to the same period last year, Ms Thomas noted. Investors have more than covered these issues with orders.The spread between the yields on triple A-rated subprime auto ABS has fallen to 1.2 percentage points above Treasuries, according to data from Bank of America, compared with a peak of 4.25 in March. At the beginning of the year, spreads were below 0.5 percentage points.Line chart of Spread over Treasures, per cent, by credit rating showing Subprime auto loan ABS“We are seeing surprisingly good performance and restraint from our borrowers,” said Don Berman, chief executive of CardWorks, a subprime card lender. “In previous recessions, we saw an immediate drawdown of people’s credit and frankly we were expecting it this time.” Instead, borrowers’ balances are falling, he said.“Since 2010 we have seen our consumer be far more responsible in terms of use of their credit limit — the awareness of the importance of a good credit score has risen,” he added. He also noted that support programmes from the US government, in the form of payment forbearance and other measures, have “made all the difference”.Don Gayhardt, chief executive of Curo, which makes unsecured personal loans to subprime borrowers, painted a similar picture. “Our overall loan volume fell in April and again in May — more people are paying off loans rather than re-borrowing,” he said.Curo’s net lending volumes are down by half since the crisis hit, which Mr Gayhardt attributes to tightening of the company’s credit standards and “customers paying off loans at a higher than normal clip”.Questions remain, however, about what happens when state-backed stimulus programmes expire. Ms Thomas of Loomis Sayles noted that, while delinquencies remained low, between 5 and 15 per cent of the loans in subprime ABS had been extended, which was roughly double normal levels.“The big issue is where credit performance is going,” said Theresa O’Neill, ABS strategist at Bank of America. Higher levels of loan extensions were typically followed by higher delinquencies, she said, “but these are unusual times [and] much remains to be seen”.Shares in Curo, while still below their pre-coronavirus levels, have more than doubled from April lows. Subprime auto lenders Santander Consumer and Credit Acceptance have had similar rebounds, with Credit Acceptance surpassing its February highs.Mr Berman of CardWorks expects his customers will remain careful. “A subprime borrower lives their entire financial existence in recession,” he said. “They don’t have the bandwidth a prime or super-prime customer has. So they tend to be resilient in times like this, and they will be a good leading indicator of the economy as we come out of this.”"
"I've been short for months and closing out half my position today. Sometimes you have to give in and take emotion out of it. Even though I think this is a terrible company, the earnings of other companies who primarily serve lower income customers (ORLY for example) have been fantastic due to the extra stimulus and unemployment checks. A large number of people on unemployment were making more than they were before and the checks are consistent and stable."
"I cannot find a better company to short after a short squeeze that was just experienced. I suspect all the big money will be hopping back in short at this level.""Debt is not covered by cash flow."" Now why would Simply Wall Street (SWS) in its analysis bother to state that ? It's credit rating (as I recall) is in the B category which is not with friendly rates. So it had better have good cash flow to cover debt in my opinion. ""Significant insider selling over the last three months."" (Link) And how 'bout the bucks it will be paying to defend itself from numerous law suits ? If indeed there are serious shenanigans being done by the company expect the law suits to be successful; how is that going to smack it financially ? I don't know the company survives if new governance were to take over. It gets ""passes"" a for a list of criteria stated by SWS, but I am doubtful it is going into the next few quarters expecting the market is on its way up. The next federal stimulus package may be a shadow of the first one with respect to money's to the unemployed considering the way the legislative wrangling is going on. I watch the politics closely, and I think it is a mistake believing the remaining two quarters of this year is going to be nearly as supportive, and I figure that will make a big dent in car payments made.Don't put this on me if you get in again short like I am considering, and it does not work out. I am expecting time to have to pass with me being patient. But it is worth it to me. If you do, be aware of the wash sale rule that requires 30 days from your loss to be able to use your loss for tax purpose. (More to this, and I urge you to study up and be understanding of the IRS wash sale verbiage.)I think for some of you it was the thing to do to gut it out as some have. My hat is off to you even if you got out with a loss. I did, but in updating and re-assessing, my mind is that I don't want history to flush me out of what may be a good come back. If you pace yourself back in, you may do some recovering. How 'bout a net gain"
This stock will easily reach $700 by the end of this year.
Is fed buying all the ABS securities?- I am still struggling to understand that retail investors are piling on this.
Shares not available for short at Vanguard. If you can get 'em this will be the short trade of a lifetime.
Will the lawsuits for hiding the risky car loans push CACC to bankruptcy or will the market penalize it for booming losses and then CACC will file bankruptcy?

"It doesn smell goodTiming of Filing of Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Proxy Statement for Annual MeetingCredit Acceptance Corporation (referred to as the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) is relying on the order issued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on March 25, 2020 in SEC Release No. 34-88465 pursuant to the SEC’s authority under Section 36 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) granting exemptions from certain provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules thereunder related to the reporting requirements for certain public companies, subject to certain conditions (such order, the “Order”), to delay the filing of (i) its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2020 (the “Quarterly Report”) and (ii) the definitive proxy statement for its 2020 annual meeting of shareholders (the “Proxy Statement”), including information required by Part III of Form 10-K that is to be incorporated by reference into the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 (the “10-K Part III Information”).

Since early March, we have been following the recommendations of state and local health authorities to minimize the exposure risk for our team members, including restricting access to our physical offices. Our management has had to devote significant time and attention to assessing the potential impact of COVID-19 and related events on our operations and financial position and developing operational and financial plans to address those matters, which has diverted management resources from completing tasks necessary to file the Quarterly Report by the original due date of the Quarterly Report and to file the Proxy Statement with the 10-K Part III Information by the original due date of the 10-K Part III Information."
"Need info from this group- I am still puzzled by who is buying this. Doesnt look like short covering- Do they know some thing, which as an average investor, I am missing some thing?"
