P/E tells the story with this stock....way undervalued
"This stock smells fishy. I’ve been watching it for a while now. It goes up with no share traded. Today is up almost 20.00 with less than 40,000 shares traded. And it only goes up when trading is not happening."

"Credit Acceptance Corporation (Nasdaq: CACC) (referred to as the “Company”, “Credit Acceptance”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) today announced a consolidated net loss of $83.8 million, or $4.61 per diluted share, for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to consolidated net income of $164.4 million, or $8.65 per diluted share, for the same period in 2019."
"￼UPDATEApril 23, 2020Our CACC Short Is Playing Out as Planned... Plus, Tanker Stocks Rally!Our short position in Credit Acceptance Corp (CACC) is playing out well for us.In a recent SEC filing, the company said that many consumers are delaying payments on car loans, which has led to a “significant decrease” in the payments they’ve been able to collect.The filing also said that management has had to devote significant time to assessing the impact of the coronavirus on the company’s operations and financial position.As a result, CACC is delaying reporting quarterly results. The news made the stock tumble 13%.Other auto lenders are also taking it on the chin. Santander Consumer USA (SC), for example, has seen a “significant decline” in new auto loans.It also expects the coronavirus outbreak to have a “materially more significant impact” on the performance of its outstanding loans than “even the most severe historical natural disaster.”Ally Financial (ALLY) said that 25% of its customers are deferring their auto loan payments. Even more startling, 76% of those customers have never asked for a deferral before, and 70% have never been late on a car payment.In other words, even people with good credit can’t make their payments. So the situation will be even worse for CACC, since it caters to folks with terrible credit scores.Look, we don’t take any pleasure in watching people struggle through an impossible situation. It’s rough out there. But it’s our job to help you protect and grow your wealth no matter what’s going on in the world, and that’s what we’re aiming to do here.No surprise, ratings agency Fitch has changed its outlook for the US auto finance industry from stable to negative. It said that rising unemployment could ultimately result in “large operating losses” for the industry.Meanwhile, CACC’s founder Donald Foss is still unloading shares. He’s sold approximately $9.6 million worth of CACC stock in the last two weeks alone.At the same time, short interest in CACC surged to 12.7% as of the end of March. That means an increasing number of investors are betting against the stock.￼CACC has tanked 38% in the last two months. But it is still overvalued. It’s currently trading at price-to-book of 2.2, while its peer group trades at an average price-to-book of 0.5.In short, our bear thesis here is still intact, and we are sticking with our CACC short."
did the earnings come out?
"1/3 of CACC revenue is on repossess the car from the borrowers that are in default and sell in the used car actions. Now all the actions are full of Hertz and other rental cars used cars. And nobody is buying right now. Plus all the unemployed persons will not pay CACC loans, so another 1/3 revenue gone. When the company publish this info, stock will collapse to 100$ share."

"Now, in the latest indication that banks are bracing for even more default pain, this time stemming from what even before the coronavirus crisis was the next subprime disaster-in-waiting, namely auto loans. According to CNBC, Wells Fargo is hitting the brakes on its auto loan business, until recently a major source of revenue for the company.The bank, one of the biggest lenders for new and used car purchases in the U.S., sent letters to hundreds of independent auto dealerships last month telling them that the San Francisco-based company was dropping them as a customer, according to people with knowledge of the situation.Wells Fargo confirmed that the bank, which only makes auto loans through car dealerships, will no longer accept loan applications from most independent shops which typically sell used cars, unlike franchise dealerships that focus on new vehicles from specific manufacturers."
I just can’t believe this stock has held up this well. Where are the buyers coming from?Comments please.
CACC stock chart looks eerily similar to Countrywide stock chart in 2007

does this mean anything for CACC?Wave Of Repos Imminent As Subprime Auto-Buyers Miss Payments
Thursday after closing results Q2. I wander how the results will be. The stock went higher and higher from April. I just do not understand. Maybe next Thursday I have the answer. I am almost sure that I overlook something.

"Volume is still low, but some investors seems to be desperate to buy CACC. I just don`t know for what reason...."
"Patient put holder :-(, waiting for July 17 puts, already red :-("
Yikes does anyone have any comments here.
I’m guessing many of the buyers are day traders and short covering. REMEMBER if you are short and covering even if you have made a profit Always remember to ask yourself if this is a good buy. Would I be buying this if I was not covering. The inevitable answer in no. Im covering under 100.
LouieYour post was a little confusing! Revenue up in first quarter and repo up with falling auction prices! I don’t think the bad news will show till second quarter. However if the fed bails them out all bets on my end are off. What you take
Credit Acceptance is up 6.74% to 400.00

"It doesn smell goodTiming of Filing of Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Proxy Statement for Annual MeetingCredit Acceptance Corporation (referred to as the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) is relying on the order issued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on March 25, 2020 in SEC Release No. 34-88465 pursuant to the SEC’s authority under Section 36 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) granting exemptions from certain provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules thereunder related to the reporting requirements for certain public companies, subject to certain conditions (such order, the “Order”), to delay the filing of (i) its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2020 (the “Quarterly Report”) and (ii) the definitive proxy statement for its 2020 annual meeting of shareholders (the “Proxy Statement”), including information required by Part III of Form 10-K that is to be incorporated by reference into the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 (the “10-K Part III Information”).

Since early March, we have been following the recommendations of state and local health authorities to minimize the exposure risk for our team members, including restricting access to our physical offices. Our management has had to devote significant time and attention to assessing the potential impact of COVID-19 and related events on our operations and financial position and developing operational and financial plans to address those matters, which has diverted management resources from completing tasks necessary to file the Quarterly Report by the original due date of the Quarterly Report and to file the Proxy Statement with the 10-K Part III Information by the original due date of the 10-K Part III Information."
"Ven, We don’t publically announce when we will complete our SEC filings (other than our 8K’s associated with our earnings releases). -Credit Acceptance"
The biggest fund that owns CACC and top insiders have been selling shares of the company in March and April - how is it possible that CACC delayed its earnings release allowing insiders to sell the shares! There are lockdown periods to prevent this kind of insider trading. Don't know why the stock is still 300+ but bottom is about to fall out. This is a relatively unknown name with retail investors that may explain why the stock hasn't already crashed.
Credit Acceptance is up 5.08% to 341.71
"Dear CACC, are you planning to release your Q1’20 earnings eventually ? Your filing extension is coming up soon and the losses are brewing. Your insiders are selling the stock. Did you really screwup that much???"
4.5 billion in long term debt. On sub prime loans.

"CACC Dividend Reinvestment of 40,000 shares at $255 - $270 per share by Beneficial Owner Foss Donald A on 02/08"
Not good for CACC!! No more sub-prime auto lending! Losses are mounting. They don’t have reserves to cope with those losses. End of charging 25+% APRs. Watch the free fall!
"doing the past 10 mvinutes, CACC has filed S 4 for insider selling from 4 exec officers and one board member .For 4 of them, the sales were material to their holdingssmart insiders?"
The fact this boiler room is approaching a $7B market cap is the poster for a bubble in the market. A lot of subprime loans out there where the car value is worth far less than loan value (@ 20% interest rates). What is CACC going to do with all these cars? They will be the biggest used car lot in the world!
"Just a general question. To what you are looking for in the results ? What will be the trigger to go down, or more up ? In fact I expect that the stimulus as Cristian mentioned will keep the results ¨reasonable¨. When the number of new contracts really declined that could be a game changer. Liquidity issues could arise. The company has to give more or additional collateral for funding the activities. We will know after close."
Credit Acceptance is down 5.05% to 401.00
Be aware that most finance company's have not repossessed any collateral in over a year because of the pandemic. Thats part of the reason why there is a shortage of cars in the market.
"Its not going down considerably, slow bleed?, I am surprised. Any stock with such negative outlook would have tanked"
"I am a retired CPA who audited banks for a livingCACC press release and 10Q are quite complex and filled with obfuscation,IMODel loans have increased despite $280 million of loans charged off...and that is only a few weeks into lockdownPress release says yield on loans will drop 400bps in q 2, which means almost 20% drop in revenueGuessing loss in Q 2 will be over $10/share"
"I know this board includes a few ""pump and dump"" types but I hope there are a few serious investors. If you want to better understand where CACC is going, take a close look at the transcript of the earnings call. They do a good job of spinning the Q 1 results, but they are quite careful to avoid too much optimism on the future . So a quick read may leave you feeling good about CACC, but to me, I close read and some analysis means it was a bad Q( lots of charge offs and increased del, even after those charge offs) and the CEO and CFO realize they cannot say too much about the future as these remarks are recorded. This will not go to zero, but they face some real earnings and liquidity issues. Sub prime borrowers have high unemployment, leading to more credit losses and need to add collateral to recent securitization. Then the covenants on the Senior debt will likely be violated in Q 2. They will probably renegotiate on this points but it will cost a few $$$good luck either way you are long or short"
"Cacc is a Ponzi scheme. They extort from poor ppl and reposed cars to resell at a profit. The funny thing is now, they have no secondary market to sell cars. I guess the jokes on them"
"1st time I heard this:Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Credit Acceptance was unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future"

"CACC Dividend Reinvestment of 40,000 shares at $245 - $260 per share by Beneficial Owner Foss Donald A on 01/25"
"June 17, 2020 1:30 EDT: CACC investors/traders....Attention to Jeroen post 3 days ago on the subject after he first contributes info on copyright infringement (also important). A number of paragraphs down from his first subject (also important regarding copywright infringement) find the paragraph that begins: “We are seeing surprisingly good performance and restraint from our borrowers,” said Don Berman, chief executive of CardWorks, a subprime card lender. “In previous recessions, we saw an immediate draw down of people’s credit and frankly we were expecting it this time.” Instead, borrowers’ balances are falling, he said. Read slowly and digest. This may explain the strength of CACC which is used as an example of a credit phenomena that has been going on. I will contribute an additional, possible factor in a separate post about 3 million wanna be traders showing up in the market. (Some of my contributions don't get posted. Frustrating.)"
"￼ALERTApril 07, 2020Short More CACCHere’s a silver lining to all the mayhem...Back in February, we recommended shorting Credit Acceptance Corporation (CACC) and we are already up 36%. The outlook for the company has gotten even worse, and we think the stock will fall further from here.CACC loans money to people with low credit scores to buy used cars. As you can imagine, very few people on the low credit spectrum are borrowing money to buy a car right now. The economy is on tilt, unemployment is skyrocketing, and a lot of folks are more worried about paying for groceries than buying a secondhand car—and rightly so.The CEO of CarMax, a used car retailer, said same-store sales plummeted at least 50% in the last two weeks of March at most locations.In addition, with people losing their jobs, defaults on the loans CACC has already made will make a big jump. And the company will probably end up pursuing repossession, since the cars are the collateral for these loans.The problem is the value of that collateral is tanking as I write, because nobody is in the market for a car. So CACC will have to mark down the value of their assets significantly. Earnings over the next few quarters are going to be ugly.CACC has seen a lot of insider selling lately too. The company’s founder, Donald Foss, has sold 30,666 shares within the last two weeks alone. The total value of those shares was $8.4 million.CACC’s valuation is still too high as well, even after shares dropped 36% over the last month. It’s currently trading at 1.8 times book value.This stock should not be trading at a premium to book because the company is probably sitting on a bunch of assets that will become impaired. A book value of 0.75 is a more fitting valuation.At 0.75 times book, CACC would be about a $100 stock. That’s about 60% below the current share price—and even that price target may end up being generous.Recommendation: Increase your allocation to a short position in Credit Acceptance Corp. (CACC) from 2% to 4% at the market."
Ah is at 260. Let it begin
Strong day yesterday! This stock and company continues to outperform
Stock was priced for perfection; earnings far from it...Can you say lead balloons?
"Apr 21, 2020,09:42am EDT28,757,728 Reasons To Be Concerned About Subprime Auto LoansMichael MolnarMichael MolnarContributorHedge Funds & Private EquityI discuss how investing and markets are changing.Signs of risk in the subprime auto loan market are piling up. As previously detailed, the components that drive these loans are unsustainable: very old cars, countless extra add-on costs, long terms and insanely high interest rates. That math will struggle to work in any economy, much less the current one. Recent developments signal that the struggle is coming to a head.uncaptionedGETTYFirst, Credit Acceptance Corporation, a major subprime auto lender, issued an 8-K on April 20, 2020 where it disclosed that its quarterly filing will be delayed. These situations can happen, especially during the current environment, but it is not something that anyone would deem a good development.Second, in that same filing, the company disclosed that their business was having problems and they would be adding a new risk factor to their 10-K. The new risk factor is interesting for several reasons:New risk factors are always intriguing: One can argue that you should spend a lot more time reading 10-K risk factors than listening to management talk. Why? Management knows if there is a problem and it is not listed as a risk factor, they may have legal problems in the future. In poker terms, it is often a “tell” into what is really going on.Comments on liquidity: The 8-K stated, “...it is likely that the pandemic will adversely affect our business, team members, current and potential consumers, automobile dealers, and vendors, as well as our financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations.” This is true for many companies but perhaps even moreso for subprime auto lenders.Comments on consumers delaying payments: Next, the 8-K stated that the economic situation, “...led to an increase in unemployment and resulted in many consumers delaying payments or re-allocating resources, leading to a significant decrease in our realized collections. We are working with our consumers to provide temporary relief where possible, including the suspension of involuntary vehicle repossessions.” It would be interesting to know what these temporary relief programs entail. Sometimes players in this industry delay payments, but with penalties and exorbitant fees.Comments on used car prices: Then, the company states, “In addition, a recession or further financial market correction resulting from the spread of COVID-19 could adversely affect demand for used vehicles.” If your business is built on repossessing cars, but the value of those cars goes down dramatically, that can lead to big problems. Especially if 35% or so of loans do not work out historically, begging the question of how many loans won’t work out in a worse economy.Most Popular In: Hedge Funds & Private EquityUgur Sahin Becomes A Billionaire On Hopes For Technology Behind COVID-19 VaccineFrank Baker Pays Off Tuition For Graduates Of Historically Black CollegeWhy Hong Kong MattersNow, many astute bean counters may be thinking, “Ok, the delayed filing and new risk factor is interesting, but what about the other 28,757,726 reasons referenced in the title?” That comes down to insider sales by the founder and former Chairman of Credit Acceptance Corporation, Donald Foss. Here are his open market sales in the past few weeks as detailed by Bloomberg:March 24, 2020: 17,366 shares x 260/share = $4,519,502March 25, 2020: 10,100 shares x 280/share = $2,835,171March 26, 2020: 3,200 shares x 302/share = $965,728April 2, 2020: 5,170 shares x 237/share = $1,233,998April 6, 2020: 30,000 shares x 252/share = $7,566,300April 7, 2020: 8,530 shares x 261/share = $2,227,354April 8, 2020: 11,309 shares x 272/share = $3,076,274April 9, 2020: 20,000 shares x 317/share = $6,343,400Grand total: $28,757,726. Now that is a good take for a couple of weeks. The payout was helped by the Federal Reserve buying of junk bonds which, in turn, fueled a rise in share prices for companies tied to debt and leverage-based business models. Donald Foss should send a thank you card to the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell.We will likely hear a lot more about subprime auto loans in coming weeks and months. There will be discussions on:Bull and bear cases for the equity and debt.Cash flow analysis and delinquency rates.The need to support the auto ABS market.Lost in these discussions will be the fact that there are real people beholden to these loans. And the awful irony is that many people on the front lines of this pandemic - delivery workers, healthcare personnel and restaurant employees - are the ones on the hook. Many would argue that is the risk that we should be trying to mitigate, not “fixing” the financial markets that fueled this kind of debt in the first place."

"CACC is of course much larger and more profitable than in the 1990 and 2006-10 credit crises, but there stock traded well under 25 and down to 2 . Perhaps not relevantbut look at the credit risk to subprime borrowers. And financed with warehouse lines...when those are called, the business stops and they cannot run off the existing loans without losing more than the equity.Could be a zero, but definitely has a long way to fallLarge SH could attempt short squeeze of course so be careful, but I think there is 50% chance this once huge money maker does not survive this crisis"

"Subprime auto lenders are starting to default at record pace!Growing numbers of small subprime auto lenders are closing or shutting down after loan losses and slim margins spur banks and private equity owners to cut off funding. Summit Financial Corp., a Plantation, Florida-based subprime car finance company, filed for bankruptcy late last month after lenders including Bank of America Corp. said it had misreported losses from soured loans. And a creditor to Spring Tree Lending, an Atlanta-based subprime auto lender, filed to force the company into bankruptcy last week, after a separate group of investors accused the company of fraud. Private equity-backed Pelican Auto Finance, which specialized in ‘deep subprime’ borrowers, finished winding down last month after seeing its profit margins shrink."

Straight to bankruptcy. Shorter than I thought because of all the delinquent loans with still 50+ months to go. They need to keep the Ponzi scheme going with new loans to cover old bad loans. Running out of car buyers at this point!

CACC stock trades at 2x book Value the industry average is .5x book value. Used cars loan origination are grinding to a halt. Founder and former CEO recently sold 8.5 million in stock. Yes this has been a very shareholder friendly company however the current economic conditions has not been reflected to the stock price. This is a thinly traded stock with a small float. It’s easy to manipulate the price until it’s not. GOOD LUCK
"Almost no volume. Insiders cashing out, shorts already squeezed out and no buyers left."
Don’t understand the price action today.
Credit Acceptance is down 5.71% to 401.28
"How could Foss, founder and largest shareholder, sell $2.8 million of stock the day BEFORE the 10Q was filed?http://www.ir.creditacceptance.com/static-files/cee6d163-966a-4930-ba71-bc1b18c7937f"
CACC still didn’t release Q1’20 earnings. They are working on making numbers look good. Of course 30%+ of Sub-prime auto loans are delinquent. CACC is going down and playing with the accounting numbers....Hence so many class action law suits are there against CACC.
$550.00 is coming !!!!
Will the lawsuits for hiding the risky car loans push CACC to bankruptcy or will the market penalize it for booming losses and then CACC will file bankruptcy?

CACC assets are impaired. They will be significantly writing down the value of their assets in the coming months. Why is this stock trading at a premium to book. .75 to book would be a 100 stock. Please help me out here. Am I missing something. COMMENTS PLEASE
How are you Shorts feeling now. I told you years ago you would be caught with your shorts down. This is a solid company with much more growth to come
Any more questions !!!
CACC over the last decade has repurchased over 40% of its shares this ha contributed to a significant portion of its increased earnings per share. This repurchase has tapered in recent years and will likely end.
"“This difference is recorded as an allowance for credit losses along with a corresponding provision for credit losses. During the most recent quarter, we recorded a provision for credit losses of $157.9 million related to new Consumer Loan assignments. Over the life of the loan, assuming actual cash flows are equal to our forecast, an amount equivalent to this provision for credit losses will be recorded as finance charge revenue, which is recognized using the same effective interest rate used to record the loan.The remaining provision for credit losses of $196.8 million reflects a reduction in our estimate of future net cash flows from our Loan portfolio discussed below. Under CECL, the net present value of the change in our net cash flow forecast is recorded as a provision for credit losses.”So essentially $158 of revenue and expense was grossed up because of the adoption on a new accounting standard. If this is backed out revenue declined by 36% from prior quarter on apples to apples basis if I’m interpreting correctly."
I wouldn't be surprised if this hit $400/share and went bankrupt the following day.
Yea this makes sense.... patience. so many downgrades so much bad news in this industry.
North Carolina banned this company from doing business in the state years ago. Its time for its coffin nails.
The price of CACC is irrational. It was in decline prior to covid and two days ago was above its April 2019 high when the economy was rolling! I’m short via a bear call spread and liking my chances.
"June 8: In the last 6 months of insider shares transacted, compare the number of stock shares purchased vs the number sold. On Yahoo Finance it is shown to be 1 to 7 1/2. Perhaps that has been dramatically skewed toward numbers of shares sold due to the corona virus."

"I cannot find a better company to short after a short squeeze that was just experienced. I suspect all the big money will be hopping back in short at this level.""Debt is not covered by cash flow."" Now why would Simply Wall Street (SWS) in its analysis bother to state that ? It's credit rating (as I recall) is in the B category which is not with friendly rates. So it had better have good cash flow to cover debt in my opinion. ""Significant insider selling over the last three months."" (Link) And how 'bout the bucks it will be paying to defend itself from numerous law suits ? If indeed there are serious shenanigans being done by the company expect the law suits to be successful; how is that going to smack it financially ? I don't know the company survives if new governance were to take over. It gets ""passes"" a for a list of criteria stated by SWS, but I am doubtful it is going into the next few quarters expecting the market is on its way up. The next federal stimulus package may be a shadow of the first one with respect to money's to the unemployed considering the way the legislative wrangling is going on. I watch the politics closely, and I think it is a mistake believing the remaining two quarters of this year is going to be nearly as supportive, and I figure that will make a big dent in car payments made.Don't put this on me if you get in again short like I am considering, and it does not work out. I am expecting time to have to pass with me being patient. But it is worth it to me. If you do, be aware of the wash sale rule that requires 30 days from your loss to be able to use your loss for tax purpose. (More to this, and I urge you to study up and be understanding of the IRS wash sale verbiage.)I think for some of you it was the thing to do to gut it out as some have. My hat is off to you even if you got out with a loss. I did, but in updating and re-assessing, my mind is that I don't want history to flush me out of what may be a good come back. If you pace yourself back in, you may do some recovering. How 'bout a net gain"
"Will the Fed pump billions into this? If so then they have a printing press..... they can over print the short sellers, but will they save this rip off artist company? I mean it isnt boeing or Carnival cruiselines. This is an aggressive repo company with questionable tactics - banned from some states."
"I am not one to short a company but with a market cap of $8.1 billion and net debt of $4 billion the company is being valued at $12 + billion. This valuation comes on the back of revenue that is roughly $1.4 billion/year and ~40% operating margins. Even if there was little risk to their business this company is overvalued. Debt/EBITDA is ~4.5x and their net income is less than 30% of revenue. Margins and net income aren't terrible but the valuation is a bit absurd. There are biotech companies and pharmaceutical companies that have higher net margins and far lower debt to EBITDA ratios that are valued, on sales to cap/price and PE, significantly less. This company is being valued at 8x sales - you can't tell me that stock market is much different than a roulette wheel."

In every portfolio they own, the largest majority of the loans are written in Michigan, which has been hit exceptionally hard. All of the loans are sub-600 FICO with 22%+ interest and built for defaults to occur. Once someone defaults on the loan, wages are garnished, the vehicle is recovered and sold at auction to recoup as much as possible. They sell you a car for 15k (worth 10k) for you to drive it off, pay a few months, then sell it at auction for face value. Rinse and repeat.So what happens when A. wages cannot be garnished and B. the auctions are not moving cars? $CACC is stuck with the bill and incredibly vulnerable to collapsing."

"I've been short for months and closing out half my position today. Sometimes you have to give in and take emotion out of it. Even though I think this is a terrible company, the earnings of other companies who primarily serve lower income customers (ORLY for example) have been fantastic due to the extra stimulus and unemployment checks. A large number of people on unemployment were making more than they were before and the checks are consistent and stable."
I sold short 1500 shares on 3/25 at 311.2 profit to date 143k. This went a long way to offset my losses in the energy sector. I’m by no means a professional analysts just a little research and common sense. I’m not covering until we are well under 100. I see at least another 143 k profit in the coming weeks. Jump on board and enjoy the ride.

April data from subprime asset-backed securities showed delinquency levels across card, auto, and other loans were flat, she said. “Fiscal policy is really keeping the subprime borrower afloat.”Markets have responded — the gap between yields on subprime-backed securities and US Treasuries has dropped sharply, while new deals have met high demand.In auto loans — the largest and most liquid part of the subprime ABS market — $3bn in securities have been issued since the start of May, roughly equivalent to the same period last year, Ms Thomas noted. Investors have more than covered these issues with orders.The spread between the yields on triple A-rated subprime auto ABS has fallen to 1.2 percentage points above Treasuries, according to data from Bank of America, compared with a peak of 4.25 in March. At the beginning of the year, spreads were below 0.5 percentage points.Line chart of Spread over Treasures, per cent, by credit rating showing Subprime auto loan ABS“We are seeing surprisingly good performance and restraint from our borrowers,” said Don Berman, chief executive of CardWorks, a subprime card lender. “In previous recessions, we saw an immediate drawdown of people’s credit and frankly we were expecting it this time.” Instead, borrowers’ balances are falling, he said.“Since 2010 we have seen our consumer be far more responsible in terms of use of their credit limit — the awareness of the importance of a good credit score has risen,” he added. He also noted that support programmes from the US government, in the form of payment forbearance and other measures, have “made all the difference”.Don Gayhardt, chief executive of Curo, which makes unsecured personal loans to subprime borrowers, painted a similar picture. “Our overall loan volume fell in April and again in May — more people are paying off loans rather than re-borrowing,” he said.Curo’s net lending volumes are down by half since the crisis hit, which Mr Gayhardt attributes to tightening of the company’s credit standards and “customers paying off loans at a higher than normal clip”.Questions remain, however, about what happens when state-backed stimulus programmes expire. Ms Thomas of Loomis Sayles noted that, while delinquencies remained low, between 5 and 15 per cent of the loans in subprime ABS had been extended, which was roughly double normal levels.“The big issue is where credit performance is going,” said Theresa O’Neill, ABS strategist at Bank of America. Higher levels of loan extensions were typically followed by higher delinquencies, she said, “but these are unusual times [and] much remains to be seen”.Shares in Curo, while still below their pre-coronavirus levels, have more than doubled from April lows. Subprime auto lenders Santander Consumer and Credit Acceptance have had similar rebounds, with Credit Acceptance surpassing its February highs.Mr Berman of CardWorks expects his customers will remain careful. “A subprime borrower lives their entire financial existence in recession,” he said. “They don’t have the bandwidth a prime or super-prime customer has. So they tend to be resilient in times like this, and they will be a good leading indicator of the economy as we come out of this.”"

Lost of short covering and day traders and manipulation by market makers. It’s the fundamentals of CACC business plan that will sink the stock in a severe recession and millions out of work. Don’t forget CACC finances those with poor credit and unfortunately they were the first to lose jobs
"1040 eastern: Yea....With all the legal representation from claimants, it is most likely something/s legally were settled in favor of the company.

June 8: Any who have enjoyed major gains over the last few trading gains will have their loyalty to the stock tested should the stair stepping downward continue during the day today. Yet my orginal post here still stands as with respect to the longs will mostly sell to secure their profits rather than take a chance holding on with arguably wishful thinking there is more gain to be made soon. The longs can close now and wait for the stock to become more price stable to allow them to get back in if they think there is more upside to enjoy or just if they are just loyal to the company long term.
Does anyone know who’s buying this stock? And why.

"I have been an active Dealer with Credit Acceptance for 27 years, all I've heard from these type of message boards is negative miss information. This company is the only Leander that has been active in the market place for the last 27 years, it has been a privilege in that time to help thousands of customers be able to get the automobile they needed no one else would say yes. Many of the same customers come back and trade into much lower interest rates and even buy new cars once their credit is rebuilt. It must be that everyone on this message board is just a hater or has never needed a hand up when they were not able to get a car loan for the family. Or Maybe your the same Haters that are mad that you did not buy in when you were saying the same thing 25 years ago at $8.00. Just go shorty its always fun to watch the cover anyway. take your pick go long or go short, I'll be at the top as I have been for 27 Years laughing all the way to the bank!!!!!"
ALLY bank which is better positioned than CACC is down 55% from Feb while CACC only down 25% from Feb highs - ALLY will survive as its more diversified lending but CACC chances are slim - yet trading at premium! Markets will catch up.
This is not a day trade. Earnings in April will not tell the story. October earnings will be a better gauge of CACC issues. I continue to add to my position. Good luck and be patient

"I wouldn't touch this stock unless it goes below $100. This has been a jiggle for a long time with very questionable accounting and quirky lending. Even though they have some revolving credit a Democratic Administration has a bull-eye on their practices. Furthermore, 30 to 40 percent of their dealers will not survive the downturn and assuredly the gov't will put caps on interest rates for the downtrodden and you will see everybody essentially being a sub-prime lender."
