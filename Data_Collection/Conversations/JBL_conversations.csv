Whats going on? Why the dive?
"Hi everyone,I'm new to the board and I just wanted you to know that BBL has partnered with Ossia for their wireless charging technology; they have the COTA system which has been on display at the recent telecom shows and it actually works! I think JBL is going to get a market cap equal to the other players in the arena - AVGO, etc. due to this new partnership. Wireless charging is the Holy Grail for the IoT future....good luck!!"
I heard about JBL the other day on (http://Rightpicker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
Long and strong lets hope im right.
JBL is up 11.17% to $24.69
"Hello all. I'm actually pretty #$%$ and I'm not a professional investor. However, I thought I would share some reasons why I am bullish for $JBL/Jabil (and some info for the ?? 's too).?? Reasons1. I like this stock.2. Stonks only go up.3. FMR, LLC (Fidelity) recently scooped up $30,000,000 in shares. Now owning 15% of shares. That is some pretty strong support.4. Earnings. Their next earnings report is expected 3/12, only 3 weeks away. Last earnings were a slam-dunk. They made record amounts of money this quarter, and partly into the next earnings they are very forward looking in their statements.5. FDA clearance...For facemasks. Yes, probably not the biggest news, but still good news. With masks being federally mandated, seems like they can make more tendies from this.6. One of their subsidiaries is medical device company, NP Medical, Inc. Food for thought.?? Reasons.1. The market is volatile as hell. It makes me pee my pants sometimes.2. Some people don't like the stock.3. It seems shares are mostly owned by institutions. This may not be good for the little guys.4. Blackrock and Vanguard recently sold a couple million in their shares. Could be taking profit, could be a bad sign. Too early to tell.I'm trying to be less #$%$ so my wife will spend less time with her boyfriend and more time with me, so if you have any input I would like to hear it. Thanks for attending my ted talk.I bought some calls with play money and am riding to earnings."

Joanne Morretti will be missed she brought innovation to this company.
excitement is off the chart
"Many innovations will be coming to the market via JAB....wirelss charging, driver monitoring of distracted drivers and more intelligent RF packaging systems. Not an ""exciting"" stock, but a company with its fingers in just about everything...oh and in case I forgot to mention - the iphone..."
Why was this not major news?

I don't see any reason except stock was close to 52 weeks high. investors were expecting a beat on top and bottom line. But a 9% drop is not justified in my opinion.
"Crushed earnings, partners with big bad apple tertiary business is clocking serious margin? What gives? What am I missing? No action as of yet?"

"Sold JBL near the top man got really lucky. I am back here because I noticed its really falling off and my original June 31 options are below my initial entry price. I am tempted to trade it again but its looking bad I wonder whats up. My current list of Rebound stocks when a china deal is made or just before the news of one comes out. In order of my favorite plays. AMSWA, AMD, JNPR, JD, LSCC, WB, BIDU. My top 4 are July Call Options. The others Sept and Oct calls."

Shorts in trouble here... institutions will be banging the close on the buy side / you do not sell stocks like this that have this kind of momentum
JBL is on Fire. All the Big Money is missing out on this stock! I cant wait until they come in. If things keep up I think JBL can hit $32.50 by June and potentially hit $34.00 by September. Call options is where the real money is made!
How many stocks do you know that jumps more than 10% in this market? This will crash soon. Time to sell.I will buy back at $21-$22
any thoughts where this goes before and after earnings?
"Some one is long? prediction?for the 14th i""m thinking to buy or not it.."

JBL has a market capitalization of 8.5 billion dollars. JBL’s annual revenue is 27 billion dollars. Those numbers are always reversed with a growing / profitable business. What other corporation has the numbers reversed like that????
"I guess I really jinxed myself JBL down from $28.54 Monday to $27.75 today! I don’t get it, this is a solid stock in my opinion. The chances of a $29 strike being made by March 22 is looking pretty much impossible at this point!"

"JBL's profit margin and operating margin are a joke. Regardless of how much JBL makes in revenue, when you make peanuts for the amount of work you do. Not to mention the $2.45 billion in debt that is costing JBL $138 million in interest expense. Almost $22 billion in revenue but only $189 million in income. And you guys are complaining JP Morgan's downgrade?This is going down to 28...27...maybe even 25.50."

"Signs of life. Beat four quarters in a row. Added a dividend. Started a stock buyback, Supply shortage in their space. A wise old farmer once told me, In a drought all signs of rain fail.So, I am thinking, despite these signs of life Jabil is actually dead. Among the most recent posters are more who have not posted in the past 3 years than havs posted in the last three months. Excitement here would be almost unthinkable. Quiet you say ? Morgue ? 1. a place where bodies are kept, especially to be identified or claimed.""the cadavers were bagged and removed to the city morgue. All who have not posted in three years have been sent there. Carry on."
Wake Up!!!!!!!!!! Geez...... so overdue to move higher!!!! Can someone kick it
"Demand high, margins increasing, buyback in place. The effects of fewer shares out and increasing earnings will be viewed Jabil (NYSE:JBL) will release its earnings data before the market opens on Wednesday, September 29th. Analysts expect Jabil to post earnings of $1.15 per share for the quarter."
"Wow! Pound salt. Fly like a bee. May a elephant walk on your grand father's grave. My, my, what a quiet place!!"

JBL is up 4.93% to 33.63
JBL is down 7.41% to 20.11
"I doubt that JBL will go much higher. With less than 8% gross profit, either their customers are getting a huge bargain, or JBL is very inefficient. Of course, the business they are in, you can't expect great efficiency. The alternative is to raise their prices which will reduce their sales volume. They should shoot for about 20% gross profit so even if sales dropped in half they would still make more profit than below 8% gross. JMHO but based on 50 years experience at IBM and other companies."
The stock is looking good at 28.22
I shorted today. I may did wrong decision by shorting it. But to late now. Good luck to me.
Why is this down?
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jabil-bolsters-sustainable-packaging-capabilities-134500656.html
Is Jabil doomed?(1) High debt at a time when interest rates are rising.(2) Rising mobile phone prices are likely to slow sales reducing the need for circuit boards.(3) Semiconductor sales - at least in the short term - have soften. Lower demand for semiconductors implies a lower demand for the boards that mount those chips on.
