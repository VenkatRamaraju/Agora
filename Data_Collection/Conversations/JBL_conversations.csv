we are flying today. even better expected next week and after an approved and constant increase in revenues . maybe a split coming as well which will allow more of the younger investors to come in and drive it higher after a split. this companies world wide manufacturing may have a benefit over shipping back up .
earnings are disappointing did not expected that
lots of increased target prices by the big boys . seems 70 a good target .
secret stock sneaking up and up . doubled once and my guess double again from worldwide demand of this manufacturer
Wanna know what's going to happen to this stock going forward? Go back to its high in Aug 2000 and then see what the stock did moving forward from that price. Let history be your teacher here.
I shorted today. I may did wrong decision by shorting it. But to late now. Good luck to me.

New apple products coming out and apple being one of $JBL’s biggest consumers you would think it should be going up?
"Demand high, margins increasing, buyback in place. The effects of fewer shares out and increasing earnings will be viewed Jabil (NYSE:JBL) will release its earnings data before the market opens on Wednesday, September 29th. Analysts expect Jabil to post earnings of $1.15 per share for the quarter."

"Wow! Pound salt. Fly like a bee. May a elephant walk on your grand father's grave. My, my, what a quiet place!!"

"Signs of life. Beat four quarters in a row. Added a dividend. Started a stock buyback, Supply shortage in their space. A wise old farmer once told me, In a drought all signs of rain fail.So, I am thinking, despite these signs of life Jabil is actually dead. Among the most recent posters are more who have not posted in the past 3 years than havs posted in the last three months. Excitement here would be almost unthinkable. Quiet you say ? Morgue ? 1. a place where bodies are kept, especially to be identified or claimed.""the cadavers were bagged and removed to the city morgue. All who have not posted in three years have been sent there. Carry on."
hold till earnings release should be very good!
"this has been a quiet stock with improved growth . not much public info but growing well world wide ,buy back with slightly high depth not sure why but 2 internal positions sold at 62 plus . hopefully this doubles faster than normal"
