10b market cap? Is it overvalued with current revenue? Lockup period will dilute more .
"No news, still increasing on a red day?"
"230m net loss last year, 11b company, somethings not right here…Then again nasdaq is full of these types of companies right now"
Confluent is up 9.53% to 57.95
Still this overvalued. Look at the market capital for current and estimated revenue for next year. It should be below 4b market cap
200 million in revenue people with 1500 employees. what a joke. good luck with getting hammered after future earnings come out
nice volume - 4x 10 days avg
Yikes.
Bullish action today holding gains...looking for 60-70 in July
It will settle down in 20s … chill down
