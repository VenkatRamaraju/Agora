10b market cap? Is it overvalued with current revenue? Lockup period will dilute more .

723Bil market OMG
Just like SNOW will fly despite constant bashers...
$100 by end of this year!
Why it’s going down ?
ridiculous to see $17b valuation. but congratulations to all shareholders

Love this stock. Super low daily volume though
I think $50 by Friday!
$50 by the end of July
$50 very soon
Last week I said $60 soon. Look at the momentum. $60 this week.
Still this overvalued. Look at the market capital for current and estimated revenue for next year. It should be below 4b market cap
Confluent is up 9.60% to 59.21
