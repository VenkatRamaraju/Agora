"a strong infrastructure business for Kyndryl's most likely customer base is led by consulting and ""really deep"" professional services capabilities around its six key practices.""Think about 'digital workplace', for instance – there's a lot of opportunity to design and build the next-generation, hybrid digital workplace environment for customers,"" Edwards says.However, Edwards believes Kyndryl won't have a ""massive impact"" on the UK mid-market channel, unless it looks to team up with specialists in specific areas such as cloud or cybersecurity.Channel overlap is likeliest at the high end. For example, in large enterprise accounts with a lights-off computer centre managed by the top four or five biggest channel partners, he suggests.Colangeli: Channel partnerships will remain keyDespite these misgivings, Tosca Colangeli, UK and Ireland president of Kyndryl and former general manager of IBM Cloud and Technology Platform Services UKI, says the new entity places ""a high premium"" on channel partnerships, with multiple global alliances rolled over and maintained through a smooth transition out of IBM.""It’s why one of the first appointments was Stephen Leonard, a seasoned technical leader, to lead Kyndryl’s global alliances,"" she says.""Our customers rely heavily on the systems we run because they have established strong partnerships and trust in our professionals.""Colangeli says that Kyndryl will be ""the world leader"" in managing complex and critical infrastructures ""from day one"" as well as the top hybrid cloud managed services firm.""At twice the size of our nearest competitor, we have $19 billion (£13.7 billion) in revenue and unrivalled expertise managing mission-critical infrastructure across hybrid multi-cloud ... with 90,000 experts serving more than 4,500 customers.""Partners will benefit from Kyndryl's independence and ability to focus ""solely"" on modernising customer-owned infrastructures, coupled with increasing investments in next-gen tech and services for all cloud platforms, Colangeli says.""Kyndryl has the technology integration capabilities and skills that support 70% of the UK banking industry. That is an unprecedented footprint and bench of expertise,"" she says. ""For companies with legacy applications, running massive data pools is a tremendous challenge."""
"seriously, a slight revenue miss and a 15 dollar drop in shareholder price.I like that we have a big dividend coming up soon.That Kendryl will be splitting and I'll be getting shares in that stock as well.I think kendryl will hold its own, and the origianl ibm will be in a better growth position.If it can spin down on a dime it can spin back up, jsut as quickly.There is a lot of expertise within this company within a very complex field."
Sounds like the effect of the last earning is over and the share price is ready to recover. Let's hope to see 130 by next week.
"When ibm split off outsourcing from the company and formed issc it was a lean org with only 3 layers of mgmt. they were nimble and won a lot of business. Then Ibm layered mountains of mgmt… accountants,,, laid off good folks and sent jobs to lower cost labor overseas. Then the board hired ‘ gin mill Ginny’ to run the company into the ground. Languishing in the bargain basement of tech. I hope this isn’t another major blunder by the bod."
Owned this stock for a few years and admit it is a poor investment. The CEO in my opinion is not capable of turning this company around. He is all talk the execution is nonexistent. Unfortunately for me I still own shares of this poorly run company.
"Thank God, IBM spinning off the services unit as a independent company, and not like chip unit paying a competitor billions of dollars to take it off its hands. Making an attempt to run it as a successful business unit is out of the question for this incompetent CEO who enjoys unlimited support from ceremonial BOD. IBM stock price reflects what investors thinks about this spin off."
"If for every 5 IBM shares a holder receives 1 KD share, and 1 KD share trades at $39, as it does now on a ""when issued"" basis, that means every IBM share gets $7.80 ($39/5) in KD ""value"" per IBM share. So, simple math says IBM should trade at about $120 per share post deal, but simple math is fairly irrelevant. IBM is splitting off the KD unit because they believe the sum of the parts is greater than the whole. Also, uncertainty about any transaction keeps the price low. That uncertainty will be gone soon. So, my guess is that in about two weeks IBM will trade at about $130 and KD at about $50, giving pre-deal holders a total value based on pre-deal shares of $140 per share. ($130+50/5). It wouldn't make a whole lot of sense for IBM to do this transaction if the result isn't in that ballpark or better.Good luck, longs."
so whats the ibm stock price going to be adjusted to after the spin off? and KD spin off just seems confusing to me.
"October 26, 2021--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The IBM (NYSE: IBM) board of directors today declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $1.64 per common share, payable December 10, 2021 to stockholders of record November 10, 2021.This $1.64 per share payment is the first dividend that will be paid by IBM after the expected November 3, 2021 separation of Kyndryl."
"I may get some lost back with this! IBM) board of directors today declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $1.64 per common share, payable December 10, 2021 to stockholders of record November 10, 2021"
Its AMAZING lots of companies going into the trillions and IBM cant get out of 100 millions for a decade
"would I get KD shares, If I buy IBM shares now ?"
"Stayed green for a minute, went into shock, and quickly retreated back red where it feels more at home."
Do I get kyndryl shares if I buy IBM shares today ? thanks in advance
"It appears to me that IBM post-KD is far leaner and more focused which also means it should be more attractive as an acquisition candidate by individual shareholders and by a potential acquirer of the entire company. A few good ones come to mind.Good luck, longs."
"It is interesting that Josh Brown is negative on IBM when he is positive on Simon Properties. IBM has strong free cash flow generation and pays a good dividend. Yes this is not pumped as a high growth Tech company but it will survive and will adopt to a ongoing technology company. They the ""analyst and hedge funds"" trashed AMD, CISCO, Intel and others in the past and will continue to trash stocks so they can make a buck on the drops."
"Unfortunately, the new IBM going forward , will most likely get but a tiny fraction of the cloud pie , which is already carved up between the 4 giants.. When the Pentagon doesn't even consider you in the running for a cloud contract, you pretty well know your days are number.. I doubt they will generate enough cloud revenue to stay alive.. And Kyndryl,, well lets just say Kyndryl will probably turn into Kindling .."
IBM cloud and AI will be worth over a trillion in 3 to 5 years. No question about it. I am picking up another 1000 shares at these low prices
Ok Chanios short this stock at 142 making a killing so now it’s time for him to get out. KD will go on 4 Nov 2021. Anyone who owned the shares on 22 Oct 2021 will get KD stock 1 for every 5 ibm owned. How much will KD be who knows.
"For past ten years IBM board and two successive incompetent CEOs have miserably failed Ivenstors, IBM employees and customers. Long term IBM stock investors have suffered from declining stock price, loyal and hard working employees constantly exposed to headcount cuts, IBM customers have suffered from failure of major IT contracts such as Anderson MD, State of Wisconsin pension, Australian government project. IBM BOD has responded by providing unlimited support to company's leadership."
