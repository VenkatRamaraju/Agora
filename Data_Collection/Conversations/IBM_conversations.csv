"Dividends are irrelevant if any Management can GROW a company to position its products or services INDESPONSIBL FORCE IN THE MARKET. That's cash better used than Dividends pay. Look no further than FAANG. I certainly never support stock buy back unless you sitting on MOUNTAIN of CASH and a crashed market times, so you can buy at very discounted price.."
One of the best buys in the market.
Big Blue is rising again!
140 now the resistance level after hitting 150 in June. Sad... Many smart investors leaving before the split. Heading for another $1 plus down day.
Going red ! Amazing after all the hype ! Many investors snookered  big time !
"There was a woman on one of the business channels yesterday that said ibm can either choose to try and grow, or they can continue to pay the fat dividend, but they can’t do both. Just not enough free cash."
If this gaps down even slightly tomorrow morning the next stop will be 132.
Why down so much this morning premarket. Is it because ex div.
"Kyndryl has maybe 5 years to exist before is is sold or goes bankrupt. IBM put Schroeder in place to play ball when they take a corporate dump on Kyndryls's balance sheet. All the notional account liability, most operational debt, dividend burden, numerous open litigations, and excess employees will be Kyndryl's. All of IBM's sins of the past.Good news is after the spinoff Apple will buy IBM."
"I was asked by another person here if I plan to buy Kyndryl when it becomes available.... My response was: probably not, the remaining part of IBM believes that the Kyndryl half is ""cancerous"" and therefore is cutting off an arm and a leg to get rid of it. (and they will try to make a go of it without those limbs - it may be hard to walk) I don't think that Kyndryl (GTS Division) is cancerous, but it remains to be seen if that half (or the other) can drive growth... People think that this is just a little division that IBM is divesting - it is not!! it truly is about half of the company. THIS IS MAJORLY DISRUPTING !! The remaining part (labeled IBM) is truly NOT IBM anymore, it is mostly Red Hat and software.. ( this may be good??) And, the part divesting (kyndryl), is more truly IBM. (this might be bad, as its the same old thing??) If your holding IBM you will magically get equal shares in Kyndryl - and the ""sum"" of both should ""approximate"" the current value of IBM..... But expect the share price(s) to immediatly do very dramatic things, and expect that there may be hours (or a day??) where your broker cannot execute your share orders for one or the other.... and, as I have posted before, I expect major dividend changes within 6 months of this divestment closing ( A dramatic decrease of the combined dividend value) this does not bode well for the segment of ""income"" investors and I believe that this (and the divestment turmoil) will put downward pressure on both of these companies for a period of time.... I also believe that remaining IBM is controlling the splits to the ""bank accounts"" (assets) and that Kyndryl is not getting its fair slice, this will put unique financial pressure on Kyndryl right from the starting gate.... Meanwhile IBM is on a ""buying spree"" blowing as much money as they can before the ""divorce"""
"On August 12, 1981 (40 years ago today) the IBM Personal Computer model 5150, (commonly known as the IBM PC) was released. It was created by a team of engineers and designers directed by Don Estridge in Boca Raton, Florida. It weighed 25lbs. and had a whopping 16 kilobytes of memory. Wow, times have changed. HAPPY ANNIVERSARY!"
This is turning out to be total earnings fiasco.This should be touching 150 based on report and outlook. Instead we are struggling to maintain 141 when broader market is thru the roof.
Happy to see green. Hope it holds!
IBM’s share price could be anywhere until you look at it. Quantum humor.
"After letting Rommety stay for years while the stock price continually declined, the entire board of directors should be booted. The stock now is back to where it was 15 months ago."
"if you have been waiting for a time to add, or to buy back into IBM...today is your chance. Look for $136-$137 prices today!"
losing steam for no reason
IBM is MSFT 2.0
"I have a suggestion for James Kavanaugh.I think IBM should be buying back stock instead of paying down debt.The stock dividend is costing IBM 4.72% annually whereas, I am sure, the interest rate on their debt, especially short term debt, is probably much lower. Besides, dividend payments are not deductible for tax purposes as is interest. A solid and consistent stock buyback plan would be very well received by the market."
"Q/Q growth in cloud and services revenue..... that is a first in many quarters. I can understand Y/Y growth since 2020 was mostly muted, but it is encouraging to see IBM showing Q/Q growth. IBM seems to start showing turnaround... and the departure of Jim doesn't really have any impact on the company's results."
"why would this be down and it clearly beat EPS, Crocs and Chipotle are up and IBM in the red makes no sense"
That is $3000.00 an hour!
Keeping Ginney on the Board of Directors is a huge negative. She did nothing right for years. Get her out now!
"Everyone is expendable, including Jim. The gavel was never his at IBM. You knew it, we knew it, the world knew it. We're simply facing algos squeezing us short term. Buy."
"I have a sinking feeling that Whitehurst’s sudden and impending departure from IBM was not only orchestrated by Krishna, but also by Rometty? I hope Krishna knows what he has done. It’s put up or shut time for him on 07/19/21, earnings day."
"Any time this dog has a good day, it gives up half or more the next day. Staying true to form."
So all you doomsayers and pseudo stock analysts are wrong again. That is why I ignore you.
"IBM should move up some tomorrow afternoon and Tuesday on better than expected earnings, but the move will be short lived. Most of these tech stocks have had their run."
"This is crazy one person literally one person did this!!!. I really like IBM but how can one person leaving affect the entire company. Fundamentals, product, future,…etc don’t matter unbelievable."
Going woke = Going broke
I think Analysts are downplaying the earnings to help a. their hedge fund client's short position b. have new clients accumulate at low price.This seems like a classic fraudstreet manipulation.
any reason for the 2% pop?
Heading to $150 soon!
Any idea why this stock crashing??
"My friends be careful of IBM. CLOUD AI has deep pocket $$TRILLIONS AMZN, GOOG, MSFT, each are MONUMENTAL GOLIATHS. IBM is spending tinny $1.6 billion R&D in Cloud and AI.. That is tinny drop in the ocean in comparison to the vast $$TRILLIONS of resources of already far and runaway trains decided winners, it's not a debate anymore.. At this juncture IBM paying $6 billion 3% interest/debt is foolish, money wasted, 3% interest that's free money basicly. IBM is late, so crucial critical time wasted paying lowest interest debt is money wasted.. This money should be spent in ABSOLUTELY BUYING MORE OF RED-HATS like PLTR, SNOW and likes, if their hypes are true. Also ONLINE SECURITY Cos that effectively deter, stops cloud data threats.. Make sure acquisition targets products work, this is critical to avoid throwing big money after hyped stocks and DOTcom products. Once market crashes it will show many DOTcoms flying high now were massively overhyped, overpriced..A historically big company like IBM has to position themselves as INDESPONSIBL CONTENDER meaning not just another cloud AI, that IBM products as a choice offers cooperatively equal or better advantage mix or end result outcome..At 3% interest debt, in my personal life and business I would rather buy US Gov treasury 2% and have my cash grow, better yet mix of investments to see it grow at 7%--12%, so IBM can access the liquid cash to purchase when opportunities arise for growth adding vital Company that pushes IBM goal of INDESPONSIBL status.I have to admit, from the CEOs vibe and body language, words, I get the feeling like he knows what he is doing. But the debt paying, and only $1.6b R&D I also feel slightly otherwise nervous that he could be missing. So, I do feel he could use a little help to remind him of strategic moves like the ones I mentioned above..This is just my humble 2 cents.Forgive me for my terrible English."
"Sure they will pick a replacement with talent and vision, perhaps just the catalyst to get this stock where it belongs in the 200-400 range."
I’m looking at IBM from a long term perspective of around 2-5 years. I dunno what will happen in the short term. I feel this won’t move up until after the terms of Kyndryl spin off are known.
"Until IBM fundamental leadership problem is addressed by BOD. IBM stock price is not going to reflect the true value of the company. It will just fluctuate in a range around 140$ for foreseeable future. And as slogans, gimmicks and promise of elusive turn around under previous CEO did not work. It will not work for current leadership either. BOD should take a look at AMD to see how the right talent can change the fortune of company from almost going under to statler performer. IBM is in far better shape."
"The combination of IBM Edge Application Manager and Vantiq’s low-code platform for real-time systems can help enterprises leverage real-time data to help position them to run smarter businesses.Vantiq’s platform is designed to make it easy for developers to integrate real-time data sources – from cameras to sensors and other edge devices – and create applications that monitor assets, events, people and environments that can reduce development cost and allow rapid enhancement in production. These applications can then analyze and act on complex problems, such as a flood, major traffic accident, factory breakdown – or an employee with a 101-degree temperature entering a corporate lobby – all in real time, to help enable a fast and effective response in collaboration with human teams."
i think today and tomorrow will be good buying opportunities. IBM needs to name someone soon. I'm not liking the large volume that's already coming in this morning...
"Market straight up, IBM straight downAnalysts are dragging their feet in raising targets and estimates."
I'm new in the system and I've always had interest to invest but the high rate of lost is what's discouraging..
Continues to be a #$%$
IBM turns the corner at $160
Double beat and guidance raise. Wow.
"I bought in at $140, going to $160"
Does anyone know if IBM will remain in the Dow Jones after the split into KYNDRYL at the end of this year?
I really don’t care about Jim I only care about IBM. This is great company and if you bet against it please don’t use their product.
Finally a chance to get back in!
IBM reported its biggest increase in revenue in three years on the back of strong cloud-computing demand!Sales rose 3.4% to $18.7 billion for the three months ending June 30th. Way to go big blue 
Big Blue will lead the market rebound now - much higher prices are in order - path of least resistance is up.
IBM market cap was $208B in 2001. Now after 20 years IBM market cap is $128B in 2021. Remarkable achievement for IBM BOD and CEOs. The story gets much worse taking into account money spent on IBM stock buybacks. At the same period market cap of other high-tech companies have soared to unprecedented levels. It is insult to think services spin off and hybrid could is going to address the problem. If IBM BOD and CEO were put in charge of Apple or Microsoft. They would run it to ground in a few short years just as they have done at IBM. Sadly this trend will continue for foreseeable future.
"$IBM $WIMI $AMAT rumor has it, this sees 20s next week..."
"IBM has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 4 Buys, 3 Holds, and 1 Sell. The average IBM price target of $151.75 implies 7.8% upside potential from current levels. Shares have increased 9.5% over the past six months. Keep the faith with Big Blue. Just a hiccup this past week. $175 is around the corner. IMHO"
"I have been a shareholder for a few years but concerned about the current culture at IBM. My gut tells me that the Red Hat leader left as he could not work with the IBM CEO, who is a lifetime IBMer. Not a great scenario. Strongly thinking of selling my shares soon because of this."
IBM's biggest asset are it's accountants
".The short defend their positions without fear because they have no real opponents on this stock... if IBM had its Elon Musk, they would have gone with panties on a stick long ago..."
bad timing for the release of this news. It's a holiday weekend so it leaves much uncertainty until Tuesday to see how the shareholders feel about this change.
"5 days until EC. If it is excellent that should bring the pps back to pre-Whitehurst levels IMO. The company has Red Hat and the cloud infrastructure. His departure was a loss, but the company is not any single individual. GLTA "
Amazon’s premarket slide is more than the entire market cap of IBM!!!
Don't get me wrong - I'd like to see IBM get out of the ditch but can one of you smart stock market analysts tell me why the stock of a company that beat quarterly earnings estimates by four c-e-n-t-s a share is up over four d-o-l-l-a-r-s a share premarket? Trading individual stocks is a craps game - buy an index fund or ETF.
Looks like 150s are out of the question for the rest of the year. It was nice while it lasted.
"For the long term, this is a great stock, I think it will go to $200. However, for the short term, I think it will go down a few bucks after a ton of people traded the earnings. At least that is what I’ve seen at least 90% of stocks do after earnings. I think it’s also more likely to happen bc of the market sell off. No position in this either way, so I’m unbiased. I’m thinking about adding to my portfolio when it gets cheaper,"
pretty hilarious that its down the complete annual div due to this guy leaving... like hez that important.. lmao . like there is no complete co full of highly qualified people actually doing the work... staying. over reaction
"LOW FLOAT $QUBT offers are Qatalyst, Qatalyst Core and Qatalyst Platform. The good thing about this company is that you do not need a quantum computing expert or any computer scientists, mathematicians or any on premise professionals. This is a plug and play type business model. Everything is updated and maintained for the end user. (via Woodland Report)$IBM $MSFT $GOOGL $AMZN"
Are they going to continue with the dividend with the company split ?
"Dead money for the rest of the year, imho. No matter what they do, this stock just languishes. Getting rid of Rometty didn't help. Buying RED HAD didn't help. New CEO didn't help. Acquiring a new company every month didn't help. And splitting the company into 2 isn't going to help. Epic failure."
"The tide has changed, revenue up , and eps is up. See you guys at $150."

"I'd buy the dip, but 200 shares held for the last 5 years is enough. I don't want to invest more into nothing more than a utility tech company. I've been reinvesting the IBM dividends into Nvidia and it's paying off handsomely"
"Another typical day of trading for BIG BLUES - up in the morning and steady sell-off in the afternoon. Wash, rinse, repeat..."
Can’t hold $140
"It seems like the Wallstreet gangsters (MMs, Certain Hedge funds, Big Brokerages, Institutions Et al.) have decided to starve this company of capital and minimize their ability to flex their muscles and compete with the competitor valued at half to one trillion-plus dollar and trading at hundreds of times the PE multiples! They rather see this company disintegrate and disappear than regain their former glory and become a leader in their field. JMHO…………. Tex"
Big blue should get rid of it’s dividend and plus-up the B-back program. Let the cloud eat!
"I am back to say, once again, this thing is really bumming me out. That is all"
IBM earnings next week. This may close 143 to 145 tomorrow. New highs next week.
The only thing investors can do is vote your proxy to oust the board.
4th down day in a row. Three days till ER. Does anyone really think earnings are going to meet or beat estimates? LOL.
At 4 to 5 million a year Im sure they will find a new guy.
I can’t wait for tomorrow
"Down almost 1% in addition to drop from x-div. Stock has no strength whatsoever. But growth ""is just around the corner""."
"Still breathing and on the right side of grass. Viewing the posts here I needed to check. The company expects revenue to return to growth and projects about $11 billion to $12 billion in adjusted free cash flow for the year and $12 billion to $13 billion in 2022.Apr 19, 2021"
I need $164 to break even here. Buffett had it right. I would bea buyer here
Great BUY today. News today materially changes nothing.
$GE $IBM $INTC $WBA Worst stocks !! last 5 years.. no gain at all lol
Outpacing the market again...to the down side! Will see 130s before 150s again.
"One has to understand that any discord on large stocks like IBM invite algos to immediately pounce on them. No uptick rule to slow them down either, hence, a large, one day percentage drop. Understand the news isn't as bad as it is and buy more."
"We can all agree $$200 BILLION IBM used to buy back stocks could hv better used for FUTURE GROWTH. IBM certainly had ample opportunities to be $$2 TRILLION Co just like MSFT, GOOG, AAPL..."
"Since IBM has become a utility stock, except with negative growth, what would be a good, actual utility stock to replace it with that has about the same yield? Verizon? ATT?"
Fading... after all the hype to lure retailers in...
PLTR + IBM= success?
Back to solid revenue growth!
That’s why you buy in the false dip narrative of Whitehurst. Back to $145+ tomorrow
"Short term pain, yes. Long term gains, yes. Keep holding my friends. Once all of the dust settles (leaders leaving, leaders stepping up, cloud keeps growing, and earnings keep coming in), IBM will be back in the $170 - $200 range. Be patient."
IBM isn’t dropping like shortcakes tell us it will. We will be here a while.
"CEOs aren't that hard to replace , there are probably a half dozen bright young executives10 years younger who already work there."
$6.56 forward dividend. Great stock. Looking to buy a strong position soon.
do i get dividend if i sell today?
Is it late to join and buy?
Finally a good news 
"IBM has transformed to become true Cloud company combined with server business. If you think about this into competitiveness, this is huge."
"Not sure where the sellers came from today. Thought we were free of them from the Whitehurst heist. Nonetheless, the revenue beat was what we want to see. Buy the lights out below $150. Going much higher."
"Really hoping that Ginny is not taking his job. That will pummel the stock... But then again, this is IBM, a company that destroys shareholder value."
"$QUBT is a new quantum computing pure play, cloud computing and no need for professional expertise, all handled for you via plug and play approach.$IBM $INTC $NVDA $AMD"
"IBM technology development is starting to make a difference,"
"How long will buying revenue streams (BoxBoat) be the number 1 strategy for IBM? IBM used to be known for innovation and a market maker, now it's just a go along get along co."
How flippin ridiculous. IBM was up to $144.95 earlier on GREAT earnings and talking heads like Cramer say earnings were good yet the stock can't hold its gains. Imo pure market manipulation. It's comical GME and AMC held their gains.
"From ZACKS today: ""Estimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, IBM has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months."""
"$IBM $CCIV $WIMI since i dont watch them all the time, im more relaxed.... i hodl my shares, and i add some when i can! I dont care “maybe tomorrow, next week will... or bombshells"
Quick rebound next week. Panic selling by weak hands always great buying opportunity. Have to laugh at the 5% drop and some on this board that feel it will fall further off this news. By end of next week back to the $145 range and within a few weeks of a dividend capture. Thank you for the opportunity Friday.
Relentless sell off after it hit almost 145. Just straight down the cliff.Unbelievable!
Money money
Time has come and IBM delivery is here and the turnaround will be done! Up and up we go!
IBM is up 4.92% to 144.70
"Price target $167, i wish I got more from last earnings when it hit $118 and change, load up the train before it leaves the station folks"
So much for 150. Look on the brightside............. They haven't cut dividends
got (my) email back up today... two weeks of chaos... this doesn't bode well for other major projects (kyndryl -cough cough)
Future is bright blue. Sell off was an expected correction. IBM delivered and we are good to go!
"It is painfully becoming clear that elusive turnaround at IBM will not happen any time soon. Dear honorable IBM BOD, top graduate form Rometty’s school of management is not the most suitable CEO to lead IBM transformation. Rometty after 7 years of dismissal performance purposed her apprentice to replace her and continue with her failed management strategies. Regrettably, IBM BOD dose not take its fiduciary responsibility seriously and see their role more ceremonial and rubber stamping any CEO decisions. Current IBM CEO was a monumental failure running IBM could business. Did Amazon, MS and google spend billions of dollars to buy could technology or core technology was developed in house? Current CEOs fame is because of his leadership role in spending over $30B to buy Redhat. Where is the return on investment? When he was running IBM cloud business what cloud solutions did he develop with vast IBM budget and resources at his disposal. Basically nothing. Dear honorable BOD this is fast paced technology environment, IBM will not survive another several years with incompetent CEO. It is sad and heartbreaking to see IBM BOD is condemning IBM to same fate as Amdahl, Digital, Burroughs computer."
Bear analyst raises from sell to hold. This is what we want to see. Buy.
"$CMG Chipotle Mexican Grill is now 40% of IBM market cap!The way CMG is going it will approach IBM market cap by next year.Tacos Vs. Supercomputers, cloud computing and AIUnreal!"
Why would anyone invest in IBM the last 10 years when you can buy MSFT which rules the world?
when is the splitting business going to happen? only 4 months left in 2021!!
Dudes had pretty good numbers and they got a juicy dividend over 4%. 30year t bills are 2%. Dividend rate is as much as bond rate. Stock is a buy here.
"A trader earns regardless of market fluctuations, I started investing using Brian Scott signals in June of last year, he shared his commercial techniques and helped me achieve my goals and now the profit rate is exponential. TeIegram> @Brianfxtrade"
Hybrid cloud turning out to be a clear winner. Buy.
"A good day for this stock is no longer when it's up, but when it's down less than 1%."
"I fear the Kyndryl stock will tank the moment the spin off occurs, which makes the stand alone ""new IBM"" less appealing....hoping for another run into the 150s before the spin off"
What happened other tech mogules don’t want IBM back as a tech leader! So they short with a pile of money!
"Comparing IBM management to MSFT, AMD, NVDA, and other tech companies, IBM needs to learn how to move forward more progressively."
"Another buying opportunity in the making, IMOWhat's one VP's departure when the company has hundreds"
"JEDI replacement with multi-vendors implies IBM multi-hybrid cloud is still in the race , and possible advantage with leading quantum computers."
"This stock would be down $10 on bad news. Why only up $4 on good news, and still about $10 below recent high?"
"Great quarter but same issues still present, shrinking profitability. Most of the beat was from adjustments. Gaap earnings still in decline."
big blue delivering!
I'm always fascinated with the number of sheep to haircut on this stock...
"There ain't no cure for the Big Blue blues...eight years, $35B, two CEOs, countless acquisitions, and still struggling to return to growth. A shadow of the company it once was, and a diminishing shadow at that."
Still undervalued for big dividends and growth stock. Hybrid will become a new trend for companies to protect their value data
Whitehurst didn’t add anything to the stock price while he was with IBM but his departure caused a decrease? It makes sense only to Wall Street.
There's never been more tech exec. talent out there than right now.
IBM is a good company just don't understand why this stock isn't up over $200!!!
"All 4 major indices up and where is our favorite Dog of the Dow? Down again, of course. But ""growth is just around the corner"" folks! Yea, right... Apparently, ""the street"" is not convinced."
IBM should merge with att..and then GE..corner the market in incompetence.
"I've been googling to see what the bad news is on this stock that it would drop 15$ a share since it's June 10 high of 152.84... and I'm just not reading any really bad news... this is a great dividend stock, not sure what the issue is..."
"great dividend, poor performance"
Much ado about nothing - bought more at $7 off sale price - now back up.
"ER is just one week away, should be the strongest we see in years."
"IBM is playing in GROWTH space, and far lagging in Cloud AI, WHY WOULD YOU WASTE $6bn on paying 3% lowest interest debt?? Use this money to invest in CLOUD, DATA, AI Products that positions IBM as ENVIABLE INDESPONSIBL IN THESE SPACE.. Anything less is longterm erosion and left behind as just another HPQ HPE..If I was IBM CEO, I would even be willing to issue new shares warrants to only existing shareholders with a plan to Buy/develop INDESPONSIBL ENVIABLE products in Cloud, Data, AI that puts IBM on the sure path of rising status and maintaining high margin FUTURE GROWTH Business.. And no buy backs unless you pulled up cash and wait for crash..IBM Spent $200 BILLION cas from glory days in buy backs since 1999 or something I believe. What a waste of money. That $200bn could hv easily been reinvested, today IBM would have been $$2 TRILLION Giant like MSFT, GOOG, AAPL. AMZN.."
"Whitehurst is quite the peach resigning a week before earnings, hinting that maybe there was a problem with earnings. Grandstand central imo. Buy."
IBM turned the corner and is now gaining momentum. Hybrid cloud is the only way to go imo for large organizations. Buy.
"Ginny is no longer on the board but consults once a week for $ 3000.00 to consult.Vote no to all the BOD members, l do."
"Bitcoin is testing all laws of nature and TA in this new period with various speculations and various assumptions turned out severely, it's totally misguided to just sit back hodl and remain by perhaps achieve certain incidents along the line, that is a misguided attitude for a monetary patron because as a monetary sponsor finding ways to deal with reliably addition and stack up more coins as needs be making prof!ts should be the way of life, even experienced shippers are in a vulnerability to take long or short position.

150$ by end of this week
Still believe this a 400 a share stock
I agree with an earlier poster about the IBM name. It should be changed. The current name kind of implies that they make electric typewriters and punch card readers. Google changed to Alphabet. IBM should be able to pick a name better than that.
Buy the dip it all comes out in the wash this company turning around.
"4.6% yield is great but i have significant money locked up in this company for 3 years and i am right back to where i started, i have no problem with the red hat guy leaving, but why cant they figure out how to get on the path to growth- it is really frustrating and i am losing patience."
"He will still be staying on as an advisor. Per IBM:Jim Whitehurst has played a pivotal role in the IBM and Red Hat integration. In the almost three years since the acquisition was announced, Jim has been instrumental in articulating IBM’s strategy, but also, in ensuring that IBM and Red Hat work well together and that our technology platforms and innovations provide more value to our clients. Jim has decided to step down as IBM President, however I am pleased he will continue working as Senior Advisor to me and the rest of the Executive Leadership Team as we continue to evolve our business."
"Just announced, Jim Whitehurst is leaving IBM."
there we go big blue!
Expect bounce back up after yesterday pullback after earnings SP action. IBM position continues to strengthen.
I might have to sell this to buy COIN
And the guy leaving as it turns out means nothing.
"IBM BOD has animosity toward shareholders, keeps picking nonperforming CEOs and leaves them on the job for many years for maximum damage."
"IBM needs to change its name, IMO. It's 2021 and International Business Machines is a bit archaic."
"There's always a successor in the wings, do you think boards of big companiesfly blind?"
"Cheap are we yielding 4.5%, 11 PE, growing revenues for the first time in years. Those thinking IBM is the old IBM in the face of so much change will watch our fortunes soon balloon to $160 and beyond. Buy."
It’s astounding to me the lack of confidence in IBM one guy leaves and everybody Soil’s themselves
Correction - down $4 in 2 days. This thing is toast.
What a dog. Couldn't even hold much of a gain for the morning. This stock is dead money and has been for years. Even Buffett gave up.
Smart money entered below $140. The Whitehurst news was overblown. Enjoy your upcoming dividends as this rebounds.
"Will IBM consulting arm gets the valuation multiple of ACCENTURE ? IBM bought PWC before. If so, windfall is coming."
"There's a lot here that we are not being told. Announcement on a Friday morning of America's most important summer holiday weekend??? This was a vendetta, and this guy Whitehurst is FURIOUS. Whathas most likely happened is that he had been told that he had served out his transition usefulness and that there was no big slice of pie waiting for him at IBM. This is too big a deal for the truth not to surface. Meanwhile it is a wonderful long-term buying oppty."
Thank god Arvin’s had the  to buy CLOUD if he hadn’t this would be trading at $100 with a 10 recovery. As it stands today a $25 recovery perhaps in 2 years if IBM does not screw up the CLOUD BUSINESS.
Down over $3 in 2 days. Why?
"Whitehurst “decided to step down"", usually we know what that means. Especially with many other changes in management announced today. I'll be watching for that decent dip and see how the shareholders feel on Tuesday. Everyone have a safe and good July 4th weekend"
$2 upside for the next year. Is that right at $144?
"Every time there is a positive storyline about OLD BLUE the stock kicks another notch down, or as I like to call it The SEESAW SYNDROME."
OK Blue is's time to ROCK!
"As IBM Power Systems' provider of Infrastructure as a service (IaaS), Data Storage Corporation (DTST) would be a great acquisition for IBM. Looking forward to seeing this come to fruition."
"Up in the morning, down in the afternoon...wash, rinse, repeat."
"Why the ruse that the dividend is being raised to $1.64, when it has been that number since May 7, 2021"
Clearly stock market and investors are not impressed with plan to spin off the services unit. Either the new CEO needs to come up with other Shenanigans or BOD dismisses the current CEO and a new care taker CEO appointed then ceremonial BOD collectively resigns paving the way for new BOD election.
$200 in no time under new leadership.
Looks like selling into strength. Investors using brief pop to get out.
"DEBT Payment $6 Billion cash can be better used to grow expand IBM offerings in Data Analytics, AI, further cloud products.

Right now IBM is in a wishy-washy, serving other main tech players as 2nd, 3rd hand (Except Red Hat, even Red Hat is groeing slow at the heights of demand, Pendemic online cloud era).."
One day IBM will bust out of this range.
"Hey, whadaya know? Markets up AGAIN and IBM down AGAIN, after a bad day yesterday. Eight years later and still in the doldrums. Trying to move this stock is like pushing on a string."
$QCOM $VENA $IBM It's evident in the daily chart. Not in yet but will be ready
Don't let hedge funds to cover up cheaply... don't be sheep for a haircut...
why did this fizzle out..
"Who is down on IBM.? And if so, why? I am up 20% and collecting a dividend. Is that how it works or is there something that I am missing?"
IBM going to $300 in 24 months!
"IBM (NYSE:IBM) shares slide 2.6% after CNBC reports that president Jim Whitehurst is leaving the company.IBM has since confirmed the news in a statement and says Whitehurst will remain a senior adviser for the company.Whitehurst was named president last year, moving from his CEO role at Red Hat, which IBM acquired for $34B in 2019.Whitehurst is currently responsible for IBM's Cloud and Cognitive Software organizations and corporate strategy."
"IBM quarterly earnings have established a pattern. Revenue consistently down or flat. EPS up by a penny, significant charges for resource action, heavy on rhetorics: IBM positioned well to capture hybrid cloud worth 100 trillion dollars. making progress on strategic imperatives. It clearly shows company in crisis. CEO can not deliver results so resorts to slogans. When IBM was experiencing poor leadership under Akers board stepped in and made the naccassary leadership changes so IBM not only survive but also thrive. Current board feels no responsibility and actively managing demise of IBM. It is puzzling why IBM board is doing this. IBM company with its great employees, relationship with major companies, technology and a proud past has to come to this state. Look no further than IBM board to find the cause."
Does Big Blue bust out or fall back add to positions 400 stock
Look at valuation...or go buy Snowflake for a gamble. IBM will return to $150. PE of 23 and 5pct dividend. Buy and hold for the long term.
Wealth Destruction 101:Lesson 1 - Buy IBM stock.Lesson 2 - Hold long term.Lesson 3 - Buy more as price drops.
Bearish. IBM is not keeping up with $ACN $MSFT $AMZN. Billions in debt and losing money year over year. Look at 5 year chart and max chart. Head and shoulders pattern over its lifetime.
On continuous decline for last few months despite solid performance. Beginning to wonder if I should get out.
Love this stock
"For good investment, good signals and perfect skill, invest with Charlotte James, l believe that the should be no regrets in getting successful."
"IBM is and has been a loser for the past half dozen years. Maybe after the Kyndryl split from IBM, the residual value of IBM might cause a buy out from an Apple or Microsoft. One can only hope since this management can't seem to get the ball rolling despite all the acquisitions. partnerships, etc."
This thing should’ve been up eight to $10 today
"Ignore the haters. Bitcoin goes up...Bitcoin goes down. It's the way it is and always has been. Two years ago, people were bad-mouthing it when it dropped to 4000. A year ago, people were panicking when it dropped to 9000. Now people are losing their minds when it dropped to 30000. See a pattern here? That’s why it very good to have a professional who guides you on your trade and management your investments .. @Kanielnolasco12 does not encourage failure. Even if you do they compensate you. I was able to grow my coin from 2 BTC to 8 BTC with their strategies on the Telegram platform. He a highly recommended professional"
Total disgrace for our BOD and CEO.18 months ago Microsoft was $20 behind IBM share price - today $140 ahead.
Two years to get back before Buffett’s dump $164
"This is yet another example of how the professionals manipulate the market and the retail investors. Almost as bad as the Micron example. Micron beat on every metric Huge cash, strong balance sheet, and raised future guidance for both EPS and Revenue......and the stock fell from $84 to $74. Lots of these examples in this rigged market."
"Oh the pain Will Robinson, the pain!"
"Down 4% for the month of July. But growth ""is just around the corner!"""
It's overbought and too expensive.Check historical P/E + revenue decline. I am back in at 115USD.
$IBM $VENA $QS we prove our mettle. Act as one. Make your contribution
$IBM $AMD $WIMI we're setting up for upcoming days. There will be a run!!!
"Get out of all of this stuff Thursday after lunch, because the jobs numbers for June are going to come in hot on Friday, which will fuel the fans of inflation sending all these high flyers plummeting. If you are not a trader, but in it for the long haul you can probably stay in."
Dead money for the foreseeable future.
big blue doing it again. still holding 9999 since 1996. I love dividends!
"Gravity is going to be expensive for both IBM and KYNDRYL.... the ""gravity"" to recover what you have lost, what has been cut off (divested) it will pull and pull at you to rebuy the lawnmower, and furniture, and real-estate, and accountants, and lawyers, and friends.. yes, yes yes, for one (or both) they will be rid of the ""hated spouse"" and there will be some ""value"" there ....and one of them will take their belongings off to live in a new apartment - and the other will stay in the big expensive house. -the intrinsic costs for both of them will increase in some places due to lost synergy, but yes spousal stupidity spending may go down a bit. But for both parties functions will be lost, and both companies will have to buy/recover/build back what they have lost.... one, or the other, or both, (or neither) may be successful long term ..... But one thing is for sure!! both companies probably NEED EACH OTHER more than they can understand thru all the internal vitriol. So on those points, as we will hold shares in BOTH companies (magically) in a couple months.... There may be some quick SP gains simply based on emotions on being rid of the ""dead weight"" - but when the rubber meets the road both of these companies will suffer the loss of their partner and suffer the huge expenses of getting their feet back under them... (layoffs, loss of contracts and services to the other half, etc.) Trust me, they say they will play nice in front of the judge - but one minute after leaving the court they are both trying to subvert the kids into being the best parent and telling lies about the other half. if you are long long term here you may wish to LOOK AWAY for awhile... and for those playing for short term gains you may get trapped. - for awhile I believe ""shorts"" may take control... be cautious - no matter what. BOTH companies are still bred of the legacy parent (IBM) ...and that has not been all that great for a DECADE NOW!!! ugh - and yes I have been holding a large chunk for several decades... (feel free to call me a maroon, I probably deserve it) But I am not sitting on my hands here anymore - I will watch both companies very close, and seek exits FOR BOTH as I now believe the next decade for this divorced and angry set of ""me-too"" companies will be no better then the last decade - AND THE DIVY is not likely to continue for one or both, given restructuring costs and a readily available ""excuse"" for canceling it....... Kyndryl will probably be the one to cancel it -as they never had one in the first place (wink wink) and IBM will definitely not carry the current whole divy on its own. - For both, it is super easy here to point fingers at each other when the child support does not get paid. and when the news the cumulative Divy is reduced -- Its going to be like lemmings on a sinking ship for the investors who have held IBM specifically for the dividend ratio.. (stupidly punching myself right now) ....good luck!!! - if nothing else, this is going to be fantastically entertaining."
when is splitting the company scheduled to happen now? only 4 and half to the end of year!!
Posted earlier about the virtues of ibm and to my surprised people asked me to explain why ibm didA game over to the chip industry with its 2nm chip design ? So here is your answer thenTo get to 2nm you need specific breakthroughs in material Engeneering This breakthroughs are static and specific one patents what it has and that it is Now smaller is not possible because of phisiscs In the electronic world smaller becomes fuzzy meaning erratic and thus useless computationally to creat latches What is a latch a latch is a I/o switch a collection. Of this make bits and bits and and the logic needed for computation. Mesmore aggressions and hexadecimal all in all the array of single all to compute See the 2nm chips is the last station on the electronic race till. Is it with neat is available quantum is not here yet It is stil too fuzzy to be useful soo what we have is now ibm The second part of the question was Usefulness Well if you know microcomputer architecture which I may be one of the few who does Aside from ibm ers2nm chips need les power to open and close circuits and they also dissipate heat faster And because they are tiny they are much faster at computing Sooo what can come out of it Easy super fast computing Like super super fast If you care to know exactly there is a formula arrive. That will calculate the number of computations per second But it will be in the millions That is enough to give the advantage to all users of ibm chips That means Absolutely necessary appreciations such as defenseIt will improve research of all kinds including bio technologiesFarming Agriculture Financial markets will be unable to operate well with anything slower Generally a fast chip fuels massive technological break through that depend on computational speedThis is how important is this advancement Clear now IBM will start running now as we NPV future revenue And future revenue in this instance is not derive from elective consumption IBM tech consumption is a must in the competitive landscape of any army weapons manufacture business And research institution A must A new tool thatIs pure advantage on implementation
