Clearly stock market and investors are not impressed with plan to spin off the services unit. Either the new CEO needs to come up with other Shenanigans or BOD dismisses the current CEO and a new care taker CEO appointed then ceremonial BOD collectively resigns paving the way for new BOD election.
Keeping Ginney on the Board of Directors is a huge negative. She did nothing right for years. Get her out now!
"A good day for this stock is no longer when it's up, but when it's down less than 1%."
Outpacing the market again...to the down side! Will see 130s before 150s again.
IBM turned the corner and is now gaining momentum. Hybrid cloud is the only way to go imo for large organizations. Buy.
Amazon’s premarket slide is more than the entire market cap of IBM!!!
Correction - down $4 in 2 days. This thing is toast.
"Since IBM has become a utility stock, except with negative growth, what would be a good, actual utility stock to replace it with that has about the same yield? Verizon? ATT?"
"Down almost 1% in addition to drop from x-div. Stock has no strength whatsoever. But growth ""is just around the corner""."
140 now the resistance level after hitting 150 in June. Sad... Many smart investors leaving before the split. Heading for another $1 plus down day.
I'm always fascinated with the number of sheep to haircut on this stock...
"As IBM Power Systems' provider of Infrastructure as a service (IaaS), Data Storage Corporation (DTST) would be a great acquisition for IBM. Looking forward to seeing this come to fruition."
any reason for the 2% pop?
"Oh the pain Will Robinson, the pain!"
"On August 12, 1981 (40 years ago today) the IBM Personal Computer model 5150, (commonly known as the IBM PC) was released. It was created by a team of engineers and designers directed by Don Estridge in Boca Raton, Florida. It weighed 25lbs. and had a whopping 16 kilobytes of memory. Wow, times have changed. HAPPY ANNIVERSARY!"
"There was a woman on one of the business channels yesterday that said ibm can either choose to try and grow, or they can continue to pay the fat dividend, but they can’t do both. Just not enough free cash."
IBM market cap was $208B in 2001. Now after 20 years IBM market cap is $128B in 2021. Remarkable achievement for IBM BOD and CEOs. The story gets much worse taking into account money spent on IBM stock buybacks. At the same period market cap of other high-tech companies have soared to unprecedented levels. It is insult to think services spin off and hybrid could is going to address the problem. If IBM BOD and CEO were put in charge of Apple or Microsoft. They would run it to ground in a few short years just as they have done at IBM. Sadly this trend will continue for foreseeable future.
"IBM BOD has animosity toward shareholders, keeps picking nonperforming CEOs and leaves them on the job for many years for maximum damage."
"$IBM $WIMI $AMAT rumor has it, this sees 20s next week..."
"IBM is and has been a loser for the past half dozen years. Maybe after the Kyndryl split from IBM, the residual value of IBM might cause a buy out from an Apple or Microsoft. One can only hope since this management can't seem to get the ball rolling despite all the acquisitions. partnerships, etc."
"Another typical day of trading for BIG BLUES - up in the morning and steady sell-off in the afternoon. Wash, rinse, repeat..."
"Who is down on IBM.? And if so, why? I am up 20% and collecting a dividend. Is that how it works or is there something that I am missing?"
"Will IBM consulting arm gets the valuation multiple of ACCENTURE ? IBM bought PWC before. If so, windfall is coming."
"Up in the morning, down in the afternoon...wash, rinse, repeat."
when is the splitting business going to happen? only 4 months left in 2021!!
Going woke = Going broke
"Every time there is a positive storyline about OLD BLUE the stock kicks another notch down, or as I like to call it The SEESAW SYNDROME."
Why would anyone invest in IBM the last 10 years when you can buy MSFT which rules the world?
"Why the ruse that the dividend is being raised to $1.64, when it has been that number since May 7, 2021"
IBM is a good company just don't understand why this stock isn't up over $200!!!
IBM is MSFT 2.0
when is splitting the company scheduled to happen now? only 4 and half to the end of year!!
"Still breathing and on the right side of grass. Viewing the posts here I needed to check. The company expects revenue to return to growth and projects about $11 billion to $12 billion in adjusted free cash flow for the year and $12 billion to $13 billion in 2022.Apr 19, 2021"
Down over $3 in 2 days. Why?
Any idea why this stock crashing??
On continuous decline for last few months despite solid performance. Beginning to wonder if I should get out.
"Hey, whadaya know? Markets up AGAIN and IBM down AGAIN, after a bad day yesterday. Eight years later and still in the doldrums. Trying to move this stock is like pushing on a string."
It's overbought and too expensive.Check historical P/E + revenue decline. I am back in at 115USD.
Does anyone know if IBM will remain in the Dow Jones after the split into KYNDRYL at the end of this year?
"I've been googling to see what the bad news is on this stock that it would drop 15$ a share since it's June 10 high of 152.84... and I'm just not reading any really bad news... this is a great dividend stock, not sure what the issue is..."
