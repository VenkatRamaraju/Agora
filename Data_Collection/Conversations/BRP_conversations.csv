I called this one... company proved it's worth.
"Very shaky earnings, decent at best. Buying at this price simply isn't justified. Charts don't look good either, and it's getting awfully close to the world-renowned death cross. Stay off this stock for next couple quarters, at least until earnings catch up. Stock is going to be trading in the range of 23 - 29, frequently consolidating any gains."
