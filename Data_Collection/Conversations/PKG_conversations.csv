"Covered my PKG Short Sell at $144.60 for my 3rd consecutive losing trade. Moving on to a Short Sell of FEYE. If things work out the way I think they will, I could make back all the money I lost on these past three trades, on a huge drop of 10+% by FEYE tomorrow. We shall see just how right (or perhaps not) I am. :-)"
Looks like PKG beat earnings expectations. Not seeing anything yet on the wires.
Ty for the quadruple up $95 calls today
Is 3M buying GPK?GPK has strong earnings and a new target upgrade by Goldman.Why does not PKG buy GPK?
Why the drop? Earnings miss fear?
Great surge to end the day positive (and near the high of the day). We put in a very respectable kangaroo candlestick tail formation (bullish). Looks like FB and MSFT did pretty well on their earnings so we MAY have a positive day tomorrow!!

"Looks like Hurricane Irma is putting a skyrocket under the pants of PKG stock!! Stands to reason tens of thousands of new packaging will be needed due to flooding in both TX. and FL. More boxes needed for cleanup, sending new merchandise via truck, rail and airplane. Only way I can explain the rocket ship this stock has been on past several days."

"I'm kicking myself...: some of my best stocks have been just common sense picks that I've made myself. With amazons ridiculous success, I asked myself ""how can't a cardboard, or box maker be killing it""? I didn't pull the trigger at $65 a year ago, and today it cracked $100! I'm just sick to my stomach"

F.Y.I. This company has been acquired (purchased) by CBBT based in California. The sale should be complete by end of Dec 2020 according to the CEO of CBBT.Google that and you'll see!

"I started following ""awesomestokcalerts"" (Gooogle it - off course without any space or dash in between the words) and their notifications are better than anyone else."
"PKG looks like its starting a new leg downtown!! If we are lucky, its trying to put in a double bottom!! If things continue to degrade, we could easily see 80 bucks (unbelievable!!). Still have PLENTY of dry powder to buy more. This is an Excellent corporation, and will continue to do VERY WELL in this expanding economy!!!"
"Huge rally recently from 108 to 119, and now a tremendous cratering from 119 to 111 and change. Talk about a crazy, volatile, stock, on virtually no news!!!"
strong company?
"Just Sold Short PKG at $142.79. This is a Pure Earnings trade. PKG reports earnings in just a few minutes and I am expecting a weak and disappointing report to be followed by a significant drop in share price. Due to Covid as well as ongoing automation of office systems, the use of paper in office environments has been and will continue to decline. PKG derives significant revenue from paper sales. This lost revenue is currently not priced into the stock, nor is it properly factored in for future quarters. I expect today's ER to bring this issue to the forefront and it could easily result in a haircut of 5-12% in stock price occurring as early as tomorrow. A very attractive one day opportunity for the astute Pure Earnings trader. Good Luck!"

"We've had a 35% correction from top to the bottom yesterday!! Unless the entire market is going into a Big, Bad, Bear Market, I think the bottom is in Jim!!"
"Excellent Rally today with PKG and the overall Market. IWM, MID, $DJUSAG, SPY and DIA all rallying big time!! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqsT4xnKZPg"
Nice double bottom has formed on PKG chart!! Very Bullish Indeed!!
"PKG is having their Conference Call at 9:00 AM ET. Even though earnings were decent, stock is still overvalued and I am happy to be Short a lot of shares at $142.79. This could easily go down quite a bit today. Look at the pre-market, nobody wants to bid this up, the smart trader knows it is just not worth $143/share considering the fact that both consumer and business demand for paper of all types is on a steep and permanent decline. This is one of the many things I love about the Pure Earnings Short Sell game: There are so many ways to win. If a company misses earnings and/or revenue estimates, a dip in price is almost certain. But even if they beat on both, if you chose the right stock, one that is genuinely over-valued and faces headwinds going forward, you still can come out with a nice profit on your Short play. Good Luck!"
"Okay, just ate my own cooking and doubled down on good, old, reliable, high dividend, paying PKG!!! I've been waiting, and waiting, and WAITING to buy more (been trading this puppy with recent purchase of a few shares at 122 and change). I might be early here, but look at how LOW the RSI is (about 20 or so), with MACD lowest in over 4 years!!! I don't know, but unless we are going into a Bear Market today is the day to buy more!! (maybe)."
Packaging Corp of America is up 7.46% to 96.89
"With overall Market continuing to be weak here, and with a BIG gap that needs to be filled on the 2 year chart at 92, I'll wait for even lower prices to dollar cost average down!!"
I got a buy recommended from a paid stock newsletter
Obviously the Street doesn't like the revenue miss. They still beat on earnings!!!
"Who buys PKG, DS Smith or Smurfit Kappa"
Up 2.5% after market. Any good news?
"Got to say it again.......why would anyone want to own this stock? The 3rd quarter commentary is the same as the 2nd quarter which was the same as the 1st quarter commentary.1. We beat by one penny (adj) per share.2. Weather affected us3. We are still seeing price declines, or feeling their effects4. We still have inventory issues.5. Took excessive downtime for maintenance.6. We are running our machines efficiently to match market supply and demand.I guess you can take this write up and cut & paste it into the 4Q report. You're welcome."
Reason PKG went down: https://www.briefing.com/Investor/PopupPages/ArticlePopup.aspx?ArticleId=IN20170821120906PKG
Very good quarter!! They beat quarterly profits by .08 cents!!
PKG finally back above the 20 day moving average!! The only thing that can stop PKG now is a weakening economy and or a Bear Market!!

"VERY surprised there hasn't been ANY real buying today (considering how far this puppy has fallen from the recent 118 high AND the FACT it has filled the gap around 92 and change). I guess its just overshooting now. Holding TOUGH, hanging TIGHT with good, old, dependable, high dividend paying, PKG!!!"
"you only make boxes out of brown paper. if folks are not purchasing stuff, there is no need for boxes. so, just look at UPS and FEDeX. if folks are not purchasing stuff, then there is no need to transport the stuff. brown paper is the first into a recession and the last out. I should know, been in the paper industry for 50 years+. so hang on to your cash."
"All paper stocks down sharply, any clues?"
"PKG is going to be my next Pure Earnings Short Sell play. Gonna sell ACI for a loss within the next two hours, probably just before market close, and then immediately Short PKG with a lot of $$, ahead of her earnings release which happens after market close. PKG is grossly overvalued and should deliver a weak and disappointing earnings release that should result in a 5-12% price haircut tomorrow. To be a great trader you must understand human psychology. The overvaluation of PKG is two-fold: First it is based upon the Irrational Exuberance of the stock market as a whole, but second, it is compounded by the fact that traders love to adopt a ""glass half full"" attitude towards company facts. The facts on PKG are that the company is dependent upon TWO distinct revenue sources: 1) Sales of packaging material. 2) Sales of paper. And, while sales of packaging material should be quite healthy, sales of paper have been and will continue to be in decline. But traders continue to focus on the former and not on the latter, resulting in an unsustainable price bubble that should burst with today's earnings release numbers. While there are several nice looking Pure Earnings Short Sell plays for today, PKG stands out to me as the MOST likely to sell off, and the most likely to see a decline of at least 5% and very possibly 10+% in price from her current $143 level. Good Luck!"

"I have no idea WHY PKG is selling off so VICIOUSLY this morning considering they handily beat on both revenues and earnings. Could be a Sell the News scenario!! Well, that being said, I rebought the stock in the mid 121s a few seconds ago. With firms having tons of trouble getting trucks to make deliveries as reported several days ago in Wall Street journal, indicating a BOOMING economy, PKG should continue to do VERY WELL going forward!!!"
"Well, we've had a 32% correction from the all time high (Bear Market in this stock). Love to see it get above 90 bucks by end of day or at least by Friday. I'll take any kind of rally at this point."
What is the reason for today's drop??
"Be early get into $PKG.CN do your DD they're going to be huge, even have a deal with amazon"
"Any reason for massive drop today?? I'm not seeing ANY news. I know they went X-div. on Friday, and yes we have a large Market drop again today!!"

WOW......you could take my post from 3 months ago and cut and paste it here.

"Someone has to explain: how Nine Dragons is going to make any money on these 2 mill investments? They are located in the middle of nowhere with transport costs near historical highs, they use virgin pulp instead of OCC and competitors are using mixed paper which has a negative cost at the moment. Also, is ND using the mills to export pulp to China for finishing or are they completely entering a new market with no scale or competitive advantage? I think this is an insane move by a very irrational player and the US containerboard market is in for long term price competition."

"Considered buying back into PKG yesterday, but with such an OVERBOUGHT market decided just to watch the stock and wait for a nice pullback. Unfortunately positive story on PKG on Yahoo news has propelled PKG to new highs. Got back in with a few shares a few minutes ago. With such a fantastic X-mas season in play, how could PKG not do well??"
"I got a Bid in to Cover my PKG Short at $133.51. Not expecting it to fill, but right now in the PM, 9:17 ET, nobody wants to pay anything more for this. So, I give it a shot and lets see what happens... :-)"
PKG is down 5.03% to $96.28
When will they start with a dividend? That would be big.
PKG is down 6.61% to 98.00
"Okay, finally have the news that's fit to Print: PKG beats earnings estimates by 2 cents, and barely falls short of revenues. That's four quarters in a row where they beat earnings!! Great job PKG!!!"
"Here's the reason its down today: PKG analysts on Estimize are expecting 5.81% YoY revenue growth for Q4, down from 10.51% in Q3 [Reporting 01/29 AMC]"
"I don't own this stock. Thank God because that earnings report was ""uninspiring"". Let me count the ways;Earnings were 1 penny above expectationsRevenue is flatRan the machines to match demandLarge increase in inventory YoY (42,000)20+ % sales drop YoYNext quarter EPS is estimated at 7 more pennies a share (3% earnings growth)Same old boiler plate commentary........we ran our operations well, the weather hurt us, we matched supply and demand, a price decrease was announced (because we have no discipline or leverage in the market). We are excited about our future. Blah.....blah....blah, I'll stay with the growth stocks."

"Westrock also down 8%Can't find any news. Guessing, someone in the sector released an earnings warning???"
BMO capital cuts rating on PKG to Market perform!! This after the stock has CRATERED from 118 and change recently!!
"PKG held up EXTREMELY Well during today's Ground hog day Massacre. If it goes down 5 or 6 points next week, I'm buying MORE."
"Okay, here's the reason for the hit today (forward guidance ratcheted downtown):We expect continued inflation in most of our operating costs, including slightly higher recycled fiber prices and incremental wage pressure with a tighter labor market. In addition, we anticipate higher freight and logistics expenses, higher scheduled maintenance outage costs, as well as a slightly higher tax rate. Considering these items, we expect third quarter earnings of $2.14 per share [vs $2.24 estimate]"
"I don't understand why all the paper stocks are down today, but I do know Nine Dragons announced yesterday they're investing 187 Million USD into converting their newest acquisition over to corrugated medium. This will now be a direct competitor only 1.5 hours away from PCA's Wisconsin, USA mill."
"Rick, were you a buyer today?? Give me something!!"
PKG beats on both revenues and earnings yet the stock is collapsing!! Reminds me of what happened to 3M a few days ago!!
Anyone get in at the 8% drop?
PKg is taking a rest. It will come back with a vengeance soon. Then all heck breaks out.

"For anyone else that’s interested, I bought into $PKG around the same time as $DOC. It had a nice 73% run yesterday and just turned profitable in October. Obviously, do your own DD. Chances are they will be announcing a profitable November next week too."
Damn the ceo paying himself an extra million this year on top of 10 mil hahhaha
anyone know PKG Client list?
"PKG looks like a really good buy. However, one thing bothers me-""7% of our total sales and 47% of paper segment sales revenue comes from OFFICE DEPOT."" Well, it's pretty obvious OD will not be around much longer, it's in a nosedive. It would seem they would not wait for this to happen to find a new customer."

"Holy Toledo, PKG is getting sheared AGAIN today, down almost 3%!!! Last thing I expected with a booming economy and booming package business!!! Love to buy more, but more downside likely ahead with overall Market really just beginning to roll over. I don't think earnings are going to save us this time...."
PKG has just seen the last of the selling. Looks like a potential push higher with a dividend value of 2.52. lionstackAl(erts allerted a new stock just now. going to check it out.
"Now this crazy, very volatile stock has collapsed to 107 and change. Very surprising with a booming economy they aren't at all time highs."
"Nobody is on this board but ME! Anyway......if you are here see my post from below , 3 month ago. Cut and paste it here and do the same for the next 20 quarters. This whole industry needs a shake up. ZERO pricing discipline, same for controlling the supply/demand balance (at higher prices)."
"Looks pretty decent at first glance, but the stock is over-valued and I am happy to be Short and to experience the full market reaction to these earnings tomorrow. I still expect a share price drop in response to these numbers.

We also expect export prices to move higher. In our Paper segment, we expect volumes to be fairly flat with higher average prices and mix as we continue the roll-out of our recently announced paper price increases."""
