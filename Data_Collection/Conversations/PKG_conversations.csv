"Got to say it again.......why would anyone want to own this stock? The 3rd quarter commentary is the same as the 2nd quarter which was the same as the 1st quarter commentary.1. We beat by one penny (adj) per share.2. Weather affected us3. We are still seeing price declines, or feeling their effects4. We still have inventory issues.5. Took excessive downtime for maintenance.6. We are running our machines efficiently to match market supply and demand.I guess you can take this write up and cut & paste it into the 4Q report. You're welcome."
PKG finally back above the 20 day moving average!! The only thing that can stop PKG now is a weakening economy and or a Bear Market!!
Looks like PKG beat earnings expectations. Not seeing anything yet on the wires.
"I have no idea WHY PKG is selling off so VICIOUSLY this morning considering they handily beat on both revenues and earnings. Could be a Sell the News scenario!! Well, that being said, I rebought the stock in the mid 121s a few seconds ago. With firms having tons of trouble getting trucks to make deliveries as reported several days ago in Wall Street journal, indicating a BOOMING economy, PKG should continue to do VERY WELL going forward!!!"
"Just Sold Short PKG at $142.79. This is a Pure Earnings trade. PKG reports earnings in just a few minutes and I am expecting a weak and disappointing report to be followed by a significant drop in share price. Due to Covid as well as ongoing automation of office systems, the use of paper in office environments has been and will continue to decline. PKG derives significant revenue from paper sales. This lost revenue is currently not priced into the stock, nor is it properly factored in for future quarters. I expect today's ER to bring this issue to the forefront and it could easily result in a haircut of 5-12% in stock price occurring as early as tomorrow. A very attractive one day opportunity for the astute Pure Earnings trader. Good Luck!"
F.Y.I. This company has been acquired (purchased) by CBBT based in California. The sale should be complete by end of Dec 2020 according to the CEO of CBBT.Google that and you'll see!
"PKG looks like a really good buy. However, one thing bothers me-""7% of our total sales and 47% of paper segment sales revenue comes from OFFICE DEPOT."" Well, it's pretty obvious OD will not be around much longer, it's in a nosedive. It would seem they would not wait for this to happen to find a new customer."
Amazon?
anyone know PKG Client list?
"Well, we've had a 32% correction from the all time high (Bear Market in this stock). Love to see it get above 90 bucks by end of day or at least by Friday. I'll take any kind of rally at this point."
"$PKG.C chart looks prime, the volume is insane, It's ready for taking off."
Obviously the Street doesn't like the revenue miss. They still beat on earnings!!!
"PKG looks like its starting a new leg downtown!! If we are lucky, its trying to put in a double bottom!! If things continue to degrade, we could easily see 80 bucks (unbelievable!!). Still have PLENTY of dry powder to buy more. This is an Excellent corporation, and will continue to do VERY WELL in this expanding economy!!!"
"Holy Toledo, PKG is getting sheared AGAIN today, down almost 3%!!! Last thing I expected with a booming economy and booming package business!!! Love to buy more, but more downside likely ahead with overall Market really just beginning to roll over. I don't think earnings are going to save us this time...."
"Love the HUGE rally today in good, old, All American, PKG!!! Bout time we had a Spectacular Rally!!! Halleyluyah!!"
"Rick, were you a buyer today?? Give me something!!"
"For anyone else thatâ€™s interested, I bought into $PKG around the same time as $DOC. It had a nice 73% run yesterday and just turned profitable in October. Obviously, do your own DD. Chances are they will be announcing a profitable November next week too."
"Okay, finally have the news that's fit to Print: PKG beats earnings estimates by 2 cents, and barely falls short of revenues. That's four quarters in a row where they beat earnings!! Great job PKG!!!"
"Any reason for massive drop today?? I'm not seeing ANY news. I know they went X-div. on Friday, and yes we have a large Market drop again today!!"
"WTH! Omg, I almost bought this a week ago. whew, this is not good. Westrock too."
