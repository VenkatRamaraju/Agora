"This company is undervalued. And it has a decent earnings growth rate. Trailing twelve month PE under 15, EV/EBITDA 10.73, free cash flow yield 8.01%. The recent selloff looks like a buying opportunity to me. It is oversold on the RSI currently. I am going to be taking a position here."

"New CEO Mr. Singh's first quarterly earning: Not so good. GAAP income low. (It is much easier to manipulate the ""adjusted non-GAAP income"" to meet analysts' consensus). More importantly, guidance on 2020 revenue and EPS are both lower than analysts' consensus. I guess the stock won't be back at $100+ for the next few months."

"Hi-ho, Kermit the Frog here! Alberta got its wish for the inclusion of support for large-scale, industrial carbon capture in the federal budget.The federal budget documents released Monday include plans for an investment tax credit for carbon capture utilization and storage (CCUS) projects. The technology – which forces carbon-dioxide emissions deep into the ground, keeping them out of the atmosphere – could play a major role in lowering outputs at refineries, cement and fertilizer production plants and power stations across the country. Significantly, it could also help to reduce emissions at Alberta oil sands operations.Details of the investment tax credit have yet to be fleshed out. Ottawa says it will move quickly to a 90-day consultation period on the design of the credit, after which it will announce more details, including the rate of the incentive.$SU $ENB $IMO $CNQ $TRP $PKI $PPL $"

"SHOULD recover fast CFRA KEEPS BUY OPINION ON SHARES OF PERKIN ELMER, INC.7:37 am ET February 3, 2021 (CFRA) PrintWe keep our 12-month target price at $171, 23.9x our 2022 EPS estimate, above PKI's historical forward P/E average. This is justified by improved growth prospects and solid Covid-19 tailwinds. We lift our 2021 EPS estimate by $0.29 to $8.93 as we raise our Q1 EPS estimate to $3.02. We keep our 2022 estimate at $7.16. Q4 EPS of $3.96 vs. $1.35 was a $0.95 robust consensus beat and $1.11 above our estimate. PKI recorded an impressive Q4 top-line revenue of $1.4B (+68% year-over-year), $136M above consensus and $169M above our estimate. Covid-19-related products and solutions contributed $549M in additional revenue (41% of total sales), with PCR tests and extraction solutions generating more than half ($300M). Diagnostics segment revenues (63% of total) recorded an eye-catching 172% organic growth due to record sales in immunodiagnostics and applied genomics. This more than offset the 2% organic decline in Discovery & Analytics segment sales (37% of total) due to continued softness in food and applied markets."
