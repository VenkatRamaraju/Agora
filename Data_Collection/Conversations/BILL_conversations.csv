Just added more shares.
"Not sure why a company that will do maybe $300mil this year is worth $7bil ($90 a share)? This puppy is out of control, short back to $65, or even lower."
"The senior notes offering is only covetable to stocks in 2027,6 years from now! No change in share number before then."

bubble
A BIG PLAY MAY BE IN THE WORKS BY BILL?? They are raising $1 billion in equity and $500 million in convertible..WHAT ARE THEY STAULKING? COULD IT BE THE IPO OF AVDX? A MAJOR OVERSEAS BILL PAYMENTS COMPANY? SOMETHING IS IN THE WORKS????
Bill.com is up 17.59% to 153.25

"Bill has been a top performer and is on such a great run, but I'm going to take some off the table before Thursday's earnings."
bill is oversold. No news.
I want to see 300+. I hold so many calls from 250-280-300.
I see calls to $300. That's too much bullishness. Still will see. I don't own or short any position. Will watch the run.

look for it to close below $250
Bill.com reached an all time high at 133.50
This will go down to the 80's within a few months- mark my words. There is nothing fundamentally strong about this stock to warrant such a high P/S especially in this market.
this thing keeps going up big guys are buying for the future gold mine. have to buy some.
"Don’t be bag holders, WORST BUY, been pumped to death!"
This is one of the Best SaaS companies around the globe. Just expensive for sure.
Who’s buying at these prices?
"While the reddits are patting themselves on the back for sticking it to the man, the man is sticking it to the rest of the market. Yeah, while the reddits are taking a few $bill out of the man on 10 stocks, the man is taking 4% out of all the other stocks worth $trillions."
Buy at $160
How this company ever got to this price is amazing. Fundamentality this company has more in common with ENRON !
$200 is the floor now
I am raising target from $320 to 340
"The monster stock, the cheating banker."
Does BMTX not the same solution like $BILL ?

can't seem to post any info on the acquisition of inoice2go
told you an offering will be out
"@Frank: Your so call bullseye was Rubraca. Pat Mahaffy should have sold the company when it was valued at $4-5 bil in 2017. If he had done that, then I will bow to him. I would call that an almost perfect performance for a CEO(a slight blemish on the Rociletinib affair). But he didn't. For whatever reason, he got greedy. He didn't think through the strategy needed to compete with big pharma on a me-too product. One of my biggest questions was if his strategy was to go-it-alone all along, then why didn't he raise a $bill or more when the stock price was high($50-90). Even in early 2019, our stock price was trading between the $25-30 range. It is certainly better to raise in the $25-30 range, then raise in $5,7,8, etc. Why? When you implement a go-it-alone strategy, you normally will do a Pro-forma forecast of at least 5 years and maintain at least 4-5 years of financial reserves. This is the reason why I am having a problem with their modeling/forecasting. Keep all this in mind that a typical phase 3 trial will take 4 years to see the result."
Maybe eyeing new acquisition.
Insiders with 3 million shares (?) become eligible to sell their shares next week as company makes three (3) presentations at institutional investor conferences between June 3 and June 11. Look for a pullback on some larger volume? buying opportunity if we get under $55???
"I have a small stake until I find out more but I can see many companies flocking to this if they have a sound business model and seamless transactions with their system. I can smell the downsizing of Accounting Depts everywhere, cutting employee related expenses. Saving the business overhead. We'll see."
Anyone know the lock up period?
what makes this stock price go up so quickly since IPO?

What’s up with this thing?
Bought at 132 Wednesday based on the beautiful macd crossover. boy did that pay off
First time buyer today at $138.60. I have been watching this one for a while. Happy to have to a dip.
I love this company but do not understand why Intuit is not their big competitor. Why can't this be a product that is part of QuickBooks?
Nobody even talks bout this stock!
"200 M revenue, 7 B market?"
Buy the dip
$WIMI $FB $BILl Nice build up of slow momentum
"I thought it was a good call. Calvert is extremely optimistic and I believe that most of these potential ""opportunities"" will come to fruition. None of these projects happen overnight. I've been patiently accumulating a nice position since .12c and will continue to add more. ""IF"" they can deliver over the next few quarters/ year or 2, this could easily be a couple $bill market cap...Strictly my opinion!"
Do history homework on BILL. Gap never been unfilled. Not only BILL will fill the gap at $220 it will go lower possible below $200 in a month.
lol.
Best investment i have ever had in my portfolio
BILL reached an all time high at 57.01
$310 all time high tomorrow
"Holding since 38, will sell at 300 in April."
Doubt it very much
"Price/sales at 52.15 is rather high. When the market is down, this kind of stocks drops fast."
"When it dips a little towards $303 Buy ittt, always buy the dip after you sell"
Three hundreds is coming so soon. I see no resistance until $320 !!
Another offering tonight
the drop will continue
"Total revenue was $78.3 million, an increase of 86% from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. Guidance Total revenue (millions) - $476.0 - $480.0 vs $310 - $320Mgrowth through acquisition and this doesn't even include the inoice2go...."
Guy's check it out.PAYO! Lots of opportunity make a more money PAYO!
"Great company doing a LOT of business and a lot of customers!Some problems that could EASILY ADD to a LOT of MANIPULATION and I think the odds are good that manipulation can happen!!!1) going to goldman presentation next week, I think this WILL turn out VERY GOOD, NOW the problem; Goldman AND other investment banks MIGHT ALL want MORE shares; At this point (today) there are ONLY 31 million shares in the FLOAT(available for trading) that is VERY SMALL and DOES CAUSE BIGGER spreads in trades (watch the BID/Asks on your level 2. Bill COULD CREATE MORE SHARES for GOLDMAN and the other investment firms. This odds are GOOD this would TEMPORARILY push the PRICE down AND we WON'T KNOW what PRICE BILL will give the shares to the BIG banks( hopefully NOT too low)!! This WILL also ADD dilution to EPS!! BILL could overcome this dilution with better than expected earnings! The FLOAT being only 31 MIL. they COULD create at least 10 to 15mill MORE and Goldman would now have the MARKET making power in shares! So, adding 15mil shares to the 31mil, no46 mil shares is still small, but ALMOST 50% more than they had--- NOW the EARNINGS better be good!!2) the TOTAL # of shares outstanding is NOW 72mil-- so- 72 minus 31=41 mil for the insiders and the treasury---- The insiders will NOT give up their shares to add to the float, this 41mil is small but still WIDE ! What WILL be interesting AFTER the conference; A) how many shares are the big banks going to get? B) How are the insiders going to get compensated for GIVING the big banks shares that ARE going to EFFECT --- the EPS. ---- what PRICE are we going to END up with AFTER the conference!!3) lastly --- KEEP A CLOSE eye on this--- the LOCK UP expiration for BILL is on -- 6/09/2020! make a NOTE of this -- insiders CAN AND WILL dump shares if this goes UP between now and 6/09!!! It will cause shares to go down. also THE NEXT earnings is -- MAY 7th -- mark your calendar and make SURE you are aware of 1) how the stock reacts after the conference 2) try to find out if shares are created to get a bigger FLOAT( share ALL given to the banks to sell and create and be market makers! 3)watch the NEXT EARNINGS - May 7th 4) lock up expires 6/09/2020!"
Bill.com is up 7.35% to 140.35
$BIGC when you will compare $BIGC with $BILL you will understand how undervalued this company is.
I hope Relief sues for $bill in damages…that should calm JJ’s appetite…
I want to see $300 resistance be passed to $340.
Bought At $29 glad I did not react to the shorts on this board. Stay off this board and you will do fine with BILL.
"This is a buy at $100. Most SMBs will transition to paperless transactions not just because of the environment and lower costs, but because it's actually faster and more accurate."
How is this name not the best short on the board? Great company.......horribly expensive.Secondary offering coming next week from Divvy longs. Mark my word.
Back to where it started. See you $255 tomorrow.
"This stock is wildly overvalued, even at a generous 20x sales (!!) this stock would only be worth $3bil. Valuation should be cut in half."
how was earnings?
Been here since the drop in March 2020 after seeing it spike after its IPO. Sold my original investment a while back and just riding up on house money. Only regret is I didn’t invest more (says everyone with a big winner) but honestly never guessed it would do this well. Go BILL!!!!!
Be realist. Stock went 29% on top of over bought area. BILL will give back at least half. Look at the history. Every time stock pops after earnings it will go back to where it started. I am looking at 250 to 255 in short term.
Bill management team did a superb job at today’s Credit Suisse virtual technology conference. Available at Bill’s investor relations section on website. Must see ...
This will come back down to earth. Ill buy in then.
I sold. But going to follow for awhile and trying to buy after adjustments. $65

"Why? When I can buy ""FOUR"" or ""ZI"" both of which can and will double any trading day soon."
Anyone here from below $40? Been in since $39.90 at the end of last March when most all stocks were down big. Only purchased 65 shares then and really wish I would have purchased more then and more along the way up. 362% gain for me thus far so this is definitely a quite winner that no one really knows about. Over 92% owned by institutions!!!
"The stock market is there to serve you, not to instruct you. Warren Buffett. Remember that. I look forward to great earnings results, but market forces are at play, and think long term--would you own this company if you could never sell it? Many minor players manipulate price for their own purposes, but is Micron a great business? Is it a low cost producer? Does it have a competitive moat? Is it working every day to improve it's operations, its product, its capital structure? Is it partnering with businesses and governments to make it more profitable and more effective? Think deeply on those questions, and you will have your answer. GLTA $Bill"
Lockup releasing next month. Be careful
"guy you better take your profits ,look for big insiders selling"
The drop has started
I like it at $175. Will wait till then

Nice company - but is there a stock out there with higher p/s? I think this one is the most inflated (one of the two or three most inflated) - in the most inflated market possible. Insane…
Never seen a company cheat the market so badly
Great earnings!
They do small and mid size business. not a good mkt this days
Not sustainable
How do you find these stocks so early? Feels like I am always late to the party X_X
Bring on that stock offering!

Turning bullish
"Accountimg Firms CAN perform the same service BUT at a higher cost to the company. Accounting Firms will soon be downsized across the board in corporate america, cutting overhead by eliminating labor expenses: wages and benefits. The same as data entry, customer service and even some warehouse jobs. A.I. and BOTS are soon to eliminate alot of jobs. I will be watching this and a few other A.I./BOT based companies. I see nice potential here...real nice potential."
