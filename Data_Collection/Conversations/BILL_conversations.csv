Buy the dip
$250 tomorrow!
Long term buy....
what makes this stock price go up so quickly since IPO?
Not sustainable
Bill.com reached an all time high at 312.99
I hope Relief sues for $bill in damages…that should calm JJ’s appetite…
Just added more shares.
Wow it hit 300 during afterhours.... ITS NOT LIKE THE MARKET IS CLOSED RIGHT???????????
Bought At $29 glad I did not react to the shorts on this board. Stay off this board and you will do fine with BILL.
Maybe eyeing new acquisition.
it trades like there is no competition for their service
"The senior notes offering is only covetable to stocks in 2027,6 years from now! No change in share number before then."
Anyone see a problem with this trading at 120x sales?
$300 today
I want to see 300+. I hold so many calls from 250-280-300.
"CEO, CFO, COO all sell some their stocks at good price, nice job."
when they misee earning next q this wil drop hard mark my words
"The monster stock, the cheating banker."
"Financial Highlights for the Fourth Quarter of Fiscal 2021, as reported, including Divvy unlessotherwise indicated:● Total revenue was $78.3 million●Transaction fees were $46.3 million,So 46.3m/78.3m = 60% of the total revenue is from transactions fees and the transaction fee increased 204% year-over-year.That speaks volume about the main driver of BILL growth is transaction fees and it's growing insanely fast."
How is this name not the best short on the board? Great company.......horribly expensive.Secondary offering coming next week from Divvy longs. Mark my word.
$310 all time high tomorrow
Buy before it hits $340 !!
can't seem to post any info on the acquisition of inoice2go
"When it dips a little towards $303 Buy ittt, always buy the dip after you sell"
told you an offering will be out
Should have shorted 299
"The market is looking forward to the earning next month! Company guided a 32% sequential growth! If there's sandbagging, the actual result will be more than 32%!"
Insiders cannot get out quick enough. See SEC Form 4 for BILL.https://www.secform4.com/insider-trading/1786352.htm
The drop has started
the drop will continue
Nobody even talks bout this stock!
$310 all time high today
Been here since the drop in March 2020 after seeing it spike after its IPO. Sold my original investment a while back and just riding up on house money. Only regret is I didn’t invest more (says everyone with a big winner) but honestly never guessed it would do this well. Go BILL!!!!!
I started trading crypto with Andrew few month ago and it has been a blessing to me and my family after I made a lot of Successful withdrawals. You all can reach out to Andrew Telegr*am* @tradelikeandrew
what people think about this company? Bill
A BIG PLAY MAY BE IN THE WORKS BY BILL?? They are raising $1 billion in equity and $500 million in convertible..WHAT ARE THEY STAULKING? COULD IT BE THE IPO OF AVDX? A MAJOR OVERSEAS BILL PAYMENTS COMPANY? SOMETHING IS IN THE WORKS????
"Target on the gap next week, then go beyond 320 in Q4"
Never seen a company cheat the market so badly
"Total revenue was $78.3 million, an increase of 86% from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. Guidance Total revenue (millions) - $476.0 - $480.0 vs $310 - $320Mgrowth through acquisition and this doesn't even include the inoice2go...."
