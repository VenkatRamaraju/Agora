why is this down so much
Bring back what I learned in ECON class....after a downturn typically infrastructure spending increases. I wouldn't expect anything different this year. Add $VMC $MLM $CAT $DE to my watchlist. They will benefit if this becomes reality.
Expecting this to come down as no infrastructure bill will materialize. No way the democrats pass a bill that looks like a win for Trump
"Looking at the chart, next pause looks to be at $76/share. Then we pause again at $31 while on our way to still further lower prices. Keep in mind, we were at $31 only as far back as 2011. Seems like an unrealistic projection while looking at a stock price of $100, but the Fed can only prop up stocks for so long. And the Fed’s easy money IS the only thing keeping this stock from collapsing. We are so far afield from fundamentals here, it is a joke. There is no yardstick out there that even comes close to justifying a $100 per share stock price today or at any date for the foreseeable future."

"Here’s what the company said at the end of 2019:“OutlookRegarding the Company's outlook, Mr. Hill stated, ‘In 2020, we expect another year of strong earnings growth. Vulcan-served markets should continue to benefit from public construction demand, led by higher levels of highway funding in our key states. We anticipate residential construction in our markets to continue strengthening after experiencing some softness in certain markets during the second half of 2019. Private nonresidential construction activity should also improve as leading indicators point to positive growth in 2020. Demand fundamentals, including population and employment growth, continue to support longer-term growth in residential and nonresidential construction. We are seeing a positive pricing environment driven by shipment momentum in private demand and visibility of public demand. Our focus remains the same – compounding our unit margins through all parts of the cycle and improving our returns on capital.’”Every single one of their categories for projected growth is going to drop off."

Started a relatively small position in VMC today. I have a feeling we are going to get some kind of infrastructure bill passed down from the government to stimulate the economy when we eventually come out of this pandemic. It'll probably be rough seas for a while though.

"The housing and construction industries are going to grind to a halt. There are are going to be many less buyers with the banks demanding 20% down and credit scores > 700. Further, who’d buy a house when the markets are in turmoil, when trillions of printed dollars are needed to prop it up, and when millions are losing their jobs. In addition, government revenues are shrinking — so highway construction etc will drop dramatically. Not looking good for ol’ VMC."

Looks like we will double from here. Beat earnings and forecast double digit growth in 2019. That's without an infrastructure bill. Breakout today and new 52 week highs. So glad I bought a few weeks ago charts showed accumulation. Also no pumping of these infrastructure stocks yet. Market makers are likely still accumulating for a big run. I expect the biggest and bestest infrastructure bill ever.
So why is down?

"I’m telling you, when people are unemployed, they ain’t driving. Nor are they renting. Just ask Hertz. Gas tax revenues are plummeting, which means no $$ for road construction. The Feds can’t supply a couple trillion. The deficit this year alone I’d approaching $10 trillion. That’s almost half of all the debt for the first 231 years of this nation!Next year they’ll need a deficit of $20 trillion to avoid a deflationary collapse. They do that, they’ll get hyperinflation because of excessive spending. And if they don’t do it, they’ll get it because the economy will go into a deflationary crash, making the debt unserviceable. Either way, we are facked."

We will continue to closely monitor trends in construction activity and work with our customers to meet their needs in this challenging operating environment. We will provide updates as more information becomes available and our visibility improves.”In other words, things are looking so bad we can’t determine the extent to which we will even have any earnings or how much our losses will be; nor can we predict the amount of downsizing may be necessary to keep the ship afloat. We will tell you what we project something at some undetermined date in the future. If the stock price"

"Roads are mainly paid for by gasoline tax revenue. These revenues will be way down for two reasons: (1) the tax is a percentage of pride, and prices are way way down, in case you have not noticed; and (2) far fewer persons are driving."

"VMC will undeniably be caught-up in the investigation of Chao and potential conflicts of interest - benefits the company received based on that relationship. This isn't simply about Chao's investment in VMC. She was a member of the Board and as Transportation Sec received deferred stock units while at the same time being in a position to direct federal contracts to VMC. Just this week the House Oversight Committee issued a statement and request for information specific to Chao's relationship with VMC and associated federal contracts. Doesn't appear that the significant regulatory and litigation risks are presently baked in the valuation of the stock at this point, which trades at a very rick present/forward PE."

Quite a few sales by insiders not too long ago. I’ll bet all bets are off on guidance-going-forward on our upcoming quarterly conference call.
"We are just starting to see how bad the auto market is going to be:“ Late-paying auto loans among big banks increased by 7.5 percent by the end of the first quarter while late credit-card payments rose only 3.5 percent, Autonomous Research reported.Banks attribute the rise in late payments to the fact that car payments are larger than credit cards’ minimum payments and, therefore, harder for cash-poor households to make.Delinquent auto loans were on the rise before the crisis, reaching 4.9 percent at the end of last year, 38 percent higher than their quarterly average since 2003.Sales of used cars also are slumping.The number of used-car auctions fell by more than half, according to J.D. Power, which expects used-car prices to be down by as much as 16 percent during the second quarter and 4 to 6 percent for the year…”If people can’t afford cars, they can’t buy gas, which means no money for roads. VMC management isn’t watching data."
VMC is down 5.23% to $100.51

This fall has been crazy. Would you dare buy VMC now...hmmm
"Almost three billion in debt and growing. And now revenues are going to take it on the chin, making earnings shrivel up. Much of the earnings going forward are going to be used to service the debt. The trailing p/e is 24! For a gravel company?! Imagine what the forward p/e is going to look like in three months."
Is it a good long term?
“ Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell urged the White House and Congress to spend more money to ensure their initial response to the coronavirus-induced economic downturn isn’t squandered.”Looks like Nathan will get his infrastructure bill. Probably a $2T package I’d bet. We’ll have a 7 to $10T deficit within the next 12 months. Crazy as it sounds.
why this share is down even after beating expectation
"State and local governments are making mass layoffs, housing is coming to a halt, revenue for roads (gasoline taxes) is drying up, yet this stock is rallying while already having a trailing p/e of 25. Wall Street is insane."
"In a few short weeks, we will likely see some soft numbers for 1Q20. But the worst of it will be the projections going forward. With JPM et al. making residential loans harder to get, the future is not looking too bright here. I’d expect some layoffs at VCM at some point, just like we’ve been seeing with some manufacturing companies already."

"Stock is getting no traction. Feds and states are going broke. They’ve taxes the American worker to death. They can talk 2T infrastructure, but if they spend that on top of $3T this quarter and another $3T next quarter, this year’s deficit will be $10T. Keep that up for a couple more quarters and you’ll have hyperinflation by next summer. So we are at a cross roads. Hyperinflation followed by deflationary depression or deflationary depression. Pick your poison. In any case, VMC ain’t getting paid by the government."

"Here’s how irresponsible and delusional VMC management is:“ BIRMINGHAM, Ala., Feb. 14, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- The Board of Directors of Vulcan Materials Company (VMC) - today declared a quarterly cash dividend of thirty-four cents per share on its common stock. The dividend will be payable on March 10, 2020, to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 26, 2020. The new quarterly dividend represents an increase of three cents per share.Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Hill, said, ""We have increased the dividend to reflect the Company's strong operational and financial performance and our confidence in delivering sustainable, long-term value to our shareholders.""How in earth can these guys have “confidence in delivering sustainable, long-term value as recent as mid February?? I guess they did not comprehend the significance of the Fed intervening in the repo markets in 2019 and the depths of the manufactured crisis. Clearly they did not comprehend the bubbles that were blown post 2009 since, when asked specifically about the 2008-09 era, they said they did not see the “overbuilding” and they say the markets are “structurally better”:“Yes, thank you. First of all, from a market perspective, the markets are just fundamentally and structurally different. And actually, they're structurally better. You don't have the overbuilding that we had some 12 years ago. If you look at it from either a res or a non-res perspective, we're still below long-term averages. You've got much better highway funding.“What planet do these people live on?? The markets have not been able to survive without extraordinary asset purchases by the Fed coupled with negative real interest rates. Plus, highway funding is/was drying up as spoke these words!I don’t give it more than 3 months for this company to withdraw its dividend and to start laying off workers. On the latter item, it looks like they may already have started doing so with cap ex cuts and contingency plans moving forward. Finally, you read the transcript of the call. What a bunch of puffery and delusional talk. They are relying on CA and IL to drive their sales. Are you kidding me? These states are ready to go under. All states will be cutting back on road construction. They need to get real when they talk to investors. We are not fools: revenue from gasoline taxes is shrinking dramatically!"
