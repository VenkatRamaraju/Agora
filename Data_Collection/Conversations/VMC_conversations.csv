I invested a little in the infrastructure. VMC is a given. Any others?
"We are just starting to see how bad the auto market is going to be:“ Late-paying auto loans among big banks increased by 7.5 percent by the end of the first quarter while late credit-card payments rose only 3.5 percent, Autonomous Research reported.Banks attribute the rise in late payments to the fact that car payments are larger than credit cards’ minimum payments and, therefore, harder for cash-poor households to make.Delinquent auto loans were on the rise before the crisis, reaching 4.9 percent at the end of last year, 38 percent higher than their quarterly average since 2003.Sales of used cars also are slumping.The number of used-car auctions fell by more than half, according to J.D. Power, which expects used-car prices to be down by as much as 16 percent during the second quarter and 4 to 6 percent for the year…”If people can’t afford cars, they can’t buy gas, which means no money for roads. VMC management isn’t watching data."
Expecting this to come down as no infrastructure bill will materialize. No way the democrats pass a bill that looks like a win for Trump
They are from the Planet Vulcan
"VMC will undeniably be caught-up in the investigation of Chao and potential conflicts of interest - benefits the company received based on that relationship. This isn't simply about Chao's investment in VMC. She was a member of the Board and as Transportation Sec received deferred stock units while at the same time being in a position to direct federal contracts to VMC. Just this week the House Oversight Committee issued a statement and request for information specific to Chao's relationship with VMC and associated federal contracts. Doesn't appear that the significant regulatory and litigation risks are presently baked in the valuation of the stock at this point, which trades at a very rick present/forward PE."
Started a relatively small position in VMC today. I have a feeling we are going to get some kind of infrastructure bill passed down from the government to stimulate the economy when we eventually come out of this pandemic. It'll probably be rough seas for a while though.
It won’t be long. One day shareholders will awake to a 10 to 15% drop in share price in one to two days. Stock is extraordinarily overvalued.
"If you price this stock in dollars, it is down over 33% from its highs. If you price it in gold, it is down over 50%. Precious metals made major moves last week while VNC retreated. Looks like the better play is to sell VMC and buy miners or metals."
United State Concrete is a great brand name. It should add value to Vulcans! Live long and prosper!
Bring back what I learned in ECON class....after a downturn typically infrastructure spending increases. I wouldn't expect anything different this year. Add $VMC $MLM $CAT $DE to my watchlist. They will benefit if this becomes reality.
My GUESS is NO ADVERTISING is allowed here! So no more tips on Stock #$%$ or whatever??
$GPV and $VMC Both are Canadian and both are great companies. At 1 point I had GPV bought at $28 and sold at $36. Now I have $VMC all the way because I have better chances to make lot of money.
Why hasn’t Sec of Transportation divested her shares in this road building co?

Looks like we will double from here. Beat earnings and forecast double digit growth in 2019. That's without an infrastructure bill. Breakout today and new 52 week highs. So glad I bought a few weeks ago charts showed accumulation. Also no pumping of these infrastructure stocks yet. Market makers are likely still accumulating for a big run. I expect the biggest and bestest infrastructure bill ever.
"They earned essentially the same as a year ago. In other words, no growth. They did not even keep up with inflation. Even if they were to pull a rabbit out of their hat and earn 47 cents for each of the remaining quarters this year, at a stock price in excess of $100 per share, we’d have a PE of greater than 50! For a company that is not even growing."
"Folks there are two good reasons to own Vulcan.... Number one they should be ""China proof"" they are not going to ship rocks from China!!Number two, they are Amazon proof, as Amazon is not going to start selling rocks and shipping them thru the mail!!And of course the best reason is our infrastructure is falling apart and at some point it will have to be fixed!!"
Crammer this chart is high.please go more in detail.compare it with viacom.30 billion in revenue for viacom versus 5 billion for vmc.pe 9 vs.33. ????
Added at $171.18. Any thoughts on buying NUE as well?
"Here’s what the company said at the end of 2019:“OutlookRegarding the Company's outlook, Mr. Hill stated, ‘In 2020, we expect another year of strong earnings growth. Vulcan-served markets should continue to benefit from public construction demand, led by higher levels of highway funding in our key states. We anticipate residential construction in our markets to continue strengthening after experiencing some softness in certain markets during the second half of 2019. Private nonresidential construction activity should also improve as leading indicators point to positive growth in 2020. Demand fundamentals, including population and employment growth, continue to support longer-term growth in residential and nonresidential construction. We are seeing a positive pricing environment driven by shipment momentum in private demand and visibility of public demand. Our focus remains the same – compounding our unit margins through all parts of the cycle and improving our returns on capital.’”Every single one of their categories for projected growth is going to drop off."
Vulcan Materials reached an all time high at 166.00
$VMC has 5x the pipeline of a peer like say $GPV and trading at 1/3rd the market cap. That gives me confidence of a sizeable runway ahead this year if $VMC can execute.
"“Because of this uncertainty in aggregates demand, we are withdrawing our previous financial guidance for 2020. We will continue to closely monitor trends in construction activity and work with our customers to meet their needs in this challenging operating environment. We will provide updates as more information becomes available and our visibility improves.”In other words, things are looking so bad we can’t determine the extent to which we will even have any earnings or how much our losses will be; nor can we predict the amount of downsizing may be necessary to keep the ship afloat. We will tell you what we project something at some undetermined date in the future. If the stock price"
Quite a few sales by insiders not too long ago. I’ll bet all bets are off on guidance-going-forward on our upcoming quarterly conference call.

Sleeper at this level going into blow out earnings Company does well with winter road salt
"Almost three billion in debt and growing. And now revenues are going to take it on the chin, making earnings shrivel up. Much of the earnings going forward are going to be used to service the debt. The trailing p/e is 24! For a gravel company?! Imagine what the forward p/e is going to look like in three months."

"Here’s how irresponsible and delusional VMC management is:“ BIRMINGHAM, Ala., Feb. 14, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- The Board of Directors of Vulcan Materials Company (VMC) - today declared a quarterly cash dividend of thirty-four cents per share on its common stock. The dividend will be payable on March 10, 2020, to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 26, 2020. The new quarterly dividend represents an increase of three cents per share.Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Hill, said, ""We have increased the dividend to reflect the Company's strong operational and financial performance and our confidence in delivering sustainable, long-term value to our shareholders.""How in earth can these guys have “confidence in delivering sustainable, long-term value as recent as mid February?? I guess they did not comprehend the significance of the Fed intervening in the repo markets in 2019 and the depths of the manufactured crisis. Clearly they did not comprehend the bubbles that were blown post 2009 since, when asked specifically about the 2008-09 era, they said they did not see the “overbuilding” and they say the markets are “structurally better”:“Yes, thank you. First of all, from a market perspective, the markets are just fundamentally and structurally different. And actually, they're structurally better. You don't have the overbuilding that we had some 12 years ago. If you look at it from either a res or a non-res perspective, we're still below long-term averages. You've got much better highway funding.“What planet do these people live on?? The markets have not been able to survive without extraordinary asset purchases by the Fed coupled with negative real interest rates. Plus, highway funding is/was drying up as spoke these words!I don’t give it more than 3 months for this company to withdraw its dividend and to start laying off workers. On the latter item, it looks like they may already have started doing so with cap ex cuts and contingency plans moving forward. Finally, you read the transcript of the call. What a bunch of puffery and delusional talk. They are relying on CA and IL to drive their sales. Are you kidding me? These states are ready to go under. All states will be cutting back on road construction. They need to get real when they talk to investors. We are not fools: revenue from gasoline taxes is shrinking dramatically!"
"VMC will be at 225.00 Jan 1st, 2022"
"The housing and construction industries are going to grind to a halt. There are are going to be many less buyers with the banks demanding 20% down and credit scores > 700. Further, who’d buy a house when the markets are in turmoil, when trillions of printed dollars are needed to prop it up, and when millions are losing their jobs. In addition, government revenues are shrinking — so highway construction etc will drop dramatically. Not looking good for ol’ VMC."
"Waiting and hoping that tonight’s state of the union, will be a catalyst for this stock. Anyone thinking the same?"
"Looking at the chart, next pause looks to be at $76/share. Then we pause again at $31 while on our way to still further lower prices. Keep in mind, we were at $31 only as far back as 2011. Seems like an unrealistic projection while looking at a stock price of $100, but the Fed can only prop up stocks for so long. And the Fed’s easy money IS the only thing keeping this stock from collapsing. We are so far afield from fundamentals here, it is a joke. There is no yardstick out there that even comes close to justifying a $100 per share stock price today or at any date for the foreseeable future."
So why is down?
$VMC BUYING VICINITY UNDER $10 IS LIKE BUYING NETFLIX WHEN IT WAS $40 
Barron's wrote a bullish article about CX/VMC/SUM and a few others 2 weeks ago......
BE CAREFUL HERE it may go to 50.........................coz I'm LONG
this is a heavily macro influenced cycle stock. we are at the top of the cycle and it falls apart right along with the economy. Long buyers beware.
