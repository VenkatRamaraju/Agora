Rest easy Yahoo finance has detected a bullish pattern.
Interesting moment past couple of days.
Who is buying more?! I did
"I am 3 year customer but start buying 1000 shares of Mile due to fact I am still not switching insurance company. I am a very stingy person watching every dollar I spent. So, if I didn't switch that means Mile has good business model. Hope other feels the same."
Hippo just formed an agreement with Ally financial. Mile formed an agreement with Hippo….very interesting!
"Looks like a hot entry point, ready for a bounce!"
Man alive. shorting this has been the easiest money I've ever made. No real opinion about the company but the shares are dead as a doornail. guess I'll just keep adding to my short position...trend is your friend!
"Volume was double than average. I feel that bottom was established, with one good PR I see it skyrocketing"
terrible quarter and guidance. should have gotten out.
This was a bad quarter. I’m gonna sell at a loss. Stock is not for me
"BTC became publicly traded in Sep 2015. It closed at $457 on its first day of trading. Since then, it has delivered a $1553% annual return. Those who bought in early when there was the most doubt (and risk) and held have amassed tremendous gains. Now Brazil prepares to adopt Bitcoin as a legal tender. If only some people would be patient to understand that Bitcoin isn't going anywhere, instead it's taking over the globe I’d like to recommend my trade expert Mr Davies Hill Trade, who has helped my investment survive the highs and lows of cryptocurrency with the help of his daily signals.

I bought more today…
$Mile can be easily scaled and new customers can be brought in quickly.
Speed bump. Potential buy opportunity coming up. Won't be the last before it finds it footing.
Time for some press releases. Give an update on clearance in a few newly added states. Announce some marketing partnerships. Feature a customer who has switched to MiLE and saved. Announce a category expansion—like collector cars as a new initiative. DO SOMETHING!
it looks like we are going to be in this game longer than I expected .
How’s my MILE family doing today?? Hope everyone loaded up or averaged down under $4! Sit back and relax
"Seems this management team is clueless as to how to sell insurance. Great product/idea, lousy execution. Fewer policies in effect because of re-opening? Give me a break. If they are accurate that people will save as much as they claim, the public should be breaking down their doors to sign up. Instead the customer retention rate is 68% and more people cancelled than signed up last quarter. Not sure why but something isn't working at this company, despite what should be a superior product offering, and management doesn't seem to know why either."
MILE is the best choice based on Rev and Earnings IMO.$LMND: MC $4.7Billion - Rev Q2 $28 mil and Earnings loss of $55mil$ROOT: MC $1.7 billion - Rev Q2 $89 mil and Earnings loss of $178 mil$MILE: MC $500 million - Rev Q2 $28 mil and Earnings loss of $41 milLMND is X10 more expensive than MILE.ROOT is X 4 more expensive then MILE.I am holding and buying and this levels. Do your own DD!
"ok guys ,someone help me please , what am I missing here? i can not find anything on this company that make the stock price sink like this , what is it that i do not see ?"
been holding forever at 12.97
I initially bought in the teens. Tripled down this morning to bring avg cost to single digits.
"""Buffet had Geico. I pick Metromile"" (Nov 4, 2020 by Chamath Palihapatiya)So far this has been a disaster. I'm a bag holder......got in at $14, it shot up & looked promising but since then it has been a major disappointment. Sucks to be me.....and Chamath and Friedberg and Cuban etc etc. I'm in great company! Lol"
Will now languish at a 40% discount to the SPAC deal. Brutal…
how can a company stock spac at $18 and fall all the way to below $4? the company hasn't change. they just haven't grown as quickly as expected. new age stock market is being played like a casino!!! I am afraid I want get my money back out of this one. I guess time will only tell. will check back in 5 years. either I will be broke or back to normal. 
I don't get it but it has been a great time to average down......WAY DOWN! I'm only gonna make 20% on my latest and it will happen soon. I'll bag hold the rest until $8 which could take only a short squeeze on Reddit or 2 years of patience. ...maybe earlier with some positive news and press.
I was confident buying in at 4.00 to 4.10 was a good play. I went with deep pockets and I’m a bit worried. Can’t pull out now so let’s hope either the earnings call carries promise or some game changing news hits. Otherwise this thing could roll to 2.50.
Does anyone believe from your experience or DD that this stock has a potential to reverse soon? Or pick back up at the end of Q1-2022? Thoughts?
I will buy more under $3.75 and keep selling covered call at $5 strike . So if the price needs a few years or longer to reach $5 that will be the better than it goes up to $5 in a few months.
Will add more every month if it stays below 4
"I’ve noticed time and time again that when a stock gets talked about on CNBC it goes down. Why that is, I don’t know"
Explain the high 2’s? What?
finally this is running and I think it won't stop until 6$ in the near term to consolidate for the next run to 8$
"Approx 95,000 policies and Est Annual Premium of $100,000,000 … company should now be capitalized to double - triple in size."
Next stop: 5.40$

"$MILE, investors include Chamath and Mark Cuban!"
Waiting
look at the insider buying on this stock its comforting to see . this is a bomb waiting to detonate and its coming soon. 
What a stock&
buyout imminent
"This company hides info, cause the board thinks they’re smarter than everyone. Because of it the stock tanks and little guys just hold the bag. Hope a hostile bid comes of this company and Preston n gang are booted from their own company"
lets go
"Unless its just my computer, looks like Yahoo Finance needs to fix the price change for After Hours.Change = 0.03 not 2.77 (But I wish it was.)"
buy pre market.... shorts will cover @ open
Does Mark Cuban still own MILE
What is the date for MILE Q3 report?
"OK they missed earnings estimate by three cents, but revenue was more than double what they expected. Isn’t this good news?￼"
whoever is selling right now must have taken the short bus to school
"The analysts don’t know how fast this company is growing. Getting the policy renewal ratio up from the mid 60’s to 85%-90% plus new business should accelerate the companies year-end 2021 EAP (estimated annual premium) from $125-135M to $175-200M year-end 2022.Dedicated “pay by the mile” Programs for the Gig Economy’s Uber, Door Dash, Grub Hub, Lyfts and Instacarts, as well as fleet taxi programs should also accelerate premium revenue.$100M EAP is nice, but at $300M EAP, Liberty Mutual may just put MILE in their pocket. IMO"
Shorts taking this one to the woodshed.
MILE is dead.
I ain't selling!
Buying now!!!
On Sale 9% today ....buying the Dip
Going to be profit taking as it rises. Buy the dips. Trend is up.
"honest question , and i need honest answer , should i sell at lost or wait? is it going to get worse ?"
just bought 40000 shares
anyone knows if any insiders are selling ?
TSLA and MILE a partnership coming. Get in before 10/20
And they’re adding $10M more of the hardest asset your moms ever seen. I’m buying. 
Let’s go back to 4 man
I’ll buy that for $1 
Just loaded up. Solid business model. Significant short interest. Sooner or later a short squeeze will happen! Diamond Hands!!
https://discord.gg/fmDpvUBM
am i the only one losing hope ? everyday is getting worse.
Where will this be in a year?
"what people do not get is you have to spend money to gain money, that is what growing companies do. while the company expending their expense is more than revenue, that is what happening here, profit is down the road.that is why when you invest in small growing companies you do not looking for any profit till couple years. guys there is light at the end of the tunnel. beleive in your decision"
Some news
10/20 guys. You will see! Tesla!
"My knees are buckling - bag is too heavy to continue to hold!""Besties"" have cost me $$$."
$MILE has a digital solution that is very different from ROOT & others that will disrupt the $250B Auto Insurance Market. $MILE digital solution will also apply to many other verticals. I believe $MILE delivered much lower expectations so as to beat in next Qtrly Call. Time will tell.
Their setup is the future. Pay for how much you drive.
anyone knows how to calculate the company value per share? how much mile worth per share ?
Not safe to buy until the next leg down to around $3. Should be about mid October
This never dissappoint me 
I think that I missed it. I only got the tail amend and bought at $5.05. Should I sell now?
Looking for a heavy bet. Debating between below 5 :$WISH$RIDE$RMO$XL$MILE
Before you buy this stock gi and get a quote from them.You will realize this company will be bankrupt soon
"if you are brave, check outMILEW - Metromile Equity Warrant 9th Feb 2026 $11.5 Warrantwonder if this is company is worth a wager at these prices. Well, insiders don't seem to be selling. I had checked out this company a few months ago, but ust noticed the warrants were up 16% at one point today."
"Oh my goodness, here we go!"
"not today- but someday, this will take off. the product just makes great sense"
Too Ripe Now !!! In a day or two this Rocket ship will be flying.

Finally up a day
Interesting interview with CEO https://youtube.com/watch?v=lZbQROnbW8I&feature=share
Just dove in for an additional 1500 to average down. Seems to of stabilized at about 4.00.
does it have a reason that we keep going down or it has no reason ?
almost all spacs recovered today except mile . very interesting
Stock is not good but I am a customer with Mile for the last 3 years. Haven't switch to other insurance company yet. I still think it is cheaper than my other insurance companies.
Strange price action today!
Mile expansion across America will start taking markets from legacy insurance companies.
Am seriously thinking of applying to jobs in MILE to see what these giys are upto
Wow this looks bad
Is this the bottom?
"Rediculous, this boat is going no where but to the bottom"
Can't even go up on a day like today? Come on man.
Switched a few of my cars to metro mile and invested $100k in it
I've got three cars insured with them and they're actually pretty good so this is crazy￼!
Lets talk about this short squeeze on reddit
Looks like opportunity to me.
Move your money to ROOT. They have $1.2 billion in cash and CVNA just took a 5% stake. It is highly shorted and a short squeeze can easily double the current price.
"Haven’t noticied this micro trend for a while, picking up in the last hour of trade is something unknown territory for this stock"
https://discord.gg/S9CSjkA
Massive slippage on 2021 goals. $3 stock at best.
Wallstreetbets where are you?
"At this point the only way to minimize damages is to buy bulk at its lowest and recoup as it slowly climbs, and then contemplate selling."
Jon Najarian just gave thumbs up for mile on CNBC
Prediction: $5 by mid September. Look at options.
Why is Metromile stock tanking?
We should see a reversal this week with a climb back to 3.90..
"I wish they would give us some news. I hope it can get back to merger price one day. No news is usually bad news, hopefully this isn't true for this one."
Stronger price action heading into Friday’s Option expiration
Is this the bottom?!
Where is Chamath hiding???
"My average on this is $16. Holding 600 commons, I have to admit it is a $#1t show."
"This is an easy 50% from current price imo. Just look at ROOT and LMND Q2 rev, earnings, and market cap. Do your DD"
"#$%$ is going on here? Earnings were not that bad. Down 50% in a week almost!? RSI is cooked, let?s bounce MILE!!"
"I actually think this trends toward bankruptcy, unfortunately."
Good time to buy a dip
not holding gains...come on
How does the pay-per-mile auto insurer platform work? How do they know how many miles your drive?
"i believe next 2-3 more earnings could be struggling also, if you're long then you may expect $10 in next 12 months."
"Did MILE just put in a double bottom against its August low? If so, a move towards $5 is in sight"
Looks like $8 run based on calls
Cracking open another bottle of lube in preparation for tomorrow.
From $20 to $7 in 5 months. Wishing I'd never heard of these guys.
I will buy more if it hits mid $2s
"Been watching this company for a while. Forget fundamentals, may be a short term swing play with this week’s hammering. Good luck to longs, interesting idea."
A ton more volume the last week n a half
Anyone have any insight on whether metro mile would work well for 18 year old college students living on campus?
"Looks like buyers are writing one month calls at $5 strike and picking up .20 -.25/sh premium, or 5-6% monthly premium on a $3.85/sh price."
They need a real CEO with insurance industry experience. Not someone that became the CEO because they had an internship at Google.
"let's be honest, this is a terrible company and we will all exit between $6-7"
pray we get acquired... I can't take anymore pain
5+ next week.
"The problem with metro is not where it is offering insurance, but the type of insurance it offers. I used to be a customer, but I decided to do some instacart on the side. Metro would not offer business endorsements on their policies, bye metro."
"I was a little shaky holding this today after the news of New Jersey where they provide coverage (is it even metromile who is backing the claims?), but I guess these companies have their ways to prepare for hurricane season."
$4.80 or less.... just gonna wait for it.
how tf was volume so high today without anything to show for it?
They need to expand to other States.
Chamath is a #$%$ !
MILE will run for miles now. Now is the time to load
"new 52 week lows, great job Dan Preston and thanks Chamath and Friedberg for wetting our beak's"
just loaded 500 shares... fire sale!
Metromiles and Root should merge as I said before to take over and dominate the insurance sector quicker pace.
Thinking of buying some at these prices but lacking funds due to recent buy on BABA at $157.
i bought the dip
who is selling down here?
Mile needs to expand across America.
Funny stock this is
I went aggressive in this stock and have been holding for a bit. Holding above 3.75 for consecutive days was great see. We should start our climb back into the low 4’s.
This is the end unless there is significant change of inefficient board of directors .........
Chamath is good with pumping.
Toyko Marine should just buy this for 7 or 8..no one will complain!
Someone knows something and buying.
"I am so glad to be aliave, witnessing lows for every week from last 30 weeks. Wow my life…"
"Another nice day in the market...and yet MILE, not so much..."
Just bought 1000 shares of Mile and 1000 shares of root. I am hoping merger of these two companies could really take over the insurance market. It makes sense also. Mile takes over all the good drivers and Root takes the rest. Good idea!
New 52 week lows... it can't get any worse.... ??
3 years customer with Mile now. Still not switching insurance companies. This means Mile is a good investment because I am stingy.
"$MILE Metromile has just begun to penetrate the USA Auto Insurance market. $MILE is very highly shorted stock and I believe in their last Qtrly call C Suite has managed expectations as low as possible. One good Qtr and shorty will head to the door. This is classic David Dreman, Contrarian Investment Trade Setup. Dan Preston, CEO and $MILE Board have a ""state of the art digital technology"" ready to disrupt $300 Billion Auto Insurance Market. The core technology can be applied to other verticals but Auto Insurance market is fragmented and ripe for disruption. One good Qtr and Shorty will head for the door to cover."
Those unusual $5 Oct. Calls from a couple of weeks ago looking interesting...Someone always knows something
"IMO Metromile $MILE has under promised in their last shareholder call. They are ripe for expansion and absorbing a fragmented market with their disruptive digital technology. I believe they are a strong competitive advantage over ROOT and other insurance providers but especially over fat cat legacy players like State Farm, GEICO. Let the disruption begin and the proof will be in their results. 3 Ps Strong People, Leadership, 250B Market that is served very inefficiently and strong value proposition. $MILE thus far has only begun to tap into National footprint. BUY if you can as Shorty has picked the wrong target again, like $GME Game Stop. Dan Preston CEO is even better then Cohen."
"If MILE Mgt is confident in the loss ratio implied within their filed rates, they need to stop allowing the large quarterly swings in accident year incurred losses to impact their quarterly reported results, and switch to a Fixed Loss Ratio Method of reserving accident years, and take the volatility out of their quarterly reporting of GAAP financials."
Due for a bounce to fill the large gap down soon.. let’s go MILE!!
Can this get pumped by wsb? What’s the short float?
Almost bought this a month ago… so glad I didn’t !! Bought KKR instead. Looks promising for years to come.
Fire the entire investor relations team ASAP. What a disaster. Get some press releases out immediately and communicate to those brave investors who have hung in there with this not-ready-for-prime-time management team.
Market Cap: 565MCash on hand: 224MNo debt.
Big News coming. Get in before 10/20. Tesla!!!!
Only years of my savings saying goodbye :/
What’s going on?
High 2s incoming
Miller Value partners add 6million shares of mile
Why is Metromile putting down millions of dollars into Bitcoin. ???? Not prudent for an insurance company. Not environmentally sound either as Bitcoin wastes large amounts of energy. I’m very disappointed.
"I think the bottom is finally in and we can consolidate and move up from here. Try not to give into the fear and dollar cost average if possible. Near term target $7, then $10"
Nice rally off oversold conditions. Easily gets above 6 and back to 7.
How low will it go?!
"Ah ye of little faith. MILE is undergoing ""growing pains"". Quite common among companies attempting rapid expansion plans. They have assembled a seasoned management team. They will figure it out."
"Folks this is a multi-year play. It is not going to be $50 tomorrow. It is a software/insurance company attempting to change the insurance business. If they actually open more states next year, the stock will get some pop. They continue to work with companies to utilize their software. They should have multiple revenue streams in the coming years. It's still a speculative bet."
Short squeeze coming?
"Got 1500 @ $ 4.02 just before the move. Had to average down from a ridiculous $ 15.66, now under $ 7.00.Go Mile Go"
I bought into MILE this morning
MILEw warrants became exercisable 9/8 and now are a 4yr 5mo leap call at $11.50 for a buck +\-
"I use to react occasionally to DD posted on here and got burned. Do your own DD, and block out the haters. Why post junk stock or trash stock on a forum designed for investors of that stock. Always hidden motives from the bear talk."
Metro preparing for takeoff!
"Poor guys… metromile is interesting but not really innovative compared to competition. Unlike most Fintech sectors, old guard car insurance has adapted to this new innovation. I might look at it here. Banking on a buyout, metromile won’t make it as a stand alone company."
Where to find earnings release?
Going private again? Buy shares back at $2.50. The boys say thanks for your money
Short Squeeze! Look at number of calls bought up!
drifting into oblivion. sorry longs. seen this movie many times.
possible reverse head and shoulders
Grabbed 250 more yesterday! Time to bounce fam! $5 soon?
More dilution coming
do my eyes deceive me or is this up 20% premarket?
Why is this going up? Any mews or bull trap?
