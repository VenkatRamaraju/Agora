https://discord.gg/vcUWXuP6gx
This is over reaction once again! Only weak players be selling anyway. I was so sick of Mike Williams comments. Muted. Awww that’s better!
my god market is up everywhere..I'm sitting looking at bigc going the opposite direction 
https://discord.gg/u9mm4je
Ouch! What a drop.
Stay bullish on bigc …
"bought at 70, 64, 58, what's next? should i buy at 49, 38, 19 8, -10? what the hec?Is everyone happy with management? just wondering"
Ugh get back to $70 please
This can hit $4-$5 very soon. And settle between $3-5. If they cannot improve their business this will stay here. Look at $BIGC lmaoooo bag holders forever !
"you will see a real run up in bigC once it breaks a profit in 2021. Im talking 500-600 a share 2 years from now, a $1000 in 5. Retail died with covid and it will never come back. Small E-commerce stocks are where you should look for 10 baggers. It is a 6 trillion dollar market with in infancy with few competing players. Although Shopify is a king, its market cap is much much bigger than BigC's, IBEX's or WIX's. It can double or even triple in 5 years but the above mentioned are more likely grow 5 to 15 times."
"This is going to pop going into Black Friday, Christmas, online Boxing Day, cyber Monday... great earnings and lots of scope for improvement."
stock should be 243$
With no volume. Still dipped 2 points. Where is the logic in this?
This is going to $100 fast 
Should be $80 today!!
Nice to pick up Mercado Libre’s 133 million customers in a region primed for e-commerce growth.
BIGC will be bigger than SHOP one day. Just my hunch 
Should i buy docu 218 or bigc at 106 i have 15k
Mike Williams saying big boys were selling. Chase Coleman is the kobe Bryant of the stock market. He still holds the position. What you talking about
Put bigcommerce in a safe lock it up and in 10 years take it out and enjoy an expensive bottle of wine.
I’ve invited GME investors to come here and get the shorts. If they come and help us out here then BIGC is going to $500. Good Luck.
I am stuck at 139
"$85 year end, relax everyone!"
Looks like I’m a baggie . September months baggies are made 
"each time you think management is starting to bring shareholder value, they blow it away with foolish decisions. i have this stock 1 year now, things still do not add up in this company. curious how long the disconnect between management decisions and shareholder value (value destruction) will be allowed."
what will be the price by next Friday?
I bought this at $130 and am about 50% down u guys think it will come back?
Hang in there longs. BIGC will have a solid quarterly report. It’s a little SHOP in the making. Amazon bringing it down today. Shopify had a great report this week. Shopify and BigC have incredible business models - supporting business.
Standing like a solid rock … all other stocks are dark red
I got in at 60 shortly after IPO but avg up to 82 unfortunately. One of my 14 stocks I do not enjoy checking. But I'm in it for long haul.
Big things happening 
why is BIGC up?
BIGC can be big:The $68 secondary offering closes today. BIGC announced launch of open checkout today to advance online checkout experience. It is a meagre 4.4 billion company with great growth potential (in comparison it’s competitor Shopify is 111 billion market cap). The stock has fluctuated from 60s to 160s all in last few months after IPO!!!. That is a huge range. Currently at the bottom. It can only go up from here IMHO. I bought yesterday at $65.50
With all this news if they report huge earnings it will be in the 100+ range
If I become a millionaire from bigcommerce I will write about Mike Williams in my book.
They have been on the upward with numbers but yet still see the stock sliding
Way under value. Can’t believe only small groups are picking up the stock at this price. Below 60?
Volatility. What a great way to make $ in the market.
Big day
Can Amzn just freaking buy the company and get it over with. I am sick and tired of this junk.

It will be green eod tomorrow
Very positive outlook. People are long.
I have a strong feeling a dip will come but the rebound will be enormous. Longs will earn the bucks.
49 million in revenue and a 5 billion market cap . This is a dump pile of a stock. Trade it with day trades. This won’t be back to all time highs for years to come
"BIGC has left the station, next stop 100 by year end. 500+ stock by 2023-2025. Mini SHOP in the making…"
69 B4 70
"40% increase in gross profits in FY 2020 and it could see an additional increase of 40-50% in FY 2021 based on expanded service offerings that are meant to stimulate platform adoption and sales. BigCommerce’s gross profits have increased at a steady rate every quarter since the beginning of 2019 and almost doubled in total dollar contributions from Q1’19 to Q1’21. In FY 2021, BigCommerce could have $160M in gross profits on $200M in sales (80% gross profit margin). Sales growth of 50% next year implies $240M in gross profits in 2022 for BigCommerce, more than what the firm is expected to make in sales this year!"
It’s really getting on my nerves. This should be at 70 not 67. Great opportunity to buy before it jump to 80. Yet it flattened @ 67 today. It’s a shame
Come on 70
management seems determined to blow up call option holders right before expiry almost every month.
This should be $100 today
Tomorrow we will be up another 10%. Mark this post!
Check out the amount of Job Openings added to LinkedIn every day for bigcommerce.
Back in
"I don't know where this stock price will end up in the future, but todays action is a very positive sign to me."
looking for strong guidance with the new partnerships announced during this past quarter !
"Way over valued, like ALL STOCKS"
"Seen the concern of some over insider selling....Looks like a lot of millionaires being made with the help of investors. However, when insiders receive a ""Conversion of Exercise of derivative security at price 0.39 per share"" from the company, I can see why they are selling. More concerning to me is that they obviously don't see a higher SP anytime soon. So what do longs do? I'm done averaging down. I guess I'll sit on it for now and hope e-commerce trends accelerate and a better valuation pulls the SP back up...."
This MF stock is really getting on my last nerve. A 6 percent drop in one day without any news? It should be at 70 already.
omg finally!! tomorrow another 10% up!!
"With the Facebook partnership, earnings should be good. BIGC should break all time high by January 2021. Good Luck Longs."
even with good news the stock doesn't move
Amzn and Shop keeps breaking new high. Why this one is dropping? What the heck is happening? It should be at 70 or above already.
Finally got out at $67 today with a small gain.....moving on.
Time to get back on the BandWagon!
Likely to show 40 levels again near earnings day
BigCommerce is up 7.42% to 71.66
We need chase Coleman to buy another 100 million lol
I’m holding everything!!! Great news! It shook out a few weaklings in the afternoon but it’s heading higher again. People are claiming aboard !
"I’ve been day trading for years and I’m so glad I finally found (http://Fairstox.com). They’re pre-market watchlists cover all the latest market-moving news, and they don’t beat you down with tons of ads. Highly recommend!"
"50 is def a good buy, but I just refuse to buy more of this stock"
See this board has really dried up. Interesting that in the last few weeks institutions have increased their holdings from 72% to 74.3%.

"Looks like the Nasdaq is going to take off today. With 3 weeks to earnings there's no better time to jump on board. BIGC has been working on big deals, bigger companies in the enterprise space."
I bought BIGC two weeks ago that’s why it is down a lot. I consider my money completely gone 100%. I just hope that I don’t cause the company to go under and employees losing their jobs.
I am in some private groups and there have been some news about Microsoft acquiring Bigcommerce to the Dynamics365 family.... interesting.
Going to 100.00 after earnings easy. Wish I owned more
This is not Shopify but I had 300 shares if it......and sold at 76 and 125 a share....yes you do the math. Left alot on the table......not this time.
Bought a part for my truck and was asked if I wanted to use Amazon pay. When redirected guess who showed as the connecting agent???? Bigc!!!! With connections to Amazon pay and Walmart how the hell is this stock so low? Still sitting on paper losses but bullish.
"Every time one of my stocks beats the earnings projections, it either does nothing or goes way down. Unbelievable!"
Next stop may be 44-46.00 if so I’ll grab 500 more will c
"Earnings, revenues beat! Beat on outlook!"
The usual earnings beat down for this company. I’m still holding. Maybe they will get it together one of these days.
"Guys - I am sorry, this is NOT your fault. The stock went down after I bought it, which happens to me everytime. Don't worry when I sell it will go back up again. I will let you guys know when I sell it."
So over bought
"Wasn't sure how this would open today. They paid a lot of money for a company with only $19M in sales-so would not have been surprised if it opened weak. These types of acquisitions are very difficult, in my opinion, to evaluate."
So sad
Down for no reason every day. Should be at $100 a share.
I am not selling my shares. Not a bad report.
Huge move for big c
"When A football team is on a losing streak, the coach is the first to go. Get rid of all the execs in this company, they are failing!"
Ugh wow
"I just realized they announced more shares in a 2026. This is 5 years from now, People are acting crazy because of this nonsense?"
Easy money! Been holding since 52 week low . I’m still positive
Everyone holding since the bottom!! We have been blessed!!!
BigCommerce is up 7.13% to 66.44
This is going to fly 120 in few weeks
It is one horrible stock for sure. It’s volatility has hedge funds written all over it.
"I got my 1,000 shares back 2 weeks later for .30 cheaper  this stock is crazy"
I guess Paypal will acquire Bigcommerce in the near future.
"All I know is I doubted chase Coleman in Shopify and I learned my lesson, we ain’t selling"
Introducing a new weekly series: The Mike Williams Prediction Scorecard. This week Mike predicted that BIGC would end below $60. No luck there! The score is currently Mike: 0 Market: 1. Tune in next week to see if his prediction that BIGC falls below $55 will come true!
"I'm honestly a large Bigcommerce user and run a large ecom business, I've tested Shopify also and Bigcommerce is way better. Shopify is great for mom and pop shops but major limitations for bigger companies, not to mention Shopify has fees per transaction but Bigcommerce does not. I'm not bashing Shopify but I think investors don't realize how good Bigcommerce actually is. They both have their uses, I've used both extensively and kept going back to Bigcommerce. Few things I'll say about Shopify is that in general their stores look better and have more 3rd party apps because of popularity. The only thing I wish Bigcommerce would work on is their themes for the new customers, there are some but the majority look outdated and I had to get one custom done."
Really getting on my last nerves. So frustrating when every thing else are up. Especially all the e-commerce stocks are up.
"Always the stairway up, escalator down. "
I want $80 now let go!
Lol I’m so glad I bought my 1000 shares months ago! This baby is gonna fly over the next 12 months! My projections is 500-700.00 In 3/5 years.
$80 after hours
"Well, I bought at 94, again at 78, and just now at 67. Hopefully I wont have to buy anymore : )"
Easy money
"I truly not understand the SP for this stock! it's like a clown circus, no sense at all "
It will probably do the same thing next earnings announcement -- go up before earning and then come down after unless they are out of this world. Appears to be happened to a lot of high growth tech companies.
Another month of screwing over the call option holders the last week of expiry.
They must have blockbuster revenue and earnings numbers since they moved up the report date from December to November. And their institutional ownership has gone up again. Hold on for a rocket.
Well that was weird
Please something positive for once
"Mark Cuban is on board (for a fee, I’m sure, but still) for Make It Big Conference!Oh, this is getting good."
value stock
Let’s go bigc 
One of my easiest investments ever. Thank you for the price!!!! I will hold long and strong for the next 2/3 years 
$100 tomorrow!
"I'm holding 1000 shares, I've been hoping to see this company hit revenue growth rate numbers that surpass Shopify but they just don't appear to be scrappy or innovative enough. I was able to sell some over-priced calls at the end of the session, I'll rinse and repeat until I'm out of this company."
BIGC heading up! Should see $80+ after next earnings. Load up and GLTA!
Where will bigcommerce use these funds raised by Ossining these convertible notes? Hopefully not executive pay.
SHOP 70.6% held by institutions
OMG where is the bottom? I am so sick in my stomach now. Who the heck is selling at this price when earnings is coming?
"Big bounce coming - weak hands and short term folks got out at open, after realizing no big up day for BIGC. Now all selling is over, could see green by eod"
Yes finally we’ve made it back past 100!!!!!!!
OMG. It’s down again pre market. Need to see it at 70 soon. Can’t understand it why all of the sudden it is going down. Crooks can’t give this a rest. Already dropped below 60 yesterday. It’s time to come back up.
"2023-2024….ok mid 2024 price will be $275…,,once that is hit sit back and enjoy the ride."
If actually go up on earnings for once I’ll be so happy
These crooks just won’t give it a rest. Keep shorting this stock to steal our shares. If u are out there reading … don’t fall for the tricks. They are crooks. I am still holding my shares @67.50 average. Not selling.
$BIGC sellers are losers .. just think of it so many things next week 1. infrastructure bill will go through market will up again also 2 ER is due next week which no doubt BIGC will beat the estimates
Should be in the $70s!!
Can anyone explain why it’s down on this earnings report though? What was negative?
Shop is down too so not surprised
"$BIGC Amazon revenue is nothing to do with $BIGC , $AMZN is centralized hub to buy/sell and $BIGC promote having each merchants its own $SHOP to break Amazon monopoly"
They had some interesting insights about BIGC on (http://Multistockalerts.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
Why is this up???
"BIGC: what an opportunity today. This was once $162. It has delivered great Q2 results. SHOP is 190 billion market cap, BIGC a meagre 4.4 billion. The growth potential is insane"
The drop is due to them projecting a drop in revenue in Q4 over Q3 which is puzzling since holiday sales should mean better numbers.
"I was very reluctant...but sold 10% of my shares before earnings due to the run up.Its at 22 times sales now with high growth.Bought back the shares...for some reason, BigC drops even after a good beat.I fear that by looking at the price regularly, I am going to miss its bull ride like I did for couple others this year grrrr"
At this point my average is $66 and I can’t average down anymore. Just gonna hold and pray
So ridiculous. Low volume and dropped over 1 point. I don’t think anyone is selling but the crooks are filing the options calls. They are selling to each other to push the price down. Wait until August when earnings is released from here to 80.
Ugh
"one of the analyst raised the target to 85, let's get back to 50 first"
"Relax, 70+ this week. This always rises before earnings. Easy $"
70.50 price bought in today’ is that a good price? Or did I pay too much?
This is how fast this stock moves up
BIGC reported only $.06 quarterly loss. They previously said they would be profitable by end of 2022. Looks like it could be end of this year now.
"Annnd we’re back with another episode of the Mike Williams Prediction Scorecard! This week Mike predicted that BIGC would fall below 55 and stay above 50, a correct prediction! That puts the current score at Market: 1; Mike: 1. Congrats Mike, you’re now as good as a coin flip!"
"If 61.50 will not hold, we will see 56; if 56 will not hold, then we can be again for a ride down to 41, and below if markets turn sour, we can even get to see the mid to high 20s... :) I will be adding, in any case, a few more lots on anything below 50. This is the only ""tech"" company that I am holding and not trading it, doing both sides of the options, to collect premiums and lowering the cost base on anything that I get assigned on the put side."
I am in for 2200 shares @76. God knows when will I be able to get out of this stock?
1000 shares long here sell 4-500.00
The lower they go the more I buy!!!! These guys are gonna be ripe for a major buyout in a couple years.
Buying opportunity. This stock will be $80 before the end of the year. The only problem now is few people understand their technology. That will be resolved in time.
Wow lol I feel smart for selling!

I just want this back at $70. Is that too much to ask for
I could live with 3-4% down but this is unrealistic
This should be the heaviest volume day going back to November on no news that I can see. Does anybody know why the move?
Hope it drops so I can buy more
Earnings was good. It’s down. It’s unbelievable that these crooks control the market as they pleases. With great expectations and good earnings. This should be at 80 already. Still holding.
Relief is coming !Ok this news got the attention of investors. Big News. We’re looking at $80 real soon.
Undervalued !! Easy money
I may of made a big mistake. E-commerce stocks are struggling. Hmmm
I need this at $100
"BIGC will rebound next year. Right now there is a lot of year end tax loss selling. Too many people are in the res from it’s big run to $160. It will be $160 and beyond again, but in 2021. For now it is going to trade sideways till the end of the year. We may see $90 in the next 2 weeks."
"This stock will do well in the long term. Every time it hits these lows, it always springs up again. This is a great buying opportunity."
BigCommerce (BIGC) to Offer $300M in Convertible Senior Notes
When will we cross $70 again?? Can’t wait
Just loaded up. Earnings will be phenomenal. Expect this to trade close to the 80s when they hit it out of the park! I see green in my sleep boys and girls.
God only knows when this stock is going to make us some money!!
BIG C. Big Catastrophe
Looks like this stock is toast.
Is the recent drop anyway related to lock up period after IPO ? anyone know ?
"BIGC emphatically forecast it will be profitable by 12/22. Shopify became profitable this year, 5 years after their IPO and 15 years after founded. It still made a lot of money while reporting a loss. Young companies grow by reinvesting in the business."
"If I hadn’t listened to the wife on SHOP, NIO and AMC I would be looking at buying an island! I’ve learned the hard way, don’t listen to anyone but yourself. There’s a reason why you bought. I’m in this one fir the long haul. I have no other choice because on this one she recommended BUY. And I did. But the good news is I don’t listen to her any more!"
"I don't know how others think but when I invest in stocks, I target at least 2 years. Having BIGC this low is such a beautiful opportunity for me to buy even more and drive my average down. See you guys in 2023."
Funny how the stock has a hard stop going above $70. Must be the hedgies doing there tricks again.
"This stock and AAPL are the most frustrating to own. BIGC should be at least 65-70 right now after yesterday and today.Just an FYI - I spoke with my BIGC rep last week as I am an enterprise user of their platform. I was told the next 12-16 months will be very exciting. Many new partnerships like the Walmart one and a big move internationally are on the calender. I was told ""Be patient and you will be rewarded"""
"This will be at $275 on October 26th, 2023. Not any crazier then all the other posts, hey Williams!"
What happened today? Anyone knows ? Yesterday was up 3 points. Today back to where it started. Can’t wait to get out again when it hit 70.
BigCommerce is down 6.78% to 64.37
Anyone entered within the $65-$67 pls give a like 
Anyone holding since 50’s?!?
Navigating through this one year was an exercise in patience￼￼. I’m good with results. First year steering the ship  and with decent results.
Big c following shop
"70+ this week and 80+ next week.Easy $$,$$$"
"Hey William, Mike, Mike Williams, institutions own 72% insiders own 16%…….that’s 12% for general public. Which institution are you working for??? I’ve noticed you on a lot of other stocks. Your always negative and shorting….so again which institution are you working fir????"
"BIGC... Prime candidate for a buy out from the likes of FB, who is already using them to process FB and Insta commerce"
This should merge with shopify
Just close above $70 come on
Whats with all the insider selling ?
Always falls after earnings.
So 1 billion was wiped of the market cap due to the issues convertible notes. Was that really worth it?
So stock goes from $72 to $54 in a flash after earnings. Is that weird or what?
Unreal. Why the dip???? Lol what ever I did buy it over 5 1/2 points cheaper. Can never time the bottom or the top
Tanking bad
"8/13/2021BIGCBIGCOMMERCE HOLDINGS INC SER 1 Sell– 1,000.0000$62.81$0.32$62,813.88"

While Feedonomics provides an incremental boost to our revenue estimates,guidance reflects a modest increase in the pre-acquisition revenue business. Werecommend buying the stock on an expanding set of growth drivers. Raisingestimates and PT to $90"
It can take a long time to build a really great company and I think this management team is doing a good job BUT they HAVE to figure out a way to put up an impressive enough quarter that this doesn't continue to happen. Steady eddy growth every quarter isn't enough for a company with this kind of valuation and it will continue to attract short sellers. It is not that hard to being able to put up one beat and raise quarter. Companies have enough flexibility in their accounting to do this once in a while.
Simple question… Why?
When will I ever break even?
Sold at 58.20 bought it back at 57.97 earlier today. X 1000 shares why? Just to lower cost average on my holdings a little. Full disclosure long Bigc. I Was worried I lost it. I will not try to juggle Bigc again. Not these 1000 shares.
Institutions trading within themselves driving the little guy out. Sorry but I’m here for the next five years.
No reason for this. I can not find any news at all
"Like I said since not long after IPO, BIGC will keep dropping."
"No reason to drop, it’ll rebound"
"Pasted from an article about shopify:What may change — though there is certainly no guarantee — is investors’ perception of Shopify’s stratospheric market valuation. The company’s market value at close of trading Wednesday was $191 billion — 42 times estimated 2021 revenues. In the wider tech universe, a ratio of 10 times revenues is considered expensive. But even in the rarified atmosphere of e-commerce startups, that’s rich. The market value of two of Shopify’s biggest competitors — BigCommerce and Lightspeed Commerce — is less than 25 times projected revenues."
It means the 8 percent drop today is exact of 300 m to market cap. Ah is over sold. Flat Tom. But def insider trading to have it fall exactly right. In my opinion. I bought 250 ah to bal out my 1000 today I picked up at .90 all good I’ll make money on this if I want to sell in the fall.
Red day again…
Dan is a good guy!
"I don’t understand it. With Nasdaq breaking news high every day, this is however going down 3 straight days in the row. What is happening?"
so it will be worth 77.11 a share by next April 2022 for sure based on the notes offered
"Total 50k shares traded so after hours, really? Panic selling :)"
Buy the dip and hold for the long term:https://www.google.com/amp/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/article/4374088-bigcommerce-buy-dip-and-hold-for-long-term
"Back in. 5.00 cheaper a share wow this market is brutal 1,000 shares"
Great investment. Good luck shorts!!
"I’ve had a $113 avg since the summer, and was at a loss (and still am) yet I always held on. I truly believe BIGC will touch those levels again within a few weeks"
This should be $80 today
Like I asked what firm are you working for?
"Amazon (1.81T market cap), Walmart (395B market cap), Mercado Libre (77B market cap), everyone wants to be associated with BIGC. This will be 200-300 in 1-2 years."
"I don’t know what I would do without the help of (http://Thetraderguide.com). Their watchlists are so well researched and help me make the best possible picks when it comes to investing. Not only do they save me time, but their advice has shown to be tried and true!"
11%?? That just seems like an over reaction
My fair value calculated for $BIGC is $28. I'm right most of the time.
When is this likely to go to $1000 ?
Let’s goooo
Former Zillow CEO and VC investor mentioning BIGC multiple times as great ways to play eComm right now on CNBC.
"It is said that BigCommerce continues to innovate in building one of the best Open SaaS eCommerce platforms in the world. The company could position itself in the industry. Furthermore, these other companies' new aerospace technology could offer significant advantages over current conventional aircraft. They might include lower operating costs, a reduced noise footprint, increased safety, and lower carbon emissions. Know them here! This is a sponsored post.

Just grabbed another 1000 shares as earnings are sure to pop in this ecommerce work from home BOOM!
MIKE WILLIAMS hahahahhhahahahahahahhha
"Well, I unfortunately bought a 100 when it was 94, so I just bought another 100 at 74, hope I made the right decision."
Welcome to Sept. historically worse month
Very good results. Added more on the dip
Hits numbers and goes down. Happens all the time with this company
"Good revenue growth, gross margin 80%"
Amazon and Shop are up over 3%-4% and this is hardly up ugh
"Shopify market cap 144 B, BigCommerce 4.4 B considering that BigCommerce is better and cheaper in prices"
"Legendary Billionaire chase Coleman that was an early investor in Shopify, Netflix, Square, Facebook, twilio, zoom, Docusign and peloton is holding BIG COMMERCE"
"If this closes 70+ today, 80 my friends is surely on the way."
Three days ago I mentioned Amazon hunting for companies who can help them obtain dominance over Shopify. It was removed by Yahoo. Ugh! But I’m serious. I’ve friends in high places at AWS and believe me BIGC has been in the conversations allot.
Q: does anyone here know about affirm?
"Investors selling for year end tax loss offsetting have finished, this should have a strong 2021 and post strong numbers after the holiday season."
No sorry I made 850! Lol
"$TSLA in just one day cross 10 billion dollar market cap, I have seen lot SPACS those have 10 billion mc without any revenues . With y/y 40 percent revenue and cheapest #$%$ in the market and close competitors to $SHOP it deserve market cap of at least 10 billion. For 10 billion the price for share would be around $140 but still cheap .. lot of upside potential"
Back to $70 next ER. Got rid of weak hands.
It literally break a new low every day while other e-commerce stocks are up?
Loaded even more. Will come back next year.
"Sponsored Post:Recently, BigCommerce has announced the global launch of Big Open Data Solutions, a full product suite featuring both native and best-of-breed partner data solutions.

Check disclaimer on the landing page."
So why has this stock stumbled the last few days so much? Not normal market activity. Maybe because they are printing another couple 100 thousands of shares to give incentive shares.
"Weak hands jumping ship. As soon as the volume goes down, BIGC will return to its upward trajectory."
Thank you!
Bigc really?????? I jist got you back and you are doing this to me already???
Great report.  I know that some people sell but they will regret it because it will go up much higher soon after…
"I don't own any BIGC shares, but when a company does a public offering at 20% below what the stock has been averaging for past 2 weeks, it sends a negative signal to me. Plus the shareholders who are proposing to sell 1M shares are offering additional 3M shares to the underwriters in first 30 days, plus another 750K shares. That is way too much supply for the marketmakers to absorb. I see the stock in the 50s until the supply/demand issue gets balanced."
2016 ..SHOP was trading in the 40's ....!
$70 in 2 weeks or less as earnings are sure to be better than expected. Im loading up!!
I think these earnings are strong.. higher revenue growth than in Q2/20
"Bought today at $65.50. The offering is $68 and will close on Nov, 17th. The peak price over a year is $162. Today, I struggled buying between TSLA and BIGC. Lo and behold, AH TSLA released news on S&P. It is funny. But, BIGC has lot of room to run. It is a meagre 4.4 billion market cap relative to Shopify’s 111 billion. So BIGC is just getting started and needs just one big news for it to run parabolic"
I want this back at $100
Over valued
LSPD TO BUY BIGC
Buyout by shopify coming soon
Great partnership with AMZN to integrate with multi-channel fulfillment app which allows its US merchants to more easily fulfill their e-commerce orders. This opens up a whole a new space for BIGC to grab marketshare from ETSY and Shopify......Huge..... huge....huge!
1000 strong long term
"I will be buying the rest of my covered calls today since they are only worth a few hundred bucks and I think this is a real big over reaction to the past earnings. I was glad when it pulled back SOME because my covered calls had gone up too much and I was not gaining anything on the upside.Still hold 800 shares, down from 1350 shares when sold some at 68.Way overdone . NO WAY IM A SELLER AT THESE PRICES even if it goes to lows of the year. Not selling.....Not gonna give you up................"
"Ya we all thought this was going to be a Shopify. Blunder! Looks like FOUR is expanding their platform faster, and thats not even their primary service."
"BIGC next ER is less than 3 weeks away! May 11, after the close."
I just took a Big C
Yawn...this isn't 90 yet? Have to stop myself from looking at the price for another 6 months.
is $BIGC buying BLIN?
below 55 at opening?
"This should be buy point at $71, see the W shape at the bottom, I bought 1500 shares at 68.6, now I just another 700 shares at $71.3. I have 2200 shares with cost $69.5/share"
I need this to 
Where are the tiger Cubs
"Just wait, until now not many if any investors knew about this company. IT guys all knew about it as it is the second-best product besides SHOP. it is the only SHOP competition on the market. Yes, it is small but that's good because potential is huge. What are the chances of SHOP going 200% up...small, what are the chances of this jumping 200% much higher, because at $240 this is still better than SHOP at 3500. Sky is the limit for BIGC, literally."
"BIGC is where Shopify was in 2015… before their stock went up 40x… Granted, I don’t think BIGC is gonna explode that much, and will probably be ripe for a buyout… But this is a unicorn. Get it while it’s below 80. After 80 it won’t be coming back down!! This is a 5-10x stock in 5 years ez."
Love the partnership with Mercado Libre. Go BIGC!
They are announcing earnings a month ahead of schedule. They will hit it out of the park and become profitable this Q. 80 here we come!
Bigcommerce teams with AMAZON!!!!!!!!!
Crawling back upppp c’mon
My target is 500. Not selling
Eventually they will keep increasing revenue and the valuation will follow
report doesnt look bad at all
"Reading the ER transcript and recent PR, BIGC has had over 30% growth for the last 6 quarters, and they have numerous strategies in place to keep growing their market. The Feedonomics acquisition will greatly benefit their omnichannel focus, which is expected to be a $41 billion market by 2024. Plus, they are aggressively hiring for their expanding international market. Very impressive results. I'm happy to keep holding."
This is heading to $100 after earnings.
This is very strange behavior
I can only average down so much until I own the whole company
"$65 next week, $80 by next earnings. GLTA!"
Earning were a beat and they raised next Q and full year guidance.Trading at 12 times sales versus SHOP at 40 times sales lolAnalyst positive comments tomorrow would move it. Well see
Every time leading up to earnings it goes up and then crashes after earnings. God I hope this time is finally different
"12 days till earnings in in it.I’ll sell around 500-1,000.00 3/5 years"
All stocks red
Ok i sold made 650.00 have a nice day
"When companies announce quarterly earnings earlier than scheduled, it usually means a surprise in numbers. Could be in for some really good news."
Will we see 100 tomorrow??
Missed eps revenue up but not enough to compensate eps missed
Any bag holder? Still over valued
Never bet on ER
It is history of last 3 earnings always go south.
Had hope this was going to reach 70. Not sure it will reach it any time soon.
15% drop in less than 3 trading days. Manipulation.
The offering won’t even happen until 2026. Can we chill out and work with what we got first? The CEO of the company should release that they are talking to Amzn about merging…in 2030. Only talks can make one stock up or die. Then l guess it does not matter anymore. Just make the announcement.
will this crash this afternoon ?
Looking for the reason to watch this going down every day since last week? Any ideas?
"The lowest this can drop 57.75 short terms, long terms over $ 3000.00, mark this post..."
Everyone gives up and bails on the stock. Then it starts to go up. That's the way it's done!
Expecting big things after hours!!!!
Feedonomics states that they're one of the fastest growing companies. Should be very interesting to see how this evolves.
