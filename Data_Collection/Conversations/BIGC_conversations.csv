Navigating through this one year was an exercise in patience￼￼. I’m good with results. First year steering the ship  and with decent results.
Welcome to Sept. historically worse month
I have a strong feeling a dip will come but the rebound will be enormous. Longs will earn the bucks.
Introducing a new weekly series: The Mike Williams Prediction Scorecard. This week Mike predicted that BIGC would end below $60. No luck there! The score is currently Mike: 0 Market: 1. Tune in next week to see if his prediction that BIGC falls below $55 will come true!
Going to 100.00 after earnings easy. Wish I owned more
Yawn...this isn't 90 yet? Have to stop myself from looking at the price for another 6 months.
They are announcing earnings a month ahead of schedule. They will hit it out of the park and become profitable this Q. 80 here we come!
"If this closes 70+ today, 80 my friends is surely on the way."
69 B4 70
What happened today? Anyone knows ? Yesterday was up 3 points. Today back to where it started. Can’t wait to get out again when it hit 70.

"When A football team is on a losing streak, the coach is the first to go. Get rid of all the execs in this company, they are failing!"
Huge move for big c
"“This acquisition reflects our strong belief that Feedonomics offers the world’s best product feed optimization and syndication solution for merchants looking to optimize their advertising and selling via search engines, ad networks, social media sites and marketplaces. On average, these channels represent ecommerce merchants’ largest non-direct source of sales and one of the largest spending line items,” said Brent Bellm, CEO at BigCommerce."
"I got my 1,000 shares back 2 weeks later for .30 cheaper  this stock is crazy"
Q: does anyone here know about affirm?
"Annnd we’re back with another episode of the Mike Williams Prediction Scorecard! This week Mike predicted that BIGC would fall below 55 and stay above 50, a correct prediction! That puts the current score at Market: 1; Mike: 1. Congrats Mike, you’re now as good as a coin flip!"
"Earnings, revenues beat! Beat on outlook!"
"Relax, 70+ this week. This always rises before earnings. Easy $"
"The lowest this can drop 57.75 short terms, long terms over $ 3000.00, mark this post..."
Come on 70
I could live with 3-4% down but this is unrealistic
Very good results. Added more on the dip
Big c following shop
15% drop in less than 3 trading days. Manipulation.
BIGC will be bigger than SHOP one day. Just my hunch 
"2023-2024….ok mid 2024 price will be $275…,,once that is hit sit back and enjoy the ride."
$80 coming 
This is very strange behavior
Put bigcommerce in a safe lock it up and in 10 years take it out and enjoy an expensive bottle of wine.
will this crash this afternoon ?
Crawling back upppp c’mon
1000 strong long term
Like I asked what firm are you working for?
"Back in. 5.00 cheaper a share wow this market is brutal 1,000 shares"
"40% increase in gross profits in FY 2020 and it could see an additional increase of 40-50% in FY 2021 based on expanded service offerings that are meant to stimulate platform adoption and sales. BigCommerce’s gross profits have increased at a steady rate every quarter since the beginning of 2019 and almost doubled in total dollar contributions from Q1’19 to Q1’21. In FY 2021, BigCommerce could have $160M in gross profits on $200M in sales (80% gross profit margin). Sales growth of 50% next year implies $240M in gross profits in 2022 for BigCommerce, more than what the firm is expected to make in sales this year!"
With all this news if they report huge earnings it will be in the 100+ range
We need chase Coleman to buy another 100 million lol
Really getting on my last nerves. So frustrating when every thing else are up. Especially all the e-commerce stocks are up.
"Like I said since not long after IPO, BIGC will keep dropping."
"Total 50k shares traded so after hours, really? Panic selling :)"
so it will be worth 77.11 a share by next April 2022 for sure based on the notes offered
The usual earnings beat down for this company. I’m still holding. Maybe they will get it together one of these days.
It will probably do the same thing next earnings announcement -- go up before earning and then come down after unless they are out of this world. Appears to be happened to a lot of high growth tech companies.
Finally got out at $67 today with a small gain.....moving on.
"I was very reluctant...but sold 10% of my shares before earnings due to the run up.Its at 22 times sales now with high growth.Bought back the shares...for some reason, BigC drops even after a good beat.I fear that by looking at the price regularly, I am going to miss its bull ride like I did for couple others this year grrrr"
Why the dipIn Bigc today?? Anyone?
I need this at $100
$BIGC sellers are losers .. just think of it so many things next week 1. infrastructure bill will go through market will up again also 2 ER is due next week which no doubt BIGC will beat the estimates
"$BIGC Amazon revenue is nothing to do with $BIGC , $AMZN is centralized hub to buy/sell and $BIGC promote having each merchants its own $SHOP to break Amazon monopoly"
Wow lol I feel smart for selling!
OMG. It’s down again pre market. Need to see it at 70 soon. Can’t understand it why all of the sudden it is going down. Crooks can’t give this a rest. Already dropped below 60 yesterday. It’s time to come back up.
Let’s goooo
This should be $100 today
"BIGC is where Shopify was in 2015… before their stock went up 40x… Granted, I don’t think BIGC is gonna explode that much, and will probably be ripe for a buyout… But this is a unicorn. Get it while it’s below 80. After 80 it won’t be coming back down!! This is a 5-10x stock in 5 years ez."
BIGC reported only $.06 quarterly loss. They previously said they would be profitable by end of 2022. Looks like it could be end of this year now.
BigCommerce is down 6.78% to 64.37
If I become a millionaire from bigcommerce I will write about Mike Williams in my book.
My fair value calculated for $BIGC is $28. I'm right most of the time.
Where are the tiger Cubs
"If I hadn’t listened to the wife on SHOP, NIO and AMC I would be looking at buying an island! I’ve learned the hard way, don’t listen to anyone but yourself. There’s a reason why you bought. I’m in this one fir the long haul. I have no other choice because on this one she recommended BUY. And I did. But the good news is I don’t listen to her any more!"
value stock
Over valued
11%?? That just seems like an over reaction
All stocks red
"I’ve been day trading for years and I’m so glad I finally found (http://Fairstox.com). They’re pre-market watchlists cover all the latest market-moving news, and they don’t beat you down with tons of ads. Highly recommend!"
Ok i sold made 650.00 have a nice day
I just took a Big C
Shop is down too so not surprised
If actually go up on earnings for once I’ll be so happy
Funny how the stock has a hard stop going above $70. Must be the hedgies doing there tricks again.
"Big bounce coming - weak hands and short term folks got out at open, after realizing no big up day for BIGC. Now all selling is over, could see green by eod"
I guess Paypal will acquire Bigcommerce in the near future.
"I will be buying the rest of my covered calls today since they are only worth a few hundred bucks and I think this is a real big over reaction to the past earnings. I was glad when it pulled back SOME because my covered calls had gone up too much and I was not gaining anything on the upside.Still hold 800 shares, down from 1350 shares when sold some at 68.Way overdone . NO WAY IM A SELLER AT THESE PRICES even if it goes to lows of the year. Not selling.....Not gonna give you up................"
Every time leading up to earnings it goes up and then crashes after earnings. God I hope this time is finally different
"I don’t understand it. With Nasdaq breaking news high every day, this is however going down 3 straight days in the row. What is happening?"
It will be green eod tomorrow
below 55 at opening?
"8/13/2021BIGCBIGCOMMERCE HOLDINGS INC SER 1 Sell– 1,000.0000$62.81$0.32$62,813.88"
Whats with all the insider selling ?
"I just realized they announced more shares in a 2026. This is 5 years from now, People are acting crazy because of this nonsense?"
Nice to pick up Mercado Libre’s 133 million customers in a region primed for e-commerce growth.
Should be $80 today!!
Another month of screwing over the call option holders the last week of expiry.
Hope it drops so I can buy more
"each time you think management is starting to bring shareholder value, they blow it away with foolish decisions. i have this stock 1 year now, things still do not add up in this company. curious how long the disconnect between management decisions and shareholder value (value destruction) will be allowed."
It’s really getting on my nerves. This should be at 70 not 67. Great opportunity to buy before it jump to 80. Yet it flattened @ 67 today. It’s a shame
Great investment. Good luck shorts!!
This MF stock is really getting on my last nerve. A 6 percent drop in one day without any news? It should be at 70 already.
Easy money! Been holding since 52 week low . I’m still positive
So 1 billion was wiped of the market cap due to the issues convertible notes. Was that really worth it?
Lol I’m so glad I bought my 1000 shares months ago! This baby is gonna fly over the next 12 months! My projections is 500-700.00 In 3/5 years.
This should be $80 today
So stock goes from $72 to $54 in a flash after earnings. Is that weird or what?
BIG C. Big Catastrophe
This should merge with shopify
Thank you!
"Looks like the Nasdaq is going to take off today. With 3 weeks to earnings there's no better time to jump on board. BIGC has been working on big deals, bigger companies in the enterprise space."
OMG where is the bottom? I am so sick in my stomach now. Who the heck is selling at this price when earnings is coming?
So why has this stock stumbled the last few days so much? Not normal market activity. Maybe because they are printing another couple 100 thousands of shares to give incentive shares.
"Still holding the bag, I hope it does not tank wildly this after 5 PM..."
It can take a long time to build a really great company and I think this management team is doing a good job BUT they HAVE to figure out a way to put up an impressive enough quarter that this doesn't continue to happen. Steady eddy growth every quarter isn't enough for a company with this kind of valuation and it will continue to attract short sellers. It is not that hard to being able to put up one beat and raise quarter. Companies have enough flexibility in their accounting to do this once in a while.
"Pasted from an article about shopify:What may change — though there is certainly no guarantee — is investors’ perception of Shopify’s stratospheric market valuation. The company’s market value at close of trading Wednesday was $191 billion — 42 times estimated 2021 revenues. In the wider tech universe, a ratio of 10 times revenues is considered expensive. But even in the rarified atmosphere of e-commerce startups, that’s rich. The market value of two of Shopify’s biggest competitors — BigCommerce and Lightspeed Commerce — is less than 25 times projected revenues."
Feedonomics states that they're one of the fastest growing companies. Should be very interesting to see how this evolves.
This can hit $4-$5 very soon. And settle between $3-5. If they cannot improve their business this will stay here. Look at $BIGC lmaoooo bag holders forever !
Hang in there longs. BIGC will have a solid quarterly report. It’s a little SHOP in the making. Amazon bringing it down today. Shopify had a great report this week. Shopify and BigC have incredible business models - supporting business.
Can anyone explain why it’s down on this earnings report though? What was negative?
Expecting big things after hours!!!!
Everyone holding since the bottom!! We have been blessed!!!
Sold at 58.20 bought it back at 57.97 earlier today. X 1000 shares why? Just to lower cost average on my holdings a little. Full disclosure long Bigc. I Was worried I lost it. I will not try to juggle Bigc again. Not these 1000 shares.
So over bought

MIKE WILLIAMS hahahahhhahahahahahahhha
Way under value. Can’t believe only small groups are picking up the stock at this price. Below 60?
Let’s go bigc 
"Amazon (1.81T market cap), Walmart (395B market cap), Mercado Libre (77B market cap), everyone wants to be associated with BIGC. This will be 200-300 in 1-2 years."
"Ya we all thought this was going to be a Shopify. Blunder! Looks like FOUR is expanding their platform faster, and thats not even their primary service."
Red day again…
Standing like a solid rock … all other stocks are dark red
"Hey William, Mike, Mike Williams, institutions own 72% insiders own 16%…….that’s 12% for general public. Which institution are you working for??? I’ve noticed you on a lot of other stocks. Your always negative and shorting….so again which institution are you working fir????"
I need this to 
BigCommerce (BIGC) to Offer $300M in Convertible Senior Notes
Institutions trading within themselves driving the little guy out. Sorry but I’m here for the next five years.
Anyone holding since 50’s?!?
This is going to $100 fast 
It is one horrible stock for sure. It’s volatility has hedge funds written all over it.
Just grabbed another 1000 shares as earnings are sure to pop in this ecommerce work from home BOOM!
BigCommerce is up 7.42% to 71.66
BigCommerce is up 7.13% to 66.44
I think these earnings are strong.. higher revenue growth than in Q2/20
$70 in 2 weeks or less as earnings are sure to be better than expected. Im loading up!!
Love the partnership with Mercado Libre. Go BIGC!
When will we cross $70 again?? Can’t wait
When is this likely to go to $1000 ?
BIGC heading up! Should see $80+ after next earnings. Load up and GLTA!
Eventually they will keep increasing revenue and the valuation will follow
I’m holding everything!!! Great news! It shook out a few weaklings in the afternoon but it’s heading higher again. People are claiming aboard !
Next stop may be 44-46.00 if so I’ll grab 500 more will c
It literally break a new low every day while other e-commerce stocks are up?
Ouch! What a drop.
Any bag holder? Still over valued
Just close above $70 come on
"When companies announce quarterly earnings earlier than scheduled, it usually means a surprise in numbers. Could be in for some really good news."
Simple question… Why?
Big day
Big things happening 
Can Amzn just freaking buy the company and get it over with. I am sick and tired of this junk.
SHOP 70.6% held by institutions
Earnings was good. It’s down. It’s unbelievable that these crooks control the market as they pleases. With great expectations and good earnings. This should be at 80 already. Still holding.
"Weak hands jumping ship. As soon as the volume goes down, BIGC will return to its upward trajectory."
Easy money
Missed eps revenue up but not enough to compensate eps missed
I may of made a big mistake. E-commerce stocks are struggling. Hmmm
"Always the stairway up, escalator down. "
Please something positive for once
These crooks just won’t give it a rest. Keep shorting this stock to steal our shares. If u are out there reading … don’t fall for the tricks. They are crooks. I am still holding my shares @67.50 average. Not selling.
Should be in the $70s!!
1000 shares long here sell 4-500.00
"70+ this week and 80+ next week.Easy $$,$$$"
Let us go
Ugh wow
LSPD TO BUY BIGC
"This will be at $275 on October 26th, 2023. Not any crazier then all the other posts, hey Williams!"
Undervalued !! Easy money
Hits numbers and goes down. Happens all the time with this company
Looks like this stock is toast.
"All I know is I doubted chase Coleman in Shopify and I learned my lesson, we ain’t selling"
"12 days till earnings in in it.I’ll sell around 500-1,000.00 3/5 years"
Had hope this was going to reach 70. Not sure it will reach it any time soon.
"Good revenue growth, gross margin 80%"
See this board has really dried up. Interesting that in the last few weeks institutions have increased their holdings from 72% to 74.3%.
Ugh get back to $70 please
"I truly not understand the SP for this stock! it's like a clown circus, no sense at all "
Amzn and Shop keeps breaking new high. Why this one is dropping? What the heck is happening? It should be at 70 or above already.
$80 after hours
https://discord.gg/u9mm4je
Down for no reason every day. Should be at $100 a share.
Great report.  I know that some people sell but they will regret it because it will go up much higher soon after…
Time to get back on the BandWagon!
Great partnership with AMZN to integrate with multi-channel fulfillment app which allows its US merchants to more easily fulfill their e-commerce orders. This opens up a whole a new space for BIGC to grab marketshare from ETSY and Shopify......Huge..... huge....huge!
Never bet on ER
"$TSLA in just one day cross 10 billion dollar market cap, I have seen lot SPACS those have 10 billion mc without any revenues . With y/y 40 percent revenue and cheapest #$%$ in the market and close competitors to $SHOP it deserve market cap of at least 10 billion. For 10 billion the price for share would be around $140 but still cheap .. lot of upside potential"
Mike Williams saying big boys were selling. Chase Coleman is the kobe Bryant of the stock market. He still holds the position. What you talking about
This is over reaction once again! Only weak players be selling anyway. I was so sick of Mike Williams comments. Muted. Awww that’s better!
Back in
Always falls after earnings.
This is not Shopify but I had 300 shares if it......and sold at 76 and 125 a share....yes you do the math. Left alot on the table......not this time.
Relief is coming !Ok this news got the attention of investors. Big News. We’re looking at $80 real soon.
Just loaded up. Earnings will be phenomenal. Expect this to trade close to the 80s when they hit it out of the park! I see green in my sleep boys and girls.
"I'm holding 1000 shares, I've been hoping to see this company hit revenue growth rate numbers that surpass Shopify but they just don't appear to be scrappy or innovative enough. I was able to sell some over-priced calls at the end of the session, I'll rinse and repeat until I'm out of this company."
Where will bigcommerce use these funds raised by Ossining these convertible notes? Hopefully not executive pay.
is $BIGC buying BLIN?
No reason for this. I can not find any news at all
looking for strong guidance with the new partnerships announced during this past quarter !
why is BIGC up?
management seems determined to blow up call option holders right before expiry almost every month.
even with good news the stock doesn't move
Loaded even more. Will come back next year.
So sad
Stay bullish on bigc …
Dan is a good guy!
"Wasn't sure how this would open today. They paid a lot of money for a company with only $19M in sales-so would not have been surprised if it opened weak. These types of acquisitions are very difficult, in my opinion, to evaluate."
they are in growth- this is second partnership after Walmart. its going to be again 160- hold tight
The offering won’t even happen until 2026. Can we chill out and work with what we got first? The CEO of the company should release that they are talking to Amzn about merging…in 2030. Only talks can make one stock up or die. Then l guess it does not matter anymore. Just make the announcement.
Buying opportunity. This stock will be $80 before the end of the year. The only problem now is few people understand their technology. That will be resolved in time.
"If 61.50 will not hold, we will see 56; if 56 will not hold, then we can be again for a ride down to 41, and below if markets turn sour, we can even get to see the mid to high 20s... :) I will be adding, in any case, a few more lots on anything below 50. This is the only ""tech"" company that I am holding and not trading it, doing both sides of the options, to collect premiums and lowering the cost base on anything that I get assigned on the put side."
They had some interesting insights about BIGC on (http://Multistockalerts.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
stock should be 243$
The lower they go the more I buy!!!! These guys are gonna be ripe for a major buyout in a couple years.
"BIGC... Prime candidate for a buy out from the likes of FB, who is already using them to process FB and Insta commerce"
Volatility. What a great way to make $ in the market.
Unreal. Why the dip???? Lol what ever I did buy it over 5 1/2 points cheaper. Can never time the bottom or the top
It is history of last 3 earnings always go south.
"2Q represented another quarter of accelerating subscription revenue growth (up 42%)and enterprise ARR was impressive with 54% y/y growth. We believe the companyis making strong progress with enterprise and $2K ACV demand monetization, PSRrevenue was ahead of expectations and we are bullish on a growing set of upsidedrivers. While Feedonomics provides an incremental boost to our revenue estimates,guidance reflects a modest increase in the pre-acquisition revenue business. Werecommend buying the stock on an expanding set of growth drivers. Raisingestimates and PT to $90"
2016 ..SHOP was trading in the 40's ....!
No sorry I made 850! Lol
It means the 8 percent drop today is exact of 300 m to market cap. Ah is over sold. Flat Tom. But def insider trading to have it fall exactly right. In my opinion. I bought 250 ah to bal out my 1000 today I picked up at .90 all good I’ll make money on this if I want to sell in the fall.
Buyout by shopify coming soon
report doesnt look bad at all
This is going to fly 120 in few weeks
They have been on the upward with numbers but yet still see the stock sliding
"BIGC: what an opportunity today. This was once $162. It has delivered great Q2 results. SHOP is 190 billion market cap, BIGC a meagre 4.4 billion. The growth potential is insane"
Likely to show 40 levels again near earnings day
Tanking bad
Ugh
Looks like I’m a baggie . September months baggies are made 
I want $80 now let go!
Bigc really?????? I jist got you back and you are doing this to me already???
Let’s get back to $70s!!
Bigcommerce teams with AMAZON!!!!!!!!!
49 million in revenue and a 5 billion market cap . This is a dump pile of a stock. Trade it with day trades. This won’t be back to all time highs for years to come
Back to $70 next ER. Got rid of weak hands.
"Reading the ER transcript and recent PR, BIGC has had over 30% growth for the last 6 quarters, and they have numerous strategies in place to keep growing their market. The Feedonomics acquisition will greatly benefit their omnichannel focus, which is expected to be a $41 billion market by 2024. Plus, they are aggressively hiring for their expanding international market. Very impressive results. I'm happy to keep holding."
With no volume. Still dipped 2 points. Where is the logic in this?
Looking for the reason to watch this going down every day since last week? Any ideas?
I am in for 2200 shares @76. God knows when will I be able to get out of this stock?
"No reason to drop, it’ll rebound"
