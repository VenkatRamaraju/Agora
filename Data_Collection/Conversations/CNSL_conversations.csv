I'm still predicting CNSL will be bought out by either Charter or private equity.
Maglan capital putting pressure on CNSL to buy back some of their bonds and get the share price up.
"As far as a shareholder lawsuit relating to the elimination of the dividend, you have no case.But insider trading charges are a whole different story. Volume exploded over the previous 6 trading days.Somebody knew, & it wasn't retail investors.[URL=http://www.imagebam.com/image/f717de1205296324][IMG]http://thumbs2.imagebam.com/5f/e6/df/f717de1205296324.jpg[/IMG][/URL]"
Funny no lawsuit.
higher highs higher lows. trending in the right direction. Stop complaining enjoy the ride
"The case for Consolidated Communications (NASDAQ:CNSL) is much like that of CBB before its sale to Brookfield: hard to see at first glance. Both stocks looked to have a dangerous combination of high leverage and low growth.Indeed, Consolidated closed 2019 with nearly $2.3 billion in borrowings net of cash; its current market capitalization is just over $500 million. Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) declined almost 3% in 2019, and is guided roughly flat in 2020.But both companies have fiber which may be more valuable than near-term earnings suggest. Indeed, looking at the valuation assigned Cincinnati Bell in its agreed-to sale, Consolidated could be worth as much as $20 per share. The stock closed Friday at $6.30, even after gaining 26% on Thursday following the fourth-quarter earnings report.Those gains might lead some investors to believe that the easy money has been made. But CNSL traded at $12 as recently as April, before the company eliminated its dividend to focus on deleveraging. Meanwhile, CBB went from a low under $4 to its current $12. If CNSL is similar on that basis, too, there’s a lot of upside remaining."
hmmmm interesting...
This will be higher tomorrow!
"Buyout coming with $65 billion broadband handed out from the govt. Even if they are not bought, CNSL will get a nice chunk of the 65."
"Consolidated Communications Holdings, Inc. CNSL provides telecommunications services to business and residential customers in the United States. The company currently has a Zacks Rank 2 and a beta of 0.83. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings increased 21% over the past 60 days. The stock’s expected earnings growth rates for the current and next quarter are a superb 20% and 33.3%, respectively."
"Cincinnati Bell owns approx owns approximately 16,500 route miles of fiber optic network; Consolidated owns approximately 37,000 route miles of fiber optic network— for those interested in a value determination."
"Try this dividend stock (Ticker symbol: CNSL) with consisted & sustainable dividend of $0.387 per quarter from 2005 to present time. Last price of $9.80 as of March 1,2019."
"So long 5's, was fun while it lasted...........LOL"
Great earnings report PLUS 10% of float was SHORT.
I bought this after they cut the dividend. They are in the right sector for upturn in price. Will hold and look for $12. Maybe wishful thinking but time will tell!
"Big drop so far. I know the price is way too low, at least in my opinion. And maybe that is the problem, the price has gotten so cheap that it has fallen off the charts and nobody sees it. I don't know what is going to happen to CNSL, I am hoping to be pleasantly surprised in the end."
It managed to hold onto the big gains from yesterday (Thursday) & even add a couple pennies.Hoping this is a positive sign going forward. Full Disclosure:Shares: 1500Cost Basis: $5.23Gain/Loss: -$463.40. -5.91%
"Great long term hold from down here. As costs come down and debt reduced, business will be more and more profitable."
No one sees the value in a Company that is PROJECTED to loose less money in the comming quarters and still is posting a 35% dividend 4 months after the DIVVY was cancelled! I don't see the issue.
here we go all the way to 8
"About 2 weeks away from another quarterly earnings report. I've stated this before, & I'll state it again, the key to a turnaround for the company, & hopefully the stock price, is the top line (revenues) Go to this page https://ycharts.com/companies/CNSL/revenuesThe default time period shown is 5 years. Notice the peak for 1/4 revenues was the September 1/4 of 2017 hold your pointer over that peak & it will show you revenues were 363 million. Move the pointer to the right, & you'll see in the most recent 1/4, revenues were 333 million. When I last stated this, someone here replied with something like this. “Big deal, revenues are only down $30 million” That's not the right way to look at it. If you apply that 30 million over one year (4 quarters) it equals 120 million. Before you move your pointer to the thumbs down button because you don't like what I've pointed out, do one more thing. Above the revenue chart, change the setting from 5 years, to 1 year.This, not manipulation, is the reason shares have gone from 13+ to $3.50 over the last 12 months. Until revenues go up, or at least stabilize, I don't see any substantial improvement in the share price. The elimination of the dividend freed up a lot of cash, what they do with that cash will determine the future of the company. We can only hope they're competent enough to make it work at some point."
"https://gvtimes.com/2019/05/27/is-it-time-for-these-stocks-to-shine-consolidated-communications-holdings-inc-cnsl-and-bruker-corporation-brkr/ It is expected that in Jun 2019 quarter CNSL will have an EPS of $-0.09, suggesting a 18.18% growth. For Sep 2019 is projected at $-0.07. It means that there could be a 36.36% growth in the quarter. Yearly earnings are expected to rise by 40.48% to about $-0.25. What is there not to like?"
Tried to enter conference call...no luck.
This company might well be the Rodger Dangerfield of the stock market. It just don't get no respect!!

"CNSL Replacement: I'm not sure if I'll need to harvest my losses on CNSL this year ?Also not sure that if/when I do, I want to take the proceeds & invest in a company in the same sector ? But unlike CNSL, this looks like a good one.https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CCOI?p=CCOIFull Disclosure: I have no position in the stock, I discovered it while researching CNSL.Do your own research to see for yourself."
"Very glad I am doing home work, no dividends now! I was about to drop the hammer on buying, sorry to those who lost and congrats on any that made some."
Looking good longs and the dividend is coming up. Look for further upswing.
"I have Consolidated as my internet, tv, and landline provider. I own 25,000 shares of their stock with a basis of around $5/share. When they paid a dividend and were trading at $25, it was a great investment. Now they are one of the biggest dogs in my portfolio. They are the worst run company of all the telecommunications/internet companies operating in the US. The CEO and his management teams have redefined incompetence, and the company's Investor relations person is a total moron or idiot -- take your choice. I'm just praying that CNSL will be bought out by a bigger entity. They are already partnering with ATT for TV services; so I'm hoping that company buys them out -- not that ATT is a great company, just a bigger fish. In any case, shareholders should lean on the CEO and BoD to push for a sale. It's the only this that could salvage the company and its workers. Otherwise, bankruptcy due to incompetence is imminent."
Time to re-start dividends. SP would really jump then
"seems to be holding the line at roughly nine ... what to do with my 4 dollar ante, is it time to go? I just don't know...."

"Something doesn’t feel right with this one. Logic says this company is in the right industry and the earnings report should be good, so why is this trading at a 4 month low?I’m long 3k shares that I just picked up last week at about a $5 average but I was expecting more of a run up pre-earnings."
I wouldn't worry about declining sales if those sales are low margin revenue. It appears they are doing the right thing by boosting internet and business type sales.
"Well this is certainly a nice start to the new year. Let's see if it continues, or if it turns out to be nothing more than a dead cat bounce."

"The consistent down days between the Searchlight announcement and the earnings release have been painful. The earnings revealed nothing terrible and was in fact quite positive and shows that management continues to do as they say they will. Now with significant liquidity in hand, no near term maturities to worry about and a plan to invest in growth - finally- in most markets where they are the sole player or one of two, means that there is meaningful upside as they deliver especially if they can keep the cost per home as low as they’ve indicated. Yes, the dilution was significant and painful but it was the medicine needed to put CNSL on this growth track. These nearly daily declines are largely on below average volume as there has been little support. Still, large institutional ownership remains in place as there has not been any notable selling from this group. (At least not disclosed in filings)A lack of insider buying is a concern as that would demonstrate real confidence in their plan. Absent this, I believe the downside risk is limited given the disastrous performance over the past two months coupled with the removal of key obstacles and a funded plan for growth."
"Wells Fargo: CNSL: Q4 2017 Results Summary; Call @ 11AM ET: Fritzsche/Wells FargoQ4 2017 RESULTS SUMMARY: CNSL reported Q4 total revenue and Adjusted EBITDA of $356MM and $133MM vs. our estimates of $355MM and $135MM. Commercial and carrier revenue was $152.0MM, ahead of our $150.5MM, and consumer revenue was $140.3MM vs. our $140.7MM. CNSL grew data and transport services revenue to $84.7MM, +1.4% y/y and vs. our $84.4MM, but was offset by declines in voice services ($55.6MM, -5.9% y/y), and other ($11.7MM, -1.4% y/y). CNSL added 280 on-net buildings, an increase of 11.6% y/y, bringing the total to 9,062. Consumer broadband revenue was $63.5MM, and grew +0.3% y/y, but was offset by the decline in video revenue (-6.4% y/y) and voice services (-9.8% y/y). CNSL lost -12.2K consumer customers in Q4 vs. our -12.0K est., and consumer ARPU was $69.66, down -1.1% seq., but up 0.8% y/y. The company lost -2.2K video connections vs. our -1.3K est., and data and internet connections effectively remained flat seq. CNSL received $8.0MM in wireless distributions in Q4 vs. our $7.5MM est., and ended 2017 with $30MM in total. Q4 capex was $61.9MM vs. our $65MM est., Adj. FCF was $42.5MM (vs. our $42.0MM) and dividend payout ratio was 64.6%, in line with our 64.4% est.PROVIDED 2018 GUIDE: CNSL expects cash interest expense $123-128MM, cash taxes $1-3MM, and capex $235-245MM.BOTTOM LINE: While EBITDA was a bit lower (due to wireless distribution, outside its control) - revenue (within its control) was better than our estimate and just shy of Street consensus. Most importantly the commercial and carrier segment was better than expected. CNSL's dividend payout ratio in the low-to-mid 60% range remains the lowest of the RLECs. While CNSL's dividend is first use of cash, it is not shying away from investing in the network (evidenced by speed increase to 500K locations in FRP region). This is a (big time) differentiator to other RLECs that have had to abandon their dividends completely."
Can someone explain to me how this company pays out $1.55/share in dividends when they don’t make enough to support it?
I like this one
"I also bought more early at $8.88. My thought to average down and buy 1,000 shares, but chickened out and only picked up 500. CNSL all in all is a good company and is going to turn around."
Could prison time be in the future for some CNSL executives? Only time will tell.
"Affectionately known as “The Angel Number”, the number 888 is a symbol of abundance and positivity in numerology. When you notice this number appearing often, be prepared for an overwhelming amount of goodness coming your way. ... Therefore, the power of this number is increased threefold when it presents itself as 888.LOL!"

Totally unexceptable and gives a bit of a shining light on the way management works. if they treat their customers this way you can see why investors are treated with such disregard."
Looks like things are turning around for CNSL. Lots of impressive reports on additional project and internet expansion and increase of speed as well. I was really surprised when the stock price broke though the 9 dollar figure . The company is in the right place and right time to really forge ahead. The volume is not setting the world on fire but I for one would not be surprised to see some buyout people doing some serious inquires into this guy.

"I totally understand the pain from surprisingly eliminating the dividend, as I, too, was caught off-guard. But seriously, they are trading below book value of 5.76. They are not headed for bankruptcy people, c'mon!

I know the loss of the dividend hurts, but let's put our big boy hats on and look at the long term strategy! I'm onboard with Wells Fargo Upgrade with a price target of $8.

Zack's up their earnings estimate for this on 10/1. While I don't really like Zack's sometimes they're correct in their estimates. I think this is a hedge shorting from the high 4's then buying in lower and moving it back to the same level. This is probably the fourth time it has been done!

"Trading @ $6.66How fitting :)Things 'might' be looking up. Here in south-central Minnesota, it looks like they're upgrading (in the town I live in) to try and compete with charter spectrum. I've had Charter for over 20 years now. Great tech-support, both over the phone and in person, but I'm not happy with the way they've gradually taken away channels, while the price continues to rise. If the upgrades are successful, and they can give me a better deal than Charter, I'd be willing to give them a try. One thing they absolutely have to correct is in home technical support. I know 5 people who use Consolidated, all live within 100 mile radius. They all agree that when there's a problem, the technicians are professional and get the job done. The problem, sometimes it takes up to a week for them to get there.People will only put up with that for so long.As an investment, I really have no opinion on CNSL. I own 160 shares in my IRA and I'm down about 30%April 25th will mark two years since they eliminated the dividend. Money put in the S&P 500 at that time would have returned 40%, while CNSL lost 40%For those who had a large position, & held throughout this fiasco, the question becomes....How long do you wait ?"
Most of the dividend drop was bounded back. Pure profit. This is a keeper.

"Yesterday, Maglan Capital authored an analysis and commentary on Consolidated Communications (CNSL).The publication can be found on Seeking Alpha PRO at the following link: https://seekingalpha.com/article/4131078-consolidated-communications-case-baby-thrown-bathwater-pt-25-plus The analysis argues for a $25+/share value, which is 100% higher than the current share-price.• Stock worth $25+ versus $12.33 and should yield 6% instead of juicy 12.5%. An incredible dividend yield while waiting for fair value.• Dividend payout ratio of just 57%. Trades at ~4.95x FCF of $2.50 per share and at 5.75x EBITDA of $550mm per annum versus historical 7-9x.• Leverage below 4x and should drop to 3.5x over time.• Best operator in RLEC space. And this is not your grandma's RLEC. Early 2017 FairPoint acquisition doubles CNSL’s scale while generating material synergies.• CNSL insiders recently bought additional stock."
"Even with a miss, downside is limited at these levels. I added again today."
"All remember: CNSL has 37,000 ROUTE MILES OF FIBER; CBB has only 16,500 Route miles. If the latter is worth almost 3 billion, the former is worth 4.5 Billion, minimum."
"Hard time getting to the web cast also. Finally got on and heard from the first guy; all rosy, HIP HIP HURRAY and all that, everything going up. Increase this, increase that, and then when the next guy talked about finance it seamed to be a different story. Most of his comments seamed to be related to the inhouse expenses and seems like managements outlay costs cut profits down. Somebody needs to take a closer look ( in my opinion) INTO the finance department's PAYMENTS and PROGRESS!! How can a company that SHOWS a .78 cent year profit and only has a little over a $5 dollar stock value. After the speakers of the presentation were finished and the question and answer session came up; only one call came in and they had to wait a while to get that one. I for one was not impressed and the board needs to look hard at the FINANCIAL PORTION OF THIS COMPANY AND IMPROVING IT."
Good Conf Call.
Anyone have an opinion on this? Hold or sell before earnings? Been holding out for a comeback.. Can’t decide if it will ever come.
I see CNSL over 5 by week end. Great increase in earnings!
This should triple by end of year. When they get rid of their dividend payouts they will have over 71 mill in excess cash! Holding this baby for a while. Communications is a booming industry!

"I have been here since just after the pulling of the dividend - (current avg is 4.10 ) Picked this up back then on a bit of a whim that the dividend might eventually be restored. I do think this a crappily run and managed company with HORRENDOUS customer care... but I still hold it simply on the fact that they have a LOT of gold (or more truthfully Silicon Dioxide) buried in polyethylene sheathing running for miles and miles and miles!!!.... I am also surprised that there is simply no stream of activity here (comments???) - ESPECIALLY as this has basically doubled in SP in 4.5 months... Why so sleepy here? is this hot? where can it go? any ""solid"" rumors? any Short opinions? this board is simply no fun at all."

"Interesting. Maintaining the very nice dividend yield for yet another quarter. That's either really good news or really bad, what do you people think? Putting on a brave face while things get worse or a decent indicator of increasing future revenue expectations?"
I'm not complaining as I am long CNSL with lots of shares. Just wondering if any info on why up so much so far today? - I know it's early.
"In spite of what some others here say, revenues matter!This is the 1st time since mid 2017 that we didn't see a sequential drop in quarterly revenue. It's plain to see that 'the street' likes that."

"Insiders knew they were going to squash the dividend abruptly, triggering panic selling from the little guys... eventually making the stock dirt cheap for later acquisition. The reality is this company still generates over a Billion dollars a year in revenue. Insiders and smart investors are going to start gobbling this up, especially after they decide to “all of a sudden” bring back a dividend"
Looks like some people took the money and ran this morning..
Starlink will have within a year global internet service! CNSL will be worse off if the company isn't sold soon!
Are they going to buy back some of their bonds? If not we need new management!
"prolly a dumb question ... for the recent decade (roughly) where CNSL traded consistently above say 14 bucks, and was paying a sizeable dividend... what has materially changed (besides dropping the dividend) about this company. I get that management is a bunch of bozos, but has not the intrinsic company value (assets and capabilities) increased? is there not more clients? more miles of fiber? I don't get it!! with the huge dividend liabilities off the books and that money now being used to pay down debt and to make investments #$%$ is going on here.. I would think that the SP should at least be in the 14 dollar range.. Have they sold off assets ? This is a sweet spot industry with remote workers on the increase and the carrying of 5G data on their fiber links.. why?? Is it just the #$%$ management?? or is this company just toxic beyond all repair?? I am in with a current average of 4 bucks.. and the recent run has been great. is it time to collect my chips?? I have stop loss and profit trigger points actively in place - but nothing makes sense with this one..."

Both TV & Internet were out for 3 days in a small town near me. It turned out to be nothing more than a broken wire in the main distribution box for the town.The problem is, why did it take them 3 days to figure it out, and/or get there to fix it ?3 hours is one thing, but people get very upset when it's out for 3 days.The other thing is ridiculous wait times when you have a problem with equipment in your home. I've heard of cases where they say they can't get there for over a week. That's not acceptable.I've also heard similar things in other parts of the country.People will not tolerate that, at least not for long.

"The case for Consolidated Communications (NASDAQ:CNSL) is much like that of CBB before its sale to Macquerie: hard to see at first glance. Both stocks looked to have a dangerous combination of high leverage and low growth.Indeed, Consolidated closed 2019 with nearly $2.3 billion in borrowings net of cash; its current market capitalization is just over $500 million. Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) declined almost 3% in 2019, and is guided roughly flat in 2020.But both companies have fiber which may be more valuable than near-term earnings suggest. Indeed, looking at the valuation assigned Cincinnati Bell in its agreed-to sale, Consolidated could be worth as much as $20 per share. The stock closed Friday at $6.10, even after gaining 26% on Thursday following the fourth-quarter earnings report.Those gains might lead some investors to believe that the easy money has been made. But CNSL traded at $12 as recently as April, before the company eliminated its dividend to focus on deleveraging. Meanwhile, CBB went from a low under $4 to its current $14.75. If CNSL is similar on that basis, too, there’s a lot of upside remaining"
gonna be a good day today
Love how they announce dividend so far in advance. Also love how the shorts jump on this thing. Perfect storm.

"For future reference: This is a perfect example of why you have to do your own due diligence when investing in the stock market. Don't trust any of these research firms. That being said, hopefully Consolidated can put the money that they saved by eliminating the dividend to good use and turn the company around. Mar 31, 2019 | 02:00 PM EDTFor the next few years, at least until national 5G networks are built out, odds are Consolidated will see its consumer business leak subscribers at a modest rate for voice and video services. With EBITDA margins of 34%-38% over the last few years, the company's operating cash flow is sizable enough to fund its dividend payments and allow it to acquire other businesses to drive its revenue and profits higher.Some may view Consolidated's business of consumer and commercial connectivity as humdrum, but customers in both areas should keep the dividend checks coming.https://realmoney.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/this-high-yielding-stock-keeps-the-dividend-checks-coming-14911977?_ga=2.171170464.1431282134.1560400324-168878500.1560400324"

Zayo goes private (https://finance.yahoo.com/news/eqt-digital-colony-agree-buy-130439978.html) Next step for CNSL is to do the same - they dropped the dividend to spend down the long term debt to attract private equity for a buyout. This is the endgame

"Wells Fargo Securities analysts recently attended the company’s third annual TMT Summit in Las Vegas, and left with a number of takeaways regarding the connectivity space.“We learned much and have greater conviction that 2020 will be one of the most interesting years for your space!” Wells Fargo Senior Analyst Jennifer Fritzsche said. “(Here) are some of the key bigger picture theme and takeaways from what we learned in the City of the Lights (on this side of the pond).”5G is on a ’10-Year Investment Cycle” and Private Wireless Solutions Will Play a Big RoleWells Fargo projected that the wireless industry is in the “early innings” of a potentially decade-long investment cycle. “We expect 2020 to be the first year where we see ‘real developments'” Fritzsche said.Meanwhile, infrastructure providers plan to see carriers spending heavily, especially when more mid-band spectrum becomes available- such as Sprint’s 2.5 GHz spectrum, CBRS, and C-Band According to Wells Fargo, infrastructure providers also believe the T-Mobile-Sprint merger approval will be healthy for the industry. The need for private wireless solutions and the role that shared spectrum (CBRS) will play was also discussed. Wells Fargo explained that the initial amount of shared spectrum in the U.S. made available through CBRS would equal as much as any single carrier currently uses.Fiber Build Activity is Broadly Stronger to Service Multiple Use CasesThe TNT Summit also featured a strong focus on accelerating fiber build activity across numerous businesses silos like 5G cell sites, fiber-to-home and business fiber. According to Wells Fargo, Verizon has deployed 1,900 route miles of fiber- just in October. Their carrier also stated approximately 90 percent of its 5G cell sites are directly located on its own fiber. Meanwhile, AT&T has slowed its fiber spend after reaching 14 million fiber homes in the middle of the year. However, the company continues to spend on fiber densification in select markets to support its wireless business. According to Wells Fargo, CenturyLink has been deploying is fiber to extend its network in order to move more of its traffic online to generate owners’ revenue.“While fiber spending from the cable companies have been slower in FY2019, we continue to believe cable companies will need to spend on scalable infrastructure and line extensions to add additional capacity in the networks” Fritzsche said."
ATTN Danny: Have you talked to Johnathan Charbonneau 'recently' ? We're still waiting for the upgrades from Cowen & Company & others.
CNSL is grossly incompetent! Just spoke with them stating a new fiber cable was put in 75 fret from house on the same telephone pole that carries everything else. They are telling me its not there. I spoke with the subcontractor installing it and said it was indeed high speed fiber optic and that CNSL doesn't know what they're doing on their making of the area. Glad I sold all of my shares at a small profit as they're a total joke operation.

"Raymond James- CNSL: FairPoint Turnaround on TrackRating: Strong Buy 1 | Target Price: $20.00SummaryWe are maintaining our Strong Buy rating on Consolidated Communications following 1Q results. We continue to believe Consolidated has more stable business and broadband revenue and a superior dividend payout ratio vs. peers. We believe operations at FairPoint should improve post-rebranding and broadband expansion, which is off to a positive early start.Consolidated upgraded 62,000 former FairPoint homes in 1Q18 on its path to ~500,000 upgrades by year end. The company is essentially tripling the available speeds to these homes with penetration levels only at 15% vs. legacy Consolidated closer to 35%. Despite only beginning this process in late 1Q, management called out a noticeable increase in order activities already, which we view positively.Uses of capital. We believe management views its dividend as sacred and has no intention of cutting it regardless of current trading yield. With ~70% payout ratio, we believe the positive trend in revenue and FCF from FairPoint markets as well as the higher Verizon wireless distributions argue for maintaining the full dividend.Looking out to the next positive catalysts for the company, we would continue to call out the potential to remove the overhang from the Windstream trial in 3Q as well as the 500,000 upgraded FairPoint homes, which we believe the company can get at least 10% incremental penetration from. The commercial data segment continues to be a positive revenue contributor.CNSL trades at ~5.5x and ~5.7x our 2018E FCF/share and EBITDA, with a 14% dividend yield, below its peer group, which has seen multiples pull back to ~6x, ~6x, and ~9%, respectively, and below its historical trading multiples of ~10x, ~7.5x, and 6% yield."

While I agree complete elimination of dividend was unwarranted especially for individual investors this may be the necessary first step to make the company a more attractive take over candidate. But we will probably not see that possibility for at least two quarters provided management is good on its word and uses the savings to leverage down the debt. However, a good indicator is revenue per share which is very good at $19.81. All in all we are in for a long road ahead and it will be interesting to see if current management can withstand the increased ""calling for their heads""!"

"Fresh all-time lows today. Is it hedge fund manipulation as many here suspect, the beginning of the end (eventual chapter 11)or something else ? Stay tunedThe attraction of trying to catch a falling knife is very strong today, but I can't bring myself to do it.Those of you who are certain it's hedge fund manipulation, & will go back up in the following days, probably should.Disclosure: Total of 1500 shares purchased in April and May. Cost basis $5.23-$2,038.40 -25.99%"
I love the smell of short squezins in the morning..... smells.......... of money
What happened to the customer service problems hearing in Vermont? We’re getting excellent service here in NYS- Broadband roll going well and responsive customer service center.
are they going to sell?
"Own 4,500 shares in the low 20s and believe that I will never see the green side. I bought for the dividend, and now I have lost on both ends. Will it come back to at least $10? All I can do is hope I can get my loss 50%. Sad. sad investment. I thought I was better then this, but guess not."
"This stock should worth $12-$14. There are some very unhappy folks who will miss getting the $1.55 per year as dividend, but in the long run and provided company performs at current level, their estimated earnings per share should be around $1.10-$1.20 based on earnings of around -$0.40 for 2019, when dividend was in place....even with a 10 P/E value thsi should $11-$12 stock. Am I missing somethin ?"
"Here's why the value of fiber has grown 31% since 2015Crown Castle’s recent $7 billion purchase of Lightower shows that service providers that want to take advantage of the burgeoning small cell market are willing to pay a premium for fiber assets.Crown Castle, which has primarily served as a supplier of towers to the wireless industry has in less than two years transformed itself into a major fiber provider, purchasing three fiber operators: FiberNet, Sunesys and 24/7 Mid-Atlantic.Crown's aggressive acquisitions come as little surprise considering the company's whole-hearted focus on small cells,” said John Fletcher, principal analyst for Kagan, a media research group within S&P Global Market Intelligence, in a blog post.Kagan estimates that Crown Castle’s purchase of Lightower is the second most expensive per fiber-mile at $221,875 per fiber mile. Interestingly, Crown Castle’s recently completed acquisition of Southern California-based Wilcon was $315,789 a mile.But what’s even more telling is the overall growing pricing of fiber assets. According to Kagan, the average U.S. value per fiber optic mile passed has grown at a 31% CAGR since 2015 from $131,818 per mile in 2015 to an average of $227,139 per mile for the two deals so far in 2017.Crown Castle’s bet on small cell deployments is well grounded as the majority of the largest U.S. wireless operators are taking a fiber-based approach to wireless backhaul. One has to look no further than Verizon’s recent purchase orders for fiber with Corning and Prysmian.A key point of the acquisition is increasing fiber density. Crown Castle had 27,000 miles of fiber at the end of the first quarter of 2017 and the Lightower deal more than doubles that figure.Lightower owns or has rights to approximately 32,000 route miles of fiber located primarily in metro markets in the Northeast, including Boston, New York and Philadelphia. After the deal is completed, Crown Castle will own or have rights to approximately 60,000 route miles of fiber, with a presence in all of the top 10 and 23 of the top 25 metro markets.Fiber consolidation rampsCrown Castle’s deal for Lightower may be the latest, but it certainly won’t be the last. After being hatched by Rob Shanahan following the sale of Conversent Communications, Lightower was an aggressive fiber consolidator, buying up 7 companies since 2008.Some industry watchers speculated that Zayo, which has aggressively purchased a number of fiber providers over its 10-year history including most recently Electric Lightwave, could be a potential target.Wells Fargo postulated that Zayo could be attractive to a number of operator segments—including wireless operators, cable and tower providers—all for different reasons.“A tower operator could gain a growing footprint in the small cell space if it acquired ZAYO’s 126K fiber route miles,” Wells Fargo analysts wrote in a research note. “Cable operators could find ZAYO’s large enterprise customer base an effective means to move up the stack in the enterprise market. Finally, wireless carriers could seek to accelerate 5G network builds by acquiring a valuable portfolio of metro fiber assets (given that fiber is a key ‘ingredient’ in 5G architecture).”Given the density of Zayo’s domestic and international network holdings, the service provider could immediately be a good fit for any of the company types Wells Fargo mentioned.Fiber consolidation continues to be a reality of the telecom industry. Other notable pending and completed deals in the market include CenturyLink’s bid for Level 3, while Uniti is establishing its foothold by bolting on Hunt and Southern Light—two deals that give it further power in the eRate and wireless backhaul segments.Having built its Uniti Fiber unit from its acquisition of the former PEG Bandwidth and Tower Cloud, its likely Uniti will make more deals to bolster its fiber holdings.Meanwhile, small cell vendors like ExteNet Systems signed a deal to acquire Axiom Fiber Networks. ExteNet has been a bit cagey about its plans, but it appears to have a plan to serve the large-scale New York City market that’s expanding its small cell efforts. Sprint, for one, already uses ExteNet as one of its New York City small cell vendors. Smaller providers get aggressiveOutside of the larger deals, smaller providers that reside in Tier 2 markets should not be overlooked. These providers not only fill a gap with fiber assets for wireless operators that need to expand outside of the NFL cities, but also enhance consumer and business broadband services.Take LS Networks. Just this week, the Northwest provider announced it built fiber to over 500 towers in Washington and Oregon with plans to expand into California. By making these builds, LS Networks positioned itself to become a backhaul option for large wireless operators.No less compelling is FirstLight Fiber, a company that’s established itself as a regional consolidator. Over the past two years"
"Cash flow per share 4.70$ =(340M$ = 85M$x4)/72Mshares. At 3,4$ per share it is a bargain"
Management has to go. I'm betting Charter will buy them out for around $8.50/share
"Consistently beating the last couple of quarters, finally turning a profit after all the cuts to wages, jobs and general expenses. It seems that CNSL is finally ready to rebound. The long-term looks positive."
"ATTN Eric:About 3 weeks ago you asked……“what has materially changed (besides dropping the dividend) about this company”This might answer your question.https://ycharts.com/companies/CNSL/revenues Notice the big jump in revenues in 2018. That was the result of the 2017 acquisition of FairPoint communications. Notice that since that time, revenues have slowly drifted lower. In 2018, they offered low introductory rates to attract new customers.Around $80.00 per month for cable & DSL Internet. That has doubled to $160.00This tells me that a lot of those people who signed up because of the low introductory rates, have since dropped Consolidated.If they hadn't, the revenue chart wouldn't show the slow but steady decline.So you're right, as far as assets, it's the same company it was when it was $14 a share. But with no dividend, declining revenues, poor customer service, etc, I'm thinking it ‘might be’ overvalued @ this point.People can pump stocks, claim their undervalued, claim shorts are holding them down, etc. etc. etc.I don't believe that. For a companies stock to appreciate significantly, it has to grow (top line growth over long periods of time)Go back to that link I provided and enter stock symbols for companies who have done very well over the past 10 years.You'll see they all have one thing in common, consistent revenue growth."
"Too cheap down here to ignore. 57% payout ratio, leverage below 4x, stable ebitda at $550mm and a dividend at 11.5%. Stock will be back to $20+ soon enough IMO."
"If consolidated's fiber makes it a diamond in the rough, worth up to $20 as someone recently stated here, what is the acquiring company waiting for ?"
"When you have a CEO that says something as preposterous as this, should anyone be surprised that shares are trading around $5.00 ?“While we are pleased with the performance of the business, after careful consideration, our Board of Directors has elected to eliminate our dividend,” said Bob Udell, president and chief executive officer of Consolidated Communications""He's pleased with the performance, but decides to cut the dividend entirely.You simply can't make this stuff up!"
PE just entered the game paying 1.352B for 619MM of FTR.
One more push into mid-13's to jump on the juicy yield?
"Someone is going to buy this company. When they eliminated the dividend, they became profitable. Comcast, ATT …. will want this foot print. It's a steal at $20/share."
"It's comforting to know after reviewing the CNSL quarterly conference call transcript that CNSL management effectively doubled management bonuses while crushing investors with poor financial performance, a cratering stock and complete dividend elimination.Marc Berkowitz -- Aviva Investors -- AnalystOkay. So just to understand, if you can focus mostly on accrued compensation, that seems like the most area of variability in working capital. Was Q1 payments made this year and not last year? Is that what explains the difference?Steven Childers -- Chief Financial OfficerIt was higher --Marc Berkowitz -- Aviva Investors -- AnalystAgain, it looks like last year was a $4 million storage. This year was a $10 million use.Steven Childers -- Chief Financial OfficerWe paid a higher bonus in 2019 for '18 than we did the prior year."
I added to my position a few minutes ago.
"BidaskClub upgraded shares of Consolidated Communications (NASDAQ:CNSL) from a sell rating to a hold rating in a research report sent to investors on Thursday, BidAskClub reports."
I only have a few shares of this company but it looks to me like CNSL is in the right place at the right time. The only thing that could slow the growth and price gain of it; is the management itself. New people here could make all the difference.
"NOW I know why this company doesn't get any RESPECT!! THEY DON""T DESERVE ANY!!!!!! GET A NEW MANAGEMENT!!!!"
"Acquisition right around the corner. This spike is to enrich further the CEO and other top management who hold millions of shares right before they are bought out. Good for us shareholders who also own tens of thousands of shares and bought when the stock was worth nothing. I thought originally buyout at $8.50; now I'm thinking $10/share, and announcement around July 1, 2020."
"short squeeze may bring it up as high as 14....however, if in line, the price is already built in so 8.50.... risk -reward is quite obvious here (if they don't touch the dividend..."
Maglan Capital Delivers Letter to Consolidated Communications Board of DirectorsCalls Upon the Company to Repurchase Bonds to Retire Debt at a Meaningful Discount and Signal Confidence in the Company's SharesExpresses Serious Concerns with the Company's Troubling Share-Price Collapse and Excessive Cash Reserveshttps://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/maglan-capital-delivers-letter-to-consolidated-communications-board-of-directors-300623358.html
"Still here... This is still holding roughly 9 for about the last 30 days... I think I will set a stop loss at $7.97 and a sell trigger at 10.99 I have been here for a long time now with 4 buck avg ante.. somewhat waiting for a return of a dividend... I kinda don't think it will ever yield material income the way it used to. This holding has become ""boring"" but I am glad tho that it is back out of the doldrums."
Class action lawsuit time. SEC investigation pending soon!
"Slow company in a fast market... An old telco without dividend protection = high volatility risk. They do have some decent assets and plenty of market opportunities - just no performance, drive or excitement at the present time."
Zacks has CNSL as a buy.https://www.zacks.com/stock/chart/CNSL/broker-recommendations
Up/Dn....all depends on Aug 1st earnings
The lawsuit I'm sure is being drafted right now. seems it may have some legs since there was an intimation in management discussions that the dividend was safe.
Lets hope this relates to CTL aned their dividend cut. If CNSL cuts its dividend we are looking at a $7 stock.
Surprised that the PPS is struggling to approach $5 considering the recent earnings surprise.....
CBB (Cincy Bell) just bought out by Brookfield Infrastructure Partners for $ 2.6 Billion. Shorts better run for cover and stop playing with CNSL. CNSL is next up for acquisition by the infrastructure boys...
hopefully this momentum continues through the weekend and we see another great open
I was watching the volume ticking from 11 o'clock to 12 o'clock and was amazed that many of the trades were 1 and 2 shares at a time. This is the first time I saw anything like that.
"Whats really sad is CNSL bought North Pittsburgh Telephone and now its only worth dollars, my stepfather was on the board for NPT until his death in the 90's and my Step Grandmothers Father, McKelvey's started NPT.."
You need to pick a number where you can get out of this stock and not feel too bad about your poor decision to buy it in the first place (present company included). I have been hoping for a buyout but really that is probably a pipe dream. I think a buyer would opt for CenturyLink properties first. I am sure they are becoming more enterprise based and would love to get rid of the consumer side.
Apparently the union contract expires today. Is that correct?? Any thoughts out there on what size bounce we will get when the negotiations are wrapped up?
"The headline from Zacks (CNSL) Reports Q2 Loss, Tops Revenue Estimates………………………………once again reinforces my point that no one should listen to them, or any other equity research firms.RealityRevenues were $333.5 million, a decline of $16.7 million compared to the $350.2 million for the 2nd quarter of 2018.And once again, quarterly revenues were down sequentially. $338.6 million in Q-1, $333.5 million in Q-2This makes 8 consecutive quarters of declining revenues. 2017 Q-3: $363.32017 Q-4: $356.32018 Q-1: $356.02018 Q-2: $350.22018 Q-3: $348.02018 Q-4: $344.72019 Q-1: $338.62019 Q-2: $333.5https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/cnsl/revenue-epsNo matter how you slice it, that boy’s & girls, is a trend, & an ugly one at that.Full disclosure: 1,500.000 Shares Cost $5.23/ShareGain/Loss -$733.40 -9.35%Because I still believe they could turn things around, I'm going to hold.I may also need a loss write off later this year, so if it doesn't work out, I could still benefit.ATTN Danny: Have you talked to Johnathan Charbonneau 'recently' ? We're still waiting for the upgrades from Cowen & Company & others you said he told you about many months ago."
"Yes it is, and it shows the extreme accuracy of Zacks saying C N S L is one of the best dividend stocks to buy! They aren't just worthless but outright harmful!"
"I was in Roseville Telephone for a long time. Then, CNSL bought them and I got in but it was truely up and down. I have quite a few shares and waited a long time. I think we will come out ahead now."
it is the low volume ... with a little number of share it is easy to move the price down. The Friday approach
"Short interest starting to drop 11,170,400 down from 11,587,500. Earnings over and no strike. up we start to go"
Any predictions? who thinks this quarter will be different from the last three?
(CNSL): This company that provides telecommunications services to business and residential customers has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current year earnings increasing 6% over the last 60 days.
Ok I am adding tomorrow if it's still down. It didn't really sell off on earnings so why should it sell off today?
"Another day, another short sellers delight!"
I think the SEC should investigate the trading action here as it is being manipulated for sure!
