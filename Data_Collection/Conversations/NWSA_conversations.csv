NWSA at 20. I may faint. Plenty of upside on this breakout to all time highs
One more day to see $12's tomorrow.
Really strong volume in NWSA the past few days. 3x to 4x the volume of a few months ago. Something up. Are the Murdoch’s going to buy NWSA once they are cash rich from the Sale of FOX?
Nice to see NWSA management acknowledge the fact the the stock is trading at a huge discount to its sum of the parts. Talk is cheap so it would be nice to see them do something about closing the gap
When does NWSA spin off the realtor.com REA group biz? Has to be worth $10b at this point
"Is there a great investment publication NOT tied to News Corp, or any other biased publisher? I realized I need to cancel WSJ, I can't take the narrative any longer. Just looking for facts and focus. I cancelled Bloomberg a few months back, too, don't miss is at all. I was looking at Investor's Business Daily but it's another News Corp. publication so I have to assume it's full of bias. Best publication to escape bias for investors?"
Now NWSA gets an upgrade ?? At 26? I mean I’ll gladly take the upgrade but why not at 10?15?20?25?
What does NWSA plan to do with the $10 billion REA group investment ? Is it ever going to be spun off?
"To all investors looking for a legitimate platform to invest and make real profit.

"Reaction to Wall Street Journal Article: ""DACA Is Restored After Court Rules DHS Head Served Illegally""Another glaring example of judicial activism designed to thwart President Trump's ability to govern. President Obama created DACA by Executive Order lacking the ability to work with Congress. My understanding is that Executive Orders can be changed or cancelled by succeeding Administrations. That is until Donald Trump became President. Like many of his initiatives, lower court judges have obstructed the Executive Branch. It is high time for news organizations, including WSJ, do some soul searching. Will WSJ take bias out of its reporting or will it follow the path of most news media, ABC, NBC, CBS, MSNBC, NEWSY, Fox News and my local newspaper, The Chicago Tribune. These organizations purvey narratives that purport to contain facts. Frequently, they support conclusions the media arrived at. In what direction will WSJ go? Will WSJ demonstrate independence? Will WSJ express principled positions? As a US based worldwide news organization, will WSJ stand for America?"
"If Zillow does $170 million in quarterly EBITDA and is worth $40 billion, what is NWSA digital real estate services quarterly EBITDA of $142 million worth ? $20 billion? How can management continue to sit on its hands? How long must I sing this song? Thanks bono"
The NY Post could gain lots of readership for its honest reporting ( a rarity these days) ---especially digging up thr dirt on the Biden family.
It will drop 50% in one day
"NWSA finally started buying back stock. They Bought 5mn shares in October,still have $429 million of buybacks remaining of the $500 million authorization. Finally! It's a start. NWSa going to start consolidating foxtel and its $2.5 billion of revenues. Up to now foxtel has been completely nonexistent on NWSa's income statement"
"Almost Billion Share and loosing money, fair value $0.005"
When does Murdoch take nwsa private. The rea stake worth $5.5b now. Realtor.com could be worth a few billion. Current stock price is assigning a negative value on the remaining very profitable businesses
"To the powers to be at Fox News and Fox Business......I have been a viewer since day one.You have fallen to the left....why??? I could always depend on fox to get the true story. You have changed. I could always go to CNN, CNBC, MSNBC, for the censored versions. Your coverage of the election was so disappointing to me and many others.I changed to OAN and NEWS MAX. I will say good bye to my Fox family at a later date."
Dead money for seven years NWSA time to spin off REA and realtor as they are collectively worth more than NWSA at the moment
News is down 5.00% to 22.80
"Can someone explain why the volume and OI of Nov $13 PUTS is SO HIGH shown below? Just curious.NWSA181116P00013000 2018-11-07 1:46PM EST 13.00 0.30 0.25 0.30 0.00 - 377 67,490"
