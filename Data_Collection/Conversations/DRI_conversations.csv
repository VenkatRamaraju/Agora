Like I've been saying... this is way overpriced with current labor and cost of goods inflation. I see 124/share after next earnings report.
About to see a 15% drop this week
"The rapid increase in nationwide COVID infections and hospitalizations, combined with new public health restrictions limiting capacity convinced me to sell my DRI holdings. I plan to sit on the sidelines for a while and watch developments until the next opportunity to buy back in - good luck all."
"Here's how millenials shop nowadays...i know because I'm related to bunch of them.....They order 2 or 3 items online, see which one they like the most, go to Mall stores and return unwanted items. Crazy, but true. Ask your own relatives that are millenials....they're all doing it. So Mall traffic doesn't transcend to Mall purchases, mostly just convenient way to return items. just my observation....best to read retailer reports about mall vs online purchases and confirm for yourself. @Mark talks about long lines at restaurants, well if your establishment is restricted to 25-50% capacity, of course you're going to have long lines. Perhaps Google what Fauci and CDC said about in-store restaurant dining this week. Then go look at #DRI & #BLMN restaurant stock prices for Thursday and Friday. Don't let pumpers take up space in your brain. Research, research, research before investing.....and perhaps go to Malls and ask clerks how business is doing as far as actual sales and get their take on it. They're living it every day....if they say things are great and you don't see empty storefronts, perhaps it is time to buy. $18 BILLION a week has now disappeared via loss of $600 FED unemployment and doesn't look like a deal is in the works to extend it. Just a fraction of that money not going to Mall tenants is a retail apocalypse."
Another shutdown imminent... This will pull back for sure.
"I hope we get a nice correction, so I can buy more. The report was fine."
When does Darden report earnings?
"Wowzers, taking a fall. Passed my local Olive Garden and Longhorn last night....both were packed. We will see how earnings goes."
Last week they secure $750 million dollars in funding. BetBSU said ?Liquidity Solved? then they go out and sell an additional $400 million a week later and BetBSU says ?Liquidity Solved? okay dude. ?Management is likely shocked that there stock price is holding up this well and is saying ?let?s just sell shares now because it will be 5 years before we ever see a $60 stock price again. Kudos management. I bet they sold half those shares to BetBSU and they are laughing their #$%$ off. Lol
Mandatory vaccines to work for Darden.... talk about an employment nightmare.
Technically in the chart there are 2 major headwinds. 1. This $69 level is a triple top. Has failed the previous 2 times it got here and here is the 3rd attempt. 2. It’s about to run into the 50 Day moving average that it will need to close above. Anyone besides Bet BSU see any real catalyst that will cause it to break through? Cause I can’t find one.
The sec chart shows insiders sold a lot of shares on April 15 and continued to sell some more after that day then bought back some 75k shares from 8M shares of common stock offering that expired today? Why? Does this mean they didn’t get enough public buyers so they decided to buy the rest to avoid lower price offering? Let me know if anybody can explain this. https://www.secform4.com/insider-trading/940944.htm
LOL....back to all time highs after a year of gathering more and more debt.....and STILL not operating at full capacity!
12 minute wait on hold just to order a pick-up dinner for two at my Olive Garden. They may not be selling any alcohol.......but the kitchen is cooking lots of food. :-)
Loading up at this price
Great day to order Olive Garden for Dinner.....and $15 bottles of wine. Curbside pickup and a FREE kids meal with every adult meal ordered. Pick up the phone......keep Americans working. Tip generously. :-)
One of the most overvalued in the entire market.
is this the bottom?
Clowns back to posting again. For my $61k basis I'm getting over $7800 in annual dividends. DRI is doing great.
"same old pattern tho, nice quarterly results, stock price soars, Zacks raves, then bleeds on a daily basis. Tough one to figure out."
Their restaurants are empty the last few times I been to the malls around me. I’m getting nervous holding. Only down 8%. Should I sell?
"Be careful shorting this one, fellas. DRI was at $124 just a few months ago......and things aren’t as bad as you think. You may want to look at who’s buying the stock now. :-)"
"I guess reopening dine-in is not helping that much, still -47% down same store revenue https://www.marketwatch.com/story/olive-garden-parent-darden-restaurants-same-restaurant-sales-slide-479-in-q4-through-may-17-2020-05-19?siteid=yhoof2&yptr=yahoo"
"In a panic, people sell everything. They sell their ETFs that in turn must sell at any price to meet redemption requests. There is probably a ways to go before we get a complete wash out. Coronavirus cases in the US will go into the hundreds of thousands in the next week. You may be able to get Darden at a better price. $26.30 was the price a couple of days ago. :-)"
They sold 25k passes which changes traffic numbers and sales. ER in December will be good to push it up to 120?
DRI was $124 per share just a few months ago. :-)
I hope DRI is buying their stock back.
I bought today. I love the brands especially The Yard House. I go there weekly lol
My cardiologist has been wondering how I got so healthy. Haven't stuffed one of those canneloni al fornos in my pie hole for a long time. Maybe that's it.
Btw I did sell all my shares at 72 and started my short position at 72. I plan to cover around 60-62 and go back to long position
"I just picked up 1,600 shares. They will be shutting down all of their restaurants for a month. The market knows that. Fantastic Deal. :-)"
What is this company doing to make sure it is still relevant in another 10 years?
All time high!
"I said this last week that hey’re probably burning through about $25 million a week and no one believed me. They have $750 million of their own money, not debt. They can burn through for about 7 months before they need to accrue debt. 7 months from now is October. Darden also owns Capital Grille. They have a restaurant for every demographic, not just Olive Garden. They can do takeout/delivery booze in some states too. They are adapting to the change, laying off all their hourly staff and working with skeleton crews. They don’t need to spend on Labor, linen, etc without a dining room, saving them tens of thousands of dollars. There will be a dip for sure, but in the end, they will be back up to $120 and a dividend of .88 a share."
"With all brands doing well, we may see closer to $164 by year end then pushing much higher than $200 by end of 2022. Don't forget this pays dividends. I've been buying since shortly after pandemic hit. I will soon stop purchasing but hold until sometime in Summer 2023 to reassess future outlook. Less competition means more money."
"Anyone who leaves their home, for non-essential activities, before a vaccine is risking their life. Sure going to the beach in an open area is one thing, but going to a restaurant in a confined environment is another. These past couple months have resulted in people learning to cook their own meal, job loss restricting discretionary expenses of their customers, and under utilization of lease space when restaurants reopen.DRI will survive in a different format. Catering, delivery and takeout. Maybe Amazon or Ubereats buys them out for $20 a share.Otherwise, long term this stock is headed to the $20s in the next 6 months."
$6 Billion in debt less than $250 million in cash thats why they just issued another 7.7 million shares at $58.50...as they were burning over $35 million a week in cash now only $20 million a week. Takeout sales represent like 15% of total sales so they are still losing 75% of sales and most of the profits which is liquor sales. The balance sheet will be garbage by this time next year even with a steady increase in traffic as restaurants open.
U have to suspend the dividend to weather the storm. Good management at dri.
You can bet they had to close some of their highest performing restaurants due to almost no sales. Think about the Restaurants that are around Disney that count on those parks for huge sales through season.
"Buying more right now -- this price is insane! I mean, how much risk is left here?"
Darden increases dividend by 25%. Positive guidance thru 2022. Stock headed to 225.
"Anyone has some advise for me?im close to retiring from dri zmd my 401k is doing well, should i wait for a higher pri e or retire now?"
This won't go up for long with the dividend being suspended.
"I see no reason to be in a sit down dining company. Best case scenario for 2021 is people not wanting to go out cause they are scared, this will be offset by the limited capacity due to social distancing anyways, Unemployment will be over 10%, the cost of labor is gonna be higher due to the fact that employees are going to need to be tested (just look at what happened at Smithfield) and that is something that a business can’t risk. No doubt that there is a pent of demand to want to go out but even as someone in his mid 30s, I’m wanting to do an at home BBQs vs going out in public. Hard PASS"
Book Value $20. Net debt 5x EBITDA. This should be trading less than $15. This is very much in danger of getting delisted.
artificial pump.
i don’t think this stock will get much affected by tax loss selling because the losses are minimal and many longer term investors should still be positive or close to even
Georgia open for business- southern states are going to open soon and to go order volume growing meaning win-win for olive garden and long horn steakhouse- This will be $100 sooner than any other stocks - $DRI
Short-selling trolls are losing their shirts while longs are making money. DRI will be in the 80s very soon!
"Darden is building a rather robust To Go Business at both Olive Gardens and Longhorn steakhouses. This is something they’ve never had before. As these restaurants reopen for inside and open air dining........I don’t believe the “stay at home” people will stop ordering To Go. Watch the To Go Numbers. They may be much more important than you think. They may be a permanent reporting metric going forward. Darden’s last sales update showed 20% per week growth in To Go sales.......And an average $52,000 per week for Olive Gardens. This is very impressive, :-)"
Why isn't this really going up? It's actually down from pre-market.
"When the next Covid lockdown starts, Darden will drop back to the $80 to $84 range from its current $102.90 price."
Darden raised to outperform/target $132. They're only operating at 50% capacity. I'll be sure to have plenty of DRI when they're able to seat 100%of their tables!
One of their major suppliers just filed for bankruptcy: https://wbng.com/2020/06/10/maines-paper-and-food-services-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy/
"50% upside with dividend potential you gotta be kidding not to pounce on this, it pays you to hold it through this"
this is nuts ..they are giving offering at 58 and we are buying at 64 why
Darden is King. U can get a spaghetti dinner for under $25.
"Yikes, I remember researching this company when it was $79 and didn't pull the trigger"
"Personally, not my choice in the sector, though a very good company, thinking the Goldman sell recommendation for Darden while giving a buy recommendation for Outback and Chili's is a joke. I hope you guys blow the doors off the earnings/revenues this week. Good luck."
"Olive Garden, Bahama Breeze, and LongHorn Steakhouse have been pretty packed in my blue state. Even with the recent rise of COVID here (albeit, not as bad as many red states with their large unvaxed numbers and worse surges), the parking lots of these three restaurants have been very full. It's been surprising to me, as I would have expected them to take a hit."
Idaho reopened inside dining yesterday. Olive Garden parking lot FULL. Including the take out spaces. It’s full today..... for lunch. This restaurant is making money. :-)
Will finish negative YTD before it is over...
Worked for the Company and started buying in 2008. It’s been a great ride. Definitely LOOOOOOOOOOONG! Real estate spin-off. Constantly growing dividends and Darden can form 3 major companies with what they have left. Thanks Mr. Darden. I know your gone but thank you for making a small towns guy Money dream come true
Back to the 120's...hard to attain pie in the sky profit expectations in this economy.
"Major V shape recovery in the market once the real number of cases in places like China and Italy are all accounted for, the unusually high mortality rates running in the 2% range for a variant of the flu is most likely due to poor accounting of total cases versus fatalities. Now with patients being forcefully quarantined many people will not seek medical attention, also many people who are not showing any symptoms at all may become super carriers as for most healthy adults the symptoms can range wildly. Unlike the annual flu though, the young seem almost immune to its effects. This will be forgotten by June, and the news media had better hope that the American public forgets about how they propagandized the Corona virus in their last desperate attempt to tank the economy and hopefully for them to defeat Trump in November."
Bouncing back quickly....
$6 Billion in debt only $200 million in cash and that's after raising $450 million last year with an 8% stock dilution.

This has been a poor performer the last few weeks but at least enables us to get some more shares cheaper. Long-term it's solid.
Who's buying it 69 when they just priced an offering at 58?
There is a difference between reopening and making money. Investors will figure that out over the next three months.
"Look at this hack, always talking about buying Olive Garden three times a day and now it's an obsession with others closing their doors/bankruptcy. They know there is no good news here so they make up stuff, fairy tales, la la land.....I tell ya, very delusional. Maybe too much bread."
I drove past Olive Garden around 6PM tonight. It was PACKED!
Morgan Stanley raises price target to 128.
So many bags are being created to hold....and they don't contain any food either.
"Great leadership - issuing $58,/ shares to themselves and selling for 144-148.... nice profit off the shareholders backs!"
"Dividend is now 5%, IF they maintain current payouts. But who can predict what the board will decide to do. They might just want to horde as much cash as possible."
So I worked in a restaurant for many years. Do you want to know where the real money comes in from??? The Corona that a restaurant can but for $.75 and then sell for $5.95. Or the $6 bottle of wine that sells for $24. If you ever saw a breakdown of revenues it’s almost 50/50 between food sales and alcohol sales. If the dining room is closed....I’m sorry to say it but they aren’t coming close to covering the facilities overhead much less the corporate costs and debt. Especially in places where minimum wage is $13 an hour like San Diego.
"I’ve got most of my account in cash. I am not getting fooled. It’s not safe yet. I know first hand, I’m working in a restaurant that’s down 90% in revenue."
Let's face it. Olive Garden alone would do enough to scrimp buy with to-go sales probably running 20% - 25% of total previous sales. Their other concepts not so much. I could picture they are doing a few thousand a week against what would have been $100-$200 thousand a week. They are bleeding cash hard. Things will get very ugly for them if this does not end in a few months. Any news now that cases increase will drop this like a rock.
I think DRI should add cheese cake to all their restaurants that should send DRI straight to 200
"Darden is putting time and effort into reconfigurations based on Social Distancing and cleanliness......and open air options. When Restaurants reopen, this will be a competitive advantage. :-)"
"The only thing I'm disappointed in is I don't have the funds to buy more, spent it elsewhere. Let them drop it, I bet it goes to $100 since it broke through the support. The report was one that overall I was pleased with, as a long, that is what matters to me. As has been stated, I'd give it until Monday to see where it goes..."
"Check the post below, told you it was about to get clobbered and voila. Nobody wants Olive Garden any more."
Darden can hit the bond market like everybody else if they need cash. They haven’t yet......so maybe they don’t see a reason to. Rates are very favorable. It’s always an option. :-)
I work in a fairly popular restaurant. We laid off all hourly employees and some salary. I’m not going to buy any restaurant stocks until I know we’re reopening. We went from $20k a day to $2k

"245 Debt/Equity, rofl. Anyone thinking the books on this looks great is in la la land. I say that as a shareholder, avoid at all costs."
"sold last at 90.88 and was reluctant, but now I feel ok.I'll be backit went into Oracle and I got out with gains on that before going flat"
there's no long term risk with this stock ..buy and hold and you will make money
It will never hold...
To everyone here just a heads up. I was scrolling the SEC and found a strange trend. $EAT $DRI & $TXRH all have huge insider selling right now. I do not have a dog in this fight. I am a bull trader never a bear. Please do your own DD on matter. I’m sure more in this sector are doing the same. Good luck to all 
"if dri can survive, many financially weaker restaurants will not. There will be less competition."
I dont get how this stick is still near all time highs with covid raging. Expect a massive drop soon.
"In case you missed it,......To Go sales are growing 20% per week at Olive Garden and Longhorn Steakhouse. Olive Garden per restaurant sales last was $52,000, while Longhorns per restaurant sales were $28,000. 3 weeks ago it was $20,500 for Olive Garden and $11,000 for Longhorn. Darden’s To Go Sales are growing rapidly. :-)"
$160 by end of year then $200 after that.
"There you have it. Taking market share. 1 billion authorized for buy back of shares, approaching $10 billion in annual sales and still opening over 30 new restaurants in the U.S. Hold on to this one people."
Soup and Salad at Olive Garden is recession proof. Chinese trade tariff unlikely to impact food restraunt sector.
Colleagues: I am a retired dividend invester. Do I stick with dri? Is this a blue chip dividend stock? Fairly safe? Or should I capitalize on the stock price rebound to sell?
How do you pay dividends with no income?
"Going to $20 in 3 months , most of not all restaurants will close until a vaccine is found. Put leaps are the only play here. A restaurant can not social distance. A socially distanced restaurant is an enough one with zero profits"
DRI is roaring back today. Goes to 120 by year end.
Restraunt wait times are averaging 45 minutes for seating and up to 45 minutes for food. Labor shortage is going to drive people back to fast casual or home again.
"There will be a good rally tomorrow and onwards on airplanes $LUV $DAL $AAL $UAL - why because retails up $PVH $LB $GAP- energy up $OXY $APA- cruise up $CCL $NCLH- theaters up $AMC $CNK- transportation up - restaurants up $DRI $CMG - even home builders , hotels and rental cars are up lol... so IMO this is bottom for airlines from this week.. 2 months chart speaks itself and earning reports are priced in too.buy and hold.. GLTA "
Why is this down $2.90 AH with 1 share traded last
Restaurants in Georgia can open on Monday. Darden has 20 Restaurants in Georgia. 12 Longhorn Steakhouses and 8 Olive Gardens. Let’s see what DRI decides to do. It will be well covered event. Lots of national media attention and political hot potato stuff. Florida will be the big reopen. Darden has a boatload of properties in Florida
Why is our stock skyrocketing out of the stratosphere?

"Numbers were good. Olive Garden light but Longhorn killing it. I didn't get Cheddar's numbers yet, did they improve?"
"Dont be trippin dawg, DIR is going to drift and sink until new developments or new results."
Well I've been to Capitol Grill probably 5 times in 2 months and Long Horn last night they are always packed
"Hey Tony.. whats the inside scoop on this quarter? GC down, costs are up and profits are better then expected??"
"What do people think of Yard House? We have one in my city, but I've never been. How is the food, pricing, atmosphere, etc.? It's one of the $DRI properties I don't know much about. Any potential for increasing growth?"
"1 billion. Yeah and that's all borrowed. Burning through 25 million a week, except, you know that's not the REAL number. Before this is over they will have been downgraded, even in more debt and it will be another 5 months before business is hopping again. In other words, worse positioned than when virus first began.....the perceived quality of this company just got tossed..."
Ladies and Dudes: Darden is a quality corporation. People are itching to get out to eat. 2022 will be a great year. Darden raised the dividend 25%. Darden is on a similar trajectory as Target was. We are headed to 225. Jump on board.
"Call your local darden restaurant everyday/week and ask when they’re opening. Hold until then. If they’re not opening, they’re losing money. It’s impossible to generate even half of the same revenue doing curbside/delivery."
I notice the dividend yield is currently only 1%. Do you expect the dividend to come back? I am a retired dividend investor. I have a nice capital gain with DRI. Should I hold or cash out and swap in to another dividend payer? Any commentary appreciated.
Look at CMG earnings today- people are getting used to with ToGO orders- This will be same for longhorn and Olive garden... Olive garden is more popular on south and south is coming back in business this week. Bag it and dine with $ - good luck 
Bottom is soon. Then switch over to calls!
just got in this morning. i like the financial statement much better than QSR. sold QSR like 8 months ago.

"I just sold half of my holdings , the rest will sell if it hits 72.00"
"It's a strange math that calculates taking on a billion dollars in debt makes a company, that was already struggling, worth more."
"I just bought 1,600 more shares......1. Olive Garden will do a booming take out business. 2. Tens of thousands of Mom and Pop restaurants will go under in the next month. Less competition. Darden is not a movie theater chain. :-)"
"Wait for it, wait for it. Still gonna slide a little more before the bottom."
California Announcement restaurants closing doors again
1/26/21 - Raymond James maintains Buy rating on DRI with $137.50 price target.
"Went to Olive Garden sat evening, it was empty , not looking good"
"With covid-19 cases spiking in FL, TX, AZ, and half of US states, I worry for longs in some of the highly exposed restaurant chains, (especially $SHAK but also $RRGB, $DIN, $DRI, $RUTH) that a rapid exit from the reopening trade will mean lots of small investors get hurt. Good luck to all but play it safe with your $$$."
Did anyone actually read anything before buying today? Having $1 Billion in cash doesn't mean much to me when you increased debt significantly. buyers are acting like they just found it laying under a sink while they were cleaning a kitchen.
The Olive Garden in my area is still filling orders for Take Out..
How many months can they survive on their cash and revolver while doing 15% of sales via takeout? Even when things open back up how long will people be wary of going. It will be a full year before customers rebound and by then their balance sheet will look like Swiss cheese.
"What will happen on Thursday morning? Only G-d knows. Right, Boys?"
once Divi is back this will fly. Dallas was at 90% prepandemic revenue before they started closing down again.
"If they cancel the dividend, maybe they can give us free dinners! (You can't make this stuff up.)"
"If COVID situation doesn’t deteriorate and earnings are better than expected, this thing ripping to 85 within 2 weeks"
"Look at the balance sheet, they are in trouble. Accounts payable is more then their cash on hand. They have $475M of deferred revenue (gift cards) out there which is what people will be using for whatever take out orders they get. Their inventory is going to spoil for any fresh food. 2 months of shut down and they won’t be able to pay their bills. Still time to short or buy puts."
"Neil is the smartest guy here, although unemployment wil be 20% at years end minimum. Olive garden and other such restauratns can;'t make it work with the distancing which creates less revenue, higher costs, etc etc. Airlines, hotels restaurants, cruise ships and associated suppliers, secondary and tertiary businesses all in deep trouble. There are a lot of delusional folks on these message boards. Only because they dont get the issues around revenues/costs/capital required to survive this for what will be minimum 1 year and likely a lot longer before geting back to any semblandce of normalcy. In the meantime these stocks are worthless. Sure they will pump up and down. Don't get caught when the music stops and it will. The FED will not win this war. Revenue only will and it is not happening to a point it can deal with the costs that are going to be ""pandemic"" to cope with COVID 19."
Dividend is 30 cents and used to be 88 cents. This makes me sad:-(
