Why is our stock skyrocketing out of the stratosphere?
"With all brands doing well, we may see closer to $164 by year end then pushing much higher than $200 by end of 2022. Don't forget this pays dividends. I've been buying since shortly after pandemic hit. I will soon stop purchasing but hold until sometime in Summer 2023 to reassess future outlook. Less competition means more money."
"What will happen on Thursday morning? Only G-d knows. Right, Boys?"

Clowns back to posting again. For my $61k basis I'm getting over $7800 in annual dividends. DRI is doing great.
Well I've been to Capitol Grill probably 5 times in 2 months and Long Horn last night they are always packed
All time high!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPSO0DPGo2Q ..... ^ DRI / AABB / ALPP = Superb 2021/2022 Profits.?
Another shutdown imminent... This will pull back for sure.
I drove past Olive Garden around 6PM tonight. It was PACKED!
Back to the 120's...hard to attain pie in the sky profit expectations in this economy.
"What do people think of Yard House? We have one in my city, but I've never been. How is the food, pricing, atmosphere, etc.? It's one of the $DRI properties I don't know much about. Any potential for increasing growth?"
"Hey Tony.. whats the inside scoop on this quarter? GC down, costs are up and profits are better then expected??"
Mandatory vaccines to work for Darden.... talk about an employment nightmare.
Will finish negative YTD before it is over...
"There you have it. Taking market share. 1 billion authorized for buy back of shares, approaching $10 billion in annual sales and still opening over 30 new restaurants in the U.S. Hold on to this one people."
When does Darden report earnings?
Like I've been saying... this is way overpriced with current labor and cost of goods inflation. I see 124/share after next earnings report.
"Olive Garden, Bahama Breeze, and LongHorn Steakhouse have been pretty packed in my blue state. Even with the recent rise of COVID here (albeit, not as bad as many red states with their large unvaxed numbers and worse surges), the parking lots of these three restaurants have been very full. It's been surprising to me, as I would have expected them to take a hit."
$160 by end of year then $200 after that.
