Going to get bought out 
did I see 23% margin
"ALL FRAUD BY THE NAJARIANS AND DAVITA, IS REAL THE CALL BUY TO $64.00BY JAN 16 TH 2019 IS REAL,,,,,, ONE SHORTS AND PUTS AND THE OTHER BUY CALLS AT LOW BUYS."
Did i call this or what ???? spike near $115 and dropping like a rock see u in the $90's sooooooon BUY FMS much cheaper
Any thoughts on why down so much today = ANY due to Powell Q&A?By that I mean after the hike was announced things weren't so bad and I had to leave for the day.Tax loss selling is taking it's toll on DVA.But how much is interest rate related? I cna't believe that .25% would cause DVA to be down another 3% basically twice the loss of the market.I'll likely be adding to common and/or calls by the end of the Year.No rush.
Stable it is today
"$7 away from setting a new all time high,once deal is done with United Health this is an excellent takeover private equity target.$90 a share or so."
DVA is up 8.38% to $75.05
cvs eyes kidney patients.
So let me get this straight at $113 PETER tells us to buy that it will be a BARN BURNER and will make new highs...at $104 he tells us to BUY AGAIN but makes no mention of his previous advice in which ppl would be down almost $10 !!! DVA is heading to $90 and Peter will tell us let's not buy now ....LOL
?WHY is this POS stock down 9% today???
"Feds say dialysis-clinic chain had deal with Surgical Care Affiliates to not hire senior execs, and unnamed health- care company agreed not to solicit DaVita employeesDialysis and kidney-care giant DaVita Inc. and its former chief executive were charged this week with conspiring with competing companies to not solicit one another's employees.The Justice Department , which announced the charges Thursday, said a federal grand jury returned a two-count indictment against Denver -based DaVita (DVA) and former Chairman and CEO Kent Thiry , who stepped down as chief executive of the company in 2019 after two decades in charge.The first count charges DaVita and Thiry with conspiring with Surgical Care Affiliates -- which was indicted in January -- not to solicit each other's senior-level employees from 2012 to 2017. The second count charges DaVita and Thiry for conspiring with an unnamed health care company from 2017 to 2019 through an agreement that the other company would not solicit DaVita's employees.If convicted, Thiry could face jail time of up to 10 years and be fined up to $1 million for each count. DaVita could face fines of a maximum of $100 million for each count.In the indictment, prosecutors cited emails and text messages that allude to no-poaching agreements. One text message between two former colleagues asked for a recommendation for customer-service employees but, referring to a DaVita-owned pharmacy company, said ""nobody at Rx today. Promised Kent!""""Those who conspire to deprive workers of free-market opportunities and mobility are committing serious crimes that we will prosecute to the full extent of the law,"" Acting Assistant Attorney General Richard A. Powers of the DOJ's Antitrust Division said in a news release.DaVita vowed to fight the charges.""The charges against the company are unjust and unwarranted,"" a company spokeswoman said. ""The government's case relies on an unprecedented and untested application of the antitrust laws to alleged discussions involving a former executive that occurred many years ago.""The defendants are scheduled to appear in U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado on July 20 ."
It's time for the Office of Inspector General to investigate for racketeering and money laundering under the Rico act. Going down down down.
"THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME DAVITA HAS COMMITED FRAUD,,,,, THIS IS THE SECOND TIME DAVITA HAS FRAUD...."
Last chance to buy under $64. This will go back to $70s in 6 months
Forward PE and valuation are very attractive
TIMBER !!!!!!!!!!
Have you seen all the TV ads about kidney dialysis patients getting infected and killed at clinics? DVA is killing people. lawsuits en masse to come.
"hopefully, DVA stays the way it is now for long term investment. I've had confidence with this company that leading by a few smart guys I knew of in the company. I've did bought 1,000 shares at $46 on June-6-2019 and keep for mine kids' educations in colleagues."
Going to fall after earnings. Sold yesterday. Good luck
The most encouraging news for those Long is the aggressive share buyback program at these low prices!

My post last night about price movement after hours after ER has disappeared!
Seems like a Yes vote on Prop. 8 is going strong and gaining. Not good for DVA. Millions spent by DVA on a losing proposition will hurt their bottom line even more.
this should break 71 in a week
DaVita is up 5.20% to 86.44
"Someone called into Cramer tonight about DVA. He said bye.Didn't say anything abotu recent run, or the Berkshire stake.Actually his comments I think made it sound like a growth stock. Or more growth than I am expecting.Nothing about low margins, or that all the profit comes from the sliver of Insurance Money because the gov't reimbursement isn't much.I'm still long, have sold some trading shares along the way. And have one lone Jan 2021 37.50 call is up 75% that I bought with proceeds of selling profitable common lower than where we are now.All the common I still hold is green.""scale in, scale out, online commissions are cheap"""
"OVERSOLD bear raid in effect for this trading session!*** Buy DVA on weakness — the company is on pace to report its strongest Qtr in a matter of days!- This is a great entry point to obtain huge gains, for enterprising and retail investors — in the face of brazen pre earnings short trading raid!"
Was this recent run-up in a decent market mostly the fact that the sale in Colorado went thru?
8k change to CEO payout. setting up for a sale?
Sold a few trading shares yesterday at 56.45 from an outstanding order.Wasn't worth writing covered calls.If we get close to 60 I'll write some calls.If DVA dips closer to 50 I'll buy more trading shares.Not flashy but still not many alternatives. FMS and small players. No choice on whether to have dialysis or not.
Super low volume pullback. Weak hands selling or just a little reasonable profit taking. No worries $120 in next few months regardless of economy.
WOW thank goodness we received that 6 month old news item from PETER that a 91 year old dinosaur bought this pig 6 months ago....he probably sold a ton in early Q1 of this year when it was $125 now PETER is telling everyone to buy this pig.....see you in the 90's
I think the company has money for open market stock purchases. Nice opportunity under 55.
"Added some at 54.53 in very rare for em pre-market buy on news about at-home DialysisRemember that Frenesius(sp?) just was allowed to complete their purchase of NXTM that has to my knowledge still the only small at home unit for Dialysis including overnight.I used to own NXTM - a decent amount until I saw the moves mgmt was making to continue their personal gravy train at the expense of stock holders. By the time the buyout came I didn't own many shares. Infact one of the worst moved NXTM had made was giving away too much of the company and a board seat to the fella they bought the tubing set business off of and is what they had to sell off to have the buyout be allowed.If DVA continues to slide I'll hope to buy back my Jan 65 calls that I wrote for half price and likely will still add some common.There are always stories and sometimes referendum's abotu Dialysis. But there still arent' many altrernatives to Dialysis or the 2 large Company's in this space.Good luck folks!""scale in, scale out, online commissions are cheap""I may flip today's pre-market shares for a couple bucks more today given the chance."
"Friday closed about 58, Tuesday shortly after open it's at 52 on no news!No news on AMTD or Yahoo atleast.Crazy!I recently sold some trading shares since I have purchased Jan 2021 37.50 already that were up significantly so I was doing the old ""stock replacement"" strategy.I mean a lot of big players can certainly move this around. Question is why. And should us individual Investors be concerned about any issues other than a large holder(s) potentially dumping."
About time to move higher
"• Italy's death toll and infection rate from coronavirus continuing to slow down • The death toll is now close to 15,000 while 120,000 have been infected with it • But today is the fifth consecutive day in which the number of new cases remained within a range of 4,050-4,782"
"No way, folks do not go to hospitals much"
Forward PE of 9.65 is cheap. I see aging demographic as a tailwind. The health care system with a splited house will continue .
"I like this company for an earnings play, am going long in a few minutes, expecting an earnings beat and positive guidance going forward. Only going to do 100 shares, because I see risks and headwinds going forward that might reduce the likelihood of a serious pop up even on a good earnings report. CVS looks much better as an earnings play, but this one is good enough for me to put 100 shares at risk to the long side."
"Earnings release in the pre-Market opening should be a barn burner, and should take DVA to new all time highs!*** Good idea to get ahead of the upward surge!"

Awesome “barn burner” Qtr earnings report yesterday that grabbed investors attention everywhere!
Finally broke thru 60 today after bouncing off of it several times. To the point that I sold some common just under 60 but kept Jan calls and other common.Someone was really holding it under 60 - it was almost like an OE Friday and the MM was playing with the price.Can't see how a fed cut that everyone is expecting will directly help DVA. If it had a dividend(and why doesn't it - I think of it like a Utility) that may cause a bump.
Going to be down huge tomorrow lol jk. Its moving less than on a er miss than a regular day.
DVA is down -5.59% to 68.97
A buy today under 60(59.42 up 1.44 as I type) and write the Jan 2021 60's at 9.50/10.20 for a guarantee of over 15% in 15 months. Or if there is a dip in the stock maybe buy them back lower for a nice return.Absolute worst case is DVA takes a dive and is below 60 on OE and you have just lowered your 60.00 cost basis by roughly 10.00 which still looks good.No choice on getting Dialysis and it's basically still a duopoly.
"Still potential tax loss selling by individuals but I added some yesterday and todayI don't see a compelling reason to be in a hurry. It may run into yearend as folks may have sold or be selling and needing to wait their 30 days.DVA has been disappointing. Not like folks have a choice about getting Dialysis. I owned some stock in a company their competitor recently purchased that specialized in at home dialysis.And both of the guys WEB gave money to run to see who may replace him bought DVA independently or each other and that was why Berkshire had to start to file about DVA becasue their ownership was so great. I believe there is some kind of standstill in place though isn't there?Anyways may be time to start to nibble..""scale in, scale out, online commissions are cheap"""
could I buy more 100 shares or wait after report out? I've been keep track DVA 35 days and it slow move up.....
"Shorted an additional 50,000 at 129.22"
Great earning report and future forecast comments. Here we go.
i wonder how much buffet made with this takeout
"i shorted another 20,000 shares at 122.88...30,000 shares for an average of $120.65 it should drop to $110 soon....."
"Like everyone else, I'm finding countless articles about CVS buying Davita for $4.9B sometime next year. Has anyone found anything more concrete? How much that works out to per share? Roughly when next year is the acquisition going thru?"
Why up today?
"DID JON AND PETE NAJARIAN TAKE IN A FRAUD SHORT,,,,,,, WITH DAVITA.ONE BROTHER BUYS CALLS AND THE OTHER BROTHER BUYS PUTTS AND SHORTS........ THIS DAVITA NEEDS A GOOD LOOK AT BY SEC, FEDERAL TRADE COMM."
Did Berkshire just buy 33%?
2021 EPS guidance ahead of consensus at the midpoint.
up 12%=stable ??
Wrote 1 JAN 202 65 call for 3.50 this morning while the stock was just under 57.00. That is a return of 20% if they get called away. And if they get called away all the common I have will be doing very well....Just like last time when I wrote 60's for 4.00 and bought back at 2.00 I may do the same with these as that's what I usually do. But I'm leaning towards never calling these back.I will likely continue to write some calls at different strikes given the chance up to 1/4 of my DVA holdings.For some reason a few hours later this post isn't showing. Luckily I had made a copy of it(because Yahoo is so reliable...)Now DVA has backed off some but still green on the day. Entire market doing well today.
Sold to Soon obviously....however great gain.
"DVA remains the top value play in the sector, and has a lot of room to run— given its leading metrics manifested in its very clean and attractive balance sheet!"
DVA is down 6.13% to $71.42
Buffet selling as we speak
"The real magic here and why Berkshire owns over 1/3 of the company is the disappearing share count. If you look at the last 10 years, the share count was as high as 215 million shares. Today it is approaching 100 million."
"Okay, profit taking is fine, but; DVA has finally filled out to its authentic and fair trading level.- By fair trading projections, DVA stock should be at $125. "
Wondering if anyone has heard chatter on DaVita trialing the new Infomed dialysis machines?
I will vote 'Yes' to Prop 8. Need to rein in the cost as it is out of control. See so many ads for No on Prop 8 and it seems like the 'Yes' is winning over. Not good for DVA.
We are now at December 2013 price levels. My only guess why we are down 25% from the high is the imminent election of Hillary and the possible damage she might do to the healthcare/pharma sector.
"Enron, Fannie and Freddie....DVA"
"How many shares do you think DVA has already bought back at these levels from weak holders, given the company's $1.500 billion buyback authorization (12% of the market cap)?"
"Great company, but the drop was warranted. California government could really hurt DaVita. This was not a good dip to buy on it was a fundamental change. Risk increased. So why the rally today?"
"how about that DVA,,,remember fannie mae and freddie mac ???"
DVA on the way to $120 then $116 then $110 then UNDER $100.....yay me !!!!!!
Glad I sold. Management at this company is so corrupt
DVA is on sale on this low volume pullback!
My average after commissions is avg price of 126.01...tomorrow i should be profitable on this short should eventually drop to $93to $96 by mid year....market is starting to fall apart so it might even be accelerated even more its starting with the Nasdaq and eventually almost everything will collapse except super cheap stocks like FMS that will settle in the $40 to $50 range
DaVita is doing just fine.
No to prop 23 should give a boost.
DVA reached a new 52 Week High at 77.47
DaVita reached an all time high at 109.25
"#$%$ - up 4.8% to 53079 on no real newsAn article about DVA being one of Berkshire's 2 stocks near 52 week low.Some SPAM.Some click bait.But nothing I'd consider substantialIt's been over 54.00 today on jsut slightly higher than average volume.I bough back the Jan 65 calls I wrote at 4.00 for 2.00 and will rewrite them given the chance.FMS up .5% on 1/3 averaged volume here at 2:25 EST and no new news there either.Overall market up like 1% after a rough week so far. S%P & NASDAQ up 1%, Dow .75% due to BA I'd imagine.."
"was in last week,not even a green day since then..."
"drop, drop, drop goes DVA"
So painful to own this stock for a few years.
"Thinking of writing some Jan 2020'sFor 1/4 of my holdings - and I'm currently overall underwater with shares currently held.At 54.00 looks like JAN 2020's at strike of 60 can be sold for 5.40 which would be 21% return if called away.Writing the JAN 2020 65's at 4.00 would be 27% return in a Year if called away.And the other 3/4 of my holdings would benefit from the stock price runup very nicely if the stock trades up thru the strike price.So collect a premium and if the stock gets called away a return of 20%+ in a Year on those shares. If it doesn't get called away I've just reduced my cost basis. Often when I do this if I can buy the calls back at half the price I collected I buy them back and close out the trade, usually has to do with how much time is left.But 20% in a Year or a lowered cost basis is looking pretty good.Also look at a simple chart for the past Year. Between 65 and 69 that's getting kinda close to the recent high's and I'd likely be selling some of my trading shares in that range anyways.Good luck folks!"
"I've bought back almost all common sold much higher this Year, now 2 options buys as wellYesterday some Jan 60's for 2.50today I piggy backed on the Jan 67.50's at .65The 67.50's the other day just after I had bought back more common one of the pony tail brothers saw the same activity as I had noticed in options at Jan 67.50 and he piggy backed the trade.I had raised cash thus Year especially over the summer and was up to like 20% cash. Being a crazy market I have been buying calls into the new Year more than common as a way to limit risk.Time will tell about the market, and this ""risk less"" but more like gambling(mostly due to time limitation) than true investing to me.I still have a little over 12% cash left.DVA like several stocks I own and follow I have to believe tax loss selling is a large part of the slide. Folks figuring DVA certainly isn't going to go out of Business so it's being oversold for accounting purposes and likely to be bought back.As long as Berkshire isn't selling (the 2 new guys are who bought DVA) and folks need Dialysis I can't see DVA going anywhere.If DVA paid a dividend(and why don't they - as to me almost a utility stock) it wouldn't have gotten beaten up this bad. IMO.""scale in, scale out, online commissions are cheap""Good luck folks!"
"PEG of 0.6 indicates the growth of DVA will be impressive. Its current metrics of forward P/E under 9.x is very attractive, and its price per book of 2.1 is lower than the peers at 4.4 , and price per sales is only 0.7. Bargain"
"By this morning I have purchased back most of the DVA I sold earlier, and added a little more SQ.Watching SPY, KLIC, JPM to add.Got lucky with DVA in one account it's been excellent trading especially considering that I really view DVA as a long term hold.5/19/18 bought small lot 64.7511/7/18 sold 4 lots 75.5511/8/18 bought lot 69.7511/13/18 bought lot 65.4612/10/18 bought lot 57.53(10% lower than last buy)In another account I have similar1/11/18 sold 4 lots 78.68bought lot 5/3/18 63.53so I may have more buying to do to finish replacement. Been looking at calls alsoTax loss selling HAS to be an issue as this market continues to deteriorate rapidly.3rd account a couple of lots from March 2017 avg 68 I added a lot 11/20 59.53.I'm now at about 10% of my Portfolio and overall the shares I hold are down 8%. Now I have booked decent profits though this doesn't reflect.In the end I always wondered why DVA doesn't pay a dividend. Huge cash flow, almost a utility. No choice but to have Dialysis and basically it's a duopoly. WEB's new guys both loved DVA and I sold some when Berkshire had to file how much DVA they owned and other folks jumped in.Basically Tarif's won't effect DVA. Taxes won't negatively effect DVA.No choice but to have Dialysis if you need it.Tax loss selling has to be a major factor IMO right now.""Scale in, scale out, online commissions are cheap""Good luck folks!"
"DO THE NAJARIAN BROTHERS COMMIT FRAUD WHILE THEY ARE ON CNBCONE BUYS AND PUMPS, AND THE OTHER ONE SHORTS, PUTS,,,,,, DAVITAIS IN ON THIS SCAM."

Article recommend to buy DVA from analysts indicates that it is cheap with forward p/e of 10.x
Heading to $40 before June
I have been accumulating when I can. I do believe that the future will be looking bright in the next year.
Why is it down so much today?
DVA upgrade to $150 target price today!

Need for transplants and directing patients with the ability to consider home dialysis is not new. What is the big news coming?
Just on CNBC Jim Chanos(sp?) shorting DVA for Years and questions Berkshire being involved - they still have 24%.A couple comments. Berkshire doesn't ALWAYS make the best moves. Look at the first time that I know of that they bought a Company with another investor(who is slash n loot) from Brazil with Kraft Heinz. You can see what a mis-step that was.And actually it was Warren's 2 new hires that both had bought DVA that they had to file 10% ownership not long after they had started.Now DVA is at 24% and I believe have a standstill agreement. Which is why I questioned DVA announced a significant buyback not long ago which would increase Berkshire's % ad if that would cause any issues.I am long DVA(common and I had sold some common and bought deep in the money calls that are now up 59%.It will be interesting to hear why it is shorted. We already know that all profits come from the little sliver of private pay for Davita and Frenesius.Capital intensive but a necessary service. And since to me it has a lot of characteristics of a Utility I have always thought they should have a dividend.Let the games begin. I have made decent money trading DVA over Years. Virtually all the common and calls I own are with the House's money.I had wanted this to be one of my 4 largest holdings but it just can't seem to get there!2 folks with WAY more money and information that I will lever have. Time to grab the popcorn and decide if there is an opportunity to make money here.And I have been long BRKB's for a very long time. Although I sold a bunch when their split was announced and shortly after that split.Chenos to be on CNBC shortly but I have to leave so I won't see it.
"COVID Risk?Is there a risk to DVA business model because of COVID? dialysis patients are in tight proximity in dialysis centers with 20-30 other patients for 4 hours per session three (3) days per week. The medical staff work at multiple clinics and could potentially transmit disease. Most clinics are in metropolitan areas. End stage renal disease patients requiring dialysis are mostly over 65 years of age and have underlying medical conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, immunosuppression and are often overweight. Similar profile for those at greatest risk of serious COVID infections.The map of dialysis locations nation wide looks a lot like the map of confirmed COVID cases https://www.optum.com/solutions/population-health/clinical-management/medical-benefit-management/kidney-solutions.htmlWhat is DaVita doing to protect their fragile patients? What is the rate of COVID positive care givers in dialysis clinics? Does DaVita provide infection rate information to their patients?

Great buying opportunity in DVA stock currently trading at a discount on the sell off from all time highs!!
Some trading shares sold pre-market at 7:02AM at 56.53 which is higher that it's showing as last trade at 8:15 .26 up from Friday close and can't belivieve China and N Korea news has anything to do with it.AMTD and Yahoo don't show any volume yet premarket.
"analyst price target average at 67. I guess that the one time write off has gone, It is about to get an upgrade."
Warren buffet holds 20 percent of DVA
"Still wondering where this will go today? With other words, do you sell today?"
"DVA is in “oversold zone”, and languishing in the bargain bin!"
This is a tremendous buying opportunity into an illogical and temporary oversold moment that could be interpreted as “free gains”!!!
DaVita is up 7.27% to 88.38
Are traders expecting price move above $70? Look @ Jan 67 Options... I bought it and hoping for merry Christmas .. Good Luck
hope to stay above 60..
Any thoughts on taking over KERX ..? One drug AURYXIA ...2 indications
i m new to this stock..any news to share?
My speculation is that the price is down cause the Investment banker may buy it before the offer from Warren Buffettt in buying the whole DVA
I see no news on AMTD or here and average volume but up 2.48 to 72.12 and 3.55% today - kind of bizarre.Perhaps we will find out later.Simple chart shows to me - and I'm ahrdly a chart expert - that it should go up or down soon as it's into the middle of the > and I'm not a big enough chart guy to know which way it may go.I still know that Dialysis isn't much of a choice and some big name shorts are in here and Berkshire Hathaway is long like 10% of shares.So based on fundamentals I'm holding all my shares but thinking about cashing in on some trading shares.Can't believe that I see n news. Can't be all about a potential trade war especially with no dividend.
Let the spin begin. Gonna be interesting to see what they have to say.
Nice one here too! Wonder where this will go today? Anybody more information?
"Sold a little today to buy more of a speculative Biotech but order didn't go off yet.I own one o fthe 2 open JAN 2023 90 calls and it did nicely today!The common I own is up 146% so no harm in a little trimming.No choice about dialysis. Still basically a duopoly.I think of DVA as a utility without a dividend. ANd am curious why no dividend as ""sales"" are rather easy to predict.And COVID treatments and COVID are wrecking havoc with kidneys unfortunately along with other body parts."
Buffett the largest shareholder. Wish I had some $ to put in it
Shorted 2000
Yahoo ..please stop spamming with price updates many times.
DaVita is up 8.88% to 134.09
FMS has climbed over $3 since i posted and DVA is going nowhere but a slow trickle back down to the $90's and perhaps lower. There's a huge lawsuit against DVA and the dollar is getting stronger which benefits FMS !
Any company whose pricing is determined by the government is a poor investment. Hard to believe Warren allowed this stock. CMS keeps lowering prices.
Get in on this one. Lots of achievements for a 9 month old cyber security co. LDSR
DVA is currently trading in the “extreme value discount” level!
Hows that short working out Chanos!! Time to get a real job!
Listen to the Freakonomics podcast on dialysis. Davita does some shady stuff.
"There a is potential 30% upside in DVA stock from these current trading levels!- Savvy investors should employ an accumulation strategy on this persistent weakness in anticipation of next. week’s DVA earnings report!*** Ignore the manipulative short trading, and back up the truck on this phenomenal DVA buying opportunity!!!!"
"up....$60,000 so far will layer out 10,000 shares at a time every $6 to $8 all the way down to $90's which is still expensive but"
Yeah yeah
Bought a call today - rather than selling one.May add more later Jan 2021Crazy Market. China shouldn't have much specific effect here.I don't know if DVA gets any consumables from China. Or whatever 3rd party they buy from has items made in China.Does it effect anyone else like this. Just typing China and Medical Device in the same sentence gave me the shivers!
CVS - Anyone have an idea of what they are proposing with in home dialysis through Coram?
Trying this for the 1st time. Few shares won’t hurt
Big miss on earnings see you are 40

"BTW Peter the Wrong...i have also bought the much cheaper and better company in this space at $34.89 see my posts...60,000 im hedging it against this expensive shady management elusive answers on earnings calls..if you look at the chart on this pig it is showing a lower high from January and an H chart pattern both extremely BEARISH but you wouldn't know that because your a sheep and i'm a lion."
Where's Rob and Pete ?
"What does Berkshire and other billion dollar hedge funds see in this company? Either the market is inefficient and can't price this security, or there is something many disagree on. Is it litigation risk? Healthcare reform risk? Company seems to throw off good cash flow. Anyone?"
Play the rebound in DVA stock for huge gains!- DVA is a $150 stock currently trading at a big discount at this current bargain basement trading levels!
"I only bought this because it was a Buffet stock,200shares on a dip in August.After a stock buyback,this sale could be a route to a takeover or going private.Definitely a hold right now ,if it was January I might sell but already too many capital gains this year to pay taxes on."

Warren Buffet started selling
"DVA- had a huge run already! Remember that hospitals do NOT admit these patients (pts for us medical folks), if they are not critical! Buy backs are just one way to hype any stocks"
DVA should break $70 before Y/E based on expected forward earnings and WB lifting % owned. Buy
Have you heard anything about DVA losing a substantial piece of business this year?
"$64.00 - Perfect time to back up the truck. CMS put out a press release today: ""CMS examines inappropriate steering of people eligible for Medicare or Medicaid into Marketplace plans"". Dumb money will be selling; DaVita will be buying/probably seek to accelerate the buyback. And, if you follow Warren Buffett, you can be damn sure that his deputy Mr. Weschler is evaluating a takeover bid for the whole company, or he too will be increasing his stake. Gotta love the engineering take down of the shares, allowing insiders to load the boat. Don't be fooled! DVA has at least 50% upside to present value based strong and growing free cash flow, with intrinsic value compounding higher from there."
"expensive with questionable and agressive forward guidance. Also huge debt, low fcf"
Hgen eua approval soon with my dva holdimgs good deals!
DVA is up 5.03% to $75.23

Great buying opportunity on this temporary pullback in DVA stock!
DVA is down 5.24% to $66.74
"DVA has had a history of fraud, and Chanos announced his short in September. Hard to believe DVA was able to significantly beat estimates without some of Chanos' concerns being true. This move up today is overplayed."
everyone has left
Had a good run . Maybe a pullback to where it broke out $90
UBS upgrade of DVA today!!!*******Raises price target from $93 to &10!6! 
why did this just go up?
Down to 53.05 2.27 so I just put a buy in for 52.65 to buy back the trading shares I sold yesterday at 56.53.I see no news on Yahoo or AMTD or finviz.
buy buy buy
"Wow, I bought 2000 shared when it dipped to 55 with the fund I sold RAD with a big loss. Hope it will cover some of the loss from RAD"
"Wonder if Berkshire is adding even more? Both ""new"" guys are who bought DVA shares not WEB himself.I believe they were up to 23% ownership?If THEY liquidate it will be really ugly.In the end I figure DVA will be somewhere between a utility and a tobacco company. They will let them make enough profit to stay in business. Thru taxing(like Tobacco) or in this case Gov't reimbursement of procedures.In the end the service both these big dialysis company's provide is life saving or life extending, the money will be found to pay for it."
Buffett stock owned company does not stay down long!
Good upward moving in last 3days
"Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B +1.4%) (BRK.A +1.4%) discloses a 33% stake in Davita (DVA -0.7%), up from 31.7% in a filing dated Sept. 21, 2020."
1 billion Dutch tender with 88 ceiling is the likely top until mid September
Govt reliance on earnings
why is this going down ?
"MY LITIGATION ATTORNEY IN NEW YORK,,,,, ARE ON THE DAVITA COMPANY"
DVA reached a new 52 Week High at 74.03
DVA is up 5.07% to 84.58
Not seeing any news yet but opened down 4.00 over 5%AMTD and Yahoo no news yet.No ER Due.Anyone else see anything?
"DAVITA FRAUD AND THE NAJARIAN BROTHERS WAS VERY REAL $66.00 CALLS BY JAN16,2019........LITIGATION ATTORNEYS ARE GOING TO FILE."
Buffett just bought
$5 discount anyone?
Trimmed more common today.Still lots of common and some calls.
stay long friends...
"Awesome, AWESOME victory in the passage of pro DVA proposition by California voters last night.***Ūber bullish for DVA’s business in the most populous state.- What a DVA bonanza!"
Broke 50 Moving Average next stop 200 day moving average at $112 ish
Hopefully we stay above 50 now.I am rather loaded up with common and Jan 2021 calls.
News is the election in CA. Ballot asks for price controls on dialysis centers. DVA et.al spending heavily for a NO vote.
DVA reached a new 52 Week High at 78.37
I have extended my price targets for covering..will cover at $114 1/8 $103 1/4 $94 1/2
DVA is on sale at these levels!This company still remains the best value play in the sectorwhen you compare all the “key analytical fundamentals” to its competitors.
Dva-way over bought
This company is a pure fraud
"There are a couple risks related to covid. Increased cost of service, risk to employees and clients and in the longer term ....How many souls are lost to this hideous disease ?....... What does post COVID look like?"
Close to 6 million shares short. Likely short covering action today. Proceeds from sale to be used for share repurchases.
Dva dropping to 200 day at 94 maybe lower. Berkshire buying means nothing. Mark my words
Looks like a bunch of Company announced news this morning.From profit % increase to stock buyback.
Nice Beat!Going up and up!
"Lots of stock movement (mostly down) for a large Company and yet no MB activity?I realize that these MB's have been ""improved"" over the past few years to teh point they have little value but really - this inactive?I realize a lot is institutional.I realize Frenesius has issues and trying to complete the acquisition of NXTM(which I also owned until the buyout was announced).Tax loss selling will likely keep DVA down thru end of Year. I'll likely be buying back the 1/3 left after my recent sale, I already bought 2 chunks back.And I'm likely to add fresh shares. Was looking at calls yesterday too."
Why is DVA down so much today? I cannot find any news.
Oops - dang AMTD - I was buying when I thought I was selling!Couple days ago I thought I wrote Jan 65's for 3.50 and AMTD does this weird thing after I choose Sell-to-open then you do the lookup on the options change it CHANGES it to BUY-to-open!I have been bitten by this before!So today I noticed my error and sold for 3.70 - basically a wash.I will likely attempt to rewrote Jan 65's for 4.00 soon.
DaVita is down 11.44% to 67.26
big insider sales
"Buffett's 'Big Mistake' Is Finally Looking Up - realmoney/thestreet/click bait - who wrote headline?If I recall the 2 new guys EACH bought DVA and that is how Berkshire had enough shares that they had to file. WEB had NOTHING to do with it!Which to me, for research writers, is a complete FAIL! To the point I wouldn't trust whatever is in the article.Am I wrong?"
DaVita is up 6.81% to 79.04
"Ouch. John Oliver pretty much lampooned the boss, the business model, and the company's ethics on last night's show on HBO."
"In all likelihood buffet will increase his stake in the coming quarter, this is a long term buy"
