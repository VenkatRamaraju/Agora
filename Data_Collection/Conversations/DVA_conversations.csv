Just on CNBC Jim Chanos(sp?) shorting DVA for Years and questions Berkshire being involved - they still have 24%.A couple comments. Berkshire doesn't ALWAYS make the best moves. Look at the first time that I know of that they bought a Company with another investor(who is slash n loot) from Brazil with Kraft Heinz. You can see what a mis-step that was.And actually it was Warren's 2 new hires that both had bought DVA that they had to file 10% ownership not long after they had started.Now DVA is at 24% and I believe have a standstill agreement. Which is why I questioned DVA announced a significant buyback not long ago which would increase Berkshire's % ad if that would cause any issues.I am long DVA(common and I had sold some common and bought deep in the money calls that are now up 59%.It will be interesting to hear why it is shorted. We already know that all profits come from the little sliver of private pay for Davita and Frenesius.Capital intensive but a necessary service. And since to me it has a lot of characteristics of a Utility I have always thought they should have a dividend.Let the games begin. I have made decent money trading DVA over Years. Virtually all the common and calls I own are with the House's money.I had wanted this to be one of my 4 largest holdings but it just can't seem to get there!2 folks with WAY more money and information that I will lever have. Time to grab the popcorn and decide if there is an opportunity to make money here.And I have been long BRKB's for a very long time. Although I sold a bunch when their split was announced and shortly after that split.Chenos to be on CNBC shortly but I have to leave so I won't see it.
DVA is trading in extremely oversold territory and and should be bought at these bargain basement price for HUGE gains!!!— Play the rebound in this global sector leader and best of breed business!
Wondering if anyone has heard chatter on DaVita trialing the new Infomed dialysis machines?
"Still wondering where this will go today? With other words, do you sell today?"
"hopefully, DVA stays the way it is now for long term investment. I've had confidence with this company that leading by a few smart guys I knew of in the company. I've did bought 1,000 shares at $46 on June-6-2019 and keep for mine kids' educations in colleagues."
"The real magic here and why Berkshire owns over 1/3 of the company is the disappearing share count. If you look at the last 10 years, the share count was as high as 215 million shares. Today it is approaching 100 million."
"DVA is in “oversold zone”, and languishing in the bargain bin!"
"COVID Risk?Is there a risk to DVA business model because of COVID? dialysis patients are in tight proximity in dialysis centers with 20-30 other patients for 4 hours per session three (3) days per week. The medical staff work at multiple clinics and could potentially transmit disease. Most clinics are in metropolitan areas. End stage renal disease patients requiring dialysis are mostly over 65 years of age and have underlying medical conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, immunosuppression and are often overweight. Similar profile for those at greatest risk of serious COVID infections.The map of dialysis locations nation wide looks a lot like the map of confirmed COVID cases https://www.optum.com/solutions/population-health/clinical-management/medical-benefit-management/kidney-solutions.htmlWhat is DaVita doing to protect their fragile patients? What is the rate of COVID positive care givers in dialysis clinics? Does DaVita provide infection rate information to their patients? Do the air handling systems in the dialysis clinics have HEPA filters?"
This is a tremendous buying opportunity into an illogical and temporary oversold moment that could be interpreted as “free gains”!!!
Sls exstending lives of cancer patients with lead drug Gps. Patients surviving 21 months when treated with Gps and only 5 months without Gps. $Billions of market cap incoming for this small bio. Look at real news sources to confirm this :-).
What is the deal here??? The last month with this stock has been nothing but a total beat down.... I'm to the point now where I dread looking to see how far down this has fallen every day. Any thoughts before earnings come out Thursday???
Why is DVA down so much today? I cannot find any news.
Warren buffet holds 20 percent of DVA
"Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B +1.4%) (BRK.A +1.4%) discloses a 33% stake in Davita (DVA -0.7%), up from 31.7% in a filing dated Sept. 21, 2020."
"Friday closed about 58, Tuesday shortly after open it's at 52 on no news!No news on AMTD or Yahoo atleast.Crazy!I recently sold some trading shares since I have purchased Jan 2021 37.50 already that were up significantly so I was doing the old ""stock replacement"" strategy.I mean a lot of big players can certainly move this around. Question is why. And should us individual Investors be concerned about any issues other than a large holder(s) potentially dumping."
"I like this company for an earnings play, am going long in a few minutes, expecting an earnings beat and positive guidance going forward. Only going to do 100 shares, because I see risks and headwinds going forward that might reduce the likelihood of a serious pop up even on a good earnings report. CVS looks much better as an earnings play, but this one is good enough for me to put 100 shares at risk to the long side."
"What does Berkshire and other billion dollar hedge funds see in this company? Either the market is inefficient and can't price this security, or there is something many disagree on. Is it litigation risk? Healthcare reform risk? Company seems to throw off good cash flow. Anyone?"
