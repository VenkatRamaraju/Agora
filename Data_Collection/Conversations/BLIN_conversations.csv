If you find this useful through a thumb up and I’ll try to put it when it have time. I think is very useful.Cheers"
Who is waiting for the Pre Market to arrive? This is when this stock shines like a diamond!
Moon sell now… then buy back at $6 … 
"Buy and hold, this will go over $15 tomorrowLow float!"
"I believe todays pullback was healthy for the stock price, it corrected a very high temporary overbought condition. Now it is better positioned to go higher. Last check there was no short stock available on Fidelity, so it looks like the short interest is still in play and the very small float makes it a easy target for the hedge funds to push it higher. Watch the volume tomorrow. If it does explode higher enough to squeeze out some of the shorts consider maybe taking some profit, it could quickly turn from short squeeze to bull trap for retail buyers up there. I don't know how high or how low it will go but it will be interesting either way. Good luck everyone, make some money!"
"I posted email from BLIN , about quarter Report on STOCKTWITS , if interested go there ."
"PAYtience guy’s ,we got this   hold and buy buy"
HOOOOOOOODLLLLL
"Perhaps selloff has started many investors made $$$$ during the week, and do not want to hold BLIN over the weekend which is normal. Perhaps, we’ll see an positive increase on Monday.This is normal. Think all the money you’ve this week. Go to the liquor store. Get a bottle of you favorite spirit, buy some Ribeye, and do some grilling tonight.For those who are in the red. Well, next week is going to be a good week. Or buy more to average down. BLIN is a great stock. Let’s see where we end up today. We have a long day still."
Where is the one commenting about swing trading hahahha delete post
Just keep holding!
"The shorties are giving a false picture to lure seller to start selling at these lower price so that when the market open, they the shorties will issue a buy order at a higher price in order to match or secure these already placed selling orders. The goal is not to buy at a much higher prices like $30 or $40 or $50. The shorties are trying to minimize their losses! in the short term versus higher losses in the long term."
just hold
"In all of the meme stock I'm watching, only $BLIN has a lower market cap. If you want cheap, you have found it."
Compare the chart $mrin and $blin it’s identical.. it’s just manipulation.. they looking for the panic seller... HOLD and we going to fly 
$WIMI $BLIN $MRNA should be green tomorrow.

"Volume in aftermarket t can easily be manipulated, it takes a little to move the SP. I'd only look at the last couple hours of pre-market and, given how well this consolidated today, we will likely gap up."

Hong Kong used to be the financial HUB for the whole Southeast Asia before it failed in to the control of China regime.

"10 RATIONAL REASONS WHY CNET SHOULD BE $10 SOON1) Recently 2 companies that I was calling for the past 6 months (BLIN & MRIN), rallied above 800%. CNET has the same exact parameters as BLIN & MRIN. People are looking for micro cap stocks with similar parameters of BLIN and MRIN2) CNET is an artificial Intelligence (AI) , integrated digital marketing, data analytics and blockchain company. Yet CNET It has a tiny P/S of 1.2 which is very low compared to other AI and blockchain stocks which have P/S above 10 and even 203) CNET was approved as a marketing provider for KOLs & by Tencent. Tencent is the biggest internet co in China & serves over 1.2 billion users. Cent is adding blockchain to enhance the accuracy of its digital marketing.4) CNET offered on Feb 18 2021 that entered into agreement with institutional investors for $18.7M shares at a price of $3.59 per share. The MM of CNET should soon push it above $2.59 to bring the institutional investors to profit. Otherwise WS will not trust it anymore5) 11) CNET has a 21% naked short ratio . Per Fintel, CNET has only 800K shares available to short & high short Borrow Rate of 48%6) CNET is getting new orders almost every week from China, Asia and Germany. CNET is an international company with a micro cap of $50M !7) CNET CEO said on Q1 : We expect to end the year with a 40% increase in monthly active customers across all lines of our business8) CNET will have huge growth since its customers, small business companies have a better business after Covid is fading . CNET is also very healthy as it has just tiny debt of $2M and $15M cash (from WSJ)9) CNET has a tiny 17M shares float and a healthy 19% insider holding ( from WSJ). Yahoo says 24M float but WSJ is more accurate. (from WSJ)10) CNET has Levered Free Cash Flow of 4.2M. None of the other AI companies are even making money."

That's an unfavorable swing of $1.9MM. Where do we go from here? Revenues as a top line is higher and that's good. But is the focus for the company going to be sales?? or profits. Personally, I would rather sales of $10 bucks with a profit of 7 bucks versus sales of 100 bucks with a profit of 13 bucks. means my profit margin is higher and my operating expenses are lower and thus I make more money."

I recommend buying the dip and then sitting on it, because this this could quite easily become a $20.00 stock soon!…….BLIN as we all know is a $20.00 stock just waiting to happen, GLTA"
Just bought more…. Thanks for the dip.
Monday we should continue to rise
Very frustrated by this stock. It’s like people have moved on when there was so much potential to drive it up fast. It’s a cheap stock where people can buy a ton of it.
