I heard about BLIN the other day on (http://Multistockalerts.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
"Mrin is not just pump and dump…today is last chance to get below $10, result is coming out after hours today and company is expecting better quarter result thn previous. Definitely we’ll se $17-$18 range."
This is looking like a buildup to a Strong closing hr 
"Buy & hold... .. All the new contracts they got it’s just good news  people who hold will get rewarded and the rest who panicsell will say soon enough “ I should’ve, could’ve, would’ve”"

Hong Kong used to be the financial HUB for the whole Southeast Asia before it failed in to the control of China regime. Now all International Financial banking and companies are moving out from Hong Kong to Singapore because Singapore is a democratic and capitalist country. Would you imagine how much cloud space and security needed for storing financial data? Here is why BLIN's product is needed.

"I guess the market one thinks this company is worth 7.50$ one day and think it's worth just 5.93$ a share the following day. Pretty bipolar to me lol!!! Got to love the stock market and it's giant manipulators. Good company and growing, Usual bcrap lol!!!"
"guys any update, why down?"
LIFT OFF
"BLIN, XELA and OBSAT, buy the dip on BLIN it’s gonna go much higher soon, EXELA has the attention of Retail investors but there’s been an increase in order flow from very large buyers as well., this could quite easily double its share value in the near future!, as for OSAT , expect a pull back today after yesterday’s amazing moon shot!, this is one company that demands attention, their just in the right place at the right time!, after yesterday’s news regarding their partnership with ALIBABA OSAT ran up to almost $15.00 but then settled at the E.O.D at around $9.00. I recommend buying the dip and then sitting on it, because this this could quite easily become a $20.00 stock soon!…….BLIN as we all know is a $20.00 stock just waiting to happen, GLTA"
Hold hold hold

"I posted email from BLIN , about quarter Report on STOCKTWITS , if interested go there ."

"Welp...that's that. The hype is officially over. OPM went from $150M at 6/30/20 to ($615k) at 6/30/21. An unfavorable swing of $785k YOY. NPM went from ($1.7MM) at 6/30/20 to ($3.6MM) at 6/30/21. That's an unfavorable swing of $1.9MM. Where do we go from here? Revenues as a top line is higher and that's good. But is the focus for the company going to be sales?? or profits. Personally, I would rather sales of $10 bucks with a profit of 7 bucks versus sales of 100 bucks with a profit of 13 bucks. means my profit margin is higher and my operating expenses are lower and thus I make more money."
