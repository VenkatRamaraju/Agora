"I have travelled with $fgen, $freq, $odt, $blue when it fell 40% in one day and takes several weeks to recover. Best bed is wait for 3/4 days before buying."
"positive results, down 45%, makes no sense"
$ODT Not a single institutional investor or insider has sold for months. https://fintel.io/so/us/odt
This is way oversold on good news!! It will get back to $30 soon!!!
Offering is 1-2 punch to shareholders.Who dilutes their shareholders after stock is down 50% in 2 days?Unbelievable!
There is a 'Notice of Effectiveness' just posted on SEC activity. Jumping up AH. Some insider buys too. I don't have experience with what a notice of effectiveness does but investopedia says it is for an amendment to corporate charter. Perhaps the formality to record the registration for share offering but not sure.
Odonate Therapeutics Files to Offer Up to $150 Mln in Shares
Wellington Group 3+ mil. shares purchased per SEC 13-G. It is amended though and I can't tell what's changed. Total ownership just under 10% now. Cheers.
"all I can figure is that the results were misread by a few key players and that caused a negative feedback with investors, margin calls are responsible for the remainder of the decline"
It’s strange that insiders were buying so much in end of 2020 in the range of $15. And institutional holding of 90% based on MarketBeat data ?
no volume just profit takersLONG and STRONG
Here is what I think this company is worth. You had 157 million in cash then subtract out 5.3 million in debt. You are left with 151 million but that is before any operating expenses. If we can assume a 2.4 million weekly cash burn at least through q1 2021 we can assume a 31 million cash burn. So take 151 minus cash burn of 31 you are left with roughly 120 million. Take 120 million cash and divide by 38.6 million shares. You are left with 3.10 a share in cash. I believe this stock is worth around $3 a share
Nick Schommer (Janus Henderson Group) owns about 1.7m shares in ODT. If u sell now on good news you are only giving away your shares cheap to the market makers.
"Why is anyone still pumping this? Here’s an excerpt from March article “the pharmaceutical company said it will wind down operations following disappointing data from its cancer treatment. The company said it determined, following feedback from the Food and Drug Administration in a pre-New Drug Application (pre-NDA) meeting, that tesetaxel, an orally administered chemotherapy agent, is unlikely to receive FDA approval. ""Therefore, the company is discontinuing the development of tesetaxel and will wind down the operations of the company,"" the company said in a statement.”"
"I'm not short but did you all read through the results? There were pretty significant additional side effects compared to the control group. I wouldn't be very confident they could get fda approval with those results. I guess the improvement in overall survival results will really be the determining factor. Hopefully they are better than the PFS results. My aunt was recently diagnosed with breast cancer. So, I have a sincere hope that all drug trials have great results."
Great news! So why are we taking a hair cut? Is it just MM allowing some blocks to get a bargain price before major upside or something else? Press release looks very good. I don't think I've seen this type of reaction in a biotech to great news.
This must have blindsided insiders. They were buying huge amounts in December. CEO and and several directors.
"Skeptical: Over 70% of patients experienced neutropenia (grade 3 or worse) with tesetaxel. For this reason, I cannot imagine this drug becoming widely adopted. In the short-term, the insider purchasing will elevate the stock, but in the long-term I don't think it will hold."
"I have about 1k share here with average 18 dollar a share ..but truly don’t know a lot beside they are making oral medicine for breast cancer and tang have 12 millions share and bought over 150 millions worth of stock for average of 25 dollar a share , I’am not leaving before I double my money ."
Should we sell or hold?
company has no other products or pipeline.. Just a blank company with nothing now
"I've seen this before. You get suckered into believing it's ""down too much"". Then the next day you wake up and its down another 15%. Avoid this thing is my advice"
$ODT just upgraded to buy: https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/odt/forecast
87 million shares traded today the most in the entire stock market with people buying $30 calls amazing.
"$ODT is flush with 157m cash, more than it's 119m market cap. It will surely start another drug trial or two or more and bounce right back."
"Here's my estimate all things considered for Monday:Shares Price Market Value 8/28/2020 32,100,000.00 x 17.91 = $574,911,000.008/31/2020 5,614,036.00 x 14.25 = 80,000,013.00 Totals 37,714,036.00 $654,911,013.00 Estimated Post Offering Share Price:Total MV $654,911,013.00÷Total Shares 37,714,036.00 Share Price $17.37"
Supposed to be earning call today but no hope
"$ODT Value = cash minus shutdown costs = 157m - 14m = 143m so value is $3.63/share. If they get acquired or start another drug trial, value much higher. Very high reward, zero risk."
What is causing this run up? Anyone?
"At this point with the company closing down and no other products, why would someone even pay 1c for this company?? Its done, last one out turn off the light!"
buying opportunity now?
"More insider buying from Boxer Capital as well as Kevin Tang, transaction date was 9/28 for both."

Apparently I am the only person that owns this stock. Maybe I need to rethink this investment.
Contessa 2 data is coming Q1 and Trio study is moving along. Very promising.
"Folks, this was great news. Don't be disappointed by the lack of any huge movement to the upside. It will be among a host of treatments for metastatic breast cancer and that's a good thing. I expect many more positives to come ultimately with the treatment coming to market and becoming accepted. We're in!"
"And more...CEO, 10% Owner Kevin C Tang bought 275,784 shares of ODT stock on 12/23/2020 at the average price of $15.16.Nice!"
"I can only make the following conclusions. The news was good (not great, but good). This is oversold. It is being manipulated somehow. Stay the course and perhaps add more. I'm willing to wait on this. Long term is very good. Patients (and patience) are the key. I hope that this helps some women with this awful disease. My first Wife passed from metastatic breast cancer and I hold out hope that there will a breakthrough one day. That's what's most important and I can hold the bag on the stock for a while.GLTA"
Another large insider buy ($7M) - this one from Boxer Capital:https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1465914/000089924320035534/xslF345X03/doc4.xml
"Hi longs, are you understanding something about what is happening to this stock?not me!P.M. yesterday, + 40%.Closing only + 8%A.M. and P.M. today - 7% !!"
