ATNX just dropped 50% because the FDA rejected their oral paclitaxel because it caused neutropenia in breast cancer patients.
ODT reached a new All Time High at 31.98
40% of institutions dump there shares in the yesterday P&D. Happy i sold early morning and took only a 3% loss. Expect this to go to 0 verry soon. Its over.

When will shorts cover ?
crooked tang
 %. AGREED. AN AWESOME OPPORTUNITY HERE$30 minimum today
TANG KEEPS ADDING ANOTHER LJPC
"They have 120 million in cash , so why would they need anther public offering"
"I^m not in or short on this one.. But wouldn^t bet on it rom the looks of it.They have filed shelf sale of 100 Mio $ worth of shares.Seems no other Prods in Pipeline, at least no info's on their pageNo information on web-page what so ever on current status & next steps of plannings..They still show 19$ / share on their page.. Seems no one care on updates there too...Recap: Big risky lottery stock bet if you want to play"
"time to buy all massive short squeeze up, we do +400% easly if comes a little reverse news or not confirmation of this, will be massive up"
Did you all see the results and price action for GLSI? I did some pretty thorough research and it seems that those results were from one of 4 arms of a trial that ended almost 4 years ago. And there were an insane number of insider traded between 2 weeks and 3 months ago. Looks quite a big like some type of fraud.
ODT is up 8.05% to 22.69
ODT in oversold territory! 1 hour ago here on yahoo very impressive analysis of turn around and bargain basement acquisition of shares. Rather buy here than $4+ Just look at this chart with risk/reward very favorable for investing here. https://schrts.co/PrypnKqD
"""Odonate is discontinuing the development of tesetaxel and will wind down the operations of the Company"". At this point, the only buying is from short-sellers closing their positions."
Why is this still dropping?
"ODT is going to rebound hard tommorrow !!!!!!!! SHORT POSITIONS MUST BE CLOSED !!!! ALREAY GREEN IN AFTER, TOMORROW A +50% AT LEAST"
"Skeptical: Over 70% of patients experienced neutropenia (grade 3 or worse) with tesetaxel. For this reason, I cannot imagine this drug becoming widely adopted. In the short-term, the insider purchasing will elevate the stock, but in the long-term I don't think it will hold."
"I'm not short but did you all read through the results? There were pretty significant additional side effects compared to the control group. I wouldn't be very confident they could get fda approval with those results. I guess the improvement in overall survival results will really be the determining factor. Hopefully they are better than the PFS results. My aunt was recently diagnosed with breast cancer. So, I have a sincere hope that all drug trials have great results."
Worthless and will need to liquidatehttp://stocktwits.com/Joker86/message/307066909
ODT reached a new All Time High at 29.24
It’s strange that insiders were buying so much in end of 2020 in the range of $15. And institutional holding of 90% based on MarketBeat data ?
Nick Schommer (Janus Henderson Group) owns about 1.7m shares in ODT. If u sell now on good news you are only giving away your shares cheap to the market makers.
"this company has CASH, why they want to file BK ?? i don't get it"
Going up after dilution?
So quiet in here. Nice action this week especially after hours. Very nice indeed.
closing doors.. Common holders pennies on dollar.. BK
They have full time 137 employees versus lot of bogus Pharma companies on exchange . If they have stopped testing oftesetaxel ...that doesn't mean they are not developing other products . Company PR should come out and protect stock holders and talk about company's next success and development . I hope that they come out with news ....This is time for them to show the cards versus folding here
What with the rise?
Oraxol from ATNX has so much better favorable side effects profile and it's about to be approved in two months.
Party is over her. The last person in the office please turn off the lights.
"This should be much higher, at least $1B market cap, tons of studies have been done, all with good results"
ODT exploded and I missed out because I wasn’t listening to the great folks over at (http://Fairstox.com). The next big winner won’t miss me. Don’t let it miss you either. Join them now
Who is buying and why?
"all I can figure is that the results were misread by a few key players and that caused a negative feedback with investors, margin calls are responsible for the remainder of the decline"
"At end of last Q, Co. has $157M cash. Assuming they spend $30M in current Q, they are trading at cash value right now."
is this an under rated stock? 
Up almost $3.89 today and not a peep out of folks. There are 32 million shares being held by someone because I didn't buy that many shares.
"Any estimates on FDA approval/timeline? (eg, 75% chance of FDA approval; timeline Sept 2021)"
ODT is down -5.63% to 19.61
Anyone know why this is growing ? #ODT
"This is done, sorry longs."
dump it now I did at a loss
Probably down till Friday and still -25-30% from current price if scenario similar to Acasti from last year happens...
"It is inappropriate and irresponsible to assume this company is going to become a SPAC. Have they said this one singular time? They haven't so why even speculate and spread misinformation about ""you think they will become a spac""."
What the frank just happened
"More dilution, this will go from $17 to $16 tomorrow. Maybe even in the $15's"
$ODT Not a single institutional investor or insider has sold for months. https://fintel.io/so/us/odt

"Wow what a suprise,,long time ago i got this and waiting to jump back to 10ish values ;))"
"this company feels like a fraud case. it showed publicly good results of its trial 3 last year andsold more stock last August, why all of a sudden to shut down company ?? expect law suits comingfrom investors"
I was in this when it was owned by Genta. Great product and will be approved as long as funding will get it there.
About 3 million outstanding shorts are waiting in the wing all the way thru $6Any news is good news at this price.
love this guy that sold at a loss and tried to make it back shorting a stock that already lost 75%
ODT is up 8.33% to 20.41
Wow! What's happening post-market?
Odt upgraded to buy https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/odt/forecast
It seems all company website are closing down. It may file bankruptcy in the near future.
Huge buying opportunity! They have 157 million cash and other options!
ODT is up 6.50% to $16.23
"On March 22, 2021, ODT stated that the clinical data package for tesetaxel is unlikely to endorse FDA approval, based on input from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) at a pre-New Drug Application conference. As a result, Odonate is shuttering the production of tesetaxel and is winding down its operations. Patients in current tesetaxel clinical trials will be transitioned to effective alternative treatments in collaboration with clinical sites."
"CEO stopped buying, must be a time limit for impropriety"
Wow I had sold a put expiring last Friday at 25 and 30....made money off those. This info could have easily come out last Friday and it didn’t....saved me a lot of money. I’m puzzled a little bit too. It is down 30% on at worst news considered neutral.
"Adam Feuerstein @adamfeuerstein - Il y a 37 minutesJefferies' Yee on $ODT Feb. 27: An approval for competitor $ATNX would be positive for $ODT. BUY! Mar. 6: $ATNX was rejected, that’s also good for $ODT. BUY! Mar. 22: $ODT disontinuing/shutting down. Possible reverse merger candidate! HOLD? (sorry, not sorry)"
"After enjoying the ride on $blue, $fgen, $odt, $freq moment, added 16K in total. Soon $advm is going break the silent and fly."
Nice! Must be selling a lot of lemonade today. Hope it holds.
"Another insider buy, Aaron Davis."
At one point today this was up $1.47 and I've noticed a recurring theme here. It's been doing this a few times a week but on low volume. No new insider buys that I can see. It is interesting though.
"TRY CALLING THE COMPANY, THEIR PHONES DON'T WORK, THEY FAILED TO GIVE NOTICE ON HOW MANY ADDITIONAL SHARES WERE SOLD, SO NOBODY KNOWS THE NEW TOTAL OUTSTANDING AMOUNT. NO ONE KNOWS WHAT PRICE THE DEAL WAS AT. THIS WHOLE COMPANY SMELLS OF FRAUD. I'M BRINGING IN THE LAWYERS."
ODT is down -8.08% to 16.60
Get in below $3. Cash on hand will be enough for one year of operation without any other researchs in pipeline.
$ODT just upgraded to buy: https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/odt/forecast
For those of you who didn't see this.... largely reason there was a sell offhttps://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/shareholder-alert-pomerantz-law-firm-investigates-claims-on-behalf-of-investors-of-odonate-therapeutics-inc---odt-301118444.html
"Sell or hold? There isnt any new news about odonate, so wondering if theyr really shutting things down or still trying with tesetaxel (if they could get approval)?"
"This has a price target so bullish, check it out, it has a +1000% price target https://www.investorsobserver.com/symbols/odt"
Great news! So why are we taking a hair cut? Is it just MM allowing some blocks to get a bargain price before major upside or something else? Press release looks very good. I don't think I've seen this type of reaction in a biotech to great news.
"Side Effects were significantly higher with this drug, making it less desirable."

Looks like the CEO is buying a lot of shares that are sending the price hike. Maybe he knows the company is about to be sold? Would buy if it goes red....
The company said it will close it's DOORS !!!
"This is getting ridiculous, I hope tang didn’t sell any of his 14 million share"
Today almost 6X more trading volume than the day it fell 80%Whoever was buying it waited until regular hour this morning to pounce.Something is up. This is not retail money.
What on earth just happened AH?
yesterday 12m turnover 3time than normal 3.5m someone collectingno risk in this prices just chances
Couple months ago insiders bought at$17 like millions of shares. Omg that’s terrible.
"OMG, I am witnessing the mid stages of a pump and dump! This is surreal, most last for just day, but this has momentum.After getting burned in about 5 of these cycles, I will be diligent not to be a bag holder."
Where is WallStreetBets when you need 'm?
"I've seen this before. You get suckered into believing it's ""down too much"". Then the next day you wake up and its down another 15%. Avoid this thing is my advice"
Is there a reason for rebound? Didn’t they say they are winding down operations and closing doors?
Maybe this will turn into SPAC and buy a private pharmaceutical.. I don’t know why I bought 200 shares... lol
"We go up from here, prepare for a huge upside of +100%. They gonna close all shorts today. Massive short short squeeze up coming."
How many shorts in here now I wonder? They're going to fry tomorrow.
ODT is up 4.96% to $15.66
ODT is back and will be trading at 30's in no time
"ODT has a high of $27 in the last 6 months, giving ODT a price recovery price target of roughly 750% possible gains throughout the year. CNN has 3 Hold ratings, with 1 sell rating, which puts ODT in a great position for short term investors who plan to sell when ODT is upgraded to a buy rating in the near future."
"Tang just filed to buy another 1M plus shares to add to his holdings. Gotta admit, the guy has a lot of skin in the game and must still believe in ODT. Otherwise this makes no sense and I do not see why he would just throw good money after bad. This is the largest position in Tang capital by far so it seems counter-intuitive that there would be something improper here. He does get in at $14.25 though."
wind down the operations of the Company. (that's a quote from them)folks just google that .
"Market is in pain bc correction. It's not crashing bc in order for MAKRET TO CRASH, IBB, NASDAQ and DOW JONES have to crash at the same time at least 2 weeks. This is not crashing..it's correction"

"imo, the sell off pretty much done or very slow down and not much downside from here. There is a good chance it will rebound from here"
Apparently I am the only person that owns this stock. Maybe I need to rethink this investment.
"Shares of Odonate Therapeutics (NASDAQ: ODT) were crashing 78% as of 11:38 a.m. EDT on Monday. The huge drop came after Odonate announced that it's discontinuing the development of tesetaxel and will ""wind down the operations of the Company."""

"$ODT is flush with 157m cash, more than it's 119m market cap. It will surely start another drug trial or two or more and bounce right back."
I hope I’am not making a mistake here but i’am adding few hundreds share
"Data is excellent, this drug is not meant to be the best cure , it meant to be an alternative for people who don’t want to go to chemotherapy clinic and set next to 5 other patients, the side effects only for 5 % ...or less .. otherwise no side effects, I don’t think they will wait for fda approval before selling the company, I think the right price is 3 b or 70-80 dollar a share before fda approval and before submitting and application, This is a 5 years study that was successful. I’am not heavily invested in this company 1k share only but I might go heavy.. I’am thinking about it . Don’t be fooled by this sp drop ceo own 46% of the company and invested about 100 millions plus 5 years with zero salary plus buying all the patents and that’s maybe anther 100 million . 1 pill every 2nweeks compared to injection in a clinic,"
"Living 2.9 months longer is great, but not really the point here. That's all the drug did. Oh, and less hair loss. They made a big deal about that. Who cares. Extending life is the point, I think they need to add a lot more than that. Just what I got out of it anyway"
Can anyone give an honest assessment about the prospects of this company? I own a few hundred shares but would consider buying more if someone has a compelling argument for potential success here. Oh it is trading near a 52 week low so now seems to be the time to jump in￼￼
ODT is down -12.26% to 24.48
"Why is anyone still pumping this? Here’s an excerpt from March article “the pharmaceutical company said it will wind down operations following disappointing data from its cancer treatment. The company said it determined, following feedback from the Food and Drug Administration in a pre-New Drug Application (pre-NDA) meeting, that tesetaxel, an orally administered chemotherapy agent, is unlikely to receive FDA approval. ""Therefore, the company is discontinuing the development of tesetaxel and will wind down the operations of the company,"" the company said in a statement.”"

"All kinds of rumors flying on stocktwits. One poster thinks a private merger to sell off the company and lift up price. Insiders invested huge amounts. Originally I thought smokescreen but too much was invested. It's just reality (a bad one). IMO, right now isn't the time to cash out. Short have to cover which will be buying pressure and price bounce. Who knows when."
"Does winding down the company really mean closing, "
Hmmm what’s up guys! Seems my order got filled at close and somehow I’m already up in equity? Coolio! Probably because the bid/ask is so wide! That’s okay! ! Here’s hoping I’m a genius and this has atleast a small bounce back tomorrow! That a crazy sell off!!! Seemed a bit excessive to me! I’ve been wrong before though! Gltal!

Here is what I think this company is worth. You had 157 million in cash then subtract out 5.3 million in debt. You are left with 151 million but that is before any operating expenses. If we can assume a 2.4 million weekly cash burn at least through q1 2021 we can assume a 31 million cash burn. So take 151 minus cash burn of 31 you are left with roughly 120 million. Take 120 million cash and divide by 38.6 million shares. You are left with 3.10 a share in cash. I believe this stock is worth around $3 a share

This company's management were so incompetent and irresponsible that they didn't add another product to their pipeline by acquiring smaller companies or licensing when they could easily do it when their share price was above 20.

$ODT at this low price has 18% more cash than it's market cap. A total steal of a buy and rightly upgraded to buy with rsi<23! https://finance.yahoo.com/news/odonate-therapeutics-odt-oversold-recover-111711921.html
"No news is bad news. Put out a PR, sell lemonade or something!"
ODT is up 5.60% to 20.55
There is a 'Notice of Effectiveness' just posted on SEC activity. Jumping up AH. Some insider buys too. I don't have experience with what a notice of effectiveness does but investopedia says it is for an amendment to corporate charter. Perhaps the formality to record the registration for share offering but not sure.
This is probably just normal retracement and we could drop back to around $18 short term. This is normal and healthy.
"I have travelled with $fgen, $freq, $odt, $blue when it fell 40% in one day and takes several weeks to recover. Best bed is wait for 3/4 days before buying."
exciting stock
Another large insider buy ($7M) - this one from Boxer Capital:https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1465914/000089924320035534/xslF345X03/doc4.xml
Best CEO and world class management! I suggest you people stop complaining and go all in!!!! $50 price target!
@conradn1 help me understand how this recovers with no other candidates in the pipeline? I sure hope you are right!
Cash value of ODT is over $4.75 per share.....
glad I shorted at $17 3 weeks ago I knew this day would come will cover half of my 8k shares at $5 and the rest if it goes to $3
