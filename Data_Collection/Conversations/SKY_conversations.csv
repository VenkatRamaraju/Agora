"Read the analysis of the Street Sweeper :""Once the market fully recognizes the mix-up surrounding the ticker symbol twins - plus the mobile home company's paltry growth, terrible performance compared with rivals, unjustifiable price and the director's stock selling spree - we believe Skyline will lurch back to earth.TheStreetSweeper fully expects this stock to get chopped about 40% near-term ... and that would still be a generous valuation.""-> Very overvalued stock !"

I wonder how many of SKY’s appliances are waiting to be unloaded off Long Beach? Does anybody know how long it takes to get your shipping container off-loaded? I’ve heard it now takes north of 10 extra days to unload a container ship. Any production delays yet?

I was in this 3 months ago heavy. I still believe it's a great company. It traded at almost $36 per share less than 2 months ago. today it dropped under $11 per share !
"SKY is 6% short. With this kind of extreme low volume, short squeeze will be interesting and huge."
Happy to have discovered this stock as it breaks out of a ascending base pattern with volume. Great chart… great fundies. Also unknown to the financial taking heads. Man.. this is good.

"I am long $SQ & $GSKY I hope square will do what $GSKY does. I bought GSKY just for a trade. so far it collapsed. what bothers me about $SKY that its income increased just 4M year over year. It went up from 99m to 103 m, Not a great growth, Moreover, Seems like there is some sort of manipulation driving $GSKY down from $27 to below $23 in few days without a news. insiders cannot sell stock during a lock up and quiet period. Some groups are manipulating the stock without any news. Seems like it is on a way to $20. Then smart money will step in and start buying or it will collapse to $10"
Why did this crash so much this time last year (2018)? Anyone know because I’m curious

"Just read about SKY on Joe Duarte's column he puts out on Mondays. This is the 2nd time I've seen him mention this very good company and stock. He's still very positive on it due to the fact that the low end housing market continues to do well, and will do even better with falling interest rates. Long Term chart shows its trying to complete a huge cup formation with a prior peak of 35 and change achieved in July 2018. I bought 1/2 of what I wanted today with very possible new leg down in overall Market occurring into mid October."
