"FWIW, I added at the close today when the price was about $74.50. Hope that doesn't jinx it for everyone. I think we are seeing some people selling stuff to raise money to pay their taxes. This is about the last day to sell something and have it clear to write checks to the IRS"

"Graco announces additional 18 million shares to be purchased off of market: If that was the plan, why did they do a stock split a year ago? They issued more shares only to repurchase them??"
I work here. In SD alone we have bought 30 mill in new machines in the last 6 months. stock will go higher.

"Big firm news yesterday, GGG reported its detailed performance in the past year. The earnings reported by a firm often differ from its cash flows. This distinction, referred to as ""accruals"", speaks to the firm’s estimation of profits not yet received. see http://www.financial-education-hub.com/1/GGG. Nevertheless, the estimation is not perfect. For example, managers may abuse accruals to adjust earnings, resulting in low future profits. This suggests that a firm is likely to perform poorly in the coming years as compared to firms that have the same reported earnings but lower accruals."
How does a company in this market trade at a trailing PE of over 25? This is a cyclical company whose earnings are going to get cut bigtime like they did in the last recession. The real PE is now probably closer to 50.

Earnings in about 3 weeks (Oct. 21). I have to think we get another decent report. It will really be the first with the new CEO fully in control and I expect he would like to hit the ground running.
Another good earnings report. Record earnings and revenues along with a positive outlook for the rest of the year.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/graco-reports-record-sales-operating-201000765.html

"Another good earnings report, but likely already baked into the share price considering the run up since the last report from $110 to $128. I will be surprised if it goes up more, and we may get a little pull back."
"Well, I figured we would drop this morning, but I didn't get started early enough and the shares recovered to $46 from under $42 before I noticed. Oh well. That's what I get for being lazy."

"Another great report, but the shares dropped 10% after the last record results, so who knows what it will do this time. Another boring record for any Q1 on earnings and revenues. They always try to damp enthusiasm going forward to make it easier to keep beating the analyst's forecast."

"Well, record earnings and revenues for any Q4, but in this market I would expect to see the share price drop a little tomorrow since it was pretty much in line with expectations. I would be a buyer if it drops back to $35 or so. They have their usual forecast of 5% growth for next year.

Q3 2016 Earnings Report. Actually looks a little better than I expected from their previous guidance at the last conference call. Record revenues for any Q3 and close to record earnings for any Q3. They are still expressing caution for Q4.
They are building new facilities down the way from headquarters

"Graco was mentioned favorably in Barron's this week.The third company on our list, Graco (GGG), designs and makes industrial equipment to dispense, mix, and measure a range of coatings and fluids used for sealing cartons, keeping pipelines from corroding, and staining wood. Many are replaced frequently, which contributes to a steady free cash flow. Graco has used that free cash, up 31% last year, to develop products and push into new markets profitably. That’s helped to diversify its sources of free cash flow and keeps the stock attractive, says Christopher Bonavico, co-manager of the Jackson Square SMID-Cap Growth fund (DCGTX). Graco’s net debt to Ebitda sits at just 0.4, as it builds cash and avoids acquisitions in a frothy market."
