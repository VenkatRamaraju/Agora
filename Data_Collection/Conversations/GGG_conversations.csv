How does a company in this market trade at a trailing PE of over 25? This is a cyclical company whose earnings are going to get cut bigtime like they did in the last recession. The real PE is now probably closer to 50.
"Another good earnings report, but likely already baked into the share price considering the run up since the last report from $110 to $128. I will be surprised if it goes up more, and we may get a little pull back."
GGG is down -4.96% to 41.00
Earnings in about 3 weeks (Oct. 21). I have to think we get another decent report. It will really be the first with the new CEO fully in control and I expect he would like to hit the ground running.
"FWIW, I added at the close today when the price was about $74.50. Hope that doesn't jinx it for everyone. I think we are seeing some people selling stuff to raise money to pay their taxes. This is about the last day to sell something and have it clear to write checks to the IRS"

"Just another YAHOO Trash Message Board for Spammers - ""Why do they bother"" said Lady GaGa."
"Well, record earnings and revenues for any Q4, but in this market I would expect to see the share price drop a little tomorrow since it was pretty much in line with expectations. I would be a buyer if it drops back to $35 or so. They have their usual forecast of 5% growth for next year. Conference call will be at 11:00 AM Tuesday.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/graco-reports-record-sales-operating-211700335.html"

"During the past few weeks $GGG has been very active on LinkedIn. Posting articles every couple of days with graphene in the picture. Would love it if they could link some of their own research to it, or post some info ob the company."
GGG down $3.00 today. Did someone get an early look at the earnings? Should be out around Oct. 23.
Q3 2016 Earnings Report. Actually looks a little better than I expected from their previous guidance at the last conference call. Record revenues for any Q3 and close to record earnings for any Q3. They are still expressing caution for Q4.

"Big firm news yesterday, GGG reported its detailed performance in the past year. The earnings reported by a firm often differ from its cash flows. This distinction, referred to as ""accruals"", speaks to the firm’s estimation of profits not yet received. see http://www.financial-education-hub.com/1/GGG. Nevertheless, the estimation is not perfect. For example, managers may abuse accruals to adjust earnings, resulting in low future profits. This suggests that a firm is likely to perform poorly in the coming years as compared to firms that have the same reported earnings but lower accruals."

"Another great report, but the shares dropped 10% after the last record results, so who knows what it will do this time. Another boring record for any Q1 on earnings and revenues. They always try to damp enthusiasm going forward to make it easier to keep beating the analyst's forecast."

"Graco was mentioned favorably in Barron's this week.The third company on our list, Graco (GGG), designs and makes industrial equipment to dispense, mix, and measure a range of coatings and fluids used for sealing cartons, keeping pipelines from corroding, and staining wood. Many are replaced frequently, which contributes to a steady free cash flow. Graco has used that free cash, up 31% last year, to develop products and push into new markets profitably. That’s helped to diversify its sources of free cash flow and keeps the stock attractive, says Christopher Bonavico, co-manager of the Jackson Square SMID-Cap Growth fund (DCGTX). Graco’s net debt to Ebitda sits at just 0.4, as it builds cash and avoids acquisitions in a frothy market."
