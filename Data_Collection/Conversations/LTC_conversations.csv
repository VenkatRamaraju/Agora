"$BCH.X $BTC.X $ETH.X $LTC.X are all available directly on my PayPal App - limit of $15K I believe but that's enough to get started. Question is what blend - do I choose BTC/ETH with Market CAP over 250B and higher volumes? Or BCH / LTC which have 10B Market Cap, lower volumes. One of each?Is there a philosophy or strategy others are applying to chose their picks? Feel like higher market cap is less volatile - lower market cap could have higher returns. Welcome others insights."
By far LTC is my worst performing holding. I'll be selling soon.

Ready to see a turnaround. Getting hammered
Any thoughts on how LTC will do after this virus is over? I'm guessing a turnaround will take place in the 4th qtr of this year. Thoughts? Maybe upper $40?
With a great dividend and future looking solid as a rock this little pullback is an excellent opportunity to add some shares.

Anyone think this stock will split? Thoughts?

"It's very simple. REITS benefit from low interest rates. As the Federal Reserve has been gradually raising interest rates, the price per share of all REITs, including LTC, will fall. Do Not Fight The FED. You will lose. Sure, you will still collect your 6% dividend, but the REIT will be down 10 to 20%. You are losing money on holding REITs as the FED raises rates.

That, plus the fact we are in no way done dealing with covid and as mentioned, they are in a sensitive area in this regard. As far as where one might put their money instead for monthly payers...? no where that isn't already significantly overvalued.

What the hell is going on with LTC that their stock keeps falling? Is there something happening that has not been publicized?

I sifted through their financials and am unable to find a payout ratio or any occupancy levels. They are also vague around what % rent is received every quarter. All reits have this info readily available in their MD&A. All I can gather is that FFO per unit and div per unit are $0.57 which means 100% payout ratio.

"At 5% yield it will take 14.4 years for your investment to double in value. Can you wait that long? If so, then who cares what the Fed does and what the price of the stock is selling for?I never understood the logic of short term volatility trading. If the company is profitable, growing dividends each year, has capable management, a fat yield, frequent payouts, in a trending industry, with a growing economy,....whats with all the fret from investors? The market is paying less for companies that are more reliant to interest rate hikes which includes utilities and REITS. So what? Rates go up and down, its normal. If rates go up it just means the Fed is trying to step ahead of inflation which is a signal of a growing economy. Isn't that better than a decaying economy? All companies will benefit in the long run with growth in the economy. More money to spend for good and services. The stock market is not a place for short term bets in my opinion. Think 10 years out at least or don't invest, IMHO"

"I've owned LTC for many years. But during this challenging year, I reduced my reluctantly reduced my position as covid hit the long term care industry hard. Still, LTC seemes to have fared better then most. I'm now expecting the fundamentals to be slowly improving going forward now. with the vaccines, stimulus to provide better funding for many senior benefit programs,as well as the two pending infrastructure bills. However, fundamentals aside, take a look the charts! We are very oversold here near 52 week lows. Sooo, I'm finally adding on again for long term core retirement in my roth. GLTA"

"Question? I am considering starting a position here. This is not a partnership that issues a K-1, is it? I hate messing with K-1's at tax time. If it is, I may still buy inside an IRA?"

Buy buy buy reinvest the dividend..drip drip drip
"If you want to just break even on LTC in 2018, LTC will have to raise their dividend from 5 percent to 25 percent. LTC will continue to sell off as interest rates rise. REITS were a great investment when the FED kept interest rates at zero. Those days are over."
So much for stabilized EPS forecasts. Yikes!
"Dogecoin just surpassed $10B in market cap. It is the 8th largest cryptocurrency & is larger than $link, litecoin $ltc, and $aave"
I bought this company over 20 years ago. Great buy !
"Look at that five year chart... This low of a price is a rare sight.The pandemic hit LTC very hard, more specifically its operators that lease LTC's facilities. Some operators even had to file bankruptcies, but LTC is doing everything it can to manage the transition of its properties to new operators while selling others, and if they are successful in weathering the storm, this stock might be trading at a discount right now.The 7% yield with monthly payouts is extremely tempting too. I've traded in and out of this stock, netting a loss, but I can't shy away from the fact that ten thousand baby boomers retire everyday in the United States.What is your five year outlook for LTC? If we look beyond the pandemic, what challenge and opportunities will this company face?"
You can make good $ trading cryptocurrencies. Up 10% in 12hrs on $LTC (litecoin). Where I’ve been placing more money until this hits off

5 mil share buyback is pretty significant and a great move imo.
"WOW, What a buying opportunity!! Sold the Feb 19 2018 naked puts with a strike price of $45.00. Collected an awesome premium. The reason LTC is selling off IMO is because of Trump's massive tax cuts to medicare and medicaid in his tax bill. IMO the cuts will never take place as the AARP and the senior population will not let this pass muster. I've read that the senators and congressmen in N.Y. , Fla. , AZ, ,PA, and ME. are getting bombarded opposing Trump's tax bill. These 5 states have a massive population of seniors."

Adding to my long position very soon. The company pays a nice monthly dividend with >6% yield.
"Nothing but growth built on debt and low interest rates. As rates normalize, LTC will be crushed because debt growth will be no more."

The rating analyst from Mizuho has been negative on this company and has told his clients to short it at this price. He is just manipulating it for his benefit. Long term care got hit hard during the pandemic and earnings will only improve as care facilities increase the patient load. This REIT kept up paying the dividend as other REITS did not. I hold this position long and I am thankful for the consistent dividends.
Great buying opportunity !
I like $LTC a lot. Pays a solid monthly dividend and is up about 25% since I bought late last year. And maybe it will get a boost when people buy it mistakenly thinking it's some ridiculous cryptocurrency. :)
"As I have stated in replies to other posters. REITs will go down if interest rates go up. The 10 year yield went up to 2.52 today, and LTC hit another 52 week low. There is a very old investing rule. Do not fight the Federal Reserve. The Fed has been raising rates and they said they will continue to do so. A 5 percent yield is great but if the REIT is down 10 percent then you are losing money. Do your own research and make up your own mind. This is just my opinion as to why the entire REIT sector is in a down trend."
Good luck $SHOP and $JMIA (not to mention $ETH $LTC and $OMG !)
Bought some yesterday and will buy more if it stays around this price.
"This 'sock puppet' or paid bear @Mehmet Sakir has been shorting Lite Coin since $130, supposedly with his Dogecoin profits. Based on his profile hes pretty likeable even though he is paid to instill Fear, Uncertainty & Doubt. He likes cats, long walks in the park in the autumn and his favorite activities are bashing $OXY, $DOGE.X and $LTC.X and of course losing money for his employer"
