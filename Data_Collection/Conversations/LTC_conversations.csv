"Went all cash 2 days ago. Warned everybody bad things coming. Now i bought back in almost double my portfolio ! Could not be more happy. Sure, it could sink much more, but i am happy wity my $matic $btc $ada $ltc now. Would have lost over 25 k on my 58k portfolio. Now i doubled my portfolio, looking at 2 days ago those prices, i would have 100k now. So those are my target. All prices from 2 days ago. And once they get there, i am out of crypto and going into Blue chips. This #$%$ is getting to sick and insane. This is orcourse market manipulation at the highest level. I try to take some advantage of that, dont blame me. Took a 10% stop loss also. We will see what happens."

"If you want to just break even on LTC in 2018, LTC will have to raise their dividend from 5 percent to 25 percent. LTC will continue to sell off as interest rates rise. REITS were a great investment when the FED kept interest rates at zero. Those days are over."

"LTC is one you own for the divi but that being said, you still want a good entry point. Although the downward revisions have stabilized, for now, as well as FFO, I am holding off a bit longer for a possible washout which could take this to the low 30s perhaps. That, plus the fact we are in no way done dealing with covid and as mentioned, they are in a sensitive area in this regard. As far as where one might put their money instead for monthly payers...? no where that isn't already significantly overvalued. GAB just had a rights offering that has brought it down a bit, currently trading at NAV whereas it usually trades at a premium, ......quarterly divi. GLTA"

"As I have stated in replies to other posters. REITs will go down if interest rates go up. The 10 year yield went up to 2.52 today, and LTC hit another 52 week low. There is a very old investing rule. Do not fight the Federal Reserve. The Fed has been raising rates and they said they will continue to do so. A 5 percent yield is great but if the REIT is down 10 percent then you are losing money. Do your own research and make up your own mind. This is just my opinion as to why the entire REIT sector is in a down trend."
My shares have dropped over 20% with three more rate increases scheduled..........it may be time to take a loss and move on.

"I've owned LTC for many years. But during this challenging year, I reduced my reluctantly reduced my position as covid hit the long term care industry hard. Still, LTC seemes to have fared better then most. I'm now expecting the fundamentals to be slowly improving going forward now. with the vaccines, stimulus to provide better funding for many senior benefit programs,as well as the two pending infrastructure bills. However, fundamentals aside, take a look the charts! We are very oversold here near 52 week lows. Sooo, I'm finally adding on again for long term core retirement in my roth. GLTA"
LTC should change their ticker symbol...I am so tired of Litecoin information popping up whenever I look up information about LTC Properties.
"At 5% yield it will take 14.4 years for your investment to double in value. Can you wait that long? If so, then who cares what the Fed does and what the price of the stock is selling for?I never understood the logic of short term volatility trading. If the company is profitable, growing dividends each year, has capable management, a fat yield, frequent payouts, in a trending industry, with a growing economy,....whats with all the fret from investors? The market is paying less for companies that are more reliant to interest rate hikes which includes utilities and REITS. So what? Rates go up and down, its normal. If rates go up it just means the Fed is trying to step ahead of inflation which is a signal of a growing economy. Isn't that better than a decaying economy? All companies will benefit in the long run with growth in the economy. More money to spend for good and services. The stock market is not a place for short term bets in my opinion. Think 10 years out at least or don't invest, IMHO"

I sifted through their financials and am unable to find a payout ratio or any occupancy levels. They are also vague around what % rent is received every quarter. All reits have this info readily available in their MD&A. All I can gather is that FFO per unit and div per unit are $0.57 which means 100% payout ratio.
Like I said...$44 was a multiple bottom and should be support. Picked up 500 shares. Might add 500 more as long as support holds.
"It's very simple. REITS benefit from low interest rates. As the Federal Reserve has been gradually raising interest rates, the price per share of all REITs, including LTC, will fall. Do Not Fight The FED. You will lose. Sure, you will still collect your 6% dividend, but the REIT will be down 10 to 20%. You are losing money on holding REITs as the FED raises rates. You have been informed and warned. The 10 year bond hot a three year high of 2.76% today, and most REITs are at or very near their 52 week lows. If you like pain, continue to hold. Your decision."

Does this stock payout an ordinary or qualified monthly dividend?
I like $LTC a lot. Pays a solid monthly dividend and is up about 25% since I bought late last year. And maybe it will get a boost when people buy it mistakenly thinking it's some ridiculous cryptocurrency. :)

Why are people dumping this company
Any thoughts on the safety of the dividend? Thanks.

So much for stabilized EPS forecasts. Yikes!
"With interest rates going up, REITs will go down. LTC may still be a good REIT, but all the REITs are out of favor as The Federal Reserve continues to gradually raise rates. Banks, which benefit from rising interest rates, are doing much better than REITs."

What the hell is going on with LTC that their stock keeps falling? Is there something happening that has not been publicized?

This stock is dropping like a rock. Waiting for a little gain so I can get out.

The rating analyst from Mizuho has been negative on this company and has told his clients to short it at this price. He is just manipulating it for his benefit. Long term care got hit hard during the pandemic and earnings will only improve as care facilities increase the patient load. This REIT kept up paying the dividend as other REITS did not. I hold this position long and I am thankful for the consistent dividends.

Buy the blood. Be patient. Be rewarded. Congratulations for those that took risks and made some good gains.For those that didn’t... there are plenty of other opportunities. Just learn and move on.. the more you grind the more goodies you’ll find. Be safe out there. I’m not selling for a while... too much upside still.Stocks:$BA $JBLU $PK $TSLACrypto: $BTC $ETH $LTC $XTZ $ETCImportant to consider diversification...
Waiting for another pull back to add more.
i am buying around 30$. The P/E of this company is way to high and it is overvalued.
"If I were to look 2 or 3 years down the road, I would predict legal advertisements recruiting injured JNJ, MRNA, and PFE jab recipients and/or families affected by adverse reactions including mortality. This is the largest scandal of my lifetime. And it was all done for politics, in my opinion. Meanwhile, Sorrento has steered clear of mRNA approach, carefully navigated antibody pathways, expanded into cancer, pain, lupus, etc...I like my investment, and am willing to hold it for great future gains! I also own $INSM, $LTC.x and a retirement cash reservoir ready to invest when/if the market tanks."

"Mizuho Securities lowered its price target on LTC Properties (NYSE: LTC) to $41.00 (from $51.00) while maintaining a Neutral rating.Analyst Richard Anderson comments ""While we are generally not fans of REITs reporting very late in earnings season on the view they risk becoming afterthoughts, in this case we think LTC was justified in waiting until as much information as possible was available to share on two key situations related to Anthem Memory Care and Sunrise Assisted Living."""
