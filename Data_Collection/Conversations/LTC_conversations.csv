LTC to the Moon
I trust this enough to maintain my small position but not enough to expand it
Kinda hard to resist buyin hereThoughts
Ready to see a turnaround. Getting hammered
"I've owned LTC for many years. But during this challenging year, I reduced my reluctantly reduced my position as covid hit the long term care industry hard. Still, LTC seemes to have fared better then most. I'm now expecting the fundamentals to be slowly improving going forward now. with the vaccines, stimulus to provide better funding for many senior benefit programs,as well as the two pending infrastructure bills. However, fundamentals aside, take a look the charts! We are very oversold here near 52 week lows. Sooo, I'm finally adding on again for long term core retirement in my roth. GLTA"
I feel like I should be adding or selling. But I'm just holding
"Solid conference call, company stock has been beaten but company itself has a healthy run way."
"Dividend remains 19 cents per month. Our population isnâ€™t getting any younger. Every day in the U.S., 10,000 people turn 65, and the number of older adults will more than double over the next several decades to top 88 million people and represent over 20 percent of the population by 2050."
Added more today . I hope 4th qtr will be better
"LTC Properties, Inc.

"Look at that five year chart... This low of a price is a rare sight.The pandemic hit LTC very hard, more specifically its operators that lease LTC's facilities. Some operators even had to file bankruptcies, but LTC is doing everything it can to manage the transition of its properties to new operators while selling others, and if they are successful in weathering the storm, this stock might be trading at a discount right now.The 7% yield with monthly payouts is extremely tempting too. I've traded in and out of this stock, netting a loss, but I can't shy away from the fact that ten thousand baby boomers retire everyday in the United States.What is your five year outlook for LTC? If we look beyond the pandemic, what challenge and opportunities will this company face?"
"Covid is keeping this down and retail folks are concerned about the drop and the percentage drop. So small amounts are traded and not enough buying volume to stop the drop. They settled their Settlement Deal With Senior Care Centers, Abri Health Services. They have a good earnings model and their cash flow is fine. So I am feeling the pain but as long as they pay me dividends I am fine. I am in this for a few years."
This stock is dropping like a rock. Waiting for a little gain so I can get out.
"wow..when price goes down, nobody writes about buying....interesting"
$40 is just around the corner!!!
"At last! Our patience is being rewarded with a clear trend reversal this week! The long awaited oppertunity to add and hold is here now. Time to enjoy the long awaited trend for upward share price improvements. Great job LTC management team! You charted the course through the daunting challenges, streamlining the ballance sheet while maintaining out monthly dividends! Our hats are off to You Mz. Simpson and your talented Westlake crew for a job well done At last folks, we can see and believe we've turned the corner and we're headed back up again. All Aboard investors, Let's rool!!!"
"Yahoo insider trading shows no sells for quite a well. They just declared ""guaranteed"" monthly dividends of 19 cent per share for October, November, and December."
"Once government stops COVID related rent control or any kind of intervention, this will pop. I am adding whenever there is a dip. Senior home is a business that is not going away anytime soon."
"There appears to be no insider selling since March. Investors will get a 19 cent per share dividend today, November 30 and December 31, 2021."
