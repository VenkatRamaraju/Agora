"I work in the swim pool industry and have for the past 28 years. The past 2 years, I have never seen anything like it. It is definitely a BOOM in the building of swim pools. The pool builder I do the most of my work for. He is so backed up. If you sign contract for him to build pool, he can't come dig the hole till summer of 2023. This BOOM isn't ending anytime soon. I've always said that the pool business is recession proof. Only people who have money have swim pools. And believe me, they want their swim pool right no matter the cost."
What is with the insanely high short interest in LESL?
If the stock is undervalued why would they do a secondary offering? Is stifel the underwriter?
LOOK LIKE THE BREAKOUT IS COMING. THIS STOCK IS GOING OVER $29
There are your 13 million shares in a nutshell!FORWARD!!! MARCH!!!
Ride the wave.. will be 30 again soon!
"Huge volume at the close (450,000) at $24.52 +,-. Hopefully putting in a fairly solid support level."
Pool crushed earnings... that's why it's running. Short covering could fuel this higher over the next several days
"loaded up... thanks ""over reactive market!"""
I’m looking at opening a position do you think now is a good time to do that?
"Any insight on whether shorts are responsible for LESL's declining stock price? FINRA reports short interest of 14.7% or +15 days to cover, both of which seem high. If so, a strong Q4 ER would 'squeeze' shorts into covering and cause a strong rally."
Can anybody guess what the offering price would be?￼
Bontino Dontino Contino says BUY!
As soon as options expire tomorrow this is over 25
"LESL just did a secondary in June around $27, now another 4-5 months later!?!?! I can only hope they're using the funds to clean up the $1.1B+ of long term debt sitting on their balance sheet. Regardless, I see sub-$20 for LESL as likely in the coming days or possibly weeks."
looks like josh brown bailed on all the LESL holders. Recommended it at 28 and quietly bailed with stock now at $20. Thanks Josh.
"You guys need to understand that no new shares are being issued. These are shares that are owned by an investment company. Josh, I love him, should did say making room for sales. He should have been more clear, and do not sell. This is a buy."
That recovery ended quickly
Any idea how many more days till offering is finished?? 3-4 ??
Sweet…. In the green nicely now on my calls after being in the red…Stochastics predict that this party isn’t over yet! Anyone think this bad boy will be over$30. In two weeks?
Josh selling at a loss is no different than any of us taking a hit and moving on. Everyone seems to have a hair trigger to sell. It creates opportunities. This stock should be 25-30 bucks. Such heavy institutional ownership just means that they will pump it up again soon enough.
anyone see josh brown in here? he pumped me into lesl and ghvi and bailed on both.
blackrock and vanguard own it too.
"I finally got rid of my 10,100 shares at $20.68 and I will never? invest in this #$%$ company.I finally broke even. There is a real resistance at $20.72??"
the third or fourth secondary
"The way this deal looks, it's not a dilution... why the huge drop? Just moving shares out of lock up, right?"
Every time this stock gets back to 25 the shorties come out and drive it back down. Easy to manipulate on such low volume.
So Josh Brown pumps this at $29 and again at $25 all the while short interest grows to 20% Now hovering at $20. Seems like a good team they make in the classic pump and dump world.
For some reason I have this in my watch list and noticed it hasn't had much price movement and seemed to have decent earnings but then saw it has a P/E of about 33. This is an expensive market but perhaps this is holding it back?
"I'm ready for this thing to run - There are some additional stock restrictions that are ending their lockup period in Nov. So the road could be bumpy. I believe it will hit 26, then may pull back again."
Favorable report by Stifel on 9/9 recognized LESL as undervalued with a Buy rating and $28 PT - should continue to propel stock price and force shorts to cover!
"Holder Shares Date Reported % Out ValueCatterton Management Company, L.L.C. 42,679,554 Jun 29, 2021 22.54% 1,173,260,939"
Insiders selling this at $21 shows no confidence in future prospects.
"What an overreaction, typical. Time to add."
i'm with Josh on this one. You don't do TWO offerings just to cash out owners with 0 dollars going to the corporation. Classic case of self serving by the owners squeezing the little shareholders such as myself! BAD DECISION.
"Such low volume, hugely buy patterns every 5 minutes. These calls are about to print!!"
"Nice to see LESL close in the green - hopefully, SP will soon overtake the $25.73 high of Sep 10!"
"CNBC Josh Brown just announced that he sold LESL at a 20% loss and the price immediately dropped by 50 cents. I share Josh's disappointment about the 2 secondary stock offerings, but still believe in this company's futue outlook."
"If you've been contemplating LESL, now is the time to get in! Sales & earnings are at their seasonal peak during fiscal Q3 & Q4 and my analysis shows that Q4 will significantly beat the company's updated guidance from Aug. Price target between $26-$28 is likely by yearend."
Leslie's is up 4.91% to 21.37
