"This board is so quiet, considering LESL is trading at avg volume 1M per day."
"Let me share a little bit what is happening in the pool industry. Estimated 400,000 pools in the DFW area were effected by rolling blackouts because of the freeze. This does not even take into account other major areas like Waco, Austin, San Antonio and Houston. There are no pumps, filters and heaters available for immediate purchase in any...ANY of the distributors in Texas including POOL. Anything that Leslie's gets from manufacturing will be sold this year. Now the chlorine shortage. It's real. Biolab is quietly saying no trichlor tablets will be available in 35 days. That does not effect Leslie's. They own one of the two remaining US plants still producing trichlor. Biolab's plant (produced 60% of US trichlor) burned in the Laura Hurricane that went through Lake Charles last fall. It won't be operational for two years. POOL has a fantastic track record and will continue to out preform for the next year and half. Short term Leslie's is positioned by circumstance to go crazy for the next two quarters. This does not even touch on their internet presents with unprecedented back orders. They own several sites under different names. Meanwhile the rest of the country is exploding on new construction, remodels and repairs. Oh by the way as an industry we build nation wide 65,000 pools last year. Now think about the scale of product needed to fix Texas. Who has the most pool retail stores and will have chlorine this year? LESLIE'S"
The same happened to ARRY last month. The holders sold at mid $30.00 and the pps now is $15xxThere is a reason why large holders sell............ they just don't tell you what it is.
Buy when you can! I'm adding. Good luck...29.45
We’re the big guys expecting a higher earning that’s why they are selling?
Is Josh Brown floating on his pool again today? Isn't it time for him to mention this stock on CNBC and manipulate it higher?
Josh Brown is giggling
"If you've been contemplating LESL, now is the time to get in! Sales & earnings are at their seasonal peak during fiscal Q3 & Q4 and my analysis shows that Q4 will significantly beat the company's updated guidance from Aug. Price target between $26-$28 is likely by yearend."
Josh selling at a loss is no different than any of us taking a hit and moving on. Everyone seems to have a hair trigger to sell. It creates opportunities. This stock should be 25-30 bucks. Such heavy institutional ownership just means that they will pump it up again soon enough.
LESL is up 7.55% to 22.51
goldman writing up on the chlorine shortage
Playing LESL and ANGI... the TX disaster puts these companies in play.
Any idea how many more days till offering is finished?? 3-4 ??
Leslies to the MOON!!!!!20% Short Interest and Third Point Hedge Fund Owning on top of a solid balance sheet. Overall solid company...
When is LESL next earnings reporting date....Anyone?
Sweet…. In the green nicely now on my calls after being in the red…Stochastics predict that this party isn’t over yet! Anyone think this bad boy will be over$30. In two weeks?
It is called lock up... once a stock ipos 6 months after they are able to sell shares after ownership for year... this happens with every stock and LESL insider selling is a lot than I have seen from most companies... looks great :)
Pumps and filters are limited as there is a buying frenzy... service on your pool is 2+ weeks booked out... they have never seen demand like this ever... going to be a phenomenal few quarters :)
Can anybody tell me when the next earnings report is
For some reason I have this in my watch list and noticed it hasn't had much price movement and seemed to have decent earnings but then saw it has a P/E of about 33. This is an expensive market but perhaps this is holding it back?
Big boom for LESL... every pool in Texas needs repairs... pumps... filters... pipes... actual pool damage... call Leslie’s in Texas they have so many stores and they will tell you business is BOOMING... and this is supposed. To be winter ;) slowest time... exact opposite this beats summer
LESL is up 7.04% to 22.36
"Josh Brown doesn't say a word on CNBC this afternoon! Although, he still showed he was holding the position. If ever we needed a kind word it was today!"
I’m looking at opening a position do you think now is a good time to do that?
"Killer earnings report.And more importantly, revised future guidance. Need more press releases and ratings upgrades."
LESL is down 7.12% to 22.29
so Josh Brown pumps this thing regularly on CNBC and he sells into the pump. how is that not illegal?
Bontino Dontino Contino says BUY!
"Just started following this company and like the business. For retail, there is the unique component that your pool water is brought to the store for an analysis... very valuable to have loyal customers getting something as well as chemical products..in the meantime ... browse nice products! Wish I had bought more in yesterday's sell off!"
Leslie's is down 5.63% to 22.78
"Nice to see LESL close in the green - hopefully, SP will soon overtake the $25.73 high of Sep 10!"
It’s already traded over it’s 10 day average volume in the first half hour.I believe it’ll begin to ratchet higher.As it obviously should.
"This stock seems like settling down around 20-21 range lately, probably not much movement until the ER."
"Josh pushed me out of the way at the exit door ah last I did get $29.3 though. On the flip side the er seemed good, I jumped back in at $27"
Nice beat on earnings.
Another Scott Brown genius stock pick.
"Tried to get some IPO shares through E*TRADE, priced at $17. However no allocation for me. This should perform well"
What is wrong with this market lol. Josh Brown says Leslie's and it goes up 3%. You people need jobs
Down over 7% after great earnings and guidance. This market is crazy...
What is it with the junk stock??!?!?!
"LESL just did a secondary in June around $27, now another 4-5 months later!?!?! I can only hope they're using the funds to clean up the $1.1B+ of long term debt sitting on their balance sheet. Regardless, I see sub-$20 for LESL as likely in the coming days or possibly weeks."
"Two analyst upgrades today. Move stock, move!Merrill Lynch upgraded LESLIES ORD SHS from NEUTRAL to BUY.BofA Securities Upgrades Leslie's to Buy From Neutral; Price Target is $36"
Insiders selling this at $21 shows no confidence in future prospects.
"CNBC Josh Brown just announced that he sold LESL at a 20% loss and the price immediately dropped by 50 cents. I share Josh's disappointment about the 2 secondary stock offerings, but still believe in this company's futue outlook."
you guys are not thinking big picture here... they have 50+ stores in Texas every single pool owner will be hiring these guys... for new pumps.... pipes... and repairs.... they are going to be bringing in service people from all over the country to fulfill demand... this seems like the biggest play on the snow storm damage...
33% of the float is sold short. What a squeeze it would be if the price starts moving up. Downside at this point is limited to 19 or 20. A good earnings number could drive this price to 30+ in a heartbeat!!
Buy pool ...
Felt like the tail wind is coming. This value stock is heading to $27 then $32
LESL crashing. When will SEC investigate Josh Brown and his pumping?
"Josh Brown, where are you? Should I back up the bus?"
"I'm ready for this thing to run - There are some additional stock restrictions that are ending their lockup period in Nov. So the road could be bumpy. I believe it will hit 26, then may pull back again."
LESL reached an all time low at 19.79
Ride the wave.. will be 30 again soon!
blackrock and vanguard own it too.
"Any insight on whether shorts are responsible for LESL's declining stock price? FINRA reports short interest of 14.7% or +15 days to cover, both of which seem high. If so, a strong Q4 ER would 'squeeze' shorts into covering and cause a strong rally."
Leslie's is up 5.49% to 24.79
That recovery ended quickly
What is it going to open at
To hell with Josh Brown.There’s one upgrade by B of A.New price target $36….Another few would be good at this point.
When is earnings?
this is going to plummet
i'm with Josh on this one. You don't do TWO offerings just to cash out owners with 0 dollars going to the corporation. Classic case of self serving by the owners squeezing the little shareholders such as myself! BAD DECISION.
LESL is down 6.37% to 28.06
No interest whatsoever
"The earnings report made no mention of same store sales growth that I saw. Remember it's pretty easy to beat last years quarterly numbers when you've increased the total number of stores. Even if sales were muted, I'm guessing it had a lot to do with the Chlorine shortage."
LESL is up 7.36% to 27.57
"Looking at their past performance, this company is seasonal which their sales are especially good in summer and fall, and it makes sense their pool business relating to warm weather. The next few weeks are great time to jump in and hold before spring and summer coming soon."
I have been Josh burned
Someone called into Cramer last night about Leslie. But I couldn’t understand what he said. Did anyone catch it?
LESL is up 9.62% to 24.50
LESL is down 4.95% to 23.63
This looked like an ok company until I saw the leverage and credit ratings. Credit rating is junk and leverage is over 5. I already own POOL and will continue to add to that and pass up on this one. POOL is the better company. I realize the chlorine shortage may be a boon for both companies' stock prices but POOL is financially much healthier than LESL.
I am drowning in my own pool

Down 4%. Go Josh go.
https://discord.gg/pvECT44bGU
LESL reached an all time high at 29.25
Leslie's is down 6.35% to 28.11
Selling $25 CSP's for July...this is a good stock RMR will be great over next 12-18 months...
It’s bigger than Texas. 900+ stores nationwide. Chlorine prices and shortages nationally. GM will be crazy this year. They also manufacture their own tabs.
So Josh Brown pumps this at $29 and again at $25 all the while short interest grows to 20% Now hovering at $20. Seems like a good team they make in the classic pump and dump world.
Favorable report by Stifel on 9/9 recognized LESL as undervalued with a Buy rating and $28 PT - should continue to propel stock price and force shorts to cover!
"I hate it when this kinda #$%$ happens and not all the cards are on the table, i.e. what the secondary offering price is going to be. I just went ahead and sold all of mine this morning for a very small profit and I'll look to buy it again at what I hope is a cheaper price."
"You guys need to understand that no new shares are being issued. These are shares that are owned by an investment company. Josh, I love him, should did say making room for sales. He should have been more clear, and do not sell. This is a buy."
LESL is up 7.83% to 24.80
whats ur opinion on competitor such as $hayw and $lesl
https://discord.gg/sspy6sHa
100% correct here. Also chlorine and AG pools shortages This industry is in huge demand with shortages and Leslie’s is the worlds largest pool supply company. Owns most on line sites
So big boys got the pricing leak around 1pm where as retail investors had to wait until after hours to see it was set at $27.64. Pretty obvious looking at the chart when the leak hit. Just have to laugh some times.
LESL reached an all time high at 28.49
can it close north of 25.65 today?
LESL is up 7.18% to 23.14
"What an overreaction, typical. Time to add."
Gonna be a good day tomorrow
why the heavy insider selling
HAYWORD WENT PUBLIC AS WELL! THEY USE SALT WATER TO SANITIZE WHILE MOST OTHER COMPANY USE CHEMICAL SUCH AS CHLORINE!
Moving higher today on low volume… very good sign.
biggest joke stock ever
Josh Brown needs SEC handcuffs for his obvious front running on CNBC
"I finally got rid of my 10,100 shares at $20.68 and I will never? invest in this #$%$ company.I finally broke even. There is a real resistance at $20.72??"
LESL has 65 stores just in the Dallas area :) do a store locator on the company website :)
If the stock is undervalued why would they do a secondary offering? Is stifel the underwriter?
i like redditt target... as they move out of AMC
Can anybody guess what the offering price would be?￼
Bank of America upgrade to Buy with a $36 PT.
2/19...Jefferies analyst Jonathan Matuszewski raised the price target on Leslie's (NASDAQ: LESL) to $40.00 (from $37.00)
Huge Short Interest in LESL. Over 27% short. Covering rally???? Or maybe redit target????
I think the shorts are out. Suspect we are headed back to $20.43. Like it long-term but the chart is not my friend. Buy 7/16 puts to offset some of the pain from a long position.
Time to add!
Here’s the thing….This stock isn’t far off of its IPO price last fall…After excellent proven performance and raised forward guidance…The markets are FUBAR lately.This would be a good REDDIT WALLSTREET BETS candidate with 15% short interest…
LESL is down 6.96% to 25.81
LESL reached an all time low at 20.19
LESL is down 6.92% to 29.17

1-3 month stochastics are predicting upward momentum.Write that down and get back with me in 2 weeks!
Leslie's is up 5.72% to 24.01
"back under 26, should be under 20 soon"
What a pile of #$%$ Beat and raise guidance and its down 12%
LESL is up 8.43% to 28.03
"Josh pumping Leslie on Halftime Report. Here are some of the highlights:1) almost no ones knows about this stock2) ultimately this company will turn into an incredible cash flow generation annuity stream3) record # of pools built in 2020, another record will occur in 20214) once you build a pool, you need to maintain it - chemicals, parts, toys5) LESL is a long term hold6) growth is explosive. Backlog of pool building is at record level. Part of the suburbanization of America.7) secular bull market for pools, hot tubs, etc.8) Leslie has the biggest presense in this market9) When Josh first started talking about it on today's show, the stock price was $27.64"
LESL is up 7.77% to 25.38
Leslie's is down 6.31% to 29.28
limit on chlorine @ pool store
This is way outside it’s southern Bolinger bands. Way oversold.
LESL is up 7.51% to 30.08
POOL should give us a preview of Leslie's Inc on July 22nd.
Might pre-announce a big beat??? That would drive the price higher with 27% of the float short.
LESL #1 play for the winter storm :) so many people need new pumps and filters and pool repairs going to provide us with great quarters to come :)
As soon as options expire tomorrow this is over 25
LESL reached an all time high at 25.24
Need some volume to get this moving.
"Damn straight, this stock is down 5 points for no good reason. It is not like there isn't a shortage of pool supplies and chemicals that is going to continue for a while."
Quit selling off!
I read that pool businesses got huge profit because of COVID...This stock is announcing its revenue in 2/21...which should be higher than previous... isn’t this good enough for this stock to rise?
This thing is gonna trade at least 5 times average 10 day volume by 4pm.Solid downside support level.I see it moving up next week.We’ll see.
There are your 13 million shares in a nutshell!FORWARD!!! MARCH!!!
LESL got an honorable message on CNBC....
looks like another josh brown pump and dump. see GHVI. he pumped it at 24 as one of the most amazing technologies he has ever seen. then exited it and its now 13. be careful. no im not short
"loaded up... thanks ""over reactive market!"""
Still averaging down George? That's such a winning strategy.
Leslie's is up 6.35% to 27.14
When will the SEC finally do its job and arrest Josh Brown? Its not like he's hiding. Just compare his trading record to his stumping for this turd. Not hard.
Anyone think this will drop in the next few days?
Leslie's is up 5.64% to 22.82
Josh is laughing at you chumps
Try before you buy.
LESL reached an all time high at 23.90
"Huge volume at the close (450,000) at $24.52 +,-. Hopefully putting in a fairly solid support level."
LESL is up 9.16% to 23.35
Looks like it’s forming a base here before er
now its collapsing .... Josh and his boys are out
"Looks like it had been bought on the rumor, and now selling on the news!!"
"Holder Shares Date Reported % Out ValueCatterton Management Company, L.L.C. 42,679,554 Jun 29, 2021 22.54% 1,173,260,939"
"I tried to buy a spa and get it installed in our vacation home in Utah, it's taking 3 months to get it. Major backlog."
LESL is down 6.88% to 24.75
"I work in the swim pool industry and have for the past 28 years. The past 2 years, I have never seen anything like it. It is definitely a BOOM in the building of swim pools. The pool builder I do the most of my work for. He is so backed up. If you sign contract for him to build pool, he can't come dig the hole till summer of 2023. This BOOM isn't ending anytime soon. I've always said that the pool business is recession proof. Only people who have money have swim pools. And believe me, they want their swim pool right no matter the cost."
It’s still not moving up as it should on 2 upgrades…2 weeks.We’ll see.
LESL is down 8.68% to 20.09
"Such low volume, hugely buy patterns every 5 minutes. These calls are about to print!!"
How does Leslie's compare to Pool Corporation in terms of services and reputation?
Its almost as if Josh Brown is front running this pig by using his platform on CNBC to bull it. SEC???
"The way this deal looks, it's not a dilution... why the huge drop? Just moving shares out of lock up, right?"
LESL reached an all time high at 22.47
This is not dilutive. Nothing has changed. Underwriters making money off IPO price
"Just saw this from Benzinga: ""BlackRock (NYSE: BLK) plans on becoming a new investor in Leslie’s committing to buy $100 million in shares at the offering price."" That does say ""plans on"", wonder if they did?"
Very nice cup and handle pattern here. Probably take some shares tomorrow if there is some follow through.
Took advantage of today’s low and cost averaged down.
Why would everyone buy LESL and not the company that makes the pumps like PNR?
Many hedge funds own this stock.Biggest problem is liquidity.
https://discord.gg/zCHTHNy
Insiders are dumping like the ship is going down. Whats up with this
LESL is down 6.89% to 24.60
Another indirectly related new business that should have some positive impact on Leslie’s is “Swimply” the new pool rental gig.
guys move to Hayward holdings $hayw
LESL reached an all time high at 26.20
LESL is up 7.50% to 24.78
After what I just heard on CNBC I have decided that Josh Brown is a shape shifter. Somehow bragging that he knew what was going to happen. Nope.
Isn't it illegal to front run anymore?
LESL is down 6.78% to 21.18

looks like josh brown bailed on all the LESL holders. Recommended it at 28 and quietly bailed with stock now at $20. Thanks Josh.
Stock is down on a great earnings. What a shame
Josh Brown just spoke recommended. Stock jumped! He is still holding position.
What is with the insanely high short interest in LESL?
"All the Leslie's insiders sold most of their shares on the first day they legally could, the 16th, to the tune of maybe $75,000,000. No faith in there own company."
the third or fourth secondary
LESL reached an all time high at 31.69
Looking strong pre-market.$26-$27 today.
Every time this stock gets back to 25 the shorties come out and drive it back down. Easy to manipulate on such low volume.
LESL is up 8.08% to 30.57
Hot home sales = increased LESL share price
