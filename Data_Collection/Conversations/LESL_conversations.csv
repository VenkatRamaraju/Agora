LESL is down 6.88% to 24.75
Josh Brown just spoke recommended. Stock jumped! He is still holding position.
When will the SEC finally do its job and arrest Josh Brown? Its not like he's hiding. Just compare his trading record to his stumping for this turd. Not hard.
Try before you buy.
LESL is down 6.92% to 29.17
LESL is up 7.04% to 22.36
"What an overreaction, typical. Time to add."
LESL #1 play for the winter storm :) so many people need new pumps and filters and pool repairs going to provide us with great quarters to come :)
Stock is down on a great earnings. What a shame
"Just saw this from Benzinga: ""BlackRock (NYSE: BLK) plans on becoming a new investor in Leslie’s committing to buy $100 million in shares at the offering price."" That does say ""plans on"", wonder if they did?"
guys move to Hayward holdings $hayw
Is Josh Brown floating on his pool again today? Isn't it time for him to mention this stock on CNBC and manipulate it higher?
goldman writing up on the chlorine shortage
Can anybody guess what the offering price would be?￼
We’re the big guys expecting a higher earning that’s why they are selling?
"Josh pumping Leslie on Halftime Report. Here are some of the highlights:1) almost no ones knows about this stock2) ultimately this company will turn into an incredible cash flow generation annuity stream3) record # of pools built in 2020, another record will occur in 20214) once you build a pool, you need to maintain it - chemicals, parts, toys5) LESL is a long term hold6) growth is explosive. Backlog of pool building is at record level. Part of the suburbanization of America.7) secular bull market for pools, hot tubs, etc.8) Leslie has the biggest presense in this market9) When Josh first started talking about it on today's show, the stock price was $27.64"
I think the shorts are out. Suspect we are headed back to $20.43. Like it long-term but the chart is not my friend. Buy 7/16 puts to offset some of the pain from a long position.
you guys are not thinking big picture here... they have 50+ stores in Texas every single pool owner will be hiring these guys... for new pumps.... pipes... and repairs.... they are going to be bringing in service people from all over the country to fulfill demand... this seems like the biggest play on the snow storm damage...
Why would everyone buy LESL and not the company that makes the pumps like PNR?
Leslie's is up 6.35% to 27.14
This is way outside it’s southern Bolinger bands. Way oversold.
Leslie's is up 5.49% to 24.79
LESL is down 7.12% to 22.29
It’s still not moving up as it should on 2 upgrades…2 weeks.We’ll see.
I am drowning in my own pool
https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/lesl/insider-activity
"Just started following this company and like the business. For retail, there is the unique component that your pool water is brought to the store for an analysis... very valuable to have loyal customers getting something as well as chemical products..in the meantime ... browse nice products! Wish I had bought more in yesterday's sell off!"
Sweet…. In the green nicely now on my calls after being in the red…Stochastics predict that this party isn’t over yet! Anyone think this bad boy will be over$30. In two weeks?
Selling $25 CSP's for July...this is a good stock RMR will be great over next 12-18 months...
Big boom for LESL... every pool in Texas needs repairs... pumps... filters... pipes... actual pool damage... call Leslie’s in Texas they have so many stores and they will tell you business is BOOMING... and this is supposed. To be winter ;) slowest time... exact opposite this beats summer
Any idea how many more days till offering is finished?? 3-4 ??
Need some volume to get this moving.
What is with the insanely high short interest in LESL?
LESL reached an all time high at 29.25
Leslie's is down 6.31% to 29.28
Quit selling off!
What is it with the junk stock??!?!?!
LESL is up 7.18% to 23.14
Absolute disaster
"Tried to get some IPO shares through E*TRADE, priced at $17. However no allocation for me. This should perform well"
"Such low volume, hugely buy patterns every 5 minutes. These calls are about to print!!"
Leslie's is down 5.63% to 22.78
i like redditt target... as they move out of AMC
LESL crashing. When will SEC investigate Josh Brown and his pumping?
LESL is up 7.51% to 30.08
When is earnings?
LESL is up 9.62% to 24.50
"This stock seems like settling down around 20-21 range lately, probably not much movement until the ER."
LESL is down 6.96% to 25.81
Its almost as if Josh Brown is front running this pig by using his platform on CNBC to bull it. SEC???
LESL is down 6.37% to 28.06
Ride the wave.. will be 30 again soon!
Another indirectly related new business that should have some positive impact on Leslie’s is “Swimply” the new pool rental gig.
"Damn straight, this stock is down 5 points for no good reason. It is not like there isn't a shortage of pool supplies and chemicals that is going to continue for a while."
That recovery ended quickly
Very nice cup and handle pattern here. Probably take some shares tomorrow if there is some follow through.
Nice beat on earnings.
Someone called into Cramer last night about Leslie. But I couldn’t understand what he said. Did anyone catch it?
why the heavy insider selling
HAYWORD WENT PUBLIC AS WELL! THEY USE SALT WATER TO SANITIZE WHILE MOST OTHER COMPANY USE CHEMICAL SUCH AS CHLORINE!
After what I just heard on CNBC I have decided that Josh Brown is a shape shifter. Somehow bragging that he knew what was going to happen. Nope.
limit on chlorine @ pool store
1-3 month stochastics are predicting upward momentum.Write that down and get back with me in 2 weeks!
What is wrong with this market lol. Josh Brown says Leslie's and it goes up 3%. You people need jobs
This is not dilutive. Nothing has changed. Underwriters making money off IPO price
Buy when you can! I'm adding. Good luck...29.45
Huge Short Interest in LESL. Over 27% short. Covering rally???? Or maybe redit target????
The same happened to ARRY last month. The holders sold at mid $30.00 and the pps now is $15xxThere is a reason why large holders sell............ they just don't tell you what it is.
LESL reached an all time high at 26.20
"I hate it when this kinda #$%$ happens and not all the cards are on the table, i.e. what the secondary offering price is going to be. I just went ahead and sold all of mine this morning for a very small profit and I'll look to buy it again at what I hope is a cheaper price."
"Josh Brown, where are you? Should I back up the bus?"
"This is weird, after announcing fantastic earning stock is not trading at all￼."
If the stock is undervalued why would they do a secondary offering? Is stifel the underwriter?
"I work in the swim pool industry and have for the past 28 years. The past 2 years, I have never seen anything like it. It is definitely a BOOM in the building of swim pools. The pool builder I do the most of my work for. He is so backed up. If you sign contract for him to build pool, he can't come dig the hole till summer of 2023. This BOOM isn't ending anytime soon. I've always said that the pool business is recession proof. Only people who have money have swim pools. And believe me, they want their swim pool right no matter the cost."
LESL reached an all time high at 30.17
Does anybody know what the offering price is per share?
OK I admit shorts are in total control￼
As soon as options expire tomorrow this is over 25
Here’s the thing….This stock isn’t far off of its IPO price last fall…After excellent proven performance and raised forward guidance…The markets are FUBAR lately.This would be a good REDDIT WALLSTREET BETS candidate with 15% short interest…
To hell with Josh Brown.There’s one upgrade by B of A.New price target $36….Another few would be good at this point.
Felt like the tail wind is coming. This value stock is heading to $27 then $32
Looking strong pre-market.$26-$27 today.
LESL is up 7.50% to 24.78
Many hedge funds own this stock.Biggest problem is liquidity.
For some reason I have this in my watch list and noticed it hasn't had much price movement and seemed to have decent earnings but then saw it has a P/E of about 33. This is an expensive market but perhaps this is holding it back?
This thing is gonna trade at least 5 times average 10 day volume by 4pm.Solid downside support level.I see it moving up next week.We’ll see.
Down over 7% after great earnings and guidance. This market is crazy...
It’s already traded over it’s 10 day average volume in the first half hour.I believe it’ll begin to ratchet higher.As it obviously should.
Favorable report by Stifel on 9/9 recognized LESL as undervalued with a Buy rating and $28 PT - should continue to propel stock price and force shorts to cover!
this is going to plummet
LESL is up 7.77% to 25.38
blackrock and vanguard own it too.
There are your 13 million shares in a nutshell!FORWARD!!! MARCH!!!
No interest whatsoever
"Looking at their past performance, this company is seasonal which their sales are especially good in summer and fall, and it makes sense their pool business relating to warm weather. The next few weeks are great time to jump in and hold before spring and summer coming soon."
whats ur opinion on competitor such as $hayw and $lesl
"The way this deal looks, it's not a dilution... why the huge drop? Just moving shares out of lock up, right?"
https://discord.gg/pvECT44bGU
LESL got an honorable message on CNBC....
100% correct here. Also chlorine and AG pools shortages This industry is in huge demand with shortages and Leslie’s is the worlds largest pool supply company. Owns most on line sites
https://discord.gg/zCHTHNy
so Josh Brown pumps this thing regularly on CNBC and he sells into the pump. how is that not illegal?
Bank of America upgrade to Buy with a $36 PT.
biggest joke stock ever
LESL is down 6.89% to 24.60
So big boys got the pricing leak around 1pm where as retail investors had to wait until after hours to see it was set at $27.64. Pretty obvious looking at the chart when the leak hit. Just have to laugh some times.
Time to add!
Hot home sales = increased LESL share price
LESL is down 6.78% to 21.18
LESL reached an all time high at 22.47
POOL should give us a preview of Leslie's Inc on July 22nd.
LESL is up 8.08% to 30.57
It is called lock up... once a stock ipos 6 months after they are able to sell shares after ownership for year... this happens with every stock and LESL insider selling is a lot than I have seen from most companies... looks great :)
This looked like an ok company until I saw the leverage and credit ratings. Credit rating is junk and leverage is over 5. I already own POOL and will continue to add to that and pass up on this one. POOL is the better company. I realize the chlorine shortage may be a boon for both companies' stock prices but POOL is financially much healthier than LESL.
LESL reached an all time low at 19.79
LESL is up 7.36% to 27.57
"Let me share a little bit what is happening in the pool industry. Estimated 400,000 pools in the DFW area were effected by rolling blackouts because of the freeze. This does not even take into account other major areas like Waco, Austin, San Antonio and Houston. There are no pumps, filters and heaters available for immediate purchase in any...ANY of the distributors in Texas including POOL. Anything that Leslie's gets from manufacturing will be sold this year. Now the chlorine shortage. It's real. Biolab is quietly saying no trichlor tablets will be available in 35 days. That does not effect Leslie's. They own one of the two remaining US plants still producing trichlor. Biolab's plant (produced 60% of US trichlor) burned in the Laura Hurricane that went through Lake Charles last fall. It won't be operational for two years. POOL has a fantastic track record and will continue to out preform for the next year and half. Short term Leslie's is positioned by circumstance to go crazy for the next two quarters. This does not even touch on their internet presents with unprecedented back orders. They own several sites under different names. Meanwhile the rest of the country is exploding on new construction, remodels and repairs. Oh by the way as an industry we build nation wide 65,000 pools last year. Now think about the scale of product needed to fix Texas. Who has the most pool retail stores and will have chlorine this year? LESLIE'S"
"LESL just did a secondary in June around $27, now another 4-5 months later!?!?! I can only hope they're using the funds to clean up the $1.1B+ of long term debt sitting on their balance sheet. Regardless, I see sub-$20 for LESL as likely in the coming days or possibly weeks."
"Looks like it had been bought on the rumor, and now selling on the news!!"
LESL reached an all time high at 28.49
"Killer earnings report.And more importantly, revised future guidance. Need more press releases and ratings upgrades."
Leslies to the MOON!!!!!20% Short Interest and Third Point Hedge Fund Owning on top of a solid balance sheet. Overall solid company...
How does Leslie's compare to Pool Corporation in terms of services and reputation?
Took advantage of today’s low and cost averaged down.
Pumps and filters are limited as there is a buying frenzy... service on your pool is 2+ weeks booked out... they have never seen demand like this ever... going to be a phenomenal few quarters :)
Insiders are dumping like the ship is going down. Whats up with this
Bontino Dontino Contino says BUY!
now its collapsing .... Josh and his boys are out
When is LESL next earnings reporting date....Anyone?
Anyone think this will drop in the next few days?
LESL has 65 stores just in the Dallas area :) do a store locator on the company website :)
"Two analyst upgrades today. Move stock, move!Merrill Lynch upgraded LESLIES ORD SHS from NEUTRAL to BUY.BofA Securities Upgrades Leslie's to Buy From Neutral; Price Target is $36"
I read that pool businesses got huge profit because of COVID...This stock is announcing its revenue in 2/21...which should be higher than previous... isn’t this good enough for this stock to rise?
LESL is up 7.83% to 24.80
Every time this stock gets back to 25 the shorties come out and drive it back down. Easy to manipulate on such low volume.
LESL reached an all time high at 25.24
Still averaging down George? That's such a winning strategy.
Another Scott Brown genius stock pick.
"The earnings report made no mention of same store sales growth that I saw. Remember it's pretty easy to beat last years quarterly numbers when you've increased the total number of stores. Even if sales were muted, I'm guessing it had a lot to do with the Chlorine shortage."
Can anybody tell me when the next earnings report is
What is it going to open at
$LESL Target Raised by Robert W Baird Outperform USD 33 » USD 35 Target Raised by Loop Capital Neutral » Hold USD 28 » USD 31 Target Raised by Telsey Advisory Group Outperform USD 35 » USD 38 Reiterated by Piper Sandler Overweight USD 33 » USD 38
Buy pool ...
Josh Brown needs SEC handcuffs for his obvious front running on CNBC
Leslie's is up 5.72% to 24.01
33% of the float is sold short. What a squeeze it would be if the price starts moving up. Downside at this point is limited to 19 or 20. A good earnings number could drive this price to 30+ in a heartbeat!!
Leslie's is up 5.64% to 22.82
LESL is up 7.55% to 22.51
Josh is laughing at you chumps
"Josh pushed me out of the way at the exit door ah last I did get $29.3 though. On the flip side the er seemed good, I jumped back in at $27"
https://discord.gg/sspy6sHa
"This board is so quiet, considering LESL is trading at avg volume 1M per day."
Gonna be a good day tomorrow
Moving higher today on low volume… very good sign.
2/19...Jefferies analyst Jonathan Matuszewski raised the price target on Leslie's (NASDAQ: LESL) to $40.00 (from $37.00)
What a crapola
Who is running this company? The worst management ever. ￼￼The worst stock in my portfolio￼ ever.
"All the Leslie's insiders sold most of their shares on the first day they legally could, the 16th, to the tune of maybe $75,000,000. No faith in there own company."
Josh Brown is giggling
LESL reached an all time high at 31.69
"back under 26, should be under 20 soon"
Might pre-announce a big beat??? That would drive the price higher with 27% of the float short.
can it close north of 25.65 today?
It’s bigger than Texas. 900+ stores nationwide. Chlorine prices and shortages nationally. GM will be crazy this year. They also manufacture their own tabs.
"Josh Brown doesn't say a word on CNBC this afternoon! Although, he still showed he was holding the position. If ever we needed a kind word it was today!"
