the third or fourth secondary
"This board is so quiet, considering LESL is trading at avg volume 1M per day."
Here’s the thing….This stock isn’t far off of its IPO price last fall…After excellent proven performance and raised forward guidance…The markets are FUBAR lately.This would be a good REDDIT WALLSTREET BETS candidate with 15% short interest…
Nice beat on earnings.
It’s already traded over it’s 10 day average volume in the first half hour.I believe it’ll begin to ratchet higher.As it obviously should.
LESL is up 7.51% to 30.08
HAYWORD WENT PUBLIC AS WELL! THEY USE SALT WATER TO SANITIZE WHILE MOST OTHER COMPANY USE CHEMICAL SUCH AS CHLORINE!
can it close north of 25.65 today?
Still averaging down George? That's such a winning strategy.
now its collapsing .... Josh and his boys are out
Josh Brown is giggling
blackrock and vanguard own it too.
Down over 7% after great earnings and guidance. This market is crazy...
Isn't it illegal to front run anymore?
LESL is up 9.62% to 24.50
this is going to plummet
whats ur opinion on competitor such as $hayw and $lesl
How does Leslie's compare to Pool Corporation in terms of services and reputation?
"All the Leslie's insiders sold most of their shares on the first day they legally could, the 16th, to the tune of maybe $75,000,000. No faith in there own company."
Bontino Dontino Contino says BUY!
Leslie's is up 4.91% to 21.37
Looking strong pre-market.$26-$27 today.
Insiders are dumping like the ship is going down. Whats up with this
Buy pool ...
LESL is down 6.92% to 29.17
It’s still not moving up as it should on 2 upgrades…2 weeks.We’ll see.
What is it with the junk stock??!?!?!
33% of the float is sold short. What a squeeze it would be if the price starts moving up. Downside at this point is limited to 19 or 20. A good earnings number could drive this price to 30+ in a heartbeat!!
Leslie's is down 6.31% to 29.28
Favorable report by Stifel on 9/9 recognized LESL as undervalued with a Buy rating and $28 PT - should continue to propel stock price and force shorts to cover!
Felt like the tail wind is coming. This value stock is heading to $27 then $32
Looks like it’s forming a base here before er
Time to add!
Hot home sales = increased LESL share price
LESL is down 8.68% to 20.09
Bank of America upgrade to Buy with a $36 PT.
"This stock seems like settling down around 20-21 range lately, probably not much movement until the ER."
i'm with Josh on this one. You don't do TWO offerings just to cash out owners with 0 dollars going to the corporation. Classic case of self serving by the owners squeezing the little shareholders such as myself! BAD DECISION.
"Looking at their past performance, this company is seasonal which their sales are especially good in summer and fall, and it makes sense their pool business relating to warm weather. The next few weeks are great time to jump in and hold before spring and summer coming soon."
goldman writing up on the chlorine shortage
Leslie's is down 5.63% to 22.78
Buy when you can! I'm adding. Good luck...29.45
"LESL just did a secondary in June around $27, now another 4-5 months later!?!?! I can only hope they're using the funds to clean up the $1.1B+ of long term debt sitting on their balance sheet. Regardless, I see sub-$20 for LESL as likely in the coming days or possibly weeks."
https://discord.gg/zCHTHNy
anyone see josh brown in here? he pumped me into lesl and ghvi and bailed on both.
No interest whatsoever
LESL is down 6.89% to 24.60
https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/lesl/insider-activity
"CNBC Josh Brown just announced that he sold LESL at a 20% loss and the price immediately dropped by 50 cents. I share Josh's disappointment about the 2 secondary stock offerings, but still believe in this company's futue outlook."
"I finally got rid of my 10,100 shares at $20.68 and I will never? invest in this #$%$ company.I finally broke even. There is a real resistance at $20.72??"
So Josh Brown pumps this at $29 and again at $25 all the while short interest grows to 20% Now hovering at $20. Seems like a good team they make in the classic pump and dump world.
POOL should give us a preview of Leslie's Inc on July 22nd.
guys move to Hayward holdings $hayw
LESL is down 6.88% to 24.75
Might pre-announce a big beat??? That would drive the price higher with 27% of the float short.
"Killer earnings report.And more importantly, revised future guidance. Need more press releases and ratings upgrades."
Took advantage of today’s low and cost averaged down.
Very nice cup and handle pattern here. Probably take some shares tomorrow if there is some follow through.
LESL reached an all time high at 26.20
Every time this stock gets back to 25 the shorties come out and drive it back down. Easy to manipulate on such low volume.
Huge Short Interest in LESL. Over 27% short. Covering rally???? Or maybe redit target????
Josh Brown just spoke recommended. Stock jumped! He is still holding position.
LESL is down 6.37% to 28.06
"Any insight on whether shorts are responsible for LESL's declining stock price? FINRA reports short interest of 14.7% or +15 days to cover, both of which seem high. If so, a strong Q4 ER would 'squeeze' shorts into covering and cause a strong rally."
"Holder Shares Date Reported % Out ValueCatterton Management Company, L.L.C. 42,679,554 Jun 29, 2021 22.54% 1,173,260,939"
That recovery ended quickly
When is LESL next earnings reporting date....Anyone?
LESL is down 7.12% to 22.29
Stock is down on a great earnings. What a shame
"Just started following this company and like the business. For retail, there is the unique component that your pool water is brought to the store for an analysis... very valuable to have loyal customers getting something as well as chemical products..in the meantime ... browse nice products! Wish I had bought more in yesterday's sell off!"
I think the shorts are out. Suspect we are headed back to $20.43. Like it long-term but the chart is not my friend. Buy 7/16 puts to offset some of the pain from a long position.
What is with the insanely high short interest in LESL?
So big boys got the pricing leak around 1pm where as retail investors had to wait until after hours to see it was set at $27.64. Pretty obvious looking at the chart when the leak hit. Just have to laugh some times.
Down 4%. Go Josh go.
you guys are not thinking big picture here... they have 50+ stores in Texas every single pool owner will be hiring these guys... for new pumps.... pipes... and repairs.... they are going to be bringing in service people from all over the country to fulfill demand... this seems like the biggest play on the snow storm damage...
"Just saw this from Benzinga: ""BlackRock (NYSE: BLK) plans on becoming a new investor in Leslie’s committing to buy $100 million in shares at the offering price."" That does say ""plans on"", wonder if they did?"
LESL is up 7.04% to 22.36
For some reason I have this in my watch list and noticed it hasn't had much price movement and seemed to have decent earnings but then saw it has a P/E of about 33. This is an expensive market but perhaps this is holding it back?
"Nice to see LESL close in the green - hopefully, SP will soon overtake the $25.73 high of Sep 10!"
https://discord.gg/pvECT44bGU
"I'm ready for this thing to run - There are some additional stock restrictions that are ending their lockup period in Nov. So the road could be bumpy. I believe it will hit 26, then may pull back again."
Anyone think this will drop in the next few days?
looks like josh brown bailed on all the LESL holders. Recommended it at 28 and quietly bailed with stock now at $20. Thanks Josh.
Josh Brown needs SEC handcuffs for his obvious front running on CNBC
"I tried to buy a spa and get it installed in our vacation home in Utah, it's taking 3 months to get it. Major backlog."
Any idea how many more days till offering is finished?? 3-4 ??
I read that pool businesses got huge profit because of COVID...This stock is announcing its revenue in 2/21...which should be higher than previous... isn’t this good enough for this stock to rise?
LESL crashing. When will SEC investigate Josh Brown and his pumping?
LESL got an honorable message on CNBC....
Pool crushed earnings... that's why it's running. Short covering could fuel this higher over the next several days
"The way this deal looks, it's not a dilution... why the huge drop? Just moving shares out of lock up, right?"
Big boom for LESL... every pool in Texas needs repairs... pumps... filters... pipes... actual pool damage... call Leslie’s in Texas they have so many stores and they will tell you business is BOOMING... and this is supposed. To be winter ;) slowest time... exact opposite this beats summer
Is Josh Brown floating on his pool again today? Isn't it time for him to mention this stock on CNBC and manipulate it higher?
LESL is down 6.96% to 25.81
"Two analyst upgrades today. Move stock, move!Merrill Lynch upgraded LESLIES ORD SHS from NEUTRAL to BUY.BofA Securities Upgrades Leslie's to Buy From Neutral; Price Target is $36"
so Josh Brown pumps this thing regularly on CNBC and he sells into the pump. how is that not illegal?
Moving higher today on low volume… very good sign.
LESL is up 7.83% to 24.80
"You guys need to understand that no new shares are being issued. These are shares that are owned by an investment company. Josh, I love him, should did say making room for sales. He should have been more clear, and do not sell. This is a buy."
"Josh Brown doesn't say a word on CNBC this afternoon! Although, he still showed he was holding the position. If ever we needed a kind word it was today!"
"If you've been contemplating LESL, now is the time to get in! Sales & earnings are at their seasonal peak during fiscal Q3 & Q4 and my analysis shows that Q4 will significantly beat the company's updated guidance from Aug. Price target between $26-$28 is likely by yearend."
Leslies to the MOON!!!!!20% Short Interest and Third Point Hedge Fund Owning on top of a solid balance sheet. Overall solid company...
LESL is up 9.16% to 23.35
When is earnings?
LESL is up 7.50% to 24.78
Sweet…. In the green nicely now on my calls after being in the red…Stochastics predict that this party isn’t over yet! Anyone think this bad boy will be over$30. In two weeks?
This is way outside it’s southern Bolinger bands. Way oversold.
Quit selling off!
LESL is up 8.43% to 28.03
LESL is up 7.36% to 27.57

"What an overreaction, typical. Time to add."
"Such low volume, hugely buy patterns every 5 minutes. These calls are about to print!!"
2/19...Jefferies analyst Jonathan Matuszewski raised the price target on Leslie's (NASDAQ: LESL) to $40.00 (from $37.00)
Many hedge funds own this stock.Biggest problem is liquidity.
Leslie's is down 6.35% to 28.11
Someone called into Cramer last night about Leslie. But I couldn’t understand what he said. Did anyone catch it?
Ride the wave.. will be 30 again soon!
This is not dilutive. Nothing has changed. Underwriters making money off IPO price
It’s bigger than Texas. 900+ stores nationwide. Chlorine prices and shortages nationally. GM will be crazy this year. They also manufacture their own tabs.
If the stock is undervalued why would they do a secondary offering? Is stifel the underwriter?
Can anybody guess what the offering price would be?￼
"Looks like it had been bought on the rumor, and now selling on the news!!"
LESL #1 play for the winter storm :) so many people need new pumps and filters and pool repairs going to provide us with great quarters to come :)
looks like another josh brown pump and dump. see GHVI. he pumped it at 24 as one of the most amazing technologies he has ever seen. then exited it and its now 13. be careful. no im not short
Pumps and filters are limited as there is a buying frenzy... service on your pool is 2+ weeks booked out... they have never seen demand like this ever... going to be a phenomenal few quarters :)
Insiders selling this at $21 shows no confidence in future prospects.
LESL is up 7.18% to 23.14
Leslie's is up 5.49% to 24.79
Why would everyone buy LESL and not the company that makes the pumps like PNR?
"Huge volume at the close (450,000) at $24.52 +,-. Hopefully putting in a fairly solid support level."
To hell with Josh Brown.There’s one upgrade by B of A.New price target $36….Another few would be good at this point.
We’re the big guys expecting a higher earning that’s why they are selling?
LESL reached an all time high at 30.17
Another Scott Brown genius stock pick.
LESL reached an all time high at 31.69
Josh selling at a loss is no different than any of us taking a hit and moving on. Everyone seems to have a hair trigger to sell. It creates opportunities. This stock should be 25-30 bucks. Such heavy institutional ownership just means that they will pump it up again soon enough.
"Let me share a little bit what is happening in the pool industry. Estimated 400,000 pools in the DFW area were effected by rolling blackouts because of the freeze. This does not even take into account other major areas like Waco, Austin, San Antonio and Houston. There are no pumps, filters and heaters available for immediate purchase in any...ANY of the distributors in Texas including POOL. Anything that Leslie's gets from manufacturing will be sold this year. Now the chlorine shortage. It's real. Biolab is quietly saying no trichlor tablets will be available in 35 days. That does not effect Leslie's. They own one of the two remaining US plants still producing trichlor. Biolab's plant (produced 60% of US trichlor) burned in the Laura Hurricane that went through Lake Charles last fall. It won't be operational for two years. POOL has a fantastic track record and will continue to out preform for the next year and half. Short term Leslie's is positioned by circumstance to go crazy for the next two quarters. This does not even touch on their internet presents with unprecedented back orders. They own several sites under different names. Meanwhile the rest of the country is exploding on new construction, remodels and repairs. Oh by the way as an industry we build nation wide 65,000 pools last year. Now think about the scale of product needed to fix Texas. Who has the most pool retail stores and will have chlorine this year? LESLIE'S"
"Josh Brown, where are you? Should I back up the bus?"
The same happened to ARRY last month. The holders sold at mid $30.00 and the pps now is $15xxThere is a reason why large holders sell............ they just don't tell you what it is.
"Josh pushed me out of the way at the exit door ah last I did get $29.3 though. On the flip side the er seemed good, I jumped back in at $27"
100% correct here. Also chlorine and AG pools shortages This industry is in huge demand with shortages and Leslie’s is the worlds largest pool supply company. Owns most on line sites
I’m looking at opening a position do you think now is a good time to do that?
why the heavy insider selling
"loaded up... thanks ""over reactive market!"""
LOOK LIKE THE BREAKOUT IS COMING. THIS STOCK IS GOING OVER $29
There are your 13 million shares in a nutshell!FORWARD!!! MARCH!!!
LESL is up 7.77% to 25.38
biggest joke stock ever
Need some volume to get this moving.

"Tried to get some IPO shares through E*TRADE, priced at $17. However no allocation for me. This should perform well"
Can anybody tell me when the next earnings report is
After what I just heard on CNBC I have decided that Josh Brown is a shape shifter. Somehow bragging that he knew what was going to happen. Nope.
i like redditt target... as they move out of AMC
It is called lock up... once a stock ipos 6 months after they are able to sell shares after ownership for year... this happens with every stock and LESL insider selling is a lot than I have seen from most companies... looks great :)
limit on chlorine @ pool store
What is wrong with this market lol. Josh Brown says Leslie's and it goes up 3%. You people need jobs
LESL is up 8.08% to 30.57
Gonna be a good day tomorrow
"Damn straight, this stock is down 5 points for no good reason. It is not like there isn't a shortage of pool supplies and chemicals that is going to continue for a while."
This looked like an ok company until I saw the leverage and credit ratings. Credit rating is junk and leverage is over 5. I already own POOL and will continue to add to that and pass up on this one. POOL is the better company. I realize the chlorine shortage may be a boon for both companies' stock prices but POOL is financially much healthier than LESL.
Selling $25 CSP's for July...this is a good stock RMR will be great over next 12-18 months...
"The earnings report made no mention of same store sales growth that I saw. Remember it's pretty easy to beat last years quarterly numbers when you've increased the total number of stores. Even if sales were muted, I'm guessing it had a lot to do with the Chlorine shortage."
LESL is down 4.95% to 23.63
"I work in the swim pool industry and have for the past 28 years. The past 2 years, I have never seen anything like it. It is definitely a BOOM in the building of swim pools. The pool builder I do the most of my work for. He is so backed up. If you sign contract for him to build pool, he can't come dig the hole till summer of 2023. This BOOM isn't ending anytime soon. I've always said that the pool business is recession proof. Only people who have money have swim pools. And believe me, they want their swim pool right no matter the cost."
1-3 month stochastics are predicting upward momentum.Write that down and get back with me in 2 weeks!
LESL has 65 stores just in the Dallas area :) do a store locator on the company website :)
Try before you buy.
Leslie's is up 5.72% to 24.01
Another indirectly related new business that should have some positive impact on Leslie’s is “Swimply” the new pool rental gig.
LESL is up 7.55% to 22.51
"Josh pumping Leslie on Halftime Report. Here are some of the highlights:1) almost no ones knows about this stock2) ultimately this company will turn into an incredible cash flow generation annuity stream3) record # of pools built in 2020, another record will occur in 20214) once you build a pool, you need to maintain it - chemicals, parts, toys5) LESL is a long term hold6) growth is explosive. Backlog of pool building is at record level. Part of the suburbanization of America.7) secular bull market for pools, hot tubs, etc.8) Leslie has the biggest presense in this market9) When Josh first started talking about it on today's show, the stock price was $27.64"
This thing is gonna trade at least 5 times average 10 day volume by 4pm.Solid downside support level.I see it moving up next week.We’ll see.
As soon as options expire tomorrow this is over 25
Playing LESL and ANGI... the TX disaster puts these companies in play.
