Only matter of time when this company will be scooped by a bigger company. Excellent product line!

"IART recently received a $70 price target, but the stock has fallen to close to $52. Earnings report seemed positive looking forward, so the stock seems like a buy at this level. Always a chance a bigger player may try to scoop them up. Good luck!"
