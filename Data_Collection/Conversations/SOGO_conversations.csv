all right fine I'm in for small position
"TD Ameritrade's ""New Constructs"" evaluation team just rated SOGO a strong buy after it came out with the AI news and its recent growth and positive outlook.From talks I have had with others in the tech industry, AI is the new up and coming. It is wise to get in early and weather the storms for future long term growth/goals."
"I bought 1150 last Monday, and added another 850 share per 13.46 per share. Sogo has a bright future."
"It’s a great stock, don’t forget why you bought it. If you want make big money, you should be calm and unwavering long, shorts want cheap stocks to cover, don’t sell your stocks when it’s cheap to help them."
"Just for everyones information, ads are now back in the sogou search results. I was able to locate quite a few."
"How many shares and what avg price is everyone holding this stock now? This question has been asked at bili board but not here, just curious...."
I am contributing too much light to this board...
Sogo earnings surprise seems to be positivie https://aicody.com/articles/stocks/sogou-inc-internet-software-and-it-services-online-services-stock-analysis-2018-forecast-58d749103be83247
They have a billion in cash people they will recover
"How much consideration do you think is given to the timing of the ER release? For example, do you think companies are considering their results and saying... well, it's best for the pps if everybody has time to chew on the news, so we will plan to release the ER late in the week after the bell. Or, like SOGO, the opposite... aka we like the news so we will schedule it before the bell Monday morning in order to allow the most postive and immediate impact to the pps...Not saying they do this... just asking the question.. how many of you think this kind of thought is considered by companies? Or, perhaps you think it's just nearly random...??"

Hoping for 30 bucks by the fall
"SOGO CEO : We already have a number of new AI-enabled products in the pipeline that we plan to launch before the end of the year, but we're not disclosing the specific product at this stage. You can be sure that it will incorporate some of our core AI technology that Sogou is known for including voice and Q&A, in addition to translation.We believe these products leveraging our AI capabilities will help us build a product differentiation and competitiveness, and it also offers us flexibility to cater for higher gross margin products or low price to market to gain market share. And one thing I want to add is that these products are more consumer-orientated, and it's more closely connected with our core AI capabilities, measured interaction and the knowledge computing."
"Reading the latest earning reports, Sogou's CEO mentioned that it added more authoritative content and deepened relationship with WeChat: ""In search, we bolstered our differentiated services in key verticals, such as healthcare, where we added more authoritative content, leading to a solid increase in related search queries and click through rate. We also deepened our partnership with WeChat by providing more search services such as our encyclopedia and interactive Q&A platform. Overall, our core search business maintained solid growth with revenues increasing by 45% year-over-year. During the quarter, we enhanced functionality of the Sogou Mobile Keyboard to better meet user needs for smart interaction and expression. Our AI-powered innovations drove broader adoption of the Sogou Mobile Keyboard, with DAU increasing by 36% year-on-year to 380 million in the second quarter.""It would not be surprising that sooner or later Tencent's WeChat will integrate Sogou search deeper into the WeChat ecosystem. Afterall Tencent owns majority of Sogou's shares.Target price: $17."

What are the positives and negatives with this company?
"My take on next week: Many current shareholders bought between 15.5 and 11 and are underwater. They are hoping for good earnings to boost stock so they can bail out. There are too many shareholders looking to sell....it will keep a lid on the share price. Unless the numbers are stellar, which is unlikely. When the numbers are reported, those that were looking to sell are going to sell no matter what."
This company makes profit 400 million a year and has a cap of 4 billion and strong growth. This is a great buy right now
This will be $15 shortly... BUYING 2000 @ 12.60
"The big negative appears to be the cost of acquiring traffic increase caused by price inflation due to increased competition. Yet, SOGO still beat ..growing some 40% YOY. So while I get why those increased revenue cost would be a concern, the fact that SOGO absorbed them and continued to grow in line with previous qtrs says something too, which seems to be getting overlooked entirely in this premarket. As I said previously, it’s as though this market is looking for SOGO to fail and any excuse they’ll drive it lower. In any case, I feel there’s enough positives in SOGO that there’s no need to panick, so I’ll be watching to see how it plays out for a bit here..."
we've had 10% days up also. this company is sound. those days will happen again. this is just volatility playing out. they will be making ~1.2 billion revenue this yr. and still profitable. it not going anywhere.
"Remember, this company is profitable, growing fast and has 1 billion in cash on hand. Good backers to boot."
should I buy now?
buy now
Exclusive: China set to clear Tencent's $3.5 billion Sogou deal subject to data security conditions - sources
Sogou is gaining an increasing share of the China search market. As search is their the bulk of their revenue this will have a positive impact on the bottom line.
cup and handle suggest next price target of $17.
Will be back at $10 in no time. Mark it.
impressive breakout today bought 2000shs
Bought @13.15
"Bought 1000 shares, wechat integration and new AI investment from a well know university in China. Y not"
I can wait for earnings for this to jump. I think it will hit a new high after.
Thankyou for sharing information to us. https://thebestfilletknife.com/
do you guys think SOGO will go up to $20 this week? thanks
"Sogou, China’s third-largest internet search engine was discussing a partnership with Google, whereby the US company would use its algorithm to conduct the searches, while Sogou will screen the search results to comply with China’s censorship rules.Although Google has not provided its services to users in China after its departure in 2010, the company maintains offices in Hong Kong and Taiwan, where it sells digital advertising to Chinese companies who wish to advertise internationally.Google is also in constant dialogue with Beijing as the company seeks to eventually re-enter the Chinese market, Schmidt said previously.Google co-founder Sergey Brin also previously stated that certain units of Alphabet, as Google’s holding company is called, may return to China, hinting at the company’s ambitions to once again operate in the country."
"Technicals. Morning reaction low of $4.90 may be new support. Need a week to confirm support level. Net minor pullback from $5.50 to $5.35 now is positive. Volume 2mm plus shows people still interested in this name. Supply comes in at $5.80 to $6.00. Next announcement will probably pop price through supply. So $6.05 is key trade, on volume."
i think Sogo is more than search. actually their expertise is AI. AI is the next generation of computerized based evolution. china wants to be #1 in this area. in actual fact Sogo is a leader in this niche. long term investment in sogo is betting on an AI future. search is the way that sogo obtains data to develop its algorithms.
"I think this is a good article to reflect on. It has many facts, positives, and also highlights the biggest concerns.. at least in this writers eyes... the biggest concern being how small of a search company it is as it pertains to the history of such companies.When you consider 1.1billion in cash and NO debt along with brilliant leadership in the AI communications and information industry that has garnered such excitement as to lead to selling out a new translator product on the first day as your positives, I reckon you have to look to ‘90’s .com search companies who held small market share of searches as the biggest negative you can find about SOGO.Fair enough. In that case, I’d say the biggest key to the ER that will send the stock price soaring is any indication that the 3.71% of search market share has increased... the more the better. After garnering as much attention and excitement as SOGO has with their products along with a steady record of growth powered by very healthy financials and solid relationships with companies like Tencent, I like our chances that SOGO improves that number.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/history-small-search-companies-says-171823333.html"
CEO Said: Increasing market share 2-3% / yr what mean ? repurchase share ?
This stock is a company with solid earnings that is trading right where it should be based on its history. Positive news/advancements on AI developments and positive earnings the next quarter will create upward momentum and bring SOGO into the light.
"BIDU has market cap of $35 b. SOGO has market cap of $2 b. Per below, search engine market share is comparable. ??? Both need to get back to revenue growth, but disparity is just too great. SOGO market cap of $5 b not unreasonable, which is 2.5 X current value. As always, we need a market/operational delta to get things rolling."
"“The documents seen by The Intercept suggest that Google will operate the search app as part of a “joint venture” with an unnamed partner company, which will presumably be based in China.“ It makes sense for this to be sogou.https://theintercept.com/2018/08/01/google-china-search-engine-censorship/"
"A Lot of holders are in around $12.00 - $13.00 range, any predictions on where we might run up to before and after earnings call? My guess 13.75 $14.10 before call $16.75 - $17.50 after call"
"Very good price action on 4x avg volume. Not a likely short squeeze, because less then 2M shares short on 51M float. Someone’s merely buying on conviction."
Another China buyout-investment. BABA is buying 35% profits interest in Ant financial from Ma. Company consolidation continues. CYOU and BITA were announced previously.
"Units up 5 cents on 1981 shares at opening. This means no supply at these levels. SOGO appears to have consolidated at $5.00-$5.20, a little lower than my first estimate. Want to see whether stock buyback info released on Oct 1, per my below advice below. Units will then go into quiet period, per the SEC. No buybacks or buyouts until after Q3 financials release. 10 days after management analysis of business will be key, ie Nov 10-20 est. We'll see, to quote Gus."
This should be at $30 at least last quarter earnings great growth
Fair value imo is $37+
Total EPS is expected to be 0.58 for this fiscal year. This would give the share price an estimated median value of $29. http://stocknewsgazette.com/2018/06/26/sogou-inc-sogo-interesting-series-of-developments-taking-place/
WUBA just taken private-US unit holders bought out. The same will happen to SOGO. Price action today suggest that event will occur sooner than later.
"Came public at 13, we are in the first inning folks,growing 30% lots of cash in bank and they make a profit"
"Do me a favor and go to yahoo finance major holder's. Look at that list, we are in good hands. Also, 1B in rev and 1B cash on hand and current market cap is only 2.3B, way undervalued with Intrinsic value at 10.55. This stock will make a comeback, buy before more investors realize this is my opinion"
Volume is three times the average volume and it is in an up trend....a GOOD sign!
"Sogo is selling hardware in China (旅行翻译宝 translator and 速记翻译笔 translating recording pen) and they are flying off the shelves. The translator is the best selling in its category in jd.com. SOGO is targeting one million translators per year. At roughly RMB1400 each, that's 1.4 billion = over US200 million revenue right there that is nearly uncounted for previously. And the pen is selling at RMB 398 each. Overall, the next quarterly report will blow your mind!"
Ready to fly.
Just bought 65 shares. Nice 9.36..
Profitable. Growing. Leveraging intellectual capital = reasons to invest. It's a startup though. Make no mistake and will have all the risks/ variability of one.
what a great time to buy this profitable company at such a low price. I am going all in today.
"Sogou will reveal a new AI consumer device in the 2nd half of the year, hopefully at the earning release. It’s not a speaker, not a translator according to Chinese news outlets. The CEO seemed to be pretty excited about it."
for long term....$45
Whose buying at open before it kicks off again?
Any take on this? https://www.barchart.com/story/home/508548/options-traders-expect-huge-moves-in-sogou-sogo-stock
"Just announced that BITA has received a preliminary buyout bid of $16.00. BITA sales are declining this year and estimates have bee cut often. If BITA is worth $16.00, SOGO is worth at least $10.00. Company will buy in all shares it can get at these levels to set up even higher bid."
Did not sold but added more
I add more at $14...good buy opportunity
"BIDU had one of their worst quarters since 2006, and their shares lost 16.52% in Friday's trading. If you look at this linked resource, you can see that SOGO is, indeed, making large inroads into BIDU's market shares. Hopefully, some of the investment strategies of traders and institutions will push more investment money towards SOGO that used to be allotted to BIDU:http://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share/desktop/china"
It’s so rare that Brad hasn’t posted 12 or more times by this point in the day. I don’t even have to look at the summary page to know the direction of the stock I just count the number of Brad’s posts... or in today’s case lack there of.
3 mil shares in first 1/2 hour...Nice
"1.2 billion earnings on 3.5 billion market cap and growing. just think about that.... if this is not a value growth stock, i dont know what is."
can We go $15 tomorrow? futures are up.
"The real opportunity here is in sohu. Sohu is trading at $600M and will receive $1.2B if sogo is sold at $9.00.Also, sohu is turning around and will become profitable again on its own soon.Sohu is currently at $15 and should be at $22 on its own based on this news alone."
"There’s great opportunity at these levels. Once Trump and Xi make the deal of the century next month, I believe all the good Chinese stocks will start a new uptrend. The Chinese economy has been depressed the past couple years. The deal will provide more certainty to the Chinese economy. No reason sogo can’t get to $20 by end of year."
"""We are confident that the Sogou Travel Translator is the most accurate and powerful machine translation solution on the market,"" said Xiaochuan Wang, Chief Executive Officer of Sogou. ""The significance of AI cannot be overstated, and I believe that AI has the potential to be as meaningful for humankind as the invention of electricity."
Top websites in China are 1. Baidu 2. Qq then 30. Sogou according to Alexa which I think is fairly accurate at these high levels. Funny thing is go to qq.com and type something in the search box. Someone reply with what happens.
"We were amply warned that revenue would be down while they work on new smart tech. They are doing just what they said they would. Sogou has a long term strategy and they're sticking to it, no instant gratification here. Hold!"
Sogo's rating forecast is buy for 2018 https://aicody.com/articles/stocks/sogou-inc-internet-software-and-it-services-online-services-stock-analysis-2018-forecast-58d749103be83247
Thankyou. https://www.globaldigitalmagazine.com/
"I don’t know what SOGO price reaction will be today, but I’m not judging it by this premarket action. The ER isn’t a clear beat, so pre-market imo is not necessarily indicative. I think the MM’s are going to be the ones (as usual) to decide what the price reaction will be and they will respond when they are good and ready.Having said that, Im still hopeful their response will be to buy. All things considered, the ER is full of positives, and when you consider SOGO is about $3 cheaper than IPO price, it seems like a nice bargain here.. especially considering the ER certainly still shows great balance sheet, leading innovation, and great continuing growth..."
"Although I bought some more at $9.5, no time to celebrate yet. I will heel to Buffet's advice, take it in and let it rest, don't let day-to-day's up and down lead you. Those who have doubts, please let me know where I can find company that delivers YOY growth rate in high 30%, and QOQ rate at 62%, and at this price? Will love to hear it and jump on your recommendation too...Thanks in advance."
Hitting average daily volume in less than 30 minutes. Price appreciation on high volume. Always a good thing....
have a great weekend all
"The stock based...moved sideways, for the whole month of May. Also, it’s working to regain its IPO price. Looking good."
Nice after hour volume for a Friday...approx.174.000 shares as of 6pm
Sogou (NYSE:SOGO): Q2 EPS of $0.09 beats by $0.02.Revenue of $301.4M (+42.9% Y/Y) misses by $3.15M.
This should be at $30 very undervalued
https://finance.yahoo.com/video/sogou-ceo-staying-ahead-artificial-002700645.html
"The coronavirus has FORCED 1,300,000,00 Chinese to spend more time online as they bunker in place. SOGO is the number 2 search engine in China. I am not entirely clear as to their revenue streams, but they WILL benefit HUGELY. The fact that management is silent merely increases the potential inevitable upside, At some point this will explode upward. The unit was $5.25-5.45 before the virus hit. The first leg is back to that level. 12 month potential is back to $15.00 high. Calculated as follows: $.37 high yahoo eps estimate + corona effect= $.50 eps X 30, because it is then a growth stock. From my mouth to God's ears. When this works, I will pay off my house with my 10,000 share position."
No.1 mobile search and keyboard 2nd place in PC search No.1 In voice input. BAT are all in self driving SOGO is backing up for tenchy's mobile map auto search voice input and infortainment
"Martin is happy today just because not only sogo but the 99% of the stock market turned red . Give me a break , loaded 1000 more shares today. And ready to load some more ."
This will tire at the mid 30 rangeIMHO
Any ideas on what's driving up the price today other than maybe an institutional buyer taking a large position? I've held 500 shares for months and have been waiting patiently for some price appreciation.
"Trump announcing being open to interim trade deal removes one downside risk. Alhtough normally need a week to establish new trading range, this announcement truncates that need. Support is now at $5.20 with minor possible spike down to $4.90. Very little supply until $6.00 to $6.50.Net: stock will take out $5.55 latest high and move to trading range of $5.90 to $6.20."
"I think we all need to step back, simplify our perspective, and relax...Some of you have been with SOGO far longer than me, so correct me if I’m wrong. But as I understand, the new translator sold out on the first day. If that’s correct, think about what category that puts SOGO in. How many companies can you think of that launch a product and on day 1 it sells out? Barring bad planning, which I’m confident this smart CEO wouldn’t allow, it’s a rare flock to be amongst. Furthermore, how many public companies that have had such a product have then had a bad earnings thereafter? I don’t know the answer, but I’d be willing to bet it’s an extremely small % of the whole. Of course, that’s just 1 product.. 1 source of revenue for SOGO, but I think it’s more than that. It’s an indicator. It indicates that Chinese are very aware of SOGO and it’s products... and excited about them. This, imo, is a great positive indicator for what the ER May soon reveal."
By this for a long term hold.. very nice...
this is a long term hold. they are building out technology over years. they are growing profits and revenue. investing in themselves. billion in cash. this was a positive report. even better value now.
SO GOOD
Zack's upgraded SOGO to a buy over the weekend.https://macondaily.com/2018/03/24/sogou-sogo-upgraded-to-buy-by-zacks-investment-research.html
"Fundamentals. This stock is impossible to analyse on a pe ratio/earnings basis(as AMZN has been since listing). The $3.30 price objective on yahoo is clearly now an outlier. Expect $3.30 target to move to $4.50, so analyst does not look out of step. Q3 sales have no last year comparison. Key metric, IMO, will be Q4 sales guidance and resultant year over year increase. Good guidance will show new program revenue generation is taking hold. By the time earning/pe is relevant this company will have been bought out."
Tencent Media and SOGO ai mentioned today by a tech analyst on Bloomberg radio....somebody apparently is accumulating.
"Will SOGO be next? Tencent bid for bitauto several months ago. Once deal is completed, the investment bankers hand off the ball to the operations people. It is nor unreasonable to think they take the weekend off, come in and start working on the next deal. AI is too important to ignore. SOGO has spent millions to the detriment of earnings to build capabilities in area. Maybe we get really lucky?"
20 soon
"There is a ton of outstanding July 20 calls at 12.50, 15.00 and 17.50. Bullish."
"I have done so well with IQ, I decided to buy 500 shares of SOGO Friday. So glad I did. I might have to buy 500 more tomorrow!"
finally!!!!!! waking up happy is actually good.
"Couple of years ago I purchased 500 shares of Sogo: price has not moved much......I’m $700.00 upside down. Question should I hold position or sell position, and buy into Baba or tencent or JD, Tesla, SQ, Nio Sea or Apple ??? Or Sell position and hold Cash for next big dip in market  Any positive feedback would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for your help "
30 plus by earnings
"Like Baba, the CEO also indicates his willingness to list in China's stock market. http://stock.jrj.com.cn/2018/03/02204024183347.shtml"
Poor expectations was already priced in. Current PE is less than Industry peer average. Growth story intact with EPS expectation of 0.66 in 2018. That will be double of 2017. Even at this PE the price will be $25 in 12 months. If the innovation that we expect is turned on with the $1B in cash on hand then the premium may double. Stay long.
"I've read the earnings transcript word for word and, quite frankly, if SOGO were a US based company with their current financial numbers, usership, outlook, products, etc, it would not surprise me if their stock were trading north of $50+. And if anyone tries to justify that SOGO's price is correct for its current state, then it really reaffirms how ludicrously over-priced so many US Tech companies have become. I own a decent amount of SOGO and have been underwater for some time. But I am going to add more at this price with that ER - I find it hard to believe this stock is going to stay down here forever with their positioning and products going forward. GLTA"
"I have no ""evidence"" to back up my theory, but I just love it when company's like SOGO announce earnings BEFORE the market opens, especially on a Monday morning. It's like, they are going to be good and we have nothing to hide."
"In the short-term SOGO is under pressure but over the long-term SOGO will likely go up a lot above $30 anytime. Consider that Tencent's QQ search is powered by SOGOU and Tencent's WeChat search is likely powered also by SOGOU but no one knows for sure. Tencent being the largest shareholder of SOGOU at 38.7% (this is after IPO) look more and more a smart strategy to expand SOGOU which provided technologies and capabilities to Tencent. Target $30+ or even $50 per share in near to medium term is likely attainable as SOGOU overtime will show massive growth in its mobile search business due to Tencent connection. In October 2017, Sogou also began testing a general search engine within WeChat, which would allow all 902 million daily active users to access the internet within the app. All in all SOGO is an awesome undervalued Chinese technology company to buy and hold dearly. With access to 900+ million users, SOGO is on the line to be the hyper-growth king of mobile search."
"I'll be at breakeven when it reaches $13.50, hoping we get there before earnings and if earnings are strong I should be in a good spot, beats being 30% down at one point. Things are looking up."
going to $10
Thanks for the great 900 share at $12.45 https://gamesrbx.com/
wow nice hold.
next month will see $30 keep buying now before you miss the train time to add more share $50 by yr end
"You can buy the #2 search engine in China for $1 b($2.1 b market cap less$1.1 b cash). AND get everything else for FREE. Earnings have held unit back, but they are distorted by HUGE(for this sized company) r&d. Company should have $5 b market cap, minimum implying a $13.00 price, imo."
"I am still holding. At one point, after I bought in January, I was a full 34.6% down, when the stock hit 8.12 as its year low-day-finish, on April 3rd. And, at one point, I was up 22.7%, when the June 19th 15.22 closing price occurred. The long game will produce the win.My target is a double, my patience is long, and my cognitive abilities are good."
The reason there is no downside here is because Sogou has already PROVEN to be a sustainable business model. It is EXTREMELY easy to see this becoming the Baidu of social mobile web searching with Tencent in their corner. You can take a market cap of Sogou at $4.9 Billion and compare it to Google $722 Billion and Baidu $81 Billion and see how much upside potential we have from the current levels. When they discuss increasing their relationship with Tencent and further incorporating their product with WeChat... that fact alone gives this incredible upside potential. We can sit around and wait on this to develop further because they are already highly profitable.We are investing in a company that will be continuously fed by a monster. Such an easy buy at this price. I feel bad for the folks getting shaken out.
"China Stocks Rebound With Biggest Gain Since 2016, Yuan Climbs.Today's NEWS. Bloomberg"
"The vision of Sogou's CEO Wang Xiaochuan for next generation of the internet search is very clear and precise, if you watch his video speech or interview. He is trying to make the traditional internet search to an advanced ""Q&A"" system, and make the communication between human and machines or everything more easy and convenient. All tech behind this ambition is the company's heavy focused AI technology."
it was already cheap around $13 so now is one good opportunity to buy and hold
"Attended a presentation about Chinese digital ecosystems by a Beijing based IT company last week. No a mention of BABA but a lot about new entrants using the WeChat platform and in search engines Sogou. They predicted Sogou will take market share away from Baidu, in particular because Sogou does use the WeChat (Tencent owned) platform and is already the number 2 search engine in China with a rich language translation engine and AI capabilities.E-commerce generic providers get a lot of competition from specialises online stores."
Down 17% in one month on no news...most likely a buy. This is a company that signed a 5 year deal with tencent/wechat/qq and is sitting on their cards until trade deal settles.
Typically volume says a lot more than PPS. Since June 1 the trading volume is significantly enlarged and continues the trend. This means institutes heavily rush in.
Sogou’s AI team won a championship of “road objects detection” this month in CVPR 2018.http://bdd-data.berkeley.edu/wad-2018.html
i'm seeing this at 100 by year end.
Not a bad day all things considered!
"Chart looks great! Next piece of good news, stock goes to $5.20 in a heartbeat. With everything going on and SOGO timely updates, good news is a question of when, not if."
Hoping for 20% by Christmas.
sogo its upgraded to buy and hold.
"Units go to $10.00 this year based on three premises. One, China trade deal signed. Two, stock buybacks initiated then augmented. Three, joint venture with major player. $.37 high estimate then becomes $.50+ X 20 pe=$10.00."
"Picked up another 100 shares at 10.75 this morning. I'm hoping we're going to see a nice upswing, again, shortly."
Hold it or Add it.
What’s wrong with this stock why is it stuck? I check my broker it’s also frozen
Tencent just licensed all web md content to be delivered on qq and wechat. Cheers
"Sogo is deeply partnered with tencent that has large holding in companies like Snapchat, Spotify, epic games fort night, supercell clash royale, qq, wechat. If they want this to be the number one search in China they can make it happen."
Two great announcements today:1) China increase liquidity which is positive for markets ($100 billion) 2) China announced it will never hurt US businesses operation in China to get back at trump.. (positive show of good will and market will take that favourable and so will the whitehouse)
"Isaac Newton was one of the three greatest minds in recorded history, the other two being Albert Einstein and Srinivasa Ramanujan. Newton's first law states(paraphrased) that an object will remain at rest until acted upon by an outside force, i.e. a delta. What are the 3 most important/imminent potential deltas here? First, progress on US/China trade impasse. While ultimate resolution is far in the future, any progress is a delta to SOGO. Second, company internal progress, either already happened or projected. Earnings conference call in several weeks provides a timeline. Third, indications of additional corporate ownership/joint venture initiatives. Any of these deltas will induce increased urge to own with the resultant unit price movement. Just waiting for the delta. Barring the zombie apocalypse, good support at $4.90 to $5.10."
"Until the trade war is resolved this stock will remain in the doldrums along with Baidu, its main competitor. I doubt it will go much lower. When it tanked below 5 on Pre Xmas selloff, it still closed at this level. But yo9u never know. Maybe Tencent will make a bid."
"The price reaction pre-market is over reaction for a decent earnings report. First of all all the top line growth figures including lowered projection do not show negative growth quarter over quarter. Secondly, the company still has $1 billion+ in cash and no debt. Longer term, Sogou should be able to recover to $17."
No doubt this stock will go up but it will take time. Lots of time.
and vice versa. english speakers will understand chinese and have access to their markets... using artificial intelligence to have quality response.
this company would be well served to update investors with regards to their operations. it seems quite opaque with regards to cash flow generation and growth prospects.
add more shares. Thanks me later
why does keep dropping with no reason ? I thought this was a good position with growth potential.
Worth $20- 30/ share. market cap 7.5 to 10 billion. growing faster than Baidu. Tencent is a superior ecosystem to be part of and will become its own economy via Wechat. Sogo and AI will power search logistics. nice to be able to get in on the ground floor.
I think i am going to sit back and see what happens the next few days. The momentum upward is a great sign we are going higher. How hi i do not know but the stage is set for Monday before market opens. There might be some surprise announcement coming our way. I have a feeling SOGO is a takeover target by Tencent this baby could really move to the upside with an announcement like that. I am feeling good going into earnings lets hope next Monday produces a lot of money in our pockets for us longs.
this will be 20 next week
"A lot of shorts need to cover, it’s going up in aftermarket, have a great weekend longs, it will be 20+ next week..."
If this doesn’t beat earnings we can all eat mr noodles the next 5 years together
The whole tech market is red. It's just an opportunity to load more. I would say $13.9 is a good buy
We will receive $9.00 in cash for each share. Deal closed.
"I have a feeling, $12 is coming soon"
"I'm looking for tax advice... this year I have made a realized capital gain of 28k but so far unrealized loss -45 k with SOGO, so my question to anyone want help me ...is better sell SOGO and buy it again the same day to save capital gain taxes ?? Please any advise is welcomeThanks"
Currently green pre-market. This thing will come back over 15 today.
Awesome article someone posted. Feeling much better about SOGO’s future.https://technode.com/2018/05/29/if-you-focus-youll-think-up-a-hundred-ways-to-solve-a-problem-exclusive-interview-with-sogou-ceo-wang-xiaochuan/%E2%80%AC

great day tomorrow guys
"http://m.techweb.com.cn/article/2018-07-11/2684943.shtmlHere's copy of the translated page:""From July 10th to 11th, the 2018 China Big Data Application Conference held in Chengdu, with the theme of ""Big Data Empowering Digital China"", invited the world's leading leaders in big data, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, blockchain and other fields. Experts, scholars, industry leaders, application supervisors and users from all industries participated in this event. The content of the conference has covered a wide range of hot topics in the current technology field, and the difficulty of translation has soared. It is worthy of recognition that the translation performance of Sogou’s simultaneous interpretation has been unanimously recognized by the audience. As the guest's speech progressed, the bilingual Chinese and English subtitles were immediately synchronized on the big screen. The ultra-high efficiency and precision of almost zero time difference and zero error made Sogou a ""C star"" at the conference site.It is understood that Sogou is the world's first commercial machine simultaneous interpretation, based on big data and deep learning, covering Sogou's independent research and development of speech recognition, machine translation two important technologies, not only can be efficiently identified and translated, but also automatically based on semantics Modify and adjust the previously identified content to show more accurate interpretation results. For the international high-end conferences with intensive goods, it is difficult for the audience to digest the ""knowledge points"" by ""listening"". The Chinese-English bilingual subtitles in real-time interpretation obviously relieve the audience of a lot of burdens and high-quality participation experience. Sogou is being passed along with the standard of various international conferences.As Sogou's simultaneous interpretation continues to deepen learning and self-renewal, its functions will become more and more powerful. With the deepening of Sogou's layout in the field of artificial intelligence, it is hard to imagine how profound changes artificial intelligence will bring to our lives. At present, Sogou has carried out product landing in search, input method, map, and other application scenarios. It is not necessary to wait until the future, that is, now, all aspects of life can deeply feel the benefits that technology brings to us."
"SOGO @ 14.75, aka Baby Tencent. is another IQ like setup, with a huge backer/investor in Tencent. It might need a little digestion here at $14ish, but if the group remains strong, at 5.5x revenue, this has room to 7-9x, which is a big move to $18-22."
was luck to find this when it was $8.51
"the current pullback has 0 to do with fundamentals in this company. its a general decline across the board as seen in tencent, jd, iq and many US stocks as well. to get discouraged and pull out will cause unnecessary losses. remember its still profitable and growing. 1 billion in the bank."
bought some like this company alot
WeChat hits 1 BILLION DAU. And SOGO is its search engine used to connect to products from the likes of JD.com. That’s how WeChat is generating revenue. Search engine embedded within a social media giant like WeChat. Seems like a big deal to me :-)Hoping more PR that puts an emphasis is on this.
Finally!!! Finally profitable on this after a long wait. Woot woot
Thank you shorts for driving price down. will be buying more incrementally if it goes lower.
"I'm going to say this one last time, and that's it. I don't mean to sound like I am pumping SOGO. That's not my intention. I'd actually like to hear counter ideas to my point here so long as they are genuine and constructive thoughts.But... I cannot help but think SOGO is in a very prime position for the potential of getting bought into by Google. As if we have not already spoken about this topic enough, here is my reasoning...1. Clearly Google wants a piece of the China market... and rightfully so... it's only natural. Yet Google faces a problem. At home, they face the potential of criticism for not standing on their policy due to the whole censorship deal that would be required by participating in the China market. In China, they have to overcome the reputation they've already created... especially as it pertains to the China government. These are not easy challenges nor challenges that should be easily taken on... especially if there are alternative ways.2. Clearly Google is working with Tencent in what seems to be a progressive manor. Having a strong relationship with Tencent could be highly beneficial to both companies as while they are both very large, capable companies, yet they also each have slightly different areas of expertise. Tencent's primary expertise has been in gaming and, of course, Google's expertise have all stemmed from Search.3. I can't imagine, Google... with the bank roll they carry, wanting to re-enter the China market starting from a tiny market share relative to the current big players. Especially in light of the reputation challenges Google already faces in China, that just seems like a bad idea. So, if Google is truly going to re-enter the China market, they are going to find a way into a big chunk of market share from the onset IMO. So, where does this market share come from? Well, it just so happens that Tencent has the WeChat app that has 900 million DAU's... that's crazy... So much so that I'd love for somebody to double check me on that number, but it is what I read. 900 million DAU's... and SOGO is the exclusive Search provider for that app. Now that's opportunity for market share... and that's just one aspect of the future Market Share position that SOGO has as a company. Tencent owns SOGO, so it's no surprise that SOGO is the exclusive search provider for the app, but that being the case, it certainly should make SOGO attractive for an entity like GOOGLE who is looking for an immediate entry pt into big China market share.4. I think Google can resolve a number of their issues with getting back into China by simply not going in as ""Google"" but instead by slipping into the market as simply an owner of a company who already has established market share and a proven 'market functional' name. They can then back the established company who'll continue to take care of China censorship related matters, which absolves Google from the compromising situation of being directly involved in censorship, which could lead to bigger problems for Google both in China and abroad. As an owner, Google would simply let their China based subsidiary take care of those censorship matters.5. So who would Google buy into? They aren't going to buy the biggest players, but a company that sits about 3rd in overall market share may be the sweet spot. SOGO's browser is, from what I understand, a Google browser. SOGO's primary owner is Tencent, who Google is already partnering in an expansive way with, and their secondary owner is SOHU... who might could use the money right now. Furthermore, SOGO as a company fits super well within the parameters of who Google already is as a company. Search, Translation, AI... etc... All of them SOGO strengths ...and also Google strengths. 6. What about timing? Well, the US - China trade relations certainly provide an obstacle, but you can also argue that it creates an opportunity which perhaps makes this the absolute best time for a deal. China stocks have been devalued by the economic climate and as these conditions press on the companies, each company will need to make sure they are well suited to withstand the potential storms ahead. Things haven't been exactly wonderful lately for SOHU... from what I've gleaned, so SOHU may be well primed for an offer of their share of SOGO, which could help them now and better secure their foreseeable future. My suspicion is Tencent wouldn't give up their shares of SOGO... maybe some of it, but not all. But, that would only mean Tencent and Google are further entrenched in partnership... an action that would only fit the theme of recent events between the two companies. So, in any case, in many ways... this seems like the most opportune time to attempt to buy out SOHU IMO.All of this is entirely speculation on my part, but it makes so much sense to me that it makes it hard not to like speculating on Sogou. IMO, when something makes so much sense, there's a good reason for that."
Sogou Home built-in (enable) with Wechat ....how it sounds ?
drop won't last forever
Buy and hold
Momentum.
Will easily touch 10.80 in 5 trade days.
Great day!
Seems like Chinese stocks are moving up. $BABA is up by $6 Hopefully earning will be timely )))
"Just bought in 9636 shares let’s see how it turns out Monday. Company looks to have a good future and the translator product it created is amazing, can’t wait to buy one."
Seeking Alpha: Sogou - The Market Is Missing Huge Market Share Gains.https://seekingalpha.com/article/4275841-sogou-market-missing-huge-market-share-gains
Let’s get 16.00 today
"down 5k, holding off on taking a loss and banking on this company producing long term gains. Better for tax purposes and they are doing exactly what they are promising. SOHU is the issue and I hope we can distance ourself as much as possible from that sinking ship. Good luck to all. See ya in a year or so when this thing decides to get rocking again."
My average at 10.8 since feb and I still got faith with this company... have a look on long term guys
nice movement today.
"Tencent to invest $70B over next five years in technology upgrades, including AI. They own 30% plus of SOGO. Also SOGO maintains second spot in Chinese search, based on most recent data. And they have cash almost equal to their market value. This should easily pop back closer to 5. But they don't have any market presence here. Their website is in chinese, so hard to follow what they are doing. Bought 2500 this morning at 3.04. But underwater on my current holdings here."
I am in 3500 shares today. $9.30. I am also in Baidu . Been in for a very long time.
"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sogou-demonstrates-ai-capabilities-virtual-080000551.htmlBEIJING, July 25, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Sogou Inc.

Long on this
"20 days after the July 30th filing would be next Thursday, 8/19? Could be anytime after that."
"Leyou to be acquired by TCEHY after a bidding war potentially including Sony. Appears Leyou is another gaming company. SOGO with AI and search component expertise is a much more integral need of Tencent. If any overture to SOGO/SOHU is made, Tencent WILL ride to the rescue. Huge volume with no news argues fireworks are imminent. Strong Friday close through yearly high would be confirmation."
Bought 100 shares
translate device produced 2 million revenue on nearly a billion annual income. less than a drop in the bucket. most money comes from ad and tencent partnership.
"volumes here are key. they are at all time lows. once they volumes return, this will fly like before. it can gap up a dollar a day. we have 5 years of safety with the tencent contract till 2023. patience required."
"SogouIt is China's second largest search engine and the company is expected to use the sogou input method to further expand its market share in the search market and win long-term business value through its strategic alliance with Tencent. Based on the forecast of a compound CAGR of 18% for 18-20 years, we estimate Sogou’s profit CAGR for 18-20 years to be 69%. Our target price of US$12.60 is based on Non-GAAP EPS of US$0.35 in 2018, which corresponds to 36 times the projected PE in 2018 and 23 times the projected PE in 2019. The strategic cooperation with Tencent brings long-term value. We believe that, thanks to traffic support from Tencent applications (such as WeChat, Tencent News, and QQ Browser), Sogou’s revenue growth will exceed its peers. These applications accounted for 60% of the total use time of smart terminals in China. We expect that search and search-related business revenues will record a CAGR of 33% in 18-20 years, driven by enhanced search monetization and search traffic growth. Sogou input method and core search business synergy. Sogou input method is currently the most popular Chinese input method software, and the computer/mobile penetration rate is as high as 98%/70% respectively. We estimate that the number of active daily users of the Sogou input method by 2020 will exceed 500 million (in 2017, 331 million). Utilizing its extensive user base and cumulative user behavior data, Sogou input method can share traffic and data with Sogou’s core search business, significantly improving search efficiency."
People are aware of this now.... should see $20-30 in a month or two.
Short will be lock out . Sogo going up higher be patient long .
"I believe sogo will trade at around $30 to$50 in next couple years, just like other new ipo stocks, ppl are waiting for few more ER for this stock to make sure it is worth to invest in."
how is the market cap of this company barely higher than the amount of cash it has?
Started buying stocks on my own on 2/2017. This was one of my picks and I got 30 shares at 12.59. Shows how much I knew about stocks. Thank God I only bought 30 shares. Gonna be holding these bags for a while.
"If we see the Markets in the green this stock is going to explode upwards at close. Who knows where it will be Monday. My personal recommendation, BUY."
This train will be leaving station 15 soon. Onward to station 20.
I have lost more than 50% in this stock and still holding it. I hope it will pay me back some tomorrow
SOGO market cap 5 billion. SOGO has 1 billion cash...that's fantastic!

Forgetting stocks for the weekend and enjoying Canada day weekend 
"Fast Company selected Sogou as one of the most innovative companies in China due to the company's AI-powered portable translation devices that feature industry-leading image and speech recognition capabilities, as well as the ability to operate offline and simultaneously translate speech into different languages. In addition, Fast Company noted that Sogou's smart translation devices have tapped into significant consumer demand, as evidenced by the Sogou Travel Translator selling out on the day of its launch with sales exceeding $1.6 million."
fact is sogo is just getting started. still time to jump on. mobile search is the future....
Today is going to be a good day my friends.
"I gave in last week and sold. used the proceeds to increased my position in AMD and ROKU. Boy, I never time the market this good. It’s a great feeling. I think SOGO is a good company but it will take months and a China US trade deal to get this going. I’ll keep an eye on this and enter when it’s safer."
"I am not worry about too much Sogou. Its balance sheet is great, 1B cash in hand, no debt, 40% share hold by Tencent, only search engine for WeChat's 1B users, continue rising on revenue and earning, continue eat more market share from Beidu, leading AI based company in China especially the voice technology...It will be double the PPS in the following couple of months. I will hold long."
"Huge volume again tdy, SOGO is a volitile share just shows you what a difference a day makes. I bought in yesterday but I'm confident the alliance with Tencent this in the medium term will be strong with a couple of more high growth quarters this will be huge. Momentum plays a huge part and I believe Tencent will make this happen, they have set the course up to SOGO now to deliver. Time will tell."
now after market it will go up more
Hope for a better day tomorrow
