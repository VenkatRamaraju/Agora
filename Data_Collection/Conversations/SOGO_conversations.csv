Currently green pre-market. This thing will come back over 15 today.
Hitting average daily volume in less than 30 minutes. Price appreciation on high volume. Always a good thing....
"The coronavirus has FORCED 1,300,000,00 Chinese to spend more time online as they bunker in place. SOGO is the number 2 search engine in China. I am not entirely clear as to their revenue streams, but they WILL benefit HUGELY. The fact that management is silent merely increases the potential inevitable upside, At some point this will explode upward. The unit was $5.25-5.45 before the virus hit. The first leg is back to that level. 12 month potential is back to $15.00 high. Calculated as follows: $.37 high yahoo eps estimate + corona effect= $.50 eps X 30, because it is then a growth stock. From my mouth to God's ears. When this works, I will pay off my house with my 10,000 share position."
"Fundamentals. This stock is impossible to analyse on a pe ratio/earnings basis(as AMZN has been since listing). The $3.30 price objective on yahoo is clearly now an outlier. Expect $3.30 target to move to $4.50, so analyst does not look out of step. Q3 sales have no last year comparison. Key metric, IMO, will be Q4 sales guidance and resultant year over year increase. Good guidance will show new program revenue generation is taking hold. By the time earning/pe is relevant this company will have been bought out."

"SOGO CEO : We already have a number of new AI-enabled products in the pipeline that we plan to launch before the end of the year, but we're not disclosing the specific product at this stage. You can be sure that it will incorporate some of our core AI technology that Sogou is known for including voice and Q&A, in addition to translation.We believe these products leveraging our AI capabilities will help us build a product differentiation and competitiveness, and it also offers us flexibility to cater for higher gross margin products or low price to market to gain market share. And one thing I want to add is that these products are more consumer-orientated, and it's more closely connected with our core AI capabilities, measured interaction and the knowledge computing."
SO GOOD
"Another positive article (combine the facts in this article with the statcounter trend, and you'll start to ""get it"":China Region -- May 2018 -- SOGO -- Market Share Across All Platforms -- 3.71%China Region -- May 2019 -- SOGO -- Market Share Across All Platforms - 18.32%https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sogou-inc-nyse-sogo-attractive-105722272.html"
SOGO market cap 5 billion. SOGO has 1 billion cash...that's fantastic!
Poor expectations was already priced in. Current PE is less than Industry peer average. Growth story intact with EPS expectation of 0.66 in 2018. That will be double of 2017. Even at this PE the price will be $25 in 12 months. If the innovation that we expect is turned on with the $1B in cash on hand then the premium may double. Stay long.
"20 days after the July 30th filing would be next Thursday, 8/19? Could be anytime after that."
wow nice hold.

Two great announcements today:1) China increase liquidity which is positive for markets ($100 billion) 2) China announced it will never hurt US businesses operation in China to get back at trump.. (positive show of good will and market will take that favourable and so will the whitehouse)
I add more at $14...good buy opportunity
Sogou is gaining an increasing share of the China search market. As search is their the bulk of their revenue this will have a positive impact on the bottom line.
this company would be well served to update investors with regards to their operations. it seems quite opaque with regards to cash flow generation and growth prospects.
"Leyou to be acquired by TCEHY after a bidding war potentially including Sony. Appears Leyou is another gaming company. SOGO with AI and search component expertise is a much more integral need of Tencent. If any overture to SOGO/SOHU is made, Tencent WILL ride to the rescue. Huge volume with no news argues fireworks are imminent. Strong Friday close through yearly high would be confirmation."
"You can buy the #2 search engine in China for $1 b($2.1 b market cap less$1.1 b cash). AND get everything else for FREE. Earnings have held unit back, but they are distorted by HUGE(for this sized company) r&d. Company should have $5 b market cap, minimum implying a $13.00 price, imo."
"I've read the earnings transcript word for word and, quite frankly, if SOGO were a US based company with their current financial numbers, usership, outlook, products, etc, it would not surprise me if their stock were trading north of $50+. And if anyone tries to justify that SOGO's price is correct for its current state, then it really reaffirms how ludicrously over-priced so many US Tech companies have become. I own a decent amount of SOGO and have been underwater for some time. But I am going to add more at this price with that ER - I find it hard to believe this stock is going to stay down here forever with their positioning and products going forward. GLTA"
It looks like the deal will be closed very soon.
"Tencent to invest $70B over next five years in technology upgrades, including AI. They own 30% plus of SOGO. Also SOGO maintains second spot in Chinese search, based on most recent data. And they have cash almost equal to their market value. This should easily pop back closer to 5. But they don't have any market presence here. Their website is in chinese, so hard to follow what they are doing. Bought 2500 this morning at 3.04. But underwater on my current holdings here."
Today is going to be a good day my friends.
"I think this is a good article to reflect on. It has many facts, positives, and also highlights the biggest concerns.. at least in this writers eyes... the biggest concern being how small of a search company it is as it pertains to the history of such companies.When you consider 1.1billion in cash and NO debt along with brilliant leadership in the AI communications and information industry that has garnered such excitement as to lead to selling out a new translator product on the first day as your positives, I reckon you have to look to ‘90’s .com search companies who held small market share of searches as the biggest negative you can find about SOGO.Fair enough. In that case, I’d say the biggest key to the ER that will send the stock price soaring is any indication that the 3.71% of search market share has increased... the more the better. After garnering as much attention and excitement as SOGO has with their products along with a steady record of growth powered by very healthy financials and solid relationships with companies like Tencent, I like our chances that SOGO improves that number.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/history-small-search-companies-says-171823333.html"
If this doesn’t beat earnings we can all eat mr noodles the next 5 years together
"Sogue, Inc. will report its second quarter 2019 unaudited financial results on Monday, August 5, 2019, before U.S. market hours."
should I buy now?
Thankyou for sharing information to us. https://thebestfilletknife.com/
do you guys think SOGO will go up to $20 this week? thanks
"Reading the latest earning reports, Sogou's CEO mentioned that it added more authoritative content and deepened relationship with WeChat: ""In search, we bolstered our differentiated services in key verticals, such as healthcare, where we added more authoritative content, leading to a solid increase in related search queries and click through rate. We also deepened our partnership with WeChat by providing more search services such as our encyclopedia and interactive Q&A platform. Overall, our core search business maintained solid growth with revenues increasing by 45% year-over-year. During the quarter, we enhanced functionality of the Sogou Mobile Keyboard to better meet user needs for smart interaction and expression. Our AI-powered innovations drove broader adoption of the Sogou Mobile Keyboard, with DAU increasing by 36% year-on-year to 380 million in the second quarter.""It would not be surprising that sooner or later Tencent's WeChat will integrate Sogou search deeper into the WeChat ecosystem. Afterall Tencent owns majority of Sogou's shares.Target price: $17."
Rising with good volume. Fundamental growth and profitability are looking strong. Higher rating at stockFA. On watch for clear above 13.25.
"The big negative appears to be the cost of acquiring traffic increase caused by price inflation due to increased competition. Yet, SOGO still beat ..growing some 40% YOY. So while I get why those increased revenue cost would be a concern, the fact that SOGO absorbed them and continued to grow in line with previous qtrs says something too, which seems to be getting overlooked entirely in this premarket. As I said previously, it’s as though this market is looking for SOGO to fail and any excuse they’ll drive it lower. In any case, I feel there’s enough positives in SOGO that there’s no need to panick, so I’ll be watching to see how it plays out for a bit here..."

Thanks for the great 900 share at $12.45
"TD Ameritrade's ""New Constructs"" evaluation team just rated SOGO a strong buy after it came out with the AI news and its recent growth and positive outlook.From talks I have had with others in the tech industry, AI is the new up and coming. It is wise to get in early and weather the storms for future long term growth/goals."
"Isaac Newton was one of the three greatest minds in recorded history, the other two being Albert Einstein and Srinivasa Ramanujan. Newton's first law states(paraphrased) that an object will remain at rest until acted upon by an outside force, i.e. a delta. What are the 3 most important/imminent potential deltas here? First, progress on US/China trade impasse. While ultimate resolution is far in the future, any progress is a delta to SOGO. Second, company internal progress, either already happened or projected. Earnings conference call in several weeks provides a timeline. Third, indications of additional corporate ownership/joint venture initiatives. Any of these deltas will induce increased urge to own with the resultant unit price movement. Just waiting for the delta. Barring the zombie apocalypse, good support at $4.90 to $5.10."
Down 17% in one month on no news...most likely a buy. This is a company that signed a 5 year deal with tencent/wechat/qq and is sitting on their cards until trade deal settles.
"Hello! hello hello hello. Echo! echo echo. All I can report is that the stock is no longer tradeable on Robinhood for some reason. I can't even sell what I have, not that I would but its still very strange."
