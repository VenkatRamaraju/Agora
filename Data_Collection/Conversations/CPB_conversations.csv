"The market is behaving as if the supply chain disruptions will only affect consumer staples. Today P&G mentions that it's ""not immune"" from the supply chain challenges, and the entire sector goes into the crapper. Who is more vulnerable to the supply chain: somebody who puts a few basic ingredients into a can or some gizmo with thousands of components with need to make their way across oceans and continents? And when the recession hits, will it be the gizmos or cans that will continue to be bought?"
"cpb has biggest loss % in my portfolio. i never thought i could lose my shirt over soup. i hold all kinds of companies, including speculative ones, ones with no earnings, - and i am losing on soup. it's a little upsetting."
4% yield at $37
"i'm weighing whether i should sell my shares in CPB and buy 30,000 rolls of toilet paper instead. the price of toilet paper has appreciated much more than cpb over the past 5 years. i figure i'll store it in the basement and then sell it in another 5 years on ebay. plus i have the peace of mind knowing i will never have to use my hand ..."
"No matter how rough it gets.Y`all count on me to grab Snyder`s snack and Chunky Soup when I go to the store.I got cold feet about the stock.If It breaks $40, then what?"
Gary I just read about someone investing 8k in $SHIB 400 days ago which is now wort $5 billion. Best trade in human history! Just cell all CPB and ride the momo train to success!

i am now more convinced than ever that CPB needs to invest in cannabis.

Spooning it up at these prices.
"David, it's almost like you have animosity towards the stock. It has no desire to hurt you, but it doesn't want to help you either. It y itdoesn't know you exist. I don't want to see it go down any more than you do, but either someone has info we don't have or it's in a category that's selling off mostly irrationally. You've gotta believe what you believe. I believe it will be higher 1-2 years from now, at least relative to the market. On the other hand, the whole market may crash the way things are going, so there's that."
but and hold ..... ? better off buying and holding the soup than the stock ..at least you'll have something to eat
"Those who rely on the market to provide immediate gratification will regret it. There is something that the market knows about food stocks in general and CPB in particular. Nevertheless, this company will not go out of business in our lifetimes and it has a moat. I believe it's worth more than the market today is giving it credit for."
Getting cheaper by the week. Oh now!
"And now, to bolster sales amid the easing pandemic, the company has announced several new product initiatives, including the launch of more plant-based products. ""Our new items focus on new occasions and relevant wellness trends,"" CEO Mark Clouse told investors on a recent conference call. plant based? not sure what they are thinking of? CBD soup? chicken-weed noodle? hasish chowder? reefer vegetable? now you're talking ..."
