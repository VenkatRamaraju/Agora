"fwiw: analysts have no use for CPB. seeing 3 sell's right now. good fortune to ya' going forward. will jump to 43, and maybe 8/24. if you're using the option chain that could work out. that's for you to figure out."

"selling ""bolthouse."" really, that's the best they could do. fiscally, probably would have made more sense to keep it and cut back on ""bolthouse"" offerings. if i were long CPB i'd be taking a long, hard look at that 3.5 % dividend. think about it."
"PE less than 13, yield over 3.5%, dividend coverage over 200%--what's not to like about that?"
"I am buying in when the market opens. Just went to the store and bought 80 cans of different CPB soup. Most of there soup of Tomato, chicken noodle and cream of mushroom was sold out within 2 or 3 daysI HATE off brand soup and won't buy it. Nothing is better then Campbells. Walmart brand SUCKS."
Looks like we got a beat!!!! Congratulations to all CPB longs- no sale today! Buy while you can …
"Dan Loeb and the slightly tweaked board are looking to prune the non-core units, thus reducing their on-going debt significantly, their expanded snack division is doing quite well and I'll take the dividend into the summer/fall while watching this return to the low $40 range."

"BUY! There are a few stocks during this sell off that are attractive buys even at these prices, but CPB is probably my top pick. The upside in the short term is 15-20% and that’s being conservative. Especially after earnings. This will also benefit greatly from the upcoming second wave. Doubt we’ll see this opportunity for CPB again."
Need to get rid of this CEO and upper management ASAP.. They don't care about stock holder and don't know how to run this company....
"And now, to bolster sales amid the easing pandemic, the company has announced several new product initiatives, including the launch of more plant-based products. ""Our new items focus on new occasions and relevant wellness trends,"" CEO Mark Clouse told investors on a recent conference call. plant based? not sure what they are thinking of? CBD soup? chicken-weed noodle? hasish chowder? reefer vegetable? now you're talking ..."
"I bought more CPB at 35 even though soup sales were sluggish. I am a dividend investor - relatively young retiree, living off dividend income. I believe the Campbell brand will be here in 30 years and I like the safety of a powerful brand. The world is very populated and not everyone is rich. Campbells Soup is a great way to feed those kids and make them happy! Hopefully we will see some type of windfall with a Kraft take-over."
"i want to hear about thier new product initiatives .. ceo say they are coming. .. competition for aisle space is fierce, so i want to see what they are targeting. gis & k has outperpermed cpb by a mile ... i may have to take my losses if this does not turnaround soon .... we may be seeing ""going out of business"" signs on their soup cans ..."
"I think a second wave of covid is coming and that it could spark a stockpiling, pantry-loading 2.0. Should help stocks like Campbell soup. Also, the eat-at-home theme should stay for a while and it should help this stock and give it good 2019 comparables. It should be very safe and it looks good in this environnement. I don't own it, but I would like to buy if it drops again today."
"This is a perfect stock to own in times like this. Price has hardly moved since the beginning of Coronavirus, pays a nice well supported dividend that has been consistently raised, etc. Food processing stocks such as this, General Mills, Kellogg, Hershey, and Hormel and Archer Daniels Midland will all keep your portfolio slightly up to flat while the market tanks."
"General sentiment is correct, but if you dont have the wherewithal to buy a couple hundred shares....then you shouldn't be in the market at all."
"So the analysts are saying, CPB only did good because of Covid, and now they are going to do bad because of Covid going away. So, no appreciation ever for any reason. TSLA will never make as much money per share as CPB!! I actually did the math on TSLA market cap last night. It is higher than AT&T, Ford, GM, ADM and XOM all combined. Really! It is a joke."
"with global warming CPB needs to diversify even more away from soup. who wants soup when it's 100 degrees outside? i am down 15% in my investment. GIS & K investments doing much better. maybe CPB can put a 3-course meal in a can. the top layer can be the appetizer, the second layer the meal, and the last layer dessert."
"If you’re a day trader, you should definitely check out (http://Fairstox.com). They send a watchlist covering the top pre-market movers every day before the open. It’s a great way to pick out potential trades for the day."
CPB is all soup and no beef. It's the MSG in it that gives you the headache as is its trending down stock price.
Love cpb at these levels.
I’m pretty new to CPB but have owned HRL for a very long time. It’s interesting that CPB is much more optimistic about the future than HRL this morning.
Are earnings before bell or after bell tomorrow? Sorry couldn’t find after searching
"I’m just whining I guess, or thinking out loud. The question is what to do now, hold and hope, or sell and take the loss. Campbells is pure Americana, and I grew up just outside Camden. I wanna believe in this but watching the red number grow is depressing"
"farmers almanac says cold winter. cold winter=more soup sales. personally, though, gonna be making some home made soup more often this winter. the pictures on the cans always look appetizing on the outside, but i am typically disappointed with canned soup. some have an after taste as well. soup is easy to make. just get some chicken broth and cut up some fresh vegetables and boil. sometimes buy a pre-cooked roasted chicken and add in the meat. tastes real good."
Bought a bunch near close and after hours.Someone below commented that they authorized a $250m buyback. Can anyone verify?
"CPB will do stocks buy back soon ..Very profitable company ,stock should be $80/sh"
"Wow, markets all green again, cpb tanks again, getting tired of this movie, always the same ending #$%$"
"I don't understand (well understand but do not accept as reasonable) the concept of a stock being ""boring"". Is Campbell Soup your friend or spouse? Is it a movie or a sporting event? There is only one reason to care about the vast majority of stocks: to make money. The company's products can be exciting or boring to someone, but if you look for ""excitement"" start trading in AMC or GME that are basically entertainment vehicles."
"All I heard for years was how great a CEO Denise Morrison was, and now she abruptly resigns. What gives?"
"I think Wall St. has CPB wrong, their Debt is now less than 4X operating income and Net Interest payments will be $190M per year down from $356M in 2019. Management has also authorized 5.5% of shares outstanding to be bought back and CPB is throwing off a 3.5% dividend. That's a 9% shareholder yield!!! This is a slow grower but 10X operating earnings is too cheap for a company who consistently posts 15% operating margins! I'm hammering the buy button under $45 all day stick this one in your coffee can and check back in a decade!!!"
The upcoming earning report may be my get out of jail of a stock.
What has triggered the drop in recent weeks? I can't see to find any specific headlines except for the earnings miss almost two month ago?
"New Poster Here caught up in gamestop stock like everyone else was looking at other winning stocks today saw Cambell's as a big winner probably a lot of you might be surprised like me to see it move. Campbell's BG Foods, Hormel , Conagra, Kellogg's , Kraft Heinz all up today on a 665 point Dow Down day. Three reasons we might be seeing the surge is 1) Food, Healthcare (not insurance or Biotech) but Hospitals, drugs, surgeries are not as economically sensitive as tech and are the last things generally to be cut back in a bad economy so cash flow stays pretty constant. 2) people may be looking for income. All the above mentioned stocks at least pay a 2% dividend or higher BG Foods is around 6% and Campbell's just under 3% which is pretty good in an economy that is forcing rates down so government can loan more money at cheaper rates so CDs and savings get you nothing not even enough to cover living expense increases 3) There is lots of short interest in many of these old stable, big cap dividend paying companies. Many holders are retirees who will hold no matter what as a result whether the market is ups at new highs or takes tumbles like today. to short the shares has a very low margin and they can all get a decent move if they miss or beat their earnings expectations every quarter so if they miss a short can generally get a couple of quick bucks but not the worry of a short squeeze if they miss and if they have to hold the maintenance is low unlike what we have been seeing in Gamestop AMC Cruise Ships, Airlines and Rental Car companies over the last nine months. Plus with the low turn over most brokerage companies can lend short shares out without fears of usually having a big run in the shares (unless there is a buyout and short cover spike) so they can easily get them for their clients. I trade through etrade and in the research area under fundamentals , if I am reading it correctly as of the end of last quarter or the last update on the etrade under fundamentals it shows the short interest in Campbell's to be 12.56% though this number could be different by now I am not sure how current that number is if it is as of the last 15 day update, last quarter, or last year's annual update, BG foods was 30%.. With all the hawking going on with short bashing some people may be looking for higher shorted companies to look at. BG Foods BGS had three massive spikes. Don't know if 12% is considered a lot but for what some on the site call an old stable food company it seems like a lot. However, Campbell's has a lot going for it. Good Management, fairly consistent earnings, pays a nice dividend and has weathered many many economic downturns and is still going. I bought a few as a defense against a market downturn but there are other reasons to buy it. Good luck everyone."
"CPB is ripe for a Merger or Acquisition , and its just a matter of time . Good Economy , or bad , a can of soup is affordable for all ."
How do we explain a 3.65 percent decline after the announcement ?
I’m glad I sold this a few months ago after it tanked. Wow where is the bottom???
Adding in the am
hoping for a dip to the 41s then I'm in with long Leaps and cc's to generate some weekly income.
Where is this a true value buy? $36? $40. $10. Thoughts?
but and hold ..... ? better off buying and holding the soup than the stock ..at least you'll have something to eat
hopefully someone puts this on wsb
Pepridge Farms cookies and hot dog/burger buns at the tailgate with Heinz musty
Plus ..Rampant Inflation eroding companies margins! No way they can pass all these increased costs on to consumers.
Going up!
"sky falling, please sell out. thank you."
Adding
Good earnings. Good management. Just buy a few shares at this price and hold.
"add jm smucker to the list today ...please, just wait untill after earnings, then buy on the dip. There has yet to be ONE food conglomerate company that has come out with positive guidance this quarter. I'm hoping for $36 to solidify my position. and ride it back up to 45 with the 4% div."
3.7% yield if it drops below $40
All right…. I’m long now….. let’s go ahead with a buyout with either Nestle or Berkshire….. first in at $45 can have my shares.
wow No one comments in this board even when the stock is going up. Any thoughts?
Great time to buy on this dip in my opinion. Solid company and so much upside
spaghetti-o's .....that looks pretty gross ..... can they do better? for gosh sakes ... cpb needs to refresh some of its product lines. how 'bout canned stews and meals you can put over rice or noodles? not much innovation here -
"with 4% yield and years lowest prices, its such a bargin to buy this dip"
Campbells Board of directors has phone solicitation for all the stock they can get voted their way. they have called me 3 different times for me to change my 500 share vote I place with 3rd point. they must be desperate for calling over a measly 500 shares..
will earnings improve?
don't be scared weak hands. this stock is tremendously undervalued and the company is only continuing to grow.
4% yield at $37
"the summary page of this stock on yahoo finance says the stock is ""undervalued"" with a 17% estimated return."
"Just talked with my sysco rep, who said that campbells sent them a letter this morning that they would not be shipping any foodservice soups for 6 to 8 weeks due to labor shortage...."
Our family discovered the V8 +ENERGY drinks. Now buying 4-6packs a week.
"The market is behaving as if the supply chain disruptions will only affect consumer staples. Today P&G mentions that it's ""not immune"" from the supply chain challenges, and the entire sector goes into the crapper. Who is more vulnerable to the supply chain: somebody who puts a few basic ingredients into a can or some gizmo with thousands of components with need to make their way across oceans and continents? And when the recession hits, will it be the gizmos or cans that will continue to be bought?"
"cpb has biggest loss % in my portfolio. i never thought i could lose my shirt over soup. i hold all kinds of companies, including speculative ones, ones with no earnings, - and i am losing on soup. it's a little upsetting."
any predictions for what the bottom will be?
Solid brand for long term value investors.
"I got out when it rose a bit after the earning report. CPB will stay depressed until the soup line forms in the next depression. Five year ago the price was above $60. Take your dividend lousy useless ""long term hold"" CPB. Fake ""safety"" stock. Good bye and good ridden!"
"i'm weighing whether i should sell my shares in CPB and buy 30,000 rolls of toilet paper instead. the price of toilet paper has appreciated much more than cpb over the past 5 years. i figure i'll store it in the basement and then sell it in another 5 years on ebay. plus i have the peace of mind knowing i will never have to use my hand ..."
Adding more tomorrow. Will end up with 130 shares and let it ride until death us do part.
"Well I'm in for the first time, bought some yesterday at 42.01 and doubled it today at 41.06. It's now one of my largest positions as I really like the dividend yield, free cash flow numbers, and continuous debt reduction. Piper has just discovered that CPB is affected by commodity inflation? And the stock falls on that? Captain Obvious to the rescue! I think in times of inflation this is the type of stock you want to own as opposed to sell."
"I bought CPB at 44, but it looks like a huge mistake. It is going to take a lot just to get back to even. I guess I will just collect dividends until they get their act together."
I will go get and eat a can of Campbell soup to break this share price down trend. CPB is getting slaughtered along with the market; CPB is down regardless if the market is up or down.
"Those who rely on the market to provide immediate gratification will regret it. There is something that the market knows about food stocks in general and CPB in particular. Nevertheless, this company will not go out of business in our lifetimes and it has a moat. I believe it's worth more than the market today is giving it credit for."
Amazon should take over...
Under 40! Oh nelly
"as it goes down, I buy on sale."
"The options tell the story.. lots of calls being bought in 53-57 range. They pushed it down in early trade to get a decent price for them. Seen this a million times. Earnings will be great, 8-10% pop from there."
"As a retired grocer, I like CPB as a long term investment at this level. With dividend increase, yield now over 3% again, sales and profits beat expectations and nicely up over LY. Supermarket sales seem to be running at about +10% same store on a nationwide level, and I believe that even after the virus is gone people will be eating at home more than pre-virus times."
"While the soup business is a drag on this company, historically the stock goes up after 1st quarter results. I believe that it is because many people use the cream soups for cooking. There could be a big uptick after the 1st quarter. The snack and bakery businesses are booming and Snyder/Lance is profitable. Not sure how the carrot business did.....I did not hear of any major issues. I am sitting on the sidelines until closer to the reporting date/ I want to see if the price warrants an investment. At $34 or above I believe it would be too expensive. After earnings, it would leave my portfolio."
Gary I just read about someone investing 8k in $SHIB 400 days ago which is now wort $5 billion. Best trade in human history! Just cell all CPB and ride the momo train to success!
Walmart agreement did not go through I think.
Yes been such a great and easy short Really sub par management
"I'm happy,! Bought with Lance monies below $39 (plus a new car for holding on to Lance when everyone sold at $15.00! crackers and soup for the long term and the dividend!gonna follow my same plan called long term investing, no in and out broker fees."
Interesting. They are buying back $500MM in stock yet raising prices because of inflation. Hmmmm....
"David, it's almost like you have animosity towards the stock. It has no desire to hurt you, but it doesn't want to help you either. It y itdoesn't know you exist. I don't want to see it go down any more than you do, but either someone has info we don't have or it's in a category that's selling off mostly irrationally. You've gotta believe what you believe. I believe it will be higher 1-2 years from now, at least relative to the market. On the other hand, the whole market may crash the way things are going, so there's that."
Don't forget it is at 8:20am tomorrow!! https://conferencecalltranscripts.com/summary/?id=285354&pr=true
The problem with this company is: horrible balance sheet…. They either need to raise cash or cut their dividends.
I will have to eat Campbell Soup if the share price keep trending down.
What a beautiful stock!
"Lots of shorts on this page. Personally, I’ll take the 3.6% yield"
"I'm long the stock, but really could use a pull back tomorrow to get below $42.50 to not have to roll my cc's...hope to see that..."
What will the price be tomorrow?
Everyone is gonna add at $40? Why not just wait until it gets to $30
"If you’re looking for a short and sweet guide to the day’s biggest news, I recommend (http://Pick-stocks.com). They breakdown the most important pre-market news and it only takes a few minutes to read."
"zacks actually spells things out pretty good for cpb ... cheap for a reason - growth sluggish compared to peers. so it could be a value trap, unless they are able to turn things around. they need exciting new products. they need to grow. that is not easy to do when competition is fierce. watch for new products from cpb - point the out on the board. there is also a possibility they acquire some products from other smaller up and coming companies, which isn't a bad idea considering cpb has good cash flow .."
Anyone know what’s dropping the stock?
Gonna be rough times ahead for CPB and all banners under them for a long long while!
"can it break 40,sell to open, ITM buy/write, and then lather/rinse/repeat. you're welcome."
Gonna be a big beat ahead for CPB and all of their brands for the rest of time.
"I wonder how many people are thinking of filling up their cupboards with soups, comfort foods and other campbell products as this virus begins to threaten the world? I wonder how many other countries are seeing runs on these sorts of goods? IMHO, we could see an unexpected increase in earnings this quarter and a small increase in guidance going forward. Time will tell..."
Earnings are coming out. They are out of Cream of Onion in Wisconsin at certain locations. Bought today.
i am now more convinced than ever that CPB needs to invest in cannabis.
Any thoughts on it getting below 41.00?
"Earning beat...this is my get out of jail card. My breakeven is $43.75. CPB dropped 13% while S&P500 went up a lot this year. CPB went down from $62 since Jan, 2017. CPB gives a perception of a safe stock but the reality says it is a trap for lost of opportunity to make money elsewhere. Put money under the mattress would have done better!"
So they’re buying back stock to make the earnings look better . Couldn’t that money be used in a more productive manner? It’s called voodoo economics.
cheap shares at a discount. thanks weak hands for helping others buy low.
Getting cheaper by the week. Oh now!
"I was looking at buying shares in Campbell Soup Co. last summer. They have some really great brands. Didn't pull the trigger to buy and watched stock go up modestly over months. With pandemic/stay-at-home and lots of food service going out of business soon, I like Campbell a lot now, but I'm still wondering if this is really the right stock to own long term. It's still basically a low margin, slow grower packaged food biz. My question is, do you think the ""long term"" picture here has changed positively, or is it just an temporary uptick for the coming quarters or at most few years?"
"If CPB was called ""Campbell Snack Company"", the P/E would be double what it is today..."
"I am thinking that food is very competitive business with very narrow moat now days . Should I investment in CPB ? Anybody please , thanks in advance."
CPB doesn't seem to have much cash and quite a lot of debt.
i looked on cpb company website and their products just aren't that enticing. i would say their soup actually stands out compared to many of their other products. cpb needs an overhaul. maybe they should get into hemp. how 'bout hash-tag brownies? how's that for marketing? or another possibility is a meal in a can. for example beef strogonoff or beef stew. you prepare the noodles or rice and just add in the meal from the can. people want easy to prepare meals. maybe i should email the company ... they need some guidance ..but first i will have a brownie or two...
Looks like will go up a little every week until it get close to $50....
"Limit order set for $40 at open, but will trigger for much less …"
Easy buy here for a 4% yield
Spooning it up at these prices.
Two Words: Comfort Food
this company needs more product innovation. .. soup is boring ....
"How well can CPB hold up in an inflationary environment?Producing higher quality product, may make it difficult for CPB to cut costs vs. cheaper brand competition?Everytime I go into a grocery store I look for bargains."
"In my two cents the only strategy CPB is lacking emerging market expansion. If they do that they will have time to correct money , so much money will pour in ."
"The ""Risk-off"" ""Kitchen stocks"" like CPB and MKC are back! It's a reflection of the sentiment of the economy, Covid resurgent and now the take over by the Taliban. As a nation, we need to come together and put U.S. first or we will fall apart sooner than we think. Shame on the leaders at all levels who sold this country out for personal gains."
Nice drop. Time to buy.
"No matter how rough it gets.Y`all count on me to grab Snyder`s snack and Chunky Soup when I go to the store.I got cold feet about the stock.If It breaks $40, then what?"
40 will be loading up the truck.
Earnings beat.. reported 0.83 EPS. Robinhood is faster than yahoo finance some times
Will add more under $40
"I've owned SJM for 15 years. Cost basis: pretty much the same as CPB today. That puts the day-to-day fluctuations in perspective. What you want from this type of stock is three thing: no chance of going bankrupt, high free cash flow, and high return on equity. For the rest, just give it time."
CPB is soup alright.
disappointed with the reaction ...but still like CPB ... and i am hoping for a merger in the space ... CPB seems to be right size to be taken out ...and consolidation leads to synergies and resultant cost savings .... give it a year ...
"I wanted to grow my own food, but I can’t find bacon seeds."
Under 41…. Let’s see 40…. Still adding
Buyer under $40…
"so far i made enough on cpb to buy 8 cans of soup, provided they are on sale. not bad, folks. plus i get paid that nice dividend. hey, beats a CD paying 0.1 %"
"Watch for the housing bubble to burst this fall. Many people have purchased homes, which they could not afford in the first place. The cracks are starting to form in the housing market. Again, due to hard times, people will resort to eating soup to survive."
Mr. Market giving the boys an unreal deal on $CPB!!! Very hard to imagine a scenario where CPB doesn't give shareholders a double digit return for the next few years!
Very confused by Zacks articles. They were touting this stock big time on June 4 and now are on a constant beat down. Inflation will hit every corner of this economy and we will just have to pony up more. Campbell will up their prices or reduce the product size just as all companies have done in the past. If anything people will buy more soup as they are more economical than other foods. This company is recession proof.
"So there is rumor of a bidding war for the International business. Looking at the financials, Campbell must get $3.5B for the international and $1.5B forth Fresh unit. With $8B in debt, this company needs to get a total of at least $5B to get there debt in line. The amount of money spent paying interest is a major headwind and with the Fed increasing rates it is putting a lot of pressure on this stock. The me shrinking which is another reason a sale must be completed quickly. I believe the stock will stay in the range of mid-34 to mid-35. With a good quarter it may go higher, but eventually come back down due to fundamentals. Once the sale is finalized, the stock will rise on rumors of the company being sold. Will it be sold? It depends upon how successful the leadership is in implementing their plan."
"I just saw the Smucker's interview (family)... he acknowledges post-CoVid startup COGS & D&A increases... all temporary, manageable & pipeline-related... Soup is ""simpler""... especially for ""professionally managed CPB""... ;)"
"When those federal unemployment checks end and eviction moratorium ends, watch out for hard times. People will resort to eating soup."
Frustration is the market up 400+ and your stock up a penny.
"If tesla owned it, with all the misses, it would be in the 70s"
The stock is following S&P 500 with an offset and multiplier!
"thought this would be a safe stable bet, but down 10%. Rather than just the commotized cans and tetra pack soups people expect to get cheap, CPB should consider selling higher quality bone broth and fresher soup in the refrigerator or freezer section of the grocery stores."
"So if Kraft rumors are accurate what is a reasonable expectation range, $50-$55?"
This stock is like the last one pick for the team. You are stuck with a low performer.

Why oh why did I ever buy this stock?
"Hey Guys, do you thinks its worth buying today even if it opens at 40 dollars ? how likely do you guys think the buyout will happen? Thank you x"
Campbell Soup in talks to acquire Tesla
Buying tomorrow for $38-$39

Seems to me this could be a perfect value play.
Sale starts tomorrow
"Campbell Soup price target raised to $57 from $50 at Credit Suisse 07:15 CPB Credit Suisse analyst Robert Moskow raised the firm's price target on Campbell Soup to $57 from $50 and keeps a Neutral rating on the shares. The analyst notes that the spread of the COVID-19 virus has created an unprecedented spike in demand for grocery products as consumers prepare for weeks of school closures, work-from-home arrangements, and reduced access to restaurants. His view is that this represents a shift in food consumption demand, not just a pull-forward, because consumers will need to continuously restock their homes. Moskow expects food consumption to remain elevated over the next 12 months as consumers choose to keep eating food at-home to save money, much like they did during the last three economic recessions in 1990, 2001, and 2008."

I bought the dip today
