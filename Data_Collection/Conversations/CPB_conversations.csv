"I wanted to grow my own food, but I can’t find bacon seeds."
"Earning beat...this is my get out of jail card. My breakeven is $43.75. CPB dropped 13% while S&P500 went up a lot this year. CPB went down from $62 since Jan, 2017. CPB gives a perception of a safe stock but the reality says it is a trap for lost of opportunity to make money elsewhere. Put money under the mattress would have done better!"
Let’s gooooooo...beautiful stock! 
Joe evicted me today :(. But he going to send $100 so it’s even right? I’m buying 0.10 $CPB stocks and the rest on cold hotdogs and a Ross blanket for my new home my car
3.7% yield if it drops below $40
"I thought management was to do what was best for stockholders, apparently not."
"It appears the gap down is going to fill. at least some. I certainly think $35 is obtainable too, and mostly like reach $37 using technicals, but when you add fundamentals, this seems to be the fly in the buttermilk.. They say, trend is your friend, this equity is certainly not over valued.and trend is beginning to go up.."
Here we go time to start the run up
"While the soup business is a drag on this company, historically the stock goes up after 1st quarter results. I believe that it is because many people use the cream soups for cooking. There could be a big uptick after the 1st quarter. The snack and bakery businesses are booming and Snyder/Lance is profitable. Not sure how the carrot business did.....I did not hear of any major issues. I am sitting on the sidelines until closer to the reporting date/ I want to see if the price warrants an investment. At $34 or above I believe it would be too expensive. After earnings, it would leave my portfolio."
spaghetti-o's .....that looks pretty gross ..... can they do better? for gosh sakes ... cpb needs to refresh some of its product lines. how 'bout canned stews and meals you can put over rice or noodles? not much innovation here -
What will the price be tomorrow?
Mr. Market giving the boys an unreal deal on $CPB!!! Very hard to imagine a scenario where CPB doesn't give shareholders a double digit return for the next few years!
Nice drop. Time to buy.
"Well I'm in for the first time, bought some yesterday at 42.01 and doubled it today at 41.06. It's now one of my largest positions as I really like the dividend yield, free cash flow numbers, and continuous debt reduction. Piper has just discovered that CPB is affected by commodity inflation? And the stock falls on that? Captain Obvious to the rescue! I think in times of inflation this is the type of stock you want to own as opposed to sell."
"While there have been many gaffs by this CEO, the company was trying to get into niche markets, i.e. organics. Unfortunately, they do not have the knowledge to run these companies. The straw that broke her back was the Lance acquisition. Over paid and too much debt. This is stock will stay in the low 40's once it rebounds."
Keep buying. Nice drop for investors
Looks like we got a beat!!!! Congratulations to all CPB longs- no sale today! Buy while you can …
"The CPB stock is starting to look like a good value with a nice dividend of about 3.5%. I have not bought into it yet but it appears from the past lows, the stock will move under $40 a share. Is it worth getting in under 40 and is there be any business plan by the company’s management to improve the stock value? I’m very much a newbee investor and would appreciate input. Have a nice day."
Not everyone is rich. People struggle to feed their families. It can get expensive. Kids get very hungry. Campbell's Soup is the answer. iconic brand which is here to stay.
"New Poster Here caught up in gamestop stock like everyone else was looking at other winning stocks today saw Cambell's as a big winner probably a lot of you might be surprised like me to see it move. Campbell's BG Foods, Hormel , Conagra, Kellogg's , Kraft Heinz all up today on a 665 point Dow Down day. Three reasons we might be seeing the surge is 1) Food, Healthcare (not insurance or Biotech) but Hospitals, drugs, surgeries are not as economically sensitive as tech and are the last things generally to be cut back in a bad economy so cash flow stays pretty constant. 2) people may be looking for income. All the above mentioned stocks at least pay a 2% dividend or higher BG Foods is around 6% and Campbell's just under 3% which is pretty good in an economy that is forcing rates down so government can loan more money at cheaper rates so CDs and savings get you nothing not even enough to cover living expense increases 3) There is lots of short interest in many of these old stable, big cap dividend paying companies. Many holders are retirees who will hold no matter what as a result whether the market is ups at new highs or takes tumbles like today. to short the shares has a very low margin and they can all get a decent move if they miss or beat their earnings expectations every quarter so if they miss a short can generally get a couple of quick bucks but not the worry of a short squeeze if they miss and if they have to hold the maintenance is low unlike what we have been seeing in Gamestop AMC Cruise Ships, Airlines and Rental Car companies over the last nine months. Plus with the low turn over most brokerage companies can lend short shares out without fears of usually having a big run in the shares (unless there is a buyout and short cover spike) so they can easily get them for their clients. I trade through etrade and in the research area under fundamentals , if I am reading it correctly as of the end of last quarter or the last update on the etrade under fundamentals it shows the short interest in Campbell's to be 12.56% though this number could be different by now I am not sure how current that number is if it is as of the last 15 day update, last quarter, or last year's annual update, BG foods was 30%.. With all the hawking going on with short bashing some people may be looking for higher shorted companies to look at. BG Foods BGS had three massive spikes. Don't know if 12% is considered a lot but for what some on the site call an old stable food company it seems like a lot. However, Campbell's has a lot going for it. Good Management, fairly consistent earnings, pays a nice dividend and has weathered many many economic downturns and is still going. I bought a few as a defense against a market downturn but there are other reasons to buy it. Good luck everyone."
soup will be flying off the shelves when the cooler weather comes ...but everyone keeps buying internet and tech high flyers ... i will go with the soup ....
"Just talked with my sysco rep, who said that campbells sent them a letter this morning that they would not be shipping any foodservice soups for 6 to 8 weeks due to labor shortage...."
Gonna be a big beat ahead for CPB and all of their brands for the rest of time.
"CPB is about to crush earnings!! It’s crazy that people have been sleeping on this stock because it’s not as exciting as zoom and Tesla but the upside here is major. This was over $57 in March which it will return to, so that’s already 10% "
Shhhh…. Keep adding while everyone is sleeping….
"In my two cents the only strategy CPB is lacking emerging market expansion. If they do that they will have time to correct money , so much money will pour in ."
"PE less than 13, yield over 3.5%, dividend coverage over 200%--what's not to like about that?"
Bought at $43.29
"Just keep selling cc's good for about .4-.5% a week 1-2 strikes out...I've got $43 CSP that looks like it will get assigned, but I've booked premium to get my cost to about $41.22 so I'm up and will sell $43.50 cc's then $44 then $45 as it goes up and keep the stock...good buy here I think, will pop a little bit tomorrow or tick back up by close (hopefully)"
"This is a perfect stock to own in times like this. Price has hardly moved since the beginning of Coronavirus, pays a nice well supported dividend that has been consistently raised, etc. Food processing stocks such as this, General Mills, Kellogg, Hershey, and Hormel and Archer Daniels Midland will all keep your portfolio slightly up to flat while the market tanks."
"Lost over 13% yeay to date ..CEO and upper managements, stick your dividend in your A..."
Where is this a true value buy? $36? $40. $10. Thoughts?
I’m pretty new to CPB but have owned HRL for a very long time. It’s interesting that CPB is much more optimistic about the future than HRL this morning.
@ sandi. MSG is a flavor enhancer. Makes Campbell Soup taste M m good.....
Adding more tomorrow. Will end up with 130 shares and let it ride until death us do part.
Seems to me this could be a perfect value play.
"I was looking at buying shares in Campbell Soup Co. last summer. They have some really great brands. Didn't pull the trigger to buy and watched stock go up modestly over months. With pandemic/stay-at-home and lots of food service going out of business soon, I like Campbell a lot now, but I'm still wondering if this is really the right stock to own long term. It's still basically a low margin, slow grower packaged food biz. My question is, do you think the ""long term"" picture here has changed positively, or is it just an temporary uptick for the coming quarters or at most few years?"
Are earnings before bell or after bell tomorrow? Sorry couldn’t find after searching
hoping for a dip to the 41s then I'm in with long Leaps and cc's to generate some weekly income.
I bought the dip today
"General sentiment is correct, but if you dont have the wherewithal to buy a couple hundred shares....then you shouldn't be in the market at all."
Deteriorating fundamentals. I don't like this.
I love buying brand name turn arounds that pay a great divvy. When they collapse 60% buy !
Gonna be rough times ahead for CPB and all banners under them for a long long while!
campbell soup is all everyone will be eating when the next recession hits
"When those federal unemployment checks end and eviction moratorium ends, watch out for hard times. People will resort to eating soup."
"I'm happy,! Bought with Lance monies below $39 (plus a new car for holding on to Lance when everyone sold at $15.00! crackers and soup for the long term and the dividend!gonna follow my same plan called long term investing, no in and out broker fees."
Mmmmm....Mmmmm......:
"So there is rumor of a bidding war for the International business. Looking at the financials, Campbell must get $3.5B for the international and $1.5B forth Fresh unit. With $8B in debt, this company needs to get a total of at least $5B to get there debt in line. The amount of money spent paying interest is a major headwind and with the Fed increasing rates it is putting a lot of pressure on this stock. The me shrinking which is another reason a sale must be completed quickly. I believe the stock will stay in the range of mid-34 to mid-35. With a good quarter it may go higher, but eventually come back down due to fundamentals. Once the sale is finalized, the stock will rise on rumors of the company being sold. Will it be sold? It depends upon how successful the leadership is in implementing their plan."
Earnings beat.. reported 0.83 EPS. Robinhood is faster than yahoo finance some times
"CPB is ripe for a Merger or Acquisition , and its just a matter of time . Good Economy , or bad , a can of soup is affordable for all ."
"Dan Loeb and the slightly tweaked board are looking to prune the non-core units, thus reducing their on-going debt significantly, their expanded snack division is doing quite well and I'll take the dividend into the summer/fall while watching this return to the low $40 range."
"farmers almanac says cold winter. cold winter=more soup sales. personally, though, gonna be making some home made soup more often this winter. the pictures on the cans always look appetizing on the outside, but i am typically disappointed with canned soup. some have an after taste as well. soup is easy to make. just get some chicken broth and cut up some fresh vegetables and boil. sometimes buy a pre-cooked roasted chicken and add in the meat. tastes real good."
"I am thinking that food is very competitive business with very narrow moat now days . Should I investment in CPB ? Anybody please , thanks in advance."
"If tesla owned it, with all the misses, it would be in the 70s"
How do we explain a 3.65 percent decline after the announcement ?
"All I heard for years was how great a CEO Denise Morrison was, and now she abruptly resigns. What gives?"
Amazon should take over...
cheap shares at a discount. thanks weak hands for helping others buy low.
"Goldfish and Milano cookies, what's not to like?"
Going up!
It’s under $43.00… will it go to 40$… thanks shorty.
Sale starts tomorrow
i looked on cpb company website and their products just aren't that enticing. i would say their soup actually stands out compared to many of their other products. cpb needs an overhaul. maybe they should get into hemp. how 'bout hash-tag brownies? how's that for marketing? or another possibility is a meal in a can. for example beef strogonoff or beef stew. you prepare the noodles or rice and just add in the meal from the can. people want easy to prepare meals. maybe i should email the company ... they need some guidance ..but first i will have a brownie or two...
"Due to mass buying of customer fear, I believe Campbell soup and their line of products are gonna be an amazing investment"
apparently soup company doesn't care about higher interest rates. the stock actually went up today. apparently it is a flight to safety ..soup is safe
Very confident within six months we will see nice appreciation ACCUMULATION NOW IN PROGRESS BY SMART MONEY
"I bought CPB at 44, but it looks like a huge mistake. It is going to take a lot just to get back to even. I guess I will just collect dividends until they get their act together."
I'm in the house of pain with this one. Might as well wait a few days for earnings I guess...
Very confused by Zacks articles. They were touting this stock big time on June 4 and now are on a constant beat down. Inflation will hit every corner of this economy and we will just have to pony up more. Campbell will up their prices or reduce the product size just as all companies have done in the past. If anything people will buy more soup as they are more economical than other foods. This company is recession proof.
WOW someone purchased 6000 $38 puts for tomorrow. Someone must already have the earnings and forecast.
Here’s a clue walk in a grocery store/supermarket and observe. Then pick up most of their products and read the ingredients. Then go to your local public library and check out a book on nutrition. Better yet check out any book about what large clusters of the longest living people in the world eat.
Anyone know what’s dropping the stock?
Why oh why did I ever buy this stock?
Campbell Soup in talks to acquire Tesla
Plus ..Rampant Inflation eroding companies margins! No way they can pass all these increased costs on to consumers.
"I bought more CPB at 35 even though soup sales were sluggish. I am a dividend investor - relatively young retiree, living off dividend income. I believe the Campbell brand will be here in 30 years and I like the safety of a powerful brand. The world is very populated and not everyone is rich. Campbells Soup is a great way to feed those kids and make them happy! Hopefully we will see some type of windfall with a Kraft take-over."
"selling ""bolthouse."" really, that's the best they could do. fiscally, probably would have made more sense to keep it and cut back on ""bolthouse"" offerings. if i were long CPB i'd be taking a long, hard look at that 3.5 % dividend. think about it."
Good PE and dividend and sales will be soaring even after their pre-virus panic earnings beat and upgrades! Add the prospect of a takeover that is always present. What's not to like?
The problem with this company is: horrible balance sheet…. They either need to raise cash or cut their dividends.
I hope I can buy more under $45
What a beautiful opportunity to pick up a cheap 3% yield
"Is Allied Hyperion, adding to their position(as per Mike Wagner) a signal of more buying interest?"
What a beautiful stock!
wow No one comments in this board even when the stock is going up. Any thoughts?
Looks like a great deal at $34 and change.
"As a retired grocer, I like CPB as a long term investment at this level. With dividend increase, yield now over 3% again, sales and profits beat expectations and nicely up over LY. Supermarket sales seem to be running at about +10% same store on a nationwide level, and I believe that even after the virus is gone people will be eating at home more than pre-virus times."
Any thoughts on it getting below 41.00?
They can’t find over the road drivers to get the product to the independent operators of the snacks division . Logistics is a mess . No urgency by upper management . Many class action lawsuits by “independent business owners “ employed by CPB. They have a great product though . Just getting it from the bakery to the consumers mouths seems to be an issue .
"Campbell Soup price target raised to $57 from $50 at Credit Suisse 07:15 CPB Credit Suisse analyst Robert Moskow raised the firm's price target on Campbell Soup to $57 from $50 and keeps a Neutral rating on the shares. The analyst notes that the spread of the COVID-19 virus has created an unprecedented spike in demand for grocery products as consumers prepare for weeks of school closures, work-from-home arrangements, and reduced access to restaurants. His view is that this represents a shift in food consumption demand, not just a pull-forward, because consumers will need to continuously restock their homes. Moskow expects food consumption to remain elevated over the next 12 months as consumers choose to keep eating food at-home to save money, much like they did during the last three economic recessions in 1990, 2001, and 2008."
I guess market is so bad today has everyone thinking soup kitchens are coming back.
"How low will she go? Down 15% ($53.54 to $46.90) in four days... ouch! That means it's time to BUY, BUY, BUY!"
Looks like will go up a little every week until it get close to $50....
The upcoming earning report may be my get out of jail of a stock.
"""Kitchen"" stocks like CPB and MKC thrive in a bloody day!!"
"How well can CPB hold up in an inflationary environment?Producing higher quality product, may make it difficult for CPB to cut costs vs. cheaper brand competition?Everytime I go into a grocery store I look for bargains."
"At 8x earnings, this should be an obvious buy but l think it's just boring to the modern 'investor""."
"I got out when it rose a bit after the earning report. CPB will stay depressed until the soup line forms in the next depression. Five year ago the price was above $60. Take your dividend lousy useless ""long term hold"" CPB. Fake ""safety"" stock. Good bye and good ridden!"
"thought this would be a safe stable bet, but down 10%. Rather than just the commotized cans and tetra pack soups people expect to get cheap, CPB should consider selling higher quality bone broth and fresher soup in the refrigerator or freezer section of the grocery stores."
CPB doesn't seem to have much cash and quite a lot of debt.
don't be scared weak hands. this stock is tremendously undervalued and the company is only continuing to grow.
"I just saw the Smucker's interview (family)... he acknowledges post-CoVid startup COGS & D&A increases... all temporary, manageable & pipeline-related... Soup is ""simpler""... especially for ""professionally managed CPB""... ;)"
We are going to $35+ real soon!!! Strong Buy!!!
I am ready for this to go over $50. Any time would be great
If this thing goes up right before close; I’m buying into earnings
Good earnings. Good management. Just buy a few shares at this price and hold.
"Very common sense acquisition by kraft. Easy cost savings on corporate processes, warehouse delivery commonalities, overlap in advertising, and innovation, size leverage in procurement and with customers for better overall net pricing. Significant overlap for warehouse business. Question is what do you do with the DSD business. Perhaps it partners with Mondelez in a split bid to parcel off dsd."
Two Words: Comfort Food
this company needs more product innovation. .. soup is boring ....
"with global warming CPB needs to diversify even more away from soup. who wants soup when it's 100 degrees outside? i am down 15% in my investment. GIS & K investments doing much better. maybe CPB can put a 3-course meal in a can. the top layer can be the appetizer, the second layer the meal, and the last layer dessert."
"I wonder how many people are thinking of filling up their cupboards with soups, comfort foods and other campbell products as this virus begins to threaten the world? I wonder how many other countries are seeing runs on these sorts of goods? IMHO, we could see an unexpected increase in earnings this quarter and a small increase in guidance going forward. Time will tell..."
I have 2000 shares for sale at 45.74 if anyone is interested lmk
"As I stated before, the r for earnings was set very low. There have been leaks that the company would sell the fresh and Arnott's business. The surprise to me is that they are sell Kjelsen. That was purchased just a year or two ago and was supposed to be the gateway into China. I believe that the Chinese government would not allow CPB to sell in there. (Not really a market for soup there anyway) Now CPB needs to change their packaging; Milennials do not have the ability to add anything to prepare a meal. Also, they do not want cans....they are bad for the environment. CPB still has to change any other things in their products as well. The headwinds are still strong, but they have diminished with the announced changes. This stock will go up over time, but I do not foresee it reaching mid-40s until after the New Year."
I'm a young person who has a stock portfolio who's invested in 6 stocks including Campbell Soup. I hope this goes up. I'm betting on this!!! Follow my instagram @tyart360!
"put alert notice on CPB @ 33 and start accumulation. vote will end up in boards lap anyway. someone, somewhere in CPB's employ, not board member, will rise to the occasion and right ship."
"I think Wall St. has CPB wrong, their Debt is now less than 4X operating income and Net Interest payments will be $190M per year down from $356M in 2019. Management has also authorized 5.5% of shares outstanding to be bought back and CPB is throwing off a 3.5% dividend. That's a 9% shareholder yield!!! This is a slow grower but 10X operating earnings is too cheap for a company who consistently posts 15% operating margins! I'm hammering the buy button under $45 all day stick this one in your coffee can and check back in a decade!!!"
"so far i made enough on cpb to buy 8 cans of soup, provided they are on sale. not bad, folks. plus i get paid that nice dividend. hey, beats a CD paying 0.1 %"
Don't buy the false narrative...beat on profits and outlook of adjusted EPS remains unchanged. Good report! Going higher!
"add jm smucker to the list today ...please, just wait untill after earnings, then buy on the dip. There has yet to be ONE food conglomerate company that has come out with positive guidance this quarter. I'm hoping for $36 to solidify my position. and ride it back up to 45 with the 4% div."
https://go.trade-ideas.com/SHF9
"I've owned SJM for 15 years. Cost basis: pretty much the same as CPB today. That puts the day-to-day fluctuations in perspective. What you want from this type of stock is three thing: no chance of going bankrupt, high free cash flow, and high return on equity. For the rest, just give it time."
CPB is all soup and no beef. It's the MSG in it that gives you the headache as is its trending down stock price.
Adding in the am
Yes been such a great and easy short Really sub par management
"BUY! There are a few stocks during this sell off that are attractive buys even at these prices, but CPB is probably my top pick. The upside in the short term is 15-20% and that’s being conservative. Especially after earnings. This will also benefit greatly from the upcoming second wave. Doubt we’ll see this opportunity for CPB again."
I looked at a chart of Campbell's and it was higher in 1998. Anyone know the reason?
"I'm long the stock, but really could use a pull back tomorrow to get below $42.50 to not have to roll my cc's...hope to see that..."
"as it goes down, I buy on sale."
Great time to buy on this dip in my opinion. Solid company and so much upside
will earnings improve?
"Campbell began its downward spiral when they staffed the top management with individuals from P & G that knew absolutely nothing about making or marketing soup. When the Campbell was staffed with individuals that ""grew"" up with the company in the soup business, the company flourished and grew at a consistent and profitable pace."
Need to get rid of this CEO and upper management ASAP.. They don't care about stock holder and don't know how to run this company....
Walmart agreement did not go through I think.
Anyone know why this stock has been tanking the last two days? I can’t seem to find a reason
"Lots of shorts on this page. Personally, I’ll take the 3.6% yield"
One thing to know about the Campbell soups is that one can add zucchini to just about all of them and streach the meal. Unlike a lot of veggies it picks up the flavor of the soup and makes a great meal.
I love the frozen Pepperidge Farms cakes! Haven't had one in years. Have to pick one up before Loeb makes them extinct.
Interesting. They are buying back $500MM in stock yet raising prices because of inflation. Hmmmm....
"Good earnings. After the initial surge in the stock, I may be a buyer. Looks like there could be a lot of up side with this company."
"CPB along with a number of other companies need to realize that catering to the few that scream and yell about ""fresh"" and ""natural"" foods is such a tiny market with low margins its not worth the time and money to invest in getting it to market. Just get back to what they do best forget trying to get a market of perhaps 1-2% at best."
Cold morning I'm going to heat some soup.
This company has such a solid financial sheet. ~8 P/E ~5 EPS. Wow.
"It seems like this business is a family pride issue, where diplomacy would be tantamount. Could never image Loeb obtaining any control over it, given his vitriol nature, which they would quickly figure out via google. Mmm mmm bad."
Love cpb at these levels.
All stocks are overvalued.. 13 year bull market being propping up by government... Democratic leadership taking the country down a dark hole... the market collapse will be the least of our worries.
"Campbell Soup shares are trading higher after the company reported better-than-expected Q1 results and raised its quarterly dividend.Dec 9, 2020 7:42a ET"
All right…. I’m long now….. let’s go ahead with a buyout with either Nestle or Berkshire….. first in at $45 can have my shares.
"So if Kraft rumors are accurate what is a reasonable expectation range, $50-$55?"
I will have to eat Campbell Soup if the share price keep trending down.
will drop below 40
Buying tomorrow for $38-$39
"If you’re looking for a short and sweet guide to the day’s biggest news, I recommend (http://Pick-stocks.com). They breakdown the most important pre-market news and it only takes a few minutes to read."
I will go get and eat a can of Campbell soup to break this share price down trend. CPB is getting slaughtered along with the market; CPB is down regardless if the market is up or down.
Campbell Soup is up 4.98% to 48.90
I guess no one will buy goldfish crackers any more.
I picked up 34.54 I think this will rebound
disappointed with the reaction ...but still like CPB ... and i am hoping for a merger in the space ... CPB seems to be right size to be taken out ...and consolidation leads to synergies and resultant cost savings .... give it a year ...
What a SOUPer deal at these levels!!!
$CPB Target Lowered by Bank of America Underperform USD 45 » USD 42 Maintains Morgan Stanley Equal-Weight USD 48 » USD 46Target Lowered by RBC Capital Outperform USD 59 » USD 54 Target Lowered by Deutsche Bank Hold USD 50 » USD 48
We will see 55.00 per share by January next year with a possible dividend increase.
"Solid branded company. My favorite mushroom cream soup, modifiable for other tasty food recipes."
"Hey Guys, do you thinks its worth buying today even if it opens at 40 dollars ? how likely do you guys think the buyout will happen? Thank you x"
"The ""Risk-off"" ""Kitchen stocks"" like CPB and MKC are back! It's a reflection of the sentiment of the economy, Covid resurgent and now the take over by the Taliban. As a nation, we need to come together and put U.S. first or we will fall apart sooner than we think. Shame on the leaders at all levels who sold this country out for personal gains."
"The options tell the story.. lots of calls being bought in 53-57 range. They pushed it down in early trade to get a decent price for them. Seen this a million times. Earnings will be great, 8-10% pop from there."

bought more today
Beat on top and bottom lines! Now need to get a positive forward Outlook
Back in 44.83 x 1000 what in the world is going on here???
"Yes, a can of their soup is a 'thin gruel' compared to what it used to be like when I was a kid. Increasing the price and lowering the quality at the same time eventually catches up with you."
"fwiw: analysts have no use for CPB. seeing 3 sell's right now. good fortune to ya' going forward. will jump to 43, and maybe 8/24. if you're using the option chain that could work out. that's for you to figure out."
What has triggered the drop in recent weeks? I can't see to find any specific headlines except for the earnings miss almost two month ago?
"Great earnings, great upside potential. CEO deliberately downplays success, good play from her - shows there's much more in store."
"My small cap ""risky"" stocks AAOI and RIOT are making me money. This CPB ""safe"" stock is in the dump."
General Mills GIS is another one to Buy up huge on
Solid brand for long term value investors.
"I don't understand (well understand but do not accept as reasonable) the concept of a stock being ""boring"". Is Campbell Soup your friend or spouse? Is it a movie or a sporting event? There is only one reason to care about the vast majority of stocks: to make money. The company's products can be exciting or boring to someone, but if you look for ""excitement"" start trading in AMC or GME that are basically entertainment vehicles."
"$50's this week, lets get it boyz!"
52 week lows and a nice pe…. Nice value play.
"CPB will do stocks buy back soon ..Very profitable company ,stock should be $80/sh"
ride the storm with a warm cup of Campbell's chicken noodle soup...they should get into bone broth and other pro-health soups with supplements.
Campbells Board of directors has phone solicitation for all the stock they can get voted their way. they have called me 3 different times for me to change my 500 share vote I place with 3rd point. they must be desperate for calling over a measly 500 shares..
Would be nice if this company supported their shareholders instead of sitting idly by watching them go broke.
Bought a bunch near close and after hours.Someone below commented that they authorized a $250m buyback. Can anyone verify?
"I think a second wave of covid is coming and that it could spark a stockpiling, pantry-loading 2.0. Should help stocks like Campbell soup. Also, the eat-at-home theme should stay for a while and it should help this stock and give it good 2019 comparables. It should be very safe and it looks good in this environnement. I don't own it, but I would like to buy if it drops again today."
500 more at 45.56 thanks for the free money shirts and weak hands
Just rumors
"I do not think Campbell should sell. Remember over 10 years ago Hershey had a new CEO and after only a few months, he felt the company had to be sold. Thank goodness large stockholders blocked the sale. Look at it now. Executives who think campbells should be sold are lazy and no imagination. Just look at brands Prego, spaghetti o s, peppridge farm bread. They are stars in store aisles. Draw up new plan adjust production levels, cut costs where possible( not just low level employee wages) improve distribution. Read a turn around Story!"
"Decided to sold my position and take the 9% while it is still there. Great earning but I think it should only go up 2-3%, I mean it is a soup company and it is forcast profit from its snack sales? Good luck to anyone buying long."

"So the analysts are saying, CPB only did good because of Covid, and now they are going to do bad because of Covid going away. So, no appreciation ever for any reason. TSLA will never make as much money per share as CPB!! I actually did the math on TSLA market cap last night. It is higher than AT&T, Ford, GM, ADM and XOM all combined. Really! It is a joke."
"Does anyone think this is a good one to wait for the end of the year, when some people sell for tax losses?"

So they’re buying back stock to make the earnings look better . Couldn’t that money be used in a more productive manner? It’s called voodoo economics.
This stock is so much like Ford. The family is running it into the ground.
Will it be Coca Cola?
This is still a ressesion stock and America is now entering a deep ressession.

"Loeb's activist hedge fund Third Point and company heir George Strawbridge own an approximately 8.4-percent stake in the canned soup and food company and made their position clear in July that a sale of the company to a strategic buyer is needed to improve its competitive standing. However, the New York Post, citing its sources, reported Monday evening the company will publicly state it has no intention in selling itself.The company could announce as soon as Thursday the results of a multi-month long review the board of directors conducted, the Post said. The likelihood of the board saying it will explore a sale is 10 percent -- a decision that will likely lead to a proxy war with Loeb."
This stock is like the last one pick for the team. You are stuck with a low performer.

"Watch for the housing bubble to burst this fall. Many people have purchased homes, which they could not afford in the first place. The cracks are starting to form in the housing market. Again, due to hard times, people will resort to eating soup to survive."
Good for long term
Let's go Campbell
