What a beautiful opportunity to pick up a cheap 3% yield
https://discord.gg/byg4mS3
Lowering expectations and outperforming is the way to create max shareholders' value
Seems to me this could be a perfect value play.
How do we explain a 3.65 percent decline after the announcement ?
"Loeb's activist hedge fund Third Point and company heir George Strawbridge own an approximately 8.4-percent stake in the canned soup and food company and made their position clear in July that a sale of the company to a strategic buyer is needed to improve its competitive standing. However, the New York Post, citing its sources, reported Monday evening the company will publicly state it has no intention in selling itself.The company could announce as soon as Thursday the results of a multi-month long review the board of directors conducted, the Post said. The likelihood of the board saying it will explore a sale is 10 percent -- a decision that will likely lead to a proxy war with Loeb."
Mmmmm....Mmmmm......:
"Watch and see what Wall Street does next to drive is lower, They are buying more puts. They must know something about accounting problems or something else to come from the CEO leaving. Mmm Mmm BAD"
I looked at a chart of Campbell's and it was higher in 1998. Anyone know the reason?
I love the frozen Pepperidge Farms cakes! Haven't had one in years. Have to pick one up before Loeb makes them extinct.
"I just saw the Smucker's interview (family)... he acknowledges post-CoVid startup COGS & D&A increases... all temporary, manageable & pipeline-related... Soup is ""simpler""... especially for ""professionally managed CPB""... ;)"
Two Words: Comfort Food
Would be nice if this company supported their shareholders instead of sitting idly by watching them go broke.
"as it goes down, I buy on sale."
CPB doesn't seem to have much cash and quite a lot of debt.
soup will be flying off the shelves when the cooler weather comes ...but everyone keeps buying internet and tech high flyers ... i will go with the soup ....
"people are buying the Campbell soups now and they can't keep the multi-packs on the shelf. Chicken noodle is hard to find sometimes. Adding chicken, Zucchini and Cheyenne pepper makes it a great meal."
"Great earnings, great upside potential. CEO deliberately downplays success, good play from her - shows there's much more in store."
Massive volume on the upside three times the average!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! all indications here this is set to fly!!!!!

"I thought management was to do what was best for stockholders, apparently not."
Very confused by Zacks articles. They were touting this stock big time on June 4 and now are on a constant beat down. Inflation will hit every corner of this economy and we will just have to pony up more. Campbell will up their prices or reduce the product size just as all companies have done in the past. If anything people will buy more soup as they are more economical than other foods. This company is recession proof.
Earnings are coming out. They are out of Cream of Onion in Wisconsin at certain locations. Bought today.
"At 8x earnings, this should be an obvious buy but l think it's just boring to the modern 'investor""."
What has triggered the drop in recent weeks? I can't see to find any specific headlines except for the earnings miss almost two month ago?
Solid brand for long term value investors.
"I'm happy,! Bought with Lance monies below $39 (plus a new car for holding on to Lance when everyone sold at $15.00! crackers and soup for the long term and the dividend!gonna follow my same plan called long term investing, no in and out broker fees."
What a beautiful stock!
"While there have been many gaffs by this CEO, the company was trying to get into niche markets, i.e. organics. Unfortunately, they do not have the knowledge to run these companies. The straw that broke her back was the Lance acquisition. Over paid and too much debt. This is stock will stay in the low 40's once it rebounds."
I guess no one will buy goldfish crackers any more.
"Due to mass buying of customer fear, I believe Campbell soup and their line of products are gonna be an amazing investment"
Adding
Keep buying. Nice drop for investors
"6.9.21. Market didn't like the earnings report. Gee whiz, you'd think they cut the dividend or something! Nope, plenty of dough coming in to pay that and increase it."
"I'm long the stock, but really could use a pull back tomorrow to get below $42.50 to not have to roll my cc's...hope to see that..."
Cramer issued buy
It’s under $43.00… will it go to 40$… thanks shorty.
So they’re buying back stock to make the earnings look better . Couldn’t that money be used in a more productive manner? It’s called voodoo economics.
Anyone know why this stock has been tanking the last two days? I can’t seem to find a reason
CPB 15 million shares still short looks like squeeeze
Is Loeb good for Campbell?
"How well can CPB hold up in an inflationary environment?Producing higher quality product, may make it difficult for CPB to cut costs vs. cheaper brand competition?Everytime I go into a grocery store I look for bargains."
"So I asked my financial advisor (also know as my wife) how we were preparing for going back to school this winter, she said she was going to stock the shelves with lots of products to ease our meal and snack preparation. So whilst she bought some canned soup, I bought some canned 'shares' . GLTA, God bless stay safe my 'prepper' friends ."
Don't forget it is at 8:20am tomorrow!! https://conferencecalltranscripts.com/summary/?id=285354&pr=true
"CPB will do stocks buy back soon ..Very profitable company ,stock should be $80/sh"
"It seems like this business is a family pride issue, where diplomacy would be tantamount. Could never image Loeb obtaining any control over it, given his vitriol nature, which they would quickly figure out via google. Mmm mmm bad."
August 17 40 Call is up like crazy.Volume over 2k options. Any idea ???
Nice drop. Time to buy.
"In my two cents the only strategy CPB is lacking emerging market expansion. If they do that they will have time to correct money , so much money will pour in ."
"(today) Deutsche Bank raises price target to $54 from $53, a 13.4% return from the current price, $47.60"
"with global warming CPB needs to diversify even more away from soup. who wants soup when it's 100 degrees outside? i am down 15% in my investment. GIS & K investments doing much better. maybe CPB can put a 3-course meal in a can. the top layer can be the appetizer, the second layer the meal, and the last layer dessert."
wow No one comments in this board even when the stock is going up. Any thoughts?
Interesting. They are buying back $500MM in stock yet raising prices because of inflation. Hmmmm....
General Mills GIS is another one to Buy up huge on
"As a retired grocer, I like CPB as a long term investment at this level. With dividend increase, yield now over 3% again, sales and profits beat expectations and nicely up over LY. Supermarket sales seem to be running at about +10% same store on a nationwide level, and I believe that even after the virus is gone people will be eating at home more than pre-virus times."
"I think Wall St. has CPB wrong, their Debt is now less than 4X operating income and Net Interest payments will be $190M per year down from $356M in 2019. Management has also authorized 5.5% of shares outstanding to be bought back and CPB is throwing off a 3.5% dividend. That's a 9% shareholder yield!!! This is a slow grower but 10X operating earnings is too cheap for a company who consistently posts 15% operating margins! I'm hammering the buy button under $45 all day stick this one in your coffee can and check back in a decade!!!"
Mr. Market giving the boys an unreal deal on $CPB!!! Very hard to imagine a scenario where CPB doesn't give shareholders a double digit return for the next few years!
"There's bound to be some new drama with the , ""investor activist"", who claims to have dirt on one of the board members. May be a buying opportunity ahead."
don't be scared weak hands. this stock is tremendously undervalued and the company is only continuing to grow.
Buying tomorrow for $38-$39
"I think a second wave of covid is coming and that it could spark a stockpiling, pantry-loading 2.0. Should help stocks like Campbell soup. Also, the eat-at-home theme should stay for a while and it should help this stock and give it good 2019 comparables. It should be very safe and it looks good in this environnement. I don't own it, but I would like to buy if it drops again today."
CAMPBELL SOUP CO https://sec.report/Document/0000016732-19-000070/ Annual Report 10-K
Gonna be rough times ahead for CPB and all banners under them for a long long while!
Back in at 45.62. What’s up with this????
"Campbell began its downward spiral when they staffed the top management with individuals from P & G that knew absolutely nothing about making or marketing soup. When the Campbell was staffed with individuals that ""grew"" up with the company in the soup business, the company flourished and grew at a consistent and profitable pace."
Just buy...!! under value..
"Good earnings. After the initial surge in the stock, I may be a buyer. Looks like there could be a lot of up side with this company."
"It appears the gap down is going to fill. at least some. I certainly think $35 is obtainable too, and mostly like reach $37 using technicals, but when you add fundamentals, this seems to be the fly in the buttermilk.. They say, trend is your friend, this equity is certainly not over valued.and trend is beginning to go up.."
"with November 20 nearing, would take some gumption to buy here. if you're already ""married"" to CPB and it's parked in your portfolio, may as well sit and wait."
"Watch for the housing bubble to burst this fall. Many people have purchased homes, which they could not afford in the first place. The cracks are starting to form in the housing market. Again, due to hard times, people will resort to eating soup to survive."
Amazon should take over...
"""Kitchen"" stocks like CPB and MKC thrive in a bloody day!!"
"I don't understand (well understand but do not accept as reasonable) the concept of a stock being ""boring"". Is Campbell Soup your friend or spouse? Is it a movie or a sporting event? There is only one reason to care about the vast majority of stocks: to make money. The company's products can be exciting or boring to someone, but if you look for ""excitement"" start trading in AMC or GME that are basically entertainment vehicles."
"I was looking at buying shares in Campbell Soup Co. last summer. They have some really great brands. Didn't pull the trigger to buy and watched stock go up modestly over months. With pandemic/stay-at-home and lots of food service going out of business soon, I like Campbell a lot now, but I'm still wondering if this is really the right stock to own long term. It's still basically a low margin, slow grower packaged food biz. My question is, do you think the ""long term"" picture here has changed positively, or is it just an temporary uptick for the coming quarters or at most few years?"
3.7% yield if it drops below $40
cheap shares at a discount. thanks weak hands for helping others buy low.
I bought the dip today
Walmart agreement did not go through I think.
I will have to eat Campbell Soup if the share price keep trending down.
bought more today
"Solid branded company. My favorite mushroom cream soup, modifiable for other tasty food recipes."
Pepsi is diversified with snacks and more. My bet is on Coca-Cola (KO) to acquire CPB in order to diversify at low price point so that they can make their investors happy that they are on the ball.
"So there is rumor of a bidding war for the International business. Looking at the financials, Campbell must get $3.5B for the international and $1.5B forth Fresh unit. With $8B in debt, this company needs to get a total of at least $5B to get there debt in line. The amount of money spent paying interest is a major headwind and with the Fed increasing rates it is putting a lot of pressure on this stock. The me shrinking which is another reason a sale must be completed quickly. I believe the stock will stay in the range of mid-34 to mid-35. With a good quarter it may go higher, but eventually come back down due to fundamentals. Once the sale is finalized, the stock will rise on rumors of the company being sold. Will it be sold? It depends upon how successful the leadership is in implementing their plan."
"The ""Risk-off"" ""Kitchen stocks"" like CPB and MKC are back! It's a reflection of the sentiment of the economy, Covid resurgent and now the take over by the Taliban. As a nation, we need to come together and put U.S. first or we will fall apart sooner than we think. Shame on the leaders at all levels who sold this country out for personal gains."
"How low will she go? Down 15% ($53.54 to $46.90) in four days... ouch! That means it's time to BUY, BUY, BUY!"
Campbell Soup co. 1 Year stock chart not very pretty.
"All I heard for years was how great a CEO Denise Morrison was, and now she abruptly resigns. What gives?"
I am ready for this to go over $50. Any time would be great
according to my calcs this is very near breaking down at the 25+ year support line... i wish i had more cash... is there any forward guidance on the dividend stability?
Gonna be a big beat ahead for CPB and all of their brands for the rest of time.
"so far i made enough on cpb to buy 8 cans of soup, provided they are on sale. not bad, folks. plus i get paid that nice dividend. hey, beats a CD paying 0.1 %"
@ sandi. MSG is a flavor enhancer. Makes Campbell Soup taste M m good.....
"I wonder how many people are thinking of filling up their cupboards with soups, comfort foods and other campbell products as this virus begins to threaten the world? I wonder how many other countries are seeing runs on these sorts of goods? IMHO, we could see an unexpected increase in earnings this quarter and a small increase in guidance going forward. Time will tell..."
"New Poster Here caught up in gamestop stock like everyone else was looking at other winning stocks today saw Cambell's as a big winner probably a lot of you might be surprised like me to see it move. Campbell's BG Foods, Hormel , Conagra, Kellogg's , Kraft Heinz all up today on a 665 point Dow Down day. Three reasons we might be seeing the surge is 1) Food, Healthcare (not insurance or Biotech) but Hospitals, drugs, surgeries are not as economically sensitive as tech and are the last things generally to be cut back in a bad economy so cash flow stays pretty constant. 2) people may be looking for income. All the above mentioned stocks at least pay a 2% dividend or higher BG Foods is around 6% and Campbell's just under 3% which is pretty good in an economy that is forcing rates down so government can loan more money at cheaper rates so CDs and savings get you nothing not even enough to cover living expense increases 3) There is lots of short interest in many of these old stable, big cap dividend paying companies. Many holders are retirees who will hold no matter what as a result whether the market is ups at new highs or takes tumbles like today. to short the shares has a very low margin and they can all get a decent move if they miss or beat their earnings expectations every quarter so if they miss a short can generally get a couple of quick bucks but not the worry of a short squeeze if they miss and if they have to hold the maintenance is low unlike what we have been seeing in Gamestop AMC Cruise Ships, Airlines and Rental Car companies over the last nine months. Plus with the low turn over most brokerage companies can lend short shares out without fears of usually having a big run in the shares (unless there is a buyout and short cover spike) so they can easily get them for their clients. I trade through etrade and in the research area under fundamentals , if I am reading it correctly as of the end of last quarter or the last update on the etrade under fundamentals it shows the short interest in Campbell's to be 12.56% though this number could be different by now I am not sure how current that number is if it is as of the last 15 day update, last quarter, or last year's annual update, BG foods was 30%.. With all the hawking going on with short bashing some people may be looking for higher shorted companies to look at. BG Foods BGS had three massive spikes. Don't know if 12% is considered a lot but for what some on the site call an old stable food company it seems like a lot. However, Campbell's has a lot going for it. Good Management, fairly consistent earnings, pays a nice dividend and has weathered many many economic downturns and is still going. I bought a few as a defense against a market downturn but there are other reasons to buy it. Good luck everyone."
52 week lows and a nice pe…. Nice value play.
Campbell Soup is up 4.98% to 48.90
"The CPB stock is starting to look like a good value with a nice dividend of about 3.5%. I have not bought into it yet but it appears from the past lows, the stock will move under $40 a share. Is it worth getting in under 40 and is there be any business plan by the company’s management to improve the stock value? I’m very much a newbee investor and would appreciate input. Have a nice day."
"Hey Guys, do you thinks its worth buying today even if it opens at 40 dollars ? how likely do you guys think the buyout will happen? Thank you x"
I hope I can buy more under $45
I’m pretty new to CPB but have owned HRL for a very long time. It’s interesting that CPB is much more optimistic about the future than HRL this morning.
I bought at 44.70$ thinking we were on a dip... is there something I am missimg or is it just a downswing?
SOUP IS ON!!! $36 NEXT STOP!!!! STRONG BUY!!!!!
"This is a perfect stock to own in times like this. Price has hardly moved since the beginning of Coronavirus, pays a nice well supported dividend that has been consistently raised, etc. Food processing stocks such as this, General Mills, Kellogg, Hershey, and Hormel and Archer Daniels Midland will all keep your portfolio slightly up to flat while the market tanks."
"CPB along with a number of other companies need to realize that catering to the few that scream and yell about ""fresh"" and ""natural"" foods is such a tiny market with low margins its not worth the time and money to invest in getting it to market. Just get back to what they do best forget trying to get a market of perhaps 1-2% at best."
Beat on top and bottom lines! Now need to get a positive forward Outlook
All stocks are overvalued.. 13 year bull market being propping up by government... Democratic leadership taking the country down a dark hole... the market collapse will be the least of our worries.
Good for long term
The problem with this company is: horrible balance sheet…. They either need to raise cash or cut their dividends.
disappointed with the reaction ...but still like CPB ... and i am hoping for a merger in the space ... CPB seems to be right size to be taken out ...and consolidation leads to synergies and resultant cost savings .... give it a year ...
Earnings beat.. reported 0.83 EPS. Robinhood is faster than yahoo finance some times
"CPB is ripe for a Merger or Acquisition , and its just a matter of time . Good Economy , or bad , a can of soup is affordable for all ."
Good PE and dividend and sales will be soaring even after their pre-virus panic earnings beat and upgrades! Add the prospect of a takeover that is always present. What's not to like?
What's going on?? Just broke 44
"Does anyone think this is a good one to wait for the end of the year, when some people sell for tax losses?"
Let’s gooooooo...beautiful stock! 
"I do not think Campbell should sell. Remember over 10 years ago Hershey had a new CEO and after only a few months, he felt the company had to be sold. Thank goodness large stockholders blocked the sale. Look at it now. Executives who think campbells should be sold are lazy and no imagination. Just look at brands Prego, spaghetti o s, peppridge farm bread. They are stars in store aisles. Draw up new plan adjust production levels, cut costs where possible( not just low level employee wages) improve distribution. Read a turn around Story!"
The upcoming earning report may be my get out of jail of a stock.
Here we go time to start the run up
I guess market is so bad today has everyone thinking soup kitchens are coming back.
Going up!
"add jm smucker to the list today ...please, just wait untill after earnings, then buy on the dip. There has yet to be ONE food conglomerate company that has come out with positive guidance this quarter. I'm hoping for $36 to solidify my position. and ride it back up to 45 with the 4% div."
"While the soup business is a drag on this company, historically the stock goes up after 1st quarter results. I believe that it is because many people use the cream soups for cooking. There could be a big uptick after the 1st quarter. The snack and bakery businesses are booming and Snyder/Lance is profitable. Not sure how the carrot business did.....I did not hear of any major issues. I am sitting on the sidelines until closer to the reporting date/ I want to see if the price warrants an investment. At $34 or above I believe it would be too expensive. After earnings, it would leave my portfolio."
"fwiw: analysts have no use for CPB. seeing 3 sell's right now. good fortune to ya' going forward. will jump to 43, and maybe 8/24. if you're using the option chain that could work out. that's for you to figure out."
"Limit order set for $40 at open, but will trigger for much less …"
ride the storm with a warm cup of Campbell's chicken noodle soup...they should get into bone broth and other pro-health soups with supplements.
52 week low soon 
This stock is like the last one pick for the team. You are stuck with a low performer.
"If tesla owned it, with all the misses, it would be in the 70s"
Deteriorating fundamentals. I don't like this.
"BUY! There are a few stocks during this sell off that are attractive buys even at these prices, but CPB is probably my top pick. The upside in the short term is 15-20% and that’s being conservative. Especially after earnings. This will also benefit greatly from the upcoming second wave. Doubt we’ll see this opportunity for CPB again."
500 more at 45.56 thanks for the free money shirts and weak hands
"When those federal unemployment checks end and eviction moratorium ends, watch out for hard times. People will resort to eating soup."
"$50's this week, lets get it boyz!"
Bought a bunch near close and after hours.Someone below commented that they authorized a $250m buyback. Can anyone verify?
They are going to announce they will add plant-base soups in their line of products
Bought today at $43.09
"My small cap ""risky"" stocks AAOI and RIOT are making me money. This CPB ""safe"" stock is in the dump."
https://www.investopedia.com/campbell-soup-cpb-option-traders-bullish-after-earnings-5200318
Where is this a true value buy? $36? $40. $10. Thoughts?
"Campbell Soup shares are trading higher after the company reported better-than-expected Q1 results and raised its quarterly dividend.Dec 9, 2020 7:42a ET"
"selling ""bolthouse."" really, that's the best they could do. fiscally, probably would have made more sense to keep it and cut back on ""bolthouse"" offerings. if i were long CPB i'd be taking a long, hard look at that 3.5 % dividend. think about it."
"Lost over 13% yeay to date ..CEO and upper managements, stick your dividend in your A..."
"So the analysts are saying, CPB only did good because of Covid, and now they are going to do bad because of Covid going away. So, no appreciation ever for any reason. TSLA will never make as much money per share as CPB!! I actually did the math on TSLA market cap last night. It is higher than AT&T, Ford, GM, ADM and XOM all combined. Really! It is a joke."
$33.00 to $34.00 Maybe ?? To Much debt and their soup isn't good anymore
Looks like we got a beat!!!! Congratulations to all CPB longs- no sale today! Buy while you can …
"Just keep selling cc's good for about .4-.5% a week 1-2 strikes out...I've got $43 CSP that looks like it will get assigned, but I've booked premium to get my cost to about $41.22 so I'm up and will sell $43.50 cc's then $44 then $45 as it goes up and keep the stock...good buy here I think, will pop a little bit tomorrow or tick back up by close (hopefully)"
"The options tell the story.. lots of calls being bought in 53-57 range. They pushed it down in early trade to get a decent price for them. Seen this a million times. Earnings will be great, 8-10% pop from there."
"Very common sense acquisition by kraft. Easy cost savings on corporate processes, warehouse delivery commonalities, overlap in advertising, and innovation, size leverage in procurement and with customers for better overall net pricing. Significant overlap for warehouse business. Question is what do you do with the DSD business. Perhaps it partners with Mondelez in a split bid to parcel off dsd."
will this stock drop...
Shhhh…. Keep adding while everyone is sleeping….
What a SOUPer deal at these levels!!!
"the summary page of this stock on yahoo finance says the stock is ""undervalued"" with a 17% estimated return."
"CPB is about to crush earnings!! It’s crazy that people have been sleeping on this stock because it’s not as exciting as zoom and Tesla but the upside here is major. This was over $57 in March which it will return to, so that’s already 10% "
I will go get and eat a can of Campbell soup to break this share price down trend. CPB is getting slaughtered along with the market; CPB is down regardless if the market is up or down.
Unfortunately poor management and poor decisions ruined CPB; probably the most likely scenario/fix is for someone like Smuckers (SJM) or Procter and Gamble (PG) to step up and make a bid for the company. Smuckers is looking to grow it's brand and this is a perfect fit for them and the cost savings would allow for more streamlined production... PG could buy this company and absorb them into their huge portfolio without skipping a beat. Unfortunately KHC who is actually looking for something to buy is really not an option. Buffet doesn't companies with this much baggage...
$CPB Target Lowered by Bank of America Underperform USD 45 » USD 42 Maintains Morgan Stanley Equal-Weight USD 48 » USD 46Target Lowered by RBC Capital Outperform USD 59 » USD 54 Target Lowered by Deutsche Bank Hold USD 50 » USD 48
"Campbell Soup price target raised to $57 from $50 at Credit Suisse 07:15 CPB Credit Suisse analyst Robert Moskow raised the firm's price target on Campbell Soup to $57 from $50 and keeps a Neutral rating on the shares. The analyst notes that the spread of the COVID-19 virus has created an unprecedented spike in demand for grocery products as consumers prepare for weeks of school closures, work-from-home arrangements, and reduced access to restaurants. His view is that this represents a shift in food consumption demand, not just a pull-forward, because consumers will need to continuously restock their homes. Moskow expects food consumption to remain elevated over the next 12 months as consumers choose to keep eating food at-home to save money, much like they did during the last three economic recessions in 1990, 2001, and 2008."
"I bought more CPB at 35 even though soup sales were sluggish. I am a dividend investor - relatively young retiree, living off dividend income. I believe the Campbell brand will be here in 30 years and I like the safety of a powerful brand. The world is very populated and not everyone is rich. Campbells Soup is a great way to feed those kids and make them happy! Hopefully we will see some type of windfall with a Kraft take-over."
Yes been such a great and easy short Really sub par management
All right…. I’m long now….. let’s go ahead with a buyout with either Nestle or Berkshire….. first in at $45 can have my shares.
Load up
Don't buy the false narrative...beat on profits and outlook of adjusted EPS remains unchanged. Good report! Going higher!
campbell soup is all everyone will be eating when the next recession hits
Will it be Coca Cola?
Next order $42.25
Just rumors
"Earning beat...this is my get out of jail card. My breakeven is $43.75. CPB dropped 13% while S&P500 went up a lot this year. CPB went down from $62 since Jan, 2017. CPB gives a perception of a safe stock but the reality says it is a trap for lost of opportunity to make money elsewhere. Put money under the mattress would have done better!"
This stock is so much like Ford. The family is running it into the ground.
apparently soup company doesn't care about higher interest rates. the stock actually went up today. apparently it is a flight to safety ..soup is safe
Very confident within six months we will see nice appreciation ACCUMULATION NOW IN PROGRESS BY SMART MONEY
will drop below 40
"If CPB was called ""Campbell Snack Company"", the P/E would be double what it is today..."
$43…this will be a 3.5% yielder
"Definitely not a good quarter, but this appears to be an overaction. Operating income was unchanged from last year and they repaid quite a bit of debt. The inflationary concerns will not last forever, good long term buying opp IMO"
Need to get rid of this CEO and upper management ASAP.. They don't care about stock holder and don't know how to run this company....
Adding in the am
"I wanted to grow my own food, but I can’t find bacon seeds."
"General sentiment is correct, but if you dont have the wherewithal to buy a couple hundred shares....then you shouldn't be in the market at all."
"I've got $45 CSP's for 7/16 thinking i might finally get assigned haha. I've banked about $1.50 in premium so my avg is about $43.50 which is awesome, collect some divvy and get about .5% a week in CC premium, doing the same with KR, SOFI, VIAC, ROOT"
If this thing goes up right before close; I’m buying into earnings
I have 2000 shares for sale at 45.74 if anyone is interested lmk
Not everyone is rich. People struggle to feed their families. It can get expensive. Kids get very hungry. Campbell's Soup is the answer. iconic brand which is here to stay.
One thing to know about the Campbell soups is that one can add zucchini to just about all of them and streach the meal. Unlike a lot of veggies it picks up the flavor of the soup and makes a great meal.
"I am thinking that food is very competitive business with very narrow moat now days . Should I investment in CPB ? Anybody please , thanks in advance."
Campbells Board of directors has phone solicitation for all the stock they can get voted their way. they have called me 3 different times for me to change my 500 share vote I place with 3rd point. they must be desperate for calling over a measly 500 shares..
"Goldfish and Milano cookies, what's not to like?"
We will see 55.00 per share by January next year with a possible dividend increase.
Looks like will go up a little every week until it get close to $50....
This is still a ressesion stock and America is now entering a deep ressession.
"Dan Loeb and the slightly tweaked board are looking to prune the non-core units, thus reducing their on-going debt significantly, their expanded snack division is doing quite well and I'll take the dividend into the summer/fall while watching this return to the low $40 range."
I like when my stocks go on sale..
Are earnings before bell or after bell tomorrow? Sorry couldn’t find after searching
i looked on cpb company website and their products just aren't that enticing. i would say their soup actually stands out compared to many of their other products. cpb needs an overhaul. maybe they should get into hemp. how 'bout hash-tag brownies? how's that for marketing? or another possibility is a meal in a can. for example beef strogonoff or beef stew. you prepare the noodles or rice and just add in the meal from the can. people want easy to prepare meals. maybe i should email the company ... they need some guidance ..but first i will have a brownie or two...
"Well I'm in for the first time, bought some yesterday at 42.01 and doubled it today at 41.06. It's now one of my largest positions as I really like the dividend yield, free cash flow numbers, and continuous debt reduction. Piper has just discovered that CPB is affected by commodity inflation? And the stock falls on that? Captain Obvious to the rescue! I think in times of inflation this is the type of stock you want to own as opposed to sell."
I picked up 34.54 I think this will rebound
Why would a company prevent employees from investing in that company in their 401K
"Lots of shorts on this page. Personally, I’ll take the 3.6% yield"
Anyone know what’s dropping the stock?
will earnings improve?
"I got out when it rose a bit after the earning report. CPB will stay depressed until the soup line forms in the next depression. Five year ago the price was above $60. Take your dividend lousy useless ""long term hold"" CPB. Fake ""safety"" stock. Good bye and good ridden!"
this company needs more product innovation. .. soup is boring ....
Anybody think this can get back to $40.00 ???
I'm in the house of pain with this one. Might as well wait a few days for earnings I guess...
They can’t find over the road drivers to get the product to the independent operators of the snacks division . Logistics is a mess . No urgency by upper management . Many class action lawsuits by “independent business owners “ employed by CPB. They have a great product though . Just getting it from the bakery to the consumers mouths seems to be an issue .
Great Day right now to buy around 52 wk low!
Looks like a great deal at $34 and change.
"With all the short interest and a buyout rumor on the table, I'm very surprised the stock hasn't jumped more than 10%. If the rumor is confirmed, stock price should see at least another 10% with short covering. Sorry shorts, but No More Soup For You!"
I'm a young person who has a stock portfolio who's invested in 6 stocks including Campbell Soup. I hope this goes up. I'm betting on this!!! Follow my instagram @tyart360!
"If you’re a day trader, you should definitely check out (http://Fairstox.com). They send a watchlist covering the top pre-market movers every day before the open. It’s a great way to pick out potential trades for the day."
CPB is a defensive trade here plus with a 3% divy should do well with zero rates on horizon load the 
What will the price be tomorrow?
WOW someone purchased 6000 $38 puts for tomorrow. Someone must already have the earnings and forecast.
This company has such a solid financial sheet. ~8 P/E ~5 EPS. Wow.
"put alert notice on CPB @ 33 and start accumulation. vote will end up in boards lap anyway. someone, somewhere in CPB's employ, not board member, will rise to the occasion and right ship."
Good earnings. Good management. Just buy a few shares at this price and hold.
"Decided to sold my position and take the 9% while it is still there. Great earning but I think it should only go up 2-3%, I mean it is a soup company and it is forcast profit from its snack sales? Good luck to anyone buying long."
"Yes, a can of their soup is a 'thin gruel' compared to what it used to be like when I was a kid. Increasing the price and lowering the quality at the same time eventually catches up with you."
Bought at $43.29
CPB is all soup and no beef. It's the MSG in it that gives you the headache as is its trending down stock price.
We are going to $35+ real soon!!! Strong Buy!!!
I love buying brand name turn arounds that pay a great divvy. When they collapse 60% buy !

"So if Kraft rumors are accurate what is a reasonable expectation range, $50-$55?"
CAG has most upside. Own KHC and CPB also. This trio has bottomed out. Little downside.
Great time to buy on this dip in my opinion. Solid company and so much upside
Downward trend means keep on adding.
Joe evicted me today :(. But he going to send $100 so it’s even right? I’m buying 0.10 $CPB stocks and the rest on cold hotdogs and a Ross blanket for my new home my car
"I've owned SJM for 15 years. Cost basis: pretty much the same as CPB today. That puts the day-to-day fluctuations in perspective. What you want from this type of stock is three thing: no chance of going bankrupt, high free cash flow, and high return on equity. For the rest, just give it time."
"I bought CPB at 44, but it looks like a huge mistake. It is going to take a lot just to get back to even. I guess I will just collect dividends until they get their act together."
"Company needs to shake things up. Snyder-Lance was the opportunity to reduce dependence on soups, but seems like shelf space is declining. Late July Harvest for example is a premium snack offering. Make sure quality control is in place if you want to grow a premium brand. I paid a premium to buy Late July Harvest lime chips and the contents were a disgusting clump of fused who knows what. If you focus on quality, stores will move the product and give you prominent shelf space."
Cold morning I'm going to heat some soup.
Let's go Campbell
Here’s a clue walk in a grocery store/supermarket and observe. Then pick up most of their products and read the ingredients. Then go to your local public library and check out a book on nutrition. Better yet check out any book about what large clusters of the longest living people in the world eat.
CPB earnings on Wed. will be catalyst for all eat at home food staples. Buy CAG BGS GIS MCK HRL
this will rebound.oil is going up and interest rates also people cut back ...and what a perfect way than to have soup...it happened in 2008
"As I stated before, the r for earnings was set very low. There have been leaks that the company would sell the fresh and Arnott's business. The surprise to me is that they are sell Kjelsen. That was purchased just a year or two ago and was supposed to be the gateway into China. I believe that the Chinese government would not allow CPB to sell in there. (Not really a market for soup there anyway) Now CPB needs to change their packaging; Milennials do not have the ability to add anything to prepare a meal. Also, they do not want cans....they are bad for the environment. CPB still has to change any other things in their products as well. The headwinds are still strong, but they have diminished with the announced changes. This stock will go up over time, but I do not foresee it reaching mid-40s until after the New Year."
Sale starts tomorrow
Back in 44.83 x 1000 what in the world is going on here???
