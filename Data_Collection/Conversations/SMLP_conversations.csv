"California says ""Thank god"" for natural gas.Mark Chediak and Naureen S. MalikThu, September 9, 2021, 12:08 PM(Bloomberg) -- California is asking the federal government to declare an “electric reliability emergency” so the Golden State can lean more heavily on fossil fuels to avoid blackouts.The state’s main grid operator wants the U.S. Department of Energy to suspend air-pollution rules for some natural gas-burning power plants in case their output is needed “to meet demand in the face of extremely challenging conditions including extreme heat waves, multiple fires, high winds, and various grid issues,” according to a filing."
"FERC noted gas futures in New England for January-February 2022 were trading over $21 per million British thermal units, up sharply from $6.78 in January-February 2021 and a five-year (2017-2021) average of $5.79.FERC expects gas-fired plants will generate about 52% of New England's power and 47% in New York this winter.Glick told utilities to line up fuel supplies because the Northeast does not have enough gas pipeline capacity for both heating and power generation on the coldest days.Don't be fooled by Glick the #$%$ He wrote a dissenting opinion when the Double E pipeline project finally got approved by FERC. Check it out at this link:https://www.ferc.gov/news-events/news/item-c-4-commissioner-richard-glick-dissent-regarding-double-e-pipeline-llc"
The Double E route extends ~ 130 miles through the core of theDelaware Basin and is located in close proximity to ~ 30 naturalgas processing plants with over 10 Bcf/d of processing capacity.The Double E pipeline has potential to significantly increase its original 1.35 Bcf/d of throughput capacity. With natural gas currently above $4 it will come as no surprise that I expect expansion in 2022.

Let us hope this is not just another pump and dump! I have zero confidence in Zacks.Estimates have actually risen so much that the stock now has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) suggesting this relatively unloved stock could be due for a breakout soon. This will be especially true if SMLP stock can build momentum from here and find a way to continue higher of off this encouraging trading development.
"Like Tom I had problems understanding the ECP deal, but comments from others were helpful and I think I get it now.. so if I summarize:ECP had 10M warrants pre-split, which is 666,666 post split, at an exercise price of $15With the current SMLP share price, ECP were sitting on an unrealized of $22 a shareWhat parties agreed was: ECP is not paying to exercise the warrants (SMLP is not getting $10M from ECP as a result). However, because SMLP is not getting that $10M cash, they gave ECP less shares as a result to compensate.So the formula is: $10M divided by a share price of $39.65 = 252,189 (being 666,667 - 414,477)Please let me know if I got it wrong!"
"Below is a paragraph in an article in the Wall Street by By Jinjoo Lee Sept. 20, 2021 7:03 am ETHEARD ON THE STREET America’s Next Hot Import Might Be Record Energy PricesNatural-gas, coal and electricity prices are all running abnormally high, far too earlyThe Industrial Energy Consumers of America, a trade group representing manufacturers, sent a letter to Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm on Friday urging immediate action to reduce LNG exports so that the U.S. can stock up on enough natural gas before winter. The group said many manufacturers can no longer compete in the market if Henry Hub prices rise above $10 per MMBtu."
"U.S. natural gas prices hit a 13-year high last week as the energy crunch in Europe and Asia pushed the prices in these two regions to the highest on record. And depending on winter weather, U.S. natural gas prices do have more room to rise. But they are unlikely to follow the skyrocketing rallies of the European and UK gas prices and the price of spot liquefied natural gas (LNG) in Asia, analysts say. Although the regional natural gas markets are now interconnected more than ever thanks to the LNG trade, U.S. gas prices will largely be spared the extreme volatility and record-high European and Asian prices.The United States has a fairly adequate natural gas supply in storage ahead of the winter. This is unlike Europe, where depleted inventories and rebounding demand have created a rush to stock up for the coldest months of the year, which in turn has caused a supply crunch and record-high gas and power prices.Moreover, U.S. natural gas production is rising slightly, while weekly injections into storage over the past month have been higher than usual for September.Despite the record LNG prices in Asia and the handsome netbacks that U.S. exporters are getting for their LNG cargoes, the United States has a certain capacity to feed gas to its LNG export terminals. All cargoes available will be scooped up, mostly by Asia, but the infrastructure will not allow too much incremental LNG supply out of America that would have severely tightened the domestic U.S. market."

"Tom..... I'm wondering if the delay in announcing the new financing doesn't have something to do with the recent Conoco Philips purchase of Shell's Permian Assets.

It so happens that Conoco's new acreage in the same area as the Double E. Just thinking out loud."

Would anyone like to speculate on why the company still has not issued the $700-750 million of notes outlined in their 2nd quarter financial report? There are only 3 weeks left before the end of the quarter. I believe the $400 million ABL Revolver was conditioned on issuing these notes. Any idea what happens if the notes are not issued? Management indicated this was their top priority but so far only crickets. I have a fairly sizeable position in the common and don't want to see it drop back into the teens like we saw a few months ago. Management has recently delivered on all of their promises but none that are bigger than this one. Interested to hear comments from other stakeholders......
"Josyana Joshua Wed, September 8, 2021, 10:11 AM wrote this for Bloomberg:(Bloomberg) -- U.S. natural gas futures soared to a seven-year high amid escalating concerns about tight supplies heading into the winter-heating season.Gas prices are soaring across the northern hemisphere as anxiety mounts about the prospects of a supply crunch in coming weeks when cold weather begins to descend and homeowners switch on furnaces. A confluence of production and processing disruptions are running headlong into robust demand for the fuel in some of the world’s biggest economies.Gas for October delivery rose as much as 9.7% to $5.01 per million British thermal units in New York on Wednesday, a level not seen since unprecedented cold gripped North America during the Polar Vortex of early 2014.In Phoenix and Los Angeles, so-called spot prices jumped to $30 and $20, respectively, according to a source who asked not to be identified. Demand for the fuel is climbing in the U.S. West amid a heat wave that’s lifting consumption of electricity to run air conditioners. European prices are in the midst of a record-setting ascent because deliveries from key producers have been stymied at a time of meager stored supplies.“We’re probably going to go into this coming winter, just the way things were already setting up, with the lowest level of gas in storage since 2014,” said John Kilduff, founding partner of Again Capital LLC.In the U.S. sector of the Gulf of Mexico, about 78% of gas production remains offline more than a week after offshore crews fled to safety ahead of Hurricane Ida’s arrival. The premium for March 2022 gas over April futures -- essentially a bet on how undersupplied the market will be at the end of next winter -- surged as much as 27%."

"Many of the larger companies are likely to increase spending less than 5%, according to IHS Markit. Meanwhile, the companies set to increase spending the most are the smaller, private producers that kept oil production growing in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico this year.In that region, the most active U.S. oil field, production has almost reached pre-pandemic levels, while the country as a whole is still about 1.5 million barrels shy of that mark, U.S. data show. Output in other regions has stagnated or declined this year.Ken Waits, CEO of Mewbourne Oil Co., one of the largest private oil producers in the Permian Basin, said during the pandemic last year his company idled 10 of the 12 drilling rigs it had running before the virus hit. Now, it is running 19 rigs, and expects to prop up more next year."

"By Sabrina ValleHOUSTON, Sept 24 (Reuters) - Brazil's imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) are set to hit a record in September, data from Refinitiv and consultancy Kpler shows, as U.S. cargoes normally meant for Europe are diverted to the Latin American nation to address a power shortage.The worst drought in almost a century has starved the hydropower plants that normally supply nearly two-thirds of Brazil's electricity. The country has, as a result, turned to U.S. gas to keep its lights on, with its LNG purchases helping drive global gas prices to record levels.""The strong demand from Brazil means there is less LNG supply being directed to European terminals,"" said Laura Page, senior LNG analyst with Kpler consultancy firm.European gas storage has fallen to its lowest in at least 10 years"

"John KempFri, September 10, 2021, 9:52 AM(John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own)By John KempLONDON, Sept 10 (Reuters) - U.S. gas traders are anticipating a big increase in production over the next year as the industry responds to higher prices by ramping up drilling, which should ensure supplies are more plentiful in time for winter 2022/23.As a result, futures prices for deliveries at Louisiana's Henry Hub in January 2023 are currently trading around $1.15 per million British thermal units below prices for deliveries in January 2022.Henry Hub's one-year calendar spread trades in contango about three-quarters of the time, reflecting the high cost of storing a gaseous commodity with low value to volume, so the current backwardation is unusual.The spread is currently in the 98th percentile for all trading days since the start of 2007, indicating supplies are expected to be exceptionally tight this winter, before improving significantly next year.During the first phase of the epidemic, monthly U.S. dry gas production slumped to just 75 billion cubic metres in June 2020, down from a record 85 billion cubic metres in December 2019.The number of rigs targeting primarily gas-bearing formations slumped to less than 70, from more than 130, over a similar period, according to field services company Baker Hughes.Since then, however, there has been a slow but steady increase in both drilling and production in response to the recovery in gas prices"

Since I cannot see the conditions of the other loans to be redeemed or the additional interest payments, I can only estimate.Overall, I expect additional financing costs of 20-25 million.The development of the gas market should lead to higher sales and thus earnings, both for the existing plants and for Double E. I assume about 5% higher sales (also for Double E) and thus about 25-30 million. 12.5-15 million profit should remain.So for 2022, I now expect pre-tax earnings to be about 8-10 million lower. Not nice, but it does not change the significantly better outlook from 2022 and is certainly not a reason for this share price drop."

"Global natural gas shortages, record gas and coal prices, a power crunch in China and a three-year high on oil prices all tell one story - demand for energy has roared back and the world still needs fossil fuels to meet most of those energy needs.""The demand fall during the pandemic was entirely linked to governments' decision to restrict movements and had nothing to do with the energy transition,"" Cuneyt Kazokoglu, head of oil demand analysis at FGE told Reuters.""The energy transition and decarbonisation are decade-long strategies and do not happen overnight.""Energy transition policies have come under fire for the run up in energy prices. In some places, they are having an impact, such as in Europe where high carbon prices aimed at reducing emissions have made utilities reluctant to switch on coal-fired plants to alleviate the shortage.In China, policies to reduce emissions have contributed to the government's decision to ration energy to heavy industry."

"I am glad the company is finally getting their refinancing done but I am not as optimistic as some of you regarding the path forward. First, the interest expense on the $700M loan would eat up almost the entire adjusted EBITDA for the last quarter. Second, many of their counterparty contracts expire in 2023 so those will need to be renegotiated sooner rather than later. Third, while the company has identified 4 key focus areas for future growth, they have one legacy area (Piceance Basin) which accounted for 13% of total revenues and 32% of adjusted EBITDA, and output in that segment has dropped consistently for several quarters. I acknowledge that the maintenance costs for the legacy assets are low but the company also must consider that at some point the value of those assets must be adjusted for current operating levels (i.e. writedowns). Given that background I would not be a fan of a new acquisition until the company is able to enhance their current assets to avoid future writedowns. How they do this probably entails many options over each operating unit. So my thinking is that the company should first look at ways to increase idle capacity on their current system before engaging in acquiring new assets. So if I were thinking outside the box, here is one suggestion that might be explored. In the Piceance Basin the company has two major customers in Caerus Oil & Gas and Terra Energy Partners. Maybe SMLP could negotiate a joint venture drilling program with one of them to increase the volume of gas on their existing pipelines. SMLP would earn addition income from the sale of the gas and the added volumes on their gathering and processing systems would also generate additional income.

"PennEast Pipeline Co., a joint venture of five companies including Southern Co. and Enbridge Inc., halted development on the proposed 116-mile (187-kilometer) conduit after failing to receive water-quality certification and other wetland permits for the New Jersey section.“The PennEast partners, following extensive evaluation and discussion, recently determined further development of the project no longer is supported,” PennEast said in an emailed statement. “Accordingly, PennEast has ceased all further development of the project.”The decision adds to a series of gas-pipeline projects scrapped amid fierce opposition from environmental groups pushing for a faster transition away from fossil fuels and an increasingly burdensome approval process. It also comes amid growing concerns about energy reliability, with prices for natural gas surging because of tighter supplies.In 2020 alone, Dominion Energy Inc. and Duke Energy Corp. scrapped an $8 billion Atlantic Coast gas project, and Williams Cos. abandoned its Constitution gas pipeline and its Northeast Supply Enhancement plan. Completion of the Mountain Valley Pipeline, a 303-mile conduit spanning from northwestern West Virginia to southern Virginia, has been pushed into 2022 due to permitting delays"

"I think that all EPS estimates and actual results in 2021 have little meaning.At the moment, everything is falsified by special effects:Q3-Aug 5 settlement costs for claims due to a 2015 pipeline rupture - totaling 36.25 mln-Construction costs Double E, There will certainly be no profit in Q3 - unless SMLP makes write-ups on fixed assets, which I doubt.So I estimate a quarterly loss between 35 and 40 mln or about $3.50 to $4.00/sh. Knowing SMLP's measure, this is not ""disappointing"" and certainly not a ""disaster"", but simply the price for management's much needed ""clean-up"".The fact that analysts are forecasting positive results despite the above-mentioned factors is very suspicious to me and will probably lead to a share price setback after the Q3 report is published. The same as already happened after the Q2 ER.Q4-Cost of issuing the 2026 senior notes.If those were issued at $98.50 for $100 par, that means an immediate shortfall in proceeds/loss of 1.5% - so 10.5 mln. Then add to that the ancillary costs.-Costs of repaying the 2022 SNotes and other borrowings, rather more expensive than 10.5 mln.-Establishment costs and start-up costs Double EThis means a loss in Q4 as well, most likely, and again absolutely not surprising.The year 2021 may deliver a slightly positive result on an adjusted basis, but the net result will be clearly negative. In 2022, the real profitability of SMLPs will be evident and the stock will approach its fair value. ."

Non-U.S. LNG exporters haven’t been pitching in as much supply because of various maintenance-related snags. Europe, in particular, is in a precarious position heading into winter as Russia, its most important natural- gas provider, has been slowing its deliveries.Samer Mosis, analyst at S& P Global Platts, noted that Asia still needs to build more supply than usual over September and October to reach comfortable levels heading into winter.

The worsening power crunch in China -- perhaps overshadowed by the attention on whether Evergrande will default on its mammoth debts -- reflects extremely tight energy supply globally that’s already seen chaos engulf markets in Europe. The economic rebound from Covid lockdowns has boosted demand from households and businesses as lower investment by miners and drillers constrains production.But China’s energy crisis is partially of its own making as President Xi Jinping tries to ensure blue skies at the Winter Olympics in Beijing next February and show the international community he’s serious about de-carbonizing the economy.
"Asset Based Lending Vs. Cash Flow Based LendingSmall Business | Accounting & Bookkeeping | Cash FlowBy Jared LewisAssessmentAdvantages and disadvantages exist with both types of loans. Asset-based loans may be better for small businesses that simply do not have the available cash flow to account for the amount of money they need. However, the problem with an asset-based loan is that it tends to be more expensive than a cash-flow loan. Asset-based loans usually cost more in terms of fees and interest rates because the borrower has less than optimal credit or does not have the necessary cash flow to get a traditional loan with lower rates and fees."

It looks like SMLP waited long enough to announce the refinance that the market is imploding. Was it really necessary to wait this long?
"Hey Tom. Here's what I think. SMLP will get their refi done in Sep in the 4's. I think the ABL will be fully if not oversubscribed and they will do two or three tranches of notes. This thought is based on my estimate of current mkt conditions and the pricing of similar debt. Even if SMLP only does $800MM they have enough cash and cash flow to pay off bank debt and the 2022's. On a normalized basis where the scalping of product is a net zero, they earn about $2/unit going forward this year per Qtr.

"Natural-gas prices extend losses as EIA reports a weekly supply climb of 83 billion cubic feetPublished: Sept. 16, 2021 at 10:37 a.m. ET By Myra P. SaefongNatural-gas futures extended earlier declines on Thursday after the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported that domestic supplies of natural gas rose by 83 billion cubic feet for the week ended Sept. 10. That was a bit larger than the average increase of 79 billion cubic feet forecast by IHS Markit. Total stocks now stand at 3.006 trillion cubic feet, down 595 billion cubic feet from a year ago and 231 billion cubic feet below the five-year average, the government said. Following the data, October natural gas NGV21, 0.13% was down 17.6 cents, or 3.2%, at $5.284 per million British thermal units. Prices were at $5.299 shortly before the data."

There is a denial by the environmentalists that energy does not flow when the sun don't shine and the wind don't blow. They are unable to accept that fact since it doesn't fit with their head up their #$%$ beliefs.Joe Wallace wrote an article in the Wall Street Journal this morning that is titled:Energy Prices in Europe Hit Records After Wind Stops Blowingincluded the following paragraphs:Natural gas and electricity markets were already surging in Europe when a fresh catalyst emerged: The wind in the stormy North Sea stopped blowing.The sudden slowdown in wind-driven electricity production off the coast of the U.K. in recent weeks whipsawed through regional energy markets. Gas and coal-fired electricity plants were called in to make up the shortfall from wind.
"Europe is finding out what it means to go Green.From the Wall Street Journal By James Marson and Joe Wallace Sept. 22, 2021 7:00 am ETFutures contracts for gas to be delivered in the Netherlands fetched #$%$75.32 a megawatt-hour, about equivalent to $88.41, on Monday. That was their highest level since 2013 and almost seven times their price one year ago. Adding to the upward pressure, American oil-and-gas producers have held back, and droughts in places such as Brazil have curtailed hydropower, prompting a dash to burn gas.Europe?s need for gas is drawing cargoes of American liquefied natural gas, or LNG, across the Atlantic, feeding into higher prices for gas in the U.S. itself. It has also handed more sway to Russia, Europe?s biggest supplier.The jump in prices has drawn complaints from some in Europe that green policies can raise costs on consumers. The cost for an EU permit to emit a metric ton of CO2 hit #$%$60 in August for the first time, which is especially painful for countries that rely on coal to produce electricity, particularly Poland.?Nobody wants to invest in natural gas in Europe,? said Christoph Merkel, managing director at German consulting firm Merkel Energy, pointing to climate policy as one factor.Gas production in Europe has declined precipitously in recent years, leaving Europe more dependent on fuel from Russia, Norway and the U.S."
"feedback loops are impressive once they get started. Here is my favorite paragraph from the Wall Street Journal article of this morning:Electricity, gas, coal and carbon markets have a way of feeding on one another. High gas prices prompted utilities to burn more coal, so they had to buy more emissions allowances. Expensive carbon permits then prodded energy companies to turn back to gas, whose price rose again because the fuel is in short supply."

"At a hearing before the U.S. Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, FERC nominee Willie Phillips expressed a need to balance timely review of natural gas infrastructure permitting with FERC analysis of climate change and environmental justice impacts in order to survive judicial scrutiny, particularly given recent D.C. Circuit Court decisions that have found deficiencies in such reviews. Mr. Phillips noted that he believes in an ""all-of-the above strategy"" with respect to FERC's work, emphasized that the commission functions principally as an economic regulator, and that FERC has a moral ethical obligation to address climate change as the U.S. undertakes an energy transition. Mr. Phillips also indicated that he views energy reliability, sustainability and affordability as legs on a ""three-legged stool"", with attention required to ensure each of the three is balanced. No public opposition or meaningful pushback was expressed by committee members during the hearing, pointing to a reasonably high likelihood of eventual confirmation (energy committee confirmation vote and then full chamber vote). Although timing is uncertain, Committee Chairman Sen. Manchin indicated that he is confident based on dialogue with senators that Mr. Phillips would be confirmed."
"By Chen Aizhu, Jessica Jaganathan and Scott DiSavinoSINGAPORE/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Major Chinese energy companies are in advanced talks with U.S. exporters to secure long-term liquefied natural gas (LNG)supplies, as soaring gas prices and domestic power shortages heighten concerns about the country's fuel security, several sources said.At least five Chinese firms, including state major Sinopec Corp and China National Offshore Oil Company (CNOOC) and local government-backed energy distributors like Zhejiang Energy, are in discussions with U.S. exporters, mainly Cheniere Energy and Venture Global, the sources told Reuters.The discussions could lead to deals worth tens of billions of dollars that would mark a surge in China's LNG imports from the United States. At the height of Sino-U.S. trade war in 2019, gas trade briefly came to a standstill."

"The net result of -19.7 million looks rather weak at first glance and may have contributed to yesterday's share price loss.However, if you take a closer look at the ER, they do not reflect SMLP's actual earnings strength.Net result -19.7 millionProvisions for Blacktail 19.3 MioTransaction costs 0,45 MioFinancing costs EE 2,2 Mio (x)Net result corrected 2,25 Mio(x) Not reported, but also an extraordinary charge against earnings due to increased financing requirements without business operations at present.According to ER, a further 42.8 million was invested in the 2nd quarter. On average, about 160 million capital was thus tied up in EE in Q2, which, assuming a interest rate of 5.5%, for SN means a cost of capital of around 2.2 million.I have not taken into account the special effect from the write-down of the 12.2 million on the warrants, because these are common means of hedging, so for me they are part of normal business. However, this is only my personal interpretation."

"I'm hoping the dividend gets reinstated sooner than everyone is talking about. Shortly after I bought into Altus Midstream, they declared a dividend of $1.50/ share. They have maintained a quarterly dividend of $1.50 ever since. This amounted to a roughly 15% yield at the time of the announcement. The thing is, no one was expecting dividends to resume so quickly. Most people thought that the dividend wouldn't happen until after the Permian Highway Pipeline came online. Instead, they declared the dividend resumption in December 2020, 1 month before the Permian Highway went online. Hopefully, the same thing will happen with Summit and the Double E."

"more paragraphs from the Wall Street Journal article of this morning:At their peak, U.K. electricity prices had more than doubled in September and were almost seven times as high as at the same point in 2020. Power markets also jumped in France, the Netherlands and Germany.Prices for power to be dispatched the next day rocketed to £285 a megawatt hour in the U.K. when wind speeds dropped last week, according to ICIS. That is equivalent to $395 a megawatt hour and marked a record on figures going back to 1999.In electricity markets, the cost of generation at the most expensive supplier determines prices for everyone. That means that when countries derive power from thermal plants with comparatively high running costs, it boosts prices for the whole market. Operating costs at fossil-fuel power plants are high right now after a relentless climb in prices for gas, coal and carbon permits."

The continent is running out of time to refill storage facilities before the start of the winter as flows from top suppliers Russia and Norway remain limited. There’s also a fight for shipments of liquefied natural gas, with Asia buying up cargoes to meet its own demand."
Looks like they closed the 700m note offering. If I’m reading correctly at 8.5% interest rate? That’s higher than most expected I think. Hopefully closing it at least gets rid of the cloud. I’m expecting upside to Wells connected and to flow through this quarter with additional upside guidance. Should push this through $50.
