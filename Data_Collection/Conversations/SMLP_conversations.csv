"Henry Hub gas for November delivery gained 11.7%, the biggest gain since September 2020, to $5.898 per million British thermal units. Prices are bouncing back from recent declines, though they’re still shy of 12-year settlement high reached earlier this month. Traders were closing out bearish positions before November options expire on Tuesday."
"Great article just posted on Seeking Alpha:Summit Midstream: With The Refinancing Completed, This Is A Good Way To Play Natural Gas"
"I am glad the company is finally getting their refinancing done but I am not as optimistic as some of you regarding the path forward. First, the interest expense on the $700M loan would eat up almost the entire adjusted EBITDA for the last quarter. Second, many of their counterparty contracts expire in 2023 so those will need to be renegotiated sooner rather than later. Third, while the company has identified 4 key focus areas for future growth, they have one legacy area (Piceance Basin) which accounted for 13% of total revenues and 32% of adjusted EBITDA, and output in that segment has dropped consistently for several quarters. I acknowledge that the maintenance costs for the legacy assets are low but the company also must consider that at some point the value of those assets must be adjusted for current operating levels (i.e. writedowns). Given that background I would not be a fan of a new acquisition until the company is able to enhance their current assets to avoid future writedowns. How they do this probably entails many options over each operating unit. So my thinking is that the company should first look at ways to increase idle capacity on their current system before engaging in acquiring new assets. So if I were thinking outside the box, here is one suggestion that might be explored. In the Piceance Basin the company has two major customers in Caerus Oil & Gas and Terra Energy Partners. Maybe SMLP could negotiate a joint venture drilling program with one of them to increase the volume of gas on their existing pipelines. SMLP would earn addition income from the sale of the gas and the added volumes on their gathering and processing systems would also generate additional income. With natural gas prices likely to stay high for some time the risks might be acceptable. Just one thought......"
"Dieter 1) The pipeline rupture charge was taken in Q22) There are only about 6 months of amortization of 2022 and 9 months of unamortized bank loan costs to take in Q43) The costs and discount of the new notes are amortized over the lifetime of the new notes not in the quarter they are incurred4) Startup costs for Double E are capitalized to the extent they occur before first revenueFor the first time in years the earnings release isn't on Friday which is a good signToo bad the rate on the new notes is so high, but beggars can't be choosersProduct transmission should be better which pretty much goes straight to the bottom lineThat being said the bondholders and ECP still have stock to sell"
"FERC noted gas futures in New England for January-February 2022 were trading over $21 per million British thermal units, up sharply from $6.78 in January-February 2021 and a five-year (2017-2021) average of $5.79.FERC expects gas-fired plants will generate about 52% of New England's power and 47% in New York this winter.Glick told utilities to line up fuel supplies because the Northeast does not have enough gas pipeline capacity for both heating and power generation on the coldest days.Don't be fooled by Glick the #$%$ He wrote a dissenting opinion when the Double E pipeline project finally got approved by FERC.

"BLAST FROM THE PAST ref: M/F (2013)so, The M/F's Investor's website performed an analysis of the ""TOP 10"" Midstream (Pipelines and Processing Plants) companies and their stock prices- to see which companies are providing the Best Returns.

"Stephen Elllis at Morningstar had the following comment in his recent write-up:.U.S. domestic natural gas demand is relatively tepid, but U.S. LNG exports are running atrecord levels, leading to U.S. natural gas prices at multiyear highs. This demand is sustainable, as arethe infrastructure constraints dampening the U.S. supply response in low-cost areas like Appalachia andthe Haynesville. Producers will need to tap resources higher on the cost curve, supporting a highermidcycle price (we recently raised our estimate from $2.80 per thousand cubic feet to $3.30/mcf). U.S.producers will benefit from higher prices, but we see better opportunities in midstream."
"I saw that Gulfport Energy is selling its Utica operation, which I believe is an important upstream customer of SMLP's Ohio Gathering JV: https://marcellusdrilling.com/2021/10/other-stories-of-interest-fri-oct-15-2021/Anyone have any thoughts about this being an acquisition target for SMLP? Deneke raised the idea of buying complementary assets on the Q1 call, and Ross Wong talked about it again on the Q2 call."
"After the short gains after the information on the SN2026 on October 13, the price has fallen by 25%.Since the market has resented the 8.5% interest tremendously and the chart technique after the break of the upward trend since October 2020 is also added.Prevention of the risk of insolvency - not interestedPositive development on the gas market - is Mr. market currently completely irrelevantWhat are the effects of ""interest rates"" and ""gas market""?My rough assessment:Interest rates add approx. 7 million to the 234 million of SN22 to be redeemed. Since I cannot see the conditions of the other loans to be redeemed or the additional interest payments, I can only estimate.Overall, I expect additional financing costs of 20-25 million.The development of the gas market should lead to higher sales and thus earnings, both for the existing plants and for Double E. I assume about 5% higher sales (also for Double E) and thus about 25-30 million. 12.5-15 million profit should remain.So for 2022, I now expect pre-tax earnings to be about 8-10 million lower. Not nice, but it does not change the significantly better outlook from 2022 and is certainly not a reason for this share price drop."

"At a hearing before the U.S. Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, FERC nominee Willie Phillips expressed a need to balance timely review of natural gas infrastructure permitting with FERC analysis of climate change and environmental justice impacts in order to survive judicial scrutiny, particularly given recent D.C. Circuit Court decisions that have found deficiencies in such reviews. Mr. Phillips noted that he believes in an ""all-of-the above strategy"" with respect to FERC's work, emphasized that the commission functions principally as an economic regulator, and that FERC has a moral ethical obligation to address climate change as the U.S. undertakes an energy transition. Mr. Phillips also indicated that he views energy reliability, sustainability and affordability as legs on a ""three-legged stool"", with attention required to ensure each of the three is balanced. No public opposition or meaningful pushback was expressed by committee members during the hearing, pointing to a reasonably high likelihood of eventual confirmation (energy committee confirmation vote and then full chamber vote). Although timing is uncertain, Committee Chairman Sen. Manchin indicated that he is confident based on dialogue with senators that Mr. Phillips would be confirmed."
"I think that all EPS estimates and actual results in 2021 have little meaning.At the moment, everything is falsified by special effects:Q3-Aug 5 settlement costs for claims due to a 2015 pipeline rupture - totaling 36.25 mln-Construction costs Double E, There will certainly be no profit in Q3 - unless SMLP makes write-ups on fixed assets, which I doubt.So I estimate a quarterly loss between 35 and 40 mln or about $3.50 to $4.00/sh. Knowing SMLP's measure, this is not ""disappointing"" and certainly not a ""disaster"", but simply the price for management's much needed ""clean-up"".The fact that analysts are forecasting positive results despite the above-mentioned factors is very suspicious to me and will probably lead to a share price setback after the Q3 report is published. The same as already happened after the Q2 ER.Q4-Cost of issuing the 2026 senior notes.If those were issued at $98.50 for $100 par, that means an immediate shortfall in proceeds/loss of 1.5% - so 10.5 mln. Then add to that the ancillary costs.-Costs of repaying the 2022 SNotes and other borrowings, rather more expensive than 10.5 mln.-Establishment costs and start-up costs Double EThis means a loss in Q4 as well, most likely, and again absolutely not surprising.The year 2021 may deliver a slightly positive result on an adjusted basis, but the net result will be clearly negative. In 2022, the real profitability of SMLPs will be evident and the stock will approach its fair value. ."

Looks like they closed the 700m note offering. If I’m reading correctly at 8.5% interest rate? That’s higher than most expected I think. Hopefully closing it at least gets rid of the cloud. I’m expecting upside to Wells connected and to flow through this quarter with additional upside guidance. Should push this through $50.
