"Know what you own and don't get rattled with gyrations. If you don't need the money today why sell at a loss knowing you are cutting your own throat because it will go back up. Again we all hate to be behind and analyst cut targets to fill their own boat and other interest parties they support. Don't give them the benefit of becoming a fat cat off of your panic sell. Know the game and stay the course imho. Or else sell at the absolute low. I don't need the money and I don't trade on margin so I can stay as long as needed. Granted I'm 50 years old, but I have learned by painful experience about jumping ship and selling when I should have rode it out. Just my 2 cents for the very little it's worth."
"Many of the larger companies are likely to increase spending less than 5%, according to IHS Markit. Meanwhile, the companies set to increase spending the most are the smaller, private producers that kept oil production growing in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico this year.In that region, the most active U.S. oil field, production has almost reached pre-pandemic levels, while the country as a whole is still about 1.5 million barrels shy of that mark, U.S. data show. Output in other regions has stagnated or declined this year.Ken Waits, CEO of Mewbourne Oil Co., one of the largest private oil producers in the Permian Basin, said during the pandemic last year his company idled 10 of the 12 drilling rigs it had running before the virus hit. Now, it is running 19 rigs, and expects to prop up more next year."
"Global natural gas shortages, record gas and coal prices, a power crunch in China and a three-year high on oil prices all tell one story - demand for energy has roared back and the world still needs fossil fuels to meet most of those energy needs.""The demand fall during the pandemic was entirely linked to governments' decision to restrict movements and had nothing to do with the energy transition,"" Cuneyt Kazokoglu, head of oil demand analysis at FGE told Reuters.""The energy transition and decarbonisation are decade-long strategies and do not happen overnight.""Energy transition policies have come under fire for the run up in energy prices. In some places, they are having an impact, such as in Europe where high carbon prices aimed at reducing emissions have made utilities reluctant to switch on coal-fired plants to alleviate the shortage.In China, policies to reduce emissions have contributed to the government's decision to ration energy to heavy industry."
"Today's announcement is a big one! Confirms the lending consortium is on board with management's liability reduction strategy and has not only loosened covenants to give them more flexibility, but provided a line to retire the 22 bond issue in full. As such, the risk of bankruptcy anytime soon has been substantially reduced. Assuming a 10% depletion in EBITDA for 2021, still looking at Free Cash Flow of about $25MM/quarter (or $4/unit) to work on the balance sheet. As such, the common has tremendous upside as they continue to execute their strategy. As of 9/30/20, the book value was $92/share and is likely now over $100/share with subsequent debt settlements. So basically, the units are trading at about 15 cents on the dollar, which appears extremely cheap for the improving survival odds. As far as the preferreds, dividends are restricted by the debt agreement and this will likely continue for a quite a while, and other than the tender offer, limited liquidity. So not a good hold, but make your own decision on that. GL longs."
"Some nice percentage data from the FERC document:Double E reported that the pipeline was lowered-in to the ditch along approximately 75 percent of Line T100, 100 percent of Line T200, and approximately 95 percent of Line L100. In addition, approximately 65 percent of the Line T100 ROW, 99 percent of the Line T200 ROW, and 85 percent of the Line L100 ROW were backfilled. Restoration of the Line T100 ROW was well underway, with approximately 25 percent of the ROW final graded, and 15 percent was seeded and stabilized with mulch. Approximately 99 percent of the Line T200 ROW was final graded and 95 percent was seeded and stabilized with mulch. Lastly, approximately 25 percent of the Line L100 was final graded and 0 percent was seeded and stabilized with mulched."
I suspect that a lot of the trading volume this morning is former bond holders wanting to get out of the equity. Current market trading liquidity will allow some of them to flip out of the security. The converted bond holders need to be cleaned out before we can see any real progress on price per share.
"Both Gunvor, the biggest independent trader of liquefied natural gas, and Mercuria, a major power and gas trader, asked banks for additional credit to fund margin calls arising from their hedging positions, said the people, who asked not to be named because the information is private.Gunvor received margin calls of about $1 billion in total for its gas and LNG trading positions and has paid that out in the last few months, one of the people said. The company has about $3 billion in readily available liquidity to cover obligations, according to the person."

"Europe’s energy crisis goes from bad to worse as Dutch and U.K. natural gas prices see double-digit gains written by Barbara Kollmeyer Wed, September 15, 2021, 9:01 AM for MarketWatchEurope’s energy crisis deepened on Wednesday, with natural gas futures in Europe and the U.K. soaring by double digits, while a fire at a electricity converter station that connected France to England. European benchmark natural gas prices have soared 287% year to date, driven by a shortage of supplies from Russia, which is using more of its own natural gas; a lack of U.S. supply due to hurricanes disrupting refineries; a heat wave in the U.K. and elsewhere that has disrupted wind power; and hurricanes knocking out supplies from the U.S. Gulf of Mexico."

Be careful shorts. SMLP is out marketing a number of non-core assets for sale. And the market for these assets is picking up. They announce a sale and this will jump up quickly.

"Help me out here guys. In the 4Q report, the company states that it intends to reduce ,""Outstanding Indebtedness"", by $130-150 million dollars. Does that mean they will literally payoff a total of 130-150 million in debt ? They paid off debt in 2020 at an ,""Average Discounted rate of 67%. Should they intend to do the same thing in 2021, the amount they would payoff would be $390-450 million.

"There was an interesting article today on Seeking Alpha. The author guesstimates a price target of $125 with a dividend of $12.42 for 2022. He sees dividends rising each year before reaching $18.32 in 2026. This is after a gradual debt reduction of almost 50% by 2026. This is also on the low end of the spectrum, with the high end being $5/unit higher. As for refinancing, he states,""The upside from current prices is significant enough that even an imperfect financing with some dilution and/or higher interest costs could still result in an excellent return."""
I think the SMPH bondholders are almost out. SMLP did the Double E financing like they said and soon hopefully SMLP will do $400MM secured debt at today's pricing.

I saw an article speculating on this subject as SRE is moving forward with an LNG export facility in Baja, CA, for cheaper shipping costs to Asia, and their thought was this would increase demand for the permian supply resulting in increased demand for the Piceance supply. Hopefully, this deal will come together this quarter. GL"
The Double E route extends ~ 130 miles through the core of theDelaware Basin and is located in close proximity to ~ 30 naturalgas processing plants with over 10 Bcf/d of processing capacity.The Double E pipeline has potential to significantly increase its original 1.35 Bcf/d of throughput capacity. With natural gas currently above $4 it will come as no surprise that I expect expansion in 2022.
"By Chen Aizhu, Jessica Jaganathan and Scott DiSavinoSINGAPORE/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Major Chinese energy companies are in advanced talks with U.S. exporters to secure long-term liquefied natural gas (LNG)supplies, as soaring gas prices and domestic power shortages heighten concerns about the country's fuel security, several sources said.At least five Chinese firms, including state major Sinopec Corp and China National Offshore Oil Company (CNOOC) and local government-backed energy distributors like Zhejiang Energy, are in discussions with U.S. exporters, mainly Cheniere Energy and Venture Global, the sources told Reuters.The discussions could lead to deals worth tens of billions of dollars that would mark a surge in China's LNG imports from the United States. At the height of Sino-U.S. trade war in 2019, gas trade briefly came to a standstill."

"Hi all,I took a look at their numbers, presentations and some analysts. I think their business will be stable this year and they will have a very good run starting in Q1 or Q2 2021. So what you have now is a very good entry level. They may go down or up this year, but I don't care since I am looking further into the future.Here is why:- I trust much more in the new management than what they had before- there main problem are debth and they did a really good job reducing debth and costs this year; I expect them to continue this successfully- they had no major loss in Q2 even though their customers reduced their businness activities due to Covid- I expect Ebitda to recover starting in Q1 since their customers plan to go online again and energy demand will grow- in Q3/21, their new double e pipeline together with Exxon will go online and I expect that this will further grow their EbitdaConsider that their market capitalisation is extremely low compared to the business they run. This means that just small increases in profitability may lead to high earnings compared to share price and they are doing a good job in enhancing profitability.I don't expect them ever to go back to 50, but far beyond 3 could be easily be possible in the next two years.What do you think?"

Expensive carbon permits then prodded energy companies to turn back to gas, whose price rose again because the fuel is in short supply."

But flaring there has declined with recent oil bust, falling in May to the lowest level since 2017, according to consultancy Rystad Energy."
There is approximately zero chance of XOM selling its interest in Double E. That would increase their cost of transport by the equity rate on the pipeline vs. XOM'S 1% cost of funds.

"498 units traded early this morning and the price per unit went up $1.35, which is 3.74%. Always put limits on your orders to either buy or sell. If you place an open market order for SMLP without limits you are just asking to get screwed."
So if the earnings call update on Double E is an extension of the open season (meaning they didn’t fully subscribe the pipe and haven’t raised any capital to go build the pipe) then do the units trade in the 7s?

Let us hope this is not just another pump and dump! I have zero confidence in Zacks.Estimates have actually risen so much that the stock now has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) suggesting this relatively unloved stock could be due for a breakout soon. This will be especially true if SMLP stock can build momentum from here and find a way to continue higher of off this encouraging trading development.
"The net result of -19.7 million looks rather weak at first glance and may have contributed to yesterday's share price loss.However, if you take a closer look at the ER, they do not reflect SMLP's actual earnings strength.Net result -19.7 millionProvisions for Blacktail 19.3 MioTransaction costs 0,45 MioFinancing costs EE 2,2 Mio (x)Net result corrected 2,25 Mio(x) Not reported, but also an extraordinary charge against earnings due to increased financing requirements without business operations at present.According to ER, a further 42.8 million was invested in the 2nd quarter. On average, about 160 million capital was thus tied up in EE in Q2, which, assuming a interest rate of 5.5%, for SN means a cost of capital of around 2.2 million.I have not taken into account the special effect from the write-down of the 12.2 million on the warrants, because these are common means of hedging, so for me they are part of normal business. However, this is only my personal interpretation."
"Tom..... I'm wondering if the delay in announcing the new financing doesn't have something to do with the recent Conoco Philips purchase of Shell's Permian Assets. For the last several quarters, Summit has been hinting about wanting to do some form of acquistion. This is about the same time that Conoco was negotiating with Shell. It so happens that Conoco's new acreage in the same area as the Double E. Just thinking out loud."

"REFLECTIONS:Posted on Yahooooo by, ""John""""The Stock was less than $10.oo a share when they made the DIVI announcement (03/21). So, it's gone from $10.oo to $50.oo. That 5×Jump tells us its real.

"Well, I finally caved before the bell yesterday and sold everything. :( I know that I said that I'd wait till 6 ps but the reality is that I just didn't need the additional big risk burden. MLP's are just not loved right now for even the strongest and best run so I just didn't see gaining back my -35% in short order. So, i added what was left to my ET position since that has much more upside potential. Although it isn't without it's problems either. My time horizon is about 20 years and my MLP bets need to line up with that reality. SMLP is more of a trader's game and not part of a retirement plan. Take care!!"
Why are all of the (ExxonMobil) T100 Big Eddy Meter Station “Husky” construction completion parameters showing zero percent? Who has responsibility for construction of that meter station?
I neglected to add that the 50MM of cash flow from Double E won't be available to the parent for about 3 years
Yippee
TOTAL speculation on my part but here goes. SMLP should buy out the 30% share of the pipeline from Exxon Mobil Corporation. Require that the MVC with Exxon be kept intact. Have Summit complete the Big Eddy facility.This would allow Exxon to claim a reduction in green house emissions. Summit would expand their operation on an existing project.As I stated; pure conjecture.
Would anyone like to speculate on why the company still has not issued the $700-750 million of notes outlined in their 2nd quarter financial report? There are only 3 weeks left before the end of the quarter. I believe the $400 million ABL Revolver was conditioned on issuing these notes. Any idea what happens if the notes are not issued? Management indicated this was their top priority but so far only crickets. I have a fairly sizeable position in the common and don't want to see it drop back into the teens like we saw a few months ago. Management has recently delivered on all of their promises but none that are bigger than this one. Interested to hear comments from other stakeholders......
"Sold off a while ago to hold cash. Back in like Flynn today. Market has not yet realized what today's announcement means for this company. No bankruptcy risk anymore.

"I think one needs to read the 10-K to fully understand the press release:1. SMLP buys SMP plus 5.4 m shares in SMLP from ECP for 35m and 10m warrants.2. SMP owns (i) the GP, (ii) 45.8 m shares in SMLP, (iii) the 180 DPPO receivable and (iv) some cash on hand.3. SMP owes to third party lenders 158m under a term loan, which is secured by 34.x m shares in SMLP.Result:1. SMLP has (indirectly) bought the DPPO receivable and 51.2m shares (45.8 m indirectly and 5.4m directly) in itself plus some cash on hand.2. SMLP has assumed (indirectly) the term loan obligation.Which means for 35m and 10 warrants it got net 22m less debt on a consolidated basis and 51.m shares worth about 40-50m. That means it can stop payment dividends for some time without triggering a default under the term loan and just pay off that term loan instead of the DPPO. That should stabilize SMLP and is not a bad deal once markets recover."
If I buy today can I get in on the dividend?

"The additional 1.35 Bcf/d of capacity that will be provided by the Double E pipeline is essentially equal to the total current company volumes. Remember that the Double E can (and I believe will be) increased to 1.85 Bcf/d. 2022 is going to be an awesome year for Summit Midstream Partners, LP."
Since the pipeline is moving forward there must be extreme confidence by them as well as their financial partners. There is no way this would have gotten off the ground if their finances were weakening. They can easily pay the parent with a combination of profits as well as their credit line of almost one billion...many companies get waivers to exceed leverage limits when the risk is limited. A pipeline with long term contracts is as close to guaranteed as you can get

Ok peeps where do we go from here??? On the fence about this! Debt issues and now oil price coming down! Concerned!
Two facts that an oil bull told me several years ago have sustained me during the rough times. He said SMLP had the means to pay their dividends/distributions AND any company that partners with Exxon usually is successful. Those two comments gave me the information I needed to keep adding units at the darkest of hours.Now I am being rewarded for believing those two comments.
"Hey, I recently bought 20,000 shares of Summit and thought I would share the analysis I did that convinced me. I mean, we are sitting on a gold mine here, minimal risk, very high potential return. If you look at the equity book value vs the equity fair value of competitors you will find this:Kinder Morgan: Book $31.9 billions vs market $31.7 billionsEnterprise products: $26.1B book vs $45.8B marketTC Energy: $33.9B (Canadian$) book vs $53B marketAltus Midstream: $73M book vs $200M marketSo basically, we can say that the other companies in the sector are trading at a minimum their equity book value per share. What about Summit:Equity Book value of $700M (my estimate for the Feb 26th earning - that considers the gain on short-term loan repayment) vs $80M market value (ouch)We are looking at an easy 5 bagger from here, and most likely in 2021. I believe the main catalysts will be the completion of the Double E project, refinancing of the 2022 bonds and revolving credit facility, and then reinstating a dividend (I am estimating $10 per share easily). Reddit guys are missing the point. Instead of paying way too much for compagnies, why don't look for really undervalued companies"

"In addition to the 303.5mil DPPO, their current ratio is 0.23. From the balance sheet data it appears that they are 285 mil short in their current obligations. Additionally, their dividend obligation (assuming Div remains the same) over the next five quarters is 117 mil. This makes total cash liabilities 705 million over the next five quarters. Cash flow from operations for the same period should be about 500 million give or take. So, SMLP is 200 million in a hole. Issuing new debt would be extremely costly, if possible, considering their current leverage. Issuing shares at this price would be a disaster. Therefore, I believe that a dividend elimination is mandatory, coming, and the best thing for the long term prospects of the company. Let me know whant do you think."

Non-U.S. LNG exporters haven’t been pitching in as much supply because of various maintenance-related snags. Europe, in particular, is in a precarious position heading into winter as Russia, its most important natural- gas provider, has been slowing its deliveries.Samer Mosis, analyst at S& P Global Platts, noted that Asia still needs to build more supply than usual over September and October to reach comfortable levels heading into winter.

"Asset Based Lending Vs. Cash Flow Based LendingSmall Business | Accounting & Bookkeeping | Cash FlowBy Jared LewisAssessmentAdvantages and disadvantages exist with both types of loans. Asset-based loans may be better for small businesses that simply do not have the available cash flow to account for the amount of money they need. However, the problem with an asset-based loan is that it tends to be more expensive than a cash-flow loan. Asset-based loans usually cost more in terms of fees and interest rates because the borrower has less than optimal credit or does not have the necessary cash flow to get a traditional loan with lower rates and fees."

"Tom... A belated Thank You for the update on the variance for Double E, I was worried it might be something major. Also, I know, I know, they are Units, not Shares ! For all of you newcomers and lookylous who are curious about the Unit share price jump of 9.90% today, $33.90 after hours. The following Stats are from Yahoo, so be advised, but, P.E. = >.43 , market cap= $210 million, Enterprise vaule= $2.5 billion, P/sales= .30, P/book= .22, Profit margin= 52%, operating margin= 19%, Return on Equity= 21%. Shares outstanding= 6.74 million. One year ago Analysts were worried about a possible B.K., since then the following events have happened. SMLP has paid down a significant amount of it's debt. Near term Bonds (2022) are priced near Par. Negotiations on extending this debt are nearly done and an announcement is expected soon. Preferred Units have also been paid down and are selling above 75% of it's issue price. Finally, The Double E Pipeline is half done and is on track for completion in Q4."
"Had a question concerning the earnings call Q&A on the Double E expected EBITDA generation. The person answered something to the effect of $425MM gross project cost and SMLP has 70%. He then stated 7-7.5x multiple matrix. Am I correct in thinking this is a value multiple to get the asset value of 2.1 billion for SMLP's 70%? Not sure this is right, but taking that number at 7% cap, is about $150MM/yr in projected EBITDA when volume is ramped up. Is this right? If so, that would be a huge increase in EBITDA for 2022 assuming it comes on line in Q4 21. GL"
"For a company that will need to issue more common or preferred units to pay off both off the DPPO and make the cap-x investments its business requires, the current 25% yield is not feasible. Summit will be forced to make a distribution cut (or suspend it entirely), just like earlier in the year when the yield reached then-unsustainable levels. That is the cruel reality for MLPs - the market pummels the unit price as it discounts a distribution cut until it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy."

"Europe is finding out what it means to go Green.From the Wall Street Journal By James Marson and Joe Wallace Sept. 22, 2021 7:00 am ETFutures contracts for gas to be delivered in the Netherlands fetched #$%$75.32 a megawatt-hour, about equivalent to $88.41, on Monday. That was their highest level since 2013 and almost seven times their price one year ago. Adding to the upward pressure, American oil-and-gas producers have held back, and droughts in places such as Brazil have curtailed hydropower, prompting a dash to burn gas.Europe?s need for gas is drawing cargoes of American liquefied natural gas, or LNG, across the Atlantic, feeding into higher prices for gas in the U.S. itself. It has also handed more sway to Russia, Europe?s biggest supplier.The jump in prices has drawn complaints from some in Europe that green policies can raise costs on consumers. The cost for an EU permit to emit a metric ton of CO2 hit #$%$60 in August for the first time, which is especially painful for countries that rely on coal to produce electricity, particularly Poland.?Nobody wants to invest in natural gas in Europe,? said Christoph Merkel, managing director at German consulting firm Merkel Energy, pointing to climate policy as one factor.Gas production in Europe has declined precipitously in recent years, leaving Europe more dependent on fuel from Russia, Norway and the U.S."

"I'm hoping the dividend gets reinstated sooner than everyone is talking about. Shortly after I bought into Altus Midstream, they declared a dividend of $1.50/ share. They have maintained a quarterly dividend of $1.50 ever since. This amounted to a roughly 15% yield at the time of the announcement. The thing is, no one was expecting dividends to resume so quickly. Most people thought that the dividend wouldn't happen until after the Permian Highway Pipeline came online. Instead, they declared the dividend resumption in December 2020, 1 month before the Permian Highway went online. Hopefully, the same thing will happen with Summit and the Double E."
"So here is what I think the situation is. Over the next couple of years they will have to come up with $180 million for the DPPO and $105 million for EE.So if they produce $300 million per year in EBITDA and have $180 million per year in interest, CAPX, and preferred dividends, then even if they cut the distribution to $0, they will only be able to satisfy $240 million of the $285 million of obligations.That math is a problem"

"Neil A. Chapman, Exxon Mobil Corporation - SVP------------------------------ Well, I thank you for the question. And I agree with your last comment. I think it is key to doing it differently. And to elaborate now as to what Darren just said about how we're acting as a corporation, we're acting differently in the Permian Basin. But in terms of the Big Eddy and the Poker Lake, I mean, it's interesting you're asking the question on what's next. They are so large. I mean they are so large. I talked about the 10 miles east to west. I mean it's getting up towards 50 miles north to south. So there is an extraordinary resource base to capture there. That's going to keep us going, as I said in the discussion, through the next 20 years plus at the rates we were drilling at in the fourth quarter of this year and the first -- fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year. So it's an incredible resource. Now what we do all the time is we look for value-based opportunities in the -- in the Midland and the Delaware. And they can be small opportunities, what I call bolt-on acreage, where it adds more value to us than it is for the person who's selling. But what we're not doing is going after checkerboard acreage everywhere. To get the capital efficiency that we're already demonstrating, a key component -- and I would tell you, it's not the only component, but a key component is having large, contiguous acreage over good rocks. Not all rocks are equal in the Permian, and you've seen that demonstrated by the results across the industry. So what's really, really important to me is we focus on developing what we've got because it is extremely large, and we are finding that more and more of these benches are prospective. And so we've got a lot of running room in the Big Eddy and Poker Lake, and that will be our priority. We look for bolt-ons all the time. We've added bolt-ons even in the last year. We do swaps all of the time. But it really comes for anything larger than that if the opportunity set comes up. Frankly, unless he tells me differently, I don't feel the need to because we have some running room in what we've got."
"ALF you don't have a clue. Even supposing sellers of bonds might believe so, the buyers did not. What really was the case in the MLP sector is that the holders of the bonds were mutual funds that had a statutory ""margin call"" because they were levered greater than permissible. One purchases investments to maximize there return. Here and now in SMLP common and preferred that will be mostly capital gain, so what. Despite your repeated Dunning-Kruger award winning analysis, SMLP is profitable; it can pay its CAPEX and the bonds as they mature. It is profitable even as a stand alone entity without Double E."
"SINGAPORE, Oct 11 (Reuters) - China's ENN Natural Gas Co. Ltd said on Monday it has signed a 13-year long-term deal to buy liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Cheniere Energy , the top LNG exporter from the United States."
"These excerpts are from the Energy Transfer earnings call:Gathered gas volumes were 13.1 million MMBtus per day, compared to 13 million MMBtus per day for the same period last year due to higher volumes in the PermianAnd for our intrastate segment, adjusted EBITDA was $224 million, compared to $187 million in the second quarter of last year. This was primarily due to demand volume ramp-ups in the Permian and an increase in retained fuel revenues, as well as a $39 million increase from revenues related to Winter storm Uri. There is no doubt that Uri created much more demand for our pipeline and storage network, and we are seeing this reflected in incoming calls and discussions with existing and new customers who are looking to lock in firm transport and/or storage agreements."

It also comes amid growing concerns about energy reliability, with prices for natural gas surging because of tighter supplies.In 2020 alone, Dominion Energy Inc. and Duke Energy Corp. scrapped an $8 billion Atlantic Coast gas project, and Williams Cos. abandoned its Constitution gas pipeline and its Northeast Supply Enhancement plan.

"U.S. natural gas prices hit a 13-year high last week as the energy crunch in Europe and Asia pushed the prices in these two regions to the highest on record. And depending on winter weather, U.S. natural gas prices do have more room to rise. But they are unlikely to follow the skyrocketing rallies of the European and UK gas prices and the price of spot liquefied natural gas (LNG) in Asia, analysts say. Although the regional natural gas markets are now interconnected more than ever thanks to the LNG trade, U.S. gas prices will largely be spared the extreme volatility and record-high European and Asian prices.The United States has a fairly adequate natural gas supply in storage ahead of the winter. This is unlike Europe, where depleted inventories and rebounding demand have created a rush to stock up for the coldest months of the year, which in turn has caused a supply crunch and record-high gas and power prices.Moreover, U.S. natural gas production is rising slightly, while weekly injections into storage over the past month have been higher than usual for September.Despite the record LNG prices in Asia and the handsome netbacks that U.S. exporters are getting for their LNG cargoes, the United States has a certain capacity to feed gas to its LNG export terminals. All cargoes available will be scooped up, mostly by Asia, but the infrastructure will not allow too much incremental LNG supply out of America that would have severely tightened the domestic U.S. market."

MalikThu, September 9, 2021, 12:08 PM(Bloomberg) -- California is asking the federal government to declare an “electric reliability emergency” so the Golden State can lean more heavily on fossil fuels to avoid blackouts.The state’s main grid operator wants the U.S. Department of Energy to suspend air-pollution rules for some natural gas-burning power plants in case their output is needed “to meet demand in the face of extremely challenging conditions including extreme heat waves, multiple fires, high winds, and various grid issues,” according to a filing."

"Josyana Joshua Wed, September 8, 2021, 10:11 AM wrote this for Bloomberg:(Bloomberg) -- U.S. natural gas futures soared to a seven-year high amid escalating concerns about tight supplies heading into the winter-heating season.Gas prices are soaring across the northern hemisphere as anxiety mounts about the prospects of a supply crunch in coming weeks when cold weather begins to descend and homeowners switch on furnaces. A confluence of production and processing disruptions are running headlong into robust demand for the fuel in some of the world’s biggest economies.Gas for October delivery rose as much as 9.7% to $5.01 per million British thermal units in New York on Wednesday, a level not seen since unprecedented cold gripped North America during the Polar Vortex of early 2014.In Phoenix and Los Angeles, so-called spot prices jumped to $30 and $20, respectively, according to a source who asked not to be identified. Demand for the fuel is climbing in the U.S. West amid a heat wave that’s lifting consumption of electricity to run air conditioners. European prices are in the midst of a record-setting ascent because deliveries from key producers have been stymied at a time of meager stored supplies.“We’re probably going to go into this coming winter, just the way things were already setting up, with the lowest level of gas in storage since 2014,” said John Kilduff, founding partner of Again Capital LLC.In the U.S. sector of the Gulf of Mexico, about 78% of gas production remains offline more than a week after offshore crews fled to safety ahead of Hurricane Ida’s arrival. The premium for March 2022 gas over April futures -- essentially a bet on how undersupplied the market will be at the end of next winter -- surged as much as 27%."

Another nice day for this under appreciated stock. My guess is that it will continue to move up as the distribution announcement date gets closer.
"@alf Repeating over and over that ECP screwed shareholders while true is prologue. If one can read a financial statement then what SMLP is doing with their cash is clear. Operating cash flow has to cover Capex + Int + Principal. Depreciation affects only income which is why it is added back in the cash flow statement. SMLP on an income basis is slightly profitable even after the regularly scheduled one time items while operating cash flow is $65MM/Q. In the next 7 quarters they have about $350MM of cash flow after interest not including any possible increase from Double E to cover about $250MM of Double E, $30MM of other Capex and about $180MM if they purchase 2022 bonds at 66. This means they have to finance about $110MM on Double E sometime in the next 7 Quarters which is easy when Double E is operating and possible before. In addition if XON purchases 20 percent more per the Double E agreement then this is reduced by $90MM or so. As for the senior debt it is my estimate that they will term outhalf and put hlf in a revolver over another 5 year term. This is an approximation of how SMLP succeeds. They are primarily a gas transmission co and gas capacity is less than demand. That being said there won't be dividends any time soon. As for BK all the prices tell you is there is no demand for this sector. If Bk was expected the bond price would be back in the twenties no here and the stock would be there too. Say any bad about ECP and Goldman Sachs you want; it is probably completely true but it is irrelevant to where the company goes from here"
"My criticism of midstream partner companies in general is outlined below. Not singling out SMLP here, but it seems to be one of the worst offenders. Of course, maybe these companies have hit bottom and are actually a good investment at this level. I have no idea if they will go up or down from here.Here are some of the drawbacks to these midstream partner companies:1. Competition. There are too many of these companies, and they are all competing for the same projects. They tend to under bid based on optimistic assumptions. When those assumptions do not come true, their spreadsheets break, and they end up failing to make money.2. Projects lose value over time. These companies pay a large up front cost to develop the projects, but the projects quickly lose value as the fields they are supporting deplete. If they assume the field will deplete at 15% per year but instead it depletes at 20% per year, a project they thought was profitable could easily become a loser.3. Risk/reward. Midstream take all the risk, but they do not share in the reward. They pay all the money up front to develop the projects, but if the price of oil drops or the fields deplete, they are left with a money losing project as volumes quickly decline. If everything goes perfectly, they make the agreed upon fees, and nothing more. They have very limited up side on the money they make, but they have the potential of losing a lot.4. Return of capital. The dividends are misleading. Most midstream companies do not account properly for depreciation. They pay out a big yield, and they do not retain enough money to pay for the next projects that will replace the depreciating projects. It depends on the company, but a significant portion of the dividend is actually return of capital. The big yield is an illusion.5. Financial tricks. It is sometimes difficult to tell if these companies are actually earning money. They play a lot of financial games, they are very leveraged, and depreciation is a big factor. Many investors have made up special metrics to measure midstream companies. These special metrics have been a disaster. One of the worst is the ""coverage ratio"". It is supposed to measure how much of the dividend is covered by cash flow. It is useless because it does not account for how much of the cash flow is needed to replace depreciating assets."
"Double E UpdateAs of today, construction of the Double E Pipeline is approximately 60% complete and all of the identified complex construction activities have been completed. The project is progressing ahead of schedule and costs continue to track well below budget. Summit continues to expect that it will commission Double E and commence service in the fourth quarter of 2021."
"This comes from U.S. Energy Information Administration and can be found at https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/production/sub-topic-01.php""Domestic natural gas production in the Reference case also returns to pre-pandemic levels starting in 2023. In the long term, production continues to grow during the entire projection period, driven by end-use consumption and opportunities to sell natural gas internationally through LNG exports.Shale gas and associated natural gas from oil plays are the primary contributors to this long-term growth. In the Reference case, more than half of the growth in shale gas production between 2020 and 2050 comes from shale gas plays in the Appalachian Basin in the East region, and most of the remaining growth comes from plays in the Gulf Coast and Southwest regions. Due to the drop in crude oil production, associated natural gas (natural gas produced in primarily oil formations) also decreased in 2020 because of the relatively low crude oil and natural gas prices. EIA projects associated natural gas will return to 2019 levels in 2024 and then steadily increase at a modest rate through 2050, primarily driven by increased drilling in the Permian Basin."""

"Hey Tom. Here's what I think. SMLP will get their refi done in Sep in the 4's. I think the ABL will be fully if not oversubscribed and they will do two or three tranches of notes. This thought is based on my estimate of current mkt conditions and the pricing of similar debt. Even if SMLP only does $800MM they have enough cash and cash flow to pay off bank debt and the 2022's. On a normalized basis where the scalping of product is a net zero, they earn about $2/unit going forward this year per Qtr.

"By Sabrina ValleHOUSTON, Sept 24 (Reuters) - Brazil's imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) are set to hit a record in September, data from Refinitiv and consultancy Kpler shows, as U.S. cargoes normally meant for Europe are diverted to the Latin American nation to address a power shortage.The worst drought in almost a century has starved the hydropower plants that normally supply nearly two-thirds of Brazil's electricity. The country has, as a result, turned to U.S. gas to keep its lights on, with its LNG purchases helping drive global gas prices to record levels.""The strong demand from Brazil means there is less LNG supply being directed to European terminals,"" said Laura Page, senior LNG analyst with Kpler consultancy firm.European gas storage has fallen to its lowest in at least 10 years"

"SMLP Trading at All-Time Lows (since trading began in 2012).Yield approaching 20%.Yet, their assets have never been greater, and more productive.Their distribution is expected to be fully cover in 2019.They expect at least 10% EBITDA growth.Tax loss selling is surely part of the ongoing erosion in share price. Add to that the weakness in oil prices, though SMLP is a pipeline company foremost, not an extraction company, so they are not directly affected by oil price volatility. To wit, their share price didn't explode to the upside as oil went from $50 to $80 in 2018, yet now has tanked to record lows as oil has slid back to late 2018 levels. Go figure..."
"Hello together,Since my first post was completely illegible, which I apologize for, here the whole thing in a clear manner.Enclosed my attempt to calculate the actual results 2020 and 2021 without upfront costs Double E and the result to be expected for 2022 after the commissioning of Double E. Based on this, an estimate of the fair value.The actual yields actually relevant for PE were significantly lower in 2020 and will be the same in 2021. Although these purely operational profits are not suitable as a measurement standard either, because of the upfront costs for Double E.Measured against the size of the company, Double E is quite a large project, as can be seen from the estimates of future profitability. For a company the size of SMLP, this currently means a relatively high burden on earnings.I read the following information from the SMLP reports regarding the capital already invested:01/01/2020 33.9 million / December 31, 2020 132.9 millionMost of the additional 99 million (58 million) were already invested in Q1. Logically these investments have to be financed and generate capital costs. Assuming 5.5% interest (based on the SN), that means around 5.7 million financing costs for 2020 alone. In addition, there should be internal costs and fees, etc. for the supervision and approval of the project. All together approx. 8 millionTogether with the difference of 2.1 million from net income 192.4 million and unusual items 190.3 million, this results in an adjusted profit of approx. 10 million, or 1.65 / sh.A similar result should be expected in 2021. Reduced EBIDTA forecast, but also lower financial costs, but with two possible positive influences on the result:1. General improved business in the NG area2. Possibly first earnings contributions from Double-EIn 2022 with Double E, I see the following effects:1. EBIDTA increase through Double E (direct and indirect in the Permian Basin) by approx. 100 million2. EBIDTA decrease in legacy areas by 30 million3. Depreciation on Double E.SMLP share 70% of 425 million = 300 million depreciation over 10 years *, i.e. 30 million per year.4. Declining financing costs approx. 30 million compared to 2020Total effect on pre-tax profit #$%$ 70 millionIt follows from this for 2022Pre-tax profit approx. 80 million (10 million from current business + 70 million)Net earnings of around 60 million or $ 9.25 / share.CF approx. 200 million or 30.76 / shareSince SMLP is well advised to continue investing because of the declining income from the legacy areas, part of the CF should certainly be used for this. Nevertheless, it should be enough for a dividend of $ 10 / share again at least from 2023.The fair value that results from this is in my opinion at least $ 120All just my opinion as a normally gifted shareholder."
Capital raised FY2019 earnings estimates this week from .38 to .42. Maybe we get a much bigger beat this quarter. Buyers will speculate this back up over 9 bucks in my opinion ahead of July 31st earnings report. After that the numbers and call will dictate the way.

"Gas for October delivery gained 11%, the biggest daily jump since February, settling at $5.706 per million British thermal units, a level not seen since early 2014. Traders were closing out bearish positions ahead of the expiration of October options and futures this week. Shares of gas producers also soared amid broader energy-market gains, with EQT Corp. up as much as 12% and Southwestern Energy Co. climbing 24%.Prices for the heating and power-generation fuel are soaring globally with low stockpiles in Europe and Asia sparking fears of shortages as winter approaches. In the U.S., storm-related supply disruptions have compounded concerns about slow output growth as drillers heed investors’ calls for financial restraint, making it unlikely that shale producers will be able to bail out the rest of the world this winter.“The commodity is getting repriced in terms of its value,” said John Kilduff, founding partner at Again Capital. “There’s such a demand for it around the world.”"

"Good Summary from Motley Fool on SMLP Situation:________What happenedUnits of Summit Midstream Partners (NYSE: SMLP) were down more than 15% as of 10 a.m. EST on Tuesday after the master limited partnership (MLP) unveiled a string of strategic actions aimed at improving its financial position.So whatSummit Midstream's board of directors named current COO Leonard Mallett as interim CEO, replacing Steve Newby, effective immediately. While the board selected Mallett to help provide leadership for the company's new strategic actions, it plans to search for a permanent CEO.Meanwhile, in a widely anticipated move, Summit Midstream slashed its sky-high distribution in half to help improve its financial profile. In addition to that, the company sold its noncore Tioga Midstream gathering system in North Dakota for $90 million to help pre-pay $100 million of the deferred purchase price obligation it owes its parent company for a previous acquisition. Summit Midstream and its parent also agreed to fix the remaining payment, which is due next year, at $303.5 million. Furthermore, they eliminated the costly management fees Summit pays to its parent in exchange for 8.75 million units.These strategic moves will enable Summit Midstream to retain about $85 million of annual incremental cash flow, which it will use to help fund expansion projects. The company anticipates that it will invest $150 million to $175 million in growth capital this year, with its largest project being the construction of a second gas processing plant in the DJ Basin. However, the company and its partner ExxonMobil also expect to move forward with their Double E Pipeline, which would transport natural gas from the Delaware Basin to a hub in Texas. While Exxon will finance part of that pipeline, which is important for supporting its growth in the region, Summit needed to increase its financial flexibility so that it can also participate in this project.Now whatSummit Midstream took a big step toward shoring up its financial situation by selling Tioga Midstream and slashing its distribution. However, the company still has some work to do. Not only does it owe its parent the final payment for a transaction from a few years ago, but it could potentially start construction on Double E with ExxonMobil. Because of those financial obligations, Summit will likely sell additional assets and might have to further reduce its distribution to ensure it has the funds it needs."

"The $303.5 million Deferred Purchase Price Obligation (DPPO) due by the end of next year is what makes Summit such a challenging investment. Summit’s hope is that they’ll be able to raise the money through a combination of cash flow, legacy asset sales and some sort of new issue (either preferred or common units). I don’t think additional debt is an option at this point. As the unit price declines, the likelihood of a new unit issue becomes less and less likely. Selling legacy assets will be challenging in the current O&G market. Meanwhile, the price of oil and gas keeps declining, and the bond market is raising red flags about a possible recession. I bought after the Q1 earnings call, thinking that they might have kitchen-sinked it, but sold just before the Q2 earnings release. I just think the multiple challenges for this name are too much."

The worsening power crunch in China -- perhaps overshadowed by the attention on whether Evergrande will default on its mammoth debts -- reflects extremely tight energy supply globally that’s already seen chaos engulf markets in Europe.

"SMLP trading close to Lifetime-Lows (since IPO in 2012).SMLP has paid regular quarterly dividends since inception (beginning at 0.41/sh, now 0.575/sh).SMLP gave an investor presentation recently, affirming EBITDA growth in 2019 of at least 10%.SMLP expects payout cover to be 1.15 in 2019.They have lots of growth prospects longer term.Their credit rating of BB- is solid, and their debt leverage is moderate.Their shares, now yielding 17%, give the following impressions (all contrary to reality) --- debt downgrade --- lost contracts and bottleneck to cut EBITDA --- div cut imminentIn fact, none of those are issues, leaving one to wonder who is tossing the shares away.The severe decline in SMLP is disproportionate to peers, though the sector has fallen on the swift decline in US Oil Prices.But US oil prices are low not because demand has vanished, but because supply keeps surging.SMLP pipelines are needed to move those supplies.They secure long-term contracts for pipeline movement of NG and Oil. They have minor exposure to commodity prices.So, it is not implausible to look at the current price and yield of SMLP and believe there is a mis-valuation of share price."
We are making nice progress ( PR today )

Question for some who knows the bond market well. Will SMLP have any trouble selling 700 million in bonds at a reasonable rate?I would say no problem because of current bonds selling near par. But I’m not a bond expert.
"Full Disclosure: I'm only here because someone mentioned SMLP in a different stock forum. This person mentioned a 16.00% dividend yield AFTER a dividend cut. Curiosity got the best of me, so I checked out a 5 year chart.After seeing that, I have one question for 'long-term' shareholders. What is wrong with you people ?"
"Would somebody please help me out with my question. What remaining financial/equity obligations does SMLP owe to ECP? The below sentence is from the press release this morning.Energy Capital Partners' full exercise of equity warrants in exchange for 414,477 SMLP common units."
"Tom or Sammie: Quick question, I know Yahoo is a major joke, but I'm having trouble figuring something out from them. They state in their Analyst section that the 4Q earnings was $1.97/share ? I have no idea how they came up with that number. The total number of outstanding shares is 6,100,000, (rounded). The stated earnings from the Company were, Net Income= $103,000,000, Adjusted EBITDA = $61,480,000 and Distributable Cash Flow= $44,800,000. If I divide each of those figures by the number of shares outstanding, ( 6,100,000), I get the following: Net Income = $ 16.89/share, Adjusted EBITDA= $10.08/share and Distributable Cash Flow= $7.34/share. Where am I missing something ? Also, their trailing P.E. is .39 !!!"
"At the moment it seems, that it doesn't matter, if distribution gets cut or not.Look at AM. They kept distribution in line but stock is down nearly 20% since the announcement,."
Steady rise until earnings. Looking for 8.50 to 9 before earnings and buying in before divi.
Nice day. Can we please get refinancing announcement or something.
A dividend cut from a solid company (that's been paying out TOO much) can be a very good thing. You can take your return home in cash or that same cash retained (and put to good use) gives owners more return from share appreciation. I think we track back up from here.
"Since the GP ownership transfer to SMLP and new management taking over the full reins in May 2020, SMLP has completed a bond tender offer realizing a 42% discount to face value eliminating net indebtedness $55MM as of 6/30/20 (per Q2 press release). The Q2 press release further states that subsequent to 6/30/20, company repurchased another $5.9MM (face) of bonds at discount eliminating another $2MM of outstanding indebtedness. In July 2020, company completed an exchange for $62.8MM of the preferred shared issue for 12.6MM common shares, or at an 84% discount. Although dividends on this PFD issue have been suspended, this nonetheless eliminates an accruing and future obligation should the company survive of roughly $6MM/yr. On 8/25/20, SMLP launched another tender offer for $60MM of each of its 2022 and 2025 bond issues. This is a Dutch Auction process, but assuming the tender offer is fully subscribed, the minimum reduction in the bond issues would be another $40MM. Further, in early August, the latest presentation reported the $35MM note due the former GP owner, ECP, had also been retired. In all and assuming the current tender offer is fulfilled, it appears long-term indebtedness will have been reduced by $132MM in five months in addition to the partial retirement of preferred shares.That said, the common is extremely risky, but distributable CF ($42MM in Q2) affords management some ability to improve the balance sheet and time to transition to growth areas (Double E project) from the declining legacy assets which no doubt have issues, namely the Piceance Basin. It is also likely to get worse before it gets better, but improved commodity prices would help via returning portfolio shut-ins to production and completion of DUCs, etc. Nevertheless, it should be noted the equity ($40MM market cap) is priced for failure at roughly 1x the Q2 distributable CF. I don’t know how this will turn out (some say not a chance), but if they are able to obtain construction financing, this issue could have some real upside as it frees up CF to continue to address the balance sheet. Management indicates Double E financing is more likely after the FERC certificate is received (expected Q3/early Q4). This JV is with Exxon and the presentation reports “a substantial majority of the 1.35 Bcf/d of throughput capacity is underpinned with 10 year take or pay contracts”. There is also a potential for asset sales to de-leverage. Anyway, extremely speculative, so do your own DD and don’t get too carried away, but there appears to be a chance this turnaround effort will be successful. We’ll see."
"Despite the recent run-up, I'm admittedly still down about 60% on this. Yes, I bought in pre-split and when the dividend exceeded 10%. The initial investment wasn't much, but at this point I'll just hold and see if this can continue to reach new high. GLTALs."

"What's the big worry? There are 8 months to get this done. I am more concerned about dilution that about the refi. Mgmt has been good in dealing with the debt, but not so good about dilution."
thats it. im out. took my 50% loss. with impending recession at hand and the way this stock is trending im done risking and wishing for a bounce back. Good luck to the Longs. Hope things prevail for you.
"Like I said yesterday, don’t expect much from this in the absence of news. That said, I am rosier on this than a lot of folks on the board. That last earnings call took away my largest fears. So not going to get increased heart rate when it trades on very low volume and dips a bit."

"ECP got in lieu of exercising the warrants for cash, shares equal in value to the difference in the strike price ($15) and the market price. Hopefully they sold them and have finally finished their rape of SMLP. I would never invest in anything they sponsored."
It looks like SMLP waited long enough to announce the refinance that the market is imploding. Was it really necessary to wait this long?
"This comes from Zachs:""SMLP is trading at a reasonable valuation. In terms of Price-to-Sales ratio, which is considered as one of the best valuation metrics, the stock looks quite cheap now. SMLP is currently trading at 0.38 times its sales. In other words, investors need to pay only 38 cents for each dollar of sales."""
"more paragraphs from the Wall Street Journal article of this morning:At their peak, U.K. electricity prices had more than doubled in September and were almost seven times as high as at the same point in 2020. Power markets also jumped in France, the Netherlands and Germany.Prices for power to be dispatched the next day rocketed to £285 a megawatt hour in the U.K. when wind speeds dropped last week, according to ICIS. That is equivalent to $395 a megawatt hour and marked a record on figures going back to 1999.In electricity markets, the cost of generation at the most expensive supplier determines prices for everyone. That means that when countries derive power from thermal plants with comparatively high running costs, it boosts prices for the whole market. Operating costs at fossil-fuel power plants are high right now after a relentless climb in prices for gas, coal and carbon permits."

"John KempFri, September 10, 2021, 9:52 AM(John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own)By John KempLONDON, Sept 10 (Reuters) - U.S. gas traders are anticipating a big increase in production over the next year as the industry responds to higher prices by ramping up drilling, which should ensure supplies are more plentiful in time for winter 2022/23.As a result, futures prices for deliveries at Louisiana's Henry Hub in January 2023 are currently trading around $1.15 per million British thermal units below prices for deliveries in January 2022.Henry Hub's one-year calendar spread trades in contango about three-quarters of the time, reflecting the high cost of storing a gaseous commodity with low value to volume, so the current backwardation is unusual.The spread is currently in the 98th percentile for all trading days since the start of 2007, indicating supplies are expected to be exceptionally tight this winter, before improving significantly next year.During the first phase of the epidemic, monthly U.S. dry gas production slumped to just 75 billion cubic metres in June 2020, down from a record 85 billion cubic metres in December 2019.The number of rigs targeting primarily gas-bearing formations slumped to less than 70, from more than 130, over a similar period, according to field services company Baker Hughes.Since then, however, there has been a slow but steady increase in both drilling and production in response to the recovery in gas prices"
