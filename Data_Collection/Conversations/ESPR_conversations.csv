"Well, they marked over 40 million in revs but wow, what a cash burn rate. Maybe they should get the generic tp in the executive bathrooms instead of the designer brand. Have to get expenses under control somehow."

"From Bioinvest newsletter: ESPR recently announced another key hire with the appointment of JoAnne Micale Foody, MD, FACC, FAHA as Chief Medical Officer, effective immediately. She will serve as a member of the executive team and report to CEO Sheldon Koenig. Dr. Foody is a global expert with extensive clinical and medical experience in preventive cardiology, global medical development and medical affairs, which adds greatly to the depth of our management team. Rarely can you find experts who have both stellar academic (Yale/Harvard) and Big Pharma (Merck/JNJ) experience.Dr. Foody joins ESPR after six years with Johnson & Johnson, where she served as Vice President and Head of Data Sciences for Cardiovascular, Metabolism Pulmonary Hypertension and Retinal therapeutic areas where she was responsible for Janssen’s data science strategy and execution. Dr. Foody began her corporate career at Merck Research Labs, where she served as Global Director Scientific Affairs of both the Cardiovascular and Metabolism Therapeutic Areas, formulating external engagement, franchise strategy and leading compound candidate selection through proof of concept to clinical practice. During this time, she led multiple project teams including not only supporting Ezetimibe and Januvia, but also provided leadership and strategic direction on small molecules targeting atherosclerosis, heart failure, hypertension, diabetes and pulmonary hypertension.Prior to joining the industry, Dr. Foody spent over two decades in academic cardiology and is a known international expert in preventive cardiology having held professorships at both Yale and Harvard Medical Schools. She has published extensively with over 200 peer reviewed articles. She has authored multiple international guidelines, chapters and two authoritative textbooks in preventive cardiology. Dr. Foody is a board-certified cardiologist, a Fellow of the American Heart Association, and a Fellow of the American College of Cardiology.ESPR is beefing up its management team at a critical period for the Company as they drive towards the completion of the CLEAR Outcomes trial and advance their potential first-in-class oral PCSK9 inhibitor program. That being said, the ongoing launch and sales of Nexletol and Nexlazit as we re-open are most important for ESPR near term.RECOMMENDATIONESPR is a BUY under 35 with a TARGET PRICE of 70"
With the short position at 44% of the floatWe will see a massive short squeeze to move this stock much higher
"Under the terms of its Revenue Interest Purchase Agreement with Oberland Capital, Esperion will pay Oberland between 3 and 10% of its US sales in consideration of $125 million provided by Oberland. As part of this agreement, if sales for the quarter ended 30 September 2021 do not exceed $15M, then Esperion will place $50 million into a ""blocked"" account controlled by Oberland."
"this is failing massively. We just need to get some positive data about financing or sales and until then, it is painful but a great opportunity to buy more much lower."
"One of the best bargains I've ever seen. NOVEL (with different mechanism of action from statins) effective FDA-approved cholesterol medicine. Double the float with a MASSIVE offering and you still have a pittance $700M market cap for a compound that will eventually have sales of at least a Billion a year - and MORE if BP acquires or partners.Evaporated 1/4 of my DVAX position on it's run up (more in the tank there IMO), and redeployed some here. bringing my position to 4K shrs cost avg $20.70. Long term HOLD."
Market cap is only $342M now. When is some pharma going to take ESPR out?
"Consistently 5 to 10% lower every week￼. As stated by many people here this is the third or fourth line of defense after statins it has no chance for any sales.People don’t want to take statins to begin with doctors are not going to prescribe this add on , annoying￼ drug￼￼."
"As promised from bioinvest newsletter which has a very strong 20 year record on biotech picks:""We expect the NAFLD to be positive and serve as a huge catalyst for MDGL. It is inexplicable that almost all of the NASH competitors have failed or bailed, yet MDGL is down in valuation, all while moving so close to the important Phase III data readouts. In our view, resmetirom will be the best in class NASH drug and will become a billion dollar molecule.""RECOMMENDATIONMDGL is a BUY under 200 with a TARGET PRICE of 275"
"97 million people in the USA have high levels of bad cholesterol?? By the end of 2022 I believe ESPR will have 5% minimum..5 million x $3,600 = 18 billion...also we have Rest of Word Deal coming. Q1... ESPR will be $ 500.00+ I will be buying for the next year."
"Because the CEO didn’t jump on share dilution bandwagon right away, this makes think that something maybe brewing!!!"
"I shorted this at 35, things are looking good, The problem with the company is there board and their CEO, if they haven’t been able to sell their drugs by now the stock is going to single digits￼"
"On 12/15/20 somebody(?) hires Sheldon Koenig as COO when ESPR pps is $29.60. ( I heard he was a great deal maker). On 5/17/21 he is elevated to Pres. and CEO and pps goes from $22.70 to $20.85 same day. Today after a stellar quarter under his experienced wing, pps has a low of $13.74 with no relief in sight. Where do these losers come from? and why are they hired? I live in South FL. Towns here are loaded with, might I say, topnotch Docs and Specialists for obvious reasons. I happen to be a cardiac case with a mile long history and recently have seen several different cardio and internal med people. Not a one knew anything about the ESPN company or the drugs. Every snotnose biotech is having a field day in the market, yet shorts are eating caviar at Esperion's expense. Perhaps ""Shortie"" hired Mr. Koenig...that's a thought."
Those who constantly press the stock with the fact that an additional issue is expected - does it bother you that none of the banks significantly lowered the target price in their expectations? Maybe you misunderstood something?
Script Friday’s are always red. Do not be shocked when earnings disappoint again. Sell the company for pennies
Only chance longs have is if CVOT is stopped early because of stellar results. That would stop the massive cash burn and that would enable bigger pool of people to take the pill
"Very interesting read.Esperion announced appointment of Alan Fuhrman to its Board of Directors.One of his previous engagements was with Ambit Biosciences, where he helped lead the company through its initial public offering and oversaw financial, investor and administrative operations until its sale to Daiichi Sankyo in 2014.Hmmm...."
Sheldon give investors update on which teaching hospitals your sales force has completed sales call and results of call. Longtime individual investor/frustrated!
Sheldon didn’t even bother to rewrite the earnings script or add a few sentences. No mentions of oral PCSK9. Very disappointing!!!
With this news there is no chance of dilution. With a continuation of the growth rate or close to that rate ESPR will be at breakeven by the end of the year. With the influx of cash they will have an extra 100 million as a buffer.
The dilution they are doing is criminal. They literally are dumping so many shares and don't care the price
"Various studies from around the world suggest possible benefits of anti-cholesterol drugs in the fight against COVID-19. Studies have shown that they have the potential to reduce the burden on the body from the virus by 70%. However, as a rule, thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, which are often associated with postcoid syndromes, are indicated in the side effects of such agents. I wonder if Nexletol  could be effective in treating coronavirus? This is also an anti-cholesterol drug."
"For the uninitiated, what does portola refer to?"
Looks like management will drive this company into the ground. 300 million expense and 50 million revenue. Will this be sustainable?
it is interesting to note that every FDA approved cholesterol lowering drug has had sales in excess of 1 billion dollars.If ESPR's is proved efficient and is reasonably priced we might be able to forecast sales of 1 bil. If you valued that at 10x sales it is easy to see this stock at substanually higher prices and a very interesting takeover target.
"About 80 million people take cholesterol therapy in the US and EU. Many of them do not achieve goal despite max statin, or because they cannot tolerate statins. I personally am a physician, my LDL is 160 but I get cramps with all statins. I take zetia only and that causes some mild reduction. If 10% of cholesterol patients need additional therapy, that is potentially several million patients. Bempedoic acid can be priced at 400 dollars per month which would make it much much cheaper than Amgen's Mab therapy. If they were to get even 1 million patients at 5k per year, that would 5 billion in revenue and a market cap of 30-40 billion dollars easy. This is one of the best opportunities in the market. I also really like SRPT, GBT, and IMMU if you are looking for some other possible big winners. Do your own due diligence on those names."
Just Listened to the Morgan Stanley conference. Sheldon was horrible and simply lied. He had mentioned before that the study would be completed in “second half of 2022”. Now he is saying “completion end of 2022 and top line data to reported in early 2023”. Foody tried her best to cover the lie by saying how the “trial is tracking even better than she had expected “. How could that be when the trial top line data is pushed back by 3 quarters. Sheldon also acknowledged “realization that they need to raise capital before the CVOT outcome data” but was not specific on how - just mentioned the are exploring all avenues. Only positive point of this call was Foody’s mention of the Oral PCSK9 program and it’s potential . This may attract an acquirer - I hope.

"Oh boy, Novartis’s 9.7 expensive injectable is sitting on the sidelines with a CRL until they respond to the FDA in the 2nd or 3rd Quarter. FDA approval ??? Meanwhile Covid has wreaked havoc on cholesterol levels and doctors are talking more than ever about combination therapies like BA+Ezitimibe, Nexlizet. Big head start as doctors and insurance companies get comfortable with the less expensive option... This annoying non stop shorting has some advantages, cheap shares!!! Article - Novartis bought cholesterol drug inclisiran on the brink of a new drug filing as the centerpiece of its $9.7 billion acquisition of The Medicines Company. But, in the wake of an FDA rebuff amid the pandemic, the Swiss pharma’s now unsure when it might roll out the potential blockbuster in the U.S.Novartis is targeting the second or third quarter for its reply to the complete response letter the FDA slapped on inclisiran’s application in late 2020, the company said.After that, the timeline is unpredictable, Novartis CEO Vas Narasimhan, M.D., told reporters Tuesday.Back in December, Novartis characterized the FDA's problem as “unresolved facility inspection-related conditions” at an Italian plant that belongs to its collaborator Corden Pharma. On Tuesday’s call with reporters, Narasimhan further labeled the hiccup as “primarily related to process control-related issues” and stressed that it has nothing to do with inclisiran’s efficacy, safety or manufacturing techniques.On-site inspection of the Italian facility was originally planned for May 2020, but, due to the pandemic, it was turned into a paper-based inspection, Narasimhan explained."

Single digits are in the cards￼
"Squeeze would be nice but it also seems like a good LT hold. Worry is serious dilution given the cash crunch; however, the ROW deal worth $1B should be pretty helpful for their runway until they get results on the study. If insiders are not buying at this price, it is because they know dilution is coming, right? Alternatively it could be because of a BO. Personally, I am long at these prices for a small piece. Overall, very confused. Not a financial advisor and cannot be held liable for my remarks."
"very good CC. I was suggested to listen to it and i did. Have to listen as it changed my perspective. Too many positives to list, but most importantly to me were upfront cash coming in (65 in and 135 coming later from EU; plus something from ROW later), no SO till profitability, ahead of schedule in the going it alone, and lot of confidence expressed by management. i turned sour on this guys during the stay at home ordeal, but back to having a very positive view now. Anyone seeing any red flags or negatives that we can dwell on?"
I can’t post pics on the board so check out this post to see my amazing results from Nexlizet.https://stocktwits.com/Gary9912/message/371193181
"Sheldon, for god's sake, just give up 50% of US market commercialization rights for Nexletol and Nexlizet for upfront cash (approx $1 billion). Use funds to develop oral PCSK9 and its combo version with BA. Keep the rights to US market for these later two products. You have no other way to raise significant capital on a non-dilutive basis. You will not be able to get much for Chinese market at the point - given your negotiating position - which is very week. Your sales force is not going to save you. The delta variant is going to get worse and they will not be able to make see docs. You need to take the upfront money from Pfizer while its there. Don't get greedy."
 WOW PRICE TARGETS FROM $22. To $114. AWESOME. 
"Sheldon, listen to me and listen to me carefully. I’m a long time shareholder and believe in BA . However we have a product that can’t be sold other than by large cap pharma. ESPR’s current balance sheet cannot support future commercialization on a stand alone based in the US. Sheldon, please consider the following strategy:1- fire your cfo - he is useless at this point - just contributing to burn rate2- hire I-bank and start a sales process - announce in a press release that the Board is “exploring strategic alternatives “. This news alone will squeeze the shorts and the shares will double to $30.3- sell company to large cap pharma for some premium to the theoretical $30 per share (post press release) . However , and this is important !!!4 - make sure the deal is structured so existing ESPR investor get Contingent Value Rights payments (CVR) based on positive result from a successful CVOT and potential future sales milestones. So in conclusion, we get $1B upfront, $1B upon successful CVOT data and something like 30% of sales in CVR payments up to $10B in sales (or approximately $3B ) for a total of $5B in potential transaction value. These numbers are just for illustration purposes - the CRV payments can be much higher if the I-bank runs a competitive processes. Sheldon make it happen!!! Don’t blame sales on COVID like Tim did - until we ran out of cash. Tim didn’t have a vision and was married to ESPR for life and couldn’t think objectively."
"I think you could still make 100% on a short at this point, the investors relations presentation will be a failure and wishful thinking. The CEO and his cronies are epic failure’s￼"
They are doomed from the start. Soon the PE will be more than the share price. Lol.
Not sure if you saw this but it’s being testing with ezitimide and atorvastatin in a triple threat study with good phase two results! Imagine if it will be used outside the statin intolerant patient population...https://www.atherosclerosis-journal.com/article/S0021-9150(20)31597-5/fulltext
"i sold good deal of $65 and $70 Feb calls and for some strange reason decided to buy them all back today as pps dropped. Glad i did watching AH now... small volume, but encouraging.."
Plan is coming together. Buy at 6 takeout at 18. Just like Portola.
"Back to $13.50 by Friday , any thoughts?Any body see any news?I just don’t see it turning to the upside do to this companies sales, take over talks, that might do it but once again , horrible sales￼￼￼￼"
"Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Foody and Dr. Nissen, will discuss the current landscape and future directions in the treatment of elevated cholesterol in an Analyst & Investor Webinar to be held on September 13 at 1:30 pm."
Longs hold on. There are no sellers. Look at the volume. Only trades are shorts covering . If longs hold on shorts will have to cover for more than 15 days . The shorts are nervous - not enough shares to cover their position. The fuel on the fire will be Wallstreet Bets. They are discussing the merits on Esperion as a potential meme stock . The shorts are playing with a ticking time bomb.
Sold 600 shares @50.75 on 6/30/2020.I feel good.
FLXN is BO. I told all to buy at the lows. No thanks necessary. I love helping the plebes make money
Sheldon stated that they are aware of the need for incremental funding to carry their huge cash burn rate through the end of the Clear Outcomes Study. He mentioned they are exploring every avenue of death spiral finance available.
"Who are you going to believe, the shorts who tell you this thing is doomed or one of the nations top cardiologists, Dr. Nissen who can’t talk about BA and the CVOT trial without getting all giddy, over 75% events now reached and Dr. seems very confident this will show a cardio event reduction and it may show more of a benefit that first though because of the anti inflammatory benefit. I’ll gamble that Dr. Nissen knows what he’s talking about. Take a look at his national recognition. https://www.acls.net/2013/05/15/the-10-most-highly-regarded-heart-doctors-in-the-ushttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2017/12/05/27-top-cardiologists-picked-by-big-data/amp/https://www.dicardiology.com/content/dr-steven-e-nissen-named-one-time-magazines-100-most-influential-people"
Anyone recall the PCSK9 oral program . Review 4Q earnings . New CMO has come on board to drive this through the clinic . Any data will drive shares up. Stay tuned !
my march calls have swelled and i think they will swell again twice once before 21 news or right after the news and then again between 21 and 26 as the first approval will really bring in the buying interest just before the second pdufa. anyone playing it right here could make ton of money between this coming week and after 26 feb... two back to back pdufas. i love it...
"Why would dr foody leave the role of VP at J&J for esperion if the company wouldn’t have a bright future? I assume due diligence was done , this is just a 400M company value right now. At minimum should be 1B"
"Esperion share recovery could happen, says JefferiesAfter hosting investor meetings with management, Jefferies analyst Michael Yee concluded that despite the “visceral market reaction,” investors who “understand the details” come away with a consensus view that bempedoic acid is not causing cancer and not causing cardiovascular deaths. This is positive and a “stock repair” could happen if the company lays out the details of the deaths clearly and the three studies coming in May, August and September support a positive safety picture, Yee tells investors in a research note. He has a Buy rating on Esperion with an $85 price target. Does anyone read ?"
They love diluting near end of the day. Look at that chart. I will buy some more at 5 dollars. That is about the correct price for a drug that is not selling.
They had some interesting insights about ESPR on (http://Rightpicker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
I don't know why anyone believes ESPR is flirting with the bottom. Listening to management spin on these calls tells you a far different story. Summary of call as follows:1. Everything is wonderful and everyone at the company is wonderful. We are getting a fantastic reaction from the healthcare community and everyone now understands where this wonderful drug should be prescribed.2. We're not getting any new prescriptions since the Q2 earnings call. People must not be going to the doctors.3. We're keenly aware that we are running out of cash at lightening speed but have no concrete plan to finance our huge burn rate.4. We'll have some concrete proof that our drug works (we think) as early as just 10 months after we run out of cash.5. We're excited and everything is wonderful.
At this market cap. All salary and sales should be cut in half. They have have all failed
"I am puzzled by how cheap this stock still is. We should get approval, the P3 data is very solid and the CHMP opinion just confirms that. The market size is huge, if they even get 1 million patients and only charge 80 dollars per month for drug that is 1 billion in revenue. Would easily justify market cap of 5 billion. They have stated they intend to price low to maximize market share, PCSK9 Mab cost 500 per month in comparison and needs to be injected twice a month. They could charge 200 per month and would still be a bargain. I have a large position but will buy more after approval. I am a physician and I know I would use this drug on lots of patients with bad cholesterol and history of heart disease or those who cant take statins."
"Just trying to get a handle on the potential revs of Nexletol. Found that the aprox. price of 180mg., 30 tabs = $333.91. So a patient will be taking it for a year; $331.91 X 12 months = $4006.92. Round it off to $4000 X 300,000 patients = $1,2000,000,000. That's a lot of high cholesterol Bacon. Just on the surface, ESPR could have a very valuable drug. They have secured some high quality partnerships to expand access to this drug. It maybe shows that they realize ESPR cannot financially and realistically reach these markets without help and you have to strike while the iron is hot; recent FDA approved drug. Maybe my chalk board is off or I am missing something but what if a Million patients came on board. Kinda makes this share price look real cheap. I better do some more dd on this one. GLTA."
No volume folks - nothing to worry about . Just shorts trying to scare into selling your shares. Just don’t look at this ticker until third quarter earnings . You will be rewarded around then.
"The two poster presentations revealed positive data. No suprises. Back up to $50 is my guess. Short interest keeps growing.ANN ARBOR, Mich., Aug. 26, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Esperion (NASDAQ:ESPR) today announced that it will present a pooled analysis from four Phase 3 clinical trials of NEXLETOL (bempedoic acid) tablets as well as long-term safety and efficacy data from the CLEAR Harmony open-label extension study of NEXLETOL at the ESC Congress 2020, the annual meeting of the European Society of Cardiology, being held virtually from August 29th – September 1st, 2020."
"Ok, let’s be serious. We have one guy in this forum who is not ashamed to lie any time he has an oportunity. Curecancer and Kurt is the same guy.Scripts were 2.000 in June, 4.000 in July and 5.500 in August. You can hear that in last CC. Those are not the best sales in the world but are already better than what PCSK9i's did in 2015.In October they start with social media advertisement, and almost all insurances are covering.Market: 18 Mn patients just in the US. Being the first in class, easily 10-20% could be achieved.This is a huge oportunity."
Any thoughts on how stock may react tommorow after FDA approval
"Credit Suisse report out today;""Under the terms of the agreement, Esperion is eligible for up to $510m in total sales anddevelopment milestones, of which $60m is received upfront, and tiered 15% to 30%royalties on net sales in Japan.

"Sheldon, shares are down more than 50% since you joined. You have not put any news other than the 2Q earnings - which didn't indicate anything substantial about how you plan to make sure the company stays solvent. You and Foody have not bought a single share at these depressed levels. If you don't have the money just let me know I will lend you some. But you purchasing some shares is critical to establish some confidence with your investor base. If you truly believe BA is a multi billion dollar opportunity isn't it commons sense for you to buy some share? If you issue anymore stock option to yourself and/or Foody at these levels or below we know what your are all about - trying to sandbag this ship just to make yourself rich?"
Never more than a 3rd or 4th line medication. Majority of patients get to goal with Statin and Zetia.
It’s pretty clear that the Q2 sales number is not good.
"- Short interest is 39.96% as of 8/15- Fidelity just offered me 5.875% interest to lend my shares because I have them all protected from being shorted by placing a sell order at a very high price- Basically there is almost no shares available for shorting. One of many good reasons for the recent stock performance.- Without shorts the stock would have been $70-$80 now because of its unlimited potential.- Protect your shares from being shorted: All you do is to place an order to sell your shares at, for arguments sake, double today’s price. As they are ‘on order’ they cannot be lent out by your broker and in turn you are reducing the amount of ‘free shares’ out there that can be used for shorting purposes. And don’t forget to move your limit order up when the price starts to recover, then, that way your shares can’t be shorted."
Needs to get back over 20
"this company looks like either bankrupt, or massive diluting or delisting. They posted so many irrelevant posts on Linkedin page. Their IR kept deleting negative comments as I noticed a few times. No one in their company and industry would face the truth they just posted about women's right conference and many congratulated them. THey really treated themselves like giant companies like Amazon and Facebook. Nothing more to say. They don't fix the problem and I won't buy a single share of this company."
You got the Portola dude running the Company. See what happened to Portola.
Everyone relax. Some funds are just reducing their positions. Will bounce back next week. Average Analyst price target is $80. Great buying opportunity at these levels. I bought another 2000 shares as well as Aug $40 calls. Easy money.
"As I suspected, a guy on Twitter, BH1377, he has followed ESPR since inception and is very knowledgeable, today he reported that the weekly scripts are up 24% ,wow, .(Look it up) He says the scripts are delayed by one week. I believe him, he posts a lot of good information about the stock and IMO wouldn’t make that up. Obviously that would make it the companies best week of sales ever since launch and it’s only going to get better!!! Don’t sell you’re shares too cheap or one of us may buy them!!!"
What are the chances of this company being bought out before FDA approval?
"My prediction for first quarter earning release on May 4th. Sales increase of 140% quarter over quarter (similar to the 4th quarter increase). As the Covid situation was not much different Q1 vs Q4. I predict a preliminary view for Q2 will be shared and the outlook for Q2 will be much stronger. Q2 strength will be a result of more vaccinated patients going back to see their Dr. And the outlook for Q3 and beyond should be stellar. Between now and May 4th I don’t know if it’s time to buy, hold or sell. However after May 4th I think we should all hold. Catalyst after may 4th will be post Covid sales jumps every quarter. Along with cardiovascular study later this year / early next year."
Need an activist to take control of this!
Good news is that it can't go much lower. I mean worse case is 5 dollars a share and we are almost there. They twiddle their thumbs while rome burns.
told you all in 2018 this stock would be around $10 and better sell it before the FDA approval. Going alone with commercialization for any bio companies is high risk. You guys only care about the product but not the expenses for bringing it to the market and sales... Hope you listened and sold at $70. if not... too bad
"Approved; hitting the market on July 1; I am golden long term. EMA in April’s, then 175 mil cash deposit, and first script data available first week in April. May wake up one morning and hear the entire sales force is fired. Don’t panic; it mean Merck or Pfizer is in charge..."

Pop 8% AH. Short squeeze being paid back. Maybe trial results leak?
The sad part is based off of the chart. Still a lot to be made if short
"Shortall bought espr at $43, he’s more than a little sore after this shellacking. Always go opposite of anything he recommends."
About 28 million shares outstanding.According to NASDAQ there is 110% institutional ownership. There is one entity in the insider category that has 10% of the shares or nearly 4 million shares. Another million is owned by insiders or 4%. So about 124% is owned by insiders and institutions. There are 10.1 million shares short or 36% of the shares . So they need to buy back 10 million shares with 6.72 million shares from the strong inside and institutional hands plus 3.3 million from retail. All the while sales are ramping both here and overseas. Unless the world continues to melt down the shorts are in for a huge squeeze.
Any thoughts on the timing of the quarterly earnings. If earnings are really bad and no good forward looking statements then I would an after hours even a Friday after hours announcement so the investor community to digest the news. A Tuesday morning before the market opens is amazing to me. Thoughts???
"Not too familiar with ESPR & it’s drug BA. But know very well about the terrible side effects of statins.Yesterday I listened to the webcast with Dr S. Nissen & wasn’t surprised to learn that the FDA approved Statin Trials did not include Statin Intolerance Patients. And that’s why many cardiologists/family physicians are totally unaware of the statin side effects. Obviously an alternative is badly needed & based on what I heard from Dr Nissen, BA might do the job!The question I have is with regard to the company share price, which has been dripping continuously from a high of about $70 to where it is today during the past 18 months or so…Does anyone who has been following the company knows what the hidden reason or reasons for share price depreciation might be? Dilution doesn’t appear to be the reason as the shares outstanding is under 30M!"
Trying to wrap my head around these third quarter numbers.$35 million R&D. $50 million admin/general$3.3 million product sales$50 million spent to sell $3 million of their product??!!
"ESPR and ARWR are my two largest biotech positions. Both are very well run, both are very well funded, and both have at least one blockbuster drug in the pipeline that WILL be approved. I added to both positions today w/ LO's that I felt were ""sale price"" deals. Both will have PR by March 1st which will cause major moves up in share price. All my opinion of course, so do your homework before you trade. GLTA longs."
"Dr. Nissen is the lead investigator on the CVOT trial. This webinar was very informative. Research analyst were engaged and asked great questions. If ESPR can bridge operations through the CVOT , Dr. Nissen seems very optimistic (but keeps emphasizing he is neutral as an investigator- which he should be) that BA will be broadly adopted by physicians and payors.

I work in the healthcare field and am involved in research. The side effects listed for a drug like this and the amount of people getting the side effects are not nearly as bad as other drugs. Also the important part is that the patients who died from cardiovascular problems were most likely from a heart problem that this drug was trying to help. And it probably/definitely did lower their LDL levels but their heart was probably too far into it that the drug wasnt going to rescue them. Wall st must know this right? Is this manipulation? Are people waiting for the second approval? What is going on here?!
I believe FDA approval a lock. Reaction of the street short term unpredictable. You guys experienced in biotech know the options. But this isn’t peanut flour. Been here 5 years. I doubt they will go it alone. Will stay put for bo no matter what short term reaction might be. GLTAL.
No more Mr. Nice Guy. New CEO should fire bottom 50% sales reps and reallocate financial resources to direct to consumer detailing until we get the results of cardiovascular outcomes data in 2022 . Preserve cash until then.
"Reposting this from user stocksarelit from Stocktwits $ESPR Too many signs here signaling upcoming BO or news. 1. No recent insider buys at these cheap levels although CEO was buying big in the 40’s. 2. Massive institutional short interest despite terrible risk/reward and hard to borrow status. Stock has been held down to current levels for months. 3. Weird subordinated notes offering covers the majority of the short float, which would save the short ~$185M in the event of a buyout. 4. ROW deal completion in Q4 has been anticipated for months. The date came and went with no press release or update to investors, other than an email from IR to Gary stating that deal was not completed due to an “increased interest in Bempedoic Acid abroad”???5. Spectacular P2 results released showed 60% reduction in cholesterol levels when used in low-dose combination therapy. Company remains silent. What a blessing it would be if BO is announced next week. If not, I will be loading up on Mar/Jun/Jan 22 calls in anticipation for the big day."
Six dollar target looking good. Buy at 6.
"Looks like sales came in a little light for the street. What a great time to be launching a new drug into a pandemic. Well, we have a floor put in at $3.8 million for a quarter. Seeing we will not be getting any rev guidance until 2022? we all have to wait again for quarterly numbers to help us guestimate trending revs. Drugs are now available in Germany with more countries to come on line in 2021. It could be interesting to see if DC with their seasoned sales team can break that nut open. Numbers for the last 2 months of this 4th. quarter should give us some light on this. Rick, CFO, still sticking with 1.8 million patients in the U.S. at peak sales. Time frame, 2yr.s? 3 yr.s? 4 yr.s? Anybody's guess right now. My take on this is when we can get past this C-19 and have a more open society/economy we should see how close Rick is. If we hit half that number (900,000 patients) at $3,000 an annual scrip. comes in at aprox.$2.7 billion. From 3.8 million to 2.7 billion? Quite a story he is trying to sell us. No easy answers here. I had planned to stay for a year of launch before making a final decision on this company, but watching the sp drop and flounder makes it a little hard to watch this show. Management does have some skin in the game, but hey they are also collecting a paycheck. Just my opinion and take on ESPR at this time. Time to go Vote. Everybody stay safe and GLTA."
"Day one this is a 4th line agent after statin, PCSK9 and Zetia. Statins 50% reduction PcSK9 50% reduction Zetia 20% reduction Not much left for BA. These other agents have outcomes so who cares about BA outcomes. Patient comes in LDL at 160 which is high , added close to 70, statin intolerant PcSK9 at 70. No need for BA except for a select few patients . That’s why the stop is $15."
This stock is just biding its time. I bought a lot of it already and will buy it until it costs so cheap.
"JMP Research Post Webinar with Dr. NissenEsperion Therapeutics, Inc.KOL Event Primes the Pump for Outcomes DataJason N. Butler, PhD Roy Buchanan, PhD ESPR: $11.38 | Market Cap: $322.1 | MARKET OUTPERFORM | Price Target: $90.00Discussion with Dr. Steven Nissen provides long-term confidence in the blockbuster potential of the bempedoic acid franchise; we reiterate our Market Outperform rating and risk-adjusted, DCF-derived $90 price target on Esperion Therapeutics. Dr. Nissen is a renowned cardiovascular expert and lead investigator on the CLEAR Outcomes cardiovascular outcomes trial (CVOT) for bempedoic acid. Dr. Nissen focused on the unmet need for the largest driver of mortality in the developed world, cardiovascular disease. In his view, bempedoic acid is an important drug for the ~50% of people, 35MM-40MM, in the U.S. that meet criteria for lipid lowering medications but do not take them. He expressed optimism for success in the CLEAR Outcomes trial (results from CLEAR Outcomes remains on track for ~1 year from now) given the validation of LDL-C as a biomarker and pointed to the drug’s impact on inflammation and glucose control as differentiating attributes.Key points:Dr. Steven Nissen, M.D. is the Chief Academic Officer of the Sydell and Arnold Miller Family Heart, Vascular & Thoracic Institute at the Cleveland Clinic and he has deep experience in the conduct of CV trials, and particularly CVOTs. He has extensively advocated for lower LDL as an objective goal to improve outcomes and also believes that statin intolerance is a real issue with many patients, as he has observed in real-world practice.Stain intolerance is real, and the unmet need for better LDL-C control is high. Dr. Nissen believes that statin intolerance is a key impediment to better LDL-C control given patients’ unwillingness to take statins chronically with high compliance. He pointed to a lack of prescriber education on the real-world impact of statin intolerance and the limitations (selection bias) of pointing to historical statin trials as a counter to the importance of statin intolerance. Specifically he noted that statin CVOTs did not have many statin intolerant patients because they were screened out due to having a statin run-in phase, which can create the false impression of fewer statin intolerant patients in the broader population. He acknowledged FDA’s struggles with the patient population, in part due to lack of a biomarker.CLEAR Outcomes is well designed, evaluating a population that provides the best potential for success, and has not been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Dr. Nissen has been impressed with the ability of CLEAR Outcomes to stay on schedule despite the COVID-19 pandemic, testament to the efforts of Esperion, Cleveland Clinic, and the CRO. Key metrics such as patient retention, drop-out rate, and event rate have all tracked to expectations set well before the pandemic emerged."
AMRN should merge with ESPR. It’s a win win. AMRN needs a patent protected product and ESPR needs a management team and commercial infrastructure that can sell !

By the free fall I am guessing that sales this quarter were less than last. If I remember the last call correctly they stated that sales were lowered because they had to continue many people on the drug for free while they awaited insurance approval. It may be that many of these people rolled off and very few new were added.
I got back in at $19 after making some nice profit In previous trades with it. I think the valuation is now too low to pass on this. What they need is big pharma to scoop them up and put all their muscle behind the commercialization of their drug. This is no less than a unicorn
"Apparently the market espr thesis now is show me the sales... this is rightfully so as other ldl lowering drugs underperform. Some experts blame them for their high cost, something espr is trying to avoid.Also had my physical today. Asked my doc about nexletol, and he had no clue. He had me on 20 mg simvasta and moved to Crestor. He said similar stuff but much more safe and less side effects. He is a primary care doc who are not on esperions target list during phase 1 selling."

"It is also strange that almost no one pays attention to the comments of some health workers that overweight people (who have obvious problems with bad cholesterol) are more seriously worse with COVID-19, and also that the virus is most likely related to thrombosis. Perhaps it makes sense to conduct some research on this, suddenly the inclusion of bempedoic acid in the complex treatment of COVID-19 will help reduce mortality. Such a fact could greatly accelerate the promotion of the company's drugs."

"Another good article- this board, unfortunately limits your ability to post links to stories videos and photos I don’t know why they do that here but let me paste in the text.other trends are working in the Esperion's favor as we enter 2021. The first is European partner, Daichi Sankyo, has begun to gain traction selling both the drugs in Europe. The primary reason is their sales team has previous relationships with prescribers selling other Daichi Snakyo drugs, enabling them to launch to ESPR’s drugs.The second factor is the expansion of M&A in the biotech-pharma world with ESPR being a prime target with two approved drugs and an underperforming stock price.There are only so many companies with completely de-risked assets like ESPR with their two FDA approved drugs and full U.S. rights also adds to their economic appeal as the U.S. represents over half of the world’s pharmaceutical sales.In our view, Esperion Therapeutics has excellent management and, with their new COO, the company is poised for a strong 2021.https://www.moneyshow.com/articles/tptp2021-55871/"

Keep 100% rights for these two development programs for US markets."

"Analysts and the independent ICER have convincingly shown Nexletol can generate up to $3B per year in revenue.

Institutions own more than 122% of all shares that exist. No, that was not a typo! This may mean extreme danger for ESPR shorts and lower risk for those who buy."

"Investors should have investigated how physicians would use BA. Although I feel there will be an uptake in business not enough to cover cost of the sales force. BA is 4th line treating LDL tough to gain traction as 4th pick. Most patients get to goal with a statin, then add Zetia that will get 80% to goal. For tough patients add PSCK9’s. That leaves BA fighting for statin intolerant and those that won’t inject.Good luck longs ."
Can anyone call a bottom on this? I’m hoping it’s not below $16. If the quarterly numbers aren’t good maybe $12?

Dr. Nissen certainly sounds confident about the Clear Outcomes Trial- I just wish he could speed it up- 75% events reached already and events will go quicker now that the trial is in the late stages.

"Listened to the replay of the webcast from last Thursday. Some of the highlights were, 150 million payday when N launches in Europe (most likely 3rd quarter), U.S. insured coverage at approx. 80% and medicare pt.D at 50% (pretty good increase), expect 100% coverage for both at about a year from launch (late April early May 2021), will be transparent for the investment community concerning all areas such as prescriptions, refill, gross to net (most likely by the 4th quarter)…Tim sounded genuinely excited to see the company where it is at and what gains and opportunities are in the near future. Tim had made a statement of 1.8-2.0 patients in the US at peak sales. He did not elaborate on the what the common conditions were of these patients, but not sure if this was the total or partial market penetration for N. Even though, at those numbers, I estimated the cost of N of approx. $1300 a year X 1.8 and 2.0 million patients and came up with a gross sales of 2.3-2.6 billion. If that is fairly close to actual sale numbers, it looks to me that we have quite a bit of upside to go. Hey, and then we have Europe launch numbers to consider and then Japan and then... Well this sounds great, but I think we will have to wait and see by the 4th quarter on how the actual numbers play out. Be Safe and GLTA."
"2nd. quarter results Aug. 3 2021. So, what kind of spin is Sheldon going to give us? 1st. quarter had sales of aprox. 6.4 million with total revs of about 8 million.2nd quarter - Lets say they carry over that 6.4 and increase that by 80%. Reason being that C-19 restrictions were easing and hey if the sales force hasn't been able to sell product by now, get rid of the slackers. Daiichi had over 14,000 patients on product last quarter. What is Daiichi doing that ESPR sales team apparently are not doing? Selling product.I apologize for getting off track. OK, 6.4 million plus 80% (5.12 million) gives us 11.52 million in sales. So the bottom line should read;$11.52 product sales plus $30 million from Daiichi for increased territories gives us $41.52 million for the quarter. I haven't included royalty's from Daiichi sales but it could add a couple million? Just a guess for I didn't take the time to guesstimate it. Analyst estimates run from about 40-47 million for the quarter. I wonder if Daiichi is looking at the market cap of ESPR and wondering that hey, instead of paying these clowns a royalty, why don't we just buy the whole enchilada? They have more invested in this company than what the MC is worth at this time.Just some thoughts and such as we wait for the results and guidance from Sheldon. GLTA>"

"Reiterating: Even if M.D. offices are closed to foot traffic, people are still having significant cardiac events (cardiac arrests). The fact that this has less side effects (than statins) alone is enough to increase prescription use remotely. This new drug is going to be a huge success. I remember when Plavix first came out eons ago. It was, and is a life saver. I was thinking back then that I should have invested. If this new Espr drug can truly reduce LDL cholesterol by 18% as indicated in the large, peer reviewed JAMA study article, it willbe just as successful."

I am long term investor that believes this drug provides an inexpensive alternative for statin intolerant patients but will not meet it’s potential until management executes on sales.
"Management has a good track record of zero updates between earnings calls, except to announce great news leaders. It seems likely the stock will hit $5 by that point in November. If they don’t make their sales target they’ll have to turn over $50M to their lenders under the revenue sharing agreement. That will be the end."
The stuff works folks!!! The past 4 years I have had cholesterol levels ranging between 140 and 200 and my LDL has been between 95 and 105.

"New article out on BA over the weekend. It will not post correctly on this site but here is a copy of the text.SHORT COMMUNICATION|ARTICLES IN PRESSGreater than Expected Reduction in Low-Density Lipoprotein-Cholesterol (LDL-C) with Bempedoic Acid in a Patient with Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (HeFH)Ali M. Agha, MDPeter H. Jones, MDChristie M. Ballantyne, MDSalim S. Virani, MDVijay Nambi, MD, PhD Published:July 10, 2021DOI:https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacl.2021.07.002PlumX MetricsHighlights•Bempedoic acid can be used for additional LDL-C lowering among individuals with HeFH•Those who are quite responsive to statins may be quite responsive to bempedoic acid•Bempedoic acid is most effective among individuals not already on a statinAbstractBempedoic acid is an adenosine triphosphate-citrate lyase (ACL) inhibitor that reduces levels of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) in the plasma by inhibition of cholesterol synthesis in hepatic cells, which leads to up-regulation of hepatic LDL receptors. Bempedoic acid is approved as an adjunct to diet and maximally tolerated statin therapy for the treatment of adults with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) who require additional lowering of LDL-C.In this case study, we describe a patient with HeFH who had a prior excellent response to statin but unable to take the same, and a less than expected response to PCSK9i, in whom initiation of bempedoic acid led to a substantial reduction of LDL-C.Our findings suggest that patients who are quite responsive to statins may also be quite responsive to bempedoic acid, a medication that works in the same biochemical pathway as HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. Additionally, this medication may be particularly effective at lowering LDL-C among individuals not on background statin therapy."
"Analysts at Jefferies point to a recent survey of 50 cardiologists suggesting Nexletol could capture 20% to 25% of the market for drugs that reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol — which, by Jefferies' estimates, would equate to around $2 billion in annual sales."

Dudes this is big time volume. Read: Institutional footprints
"From newsletter: reported 2Q21 earnings with US net product revenue coming in at $10.6 million (+67% QoQ) just below the consensus estimate of $10.9 million. As prescriptions grew 28% QoQ, management highlighted that adjustments have been made to patient assistance programs to help improve net pricing with limited impact on patient access. In our view, net pricing improvements will continue as well as positive trends for prescription volumes as the company shifts Nexletol/Nexlizet positioning and pushes formulary adoption further. The company also reported $1 million in royalty revenue from European commercial partner Daiichi Sankyo. We continue to look to the CLEAR outcomes trial as a huge factor for prescriber uptake. Speaking of CLEAR, ESPR stated that 75% of MACE events have thus far accumulated and the read out remains on track for 2H22. In our view, CLEAR will be positive and serve as a monster catalyst next year.Rx demand during the quarter was up 28% from 1Q21, with >47,800 cumulative patients filling a script as of June 30. ESPR highlighted that the substantial improvement in net price in 2Q was driven by adjustments to both the duration and buy-down magnitude of the copay card program. Importantly, commercial and Medicare Part D coverage now stand at 95% and 60%, respectively, and the prescriber base is split roughly 60:40 primary care versus cardiologists.Going forward, the company expects continued improvement in net price over time as plans fully implement coverage and volumes pick up. We expect ESPR to continue to build sales momentum in 2021 as both Nexletol/Nexlizet are very attractively priced for their substantial LDL lowering benefit. With much of Wall Street remaining skeptical, any positive sales growth in the 2H21 which results in a revenue beat will serve as a catalyst. ESPR remains under valued for a company with two approved drugs and a significant outcomes trial, CLEAR coming next year. In our view, CLEAR will be positive and serve as a monster catalyst next year.RECOMMENDATIONESPR is a BUY under 35 with a TARGET PRICE of 70)"
Delusional investors are the one who bought espr. Suffer defeat and get out. 
The most optimistic analysts put a target price of $191 per share for Esperion. Let’s move higher. It will go much higher from the current price once they get a partner in North America.
Here is Sheldon ESPR CEO at last Conference Call
Esperion needs to be acquired in order for the value of Nexletol to be realized. The valuation is in the dumps because the current management team knows only how to throw shareholders' money away on a futile self-marketing campaign.
"Just finished listening to the entire webcast. I say it was superb. Don’t forget, there will be another one on Thursday morning. What I learn new was that target population is about 18.5 million who either can’t take statin or are max dose with unsatisfactory ldl results. Cost to patients will be $10 per three month refill. Insurers and patients will love the affordability and that’s one key for large scale adoption. They will be selling at end of March and will formally announce in the upcoming ACC conference. Originally I was expecting an ultimate pps of 175-200, but now I say more like $300+. It would take time to get there, but luckily I have the shares in a Roth account with no rush..."
The shorts have made / are making so much money here it's conceivable they could drive the stock to zero by year's end.
"@Massi@Bempedoic acid is not only a lipid lowering drug but also dramatically reduces inflammation (-27%), one of the main trigger of atherosclerosis. This effect is not shared by PCSK9 inhibitors that massively lower LDL but not impact on inflammation. The cost/year of bempedoic acid is roughly 70% less compared to the PCSK9 inhibitors ones. Statin intolerant patients that represent 15 million people in the US, may benefit from bempedoic acid which possesses the unique feature to be activated in liver and not in muscles."
volume is up a lot today. Just get the bad news out there. This has been so fing painful
"After nearly 7 months at the helm with no communication with the Street (other than earnings calls) and the stock depreciation more than 50% during his tenure , Sheldon’s answer to resurrecting ESPR from ashes is a #%$&ing Webinar. Tim please resubmit your resume."
whats everyone thinking for the quarterly results?
Longs replay the JMP conf from a month ago where Sheldon presented . Sheldon is very exited about the oral PCSK9 asset ESPR acquired a while back. He brought on the new CMO (who is highly respected in the cardiovascular space) to lead further development of the program (both as a mono therapy and combo therapy with BA). I believe Sheldon will start discussing this on the quarterly call and maybe even provide some early data. If the have promising early data this asset can be partnered with a large big pharma for some serious upfront cash - which will be the nondilutive source of capital the company needs to bridge us to CVOT and also toast the shorts. 
"I'm very bullish and don't buy the recent downgrade by Goldman Sachs' Terrence Flynn. I know these conversations are all just a cheerleading exercise and I don't have an analytical advantage here. But I am a front-line soldier as a physician specializing in cardiovascular risk reduction and I can tell you that occurrence of muscle side effects from statins is closer to 60% than the advertised 10%. BA will be a huge advantage in this endeavor once approved. As for the PCSK9 competition, it is a factor. They are terrific. However, despite the price reduction they remain very expensive. One of my patients whose insurance adamantly refused to pay, is paying $471 a month at the pharmacy for Repatha. Another on Medicare Part D has a copay of $120 a month. His Part D pays a big chunk on top of that. We know how cheap it is to make a pill - about a penny. So I see a much higher demand for BA because of the very high incidence of statin muscle side effects and the advantage of a single daily pill compared to a twice-monthly injection using a seemingly expensive space-gun with a liquid cartridge. Also the combination of BA with ezetimibe will be popular because of the additional 20-30% reduction in LDL compared to either alone. So ra-ra-siscoomba for Esperion!"
"This board is for the birds, such negativity"
"Next catalysts:1- Announcement of new partner in Q1 (if it comes with a decent amount of cash, this will shut out the bears and push the stock nicely). $150?2- 2H of 2022 mortality study will be over and they will be able to remove the message on the package.The risk has been reduced greatly thanks to the validation of Daiichi and Otsuka.Daiichi Sankyo and Otsuka are huge companies that would not bother with a low volume drug. Next distributor for the rest of the world will also validate that. Access to physicians has been almost impossible since the drug launched, I do not think we need to worry about sales, it will just take longer. This is going to be big, at this stock prices, just buy and hold at some point the street will realize and it will break previous records.I am not counting on a buyout and I would be happy to let it grow organically over the next 5 years, but a buyout for 3-6B could make sense for a strategic partner. I am wondering if the rest of the world announcement is taking longer because they are also considering this option.All the short in this board, management is committed (you just need to listen to the presentations) and recently validated by numerous investors and distribution partners. You can keep spreading fud or cover your position, it has already touched bottom. Whether you are forced to cover by next quarter or next year it is only a matter of time.For the longs, just be patient, the good times are coming. Selling now would be like selling Tesla in May 2019"
"Latest published data shows lower cardiac events, lower new diabetes, lower CRP inflammatory marker in just 52 weeks. Statins increase diabetes rates. This drug will help get cholesterol to target without PCSK9 injections."
Positive results from Study 2 will send this to 100

"Why is the operating cash flow $-292,000,000. What is the money being used for? Other than the CVOT trial the development cost should be very low. Are they spending over $200 million on marketing?"
"Dr. Nissen was confident but neutral today as he mentioned several times (he would have to be neutral, of course) and he’s way more popular and respected than yours and my cardiologists, he’s among the nation’s best, hopefully those analysts asking questions can digest the information and come out with some new price targets.https://www.acls.net/2013/05/15/the-10-most-highly-regarded-heart-doctors-in-the-ushttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2017/12/05/27-top-cardiologists-picked-by-big-data/amp/https://www.dicardiology.com/content/dr-steven-e-nissen-named-one-time-magazines-100-most-influential-people"
Great results and updates. Big news coming in August and September. Enough cash until 2020. Buy buy buy $50 coming real quick
"Notes for the 9/13 call:1. Dr. Foody introduces herself and her wonderful background. She introduces Dr. Nissen. He is the Dr. Faucci of the cardio-vascular world.2. Dr. Nissen describes the wonderful study. All though no one knows he believes the outcomes of the trial could be wonderful.3. Bempedoic acid will never give you the LDL lowering impact of statins or PSK9 inhibitors but their is a role for them. He is excited about the study. It is a wonderful study.4. The results of the study should start coming out sometime in 2022. It's important not to dig into the sub-groups within the study. Just look at the headline results and further studies will look at interpreting sub-groups. It's a wonderful study.5. The questions are wonderful, excellent! The FDA says very few people are statin intolerant. This is incorrect because the intolerance disorder cannot be measured. Encliseran is a twice yearly drug coming up for approval. It will compete with PSK9 because it lowers LDL much more effectively than the Esperion drugs.6. Why are sales not where people thought they would be? Dr. Faucci states he's not an expert in sales but he thinks companies must inform and educate physicians about the role of a drug. Conventions and symposiums are the forum in which this education typically occurs. This is not occurring because of the pandemic. Even though it's a wonderful drug with a wonderful outcomes trial, it was a terrible time to launch a drug with the pandemic. The outcome data from the wonderful trial will be a sales catalyst if the outcomes are positive.7. The current trial is on the statin intolerant. Will physicians consider using the new drugs to incrementally lower LDL? Dr. Faucci - physician won't look at the detail of the outcomes. They'll just look at the headline and use it to lower LDL.8. Thank you for the great questions. Thank you Dr. Faucci for the wonderful drug trial. Everything is wonderful."
"Always remember statins and Zetia first they are cheap insurance will make you step through them . Then it’s a fight between BA and PCSK9’s. Most patients will get to goal on a statin and Zetia so there isn’t much left except statin intolerant. BA by itself not enough of a drop to fight off PCSK9’s. It’s such a small piece of the pie, even if they get outcomes. The original team hired for launch was incompetent now they are struggling to make up for lost time. I hope they can turn things around Q3&4 will be a telling sign"
The whole world is excited about this new drug... longterm winner.https://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/3128108/

"Buy at between $6-$8 a share, then wait for buyout at $18-$22 by the Portola guy who was brought in to sell acompany after they fail to commercialize."
They are diluting 100% of the float. They had 28 million shares a month ago and in a few months will have 56 million. This is failure on an unprecedented scale. The CFO needs to be fired immediately for cause. They destroyed all shareholder value.

I asked investor relations this morning whether the plan to announce a ROW partnership in April was still on schedule or not. Here is the replay via email:“our prior guidance of announcing a ROW partnership during April is still on track.”
