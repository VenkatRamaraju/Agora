"Hlt going up because of fed announcing will buy junk bonds the day after hlt bonds downgraded to junk. Market drinking the koolaid of fed and also improving virus news. Ignoring hlt release of poor preliminary 1q results . Trading at 38 pe based on current 2020 estimates of 2$ eps which may be too high. Hotel 1q reports coming up in couple weeks, doubt they will give eps guidance Don’t fight the Fed is in its full glory."
Someone on this board have an explanation to why HLT has not taken a hit to their stock price like the cruise lines and planes. It seems their stock price would have been affected just about as much as the airlines at least .
Going to monitor this one we really weird price action today at open. It maybe bull trap. This is way oversold considering the outlook is terrible and bankruptcies in this sector are going to be coming. Marriott is my number 1 for possibly going bankrupt.
This stock is only down 3.5% from one year ago today. Insane to me
$aht https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ashford-hospitality-trust-provides-recent-234500485.html $18.32 cash per share sounds great. Even the naysayers value aht at $14-$23. FDA full vaccine approval means it will soar. $ht $mar $hlt $h
"Timothy, you still around this board? How you feeling about the market and Hilton right now? See any signs?"
Will this be the nxt Squeeze like $GME ?Hope Citron opens renounces sonn a short report on$Fubo and tries to short the $hlt out of it :DMarketwatch says shortquote alrdy 60% ^^Laura Martin says 60$ would be fair price and she had with $MGNI $TTD $Roku awesome picksI will also get some $Score soon
"I was saying this about other casinos, they're getting pumped back up and trading around levels of Feb/March 2019.. Do you really think with the future earnings prospects going forward, basically zero occupancy for the next couple months, that they should only be down a couple percent from last years highs? No way."
How do shareholders on here feel about $ABNB valuation?
This will tank like a shipNo tourism till the summer is over. Lets see how it will holdGlta
This will finish at $65.50 today
@ Razor... How's the short going. At this rate by Friday you should be able to short $HLT at $80.00
"@ timothy....I was soooo close!! $65.83, not bad huh?"
The amount of Money CEO John Standley is squeezing out of this company is obscene. Knowing his history who would EVER hire him?? They are calling this a reverse merger or some $hlt. What is really happening is that CEO John Standley IS BUYING ABS from CERBERUS with shareholders money (the 4.4 billion proceeds from asset sale) and basically stealing peoples shares. I don't know if he can pul it off but I hope not. RAD shareholder benefited ZILCH from asset sale.
"Well Timothy, we are getting awfully close to the share price you said to watch. $67 could be breached tomorrow and look out below!"
"Well Timothy looks like you got one of those good news stories. That was basically the only thing I worried about, although obviously good news for the general world and out health. It is a long way off from ending this that’s why I think this will rally again but fizzle our next week. But again time will tell. Let’s see if those gains carry over to tomorrow?"
"Hilton manages and franchises all their brands but does not own any of their brands. The owned properties were spun off to a REIT, Park Hotels a few years ago. Their management and franchise fees are tied directly to hotels revenue, therefore have suffered. Unfortunately, much of the meeting business may never return because of zoom. Large convention business will eventually return. Resort Business will return and be robust. Business travel will also diminish due to zoom. All hotel companies will be impacted."
$100 here we go
"Oh, mark the price at $69.80"
1st quarter earnings reports are going to be pretty grim for most companies in the hospitality industry. A lot of other companies are now strapped for cash and are going to be opting for teleconferencing instead of sending employees on business trips for a while after this too. Lots of conferences and banquets will get postponed or cancelled through the end of the year in an effort to conserve cash and pay back short term debts accrued during the quarantine period. People thinking that it's going to be business as normal again in 2-3 weeks are delusional.
Anybody know the sudden directional change considering the market is still down overall?
"In my previous post I indicated that Friday 5/15 was either the day to short or cover indicating the market was about to move. Well Sunday night futures gave the answer. I hope those who were short reversed their positions or covered.Not sure when this rally will end. What I do believe is that is deep structural weakness in the economy due to what has taken place that is being hidden/dismissed. There will be a HUGE price to pay. Save you powder because when it hits the fan it will not be subtle and that's how you know it's real. It;s going to make millions for those who are prepared, so be prepared and may God bless and keep you."
"I made a choice to concede that I am not as bright as I once thought. So I depend to the market to give me the answers as to its direction and I NEVER disagree with what it's telling me. In the past whenever I did disagree, I got burned (like some are now). Should $HLT be trending up? HELL NO! , Should the S&P, Dow and nasdaq be moving up? Again, NO! But who am I to argue with the market. If the market changes it's mind by going below some moving average I consider important along with some other analysis that has worked for me in the past, I will change mine. Until then, I say go long on $HLT, $MAR and the market in general, even though in my mind, it makes no sense."
"Guess I'll get the conversation started...why so much movement up the past few days? I'm seeing some locations opening up on China, but not much more. Appreciate responses in advance."
"missed eps, beat RV's same I believe for $HLT in the morning"
Finally headed back down?
Dave Ramsay did a hatchet job on the radio last week on timeshare scam companies like Hilton. WOW! I can't believe it's legal.
"My wife mentioned there was no plain yogurt on the breakfast bar. Here is the reply from the general manager of the Hampton Inn: ""Thank you so much for staying with us and for filling out the survey. It appears as though you enjoyed your stay and we are delighted! I will look into the plain yogurt. Unfortunately Hampton Inn as a brand mandates certain items to be on the buffet. If items are not included then we are not allowed by brand standards to add it on our own.""This is a well run chain?"
"Looks like the more the bad news, the higher the market climbs. Maybe the lesson is that when the FED steps in ' follow the leader'."
"may have a high P/e ratio, cos its eps is to rise 900% from its 2020 lows. great company a must buy"
Look into buying WISH stock. It is just like Amazon but cheaper
"I'm wondering where reality is going to kick in, in the Travel and Leisure sectors? we're up on what, lost interest? GL"
"hilton operates an asset light model and earns money via franchisee revenue, a very smart move."
Can't wait for my call by end of week of sub $60So glad I loaded up on my short last week and my average is now very close to $65
"@Razor How about my prediction? Pretty accurate, yes?"
HLT and MAR like other hotels now running on PPP money! reality check is coming; it should dip good
I don’t understand why shorts keep coming to $AMD Message Board. They keep posting the same $hlt since AMD was at 12
Tomorrow am will tell us where we’re headed. Hoping for a beat and good guidance
This is the beginning of another fall for Hilton. End of next week it will be below $60 IMHO
Who in the right mind is buying this right now. Short and wait!
"Expensive, great margin, very low dividend"
Hilton Worldwide reached an all time high at 146.97
I guess that 2 billion dollar profit Ackman made in the last couple of days must have calmed him down. He must be loading up on his shorts for his next rant if they ever let him speak again.
"Great stock to invest in right now, after the pandemic the travel industry will boom, and Hilton will go nowhere but up!"
"If we were at war and in 8 months we lost 1.235.000 people with no end in sight, would the markets around the world be parabolic??Forget the case spikes, it the death spikes that is so quiet. Yesterday was the largest single day of loss of life, today is on pace to beat that number.$rcl $ual $qqq $wynn $vac $hlt"
Well I've started my shorting accumulation now. Let's see if it pays off like last time there was a fools rally
"“Business travel spending might not recover until 2025” - CNBC“Global corporate travel spending fell by more than 50% last year to $694 billion as the coronavirus pandemic ended a decade of growth, a trade group estimates. It could take until 2025 to recover.”"
"I just offloaded my put options on HLT since they'd gained 30%. I remain bearish on the fundamentals of HLT as well as the overall economy for the next 12 months, but I'm not confident that the market is always going to track with fundamentals, and felt it safer to exit given the next stimulus package that's in the offing.Options aside, I'm staying in cash for the next few months as this market is built on very weak foundations. GLTA."
"This $HlT is forgien to me, can anyone translate action $HlT?"
This is one crazy valuation...Hotel stock is so much higher than pre-pandemic in times all all the corona troubles. Makes no sense to me.The biggest Scandinavian chain - Scandic Hotels - trades at less than 50% of pre-pandemic (despite of being profitable in the last quarter). That's a reasonable valuation
Anyone care to offer a view how could HLT rise to this level in this environment?
GOD HELP US. Uncharted waters. ￼
"NASDAQ Afterhour just Crazy $hlt ^^Alrdy 1 million Shares traded up to new $ATH over 26 US $ :)Would be awesome if we can hit +30 US $ till Friday, if we can do it will be a w33dend for me $$ :P"
"Tap, tap, tap, dance, dance, dance. "
Isn't this stock the $Hlt ?!!!!! I love it.
A PE of almost 500 in a pandemic with no change in business strategy? Good luck. Not for me.
"I’m readying my next short start at $65, maybe even sooner $63?"
"It use to be that the fed was independent from the ,market. That is not the case now. If the fed stop buying, the market crashes. This has gone on for far too long! Trump has effectively coward the fed into submission with low interest rates and QE. This of course cannot go on forever. In the best economy in the world we have exponential debt and deficit. How can this be? The answer is simple, it is NOT the best economy in the world. It isn't even close. This must be corrected, maybe the dollar will be devalued. The market is headed for a epic decline. This is not a scare tactic, is meant for you to anticipate and prepare. Not sure when it coming its coming, but it is coming and there will be pain."
lost I realize the market is down however this is a good company and therefore why should it be trashed ?
This administration will prop up the market at ANY cost. I'm wondering if it even makes financial sense to bet against it.
"If you discounted the cash of 1.179 billions that it generated assuming no decrease in revenue, which will be impossible, then it is a 72 dollar stock. Now, it the cash generation cut 20 percent to 0.9432 billions as Marriott indicating , then it is only a 51 dollars stock. There is long way to go down."
"Eventually, when this plays out, I can't help but think that there will be huge opportunities in airline and hospitality stocks. $DAL $LUV $MAR $HLT"
After today my short will be in the green. May just hit that call of sub $60 by end of week!
All you shorts are in for a rude awakening starting tomorrow. (Today is 4/14/2020)

"@Will Is this your version of reality hitting the market? I sincerely hope your posts has not influenced anyone. At any rate, I have tried to warn folks that this is a FED backed rally, therefore, real or fake, it will run its course. So unless you have a trillion dollars to your piggy bank, go long or stay out. Shorting is just pain dumb at this time. @Razor I reiterate, this is NOT the time to short this market!"
"Lets focus! Dont listen to any noise out there positive or negative, is nice to hear positive things but we all know how desperate they are and how dirty and low they can go, if we stick to what we've been doing buying the deep and holding we going to be stronger and closer and closer but things to remember 1. We are no paying a dime of interest while holding. 2 We owe nearly 90% of the float 3. Look at the volumes we are not selling $hlt they keep jumping thru hoops to bring the price down in OTC, Dark Pool, shorting ETF, ladder stacks bringing bs news, paying bashers and you name it. 4 AMC is way under value we know without squeezing anything this can past 30.00 easy and they know it thats why the so scare and 5. Im proud of all ya, lets keep the party going see ya all in quadruple digits you guys the best.(No financial advisor, just admiring this nice group of apes)"
"Because of how COVID19 was and is being handled, I think this country is in real trouble. God help us."
Hilton Worldwide is up 4.94% to 97.94

"Razor for what it;s worth, I learned the hard way to abandon all reason and just look at what the market is telling me. When the market behaves like this, I used to think ""No way can this move up any further"", but I way Always proven wrong. So now I just follow, and I refuse to lead. As a note of caution, we don't know just how unreasonable the market can get before a correction. We may get to a point of irrational exuberance, where HLT reaches or even surpasses previous highs. We just don't know when the correction will occurs until it occurs. What we do know is that when it happens, it will catch most retail investors off guard and it will be devastating. Until then, my posts will be limited. God Bless."

"The U.S. hotel industry occupancy was 48.6% in August, a record low for the month2 out of 3 hotels will go under in 6 months with no change in demandhttps://www.investopedia.com/majority-us-hotels-can-only-survive-6-more-months-at-current-levels-survey-5078938?utm_campaign=quote-yahoo&utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=referral&yptr=yahoo"
"Looks like you were right Timothy and I was wrong. I still think this is going down eventually, but not sure how long I can risk this short in full.What got me today was the fact the GDP number came in worse than expected and worst since the financial crisis (in a quarter that won't even be as bad as Q2) and we are still up 2.5% on the S&P and general markets.I'm lost for words, but I believe you said don't fight the Fed....even if this makes no sense whatsoever"
"Hilton also expects the global health crisis to have a ""material negative impact"" on its business for an ""indeterminate length of time."" In other words ""we have no idea on how much money we will lose but rest assured it won't be as much as it could be"". And still the price goes up. Wow..."
Anemic volume. Institutional ownership is negligible.
"So, no matter what happens, there is no risk of losing money in the US Stock Market?1-3% Daily Capital Gains, 25-30% Monthly capital Gains are the new norms???No need to work anymore? Just buy the US Stocks and Get Quick Rich?What is the point of working, when the Government is PUMPING the Stock Prices Parabolically, while there is NO Real profit, Real Value, or Real Business?For instance, hotel's are empty and they are losing billions of dollars every week, but $MGM $HLT are hitting new multi year record high valuations every day. What is the Point of Doing business anymore?"
SunTrust changed their price today 4/29/2020 from $107.00 to $61.00. HLT up 6%? Bought some cheap puts
How is this even maintaining it's current level? This should be in the 20's.
"I can't believe how strong the algo is on this stock. Always there to instantly reverse moves. Somebodies spending a lot of money to keep this up. I know I shouldn't fight something that has obviously has more money than me, but conventions and business travel now fundimentaly changed to remote and I don't see much other travel happening until NEXT spring. Hopes, plans, countries, and hotels are going to open and close in waves. How to price in a year without business?"

Must not be getting as much free money for franchisees with new round of PPP loan money ...
@Timothy... Here's my prediction. (i.e. Not a fact) HLT will fall to below $55 at some point this month
"I'm lost about two thing, one is why my comment keeps getting deleted and two how is this company up 8% today. Makes no sense. It is up 14% since December 2018, this doesn't add up."
Anyone noticed a sharp uptick like a needle 15 min before market close? Weird thing is that’s almost identical move with what happened to MAR today. Very suspicious.
$19 bucks off it ALL TIME HIGH and some properties are still shut down. Highest COVID cases ever just reported.. props that are open are 20% occupied.. makes no sense!!! even for a 5 year play?? please help me understand
Trust Ackman. Looking forward to his fireside chat with the Hilton CEO!
"I don't really understand why hotel stocks are doing so well. They're reliant on business travel to the tune of ~75%, and business travel isn't coming back at least for the next year. Then again, I don't get the overall bullishness of the market either, and I feel eventually reality will set in. Buying puts on HLT, as I don't see Q2 earnings or Q3 outlook being pretty."
"Wow....Hilton's earnings somehow managed to make Hyatt's not look like the worst ever.....then, NCLH came out with theirs and they were even worse! It looks like the post-March share prices were about right for the hospitality and travel industry stocks."
"Wait let me understand this. Ackman goes on TV and says Hilton could go to zero along with more down for general mkt, all the while he’s buying equities( Hilton is his biggest holding now). Isnt that a textbook case of securities fraud ?"
EASY short here. After two very green days. Short this and cover by late Thursday or Friday
"I have been following this company for years, this is a good company and in fact financially they are doing better than Marriott. They didn't just acquire other brands or merge with others, their business strategy is more sustainable and proven to have done well than their competitors."
"Not doing business with any HLT brand ever again... we booked and paid an advance purchase in July for an August stay with a Hampton Inn in Monroe, MI... the number we paid was XXX.37...when we arrived we were again charged on the same credit card for XXX.39 (off by .02)... we spoke with the manager who said we would not be doubled charged... we have been for several months... it is now the middle of October... we have spent multiple calls to HLT ( a few hours) and yet the charge has not been removed... I like Hampton but it is certainly not worth having to deal with being double charged with no end in sight... evidentially, HLT does not understand that losing customers (forever) over scam practices is NOT a good business plan..."
Please! No Gov't bailout for any companys in the hospitality or gaming business!
"Hilton cancelled estimates earlier indicated the impacts are far more deeper. I expect the occupancy should drop drastically. If you look at the drop in airline and crusie ship to P/E of 4 to 6, HLT and Mariott international should drop close to that price earning ratios as heavy debt load and fixed costs to run almost empty hotels. cvPcould drop"
"Well I think this market has finally beat me. The rise in the futures right now has got me shocked. I don’t understand it, but I guess I don’t have to.Planning a cover of at least half my short this week, maybe even tomorrow. Can’t risk more than the 20% I’m already down on this.I know this market will crash, but it could also go to 3200 on the S&P before that.I may short again (if this hits in the $90’s) when the sentiment changes and it will. But I got it wrong and I will fully admit it.Good luck to all you fellow shorts, we have to he right plan. But the FED has another idea."
"Hold on to your HILTON mr Ackman, the pandemic is just beginning...look up the spanish flu, had 4 rounds...Hilton will go down hard....enjoy the ride."
"Just stayed in a Hilton in Florida. Employees were constantly cleaning, social distancing was being practiced everywhere (elevators included) and I would just swap out towels with the maids. VERY POSITIVE experience!"
"How in GOD's name is this stock going up? I work in the Hotel industry and it is a blood bath right now. Hotels are ghost towns and they are laying off employees left & right. Countless of my friends are on furlough right now... With Hospitality being one of the most affected industries right now, how, is this going up?"
How is the Company that is losing tons of money bc of reduced travel and lack of business travel which is permanently impaired at these high levels over $90. Insane to me.
"Right now $SPY, $DJI and $RUT are above their 10 day MA's and all have a positive slope. Also SPY never hit the 272 mark ( Which I indicated in a previous post would be a definitive entry point for a short). Therefore IMO we are headed up, at least. in the short term. Longs may hold here and shorts may carefully monitor their positions or cover. God Bless."
I would like to see HLT utilize the various advanced smart devices from AiTX at it’s properties. In addition to greatly increased safety and security and service it would also dramatically lower costs.
Just shorted some more at $66.80Let's see if I am right. Planning on starting to cover some at $56

"Trading 101Here's what I love about the market. Most of the time it moves opposite to how most retail investors think it will move. If the majority of the sentiment is bearish go long , if the majority of the sentiment is overly bullish look to short. Too much bearish sentiment on this board!"
"I'm with @Razor, No way this should be rising. Delusional to think recovery coming anytime soon. I put fair value at $48. ""one bad day"" is coming Conferences are toast, personal travel nonexistant and this doesn't change for the next year. Really want to go to NYC or Chicago anytime in next 12 months? I feel bad for the great staff at Hilton but happy to short the executives who try to rip me off with resort fees. $79 for the room and $42 resort fee at a regular property? don't rip me off, comes back around."

"I clearly agree with both of you Valueguy and Bryan. The markets are really underestimating the travel and leisure sectors. They will be lucky to survive this. The length of time that these will see near zero amounts to billions of dollars of losses minimum. Not to mention once things open the travel restrictions that will still be in place and just the human psyche reducing numbers greatly.I live in Toronto and this city hasn't even been hit that bad as of yet. We have all events cancelled all the way through the first week of August!! That included North America's largest Caribbean festival and largest Pride festival, not to mention countless other events. ie Canadian Music Week, Toronto Jazz Festival, North by Northeast, Tastemaker Toronto, The Hot Docs Festival, Inside Out Film Festival and Doors Open Toronto.the next things to be cancelled with be our CNE event and the TIFF Toronto Film Festival. The millions upon millions of visitors we have for these events will not be using hotels rooms over the next 5 months+This is going down, its just a matter of time."
How is this stock now at nearly all time highs. How is this worth now what it was back in January February??The prospects of this company are not anywhere near as bright as they were them for a 5 years timeline.If this hits $115 I am back in for a short on this puppy
I see $65 by end of day tomorrow. And higher by the end of week
"Interesting quotes. On surprise Memorial Day bump an strong uptick in summer reservations.

I'm curious - anyone holding or buying at current levels? I'd like to hear the long argument on this one. Is it simply that you'd expect HLT to EVENTUALLY go back to $120 after Covid goes away - maybe in a couple of years?
Razor The S&P 500's decline is 2.5 times greater than $HLT's decline.That is amazing strength! At the rate $HLT is going it may close where it opened or even greater.
"I'm puzzled by the continued run-up on HLT. I felt that Q2 results missed already low-balled numbers, and Hilton actually SEEMS to be doing worse than one might expect from industry-wide occupancy percentages. Any insight into why this is going up rather than down?"
"All this spam, I can't help but believe it is one of the cheerleading pumpers. As I said before. This board USED to be good until 7 months ago, when these ""so called Longs"" came out of nowhere spamming same $HlT everyday."

"Most absurd valuation ever.Hertz just filed for bankruptcy - demand for rental cars have vanished.How far off is Hilton from doing the same? If the virus has destroyed demand for rental vehicles, highly correlated to hotel reservations, what do people think, the hotels are packed?"
Yeah how is this stock at all time high
"This valuation based on lost revenue is out of control. COVID-19 cases and deaths are climbing, so travel is going down significantly. Business travel decreases significantly. Throw record unemployment into the mix....who stays in a hotel or travels when they're unemployed? No one!If they open entirely, they will be bleeding money for well over a year here. Great short now! Love the puts!"
This stock is one of the most overpriced and overvalued in the market based on their prospects for the next year!

"When most other beaten down companies share prices are rolling down around 10 year or more price levels, then you see Hilton only down to 2016 price levels, you realize this has a lot further to fall. Try comparing it to cruise line stocks, they've pulled back to 1993 price levels."

"aht still trading at very low price, take a look"
Very disappointed by Hampton Inns. I did a lot of traveling in the Fall and was extremely unhappy about 3 things:1. Prices skyrocketed from the previous year. Hotels in Remote Locations for 150.00 per night when comparable ones for 108.2. The Points from my AMEX card value has fallen from 1 per dollar to .50 cents per dollar.3. The Breakfast that was so great is now terrible in 80% of the Hampton inns no Scrambled eggs but an ugly mess of cheese and sausage 1/4 inches thick on a half bagel or a folded over ugly egg and cheese and taco inedible no homefries..I am taking another trip to Florida and using Holiday inn Express and DRURY INN far superior.If you agree with what I say thumbs up else thumbs down...
