Anyone care to offer a view how could HLT rise to this level in this environment?
"I just offloaded my put options on HLT since they'd gained 30%. I remain bearish on the fundamentals of HLT as well as the overall economy for the next 12 months, but I'm not confident that the market is always going to track with fundamentals, and felt it safer to exit given the next stimulus package that's in the offing.Options aside, I'm staying in cash for the next few months as this market is built on very weak foundations. GLTA."
Isn't this stock the $Hlt ?!!!!! I love it.
@ Razor... How's the short going. At this rate by Friday you should be able to short $HLT at $80.00
Which one will you buy right now to sell in 1 week?$WYNN $MGM $HLT $MAR
Please! No Gov't bailout for any companys in the hospitality or gaming business!
"This $HlT is forgien to me, can anyone translate action $HlT?"
"When most other beaten down companies share prices are rolling down around 10 year or more price levels, then you see Hilton only down to 2016 price levels, you realize this has a lot further to fall. Try comparing it to cruise line stocks, they've pulled back to 1993 price levels."
"Wait let me understand this. Ackman goes on TV and says Hilton could go to zero along with more down for general mkt, all the while he’s buying equities( Hilton is his biggest holding now). Isnt that a textbook case of securities fraud ?"
Hilton Worldwide reached an all time high at 146.97
"Hilton also expects the global health crisis to have a ""material negative impact"" on its business for an ""indeterminate length of time."" In other words ""we have no idea on how much money we will lose but rest assured it won't be as much as it could be"". And still the price goes up. Wow..."
1st quarter earnings reports are going to be pretty grim for most companies in the hospitality industry. A lot of other companies are now strapped for cash and are going to be opting for teleconferencing instead of sending employees on business trips for a while after this too. Lots of conferences and banquets will get postponed or cancelled through the end of the year in an effort to conserve cash and pay back short term debts accrued during the quarantine period. People thinking that it's going to be business as normal again in 2-3 weeks are delusional.
"This valuation based on lost revenue is out of control. COVID-19 cases and deaths are climbing, so travel is going down significantly. Business travel decreases significantly. Throw record unemployment into the mix....who stays in a hotel or travels when they're unemployed? No one!If they open entirely, they will be bleeding money for well over a year here. Great short now! Love the puts!"
"Hyatt's numbers were absolutely atrocious. Everything I've heard indicates that they're struggling HUGELY right now, too. Is there some expectation that Hilton is somehow doing better than Hyatt?"
"I don't really understand why hotel stocks are doing so well. They're reliant on business travel to the tune of ~75%, and business travel isn't coming back at least for the next year. Then again, I don't get the overall bullishness of the market either, and I feel eventually reality will set in. Buying puts on HLT, as I don't see Q2 earnings or Q3 outlook being pretty."
"If you discounted the cash of 1.179 billions that it generated assuming no decrease in revenue, which will be impossible, then it is a 72 dollar stock. Now, it the cash generation cut 20 percent to 0.9432 billions as Marriott indicating , then it is only a 51 dollars stock. There is long way to go down."
$aht https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ashford-hospitality-trust-provides-recent-234500485.html $18.32 cash per share sounds great. Even the naysayers value aht at $14-$23. FDA full vaccine approval means it will soar. $ht $mar $hlt $h
Someone on this board have an explanation to why HLT has not taken a hit to their stock price like the cruise lines and planes. It seems their stock price would have been affected just about as much as the airlines at least .
A PE of almost 500 in a pandemic with no change in business strategy? Good luck. Not for me.
"A trade expert acquires paying little mind to advertise variances, I began using kanielnolasco12 on telegram technical analysis in June last year, and he shared his crypto strategies and assisted me with good trading signals and now the benefit rate is outstanding."
"Most absurd valuation ever.Hertz just filed for bankruptcy - demand for rental cars have vanished.How far off is Hilton from doing the same? If the virus has destroyed demand for rental vehicles, highly correlated to hotel reservations, what do people think, the hotels are packed?"
$19 bucks off it ALL TIME HIGH and some properties are still shut down. Highest COVID cases ever just reported.. props that are open are 20% occupied.. makes no sense!!! even for a 5 year play?? please help me understand
I predict a similar fall to what we saw between June 8th and 11th. The market is over-heated IMO.
"Eventually, when this plays out, I can't help but think that there will be huge opportunities in airline and hospitality stocks. $DAL $LUV $MAR $HLT"
"Not doing business with any HLT brand ever again... we booked and paid an advance purchase in July for an August stay with a Hampton Inn in Monroe, MI... the number we paid was XXX.37...when we arrived we were again charged on the same credit card for XXX.39 (off by .02)... we spoke with the manager who said we would not be doubled charged... we have been for several months... it is now the middle of October... we have spent multiple calls to HLT ( a few hours) and yet the charge has not been removed... I like Hampton but it is certainly not worth having to deal with being double charged with no end in sight... evidentially, HLT does not understand that losing customers (forever) over scam practices is NOT a good business plan..."
I don’t understand why shorts keep coming to $AMD Message Board. They keep posting the same $hlt since AMD was at 12
$100 here we go
"I'm puzzled by the continued run-up on HLT. I felt that Q2 results missed already low-balled numbers, and Hilton actually SEEMS to be doing worse than one might expect from industry-wide occupancy percentages. Any insight into why this is going up rather than down?"
"Looks like you were right Timothy and I was wrong. I still think this is going down eventually, but not sure how long I can risk this short in full.What got me today was the fact the GDP number came in worse than expected and worst since the financial crisis (in a quarter that won't even be as bad as Q2) and we are still up 2.5% on the S&P and general markets.I'm lost for words, but I believe you said don't fight the Fed....even if this makes no sense whatsoever"
How is the Company that is losing tons of money bc of reduced travel and lack of business travel which is permanently impaired at these high levels over $90. Insane to me.
This is one crazy valuation...Hotel stock is so much higher than pre-pandemic in times all all the corona troubles. Makes no sense to me.The biggest Scandinavian chain - Scandic Hotels - trades at less than 50% of pre-pandemic (despite of being profitable in the last quarter). That's a reasonable valuation
"How in GOD's name is this stock going up? I work in the Hotel industry and it is a blood bath right now. Hotels are ghost towns and they are laying off employees left & right. Countless of my friends are on furlough right now... With Hospitality being one of the most affected industries right now, how, is this going up?"
"Razor for what it;s worth, I learned the hard way to abandon all reason and just look at what the market is telling me. When the market behaves like this, I used to think ""No way can this move up any further"", but I way Always proven wrong. So now I just follow, and I refuse to lead. As a note of caution, we don't know just how unreasonable the market can get before a correction. We may get to a point of irrational exuberance, where HLT reaches or even surpasses previous highs. We just don't know when the correction will occurs until it occurs. What we do know is that when it happens, it will catch most retail investors off guard and it will be devastating. Until then, my posts will be limited. God Bless."
"So, no matter what happens, there is no risk of losing money in the US Stock Market?1-3% Daily Capital Gains, 25-30% Monthly capital Gains are the new norms???No need to work anymore? Just buy the US Stocks and Get Quick Rich?What is the point of working, when the Government is PUMPING the Stock Prices Parabolically, while there is NO Real profit, Real Value, or Real Business?For instance, hotel's are empty and they are losing billions of dollars every week, but $MGM $HLT are hitting new multi year record high valuations every day. What is the Point of Doing business anymore?"
"Looks like my patience and conviction that this market was over valued is about to payoff.10% sell off on its way!Just wish I was able to load up on the short above $80!Long term investors, sell now and buy back lower!"
"The U.S. hotel industry occupancy was 48.6% in August, a record low for the month2 out of 3 hotels will go under in 6 months with no change in demandhttps://www.investopedia.com/majority-us-hotels-can-only-survive-6-more-months-at-current-levels-survey-5078938?utm_campaign=quote-yahoo&utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=referral&yptr=yahoo"
My girlfriend is at the executive level of a major hotel chain and just got word today of a 20% CUT of her Salary and a 75% layoff rate of her 22 hotels
Good evening from Japan.
"Timothy, you still around this board? How you feeling about the market and Hilton right now? See any signs?"
