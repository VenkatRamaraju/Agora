"I haven't followed APRN but the recent price spike on no news led me to the buyout rumor on the message board which got me interested.Word of caution, I was long on a company called 8point3 energy partners (CAFD); I thought it was a good dividend paying stock but the controlling shareholders were apparently tired of running it and agreed to sell to private equity for substantially less than the open market share price (also lower than my cost basis so I took a loss on the buyout). Curiosity led me to look at the 10-Q for APRN and this stood out, ""our chairman, Matthew B. Salzberg, held approximately 68.3% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. Because Mr. Salzberg controls a majority of the combined voting power of our outstanding common stock, he will be able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors and any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets, so long as the outstanding shares of Class B common stock represent at least 9.1% of the total number of outstanding shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock. This concentrated control will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters, including a change of control of our company, for the foreseeable future, and might affect the market price of our Class A common stock."""
"As more states go under lockdown APRN and WTRH will come into play in a major way. Regardless of what shorts or paid bashers say. They just show up to make amateur investors panic and sell. Notice how they cant stand longs but never mute anyone? Because they need someone to listen to them. Mute them, set max amount limit orders on your shares to keep shorts from borrowing them, be patient and relax. (shrugs)"
Warrants for everyone. Yeah.
First thing is first. Let’s close green on an ER for the first time.
Anybody see their rights hit their brokerage accounts?
"Better results than expected! But APRN lost another 4% of customers QoQ and they only reached their guidance because of the onion recall thing. COGS and PTGA costs in percentage of revenue further increased, i cant see how they can survive for long."
Where is Bastian? He was the only bear around here who had reasonable takes. Curious what his opinion on bankruptcy probability is in light of the new funding. That cash should buy them another year at least.
"In case you are wondering why the stock is up so much today: an insider bought $872,712 worth of APRN stock @ $4.53/share on 10/28. This follows a purchase on 9/22 by the same insider of $693,040 @ $6.30/share so in total around $1.55m - quite a show of confidence! Adding to the upwards pressure on the stock is a likely short squeeze."
Squeeze happening… funny how the shorts go away during these huge gains
Closing 5
Heat and it meals will be a game changer! Onwards and upwards from here!
Can it reach $12?
Come to PAPA!! $10 not far off.
you are welcome. i closed out my position and now the stock can rise again.
"Linda should do a great job with APRN. Her leadership is what is needed. If they could get creative and partner with a company like this, people wouldnt have to store much in the fridge and have room for more stuff. https://high-potential-stocks.market/PotentialBuyout"
How is that $12 a share doing?
anyone subscribe to the rights? or pass
"Got email today. I think this is a good move - Blue Apron Introduces Heat & Eat, its First Single-Serving Meals"
Wait and see. This will get back to $8 +. More baby boomers are starting to order these meals.
please reach $20.. you can do it ...
Why is this popping today?
"The recent moves - partnership with healthier America, streaming live cooking class with Sam Kass (should turn this into a more permanent thing), addressing eat-at-home with cooking-at-home with Heat-n-Eat and exit of Salzbergs with capital raise, are all very positive for the stock and makes me feel the leadership is getting it right. In the long term, APRN has a lot of growth + value potential. While it is a value play, growth in next few quarters should give great shot in the arm. imo This can easily be a 10 bagger but you will need to be patient and stay in for long term. This is not a financial advice."
BO Soon!
"Linda's emphasis on order growth per customer is an excellent metric, and could be the key to pulling this out of the fire. But APRN is on the clock. Not like a biotech where they can keep on diluting."
"The best part about the announcement is that Salzberg and his father are resigning from the board. I don't know what their management qualifications are, but their time with this company has seen the price do nothing but drop drop drop. Good luck to their replacements"
"Accumulated more than 100,000 shares mostly at $4 and below while anticipating what was really coming, And here we go."
"Linda (CEO) joined APRN in the second quarter of 2019, so lets summarize her first 2 years:positives:- average orders per customer increased from 4.6 to 5.3- average order value increased from 58.16$ to 62.72$negatives:- Q2 revenue increased by 3% in 2 years (despite being in the best possible scenario: covid)- COGS increased from 60.0% to 62.6% - AEBITDA dropped from 4.5m to -5.5m (ex. onion recall)- customers dropped from 449k to 375k (despite covid)- cash burn in the 2 years combined was >100m$- share price lost 60% of value since she startedthese results are devastating, especially when you think about the sector as a whole. Hellofreshs share price tenfolded since Linda started as CEO, Marley Spoons share price fivefolded, e-food spend of people more than doubled.As good as she was at Etsy, i dont think she is a good CEO in the meal kit industry. My advice: buy out 2-3 top hellofresh managers and try to turn it around asap, before money runs out."
blue apron in china ? wow omg
"Nearly $500,000,000 in sales and a loyal customer following might be worth something to Nestle, Walmart or even Amazon? Who knows? Or maybe even Kraft?The quality of the meal makes the meal prep worth the time. You cannot get that savory flavoring without the effort."
"My only advice would be not to rely on opinions on this board to buy/sell a stock. You will constantly see posters pushing other stocks only to have you buy them, so they can sell and you are holding an overpriced stock. Best to do your own diligence. Good luck"
This one is moving all over the place today. halted twice. Don't know what direction it's going to go but I'm in with puts.
"MAKING GOOD$$$$$$$ BY SELLING HIGH,BUYING DIPPING."
"Hey guy! I own a small position in the apron from $5.40, just 900 shares. I am confused and unfamiliar with the rights offering and what it entails for my position. Fidelity updated that in my acct last night and I frankly don’t know what it all means, as this is the first time any of my stocks do this. Can someone explain what happens to my current shares and what the whole situation is about? Again, this wasn’t an investment I kept track of, because of the small ordinal investment so no idea."
SEC filing says Linda bought 8000 shares in the open market on 9/3. A little too late.
$1.50 for sure
"I have been long on this train wreck for the last 3-4 years.. obviously holding a bag right now at a pretty high cost.. I wanted to remain constructive on this name but I just struggle to see how this company loses cash in a once in a lifetime environment tailor made for this industry! Market obviously expanded tremendously as evidenced by Hello Fresh which has added $500m in sales per quarter ! Yet APRN barely adds $10-$15m and manages to lose free cash flow on that performance! They come up with new excuses every quarter! With fixed costs steady at ~$35m over the last many quarters, they mathematically cannot make money till they generate revenue above $125m range! It is gut wrenching to see this company not get it right quarter after quarter! I am also shocked that equity investors forked over $40m at $9 per share only to be served this quarter? What kind of due diligence did they do? At least it makes me feel good that “professional” investors also got it wrong with this one... smh!!!!!!"

The pullback is all technical. We have hit descending channel (built since mid-2020) resistance at $8.97. Just buy the dips and we will test $9 again this week and highly likely break it.
"Happy that they raised capital, but don’t understand why the founder resigned from the board AND participated in the recap. Makes me think he’ll blow out of his shares sooner rather than later and keep the warrants."
"Aprn and the short squeeze..I don't understand why only one side of the coin is shown: the short sellers have their justification because they point out ailing companies and clean up the market ..... .I hear nothing of the problem that arises when a company creates the turnaround. Then the short sellers are a millstone on the leg, because they have to keep these companies under water to avoid losses. Sometimes until the company drowns although it can be saved. This is what is happening with Blue Apron, through corona and restructuring the company has turned around. But the shortsellers are holding the stock down, even though it should be trading five times higher. Join us on https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6xm19/blue_apron_to_the_moon/"
"Comparative data is sparse but for the three meal kit centric companies that trade publicly and service the US (half of HelloFresh's & Marley Spoon's global market and Blue Apron's only market), here are some interesting data points (from Q1 ER's and converted into $US). Total revenues for the three were 1.22B with 5.9M customers.HFG's Q1 revenues were $794M (65%) with 4.2M customers (71%). MMM's revenues were $49M (4%) with .3M customers (4%).APRN's revenues were $376M (30%) with 1.4M customers (24%).During their respected ER's, all noted that they had a COVID19 bump in the last weeks of Q1 and expect a strong Q2. HFG just upped their Q2 guidance noting a 100% increase in revenue curiously on the same number of customers.Since the last weeks of Q1:HFG has moved up near linearly from the high $20's to over $60 (150%) before pulling back in the last week or so. Their market cap is $8.2M.MMM moved up in two jolts from $0.40 to $1.40 (250%). Their market cap is about $244M.APRN has hovered around $10 not including a few spikes and drops and is now at around $13. It's market cap is 173M.The market cap for all three is about $8.5B.So riddle me this.?If HFG's portion of the market is generously noted as 70% and MMM's is 5% with APRN at 25%, how long will APRN's market cap be just 2% of HFG's and less than MMM's?I suspect that were it not for shorts, APRN would be trading higher. Perhaps HFG is overvalued and I am not suggesting that APRN is worth 25% of the market ($2B cap with a $160 share price). I am not even suggesting that APRN is worth it's $1B IPO. But today, APRN should at the very least be on par at about $25 per share ($330M cap). Since all three companies do the same thing in the exact same way, it's safe to expect that both APRN and MMM will post solid Q2 gains perhaps better than HFG's. And while MMM and HFG have already popped and may likely pop again after earnings, APRN has yet to pop once."
"Let's hope that Blue Apron's management and BOD does not accept any offers for a secondary offering, like what happened today with Beyond Meat. That how the shorts rig the system. When they see they can't cover their short positions at attractive prices, they then approach the company (disguised as a reputable financial firm) for a secondary offering. This way they use the shares to cover their short positions. It's downhill from here for Beyond Meat. With the founders of Blue Apron so heavily invested in the company I don't think they'll let something like this happen. APRN wlll fly to uncharted territories if we don't let the shorts off the hook."
6.60 is resistance. Once broken 7.60 is next. Adding more at these dips. We will test breaking 6.60 again soon. Good luck longs!
APRN will be 5 after the lunch time. Load up more guys.
"Its an underwritten offering with a price of $9.25. The drop to that price should be expected. I view this as a strong positive for the company. They ended Q2 with $45M in liquidity and will add another ~$40M with this offering giving them almost $90M of liquidity to get aggressive on marketing and product offerings. This stock has never traded on fundamentals given the threat of bankruptcy. Now that they have liquidity cushion, the valuation should start to reflect a more going concern company. As a reminder, HelloFresh trades at 4x TTM revenue and APRN trades at 0.3x! Not saying 4x valuation is the target but its definitely better than 0.3x."
Dave where are art thou?
"Any one loaded up 2000, 5000 shares this morning?"
Not sure about this stock. Will buy back if drops below 5 again.
Run shorties run. $10 next.
"Just saw this on Blue Apron Reddit page.Save Blue Apron - Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Is￼Blue Apron is one of those stocks (APRN) you heard about that is heavily shorted. The shorts have been playing her since this summer. Currently trading at about $10 when it should be trading at around $40 just to be on par (customers & revenue) with Marley Spoon (MMM). If they were to be on par with HelloFresh, APRN would be pricing around $80.That‘s right, this wonderful meal kit company, one of only three publicly traded meal kit companies serving the US market and the industry’s founding brand, has about 6% of the combined customer base and revenue (12% if you factor in that APRN ONLY operates in the US which represents 1/2 of the global meal kit market).Sadly shorts have been crushing Blue Apron to the point where it’s market cap is just 1% of the combined investment in these three companies. It should be 6x if you compare APRN to its global competitors. And if you focus solely on the US market as Blue Apron does, it’s value should be 12x - near its IPO price of $150 ($10 followed by a 15:1 reverse split).Word here and elsewhere is that if just a small number of retail investors each buy just a handful of shares, a short squeeze will kick in. Before the GameStop thing, APRN was around $7 and even then, heavily shorted so shorts where targeting a lot lower ($4ish). Since then, to shorts dismay, APRN has been stubbornly movingup, hovering now around $10.All Blue Apron needs is a gentle push and the shorts will do the rest. Once the stock begins to move up toward levels where it should be trading ($39, $60, $120), shorts will create their own buying frenzy simply to cover their positions.So as you plan your APRN orders this week, take a few bucks (just a weeks worth of food perhaps) and buy a few shares of Blue Apron. Not only will you be feeding your soul, you’ll likely make a handsome return.Oh and by the way, Blue Apron reports Q4 results next Thursday 2/18/21 before markets open. Q4 is an indoor quarter (in addition to the uptick in COVID) and word is that the numbers should be impressive. Then on next day - Friday, February options expire. I suggest picking up a few shares this week as historically, prices go up entering the week befpore earnings.As others note, Blue Apron is extremely undervalued. But don’t just take my word for it. Please do your own research and if inclined to, report here. I would love to hear your thoughts too."
In a couple of weeks Dave will chant the drop from $12 to $11 and call APRN the worst stock.
"I am a sad long $40 after RS, but a raving fan of the product. The quality is consistently excellent. The proteins are often higher quality than I can get at my local grocery. I love to cook, so I look forward to the kits. I’ve tried HelloFresh , and while it’s usually a quicker prep, it’s not the same quality. Just sharing thoughts."
"Another point about the offering - Although it is dilution, because the warrants in the offering are 7 years out @ $15, $18, and $20, people who buy the shares are in it to hold their shares until the price is over $15, $18, $20, or for the full time limit, 7 years, no matter how high the price/share.I'm long call options."
A law firm of ill repute (check google reviews) claiming to be nationally ranked is out to help his short selling clients by engaging in its standard practice of filing fake claims of shareholder rights violation and breach of fiduciary duty only to get the stock price down. Folks invested in APRN with long term view should ignore this kind of sideshows.
"Blue Apron should capitalize on this and get a celebrity to cook the recipes live stream. This is a no brainer and could encourage thousands to join and share part. The Peloton of cooking.SP can easily cross 10. Company should only accept new customers with 6 mo min term, go after density in apartment communities (members benefit from neighbors), request gov't grant to expand business to help Americans during this shutdown."
"I am long on this stock. Its customers are upper middle class and above. Those are the people who have money and can afford this. This crisis gives them a chance to try Blue Apron and Blue Apron doesn't have to spend marketing money to attract them. After the crisis is over, those people would still give Blue Apron a try. In the past APRN spend a ton of money trying to get people who don't have money. Those people would dine and dash after the promotion period is over. Blue Apron doesn't need those customers. What APRN needs to do now is to provide great customer service so the Upper Middle Class and above like the service and remain loyal customers after the crisis is over."
Blue Apron should partner with a chef who makes marijuana-infused dishes. Bring in some new subscribers. Improve margins on meals.
"Wider selection, less clients, higher costs, more dilution. Not looking good."
This can easily reach 15-20$ this week... Now after all test kits company made tons of money... investors are looking at the next thing and delivery food companies could be it just like this one. Specially knowing ppl wont be going out for the next 3-6 weeks. I bought 400 shares today at 5.80$ liking what i see so far going to tomorrow.
"Instead of the messy rights/warrants, this is the kind of offerings I can deal with because you know the bid by a Fund “Kosmos Energy Ltd. (""Kosmos"" or the ""Company"") (NYSE/LSE:KOS) announced today the pricing of its registered underwritten public offering of 37,500,000 shares of common stock (the ""Offering"") at a price to the public of $3.30. In addition, Kosmos has granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 5,625,000 shares of common stock at the public offering price less underwriting discounts. The Offering is expected to close on October 19, 2021, subject to customary closing conditions.”"
"Volume has been soaring foe several days now something is happening….this would be an excellent meme Reddit stock candidate , low volume heavily shorted……"
Beef cake panty hose.
Blue Apron raised delivery fees from zero to 10$. Be prepared for high churn next quarter. Maybe they can slightly raise their margin with that.
Looks like short squeeze coming they are out in droves begging this to crash but it can soar higher if squeeze occurs
I'm long on this stock not becuase they will destroy Q1 and Q2 estimates. That's a give in. I'm long here because this pandemic is the largest free advertising budget this company could ever have. They are bringing in masses of new customers who never used their service and a certain percentage will become long term customers. That's the long game here. Imagine investing in a company that currently has an unlimited advertising budget that they aren't paying for. Their cost to acquire a new customer must be now at record lows! Wonderful for profitability!

The CEO should do more press. This company has potential.
APRN way undervalued.
"I recently watched a YT video from about 8 months ago with the CEO talking on CNBC about how they are focused on obtaining the customers that will be ""great customers"" for them -- those that will stick with them for a long period of time. Can someone explain to me the characteristics of this target customer? Singles? Families? Married couple no kids?I can't fathom who would stay a customer of any meal kit delivery service for a long time. I am asking true longs here who believe in the product what about the product that you think will make Blue Apron more than just a fad product? How can Blue Apron compete with MEAL delivery service, GROCERY delivery service, and free easy access to cooking instruction on the internet? I just don't see where meal kit deliveries fit in other than a novelty purchase for a date night.I don't know enough about the markets to make an educated guess on short term stock price. But I would bet a lot long term the CURRENT product / trajectory will lead to failure. It's possible of course they exit with a sale or pivot completely to something different -- but i see CEO strategy is to double down on obtaining new ""better"" customers.Thoughts?Disclaimer: I shorted a little bit at $14.00, knowing this stock could do ANYTHING in the short term during these extraordinary times."
Daave!!!
Seems things are getting heated.. just heat and eat guys. 
They had some interesting insights about APRN on (http://Pick-stocks.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"A couple of thoughts about yesterday's news release. I have come to learn that the meal kit industry cannot seem to make quick adjustments to market conditions and as such, is slow to turn and therefore harder to steer. With that in mind, yesterday's announcement is actually big news. While you may not agree with BA's strategic decision to focus on higher margin, repeat customer business, this is the direction the company mapped out prior to Corona. And these new options are a response to this focus.Given that COVID-19 is not going anywhere soon and that meal kit providers will benefit from this, Blue Apron including, rolling out a more formal focus on upscale business is likely going to produce continue positive results.It's not like they are all over the place here. Like offering a low cost competitor to Dinnerly or Everyplate. They are focused on the high end and this announcement is in line with that strategy."
"I bought shares this morning. If I understand right, I'll be entitled to take part in the offering, same as anyone holding at the EOD today."

What are thoughts going into the earnings call next week? I bought in at high $4's and am a little concerned where the company is headed - believe the PT of $10 seems high - but looking for any good news here as $3's seems undervalued
"Linda needs go for sure. Way underperforming the others in the sector. Bring in the successful competitors top level performers, enticing for success and see what happens."
"This will undoubtedly go bankrupt. Meal kits were a fad, and even if they aren't, there are way too many meal kit companies for any individual to survive through elevated customer acquisition costs and lower lifetime values. I don't even know how much this market has already consolidated over the years but it's not enough."
Surprised to see no recent posts on this--stock is up 17% as of 2:30. Of course this board used to be all bashers so I guess they've gone but I was still hoping someone had some insight into why this stock has been so strong recently.
"So with HFG finally reporting Q4 figures last week (along with MMM and APRN prior ERs), here is a quick reality check (all figures converted to US$ and as of today 3/11).Total revenue for this group in Q4 was $1.53B and HFG is the group leader with 87% of that revenue, APRN at 8% and HFG at 5%. And of the groups 5.97M customers, HFG again is the group leader with 89% of the customers while MMM has 5% and APRN has 6%.But if you focus strictly on US numbers (APRN’s only market and one that represents over 50% of both MMM’s and HFG’s revenue and customers), HFG is still this group’s leader with 82% of the revenue while MMM holds 5%. But in their sole market, APRN has 13% of the group’s revenues.The same is true for customers. Of the total 3.1M total customers, HFG has 84% while MMM has 5% to APRN’s 11% (also note that means higher revenue per customer for APRN).Give or take a point here or there, these percentages have held true all year.Even with today’s APRN pop and HFG’s and MMM’s drops over the last few weeks, APRN still only has a market cap of 1%! MMM is still around 4%!That’s right, APRN is undervalued by 400% if compared to just MMM’s global operations in which APRN leads in both revenue (60%) and customers (20%).If comparing to how the others operate in the US, APRN’s valuation should be near IPO levels.Can you say “institutional short-selling”? Can you spell “short squeeze?”"
"slow, strong and steady"
"All the negative comments, trade the stock for what it is, none of you made accurate comments today’s! Good luck to the traders and longs that are making money"

"Just a matter of time before this company goes bankrupt, I’m surprised is still around."
This is a long play now. Business model has changed and the chart is extremely bullish.
"Just because shorts push the stock down doesn’t mean the company is in bad shape. In 2018 BA built out their supply chain and eliminated wasteful marketing efforts that were not effective. Revenue sank on purpose and now the build is underway. In 2019 new talent - hungry to find success- has been hired and they are working on strategic plans to grow revenue in a profitable way. Anyone who understands business strategy and operations can see a plan is in the works. There are multiple simple ways to expand revenue at BA that leverage core strengths found in their solid customer base, strong distribution system and relented employees. Day traders who don’t know how business works will find a new stock to short in the near future."
"I commented yesterday on how this board seemed to lack pumpers and dumpers or paid posters. Apparently I didn't look deep enough. All opinions aside, here is what I see for what its worth. First, we have definitely dipped in the past week, but seemingly a bit too much. Those posting things that are little more than scare tactics about BK are just that... scare tactics. Even without any additional finding, APRN will last another 3 to 4 quarters. No one is going BK next week or down to 4 or 5 dollars anytime soon. We have been going down on low volume -- just showing that this stock doesn't take much to move it EITHER WAY. The slightest news has moved this $2 or more in a day. Someone made a respectful comment that COVID has not helped this stock. I respectfully disagree. It has increased demand for the product both in the sector and from APRN themselves. The reason APRN couldn't capitalize was simply because it was unexpected demand on the heels of closing one of their distribution plants. Directing my focus to APRN themselves as many times IR will actually look at boards to get a sense of where people stand. While I'm not one to believe in fake rumors of buyouts and all the rest, it seems getting your house in order with management and the board might be imparative. You have a fiduciaty responsibility to your shareholders -- and given your price movement, you are ripe for an activist to come along and help you attain the right value. It might be the right time to really look at customer feedback, pricing and your competition to determine why they are outperforming you. Given this pandemic and all the restaurants closing in local areas, your customer base is ever-increasing. And I would be fairly certain that your new class A shareholders don't want to see this price-point when they just paid $9.25/share.I mentioned yesterday that this stock is technically near a bottom -- but I've held stocks that went from $11 to $4 -- all while on a technical bottom. They all went back up... but technical bottoms can be little more than falling knives. I wouldn't use this as your guide. All that said, I do believe in this company long term and certainly through the fall and winter. Unfortunately I feel we are far from done with COVID.Good luck to those holding (and shorting)... we are all here to make money. I'm just on the long side of things. Be safe."
$97M extremely cheap for a company generating $500M in revenues. There are plenty of opportunities for this company to transition to a more profitable model. Management not doing enough to focus on their fundamentals. In my opinion a company with these revenues won't be written off so quickly.
This rise smells like share sale coming. Management champions shareholders dilution. They have invented the game.
"Great to see good ol aprn in the news and running up today. Its amazing how much of a discount this is at this price, those shorts were really hammering this like it was a full time job in construction. This should be higher especially with the uncertainties of the pandemic. Go blue !!!! I averaged down and looking forward to double digits again."
Oh. Yeah.

(the “Company”) has determined to temporarily reopen its fulfillment center in Arlington, Texas beginning in January 2021. As the Company previously disclosed, it closed its Arlington fulfillment center in the second quarter of 2020. The Company decided to temporarily reopen the Arlington fulfillment center to allow it to focus on utilizing existing assets as one of its operating initiatives to help supplement labor quickly, as the Company believes that there is a more readily available labor pool in and around the Arlington fulfillment center. The Company believes that this temporary reopening initiative will enable the Company to leverage existing assets to meet forecasted demand while it continues to identify and implement other operating efficiencies.Consistent with the Company’s previously disclosed expectation of approximately $8.0 million of annual cost savings in product, technology, general and administrative expenses, the Company expects to incur costs of approximately $2.0 million in the first quarter of 2021 to reopen and operate the Arlington fulfillment center."
I feel like I'm seeing things . awesome two days
Looks like CEO is putting skin in the game good sign
"With the current developments with BOD, I can say APRN is heading to IPO valuation in a year. If you are not reading the room then you should not trade APRN. This is already so much undervalued compared to its competitors and now CEO is able to shape the company as she liked for the first time."
"order your meal today, don't go out for dinning."
"elevator down. puts at 3,4,5"
Dave and the rest of Shorts are very nervous holding over weekend and into Earnings!!!
"Starting about a month ago they're charging an average $3 more per order. That works out to roughly .25c per share per quarter. Analysis estimates haven't adjusted for that yet. Everything else being the same, it would make next year break even. When it becomes apparent that that's going to happen, maybe after Q3 report, maybe after Q4, the stock is likely to go into the teens I think. I have call options."
They will apparently push this to $10 so that the October subscription rights offering will look like peanuts. APRN is super undervalued and I am expecting it to run to a billion $ market value in a year. Loading up every dip. This will be the easiest money I will be making in my trading career.
What price should I sell?
So RJB Partners LLC is buying $30M shares at $10 per share and also underwriting another $45M worth of shares at $10? And the whole deal is guaranteed? Why is the stock not at $10 already?
"It seems like there’s a natural price ceiling around $9 while the rights offering is taking place. That is, the stock price exceeds $9, any potential buyer should just participate in the rights offering which gives you, 1 share plus 1.4 warrants for $10. I think savvy investors can print money by selling otm calls during this period."
"The announcement of these four new board members is most certainly timely, just ahead of Q3 reporting. This should bode well for Blue Apron especially from an investor's standpoint. Good talent from a wide variety of disciplines.One note of interest that caught my eye. Ms. Carr-Smith is noted as having Executive Director roles at among others, ""Australia-based Woolworths Group"". Now I have not had the time this morning to dig back into their online statements, but I recall seeing Woolworths Group listed as a substantial holder of Marley Spoon. Don't know if that is still the case and will have to look later."
If this stock get miraculously acquired I predict 13.25 for the buy out. That is about 60% of annual gross sales. Or it goes BK.
Sold my shares today and will buy back in when it dips again. This is a good trading stock. I’d hold going into earning though. Their new prepped line is sure to add much needed revenue.
can blue apron reach 12 dollars .. that's the question
Anyone mind if I take over this company? It'll be an easy way to make myself 100m or so.
"Dave, you should stop deleting your messages when price movement doesn't favor your views. Stand behind your words, man."
dilution
This is going back to 10 look out below shorts!
Oh yeaaa MONEY
"My investment thesis on APRN:(1) Better new APRN- Since mid-2019, the company has- a new CEO with high pedigree (ex-Etsy, Evernote, Alibaba), stopped chasing unprofitable customers & low potential partnerships (grubhub, costco, jet.com), tightened its distribution network. Current APRN>Old Aprn(2) COVID to the rescue- APRN's core customer is 50+ in age, $100k+ in income and is at COVID risk. High capacity utilization will continue beyond the sold out April-Mid-May period and will lead to low marketing spend, better operating leverage which will lead to positive cash flows. ""Running out of cash"" fear delayed!(3) HelloFresh thrives- HF with far better financials trades at 3x revenue compared to 0.3x for APRN. APRN has solid brand recall but a constrained balance sheet. Whether that deserves a 90% discount is debatable esp during COVID."
I believe APRN will trade at $10 base + cash soon. Do your math.
this is bound to crash
"Under the terms of the Terminated Lease, Blue Apron leased approximately 431,000 square feet of warehouse space in Fairfield, California (the “Facility”). As previously disclosed by the Company, the Company has not occupied and does not currently occupy the Facility. In connection with the Lease Termination Agreement, Blue Apron agreed to pay a termination fee in the amount of $1.5 million, which will release the Company from all further rent obligations to Landlord in the amount of approximately $33 million, which otherwise would have expired on June 30, 2028, resulting in ongoing annual cash savings of approximately $3.5 million."
"Canaccord Analyst almost tripled Blue Apron price target this morning based on ""heightened demand."""
friday should be interesting
I smell BO over the weekend?
4 is next...either today or tomorrow.
"I had to make a decision about a month ago. Zoom or blue apron. I’m a little bit more risk in the market than conservative. The choice was zoom at $114 or blue apron at $9.50. Both are benefiting from covid 19. Zoom has major security breach and management immediately admits its mistake and hires the proper personnel to fix the problem. That builds confidence for me. This is why, imho, this stock is close to $170 now. 50% gain. Makes one think a little or a lot. Blue apron needs to install that confidence, for investors like me to be long. Aggressive, smart, proactive,innovative. I realize before the rebuttal comes that food and technology and market caps are different. I get it. I bought more of this stock at $11.55. As with anything in life, I sure could use some confidence that this company will seize its opportunity."
Be prepared for share holder dilution. Enough said.
"Up or down in the short-term, longs have nothing to worry about. With only 8M shares in float, a 50% short interest and a tiny market cap, D.E. Shaw could squeeze this stock to high double-digits with very little effort. Shaw did not take a 5% stake to lose. Let's see who else come in."
It?s been over a month since I canceled. I?m still thoroughly #$%$ at the CEO for announcing a price increase to the financial press before it was announced to BA?s customers.
"Can someone explain, whats a rights offering? Is that like those other offerings where it makes the stock price dramatically plunge?"
Is there any franchise value in the business. If yes management might favor a quicky sale out instead of going through bankruptcy.
Promising equity raiseIn for 100 shares
Any reason for the steady rise?
So folks would you be holding stock going into earnings or waiting to buy after earning?
Hellofresh just announced that their Q2 revenue went up by more than 60% YOY. So APRN lost another big share of the market while competiton is skyrocketing.
Short squeeze started today! Load up! Too cheap! $20 possible!
"Today, let us talk a bit about Morgan Stanley and Canaccord Genuity and their many relationships with Blue Apron.1) An entity affiliated with Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, who is an underwriter in this offering, is administrative agent, collateral agent and a lender under our revolving credit facility and will receive more than 5% of the proceeds of this offering upon repayment of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility. As a result, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC will be deemed to have a “conflict of interest” within the meaning of FINRA Rule 5121.2) that a “qualified independent underwriter,” as defined in the rule, has participated in the preparation of the registration statement and prospectus and exercised the usual standards of due diligence with respect thereto. Canaccord Genuity LLC is assuming the responsibilities of acting as the “qualified independent underwriter3) In order to facilitate the offering of the Class A common stock, the underwriters may engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Class A common stock. Specifically, the underwriters may sell more shares than they are obligated to purchase under the underwriting agreement, creating a short position. A short sale is covered if the short position is no greater than the number of shares available for purchase by the underwriters under the optionThe background is pretty normal, but also implies that Morgan Stanley work with Blue Apron and Canaccord to profit from a significant short position for the last two months.Before the offering, Canaccord raised their price target to $18. Canaccord, acting as the ""qualified independent underwriter"", supposedly made sure that the offering did not break any rules.Blue Apron, knowing about this short setup, but wanting the $35 million cash infusion from the follow-on offering, torpedoed their own ""best quarter ever"" results by submitting an absurdly low Q3 guidance number.... which wasn't a lie because of how it was phrased...And today, Morgan Stanley, maintaining an equal weight guidance, lowers their price target to $5.60, when the market price is above $7, and a day before monthly options expire.Fellas, Blue Apron, Morgan Stanley, and Canaccord are all working together to manipulate the price freefall for the last couple of months..."
Could be a huge short squeeze coming
Wait for 2.5
"A few observations-1. They started taking orders for May 7 onwards delivery almost 10 days ago and May 7 is still available as a delivery date. So looks like the initial ""sold out"" phenomenon has slowed either due to lack of interest or increased capacity that they created.2. If you google meal-kits, you no longer see those $60/$80 off of your first box ads from all of the meal kit companies. The CAC will likely be much lower in the month of April helping their marketing expenses.3. The options open interest is the highest at $15 call (6600+ contracts). Call options at $11 or above exceed put options at $11 or below by a ratio of ~2.5x.Will say it again.. Q1 will largely come in line with expectations.. revenue decline of ~30% with net loss near $20M. Its the Q2 guidance that matters which I expect to be robust. Any positive update on strategic process (especially cash infusion) will also be a booster."
This is a very cool stock to mess with you cant have weak hands to own this stock when we dip stop bashing its simply taking some money off the table
Strange that volume has been up huge why?
Seeing aprn dragged down in the mud by shorts to this extent is disturbing.
P&d lmao
A few steps up for mankind. One giant leap down for blue apron. No oxygen left which is why they turned blue.
You have 2 days before next week to aquire weight on sektor approved stockAdtxDon't screw up next long type sava run.S E K T O RLIFTS HOODER'S LIKE COVID CHECKSTHE ROBINHOODER'S PREACHER
"Fascinating to see all the negative spins on EVERYTHING today! Yes, it's disappointing that current quarter wasn't profitable just yet, and very disappointing that company is still struggling with production while blaming Covid on this. However, pretty much everything else is actually positive:1. Loss is smaller loss forecasted by company 3 months ago2. Revenues up 13% year/year (would have been higher but company reduced advertising due to stated production capacity issues)3. Financial situation much improved by having sold 4,000,000 shares 3 months ago for a net proceeds after fees of $32.9m (i.el. shares were sold at a price a little above $8.00/share) + new revolving credit4. Tailwinds still in place for at least the next few quarters given the virus resurgence 5. Increased revenue per customer (the highest it has been since 2015)All this in for a company operating in the meal kits market where the Blue Apron product is rated one of the best, with competitor Hello Fresh sporting a market cap of $11B versus Blue Apron $115m. Yes, Blue Apron must fix their production issues to regain some market share from Hello Fresh (and others) - which they are painfully aware I am sure. No question that it is taking too long and no convincing explanation has been provided by management today, but it's not unreasonable to assume fixing production - or at least improving it - is the top priority for management and board.I take note that the fact that board no longer seeking to sell the company is somehow also spun as a negative - as it's a bad thing that company has shored up liquidity, improved revenues, hired new board members and planning to continue to run the company. Note also that an acquisition offer for the company is not at all off the table just because the board is no longer actively looking for a suitor.On a personal note, I subscribed to the product a few weeks ago, having never cooked before in my life. Absolutely loving it, excellent product all around and well designed easy to use mobile application. Picking the meals we want 1,2 and 3 weeks in advance is exciting and fun. And, yes, I subscribed now because the pandemic leading to going to restaurants less and having more time at home."
Paper hands are selling. Stay strong. We will see 10 ! #APRN #WTRH
"General question, would Blue Apron management accept an acquisition offer for 500M in September? Or do you think they would hold out for 12 months and a higher offer?"
lot of ham and eggers on this board this is a simple stock that will trade around 6 to 10 range buy the dips and dump this piece and wait for the fall back dont put to much thinking into this piece
Why volume so high ?
"Competitor Marley Spoon (MMM) posted earnings today. Revenue growth in the US slowed dramatically from 98% YOY in Q1 to 7% in Q2, contribution margin dropped from 28% to 24% and they still see labour shortages as well as input price & CPM inflation.If these trends were the same for APRN (which were already at just 27% Q1 growth) than i cant see anything positive for the company."
ouch
"Just some points worth restating now that HFG, MMM, and APRN (the three publically traded meal kit companies with operations in the US) have all posted Q3 numbers. Instead of looking at year over year quarters, I am more focused on COVID back to back quarters and here is the run down (Euro & Australian Dollars converted to US$).MMM has 362K global customers and HFG hit 5M global customers. But in the US, MMM has only 180K customers up slightly from Q2 (4K). HFG lost US customers from Q1 to Q2 (2.64M down to 1.98M). They regained some of that reaching 2.49M customers in the US during Q3. APRN dropped from 396K in Q2 to 357K in Q3. I am not suggesting anything here just pointing out US market sizes and that for MMM and HFG, the US represents a significant 50% of their customer base.As for revenue, MMM decreased from $83.3M (Q2) to $81.5M (Q3) with US revenue going down from $43.5M to $40.2M. HFG global revenue increased from $1,102M to $1,148M with US revenue increasing from $598M to $623M. APRN’s revenue decreased from $131M to $112M. Again, just stating numbers.The global market for these three includes 5.72M customers with combined revenues of about $1.34B. Of that HFG has over 87% of global customers and about 86% of the group’s revenue. MMM has a little over 6% of the group’s customer base and 6% of the group’s revenue. APRN also has a little over 6% of the group’s customer base but over 8% of the group’s revenue. MMM revenue per customer is about $225 and HFG’s is about $220. APRN’s revenue per customer is significantly higher at over $313 per customer!As of yesterday afternoon, MMM’s market cap was $330M and HFG’s market cap was $9,172M both down after earnings just like APRN. APRN’s market cap was only $109.5M. The total market cap for all three is over $9.6B. Naturally, HFG owns the lion’s share of the market and about 95% of the market cap. MMM’s percentage of the market cap is about 3.5%. APRN’s market cap is just over 1% as compared to the other two even though its numbers are on par with MMM which lost 30% of its shareholder value right after earnings due to dilution. I suggest APRN is way undervalued. And if you factor in the reality that APRN only operates in the US while both MMM and HFG report that the US is about 50% of their customer base and revenue, then APRN’s value actually doubles in comparison. My conclusion for this stock’s inept valuation is that it has been toyed with and hopefully that time has now passed."
Reddit is here. $100 coming!!!
about too fly
Where is Dave?
"My estimates for the profit margin in Q1 (correct me if you have other opinions):Revenue in Q1 2019 was 142m, in the last quarters the revenue decline was at round about -30%.Q1 2020 revenue (ex corona) would be around 100m. With double the revenue in second half of may it would be around 116m. COGS was 61% in Q4 2019, and Q1 is in general a quarter with higher margin, so lets assume 59% COGS (Gross profit: 48m)Lets assume marketing was cut by 50% in comparison with Q1 2019 (7m marketing costs).PTGA, D&A and other income should be the same as in Q4 2019 (44m).Profit = 48m - 7m - 44m = -3m (excl. special items like factory closing)So APRN is still not profitable but this will change in Q2."
"I’ve said this in the past but I think it bears repeating. APRN is more than likely going bankrupt, but if it doesn’t go bankrupt it’s going to be worth an order of magnitude more than it is now. The expected value is higher than market cap, so going long makes sense. But, I think a lower risk play is a short position combined with OtM calls."
