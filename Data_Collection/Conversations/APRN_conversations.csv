I originally intended to buy early November.
friday should be interesting
"Dave, please check in today. I want to mark you as safe."
Where is Dave?
Where is Bastian? He was the only bear around here who had reasonable takes. Curious what his opinion on bankruptcy probability is in light of the new funding. That cash should buy them another year at least.
Sold my shares today and will buy back in when it dips again. This is a good trading stock. I’d hold going into earning though. Their new prepped line is sure to add much needed revenue.
Anybody see their rights hit their brokerage accounts?
Can it reach $12?
"Instead of the messy rights/warrants, this is the kind of offerings I can deal with because you know the bid by a Fund “Kosmos Energy Ltd. (""Kosmos"" or the ""Company"") (NYSE/LSE:KOS) announced today the pricing of its registered underwritten public offering of 37,500,000 shares of common stock (the ""Offering"") at a price to the public of $3.30. In addition, Kosmos has granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 5,625,000 shares of common stock at the public offering price less underwriting discounts. The Offering is expected to close on October 19, 2021, subject to customary closing conditions.”"
Looks like CEO is putting skin in the game good sign
I looked at the company's site and they are advertising positions in Austin. Did not Apron have third facility in Texas earlier?
So RJB Partners LLC is buying $30M shares at $10 per share and also underwriting another $45M worth of shares at $10? And the whole deal is guaranteed? Why is the stock not at $10 already?
"I was asked about my view on the company @mark : So bankruptcy is certainly far away after recent funding. Without it it would be difficult to get into 2022. So that was obviously a nice boost for stock price. I am much less negative than a few months ago right now, but they still loose market share. So we have a business which grows high single digit with potential of profitability in a few quarters. 0,5x revenue seems fair to me right now."
"Dave is moving out of his house this weekend, Downsizing after his APRN short blew up."
"With the current developments with BOD, I can say APRN is heading to IPO valuation in a year. If you are not reading the room then you should not trade APRN. This is already so much undervalued compared to its competitors and now CEO is able to shape the company as she liked for the first time."
"Got email today. I think this is a good move - Blue Apron Introduces Heat & Eat, its First Single-Serving Meals"
"rights offering, thought someone here would provide opinion on purchasing or not..."
Glad I shorted this company lol. They just issued another offering and I’ll be shorting again
They will apparently push this to $10 so that the October subscription rights offering will look like peanuts. APRN is super undervalued and I am expecting it to run to a billion $ market value in a year. Loading up every dip. This will be the easiest money I will be making in my trading career.
Both RSI and 6.60 resistance caused a pullback. Load up for the next run. 6.60 will eventually be broken and we will start trading at 7's.
"I bought shares this morning. If I understand right, I'll be entitled to take part in the offering, same as anyone holding at the EOD today."
The pullback is all technical. We have hit descending channel (built since mid-2020) resistance at $8.97. Just buy the dips and we will test $9 again this week and highly likely break it.
Where’s all the bashers today???
As we near the end of the subscription rights offering expect the sell pressure to gradually diminish. I am expecting APRN to move to 13-15 band right after the offering is complete.
"Hey guy! I own a small position in the apron from $5.40, just 900 shares. I am confused and unfamiliar with the rights offering and what it entails for my position. Fidelity updated that in my acct last night and I frankly don’t know what it all means, as this is the first time any of my stocks do this. Can someone explain what happens to my current shares and what the whole situation is about? Again, this wasn’t an investment I kept track of, because of the small ordinal investment so no idea."
Blue Apron hiring. Things changing drastically with BOD move and I am all in!!!https://twitter.com/blueapron/status/1447955359621124096
"Actually, on serious note, the fact that APRN closed above $9 is great. Hopefully all funding was done. I still have info on warrants in my account. Anyone has any info? The offer is supposed to close this week."
"This will undoubtedly go bankrupt. Meal kits were a fad, and even if they aren't, there are way too many meal kit companies for any individual to survive through elevated customer acquisition costs and lower lifetime values. I don't even know how much this market has already consolidated over the years but it's not enough."
"It seems like there’s a natural price ceiling around $9 while the rights offering is taking place. That is, the stock price exceeds $9, any potential buyer should just participate in the rights offering which gives you, 1 share plus 1.4 warrants for $10. I think savvy investors can print money by selling otm calls during this period."
Come to PAPA!! $10 not far off.
"The best part about the announcement is that Salzberg and his father are resigning from the board. I don't know what their management qualifications are, but their time with this company has seen the price do nothing but drop drop drop. Good luck to their replacements"
I believe APRN will trade at $10 base + cash soon. Do your math.
A law firm of ill repute (check google reviews) claiming to be nationally ranked is out to help his short selling clients by engaging in its standard practice of filing fake claims of shareholder rights violation and breach of fiduciary duty only to get the stock price down. Folks invested in APRN with long term view should ignore this kind of sideshows.
Surprised to see no recent posts on this--stock is up 17% as of 2:30. Of course this board used to be all bashers so I guess they've gone but I was still hoping someone had some insight into why this stock has been so strong recently.
Paper hands are selling. Stay strong. We will see 10 ! #APRN #WTRH
Dave where are art thou?
anyone subscribe to the rights? or pass
"Another point about the offering - Although it is dilution, because the warrants in the offering are 7 years out @ $15, $18, and $20, people who buy the shares are in it to hold their shares until the price is over $15, $18, $20, or for the full time limit, 7 years, no matter how high the price/share.I'm long call options."
What is with this APRN. Why do they need so much money ?
So folks would you be holding stock going into earnings or waiting to buy after earning?
