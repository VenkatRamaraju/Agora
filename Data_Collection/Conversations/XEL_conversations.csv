Xel earnings misses by 1 cent at $1.01 a share. They narrowed earnings for 2019 to high end of range 2.60 to 2.65 and gave next years earnings range of 2.73 to 2.83.

"With higher temperatures than average we will see an income boost. Also, no major storms.should help insurers too!"
"We urgently need heroes from Reddit and Robinhood, if you look at analytics in Webull, the percentage of profitable shareholders is about zero!!!"
Getting wacked over last few days. Interest rates with wall street shorting?
"Added some shares today @63.1. Two different firms, GS and Barclays gave it a $76 price point."
"eased into a few shares here, a few more if it drops <58. It is below it's own 5yr. blended P/E avg., div just hiked, ex-div coming up, >3% yield... works for me.."
"My XEL shares now >double overall, first bought shares up 236% in eight years, NOT counting divs. Not too shabby %^). Best ute I've ever owned, for sure..."
Expected .97 earnings but .38 cent dividend. Need to up dividend!
Anyone had this from NRG? Trying to figure cost basis from 2001 .
Great stock steady increase in market price since2011
"Wind turbines kill millions of birds a year which is not very ""environmental"" in my book."
"Looking for an entry point, hoping one shows soon"
Finally bought. I have been waiting for a dip and figured $68.70 was a good entry point lol
"Looking at a few ute's historical charts, it appears valuations increase in relation to temperatures. General rise in the spring, continuing through summer and peaking in fall.History doesn't always repeat but the pattern seems pretty cyclical. I think there's a fair chance of a 10% - 20% runup over the next 6 to 9 months. I like to have some safe stocks like XEL and betting it will pay off throughout the year."
XEL= my best ute investment ever. Up >100% not counting divs.. not too shabby.
"i'm an old geezer. Don't be fooled by my screen name. i want utilities. When U get to be my age, dividends are your best friend."
Ruthlass mms
Good day to add today at $49 and change!
"From the commercials I’ve Sean, this looks like a turning point in the fuel industry!!! Could $60 shares be a deal?"
New all-time high. Gotta love that with a decent dividend. This stock has creeped up in my portfolio and has been a pleasant surprise. The increase offsets my higher Xcel energy bill.
Anyone own this stock
Utes waking up. Thumbs up or down if you are bullish for the next 6 months for utility sector. Rotational starting to look real.
Good add here at $64.25

What's a good entry point? $62?
"Would be great if Xcel bought Fcel or BE and really go green by re designing our obsolete, enefficent electric grid. They could build the system, give it to the cities in return collect royalties and service fees."
All I know is I bought this stock around $17 a share for my IRA a number of years ago. Enough said.
"Xcel Is energy diversity, proportioned well In all sectors/types of energy production and delivery. Incentivising It's customers through various energy Programs and of course Div's.@BenFowke"
"I've had XEL (DRiP and brokerage) for a lot of years, and of course have been happy with it, but I am tempted to sell in order to buy other dividend payers. XEL's PE ratio has gotten higher than I like, for an about average dividend yield. Also considering closing out BKH, but XEL seems more expensive. Definitely closing out YORW! Any special reasons for me to stay in XEL?"
bought XEL on this dip
This stock has had a huge run. It has to come back to norm right lol
"News report says that Xcel was named as one of the world's ""most admired companies"". That's great. The company's strategy is sound. Except I remember that one year Enron got an award like that too. Just proves the old saying that ""past performance is not a guarantee of future results"""
"should go up,?"
How will the Minneapolis decent into anarchy affect XEL? I can't imagine this will be good for any companies operating in MN. Thoughts?https://www.forbes.com/sites/tommybeer/2020/06/12/minneapolis-city-council-unanimously-votes-to-replace-police-with-community-led-model/#5a4d224871a5
GWB The stock is plummeting while the stock markets are soaring and everything written about XEL is favorable. Can anyone explain that?
Debt was always a concern of utility stocks as building power plants was tremendously expensive and they had to carry a lot of debt. Xcel doesn't build them anymore so interest rate sensitivity may not hurt them. They also let others add solar to their system so they act as a middle man and profit from it. This stock will bottom at $54 and then start moving again.
"Great company! just keeps going like the energizer bunny. I've held it in a drip account for many, many years. sold shares to buy real property twice which brought a good return but always kept adding direct purchases."
"In my humble opinion, here's what's wrong.1: Maybe the average investor here is too young to remember that utility stock valuations are based on interest rates ?2: Utilities aren't growth stocks. 3: Right now, utility stocks have PE's that were only applied to growth stocks in the past.4: The reason: With the federal reserve (& their equivalents around the world) moving towards zero interest rates over the past 10 years, the one alternative to the stock market, certificates of deposit CD's are no longer an option. Those investors who in the past chose CDs because they were FDIC insured, have had no choice but to put their money somewhere else to find yield. They chose the safety of utility companies like Xcel energy.So many people pouring money into utility stocks is what caused the valuations to get out of wack.FYI: If you believe the zero interest rate policy is the way to go, I suggest you look at a long-term chart of Japan's Nikkei average. On October 1, 1989 it closed just under 39k....... 32 years later, it's at 30k5: There's been raging inflation in medical & higher education costs for the past 25+ years.Now there's a huge bubble in homes/rent. Lumber is up 92.00% over the past year. This explains why there's been an absolutely insatiable demand for low income/affordable housing for the last 12+ years.6: At some point, the federal reserve will have to recognize this & hike interest rates substantially.The idea that the world needs zero interest rates for economies to survive, shows how fractured the world economies are. When I bought my first home on July 1, 1994, a 30 year fixed was at 9.25% & that wasn't considered outrageously high @ the time. Funny thing is, the Stock market, even with interest rates that high relative to today, did fine.7: As for Xcel, when a 30 year fixed was at 9.25% in 1994, it was probably sporting a PE ratio between 10 & 15. I don't wish for interest rates to go that high, but what if they 'only' went up to the historical average. Let's say 7.00% for a 30 year fixed, & money markets paying 5.00% What would Xcel Energy be trading for then ? If you disagree, & giving me a thumbs down makes you feel better, feel free to do so, but I'd prefer you act like an adult, reply, & tell me why/where you think I'm wrong."
I also bought this stock years ago.Thinking about buying more.Have been watching it patiently for many years.What's up with the dividends.Don't you think they should be higher.
