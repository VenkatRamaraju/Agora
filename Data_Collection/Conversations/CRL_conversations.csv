"Will Cognate produce DCvax for NWBO? It appears that CLR made a great choice purchasing Cognate, and I hope that Cognate will manufacture DCvax for NWBO. NWBO is on the verge of great success Nd many hope the DCvax will help brain cancer patients all over the world soon."
We are back above the 50 MDA. Looks like a test of highs will coming soon and hopefully past $500
Anyone aware of any news of substance that would account for the 6% decline today?
Added at $403
WTH is wrong here. Goes down on $3 on a 100 block sell lol
"I can't find anything, although TMO, ILMN are also down"
This thing is going crazy
The whole group is taking a beating. Can't find any news to account for it. Vaccine related?
"Will Charles River have any interest in Northwest Bio, NWBO since NWBO has interest in Cognate?The offer to purchase Cognate makes sense, and so does NWBO"
"CRL and NWBO, please consider the fact that NWBO is working with multiple manufacturing facilities who have manufacturing options in approximately 25 Countries. Do the math, and NWBO could reach a market cap of 25x to 100x in jest a few years, ending in 2023, IMO. A partnership between NWBO and CRL would provide a fundamental achievement based on the above statement.It is a fact that NWBO is on the right track and shall persevere as the press forward to help cure tens of thousands of cancer patients each year, all over the world. The real blessing comes to all cancer patients who will reap the benefits from NWBO, IMO.Have a great day!"
I can never find a good place to add to the shares I bought two years ago. This thing is a freight train! Finally broke down and bought 40 more at current levels. Not worked as I know this will break 1k in a year.
the real question is will this get pumped tomorrow? We've seen $TESLA fall when entering S&P but we've seen companies like $CRL rise 17%
"Now that CRL has completed its acquisition of Cognate, will Charles River have any interest in Northwest Bio, NWBO since NWBO has interest in Cognate? It appears that NWBO is close to producing it first article vaccine in the UK and the USA within the next month or so? Many people are excited for both CRL and NWBO and they are expecting great news soon from NWBO."

"Sure this stock is overpriced like most of the ""growth"" stocks but why the crash today?"
