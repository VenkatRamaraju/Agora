What is the status of Cognate now owned by CRL and the fact that Cognate has contractual deals with NWBO? NWBO will enable CRL to advance sales and produce multiple product vectors for CRL and NWBO.

"CRL and NWBO, please consider the fact that NWBO is working with multiple manufacturing facilities who have manufacturing options in approximately 25 Countries. Do the math, and NWBO could reach a market cap of 25x to 100x in jest a few years, ending in 2023, IMO. A partnership between NWBO and CRL would provide a fundamental achievement based on the above statement.It is a fact that NWBO is on the right track and shall persevere as the press forward to help cure tens of thousands of cancer patients each year, all over the world. The real blessing comes to all cancer patients who will reap the benefits from NWBO, IMO.Have a great day!"
