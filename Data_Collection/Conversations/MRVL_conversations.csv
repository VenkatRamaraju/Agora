CLASSIC DIP AFTER EARNINGS FOR BIG BOYS TO LOAD UP LOL...THIS IS GOING TO 65-75 SOON
NOK guiding up is positive for MRVL.
This train has pulled out of the station sorry for those who didn’t get there in time
Cant wait to add more shares the next dip
Id say MRVL is weathering this sell-off better than most... down around only 40 cnts not bad at all... We're gonna see 60 this month!
"Oppenheimer analyst Rick Schafer maintained a Buy rating on Marvell (NASDAQ:MRVL) on Wednesday, setting a price target of $60, which is approximately 22.85% above the present share price of $48.84.Schafer expects Marvell to post earnings per share (EPS) of -$0.03 for the first quarter of 2021."
"Cramer gives a price target of $50 for Marvell: Marvell's three main growth drivers in 5G, Cloud, and Auto:In 5G, Marvell now sees their overall opportunity as ""significantly larger"" than what they previously communicated. What has changed since its 2018 analyst day is a strengthened position at its second OEM; more Ethernet switch and PHY design wins with three customers; Marvell has started to address the radio head portion of 5G in a much more meaningful way; the growth trajectory for massive MIMO (multiple-input, multiple-output) is faster than what it previously expected; it is getting wins with more regionally focused Tier 2 players; and lastly, potential share shifts can work to Marvell's favor, with every 1% share shift favoring its four 5G RAN customers adding about $60 million a year of potential revenue. This means if restrictions against China's Huawei causes it to lose market share, Marvell wins. Previously, management laid out a path toward $750 million in annual 5G-related revenue post the Avera acquisition, and yesterday they confirmed the actual opportunity will be much larger than that.In Cloud, revenues from this industry recently reached about 10% of total company revenue, and management sees their total cloud opportunity to be on par with, if not greater than 5G. Daniel Christman, EVP of Storage Business Group, gave this reason why: ""Hyperscale cloud customers want optimization. They have already implemented their own AI accelerators, compute engines as well as even DPUs. Why? Because they have scale, they have unique workloads, and they have resources. Each of these trends will drive a massive expansion of SAM for Marvell in cloud data center."" Currently Marvell's business is split 50/50 between networking and storage, but management sees networking growing at a much faster pace. Management estimates the cloud networking SAM is growing to be greater than $4 billion by fiscal year 2024, and they are targeting 10% to 15% of that share.Automotive Ethernet was called the next >$1 billion market for the company. Marvell sees the dollar content per car growing from $5-$50 today to more than $100 as cars gain autonomous capabilities. Furthermore, Marvell currently has design wins with 24 OEMs, seven of which are in the top-10 car manufacturers in the world. But it's more than just Ethernet. Marvell called automotive ""the single biggest incremental opportunity for Marvell across the whole portfolio"" over the next five to 10 years when including compute, storage and security.As for management's long-term financial targets, the goal is to achieve 10% to 15% revenue CAGR driven by attractive end markets and share gains, gross margins of 63% to 65%, operating margins greater than 35%, and free cash flow greater than 30%. For comparison, at the 2018 analyst day management highlighted 6% to 8% revenue CAGR, gross margins greater than 66%, operating margin greater than 35%, and free cash flow of greater than 30%. So, the big update relates to the much stronger revenue growth outlook, while gross margins are slightly lower but operating margin and free cash flow are unchanged.We are increasing our price target to $50,"
"Who's the next target in the MRVL ""growth through acquisition"" story?"
Marvell is a Samsung 5G supplier and Samsung just got a huge $6.6 billion 5G Verizon deal. Fantastic!!https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-marvell-5g-infrastructure-products-innovation-new-generation/
Marvell is still looking cheap;Marvell price target raised to $60 from $50 at Barclays Marvell price target raised to $64 from $50 at Citi Marvell price target raised to $60 from $54 at SusquehannaMarvell price target raised to $60 from $50 at Piper SandlerMarvell price target raised to $60 from $50 at Deutsche BankMarvell price target raised to $60 from $50 at Credit SuisseIt will be interesting to see how many raises Marvell will get after earnings. Skyworks and Qorvo both received a ton of upgrades after earnings.
"I think I should sell mrvl before it reports. then buy it back, it usually drops, after it reports."
"they are about to talk about the acquisition on Tech Check, cnbc now at 11:10a"
"I understand that everyone wants the stock at $50 in two days, but that is not the path here. 5G is in the first inning, and Marvell is one of the top plays. The business will grow in excess of 30% year after year, and the multiple growth will surpass that. $150 in 5 years is very possible. Patience wins the race."
Marvell price target raised to $54 from $50 at Susquehanna Susquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland raised the firm's price target on Marvell to $54 from $50 and keeps a Positive rating on the shares. The analyst said improving read-throughs across Storage and Networking customers/OEMs point to a solid backdrop of demand. He notes super-seasonal expectations have set a high bar for guidance and the company is scheduled to release Q3 results on December 3rd.
MRVL target price for end of 2 years is $150 a share with so many growth catalyst.
get ready for the coming surge. buy now!
All time high
Market Manipulation at it's best- drive it down -buy it back- no regulation!!!
"Did everyone see the 15 min feature on CNBC at about 5pm today which they called the ""Marvelous Rally."". Couldn't ask for a better MRVL plug.. 3-4 analysts all commented that there's more upside to come on the cusp of earnings next week and that the target should be 34 or 35 and that the price has always been relatively low. They showed multiple graphs and consider this a break-out stock. The sentiment on MRVL could not be better, really. It really could turn into a momentum stock.. Not too late to load up."
"I think we, the share holders, should set a date to buy 100 shares each of the stock in a coordinated effort. Lets say Friday afternoon at 3:30 on the 12th, I'm in."
Where is Tom? That $47 guy?
"Oppenheimer raises Marvell price target to $70. Plus NVDA & AMAT earnings reports. AMAT's earnings call (one of the best I have ever heard in helping me learn even more about the semi landscape going forward). Semis slumped partly because of Morgan Stanley's bogus, bearish call on the semis earlier in the week. AMAT said all aspects of its business were humming. All... Micron is gonna roll today. Let's hope MRVL joins the party. Marvell shorts have gotta be some of the dimmest traders in the market."
Did anyone see the big plug for MRVL today at about 1 pm on CNBC... Please tell me I wasn't dreaming. Lol. Pete Najarian pounded the table for MRVL regarding 30 calls I believe.. They flashed it up on the screen. Anyone see that? I bought heavily this morning after I read about their new contracts with Samsung and Nokia.. The Marvell chip will be in new Samsung 5g phones.. Najarian also said he likes the stock cause it's cheap.
It appears to me MRVL is now in a position similar to AMD and NVDA and possibly closer to NVDA share price over the long run. The present growth ahead for MRVL I view is in folds which is why the companies margins will bring about NVDA's share price as it continues to evolve and scale forward.
good days ahead! Ive been here since fall 2017 and also the teens for marvell and this ride is just starting!!
"I remember when transistor silicon wafers were 1 inch in diameter, transistors were 10mm X 15 mm back in 1970 We've come a long way Baby. A long way yet to go, and this pony will give you a wild ride. Hang on. Maybe we can teach the Chinese a thing or two"
"MRVL 06:03 10/20/20 Marvell resumed with an Overweight at KeyBanc KeyBanc analyst John Vinh initiated coverage of Marvell Technology Group with an Overweight rating and $55 price target. ""Transformative"" acquisitions have positioned the company for long-term sustainable and profitable growth, Vinh tells investors in a research note. Marvell is one of the best-positioned companies to benefit from the inflection in 5G infrastructure deployments, says the analyst."
"Merrill Lynch Stick to Their Buy Rating for Marvell5 hours ago (Dec 04, 2020 01:25AM ET) Merrill Lynch analyst Vivek Arya reiterated a Buy rating on Marvell (NASDAQ:MRVL) on Thursday, setting a price target of $55, which is approximately 20.83% above the present share price of $45.52."
"ZACKS finally changed their ranking of MRVL (today I believe) to a BUY. After they so stubbornly had MRVL at a hold for the longest time and recently a sell, they have finally made a change.. Must be due to ER next week?"
"August is an endemic month for the market, many people away more so now than ever. With the free money the #$%$ in DC are giving away. My poor kids & grandkids. Sleepy joe and his cronies have no regard for future generations. How sad."
Was todays news priced into the Stock? Seems like pretty big news?
"Marvell Technology 3Q Net Revenue Meets EstimatesBy Bloomberg Automation(Bloomberg) -- Marvell Technology reported net revenue for the third quarter that met the average analyst estimate. 3Q net revenue $750.1 million, +13% y/y, estimate $751.0 million (range $750.0 million to $763.0 million) (Bloomberg Consensus) Sees 4Q adjusted EPS 25c to 33c 3Q adjusted EPS 25c vs. 17c y/y 3Q adjusted gross margin 63% vs. 63.5% y/y, estimate 63.0%"
Poised to rise based on chart
I see Tom is up to his expectations expectations
Why is this going red?
This is not a for short- term holders. I think MRVL will trade over $100 in the next 12 months. Nice confident Matt Murphy and a bullish forecast.
Marvell will have a blow out earnings report in Aug it will move it to the 70 + range go long
"Now that INPH deal is closed, I wonder if increasing the dividend is out of the question?Nice round number like $0.1/qtr? $0.2 would be welcome, but I'll accept $0.1 for now."
"After Marvell Technology (MRVL) announced that the State Administration for Market Regulation of the People's Republic of China has approved the company's previously announced proposed acquisition of Inphi (IPHI), Stifel analyst Tore Svanberg said he is not updating his estimates yet, pending the acquisition close, but he views the announcement as ""highly favorable"" for Marvell. Svanberg reiterates his Buy rating and $62 price target on Marvell shares."
"a chip shortage, and this beats earnings and it goes done.....pure manipulation for a better entry pointthis sees $75-90 in 4 months"

I belive he omitted a digit
Keep the positive thoughts
Marvell is becoming a tech juggernaut. Matt Murphy is brilliant.
ATH Congrats MRVL longs. Back up the . Cha Ching Ching!!!!
did everyone see the plug that Cramer gave to marvel just now at about 9:24 a.m.? talking about the diversity and the greater performance than previous quarter etc we're probably going to hit $60 at some point today.. at 11:00 a.m. CEO Murphy is going to be on a special tech presentation on cnbc. it's going to be a great day. buy now!
"Not worried about price action today. Way too complicated to figure out the direction from a listing! I once owned NVDA shares at $38 and sold in $50's. Had lots of them.....what a big dummy I was! MRVL is my second chance to redeem myself. I WON""T make the same mistake twice and sell early. Marvell has a hand in a diverse portfolio of chips, including networking equipment and mass storage devices for data centers, 5G and communications infrastructure, and intra-network chips for the complex systems built into most cars these days. Marvell also makes custom designs to handle customer-specific tasks involving AI, as well as infrastructure processors (DPU chips like NVIDIA will be selling). The difference at this point is MRVL has tons of upside where NVDA growth is limited by its size. Hang in for the 3-4 year ride."
(Reuters) - Marvell Technology Group Ltd said on Monday its chips will be included in a project from Facebook Inc designed to make it easier and cheaper to deploy 5G networking equipment.
Pretty sure Cramer knows something. He usually doesn't go that far out on a limb with his recommendations unless he's got something. 24 would be a good entry point if you haven't bought in. I'd hold if I own. I think we're consolidating bottom today.
"mrvl always scares me when it goes up before it reports. it seems like it always goes up before it reports and then drops. so I'm thinking, should I sell it. before reports or should I keep it."
Wow this is some good price action recently lets go marvell!! investing since fall 2017!
This stock could easily be $100. The company makes money and is on the forefront of new technologies. Their design patents are valuable and ground breaking much more so in prior years. It's a great thing to get in at $26.. Could easily end up at $100 or higher.
I can't believe I bought the shares a year ago April at 24 no it's a 31 billion dollar company
ANYBODY WAITHING FOR $52.00??????????????????????????????????? LOLCould hit $72.00 in the next couple months! MUCH more likely!
Up again today?
"Jefferies maintains a Buy rating and raises Marvell's (NASDAQ:MRVL) price target from $47 to $53, saying the company has ""unique visibility into 2021 with multiple design wins ramping across networking and storage"" and a 5G tailwind."
Marvell sold their wifi busness to NXP for 1.74 billion and should impact the up and coming quarter and eliminate all debt. CEO on mad money promise to return cash to shareholders thru dividend and stock repurchase. Second half of year 2020 per CEO is the beginning innings of a multi year ramp in revenues. Should be interesting!
Nice beat!. Guidance is good. GAAP Gross margin for next qtr is pretty good.They're quite bullish on the 4th qtr.
wait for pullback before buying some stock.
"Susquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland reiterated a Buy rating on Marvell today and set a price target of $62.00. The company’s shares closed last Monday at $46.51.The word on The Street in general, suggests a Strong Buy analyst consensus rating for Marvell with a $55.39 average price target, implying a 18.2% upside from current levels. In a report issued on March 24, Stifel Nicolaus also reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a $62.00 price target."
"Getting a drag down because of Micron Technology this morning, which is not even in the same line of business but then MRVL is labelled as a “semiconductor” stock. Some of these traders are literally clueless about the stocks they’re trading."
marvel's np5 processor is 25% faster and uses 40% less power .this will be major for future of 5g growth!
Very slow moving stock.. Have not seen this stock spiking 15%-20% in a day..
"IPHI investor here. I’ve been long Inphi for several years and love this company and it’s well positioned, market leading portfolio of products. Thinking about letting my investment roll with the Marvell acquisition as after the $66 I receive in cash, I still receive 2.32 shares of Marvell for every share of Inphi I own. What is your confidence level in Marvell’s management team? How do you feel about their ability to run this company and have they done a good job executing on their plan? I love CEO’s that don’t over promise but have a track record of over delivering. That’s one of the main reason I invested in IPHI. Wanted to hear from MRVL investors here to see if you feel the same way about this company before this acquisition was made. Thanks!"
nice beat!
"Multiple recommendations as the eventual leader in 5G network installations. Of course, Cramer has this in his charitable trust portfolio as do other analysts. One can try to trade this puppy, but the day will come unannounced when it just keeps moving higher and higher. Find it very difficult to predict price movements; thus, I will just sit in it and own it, not trade it. It could be one of those stocks that generates a tenfold return over a couple of years. In fact, that is exactly what I am expecting."
"This is running with 3 more weeks until Dec 1st, projected earning date. The earnings will be able to yield us a nice Christmas bonus, I am sure. 5G + Cloud + Car AI? Come on. All three are sizzling sectors."
"MSBofA Securities analyst Vivek Arya raised the price target on Marvell (NASDAQ: MRVL) to $74.00 (from $62.00) after hosting CEO, Mat Murphy, & CFO, Jean Hu. for an investor meeting and leaving with the impression that results will be ""stronger for longer"" than investors expect.The analyst reiterated a Buy rating, stating ""mgmt’s bullish tone, excitement, execution discipline and confidence in multi-year engagements across cloud, 5G, storage, high-speed optics, and enterprise. While n-t upside dictated by supply, we expect MRVL will work with its supply-chain to deliver accelerating growth in 2HCY21 (we est. 20% YoY in 2H vs 17% in 1H) driven by US 5G ramp with Nokia/Samsung (importantly 5G peak still 4-5 years out with full Nokia content not kicking in until 2023/24) and improving enterprise (growing double digits even in sluggish market but can accelerate into 2022 as market improves). L-t, we see MRVL uniquely positioned as a top 3 computing/comms leader (along with NVDA/AMD), that has strategically improved its product portfolio/end market focus over the last 5 yrs to deliver sustainable 15-20% sales, 30% pf-EPS CAGR and path to $3 in EPS Power exiting CY23E. We raise our PO to $74 from $62 on 32x CY23E PE (rolled forward from 34x CY22E PE) on improved confidence in maintaining the ~30% EPS growth trajectory."""
2 days left to hit $60.00! If not next week!!!
Who is next on MRVL's acquisition list?
"kudos to all mrvl longs. check out simo, a leading controller maker, if you like that business. simo just guided to 70% organic revenue growth in 2021 with massive book-to-bill numbers. unlike mrvl, simo is dirt cheap at 9x's 2022 earnings, next year simo should grow 30%+ in sales in nand controllers. its only 1 piece of mrvl tam, but its a solid logic biz with secular growth. if market doesnt pay for simo, mrvl should take out the entire company at $100. it would then dominate global merchant controller biz and be hugely accretive. any insider form mrvl should send this post to mrvl mgt."
"This happened to NVDA...And, it happened to AMD..."
anyone else thinking this time it could be different for MRVL post-ER?
"Is Marvel Technology in the right place at the right time, in the history of innovation to grow to the level of NVDA valuation?Near the very beginning of the 5G, Datacenter, AI, Cloud, and EVs, and the momentum surrounding these technologies at what price Marvel Technology end 2021 will be somewhat of a response to my earlier question whether Marvel Technology follows in NVDA success to grow and bring about a very substantial multiple to where the shares trade today.The time is now for Marvel Technology to begin to answer the question in the near term for long term and a much higher share price due to growth and guidance will clearly be the response to my question."
70 by EOY grab your calls ya shares wide yo wife the mrvl man is coming
"MRVL will be all time high, close to $50 on Monday. There are 20+ etfs and mutual funds need to buy this one. Hope the momentum continues ."
"How come mrvl down on a boom day? I bought this stock because the Oxford Club recommended it in the ""10 Baggers of Tomorrow"" portfolio."
should be heading north from here in anticipation of Dec 7 earnings report..
this stock is a great investment. bought in at $24 sold my and took my principal out at $51. traders gain and lose money while investors get wealthy. playing with the house's money is sweet.
Did not listen to conference call recently. Anyone hear any updates on all the auto deals Marvell has made over the years ?
Hey Tom (aka Zytiga) is this at $32 yet?
Congrats everyone that holding on MRVL
Got 2 option contracts with a call at $35 expiring 9/18 . Hoping for a quick profit after earnings
"Market price doesn’t go in a straight line, it goes generally in a zigzag pattern. So we have people selling out for profits and now this stock is relatively oversold. Don’t wait for 3 or more days to get back in to the unpredictable up trend."
"Marvell Technology, Inc. Reports Second Quarter Of Fiscal Year 2022 Financial Results- Q2 Net Revenue: $1.076 billion, grew by 48% year-on-year- Q2 Gross Margin: 34.6% GAAP gross margin; 64.8% non-GAAP gross margin- Q2 Diluted income (loss) per share: $(0.34) GAAP diluted loss per share; $0.34 non-GAAP diluted income per share- Cash and cash equivalents: $560 million"
"interestingly, MRVL is performing better than it's peer companies yesterday and today."
"I rarely double down on stocks I buy, but Marvell looks really good on paper. The PE is low for tech, the debt ratio is good, and the earnings ramp is a dream. If it drops tomorrow, I might just have to pick up some more."
I've done some calculating on individual stock returns from my portfolio and wanted to share these interesting results. One year returns as follows:SPY:. 36%QQQ:. 42%FB:. 60%MU:. 67%MRVL:. 70%And Marvell is just getting warmed up..
"Per Jim Cramer tonight, ""With Marvell's long-term growth story still very much in intact, we continue to view weakness as an opportunity to buy shares."" BooYaah!!!!!"
"Typical mrvl, up after good earning, then a small decline and up again after good earnings."
Oppenheimer raised Marvell Technologies’ price target to $40 (19.5% upside potential) from $35 and reiterated a Buy rating on the stock ahead of the integrated circuit maker’s 2Q results on Aug. 27.Oppenheimer analyst Rick Schafer wrote in a note to investors that Marvell Technologies (MRVL) remains his “top 5G RAN play.” Schafer sees upside setup driven by 5G and DC/Cloud.
Question to everyone:. I am long this stock with a very sizable stake. And I will probably remain long. Does everyone think that we will cross the $40 threshold this week or will short term traders win the day to see this stock pull back? Please cast your vote..
selloff- no answers here!
Just remember Cramer and Zacks have only a 50% stock picker success rate. Google it
Everything is marching forward today but the timing of earnings coming out is going to push this bad boy into the 70s￼
"Looking good for tomorrow,,,,,Stifel analyst Tore Svanberg raised the price target on Marvell (NASDAQ: MRVL) to $52.00 (from $50.00) on the expectations for a meet or beat quarter. Predictions for the quarter include F3Q21 results in line or potentially slightly above the $750.0mn guidance at the midpoint on continued 5G momentum. The company's 5G China exposure is centered on ZTE with minimal Huawei exposure, coupled with custom NVMe SSD product ramp in a next-gen gaming platform.The analyst reiterated a Buy rating, stating ""Could potentially guide F4Q21 (Jan) revenue above our $772.5mn (+3.0% q/q) est., on 5G strength, which we highlight is increasingly diversified (Samsung primarily; + Nokia, Ericsson & ZTE). With Samsung poised to be a key share gainer on potential transitions away from Huawei, Marvell could benefit disproportionally given materially higher $ content at Samsung. With DC now at 10%+ of sales, the pending IPHI acquisition could further expand its data infrastructure footprint and mindshare at Tier 1 hyperscalers, while directly leveraging its 5nm process investment/manufacturing relationships."""
Murphy is extremely bullish on the call!
Tonight on CNBC’s Fast Money.. The MM’s/ traders all overwhelmingly endorsed MRVL as a buy.. Mrvl was presented during the fast pitch segment where they vote to see if it’s a hot stock. Everybody said yes.. Good press and high praise indeed! This is the next NVIDA..
"it will drop after earnings, then buy"
"MRVL's year over year sales growth rate is high 'teens. MRVL has $560m cash and $6b debt, of which $1b is short term debt. MRVL has a forward PE of 40x-50x. Meanwhile SIMO's year over year growth rate is 70%+. SIMO has $412m cash, not debt, and and generates tons of cash each quarter. SIMO's forward PE is about 10x. MRVL used to compete head to head with SIMO in client device controllers, until MRVL exited that business line because SIMO was kicking MRVL's tail, and MRVL couldn't make any money in client device controllers. So why doesn't MRVL buy SIMO for 25x SIMO's forecast 2022 EPS, and it's accretive to MRVL's EPS and sales per share, and the acquisition would generate tons of cash for MRVL, and the product line (client device NAND flash controllers) fits perfectly into MRVL's storage segment (MRVL exited the client space, but still makes enterprise device flash controllers)."
In the words of Jackie Gleason how sweet it is
"MRVL customers have exceeded expectations this qtr, cash flow and revenue will exceed expectations and outlook will be robust. Management will not want any hiccups in guidance with pending merger. Stock has been on a slow steady climb but look for a breakout next week. NVDA and MRVL are the two leaders in this industry and MRVL is trading at a much better valuation. It is going to be a good two weeks for MRVL shareholders"
"I see a conflicting piece of data from the Zacks report this morning, unless I am misinterpreting something? If someone could shine a light on this, I would appreciate it: They cite the forward PE ratio for MRVL vis-à-vis the industry average to be 45.78 vs 34.22. This may implicate a stretched valuation for MRVL. On the other hand, the cite the PEG ratio (which is the PE ratio factoring in future growth), and MRVL's PEG sits at 2.14 vs 8.57 of the industry average. My interpretation is that MRVL, forward looking, looks to be about 4 times cheaper than the average stock in its universe. So how can this be? Why would Zacks care about the PE ratio and rate MRVL at ""Hold"", and not the PEG ratio when they should rate MRVL at ""Strong Buy""??? Is PEG not ""forward looking"" PE is anyway? See below and judge for yourself. Your comments are welcome.Marvell Technology (MRVL) Gains But Lags Market: What You Should Know4:50 pm ET October 7, 2020 (Zacks):In the latest trading session, Marvell Technology (MRVL) closed at $42.62, marking a +1.28% move from the previous day. This change lagged the S&P 500's 1.74% gain on the day. At the same time, the Dow added 1.91%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 1.88%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the chipmaker had gained 12.06% over the past month. This has outpaced the Computer and Technology sector's loss of 1.67% and the S&P 500's loss of 1.86% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from MRVL as it approaches its next earnings report date. The company is expected to report EPS of $0.25, up 47.06% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $750.23 million, up 13.25% from the year-ago period.MRVL's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $0.92 per share and revenue of $2.96 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +39.39% and +9.5%, respectively...MRVL currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).Valuation is also important, so investors should note that MRVL has a Forward P/E ratio of 45.78 right now. This valuation marks a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 34.22.Also, we should mention that MRVL has a PEG ratio of 2.14. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The Semiconductor - Communications industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 8.57 as of yesterday's close."
I’m gonna sell my Chinese junk stock and buy more MRVL.￼￼
Congrats ATH!!!
What is MRVL going to do next with their crazy highly valued stock? Who is going to get acquired?
When this stock hits $110 in the next 9to 12 months come talk to to me.This. Stock is going to be a blockbuster.
"Find it odd that SHort interest grew from mid-July to end of July by some ~1.5m.Yet the stock appreciated.Good news for us as any covering will support MRVL. Not a massive percentage of float, mind you."
I think we're done with the 50s.. And I once said the same about the 40s so I'm not bad karma!
Big takeaways.. Alpha says new price target of $89 and the train hasn't left the station yet.. Great article..https://seekingalpha.com/article/4437502-marvell-its-not-too-late
how is this going to fair with earnings?
https://youtu.be/0C3-F5FoXps
looks like MRVL will be buying innovium adding more chip and cloud power matt murphy is one smart guy this buy out will make MARVEL a stronger company should be in the triple digits by first earnings of 2022 I think we have winner
Nice earning beat and forward guidance. CC will clarify moreI'm loading up tomorrow. Ignore the noise AH. This will open green tomorrow.
"Dang! I’ve been riding this ride since MRVL hit $15., got scared of the Covid drop and sold all 500 shares at $25., then bought 1000 at $22.50. I may ride with it to $100. or more. BEST STOCK TIP I’ve ever gotten!!!"

"It’s very simple, Marvell’s products are selling like hot cakes and can’t meet the demands. This scenario is better that the other way around. Why punish the stock for that, doesn’t make sense at all. Market should be happy it’s making money. “Miss” here doesn’t equate to bad results. As far as I know, Marvell is still on target to increase range of profitability."
MRVL's earnings are a very big deal in my view if the business that was already to occur has now been accelerated by several months of demand. If their numbers meet or exceed and the guidance is in line with the acceleration of growth in demand a several points pop in after-hours could confirm the company is well on it ways to newer elevated target share prices to come. Marvell Technology Group Ltd. appears to be in a position to deliver positive returns as soon as today.
"April 17, 2019 11:07 ET (15:07 GMT)Marvell Technology Price Target Raised to $28.00/Share From $22.00 by Citigroup"

"MRVL is probably and hopefully on the launch pad now.. ER is one week from this Thursday, 12/3. The consensus is higher earnings again over the last quarter.. What we need is to beat the street or even better would be a surprise.. I think 50 is going to happen but I just want to stay there and not see a sell-off and profit taking.. We really need a strong ER."
My excitement at the 2.9% rise in PM has been tempered by the fact its only due to 66 shares traded.
"ABSOLUTELY A GREAT COMPANY ! I'm going to buy more shares. This is an investment for the future. 5G, automotive, ethernet, storage, connectivity and computing. We'll see $50 to $100 in a year, at least !"
"Things Cramer said on his Action Alerts website tonite "" Marvell's long-term growth story still very much in intact ---- Marvell will cement itself as a semiconductor powerhouse through the acquisition of Inphi. ----- The company continues to win customers and ramp new products. We remind you that shares fell after hours in response to the previous quarter, but quickly bounced back the next day. """
A good quarter ER from NVDA has lifted all Semis.
This is the best stocks I ever owned!
"Semi is under pressure, both SOXX and SMH show sign of short term reversal. Exit MRVL short term position today, it has a big runup recently after the earning. Will add to positions again, like the company long term. Semi equipment companies hit especially hard today in general north of -3%. Good luck longs."
"The new products sound very interesting. A long call option on growth liked that statement. Speaking about EV growth, security and overall market growth. Oems are appreciating the high quality of Marvell. That October sounds very interesting with Investors Day."
Getting a beating this week. Down 0ver $3 ticks for the week. Yuck!But I still Love em’
I think the TXN hickup is gone and we'll see 60 tomorrow.
MRVL will track up or down tomorrow keeping pace with the market. Right now NASDAQ futures are down.
Great long term stock. Semiconductor shortage makes it a risky short term option. I’d imagine it’s well over 200 in a couple years.
Bears are running
for the longs!
dividend thank you.
I think this will recover by the end of next week
i own it..but like all tech stocks it will fall even though it will smash earnings..then i will add below 56
There are many obscure mutual funds holding this stock. Does that make anyone else nervous?
"This all allows me to wait an extra year before I start collecting my Social Security, thanks Marvell!"

What just happened?
Have way too much but just bought more!
This should be a 100 billion dollar company in 2 years
Hopefully this down day is because the rsi and mfi were at 73 and 79 this morning. mrvl is overbought after this nice run. Once the 2 come down a bit it should bounce back.
"5G play, good looking earnings ramp, recent flat stock price, reasonable P/E. Looks like a good entry point. I'm in."
Does anyone know why all the Semis are down today with the market being up?
The biggest profits in MRVL will go to those who can stay on the train.. Good luck tomorrow.
"If earnings are favorable when reporting, upgrades to $70 and $75 pps will likely be forthcoming."
Should I take profits I’m up about 25%
Who missed this train?
"Beating on the futureWe expect year-over-year revenue growth will accelerate in the third quarter, led by substantial contributions from the cloud data center market,"" Murphy said. ""In addition, we expect our 5G business to continue to grow with strong sequential revenue growth in the third quarter, and a significant step up projected in the fourth quarter.""Expectations were too high headed into Marvell's second-quarter report, Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Christopher Roland said in a note to clients. Like other fabless chipmakers, Marvell is facing supply constraints with its contract manufacturers, he said.""The long-term story remains very much intact, although we note an exceptionally high sentiment bar this quarter,"" Rolland said. He reiterated his positive rating on MRVL stock with a price target of 72."
"Matt Murphy and his team are doing wonders. Marvell is going to be a huge juggernaut. Nice numbers today, nice guidance. Patiently waiting for $250+."
"SUrprised no one has posted the analyst updatesNeedham buy (PT from 55 to 67.50)Deutsche and Credit Suisse both Buy (PT from 60 to 70)Stifel Buy (PT from 65 to 68)UBS Buy (PT from 60 to 68)Oppenheimer Outperform ((PT $60)Rosenblatt Buy (PT is $70)Needham commentaryThe analyst commented, ""Yesterday, Marvell announced it will acquire privately-held Innovium, an emerging leader in high-end DC Ethernet switches. As Marvell had a glaring hole in its Ethernet switch product portfolio addressing the high-end DC switching segment dominated by Broadcom's Tomahawk family of switches, we believe Innovium is a natural and strategic acquisition for Marvell and rounds out the company's Ethernet switch portfolio. We believe there will be significant synergies combining Innovium's Ethernet switches with Inphi's PAM4 solutions. Importantly, Marvell does not anticipate this strategic acquisition, which is expected to close by year-end, to be dilutive to earnings. Further, we are introducing our CY23 model for MRVL, which excludes the Innovium deal, and raising our PT to $67.50, based on 30x our CY23 EPS estimate of $2.25UBS commentaryThe analyst comments ""Together w/the recent Inphi acquisition, Innovium fills a major gap (high-speed ethernet switching) in MRVL's cloud portfolio. Given the crush of data traffic in the cloud, these customers in particular are looking for a viable second source to AVGO's Tomahawk portfolio, and Innovium is the only other supplier currently shipping a 12.8Tbps switch architecture (Teralynx) for cloud. MRVL does have a 12.8Tbps architecture (Prestera), but it targets the enterprise/carrier market, which generally prioritizes feature-rich solutions as opposed to cloud customers that want very low latency, low power and high port count. For this reason, these are typically very distinct roadmaps and design teams and even AVGO serves these markets with two totally separate products (Trident and Tomahawk). Innovium will accelerate MRVL's efforts to build a cloud team and comes with a major customer having already adopted Innovium's platform. Given the deal size and valuation, this is a little different than other MRVL deals in that it is more of a tuck-in w/potentially significant longer-term strategic value as the cloud segment has rapidly become MRVL's largest and fastest growing segment. Separately, MRVL also announced preliminary FQ2:22 (Jul) revenue of $1.065B +/- 1.5% or spot in-line w/its guidance. While many semis companies are reporting upside, the in-line results are we think reflective of ongoing supply constraints that have proven to be more acute for infrastructure businesses, which obfuscates the fact that demand is far higher than what MRVL is currently able to supply (similar story to AVGO w/its >52wk lead times)."""
"In a report released today, Rick Schafer from Oppenheimer maintained a Buy rating on Marvell (MRVL – Research Report), with a price target of $60.00. The company’s shares closed last Thursday at $45.25.The word on The Street in general, suggests a Strong Buy analyst consensus rating for Marvell with a $54.94 average price target, a 15.0% upside from current levels. In a report released yesterday, KeyBanc also reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a $55.00 price target.Based on Marvell’s latest earnings release for the quarter ending January 31, the company reported a quarterly revenue of $798 million and net profit of $16.54 million. In comparison, last year the company earned revenue of $718 million and had a net profit of $1.77 billion.Based on the recent corporate insider activity of 103 insiders, corporate insider sentiment is positive on the stock. This means that over the past quarter there has been an increase of insiders buying their shares of MRVL in relation to earlier this year."

looking for a rebound later in the day! would be nice!!!
"I think they had a very good earnings call. I suspect many analysts will maintain or increase price target. Tomorrow is options expiration so I am not expecting much upside as holders unwind. I think once investors digest the Q2 results, they’ll realize the growth story remains intact despite the enterprise softness (I expected given most workers are remote VS in their offices). Growth in cloud sales coupled with ramping of new tech and design wins are offsetting this softness. I am staying long, as iPhone migration to 5G will drive 5G infrastructure roll out."
$100. Soon.
Up over a dollar on a day like this?Volume ok too.Funds?
What is the P/E ratio? Nevermind.
new tail winds coming real soon with 8/26 ER.. look for a new surge.
Nice volume today.

what time ER is ?
getting ready for a new surge
might take a bit of a hit on TXN earnings but if it does buy it
"On Thursday, analysts at Citigroup moved MRVL up to a ""Top Pick"" within their Semiconductor Equipment & Specialty Semis coverage list. MRVL is heavily predicated on Marvell's integral role in the 5G cycle. As noted in our initiation alert, we believe that the 5G upgrade cycle remains in early stages and that from an infrastructure viewpoint, which Marvell plays to by creating the network that needs to be built and running to support all of the new, Marvell will benefit as 5G enabled devices begin coming to market over the next several years. Additionally, we believe the Cavium deal was a big step in the company's transformation while the acquisition of Aquantia, a leader in Multi-Gig Ethernet connectivity, will help in broadening Marvell's connectivity solutions portfolio and capitalizing on the future of high-speed networking requirements in cars that are needed to enable autonomous, electric, and safety/security applications. Furthermore, on the M&A front, we believe the acquisition Avera Semiconductor, a developer of custom ASICs for networking and telecom equipment was a 5G additive play as Avera's biggest end market exposure is base stations, which are leveraged to 5G."
"Jim Cramer from Mad Money has Marvell, Qorvo and Skyworks in his 5G top 3. So far they are all doing great. 5G is going to be absolutely massive. $MRVL $QRVO $SWKS"
Earnings are on August 26
2k plus shares at 54 - this is going to 100 by the end of the year
New highs this week?
Buying before earnings is just a gamble :(
Don't you just love a company that makes good money and the price drops every quarter? but I will buy it back for next quarter
MRVL reports earnings today got a feeling its going to blow past what wall street is prediction it might pull back 1 or 2 % shorts & day traders then to 70 +
"Alexander Green of Oxford Communique is advising his readers to use this dip on MRVL to add to their long positions. Expect double digit growth in sales and earnings this year. My boat is fully loaded as i advised this board of same recently. glta long term holders, when 5g ramps up, we will be rewarded!"
The usual negative short sellers having their moment for a few days LOL
Can’t wait to snag this one for $52 after earnings!
Huge breakout right about now!
TOLD YOU..LOL
"the market for MRVL hasn't yet caught hold of the fact that ER is just a few weeks away . When it does and knowing the ER is likely to please, we're going going to see some heavy buying.. look for another surge real soon."

"Big data isn't going anywhereIt's been more than a decade of rapid cloud computing development, and now the advent of 5G mobile networks is accelerating the growth of digital data during the pandemic. And in the decade ahead, other technologies that create and require the use of even more information will develop -- including AI, network connected industrial equipment, and advanced driver assist and autonomous vehicle technology.Marvell has a hand in all of the above. The company has a diverse portfolio of chips, including networking equipment and mass storage devices for data centers, 5G and communications infrastructure, and intra-network chips for the complex systems built into most cars these days. Marvell also makes custom designs to handle customer-specific tasks involving AI, as well as infrastructure processors like the above-mentioned DPU chips NVIDIA will begin selling. This portfolio makes Marvell an ideal partner for enterprises looking to upgrade their operating systems for the modern era. Unlike graphics processors (GPUs) designed to accelerate the computation of lots of data with a single set of instructions, DPUs are similar to a CPU (like the chip that handles basic tasks in your PC or laptop) in that they can handle multiple tasks at once -- but are more specialized than a CPU as they can efficiently move very large packets of data.In a world where complex systems need to move information around very quickly (like in 5G network infrastructure, a data center, or an autonomous vehicle), I think Marvell's DPUs and related hardware will be in high demand. A relative value on a solid chip portfolioMarvell made a couple of acquisitions to build out its suite of data management and processing gear, including the takeover of data processing chip outfit Cavium in 2018 and 5G hardware company Avera Semiconductor in 2019. According to Marvell, its resulting lineup of products and supporting software has a total serviceable market of some $16 billion in annual spending, and it expects that market to grow at a 9%-a-year pace through 2023. With revenue of just $2.8 billion over the last trailing 12 months, that leaves plenty of room for Marvell to muscle its way further into the market.Even after going shopping, the balance sheet remains in good shape too, with total debt of $1.44 billion and cash and equivalents of $832 million. And as it laps acquisition costs, free cash flow (operating cash flow minus capital expenditures) is also rebounding -- running at positive $420 million over the last 12 months (good for free cash flow margin of 15%), even though some of its key customers in the auto and industrial sectors have been deeply affected by the pandemic.Marvell is showing signs of accelerating, though. Revenue grew 8% during the first half of the year, but management forecast a 13% year-over-year increase for Q3. Shares trade for nearly 70 times trailing 12-month free cash flow, a seemingly steep premium that accounts for the purchase of Avera and other pandemic-related disruption. But Marvell stock trades at a steep discount to high-flying NVIDIA using the price-to-sales and price-to-book value metrics."
Awesome
"This one has a mind of it's own. MRVL has treated me nicely since the mid-20's, on and off a few times with call options. so not surprised when it goes down after a runup into earnings. Done it before - so woulda/coulda/shoulda dumped before closing. My nov calls were up a $1+ each but quickly retracted to just now getting out and breaking even. The behavior says it could continue to fall to $58 range where I hope to jump back in. Seems like a great company with decent leadership. Wish the stock behaved more like Nividia though. LOL. Good luck all longs."
So….we’re hosed yet again..?
"MRVL upgrade [MT newswires @ 0807 eastern] ~ BMO Capital upgrades Marvell Technology to ""Outperform"" ~ Target goes from $45 to $50."
BUY THE DIP BABY! WE RIPPING
https://www.innovium.com/why-innovium/
remember that other john waiting for 55? what a short eh hes eating it now lol
"I'm sure I'll get slammed for this comparison, but ASML reported EUR4bn revs in the qtr gone.Their market cap is 281bn. Their SP is 700USD. Their EPS was 2.52EurMRVL is due to report 1bn, has a market cap of 44bn, and their SP is just under 57. Their expected EPS is $0.31Admittedly, their revs are booked in Euros so will have a higher dollar value.By 2025, they are expected achieve eps north of $2.80 on revs of >$6bn.Is it unreasonable to think MRVL could trade ~$180 in 2025 if they hit their milestones?"
">>Bottom LineRosenblatt analyst Hans Mosesmann summed up the difference between the two companies, saying, “The reason that Marvell’s situation is so much stronger than larger peer Broadcom’s (leadtimes are extended but stabilizing) is because Broadcom is not a share gainer per se, they are a content gainer in sockets they have owned for many cycles.”“Marvell has embraced strategically the custom ASIC, ARM, and 5nm/3nm transition uniquely in the world, which gives the company a capability that may only be matched by Broadcom (if they had the extensive ARM capability/roadmap of Marvell),” Mosesmann added.Based on the upside potential over the next 12 months, MRVL seems to be a better Buy compared to AVGO.<"
"buy the dip as this is gonna rebound hard and make new ATH in a month from now, and run until next earnings 15th Oct calls gonna print "
Buy more!!! What an opportunity hahahahahh
Been holding a long call since February that expires in January 2022 $55 strike. On the fence if I should sell now or keep holding
all other semis went down much more sharply than MRVL did today.
"When I see the pps of nvda and avgo it just shows the potential of mrvl. With 5G, cloud and automotive in its infancy stages one can imagine what lies ahead for mrvl. Not to mention the brilliance of Matt Murphy. The future looks awful bright."
Like MRVL for the following reasons:1) 5G play2) Potential take over target3) Global semiconductors have supply issues so pricing erosion should be minimum if any4) Like the Inphi merger which expands its footprint in fast data interconnects. 5) Like the current management team
Any drop is good for a long term holder. It won’t be this low for too much longer now.
One more to addCowen analyst Karl Ackerman raised the price target on Marvell (NASDAQ: MRVL) to $55.00 (from $50.00) while maintaining a Market Perform rating.
In a all stock deal at today’s price of roughly $60 we’re looking at an additional 16m shares being added to the float.
MU reported last night. Posted decent numbers but the street doesn't seem impressed. Could be a drag on the whole semi sector today.
You guys keep after Come
SWKS raises divi by more than 10%.Any chance we can see a 10% rise?
Next stop 70.
With most analysts price targets at 60 to 60+ It’s time we at least move into the upper 50’s.
where is that short now other john who said no one is buying at 50 lol what a fool great advice there.
"When you look at Avgo chart its like clock work for years. Literally 40 dollars gains every year then a pause and major breakout and it started around 30 dollars. I see Mrvl doing this type of move with a 35 CAGR over next x amount of years. So 35, to 75 to 115 is very possible over the next few years. Who knows what happens as auto growth kicks in and its new business lines kick in. I think we see 75 this year."
Next stop $70 dollars.
"Any sideways movement or short-term pullback in semis will be long forgotten once the entire sector skyrockets Nx over the next 3-5 years. The greatest tech boom is ahead of us, not behind. Buy a basket of them and let it fund your retirement."
Inphi financials supported by Price Waterhouse this morning. Huge open $50 call position on MRVL for the Apr 16 expiration. I mean huge (over 40K contracts) ~ that represents 4M shares long.
"Pretty good volume today, looking at good support. Looking forward to guidance for 4th quarter. Target price $85."
Closing in on that ATH and a little divi today as a bonus! Congrats Longs!
so could u amagin negative news
Semis are all up today.. wonder why..
"Contrary to some folks who have a fifteen-minute attention span on the Marvell thread, the price action today is extremely bullish. Up over 4% on a down day for the chips on heavy volume. And for those who claim MRVL never responds well to its earnings report, you obviously have not been involved in the stock for any substantial amount of time. And just for the record, on-balance volume is positive on the 5-minute thru the dailies."
"MRVL is a earnings making machine! 71% earnings growth, 11% sales growth, 10% revenue growth. Not bad for a fabless semi company in a chip shortage. Great strategic partnerships with the big players and their major 5G footprint will really propel them going forward. One of my favorite 5G plays. I wouldn't worry about any short term correction. Is only temporary as the entire market corrects."

"Getting in today. The 20s will be for semis, what the 90s were to PCs, and the 00's to eComm. I'm grabbing no less than four companies from this sector. Even 2-3 years from now, these entry points will seem like bargains. Run free, young hearts. Run free."
This after hours dip is going to make a big U turn tomorrow afternoon and rocket right back up.. Possibly big buying opportunity tomorrow morning..
Multiple price target increases today:Barclays to $42Oppenheimer to $45JP Morgan: $40B Riley: $42Rosenblatt: $50
Another ATH close today!?!
>>Marvell files for $1.23 bln mixed securities shelf offering<< Is this related to the Innovium purchase or are they just trying to raise some cash?I hope the former. I'm not a fan of dilution.
"Nice beat will be green tommorow Lot of up side, long Marvell"
Very nice. A strong performance today with a solid close over $60. Having a great bullish run since May.

$65 today!?
Meet son of Nvidia before he matures
CEO Matt Murphy to be on CNBC this Monday 11:30 am EST. I believe it is their Tech Check segment.
"MRVL could be the next NVDA in the making, imo. Establishing very strategic partnerships and creating a diversified product portfolio are two of the biggest aspects to their business that will make them a semiconductor powerhouse in the future. Enterprise, cloud, IoT, and 5G will carry them very far. Excited to see where this company goes from here."
"Nice guidance! Expecting ""strong Q3"" and a ""significant step up projected"" for Q4 5G business."
A temporary profit taking and external market issues have occurred before a positive momentum will continue with this stock.
I will take in more under $60. Come to me
Rock on!
"Zacks has a ""sell"" rating for MRVL?? Comments?"
"Who, if any, are buying above 60$? I doubt many on this board have bought in past 2 sessions. I am long MRVL but don't foresee this price action as sustainable yet, expecting a healthy pullback to mid 50s$ before we break towards 65$. MRVL tends to move in 4-5$ steps, we did not spend enough time in high 50s$ yet, would like to be wrong but don't think I am. Next dip buy is below 55$. Just my 2 cents"
I am going to listen to the call here at 4:45.
AGAIN I WILL ADD BELOW 56...
Wow 48% increase in revenue yoy. Very nice beat and growth

Up tomorrow
Long term MRVL holder here with 28k shares with an average price of $7.58. So glad when the old founders were booted out and the new management showed up. Lots of ways for MRVL to power ahead now. One area I’m especially interested in is the movement away from AMD/Intel toward ARM. This seems to be a trend at the big hyperscalers. MRVL has the best solution here. My near term target for the SP is $65 by next summer but could happen much sooner.
"You all need to slow your roll, look at the chart, read the financials. Long term, this is a 2 or 3 bagger from here. MRVL stock price is a slow steady riser, sit back and enjoy, or trade dips, be confident that whatever price you own this at, you will be green in short order. By the way, this is the original John on this board, not the one who thinks everybody is short, and not the one who just showed up 3 days ago. GLTA"

Samsung Electronics and Marvell (NASDAQ:MRVL) today announced that the companies jointly developed a new System-on-a-Chip (SoC) to enhance 5G network performance. The SoC—which will be used in Samsung’s Massive MIMO and other advanced radios—is targeted for market introduction to Tier One operators in Q2 2021.
"Such an impressive ER. I can't find one negative going forward. Improvement in every single category for the business. The revenue growth alone is huge. Their data center and 5G segments are growing like crazy. Forward guidance was all very positive with statements of ""significant step up"" over the next two quarters. No way you can be disappointed in these results. If you are a long term holder, you have to be very happy with them right now. Overall company growth couldn't be better really. Nothing but a positive outlook going forward. I'm bullish as ever on MRVL."
Solid earnings. It hit all analysts estimates or better.
Marvell price target raised to $65 from $60 at KeyBanc KeyBanc analyst John Vinh raised the firm's price target on Marvell to $65 from $60 and keeps an Overweight rating on the shares. The analyst cites higher confidence in 5G ROW excluding China buildouts in the second half of the year and strengthening enterprise demand.
"Finally got in this morning, what a nice pop!"
"Per the Action Alerts Club: The bottom line.... Overall, despite the storage segment sales miss, we believe the quarter was solid and serves to demonstrate not only the resiliency of Marvell's end markets but the acceleration many of them are seeing as well. On the call, Murphy took some time discuss this dynamic and where we go from here, stating, ""During and after this crisis, we expect the demand for bandwidth to continue to grow stronger. Major cloud and service providers are facing unprecedented demand for their services as a result of so many people working from home and are scrambling to add capacity to their networks. 5G has become a strategic priority for many nations and also an economic growth driver for economies worldwide. Enterprises are rapidly upgrading their networking infrastructure to support their workforce with remote access to critical business applications and advanced collaboration tools in a secure and scalable environment. We are in the midst of enabling all the key megatrends in 5G, data center cloud, enterprise and automotive as a leading supplier of data infrastructure semiconductors.""Moreover, Murphy went so far as to call out the cloud data center market, which has clearly seen adoption accelerate as a result of the remote work trends noted above, as an opportunity for storage and networking products ""similar in magnitude to 5G.""All in all, we continue to believe that following the divestiture of its Wi-Fi business and acquisition of Aquantia and Avera in 2019, Marvell is set up better than ever to capitalize on two of the strongest secular growth trends we have identified, 5G and cloud computing.While the pandemic has clearly hit many segments of the economy, we believe it has also served to accelerate those that Marvell is most exposed to. With the remote work ""cat"" out of the bag, we believe the need for cloud computing and therefore a built-out 5G infrastructure (to transfer all the data from remote locations to a centralized one) is needed now more than ever as workforces will only become more decentralized going forward. Management has thus far executed the company's turnaround to a 5G and data center powerhouse as well as we could have hoped for and it is now time harvest these investments as the digitization trend accelerates."
"Marvell price target raised to $60 from $50 at Piper Sandler Piper Sandler analyst Harsh Kumar raised the firm's price target on Marvell Technology Group (MRVL) to $60 from $50 and keeps an Overweight rating on the shares. 2021 appears to be a ""major growth year"" for the semiconductor market, as Gartner expects the industry to grow at 11.6%, Kumar tells investors in a research note. The analyst sees the global pandemic recovery and increasing semiconductor content as the broad drivers for the market this year. The automotive market will be the fastest growing sub-segment, while 5G trends should accelerate across the globe, says Kumar. His top picks are Macom (MTSI), Marvell, AMD (AMD) and Broadcom (AVGO)."

"If you own and like $mrvl, check out $simo. Both companies make storage controllers, $mrvl as a portion of biz and $simo as all it does. Marvel is fine company with solid growth outlook after a decade of stagnation. Silicon Motion is experiencing huge market share gains from strong design win cycle as NAND makers outsource low and mid range performance controllers primarily to both $simo. As evidence $simo backlog up close to 100% year on year in 2021 and company said revenues would be close to $1 billion without wafer supply constraints, or up 85% in 2021. But supply shortage real so company will hit $1+ billion in 2022 imho and make $7 eps. At current price, stock is 9x's 2022 eps! With 40% organic growth rate, stock should be 20x's at least, or $150."
"MRVL may be close to a major breakout, in my view, the price target is $60+ in the near term."
"QCOM out with great earnings with strong IOT and 5G numbers. A good indicator of how well IOT and 5G are doing. Should be a good sign for MRVL. Also a good sign is Google saying that connected TV is the fastest growing ""surface"" the company has. Google also pushing hard on all aspects of TV (Google, Chromecast, YouTube, Android) which Marvell has an ongoing relationship with Google on."

"this year end , seeing Marvell at 80 is no surprise"
CNBC gave another plug for MRVL today.. Looking forward to a good ER!
"Datacenter's expansion to connect to the cloud over the edge for all things mobile in the evolution of 5G technology will primarily become available, because of NVDA, QCOM, and MRVL leading-edge technologies. Which in my view will drive the others to new highs and MRVL to a target of $120+ sooner rather than later because of the urgency of building our infrastructure and capacity today and the race began yesterday."
"Just in case you are not aware the 10 year old patent litigation between Netlist and INPHI posted a new court filing yesterday. ""Joint Dismissal Without Prejudice"". Typically means the two parties have come to a settlement!!! Bullish!!!! FYI for those who don't know Raj Ghandi came over to Netlist from Marvell last year as head of Asic Engineering....... I have been waiting and hoping to grab some Marvell stock. Owned Netlist since .20 cents. We should break 10 again as soon as the PR drops. Current Price is 7.72. Congratulations to Longs at both companies."
$60+ does appear to be the next breakthrough before end of the week.The infrastucture bill passing will likely propel the share price to continue elevated levels.

"Marvell Technology (MRVL)Moving to the semiconductor industry, we find Marvell. This is not one of the giants of the chip sector, but still brings in $2.9 billion annually, with a net income of $179 million in fiscal 2019. The Silicon Valley company has offices and design centers in 14 countries around the world.Marvell has benefited this year from a partnership with Samsung on 5G deployment. The collaboration gives Marvell access to the resources of the largest player in the semiconductor sector (or perhaps the second largest – Samsung and Intel have been trading the #1 and #2 slots for the last 18 months). In addition, Marvell will be able to tap into Samsung’s network among South Korea’s early adopters of 5G. For the long term, the partnership is focused on embedded and baseband processors for 5G base stations.In Q3, reported last week, the company’s top line revenues just missed the forecasts, coming in at $662 million against the estimate of $664 million. EPS was decent, however, with the 17-cent per-share income matching expectations.In recent months, Marvell has spent over $1 billion acquiring two smaller chip makers, Avera Semi and Aquantia. The spending was noticeable in the Q3 report, as the company’s cash on hand dropped by over $130 million while debt increased by nearly $400 million. The spending is hardly wasteful, however, as both acquisitions will help the company expand technology in the runup to 5G.5-star Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Seymore is bullish on Marvell’s prospects heading into 2020. He writes, “We continue to view the most-important metrics to be Marvell's progress on its 5G ramp and a cyclical return to normalcy in the Storage business, with both dynamics trending positively. Within 5G MRVL is executing on an aggressive initial production ramp at Samsung…”5G will be making more and more news in coming months, and Seymore sees MRVL well positioned to make gains. He puts a Buy rating and a $30 price target on the stock, suggesting an upside of 27%. (To watch Seymore’s track record, click here)Overall, Marvell’s Strong Buy consensus rating is based on 10 Buys and 2 Holds. The holds are left over from the dip in the chip industry at the end of 2018 and beginning of 2019 – the stock has risen steadily this year. The average price target of $29.50 indicates room for a 25% upside from the current share price of $23.52. (See Marvell stock analysis on TipRanks)"
"Stock is Red because of this, I guess:Marvell forecast adjusted third-quarter earnings of 35 cents to 41 cents a share on revenue of $1.11 billion to $1.18 billion. Analysts expect 37 cents a share on revenue of $1.13 billion."
This is a fake AH crash. This will be green in the open tomorrow
Last few weeks have shown real strengty in holding 60.Wonder if any 13F's show a new stake/increase in MRVL?
