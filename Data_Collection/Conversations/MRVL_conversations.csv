Where is Tom? That $47 guy?
"Beating on the futureWe expect year-over-year revenue growth will accelerate in the third quarter, led by substantial contributions from the cloud data center market,"" Murphy said. ""In addition, we expect our 5G business to continue to grow with strong sequential revenue growth in the third quarter, and a significant step up projected in the fourth quarter.""Expectations were too high headed into Marvell's second-quarter report, Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Christopher Roland said in a note to clients. Like other fabless chipmakers, Marvell is facing supply constraints with its contract manufacturers, he said.""The long-term story remains very much intact, although we note an exceptionally high sentiment bar this quarter,"" Rolland said. He reiterated his positive rating on MRVL stock with a price target of 72."
"Stock is Red because of this, I guess:Marvell forecast adjusted third-quarter earnings of 35 cents to 41 cents a share on revenue of $1.11 billion to $1.18 billion. Analysts expect 37 cents a share on revenue of $1.13 billion."
A temporary profit taking and external market issues have occurred before a positive momentum will continue with this stock.
Any drop is good for a long term holder. It won’t be this low for too much longer now.
"You all need to slow your roll, look at the chart, read the financials. Long term, this is a 2 or 3 bagger from here. MRVL stock price is a slow steady riser, sit back and enjoy, or trade dips, be confident that whatever price you own this at, you will be green in short order. By the way, this is the original John on this board, not the one who thinks everybody is short, and not the one who just showed up 3 days ago. GLTA"
Sold before earnings… did not have 10 percent cushion I require. Bought right back in at a less expensive price. Let’s roll.
CEO Matt Murphy to be on CNBC this Monday 11:30 am EST. I believe it is their Tech Check segment.
Been holding a long call since February that expires in January 2022 $55 strike. On the fence if I should sell now or keep holding
The usual negative short sellers having their moment for a few days LOL
Wow 48% increase in revenue yoy. Very nice beat and growth
"The new products sound very interesting. A long call option on growth liked that statement. Speaking about EV growth, security and overall market growth. Oems are appreciating the high quality of Marvell. That October sounds very interesting with Investors Day."
Solid earnings. It hit all analysts estimates or better.
When this stock hits $110 in the next 9to 12 months come talk to to me.This. Stock is going to be a blockbuster.
"Oppenheimer raises Marvell price target to $70. Plus NVDA & AMAT earnings reports. AMAT's earnings call (one of the best I have ever heard in helping me learn even more about the semi landscape going forward). Semis slumped partly because of Morgan Stanley's bogus, bearish call on the semis earlier in the week. AMAT said all aspects of its business were humming. All... Micron is gonna roll today. Let's hope MRVL joins the party. Marvell shorts have gotta be some of the dimmest traders in the market."
"Matt Murphy and his team are doing wonders. Marvell is going to be a huge juggernaut. Nice numbers today, nice guidance. Patiently waiting for $250+."
"mrvl always scares me when it goes up before it reports. it seems like it always goes up before it reports and then drops. so I'm thinking, should I sell it. before reports or should I keep it."
"This one has a mind of it's own. MRVL has treated me nicely since the mid-20's, on and off a few times with call options. so not surprised when it goes down after a runup into earnings. Done it before - so woulda/coulda/shoulda dumped before closing. My nov calls were up a $1+ each but quickly retracted to just now getting out and breaking even. The behavior says it could continue to fall to $58 range where I hope to jump back in. Seems like a great company with decent leadership. Wish the stock behaved more like Nividia though. LOL. Good luck all longs."
I think this will recover by the end of next week
"Dang! I’ve been riding this ride since MRVL hit $15., got scared of the Covid drop and sold all 500 shares at $25., then bought 1000 at $22.50. I may ride with it to $100. or more. BEST STOCK TIP I’ve ever gotten!!!"
MRVL reports earnings today got a feeling its going to blow past what wall street is prediction it might pull back 1 or 2 % shorts & day traders then to 70 +
This is not a for short- term holders. I think MRVL will trade over $100 in the next 12 months. Nice confident Matt Murphy and a bullish forecast.
"Marvell price target raised to $70 from $60 at Piper SandlerMarvell price target raised to $70 from $64 at CitiMarvell price target raised to $70 from $65 at KeyBancMarvell price target raised to $75 from $70 at OppenheimerRosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann maintained a Buy rating on Marvell (NASDAQ:MRVL) on Friday, setting a price target of $85Marvell price target raised to $70 from $60 at Barclays"
"a chip shortage, and this beats earnings and it goes done.....pure manipulation for a better entry pointthis sees $75-90 in 4 months"
Pete Najarian on CNBC's Fast Money Friday afternoon gave Marvell a great plug by choosing it as his top pick right now and said it has outperformed Nvidia over the past year and has great upside ahead.
"ZACKS finally changed their ranking of MRVL (today I believe) to a BUY. After they so stubbornly had MRVL at a hold for the longest time and recently a sell, they have finally made a change.. Must be due to ER next week?"
"Such an impressive ER. I can't find one negative going forward. Improvement in every single category for the business. The revenue growth alone is huge. Their data center and 5G segments are growing like crazy. Forward guidance was all very positive with statements of ""significant step up"" over the next two quarters. No way you can be disappointed in these results. If you are a long term holder, you have to be very happy with them right now. Overall company growth couldn't be better really. Nothing but a positive outlook going forward. I'm bullish as ever on MRVL."
CLASSIC DIP AFTER EARNINGS FOR BIG BOYS TO LOAD UP LOL...THIS IS GOING TO 65-75 SOON
One more to addCowen analyst Karl Ackerman raised the price target on Marvell (NASDAQ: MRVL) to $55.00 (from $50.00) while maintaining a Market Perform rating.
Nice earning beat and forward guidance. CC will clarify moreI'm loading up tomorrow. Ignore the noise AH. This will open green tomorrow.
$MRVL Maintains Morgan Stanley Equal-Weight USD 49 » USD 57 Target Raised by BMO Capital Markets Outperform USD 60 » USD 70 Target Raised by B. Riley Buy USD 66 » USD 72
This after hours dip is going to make a big U turn tomorrow afternoon and rocket right back up.. Possibly big buying opportunity tomorrow morning..
>>Marvell files for $1.23 bln mixed securities shelf offering<< Is this related to the Innovium purchase or are they just trying to raise some cash?I hope the former. I'm not a fan of dilution.
what time ER is ?
"Pretty good volume today, looking at good support. Looking forward to guidance for 4th quarter. Target price $85."
"I think I should sell mrvl before it reports. then buy it back, it usually drops, after it reports."
hard to imagine what stock price would be if there was bad news
"This happened to NVDA...And, it happened to AMD..."
"Nice guidance! Expecting ""strong Q3"" and a ""significant step up projected"" for Q4 5G business."
"buy the dip as this is gonna rebound hard and make new ATH in a month from now, and run until next earnings 15th Oct calls gonna print "
