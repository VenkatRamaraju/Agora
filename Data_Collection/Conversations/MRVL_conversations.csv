"I think AMD's earnings will be a blowout, since companies like $MRVL, $ON, $MU which have significant datacenter exposure reported significant growth in that segment. AMD is objective the leader in datacenter processors for now."

"In baseball terminology, Marvel Technologies in my view is in its first inning, and the final score will many an Ev or down payment in some meaningful real estate. It's all about the bottom line and X-Mas could and should come early this year into next. Either you buy something forgettable or something meaningful, for meaningful buy Marvel Technology for forgettable there are plenty to choose from."
Will hit $70 next week
another surge coming later today and well see 69 or higher.
"What sweetness! Special congrats to all of the long-term Marvel longs. The last break-out of MRVL was in May of 2020, when it went from $28 to $50 in less than seven months. If the QQQ's & the semis remain frosty, I could see it at $75 by January."
$67.22 is the new 52-week high to beat.
Not to get too technical ~ but MRVL actually closed at a new 52-week closing high. The previous closing high was $63.61 just five trading days ago. MRVL also reached a new intra-day high today at $64.27 ~ the previous intra-day high was $64.07 reached on August 26. While it may not seem important to folks here ~ it actually significant to the technicians ~ including the algorithm whiz kids.
"With the MFI at 48, the RSI at 55 and a accommodating nas, mrvl has some room to run. Hopefully we can climb back to the upper 60's today."
let me amend my post.. I think we might see 70 today.. you can NOT hold this baby down. This is a slow and steady momentum stock. What a great investment.
So why should I buy this rather than something like ST Microelectronics? The growth rate is barely higher here. The sales per share is more than 3 times lower here. The EBITDA is MUCH higher here. STM is net cash positive and MRVL has over 4B in debt. Is there really that much special sauce here that makes up for all of these negative comparisons? Not saying this is a bad company. It just (at a glance) appears to be overvalued vs. STM.
"I love it and I'm waiting for the days coming when we'll see a mega surge, like 10, 20%.. I think we'll see it.. Wait until a new partnership is announced, e.g. with Samsung or Apple or Tesla or who knows.. I feel bad for anyone who is persuaded to get off this train.. All the best to Longs.. stay in there."
$100+ in 2022.
As I have posted in the past Marvell has a small group of employees charged with evaluating buyouts. My understanding is these folks used to work for Broadcom. Expect more buyouts in the future. My long term stock price target is north of $200.
Today is investor day. Obviously the investors must have heard some things they liked.
best 5g company!
I think we're going to see 70 this week.. Anyone agree?
Better Green than Red! Come on November/December!!! 80 EOY!!!
Marvell is an old timers' stock delight. The management keeps on making outstanding acquisitions. That is where Marvell's debt comes from & they secured ultra-cheap financing through the next ten years to buy companies they are growing hand over foot. Great set-up for today. Taiwan Semi had outstanding numbers. The jobs numbers support Nasdaq stocks. I would not be surprised to $67-69 today. I sure hope so for my various calls. Good luck.
"For those who have not invested in Marvel yet, simply put your bank account and retirement depend on it. It previously was on a reset and the share price in my view is at the very beginning of the 1st inning. Do the math upon the ninth inning it will be more in line or well above NVDA's all-time high before its recent split.As the evolution of edge computing and the future of EVs resume Marvel will likely be in many if not all second by second from C2C acknowledgment and analytic data communication transmission from EV's to the cloud. Transportation will get to the point where EV's will become passenger mobile phones on wheels.This comment will live in the bank volt with beneficiaries at a minimum for the next century. Back up the truck and buy, buy, buy."
"This is a long term stock buy , hold and add. The best is yet to come."
Updates from investor's day. Marvell is projecting long-term margins at 38-40% with top-line revenue growth of 15-20%. And that's the rest of the story. It appears that another leader in the semiconductor space emerged today. If you are long MRVL ~ you own it.
Cramer’s analysis of MRVL today is enlightening Stay strong. stay long for 80$ by eoy
"Well I do understand downgrade but I don't agree with it. The thing is that there will be 2 very positive quarters now it is sort of given and then they probably expect things to return to normal + Q1 is not the strongest quarter seasonally overall. So in other words they expect a normal kind of cycle here. But I think it is not a normal kind of cycle - did you hear before about production halts due to semiconductor shortages? While other firms like $MRVL, $MCHP, $ON forecast very strong demand for 2022 I am sure business will be booming here as well, because firms are reluctant to increase their production capacity significantly - not to get into overproduction when things improve - instead they try to outsource production for the time being where possible. Then again next year will have a significant momentum in consumer PCs and servers because of rotation to DDR5 and new processors, mobile also should be strong because of further expansion of 5G, cause many people still haven't rotated to a 5G phone."
"Rosenblatt Securities Stick to Their Buy Rating for MarvellOct 05, 2021 12:15PM ET Rosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann maintained a Buy rating on Marvell (NASDAQ:MRVL) on Tuesday, setting a price target of $85, which is approximately 47.60% above the present share price of $57.59."
"Moderate trading with some profit taking, but get ready for a new surge.. buy and hold!"
"Ha ha ha INTC gross margin 50%, MRVL gross margin 65%. MRVL has the big stick now. MRVL to $200."
Marvell raises long-term sales growth targets to 15-20% (from 10-15%).Marvell sees long-term operating margin percentage of 38-40%.Marvell targets to return over 50% of free cash flow to shareholders.What a great investor day!
Interesting how much this moves after hours and pre market. This stock will grow nicely over the next 24 months
Marvell investor day coming on Wednesday. Should be a great show! We’ll see if the stock can move up afterwards. Solid business strategy for the next 10 years.
"This should be $70+, don’t get it."
first heard about Marvell when Goldman Sachs made them the top weighted company in the ir new ETF...GTEK....bought both....opened a position today....long term position
"Matt Murphy said it on the 2Q cc and reiterated today that Q4 is going to be a banner Q. With that being said, I’m thinking that when they report Q3 their forward guidance should push this stock easily over $70."
