"@kingoft....Investors getting out. Holding cash, allowing Shorts to dig deeper at SDC, and then its BOOM !!"
Used to be a nice holding but not anymore!
"I just add when it down to 620 from opened @650, that’s very good earning no reason someone tried to short it"
@Michael - Full disclosure - I'm long SDC. I also think Invisalign is a great product and the company has done very well for it's stockholders. I'm curious as to your thoughts as to why Align has gone from $737 to $580/share in less than a month?
"Two huge differences between ALGN and SDC. #1. ALGN is still growing like gangbusters, both top line and profit. SDC is stagnant. #2. ALGN is profitable, SDC is not. At the end of the day, investing is about the potential to generate future cash flows. This means putting money into the bank so you can keep it. SDC hasn’t proven the ability to generate any cash flows and this is a very meaningful distinction. This is why ALGN has such a high premium compared to SDC. SDC’s future profitability cannot be assumed. The business model is still unproven."
"Great post on the ALGN Board:Interesting post I saw on Rdt recently.Another in depth analysis of $SDC.""If you ask any dentist a year ago, we would all tell our patients to not go with SDC, but instead to consider traditional braces.This is the same way dentist approached Invisalign when they first entered the market 10 years ago.If you look at Invisaligns stock chart from 2001-2003 you will see that their graph looks VERY identical to SDC’s current graph. $Algn basically went from $16 down to $2/share. Today it’s almost at $750/share, and a market cap of $57B and a PE of 83x! If you compare that to SDC who has a revenue of 800M and market cap of 2B and a future sales to earnings of only 2x you can see how extremely undervalued it is. If $SDC is placed on a direct comparison to align when it comes to futures sales and PE it would put sdc at a $36/share stock.Today, things have changed drastically in dentistry and orthodontics. Clear aligners is a booming business since it’s the preference patients have when it comes to ortho.Now if we are going to recommend a clear aligners and compare Invisalign to smile direct there are many differences as well as similarities.Difference #1 PRICE: Invisalign costs $6,000-8000 (due to 3x markup by dentists/orthodontist). Smile direct cost $1,950Difference #2. Type of correction: Invisalign: can correct anything from mild to severe cases. Smile direct: Can correct mild to moderate cases. Crowding, spacing etc.Difference #3: Invisalign requires you to see your orthodontist on a biweekly schedule (which sometimes this appointments are no longer than 20 seconds, but you still need to inconveniently be there) Smile direct: Sends you the aligners, and through its teledentistry platform follows up with you with close up photos of your teeth and bite. These are reviewed by a doctor.Now let’s look at similarities between Invisalign and SDC:Both are doctor supervised (despite what you read online) Both have very predictable results! Both Invisalign and Smile direct make their aligners through 3d printing. Both of them either scan or take impression prior to printing the aligners.There is unfortunately a lot of FUD that’s been spreading around sdc, and considering the short interest of 59%, we wouldn’t expect the FUD to disappear as short sellers are fighting to protect their positions. Another interesting history that many might not know is that INVISALIGN was one of the largest investors in $SDC initially but after Invisalign attempted to start “direct to consumer smile shops” like SDC, the relationship turned sour. $SDC sued and successfully won against Invisalign, which in turn ended up selling out of their positions from sdc, and ever since then the FUD surrounding sdc started and got worst.Now many are wondering if it’s Invisalign hedgefunds that’s taken large short positions in SDC in an attempt to push Invisalign up and keep sdc down, but that would explain a lot of things.As of last year, (Jan 2020), Invisalign lost their patent to work with dentist solely. This allowed sdc to work with dentist and orthodontist. This is the reason I signed up all my practices to partner up with SDC for my patients who qualify for it. Which is as mentioned mild/moderate cases. I would never feel right about charging my patient $6000 to correct a small space between their teeth with Invisalign, when they can get identical results from $SDC.With that said, I have no doubt $SDC will continue their expansion nationally and internationally, and at currently price levels, it is extremely undervalued in my opinion.For full transparency; I am a dentist and I’m currently sitting on 100,000 shares of $SDC."""

"I Sold it today. Once sold, after hours 651. Ahaha oh my"
I am an orthodontist and you can’t talk about SDC and ALGN in same conversation. Invisalign is such a strong brand. Most people don’t want DIY ortho. I have people that show up at my office every day and I mean every day asking for Invisalign. Most people have third-party coverage for orthodontics so they’re not that concerned about the cost versus smile direct club. I think I am a typical orthodontist in the real world and I find the demand for Invisalign grows every month and every year. I think ALGN is a great company to own￼￼￼. If there is a competition for ALGN it’s do it yourself aligners within the individual orthodontic office. Meaning the orthodontist actually fabricates the trays and does all of the technological stuff at their own office. They don’t send everything to Invisalign. ￼Now that is something that is growing and the technology is just getting better by the year￼.
hope SDC turned + by end of this year or 1st quarter .. Already analysts thinking $ALGN sales dropped that are picked by $SDC
"Their products are all the young kids have to use for future beautiful teeth, including my children and neighbors. Very expensive"
SDC is about to go nuts in a couple days. Expecting good earnings. Curious to see how ALGN made out this quarter
"@Fergus O’Palin....don't you know that SDC is one of the most shorted companies on the exchange? They have an SI for some 34%. If you were smart, and like making money, you'd take a position with SDC at the current price. Q3 ER next month."

Will be interesting to see their earnings. Will see if the stifle analyst was just trying to get clients in at a lower price.

excellent company，but stock price is highly manipulated
"Hard to believe that stifle wasn’t purposely putting out negativity on this company a few weeks ago to benefit favored clients. They rode it down and back up again. The stifle analyst and company should be investigated. They all do it but on a volatile stock is just wrong. Btw, I didn’t fall for the analysts nonsense."
