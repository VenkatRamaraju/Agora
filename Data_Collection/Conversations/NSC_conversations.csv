Railroads will probably feel impact from China. Lack of shipments coming into our ports from China relates to lower car loads for all railroads.
Doing well today!
another quarter of beating estimates.
Is the current administration going against the unions and allow 1 man crews? I don't think so. Do higher corporate tax increases hurt the rails? You bet they do. Do you think the government currently will allow US Class 1 mergers? Highly unlikely.Do railroads historically have PEs in the 30+ and 40+ range over the last 50 years? No.Do you think the rails are way overvalued? I'll leave it to you!!
"Railroads love safety, conductors keep the railroad safe & secure & profitable."
Does Amazon coming to Va. help NSC?
Anyone know why NSC and UNP up so much today? I cant find any new news Thanks VJ
when we get to 210 split 3-1 sounds good
"Fun story for tommy and anyone else who owned BNSF back in the day. (my fan albetross claimed he did, but he was just lying...badly...and has skulked off to more fertile BS grounds...)Anyhoo....CN and BNSF entered into a merger agreement back in 1999. It resulted in the spineless,incompetent STB to declare a ban on all Class 1 rail mergers. Which led to Warren Buffett ""buying"" BNSF (...more actually, he stole it..) and taking it private.Well, had history been different...CN-BNSF would have been the first seamless transcontinental railway. And the very healthy, once-in-forever railroading genius Hunter Harrison would have restructured it into it what he did with CN and then CP....made them the best run freight railways in the world.On the combined and growing revenue base, and sector-leading earnings power, every fund would have HAD to own it. And as the ""Amazon of rail"", the stock would warrant a hefty P/E premium. Win-win. And on that superior service offering it would have produced for shippers, UNP would have had to react and improve (....something it has now finally started to talk about doing..19 years later!)And trucking would have finally had a genuine, formidable service competitor. Many of them would have gone under, and taxpayer highways would be less congested, less dangerous, and less worn out.Yup. Life's funny. And politicians are clueless stooges."
"Congrats on NSC great earnings....I love when all rails perform at such high standard, and all investors smiling.Everyone should read the post Albetross posted on CSX message board today. It shows why Derek/Smokeyis such a pain in the #$%$ It will put a smile on your face. .. glta"
All the railroads are betting on one man crews. Say goodbye to the conductor on road trains!
Another record today- Maybe if they leave Trump alone $150 by New Years
OKAY ! they beat. why isn't it up more ?
Yesterday I saw two ancient locomotives pulling a freight train on Norfolk track in Philadelphia. One was CN engine and the other was Santa Fe. For them to put these relics into service must mean that business is pretty good.
Diesel prices going up- Every time this happens more freight companys put more Trucks on rails. Nsc put 1 billion $ in 2017 to build their infrastructsure to accomadate this. Look for this stock to climb Higher
"National Infrastructure plans, more efficient business practices, rebounding economy, tightness in trucking… all tailwinds. I think this is the “horse” to watch!"
"This is about what I expected considering the drop in volume in the East. The longer term trend is unchanged for CSX and NSC. Both are fundamentally changing the way they operate to become more efficient. Class I railroads tax situation is fundamentally changed for the better by change in tax law. CSX started PSR sooner and implemented it faster. At an OR of 58 they have pretty much done it. NSC is just getting started. With an OR of 63 they have got 5% to go. Goldman Sachs must see this and just raised the NSC target. If you want some rail stock, this pullback might be an opportunity."
"Ok CSX announces 10% increase in dividend and $5B increase in buybacks and goes up 4.5%. Did they miss NSC increasing dividend 20% and increasing buyback of $6.5B? Are the analysts really analyzing or just buying the CSX hype? Where do the 2000 people they plan to reduce work? What do these people do now? If CSX increases efficiency without reducing maintenance and volume, how long do you think it will take for NSC to duplicate? These two roads have been competitive since inception. 50 year average PE for each is around 15. My bet is on the one growing revenue."
"The numbers are in!!! To much faith in this operation ratio, need to pay attention to volume."
Is a split in our future?
ns will be forcing employees to get the Vax by Dec.
dividend increase of 9% to .93 cents a share. write that on the wall.
Earnings October 27. Good or really good?
NSC reached a new All Time High at 153.63
Time for a SPLIT is right ! What are we hoping for 3 for 1 ($80 ish) or 4 for 1 ? ($60 ish)
I was hopeful for an increase in the dividend.
What happened over the weekend that make NSC worth $5 less per share?
"""All aboard""!"
There's an NSC track 1/4 mile from my house. Trains go by about every 1/2 hour. That's why I bought. Glad I did; am up nicely.
record high
Trading halted. Uh - oh.
"We need a dividend raise! When you vote, submit that question to the board! Ask for a dividend raise to 3% yield. GLTA"
wow look at that
"File this under ""Life's Funny"".People never have to think about, deal with, or reconcile the fate they might have enjoyed (or suffered) for decisions or choices that never occurred.Had Hunter Harrison been given the reigns of the CP-NSC transcontinental as the healthy, demanding, focused, once-ever railroading genius, what would it be worth today?How much more of a factor would NSC now be making in the entire American economy, as part of the only transcontinental railway seamlessly linking the Pacific and Atlantic ? And how much more money would you have made from now having (full, real) PSR, earning you an extra 10 cents per dollar on every bit of that (bigger!) volume? Thanks, Jim Squires !"
Love this company and seeing lots of upside going into 2020
How much higher can we go?
Another dividend bump. Great news!
"The railroads have had a misguided focus on operating margin for years. They have been hitting their numbers by deferring maintenance and eliminating employees. Thier stock price is completely out of line with the reality of the situation. They have been a house of cards before today's news but nobody talks about it. I worked at NSC for years, but all class 1 railroads are doing the same thing."
I notice Derek AKA Smokey Lobster is still around and pouting.
"I was a Brakeman and conductor for Southern RR and then NSC for about 35 years. Whenever fuel prices and now a shortage of truckers happened. RRs all picked up more freight. Any of you traveled much lately, the interstates are booming with Trucks. I can see NSC going to $175 soon."
