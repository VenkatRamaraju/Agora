"Yelp's (NYSE:YELP) cost cuts will include workforce reductions affecting about 1,000 employees and furloughs affecting an additional 1,100 workers.Yelp cites the coronavirus lockdowns, which took a chunk out of add revenue at the end of the March quarter.The company will also reduce salaries and indefinitely suspend buybacks under its share repurchase program.Yelp expects to incur $8-10M in costs related to the restructuring plan.The company had $491M in cash and equivalents at the end of March and is exploring additional ways to improve liquidity."
I own a small business and never advertised with them always to much and now I'm think of pulling my angie's List ad because it just not that good anymore since from what I heard that home advisors bought them. Yelp a strong sell .
"I believe it's just a matter of time before grubhub buys yelp. It's so easy to go on yelp, review a restaurant and place an order. If not grubhub, then possibly groupon or a multitude of other companies.Yelp is still a very popular site to review places and the possibilities are endless.This sell off is senseless and I'm adding to my position."
"Yelp’s reputation as a local review platform is well-established, but according to a recent study by Brightlocal, Google is acquiring reviews faster than Yelp and any other platform. The search engine juggernaut shows no signs of slowing down, while incumbents like Yelp and TripAdvisor are now trailing behind. Business owners need to take notice."
what will be price action moving int o next week
"I am buying more, very cheap. All those naysayers will regret not getting it cheap."
Will not go below 30
unethical company... watch the documentary... ALEC member... they can only survive for do long... going to buy puts...
I heard about YELP the other day on (http://Thetraderguide.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
I’m surprised this isn’t 3.00 yet.
patience.. I anticipate it going higher today.
"I thought everyone likes yelp, whenever I look for a place I always open the yelp app first than google."
"Consumer discretionary means just that. Cars, vacations, homes, cruises, restaurants, oil, etc all are on an as needed.Tesla is not excluded.$vac$tol$w$uber$z$plnt$yelp$wing$len$sdow$amlp$xom"
"I said it a month or so ago. Once the vaccine is close to ready, this stock will boom. Here we go!"
"Yelp continues to struggle. More and more businesses dropping Yelp as feds investigate extortion and Yelp employees leaving Yelp reviews. Company built on sticks ready to fall for good..... Reminds me of a many of those dot com stocks that came and went. They had a good thing, over stayed and will soon be gone."
this can be 40 by end this week
My short bet finally vindicated. Terrible business.
Someone today put a bunch on money on the $26 puts. WOW
"They’re buying back stock, they partnered with GrubHub, the balance sheet is beautiful...800M in cash no debt, and they’re expected to do 950M in revenue for 2018...thats tenfold from their IPO...im long term on this one."
"Welp, my decision to buy calls before the close was a terrible one."
"Hope Yelp tanks!! Reps keep calling me to pay $350 month for BS advertising. Yelp is free, why would I want to pay $350 when my business is established? Lol"
I would buy at $25.
"The recent new Apple rating system integration into iOS Maps is very bad news for Yelp. Apple clearly wants to distance itself from Yelp. Apple creates trustworthy products and services, while Yelp has lost public trust and is mostly seen as an immoral organization. Many good companies have shown stock price recovery through the global pandemic, while Yelp stocks are still down."
There will still be a chance to get in below 33 today
"investing to grow and beat estimates just because 2018 is going to be a growth year, it does not justify such a large drop"
"Sell sell sell! YELP is a dying company in the long run. they have no easy way of expanding their features or changing at all to keep up with market trend and their competition is growing twice as fast. Doesn't matter if they are healthy, they are up against opponents on steroids and will be dusted. In 5-10yrs this is a $5-10 stock"
"Who in their right mind still investing in this company? They lost all their credibility when they take money from business owners to remove negative comments. Now, they out perform themselves by labeling business owners r@cist. I guess you have to double down when you have no other optional. Go big or go home right"
"Go woke, get broke"
"In this Crisis, Yelp is creating fake “Go Fund Me” accounts on business owners accounts￼? Please, arrest these criminals"
Be careful when shorts sitting at 6X of avg daily trading volume. Going in at $38
BOOMING
"This jumped on the Pfizer vaccine news a few days ago and has been pretty flat since. Once the lockdowns start again (in NYC now, Chicago on Monday), this will fade pretty quickly as it did each time earlier this year when cases suddenly ramped up."
Congrats longs! Held for 5 years and it’s $0.02 below ipo price...

here comes my $50
I can't stand yelp as a business owner. They are not business friendly. Glad to see the tank.
Today's trading looks like a buyout coming sooner than later.
"Grubhub, groupon should run from this dumpster fire. I know JS Moppelman's moppy hair is lush, fluffy, and quite lovely. But even his moppy head can't clean up this no-revenue-making, outdated-brand-equivalent-to-mapquest mess."
Seems like this is stuck.
Why are my $37.50 puts not going up in value?
"Directly from 2019 10-K:""In addition, our advertiser base consists primarily of small and medium-sized businesses, or SMBs, which are subject to increased challenges and risks. SMBs often have limited advertising budgets and view online advertising products like ours as experimental and unproven; as a result, we may need to devote additional time and resources to educate them about our products and services. Such businesses have also historically experienced high failure rates, and we must continually add new advertisers to replace those who do not renew their advertising due to factors outside of our control, such as declining advertising budgets, closures and bankruptcies.""""Our advertising revenue could be impacted by a number of other factors, including, but not limited to:• adverse macroeconomic conditions, which may disproportionately affect the SMBs on which we rely."""
"Traders are betting on yelp it has to be something good , maybe they can be bought"
"Yelp sales reps are aggressive and keep calling and harassing my company despite being asked to stop calling. Most businesses drop them after realizing that Yelp brings no business, and are just out there to scam business into signing up with them. I don't see a future for this dishonest company."
King of the scam. Billionaire dollar scam and he ain't paying tax on it.. Yelp to 0 and Jeremy of to jail. He watches his share price every day knowing that each $1 drop in Yelp sp is a step closer to jail
Stock moved from $38 to $50 on 2 days after earnings on 35.5 million shares traded (half the float). It has sold off over 5 days to $45 on 12.7 million shares. This selling will soon dry up. The buyers after earnings aren't going anywhere soon
"sell, sell, sell their stock. unfair practices and the government or department of labor does nothing! SMH."
is it to late to buy at these levels?
"""However, until Yelp positively demonstrates that it can not only stabilize its top line but provide substantial evidence that it offers its customers and consumers enough value, this business is more likely than not to just tick along, and not provide its shareholders with enough upside potential to compensate them for being investing in a public company. There are better opportunities elsewhere.""https://seekingalpha.com/article/4371922-yelp-fighting-uphill-battle"
Yelp is down 13.11% to 19.45
Wait... HmYelp not even around anyone.. how do they have a Stock listing?Does the Yellow Pages have one also?
If you pay YELP they will hide most of your bad post... If you don't they will hide your good post. This company is toast.
"Screw YELP. Total scam on small business. Fell for it once and it was a total rip off, hidden charges. Don’t get suckered into they’re marketing calls. Buying ITM long puts."
"Hi Investors and Yelp,Just be aware that two of my businesses are cutting off the $249 stream of monthly Yelp revenue and if our business is ever targeted and vandalized or our employees are ever affected negatively, we're coming for you in the 9th circuit!!! I give Yelp zero stars and will find a way for our businesses to opt out of YELP. Being a public company Yelp you have a responsibility and duty to use an algorithms that could inadvertantly damage businesses"
how much total revenue growth rate?No information about that!
"As businesses slowly open, trying to do their best to follow guide lines, I’m sure yelpers are going to be doing their job trashing businesses on not following guidelines. These small businesses are going to be doing their best after losing so much revenue and yelpers will be out trashing them."
"How can anyone invest in this Mafia organisation.. The only stock that I short and make a living from. As long as JS is the CEO I will continue to show a rock ROI.. getting my money back from the fraud he committed on my business as well as all of his own customers. Any other business reading this that is aware of how Yelp has frauded them so not fret.. simply short Yelp! Totally safe and much better than dealing with the Yelp Army and Mafia. If your business is on Yelp, then you will be extorted by them"
"sell here, it will go down from now on"
"Yelp hid behind a law that was intended for internet service providers pipeline, not for review for profit websites.We are going to lobby congress to fix this, we will win."
"going back to 38-42, that's yelps home. take your profit while u can. even apple and Google steps back after a big run."
The estimate is that 50% of restaurants will go belly up. Not good
"I own a small business that is in the B2B space in a $26 BILLION industry, and for 14 years I have asked Yelp to create a category for it. Yelp has continued to refuse. Yet their aggressive salespeople continue to bother me to ""invest"" in ads.LOL, I have ONE (1) single review from a competitor and good friend who said something nice about me in the review. Yet Yelp was me to fork over thousands of dollars a year for better placement.Yelp thinks that because we have a physical address that we want customers to visit. We do NOT want customers to visit. We want them to order our supplies and we deliver it to them.Yelp has completely botched any change with B2B and their revenue will continue to decline. I know several other business owners who completely ignore Yelp--as they should."
"solid beat all around and good guidance, surprise this is not up 20%"
I’m waiting for 13
Apple should buy yelp already ........
I see a couple of things that could send yelp flying. 1. They may receive an antitrust settlement from Google for trying to shut them out.2. A company like doordash could buy them out.
"Restaurant reviews are a site feature, not a company. Grubhub buying yelp would be like Amazon buying a product review site - and shady product review site at that, one that small businesses hate, that extorts businesses, and has no legit revenue stream. Also turn up a mop upside down and stand it on its skinny, frail mop handle, and that's what JS Moppelman looks like."
"I have had my personal business on Yelp. They delete 5-Star reviews, then call you to pay for advertising, and say “we can add these reviews back”. They call you annoyingly like you haven’t said no 10x before. They don’t give their customers a proper submission form to send to contractors. Ex. They word the same thing 5 different ways so that you click more boxes. Just found this stock and I already hate it."
Who is courageous enough to long this stock at these levels?
"CNBC after hours shows the stock is up 3.25. Yahoo Fin shows down 2.25 AH. What's up with that, Yahoo, fix up your software.."
"Yelp has spiraled into the worst review platform. The stock has gone nowhere but down for 5 years and for good reason. Yelp's platform cannot be trusted. Yelp has this policy of holding businesses hostage who list on their site. Yelp first starts by luring a business into their platform by encouraging the business to list with them for free. The business then encourages people to leave reviews. After 6 months Yelp's ""special algorithm"" program kicks in and most of the positive reviews that a business has under their Yelp page are literally wiped out and sent to the junk file at the bottom of the page called, ""other reviews not currently recommended."" The ONLY way to get anyone at their customer service to help the business owner get their reviews back is to pay an ""extortion fee"" by paying egregious advertising dollars to Yelp. Yelp’s business model is driving away businesses in droves, and anyone owning this stock should get their head examined. They are trading at 70x forward earnings with 8% revenue growth and they don’t pay a dividend. This company will be bankrupt in 5 years if they keep losing businesses and followers at the pace they have been over the last 12 months."
Looking at the chart this stock is a double from current level long and strong
Yelp is such an all around shady company. Who would trust them with either promoting their business or their investment? Not me!
This will be back over 40 by Xmas
Buying at $18! It should find support there...
looking good
"Jeremy ""the mop"" Moppelman definitely does NOT know anything about Yelp's extortion practices, in the same way that his luxurious hair definitely does NOT have a combined role of brillo pad and mop."
going to 58...have a great holiday
"I feel like YELP is probably manipulating their stock options at this point... how are they not only hitting 23$, but also Rising ??? im new to stocks/options, however #$%$ is going on here mate ?"
"Seriously. I can't speak to YELP the stock itself but as a company, YELP is a complete #$%$ Shady business practice, no way for consumers to get help when a business pays them to block reviews, etc. Extortion is a very good word used by Hannah earlier. This company is a JOKE. PLus they got downgraded recently."
scam company
"I want to start a company that sells mops that look like JS's hair. How's this for a company name - ""Moppelmans"""
one year of savings gone!
I say 43 after ER.
"If yelp was nicer to small businesses, businesses might do more to support yelp during this time. But JS and yelp created too much bad blood. And his whining to the senate about google is just plain bad PR."
About 20% oversold and solid long term investment.
"I am a loyal Yelp user, and i rely a lot on the reviews when i check on restaurants. There are tens of millions of people like me out there. Let me go click on a few ads and buy a few coupons on Yelp tomorrow."
The CEO sure loves to award himself stock and then sell it.
sell at this price level!
I have an interview for Product Manager at Yelp this week. Please wish me luck.
I would buy at $5
nice green today
Sell this and buy PayPal
"Im a bag holder now, I brought it at $26 first thing in the morning"
"I am not an investor, but find myself using this app all the time. Yesterday I found a plumber and HVAC through their bid process. Once I receive the bids I can look at the Google reviews and Yelp reviews. I chose someone who had the mid point in cost, but nearly a 5 star review. Secondly, Yelp shows you the health score on restaurants. I always check Yelp before I walk into a restaurant, If you are not a 90 or close thereof, I will not eat at the restaurant."
"I have held YELP for a few years now. Gone green and then red again and again. Why do I hold it? Why did I double my position today before ER? I have been in print advertising for over 3 decades and in the last decade, business has eroded and I hear YELP continue to garner more clients from customers. The financials continue to improve and I am a believer in the system too. Picks after reading the reviews are accurate. Recently I wanted to take my wife to a nice restaurant while we were in LA. Made the mistake of checking out a Michelin reviewed starred restaurant. Should have gone with some of the selections from YELP. Best wishes to all longs."
Any upside once businesses open back up ? Late Q3- early Q4 stabilization ?
"Biggest reason of buying Yelp stock. Every new and old restaurants are now implementing online waiting list system from Yelp. You dont even need to step outside to get in their waiting list. This is HUGE innovation and convenience to people who dine out all the time.No more wait outside in line for 2 hours, check your queue on the phone, arrive and enter to eat. More people will be install Yelp app only because it gave them more power and convenience."
"yelp needs to merge with groupon, 3 or 4 billion all stock deal would equate to yelp getting it for free.. money in the bank for any buyer of groupon. plus lots of cost savings would be generated."
Tomorrow will be over $45
This is now at pre-Covid level... doesn't make any sense.
Yelp still has a stock?

yelp is awesome but I wouldn't buy the stock
YELP is down -4.91% to 41.86
"Because they removed 80% of my reviews when I refused to pay for their $800 ads!! Go to their Facebook book page, us business people all say same thing. I keep telling you this￼"
32 is coming I think it can get to 34
SHOULD I SHORT MORE YELP
Anybody that bought this morning is the safest stock today in this market and next week should recover more
Revenue Guidance inline 952M-967M vs 960M est
Yelp is helping new and old restaurants promote their menus as people make their choice based on Yelp’s reviews/ads
"as a restaurant owner I can say that the no wait app is ok but the problem is that it drives traffic to yelp and yelp's review algorithm is broken. Crazy 1 star reviews are kept on my page that have nothing to do with the customer experience (you can never make some people happy) while many 5 star reviews are hidden as ""not recommended"". Why would I drive traffic to a BS review platform? As soon as my subscription is up I am done with no wait and will NEVER advertise with yelp. They need ad revenue and a large segment of the marketplace is like me. I do much better with google and FB. And these two platforms are burying yelp anyway. Bah-bye yelp! You can't die soon enough for me."
"Best quarterly rev ever with a beaten eps, over react, period."
Told y'all.

Does anyone know about “Billion Dollar Bully” and all the mafia things yelp does to business owners? They remove our 5 star reviews if we don’t pay monthly ads that are $350 and up??
Yelp could raise past 52 on next earnings.
"its obviously not going up because of earnings anymore, as if i needed to state the obvious. just join in and help squeeze it up"
All the small businesses that YELP extorts will be closed for a while.
Yelp will be hitting the 80s before you know it. It is the perfect internet niche play. Local+social= a much bigger mkt cap than it has now
"Is BANKRUPCY in the works for YELP? Will it drop like a Rock? Do your DD, be wise!"
"Groupon was hoping for a YELP take under. Now, both companies looking at BK. Business models not profitable..."
"The last two quarters earnings have been fantastic. The 9/29 quarter beat by 97% and the last quarter beat by 2700%. Yelp should be at least $40, because things will only get better as we come out of the pandemic and new restaurants open."
Nice drop from $40. I just got in. Yelp and other internet stocks will be safe heaven of the trade war. Similar stock in China was valued at $10+B yet Yelp with worldwide market Asian and Europe is at merely $2.6B. Short rebound to $35 after downward settles.
loading up on $15 4/17 puts today. EZ money for next week sell off
God this made my night!!! I wish bankruptcy for them more then I wish winning the lottery lol One for the restaurant owners right here!!
it's going to 25%
YELP does remove reviews that businesses don't like.
Yelp is a #$%$ company. End of story.
"WELL, 45$++ EASY TOMORROW, STRONG EARNINGS AND FORECASTING = 50$+"
"Facebook, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Bookings etc. should buy this."
I Love Yelp and rely on their reviews. For the most part I've went to places I did not know about and usually agree with the majority of the reviews.
Beat estimates and raised guidance. I think I am about to load up.
"quite amazing this isn't up after great earnings and guidance. And then you have citi come out with their own guidance totally ignoring the actual companies guidance just given. This is why some companies don't even bother with giving guidance anymore and probably YELP should stop giving guidance as well. Also just about every analysts increased price targets yet this goes down, though yelp does have a large short base so I think I'll buy here and wait for the activist investor to push for a buyout as that seems to be where this company will get it's actual value versus trading on the stock market."

45$ to 50$ easy
"Yelp EPS +33%, rev+ 12%--lot of firms report much better ER than YELP; even AAPL had better Q2 than YELP.."
"Yelp averages more than 178 million unique visitors every month, across its mobile, desktop, and app versions. Reviews generated. As of Q3 2018, Yelp users have contributed over 171 million reviews of almost every type of local business. https://www.reviewtrackers.com/yelp-factsheet/"
"$YELP went IPO in March 2013 with a high of $31. Now it is back to the same price, 5 years later... People who have held it since then made $0 gain with no dividend. A Bank Savings account would have performed better. This stock has no growth long term, most of the retail and restaurants merchant hate it. $Yelp pressure them to buy ads, and if they don't, a bunch of negative reviews mysteriously appear, from people who had never visited the store. And this is based on talking to several merchants in the area. Very shady business."
I sold another 8% @ 49.33
Just remember......several years ago when this was in the $90s sell side analysts were yelling BUY BUY BUY and putting $100+ price targets on it. Analysts are NOT your friend. I truly hope some of you are starting to get this.....
"This is a $20 stock at best. And even at that price, I wouldn't touch it with a 10 foot pole"
"Amazed this is still in business, ￼￼this stock will hit single digits one day mark the post."
Yelp is up 4.93% to 37.43
"Wow, talk about big brother. I'll never go to or use yelp again. I highly recommend you block yelp on your PC so you won't ever accidentally go there and give them traffic numbers, ad revenue, etc. Here's how you can block a website on a PC. I also recommend doing this to Facebook to. Helps stop their ad networks from tracking you."
won't be able to hold this run people are going to take profits shave a little off lock in your profits now!
like I said ... patience pays.
Going back to $29
"Just wait till it gets announced that YELP has started a sales process, they are already working on evercore to explore the market"
Been pretty strong as of late. Wonder what’s going on..
"YELP is such a fail stock. Yelp Eats sold to Grubhub now at $5B, ANGI less popular and less history than Yelp on every scale also at $5B. Yet YELP at mere $1.6B keep dropping. Their business practice of extorting from small business and company CEO needs to be replaced."
"yes, this is what a short squeeze is. the share price is now above any possible short position so any and all shorts NEED TO COVER"
Yelp is the worst Stock ever! Only Shorts like this stock; because it only goes downhill
wow
Where do you guys see this stock after the earnings release?
Yelp needs to rethink its business model as the constant and growing allegations of extortion are hurting it's image.
Google is going to become better than Yelp for reviews...no question.
This one may go belly up. Questionable business model at best.
"Yelp is by the far the biggest #$%$ company in the world. They manipulate reviews based on what the merchant does with Yelp. It?s bias, lots of fake #$%$ and company?s like Mercury Engineering, SF garage, should not be promoted. Removing legit reviews because they paid u is NOT OK. Let?s watch this stock go to $10!"
So many call bought! Buyout coming??
"Over the past few months, Yelp has been taking steps to help businesses reeling from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic — things like waived fees, virtual service listings and GoFundMe fundraisers (that last one had a mixed reception).But without getting into the question of whether the United States is reopening at the right time in the right way, it's clear that the reopening is happening, and businesses are going to need new tools to safely navigate the changing landscape. So Yelp is announcing two of those tools today.First, it says it's expanding on its COVID-19 banners, with a full COVID-19 section on each business profile. So those businesses can indicate whether they're doing things like enforcing social distancing, sanitizing spaces between customer visits, requiring that employees wear masks and/or gloves, requiring that customers wear masks and so on.These updates will be timestamped. There can, of course, still be a difference between what the business promises and the reality in the store. But as a consumer, at least you'll know how up-to-date those promises are.Image Credits: YelpIn addition, Yelp says it will use a combination of human moderation and machine learning to update these sections with information that businesses have posted elsewhere, like whether they offer curbside pickup or virtual services.The company is also updating its waitlist feature, which restaurants may be turning to as a way to avoid long lines and crowds. Restaurants will now be able to print a QR code that customers can scan to add themselves to the waitlist in a contactless way. Hosts will also be able to manually adjust wait times, and they'll get alerts when they're approaching legally mandated seating capacities.In a statement, Yelp's head of consumer product Akhil Kuduvalli Ramesh said that the company's response to the pandemic has broken down into two phases. During the first phase, ""We helped businesses convey how they are updating their operating models and services they offered.""He added, ""In phase two, as people begin to reenter businesses, addressing the health and safety needs in the local marketplaces across the US is of paramount importance."""
Guidance is excellent so don’t pay attention to citi
Very disappointed in yelp business practices. The reviews are unreliable in my opinion. We get harassed constantly to buy advertising through them for our business. We have complained about fake reviews but yelp will just hang up on you unless you want to buy advertising. On the other hand positive real reviews are filtered many times. Yelp can drive ethical businesses to bankruptcy through their mysterious algorithm. Extremely rude people working there. I don't know why anybody would want to invest in their stock when there are so many financially better positioned companies. A big sell IMHO.
Missed
just buy shop. leave this stock. YELP comes pre loaded on every phone I buy. I take it off to open up more space. Its not a money maker and long term it wont amount to much. It's been around long enough and has not proven itself in my eyes. I love online platforms and apps for companies. That is the future. This company is not one of them.
Yup going below $30 for sure
last earnings it went down huge right after earnings release then recovered the next day
"(-.30) expected (-.01) actual, definite beat. High short ratio. possible squeeze tomorrow"
Sell this is a bad bad news
i bought at 42.80 after hrs too much loss what can i do hold or sell please advise me
YELP is up 5.27% to 34.13
"5 years later and $0.25 over IPO price! Congrats longs you earned it! Today is your day, walk around with pride! You made $0.25 on your $31 a share after 5 years! As Trump would say that is YYYUUUGGGEEE!!! "
Down 18%
I’m a marketer and let me tell you. Yelp is a site we never recommend to our clients!
It should be 50 tomorrow!!!
"Quite low volume down here, just waiting for the pop and the volume to pick back up. It can't go down far."
"what is total revenue growth?The firm does not release this, so does any media outlet!"
Is this thing reporting today?
"YELP maybe sold to AMZN or FB,is this true?"
"It is insiders selling after QTR numbers come out, Doesn't matter if they do well or not on earnings, they cash in. 900 million in cash, only 76 million shares in the float, they beat on the bottom line (the one that matters) by 5 million which is more than they missed on the top line and they are down 30%? The only sensible reason for this drop is insiders dumping after earnings. And we have seen this many times with YELP, huge drop after earrings. But they always claw back up to highs, maybe someone needs to ask about the insider selling next time they have a call."
Should trade back to the Feb 2016 price of $18 over the next 12 months.
Another reason why individual stocks are so risky and diversification is so important. I've been long Yelp for a while and have lost all profits and then some. Ugh. But at least I am not overweight.
Nice
To expensive needs to go lower will loose revenue
The only thing they did last quarter was sell $242 Million in Short Term Securities and $44 Million in Long term Securities and raise money... and their stock goes up ???The comments from the CEO should tell you everything. Only comment he makes is that they raised $35M in Cash/Cash EquivalentsHe doesn't mention 1 word about how the past quarter was or what the future will be... and the stock goes up ???Everyone needs to come off the Cool Aid....
"I bought at 30% down and wasn’t a previous holder, back up 5% already. People are sheep."
Beats earnings and drops?
"Ok earnings but nothing really to write home about, remember the stock went from 27 to 47 in the last year and is at a multi-year high basically. Long term I think this company will struggle so outside of short-term trades I wouldn't invest in this company a dime."
Feb 24 2014 Yelp hit $94.42 with no earnings. What do you think?
stocks is being manipulated... steady for days... falls a bunch... comes back where it was... dead center between strike price.... 39.25... hedgies have algorithms to pick the best spot for them to make money... retail traders dont stand a chance against these trading bots...
Stock seems a little high for a company who has closed half the establishments permanently
I think 95 percent of these negative/bearish comments are from people who own business that bought yelp ads and got upset when they claimed they didn’t work. Y’all really think there aren’t more folks buying ads trynna redirect people to their business when folks are looking to spend money on the app already? Really?
YELP IS A BIG SCAM FOR SMALL BUSINESSES
I'll bet yelp gets bought in the next few months. It would be a great fit for so many companies.
$GRPN Lets look at the price os $YELP and $ETSY . Groupon is way cheaper compare to them. Lot's of cash and great value.I saw ETSY going in one year from a $4 stock to $70 few days ago. Groupon needs just to engage a little more with PR on the great features and savings they offer to customers. BUY BUY BUY!Will not be surprise to see $10 very soon. To much value at a such a low price.
"If hedge funds spread buyout rumor imagine what will happen. It can pop at least 25% over night. Actually, google can see YELP bargain at 3.5B"

"This company is ready to nosedive. Why isn't there more conversation here from shorts, I wonder? Massive layoffs, revenue dropping and a product that no one wants to use - neither the business nor the customer."
"Who was the genius who had the ""go fund me"" idea during the virus crisis? The money that is donated in good faith sits somewhere until the business owner claims it? Such a misstep on top of so many other missteps."
"Unless a company like grubhub plans to continue yelp’s legacy of shady business practices like extortion, they would only be buying a hollow company that has no real, legitimate revenue stream. Why would you buy a mafia company, even if is profitable, if you don’t plan to continue its mafia-like practices? All companies should run from this heaping pile of liabilities. But gotta give JS “the mop” Moppelman credit. He got away with it."
"Not to sound like a basher, but I can't imagine anyone being bullish on most stocks at the moment. Next week's data is going to fuel another sell off (e.g unprecedented unemployment claims, exponentially increasing COVID cases & deaths, more lock downs). I'm not even confident a stimulus package will raise equity prices at this point in time. There will be a lot of great buying opportunities in 1-3 months, however."
"Without extortion, without scaring businesses to pay to play, this business has no revenue stream. Dump it. Also, JS's face looks funny."
Like I said yelp going higher 33
is this the same company that traded at over $70 couple of years ago!?
let's gooooo
YELP is up 4.92% to 40.57
They should have sold this company when they had the chance
Yelp is an illegitimate Cham￼. It doesn’t honor honest reviews anymore￼. You can pay for good ratings and you can pay to have bad ones taken down.
"pow, zoom, to the moon"
"Current stock price is justified for what the company does. Who really uses Yelp anyway except for unhappy customers who would waste their 15 minutes or so to create account just to unleash their angers. Happy customers would just tell their friends and families about their experience. Invest in another company, guys!"
Wow. What a over reaction. This is crazy. I'm buying now.

"Yelp co-founder and CEO Jeremy Stoppelman said earlier this month that the business directory and crowdsourced review forum would debut a free searchable attribute to make it easier for users to find and support Black-owned businesses, and that feature will make its debut Thursday."

$45 is looking pretty good right now.......
"This company is a scam, take it from a business owner who has several listings on yelp. They call and harass over and over and over and over again year after year. I beg to not be contacted and every few months a desperate new employees takes over for the one that just quit and is starts all over again. This is some kind of scam for stock holders. This harassment is equivalent to spam and falls under the same laws. It is just a matter of time. I would not own one share of this. Buyer beware, it won't be long before ll this comes tumbling down."
Hello Pink Sheets!
"Curious how corrupt Yelp is going to know whether a company is racist or not? I guess 1 review from a competitor that works for Yelp and is paid by Yelp....FBI investigating this company for extortion. IRS about to audit as their numbers aren't in sync. Trace ran on their IPs show many out of state people leaving posts, with 25% of those working for Yelp(or sub contracting)."
Anyone know how much cash Yelp has on hand? How's the balance sheet?
"ZACKS have it SELL rating , next week in the 20s"
Strong sell
"Been following YELP for years now. They really have done such a wonderful job reinvigorating their company in recent years, but the bottom line is they are being squeezed by competitors, crowded out of their market and continue to experience diseconomies of scale. They need to better adapt in order to survive, unfortunately, I have no idea how they can do that. -DT"
I am buying YELP to get even with my heirs that stopped visiting me in the nursing home. I'll send them screen shots as this thing continues to tank.
I predicted this would happen
Waiting for $60 plus.Let's go!!
"People who bought $GRPN yesterday after hours thinking they got a 16% bargain is now surely disappointed at 40% crash. This is why you want to stay away from a losing stock, one that lost value in the last 10 years, while market index more than doubled. And $YELP is next."
Yelp business model is not sustainable. There is only one type of content generated on Yelp and that is customer feedback. Many times this feedback hurts the businesses who are paying Yelp and they will tend to go away or reluctant to pay more. Comparatively FB or Google have tons of other content and that makes it more attractive and risky to business owners.
Yelp looks like a single digit stock in the next few years.
"Yelp has too many positives going for it. IMHO, it may cross 60 in near future. Good luck."
"Volume is not that heavy AHs, I suspect it’s a head fake & will drop tomorrow from today’s close."
"I’m not sure people follow yelp from a business standpoint but they used to have people buy ads for long terms and do in depth sales calls and they are transition to bids similar to FB and google. This will show huge profits in the next 5 year but business owners have to learn it, just like they did google."
"Easily get back to the price before last er, i.e. Aug 2018@38 if not rigged."
"the play here is that every long took proffit yesterday and now we try for an extra push up. if it takes, we win, if not, ohh well."
"It's weird that before I had an interaction with them as a business owner I had no real opinion about yelp. Then they tried to sell me $550 a month service to be the first business listed when someone searches insurance (I own an insurance business) in my county. Historically, how many people search for insurance on yelp I asked? The guy said about 50. I told him the numbers don't make sense to me, he said that having a free listing isn't enough because I will never show up in the results because they show paid listings, they even promote paid listing if someone searches me by name. Just because I like talking to people and come from sales I give people a chance to plead their case. The guy kept me on for two hours. To this day no one was more aggressive trying to sell me anything that hard. It would be hard to come up with a caricature that would match the aggressiveness of the pitch, and to my surprise a guy called me a day after to say that he could not sleep because he knew I was making a mistake. I assured him that $550 or any cheaper version wasn't appealing and I was content with my decision to which he responded with a more aggressive approach.Yelp reps kept calling often. When I told them I want to be placed on a do not call list they acted as if I told them I like to lick cats. Like they have never heard such thing before. Are you sure, this is a drastic step? Yes I'm sure.After that I asked my clients about their yelp experience and they all had about the same story that I spelled out above.This company, even without spelling the most obvious problems we have seen in the news has, I think, even a bigger problem and that is corporate culture, and the business model is antiquated. To a business owner they provide zero value, to the consumer the value they provide isn't strong because of the tainted reputation. If I had to guess, I would guess Yelp will go under."
"Yelp has enlisted a glen gary glen ross sales force to juice it's accounts prior to releasing data on the 13th. I got the hard sell the other day. So obvious and so desperate. Short this one folks. The chart says to me that when she drops, the support only comes from a buyer cleaning up the mess."
YELP Is rocking today. Glad to have added at a deep discount. YELP growing local businesses with new contract structures.
