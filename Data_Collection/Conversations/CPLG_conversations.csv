"CPLG versus HLT executive pay: CPLG has 271 properties with 35,000 rooms and is U.S. only. HLT has 6,300 properties with 971,000 rooms in 118 countries.CPLG CEO pay 2M. HLT CEO pay 4MObviously the board is OVER compensating CPLG and therefore I'll be shorting CPLG hard!!"

CPLG is quietly executing. 51 hotels have been sold since the beginning of the year. zit's impressive that this company is executing it's strategy of selling noncore hotels during this time of coronavirus. Long CPLG!

"These poor souls cut their guidance 20% last quarter for FFO. How can business slump so badly in 90 days. If this keeps up, there has to be a dividend cut. I am beginning to wonder what the rooms are really worth for these 28 year old properites. The sales prices have been below the $40,000 implied market value. I wish they had the house in order before we slow down. Their profits dropped 30% in 2009. They also have floating rate debt at 2.75 over Libor. If rates rise much they get badly squeezed. The only story here is that the properites are worth more than Mr. Stock market implys by a $9.80 price. Thye are not getting any younger."
CorePoint Lodging is up 6.60% to 16.79
"If not for the board approval of $50 Million of share buybacks, I would have also sold today.. Going to ride this out."

So interesting how no one follows this stock. Spin offs can have that effect. CorePoint offers tremendous value and their management seems to be executing. Once Covid passes I’ll e happy I bought.
