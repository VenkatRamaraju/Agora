So interesting how no one follows this stock. Spin offs can have that effect. CorePoint offers tremendous value and their management seems to be executing. Once Covid passes I’ll e happy I bought.

"These poor souls cut their guidance 20% last quarter for FFO. How can business slump so badly in 90 days. If this keeps up, there has to be a dividend cut. I am beginning to wonder what the rooms are really worth for these 28 year old properites. The sales prices have been below the $40,000 implied market value. I wish they had the house in order before we slow down. Their profits dropped 30% in 2009. They also have floating rate debt at 2.75 over Libor. If rates rise much they get badly squeezed. The only story here is that the properites are worth more than Mr. Stock market implys by a $9.80 price. Thye are not getting any younger."
Anyone has an idea how much the properties of LQ are worth?

"This stock confirms that every ""best idea"" that gets touted in the media is basically a pump and dump. Not to indicate stocks aren't valid but the aftermath of a well circulated ""story"" is that it almost always has peaked before the transaction. Adage of buy the rumor and sell the fact reiterated. Problem is this gets repackaged to a gullible public. CPMG is a prime example of htis."
They seem decent. Just built a new hotel by the Costco I work
