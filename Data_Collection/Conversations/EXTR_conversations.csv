"And that's no idle speculation, either. Sector giant Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO)recently crushed Wall Street's first-quarter estimates thanks to fantastic results in the data center market. That's good news for the networking market as a whole, but particularly solid tidings for data center experts such as Extreme Networks.Extreme's own first-quarter results showed similar market trends, getting the stock started on a well-earned rebound earlier this month. The company even started a $60 million share buyback program to take advantage of the current bargain-bin share prices.This stock is going places, and soon. This would be a great time to start a position in Extreme Networks"
Extremely undervalued! should be at least $10. Excellent news this morning.
Time to add to your position maybe by middle of next week before it starts to climb to new highs.
keeping my finger crossed for tomorrow morning
A great time for some spectacular news !
Hmmm up .85 AHours what gives?
This is going to be a rocket ship ! Imagine what price we will be in 2years from now then double it ! It a win win situation .
rock bottom and beyond on all chart indicators . oversold on all indicators that I follow. plus tgere are a lot of purchased calls which will get burnt bad down here in a week or so.. not much sense to me. maybe Obama's fault?
this should be above 10 after earning
Needham analyst Alex Henderson upgrades Extreme Networks from Hold to Buy and announces $13 price target.
"Based solely on chart action, it looks like Extr could pop in the next day or 2. Go longs!!!"
"Cory - thx - enjoy my purchase of your shares in the nines!  thats about when i bought more , most from the 4s and 5s with new CEO when cisco purchase was no longer pursued and beating cisco was put on the table but always bought more while going up the ladder- for now."
The PE will adjust some on a beat and a good outlook. I see no reason why they should not accomplish both key issues. I have been buying some of this dip.
"The stock was down today because Navellier sold it from his Emerging Growth newsletter. In case anyone doesn't know, he and his partners sell all their stock before he recommends selling to his subscribers, so the slow march downwards after the initial plunge last week, was his firm selling, and the individuals who follow him selling today. It should go up the rest of the week, and at least return to the $8.75 - 9.00 range.-J"
"On 6/1/2021, CEO Edward Meyercord acquired. 25,000 shares averaged $2.51 /Share and immediately sold them all at $11.43. Now holding 588,347. He has shown no inclination to accumulate EXTR."
"Market up today but EXTR is down 4.6% with large volume. Tomorrow, earnings release before the market opens."
"The reason EXTR jumped higher this morning:JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee initiated coverage of Extreme Networks with a Neutral rating and no price target. Benefits from the company's broad portfolio are being offset by enterprise spending challenges, Chatterjee tells investors in a research note.Samik Chatterjee is a 4 star analyst on TipRanks ranked #1,491 out of 6,408 analysts with 49% success rate."
Extreme Networks is up 6.38% to 10.17
Kicking myself for selling this when my cost basis was 9. This was my growth pick and I second guessed myself. Rookie mistake :/
We added another Cisco washout to top management. Pete Do-Little. This has to end eventually for this stock to recover.
This company has remarkable growth potential and with the growth to PE ratio there is a strong opportunity for a higher stock price.
touched 7 today without much news except an analyst upgrade to price of 9.5 !!! Whats going on !!! Next Target $8
"No worries here. The longer it trades sideways the better the gap fill will be up to 10.50. For a great example check out how SNAP recently filled its gap up to 14. EXTR will follow suit. I’m in at 8.70 out near 10.50.....it may go past the gap, but the gap fill is my play then I’m gone...Relax, and good luck, this is actually a good stock"
ill take one share of juniper for a share of extr. that price has been my goal since single digits.its also the price of the moon.they will need to do it soon. next quarter will reveal if the ceo is really that good and may get us to 20 without juniper. then there is Cisco - extr is pocket change.
"I think, there is 2 to 3 cents profit but stock will hit $3.75 to $3.50 after touch this base will run back to $8 to $9."
"Very weak stock. CEO’s cheerleading aside, recent employee comments and reviews on cites such as the Thelayoff and the Glassdoor depict a very poorly managed company that is struggling to retain talent and grow revenues."
"Still no analysts actions. The only real believer in Extreme has been DA Davidson, with a $13 price target given this January. The other analysts already sobered up. I do not think that Meyercord has any credibility left. Extreme achieved $250 million quarterly revenues by acquiring several companies starting with Enterasys. Enterasys specialized in wireless, a business line that the old Extreme did not have. At the time of the acquisition, the old Extreme had about $80 million in quarterly revenues and Enterasys had about the same. Now, the wireless line of Extreme generated only $50 million this quarter (mentioned in the earnings CC). So, we have here a stagnant company struggling to make a dime non-GAAP profit per quarter. The old Extreme was stagnant, generating about the same profit as presently on on 1/3 the revenues. The old EXTR stock traded around $4 for years, having no debt and over $2 cash per share. The stock price then was almost the tangible book value. Now, EXTR has negative cash per share (cash minus debt) and sub-zero tangible book value. I used to own 30000 shares. I sold 19000 from $9 to $15 and regret not selling all. I never paid more than $5.5 share. I’ll hold my shares into 2020 because I believe that it is still possible for EXTR to reach 60 cents in profits in 2020 and $8+ share price."
"I think that last quarter wasn't as bad as it was made out to be, but I am not a short term investor so I don't expect huge growth quarter to quarter. Its sales were up over 70% and that's fine in my book. What has hurt is that the analyst community doesn't trust management and as such are not going to give them any slack, its now a prove it. For them to get into their good graces again its going to take at least 2 quarters of solid growth and probably exceeding expectations. I don't know if they can do that. This, to me, is a two year story before it gets its ducks in a row and starts really take off."
"If I paid attention to everybody on a yahoo message board that was a pumper or a basher I wouldn't be sane. These are pretty much for entertainment, nothing more. Advice is usually worth what you pay, in this case nothing. If you like this companies prospects invest in it, if not don't or short it. I think it has potential but its going to be a long haul."
"A very positive sign when up this much in an otherwise overall down market. Back to at least $10 now looking very likely within days, perhaps a couple weeks at most. Obviously, it was way oversold considering the overall positive note of the recent CC."
why the board keeps this CEO? early on he said this will be a 2 billion company . giving a way a lot of undeserved shares to boards and officers but most to the CEO . I lost a ton. I believed him too long but managed to get a few new cars with intial profits and have been moving over losses per share until I pulled out . careful of the CEO cheerleader a good actor
Ready to sail through $ 12 by tomorrow when growth sector is being turbulent of late.Expecting $20 at the end of July by steady expanding of business on cyber security.Enjoy you ride to all.
"I agree with Max, stock looking very good now. Charting well. Got right back over 50 day moving average, volume suggesting that upside buying pressure starting to overtake selling now. Need to close above about 11.77 ish, then can really break to the upside. Relative strength has improved, is kinda neutral at this time, but looks like could turn up even stronger at any day now. Go longs!"
trend is up. 80% held by institutions. gi-dee-up
Why EXTR down today.
Meyercord needs to be fired ASAP he has done nothing for shareholders
the presentation at last conference was a worthy one . it appears all on track and the expected revenue from the normal last week of the 3rd quarter is aimed to be in the upcoming info. plus all seems fixed and on track with the costly inventory last quarter. if I wasn't already in up to my eyeballs I would throw more money at extreme. My expectations were lifted and price did sneak up a little. go purple!! 
Positive results.. glad I bought in last June of 2020! Buy & Hold!
Adjusted earnings jumped 60% !
A nice...and much overdue...increase in the share price today. News?

est q1 revenue= 204 x4= 816 annual equivalent/ 113 shares = 7 rev per share x 2x last year's ratio gets an easy 14 price per share. add 200m more revs expected from brocade that's 1016/113 shares = 9 x 2 last year's minimal ratio is 18 share price. Do the math 12 will be floor. However growth tech stocks are a minimal 4x revenues per share. 36? as long as cash flow and some profit increases revenues per share is a great indicator and for comparison. Allimho. Now onto the moon and beyond!!!!!!!!!! no problem for me voting for takeover in the 30s
"I warned you people that a lot of this ""revenue"" from other companies would have problems associated with it. It still remains to be seen how much of this ""revenue"" is STICKY and PROFITABLE. I should remind those of you with retardation problems that for EPS you need PROFIT and for profit we are going to require real revenue. Costs associated with holding onto revenue which may turn out to be ghost revenue and subsidizing sales to maintain the revenue you have can eat into PROFIT. Now I andsaid this 6 months ago t I have no concrete information on what is going to happen but if things arent that great for the upcoming results I do know why. Peter"
Great Top and bottom
Extreme Networks is down 7.08% to 9.78
"Our cheerleader PRESIDENT AND CEO Edward Meyercord sold at the market 100,000 shares of EXTR on 08/02/2019 at an average price of $8.22 a share. He now holds 482,416 shares. On 04/11/2019 he sold 50,000 shares at $7.67 per share. On 05/14/18 he purchased 20,000 shares at $8.42 to placate investors after he had sold on 08/21/2017 100,000 shares at $10.52 as the stock was crashing.It appears that Meyercord expects Extreme to underperform and the stock to drop significantly. Forget about Extreme be acquired at a premium in the foreseeable future."
10% plus increased shares or over 20% in 2 years had a major impact on per share results. no problem for me if the results are better than the award shares.it happened the first year of the CEO but it was more than a yearly award without the results. And now paying a tax on the reward shares. come on Juniper. adjusted Enterprise value is way below book. quite a steal but give me 12 and happy. the 18-20 remains hope. can't spend hope. 
"I think they figured it out, excessive hiring has now stopped, reductions are taking place. Revenue models are positioned for growth. Would not be surprised if a larger cloud company takes over now."
Q1 2019 results better than the average of the estimates. Outlook for Q2 is inline. The company is making reasonable progress. The share price should hold and perhaps start rising materially.

Another fluff PR touting Gartner recognition: Extreme Networks Recognized as a 2020 Gartner Peer Insights Customers' Choice for Wired and Wireless LAN Access Infrastructure.The problem is that Extreme’s large competitors also get similar recognitions.That “Customers’ choice” has not translated for Extreme into growing revenues or profits.EXTR almost always drops following such PRs.
Down 30% I couldn't resist buying some of this. Seems to me this company has a huge upside and a medium downside.
"Okay...now it’s way oversold in after hours. They still realized solid growth. I look for a fairly quick recovery to $10 within a week, two at most. Which is why I will buy if still around $8-ish tomorrow (Wed.)"
"well an insider bought 20,000 shares at the bottom.price means something good."
We had so much excitement when we where buying the companies and now NOTHING! Wake up we where told brodcom was going to make us 100 million a year . If they are on track we should see some good movement soon
"For trading purposes, volume has to dry up first before any bottom will be reached. Its still trading higher volume than its average, till that's over its likely to keep going down. It basically has to be forgotten. Then the bottom feeders will move in and start buying it, assuming its still worth keeping and doesn't go belly up. Unlikely but anything can happen."
Up up up
Absolutely over sold
i am still not selling..company surpassed the estimate for this quarter..just they revised their data center but their next quarter guidance is not that low...is still heading towards billion dollar in revenue for next year...they are consolidating all areas..it will come back strongly
"Extreme Networks price target raised to $16 from $14 at B. Riley 07:38 EXTR B. Riley analyst Dave Kang raised the firm's price target on Extreme Networks to $16 from $14 and reiterates a Buy rating on the shares following the ""solid beat-and-raise"" quarter. Supply chain issues are pressuring margins near-term, but this will eventually be alleviated, Kang tells investors in a research note"
touched 8...next target 9 !!!
"Well after the huge Goldman downgrade to sell on Juniper Networks its pretty clear to see if they don't make a run to buy EXTR they will end up like Eastman Kodak..they can't compete with Cisco, HPE or Arista in the high end market..and we know they can't compete with EXTR in the middle/small enterprise market so they have to offer $18/share for EXTR today or in the next 3 months they are running out of time"
No analysts have come out with any upgrades or even downgrades after earnings also no defending the company on a nasty slide to $4Its becoming more apparent everyday that EXTR needs to be sold to a bigger player. The biggest question at this point is WHO?? It looks like Juniper is making small bolt-on plays rather then a bigger EXTR buy
it all depends on next quarter guidance !!!
Cisco saying we are in the first innings of this upgrade networking cycle wired and wireless...EXTR could be over 20 by mid 2018
"Extreme Pressure on sales force to move up orders. Robbing the next quarter further and futher into the future never pays off. Sooner or later it catches up with you. Company is too top heavy with ex Cisco hires that are draining the business of capitol. Expect a big reorg at end of year, June 30, and layoff of overpaid personal. Thinning is necessary and will be brutal, but may lead to profitability."
"just think about when this hits about $20, market cap of appx 2.2 billion and the S & P midcap 600 comes calling"
Chart looks good. Pierced the upper Bollinger Band this morning but still room to continue to grow and the left to right vector is excellent. The 3 day EMA is moving above the 8 day EMA. Poised for a break out.
EXTR shaping-up for a new move for awhile; new leadership and expansion plans just starting to gel. Anyone patient enough to wait this out might regret abandoning ship now; with higher destinations almost visible.
"Senate unveils $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill, vote expected within days.....a Position is broadband internet and lets Hope EXTR can reach some order"
"Everyone is disappointed obviously. Analysts who put their clients in this for sure are and will probably punish the company with downgrades. Long term investors probably sold angrily this AM after same . I listened to the CC and I really have the feeling , based on what was said, that they are at the LOW point and will do much better with their new generation products and better sales organization. They also mentioned they are much more conservative now with their projections and seems like much more optimistic beyond this quarter based on current activities. I think it is an opportunity to buy here at a real inflection point."
"Extreme Networks (NASDAQ:EXTR) Upgraded at Zacks Investment ResearchPosted on Monday, June 15th, 2020 by MarketBeat"
"EXTR has 69% avg EPS growth rate, 54% avg Revenue growth rate. And Forward PE is only 12 ?So cheap for such a high growth tech company!"
Moving pre-market any ideas was pushing it higher?
"The one EXTR’s director that has been seriously accumulating the stock is Edward Kennedy. He has a history of serving on companies that got acquired. Perhaps Extreme will be on the selling block once/if the stock price warrants it.Mr. Kennedy brings over thirty years of global executive leadership experience in leading-edge firms. Mr. Kennedy has served on our Board since April 2011. Recently, Mr. Kennedy was CEO of CENX, a leader in service orchestration solutions for software-defined and virtualized networks before the company was acquired by LM Ericsson in 2018. Prior to CENX, Mr. Kennedy was CEO of Tollgrade Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:TLGD), a telecommunication and smart grid company from 2010-2017 which he took private to Golden Gate Capital. Mr. Kennedy also served as the CEO of Rivulet Communications, a medical video networking company, President of Tellabs North American Operations and Executive Vice President and co-founded Ocular Networks, a provider of next-generation optical networking technologies, until it was acquired by Tellabs.

Mr. Kennedy holds a Bachelor’s of Science degree in Electrical Engineering from Virginia Tech."
The eps is going to rise it is only a matter of how much and managements guidance after the Earnings conference call how high it goes. Valuation is tricky on these kind of companies but this is a sector which should stay hot and active for quite sometime.
"much better that last quarter, good hope for next year. Setting up the tone for next year. After aerohive, rev will grow, operating margin will grow."
I believe Extreme is 6 months away from accelerating revenue growth..i would not be surprise if we some upgrades tomorrow despite today's selloff
"With this new tax plan more companies will have more money to spend so get prepared for more up grades on EXTR , and maybe a buy out soon"
It looks like someone forgot to tell extreme that the markets are rallying today. Anybody?
the chart is just beautiful on this break out.... it will head toward the $9.50 target price.
Strange earnings CC. It was very short and only a single analyst (from JMP securities) bother to show up and ask a couple of questions. It is almost like all other analysts were already privy to the quarterly results and guidance. JPM securities is one of 5 outfits that have had a $16+ price target for the stock. I expect tomorrow massive downgrades from all of those outfits. The short position in the stock did not foretell the large misses in results and guidance. It actually declined last month and it was not too high to start with. The rise of the stock in last couple of trading days is baffling. It was head fake. Extreme is expected to grow revenues in 2019 at only 3-5%. So what we have here is slow growth company with a less than $1 (non-GAAP) profit per share in 2019. The balance sheet of EXTR is quite weak. I’m afraid that EXTR is a $8 to $10 stock for quarters to come.
"Questionable revenue projections, assumed growth already priced in and now EXTR has to deliver. So far with the latest numbers it’s been a disappointment. This company’s share price sits on the edge of a knife and could easily go back to $9."
"this company has lots of potential, just a matter of days before it springs back on the right track..."
well as usual stock rises before ER unfortunately the last 3 price.fell off a cliff. volume is low and put call ratio favors sell. if ok and finally producing and we found the can that was kicked way down the road perhaps aok. it definitely still has the possibilities. they lined up more shares for award and hopefully a hint that there is a possibility it will happen. seems no reason why we are Stuck in the 5s except the bragging too soon. maybe something uncovered with cfo that results were not as bad as reported . who knows . that change in accounting system even confused this financial guy.
great sign. remember a lot of income at end of quarter is usually the last week. but a delay pushed it into this quarter. they said acquisitions will be done completely this quarter so a huge reduction in cost this deserves a double from here. even 18 or more from peer comparison. or management is just Bsers but doubt that for now. they just shouldn't have bragged so boastfully before. I'd like to hear - hey I told you so rather than excuses and kick the can down the road smoke and mirrors stuff plus hearing a song called tomorrow tomorrow blah blah like gogo my worse investment
Jefferson Research upgraded EXTREME NETWORKS INC from SELL to HOLD.

"According to the CEO, the revenue for 2019 will be more than $1 billion.It makes sense if one compares the Q1, 2018 revenue with the forecast Q1, 2019 and if they can maintain the same revenue as Q2 to Q4 2018.http://investor.extremenetworks.com/static-files/cf02a93a-9226-40dc-9dab-41d6fa2e8267(see slide 9 - Illustrative Revenue & Gross Margin Adjusted for PurchaseAccounting)"

someone else besides me needs to email board that no problem if CEO gets rich as long as shareholders do as well. it's been a while and no 2 billion dollar company as promised years ago.
With the market this bad if we close above 15 we did well.
Do not sell now. Wait for the two upcoming financial conferences - Dec 6 and 12.
Amazon buying Extreme?
"Great numbers. Honestly can't believe this only has a market cap of 1.2B. Should be 2B+ at a minimum but that is my opinion. I think WS knows this too, I am betting the lid comes off this slowly."
earning is scheduled early this time in january itself instead of feb. looks like positve quarter. all eye will be in next quarter guidance
"This is a company solidly building on the future, as witnessed by their revenue growth and increasing worldwide acceptance of their products. One year from now, we’ll be seeing this at $18-20 or more."
I would not sell. This resistance is trying to discourage us into selling. I agree that it will go to 20.
"The Q2 2020 results are below the average estimates. The Q3 guidance is well below projections. The results and guidance are in total contradiction to Meyercord’s proclamation “We remain confident in our ability to execute our long-term strategy and will continue to use share repurchases as a vehicle to create value for our shareholders.”; they do not bear out Meyercord’s optimism. Huge difference between GAAP and non-GAAP results. In the case of Extreme, the share repurchases mask the share-based compensations and serve to avoid excessive share-count dilution. They do not create shareholder value."
Extreme Networks is up 6.90% to 11.15
I think the shock is over and reality is setting in with buy orders at a steal price .
"Extreme is failing to grow revenues materially beyond that billion-dollar barrier and its operating margin is minuscule so it is acquiring another small struggling company, promising that the acquisition will somehow accelerate the achievement of that elusive 15% operating margin - its old carrot for the analysts and investors."
We recently bought shares for our Roth. People are starting to take notice. I love everything about this company.
"is on its way to 10% operating margins. With that, the stock price should be trading at 1.5 to 2x sales, bring it to the $12 to $20 range. If they can show significant growth, then higher. Enterprises hate being held hostage to only one supplier - Cisco - and they will make an effort to support second tier vendors, mainly being EXTR. That's ignoring the fact that EXTR may even have better solutions in some segments. This is an underdog with strength and purpose. I love underdogs. And demand for networking equipment is only going up!"
climb will start and will go on for several days
It is highly disappointing. Any market sale-off and EXTR participates eagerly. It appears that the market is not impressed with Extreme. E-Rate revenues were particularly strong last quarter and this line of revenue is lumpy. Also reemergence of COVID in Europe may hurt revenues. The market anticipates meager growth for Extreme in 2022. Analysts no longer buy Meyercord pitch. Meyercord’s $2B (revenue) company was a passing dream. Extreme struggles to reach $1B.
any guesses on earnings today? over or under .14 eps & 241.5 rev?
why this movement
"Beware of Mark Kelleher. He was the analyst that a day before the previous (Q3) earnings release increased his price target to $20. Today he still sees EXTR as a compelling buy with a price target of $13. I expect the other analysts to drop their price targets to the high single digits.Analyst Mark Kelleher at D.A. Davidson said investor disappointment “will likely be magnified as this is the third-straight quarter of integration ‘issues.’” He still reiterated his buy rating, and $13 price target, saying he views the stock as “a compelling value play” in the networking sector."
EXTR being up during an otherwise very down market today indicates strong investor conviction that it was far too oversold. Common sense starting to prevail.
"Despite the flurry of the recent upgrades, EXTR as usual is participating eagerly when the NASDAQ drops. A very frustrating stock.."
"Meyercord did forecast that the revenue for 2019 will be more than $1 billion.""We still expect total fiscal '19 revenue to be north of $1 billion.""This would be the revenue breakdown for 2019:Brocade (data center) = $160m to $170m (new revised forecast) (Previous expectation was $230m)Avaya = $160m to $180m (current run rate was from $40m to $45m per Q) ( Management expectation was $50m per Q)Extreme base at $650m (current) with 8% growth (current) = $700mTotal revenue for 2019 > $1 billionIf the management cannot top $1 billion in 2019, they should all be fired.Core Extreme revenue""Our core Extreme business exits fiscal 2018 on a $650 million run rate and we expect this business to maintain a similar growth rate into next year.""$650m at 8% growth > $700mBrocade's (data center) revenue""Two, we are resetting the baseline expectations for our data center business. ... We believe the expected annual run rate base is $160 million to $170 million. ""Regarding Avaya's revenue,""We saw, as you recall in our Q2 revenue dipped down to the $40 million. We've seen that come back to the mid 40's. Gross margins that were in the 45% range or now in the 55% range, we've taken that gross margin up by 10 percentage points.""$40m x 4 = $160m (worst case) $45m x 4 = $180m (current)"
break out? how about back to where we were at 15.50 with a lot of cheers about only hope and expectations not results except for management with more shares given without results. we were lower then when the new CEO took over.
Extreme Networks is up 6.43% to 10.43
I did you guys a favor and sold down to only a few thousand shares Soo it would move up. moved them into MJ a while back when extr in the low 6s . way too good to be true move for me . Cron acb and cntff in 6s low 7s . know when to buy um problem is know when to fold um . should have when extreme was 15.5 my cost was 6s when new CEO cheerleader stepped in.

"look at the volume... probably all institutional over 1 million in first 10 minutes, doubt that as ever happened with EXTR"
"I haven’t sold one share. This is a company solidly building on the future, as witnessed by their revenue growth and increasing worldwide acceptance of their products. One year from now, we’ll be seeing this at $18-20 or more."
Sales jumped 76% higher !!!!!
EXTR is now a buyout target
"Meyercord is the pretty face. They finally got rid of their Chief Revenue Office Bob Gault, and they need to take a look at Nabil Bukari their Chief Product and Engineering Officer. Obviously he's not enhancing their existing product enough to compete with the big dogs...hence the acquisition of company after company to get to the ""billion dollar"" company they aspire to be. They don't have the internal talent to run a billion dollar company."
up AH so we'll see tomorrow if they turned corner. Qtr figures Oct 28
"whoops maybe 13.00 middle of next week. also increase in fy estimates to .80 by quite a few ""estimators"" driving the price, on to the moon once again! hopefully beyond too"
Solid Result. Should climb to 13-14 soon.
hmm finally new customers. ok guys and gals do you think extr will be profitable for first time as promised
"guidance... Our March quarter will be the first quarter of fully consolidated operations and we expect to deliver year-over-year organic growth in our core Extreme business, meeting or exceeding our annual target of $430 million of newly acquired revenue which is evident in our guidance,"" Meyercord added."

"It all comes down to ER next week. They’ve beat estimates 3 out of 4 qtrs! I’m betting on a beat, even tho they have high figures on Zacks to beat the estimates. But they need to show they are really growing! GL2All"
"Extreme Networks Names Calvin Rowland as Senior Vice President of SaaSTue, July 27, 2021, 6:05 AM·3 min readProven Cloud Leader to Drive SaaS Growth and AdoptionSAN JOSE, Calif., July 27, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Extreme Networks, Inc.

"My guess is EXTR is being shopped around some suitors..Ericsson, Nokia and Juniper price $10--12/share"
my best guess over 13.00 by end of month then up with happy historical march so I bought more yesterday.
"EXTR will replace Time Inc. (TIME) in the S&P SmallCap 600 effective prior to the open of trading on Thursday, February 1. My hope is this attracts some new analysts to cover EXTR and should produce some upgrades. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/healthcare-services-group-set-join-225200982.html"
"stock is up because CSCO released results, and expects to grow. I guess the assumption is that the entire market will grow. At least for those buying today."
Cisco CEO said we are in the EARLY innings of a huge upgrade cycle for the networking industry...I think Extreme will see earnings explode 2nd half 2019 and 2020
"Good Q4 2021 results: beat estimates moderately on both bottom and top lines. Q1 2022 guidance is wide with the middle range a bit better than estimated. Still, growth is sluggish. The stock should react positively."
"So it is D.A. Davidson analyst Mark Kelleher that caused the head fake stock rise just before the earnings release. Should anyone still trust D.A. Davidson? Kelleher is trying to save face by sticking to his bullish stance. Kelleher reiterated his buy rating, which he's had on the stock since September 2016, and his price target $20, which he had raised from $17 on Monday before the results."
EXTR reached a new 52 Week High at 14.49
somebody posted they will buy when it gets down to this price . I hope it's a million share deal.
Someone must be very pleased with getting the cheap shares. Thanks to the CEO.Their total revenue for 2018 is now nearly $1 billion. Total GAAP Revenue = $983.1 millionAdjusted GAAP Revenue = $998 million( I am sure the CEO and CFO would be amply rewarded for meeting their revenue number of $1 billion.)Market capitalizationCSCO $ 206 b (rev: $48 b)HPE $ 24 b (rev: $30 b)JNPR $ 9.4 b (rev: $5 b)ANET $ 20 b (rev: not more than $1.9 b ) !!!EXTR $ 0.75 b (rev: $983m)
"I fully expect that Extreme next Acquisition will be Lantronix Inc, (LTRX) before Yr/End 2021growing organically is not An Option I.e Extreme, with many start-up entering Unified/Comm markets..The LTRX Acquisition will make EXTR more Relevant with Newer-5G/IOT Go-To-Market Products. Its Senior-Age EXTR only way, but a Good-Way!!"
9.00 soon
Poor Q3 results. Poor Q4 guidance. Stagnant company. Management lost all credibility. Expect a blood bath today.
"By having visited and worked with ExtremeNetwork, I know how serious is this company, I am betting that they will reach 12-14 as they already did when topping at more than 15. Full confidence in their positioning."
"to whomever was asking about the 30,000 customers, here is the quote from Kodaclout PR - ""Even with 30,000 customers globally, including half of the Fortune 50 and some of the world's leading names in business, hospitality, retail, transportation and logistics, education, government, healthcare and manufacturing, we remain nimble and responsive to ensure customer and partner success."
"Too many global issues right now for a big move up. Trump will likely tell the Iranians to pound sand, which the markets wont like. Possibly a war with them at some point. Trump investigation moves along, they will find something to justify their existence if nothing is there, and there could be, after all Trump isn't a politician so what makes sense as a business deal could be a violation of political law. Plus EXTR earnings are next Tuesday, last quarters weren't exactly a ball of fire. So who knows."
CEO are not paid based on their forecast but on meeting their actual numbersThe company did meet their revenue forecast and non-GAAP net income and gross margin.Total Q4 revenue Forecast: $277 million to $287 million. Actual: 278.3 millionNon-GAAP gross margin is estimated to be in a range of 58% to 60%.57.6%Forecast: 58% to 60%.Actual: 57.6%Non-GAAP net income Forecast: $19.2 million to $27.9 million or $0.16 to $0.23 per diluted share. Actual: $20 millionSo his performance on the earnings call is indeed scripted and not one a seasoned CEO would have done.A seasoned CEO would have pointed out that the forecast revenue for Q1 2019 would be $23 million more than 2018 Q1 and that the lower forecast was based on seasonality and the current economic conditions especially with the tariff war. No seasoned CEO would have gone out of their way to air their dirty laundry in public because this would reflect badly on their management and execution but also provide ammunition to his competitors. So the real question remains ... why did he do it at a new time of 8.30am just before the opening bell ?Think harder...
Anyone have any idea how much $$ Meyercord got for completing these acquisitions that have brought nothing to shareholder value?
I think we’re slowly climbing. It’s trending up.
What the hack?
"Overpaid for a no-name SDWAN company who’s niche at best. Zero US footprint. This will take years to see any real reality towards their bottom line. It’s nothing more than checking a box on an RFP with no hope of ever causing market differentiation, disruption, or penetration."
Shorts will have a tough time covering their position. I don’t think it is worth to sell below $11/12 range here.Gl!
In since 5 and holding . Great story and great things to come ! Earnings calls was a winner . Growth story
"In reading the press release today about KodaCloud, I was reminded in the “About Extreme Networks” that besides having over 30,000 customers worldwide, they also serve half of the Fortune 50. That’s speaks highly."
"Lake Street ups Extreme Networks FY22 estimate, says could be 'first of several'After Extreme Networks reported Q4 revenue above consensus and estimated FY22 revenue growth of 7%-9%, Lake Street analyst Eric Martinuzzi said he ""likes the confident posture entering the new fiscal year"" and he bumped up his own FY22 growth rate assumption to 7% from a prior 6% estimate. The analyst, who said it ""is natural to wonder if a boost to our revenue forecast is one-time in nature or the first of many,"" added that he senses his ""upward revision to revenue could be the first of several in FY22."" Martinuzzi has a Buy rating and $14 price target on Extreme Networks shares."
"10,50$ by end of month"
why would anyone sell when they just announced... Company is targeting revenue in a range of $262.0 million to $272.0 million
another good one - https://finance.yahoo.com/news/melbournes-metro-trains-selects-extreme-200000055.html
Will it touch 6 soon??
getting better already
"The CFO is leaving but Extreme is reaffirming its weak guidance for the fiscal first quarter ending on September 30, 2018 issued on August 8, 2018. Meyercord concluded, ""We are confident in our fiscal first quarter guidance and continue to see strong wins in the market across our product portfolio, in cross-selling opportunities and within our targeted industry verticals in all of our geos, along with improved linearity."""
nothing much is happening here...next week it might show movement as last week before earnings
Its a steal at this price with all the products and customers in their pipeline.

This last contract is bigger than expected

"Again, on 07/01/2021 CEO Ed Meyercord exercised 25000 options, acquired at $2.51 and immediately disposed all at $11.38. It appears to me, that unlike some of the recent pumpers here, Ed does not believe that EXTR will rise significantly this year…"
hmm Amazon might buy us out soon ? 
the only think you can be sure is that ED will be there if we need a pump....selling stock like no tomorrow.
"Heard a rumor today that Arista Networks, Inc. is looking at us, Seems to make sense to me, Anybody else hear this one?"
No Update and reactions. Steady.. Quarter is about to end and hoping to reach 9-10 range soon in next 1-2 months
"Highly disappointing. Q3 2018 results and Q4 2018 guidance are below what was estimated and projected. The company is making progress but slower than what the analysts with their high teens price target had expected. IMO, The stock will do well to stay above $10. The book value of the stock is about $1 so it does not provide much support to the stock price."
"Not bad for Extreme, government spends money for gear made by Extreme (from the House proposed bill)Provided further, That a State or local educational agency receiving funds under this heading may use the funds for activities coordinated with State, local, tribal, and territorial public health departments to detect, prevent, or mitigate the spread of infectious disease or otherwise respond to coronavirus; support online learning by purchasing educational technology and internet access for students, which may include assistive technology or adaptive equipment, that aids in regular and substantive educational interactions between students and their classroom instructor; provide ongoing professional development to staff in how to effectively provide quality online academic instruction;"

However, he keeps a Buy rating on the shares, stating that he thinks investors will be encouraged by the company's swift action to shore up its liquidity and buy time to work out a new debt agreement."
"Well, looks like EXTR have set themselves up for takeover interests..the problem will be EXTR will want 17/20 share but with the stock at 8 its going to be hard for anyone to offer anything north of 15.. Juniper and Nokia looks like potential suitors"
Houston we have a lift off - finally. thanks to jpm. to the moon and beyond. (it is about time)
"SAN JOSE, Calif., Feb. 6, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Extreme Networks, Inc (Nasdaq: EXTR) (""Extreme"" or ""Company""), a cloud-driven networking company, today announced that the Board of Directors authorized an increase to Extreme's share repurchase authorization to $100 million over a three-year period. In October 2018, the Board authorized a share repurchase of $60 million over a two-year period. To date, the Company has repurchased $45 million and is now replacing the remaining $15 million authorization with the increased amount."
Any news why this has declined 5% today? I can't find any? I'm debating of adding some more shares.
"Yesterday I again read the company’s remarks after last quarterly report. Then I again added more shares to our Roth and a trading account. The story grows substantially later this year and beyond, so positioning yourself NOW with these discounted prices will certainly pay off later."

"It's simple, cut 12% of the top heavy expensive payroll and the company with shift to a profitable mode. But do they have the ""RIGHT STUFF"" to pull it off at year end. July 1, 2019."
Perhaps some institutional fund finally figure out EXTR has 70% EPS growth and 54% revenue growth with only forward PE of 12.
"We need PRs about multimillion-dollar sales related to the new acquisitions, not the old tired campus-related small sales “Extreme Networks today announced that Toi Ohomai Institute of Technology, one of the largest tertiary education providers in New Zealand, has selected Extreme Networks to upgrade both wired and wireless networks across eight campus locations and more than 70 delivery sites.”"
"Rev growth is not slowing down... Second quarter revenue was $231.1 million, an increase of 48% year-over-year."
"Meyercord sees no reason to accumulate the stock. On Apr 29 he exercised 100,000 options at $2.51 a share and sold them all for $12 a share. On May3, he exercised 25,000 at $2.51 and sold them all at $11.34. Meyercord now owns 670,174 shares and his actions betray reluctance to accumulate the shares.Meyercord’s CFO Remi Thomas also disposed of 25,000 shares on Apr 29 at $12. He holds only 42,167 shares.These actions are troubling and other than the lukewarm price target increase of the stock by B. Reiley, other analysts stayed quite and no congratulations were offered during the earnings CC."
I would like to think we have turned the corner and we are going to have nice gains from here on out.
"Wow !! Impressed with the CALL!! Extreme is doing a lot , this will be a $45.00 stock in no time"
well CC is far from disaster. More about getting to top of mountain and sounds possible.
"Here we have a company with 1B revenue and around 1B EV, and we have many other so called growth tech companies with a few hundreds millions dollars revenue and market cap above 50B, and even with their growth they never going to generate more than 5B."
10/9/20B. Riley Securities analyst Dave Kang raised the firm's price target on Extreme Networks to $9.50 from $9 and reiterates a Buy rating on the shares following the company's increased Q1 outlook.
DA Davidson raised its target from 17 to 20
got out a while back but lots at the highs . hung on with some but gone so just watching and wondering when zero value will come . NFL with no fans in stadium big impact .
Extreme Networks is up 7.83% to 11.71
"How can this company drop so much and not give us feedback , information . Seems they don’t care about the investors ."
This is way overdue to start moving more aggressively back up.
As of Friday 2- 5% + acquisitions in EXTR- Paradigm Capital Management and the Vanguard group. Check the SEC filings.
PPS is returning back to where it should be...north of $13. Too good of a company and incredible future opportunities for big growth year after year. Glad we own it in both our retirement Roth and a trading account. Both will nicely benefit.
"Where oh where is the bottom.........once it hits,it will recover very quickly!"
Good news for a change:Extreme Networks Provides Update on Q1 Outlook; Expects to Deliver Revenue and EPS Above High-End of Previous Outlook
"July 13 - Cisco, Juniper Fall on Report Amazon May Sell Data Switches""Amazon Web Service’s plan to enter the $14 billion global market for the equipment that helps shepherd traffic around networks, signals the company may become more entrenched in the enterprise computing marketplace, The Information reported, citing a person with knowledge of the discussions. ""Look at the effects it had on volume and prices of CSCO, JNPR and ANET on July 13 vs the company. (Compare the high and low and closing price, and speed of recovery of the prices)And the company ""suddenly"" discovered that there was a shortfall of $10 million in their data center during the last week of the quarter.""We were surprised by a shortfall of approximately $10 million in our data center bookings during the last week of the quarter. "" - Ed Meyercord, Q4 2018 Earnings Conference Call August 8, 2018 9:00 AM ET Was the CEO serious when he claimed that he was not aware of $10 million shortfall until the last week of the quarter when this is the same CEO who reported that ""During Q4 we close 20 large $1 million plus deals twice as many as last quarter ""$10 million for the company is not chump change.A most unlikely story unless the CEO and his management team are really that incompetent."
"Some insider buying by a single director.6/1/2020. Edward H Kennedy. Director. Buy. 27,900 shares. $3.57 per share5/28/2020. Edward H Kennedy. Director.

EXTR is up 10.11% to 2.07
up up up..here we go !!!
"This poor performing company needs a shrewd CEO that knows how to run a business, not a cheerleader. The last thing this company needs is a woke idiot at the helm. Under Meyercord, Extreme might become “socially responsible”, “ diverse”, and bankrupt. ""Extreme is taking the next steps in our corporate social responsibility efforts with the appointment of Katy Motiey and Kimberley Basnight to their newly expanded roles. As a diverse and increasingly socially responsible employer, our Board of Directors and our leadership team are committed to creating and adopting meaningful policies and practices that improve our environmental footprint and expand diversity, equity, and inclusion among our employees, partners, customers, suppliers, and business communities,"" said Ed Meyercord, President and CEO of Extreme Networks”"
"Is Extreme Networks, Inc (NASDAQ:EXTR) a great investment today? Prominent investors were becoming hopeful. The number of long hedge fund positions went up by 6 lately. Extreme Networks, Inc (NASDAQ:EXTR) was in 25 hedge funds' portfolios at the end of the first quarter of 2021. The all time high for this statistic is 25. This means the bullish number of hedge fund positions in this stock currently sits at its all time high. Our calculations also showed that EXTR isn't among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds (click for Q1 rankings). There were 19 hedge funds in our database with EXTR positions at the end of the fourth quarter."
Two strikes against the CEO.Price has dropped from $11.75 to $6.25 since the Q3 earnings call.He will be fired if he cannot get his act together. One of the analysts on the earnings call asked why the management should keep their jobs.And why did they schedule an earnings call before the market opens (5.30am PDT)? They have not done so before.
"Q1 2020 results: worse than expected results on GAAP, slightly better than projected on non-GAAP. I suspect that we have financial engineering in play here. Slightly negative cash flow. Q2 guidance: slightly below expectations.Notwithstanding the cheerleading of Meyercord, Extreme is rather stagnant and profitability is meager. Meyercord knew this when he sold 100K of his shares at the market a couple of months ago for $8.22 a share."
Meyercord's performance in the earning call was pathetic and bizarre.And to schedule an earning call just before the opening bell is extremely short-sighted unless he wants to get cheap options.And why did he have to sound so negative especially in his Q1 2019 forecast ?Most CEOs would instead point out that the forecast revenue would be $23 million more than 2018 Q1 revenue and the lower forecast was based on seasonality and the company is still growing the revenue and that it would be over $1 billion in 2019. (He did mention this in passing.)Instead he gives excuses and resort to blaming those in charge of the data center networking revenue.Why would he bother to go into such detail to give more ammunition to his competitors is really beyond me.I hope his performance was a result from a call from someone like Jeff Bezos.
Large 500 to 50 reduction in force last week on top of shutting down last week to get vacation off books should improve profitability next year. I expect more layoffs toward the end of Q1. Could drop toward $5.50 but I think will be to $10 by tear end.
"The revenues are obviously growing, the product seems to be top of the line. The COO seems to be very happy with the exponential growth. Its very unusual for the drop in the stock price. It almost apears that this stock is being manipulated. Why would a stock go from $15+ to 5 when earnings exceaded expectations last quater? Somthing fishy here."

"Stocks usually drop on quarterly reports except for the most exceptional. I figured it would head south about a point or so. Their revenues are going to be up, their earnings will miss next quarter, but they are growing and that's all that matters at this point. Many doe-eyed are expecting the next Facebook or something like that, aint ever going to happen."
Just done reading the conference call. Organic growth will accelerate from the Dec qtr to the March qtr. Margins expected to rise even higher owing to resisting discounting that Avaya and Brocade customers got used to getting. Business model shifting out of 3rd gear into 4th and then 5th as acquisition integration winding down. Another quarter of the sales force understanding all the new products and how to sell them.
Don't sell at this low price hold out for $20.50 at least.  just bought more strong hold 
"I think most people know this was considerably oversold. Considering the mostly solid quarter, we’re likely at $7-$8 range quickly, but for awhile."
Meyercord lost my confidence when he said that repurchasing shares creates shareholder value. How does taking my shareholder money and using it to purchase shares create value? It doesn't. He sounds like he's going back to his banking roots for that one. There been alot of promises with none fulfilled. Time for the board to take a look at getting a new CEO that understands how to create value through operations.

I would not sell. This resistance is trying to discourage us into selling. I agree that it will go to 20. So long as Blackrock and Vanguard are not selling I’m no selling.
