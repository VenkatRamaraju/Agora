"Yes, 6.3% quarterly dividend increase from 47.5 cents to 50.5 cents, ex-div tomorrow Nov 26. Annualizes to $2.02 or 3.18% at current 63.57 share price, up four dollars over last 12 months, for 10% trailing total annual return at preferred income tax rate. Same period S&P return 17%, utility index also 17%. Significant underperformance probably related to merger situation, but as a cause or as an effect? We'll see going forward. PG&E 70% loss makes everything else look good."

"Insider John C. Wilder bought $1.25 million worth of EVRG at $62.96 on October 6th, and he bought $1.25 million worth of EVRG at $62.85 on October 5th. It's TIME TO BUY EVRG on the pullback to $63.00 for a day trade!"
Just accumulate several good utilities and hold. EVRG is one of the good ones. IMO.
A correction to my earlier post. In my reply to Bill I used his figure of 10% for the expected dividend increase. What the Companies said was that the increase would amount to a 15% increase for WR holders and no increase for GXP holders.
"EVRG has half the revenue, half the profit of VST, but $12B market cap vs the $9B market cap of VST."
INSIDER TRADE ALERT for EVRG!
"Bill, the latest dividends were declared by WR and GXP in May, presumably the 10% increase will declared by EVRG for the next dividend, probably in August."
