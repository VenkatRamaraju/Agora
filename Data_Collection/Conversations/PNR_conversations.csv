Citron announced two weeks ago to short PLUG when it was over $18 with his target price of $10. Look at the price of PLUG now. It hurt the stock price for no more than a week and the stock shot up over $25 this week.

"I see most of Pentair commercial business holding steady through the recession and realignment of society in the coming years. I could totally see their pool business falling into unprofitable levels, as vacation homes are less utilized through at least 2022. If it drops to match the lows, then I'll buy more for the dividend, which is rock solid, and wait it out. Also in WTS and MWA. Anyone see reason to be bullish on the pool segment?"

I am a customer and a shareholder. My pool had the problems you speak of but my builder foley pools refuses to service a fully paid pentair customer. If the agents won’t show up this is bad for pentair
What happen here...why the big drop...a split?

"Working for PENTAIR is just like the Slave Hebrews working for the Egyptians. They take away the straw and double the quota. Sadly PENTAIR is not the only company employing this philosophy. Working at PENTAIR means you will be asked to do more with less each and every day. A former Hoffman (PENTAIR Sub) President confided in me before he retired "" I am scared where this all leads to and I did what I could to save as many workers as I could for as long as I could."""

Any thoughts on a PNR merger with XYL (Xylem)?
"There was an interesting article on Simply Wall St. Title: Intrinsic Calculation For Pentair plc (NYSE:PNR) Shows Investors Are Overpaying. After reading it several times, they have a point. I agree that their calculations are good, something around 33.00. However, long term might be a different matter. I don't think this company is going away or it's being mismanaged. It's about timing. It might be a year or two before they show real growth again. That's the question, are they valued correctly today? The short answer is no. But long term.....I see the upside."

PENTAIR will show great margins and slow sales. This is what they have done for the last few years. Look for a modest increase in the Dividend - prior to the split up. All this to keep the stock stable. Ask yourself - Where in the world did the $3.4 Billion go that they got from the sale of the Oil stuff. Nothing has been said about it at all. PENTAIR did not buy anything nor did they have significant debt to pay off (If they did they should not have paid it off anyway due to extremely low interest rates - historically speaking). PENTAIR is keeping things very secret for a Publicly Traded Organization which should cause alarm to many.

"Look for a major lawsuit by a big investor. You can blame the weather but you must tell investors that you are weather dependent and the risk that bad weather does to earnings. I have owned Pentair for 30 years and never has the weather been such a negative factor. In fact, the pump business would soar when real bad weather / flooding took out the old pumps. Saying earnings are down because it is cold - is total BS."
