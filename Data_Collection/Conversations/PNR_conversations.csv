"I see most of Pentair commercial business holding steady through the recession and realignment of society in the coming years. I could totally see their pool business falling into unprofitable levels, as vacation homes are less utilized through at least 2022. If it drops to match the lows, then I'll buy more for the dividend, which is rock solid, and wait it out. Also in WTS and MWA. Anyone see reason to be bullish on the pool segment?"

Nice little dividend... I think I'll hang on to PNR for a while... thanks for the cheap shares shorties .... haha!!
I am a customer and a shareholder. My pool had the problems you speak of but my builder foley pools refuses to service a fully paid pentair customer. If the agents won’t show up this is bad for pentair
Wasn’t this about 23 bux AH yest ?
Citron announced two weeks ago to short PLUG when it was over $18 with his target price of $10. Look at the price of PLUG now. It hurt the stock price for no more than a week and the stock shot up over $25 this week.

Finally the bleeding seems to have stopped
PENTAIR will show great margins and slow sales. This is what they have done for the last few years. Look for a modest increase in the Dividend - prior to the split up. All this to keep the stock stable. Ask yourself - Where in the world did the $3.4 Billion go that they got from the sale of the Oil stuff. Nothing has been said about it at all. PENTAIR did not buy anything nor did they have significant debt to pay off (If they did they should not have paid it off anyway due to extremely low interest rates - historically speaking). PENTAIR is keeping things very secret for a Publicly Traded Organization which should cause alarm to many.
"So let me get this straight. Pentair had a .345 Dividend then spins off 1/3 of it company (nVent) and then cuts its dividend in half to .175. Am I the only one on the block to notice this? Also, will nVent announce a dividend? If not, lots of people just lost there rears on this entire spin off. PS - What the hell happened to the $3.1B they got from the sale of the Oil / Gas business."

"There was an interesting article on Simply Wall St. Title: Intrinsic Calculation For Pentair plc (NYSE:PNR) Shows Investors Are Overpaying. After reading it several times, they have a point. I agree that their calculations are good, something around 33.00. However, long term might be a different matter. I don't think this company is going away or it's being mismanaged. It's about timing. It might be a year or two before they show real growth again. That's the question, are they valued correctly today? The short answer is no. But long term.....I see the upside."

Time to buy?
Really 1/2 cent of a increase so they can say they have increased the dividend for so many quarters. This is obviously Stupid. Is PENTAIR in this much trouble? Where did the $3.2 Billion go? Who is thinking that this will do anything but negatively impact the stock?
What happen here...why the big drop...a split?

Why so weak today?
I live in the Dallas area foley pools has no explanation on why they won’t address the warranty repairs. I guess it is a money issue
"The PENTAIR way. Spend 6 months in meetings where you save a nickel that costs a dime. Of course they take out most customer value along the way as well. They come up with all kinds of names for this. We all just sit eat some donuts, groan some and go with the flow. We all hope we can make it to retirement. Sadly, PENTAIR is not the only company who follows this mythical path, most do it now. I feel sorry for those under 40, they are stuck with this idiocy for another 30 years. Me - do what ever to get to retirement and do my best to not care. Caring and telling the truth only gets you fired and demoted. You are called out as not being a ""Team Player"" and not accepting of the new way of doing things."

"Look for lots of acquisitions once PENTAIR gets it $3.2B from the sale of the old Tyco stuff to Emerson that they should have never purchased. Also re-incorporation so the Board and others can cash out their options. To the regular stock holder, maybe a $5 jump in the stock in the first quarter. ever major acquisition that Hogan has done has failed. Just look into the stuff he did in the late 90's. If you want to really tick him off ask him about the TransRack deal or Web."

Pentair closed on the Valves stuff and got $3.1B. They will re-incorporate - paying off stock options for the many and then start buying companies. They will pay off some debt but not that much. Expect a bump before it dives.
bit expensive dividend is too low

Pentair got an offer for the Electrical but Randy wanted more. Now they are spending millions to divided into 2 company's so each can be sold. What a waste. Once split in two neither company can survive on its own and will be consumed by other company's. I am not sure what will happen to the stock but what ever Randy buys usually goes south badly. The dividend will become an issue shortly. The split will devastate it and the stock before and after (the two company's) will get hit bad. Best hope for Stock holders is that Buyers for each company come about before the split - anything else it will get ugly.
"Working for PENTAIR is just like the Slave Hebrews working for the Egyptians. They take away the straw and double the quota. Sadly PENTAIR is not the only company employing this philosophy. Working at PENTAIR means you will be asked to do more with less each and every day. A former Hoffman (PENTAIR Sub) President confided in me before he retired "" I am scared where this all leads to and I did what I could to save as many workers as I could for as long as I could."""

"Look for a major lawsuit by a big investor. You can blame the weather but you must tell investors that you are weather dependent and the risk that bad weather does to earnings. I have owned Pentair for 30 years and never has the weather been such a negative factor. In fact, the pump business would soar when real bad weather / flooding took out the old pumps. Saying earnings are down because it is cold - is total BS."

"So cold weather resulted in lower earnings. This can't be a secret and should have been broadcasted by Pentair to its shareholders. Look for shareholders to sue and they will win. Sure you can't blame the weather but if your sales is dependent on the weather you have to tell people. A good time to buy - Why - Pentair is not big enough to stand alone - look for another much bigger company to act now to buy them up. It would be nice to see the stock push up to $50 or on a deal. Who did this to Pentair - Randy Hogan - everything the guy touched turned into dung. I was there to see all of it and all the stupid acquisitions - Web, Transrack, Enclosures East, Enclosure West, and the huge debacle in buying Tyco Oil and Gas division. Good Job Randy you egocentric idiot. My GOD I tried to talk to you over the years and it was impossible. It was like talking to a statue. All you could do is brag about your cars and art. You are a boring twit incapable of understand working people. Another GE graduate who destroys everything they touch."
