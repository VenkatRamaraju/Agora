How many died in Welltower institution because of virus ?
got lucky with a 24.50$ limit price today.
Long and strong lets hope im right.
Hypothetically speaking if they spent the entire $1 billion on buying back shares they’d save $55 million in dividends from the shares repurchased plus there would be 22 million less shares outstanding meaning every shareholder now owns a larger % of the company. Everyone knows that equity financing is WAY more expensive than debt financing so buying back shares at this low of a price is the highest IRR activity this company could engage in... WELL will benefit greatly from this move.
why us HCN still showing yesterday's close and not opening this morning ??????
$WELL.CA Maintains CIBC World Markets Outperform CAD 11
Where does WELL release their earnings PRs? I don't see anything here or on MSN. I see we are up a little in pre-market so hope it bodes well for earnings.
"August 5, 2020 Analyst News, Financial 0 Comments Welltower (WELL) Gets a Hold Rating from BMO CapitalBy Austin Angelo In a report released today, John Kim from BMO Capital maintained a Hold rating on Welltower (WELL – Research Report), with a price target of $52.00. The company’s shares closed last Wednesday at $53.15."
Stifel raises target price to $83 from $77.
"I thought this was a good investment and put it in my IRA, just hope that was a good move."
Div is safe. Co is strong. May freeze div for 2018. Floor is probably $46-47.
High 30s after dividend cut
I would wait another week before getting back into WELL. I'd love to get more in the $25-30 range. Not going to be any good news pumping the market unless a vaccine is approved or treatment works.
"Wells starts at outperform, price target $94."
"biggest mistake i made was selling this. I sold at the 52 week high, then, which was $76. this has always prospered when the markets took a beating and never went down or plunged when the market was going well. solid stock with not a lot of action, just taking an escalator ride up up up up. on top of it, great dividend."
the average div yield and current yield are very close to inline... unless this really takes off the price is not going up... that will take years and will be over valued.
"$WELL.CA ""$94.3M was satisfied at a deemed price per share of $9.80, which was subject to an adjustment that was inversely proportional to the difference in the 5 day VWAP of WELL’s shares immediately prior to the closing date from the 5 day VWAP immediately prior to the signing of the Agreement (the “Adjustment”).""5-day VWAP prior to signing is approximately $7.125-day VWAP prior to closing is approximately $8.2Based on this, the financing of $94.3M in this acquisition is based on the adjusted PPS of around $11.30""This Adjustment resulted WELL issuing 8,342.947 common shares on the closing date which are subject to certain volume based voluntary resale restrictions as provided in the Agreement.""Had the share price rallied more the past 5 trading days, it would have resulted in less dilution for the existing shareholders to finance the acquisition, but I'd still take this as a positive for $WELL.CA"
"Welltower missed earning by 1 penny.......however, revenue beat expectations. Dividend will be paid, AND Net Operating Income available to shareholders for 2018 has been RAISED from $2.38-$2.48-----to $2.45-2.55. Not a terrible quarter considering the challenging market. I believe the corner has been turned. Good value at this share price. GLTA."
Breaking $80 super soon. Lot of potential 
Most REITS will likely outperform the market going forward with the Gilead news (4/16). Everyone will be paying their rent and interest rates will stay low for the foreseeable future.
"Sold $LVGO and bought $NVDA, $WELL.TO, $OTRK, $MTA, $ZYXI, and $NET"
"Just keep holding and collecting divvys. When vaccines start to roll out in high quantities, things will start getting back to normal in the retirement homes. Occupancies and rates will climb and WELL will return to the old highs later in 2021 IMHO."
"The bet and basic assumption is there will not be any Kirklands in the portfolio. Unfortunately, There is a dilution of experienced onsite management in many of projects as their management companies are focusing on projects they own. This is a fair price based on the uncertainty"
"Worth minimum $8 per share like $WELL .. Maybe $15-30 in 2-3 years, $50-100 in 5 years"
"Back to 90$ for sure, great company"
You knew this one was going to pop to the moon as soon as some good vaccine news came in.
Make sure you are having your broker reinvest the divvies and you’ll ride WELL to new highs and lower average cost for many years to come. Compounding is a beautiful thing.
"Great move yesterday. With the market up significantly in premarket, it looks like it could be another strong day. We will see."
Crazy drop
Still no mention of a dividend raise at the investors' meeting. Disappointing.

"This was the final closing statement from Tom DeRosa CEO of Welltower on the most recent earnings call. The stock at that time was trading at $78......now $46. Something is causing such a large ""disconnect"" and I think it could be more than Coronavirus. Here's the statement.Thomas DeRosa.....Thanks, Tim. So you've heard us repeat the word, optimism throughout our prepared remarks this morning. This is sincere. The green shoots from our core portfolio we saw in late '18 that grew in 2019 are fueling this optimism. Our singular strategy to align with major health systems have been validated and we are mining many interesting investment opportunities that will enable accretive growth and drive shareholder value. We look forward to talking more about this with you throughout the year. Now Liz, please open up the line for questions."
There's a data error in WELL. Please fix it. Thanks.
EPS were double the estimate ($0.37 reported vs $0.18 est) . FFO were healthy too. March quarter FFO guidance is $0.10-$0.15 lower but that may be baked in already.

"from personal experience, The housing and rental market has a lot of pent up demand right now... If some covid19 restrictions ease I belive move in rates will rise in Q3 and as fake news eases the added covid costs should start to wither..."
"Man, I hope you guys & gals are right about WELL because I am still in and routing for the comeback kid. LoL."
"At what age do you guys think baby boomers start to make a real impact on occupancy growth? The oldest baby boomers are turning 72 this year. When they’re turning 80 clearly this will be a thriving industry, but what about the next 2-4 years?"
"Lol @ all these people on the board nervous about the dividend. If you are long on the stock, wouldn't you rather the company cut the dividend and put money back this quarter? The extra cash is beneficial long-term for the stock.Disney completely removed their divi yesterday and saved $1.6 billion. For someone long the stock, how is this a negative?The people that demand a dividend during a deep recession are the type of people that would steal second helpings of food in a survival situation. Cutting the dividend given the circumstances would be okay and understandable this quarter."
This is a link to a COVID19 Vaccine Fact Sheet for long term care facilities that is on the Indiana Dept of Health Web site. We start to move up from here in my opinion.https://www.coronavirus.in.gov/files/LTC%20Vaccine%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf
"WELL, demonstrated proven winner in normal times, impacted negatively in Q2 just like every other company in the healthcare or REIT market. It still pays a great divvy and I will ride this monster back to new highs in the years to come. Cheers. LoL."
This time it will break through its previous high and grow above $10. $WELL.TO!

"There may be some sell on the news in the global markets when the vaccines roll out around the globe. In the meantime, more lockdowns will be reflected in the economic indicators. I think we will see a rotation into companies like WELL since their customers are first on the list to get shots and the first to recover. Hold and collect divvys my friends."
5k on $Well and 20k on $DOC God is good man.Good morning friends
"Currently holding tens of thousands shares of $DOC.V as well as 2,000 shares of WELL. I did however add to my position in WELL today. Both companies represent an incredible growth opportunity which is simply expedited by the now resurgent virus. I chose to add to $WELL.TO because of their huge amount of cash on hand. Some acquisitions should be coming."
"In general, share repurchase means management have strong confidence for the future. Stock price will go up and settle at a new higher level."
"I've been long $WELL for years, and will likely continue to be. But uh....$PEAK is paying a higher dividend and growing much faster (17% compared to WELL's -4.5%) I'll be interested to see how both act coming out of the pandemic, but PEAK looks like the better stock."
"Solid company, long term fundamentals unchanged. Company is reducing its debt exposure, all is positive. Trading at multi-year low, this sell off is way over done.I'm heavily buying at $52/share. It's gone nowhere for now, but I'm holding it out for the sentiment change coming soon my way!"
"Quarterly FFO and revenues in-line, FY 2020 guidance in-line. After hours trading $86.99."
"I advanced my last half year buying to add to a few positions when the market swooned at the end of March (ex: CVS @ $62.21, $65.34 now and soon to add 21M customers while acquiring Aetna) so I don't have a stash to add to WELL but would if I could. Still, I've been making an automatic monthly purchase in my WELL DRIP (no purchase fees, 2% discount on market price for some purchases) at computershare and originally expected that to end after July, but after some research, I'll keep adding at least through December.WELL's FFO (Funds From Operations), a special kind of cash flow measure that is the better way to measure earnings and financial health for REIT's than EPS, was $4.21 for 2017. Yes, WELL's guidance expects it to fall to $3.95 to $4.05 for 2018, but revenues are expected to increase by a couple percent and eventually, assuming it will resume historic growth rates, that will convert to earnings. The fantastic dividend, now at 6.9%, is $3.48 and is NOT threatening to surpass FFO, with the payout ratio (DIV/FFO) being 87%.I don't expect WELL to raise the dividend, but they've only lowered it a couple times since company founding in 1971 and then by only small amounts.According the the Apr. 21, 2018 Morningstar Equity Analyst Report, its ""fair value estimate"" of WELL is $74/share vs the current price of $52.60. It has lowered those for HCP and Ventas but not for WELL. It notes that WELL is ONLY REIT to report projected earnings growth for Senior Housing Operations.Even if inflation returns 10-year bonds to the 4% to 6% typical of the early 2000's, WELL is almost certain to maintain share price so I expect, at worse, to get something like a 6.9% return. Speaking of 6%, that's the avg. annual increase in the WELL stock price in the 2000's. If HALF of the continues, then we're close to a 10% avg. annual return, and it could be higher.Not bad for a relatively safe stock!"
Been out of pocket all day till now. So they did reduce dividend?
"Common thinking is rotate out of REIT's into growth because rates are rising. That is driving this, but the thinking isn't really looking at history or the reality of how rising rates and a stronger economy effect REIT's. This has some good thoughts on how rising rates effect REIT's.https://www.reit.com/news/blog/market-commentary/how-do-market-interest-rates-affect-reit-returns"
Why is the price dropping so much? Should I be worried ?

This is an amazing buying opportunity. I will be gobbling this thing up
It's time to buy. Mark this post.
The older people in nursing homes will soon get the vaccine and this one will go back to 90 plus.
Remember It didn’t took $Well long time to reach 9 bucks.Be patience.
"Don’t overcomplicate. Given the choice between 15% return and 6% return, anyone with a single firing synapse takes the 15% regardless of how “solid” the company returning 6% is. When 6% is again competitive they will come back, question is when."
I love reinvesting dividends through my broker. No fees and shares just keep piling up. Go WELL.
"JPMorgan analyst Michael W. Mueller upgraded Welltower, Inc. (NYSE: WELL) from Neutral to Overweight with a price target of $71.00.The analyst comments ""We are upgrading our rating on WELL to Overweight, as we are becoming more positive on some stocks that have faced greater COVID-19 headwinds. While we still expect messaging on the 4Q call to be cautious as it relates to real-time senior housing fundamentals, we do believe the business will ultimately stabilize sometime in 2021 and begin to turn the corner (for a slow recovery). Equally important, WELL has amassed significant dry powder from dispositions, and we expect capital deployment to ramp up a lot in 2021, setting the stage for earnings to begin to turn the corner."""
"Interesting article on Seeking Alpha. They have WELL going to $100/share and the dividend back to the pre-pandemic $0.87/share based on the following:SummaryWelltower is well positioned for the conclusion of the Pandemic.We anticipate that most senior citizens will be vaccinated by the end of the second quarter, enabling many to move into the company's high quality properties.A return to pre-Pandemic occupancy rates should move the stock price considerably higher.As the occupancy rates recover, we would expect to see the dividend also recover to its pre-Pandemic levels."
"Once the private placement offering at $2.7 is completed & current Teslamania is calmed, the next support will be $3.25. With uplisting, the SP of CloudMD will be above $5 and then racing to catch up with $WELL. Just my opinion...."

"HCN is a total dividend purchase. It is in competition with brokered CDs. Recently brokered CDs have been trending upward and CDs are FDIC guaranteed. The price of HCN will always react in the opposite direction of brokered CDs. HCN will not lower its dividend rate, because the price would plummet in exact proportion."
"This just goes to show you that stocks do not trade on fundamentals. The shorts control the stock market. they do more selling high.......than later buying low to cover, just the opposite of most investors. I never sold a single share of my WELL. But who would think that it would have jumped 30% in one hour due to positive vaccine news. Wish I had doubled down."
"The over 85 age group, the bread and butter of this company, is expected to double over the next 20 years"
It's the same story again... When $WELL was around a Dollar I remember the same happened. I kept my shares and now it's close enough to $9. Doing the same for $CBDT. Likely my last day looking at this forum or typing any messages. See you all next year or even this year when this hits $10. Until then GLTA. God Bless!
HCP is also down huge today. Is there something terrible going on that I'm not aware of?
this is not normal
"We are fired up about our newly appointed Chief People Officer, @SabatinoShane! Shane is a dynamic, inspiring and heart-centered people & culture leader. He is joining $WELL.to at a time of tremendous growth and will be an invaluable partner to myself and the entire team"
Its like a Zombie real estate investment trust. It caters to senior healthcare mgt. like Nursing homes etc. but the problem is collecting rent from the deadbeats and they cant force out all these seniors in wheelchairs. Also the new tax laws may have a devastating effect of medicaid and medicare payments to these healthcare facilities.
Support in the $78+ range pre-COVID is in sight friends. Then it's back up to the $90 range later this year.
I'm in the money now boyssss
I think the symbol has changed to WELL
$TDOC dipped today since Amazon has announced they will most likely push into the Telehealth space. This increases the chance of $DOCRF and $DOC.V or $WELL.TO getting acquired because we all know Amazon does not grow organically. I’ll be buying any dips sub $2.10. This thing will eventually fly like a SpaceX rocket ..... but hopefully it won’t land like one lol.
"Had my eye on welltower for a while, one of my favorite long term plays for demographic transition. Started a position today, think this pullback is a fantastic opportunity. Plan on averaging down as long as it drops"
I agree that this data merger is important to display.Yahoo Finance! Please merge WELL’s chart data with HCN! Welltower changed their symbol from HCN to WELL for quite some time now! Thanks
Wonder what this company is worth (share price) if you buy the company and sell off the assets individually? Just asking.
"We’ve been at these levels before - and when we were, HCN was a smaller company paying a smaller divi. At these prices, this is an amazing opportunity to get into growing company with a 6% stable return."
Do you guys think $DOC should partner with $JNH ? $WELL just did
"This is an over reaction to the 10 yr bond which has gone above $2.50 in the last 2 weeks. all REITS are taking a hit. This is exactly what happens in bull market when so many with no knowledge or experience in the market have beed drawn in by supposed riches. HCN remains the same great company it was a month, or a year ago. To me it is a buying opportunity and I have been slowly adding the last few days"
"i like the price here, i think the interest rates rising to 4 times in 2018 has been factored in."
Goldman Sachs raises price target to $86 from $79.
I think the lock downs of the retirement communities has righted the ship for WELL and other companies like it. This is a long term play that will pay attractive divvies all along the way.
I suspect the trend is positive. The worst of the pandemic is behind us and assisted living will continue to improve.
"I bought more 63.84 today, as this was an over reaction to 2 things. The medicare/medicaid scare where HCN gets less than 10% of their income from those sources, having moved away from them over the past 4 yrs. The interest rate increase hysteria as it has been factored in all year, simply look at the charts since rate increases started. HCN has done well over the years in any rate factoring in."
"Looking at the chart, I think we break through short-term resistance and past the $64 resistance in the next month."
Lot of bad news about nursing homes lately
EPS attributable to shareholders was $0.77/share. FFO was $0.84/share. Estimate was $0.15/share. That's a HUGE beat.
Selling $450 Million in 4.5% unsecured notes as opposed to issuing new stock with a 6.6% dividend saves the company over $12 Million in cash flow annually!
"4th time beating earnings by some good margin.Very predictable ticker. The company leads in this particular sector and has been around for a long time. It's been held down because of the atmosphere.Safe bet for longs. If you think about it, there are so many companies out there with 60-70% revenue loss for the Q1 & Q2 at levels way above where they should be.This one's sitting at a relatively low level if you think about its business which is not getting any huge blows from covid."
"Who DOES NOT believe that the assisted living industry will get back to normal in this country? I'm here to tell you, Americans still do not want or have the willpower to take care of their parents/grandparents. They will shove them into assisted living to get on with their lives and will be very happy with Medicare picking up the tab. On top of that, the richest segment of the population is the 55 and older. They can afford WELL prices."
Interested in this income stock. What are the chances of a cut in dividend?
is the nursing home in Washington run by Well?
The revenue is rising Y-to-Y but the EPS is declining. Investors are into accelerating growth stocks now rather negative growth stocks. Is that the reason for the selling?

Owner of $Well with 8k and $DOC with 30k shares. Keep buying my good people. Best investment I ever made.
"Welltower just posted a ""Business Update"" as of March 31, 2020. From my understanding of the recent actions they have taken, they are in a VERY STRONG financial position. I like when management comes out to give an update when they feel the market is ""unduly "" punishing the company and its shares. Adding shares here."
"New proud shareholder of $WELL. Great company, and great environment for growth with the aging population."
How does YAHOO show dividend at 6.45%. $3.48 annual dividend divided by stock price of $63.11 results in a rate of 5.5%. What am I missing?
"What we are seeing right now is a rotation towards stocks signaling the end of Covid combined with a sell off in big tech stocks, this has been pulling down teledoc and telehealth generally. Of course we all know telehealth is here to stay and it will be a market that expands like no other (certainly more than the sectors that are hot right now - like cruise lines?...pff) and i think the most important take away is the WELL did better than any other comparable telehealth stock (and least the ones people pretend are comparable to well). Either way pay no heed to that price action all it means is a buying opportunity. #well #theperfecthedge #well fam"
X-Div on Tuesday 5/8. Need to own it on Monday to get your $0.87/sh.
"For those bemoaning the severe price drop over the past 8 months, note that the fundamentals have not suffered, note that 90% of the nursing home patients in WELL-owned buildings are privately insured - insulating them from government actions, and that healthcare REITs have a much steadier record than other REITs during corrections of interest-rate moves, yet they suffer through guilt-by-association.I'm in WELL's (changed from HCN yesterday) official DRIP (actually a DSPP where you can buy your first shares), run by Computershare, where there are no fees for purchases or reinvested dividends and you usually get the shares at a 2% discount to the market price.Several months ago, I re-started my automatic monthly investments in WELL (HCN) and plan to keep accumulating cheap shares for at least all of 2018."
@CBS....definitely NOT cutting the dividend. Just look at all the recent moves they made to increase their liquidity and strengthen the balance sheet.
"Bought this and $WELL.to last week at their high, down more than 10% on both of them today after averaging down. Im supeeer bullish on tellehealth sector and im holding for years, I would just like some second thoughts on wether these 2 stocks are the strong ones in this sector"
"Reminder----BMO downgraded WELL on 1/8/2021. The price at that time was $62.60. We are now (2/19) 10% higher . I'll repeat my favorite saying. NEVER trust the analyst!! In many cases they are a good ""contrary indicator"". GLTA"
"Analyst target at $60. -It’s a 100% eps beat. -continuous occupancy trend improvement-strategic partnerships-strong financials -near 100% rent collection-a lot of room upside(share price for the yr)-industry that isn’t going anywhere, in fact it will continue to grow with government backing -instant pump due with vaccines -dividend"
"The time is right now to buy. All other investors think tech stocks will go up forever, even anything to do with crypto, same thing. This is the largest healthcare REIT in the world, valued at under $22B. You get almost a 6% yield to buy and hold. The future for this stock looks extremely stable and promising, with essentially guaranteed income. Do not sell, buy and hold, right now. In 5 years, you will be very happy."
"Sold covered calls, 2 June $75s for $1.50, 1 June $77.50 for $1.13."
Dividend cut coming. Cannot afford the payout. Most analysts think at least .75 per share. 38 next target
"At this rate, it will be $20 in a few months."
Many hi div stocks are really trading like bonds in todays market. WELL has reached a price point where there are better int rates available. Look at hi divs as you would bond etfs.
Selling $450 Million in 10 year unsecured notes at 4.5% rather than a new stock issue was smart. Dividends are 6.6% at current price which saves the company over $12 Million in annual cash flow!
"WELL, VTR, PEAK, have very little risk considering anyone who cares about actual data knows that daily CV-19 deaths are continuing to grind lower every day. The recent ""spike"" in CV-19 cases isn't an alarm - why? B/c the CDC admitted that the Common Cold Virus which is a Conroavirus creates false positives in CV-19 case loads.... the only number you should be watching is daily deaths, everything else is just noise. So remember, although cases might be spiking, I suspect quite a few are common cold cases that are causing false positives - but common cold doesn't lead to death, which is why daily death counts continue lower.If you had the understanding of data that I did - WELL would be $65 a share right now. It is severely underpriced atm... gives you time to buy. GLTA."
"The question is, was yesterday's move because of the overall market or as a result of the NAREIT 2020 conference presentation? Probably both but hopefully tuts will begin taking big positions in WELL and keep us moving up."
When will the Dividend be announced? I thought it would be in January based on past years.

Why is absolutely no one talking about the huge benefit REIT investors got from tax reform? Investors in the top tax bracket will see the tax rate on dividends drop from 39.6% to 29.6%. After tax income from REITs just went up 17%!
I have no idea what to expect today but I feel good about many years of growth in revenues.
"If I did my math right, in 2006 when 10 year Treasury yields were 5.1%, HCN Yielded 6.3%. Today 10 year rates are 2.55% and expected to go to 3.5 to 4% (maybe). And every investor is treating REITs like the plague and HCN is now yielding almost 6%. Pretty close to the same yield it had when rates were a lot higher. At some point this will become clear that the selling in REITs is an over reaction."
"They are getting COVID reimbursements from the CARES Act finally. That's good news. Plus, wasn't it 80% or more of communities are open to new residents? With wide spread vaccinations across the country, I think this past quarter is the bottom and residents start increasing from here."
"Follow me here. AirBnB announced that they are nearing pre-COVID reservations now. If people are willing to stay in other people's homes around the country, then they will feel safe to put mom and dad in the assisted living that WELL offers. Canary in the coal mine my friends."
shades of $well
Does anyone know when the ex-dividend and dividend date is for this quarter? It is not updated on yahoo finance.
"Unbelievable that on March 18, 2020 you could buy WELL at $25/share and more than double your money in less than a month. CRAZY MARKET."
"In case some of you were wondering why this stock keeps going down consider this. MANY MANY funds and fund managers play the interest rate cycle game. That means they sell REITs and Utilities ""INDISCRIMINATELY"" as rates rise. they are sold thru options, ETF's and the like. It doesn't have anything to do with company fundamentals. That said......here's how it works for HCN. HCN has very good debt coverage per their debt/equity ratio. However, approximately 30% of their debt comes due from 2018-2023. That debt has to be refinanced at higher interest rates, that reduces profit for the company. All this is assuming that equity is not issued and also that occupancy rates and income is ""unchanged"". Watch for the week of February 18-25, thats when most of the REITS report earnings and provide future guidance. FWIW.....I think REITS will recover somewhat on positive earnings reports. Just got to have some patience here, ......good luck all."
"Cutting the divi, and putting the money saved back into share repurchases. All these companies that have taken a hit due to this outbreak and pay a dividend should be doing it. Companies should be buying back shares at their lows...unless you are the airlines, in which case you buy shares at their highs and then ask for a bailout when the price tanks."
So now the yield should be 5.3 percent. I think I can live with that until next quarter. Buying on tomorrow’s dip. How low can it go?
Jefferies cuts target price to $77 from $82.
Who here doesn't think baby boomers aren't going to be moving into assisted living in droves over the next 20 years. WELL has a 50-billion dollar runway that will make shareholders a lot of money over those years.
"Overvalued, nice chart for the last 5 months. Should be in the mid 70’s. Good company and future. Just sold today, buy back in low 70’s"
"Added today....this will be one of the huge winners in the post-COVID world. Their last earnings looked fabulous, and not near as many residents are leaving as one would expect during this pandemic. On top of that, I love the cut to the divi and using that saved cash to buy back stock....i've always thought that was genius during times like these."
BMO price target now $100.
Way overvalued. Seeking yield I guess. When this dropped to the 50’s everyone had a sell.
I sold 3 Dec $105 covered calls for $1.10.
"Business update released today: month-to-date occupancy has dropped an additional 85 bps in January; margins will continue to deteriorate in Q1 due to occupancy losses, COVID expenses, and seasonal factors."
Normalized FFO $.80 vs. $.65 expected. Revenue $1.05B vs. $1.07 predicted.

Baird upgrades to OUTPERFORM on 1/6/20......BMO downgrades to HOLD on 1/8/20. Don't trust the analyst .
"If CloudMD closes above the 4th resistances of $2.33, next week it will be in the free float area to catch up with its ATH of mid February. Here it comes $WELL."
"@Daniel Schmidt....It's really simple, you think the next price target is 38. So you are either short or do not own any shares. Meanwhile no one seems to remember the fact that the CEO said the dividend was safe for 2018 in the last earnings conference call. Those who invest ""solely"" on what the get from Yahoo message boards deserve to lose their money. Try reading transcripts, and analyzing balance sheets and income statements and everyone would be better informed."
got me some $SPG for the dividend and some welltower
"”Shares of Welltower have declined 28.3% compared with the industry’s loss of 7.1% over the past year. Further, the trend in estimate revision of 2021 FFO per share does not indicate a favorable outlook for the company as estimates have moved 1.5% south over the past week. Therefore, given the above-mentioned concerns and downward estimate revision, there is a limited upside potential to the stock.”"
In 2013 it stayed on the bottom for about a month.......in the beginning of 2016 stayed on the bottom about 10 days......patience
9/16 - Jefferies raises target price to $82 from $78.
If you own this stock and really want some answers.......get on the earnings conference call in about 2 weeks and ask away. Asking people on the Yahoo message boards is not really the best source of information.....even from me (although I try).
"Boy, the down today is rather a surprise with the market generally stable. Don't get it."
"In general, cut dividend means management have no confidence for the future. Stock price will go down and settle at a new lower level."

"I've lost more than 20% on this already. Here's my dilemma. As soon as I sell, it will start going up! But really, this is totally ridiculous, I can see this stock holding steady, but these precipitous losses are quite exaggerated. When will management and the board say something... anything???"

"Welltower is, demographically and financially, well positioned. However, there will almost certainly be coronavirus outbreaks in their facilities, and I wonder if that concern may be playing into the recent stock price decline."
Merrill lynch 35 price target with more dividend cuts.
"ClaudeMD passed 2 of the 4 resistances since its ATH of Feb. Gradually passing the 2.25 and then the 2.35, it will be catching up with its ATH. Remember that the private placement was at $2.75. $WELL will soon have its CAD counterpart once DOC.V is up listed in TSX."
article states they barely beat expectations...but year over year below 1 year ago
Own these 4 $tdoc $doc.v $amwl and $well.to future of healthcare
Going down more?
"Buy, hold, forget."
"Good news this morning. Maybe, just maybe, this does the trick to break $80."
Who believes WELL will get back into the $85 range in the next year or two? I do. Did you see they are retiring higher interest debt with newly issued debt at historically low rates
Might see new 52 week lows soon!
Stanford is saying covid death rate it looking more like .01 .02.... lowering the fatality rate drastically.
Computers driven by algorythms that kick in when the yield on the 10 year spikes. All interest sensitive publicly traded instruments get sold only to be bought later by true investors.
$QCP is worth $27 post HCR bankruptcy. $WELL is trying to steal it from shareholders at $20.75 based on numbers where QCP did everything right and just didn’t get paid what they were owed. Bad business if shareholders allow this to happen!
"Wow......did you see that latest company press release. Some details1. Financed a new $1B in notes that will be used to pay off high interest debt....nice move2. WELL still has a forward sales agreement to sell 6.8 million shares at a price of $86.48 (not sure to who). This will add $588M to the balance sheet which is already quite strong. Forward stock sales agreement must happen by 12/31/20.3. Continuing the sales of non core assets to upgrade the portfolio.This company is making ALL the right financial moves. When we clear the virus, this stock goes back into the $80's. In the meantime the generous dividend is VERY safe."
freight train this is
Raymond James raises price target to $98 from $95.
interesting to see what will happen but if it gets back to the 30s I'll add more
Just a matter of time now till this one takes off--vaccines starting to run smoothly in retirement areas and rent collection is far beyond expectations. Hidden little gem right here!!!
Going down more today after not too great Qtr results. Buy back in low 60's.
77 per share to $52 in 8 months???? Wow!!
"It will wallow around down here a little bit....the buyers will get in....the sellers will get out.....and then the people who know HCN's ""Cycle"" will start loading up......."

"Ok, ok. Let's just hope for only a 1% drop every single day for all of 2018. It would better than what we have been experiencing thus far. I am so curious to see how low we can go on zero news."
"For those of us that take some profits when markets hit all-time highs know that keeping powder dry let's us take advantage of these historic market drops. Don't ever be 100% invested in stock, you don't know when a black swan event will happen and you get pummeled. WELL will continue to grow for the next 10 - 20 years. Hold this jewel."
Are we finally going to breakthrough into the $80s?
why the bump in WELL after hours tonight?
Best Management Team in the business. Either trust them or sell your shares.
buy this one on the way down. when the market corrects ( and it will) investors will be running for dividend shelters .
soooo who wants to guess when the stock will get back to the upper trend line and when do you think it might breach 100
HCN recent selloff low in at $63.26 should hold unless 10 year goes above 2.50
what price WellTower this time next year?
"Oh lovely, down another 3.2% for no reason. Let's just fall to $10 already so I can buy some and get a >30% yield."
"This is from a recent article from Morningstar.First, we like the big three healthcare REITS: HCP, Ventas, and Welltower. All three are currently providing dividend yields in the mid-5s and are trading below our fair value estimates for the companies. Dividends for all three companies are well covered by current cash flows, they have an established history of raising their dividend each year, and even during the uncertainty of the great financial crisis they maintained or raised their dividend. The healthcare REITs have traded off in 2018 due to supply issues impacting senior housing operations in the short term, but there is evidence that supply is decreasing, and we expect there to be a significant demand wave positively impacting the sector over the next decade. We believe these companies will outperform as this supply-demand imbalance corrects. Of these names, we like Welltower the best."
they've been in business since 1970.......I'll average down this afternoon as people sell before the wknd.
Yahoo Finance! Please merge WELL’s chart data with HCN! Welltower changed their symbol from HCN to WELL for quite some time now! Thanks
Stock has been going down because of no dividend increase.

"With cash on hand plus the forward sales agreement, WELL is looking at $750M on hand. I hate to say it, but if the COVID-19 outbreak is longer-lived, they will blow through $750M with the snap of a finger. Out of a ~$31B of assets, that low amount of free cash flow is concerning. The credit expansion they announced is great, but dipping into that would still be worrisome.Am I crazy to think the dividend is not sustainable given the drop in share price and low amount of cash? I'd bet on it dropping if this outbreak lasts longer than this quarter.I am buying shares to average down, but this huge drop was about more than just the COVID-19 scare, i'm afraid."
