"JPMorgan analyst Michael W. Mueller upgraded Welltower, Inc. (NYSE: WELL) from Neutral to Overweight with a price target of $71.00.The analyst comments ""We are upgrading our rating on WELL to Overweight, as we are becoming more positive on some stocks that have faced greater COVID-19 headwinds. While we still expect messaging on the 4Q call to be cautious as it relates to real-time senior housing fundamentals, we do believe the business will ultimately stabilize sometime in 2021 and begin to turn the corner (for a slow recovery). Equally important, WELL has amassed significant dry powder from dispositions, and we expect capital deployment to ramp up a lot in 2021, setting the stage for earnings to begin to turn the corner."""
Raymond James raises price target to $98 from $95.
"Welltower just posted a ""Business Update"" as of March 31, 2020. From my understanding of the recent actions they have taken, they are in a VERY STRONG financial position. I like when management comes out to give an update when they feel the market is ""unduly "" punishing the company and its shares. Adding shares here."
"The over 85 age group, the bread and butter of this company, is expected to double over the next 20 years"
Many hi div stocks are really trading like bonds in todays market. WELL has reached a price point where there are better int rates available. Look at hi divs as you would bond etfs.
"Currently holding tens of thousands shares of $DOC.V as well as 2,000 shares of WELL. I did however add to my position in WELL today. Both companies represent an incredible growth opportunity which is simply expedited by the now resurgent virus. I chose to add to $WELL.TO because of their huge amount of cash on hand. Some acquisitions should be coming."

"Analyst target at $60. -It’s a 100% eps beat. -continuous occupancy trend improvement-strategic partnerships-strong financials -near 100% rent collection-a lot of room upside(share price for the yr)-industry that isn’t going anywhere, in fact it will continue to grow with government backing -instant pump due with vaccines -dividend"
Tripled on $WELL & Doubled on $DOC. God is good. What a year 
"biggest mistake i made was selling this. I sold at the 52 week high, then, which was $76. this has always prospered when the markets took a beating and never went down or plunged when the market was going well. solid stock with not a lot of action, just taking an escalator ride up up up up. on top of it, great dividend."
"Wow......did you see that latest company press release. Some details1. Financed a new $1B in notes that will be used to pay off high interest debt....nice move2. WELL still has a forward sales agreement to sell 6.8 million shares at a price of $86.48 (not sure to who). This will add $588M to the balance sheet which is already quite strong. Forward stock sales agreement must happen by 12/31/20.3. Continuing the sales of non core assets to upgrade the portfolio.This company is making ALL the right financial moves. When we clear the virus, this stock goes back into the $80's. In the meantime the generous dividend is VERY safe."
Why is absolutely no one talking about the huge benefit REIT investors got from tax reform? Investors in the top tax bracket will see the tax rate on dividends drop from 39.6% to 29.6%. After tax income from REITs just went up 17%!
Owner of $Well with 8k and $DOC with 30k shares. Keep buying my good people. Best investment I ever made.
I currently own 9k units of shares. Hope the price can wait for me to fill up my wife's TFSA as well - About 4k units of shares. #WELL
Jefferies cuts target price to $77 from $82.
This time it will break through its previous high and grow above $10. $WELL.TO!
It's the same story again... When $WELL was around a Dollar I remember the same happened. I kept my shares and now it's close enough to $9. Doing the same for $CBDT. Likely my last day looking at this forum or typing any messages. See you all next year or even this year when this hits $10. Until then GLTA. God Bless!
"Question for the forum -- With the size, scale, and network effects of big players in this space like $TDOC, will $Doc and $Well be able to compete? Will Canadian provinces opt for a made-in-Canada option? Are there any data privacy or other issues that would require Canadian provinces to use Canadian companies? Inter-operability across platforms sounds great, but can't the big players create walled gardens, and break any inter-operability to get clients to switch to them?"
Scotiabank cuts target price to $82 from $85.
Who believes WELL will get back into the $85 range in the next year or two? I do. Did you see they are retiring higher interest debt with newly issued debt at historically low rates
