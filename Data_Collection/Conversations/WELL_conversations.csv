"I advanced my last half year buying to add to a few positions when the market swooned at the end of March (ex: CVS @ $62.21, $65.34 now and soon to add 21M customers while acquiring Aetna) so I don't have a stash to add to WELL but would if I could. Still, I've been making an automatic monthly purchase in my WELL DRIP (no purchase fees, 2% discount on market price for some purchases) at computershare and originally expected that to end after July, but after some research, I'll keep adding at least through December.WELL's FFO (Funds From Operations), a special kind of cash flow measure that is the better way to measure earnings and financial health for REIT's than EPS, was $4.21 for 2017. Yes, WELL's guidance expects it to fall to $3.95 to $4.05 for 2018, but revenues are expected to increase by a couple percent and eventually, assuming it will resume historic growth rates, that will convert to earnings. The fantastic dividend, now at 6.9%, is $3.48 and is NOT threatening to surpass FFO, with the payout ratio (DIV/FFO) being 87%.I don't expect WELL to raise the dividend, but they've only lowered it a couple times since company founding in 1971 and then by only small amounts.According the the Apr. 21, 2018 Morningstar Equity Analyst Report, its ""fair value estimate"" of WELL is $74/share vs the current price of $52.60. It has lowered those for HCP and Ventas but not for WELL. It notes that WELL is ONLY REIT to report projected earnings growth for Senior Housing Operations.Even if inflation returns 10-year bonds to the 4% to 6% typical of the early 2000's, WELL is almost certain to maintain share price so I expect, at worse, to get something like a 6.9% return. Speaking of 6%, that's the avg. annual increase in the WELL stock price in the 2000's. If HALF of the continues, then we're close to a 10% avg. annual return, and it could be higher.Not bad for a relatively safe stock!"
I agree that this data merger is important to display.Yahoo Finance! Please merge WELL’s chart data with HCN! Welltower changed their symbol from HCN to WELL for quite some time now! Thanks
"With cash on hand plus the forward sales agreement, WELL is looking at $750M on hand. I hate to say it, but if the COVID-19 outbreak is longer-lived, they will blow through $750M with the snap of a finger. Out of a ~$31B of assets, that low amount of free cash flow is concerning. The credit expansion they announced is great, but dipping into that would still be worrisome.Am I crazy to think the dividend is not sustainable given the drop in share price and low amount of cash? I'd bet on it dropping if this outbreak lasts longer than this quarter.I am buying shares to average down, but this huge drop was about more than just the COVID-19 scare, i'm afraid."
why us HCN still showing yesterday's close and not opening this morning ??????
5k on $Well and 20k on $DOC God is good man.Good morning friends
https://welltower.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2Q20-Earnings-Deck_vf-8.5.20-v3.pdfBusiness Update.I mentioned that it is a safe bet for long.It turns out to be an awesome invesment for long.
Just a matter of time now till this one takes off--vaccines starting to run smoothly in retirement areas and rent collection is far beyond expectations. Hidden little gem right here!!!
"Interesting article on Seeking Alpha. They have WELL going to $100/share and the dividend back to the pre-pandemic $0.87/share based on the following:SummaryWelltower is well positioned for the conclusion of the Pandemic.We anticipate that most senior citizens will be vaccinated by the end of the second quarter, enabling many to move into the company's high quality properties.A return to pre-Pandemic occupancy rates should move the stock price considerably higher.As the occupancy rates recover, we would expect to see the dividend also recover to its pre-Pandemic levels."
HCN recent selloff low in at $63.26 should hold unless 10 year goes above 2.50
This time it will break through its previous high and grow above $10. $WELL.TO!
It's the same story again... When $WELL was around a Dollar I remember the same happened. I kept my shares and now it's close enough to $9. Doing the same for $CBDT. Likely my last day looking at this forum or typing any messages. See you all next year or even this year when this hits $10. Until then GLTA. God Bless!
Been out of pocket all day till now. So they did reduce dividend?
"Solid company, long term fundamentals unchanged. Company is reducing its debt exposure, all is positive. Trading at multi-year low, this sell off is way over done.I'm heavily buying at $52/share. It's gone nowhere for now, but I'm holding it out for the sentiment change coming soon my way!"
"I thought this was a good investment and put it in my IRA, just hope that was a good move."
Computers driven by algorythms that kick in when the yield on the 10 year spikes. All interest sensitive publicly traded instruments get sold only to be bought later by true investors.
they've been in business since 1970.......I'll average down this afternoon as people sell before the wknd.
Tripled on $WELL & Doubled on $DOC. God is good. What a year 
"Follow me here. AirBnB announced that they are nearing pre-COVID reservations now. If people are willing to stay in other people's homes around the country, then they will feel safe to put mom and dad in the assisted living that WELL offers. Canary in the coal mine my friends."

"HCN is a total dividend purchase. It is in competition with brokered CDs. Recently brokered CDs have been trending upward and CDs are FDIC guaranteed. The price of HCN will always react in the opposite direction of brokered CDs. HCN will not lower its dividend rate, because the price would plummet in exact proportion."
"WELL, VTR, PEAK, have very little risk considering anyone who cares about actual data knows that daily CV-19 deaths are continuing to grind lower every day. The recent ""spike"" in CV-19 cases isn't an alarm - why? B/c the CDC admitted that the Common Cold Virus which is a Conroavirus creates false positives in CV-19 case loads.... the only number you should be watching is daily deaths, everything else is just noise. So remember, although cases might be spiking, I suspect quite a few are common cold cases that are causing false positives - but common cold doesn't lead to death, which is why daily death counts continue lower.If you had the understanding of data that I did - WELL would be $65 a share right now. It is severely underpriced atm... gives you time to buy. GLTA."

"I've lost more than 20% on this already. Here's my dilemma. As soon as I sell, it will start going up! But really, this is totally ridiculous, I can see this stock holding steady, but these precipitous losses are quite exaggerated. When will management and the board say something... anything???"
Owner of $Well with 8k and $DOC with 30k shares. Keep buying my good people. Best investment I ever made.
"New proud shareholder of $WELL. Great company, and great environment for growth with the aging population."
"Wow......did you see that latest company press release. Some details1. Financed a new $1B in notes that will be used to pay off high interest debt....nice move2. WELL still has a forward sales agreement to sell 6.8 million shares at a price of $86.48 (not sure to who). This will add $588M to the balance sheet which is already quite strong. Forward stock sales agreement must happen by 12/31/20.3. Continuing the sales of non core assets to upgrade the portfolio.This company is making ALL the right financial moves. When we clear the virus, this stock goes back into the $80's. In the meantime the generous dividend is VERY safe."
Most REITS will likely outperform the market going forward with the Gilead news (4/16). Everyone will be paying their rent and interest rates will stay low for the foreseeable future.
"biggest mistake i made was selling this. I sold at the 52 week high, then, which was $76. this has always prospered when the markets took a beating and never went down or plunged when the market was going well. solid stock with not a lot of action, just taking an escalator ride up up up up. on top of it, great dividend."

"For those of us that take some profits when markets hit all-time highs know that keeping powder dry let's us take advantage of these historic market drops. Don't ever be 100% invested in stock, you don't know when a black swan event will happen and you get pummeled. WELL will continue to grow for the next 10 - 20 years. Hold this jewel."
This is an amazing buying opportunity. I will be gobbling this thing up
You knew this one was going to pop to the moon as soon as some good vaccine news came in.
"This just goes to show you that stocks do not trade on fundamentals. The shorts control the stock market. they do more selling high.......than later buying low to cover, just the opposite of most investors. I never sold a single share of my WELL. But who would think that it would have jumped 30% in one hour due to positive vaccine news. Wish I had doubled down."
Stock has been going down because of no dividend increase.
I have no idea what to expect today but I feel good about many years of growth in revenues.

Many hi div stocks are really trading like bonds in todays market. WELL has reached a price point where there are better int rates available. Look at hi divs as you would bond etfs.
Make sure you are having your broker reinvest the divvies and you’ll ride WELL to new highs and lower average cost for many years to come. Compounding is a beautiful thing.

"What we are seeing right now is a rotation towards stocks signaling the end of Covid combined with a sell off in big tech stocks, this has been pulling down teledoc and telehealth generally. Of course we all know telehealth is here to stay and it will be a market that expands like no other (certainly more than the sectors that are hot right now - like cruise lines?...pff) and i think the most important take away is the WELL did better than any other comparable telehealth stock (and least the ones people pretend are comparable to well). Either way pay no heed to that price action all it means is a buying opportunity. #well #theperfecthedge #well fam"
"The time is right now to buy. All other investors think tech stocks will go up forever, even anything to do with crypto, same thing. This is the largest healthcare REIT in the world, valued at under $22B. You get almost a 6% yield to buy and hold. The future for this stock looks extremely stable and promising, with essentially guaranteed income. Do not sell, buy and hold, right now. In 5 years, you will be very happy."

Who here doesn't think baby boomers aren't going to be moving into assisted living in droves over the next 20 years. WELL has a 50-billion dollar runway that will make shareholders a lot of money over those years.
"4th time beating earnings by some good margin.Very predictable ticker. The company leads in this particular sector and has been around for a long time. It's been held down because of the atmosphere.Safe bet for longs. If you think about it, there are so many companies out there with 60-70% revenue loss for the Q1 & Q2 at levels way above where they should be.This one's sitting at a relatively low level if you think about its business which is not getting any huge blows from covid."

buy this one on the way down. when the market corrects ( and it will) investors will be running for dividend shelters .
I currently own 9k units of shares. Hope the price can wait for me to fill up my wife's TFSA as well - About 4k units of shares. #WELL
Who believes WELL will get back into the $85 range in the next year or two? I do. Did you see they are retiring higher interest debt with newly issued debt at historically low rates
Scotiabank cuts target price to $82 from $85.

Does anyone know when the ex-dividend and dividend date is for this quarter? It is not updated on yahoo finance.
"Cutting the divi, and putting the money saved back into share repurchases. All these companies that have taken a hit due to this outbreak and pay a dividend should be doing it. Companies should be buying back shares at their lows...unless you are the airlines, in which case you buy shares at their highs and then ask for a bailout when the price tanks."
"Had my eye on welltower for a while, one of my favorite long term plays for demographic transition. Started a position today, think this pullback is a fantastic opportunity. Plan on averaging down as long as it drops"
Hypothetically speaking if they spent the entire $1 billion on buying back shares they’d save $55 million in dividends from the shares repurchased plus there would be 22 million less shares outstanding meaning every shareholder now owns a larger % of the company. Everyone knows that equity financing is WAY more expensive than debt financing so buying back shares at this low of a price is the highest IRR activity this company could engage in... WELL will benefit greatly from this move.
"Added today....this will be one of the huge winners in the post-COVID world. Their last earnings looked fabulous, and not near as many residents are leaving as one would expect during this pandemic. On top of that, I love the cut to the divi and using that saved cash to buy back stock....i've always thought that was genius during times like these."
I love reinvesting dividends through my broker. No fees and shares just keep piling up. Go WELL.
"Just keep holding and collecting divvys. When vaccines start to roll out in high quantities, things will start getting back to normal in the retirement homes. Occupancies and rates will climb and WELL will return to the old highs later in 2021 IMHO."
Best Management Team in the business. Either trust them or sell your shares.

"ClaudeMD passed 2 of the 4 resistances since its ATH of Feb. Gradually passing the 2.25 and then the 2.35, it will be catching up with its ATH. Remember that the private placement was at $2.75. $WELL will soon have its CAD counterpart once DOC.V is up listed in TSX."
$QCP is worth $27 post HCR bankruptcy. $WELL is trying to steal it from shareholders at $20.75 based on numbers where QCP did everything right and just didn’t get paid what they were owed. Bad business if shareholders allow this to happen!
How does YAHOO show dividend at 6.45%. $3.48 annual dividend divided by stock price of $63.11 results in a rate of 5.5%. What am I missing?

"Lol @ all these people on the board nervous about the dividend. If you are long on the stock, wouldn't you rather the company cut the dividend and put money back this quarter? The extra cash is beneficial long-term for the stock.Disney completely removed their divi yesterday and saved $1.6 billion. For someone long the stock, how is this a negative?The people that demand a dividend during a deep recession are the type of people that would steal second helpings of food in a survival situation. Cutting the dividend given the circumstances would be okay and understandable this quarter."
When will the Dividend be announced? I thought it would be in January based on past years.
HCP is also down huge today. Is there something terrible going on that I'm not aware of?
The revenue is rising Y-to-Y but the EPS is declining. Investors are into accelerating growth stocks now rather negative growth stocks. Is that the reason for the selling?
$TDOC dipped today since Amazon has announced they will most likely push into the Telehealth space. This increases the chance of $DOCRF and $DOC.V or $WELL.TO getting acquired because we all know Amazon does not grow organically. I’ll be buying any dips sub $2.10.

"In general, cut dividend means management have no confidence for the future. Stock price will go down and settle at a new lower level."
Why is absolutely no one talking about the huge benefit REIT investors got from tax reform? Investors in the top tax bracket will see the tax rate on dividends drop from 39.6% to 29.6%. After tax income from REITs just went up 17%!
"Currently holding tens of thousands shares of $DOC.V as well as 2,000 shares of WELL. I did however add to my position in WELL today. Both companies represent an incredible growth opportunity which is simply expedited by the now resurgent virus. I chose to add to $WELL.TO because of their huge amount of cash on hand. Some acquisitions should be coming."
"Reminder----BMO downgraded WELL on 1/8/2021. The price at that time was $62.60. We are now (2/19) 10% higher . I'll repeat my favorite saying. NEVER trust the analyst!! In many cases they are a good ""contrary indicator"". GLTA"
77 per share to $52 in 8 months???? Wow!!
"In case some of you were wondering why this stock keeps going down consider this. MANY MANY funds and fund managers play the interest rate cycle game. That means they sell REITs and Utilities ""INDISCRIMINATELY"" as rates rise. they are sold thru options, ETF's and the like. It doesn't have anything to do with company fundamentals. That said......here's how it works for HCN. HCN has very good debt coverage per their debt/equity ratio. However, approximately 30% of their debt comes due from 2018-2023. That debt has to be refinanced at higher interest rates, that reduces profit for the company. All this is assuming that equity is not issued and also that occupancy rates and income is ""unchanged"". Watch for the week of February 18-25, thats when most of the REITS report earnings and provide future guidance. FWIW.....I think REITS will recover somewhat on positive earnings reports. Just got to have some patience here, ......good luck all."

(NYSE: WELL) from Neutral to Overweight with a price target of $71.00.The analyst comments ""We are upgrading our rating on WELL to Overweight, as we are becoming more positive on some stocks that have faced greater COVID-19 headwinds. While we still expect messaging on the 4Q call to be cautious as it relates to real-time senior housing fundamentals, we do believe the business will ultimately stabilize sometime in 2021 and begin to turn the corner (for a slow recovery). Equally important, WELL has amassed significant dry powder from dispositions, and we expect capital deployment to ramp up a lot in 2021, setting the stage for earnings to begin to turn the corner."""

I think the lock downs of the retirement communities has righted the ship for WELL and other companies like it. This is a long term play that will pay attractive divvies all along the way.
what price WellTower this time next year?
"Question for the forum -- With the size, scale, and network effects of big players in this space like $TDOC, will $Doc and $Well be able to compete? Will Canadian provinces opt for a made-in-Canada option? Are there any data privacy or other issues that would require Canadian provinces to use Canadian companies? Inter-operability across platforms sounds great, but can't the big players create walled gardens, and break any inter-operability to get clients to switch to them?"
"If I did my math right, in 2006 when 10 year Treasury yields were 5.1%, HCN Yielded 6.3%. Today 10 year rates are 2.55% and expected to go to 3.5 to 4% (maybe). And every investor is treating REITs like the plague and HCN is now yielding almost 6%. Pretty close to the same yield it had when rates were a lot higher. At some point this will become clear that the selling in REITs is an over reaction."
