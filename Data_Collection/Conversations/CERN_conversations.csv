More layoffs today:https://www.kansascity.com/news/business/article252000658.html
Does anyone have any news on a potential takeover of this company?
"Is it conceivable that we could see a stock price of $75 or higher by year end??? I've held this baby since 2003. I like the dividend, but it's strange that everyone that was with the company back in 2003 is gone or about to be gone."
Should find some support right at 69. Note that 69 is also the 50% retracement from the recent highs and the March lows.
Can Cern actually meet analyst expectations this qtr? Or will they have more excuses? What about raising guidance now that they have these big contracts signed?

The stock has gone from $82 to $69 since they announced the new CEO.

since breaking out over long term highs of $75 this has gone nowhere!! Hoping for $80 plus but keeps feeling like it just has no juice to get over the hump of $80
Did I remember from conference call that CERN will begin a dividend program this year??
"Cerner needs to bought; they are cleaning this company up (and getting rid of the former deadwood management team) in the hopes of a buyer coming along to make shareholder's happy. Brent Shafer is a placeholder CEO; say all the right things, smile a lot, and pray that a bigger fish comes along. They had their lunch eaten long ago by Epic; Cerner bet on the wrong horse and were crushed in the EMR Market. Time to sell and move on."
"expensive, debt is so low, but why is servicing it takes a lot of money from fcf? cud be used for dividend for such a good earnings making company"
Anybody know why the large volume today and sudden spike in price?
Does anyone know why the sudden spike in Cerner?
CFO Erceg just bought $750K of CERN stock:https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/804753/000120919121019437/xslF345X03/doc4.xml
Cerner is up 5.48% to 74.54
"Epic is a much stronger competitor for Cerner, especially since Neal Patterson's death and Zane Burke's departure from the organization; no big wins; inability to retain talent (lay-offs)."
"Looking for a competitor to Cern, (which I own), that's a better ""Patient point of contact"" stock. Does one exist? Would love to see ""EPIC"" go public. Thanks in advance."
Itâ€™s a buy at $44
