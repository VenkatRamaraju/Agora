Fulton Financial reached a 52 Week low at 12.01
FULT is down 4.93% to $15.23
What is driving this run? Itâ€™s been a steady improvement over several months!
"Hope that Fulton can catch some tailwind from the big banks, to help with stock price improvement. When Chase, and Goldman, and PNC all Beat by a mile...just maybe the Dutchmen can finally catch a friendly breeze into their sails, too!"
Anyone hear any rumors about FFC being bought out by another fairly large bank in the region also generally referred to by its initials?
Now that they have consolidated all their charters will a bigger bank take this one out? Fifth Third maybe? PNC is in their market Fulton would be a great addition to FTB. Any thoughts?
Somebody give me a reason why I still own this dead in the water company..

"Now that all the regulatory hurdles have been overcome, the bank is will be able to again make acquisitions.Any speculations on what banks are possible targets?"

"Fulton is simply beyond repair! In the absence of PPP loans and servicing fees, this company would be extinct by now. Only hope for Shareholders like me is that banking regulators will document their deficiencies and CAMELS weaknesses, and force this flaccid Board and Management to accept a buy out partner. We pray "
"Stock repurchase might have had some merit when market price was under $10. But now the stock price is above GAAP Book Value, and certainly higher than tangible book value. So why burn through capital that Fulton will need to support future growth, especially at current prices? Oh yea...because others are doing it! "
