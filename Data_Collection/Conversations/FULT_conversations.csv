"FULT's performance 10/17/16Sure hope FULT picks up its profitability, and more importantly its stock price, with the spate of recent officerpromotions/designations. Not sure what all these announcements were supposed to do, as FULT offered no specifics just generalities. In what manner is this expected to affect the business bottom line? Is the new mortgage manager expected to bring in more mortgage applications?How?In the end, I'm still in favor its merging with a larger player."

"Stock repurchase might have had some merit when market price was under $10. But now the stock price is above GAAP Book Value, and certainly higher than tangible book value.

"Fulton is simply beyond repair! In the absence of PPP loans and servicing fees, this company would be extinct by now. Only hope for Shareholders like me is that banking regulators will document their deficiencies and CAMELS weaknesses, and force this flaccid Board and Management to accept a buy out partner. We pray "
