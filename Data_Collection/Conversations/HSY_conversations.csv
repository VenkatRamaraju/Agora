Nice price appreciation for year to date
NOW A BUYING OPPORTUNITY???????????????? MOST DEFINITELY
4-1 split soon?
I hope Halloween chocolate sales revenue is going to be good for HSY. Being long on this stock for whike now.
"For those shorting the stock or thinking about taking a short position, keep in mind that the 3rd and 4th quarters historically have been two of Hershey's strongest quarters and I would expect this year to be no exception."
Glad I Sold at $116.50......I thought something smelled in Denmark !!
"some action last few days. Rumor of some ""merger"". There is some nice pre-market volume this morning. I think the stock is a great value here in the low $90's with an under $20B market cap."
"#HSY Indicator MACD, Stochastic oscillator and RSI go green at stoxline. Six months target: 118.77."
This stock will split in less than 30 days
@Born2Trade = Yes! Impressive at losing money! Soooooo funny!
I bought some shares today for the long haul. I don think you can go wrong buying at these levels.
Stochastic oscillator and RSI are triggering bullish signal. http://www.foxchart.com/share/260737018.png
I don’t see what is driving the uptick of HSY...A P/E of 25 seems too high for this company... I would expect the company to be selling in the 18-20 P/E range...which translates into $110-$120 range at max...
Sorry... No justification for HSY to trade at a 25 P/E ratio. This will see sub-$120 before it ever sees $160+. Great company!
HSY reached a new 52 Week Low at 95.75
another all time high today! $$$$$
This board is not active either as dead as the HSY stock. Held this stock over a decade. Good price appreciation in 10 years and good dividends but I in hindsight should have put the money in Facebook or the FANG. But it's ok. still holding on to HSY. love those chocolates
The worst managed company in all consumer foods.
Hsy on sale. what great company!
@Born2Trade if your short on cash I'll buy you a Hershey bar to make you feel better.....lol
Is there any information on HSY Halloween chocolate sales? Thanks
all up to the trust since they control the company ... splits are not fashionable
How are pre sales for hershey chocolates for Valentines day ?
$HSY Upgraded by RBC Capital Sector Perform » Outperform USD 157 » USD 170
We should see $163.70 this week
"Who were the marketing snowflakes that changed the classic ringing bells kisses Christmas commercial? Aw gee let's go all woke with it. I am boycotting HSY from now on, Andes makes an excellent chocolate mint that goes great over sugar cookies right when they come out of the oven."
Raising their prices on all products due to inflation. Others will follow.
HSY reached a new 52 Week Low at 99.14
UNDER A HUNDRED BUY IS A SURE WINNER
"I love this stock, my grandpa gave all his grandkids 1k in Hershey stock over 20 years ago... thats has paid for my first car, then paid off a DUI , and I currently have a 100 shares still!!! amazing dividends"
Hershey ttust will soon be gone when a good financial offer appears Money triumphs every time
Did you see that Home Depot sold out of its Halloween decor almost immediately in August! That tells me people are going all out for Halloween and will start buying candy in record amounts in October. BUY THE DIP.
Overpriced
Great stock today. Down 6 in the pre market at $139 and change then up to 149 and change at the close. Smoking!!!
is this a come backer ....?
"P/E of 49? If this is true, OMG this is crazy expensive. A normalized market P/E of 16 would put HSY fair value well under $50"
Wow a great day today !
Big bounce on average Vol and oversold conditions. Trying to squeeze out the most recent short interest which is small...Plus flat out manipulation which is common with this stock...
Twizzlers have screaming sales at Cinemas.
This and many other stocks are pulling back on light volume. Manipulation?
Great earnings report. Keep accumulating 
ICONIC NAME WILL SEE ICONIC APPRECIATION
"Looks like we're in for a pullback before the stock surges to new highs. Given the significant runup in the share price since January, I would not be surprised if the stock falls to the low 150s before the next leg up. If the recent snack acquisitions are accretive to earnings next year and they report strong numbers for Q3 and Q4, I continue to believe that the stock can climb to $200 by Q3 of next year."
"August 17,2021$182.71Let's move back up folks."

really like hershey's dark chocolate! yum!
Good support at 93.
I remember when the candy bars were 5cents...thats right 5cents and now over $1.00 If it drops below $89.99 I'll buy some .
This stock price hasn’t done much for a while. Owned this for a long tie. Good dividends.
it's been almost 3 years since the stock was at this level. Held this stock for many years. Cannot complain about the dividends .
"In theory, I understand the analyst report by Credit Suisse today discussing the downside risk of reduced impulse purchases for HSY due to more grocery sales moving online. The fact of the matter is HSY ended last year with record profits, operating margins, free cash flow all while increasing it's dividend like it does every year. ROIC was about 23.5% (amazingly efficient company), which is a couple percent higher than the most profitable company in the world in AAPL. So yes... the risks Credit Suisse discussed are real, but somehow financial results continue to shine. In store shopping is not going away in it's entirety and HSY will continue to get it's outsized portion of the U.S. confectionary share while increasing companywide sales through tuck in acquisitions like Amplify's Skinny Pop, Krave Jerky and the like. More downside possible and likely to be honest. I'm not worried long term, but will monitor closely. Good luck HSY longs.BTW... I think PEP and KO have more to worry about with online sales than HSY. They'll somehow be fine as well though."
@Born2Trade. clearly are just a little boy when it comes to trading stocks!
Christmas line up already designed.
Nice Bounce off low of day.
@Born2Trade Oh yes the so called professional speaks again! I see that your investment in CVIA is just off it's 52 week low and dropping daily! Unlike you I highly recommend HSY months ago and have been buying huge on the way up! $$$$$ I have just recently pulled some of my profits for an incredible gain! $$$$$ Let's also not forget that you have shorted HSY a while back and lost your shirt!Hopefully one day you will become slightly more educated within the realm of buying profitable stocks and learn how to turn a actual profit! But as of now all you have is hope and a lot less money! LMAO! It's always difficult for some people to admit they were wrong!
ninety seven looks good to me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Some 'analyst' (people who know nothing) was sure pushing this stock yesterday on CNBC prior to earnings. Whomever followed this advice lost their 'shirts' today in an explosive upside market. And so it goes with 'analysts' (those who know NOTHING)!
SPECULATION OF TAKEOVER WILL FUEL THIS STOCK WHY BECAUSE IT IS TRUE
"Today Mr. Trump targeted the abuses of H-1B visas, that hi tech companies abuse, in order to lower cost. According to a Goldman Sachs study, 1 million tech jobs have been taken from American workers, and given to foreign H-1B workers. Hopefully, Mr. Trump will next target J-1 visas, that manufacturing companies like Hershey used to give manufacturing jobs to foreign workers, at less pay. Multi national companies have really worked us over, haven't they. Maybe they should create a new visa class, to import lower cost management. Lets start one for CEO's and Board members, and pay them a fraction of what current management is getting."
sad. and it doesnt mention the thousands of young people here on visas from Europe.https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/business/hershey-nestle-mars-chocolate-child-labor-west-africa/
for sure a buffet stock. but i think they already own mars? or most of it? the hershey trust will have to get on board since they have controlling votes
The Daily ADX has made its 1st convicted cross since Feb.. The 200 day moving average can act like a magnet if this down trend can hold.. Vol to the downside and/selling into bounces will be a sign.. I am sticking to my 120's target..
Amazing that it's up today.
Indications this is a great buy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Take apiece of chocolate if you like to share.
"Does any one know of an app that gives the 52 week high and low exact dates ,like Scottrade did?"
call for a split?????????????? why not????????????
Hershey is way overdue for a new candy bar.
TWO HUNDRED REASONABLE??????????????
HSY HAD ITS RUN????????????????
Does anyone else see a reason other than the feminist movement which is driving this price up today? They’ve done this in the past why are people buying now?
If it does what it should do.. pulling back to the mid 120's could be/should becoming.. I sold 2 days ago.. I am short here.. I have to admit.. shorting this thing was a little hard to do..My stop...I will stay short until/if it brks it's new 52 wk high... Not too much risk...
I like their glow in the dark packages. Clever and a draw to buy
Do you think with them breaking a record and having a Super Bowl commercial will boost the price? ￼ https://finance.yahoo.com/news/reese-5-breaks-guinness-world-182031919.html
I love Hershey candy bars.Yummy!!!! Going to $160.00
Starting buying this in the 40 dollar range when I worked with the company. Will probably be exiting next year. Nice gains.
Good chart pattern look for more appreciation
"Hershey just announced they'll be moving the KRAVE headquarters to Austin TX from Sonoma CA. KRAVE has a very small headcount at their headquarters, so I really hope HSY does right by them, thru a choice of generous relocation or severance packages. I'm confident Hershey's will do the right thing here."
CHART LOOKS GOOD!!!!
"On October 11th Hershey filed an 8K with the SEC to report that Michelle Buck has been named Chairman of the Board of the company and that she will retain her position as CEO. She will replace outside director, Charles A. Davis, as Chairman of the Board and this change will be effective immediately.This announcement raises an interesting question. Rick Lenny was the last Hershey CEO who simultaneously held the position of Chairman of the Board. Immediately after Lenny's reign ended, the positions of CEO and Chairman of the Board were spit between two individuals and the Chairman position was awarded to an outside director to insure independent outside oversight of the management of the company. Now just last week, the company reversed course and consolidated these two top positions once again and an inside directors holds both positions.Anyone have any thoughts on what may have been the driver for this change and whether this might portend another big shoe to drop in the near future?I also find it interesting that this change has not been reported in Yahoo Finance news for Hershey and I was unable to find any reporting on this in other business news wires. It's almost as thought they're trying to keep this under the radar screen. The only reason I learned of this is through the HSY SEC filing alerts that I automatically receive by email."
Sjoma aka = Tomas Paine Remember I told you weeks ago to buy HSY! I'm still laughing at you! Hahaha
Yahoo needs to get these advertisers off of the chat room. Now!
"Hershey supporters, the PA Attorney General, and the local papers all say its good not let other people, and countries steal jobs from Hershey.Yet Hershey is a world class leader in taking American jobs and sending themelsewhere.And the stockholders don't care. It enriches them. Even though Hershey, likethousands of other companies sends good paying jobs overseas, while the stockholderschildren, their neighbors and friends may all be suffering because of Hersheyshareholder greed.Plus Hershey brings in lots of immigrants with cards that take jobs that unemployedteen Blacks in Harrisburg could be doing. Doesn't that sound racist ? Hershey would rather have immigrants put to work than Black American born citizens ?Did you ever see their pay ?Did you ever see their housing ?Did you know that card holding immigrants get paid more than minimum wage ?No doubt Hershey gets tax credits for paying foreign workers.Why else would they pay immigrants over 10 an hour, when they could pay UScitizens as little as 7.25 ?If you are a Hershey stockholder, you should be ashamed of yourself, and you shouldapologize to your kids, neighbors and friends for helping corporate Americalower their standard of living."
"After 5 years of nothing the stock is a buy here at $100 , right?"
Nice gain in the last quarter after being in 90 to 100 range gor years
HSY is one of my favorite dividend growth stocks. I talk about dividend growth stocks on my youtube channel. The channel is really focused on new and beginner investors looking to invest in dividend growth stocks and ETFs. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrg6IDPf4a7pUKTN90n6syg
"HSY just spent 112 million more to make 80 million more. That's just bad math people. Of course wall street rewards this. Earnings, operation income, you name it, all show the reality of trying to make stone soup. Growth will be hard to find.https://www.thehersheycompany.com/content/corporate_SSF/en_us/news-detail.html?14331"
"At these prices, $93/share, I like this investment. Plan on averaging in more and holding for long term."
What are the risks to the cocoa supply chain and potentially other commodity ingredients that are sourced outside the US as a result of the growing coronavirus crisis? I saw a report last evening that Nestle just issued an international travel ban policy for all of their employees worldwide.
"Not a doom and gloom guy nor am I short, but this appears to exist in its own unique bubble. Nothing about this company points even close to its current valuation"
"Is James still here??? Lmao, the MOMO/low beta trade is unwinding. People don’t understand how rotations happen. $200, forget about it."
Keeping my monthly DRIP going. Appreciate the shares at these prices. I like HSY as a long term investment
James... not even sure what a little boy means trading stock. Care to expand? At a weekly and monthly RSI over 80 it is actually in the long-termBulls best interest to come back to earth in order to create an environment for another leg up. Trading sidewise hearing and icing the RSI is not good in a market like this.Why are you so adamant about not taking profits and letting this dip? And using the dipTo buy back in rinse and repeat. The reality is that even if this continues to move agains the market it is company back to touch this area of 150 so you might as well save yourself some consternation.
As the late great J. Gleason said: “How sweet it is “ ️
HSY reached a new 52 Week Low at 94.13
Hershey workers are talking $185 shares coming.
Hello three percent!
Hershey has lost almost half it's value from it's 52 week High.They really need New Management if they want any serious buyers.Somebody should buy them out if they keep sinking in price. Hershey would be a bargain of a buy at $76.89
Overreaction to 1 penny miss qtr. Year earnings beat estimates...Oversold ?
Hershey is my 13th stock. My Bakers Dozen Profolio.
"It was baffling when we heard Penn State economics professors say how bad things would be with US tariffs, while ignoring the restrictions China made on our goods, and the 50 billion a month imbalance.Recently , Harvard and Yale professors have been caught making deals with China, and now we know many of our professors are bought and paid for skunks. Today, Pelosi is looking for economists to find bad things about record employment, raising wages, record minority employment, etc. And when they find someone to disparage it, remember, they , or maybe someone on their staff, has probably signed a deal with China, and is required to defend them, as well as turn over any technology they work with or create. Wonder if any Penn State Hershey researchers are on the dole, giving China medical technology ? Only an enemy, a thief, or a traitor can defend 50 billion a month trade imbalances."
"Finally, starting to look interesting"
"Divesting brands in a time like this - not to mention forgoing to materialize previous acquisitions - in order to save a business from it’s obligations, clearly would shrink future earnings of HSY. It may be rational, however, to know when to sell - even at a loss - and simply start over. The business of HSY is mainly in the US and holds selling rights to Kit-Kat and Cadbury. Perhaps, to keep a ship afloat, it must let go some of its barrels and only keep the essential ones. But planning to sell two more high-end chocolate brands concerns me. Confectionary products are competitive and it is hard to run a business under competitive prices. In the long run, 5 to 10 years, will HSY be stronger than ever? Hershey school benefits from HSY’s dividends, so, if earnings becomes a serious problem, forgoing dividend payouts would be necessary for the business but not good for the shareholders who rely on dividends. I am most concerned on HSY’s business health and Hershey’s legacy. Are we making the right moves? And if dividends are held, is it reasonable to expect the same level frugality toward compensations?"
I am truly disappointed Hershey is being ruined by poorly managed corporate Libtards! I have owned some of this stock for years and definitely thinking about dumping it.
"Have to love this JAMES guy. I try to point out why $HSY is a sell for long-term investors who think this is going to 200 in the short term and all I get is a bunch of bashing from this guy having no clue about my investments and certainly no clue about my trading... I'll say it again, every bull run needs pullbacks. It is healthy. In the case of the low-vol stocks many have run way way too far. They are going to need to come back. If you really believe in this getting to 200 someday or even higher this needs to pull back and pull back significantly. I see the the following PEN zerohedge article today talks exactly what I preach...https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/lowmin-volatility-funds-money-nothing-until-now"
"The President just signed an Executive Order about protecting Americans by limiting visas.Hershey loves low cost, foreign labor, that they can easily keep control by threatening to end their visa if they ever complain. Does that remind you of any group of people from our past ? They don't like to pay high wages to anyone but management, and we all end up with higher taxes.Stop bringing in low cost labor from Europe, and start employing some of the millions that have been laid off from covid. Hershey, with more employed Americans, your tax rate would be lower, as fewer people would need benefits. Lets talk about the workers rights of visa holders, and their living accommodations, next time. and perhaps we should mention management house staff and child nanny's who also are kept from finding other jobs, and lose their visa, if they leave their sponsor."
"One of the country's top brands, even without excessive advertising. Will benefit from corporate income tax cut and free trade in sugar, if that ever happens. I'm holding."
"With ""retirement"" of current Chairman, is new chairman more open to selling the company? Stock sold off initially today then has rebounded. Maybe folsk thought the same thing."
Cramer just said he thinks all the money has been made on HSY. Could be ripe for a split. But that didn't work out well for FAST.They were in the 70s pre split.
I can get a CD for a year that has a better return than HSY.
July since volume has been over a million shares traded.
HSY reached a new 52 Week Low at 89.95
this stock has not done much in terms of stock price appreciation for quite sometime. Held for dividends. long on HSY
"Just dropped below $90 for the first time in a while. If we break below $89.10 in the coming days, we'll likely see more momentum on the downside. Full disclosure - I have 33% of desired position in HSY @ $94.00. Holding off on any additional buys for now, but will complete my position at some point. I plan on this being a long term position, so perfectly fine with this dropping further."
HSY stock price has not done much for a few years since it peaked at $120. I am long on HSY.
"Oddly, back in the Enron and Adelphi’s days the pa ag decided that a tax exempt organization (the Hershey trust) should not have all their eggs in one basket so he forced them to auction off the company. They finally accepted a bid by wriggley but at the 11 th hour the ag let them off the hook. Then of course I think modeled made an offer for them…."
bought some just under $99 today. I had owned this when Mondelez made their offer and sold at $112. Just got back in.
Candy bars are selling fast in Hershey section of stores.Record Hershey sales in all top 25 grocery chains in America.
PE= 34X earnings??? Really?
solid steady gainer with a nice dividend ! $$$$$
HSY has been dead for a few years. Nice dividends but I am not expecting stock price appreciation for a while. Tastes have changed but I still like chocolate
"Trump will be in Hershey around 4. Surely he will talk about one government agenda driven Hershey, who dumped thousands of good paying jobs from south central pPenna, and gave them to Mexico. He should also talk about the thousands of jobs TEL took from south central Penna, and gave to China and India.Yes, south central PA should be a warning to anyone who believes in globalization. Its killing us, and believe me, ITS JUST STARTING."
HSY is down -4.91% to 104.91
I like this stock a lot. How can you not? If you have never been to Hershey in Pennsylvania you are missing out.
"HSY has held up extremely well.From 161 down to 148 in not even 10%. Many stocks have gotten whacked much harder. Even here at 148, HSY is not particularly cheap. I'm not sure who is propping it up or why. Maybe some hedge fund manager just loves this stock."
This share price for essentially zero revenue growth over past few years? No thanks
HSY is up 4.92% to 97.40
@Born2Trade Sorry buddy! another 52-week high today! Btw also speaking about stock picks remember the list of the few recommendations that I blessed you with a few weeks ago and obviously you did not listen. If you had bought almost any of my recommendations you would now have a very nice profit despite a volatile Market $$$$$Next time stick to what you are good at but I'm not sure exactly what that is??? Lol..
"Your fearless writer knows nothing and it is clear... James wrote a few days back that this was zooming because of a ""Yes! especially with a steaming economy! $$$$$$$""What investors here don't know is they are the benefactor of a rotation in defensive stocks and a risk-off environment. Hershey's may be the quintessential example because it also sells a product which is looked at as staple in hard times. Ie. chocolate.The reason this is down today is that risk is back on and so this sells off. If the economy is really in that good of shape then this is going down. You can't have it both ways James. I have no position but will short again at some point and I am 5/6 shorting this in a long-term trendline. Imagine how well I will do when it is decline. So James. You have been write for the wrongs reasons, but I am sure you know that even a Stopped CLOCK is right TWICE a day.Congrats."
@Born2Trade HSY to another record high today so I hope you are paying attention! $$$$!!!
How about when Hershey closed a plant in Ontario and Pennsylvania and built a new one in Mexico. Boycott the stuff imported from there ! Of course the most ironic thing is this is when everyone in pa got together and stopped the takeover by wriggly to save jobs in pa!
On 12-28-81 the price was $1.50 The price has certainly moved up since then. EPS is currently $5.46. DY for those that toughed it out until now is 363% yikes! That's the power of time and dividends!
MY PREDICTION ANYTHING LESS THAN NINETY WILL NOT LAST LONG AND WITH DEEP CONVICTION I BELIEVE WE WILL SEE ONE THIRTY OR MORE
Zacks latest analysis is a strong buy
This is definitely a buy right now.
"Clearly, HSY is a momentum stock. I worked for HSY for 32 years before retiring several years ago. Great company! Made buckets of money on this stock over the years and still sitting on options that do not expire until the end of September, 2021. This stock has been following a pattern for at least the past 20 years. It gets stuck in a narrow trading range for 4-5 years as it did from 2014-2018. When it finally starts to move, the uptrend typically continues for at least 18-24 months with the runup typically resulting in a doubling of the share price. While I was initially skeptical of the $200/share prediction, their huge EPS beat for Q2 reported on Thursday and the 7% increase in the dividend now leads me to conclude that $200 may actually be possible within the next 18-24 months."
Why are we down over $3 today?
I have been holding HSY for quite a while. It has been a good investment in my portfolio Good price appreciation and good dividends.
I think this stock is going to be in the range of $ 140 to $ 160 for a while . Any thoughts or opinions.
Two hundred coming!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Serious Pricing power here. Love it
I woke up with the hershey squirts today.......I figured it was an omen so I bought 300 shares......
HSY A BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! TAKE IT TO THE BANK AT THIS PRICE TAKEOVER PROSPECT!!!
"Question for the HSY investors: Why do you hold on to this stock when it yields 2.73% at today's price of $95? 1-year CD is at 2%, US10Y is at 2.85%.It's also clear HSY stock is going nowhere. So forget about capital gain on this one.Millennials are eating veges, low fat stuff, shopping at WFM, rather than chewing on the chocolate bars. So I don't see how in the long run you will do well.Isn't the downside risk much higher than the upside? So why do you hold?"
"If this stock rises , at what $ will you unload everything you have ?"
I just started building a position NGTF the sleep friendly ice cream snack food. Check it out it could be huge.
Privately owned shares sold !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This should be a good Day because we just beat earnings 
Way overpriced......can buy it for $116ish in 6 weeks.....gonna tank
Geld this stock for quite some time and been happy with stock price appreciation and dividends. How long will the good times last? No idea. Chocolate is one commodity (amongst others) that people buy when they are happy and sad.
"Sounds like HSY is one of the companies most impacted by the new import tariffs being implemented by Canada. As the news spreads, I fully expect HSY's stock to be hit. I'll be looking at any significant pullback as a buying opportunity. Good luck HSY longs..."
"Downgraded to sell from NEUTRAL. Wall Street doesn't have SELLS, NEUTRAL means sell. Insiders also selling in big lots. Ring the register."
Wow is all I can really say. I just joined this awesome stock picking service for free a few weeks ago and so far their stock tips have been amazing. Just go to https://awesomestockadvice.blogspot.com/ if you want to join also… .
"Hey hershey, you are a public company, that makes candy. Shareholders don't buy stock to help you push an agenda. Stay out of politics. Stay away from boycotts. Its not why you were allowed to incorporate and sell shares."
trust dissolving
HSY is down 6.57% to $101.06
"Perfectly healthy 31 year old Alexandria Blocasio Smollett got her covid shot the third day it became available. Tens of Thousands of older folks in need STILL haven't gotten their FIRST shot. All about the ""Benjamins"" ....."
"took my profits at $100.50Not a bad trade. I like the earnings and outlook, increased dividend and buyback but costs are going up."
"Earnings generally good, but margins will need to be watched carefully in the quarters to come. Gross margin dropping to 44.9 percent from 47.5 percent in the year-ago quarter is a fairly big deal..."
"Hershey is a growth stock. Its retreated recently. And for a while now. But look at the 20 year chart. You don't buy it for the dividend. you buy it for growth. the dividend is a bonus, which happens to be about 10 times what you get on a bank CD. and just maybe, one day, nestle will buy it. I hope not. nestle will change their chocolate formulas, and nestles taste isn't appealing."
Don't bother...just get a CD that pays same with no risk.
I’m a buyer @ $80
Thanks for flying into Omaha for my gift package the other day. I think the Reese's Peanut Butter Cups sealed the deal. See you soon...
A buy under one hundred
SOMEBODY WILL BUY HSY AND PAY A HEFTY PREMIUM WHY?????????? THE LOVE OF MONEY
Down over $6 wow. This stock was bound to correct.
Theres a rumour that Hershey is interested in buying a weed company that makes chocolate edibles. Can anyone confirm this?
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia2sUU7nwFo ..HSY + AABB Up 2,700 % in 2021... and 2022.. ??"
"Do yourself a favor and run to Aldi's for your next chocolate bar. Not only will you save money, it cost about $1.50 for a 5.2oz bar, but it will taste better. Their bar is a product of Austria called Choceur, it is made with real vanilla and no PGPR cocoa butter substitute. Hershey products just keep getting worse. (Had an Almond Joy the other day, it is not made with milk chocolate anymore. I could have sworn it used to be made with milk chocolate but I could be wrong)."
Just read that the CFO stated that many companies got ahead of announced price increases buy buying more now. Great so they front-loaded sales in Q2. Going to make a great short in Q3 Q4
"Hyatt,When you buy a company you pay the lowest price and make money. Just because other people pay higher prices.Don't mean everybody will do the same."
"HSY is one of the few stocks I own that has remained green today, at least so far, in an overall down market. I am by no means an expert in reading chart patterns, but it looks to me that a lopsided double bottom may be forming. If the uptrend continues into next week, that would seem to further confirm a double bottom, which would indicate a major uptrend in the share price in the near future. The months of November and December have always been good to Hershey. We'll soon find out if that historical trend holds. To all of you expert chart reading traders out there, what say you?https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/HowtoBuy_DB.jpg"
I dont think this is accurately priced many of their customers are closed and the impulse buy is over as well as hershey park
Chocolate sales have been surging since the start of the pandemic in mid-March. This should bode well for Hershey's Q2 results.http://westchester.news12.com/story/42354595/chocolate-sales-rise-during-pandemic
HSY WILL HAVE VERY GOOD ERP and EPS they will baet on EPS ERP GET IN NOW price target 175 to 190 you hurd it frist here GET IN NOW IF YOU WANT TO MAKE MONEY
"Hershey joins the greenies. Not good. We have had climate change forever. 12,000 years ago Chicago was under hundreds of feet of ice. Make candy and stay out of politics."
"Div paying stocks like HSY have benefited from market conditions.. There has been some manipulation during this tun up.. That is common and often hard to fight on the short side.. However, when a short player decides it is time to get involved you can have some serious retraction in the short term.. I have been short and still have a small short postion.. I have mentioned 120's as my target.. That is simply based on the charts..."
My short worked out great.. I took 1/2 my profits today.. I will hold the rest until we hit the 120's.. It was a nail bitter but what isnt ???
WB rumors...
"Earnings beat, still 5.50 drop on lower guidance. Seems an overreaction....."
