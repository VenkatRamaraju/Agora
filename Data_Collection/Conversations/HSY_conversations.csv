"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia2sUU7nwFo ..HSY + AABB Up 2,700 % in 2021... and 2022.. ??"
Zacks latest analysis is a strong buy
"For those shorting the stock or thinking about taking a short position, keep in mind that the 3rd and 4th quarters historically have been two of Hershey's strongest quarters and I would expect this year to be no exception."
I like their glow in the dark packages. Clever and a draw to buy
I bought some shares today for the long haul. I don think you can go wrong buying at these levels.
bought some just under $99 today. I had owned this when Mondelez made their offer and sold at $112. Just got back in.
"Hershey joins the greenies. Not good. We have had climate change forever. 12,000 years ago Chicago was under hundreds of feet of ice. Make candy and stay out of politics."
I like this stock a lot. How can you not? If you have never been to Hershey in Pennsylvania you are missing out.
How about when Hershey closed a plant in Ontario and Pennsylvania and built a new one in Mexico. Boycott the stuff imported from there ! Of course the most ironic thing is this is when everyone in pa got together and stopped the takeover by wriggly to save jobs in pa!
"Do yourself a favor and run to Aldi's for your next chocolate bar. Not only will you save money, it cost about $1.50 for a 5.2oz bar, but it will taste better. Their bar is a product of Austria called Choceur, it is made with real vanilla and no PGPR cocoa butter substitute. Hershey products just keep getting worse. (Had an Almond Joy the other day, it is not made with milk chocolate anymore. I could have sworn it used to be made with milk chocolate but I could be wrong)."
Take apiece of chocolate if you like to share.
"Hyatt,When you buy a company you pay the lowest price and make money. Just because other people pay higher prices.Don't mean everybody will do the same."
This should be a good Day because we just beat earnings 
this stock has not done much in terms of stock price appreciation for quite sometime. Held for dividends. long on HSY
Did you see that Home Depot sold out of its Halloween decor almost immediately in August! That tells me people are going all out for Halloween and will start buying candy in record amounts in October. BUY THE DIP.
My short worked out great.. I took 1/2 my profits today.. I will hold the rest until we hit the 120's.. It was a nail bitter but what isnt ???
Geld this stock for quite some time and been happy with stock price appreciation and dividends. How long will the good times last? No idea. Chocolate is one commodity (amongst others) that people buy when they are happy and sad.
Nice gain in the last quarter after being in 90 to 100 range gor years
Hershey workers are talking $185 shares coming.
The worst managed company in all consumer foods.
This stock price hasn’t done much for a while. Owned this for a long tie. Good dividends.
"Just dropped below $90 for the first time in a while. If we break below $89.10 in the coming days, we'll likely see more momentum on the downside. Full disclosure - I have 33% of desired position in HSY @ $94.00. Holding off on any additional buys for now, but will complete my position at some point. I plan on this being a long term position, so perfectly fine with this dropping further."
Raising their prices on all products due to inflation. Others will follow.
July since volume has been over a million shares traded.
Chocolate sales have been surging since the start of the pandemic in mid-March. This should bode well for Hershey's Q2 results.http://westchester.news12.com/story/42354595/chocolate-sales-rise-during-pandemic
"Divesting brands in a time like this - not to mention forgoing to materialize previous acquisitions - in order to save a business from it’s obligations, clearly would shrink future earnings of HSY. It may be rational, however, to know when to sell - even at a loss - and simply start over. The business of HSY is mainly in the US and holds selling rights to Kit-Kat and Cadbury. Perhaps, to keep a ship afloat, it must let go some of its barrels and only keep the essential ones. But planning to sell two more high-end chocolate brands concerns me. Confectionary products are competitive and it is hard to run a business under competitive prices. In the long run, 5 to 10 years, will HSY be stronger than ever? Hershey school benefits from HSY’s dividends, so, if earnings becomes a serious problem, forgoing dividend payouts would be necessary for the business but not good for the shareholders who rely on dividends. I am most concerned on HSY’s business health and Hershey’s legacy. Are we making the right moves? And if dividends are held, is it reasonable to expect the same level frugality toward compensations?"
Overpriced
CHART LOOKS GOOD!!!!
"Earnings beat, still 5.50 drop on lower guidance. Seems an overreaction....."
Hershey is way overdue for a new candy bar.
4-1 split soon?
"In theory, I understand the analyst report by Credit Suisse today discussing the downside risk of reduced impulse purchases for HSY due to more grocery sales moving online. The fact of the matter is HSY ended last year with record profits, operating margins, free cash flow all while increasing it's dividend like it does every year. ROIC was about 23.5% (amazingly efficient company), which is a couple percent higher than the most profitable company in the world in AAPL. So yes... the risks Credit Suisse discussed are real, but somehow financial results continue to shine. In store shopping is not going away in it's entirety and HSY will continue to get it's outsized portion of the U.S. confectionary share while increasing companywide sales through tuck in acquisitions like Amplify's Skinny Pop, Krave Jerky and the like. More downside possible and likely to be honest. I'm not worried long term, but will monitor closely. Good luck HSY longs.BTW... I think PEP and KO have more to worry about with online sales than HSY. They'll somehow be fine as well though."
Does anyone else see a reason other than the feminist movement which is driving this price up today? They’ve done this in the past why are people buying now?
"I love this stock, my grandpa gave all his grandkids 1k in Hershey stock over 20 years ago... thats has paid for my first car, then paid off a DUI , and I currently have a 100 shares still!!! amazing dividends"
for sure a buffet stock. but i think they already own mars? or most of it? the hershey trust will have to get on board since they have controlling votes
"took my profits at $100.50Not a bad trade. I like the earnings and outlook, increased dividend and buyback but costs are going up."
On 12-28-81 the price was $1.50 The price has certainly moved up since then. EPS is currently $5.46. DY for those that toughed it out until now is 363% yikes! That's the power of time and dividends!
"Looks like we're in for a pullback before the stock surges to new highs. Given the significant runup in the share price since January, I would not be surprised if the stock falls to the low 150s before the next leg up. If the recent snack acquisitions are accretive to earnings next year and they report strong numbers for Q3 and Q4, I continue to believe that the stock can climb to $200 by Q3 of next year."
"Clearly, HSY is a momentum stock. I worked for HSY for 32 years before retiring several years ago. Great company! Made buckets of money on this stock over the years and still sitting on options that do not expire until the end of September, 2021. This stock has been following a pattern for at least the past 20 years. It gets stuck in a narrow trading range for 4-5 years as it did from 2014-2018. When it finally starts to move, the uptrend typically continues for at least 18-24 months with the runup typically resulting in a doubling of the share price. While I was initially skeptical of the $200/share prediction, their huge EPS beat for Q2 reported on Thursday and the 7% increase in the dividend now leads me to conclude that $200 may actually be possible within the next 18-24 months."
"August 17,2021$182.71Let's move back up folks."
