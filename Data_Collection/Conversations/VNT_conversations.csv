"For the full year 2021, Vontier anticipates adjusted diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $2.55 to $2.65. <- this would put their current price as P/E around 12... they grew revenue 16% last Q. With a 16 PE they are a $40 stock. Why such a discount?"
No love for this cast off coming out of the gates. I'll be starting a position soon.
