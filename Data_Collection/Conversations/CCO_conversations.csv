"Many people are seeking for stability in this unstable crypto space and A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now . I'd say it's wrong to just sit back hold and wait maybe incur some losses along the line , that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making profits should be the way of life that being said , the market is still all about BTC at the moment and I'll advise current investors and newbies to take advantage of the Mr. Steve program , an establishment that handles people who lack understanding on how maneuver the crypto space , to help them recover loss from the crash and also accumulate more positive returns , with their program i went from having 1.4btc to 7btc in just 9 weeks.if you're interested in getting started just send Steve a message on whats<<<>>App + 1 ( 8 1 3 ) 6 8 3 ‑ 6 3 1 0 OR Te** le*gram @SteveFX01"
"I've been holding since late March. It has good potential. long haul must needed. after 2 weeks, we will see some serious action"

CCO is up 5.62% to 4.70
"Time to divest European holdings, or sell a huge chunk domestically. Debt load is killing them and ad sales are way down. Double whammy."
Jaysus that was a depressing fall. Pump and dump straight outta the books
"Great news for CCO future. How can it still remain so low?Looking ahead to 1Q, Clear Channel estimates that revenues from the Americas segment will decline by high 20 percentage points year-on-year and Europe segment revenues will decline by mid-30 percent year-on-year. Buy as much as you can."

Any knowledgeable Traders out there can tell us what's going on with this CCO stock?!
They have been selling off pieces of the business for the last few years to raise cash. I see this continuing until they sell the most profitable core assets in one large transaction. 6-18 month time frame.
Clear Channel Outdoor is up 17.59% to 1.27
And just look at the volume longs..... Sweet as we have just begun this uptick IMHO anyway. We shall see. Hold them shares my long friends !!
One good thing is euro biz should show sign of turn around ahead of US business due to stages of COVID.
Clear Channel Outdoor is up 9.13% to 2.51
"Since my last post, CCO did regain momentum. I don't know why so much of the news and analysis is bad. The technicals especially the lower indicators are saying that good news is just around the corner. I think that I'm reentering this trade."
why up so much? I thought it had a bad quarter.
"Everyone is talking that this stock is going up but ignores the huge losses that will weigh on the current $.73 price and likely lead to further and more painful price declines in the future. Not one poster has provided a concrete reason that the price should go up over any time period. I looked at CCO, I sniffed at CCO, I am moving on."
Great!!! keep going CCO
"This is either worth 0, or $5+ in 3 years. I like that risk/reward."
"Big volume, low close. Any thoughts?"
Does anybody have a sense for CCO's stock plummet?

"Zacks Equity ResearchFri, May 7, 2021, 7:59 AM·2 min readAs of late, it has definitely been a great time to be an investor in Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, Inc. CCO. The stock has moved higher by 17.6% in the past month, while it is also above its 20-day SMA too. This combination of strong price performance and favorable technical could suggest that the stock may be on the right path.We certainly think that this might be the case, particularly if you consider CCO’s recent earnings estimate revision activity. From this look, the company’s future is quite favorable; as CCO has earned itself a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), meaning that its recent run may continue for a bit longer, and that this isn’t the top for the in-focus company."
Just like that! Rang the register!!!
Clear Channel Outdoor is up 8.82% to 2.59
GREAT DAY FOR CCO!
Please notice the huge salaries the managers pay themselves. Shareholders suffer while management does very nicely. Only in America.
CCO is up 5.45% to 5.80
Clear Channel Outdoor is up 10.00% to 1.54
If you are in this stock surely you can see it going up daily from its low and with pretty nice volume to boot... These guys wont let this stock get de-listed. Enough shares here to be purchased to drive above the dollar mark to get back and stay listed without a doubt... I hope so anyway as I am counting on it !!!!! I guess time will tell us that.

The Outdoor Advertising Industry had a lot of upgrades over theyears. Sign painter's have been replaced by Flex vinyl wraps on bulletin displays . The smaller poster changed from paper copy to a single sheet vinyl. The new Digital displays are more profitable All these changes cost but i am bullish on this company as the economy improves . I agree their financial health is in the toilet but I think they refinanced at a lower rate Rolling the dice purchased shares today. Let's make money

What I don't like about CCO is the fact that their financial health is in the toilet.

I don't know but these are all major warning flags that make me not want to touch this no matter how cheap it currently is."

"Well, when I bought last month, I said if it went over a $1, I would sell. I got out at $1.09, bought in at .51. If it goes back down to under .70 again, I may jump back in, but there is significant dilution coming with this stock potentially, and they sold off a part of the business to get liquid, so revenues in the future will be down also. This stock is definitely worth $1, but it's not worth $2... Real valuation will be somewhere in between. GLTA"

Our best 6-18 month outcome will be a buyout. This company has excellent physical plant in many of the top USA markets. Just poorly run. $8-$15 per share would be a steal. Spin off smaller pieces and concentrate on markets where they are the dominant player.
The party is over?
CCO continues its steady climb over the long term. GO LONGS!!!
Clear Channel Outdoor (CCO) could be a solid choice for investors given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). An upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices -- has triggered this rating change.
They really need to divest some of there inventory to get the share price up. I am surprised that large owners and funds are not applying pressure. The share price languishing around $1 is unacceptable.
