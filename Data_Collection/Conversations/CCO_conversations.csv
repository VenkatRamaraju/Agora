"Im in at 0.6, with 23K shares. Im holding long. This will go up, not even worried. Stay strong everyone."
The issuance of more debt by the company probably weighed on the minds of traders today. I think that the stocks should regain its upward momentum going forward

Our best 6-18 month outcome will be a buyout. This company has excellent physical plant in many of the top USA markets. Just poorly run. $8-$15 per share would be a steal. Spin off smaller pieces and concentrate on markets where they are the dominant player.
Am I too late to go in ?
CCO continues its steady climb over the long term. GO LONGS!!!
"Woo hoo! Go CCO! As I've said for many months, LONGS will win!!!"
"It's a great stock to hold and be very happy with.Just waiting to add some more,the lower it goes the more I get for my money,very,very simple."
"Zacks Equity ResearchFri, May 7, 2021, 7:59 AM·2 min readAs of late, it has definitely been a great time to be an investor in Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, Inc. CCO. The stock has moved higher by 17.6% in the past month, while it is also above its 20-day SMA too. This combination of strong price performance and favorable technical could suggest that the stock may be on the right path.We certainly think that this might be the case, particularly if you consider CCO’s recent earnings estimate revision activity. From this look, the company’s future is quite favorable; as CCO has earned itself a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), meaning that its recent run may continue for a bit longer, and that this isn’t the top for the in-focus company."
"Very excited about CCO, I’m waiting for the next spike to 0,70 in the next few days. Will be a lovely ROI"
"Well, when I bought last month, I said if it went over a $1, I would sell. I got out at $1.09, bought in at .51. If it goes back down to under .70 again, I may jump back in, but there is significant dilution coming with this stock potentially, and they sold off a part of the business to get liquid, so revenues in the future will be down also. This stock is definitely worth $1, but it's not worth $2... Real valuation will be somewhere in between. GLTA"
"Channel Outdoor Holdings Inc (CCO) an Analyst Rating Rank of 62, meaning CCO is ranked higher by analysts than 62% of stocks. The average projection by analysts for CCO is $4.46 over the next 12 months and analyst’s classify the stock as a Strong Buy"

"I just love the salaries the CCO executives pay themselves. Don't you?It's a marvel that with a net loss was $135.8 million and $212.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and $567.7 million and $393.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, these executives get paid more money than most Americans can save in a lifetime.Mr. Christopher William Eccleshare CEO-Worldwide, Pres & Director 3.15M Mr. Brian D.

Will stock holders in iHeart receive stock in CCO when the split occurs? CCO is a spinoff from iHeart and when the spinoff occurred stock holders in iHeart received nothing.

"Market manipulation to keep the stock listed. Even so, i'm interested in finding out if this company will become cash flow positive. Any thoughts?"
Issued debt at the CCI bv subsidiary at 6 5/8%. This provides company with significant liquidity through the crisis. Definitely a positive and the company had no issues getting the financing done.

Clear Channel Outdoor (CCO) could be a solid choice for investors given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). An upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices -- has triggered this rating change.

"Since my last post, CCO did regain momentum. I don't know why so much of the news and analysis is bad. The technicals especially the lower indicators are saying that good news is just around the corner. I think that I'm reentering this trade."
"Many people are seeking for stability in this unstable crypto space and A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now . I'd say it's wrong to just sit back hold and wait maybe incur some losses along the line , that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making profits should be the way of life that being said , the market is still all about BTC at the moment and I'll advise current investors and newbies to take advantage of the Mr. Steve program , an establishment that handles people who lack understanding on how maneuver the crypto space , to help them recover loss from the crash and also accumulate more positive returns , with their program i went from having 1.4btc to 7btc in just 9 weeks.if you're interested in getting started just send Steve a message on whats<<<>>App + 1 ( 8 1 3 ) 6 8 3 ‑ 6 3 1 0 OR Te** le*gram @SteveFX01"
