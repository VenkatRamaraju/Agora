"Great news for CCO future. How can it still remain so low?Looking ahead to 1Q, Clear Channel estimates that revenues from the Americas segment will decline by high 20 percentage points year-on-year and Europe segment revenues will decline by mid-30 percent year-on-year. Buy as much as you can."
It's gonna explode
I bought today at 1.03 hope until November to be at 2-2.20 $
The issuance of more debt by the company probably weighed on the minds of traders today. I think that the stocks should regain its upward momentum going forward
Just bought some shares gonna hold for a bit sure will rally even more when opening of economy comes on May 1st
Anything positive with this company?
We are seeing 1.2 today !
Does anybody have a sense for CCO's stock plummet?
"back to .90 , can't believe it "
Any chance at $1.50 today?
The best thing about this company is that the top executives pay themselves a fabulous wage while shareholders debate the virtues of losing money.
Earnings come out on the 6th
Can anyone explain the press release today? Shareholder protection rights.
"as it seems it's going down let's hope it will stop at 0,90 . for me in long term it has great potential ."

"Zacks Equity ResearchFri, May 7, 2021, 7:59 AM·2 min readAs of late, it has definitely been a great time to be an investor in Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, Inc. CCO. The stock has moved higher by 17.6% in the past month, while it is also above its 20-day SMA too. This combination of strong price performance and favorable technical could suggest that the stock may be on the right path.We certainly think that this might be the case, particularly if you consider CCO’s recent earnings estimate revision activity. From this look, the company’s future is quite favorable; as CCO has earned itself a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), meaning that its recent run may continue for a bit longer, and that this isn’t the top for the in-focus company."

BOOM !! Now let’s go ^^^^^^^^^
CCO reached a new 52 Week High at 5.72
They really need to divest some of there inventory to get the share price up. I am surprised that large owners and funds are not applying pressure. The share price languishing around $1 is unacceptable.
Is it today that day??
CCO is performing well (as predicted) due to the economy opening up again.
"Come on Lamar, buy us out!"
Severe dilution will knock the stock price below $3  support at $2.50  market cap needs to trade below a billion
Clear Channel Outdoor is down 9.40% to 0.93
"Well, when I bought last month, I said if it went over a $1, I would sell. I got out at $1.09, bought in at .51. If it goes back down to under .70 again, I may jump back in, but there is significant dilution coming with this stock potentially, and they sold off a part of the business to get liquid, so revenues in the future will be down also. This stock is definitely worth $1, but it's not worth $2... Real valuation will be somewhere in between. GLTA"
