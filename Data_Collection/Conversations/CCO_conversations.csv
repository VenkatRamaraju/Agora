"CCO will continue to rise over the long term. It dropped in February 2020 due to COVID market reaction. No brainer. If you are savvy, you would have bought this stock below $1.50 and watch it grow above $5.00 over the long run. ;-)"
Hopefully not running out of steam here.
Many are going to miss out on CCO's big bump. :-)

OK longs no fretting here.... JUST HOLD !!!!! You will be quite happy IMHO anyway.. Time will tell. GLT ALL !!
It's gonna explode
Our best 6-18 month outcome will be a buyout. This company has excellent physical plant in many of the top USA markets. Just poorly run. $8-$15 per share would be a steal. Spin off smaller pieces and concentrate on markets where they are the dominant player.

If you are in this stock surely you can see it going up daily from its low and with pretty nice volume to boot... These guys wont let this stock get de-listed. Enough shares here to be purchased to drive above the dollar mark to get back and stay listed without a doubt... I hope so anyway as I am counting on it !!!!! I guess time will tell us that.

And just look at the volume longs..... Sweet as we have just begun this uptick IMHO anyway. We shall see. Hold them shares my long friends !!
They have been selling off pieces of the business for the last few years to raise cash. I see this continuing until they sell the most profitable core assets in one large transaction. 6-18 month time frame.

Great!!! keep going CCO
The issuance of more debt by the company probably weighed on the minds of traders today. I think that the stocks should regain its upward momentum going forward
$2+ next week. Deal Deal Deal..
"Zacks Equity ResearchFri, May 7, 2021, 7:59 AM·2 min readAs of late, it has definitely been a great time to be an investor in Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, Inc. CCO. The stock has moved higher by 17.6% in the past month, while it is also above its 20-day SMA too. This combination of strong price performance and favorable technical could suggest that the stock may be on the right path.We certainly think that this might be the case, particularly if you consider CCO’s recent earnings estimate revision activity. From this look, the company’s future is quite favorable; as CCO has earned itself a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), meaning that its recent run may continue for a bit longer, and that this isn’t the top for the in-focus company."

"Starting to heat up boys! Hold, that easy."
Many people are returning or have already returned to work. Lock-downs and mask mandates have been lifted in various states. Billboard advertisement revenue will return as expected. This is definitely a great stock for longs. Enjoy the steady climb upward!
"Very excited about CCO, I’m waiting for the next spike to 0,70 in the next few days. Will be a lovely ROI"
Any news?
This doesn't want to go below .60. What is holding up the climb?
"Big volume, low close. Any thoughts?"
Clear Channel Outdoor (CCO) could be a solid choice for investors given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). An upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices -- has triggered this rating change.

The Outdoor Advertising Industry had a lot of upgrades over theyears. Sign painter's have been replaced by Flex vinyl wraps on bulletin displays . The smaller poster changed from paper copy to a single sheet vinyl. The new Digital displays are more profitable All these changes cost but i am bullish on this company as the economy improves . I agree their financial health is in the toilet but I think they refinanced at a lower rate Rolling the dice purchased shares today. Let's make money
Just bought some shares gonna hold for a bit sure will rally even more when opening of economy comes on May 1st
Looking much better longs. Hand tight. We are going to be happy. GL gang !!
"when the earnings report comes out on July 29th, this could possibly take a huge dip if it doesn't meet expectations or beat them. What I don't like about CCO is the fact that their financial health is in the toilet. Losses have increased the past 5 yrs. at a rate of 36% a year, they have negative shareholder equity, and their liabilities exceed their assets. I don't know but these are all major warning flags that make me not want to touch this no matter how cheap it currently is."

"Well, when I bought last month, I said if it went over a $1, I would sell. I got out at $1.09, bought in at .51. If it goes back down to under .70 again, I may jump back in, but there is significant dilution coming with this stock potentially, and they sold off a part of the business to get liquid, so revenues in the future will be down also. This stock is definitely worth $1, but it's not worth $2... Real valuation will be somewhere in between. GLTA"

"Many people are seeking for stability in this unstable crypto space and A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now . I'd say it's wrong to just sit back hold and wait maybe incur some losses along the line , that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making profits should be the way of life that being said , the market is still all about BTC at the moment and I'll advise current investors and newbies to take advantage of the Mr. Steve program , an establishment that handles people who lack understanding on how maneuver the crypto space , to help them recover loss from the crash and also accumulate more positive returns , with their program i went from having 1.4btc to 7btc in just 9 weeks.if you're interested in getting started just send Steve a message on whats<<<>>App + 1 ( 8 1 3 ) 6 8 3 ‑ 6 3 1 0 OR Te** le*gram @SteveFX01"
