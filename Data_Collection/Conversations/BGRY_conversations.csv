"I will make my first purchase of shares tomorrow. Likely will make more in the future but have to start somewhere. Amazon once acquired a factory robotics company for a huge premium, so valuation can easily be underestimated."
Still bullish but when watching this stock feel like...
"bullish on this stock for long term, loaded today. Will load more if it drops further."
It would be nice to see some orders in their press releases on their website. I believe the last order announced was in July.

Waiting for $5. Way over valued.

The drop was most likely unlocked shares being sold. It will come back up soon.
BGRY is still moving sideways and that’s totally OKAY. The fundamentals of this company have not changed. In 3-5 years people won’t believe we got in below $10.

I would like it to drop a lot more. I think this price is a little too much. anything at 5 is a buy.
Thinking of buying. Can't find much info. Does current revenue support 2.7 bil valuation? What would be the fair valuation? Any links?
I will buy at $5.
why the 6.6% drop today....didn't see any news?

"Holding strong even if it goes to $0.01. This stock is a banger, and will be the reason some of the biggest retailers on the planet will be able to actually compete with Amazon."
"where are the quarterly updates published, cant find meaningful insight? Do they even provide"
I'll buy @ $8
