"RGLD hit a bottom last week at $108.65/sh. Now has recovered to 112.26. A real battle going on for Gold. Does it have the muscle to push higher here? We have Covid, World currencies printing money, inflated stock prices, Afgan fiasco, Taiwan war rumblings. Investors are in denial. Sure Gold could go down from here. I'm betting medium to long term investors will be begging for some real money, it will happen so fast there will be no time to react. Currently holding 750 shares of RGLD, will be buying more below $110/sh."
"I wanted to share my charts once again I created of Silver and Gold futures. I created the charts on July 30, 2021. It was very obvious to me where the metals were headed. This shakeout is not over yet, I sense. The news lies. People lie, or are uneducated about reading data, but the charts don't lie. They are always up for interpretation, but it's some of the few methodologies that the average retail investor and trader have to track the profession Smart money investment and trading activity. We want to trade along with the smart money, not be victim to their media manipulations. We will likely get a short-term counter trend relief bounce here soon, but spot down to $18ish Silver, if they want to get ugly about it. The professional buys haven't stepped in to stop the fall yet. We'll see where they take it. https://stoneworxproperties.com/Silver_Futures_073021.jpghttps://stoneworxproperties.com/Gold_Futures_073021.jpg $GLD $GOLD $WPM $NEM $SLV $RGLD $PAAS $CDE $FNV"
"Just running back of envelope numbers and here's an example why Royalty Streaming companies will do so great. #RGLD sold 320,000 gold equivalents ounces (GEO) last Q at $1711 avg. Let's say next Q their average is $1911. That's an extra net profit of $64 million. They have about 64 million shares outstanding. So, that's about $1 increase per share in net earnings. You'll never get these numbers or percentages with Miners that have heavy Royalty burdens.....and #AG has 25% nsr's.....normal Royalties are 2-5% nsr's."
Good entry point.
Bought 100 shares @ 100.83. Current position 1550/shares. Will be holding for higher prices. Dividend next week.
"Terrible dividend for a ""Royalty"" company. Don't listen to the hype, simply look at p/e and dividend. #NEM does much much much better. I even sold out my core positions as insiders only people getting well compensated here, while shareholders taking ALL the risk are not. good luck!!...go buy #RIO, #BHP, #MO, #VALE, #NEM....but stay away from these little fiefdoms that like to have ""investor conferences"" yet never have any investor bonanzas!"
This stock just goes down every day as it’s a perfect example of how awful this sector is.
Bought the premarket dip. Very bullish on metals like this one and WPM.
"Rgld had been continuously down 10 straight days from 110 to 97, people keep selling and is 52 week low today and last couple days."
"RGLD has come a long way in two weeks! Closing at $92.27/shr 11Oct, today hitting a high around $102/shr.Had 1950 shares of RGLD 11Oct. Currently holding 1350 shares. I claim no ability to predict where RGLD will go short term, but holding plenty of cash on the sidelines in case we see RGLD prices dip in Nov/Dec. Will continue to take profits if we go up from here. Cheers to those who bought on this last price dip!"
"I see it going to 60 or lower. It should be a buy around 45. Last time, I bought under 30."
"RGLD 112.12, two weeks ago was at 121+. I feel much more confident buy RGLD at todays prices. Sure we could get more stormy weather for gold prices in the next 3 to 6 months, but a nice pop could be in the cards as well. Currently holding 650 shares of RGLD, am neutral short/medium term, Bullish longer term (6 months+). Let us know what you think!"
"I think it’s over 80% owned by one institution, the flow is so small and it’s easily manipulated."
"RGLD hitting lows today of 105.85 so far. Buying here, holding 1050 shares. No pain, no gain. Anyone else care to share an opinion?"
"This stock had come down for a whole month on a daily basis since September 13 at 110, been 52 week low since last week, gold price is only down $60 since august high. Can’t think of another worse stock than this.Management doesn’t seem to care, I think BOD need a shake up."
"thats funny, spot gold prices holding up unchanged, but rgld keeps going down. with covid cases rising, and UI bumps set to expire within weeks, along with never ending money printing, im not sure how this many people are viewing this as a sell. go figure. im staying long for the inevitable move past 150."

Gold will come back in a big way gold fillings from graves will be uncovered soon
