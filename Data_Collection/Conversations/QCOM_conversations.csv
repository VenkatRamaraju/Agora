@Big. stop teasing us longs right now. we're tender from the ceaseless qcuckage.
All these positive conference calls and stories. Add up to nothing. Again quantify. The numbers. What is it adding to the bottom line.
"Marc, 12 days ago you predicted $160 in two weeks to a month. Well, you’ve got about 13 trading days left for your prediction. It would take company specific news that is very significant for this to go up 10% over the next 2 1/2 weeks, in particular because we’ve had a nice rally in the overall indices and the semiconductor stocks such as Qualcomm and Skyworks did not participate. AVGO saw a new 52 week high, Marvell did, nxpi did as well before it’s drubbing today. I could name others that did well the last couple weeks in general in the semi space but we have not. Unless a rabbit out of a hat happens with some company specific news, it’s not going to happen sin your timeframe."

"Nvidia’s minor beat and guidance which was much less then Qualcomm guidance and they get the nod. I’ve never seen such a massive disconnect in how Nvidia barely beats, goes up and when Qualcomm barely beats, they get smashed and have a friggin Forward PE of 15X vs Nvidia at 48X!!!!! The bottom line is that Qualcomm is not a respected company AT ALL by the larger investment community."
"Big, this is under no circumstances going to $167 end of month. There is no basis for it after the stellar earnings and price action which is clearly showing you it wants to close the gap at $142.44 from day of close of earnings. Once again, great earnings have been dismissed and what we currently have is PE CONTRACTION! This indicates the investment community does not believe in Qualcomm’s growth for the next 6 months despite Qualcomm clearly telling the street it’s there. Price action wins in the end, and Qualcomm is on the receiving end of perception of slowing growth according to the investment community"
"January 4th, 147 per share, today 143, need I say more on a market that hits all time highs everyday. Please don’t say it’s the apple modem or chip. Need more than that"

5G is like gg toilet in 2 yr time...u really think QCOM will be a redundant company? it is gg to $300..dont cry if u dont own any
Amon does a lot more of media appearance than the former CEO. He tries to sell his growth plan though the market recognizes yet. finally it will happen as other tech companies did.
"Those more knowledgeable than .e, what is your takeaway from Qcoms new offering in the data center space"
Is this the big catalyst. We have been patiently. Waiting for. 160. Plus. Amon was right. Give this baby a higher multiple ASAP.
Is this possibly a sign of things to come? Hopefully.Qualcomm reportedly replaced Huawei in a recent China Mobile tenderhttps://telecoms.com/511005/qualcomm-reportedly-replaced-huawei-in-a-recent-china-mobile-tender/
"All this is total BS. We will beat earnings, again, and we will beat guidance again, the stock will go into the $160 area and then after ER come down again by manipulation to $148 and we will repeat and repeat and repeat."
ive always wondered what happens when qcom taps lets say samsung to produce its chips or any products. doesnt that open the door for theft of trade secrets? i see that samsung landed google's phones modem biz.....
qcom should go private or be acquired by big tech.
Qualcomm and Intel won a DoD contract. Most media only mentions Intel. qcuck'd.
QCOM = Arms dealer for the Metaverse
"Stefanos, I’ll refrain from calling you names at this point because it’s nonsense. Broadcomm at 52 week high, Qualcomm down 16% off of its 52 week high. You talk about AVGO sideways trading yet it’s taken off nicely lately. Investment community very comfortable with that company, thinks very very little if anything at all of Qualcomm and that is a fact that you’re well aware of."
Good to see QCOM up 1+ while most of the semis are down. We may break $150 this week. Good luck to all
"Taking a break from the board. I’m tired of myself complaining. The stock is dead money once again and is going lower from here. As we can all see it underperforms here badly today against it’s beta because the technical damage is done. In the short term, perhaps next few weeks, this is going lower where depending on the Nasdaq, could see $132-133, or a lesser correction takes it to $137-138."
"Google Pixel volume the whole of last YEAR 7.2M. For comparison Xiaomi sales volume 44.4M last QUARTER alone, overtaking Apple as world's #2."
"The msg posts on this board about this ER are incredibly incorrect. All you have to do is read the transcript of the CC last quarter to see they sand bagged this quarter. Much upside bias was discussed based on supply constraints. Amon said over and over again... that second half improvements in supply will unleash a lot of demand they can fill. They talk about IOT growth of 20% to 30% QoQ continuing into the future. Margin expansion due to redirecting supply to higher margin products because they can... I encourage anyone who is really interested to read the transcript of last ER. The questions asked were very direct and answers provided were very bullish to upside bias for Q3 and beyond not in the guided numbers. We have not seen what this company is capable of delivering AT ALL yet. RF and MM Wave big drivers. IOT big driver. Demand going into 2nd half of FY21 ""significant and not included in numbers. Everyone needs to chill here. QCOM couldn't be in a better position going into the second half of the year. Nobody can predict how the market will react - but I can confidently predict their growth will be strong and the numbers will eventually play out in the pps."
Congrats to Rich…. He’s going to get his gap fill down in the $142’s. Let’s hope that holds.
In the long run it’s all about cash flow and earnings. Qcom 200. Is coming.
"Fast Money , Steve Weiss continues his rant on QCOM : says everyone in the industry distances from their strong arm tactics, AAPL will soon have their modem , etc. I recall Weiss last November singing the blues to Jim Lebenthal because he missed the boat on the semi’s. Weiss would rather have QRVO & SWKS , but I notice that he sold his positions 2 weeks ago : it seems Weiss is a day trader , unlike Jim Lebenthal who is long on QCOM."

QCOM and VNE are on; MAGNA bites the dust. This is a huge positive longer term - price is cheap for 1.5B in revenue. QCOM keeps driving IOT and auto business with 5G synergy. I personally don't care about daily fluctuations on low volume - this is $300 stock longer term

"Kuo speaks about satellite capabilities of the Iphone13 thanks to QCOM modem….Kuo, a longtime and reliable source for Apple features, said in an investor note seen by MacRumors that the iPhone 13 reportedly will be equipped with hardware that can connect low Earth orbit satellites. The hardware in question is said to be a custom Qualcomm X60 baseband chip that supports satellite communications, the outlet stated. It would need to be enabled with specific software features."
"Rich, may not be options, but sure as heck isn't some looming bad news with this volume. I bought some more Leaps... sitting tight. Logic says nothing looming. QCOM is at the center of a digital transformation coming - I expect some volatile action as there are not enough shares for everyone. There are supercomputers that run simulations to find out breaking point for retail based on thousands of factors. I can see they may have hit the mark today! ha ha."

"If this doesn't CRUSH the Apple modem ''CRAPPLE... nothing will... HELLO... $225.00''Apple’s Massive iPhone 13 Upgrade Suddenly Revealed!!!Apple’s iPhone 13 range is nearly here and now new information has revealed one of its most overlooked features may turn out to have the greatest impact. In a new exclusive, Digitimes reports that Apple has massively increased demand for mmWave-compatible 5G modems for its iPhone 13 models. In fact, after previously limiting top tier 5G performance to US-released iPhone 12 Pros, it is now clear Apple is about to deliver a massive 5G performance upgrade for iPhone 13 owners worldwide. “[Apple partner] ASE reportedly has landed a major portion of orders for processing AiP [antenna in package] modules for new mmWave 5G iPhones set for launch later this year,” explains Digitimes, and the crucial part: “...with such models expected to increase to account for 60% of new iPhone shipments, the sources said.”There is both good news and bad news in this revelation. First the bad: sales of iPhone 12 Pro and Pro Max total slightly more than that of the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Mini (primarily due to underwhelming demand for the Mini), which means mmWave is very likely to again be limited to iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max models. But the good news is this means every iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max shipping worldwide should have 5G mmWave compatible modemsSo how fast is mmWave compared to standard 5G? It’s off the charts. While standard 5G offers a healthy boost compared to 4G, the two can often be fairly similar. In contrast, mmWave can hit speeds of up to 3Gbps (3000Mbps) with some tests topping 4Gbps. Availability does remain limited, but these are game-changing speeds far in excess of any normal home broadband connection. What’s more, while the scale of mmWave-compatible iPhone 13 models Apple plans to release is a surprise, we do know exactly what modems these phones will use. Late last year, a settlement filing with Qualcomm revealed Apple’s 5G licensing plans for the next four years. Specifically it states that mmWave-compatible “Apple Products” in 2021 (read: iPhones) will use Qualcomm’s X60 5G modem. And the X60 is exciting. Unlike the X55 used in iPhone 12 Pro models, the X60 can be integrated into a phone’s main chipset which saves space, reduces battery drain and lowers cost (which backs up new iPhone 13 price leaks). It is compatible with 5G networks globally, supports dual sim and can even aggregate both mmWave and standard ‘Sub-6GHz’ (slower, longer range) 5G networks simultaneously to deliver eye watering performance. Combine these gains with the huge camera upgrades, 120Hz ProMotion displays (for Pro models), smaller notch, improved battery life and faster charging and Apple’s global mmWave strategy might just be the cherry on top for potential iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max upgraders. Now the real challenge begins: trying to buy one."

"Translated from Chinese….[Reporter Hong Youfang/Hsinchu] The US chip manufacturer Qualcomm's operating performance is better than expected, and the outlook is also optimistic. It is estimated that the sales volume of 5G mobile phone chips this year will have the opportunity to reach high standards; the semiconductor supply chain pointed out that Qualcomm will invest in TSMC in the second half of the year. The output surpassed MediaTek, with more than 70,000 films in the third and fourth quarters, ranking among the top three major coffee customers. MediaTek’s output in the third quarter was slightly lower than that of Qualcomm, but the output in the fourth quarter was significantly lower than that of Qualcomm. It is obvious that the second half of the year will be the key point for the two major mobile phone chip manufacturers to win the 5G mobile phone chip.Qualcomm announced on Wednesday (28th) the third quarter of fiscal year 2021 revenue report. Quarterly revenue was US$8 billion, an annual increase of 63%, diluted earnings per share was US$1.92, and net profit was US$2.2 billion, a year-on-year increase. 124%, the financial report is better than market expectations.Qualcomm estimates the fourth quarter revenue of 8.4 billion to 9.2 billion U.S. dollars, diluted earnings per share in the range of 2.15 to 2.35 U.S. dollars, chip and software business accounted for 7 billion to 7.5 billion U.S. dollars, patent licensing business (QTL) accounted for 1.45 billion to 1.65 billion US dollars. Qualcomm's forecast for the fourth quarter is better than market expectations. Revenue in 2021 will reach 10 billion US dollars, higher than last year's 6 billion US dollars, and earnings per share will be 8.24 US dollars.Qualcomm expects in the French conference that there will be about 450 million to 550 million 5G mobile phone chips this year. However, due to China's high 5G penetration rate, the sales of 5G mobile phone chips this year have the opportunity to reach high standards, and the total number of 3G, 4G and 5G mobile phone chip products will be sold. The volume will reach high single-digit growth. Qualcomm also said that many manufacturing partners are working hard to strengthen the supply of chips. The first batch of shipments has been obtained last quarter, and there will be more shipments in the next few months. It is expected that the supply of chips will be greatly improved by the end of the year.The supply chain pointed out that Qualcomm was originally put into production at TSMC and was later attracted by the low price of Samsung in South Korea. However, in the first half of this year, Samsung’s advanced process yield and quality were unstable, causing MediaTek, which was put into production at TSMC, to surpass Qualcomm in the Chinese mobile phone chip market. The 7-nanometer manufacturing process put into production at TSMC in the quarter exceeded 70,000 pieces, far surpassing Qualcomm.However, the supply chain revealed that Qualcomm's investment in TSMC in the second half of the year surpassed MediaTek, and the production capacity of 7nm in the third and fourth quarters reached more than 70,000 pieces, which is equivalent to a monthly production capacity of 25,000 pieces, which exceeds the output of MediaTek. In the fourth quarter, it surpassed MediaTek by a large margin. TSMC does not comment on customer rumors. The supply chain believes that the output of the two competitors in the foundry is a reference indicator for the decisive battle in the second half of the year."

"Samsung's Latest Foldables Show Benefits Of Refinements As seen in many major tech innovations, it often takes several rounds of refinements to really make it big. With the debut of their third-generation Galaxy Z Fold3 5G as well as the Galaxy Z Flip3 5G, Samsung is hoping to make a much more significant impact on the market and drive wider acceptance of the foldable category in general. The key point with these third-generation models, both of which are powered by Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon 888 SOC, is refinements in important areas that real-world consumers care about, including things like durability, weight, size and, for the Flip3, screen size.If you look back at the history of many important tech product introductions, an interesting pattern tends to emerge. Even products that - at their debut - seemed to be remarkable breakthroughs often didn’t really make their true value and presence felt until a few iterations in. The original iPhone (AAPL), for example, only sold just over a million units, and frankly, was a bit clunky to use. Two years later, the iPhone 3GS sold almost 40 million units and had started to evolve into the hugely impactful device we now understand it to be.Foldable phones and Samsung’s (SSNLF) Galaxy Z line, in particular, look to be following a conceptually similar path. The initial Galaxy Fold device - despite its early manufacturing challenges - was seen to be an extremely innovative, breakthrough design that portended the future of mobile computing and communications devices. Initial sales of the first generation were relatively modest, however - not a huge surprise given its original $1,980 price point. With the debut of their third-generation Galaxy Z Fold3 5G as well as the Galaxy Z Flip3 5G, however, Samsung is hoping to make a much more significant impact on the market and drive wider acceptance of the foldable category in general.The key point with these third-generation models, both of which are powered by Qualcomm’s (QCOM) latest Snapdragon 888 SOC, is refinements in important areas that real-world consumers care about, including things like durability, weight, size and, for the Flip3, screen size. At first glance, both the Fold3 and Flip3 look relatively similar to their predecessors, but as you start to dig into the details, you can see that Samsung managed to shave a bit of size and thickness off the Fold2. Much of this was driven by the company’s use of a new lightweight, more rugged version of aluminum that Samsung is calling Armour Aluminum for the main frame of the device. In addition, Samsung added IPX8 waterproofing - meaning it can handle up to 30 minutes of submersion under water and still function - to both devices, making them more durable in day-to-day use.For the internal foldable screens, the new Z Fold and Z Flip have a more robust covering that the company says will make them up to 80% more durable than previous models. In addition, the outer screens of both devices are using Corning’s (GLW) Gorilla Glass Victus, their latest iteration. Taken as a whole, these durability refinements keep the devices from being perceived as “delicate” and should make people feel more comfortable using them just as they do any other mobile phone (that is to say, probably pretty roughly).Each device also features screen-related enhancements designed to improve the overall experience of using them. In the case of the Flip3, its cover screen is four times larger than its predecessor, making it much easier to see notifications, preview photos, etc. On the Fold3, Samsung integrated an under-display camera on the main panel, allowing the entire 7.6” screen to be used for content, applications, etc. without any visual distractions.Another important refinement for this round of devices is enabling functionality that many have wished for since the first generation. In the case of the Fold3, in particular, the ability to support pen input, for example, really starts to make the company’s claims of it being a multi-mode device more tenable. Unfortunately, Samsung isn’t bundling a pen with the Fold3 and, because there’s no place to hold one, you’ll need to purchase a case designed to hold the phone and the pen if you want to use it all the time. Still, it’s a big step forward for the Fold line and really starts to put a question around the future of Samsung’s popular Galaxy Note line of phones. To be clear, Samsung has said it will continue to produce more iterations of the Note, but it’s hard to miss the fact that the Fold3 is being introduced at the same time of year that the Note line has been introduced in the past. Coincidence? I think not...In fact, it seems Samsung wants to encourage its large body of loyal Note users - who have typically always seen themselves as cutting-edge techno"

"It has been nearly a year since we first unearthed the Snapdragon-powered Chrome OS tablet that goes by the code name ‘Coachz’. Since that time, Robby has committed to finding every single detail he could about this exciting little detachable, and now, we believe we have a device to go with his discoveries. During HP’s virtual press event last week, the Chromebook giant finally took the wraps off of the company’s new detachable Chromebook X2 11. If you remember, HP actually launched the first-ever detachable Chromebook in the form of the 12.3″ Chromebook X2. This model came rocking Intel’s 7th Gen mobile processors. This was the predecessor to the 8th Gen mobile chip found in Google’s base model Pixelbook. Anyway, enough of the history lesson. The original X2 was a solid device with an amazing display but it failed to be great at being a tablet or a laptop and therefore, faded away.Thankfully, HP has an eye on the Chrome OS market and the company is back with an ARM-based reiteration of the X2 and this one comes in the form of an 11″ tablet that features Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 7c Compute Platform, a detachable keyboard, and a segment-first wirelessly charging USI pen that mounts to the side of the device. This lines up with Robby’s discovery of reverse wireless charging found on the ‘Coachz’ board and while it won’t charge your accessories, it will charge the included pen. Before we dive into the details of the device, check out these pics. This Chromebook is gorgeous. Seriously."
"Earlier this month, China Mobile announced the tender results of its network expansion and capacity-building plans for 2021 and 2022, including procurements of key 5G related equipment. Significantly, Huawei was not awarded any of the contracts while Qualcomm and its joint venture partners reportedly won half the orders for 320,000 5G modem sets. China Mobile’s procurement of modem-to-antenna multimode devices from Qualcomm aims to accelerate the carrier’s 5G rollout across the nation, according to local media reports. Tencent News and the Shanghai-based National Business Daily reported that Huawei was frozen out due to its “inferior equipment performance.” ￼The publications reported that Qualcomm’s cutting-edge X55 5G Modem-RF System powered by TSMC-made 7-nanometer chips would support multi-band, ultrafast connections."

"Kingspellchecker, absent of any news, I don’t see a break into the $150’s whereas this would trade $150-155 for another month to say five weeks. I hope I’m wrong, but if this goes south to $138-140, then it will be very difficult for this to even get to $155 prior to the next earnings. In general, I don’t believe there will be any significant news to have Qualcomm go on any independent monster run. In the last six month, there has only been one day, just one day, that this has finished up over 5% which was day after earnings, being 6%. I mentioned a while back that for this to have any meaningful run, it needs to have a triple effect as up 4.5%, then 3.5%, then 2% to show momentum. Basically, it’s been incapable of gaining any interest to do this. If this is only at $150 prior to earnings, they do $2.55 which is the number I have, and it only moves up to say $160, then I don’t believe it gets higher then $170 even after analyst day and nothing has really changed in terms of PE multiple expansion because estimates being raised along with earnings beats will be lock step to keep this at a lowly forward PE of 16X."

"Uh, Kingspellchecker, Nvidia did not blow it out of the water, beat barely on EPS and sales by 3%. When Qualcomm reported those numbers that were similar in Q1 at $2.17 vs $2.10, the stock plummeted massively.

"From Jensen in the NVIDIA call yesterday. Technology is red hot - GPUs driving AI and 5G driving connectivity to the cloud (intelligent edge).(Jensen below)At the highest level, the important thing to realize is that artificial intelligence is the single greatest technology force that the computer industry has ever seen and potentially the world has ever seen. The automation opportunities which drives productivity, which translates directly to the cost savings of the companies is enormous. And it opens up opportunities for technology and computing companies like it's never happened before.The fact that we can apply so much technology to warehouse logistics, retail automation, customer call center automation is really quite unprecedented. The fact that we could automate truck driving and last-mile delivery providing an automated chauffeur, those services and benefits and products are never imaginable before. So the size of the IT industry, if you will, the industry that computer companies like ourselves are part of has expanded tremendously."

"Greg, yes, on the call he said one thing and on this he said another:Qualcomm Sees Path Out of Chip Shortage Stretching Into 2022Mentioned: QCOMBy Asa Fitch Qualcomm Inc. says its get-them-where-you-can approach to navigating the global semiconductor shortage is working, though the mobile-phone chip giant sees the supply crunch lasting into next year. Qualcomm, which supplies key circuitry in almost a third of new 5G handsets, has managed to secure more capacity at outside manufacturers where it has its chips made, Chief Executive Officer Cristiano Amon said in an interview. In some cases the company says it is having multiple vendors produce the same type of chip to boost its supply. Demand for Qualcomm's products, however, is still outstripping its ability to supply them, Mr. Amon said as the company posted quarterly earnings Wednesday. Chief Financial Officer Akash Palkhiwala said he expects that Qualcomm is ""going to be constrained into early 2022, and then I think there's a lot of [chip-making] investments being put into place, so that by the time we get to the second half we'll be in a better place than we are."" The supply strains are showing little sign of hurting the company financially. Strong interest in 5G phones, especially in China, led Qualcomm to suggest that sales of 5G phones this year would be biased toward the upper end of an earlier forecast of 450 million to 550 million devices. The upbeat outlook came even as Apple Inc., a major Qualcomm customer, warned Tuesday that supply constraints would extend to its smartphones during the three-month period ending in September. Qualcomm reported revenue of $8.1 billion for its fiscal third quarter, ending in June. The sales exceeded a $7.5 billion consensus projection from analysts surveyed by FactSet and surpassed the company's own guidance. The company also said sales in the current quarter could reach $9.2 billion, which would be a record and ahead of Wall Street expectations. As the company tries to capture the growing 5G handset market, Mr. Amon, who was named to the top job in January and formally took over as CEO last month, said it was also increasingly becoming more than just a phone-chip company. The company is on pace to deliver $10 billion of annual revenue from non-handset businesses, including those focused on the automotive sector and internet-of-things devices, he said. Net profit of about $2 billion for the quarter was more than double the figure in the year-ago period and beat Wall Street expectations. Qualcomm is at the center of a chip-supply crunch that has shaved billions of dollars off auto makers' revenues, raised prices for consumer electronics and spread to an increasing number of industries.

""We believe that fears of losing chip sales to Apple (AAPL) are manageable and QCOM faces numerous growth opportunities,"" added DA Davidson."

Qualcomm the innovator behind satellite communications on your cell phone. That is a catalyst when it is officially announced.
They had some interesting insights about QCOM on (http://Rightpicker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"Just to clear the air, even if Google uses its own AP processor, don't forget that the modem will likely be from QCOM. Say, the modem is also from someone else, even then QCOM will get its fair share of licensing revenue.Most importantly how many units does Google sell in its pixel line? What's their chip cost? Would it be better than QCOM's price? If more pricier, who will bear the difference?For me, what's most important is QCOM's future guidance and despite knowing about Googles plans, they guided solidly. Not a time to be scared of."

"Uh Mike, the global star announcement is basically confirmed in which the Apple 13 phone is using a low earth orbit satellite chip from Qualcomm. As demonstrated though, we see the investment community doesn’t see any major significance to Qualcomm, which we all know by now is par for the course."
Disappointing day.....my mistake as I was looking at MRVL and QCOM for 5G investment back in Feb....its hindsight but MRVL would have been a much better investment....seems like QCOM gets no respect no matter how good of an earning or stream of good news....ohhh well such is life...
"Cristiano Amon Report Card:1) Educate the investor community that QCOM is more than handsets * His slide on IOT with the release was excellent. If you haven't seen it, take a look. Breaks out IOT to the three areas and provides some color. Investors love this stuff. * He delivered 30% QoQ growth and outlined how IOT is growing faster than handsets AND that IOT is expanding the margin profile.2) Provide a view into 2022 to help build a better valuation* He did provide a little color into 2022...but we need to wait for Nov for the full impact of this event. At which time I would expect the second shoe to fall and get us to a much better valuation.3) Execute* He did this with flying colors. The management of the supply chain, re-working SOCs to available chips, building markets in China and India... working with companies like Accenture are all examples. Cristiano is driving 5G early and expanding the market quickly. A+++. This company has great management and execution and that can't be overstated. It is one thing to have the opportunity, but another to execute flawlessly."

"Yeah, I kinda don’t care about conferences these days, they don’t mean anything other then rehashed info Amon gave from the earnings call. What else new can he say? The market has punished Qualcomm for great earnings again. There is no news to be had that will propel the stock higher at this point. Its PE is contracting which clearly tells us the market doesn’t believe in growth that is worth their investment. It is not a stock looked at for its earnings as the mindset is that they don’t believe in sustainable earnings and I absolutely believe the Apple modem issue is playing somewhat of a role as well. It’s the lowest forward PE semiconductor stock with only Intel being worse. Its definitely going back to $132-133 if the market or Nasdaq goes down 4-5% from here, no question about it. People here talk about people not knowing who Qualcomm is, and I call bull  on this. The big money knows exactly who they are and doesn’t believe in any growth story, period."

"Also, don't let these short term market fluctuations based on bonds/stimulus/etc. worry anyone. Just like the 10 year treasury scare - they will pass. Tech is red hot right now and showing no signs of easing as industries are seeing new efficiencies in transforming to AI and 5G - either they transform or competitors who do will pass them by. As it relates to QCOM, watch the volume... these down days have no volume (neither did the up days). Once volume increases, then that is worthy of watching. This stock can go up or down very quickly as we have seen. It is good to be in very undervalued stocks during these corrections - so sit tight and wait it out or use some dry powder on the side to play the swings."
Please be Noted that AVAGO is all time high. AVAGO technology is so old and not productive compare to QCOM.
"Big, I’m what you would call a frustrated bull. If Qualcomm winds up doing $2.55 this quarter and guides for $2.80 next quarter, there is no way they will guide under $10 for 2022, more likely $10-10.50, and then they will actually do $11.10 up to the very high end of say $11.75. If they do $2.55 this quarter, they’re actual numbers for the following quarter should be $2.90-3.10, Q1"
QCOM has gone 3x since Feb 2019 and will go 2x-3x in the next couple years. High conviction investment for me. Longs will be rewarded here. Don't let Rich get to you with pointless chatter and mood swings. No credibility.
I love this aggressive strategy. EVs are hot - goal of half of Autos sold in U.S. by 2030 will be EV. Instead of low margin chip sales - QCOM is seeking to expand margins by selling the solutions. Enough of this competing in Semis! We will use our IP and build the solutions ourselves. Ha! Love it.
"Stefanos, you have to be the biggest punk on this board running your mouth at me on every turn, even when I’m breaking down earnings numbers that are very close to what they wind up being quarter over quarter. I met with 5 Qualcomm employees last weekend and I can tell you they are feeling like it’s no different in the way the investment community has treated this company then 2008-2019. In other words, even they have no confidence in their stock, but say the company is doing great. Now you may sit here and say I’m making this up, don’t know anybody at the company or whatever, but I’m telling the truth. They know the market doesn’t like their story"

"Some modelling for QCOM FY 2022, (this is largely based on listening carefully to what Cristiano Amon and other QCOM officials have been saying lately).Some comments are especially intended for Kingspellchecker and Rich.King and Rich, I arrive at pretty similar forecast compared to you, though achieved in a slightly different way than King:My assumptions:1) Non handset QCT: In general I'm more conservative here than King, assuming FY22 sales of 14,84B, predicting less growth in IoT, and probably more in RFFE. RFFE grows because it is coupled with handset growth, taking market share, and more mmWave.2) Handset QCT: Here I am more aggressive, reason mainly being that the Huawei void that needs to be filled (the 10B SAM windfall that C Amon talks about, I assume that a bit over half will go to QCOM). This is just starting, and will inflate that QCT handset revenue to 20,6B in FY22. A contributing reason is also promising data on I-phone 13, including mmWave.Also, recently, there has come in more seasonality that historically, especially in QCOMs handset business (in large part because of the i-phone business) resulting in the past quarter, calendar q2, being the weakest, and calendar q4 being the strongest. This will make next 2 quarters very impressive!3) QTL; modest growth to 6,8B from this year 6,4B.4) I am assuming a margin around 30%, mainly because of higher volume, combined with a slightly better mix and a slight dropoff in the handset margin towards the end of next fiscal year (slight price erosion needed to keep market share)5) General: In the current quarter, Semicon supply chain issues persist, but are well managed by QCOM, next quarter they start easing.THE RESULT (BUSD except EPS in $/share)Quarter Total QCT Handset Non-Handset RFFE Auto IoT QTL Total* EPSFY21Q4 7,81 4,80 3,01 1,15 0,31 1,55 1,65 9,49 2,50FY22Q1 8,73 5,40 3,33 1,28 0,35 1,70 1,75 10,51 2,78FY22Q2 8,64 5,10 3,54 1,25 0,38 1,90 1,68 10,35 2,65FY22Q3 8,57 4,80 3,77 1,19 0,43 2,15 1,65 10,25 2,70FY22Q4 9,50 5,30 4,20 1,32 0,48 2,40 1,77 11,30 3,10 FY21 tot 27,09 16,95 10,14 4,07 1,01 5,06 6,41 33,63 8,49FY22 tot 35,44 20,60 14,84 5,04 1,65 8,15 6,85 42,43 11,23After FY-22, I expect revenue growth to be around 15%/year, the bulk of it being non handset. EPS growth around 20%/year,So, where does this take the stock price? My hunch is that by July 2022, a forward PE of 25 may bring the PPS to about 280.Wonderful stock to own right now!"

"Optimism is supreme here as it should be about 5G mmWave. Bruce’s numbers about how many phones is correct. This will take effect in the stock price, I just can’t say it will be next week for sure. The market has ignored what Amano indicated at the earnings call so far when he discussed the multiplier. I would welcome a big up week starting tomorrow, but wouldn’t at all be surprised if the stock continues trading on low volume in this range of $145-152 for who knows how long."

If Kuo is correct QCOM is poised to become an essential cog in the supply chain for any company wanting to share in the huge new worldwide wireless satellite telco market - at least to be on its leading edge. It sounds like QCOM has first mover edge. Combined with the huge increase in bandwidth offered by QCOM 5G it feels like QCOM is poised to become the IOT biggest player.I believe algo programs have limited the markets positive reaction to the obvious bullish strategic position into which QCOM has maneuvered and that natural market forces will soon make long term QCOM holders very very happy. At its current level of $145/shareQCOM is takeover bait.I have followed QCOM since George Gilder's initial recommendation years ago and still believe he understands the very complex semiconductor market well enough to produce salient advice. Taiwan is the potential fly in the ointment for QCOM's near term future and that is limited only to the extent they depend on TSM.Historymaven
"Listening to NVIDIA CC. Amazing, analysts asking how they can synch their comments of supply constraint and yet guide to sequential growth across all lines of business. Good question, the answer is the big guys are getting most of the supply due to leverage. QCOM included. Tech is exploding, 5G is driving demand - supply is constrained BECAUSE of demand."

Clearly this shows how poor a stock in Qualcomm is. It will see that gap fill by tomorrow at $142.44. Should be down $5 today
"Some people on this board are very short sighted, noting the strong valuations of companies like Marvell and NVIDIA. One needs to ask themselves why their valuations are high - the answer is they are in either the Datacenter (high margins) or Edge (Cloud). QCOM has quietly signed a deal with Foxconn a few weeks ago to partner with them on an AI Accelerator box called ""Gloria"" using QCOM's new Cloud AI 100 designed for AI inference acceleration. They have their first customer BKAV - releasing products next year.Nguyen Tu Quang, Chairman & CEO, BKAV. “Gloria will support us to accelerate AI applications in businesses and government, and revolutionize our work with smart cities, smart construction, and agriculture, among other verticals.” QCOM is one of the few - if not the only - company going up against NVIDIA's AI technology. Believe it or not, the Cloud AI 100 has 3 times better latency and lower power than NVIDIA. Now, NVIDIA has a large portfolio of products and use cases vary, etc. However, QCOM has the premier 5G Sub-6 and mmWAVE WAN connectivity options that go along with their solutions. This development is worth paying attention to if you are a QCOM long investor. There are rumors of a very large ""Cloud"" customer buying the Gloria solution, when looking at TCO and 5G applications - QCOM/Gloria will have an advantage over NVIDIA! Going back to some previous posts I have had explaining what Jensen said during their last ER about the rapid expansion of AI (Doubling every 2 months), it is worth watching. It also will be a VERY high margin product for QCOM. I expect we will learn more in the coming months - and especially on Nov 16th. It is clear that there is a digital industrial revolution happening and AI & 5G is at the center - Jensen said it is the biggest thing he has ever seen. So for now, QCOM is still being valued as a mobile chip set company, but for those paying attention - they can clearly see that is very short lived. QCOM will be a behemoth in the new Digital Industrial Revolution."
"Analyst Day in November is very critical. Everyone is in the dark until then and can only take bits and pieces to try and forecast what FY22 will look like for QCOM. Below I made some assumptions based on bits and pieces and trends for a conservative perspective of what FY22 can look like.Assumptions:Handset QTL Growth = 8% (they said high single digits). Non-Handset QTL Growth = 40% (based on a Q over Q increase of 10%). Room for surprise here.QTL Growth = 5% (Really NO visibility and this could be very conservative)They said non-handset revenue for this quarter will end with $10B for the year. Doing that math, that puts this line at about $2,869B and I calculated $1.6B for IOT of that - rest Auto/RF. With the above assumptions - FY22 Top Line Rev:Handset Rev = 18,200B, Non-Handset = $16,708B, QTL= $6,864BTotal FY22 Revenue = $41,773B (This year, assuming high end of range Q4 = $33,276)YoY Revenue Growth = 20% (Analyst per Yahoo have FY22 average at $35B)Margin Expansion is the REALLY big unknown and I am not going to calculate it here - maybe later. However, they definitely indicated that margin will continue to expand on QCT (right now 27% - 29%). Probably fair to say they plan to get into low to mid-30% in QCT for ending FY22. Probably looking for $11 -$12 next year ... but REALLY hard to say without any guidance on margin expansion. With a VERY conservative forward PE of 17. PPS would be $190 to $200 to finish the year and mid-way through next year with similar growth and expansion (remember auto will be kicking in big)... $250 by June/July. With ANY improvement in valuation which should come after Analyst Day - we should be seeing a forward PE of 30! This would be the upside for sure and put PPS at $330 - $350.Summary - Mid-June next year this should be trading somewhere between $250 and $350 depending on valuation given for the growth and especially margin expansion."
VNE is a spectacular acquisition. Even if the public doe not like the tracking of the miles you drive the governments will force it on the public.

"Marvell, a 5G stock did it again today, 52 week high. This is all about a lower PE due to Apple fears and will stay this way until they start doing 45-50% growth in those other business segments other than cell phones. Marvell has a forward PE of 40X by the way, "
"Ok I’ll admit, I’m a bull. This earnings call (and the last one) was phenomenal. I had a few options but I’m buying waaaay more. A stock with good growth earning $1.92 should EASILY be trading for $192. That’s 25x earnings. But Qualcomm has great growth and expanding margins! If we are going to be earning $10B/year this should be a $300B company. I think $300/share is growth at a reasonable price, so I’m buying a boatload of those long term $200 options for a few dollars. Wish me luck, or better yet, join me!!!"
What a great buying opportunity. They are buying a high growth company at 2-3 X revenue WITH CASH and stock has dropped 1-2%.
"140.99 is the 200DMA according to stock charts, $141.61 50DMA. This is where this will test next should the market continue south. After that, you’re looking at $138 for next support. I would not be surprised to see the stock back to $138 if the Nasdaq corrects another 3%. There is a gap on the upside at $148.13 from the close on August 13th. It will get back there ONLY if the overall market goes up to take it with it. Remember, this stock is incapable of separating itself to go up on bad market days while other semis go down. In fact, people here tak about how it went from $60 to $168 but that was the covid low. Prior to covid, this was at $90 and it’s earnings will have grown over 100% once they do $2.55 this quarter as last year they did $4.19. This means Qualcomm’s stock has massively underperformed as it should be in the least, $180 right now just to keep up with year over year growth. The reason it hasn’t? Easy, PE contraction, and on a big level I might add. The market is discounting heavily the future of Qualcomm growth which means the Apple modem situation. This is the only explanation"

"One reason PE is lagging is due to perception and valuation of QCOM as a handset chip company. This is largely lower margin products and very cyclical. As Rich points out often, there could be some Apple overhang as well. What is interesting, is that QCOM is quickly building share in higher margin products - USING THE SAME products that are in phones. This strategy is largely leveraging R&D $$ while expanding and diversifying. Soon, their share of revenue from non-handsets will exceed that of handsets (but with largely the same silicon!). It is really a genius strategy that is proving to be very successful as we have seen IOT and Auto revenues increase QoQ - while margins expand. I believe the inflection point of valuation to a higher margin high growth company operating in now the hyperscale or intelligent edge space (selling to Cloud providers) will be seen during the Analyst Day Nov 16. Now is the time to accumulate shares for that event.With regard to the day to day share price - it really doesn't matter at this point unless you are looking for an entry position or playing options. Rich will keep you up to speed on the day to day - but when it comes to his predictions be very careful. Remember it was just last Thursday when he posted """"Under no circumstances will this close above the 50DMA which is $141.90"""" ...ever since then, it has. It is very hard to predict when large positions will begin to enter which can be rapid movement in pps."
"Mike, for Qualcomm to make a good move next week, let’s say up 4% for the week, it is going to need a rally of the overall market. The volume dictates slow money coming in, but the truth is, we need an up day of like 3% to get momentum in the stock on like 10 million shares or more. This stock is incapable of going up 3% when the overall market is flat and of course when it’s down. Stocks like AMD & Nvidia muscle up against whatever the overall market does, Qualcomm doesn’t. Sure it will outpace the market like today here and there, but to see any momentum, what I said above needs to start happening. If a run were to happen, I think $156-157 would be tops before a minor pullback because the RSI would get to 73-74 which is overbought and even though AMD & Nvidia trade up to RSI levels of 80, Qualcomm again is incapable of doing this. I believe it could, but won’t happen until Q4 earnings are announced"
"Marc, the only time the stock has gone up 15-20% in a two week period was only upon earnings announcements last year. It’s never gone up like that in a two week timeframe unless significant news was behind it. It won’t do this unless of some news event, no way otherwise or not a chance"
"Kingspellchecker, great analysis on your numbers and in fact I too think $42 billion, your numbers are just shy of $42 billion. They will finish this year at $33.3 billion this year and in doing so, they need to guide as a median for 15% sales growth, which would be $38 billion, knowing they’ll get close to $42 billion which is 26% y/y sales growth, huge. On the EPS side, and knowing they will have margin expansion, they should guide for a median of $10.50 knowing they will do $11.50-12. This would still be conservative as you know. In terms of a 30X forward PE, I don’t believe this will ever happen with this stock. For example, if they were to guide for $10.50 vs finishing this year at $8.54, 23% y/y growth, along with 15% guidance on sales growth, they’ll get a forward PE of like 19X. That’s just my opinion but I don’t see the market ever giving them a 1/1 ratio on EPS future growth vs forward PE. They’ll always give a less forward PE with this stock then the growth rate"
"Greg/Kingspellchecker, this information should have already been known as far as IPhone 13mmWave launch this fall. I knew it because I work in this industry. I won’t say more then this because of a public forum but I’ve known this specific information for the past 4 months, which is why I rant so much about the stock price."
"Big, I had said all along that Qualcomm getting to $152 depends on what the overall market does and this was correct. This is a stock incapable of trading independent of other semis in a large % difference on any given day unlike Nvidia or AMD. The stock remains terrible still, will change soon though. I won’t define soon as the market does not like this company still."
"Amon is doing everything he can but give next years guidance at this point or raise Q4 numbers on a pre-announcement in early to Mid October which he wouldn’t do even if they were to know they were going to do $2.75 for example. The investment community does not believe him right now. I’m not being pessimistic and by the stock valuation, it’s obvious they don’t. This is going to take another trip lower, even if it’s up tomorrow."
"Hehe, although Mollenkopf and Amon are both engineers, Amon is a much better story teller in that his delivery is much more of a salesperson. It will materialize and then you’ll stop talking about buybacks as what is needed to drive the price higher."

Ex-Dividend day tomorrow. 0.65 $ per share. Payment day 23 September.
Let me ask something I’m genuinely curious about. Why is QCOM such an awesome company but getting a much lower valuation than everything else?
"QCOM almost always beats analysts earnings estimates. Lets say QCOM surprises and reports $2,50. That's $10 this year. x 22 and we are at $220. Simple math."
"High self esteem company but a low self esteem stock, everybody agree?"
"Outperforming other semis, I like this. I don’t mind the RSI being brought down a few points off of $1 drop as the big up day volume days will have it go up at a slower rate. This from a technical point of view of course"

"Marc, you’re completely wrong, the 200DMA is $141.08.https://stockcharts.com/h-sc/ui?s=QCOM"
"Solid day all in all. Down a tad on low volume. $150’s should print, although the 8/20 op-ex may peg it to $150. We should break-out by next week. Too cheap down here."
"First of all thank you to KingSpellChecker for the great analysis you do.If QCOM usually beats estimates we can expect well over $2 per quarter from now on so about $10 per year total. According to BigCharts, right now the PE is on the low side and a more normal PE is about 22 for this stock. $10 x 22 = $220. That is my 12 month price target and I’m ignoring all the other noise."
"Can anyone see Google's chip as a threat? Making there own chip and even if they do, they will still have to pay licensing fees when it connects to QCOM tech, this drop on propaganda styled news is engineered to stall the PPS rise what a jokeJMHO / FWIWGoogle has low expectations from Pixel 4a and Pixel 5 salesLast year, Google sold 7.2 million Pixel smartphones.

"And if AAPL wins we win too…. A new report from China said that Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone sales in the country bounced back in July, an upbeat sign for the company in what it one of its most-important sales regions. According to the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology, iPhone sales in China averaged 2.8 million units a week in July, a 75% increase over the same month a year ago, and a complete reversal from the 15% year-over-year sales decline that took place in June. JP Morgan analyst Samik Chatterjee said in a research note that the data from China bodes well for Apple, and the entire mobile phone industry, which he said grew shipments by 12% between June and July. ""The industry overall showed strong trends as well,"" Chatterjee said. ""The comparison of the trends between Apple and industry volumes indicates that Apple continues to gain share."""
"What things will the insecure little man post today? Will he insult people of other beliefs/genders/politics or just stick to his decades old grudge with QCOM? Whatever it is, it will surely be an embarrassment"
"Joseph, I think Akinzo point is if for example, you look at AMD, why are they up more then Qualcomm? AMD was up 6% yesterday and another 6.56% today! It gets PE expansion with ease"

"Snapdragon 895 to arrive later this year with upgraded GPUThere is still a while before the next Qualcomm Snapdragon processor makes its debut. But like for everything else in the industry, the rumors regarding the upcoming Snapdragon 895 are preceding its release. According to the recent information by way of a social media update from Lenovo China’s General Manager Chen Jin, the forthcoming Snapdragon 895 will have a “greatly upgraded GPU.”https://androidcommunity.com/snapdragon-895-to-arrive-later-this-year-with-upgraded-gpu-20210826/"

"Ara, Qualcomm should earn $11.15-11.30 for 2022. The question is what kind of forward valuation will they give. I believe Qualcomm will do $2.50-2.60 this upcoming quarter. Basically, if they finish this year at say $8.55, I would hope they guide better then conservative where they guide as a median range of $10. I believe the investment community will know they are sandbagging even that number and re-rate the forward PE to say 18.5-19X by or before years end. The math of course plays out to $185-190 as you know. It’s possible for sure, especially if there is any whisper by October timeframe that supply constraints are lessening. In this instance, the stock could be around its 52 week high at earnings or even a few weeks prior to where it consolidates in the $160-167 range going into the Q4 numbers. After that and analyst day, it would see plausible to rally 10-15% to end the year, so essentially $176-$192 area. This depends on the market doing fine from here on for the rest of the year and some positive news about supply constraints in the next couple months. I’m confident they’ll do $2.50 minimum as I believe they’ll do $9.2-9.4 billion in the quarter as well. Despite the supply concerns, Qualcomm seems to be getting better priority in getting more supply then their guidance has been indicating as of the last couple quarters have illustrated"
"QCOM just can't hold its high on virtually any given day regardless of the positive news; until the chip ""shortage"" is resolved, QCOM will probably just meander from the low 140s to maybe 150ish."
"Option prices telling the story here, the ask is way inflated this morning. I think this goes through the 150s as if it was ether. We have seen the bottom... the gap was kind of filled based on Yahoo's error. Ha ha. I am not one to talk about daily PPS, but I have to say that indications are this needs to move up quickly. I believe Amon is making calls and BOD likely tasked him with a goal to achieve some decent valuation from the investment community. The QCOM paper out there on how 5G is going to save and drive the economy is evidence of this. QCOM becomes a wallstreet darling is my prediction. Just need some patience."
This satellite option takes care of the telecom coverage issue. Game changer for modern day communications. In remote areas.
"I believe Google announcements are meant to take away questions about poor Pixel competitiveness in the marketplace. Just looking at Pixel 5 5G specs - about to be released on 26th - completely obliterated by the Chinese makers, Apple, Sammy. And it runs on older 7nm Snapdragon. Who will want it - other than getting it free and even then. This product is not just mediocre, it's plain non-competitive."

"Apple is expected to significantly increase its pull-ins of components shipments for new iPhones in the second half of the year, driven by its impressive growth in market share in China for high-end 5G models, according to industry sources.The US vendor's share of China's US$800 and above handset market segment shot up to 72% in first-quarter 2021, compared to Huawei's 24%, the sources cited an IDC report as indicating.Apple's latest financial statements also showed its second-quarter 2021 revenues for iPhones jumped 49.7% on year to US$39.57 billion, and its total shipments to the China market expanded nearly 60% on year, compared to a 10% decline in sales of China-made handsets, indicating relatively strong consumption momentum for high-end handsets in China, the sources said.The sources stressed Apple has benefited the most from Huawei quitting the high-end handset segment, as it has far outperformed Samsung and other Chinese vendors Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi in snatching market shares for smartphones valued at US$600-800 or higher over the past months.Now that 5G handset penetration in markets beyond China is still under 30%, Apple is sharply boosting its production of mmWave 5G iPhones in the second half of the year for non-China markets while seeking to cement or further boost its market shares in China, the sources indicated."

Can’t wait for the analysts to reassess and just upgrade above 200 bucks.
"Kingspellchecker, everybody knows, I’ve been a suffering soul, of my own making I might add as to the lack of upside performance of the stock. Trust me, I really don’t want this to go to $140. I don’t know what was said at the Canacord call, and I see Baird is high on the stock with a $200 target. I’d like to see a move to $157-160 before any minor pullback of say 3%. In this scenario, my guess is that the stock is around $164-$167 day of earnings in October. I would then expect a small move to $170-173 after they report and who knows, maybe $190 sometime at or before years end. I’m not sure how much analyst day could really move the stock up in one day if it’s already had a big run prior to."

However, consider this - if you look at the average analyst targets for MRVL which is $62.00 (may go up slightly after their ER). Would you want to enter that position now? The stock is trading in that area. Sure they are doing well and will grow more, but ...not the kind of stock I am looking for.

"What I think is the biggest joke on this board is when people talk about options keeping the price down. First off, go look at the weekly options for the next 3-4 weeks for example on Qualcomm and there isn’t  in terms of open interest with respect to volume on either side. Secondly, as I’ve explained, there is an average of $1.1 billion of dollars or 8 million shares being traded each day. You’re gonna tell me that the liquidity of options being $3 million between strike prices of $144-$150 are controlling the price of calls in this case (same on put side) for options expiring tomorrow for example? You’re full of  if you think that is how it works and need to stop investing. Options never control a stock like this or any other large or medium cap for that matter."

Earnings do not matter for this company because the market sees something else out there it doesn’t like. Nvidia flat today off those numbers. Something is wrong folks, very wrong"
"I don’t know why people here are surprised about how bad this stock continues to be. I believe in what management says, and so I’m staying in. On the other hand, the institutions don’t believe in the company’s growth chatter. One thing that looms is that the stock is still down $20 off it’s 52 week high with incredible earnings last two quarters while it’s peers are not surprising as much and much closer to their 52 week highs. Nobody here seems to be a bit concerned about this but the investment community is reluctant about something they don’t think is going to materialize."

"With the VNE acquisition which is great by the way, to say analysts don’t understand it is not accurate in my opinion. As usual, with the market, it doesn’t see bearing fruits for a couple years with respect to growth momentum that will also help to accelerate earnings. Again, this comes down to full year guidance on what Amon has to say at the Q4 call for 2022. If he guides for 15% sales growth and 20% earnings growth, then the forward PE will initially trade at 18-20X as the market will know it’s more like 20% sales growth and 25% minimum on EPS growth for 2022. As we get into 2022 and they continue beating their original guidance, the forward PE will creep up, but I don’t believe it will ever match the actual growth rate in terms of EPS or future EPS growth rate."
"Hehe, did you listen to the earnings conference call? The CEO DID defend the Apple modem issue. I admit, I complain a lot about this stock but put metrics behind the numbers in doing so.

"Huawei spinoff Honor secures Qualcomm backing for new phonesChina's Honor, the former budget brand of Huawei Technologies, launched its first smartphone geared for the global market on Thursday since being spun off from its embattled parent to skirt U.S. export controls on vital components.Honor's Magic 3 series will use Qualcomm's Snapdragon 888 Plus 5G Mobile Platform, the U.S. chipmaker's top-of-the-line mobile processor.Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon, in a recorded video message welcoming the new phone, applauded the collaboration of his company's chipset and Honor's new phone as a ''perfect combination.''https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/China-tech/Huawei-spinoff-Honor-secures-Qualcomm-backing-for-new-phones"
In 2019 QCOM acquired RF360 stake for $3.5B now 2 years later that RF business generates revenues of almost $1B/quarter and is the fastest growing segment with 100+% Y/Y revenue growth. The same thing will happen with VNE if not even better 2 years out when ADAS and autonomous driving become more prominent in new cars. Plus QCOM was already working with VNE on Arriver software.
"Kingspellchecker, Amon said supply constraints would be loosening up nicely for them at the end of the year here, which he was really talking about October-December timeframe. Yet, is Nvidia saying this is not the case for them and that it will be rough for them to end the year? Why do they get a pass on supply constraints as far as their stock goes but Qualcomm doesn’t? You mention you think it’s supply constraints as to why Qualcomm stays down but it doesn’t affect Nvidia stock? Don’t take this as offense cause it’s not directed at you but you can’t have it both ways without realizing something else is wrong here with Qualcomm. Qualcomm margins are fine enough and in fact improved quarter over quarter from their last call so what gives? It doesn’t really seem like a margin problem for Qualcomm"
"Kajalod, of course it closed near the lows of the day, I guess you haven’t been involved in Qualcomm for the past 8 months."
Can anyone explain the continual decline in QCOM's share price?? I'm confused as to what is going on with this company??
Nov'21 is when there will be a change in sentiment (positive) on this stock. Big money will wait for FY21 results and the following Analysts / Investors Day event.
"I spent a little time going over Analyst Day discussion in Nov/19. One big takeaway was the significant sandbag they did...in their defense, they were not sure how the 5G rollout would go in terms of tiers and were conservative with RF, didn't include Huawei share upside and assumed MMWave was only Korea/Japan/US. They did stress it was a very confident guide - but it was obvious from the Analysts questions they were disappointed in how conservative they were being. For example for the 3 year guide they used 20% margins on QCT - through 2022! As we have seen they are bumping 30% already. Analysts asked back then why they didn't state 25%... They also stated a CAGR through 2022 for 10% revenue growth... very very conservative.A couple points, the Analyst day in 2019 covered 3 years. We should expect ""Investor"" Day this November to do the same. I really think QCT margin expansion needs to be aggressive this Nov - growing to 40%? Revenue growth CAGR 15% to 20% range. With these items, I believe we will see a new valuation for QCOM moving forward. With AI, AR, ADDS, and IOT ...I think 40% should be in the cards."
Green Friday with Big gains and Rich tears
"TSM is undervalued here, been consolidating since March, and is due for a breakout. It's the most advanced semiconductor company that all the big boys utilize ($NVDA, $AMD, $QCOM, $APPL, $AVGO, ARM, $INTC) and have all given very positive future outlooks. It is rapidly growing and expanding it's operations in an attempt to try and meet extreme demand. It's unrivaled 3nm process is fully booked for the next two years and production on the 2nm process is set to begin in 2023. The chip shortage has greatly contributed to a super cycle with semiconductors. The global expansion will ensure massive semiconductor growth for years and technologies like 5G, IoT, AI, and EV only reemphasizes their long term importance. Semiconductor equipment manufacturers like $ASML, $AMAT, $KLAC, and $UCTT all stand to greatly benefit from this global growth and expansion by all semiconductor manufacturers like TSM."
"Stacy weighs in with validation of nothing burger move by GOOG....Google using own chips 'financial immaterial' for Qualcomm, says Bernstein 07:14 QCOM, GOOG, GOOGL Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon notes that Google (GOOGL) announced an in-house SoC set to power the company's upcoming Pixel smartphones, debuting in the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro in the fall. The news sent Qualcomm's (QCOM) stock down a bit, the analyst points out. However, Rasgon argues that Google is a very small player in the smartphone market, shipping in the ballpark of about 5M units annually and holding well under half a point of market share. Hence, Rasgon would see this news more as a sentiment headwind versus anything financially material."
Sooo... we're down $4.12 on 1.4 million shares... what a crock of manufactured BS!!!Anyone else think that the coming mm-wave generation may have certain forces covering?
its very odd!! QCOM trading more like a dead giant IBM than a key player in 5G.....can someone explain?
Sector rotation guys! QCOM TSM are in good shape now...
Friday. Weekend announcement. Be careful qualcomedy don.
"Lakay, as I’ve said before, Qualcomm does not have the ability whatsoever to separate itself from other semiconductor stocks for upside momentum. Earnings have not and will not matter in the short term. Short term could very well be until next year by the way. This stock is seen as a nothing burger"
"Xiaomi Press Release Smartphone details...Q2 2021 Smartphone revenue reached RMB59.1 billion, up 86.8% YoY Smartphone shipments achieved 52.9 millionunits, up 86.8% YoY, a record high"
Did you know Google is going to make their own chips? Oh really. Soon people will be able to make their own chips at home. Oh really? Share price manipulation. Oh really? QCOM will still control 5G and make the same amount of money. Oh really.

"Go Joe you are at You""re Best keep up the steller work and have another Ice cream on the tax payer dime"
Can we NOT get to $160 my gosh
"Apple is strong. This is a good indication for the moment that we won’t get hammered to much worse. I’ll have to buy more if the $142.44 official gap gets filled this week. Qualcomm now trading at a low 15.85X forward PE. The PE has been contracting the last 7 months, unbelievable"
"Now it catches up with the NVDA and AMD gains, 155 by the end of the week."
added 1000 shares this morning.
$212 tomorrow
All the other cellphone companies are going to want the same chip as APPL for satellite communication. Qualcomm will be the big winner.
Rich - you are failing me! I am taking your advice and waiting for this to get to low 140s before buying some ITM leaps. Wondering if I missed the chance already.
"Just take a step back and take a look at what is going on....fabless companies $NVDA $AMD and now $QCOM all reporting incredible ER's with tremendous growth WITH very positive guidance going forward. Semi manufactures like $TSM $TXN all reporting beats with significant growth and constantly guiding upwards with positive outlooks going forward. Other manufacturers like $QRVO and $SWKS will likely reports similar strong ER's this week. Semi equipment companies like $ASML (destroyed earnings) $LRCX $AMAT are and will likely continue reporting even more significant earnings and growth due to unprecedented demand. The semiconductor industry is looking outstanding right now and has an even brighter future. ER's are reflecting this nicely. I'm severely bullish on this industry right now and many of the stocks, particularly semi equipment stocks are looking like value plays ($AMAT and $LRCX especially undervalued)."
vote up or down the direction you think qualcomm's stock will go tomorrow...
"Where’s Big? I’m sure disappointed by today as he was hoping for $160 by end of August. As I said before, not a chance. No volume, no momentum=trade with the overall market."
"(some weekend musings as I ponder the future of my investment in Qualcomm)The market really needs to catch up to the transformation story of Qualcomm. Looking at the history of Qualcomm, they were very cyclical based on handset launches. Looking at the chart, you can easily see the up and down and overall flat trajectory of Qualcomm in the past. This made sense as Qualcomm earnings were up and down based on the handset market. Then Amon's vision begins to come into view. He may end up being one of the greatest visionary CEOs of our time. His vision was to use the $67B of R&D Qualcomm has established to launch a new evolution of technology (and accelerate it a year) that transforms the world in a true digital age. (Note: As an older guy, this really scares me and I don't welcome it - but as an investor I am very happy). This vision also transforms Qualcomm from a handset CDMA company with lumpy growth - into a new mega diversified communication focused behemoth. The cloud now becomes the compute power for everything. QCOM is the company that will pull the data from all the now disjointed computing into the Cloud. The intelligent edge. You can see the transformation happening in the share price, revenues, and earnings growth. Beginning in 2019. The market takes a breather in Feb 2021, consolidating as every great company (including Nvidia, goog and amzn) has done. During this time, it has become obvious that QCOM is gaining traction outside of handsets (IOT and Auto specifically) - with growth in those areas at 30% QoQ. Now, the only question is whether the handset part of the business will bridge the company to the next level. I believe this is part of the reason for the low valuation at this point - market needs proof. What is happening is handset revenues continue to expand while the other areas grow which is really the perfect storm. As we know handsets can be lumpy and will eventually be lumpy again - but it is becoming very obvious at this point that the non-handset business continues to expand and for QCOM will be replaced by laptops, AR, etc. QCOM's valuation remains where a handset company would be - expecting lumpiness...but we are see signs that Qualcomm will be valued as a behemoth leader in the new AI, 5G age which up to this point has been nothing but science fiction. What will it take to convince the market that Qualcomm is this new leader in this next evolution of technology? I think it will be a window into 2022... right now, Analyst have practically flat revenue and little earnings growth modeled as they expect the lumpiness as everyone has seen from QCOM for the last decade. Once Amon releases what 2022 looks like - then all bets are off and this company gets a higher valuation as the market will see 20% - 30% growth in both top and bottom is in the foreseeable future. Handsets will continue and growth will come from IOT and AUTO - and 2022 will only be the first inning. QCOM has historically only guided to the next quarter. I am hoping, and somewhat expect, that Amon has plans to change this as he evolves QCOM into more than a lumpy handset company. It is my hope that this ER he sheds some light into what is coming - or at minimum sets a date for an event when he will do this. We are seeing all the signs that his plans are executing - and probably better than expected. Signs such as the massive expansion of 5G globally, EV Auto seeing 5G cockpits as a necessity, industries transforming their MFR, archaic medical institutions making the plunge, Accenture type companies investing billions in the space to be the integrator, - all the signs are in place. What remains is the translation of this into the numbers for investors.Heck, just a slight adjustment to the Forward PE of QCOM to just meet the S&P average of 23 puts the QCOM pps over $200 a share! But if Qualcomm can become what I describe above - the market will give them an even higher Forward PE as they have done with the other transformational technology companies (NVIDIA - AI/GPU transformational, MSFT - Cloud, AMZN - online buying, FB - social media, TSLA, GOOG, ...the market is littered with examples of companies who transform technology)."
"China Mobile's announced winners of a procurement contract for 320,000 5G module units, with Qualcomm, UNISOC, and MediaTek the biggest beneficiaries, Taiwan media report, adding that all three have their modem chips made by TSMC. $TSM $QCOM"
"Analysts and retail investors alike will come to appreciate what QCOM is trying to do with this attempt to acquire veoneer. Most hedge funds are usually playing the momentum game and they will also jump in. This CEO is a visionary, he has been one of the main characters that has be moving QCOM from just a mobile manufacture to a much more rounded company with a finger in many markets."
qcom is so far completely missed out during bull market. it is so sad.
Really think this has a lot to do with the options. Same thing with MU. No way these stocks should be where they are unless traders selling premium and driving SP down
"1.8 million shares after hours! Qcom CFO Palkhiwali converted options into 14,318 shares and covered exercise / tax liability with 7099 shares : increasing his ownership to 42,160 shares."
"5G (emphasis on mmwave) is a disruptive technology. It is really hard to wrap your head around it, but it will touch everything in the future and will be like electricity was to the consumer and industry (this is not an overstatement). The paper below is a great read for those interested (long read). The question I have had, it how best to capitalize on the 5G revolution as an investor. Assuming QCOM can execute and maintain their IP advantages, I don't see a better investment. Especially considering the current valuation of QCOM which is not looking ANY further then end of 2021 strangely enough. Patience is the key here - I can't emphasize that enough. https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1312/1312.0229.pdf"
"Marc, you’re suggesting they’ll raise guidance in mid to late September? I couldn’t tell you when they did something like that if ever. The only way they would do this is if they knew they were going to be 25% above of what they guided in the median which was $2.25. That then would have them pre-announcing $2.80. I don’t see it because they don’t have the supply side , hence sales to get there. To get to $2.80 they would have to likely do 9.7 billion or more, not possible given supply constraints."

"Resilient July iPhone 12 sell-through bodes well for 13 launch, says KeyBanc 07:31 AAPL, CRUS, QCOM, SWKS KeyBanc analyst John Vinh notes that his carrier survey and Key First Look Data indicate July Apple (AAPL) iPhone sell-through remained resilient month-over-month and tracked slightly above expectations, with both in-store sales and online sales increasing month-over-month. Based on his survey, the resurgence of COVID-19 cases and the upcoming new iPhone launch have not slowed upgrade activities. Inventory levels remain on the leaner side as production capacity is likely pivoting to the next-generation iPhone, Vinh adds. He views the results as moderately positive particularly this late in the cycle, boding well for the upcoming iPhone 13 cycle setting up for a positive bias to second half of the year estimates. The analyst highlights Cirrus Logic (CRUS), Qualcomm (QCOM), and Skyworks (SWKS)."
