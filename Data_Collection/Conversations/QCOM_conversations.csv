it is better for qcom to lose apple as a customer. I think qcom can survive without Apple soon. having Apple as a customer is more toxic than benefits. lots of Apple suppliers are out of business.
"Mr Market time to pay attention.....That being said, there was another big mobile semis story this week. Qualcomm unveiled its new RF chips. We have written a lot about Qualcomm’s dramatic change of fortunes in the RF space (and here and here). Put simply, Qualcomm has gone from almost a joke in RF to a powerhouse. They have had the capabilities to build RF products for over a decade, but it took them a long time to get the organization to the right place, and now that they have, they are firing on all cylinders.In particular, they launched a new line of filters. RF modules on phones are a collection of parts: filters; power amplifiers (PA); and a bunch of other stuff (these things are pretty complicated). Since the launch of 4G, which brought a lot of new spectrum bands into play, we have been living in a Golden Age of RF content in phones, and nowhere is that more true than with filters. With phones tapping into all sorts of radio frequencies, and with many of those frequencies laying pretty close to each other filter requirements have gone way up. Leading filter makers like Broadcom, Murata and Qorvo (in that order) have done very well. But now, just like everyone else in RF, they have to contend with Qualcomm looking to eat their lunch.In all fairness, we still do not know a lot about the new Qualcomm chips. Filters are very difficult to manufacture profitably, the manufacturing process is very challenging with very tight specs. So we do not yet know how well these product will do commercially, but our sense is that they would not have launched them if they had not already gotten these to a fairly mature stage. Note they are already sampling these to customers with volume production expected later next year.All of this is bad news for the other filter makers, but it is also likely good news for companies like Rubicon who we suspect are providing the specialized SOI wafers for Qualcomm’s RF line and Global Foundries who has built a nice SOI foundry business.But as we were reading this, we realized there are broader implications. For years, Qualcomm has had to use its core modem and AP business lines to “encourage” customers to buy its lagging RF products. But now the tables may be finally reversing, whereby the RF products can help pull customers to other Qualcomm parts. (We say finally because this was the original promise of Qualcomm entering the market ten plus years ago.) Qualcomm’s RF products may be able to not only expand Qualcomm’s Total Addressable Market (TAM), but may also start protecting the core product lines.Qualcomm has a big advantage in the RF market. Because they make all the chips in the phone related to communication (i.e. everything but the screen and memory), they can tightly couple their RF products to the compute engine in the AP. This gives “intelligence” (or at least digital logic) to the RF chain which can have a big impact on the performance of the phone. Go back to that Ars article about Google’s Tensor, a lot of the same thinking applies here to the way that well designed compute can have an impact on other parts of the phone. In Qualcomm’s case, this can go even further. Using digital logic and a lot of tricky design work, Qualcomm’s integrated RF chain can actually reduce the filter requirement of a phone (among many other enhancements). So in the hypothetical case where Qualcomm’s new RF chips are maybe not quite as good as other companies’ filters, they can likely make up for the shortfall with this integration. This fully integrated RF Front End (RFFE) has long been the Holy Grail of RF companies, and Qualcomm is likely on the cusp of delivering that. They have already demonstrated one for fixed wireless access points, and if we had to guess we would say that Qualcomm is probably going to announce a fully mobile version at next year’s Mobile World Congress (if the show happens).The importance of this extends beyond the RF space. If Qualcomm can really deliver on this (and by no means is it certain) then they will once again have a differentiated product, something that no one else has. This will be trouble for their arch-nemesis Mediatek whose market share this has overtaken Qualcomm for the first time. Mediatek has some RF assets, but lags considerably. But this is also important for the smartphone makers. All the leading smartphone makers have now been forced to build their own APs, with Apple going so far as to build its own modems, but none of them can make RF products. If Qualcomm’s RF products are as good as they could be, their customers will have to rethink their AP plans. They will turn to Qualcomm’s AP because it will be able to deliver far superior RF performance. In theory, Apple with a few hundred billion dollars in cash on its books could build its own RF chips, but it would take a long time to get there, certainly beyond the 2024 timeline when everyone thinks they will have their own modem. If they really wanted to avoid Qualcomm, Apple wou"
"Even though Aapl missed, who really thinks they are not securing as much inventory as possible. Especially vital components. Would they really be planning based on ""just in time"". For the foreseeable future doesn't it make sense to buy up as much as is available. In my line of business a lot of operators are going to the point of hoarding. Just an observation."
What has always puzzled me is that wholesale pricing for chips modums and anything intellectual is intellectual is always scrutinized is scrutinized and penalized By governments et cetera and these are the very companies that make any product exist in the 1st place.. That said the the retail market a market can charge as much as they wanthere's they want and nobody says a word. For example Apple complained and sued Qualcom in order to not pay the fees qualcom requested I stood even though it was already signed off in a contract. But Apple charges extraordinary amounts of money for every single product they sell retail. same for all retailers.
AMD reported stellar earnings. QCOM will blow away estimates. The difference between the two is that AMD is already prized sky high while QCOM is priced laughably low. It is coming boys and girls.
"No tears. QCOM is one of the best to invest companies. It settles the problem with Apple, it went out from just doing modems for smartphones. It has great proven potential to grow in revenues. And, in contrast with NDVA has sound p/e and dividends. Now its share price is pressed down by big boys but I’m sure this will not last long"
"Johns. You have to be realistic here. The market looks six months ahead. So let’s go back and look at Q2 and Q3 earnings, they were great and the stock is lower today then six month ago. I believe the reason for this is because it knows there will not be a big beat this quarter and guidance for Q1 will be soft in terms of the $2.60 analysts currently have. There is 0 reason for the PE contraction that has gone on now for the last 6-9 months other then a light beat when they report and poor guidance. When the CFO was interviewed, I believe like six weeks ago, he really focused the supply they’ll have , being in good shape come the December quarter. I should have seen this as a sign that this report upcoming will be just ok, not great. I believe the market already knows this and also believe it’s looking out six months from now, extrapolating even Q2 numbers. Unfortunately, I don’t see Qualcomm stock moving until sometime in February, where it will then really turn, but that’s if the economy remains ok as you know. Currently, our President is trying to destroy this country by many different measures. Keep that factor in mind as well when it comes to the stock market over the next 6-12 months"
"A possible explanation why QCOM is underperforming despite all positives that are expressed on this board is what BofA is saying. QCOM is a company that is a good idea to sell during October for many funds, in order to claim tax loss. The same article says that those companies (13 are mentioned) will likely rally after Oct 31! https://www.thestreet.com/investing/qualcomm-fedex-bofa-list-tax-beneficiaries?puc=yahoo&cm_ven=YAHOO"
"Now that 5G phones are more affordable, Qualcomm wants to make those low-cost devices more desirable. The company has introduced three new systems-on-chip that all promise improved performance for budget 5G hardware. The star is easily the Snapdragon 695. This 6nm-based sequel to the 690 adds much faster millimeter wave 5G (important for carriers like AT&T and Verizon) while delivering up to 30 percent faster graphics and 15 percent speedier CPU tasks. Your next mid-range phone might be that much better-suited to gaming and giant downloads.The Snapdragon 480 Plus and 778G Plus, meanwhile, are iterations of the 480 and 778G that deliver minor gains to CPU and GPU performance through increased clock speeds. Think of them as tune-ups for entry-level and upper-mid-range phones, respectively — you won't have to make do with a chip several months old.There's also a lone LTE chip, the Snapdragon 680, that shares the 695's 6nm process without the added costs of 5G. It's aimed at markets where 5G service is either limited or too expensive.All four parts are due to reach shipping products before the end of 2021. Honor, Motorola, Nokia (that is, HMD Global), Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi all expect to use one or more of the new Snapdragons in their phones.There's a pragmatism at work. The 6nm parts (including the 778G Plus) help Qualcomm continue to serve a large chunk of the smartphone market despite limited supplies of 5nm parts like the 780G. It doesn't have to rely on truly old process lStill, it's notable that the chip maker is launching so many speed-bumped chips in the first place — the company is clearly determined to fend off heavyweights like MediaTek that thrive on budget and mid-range hardware."
"Arm to Launch 5G Solutions Lab With Qualcomm, Google, and OthersArm plans to play a central role in the market for 5G network infrastructure, with Arm-based chips inside the majority of base stations. Arm is also dominant in smartphones that can connect to 5G networks.Arm said it plans to launch a 5G lab with the support of several major semiconductor vendors and other players, giving them a place to test new technologies and plot out strategies for bringing them to market.The company detailed its plan for the new 5G Solutions Lab ahead of its annual conference on Monday. Arm said it would allow companies to work together to test and validate 5G solutions in areas ranging from small cells and macrocells to core networks and software in charge of coordinating all of the base stations in a telecom giant's 5G network. The lab could also focus on new network architectures including cloud RAN.Arm executives said 5G networks have already been deployed in 60 markets globally. Moreover, 5G phones are on pace to represent 40% of global shipments in 2021, growing to almost 70% by 2025, according to IDC.""The rapid pace of deployment underscores how critical it is that we achieve faster development of network and edge infrastructure solutions,"" said Chris Bergey, SVP and GM of Arm's infrastructure business, in a blog.Arm plans to open the 5G labs' doors as many telecom giants overhaul how they operate new 5G networks. Many telecom firms are investing in a new standard for open radio access networks called Open RAN, which will allow them to use more commodity networking gear in 5G networks. This model mirrors the ""white box"" systems widely used by Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and other cloud players for software-defined networks.Previously, telecom giants would buy all of the components necessary to build a base station from a single supplier such as Nokia, Ericsson, or Huawei, each with proprietary packages of hardware and software that limited their customers' flexibility. But the Open RAN standard would make it possible for them to mix and match interchangeable components sold by different vendors and assemble them in a more modular way.The Open RAN model could also reduce costs by bringing more competition to the market. By giving telcos the ability to add features to 5G networks by upgrading the software or swapping out standard hardware, Nokia, Ericsson, Samsung, Cisco, and other telecom gear vendors will have to compete more on pricing.Arm proposed the 5G solutions lab as a place for hardware and software vendors to test new products against each other to make sure that they are interchangeable and meet 5G standards like Open RAN.Arm said the lab is supported by a wide range of industry partners, including Nvidia, NXP Semiconductors, Marvell, and Qualcomm, which has been investing to expand its footprint in the market for 5G base station silicon. Google's cloud computing arm plans to take part in the 5G technology lab, along with more than 10 other networking gear makers, software firms, and telecom giants such as Dish Networks and Vodaphone.https://www.electronicdesign.com/technologies/embedded-revolution/article/21178283/electronic-design-arm-to-launch-5g-solutions-lab-with-qualcomm-google-and-others"

"Yesterday, Grayson had a very relevant post which I think needs brought to the top of the message board - so re-posting it here (see below). This is a question to Amon from the recent Canaccord Genuity investor call. Also connect the dots with Greg's recent post on Honor launching. Combine Honor and the expanded Apple business...not to mention VIVO and other OEMs all launching flagship phones... then add IOT growth...Auto and the fact QCOM is going to speak about the future on Nov 16 ...this future to include NUVIA and other markets we likely haven't even heard of. Question:""And a concern for investors I get in some conversations too is while you're procuring more supply, some of your smartphone customers may be hitting some component shortages from other areas that might limit some of your sales in the back half of the calendar year.""Amon's responseLook, we continue to have more demand and supply across all businesses. And if there's one thing that we learned from this semiconductor supply crisis is many industries now realize the importance of semiconductors, which is a good thing. It's a good thing. I'll tell you, in one bizarre way, it created a lot of direct relationships between Qualcomm and many of the end customers given the importance of semiconductors. Now where we are right now in the supply chain, we had said we'll see material improvements towards the end of the year. We're on track to dothat. We basically took advantage of every possible capacity available. We multisourced a number of our products. Scale really helped us. We're multi-sourcing from leading node to legacy node. We launched new multi-sourcing products in record time. I think we talked about the 778G in 6 nanometer. And we launched with a brand-new customer, which is Honor, one that we didn't have a relationship. And we'll see things improving. I am continuing to be optimistic about the outlook of the industry for '22. 5G has been very resilient. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we reiterated our numbers for the calendar year. And based on what we have, line of sight, we're not that worried about demand. And we feel good about having the supply to start approaching the demand level as we get into 2022"

remember developing phone is much easier than developing key SOCs in phone. qcom will be a winner in the end. I keep accumulating qcom shares. qcom has the wide range of portfolio to cover all kinds of communications SOCs.
Apple CC will be very enlightening. Part of me thinks they are just losing share in China and India to superior phones and using chip constraints as an excuse...its Apple for Pete's sake...they can use their leverage with suppliers and should be the first served. Could take some lessons from QCOM. They will be asked where the constraint is coming from and whether the $6B will move forward or is lost. Also any questions around maintaining orders and building inventory or dropping orders... etc. Very interesting call coming up.

"My Testimony about QualcommThis post is divided into:1. What Qualcomm used to be, until recently2. What Qualcomm is now3. What Qualcomm will develop into1. What Qualcomm was until recently:Qualcomm has, for decades been a leader in the development of foundational cellular technology, which has given it the right to charge license fees on all phones, all brands, smart or not, that use 3G, 4G and 5G technology, this meaning, pretty much all phones that exist. This was a good business with super high margins.Qualcomm has also used its superior inside knowledge about those standards, in order to develop the (by far) best modems in the business, and for the last decade developed SoCs that besides the modem, includes pretty much all intelligence on the phones.Though successful, here has been a couple of downsides to this strategy:a) Smartphones turned into a stagnant business in the late 2010’s,b) Their licence model was challenged by for example Apple, Huawei and FTC.c) More than 90% dependence on cellular phones.While Qualcomm was a money-making machine with cool dividends, their stagnant growth and constant challenges to their licencing created the perception of a company at war with its large customers, so it kept the stock from taking off. Many investors unfortunately still think of them that way. 2. What Qualcomm is nowIn the last few years, the picture has changed greatly, driven primarily by:a) Settlements and wins with Apple, Huawei and FTCb) The emergence of 5Gc) Qualcomm focus on high growth product lines besides smartphones.Some detail:a) Especially FTC dropping its lawsuit entirely after the appeals court ruling as well as the Apple settlement were hugely important for Qualcomm. Sure, some countries or entities may fuss a little and create some relatively minor troubles, but when it comes to license fees, the sailing will be much smoother going forward. b) In general, investors don’t understand just how complex 5G modems are, and how far ahead Qualcomm are any other company. It is a joke to believe that Apple, with their acquired Intel failed modem division, would have a product ready by 2023 as some “analysts” seem to believe. It will likely take 5years or more. Also, MediaTek lags far behind, and are confined to low end phones.As Qualcomm is stating, and the numbers show, 5G unit prices are about 50% higher than 4G. Evidence: QCOM handset sales first 9 months FY2021 are $12,14 vs $7,46B same period FY2020 . There is also an ongoing windfall, from Huawei, who used other suppliers than QCOM, has exited the handphone business, and that market is mainly taken over by QCOMs best customers Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo and Honor, the guys that buy Qualcomm’s excellent complete SoC’s, and together supply about 45-50% of all 5G phones. This transition will be noticeable in the next few quarters. Margins are enhanced by the ongoing gradual introduction of mmWave.c) New High Growth Products – Recent high growth product are divided into 3 segments:- IOT (Internet of Things) – This segment increased a whopping 83% y/y for the last quarter and is now the largest area outside of handsets with 1,40B in quarterly sales. It includes high growth areas like computing, industrial, and edge networking.- RFFE – In this area Qualcomm has grown from a minor player to the largest supplier in the world in just a couple of years. It grew 87% in the first 9 months this year. Qualcomm expects continued high growth there with integrated system designs, using its strong market position to sell systems to existing customers.- Auto – Probably the most exiting future area of the company. It grew 60% y/y first 9 months this year, Qualcomm has an order book of about 10 BUSD and has 23 of the the 26 leading auto brands as its customers already. The recent acquisition of Veoneer’s ADAS properties positions QCOM well to become the world leading supplier in automated driving functionality.Total sales this year (FY21) will exceed 33B according to Yahoo Finance consensus compared to last year just 21,7B. Next year sales is estimated at 36,6B, but estimates are bumped up each quarter, and based on the developments outlined above, sales should be around 42B and EPS around $12 rather than current consensus of $9.28.3. What Qualcomm will develop intoQCOMs handset business growth will eventually slow, even though gradual growth of mmWave can counter-balance that. However, other fast growing segments will be more than 50% of the business soon. Margins are higher there. Auto is hugely exciting after Veoneer is integrated.Therefore I predict that EPS will grow to $15 per share in 2023, and onward to $18 per share in 2024.Bottom LineAs it becomes clear that Apple are nowhere near launching their own iPhone modem, and also clear how QCOM growth businesses are taking over, forward PE should rise from todays 14 to somewhere between 25 and 30. This makes me expect a stock price of 375 to 540 in 2-3 years’ time."

@kingspellchecker. I noted something else from Amon's quote...QCOM tied up capacity with legacy nodes as well. I also remember somewhere reading that they even profundity. Now Apple had issues with.....legacy nodes...I wonder if QCOM tying up as much supply as possible along with others hoarding helped cause the issues for companies like Apple. Just a thought.

"From a sponsored Tech Crunch article a few months ago - but worth reading to understand what you are invested in. In September of 1882, Thomas Edison flipped a switch inside his Pearl Street Station, delivering electricity to 3,000 incandescent light bulbs across Lower Manhattan and igniting a revolution of interconnected technology. Nearly a century and a half later, 5G is on the verge of a similar transformative moment, ushering in a new era in which everybody and everything will be connected, driving a digital transformation of all industries, in all corners of the globe. This digital transformation is on a scale like we’ve never seen before, and 5G is the key ingredient fueling it. Unlike the G’s before it, 5G is the first generation of mobile technology designed to go beyond the smartphone. It is networks for all devices and industries, ranging from computers and XR headsets to factories and farms. No industry will be left untouched, including automotive, which is already in the midst of its digital transformation. Carmakers are working to phase out the internal combustion engine. They are connecting the car to other cars and its surrounding environment. And to support this, they are integrating advanced technologies, such as always connected, high performance, power efficient systems that are entirely transforming the driving experience."
"When QCOM announced a few weeks back that they are going to buy back $10B of stock, they essentially sent a message that the stock is undervalued. If QCOM does not show good numbers and forecasts in the upcoming earnings call, management would immediately lose credibility. That is why I think QCOM will have good earnings as well as provide upbeat forecasts. QCOM is a huge part of my portfolio now. So I am also thinking whether I should buy puts to protect my investment. Anybody has any suggestions on which put option may be optimal to buy? Thanks."
"Tom, I understand what you’re saying, but the fact is that Apple is 18% of Qualcomm business. Apple doesn’t use their Snapdragon chips, did you not know this? Apple has their own processor and so a modem as you know is built entirely different then a processor with reference to Snapdragon which does in a lot of cases incorporate their modem as well, but we are talking different capacity requirements when it comes to the two technologies"
"There will be a big surprise on ER day. There’s a reason why the company is buying back a lot of shares, not just because of its discounted price, but a looming exponential growth."
"It appears that Apple faced shortages from other suppliers. What I wonder is if Apple took more product from Qualcomm then they could actually use. Normally, with Apple, they would say nope, but they may very well have taken inventory above and beyond because why would they risk losing the allowed capacity knowing the constraints of the industry. So with that said, Mediatek does NOT supply Apple with any modems folks, so if Apple built 38 million IPhones, they very well could have taken more modems then they could actually use. Apple said the shortage cost them $6 billion so they would have beaten revenue by 6% instead of a slight miss. The only thing I’m hoping for is that Qualcomm winds up hitting the high end of its sales range, being $9.2 billion and somehow increased margins on QTC to 33% or better."
"after buyback announcement, the volume is significantly reduced. it is curious."
Reality is iPhone revenue is up 47% yr over yr with likely a higher percentage of those phones being mmwave. THAT IS ALL THAT MATTERS TO QCOM and hence why the stock isn’t down much after hours.
Looks like Qcom has been allocating most of their chip capacity to the more profitable fully integrated Snapdragon SOCs (think Android). Apple got what was left over for discrete modem chips. it appears that left a $6 Billion dollar short fall in Apples iphone revenues. Ed Snyder says if Apple can't get chips then the other companies can't either. I call BS. Samsung beat and so will the China phone manufacturers using Snapdragon. .
"Gee could we be in for an earnings surprise????????Samsung Tops Profit Estimates After Chip Crunch Lifts PricesSamsung Electronics Co. third-quarter profit exceeded analysts’ estimates after a prolonged semiconductor shortage boosted prices of memory and system chips that go into computers and mobile devices.Net income rose to 12.06 trillion won ($10.3 billion) in the three months ended September, South Korea’s largest company said in a statement on Thursday. Analysts predicted 11.54 trillion won on average, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Samsung disclosed preliminary numbers earlier this month, including a more than 25% increase in operating profit.The world’s biggest maker of memory chips and smartphones has benefited from strong demand as the global economy recovers from the Covid-19 pandemic, with rising semiconductor prices providing an added boost. Still, memory-chip prices may start to cool this quarter as customers are less anxious to place new orders after stockpiling inventories."
Let’s dream for a moment. Let’s imagine QCOM has been able to raise prices slightly and grow all divisions and reports $2.55. Let’s imagine they guide $3 for the xmas Quarter. Let’s imagine others cannot ignore that this is a growth company.
"I am confused by Rich's remark. 6 months from now (mid 2022) supply chain will be in much better shape. Also, they clearly indicated that they secured supply from primary and secondary nodes so they would have s meaningful increase in their supply chain by year end. This was stated earlier in the year and has not be retracted. So unless demand falls, why would they see a contraction in earnings?? Why would they start introducing lower priced Snapdragon chipsets for mid price phones if they had supply constraints. They can ""sell everything they produce"". I guess we will know next week."
"THERE SHOULD BE NO DOUBTS ABOUT THE RELEASE TIME OF XIAOMI 12￼The first point among the advantages of Xiaomi 12 will be the latest platform Snapdragon 898. One cannot but recall the fact that for several years the company has been doing everything to be the first on the market to release a flagship with the latest top-end SoC from Qualcomm. All indications are that this year, too, its Xiaomi 12 will claim the title of a pioneer in the market with the SnapdragonNetwork insider Ice Universe, who is quite accurate in his predictions, said that he is 100% confident that the Xiaomi 12 will premiere in December. You can trust this insider, so it is worth taking for granted that the company will arrange the announcement of the new flagship in the last month of the outgoing year and it will be the first on the market to offer the latest premium platform from Qualcomm. Presumably, the announcement will take place after December 12th."
"There you have it, he just said the impact is to legacy nodes and NOT leading edge nodes (QCOM)."
