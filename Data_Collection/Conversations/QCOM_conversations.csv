"The AAPL modem discussion is about to become a footnote in history......imagine having a home 5G router that by-passes the need for a wired connection to your house for you to access the internet. 5G Technology Begins to Expand Beyond SmartphonesThe deployment of superfast 5G networks is supposed to usher in a new era for so much more than the smartphone—everything from enhanced virtual-reality videogames to remote heart surgery. That vision has been slow to come into focus, but a first wave of 5G-enabled gadgets is emerging.Among the first uses of 5G to hit the consumer market is the delivery of home broadband internet service for the ultimate cord-cutters: those looking to not just shed their cable-TV bills but abandon Internet access via wires altogether. Samsung Electronics Co. , for instance, has teamed up with Verizon Communications Inc. to offer wireless 5G routers that promise to deliver at-home broadband access. The router picks up 5G signals just like a smartphone would.Other consumer devices that have started to come on the market include 5G-compatible laptops from several makers, all of which are faster than other laptops and offer higher-quality video viewing, when connected to a 5G network. (Laptops need to have a 5G chip to make that connection.)"
"Connecting some dots in Auto.- Sateliot along with QCOM, will launch IOT 5G connectivity via satellites. Eventually, 5G connectivity will be everywhere.- QCOM acquires NUVIA CPU, will be used in emerging Auto products per QCOM- QCOM acquires Venoneer for ADAS (NUVIA SOC)- 40% of a car today's cost is electronic components, moving to 50% in coming years and more with EVQCOM has a digital cockpit and now creating solutions for ADAS. Think of the AI involved in transmitting radar and video to the cloud from the car via 5G. Auto companies will want to work with a bundled solution from a tested and credible leader in 5G. The market is very large for ADAS and QCOM's vision is always on connectivity for improved driving. Veoneer today has about $200M per Quarter already in this market - QCOM is running about $250M...QCOM farms those customers and expands market with a unique 5G ADAS. This market TAM is very large and larger in coming years.This is only one market beyond mobile for QCOM - then you have Gaming, AR, VR, Industry, etc. etc. It is easy to see why QCOM will become a behemoth in this digital revolution of connectivity. Mobile phone chips will be a small % of revenue in coming years as QCOM transforms to a new company under the market building leadership of Cristiano Amon who said ""we are moving very fast""."
"Arm to Launch 5G Solutions Lab With Qualcomm, Google, and OthersArm plans to play a central role in the market for 5G network infrastructure, with Arm-based chips inside the majority of base stations. Arm is also dominant in smartphones that can connect to 5G networks.Arm said it plans to launch a 5G lab with the support of several major semiconductor vendors and other players, giving them a place to test new technologies and plot out strategies for bringing them to market.The company detailed its plan for the new 5G Solutions Lab ahead of its annual conference on Monday. Arm said it would allow companies to work together to test and validate 5G solutions in areas ranging from small cells and macrocells to core networks and software in charge of coordinating all of the base stations in a telecom giant's 5G network. The lab could also focus on new network architectures including cloud RAN.Arm executives said 5G networks have already been deployed in 60 markets globally. Moreover, 5G phones are on pace to represent 40% of global shipments in 2021, growing to almost 70% by 2025, according to IDC.""The rapid pace of deployment underscores how critical it is that we achieve faster development of network and edge infrastructure solutions,"" said Chris Bergey, SVP and GM of Arm's infrastructure business, in a blog.Arm plans to open the 5G labs' doors as many telecom giants overhaul how they operate new 5G networks. Many telecom firms are investing in a new standard for open radio access networks called Open RAN, which will allow them to use more commodity networking gear in 5G networks. This model mirrors the ""white box"" systems widely used by Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and other cloud players for software-defined networks.Previously, telecom giants would buy all of the components necessary to build a base station from a single supplier such as Nokia, Ericsson, or Huawei, each with proprietary packages of hardware and software that limited their customers' flexibility. But the Open RAN standard would make it possible for them to mix and match interchangeable components sold by different vendors and assemble them in a more modular way.The Open RAN model could also reduce costs by bringing more competition to the market. By giving telcos the ability to add features to 5G networks by upgrading the software or swapping out standard hardware, Nokia, Ericsson, Samsung, Cisco, and other telecom gear vendors will have to compete more on pricing.Arm proposed the 5G solutions lab as a place for hardware and software vendors to test new products against each other to make sure that they are interchangeable and meet 5G standards like Open RAN.Arm said the lab is supported by a wide range of industry partners, including Nvidia, NXP Semiconductors, Marvell, and Qualcomm, which has been investing to expand its footprint in the market for 5G base station silicon. Google's cloud computing arm plans to take part in the 5G technology lab, along with more than 10 other networking gear makers, software firms, and telecom giants such as Dish Networks and Vodaphone.https://www.electronicdesign.com/technologies/embedded-revolution/article/21178283/electronic-design-arm-to-launch-5g-solutions-lab-with-qualcomm-google-and-others"
Analysts should be allowed to update their ratings / price targets only once per quarter all on the same day at the same time. This will minimize the blatant manipulation and collusion going on between hedge funds and brokerage / banks / market makers.
I think we are seeing the strength of the whisper number being posted. Next week is last full week before the truth comes out which we all know is 1) Qcom has managed supply constraints very well 2) Continued expansion of non handset business units. Would be nice if the market could hold up.
"Apple Inc. is likely to slash its projected iPhone 13 production targets for 2021 by as many as 10 million units because of prolonged chip shortages, according to people with knowledge of the matter, Bloomberg News reports.The company had expected to produce 90 million new iPhone models in the last three months of the year, but it’s now telling manufacturing partners that the total will be lower because Broadcom Inc. and Texas Instruments Inc. are struggling to deliver enough components, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the situation is private."
This is so frustrating. Luckily I have AVGO AMD and NVDA but my bulk ownership is QCOM. Can't seem to make any headway.
This stock is manipulated in after hours. Big time.
this low share price is very good for qcom. they can remove lots of shares at the cheap price. it could be very interesting to see the share action in November after ER and investors day.
"From a sponsored Tech Crunch article a few months ago - but worth reading to understand what you are invested in. In September of 1882, Thomas Edison flipped a switch inside his Pearl Street Station, delivering electricity to 3,000 incandescent light bulbs across Lower Manhattan and igniting a revolution of interconnected technology. Nearly a century and a half later, 5G is on the verge of a similar transformative moment, ushering in a new era in which everybody and everything will be connected, driving a digital transformation of all industries, in all corners of the globe. This digital transformation is on a scale like we’ve never seen before, and 5G is the key ingredient fueling it. Unlike the G’s before it, 5G is the first generation of mobile technology designed to go beyond the smartphone. It is networks for all devices and industries, ranging from computers and XR headsets to factories and farms. No industry will be left untouched, including automotive, which is already in the midst of its digital transformation. Carmakers are working to phase out the internal combustion engine. They are connecting the car to other cars and its surrounding environment. And to support this, they are integrating advanced technologies, such as always connected, high performance, power efficient systems that are entirely transforming the driving experience."
No doubt in Qualcomm. Unfortunately we have to wait until big boys fill their portfolios with its shares. Think this will not long too much
"I dont pretend to know what is going on at QCOM. I do own a boatload of shares, and truly hope you pumpers are correct."
NVDA unstoppable....it seems....guess they will be the next trillion club.....
"From Facebook call….Other revenue was $734 million, up a 195% driven by strong Quest 2 sales."
"THERE SHOULD BE NO DOUBTS ABOUT THE RELEASE TIME OF XIAOMI 12￼The first point among the advantages of Xiaomi 12 will be the latest platform Snapdragon 898. One cannot but recall the fact that for several years the company has been doing everything to be the first on the market to release a flagship with the latest top-end SoC from Qualcomm. All indications are that this year, too, its Xiaomi 12 will claim the title of a pioneer in the market with the SnapdragonNetwork insider Ice Universe, who is quite accurate in his predictions, said that he is 100% confident that the Xiaomi 12 will premiere in December. You can trust this insider, so it is worth taking for granted that the company will arrange the announcement of the new flagship in the last month of the outgoing year and it will be the first on the market to offer the latest premium platform from Qualcomm. Presumably, the announcement will take place after December 12th."
"Wow! This flies in the face of what the analysts are telling us.....Like many other manufacturers, Samsung is struggling with the chip crisis. As one of the largest manufacturers, there is a correspondingly great need, but apparently, even the smartphone boss of the group flashed off during his visits to Snapdragon supplier Qualcomm.As reported by the Korean portal The Elec, TM Roh, who has headed Samsung Electronics’ most important division – namely the smartphone division – for some time, apparently visited the US chip company Qualcomm several times this year at its headquarters in San Diego. He should be negotiating there so that Qualcomm can deliver more Snapdragon SoCs to Samsung.Samsung asking for more ChipsBut Roh’s mission apparently failed. In March and also in July, the head of Samsung Mobile even flew to the United States to hold talks there “with a large chip manufacturer”. Qualcomm is not explicitly identified as the interlocutor that Roh visited in the US, but there is no other chip company based there that supplies Samsung with chips for mobile devices on a large scale.In any case, despite the multiple visits by the senior manager from Korea, the US partner was allegedly unwilling to give preference to the electronics giant for its chip deliveries or to increase the number of units as hoped. Samsung, therefore, has to carefully weigh up which smartphone models are equipped with the available chips, after all, there is a lot of strategy behind the business."
qcom may repurchase lots of shares today. but the volume is too low. the negative news on oppo soc doesn't work very well.
Here is my guess on the closing. Up one cent today!
"So many similarities to AMD in 2018. Look at Sept/2018... AMD runs to $32 pps from $10 area, then back to $16 over the next 3 months before beginning its ascent to $111. For AMD back then, it was a fake video put out by a Hedge Fund - made in Israel - warning of a security flaw in their new chips that never existed. Made the trade rags all over the place... AMD had to respond to it... by then the damage was done to the stock. Now for QCOM, it was the Hedge funds making up a story of Apple cutting iPhones based on everyone's fear of supply shortage. Incredible really..."
"Broadcom, Marvel, Nvidia, Intel all tried to develop the cellular modem in-house for different generation. All of them failed in getting their modems they they are much experienced in semiconductor development. They are all big-named firms. Some failed in wcdma, some others failed in 4G that are much simpler than the current 5G. Apple is no exception. Hopefully we hear the modem development status from. Apple soon. They can not hide the status any more since they repeatedly announced the intention to use the in-house modems by 2023."
I think QCOM hits 160 before ER.
"I've bought another 500 shares at $128.52 after the opening, so my average buying price is now $129.83.QCOM is now more then 20% of my portfolio and I plan to hold at least to retest ATH.Looking at all semis, it seems QCOM is not buying back its own shares but shares of AMD and NVDA."
@kingspellchecker. I noted something else from Amon's quote...QCOM tied up capacity with legacy nodes as well. I also remember somewhere reading that they even profundity. Now Apple had issues with.....legacy nodes...I wonder if QCOM tying up as much supply as possible along with others hoarding helped cause the issues for companies like Apple. Just a thought.
I expect QCOM will begin buying immediately to capture the 120s value... I don't think we will stay in the 120s much longer which is fine with me.
remember developing phone is much easier than developing key SOCs in phone. qcom will be a winner in the end. I keep accumulating qcom shares. qcom has the wide range of portfolio to cover all kinds of communications SOCs.
"I am confused by Rich's remark. 6 months from now (mid 2022) supply chain will be in much better shape. Also, they clearly indicated that they secured supply from primary and secondary nodes so they would have s meaningful increase in their supply chain by year end. This was stated earlier in the year and has not be retracted. So unless demand falls, why would they see a contraction in earnings?? Why would they start introducing lower priced Snapdragon chipsets for mid price phones if they had supply constraints. They can ""sell everything they produce"". I guess we will know next week."
Patients will always return a positive outcome for a proven company. There was a continued opportunity to buy in or add more shares on the dips. Hopefully investors have learned that listening to the short bashers is always a huge mistake.
"When QCOM announced a few weeks back that they are going to buy back $10B of stock, they essentially sent a message that the stock is undervalued. If QCOM does not show good numbers and forecasts in the upcoming earnings call, management would immediately lose credibility. That is why I think QCOM will have good earnings as well as provide upbeat forecasts. QCOM is a huge part of my portfolio now. So I am also thinking whether I should buy puts to protect my investment. Anybody has any suggestions on which put option may be optimal to buy? Thanks."
"wish for qcom stock to be manipulated soon as other stocks like nvda, brcm, tsla did."
"From automotive news Europe . Sums up the strategy well. IOT, AUTO (now DMS), Nuvia Chips, ... smart phones will be less than half of revenue very soon. At closing, SSW Partners, a New York-based investment partnership, will sell Veoneer’s Arriver business to Qualcomm and “lead the process of finding strong, long-term strategic partners” for Veoneer’s other units, the companies said in a statement Monday.Veoneer is the biggest example of Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon’s aggressive pursuit of a role for the company outside the smartphone market that generates most of the company’s revenue.....Qualcomm’s Amon was promoted to the company’s top job in June and said his tenure will be defined by his success in lessening its reliance on the smartphone market its processors and modem dominate. Automotive products accounted for about 3 percent of chip sales last year and has been growing slowly in recent quarters."
"Qualcomm has announced four new chipsets which are the Snapdragon 778G Plus, 695, 680, and 480 Plus. The new chipsets will offer more options to device manufacturers while choosing a Snapdragon processor, which could also help the company better compete with rival MediaTek........... https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/qualcomm-snapdragon-778g-plus-480-plus-695-680-announced-all-you-need-to-know-7593079/"
"Shorts will say anything to try and have people sell. I look at is an opportunity to buy the dips especially with QCOM and all of their possibilities. Buy backs, increased dividends, upgrades by analysts. These prices are a bargain for investors "
"TEL AVIV, Israel, Oct. 26, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Quantum Machines, creator of the first universal quantum computing cloud infrastructure, today announced an investment from Qualcomm Ventures LLC. The investment in Quantum Machines is the first by Qualcomm Ventures in the Quantum Computing space and is an extension of the company's Series B round announced earlier this year. PR Newswire."
"Mediatek conference call is interesting read. He all but concedes market share losses for remaining of 21 but then says he will gain it all back when he releases the new ""flagship"" chip next year. When pressed about design wins, he refused to answer."
Do you guys follow http://the-alphatrader.com/? It seems way better than all the spam on the QCOM board - The alerts have been great!
"My forecast for the F21Q4 report due Wednesday after closing (my final one for the record, I will not change it):EPS 2.55 Revenue 9.55B. Guidance present quarter midpoints 2.80 and 10.5B.This is based on weighing a lot of info out there.Last year FQ4 revenue growth was up 33% compared to FQ3 (6502M vs. 4890M). This year the q/q revenue will slow to 19% growth (9550M vs 7995). As stated on earnings calls regarding seasonality, Qualcomm's FQ3 is their weakest quarter of the year. FQ1 their strongest."
I wish I bought NVDA instead of QCOM
"Waaay too much focus on Apple's impact to QCOM. In the old days, yes this would be significant. Today, any fall out from Apple business will be consumed by other customers - if even Apple allowed their commitments to QCOM to lag. Saying this, I do understand the market is hyper focused on Apple and therefore there ends up being an impact to QCOM PPS, but not their business."
$150 after earnings
"If you are doubting Qcomm or any other major company (Adobe, Apple, Microsoft, Walmart, etc...), just increase the time-frame on your chart. I started investing about a year and a half ago (I am still 23) and by FUD i sold a few of my companies holdings. When I zoomed out the time-frame, i saw the idiotic decision I made. Holding a company of this caliber for 1, 2, 3...6 months is nothing compared to the big picture.I learned by brute force that looking at the daily price tag on the stock is just bad for your health. My take on it? If you have that gut feeling that the company is going to succeed, if you believe in it and see it in everyday products (in this case, phones and car chips), it will continue to grow. If finantials back that idea, why sell due to a 6 month dip?Thats just some learnings i got through my journey. I know it hurts to see red everyday. However, look at the big picture. Good luck!"
I have FAITH in Qualcomm
"Verizon transcript…. 5G & millimeter wave growth … This is tracking well ahead of the 4G adoption, as I've said before. For context, 12 months of the 4G launched, 10% of the devices were on 4G. Less than 12 months after 5G DSS launch, more than the double were on 5G devices, and it's growing at the rapid pace. This combined with our millimeter wave strategy is an important combination, and that is paying off. In the third quarter, the total millimeter wave usage more than double sequentially. We're doing more gigabit of usage in a month now than we did in all the first quarter. In some or more established build outs, we're seeing more than 20% of usage of millimeter wave. And we are on track to have 5% to 10% of all traffic in the urban millimeter wave polygons by year end."
Reality is iPhone revenue is up 47% yr over yr with likely a higher percentage of those phones being mmwave. THAT IS ALL THAT MATTERS TO QCOM and hence why the stock isn’t down much after hours.
"Look at nvidia, amd, how it's flying, they are nothing in front of this , this is cornered , looks this is cornered and it can't fly anytime soon"
"Now that 5G phones are more affordable, Qualcomm wants to make those low-cost devices more desirable. The company has introduced three new systems-on-chip that all promise improved performance for budget 5G hardware. The star is easily the Snapdragon 695. This 6nm-based sequel to the 690 adds much faster millimeter wave 5G (important for carriers like AT&T and Verizon) while delivering up to 30 percent faster graphics and 15 percent speedier CPU tasks. Your next mid-range phone might be that much better-suited to gaming and giant downloads.The Snapdragon 480 Plus and 778G Plus, meanwhile, are iterations of the 480 and 778G that deliver minor gains to CPU and GPU performance through increased clock speeds. Think of them as tune-ups for entry-level and upper-mid-range phones, respectively — you won't have to make do with a chip several months old.There's also a lone LTE chip, the Snapdragon 680, that shares the 695's 6nm process without the added costs of 5G. It's aimed at markets where 5G service is either limited or too expensive.All four parts are due to reach shipping products before the end of 2021. Honor, Motorola, Nokia (that is, HMD Global), Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi all expect to use one or more of the new Snapdragons in their phones.There's a pragmatism at work. The 6nm parts (including the 778G Plus) help Qualcomm continue to serve a large chunk of the smartphone market despite limited supplies of 5nm parts like the 780G. It doesn't have to rely on truly old process lStill, it's notable that the chip maker is launching so many speed-bumped chips in the first place — the company is clearly determined to fend off heavyweights like MediaTek that thrive on budget and mid-range hardware."
I see Kramer says Wells Fargo came out with a hold and a 138 price target today. Is that the reason we are at a 52 week low? They have beat earnings projections every time this year and the PE has gone from 49 a year ago to 15 according to Yahoo and 13 on forward earnings. So why has the stock dropped in two months about 27 points? I have held because of several analysts and investors coming out in the past few months ranking qualcom either their best pick or one of their top buys. Price targets for them are 168 to 200. Is it the Micron drop today pulling it down or the shortage of semis or what? Trying to hold on and get through October but never expected to go to where it was at its low a year ago when all I hear from the company is business has never been better. Any thoughts?
Whisper number finally posted (thanks Robert). Above high end of range.I had been waiting for this and believe we will begin our climb into ER now - Bears can't manipulate any longer.
"The following comment by Morgan Stanley appeared today on Seeking Alpha (I think that the last comment on China means that they think the China economic slowdown is hitting MediaTek low end phones but not QCOM high end 5G phones):""And for Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), the firm is expecting good results vs. ""somewhat cautious"" expectations, with checks showing primary revenue drivers are still strong (and that supply chain issues aren't having much of an impact - and that Qualcomm has less exposure to a market plateau in China than competitors.)"""
Looks like Qcom has been allocating most of their chip capacity to the more profitable fully integrated Snapdragon SOCs (think Android). Apple got what was left over for discrete modem chips. it appears that left a $6 Billion dollar short fall in Apples iphone revenues. Ed Snyder says if Apple can't get chips then the other companies can't either. I call BS. Samsung beat and so will the China phone manufacturers using Snapdragon. .
"Qualcomm - Snapdragon Tech Summit -> November 30 to December 2, 2021"

"Of note, last Friday saw ~2500 Call contracts for the $160 Jan22 Strike. Not sure how this fits in with the action we are seeing other than I can't see it anyway but a bullish sign. In addition, the earnings revisions have gone up for QCOM over the last couple months. Remember, all this downward pressure has been low volume. I tend to think that when the whisper number comes out we may see a change in sentiment."

He did acknowledge though that Wall Street doesn’t like the company no matter how well they’re doing.

"Sarat pumping Qualcomm on CNBC just a minute ago, calls Qualcomm best value buy. While that may be true, Qualcomm still gets the middle finger from the market"
Aapl reports today. Will be interesting to see what happens to QCOM
apple earnings truly a nothing burger to QCOM share price. You want fries with that shorts?
"I think GOD is a person that’s paid to say bad things about QCOM, like Tom said. No one can be that obsessed with a stock they don’t own."
AMD surpasses market cap of QCOM. Our day will come.
"Nasdaq green, Qualcuunt Red, sound familiar?"
Two significant events this evening. 1) we learned what the drag on the stock has been - Apple's 10M phone cut due to chip shortages from BRCM & TI (thanks Bruce) - side note: QCOM will divert that supply to other areas as they have demand that can use that capacity no doubt...but market reacts to anything Apple. 2) Share buy back - QCOM showing confidence and defending their value... huge. More to come likely as we near ER.
"Tom, I understand what you’re saying, but the fact is that Apple is 18% of Qualcomm business. Apple doesn’t use their Snapdragon chips, did you not know this? Apple has their own processor and so a modem as you know is built entirely different then a processor with reference to Snapdragon which does in a lot of cases incorporate their modem as well, but we are talking different capacity requirements when it comes to the two technologies"
AMD reported stellar earnings. QCOM will blow away estimates. The difference between the two is that AMD is already prized sky high while QCOM is priced laughably low. It is coming boys and girls.
"10,9 B buyback means 7.7% of shares, that means EPS will be better by 7.7%.But maybe the best message of this news is QCOM is in very good financial condition, last quarter cash flow was probably beyond expectation and next ER will hopefuly beat estimates by significant margin."
Beautiful article…https://semianalysis.substack.com/p/qualcomm-rffe-business-continues
"So QCOM will again end up with the highest adjusted earnings per share in the sector and the lowest PE! The most undervalued stock in this tech sector. Earnings whisper has us at 2.39 per share, consensus is 2.26. My estimate is 2.46 about a 9 percent beat and over 13percent beat for the year."
5 star stock QCOM is. 20 percent bump up after earnings next week!!
"I know it is difficult to think about the future as we watch QCOM stock fall...but important to keep your eye on the prize. Following on to Bruce's post below, this is worth understanding. QCOM is launching their own console - another indication they are going into Branded products - higher margin. Note also the PR below is India based and release is Q1 of 2022 (will be mentioned Nov 16). Amon is all about building markets and he is moving fast building markets and products. QCOM is reinventing themselves and this price action is real indication. ""ALL"" big tech had this corrective wave before rising (FB, AMZN, Dell, etc.) - so don't be discouraged. I also think margin debt was likely high in QCOM - this is a shake the tree to free up shares - I am convinced. Indications are the lower volume and block buys we see. https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/gaming/qualcomm-working-on-android-console-to-rival-nintendo-switch-report-7568523/"
"From what I understand, Google is going to be using their own SOC and an older version of Samsung’s modem. I’m trying to think of reasons why they would do that. Their own chip makes pictures better, but why not use Qualcomm modem at least? It must come down to price. Google doesn’t need the very best modems in its phones, and carriers don’t all seem to offer the full 5G connectivity experience yet anyway so Googles customers aren’t missing out on much. On the surface this seems like a bad thing for QCOM. Initially I’m sure it’s kind of bad news. Google has to choose the lower cost provider. But this also means that QCOM is making more per modem because they have the better product. Google doesn’t need this now, but eventually most companies will want better and better modems which QCOM can provide, at high margins."
Have people thought about the Taiwan situation. Big article in NY times today about Taiwan and china takeover. If we think what would happens in 5 years if China takes over Taiwan by force (NY Times says it is likely)...what would actually happen to QCOM ? Can people comment on this. Wonder if this explains the price action as well ?

Good volume in the close for the weekend
Amon promises some excited news at Nov. 16 by urging to not miss it:(https://mobile.twitter.com/cristianoamon)Should be something interesting as I said.
"There you have it, he just said the impact is to legacy nodes and NOT leading edge nodes (QCOM)."
"Gee could we be in for an earnings surprise????????Samsung Tops Profit Estimates After Chip Crunch Lifts PricesSamsung Electronics Co. third-quarter profit exceeded analysts’ estimates after a prolonged semiconductor shortage boosted prices of memory and system chips that go into computers and mobile devices.Net income rose to 12.06 trillion won ($10.3 billion) in the three months ended September, South Korea’s largest company said in a statement on Thursday. Analysts predicted 11.54 trillion won on average, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Samsung disclosed preliminary numbers earlier this month, including a more than 25% increase in operating profit.The world’s biggest maker of memory chips and smartphones has benefited from strong demand as the global economy recovers from the Covid-19 pandemic, with rising semiconductor prices providing an added boost.

Equipment manufacturers, smartphone firms, and semiconductor companies are all trying to put their respective stamps on global 5G. Winning the race means potentially dominating for years. This competitive landscape exists across all facets of 5G and has companies across the globe trying to win.In terms of smartphones, The Wall Street Journal reported that Apple, Inc. is the early leader, capturing 28.3% of the 5G phone market in the first half of 2021 (as measured in shipments), according to International Data Corporation (IDC). Next is Guangdong Oppo Mobile Telecommunications Corp. with 14.4%, then Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd (SSNLF) at 13.9%, Vivo Mobile Communication Co. at 13.5%, and Xiaomi Corporation (XIACF) rounding out the top five at 11.2%.1Key TakeawaysApple is reportedly an early leader in 5G smartphones, capturing 28.3% of the market in the first half of 2021.Apple's early lead in 5G is at least partly attributable to the availability of many different 5G-capable iPhone models.Considerable challenges to full 5G rollout and adoption remain, including the semiconductor shortage, ‘’’BUT THESE ARE LIKELY SMALL BUMPS ON THE LONG ROAD OF PROGRESS.’’’The Journal report indicated the market for 5G smartphones is expected to grow from $161.4 billion in 2020 to $361.8 billion this year, per IDC estimates. It could then grow to an estimated $454.7 billion by 2025. Additionally, the Journal reported that 5G smartphone production is picking up. Mobile-phone chip giant Qualcomm Incorporated (QCOM) said that growing adoption could raise shipments of 5G phones to the upper end of its forecast for 2021 of 450 million to 550 million units.1Apple's early lead in 5G is at least partly attributable to the availability of many different 5G-capable iPhone models. Every iPhone 12 model and later ships ready for 5G. Customers looking for the latest and greatest have no choice other than 5G phones, whether it is Apple or another brand.However, the race is still in its early days. The iPhone 12 was introduced only about a year ago, in October 2020. New technologies like 5G take time to roll out. Major carriers such as Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ), AT&T Inc. (T), T-Mobile US, Inc. (TMUS), and others are building out their 5G networks. So, even with a 5G-enabled phone, it may not yet be possible to find a 5G signal, depending on location. However, that probably won't last long, as Apple said that it expects 5G networks to be available from more than 200 carriers in 60 countries and regions worldwide by 2022.Still, considerable challenges to full 5G rollout and adoption remain. For instance, the semiconductor shortage plaguing many industries is claiming victims among 5G device makers, Apple included. According to Barron's, Apple was scheduled to produce 90 million new iPhones in the fourth quarter of this year. However, the company will likely reduce its iPhone 13 production target by up to 10 million units because of part shortages.2 This news, announced on Oct. 12, caused Apple's stock to slip by 0.91% on the day and another 0.42% the following trading day.34The Bottom Line5G networks and devices continue to grow in numbers around the world. The next-generation wireless standard holds much promise, but full rollout and implementation of such technologies takes time. Companies at all levels of 5G are competing hard to win market share and assert dominance.Apple is an early, big leader in 5G smartphones as measured in units shipped, but it's a long race, and the competition is formidable. Also, component shortages are causing problems for 5G firms, including Apple. However, these are likely small bumps on the long road of progress. (Apple investors seem to feel this way given the small losses emanating from news of expected production dips.)https://www.investopedia.com/apple-aapl-is-early-phone-leader-in-heated-5g-race-5206346?utm_campaign=quote-yahoo&utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=referral"

Let’s dream for a moment. Let’s imagine QCOM has been able to raise prices slightly and grow all divisions and reports $2.55. Let’s imagine they guide $3 for the xmas Quarter. Let’s imagine others cannot ignore that this is a growth company.
"Just a massive underperforming stock 80% of the time. It has no ability, and hasn’t for almost a year to outshine the market big in one day or even against its peers. NOT 1 day! What I mean by that is have Qualcomm up 4% on a non earnings day and market flat, and other semis flat. NOT 1 effing day has this piece of  been able to do it this whole year!"
"When I got into QCOM bigtime it was about $55 behind NVDA. Boy am I disappointed… but I realize how extremely cheap it is now, this is an amazing opportunity everyone."
We bought Nuvia for 1.4 Billion to lessen reliance on ARM and We got Veoneer for 4.5 Billion to get more in to the auto industry tech. Why not use the 10 Billion to grow those two business instead of a share buyback could it be they think the stock is super cheep now ?
"My key takeaway from this Apple news''''''' (Apple (AAPL) will have to cut 2021 iPhone production goals of 90 million handsets by up to 10 million handsets due to extended chip shortages, Bloomberg News reported, citing sources. The Dow Jones tech titan reportedly is telling manufacturers that Broadcom (AVGO) and Texas Instruments (TXN) aren't delivering enough components)'''''is that nowhere in the news is it said that QCOM was the cause of the supply chain problem, so as Kingspellchecker has already pointed out, QCOM will make other customers (of which their are MANY) happy to get their chips a bit earlier with 10 million chips that were allocated opening up for sale and possibly even at a higher profit ratio than APPL brings to the table!"

Apple CC will be very enlightening. Part of me thinks they are just losing share in China and India to superior phones and using chip constraints as an excuse...its Apple for Pete's sake...they can use their leverage with suppliers and should be the first served. Could take some lessons from QCOM. They will be asked where the constraint is coming from and whether the $6B will move forward or is lost. Also any questions around maintaining orders and building inventory or dropping orders... etc. Very interesting call coming up.
"Honor has launched its first phones outside of China since becoming an independent organization, it comes complete with access to Google software and Qualcomm chips.The $614 Honor 50 will launch in 40 markets across the world."
"Johns. You have to be realistic here. The market looks six months ahead. So let’s go back and look at Q2 and Q3 earnings, they were great and the stock is lower today then six month ago. I believe the reason for this is because it knows there will not be a big beat this quarter and guidance for Q1 will be soft in terms of the $2.60 analysts currently have. There is 0 reason for the PE contraction that has gone on now for the last 6-9 months other then a light beat when they report and poor guidance. When the CFO was interviewed, I believe like six weeks ago, he really focused the supply they’ll have , being in good shape come the December quarter. I should have seen this as a sign that this report upcoming will be just ok, not great. I believe the market already knows this and also believe it’s looking out six months from now, extrapolating even Q2 numbers. Unfortunately, I don’t see Qualcomm stock moving until sometime in February, where it will then really turn, but that’s if the economy remains ok as you know. Currently, our President is trying to destroy this country by many different measures. Keep that factor in mind as well when it comes to the stock market over the next 6-12 months"

"after buyback announcement, the volume is significantly reduced. it is curious."
Remember the goal of this price action.....hedge funds go on a buyer's strike with each other and short this with the sole goal to get retail to capitulate so they can then not only cover but go long prior to what they know will be stellar earnings and guidance and a very bullish investor meeting in early Nov.

"QCOM is fighting past technical damage and is pressing against resistance. Once it gets through this resistance it'll pop up fast to the next level of resistance. Because it's taking its sweet time going up, it's also creating nice levels of support protecting the stock from crashing down."
Also note that the buyback is accretive to earnings per share. Valuation models will be reworked for 2022. Also note that PR said they can transact directly with investors. This means if a fund wants to exit some shares...they now call QCOM who will pay a slight premium for the shares to keep them from dragging on the open market (or dark pools). I really do hope they buy a lot down here in 120s and 130s ...will reduce outstanding shares quicker.
Qualcomm (QCOM) Sentiment Negative and iPhone Transition Unlikely a 2021 Event - Piper SandlerPiper Sandler analyst Harsh Kumar reiterated an Overweight rating and $175.00 price target on Qualcomm
"Rich - so far today, you have posted that:- will go red in a bit- down she goes- never closes at high into the day- will close 132.50 - will close + .15... - etc. etc.I really want to thank you, as I think the record posts you made today may have been what we needed to break the 133 resistance (to be confirmed tomorrow based on Apple news...could lose it). It doesn't fail that when you post the stock rises... today another example."
Let’s guess exact numbers. CNBC is guessing $2.26 this quarter and guidance of $2.59.Whisper Numbers is guessing $2.39.I’ll guess $2.44 and $2.70 guidance.
"As the market moves toward record highs, QCOM holds steady as a rock! Terrible stock."
QCOM and TSLA will go hand to hand with 5G connectivity
it is better for qcom to lose apple as a customer. I think qcom can survive without Apple soon. having Apple as a customer is more toxic than benefits. lots of Apple suppliers are out of business.
I think Apple should just buy QCOM for $160/share instead of making their own chips. Then they’ll have an inroad to many other areas like Auto and IOT
Is Qualcomm in trouble? (Serious question). Have been in it for a couple years and the sentiment seems pretty negative on this forum
"An example of ""one"" of QCOM's Digital Transformation solutions that will change business. The 800lb gorilla in the room...when everyone is hyper focused on handsets.

See ACN stock over the last six months for proof).Google QCOM Zyter for the articles on this... Yahoo doesn't let me post the link."
"Chester, when you say “big surprise”, that is very vague. A lot will be told on the Apple report, not only for their numbers today, but in their guidance as it relates to Qualcomm. I would consider a big surprise being $2.60 for Qualcomm and guiding for $2.85 for Q1, but I don’t see this at all with the stock behavior over the past several weeks."
AAPL miss shows how desperately they need QCOM chips. Smart money will flow back in QCOM at a faster rate now. There might be some shifting going on from hyperinflated tech stocks to chip makers and other manufacturers.
What has always puzzled me is that wholesale pricing for chips modums and anything intellectual is intellectual is always scrutinized is scrutinized and penalized By governments et cetera and these are the very companies that make any product exist in the 1st place.. That said the the retail market a market can charge as much as they wanthere's they want and nobody says a word. For example Apple complained and sued Qualcom in order to not pay the fees qualcom requested I stood even though it was already signed off in a contract. But Apple charges extraordinary amounts of money for every single product they sell retail. same for all retailers.
"Mr Market time to pay attention.....That being said, there was another big mobile semis story this week. Qualcomm unveiled its new RF chips. We have written a lot about Qualcomm’s dramatic change of fortunes in the RF space (and here and here). Put simply, Qualcomm has gone from almost a joke in RF to a powerhouse. They have had the capabilities to build RF products for over a decade, but it took them a long time to get the organization to the right place, and now that they have, they are firing on all cylinders.In particular, they launched a new line of filters. RF modules on phones are a collection of parts: filters; power amplifiers (PA); and a bunch of other stuff (these things are pretty complicated). Since the launch of 4G, which brought a lot of new spectrum bands into play, we have been living in a Golden Age of RF content in phones, and nowhere is that more true than with filters. With phones tapping into all sorts of radio frequencies, and with many of those frequencies laying pretty close to each other filter requirements have gone way up. Leading filter makers like Broadcom, Murata and Qorvo (in that order) have done very well. But now, just like everyone else in RF, they have to contend with Qualcomm looking to eat their lunch.In all fairness, we still do not know a lot about the new Qualcomm chips. Filters are very difficult to manufacture profitably, the manufacturing process is very challenging with very tight specs. So we do not yet know how well these product will do commercially, but our sense is that they would not have launched them if they had not already gotten these to a fairly mature stage. Note they are already sampling these to customers with volume production expected later next year.All of this is bad news for the other filter makers, but it is also likely good news for companies like Rubicon who we suspect are providing the specialized SOI wafers for Qualcomm’s RF line and Global Foundries who has built a nice SOI foundry business.But as we were reading this, we realized there are broader implications. For years, Qualcomm has had to use its core modem and AP business lines to “encourage” customers to buy its lagging RF products. But now the tables may be finally reversing, whereby the RF products can help pull customers to other Qualcomm parts. (We say finally because this was the original promise of Qualcomm entering the market ten plus years ago.) Qualcomm’s RF products may be able to not only expand Qualcomm’s Total Addressable Market (TAM), but may also start protecting the core product lines.Qualcomm has a big advantage in the RF market. Because they make all the chips in the phone related to communication (i.e. everything but the screen and memory), they can tightly couple their RF products to the compute engine in the AP. This gives “intelligence” (or at least digital logic) to the RF chain which can have a big impact on the performance of the phone. Go back to that Ars article about Google’s Tensor, a lot of the same thinking applies here to the way that well designed compute can have an impact on other parts of the phone. In Qualcomm’s case, this can go even further. Using digital logic and a lot of tricky design work, Qualcomm’s integrated RF chain can actually reduce the filter requirement of a phone (among many other enhancements). So in the hypothetical case where Qualcomm’s new RF chips are maybe not quite as good as other companies’ filters, they can likely make up for the shortfall with this integration. This fully integrated RF Front End (RFFE) has long been the Holy Grail of RF companies, and Qualcomm is likely on the cusp of delivering that. They have already demonstrated one for fixed wireless access points, and if we had to guess we would say that Qualcomm is probably going to announce a fully mobile version at next year’s Mobile World Congress (if the show happens).The importance of this extends beyond the RF space. If Qualcomm can really deliver on this (and by no means is it certain) then they will once again have a differentiated product, something that no one else has. This will be trouble for their arch-nemesis Mediatek whose market share this has overtaken Qualcomm for the first time. Mediatek has some RF assets, but lags considerably. But this is also important for the smartphone makers. All the leading smartphone makers have now been forced to build their own APs, with Apple going so far as to build its own modems, but none of them can make RF products. If Qualcomm’s RF products are as good as they could be, their customers will have to rethink their AP plans. They will turn to Qualcomm’s AP because it will be able to deliver far superior RF performance. In theory, Apple with a few hundred billion dollars in cash on its books could build its own RF chips, but it would take a long time to get there, certainly beyond the 2024 timeline when everyone thinks they will have their own modem. If they really wanted to avoid Qualcomm, Apple wou"
I wonder how long will Qualcomm jiggle around 132?
"Always underperforming, and on CNBC, when Josh Lipton was talking about Apple reporting today, he mentioned how Qualcomm has been the worst performing supplier this year to Apple but Skyworks and Broadcom are up nicely this year, LOL!"

"Yesterday, Grayson had a very relevant post which I think needs brought to the top of the message board - so re-posting it here (see below). This is a question to Amon from the recent Canaccord Genuity investor call. Also connect the dots with Greg's recent post on Honor launching. Combine Honor and the expanded Apple business...not to mention VIVO and other OEMs all launching flagship phones... then add IOT growth...Auto and the fact QCOM is going to speak about the future on Nov 16 ...this future to include NUVIA and other markets we likely haven't even heard of. Question:""And a concern for investors I get in some conversations too is while you're procuring more supply, some of your smartphone customers may be hitting some component shortages from other areas that might limit some of your sales in the back half of the calendar year.""Amon's responseLook, we continue to have more demand and supply across all businesses. And if there's one thing that we learned from this semiconductor supply crisis is many industries now realize the importance of semiconductors, which is a good thing. It's a good thing. I'll tell you, in one bizarre way, it created a lot of direct relationships between Qualcomm and many of the end customers given the importance of semiconductors. Now where we are right now in the supply chain, we had said we'll see material improvements towards the end of the year. We're on track to dothat. We basically took advantage of every possible capacity available. We multisourced a number of our products. Scale really helped us. We're multi-sourcing from leading node to legacy node. We launched new multi-sourcing products in record time. I think we talked about the 778G in 6 nanometer. And we launched with a brand-new customer, which is Honor, one that we didn't have a relationship. And we'll see things improving. I am continuing to be optimistic about the outlook of the industry for '22. 5G has been very resilient. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we reiterated our numbers for the calendar year. And based on what we have, line of sight, we're not that worried about demand. And we feel good about having the supply to start approaching the demand level as we get into 2022"
Think they may wanto take this below 132 again…

Chances for an INTC bounce are MUCH greater that this turd going anywhere soon."
"We were all wondering what happened over the last 6 weeks with QCOM, the sudden drop in share price eventually into the 120s. It was a mystery... many of us searched hard and only found positive developments. Now we know what happened and it probably went something like this. Wall Street (Hedge Funds, et al) have feelers and sources out as we all know. Many at Apple. They began to get wind from ""sources"" that Apple was struggling with supply to build phones, laptops, pads. They were struggling no doubt... so they began shorting the suppliers of Apple in a general sense anticipating, as in years past, the impact Apple has on profits if they don't do well. They leaked supply issues here and there -but eventually were hitting a wall and had to make something big public ...so through their trade rag lemmings, they decided to announce that Apple will ""likely"" cut phones by 10M.. very vague and no specifics. In all liklihood, Apple is having more issue with their Macbooks and iMacs due to ethernet shortage than the phones. Also the phones will not be cut - but delayed if anything... also Apple will no doubt put preference on higher end models than lower end models. Net net... the impact to QCOM is unknown, but nothing to worry about - short term if anything at all. QCOM likely to fill that vacuum capacity with other demand... or Apple will keep their buy contracts with QCOM to keep the supply coming."
"It appears that Apple faced shortages from other suppliers. What I wonder is if Apple took more product from Qualcomm then they could actually use. Normally, with Apple, they would say nope, but they may very well have taken inventory above and beyond because why would they risk losing the allowed capacity knowing the constraints of the industry. So with that said, Mediatek does NOT supply Apple with any modems folks, so if Apple built 38 million IPhones, they very well could have taken more modems then they could actually use. Apple said the shortage cost them $6 billion so they would have beaten revenue by 6% instead of a slight miss. The only thing I’m hoping for is that Qualcomm winds up hitting the high end of its sales range, being $9.2 billion and somehow increased margins on QTC to 33% or better."
"My Testimony about QualcommThis post is divided into:1. What Qualcomm used to be, until recently2. What Qualcomm is now3. What Qualcomm will develop into1. What Qualcomm was until recently:Qualcomm has, for decades been a leader in the development of foundational cellular technology, which has given it the right to charge license fees on all phones, all brands, smart or not, that use 3G, 4G and 5G technology, this meaning, pretty much all phones that exist. This was a good business with super high margins.Qualcomm has also used its superior inside knowledge about those standards, in order to develop the (by far) best modems in the business, and for the last decade developed SoCs that besides the modem, includes pretty much all intelligence on the phones.Though successful, here has been a couple of downsides to this strategy:a) Smartphones turned into a stagnant business in the late 2010’s,b) Their licence model was challenged by for example Apple, Huawei and FTC.c) More than 90% dependence on cellular phones.While Qualcomm was a money-making machine with cool dividends, their stagnant growth and constant challenges to their licencing created the perception of a company at war with its large customers, so it kept the stock from taking off. Many investors unfortunately still think of them that way. 2. What Qualcomm is nowIn the last few years, the picture has changed greatly, driven primarily by:a) Settlements and wins with Apple, Huawei and FTCb) The emergence of 5Gc) Qualcomm focus on high growth product lines besides smartphones.Some detail:a) Especially FTC dropping its lawsuit entirely after the appeals court ruling as well as the Apple settlement were hugely important for Qualcomm. Sure, some countries or entities may fuss a little and create some relatively minor troubles, but when it comes to license fees, the sailing will be much smoother going forward. b) In general, investors don’t understand just how complex 5G modems are, and how far ahead Qualcomm are any other company. It is a joke to believe that Apple, with their acquired Intel failed modem division, would have a product ready by 2023 as some “analysts” seem to believe. It will likely take 5years or more. Also, MediaTek lags far behind, and are confined to low end phones.As Qualcomm is stating, and the numbers show, 5G unit prices are about 50% higher than 4G. Evidence: QCOM handset sales first 9 months FY2021 are $12,14 vs $7,46B same period FY2020 . There is also an ongoing windfall, from Huawei, who used other suppliers than QCOM, has exited the handphone business, and that market is mainly taken over by QCOMs best customers Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo and Honor, the guys that buy Qualcomm’s excellent complete SoC’s, and together supply about 45-50% of all 5G phones. This transition will be noticeable in the next few quarters. Margins are enhanced by the ongoing gradual introduction of mmWave.c) New High Growth Products – Recent high growth product are divided into 3 segments:- IOT (Internet of Things) – This segment increased a whopping 83% y/y for the last quarter and is now the largest area outside of handsets with 1,40B in quarterly sales. It includes high growth areas like computing, industrial, and edge networking.- RFFE – In this area Qualcomm has grown from a minor player to the largest supplier in the world in just a couple of years. It grew 87% in the first 9 months this year. Qualcomm expects continued high growth there with integrated system designs, using its strong market position to sell systems to existing customers.- Auto – Probably the most exiting future area of the company. It grew 60% y/y first 9 months this year, Qualcomm has an order book of about 10 BUSD and has 23 of the the 26 leading auto brands as its customers already. The recent acquisition of Veoneer’s ADAS properties positions QCOM well to become the world leading supplier in automated driving functionality.Total sales this year (FY21) will exceed 33B according to Yahoo Finance consensus compared to last year just 21,7B. Next year sales is estimated at 36,6B, but estimates are bumped up each quarter, and based on the developments outlined above, sales should be around 42B and EPS around $12 rather than current consensus of $9.28.3. What Qualcomm will develop intoQCOMs handset business growth will eventually slow, even though gradual growth of mmWave can counter-balance that. However, other fast growing segments will be more than 50% of the business soon. Margins are higher there. Auto is hugely exciting after Veoneer is integrated.Therefore I predict that EPS will grow to $15 per share in 2023, and onward to $18 per share in 2024.Bottom LineAs it becomes clear that Apple are nowhere near launching their own iPhone modem, and also clear how QCOM growth businesses are taking over, forward PE should rise from todays 14 to somewhere between 25 and 30. This makes me expect a stock price of 375 to 540 in 2-3 years’ time."
