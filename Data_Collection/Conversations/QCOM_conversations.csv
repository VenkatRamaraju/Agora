"Qualcomm and ZTE Achieve Landmark 5G mmWave ResultsThis marks the first connection in China using 5G NR standalone Dual-Connectivity (NR-DC, or FR1+FR2 DC) with one 200 MHz carrier in the 26 GHz (n258) mmWave band, along with one 100 MHz carrier in the 3.5 GHz (n78) band, achieving a peak downlink speed of over 2.43 Gbps using a single device. In the tests, the companies also achieved a peak downlink speed of over 5 Gbps using a single device employing carrier aggregation with four 200MHz carriers in the 26 GHz (n258) mmWave band and successfully tested two 200 MHz mmWave carriers on the uplink. The use of standalone (SA) that uses a 5G Core (5GC) network allows for capabilities such as network slicing and lower latency.“China has been pushing ahead with 5G development on a stable track, and mmWave will be a key focus of 5G in the future,” said Wen Ku, Vice Chairman of the Council and Secretary General, China Communications Standards Association (CCSA). “For the next step of 5G, we should fully leverage the advantages of 5G mmWave technology to unlock higher benefits and empower a digital, intelligent society. CCSA will support and advance the development of mmWave technology for enhanced 5G network experiences in China.”"
Lenovo official confirms that the Legion 3 Pro (aka Legion Duel 3) will use the Snapdragon 898The General Manager of Lenovo’s smartphone business in China posted about the Legion 3 Pro – a future gaming flagship that will use the Snapdragon 898 chipset (SM8450). The GM mentioned the much upgraded GPU of the upcoming chip.The new phone will probably have active cooling – the Legion 2 Pro (aka Duel 2) had two fans – which should keep the new Snapdragon chip running at top speed. This should avoid any throttling and allow the new chip to perform at its best.https://m.gsmarena.com/lenovo_official_confirms_that_the_legion_3_pro_aka_legion_duel_3_will_use_the_snapdragon_898_chipset-news-50647.php
Green Friday with Big gains and Rich tears
"Tom, I’ll stop complaining when this stock gets a forward valuation of a PE that is 20-22X, which is that of the S&P."
"Snapdragon 895 to arrive later this year with upgraded GPUThere is still a while before the next Qualcomm Snapdragon processor makes its debut. But like for everything else in the industry, the rumors regarding the upcoming Snapdragon 895 are preceding its release. According to the recent information by way of a social media update from Lenovo China’s General Manager Chen Jin, the forthcoming Snapdragon 895 will have a “greatly upgraded GPU.”https://androidcommunity.com/snapdragon-895-to-arrive-later-this-year-with-upgraded-gpu-20210826/"
"Fast Money , Steve Weiss continues his rant on QCOM : says everyone in the industry distances from their strong arm tactics, AAPL will soon have their modem , etc. I recall Weiss last November singing the blues to Jim Lebenthal because he missed the boat on the semi’s. Weiss would rather have QRVO & SWKS , but I notice that he sold his positions 2 weeks ago : it seems Weiss is a day trader , unlike Jim Lebenthal who is long on QCOM."
"There is a lot of talk lately about MRVL stock performing well and not QCOM. However, consider this - if you look at the average analyst targets for MRVL which is $62.00 (may go up slightly after their ER). Would you want to enter that position now? The stock is trading in that area. Sure they are doing well and will grow more, but ...not the kind of stock I am looking for. Then you look at QCOM - Analysts average target is $182 - knowing what we know, it sure seems like a better stock to enter."
"Lenovo expands manufacturing in India to meet rising demand...India with a population of 1.33 BILLION people, is a rising market for QCOM, reinforced by partnerships with companies like Lenovo and Jio.Once India's governmental bodies get out of the way with regard to their spectrum auctions, Jio has plans, to replace their entire wireless infrastructure, which will surely make them the number one wireless company in India. http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/85668001.cms?utm_source=contentofinterest&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=cppst"
Motorola Edge 20 Pro with Qualcomm Snapdragon 870 expected to launch in India in September https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/motorola-edge-20-pro-with-qualcomm-snapdragon-870-expected-to-launch-in-india-in-september-1846006-2021-08-27
"QCOM almost always beats analysts earnings estimates. Lets say QCOM surprises and reports $2,50. That's $10 this year. x 22 and we are at $220. Simple math."
"Some people on this board are very short sighted, noting the strong valuations of companies like Marvell and NVIDIA. One needs to ask themselves why their valuations are high - the answer is they are in either the Datacenter (high margins) or Edge (Cloud). QCOM has quietly signed a deal with Foxconn a few weeks ago to partner with them on an AI Accelerator box called ""Gloria"" using QCOM's new Cloud AI 100 designed for AI inference acceleration. They have their first customer BKAV - releasing products next year.Nguyen Tu Quang, Chairman & CEO, BKAV. “Gloria will support us to accelerate AI applications in businesses and government, and revolutionize our work with smart cities, smart construction, and agriculture, among other verticals.” QCOM is one of the few - if not the only - company going up against NVIDIA's AI technology. Believe it or not, the Cloud AI 100 has 3 times better latency and lower power than NVIDIA. Now, NVIDIA has a large portfolio of products and use cases vary, etc. However, QCOM has the premier 5G Sub-6 and mmWAVE WAN connectivity options that go along with their solutions. This development is worth paying attention to if you are a QCOM long investor. There are rumors of a very large ""Cloud"" customer buying the Gloria solution, when looking at TCO and 5G applications - QCOM/Gloria will have an advantage over NVIDIA! Going back to some previous posts I have had explaining what Jensen said during their last ER about the rapid expansion of AI (Doubling every 2 months), it is worth watching. It also will be a VERY high margin product for QCOM. I expect we will learn more in the coming months - and especially on Nov 16th. It is clear that there is a digital industrial revolution happening and AI & 5G is at the center - Jensen said it is the biggest thing he has ever seen. So for now, QCOM is still being valued as a mobile chip set company, but for those paying attention - they can clearly see that is very short lived. QCOM will be a behemoth in the new Digital Industrial Revolution."
Another hit piece about Google going with Samsung's modem instead of Qualcomm for all 38 phones they will sell this year.
"First of all thank you to KingSpellChecker for the great analysis you do.If QCOM usually beats estimates we can expect well over $2 per quarter from now on so about $10 per year total. According to BigCharts, right now the PE is on the low side and a more normal PE is about 22 for this stock. $10 x 22 = $220. That is my 12 month price target and I’m ignoring all the other noise."
"Qualcomm investors on this board… keep this in mind…if you are investing…sometimes price of the stock doesn’t always reflect true value of the company. I own Qualcomm for long time, in fact it is my biggest holding. Sometimes it’s frustrating to see your stock not performing as well as some of its peers, but venting and emotional remark one makes doesn’t really help anyone. In fact your remark can actually hurt shareholders like myself. I am holding on to my qcom shares because I believe it will reach beyond $200 this year or next. If you don’t believe …I suggest you move on. It’s for the best."
"Interesting comment from Xiaomi conference call…Our premium smartphones continued to gain popularity and attract new Xiaomi users. In the first half of 2021 alone, our premium smartphone shipments exceeded 12 million units globally compared with around 10 million units in all of 2020."
25% upside over the next year? End Q3 2022. Approx $181/share.. thumbs up/down for votes
"One reason PE is lagging is due to perception and valuation of QCOM as a handset chip company. This is largely lower margin products and very cyclical. As Rich points out often, there could be some Apple overhang as well. What is interesting, is that QCOM is quickly building share in higher margin products - USING THE SAME products that are in phones. This strategy is largely leveraging R&D $$ while expanding and diversifying. Soon, their share of revenue from non-handsets will exceed that of handsets (but with largely the same silicon!). It is really a genius strategy that is proving to be very successful as we have seen IOT and Auto revenues increase QoQ - while margins expand. I believe the inflection point of valuation to a higher margin high growth company operating in now the hyperscale or intelligent edge space (selling to Cloud providers) will be seen during the Analyst Day Nov 16. Now is the time to accumulate shares for that event.With regard to the day to day share price - it really doesn't matter at this point unless you are looking for an entry position or playing options. Rich will keep you up to speed on the day to day - but when it comes to his predictions be very careful. Remember it was just last Thursday when he posted """"Under no circumstances will this close above the 50DMA which is $141.90"""" ...ever since then, it has. It is very hard to predict when large positions will begin to enter which can be rapid movement in pps."
"I spent a little time going over Analyst Day discussion in Nov/19. One big takeaway was the significant sandbag they did...in their defense, they were not sure how the 5G rollout would go in terms of tiers and were conservative with RF, didn't include Huawei share upside and assumed MMWave was only Korea/Japan/US. They did stress it was a very confident guide - but it was obvious from the Analysts questions they were disappointed in how conservative they were being. For example for the 3 year guide they used 20% margins on QCT - through 2022! As we have seen they are bumping 30% already. Analysts asked back then why they didn't state 25%... They also stated a CAGR through 2022 for 10% revenue growth... very very conservative.A couple points, the Analyst day in 2019 covered 3 years. We should expect ""Investor"" Day this November to do the same. I really think QCT margin expansion needs to be aggressive this Nov - growing to 40%? Revenue growth CAGR 15% to 20% range. With these items, I believe we will see a new valuation for QCOM moving forward. With AI, AR, ADDS, and IOT ...I think 40% should be in the cards."
its very odd!! QCOM trading more like a dead giant IBM than a key player in 5G.....can someone explain?
"Reliance Jio, is the only telco to gain RMS in Q1: Trai data Reliance Jio is the only telco to gain revenue market share (RMS) in the April-June quarter, helped by strong consumer uptake of its new cheaper JioPhone offers and strong sequential growth in revenue from national long distance (NLD) services.By contrast, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea (Vi) suffered sequential RMS contractions, stung by reduced revenues from NLD services and heavy customer losses in the latter’s case. RMS is a measure of overall telecom market leadership.https://telecom.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/jio-only-telco-to-gain-rms-in-q1-trai-data/85650578"
