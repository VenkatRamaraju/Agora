"when Chinese partents choose the English school for the kids, they usually go online to see other parents comments, many many CHinese parents made the comparasion of all the English school and post it online, beofre I bought this stock, I read a lot of post by the Chinese partenst, from their post online, I feel that there are two major point for this school, first, the kids love its English course, it makes Chinese partents suprised, the kids feel go to its English class is a happy thing, it is not a torture anymore, and also, so far, this is the only English school use the American elemantory book , so, it will spread over internet, specially it is now on NASDAQ, is mean the better management for the school, it makes the reputation better, so I really believe this school will take the big shares of the Kids English school in CHina market. look at edu, its price is over 90, and its Englsih course for CHinese kids is boring, this one should have a good future and be very profitble company."

"according to Frost and Sullivian report , China market, 2016 for the young people English training , has 85.2 billion RMB market, in 2012, it will grow up to 239.8 billion RMB, the grow rate is 23% annualy, huge market. but only few big chain schools in the market, REDU is one of top.2021 it will grow up to"
"there are quite few English school for kids , the big ones, such as edu, most of them, their class do not make kids feel happy to learn, kids feel torture, only the partents push them to go to school, but this shcool, basically I draw the consludion it is the succefful school, since it make kids happy to learn, it use American way to teach, usually Chinese way are more boing and more restrict. make kids happen is hard, and they made it, so I belive it will have a good market in the future."
