GNUS ON THE RISE JUMP IN
This is an amazing company... I’m American and my children go to this school in China. The Chinese are crazy for this school!!!
This stock by Friday under $2
"when Chinese partents choose the English school for the kids, they usually go online to see other parents comments, many many CHinese parents made the comparasion of all the English school and post it online, beofre I bought this stock, I read a lot of post by the Chinese partenst, from their post online, I feel that there are two major point for this school, first, the kids love its English course, it makes Chinese partents suprised, the kids feel go to its English class is a happy thing, it is not a torture anymore, and also, so far, this is the only English school use the American elemantory book , so, it will spread over internet, specially it is now on NASDAQ, is mean the better management for the school, it makes the reputation better, so I really believe this school will take the big shares of the Kids English school in CHina market. look at edu, its price is over 90, and its Englsih course for CHinese kids is boring, this one should have a good future and be very profitble company."

"there are quite few English school for kids , the big ones, such as edu, most of them, their class do not make kids feel happy to learn, kids feel torture, only the partents push them to go to school, but this shcool, basically I draw the consludion it is the succefful school, since it make kids happy to learn, it use American way to teach, usually Chinese way are more boing and more restrict. make kids happen is hard, and they made it, so I belive it will have a good market in the future."
