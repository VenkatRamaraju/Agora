The US stock markets are akin to an open bank to Chinese companies. Why would anyone ever invest money in these duplicitous entities?
"Here we go! Just be patience, it needs time to attract volumes."
"there are quite few English school for kids , the big ones, such as edu, most of them, their class do not make kids feel happy to learn, kids feel torture, only the partents push them to go to school, but this shcool, basically I draw the consludion it is the succefful school, since it make kids happy to learn, it use American way to teach, usually Chinese way are more boing and more restrict. make kids happen is hard, and they made it, so I belive it will have a good market in the future."
"For REDU, it's far more than a Cayman registered firm. Any investors with that view are quite naive IMHO. English education in China is essential. REDU should go back to their high teens at least, if you take a look where its peers TAL, EDU stand today. Use your imagination"

"second, they use American elemary school book ,very important, it not just teach English, it use English to teach the all course, included, math, sinence, it makes Chinese kids are at the same step as the American elemtary school students. that imply, when the kids grew up and go to university or high school in US, it is at the same step, this is very attractive too."
"Q2, revenue was down 55% year over year, and new student enrollment was down 39%. Furthermore, growth was challenged even before COVID-19. this is the stuff that makes secondary offerings occur. a secondary wacks REDU by 50% minimum. Revenues down 55% makes cashflow a real concern."

"up to June 30 of 2017, REDU has 246 schools , at 80 cities in China."
"wait until next financial report come, then the price will increase up to 20 I think."
"when Chinese partents choose the English school for the kids, they usually go online to see other parents comments, many many CHinese parents made the comparasion of all the English school and post it online, beofre I bought this stock, I read a lot of post by the Chinese partenst, from their post online, I feel that there are two major point for this school, first, the kids love its English course, it makes Chinese partents suprised, the kids feel go to its English class is a happy thing, it is not a torture anymore, and also, so far, this is the only English school use the American elemantory book , so, it will spread over internet, specially it is now on NASDAQ, is mean the better management for the school, it makes the reputation better, so I really believe this school will take the big shares of the Kids English school in CHina market. look at edu, its price is over 90, and its Englsih course for CHinese kids is boring, this one should have a good future and be very profitble company."
