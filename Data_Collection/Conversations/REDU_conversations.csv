TP for tomorrow? Round 2 :D
Wishing to see a reversal soon. this stock is going down every year... i hope they get retrieve their original value back!
RISE Education Cayman reached a 52 Week high at 9.09
This stock by Friday under $2
RISE Education Cayman is up 12.95% to 0.81
Any reason for the spike up?
I don't think that REDU has another 10% in gains in it. Looks pretty bad here. I actually found http://the-alphatrader.com/ the other day and their stocks are way better...

"Q2, revenue was down 55% year over year, and new student enrollment was down 39%. Furthermore, growth was challenged even before COVID-19. this is the stuff that makes secondary offerings occur. a secondary wacks REDU by 50% minimum. Revenues down 55% makes cashflow a real concern."
If you watch the trades there are a few large buys followed by a series of small sells. Classic boiler room activity. SEC does not seem interested in these activities.
"I thought we had Good News the price was over $3.30 pre market, Then dropped like a rock! The company is taking in Billions of Dollars SOMEONE OR ALL MANAGEMENT NEEDS TO BE FIRED!"

"It's not a question of if it's going to tank, the question is how hard is it going to tank!"
