"Q2, revenue was down 55% year over year, and new student enrollment was down 39%. Furthermore, growth was challenged even before COVID-19. this is the stuff that makes secondary offerings occur. a secondary wacks REDU by 50% minimum. Revenues down 55% makes cashflow a real concern."

financials poor so i can see why the need insiders/investors to pump and dump
I saw some light
"when Chinese partents choose the English school for the kids, they usually go online to see other parents comments, many many CHinese parents made the comparasion of all the English school and post it online, beofre I bought this stock, I read a lot of post by the Chinese partenst, from their post online, I feel that there are two major point for this school, first, the kids love its English course, it makes Chinese partents suprised, the kids feel go to its English class is a happy thing, it is not a torture anymore, and also, so far, this is the only English school use the American elemantory book , so, it will spread over internet, specially it is now on NASDAQ, is mean the better management for the school, it makes the reputation better, so I really believe this school will take the big shares of the Kids English school in CHina market. look at edu, its price is over 90, and its Englsih course for CHinese kids is boring, this one should have a good future and be very profitble company."
