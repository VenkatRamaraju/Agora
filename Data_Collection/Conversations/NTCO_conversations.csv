"Natura &Co posted another strong performance in the fourth quarter of 2019, with revenue growth at Natura, The Body Shop and Aesop. Consolidated net revenue reached R$4.7 billion in Q4, up 7.3%. Adjusted EBITDA (excluding effects that are not considered recurring nor comparable) was R$816.7 million, up by a strong 12.2%.For the full-year, consolidated net revenue grew 7.8% to R$14.4 billion. Adjusted EBITDA reached R$2 billion, up 7.5%.Underlying Operating Income (UOI), which provides a clearer view of the business’ underlying operating performance, was up in Q4 by a very strong 18.2%, to R$641.2 million. When including Avon-related acquisition costs and taxes related to the corporate restructuring of Natura &Co, net income was R$14.3 million. The quarter also saw Natura &Co make new advances in sustainability: Natura became the first beauty company in Brazil to obtain the Green Patent from the National Institute of Intellectual Property, for the use of residue assets from Brazil’s biodiversity as production inputs, while The Body Shop won Ethical Corporation’s Plastics Innovation award for its Community Fair Trade program.Roberto Marques, Executive Chairman of Natura &Co and Group CEO, declared: “2019 was another year of profitable growth and transformation for Natura &Co. It was of course marked by the announcement of our acquisition of Avon, which we successfully closed just after the New Year. We are creating a group even more committed to making positive social, economic and environmental impact, with a stronger voice to advocate for causes that matter to us”. Natura &Co and Avon have filed their respective Q4 and full year financials separately, considering that in this period the companies were independently managed and the acquisition was only completed on January 3, 2020.Avon continued to execute against its Open Up turnaround strategy throughout 2019 and recorded advances that set a strong foundation for future growth. For the year, Avon’s revenue was down 6% in constant currency, with an expected deceleration in Q4. As anticipated, sales declined as a result of sharper choices made to drive a healthier, more sustainable and profitable business. Average Representative Sales were up 4%, and Avon worked to stabilize the number of Active Reps while restoring field fundamentals and lowering bad debt.Natura’s adjusted net revenue in Brazil was up 3% in Q4, a strong performance as it came against a very challenging comparable base (growth of 11.2% in Q4 2018). Productivity per consultant rose for the 13th consecutive quarter. Hispanic Latam saw growth of 10.6% in net revenue in Brazilian Reais. Argentina posted a solid performance despite a challenging market environment. In the full year, sales were up 4.0% in Brazil and 13.5% in Hispanic Latam (+23.9% in constant currency).The Body Shop continues to make headway in its transformation plan. Net revenue was up 6.7% in Brazilian Reais in Q4 and 6.3% in the full year (+0.9% in constant currency). Sales grew 5.4% in the UK, underscoring the brand’s attractiveness in its biggest market.Aesop delivered an exceptional performance: Revenue increased 25.7% in Reais in Q4. The company opened seven new signature stores in the quarter, bringing the total to 247. In the full year, sales rose 22.5% in Reais and 12.3% at constant currency.Further details can be found on the Natura &Co investor relations website: https://natu.infoinvest.com.br/en."
