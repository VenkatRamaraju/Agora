You guys should load up on $INVA tomorrow. They are one of ETTX largest stake holders. ETTX moved up 24% after hours INVA was flat. They have $25 million or $35 Million in ETTX and about that much for ARMP plus a $250 million investment Sarissa Capital believe the symbol may be SRSA. If ETTX continues advancing or gets approval may move into their royalty or acquisition portfolio which means big bucks for ETTX. Since I own INVA bought all three because I think all three will one day not too far off might be in one grouping. Good luck longs
Innoviva reached a 52 Week high at 17.63
"$tbph Revenue estimates up, momentum score A: $inva $enta $xlrn https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-theravance-bio-tbph-down-153103235.htm"
"Argus says it is 112% discount If $ettx hits on p3 it will rock, inva owns 67% of ettx and warrants"
After reading comments I've learned that INVA likes owning a good piece of other companies. One I didn't see mentioned is ARMP which they bought a lot of last month at $3.25. It is now over $6. I just bought INVA today and will get more if the price drops.
$inva owns most of this company.. fact
low float makes this stock sensitive to short but intense trading. It will recover as fast as it dropped.
What will this company do after drugs go off patent to make good revenue streams? Anything solid or is it all just maybe they will make money on x or y?
"anyone can answer please ? how come 32 million shares are not being reflected on number of shares in earnings, diluted number per share is 100,639,000 from 113,545,000, what happened to 32 million share repurchase of GSK?"
WOW! Here we go ATH tomorrow?! Great earnings and the jump today shows it
I would hate to be short on this - but a lot of folks are.

Wondering if this SPAC is going to be a holding company for Innoviva inc. INVA which has been hitting new highs recently. Saw in the fine print of one of INVA reports that they have funded Sarissa Capital approximately $320 million in cash to diversify their holdings. Not sure if this spac is tied to it or not. It would function as a vehicle for $INVA growth which has hit a new multi year high a few days in a row and is a cash cow bringing in about $80 million a quarter in cash after expenses. I could see INVA creating a holding company for their large position indirect holdings like ETTX and ARMP and maybe some others and combing them into one separate company and keep INVA as a pharmaceutical royalty company with their three or four licensed drugs that they have tie ins with the big pharma players. Then once potential products that get developed from the investments then INVA obtains licenses to add to their portfolio or gains a royalty. Interesting possible way to play it. bought into this thing at $11 a share early this year so sitting on a loss but if they do find a nice target it has the potential to get my money back and then some. Good luck to you all.
Why does this stock have such a high short ratio? It looks solid at first glance!
shorts are about to get squeeeeeezed!!!
Great short squeeze candidate!https://research.ameritrade.com/grid/wwws/research/reports/viewreport?id=2942&documenttag=INVA&c_name=invest_VENDOR
"This company seems very solid on a fundamental basis. It's hard to understand why the analysts don't have more confidence in it. And their highlighted product, for COPD and asthma, seems apropos and could be huge."
"Only 5 employees, and a high short ratio? What could go wrong?"
"$tbph 35% drop yest was def overdone & is clear buying opportunity. So one drug failed, but its royalties from two COPD drugs alone value its stock at $11. Plus add ampreloxetine potential. Price target was cut by 21% which is accurate so the 35% drop puts it at 14% undervalued. After the 21% cut, price target now $29 which is still a 213% upside. https://www.investors.com/news/technology/biotech-stock-theravance-crashes-after-ulcerative-colitis-drug-flops/?src=A00220 $rvnc $inva $enta $xlrn"
