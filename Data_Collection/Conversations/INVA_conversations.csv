FEBRUARY 8 >>>OMG!!!!! Management will actually have to do some work!!! Don't worry it is after market close....they can still sleep in till noon!!
Can't they buy back shares or something to fight off the shorts?
One of the quietest stock you can find. They must just show up and take a long lunch.
Pennies from a new low. Keep up the good work management.
Management and company is corrupt. Lots of data manipulation to revamp stock price. Stock price is really $2.
$TBPH just bought by billionaire guru https://www.conferencecalltranscripts.com/summary/?id=9864201 $rvnc $inva $enta $xlrn
Are these guys going to buy Entasis? They just bought $33mm of their shares.
INVA is down -5.00% to 15.00
We want a divi instead of funnel $$ to hedge funds
COME ON INVA MANAGEMENT EARN YOUR KEEP!!!
NO NEED FOR ANY SCIENTIST OR R AND D PEOPLE!!
Getting stronger again. Hang in there for a nice ride up nice we breakout!
Great short squeeze candidate!https://research.ameritrade.com/grid/wwws/research/reports/viewreport?id=2942&documenttag=INVA&c_name=invest_VENDOR
INVA is up 4.92% to 16.00
"Why does INVA have a ""head of talent Acquisition and strategy"" ? No need to Acquire any new Talent!!! Just collect the check!!"
low float makes this stock sensitive to short but intense trading. It will recover as fast as it dropped.
INVA is down 5.00% to $14.15
Wondering if this SPAC is going to be a holding company for Innoviva inc. INVA which has been hitting new highs recently. Saw in the fine print of one of INVA reports that they have funded Sarissa Capital approximately $320 million in cash to diversify their holdings. Not sure if this spac is tied to it or not. It would function as a vehicle for $INVA growth which has hit a new multi year high a few days in a row and is a cash cow bringing in about $80 million a quarter in cash after expenses. I could see INVA creating a holding company for their large position indirect holdings like ETTX and ARMP and maybe some others and combing them into one separate company and keep INVA as a pharmaceutical royalty company with their three or four licensed drugs that they have tie ins with the big pharma players. Then once potential products that get developed from the investments then INVA obtains licenses to add to their portfolio or gains a royalty. Interesting possible way to play it. bought into this thing at $11 a share early this year so sitting on a loss but if they do find a nice target it has the potential to get my money back and then some. Good luck to you all.
I am confused. Its EPS is +1.17 and stock price is lower than some of negative EPS stocks.
INVA reached a 52 Week low at 10.82
Someone should tell leadership that the quiet period is just a short period of time. They seem to think it is ongoing. #removemanagement
"This company seems very solid on a fundamental basis. It's hard to understand why the analysts don't have more confidence in it. And their highlighted product, for COPD and asthma, seems apropos and could be huge."
Innoviva is up 5.04% to 12.91
INVA reached a new 52 Week High at 15.06
Could be paying down debt so they can buy something that'll pay royalties down the road. The patents/royalties won't last forever. Little to no R&D. What's left when they run out?
"$tbph Revenue estimates up, momentum score A: $inva $enta $xlrn https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-theravance-bio-tbph-down-153103235.htm"
NO NEED FOR LEGAL COUNSEL!!!
JUST VOTED MY SHARES AGAINST COMPENSATION PACKAGE AND AGAINST ALL CURRENT MANAGEMENT!!!
Double the daily volume today. Good sign.
PROFIT OF $2.34 management needs to doing a share buyback at these levels !!!
"Your doing a great job Innoviva, new CEO that wants to advance shareholders value!"
Innoviva reached a 52 Week high at 15.52
"Market nearing all time highs, INVA at new 52 week low. That about says it all. Buy management -- or in this case, sell management."
"wow, they should do something about this leadership, you can't just live off of 4 earnings reports a year, that's terrible."
INVA is up 4.92% to 15.56
Let Sarissa run INVA with (3) employee's!!! How many people do you need to collects a royalty check????
Profits are slowing. INVA missed estimates in 3 of the most recent 4 quarters. Beware.
"Well, now we’re invested in Entasis by proxy, the market seems to think it’s a good idea"
INVA reached a 52 Week low at 10.31
INVA reached a 52 Week low at 12.28
PE 11.86
"Up over 8% today after surprising earnings report. Beating on both REV and EPS. Is this stock not properly valued by the analysts? Seems like it. Thinking we should bust through the current 52 week high of 16.11. Seeing near 20/share possible if the trend of earnings and revenues continues at these higher levels. Also, a buyout by larger entity, GSK is also a possibility now."
"$tbph great buy down 30%, 7/7 unanimous strong buys, avg price target $20.38 over 100% upside https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/tbph/analyst-research $rvnc $inva $enta $xlrn"
"how come 32 million shares are not being reflected on number of shares in earnings, diluted number per share is 100,639,000 from 113,545,000, what happened to 32 million share repurchase of GSK?"
Why would we constantly grant insiders stock at $0 cost. We could put a blow-up doll in the CEO's chair and watch the stock hit new lows.
Down 8%.....shaking out weak holds maybe........
FINALLY DECENT DECISIONS BY MANAGEMENT.
"Nothing but crickets here. Let’s get some traction, everything else is going up but this low PE stock with so much promise."
"With all those youngsters continuously smoking weed, copd is going to become a major health problem in the future. Very bright future for INVA. Possible acquisition target also. GL to all longs."
What’s up with them owning 69% of ettx They know something
Interesting pop at the end of the day yesterday with a decent size volume trade coming in
WHERE ARE THE COST CUTTING MEASURES??????
I guess the earnings will be blowout with extra 32% we got from GSK. I wonder how long we will have to wait for some exciting news this is like watching paint dry
Looks like we will see some drops back to 12
"look back 12 mths support, time to buy, 30 rsi. way oversold."
Just need to chill
Perfect time for corporate to start buying back stock!!
Stock buyback >>> Hello is anyone home ?
visit http://greatchartanalysis.zohosites.com/ .
About to hot 15 once again. Looking/waiting for signal from management about cuts to SG&A or even an expansion of the product beyond the US. New markets=higher sales
"Not mad keen on the capital allocation, especially the risky bets on antibiotic biotechs, but if they're not going to return cash to shareholders then putting it in a long term investment is probably next best.Sarissa Cap look to have a decent investing record based on the info I could find. Let's hope they put the cash to good use..."
Many wishes for GSK to acquire it.
Where are the Cost Cutting Measures???
Vol picking up 3x today
"I thought they brought new guy in to bring shareholders value up. I haven’t seen anything from this guy. Meet the new boss, same as the old boss!"
Innoviva is up 5.10% to 13.60
"Step 1. Search for "" THESTOCKDORK "". Steup 2. Sign up. You wont regret it. This random message board user promises."
"Today is Earnings Day.....either the ""Big Guys"" wanted cheaper shares or ""they"" know something.....we'll know soon enough...."
Innoviva reached a 52 Week high at 17.63
After reading comments I've learned that INVA likes owning a good piece of other companies. One I didn't see mentioned is ARMP which they bought a lot of last month at $3.25. It is now over $6. I just bought INVA today and will get more if the price drops.
INVA reached a 52 Week low at 12.86
Nice little upside surprise.
12 MILLION IN OPERATING EXPENSES>>>TO DO NOTHING!!!!!
check http://tradeanalysis.zohosites.com/ .
Why does this stock have such a high short ratio? It looks solid at first glance!
"""Some additional expenses were incurred in the second quarter in the evaluation of strategic options""Looks like they came up empty. .Don't mind us shareholders. I'm sure you'll find something that fills your pockets."
"The promise of change in the takeover of the company appears to be no more than air. I cannot see any change from what we had before the take over. No dividend, no sale of the company, no added value at all. So what did we gain?"
You guys should load up on $INVA tomorrow. They are one of ETTX largest stake holders. ETTX moved up 24% after hours INVA was flat. They have $25 million or $35 Million in ETTX and about that much for ARMP plus a $250 million investment Sarissa Capital believe the symbol may be SRSA. If ETTX continues advancing or gets approval may move into their royalty or acquisition portfolio which means big bucks for ETTX. Since I own INVA bought all three because I think all three will one day not too far off might be in one grouping. Good luck longs
"anyone can answer please ? how come 32 million shares are not being reflected on number of shares in earnings, diluted number per share is 100,639,000 from 113,545,000, what happened to 32 million share repurchase of GSK?"

"Checkout NVAX guys , time to jump in seems to be going up (risks apply!)"
Great acquisition target. PFE could probably effect a tenderoffer at $15 per share all stock transaction.
Will open a short position tomorrow. This should follow the same path as Assertio.
"Where is this one headed, any ideas?"
NO NEED FOR TALENT ACQUISITION!!
NO NEED FOR ANYONE IN MARKETING!!!
"Well I can’t imagine how earnings will be tomorrow, but it would be nice to beat previous quarter."
"Also, next year earning is expected to be around $0.7 that's some drastic drop do you guys know why analysts expect that kind of drop?"

"Another stellar day without much volume. Currently at 15.70. I'm thinking we get close to 52 week high, then come off and then boost to the mid 18's where it should be."
Why does INVA have a chief scientific officer? All the SCIENCE is DONE!! all they do is collect a royalty check!!
"$tbph 35% drop yest was def overdone & is clear buying opportunity. So one drug failed, but its royalties from two COPD drugs alone value its stock at $11. Plus add ampreloxetine potential. Price target was cut by 21% which is accurate so the 35% drop puts it at 14% undervalued. After the 21% cut, price target now $29 which is still a 213% upside. https://www.investors.com/news/technology/biotech-stock-theravance-crashes-after-ulcerative-colitis-drug-flops/?src=A00220 $rvnc $inva $enta $xlrn"

$inva owns most of this company.. fact
Correction: Latest data shows they do not have 10 employees. They have 6.
"Way to go management. Another new low. By the way. Can I get the details on how a company with 10 employees, that does nothing but collect royalties, spends $4.3 mil on General/Administrative Expenses??Company cars for everyone? Conferences in Switzerland? Sporting event tickets? All the above?"

I'm ready to load up when it finds some support. Looks way over sold to me.
"Stopped back to check on that ""reconstituted Board"" that was put into place to ""enhance shareholder value"". As we can all see, they're doing a bang up job. They deserve 20,000 more stock options -- each."
"I don't understand why this stock is so expensive. I ran values and admittedly i am conservative, but I thought it would be worth around 4. I don't have a short position in this as I don't do shorts. Just looking for a value stock. This company has a couple of products but nothing fantastic or exciting."
slow but sure. Heading toward a buyout of $38
What`s going on with this stock?
Nice volume also
