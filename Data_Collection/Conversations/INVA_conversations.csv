Stock buyback >>> Hello is anyone home ?
INVA is down 5.90% to 11.33
INVA is down 4.91% to 13.74
This is a lonely MB. Why do we own a boring stock even though it is good fundamental. No one interested
Management and company is corrupt. Lots of data manipulation to revamp stock price. Stock price is really $2.
Where are all the bloggers for this stock? This room is empty...
"Denner increased share ownership by 23% reported 8/14, thats 874,295 more shares....interesting"
Could be paying down debt so they can buy something that'll pay royalties down the road. The patents/royalties won't last forever. Little to no R&D. What's left when they run out?
Is someone other than Zacks saying anything about this dog?

NO NEED FOR ANYONE IN MARKETING!!!
Y’ll know this is going down over the next months

"I am really surprised with a stock like this, there?s literally no ongoing chat about this. I have had some real #$%$ stocks and there?s all kinds of conversations. I?m not complaining, just very surprised."
Someone should buy this company and get rid of all the staff. TBPH might be a good buyer.
Where can I find out how much longer their patent(s) last?

"Denner is a man, go INVA."
Money machine here
I guess the earnings will be blowout with extra 32% we got from GSK. I wonder how long we will have to wait for some exciting news this is like watching paint dry
"Up over 8% today after surprising earnings report. Beating on both REV and EPS. Is this stock not properly valued by the analysts? Seems like it. Thinking we should bust through the current 52 week high of 16.11. Seeing near 20/share possible if the trend of earnings and revenues continues at these higher levels. Also, a buyout by larger entity, GSK is also a possibility now."
slow but sure. Heading toward a buyout of $38
Looks like we will see some drops back to 12
INVA reached a new 52 Week High at 15.06

INVA reached a new 52 Week High at 17.39
12 MILLION IN OPERATING EXPENSES>>>TO DO NOTHING!!!!!
Added more 9.97
you guys are all wrong
And now the new management ineptness becomes even more apparent! It appears the 'new' management is the same as the 'old' management. Sit around collecting an overly rewarding paycheck while doing nothing for the shareholders.
Someone should tell leadership that the quiet period is just a short period of time. They seem to think it is ongoing. #removemanagement
"This company seems very solid on a fundamental basis. It's hard to understand why the analysts don't have more confidence in it. And their highlighted product, for COPD and asthma, seems apropos and could be huge."

When do they give back the divi?
"Stopped back to check on that ""reconstituted Board"" that was put into place to ""enhance shareholder value"". As we can all see, they're doing a bang up job. They deserve 20,000 more stock options -- each."

NO NEED FOR ANY SCIENTIST OR R AND D PEOPLE!!
Wondering if this SPAC is going to be a holding company for Innoviva inc. INVA which has been hitting new highs recently. Saw in the fine print of one of INVA reports that they have funded Sarissa Capital approximately $320 million in cash to diversify their holdings. Not sure if this spac is tied to it or not. It would function as a vehicle for $INVA growth which has hit a new multi year high a few days in a row and is a cash cow bringing in about $80 million a quarter in cash after expenses. I could see INVA creating a holding company for their large position indirect holdings like ETTX and ARMP and maybe some others and combing them into one separate company and keep INVA as a pharmaceutical royalty company with their three or four licensed drugs that they have tie ins with the big pharma players. Then once potential products that get developed from the investments then INVA obtains licenses to add to their portfolio or gains a royalty. Interesting possible way to play it. bought into this thing at $11 a share early this year so sitting on a loss but if they do find a nice target it has the potential to get my money back and then some. Good luck to you all.
We want a divi instead of funnel $$ to hedge funds
"I don't understand why this stock is so expensive. I ran values and admittedly i am conservative, but I thought it would be worth around 4. I don't have a short position in this as I don't do shorts. Just looking for a value stock. This company has a couple of products but nothing fantastic or exciting."
INVA is up 8.70% to 15.00
48$ MILLION PER YEAR IN OPERATING EXPENSES TO CASH A ROYALTY CHECK!!!
JUST VOTED MY SHARES AGAINST COMPENSATION PACKAGE AND AGAINST ALL CURRENT MANAGEMENT!!!
"""Some additional expenses were incurred in the second quarter in the evaluation of strategic options""Looks like they came up empty. .Don't mind us shareholders. I'm sure you'll find something that fills your pockets."
Let Sarissa run INVA with (3) employee's!!! How many people do you need to collects a royalty check????

"$tbph 35% drop yest was def overdone & is clear buying opportunity. So one drug failed, but its royalties from two COPD drugs alone value its stock at $11. Plus add ampreloxetine potential. Price target was cut by 21% which is accurate so the 35% drop puts it at 14% undervalued. After the 21% cut, price target now $29 which is still a 213% upside. https://www.investors.com/news/technology/biotech-stock-theravance-crashes-after-ulcerative-colitis-drug-flops/?src=A00220 $rvnc $inva $enta $xlrn"

"Checkout NVAX guys , time to jump in seems to be going up (risks apply!)"
low float makes this stock sensitive to short but intense trading. It will recover as fast as it dropped.

Let's hope they put the cash to good use..."
