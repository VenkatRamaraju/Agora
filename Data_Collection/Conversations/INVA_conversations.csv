INVA is down 6.77% to 12.39
INVA is up 7.45% to 9.38

INVA is down -5.00% to 15.00
"Why does INVA have a ""head of talent Acquisition and strategy"" ? No need to Acquire any new Talent!!! Just collect the check!!"

The fleas are moving the dog
Wow there website is horrible lol
NO selling! NO advertising! NO research! NO clinical trials! What in the sam hell do these people do all day?????
"Denner is a man, go INVA."
"EPS 3.35 and still no divi, little to no expense ....give me back the diviSomething smells"
How many red days in a row is it now?
This was up in pre-market last night $1.87 and it opens flat? #$%$
INVA is down 5.90% to 11.33
INVA is down 4.94% to 13.09
ALL this company does is collect a royalty check!!
Cut your overhead!!!!
everyone's been sleeping while it's breaking out.
"Way to go management. Another new low. By the way. Can I get the details on how a company with 10 employees, that does nothing but collect royalties, spends $4.3 mil on General/Administrative Expenses??Company cars for everyone? Conferences in Switzerland? Sporting event tickets? All the above?"
"Nothing but crickets here. Let’s get some traction, everything else is going up but this low PE stock with so much promise."
And now the new management ineptness becomes even more apparent! It appears the 'new' management is the same as the 'old' management. Sit around collecting an overly rewarding paycheck while doing nothing for the shareholders.
INVA is down 4.93% to 10.03
Looks like we will see some drops back to 12
I think we'll be at 20+ by the EOY.
Lots of positives from technical analysis at stoxline. Long over 16.11 for a run up to 18.82
When are the results coming out? I thought it was July 22.
Someone should buy this company and get rid of all the staff. TBPH might be a good buyer.
Cut your overhead!!!
Innoviva is down 4.95% to 11.13
One of the quietest stock you can find. They must just show up and take a long lunch.
Pennies from a new low. Keep up the good work management.

Sold my GSK and bought TEVA!!
Profits are slowing. INVA missed estimates in 3 of the most recent 4 quarters. Beware.
Double the daily volume today. Good sign.
Y’ll know this is going down over the next months
Where are all the bloggers for this stock? This room is empty...
Dear GSK>>>Get bent!! I hope we never sell out to you!!
SARISSA!!!! Throw management out!!!! Replace all of them with (1) Accountant!!!
They should fire INVA management and replace with new folks. This includes top to bottom staff in SSF.
ETTX will be a big catalyst for INVA at some point this year.
She is due for a bounce today.
Will open a short position tomorrow. This should follow the same path as Assertio.
"I made a video about Innoviva ($INVA)Check it on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6542hJuYRXoRevenue: 78,6$ mln, Operating expenses: 2,5$ mln."

"I don't care what hedge funds think of this stock, I just wonder how management thinks when price can't even hold a breakout from a base!"
INVA is up 5.01% to $14.66
We want a divi instead of funnel $$ to hedge funds
JUST VOTED MY SHARES AGAINST COMPENSATION PACKAGE AND AGAINST ALL CURRENT MANAGEMENT!!!
Management and company is corrupt. Lots of data manipulation to revamp stock price. Stock price is really $2.
WHERE ARE THE COST CUTTING MEASURES??????
"""Some additional expenses were incurred in the second quarter in the evaluation of strategic options""Looks like they came up empty. .Don't mind us shareholders. I'm sure you'll find something that fills your pockets."
"Not mad keen on the capital allocation, especially the risky bets on antibiotic biotechs, but if they're not going to return cash to shareholders then putting it in a long term investment is probably next best.Sarissa Cap look to have a decent investing record based on the info I could find. Let's hope they put the cash to good use..."
Sarissa will Dump their shares now. Watch out below.
Added more 9.97
ALL THIS COMPANY NEEDS IS ONE ACCOUNTANT TO MAKE SURE GSK DEPOSITS ROYALYTIES!!!
"Stopped back to check on that ""reconstituted Board"" that was put into place to ""enhance shareholder value"". As we can all see, they're doing a bang up job. They deserve 20,000 more stock options -- each."
Many wishes for GSK to acquire it.

INVA is down 4.97% to $16.25
CUT YOUR OVERHEAD!!!!!
CUT YOUR COSTS!!!
INVA reached a 52 Week low at 10.31
Why would we constantly grant insiders stock at $0 cost. We could put a blow-up doll in the CEO's chair and watch the stock hit new lows.
"Another stellar day without much volume. Currently at 15.70. I'm thinking we get close to 52 week high, then come off and then boost to the mid 18's where it should be."
Could be paying down debt so they can buy something that'll pay royalties down the road. The patents/royalties won't last forever. Little to no R&D. What's left when they run out?
Great acquisition target. PFE could probably effect a tenderoffer at $15 per share all stock transaction.

Nice little upside surprise.
Where is the divi
"Up over 8% today after surprising earnings report. Beating on both REV and EPS. Is this stock not properly valued by the analysts? Seems like it. Thinking we should bust through the current 52 week high of 16.11. Seeing near 20/share possible if the trend of earnings and revenues continues at these higher levels. Also, a buyout by larger entity, GSK is also a possibility now."
slow but sure. Heading toward a buyout of $38
INVA reached a 52 Week low at 10.65

"$tbph 35% drop yest was def overdone & is clear buying opportunity. So one drug failed, but its royalties from two COPD drugs alone value its stock at $11. Plus add ampreloxetine potential. Price target was cut by 21% which is accurate so the 35% drop puts it at 14% undervalued. After the 21% cut, price target now $29 which is still a 213% upside. https://www.investors.com/news/technology/biotech-stock-theravance-crashes-after-ulcerative-colitis-drug-flops/?src=A00220 $rvnc $inva $enta $xlrn"

After reading comments I've learned that INVA likes owning a good piece of other companies. One I didn't see mentioned is ARMP which they bought a lot of last month at $3.25. It is now over $6. I just bought INVA today and will get more if the price drops.

"The promise of change in the takeover of the company appears to be no more than air. I cannot see any change from what we had before the take over. No dividend, no sale of the company, no added value at all. So what did we gain?"

YES! Maximize shareholder value!! Here is a thought!!! Fire everyone but an accountant to register royalty check! Return ALL savings to shareholders!!!!!!
INVA should reinvent and get new group of people in management and finance/accounting. Accounting/Finance functions can be outsourced since it is a small company. Booking royalties is not rocket science.
Cheap
The market is pretty boring right now. Want stocks that are actually moving? Join THESTOCKDORK (search them)
