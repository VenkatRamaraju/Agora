Innoviva is up 5.28% to 14.36
INVA reached a 52 Week low at 9.17
Correction: Latest data shows they do not have 10 employees. They have 6.
Innoviva is down 5.23% to 9.96
slow but sure. Heading toward a buyout of $38
Wondering if this SPAC is going to be a holding company for Innoviva inc. INVA which has been hitting new highs recently. Saw in the fine print of one of INVA reports that they have funded Sarissa Capital approximately $320 million in cash to diversify their holdings. Not sure if this spac is tied to it or not. It would function as a vehicle for $INVA growth which has hit a new multi year high a few days in a row and is a cash cow bringing in about $80 million a quarter in cash after expenses. I could see INVA creating a holding company for their large position indirect holdings like ETTX and ARMP and maybe some others and combing them into one separate company and keep INVA as a pharmaceutical royalty company with their three or four licensed drugs that they have tie ins with the big pharma players. Then once potential products that get developed from the investments then INVA obtains licenses to add to their portfolio or gains a royalty. Interesting possible way to play it. bought into this thing at $11 a share early this year so sitting on a loss but if they do find a nice target it has the potential to get my money back and then some. Good luck to you all.
"Well I can’t imagine how earnings will be tomorrow, but it would be nice to beat previous quarter."
We want a divi instead of funnel $$ to hedge funds
INVA reached a new 52 Week High at 15.74
Why does INVA have a chief scientific officer? All the SCIENCE is DONE!! all they do is collect a royalty check!!
Nice volume also
"I started following ""lionstock-aletrs” (Gooogle it - off course without any space or dash in between the words) and their notifications are better than anyone else."
Are these guys going to buy Entasis? They just bought $33mm of their shares.
"$tbph Revenue estimates up, momentum score A: $inva $enta $xlrn https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-theravance-bio-tbph-down-153103235.htm"
Management and company is corrupt. Lots of data manipulation to revamp stock price. Stock price is really $2.
"Stopped back to check on that ""reconstituted Board"" that was put into place to ""enhance shareholder value"". As we can all see, they're doing a bang up job. They deserve 20,000 more stock options -- each."
Amazing run steady  during the tornadoes.
Why does anyone work at this company other than an accountant to record an incoming royalty check??? Give me a break!!!
Down 8%.....shaking out weak holds maybe........
"Also, next year earning is expected to be around $0.7 that's some drastic drop do you guys know why analysts expect that kind of drop?"
ETTX will be a big catalyst for INVA at some point this year.
Innoviva reached a 52 Week high at 17.63
INVA reached a new 52 Week High at 17.39
"Not mad keen on the capital allocation, especially the risky bets on antibiotic biotechs, but if they're not going to return cash to shareholders then putting it in a long term investment is probably next best.Sarissa Cap look to have a decent investing record based on the info I could find. Let's hope they put the cash to good use..."
INVA reached a 52 Week low at 9.93
Some so-so news coming. It will drive stock to 14.5-15 soon...
Why would we constantly grant insiders stock at $0 cost. We could put a blow-up doll in the CEO's chair and watch the stock hit new lows.
"Well, now we’re invested in Entasis by proxy, the market seems to think it’s a good idea"
"Im done here, moving to $INVA ( Great news today )"
Money machine here
HEY MANAGEMENT DO SOMETHING>>>>STOCK BUYBACK !!!!
ALL THIS COMPANY NEEDS IS ONE ACCOUNTANT TO MAKE SURE GSK DEPOSITS ROYALYTIES!!!
FEBRUARY 8 >>>OMG!!!!! Management will actually have to do some work!!! Don't worry it is after market close....they can still sleep in till noon!!
I'm ready to load up when it finds some support. Looks way over sold to me.
"how come 32 million shares are not being reflected on number of shares in earnings, diluted number per share is 100,639,000 from 113,545,000, what happened to 32 million share repurchase of GSK?"
Just need to chill
Can't they buy back shares or something to fight off the shorts?
Innoviva reached a 52 Week high at 15.52
"Argus says it is 112% discount If $ettx hits on p3 it will rock, inva owns 67% of ettx and warrants"
Perfect time for corporate to start buying back stock!!
12 MILLION IN OPERATING EXPENSES>>>TO DO NOTHING!!!!!
I think we'll be at 20+ by the EOY.
"Denner increased share ownership by 23% reported 8/14, thats 874,295 more shares....interesting"
INVA reached a 52 Week low at 10.82

SARISSA>>> CLEAN HOUSE!!!!
PROFIT OF $2.34 management needs to doing a share buyback at these levels !!!
"Market nearing all time highs, INVA at new 52 week low. That about says it all. Buy management -- or in this case, sell management."

great news!!!
Innoviva is down 4.95% to 11.13
"Another stellar day without much volume. Currently at 15.70. I'm thinking we get close to 52 week high, then come off and then boost to the mid 18's where it should be."
INVA is up 5.50% to 16.30
"Step 1. Search for "" THESTOCKDORK "". Steup 2. Sign up. You wont regret it. This random message board user promises."
I would hate to be short on this - but a lot of folks are.
WOW! Here we go ATH tomorrow?! Great earnings and the jump today shows it
Could be paying down debt so they can buy something that'll pay royalties down the road. The patents/royalties won't last forever. Little to no R&D. What's left when they run out?
PE 11.86
This was up in pre-market last night $1.87 and it opens flat? #$%$
Nice spike in volume eod
Cut all staff positions that are no longer relevant and we will be on the right track!!

Dear Management:Longest Bull market in history !!! AND YOU HAVEN'T DONE JACK $#!*!!!!!!
Innoviva is up 5.36% to 9.83
Vol picking up 3x today
What will this company do after drugs go off patent to make good revenue streams? Anything solid or is it all just maybe they will make money on x or y?
DEAR MANAGEMENT DO SOMETHING !! ANYTHING !!!
low float makes this stock sensitive to short but intense trading. It will recover as fast as it dropped.
Someone should tell leadership that the quiet period is just a short period of time. They seem to think it is ongoing. #removemanagement
Stock is monopolized
well earnings seemed positive but with no volume the shorts will continue to push this down
"anyone can answer please ? how come 32 million shares are not being reflected on number of shares in earnings, diluted number per share is 100,639,000 from 113,545,000, what happened to 32 million share repurchase of GSK?"
What`s going on with this stock?
"great quarter, cash flow, diversifying, and one day will be rewarded"
"Only 5 employees, and a high short ratio? What could go wrong?"
JUST VOTED MY SHARES AGAINST COMPENSATION PACKAGE AND AGAINST ALL CURRENT MANAGEMENT!!!

"$tbph 35% drop yest was def overdone & is clear buying opportunity. So one drug failed, but its royalties from two COPD drugs alone value its stock at $11. Plus add ampreloxetine potential. Price target was cut by 21% which is accurate so the 35% drop puts it at 14% undervalued. After the 21% cut, price target now $29 which is still a 213% upside. https://www.investors.com/news/technology/biotech-stock-theravance-crashes-after-ulcerative-colitis-drug-flops/?src=A00220 $rvnc $inva $enta $xlrn"
Would have been sold for 8 BILLION years ago if not for horrible management !!!
"This company seems very solid on a fundamental basis. It's hard to understand why the analysts don't have more confidence in it. And their highlighted product, for COPD and asthma, seems apropos and could be huge."
I want my divi back
"wow, they should do something about this leadership, you can't just live off of 4 earnings reports a year, that's terrible."
CUT YOUR OVERHEAD NO NEED FOR EXPENSIVE OFFICE RENT!!
"$tbph great buy down 30%, 7/7 unanimous strong buys, avg price target $20.38 over 100% upside https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/tbph/analyst-research $rvnc $inva $enta $xlrn"

Profits are slowing. INVA missed estimates in 3 of the most recent 4 quarters. Beware.
Great acquisition target. PFE could probably effect a tenderoffer at $15 per share all stock transaction.
everyone's been sleeping while it's breaking out.

YES! Maximize shareholder value!! Here is a thought!!! Fire everyone but an accountant to register royalty check! Return ALL savings to shareholders!!!!!!
Can't wait to vote SARISSA board members in!!!
NO NEED FOR ANYONE IN MARKETING!!!
Where’s the divi
"I don't care what hedge funds think of this stock, I just wonder how management thinks when price can't even hold a breakout from a base!"
Lots of positives from technical analysis at stoxline. Long over 16.11 for a run up to 18.82
WHERE ARE THE COST CUTTING MEASURES??????
The market is pretty boring right now. Want stocks that are actually moving? Join THESTOCKDORK (search them)
shorts are about to get squeeeeeezed!!!
You guys should load up on $INVA tomorrow. They are one of ETTX largest stake holders. ETTX moved up 24% after hours INVA was flat. They have $25 million or $35 Million in ETTX and about that much for ARMP plus a $250 million investment Sarissa Capital believe the symbol may be SRSA. If ETTX continues advancing or gets approval may move into their royalty or acquisition portfolio which means big bucks for ETTX. Since I own INVA bought all three because I think all three will one day not too far off might be in one grouping. Good luck longs
INVA is up 4.92% to 16.00
Enjoy the ride
Will open a short position tomorrow. This should follow the same path as Assertio.
"Checkout NVAX guys , time to jump in seems to be going up (risks apply!)"
What’s up with them owning 69% of ettx They know something
NO NEED FOR LEGAL COUNSEL!!!
INVA is down 5.00% to $14.15

$TBPH just bought by billionaire guru https://www.conferencecalltranscripts.com/summary/?id=9864201 $rvnc $inva $enta $xlrn
Why does this stock have such a high short ratio? It looks solid at first glance!
NO NEED FOR TALENT ACQUISITION!!

"Generic Advair is actually GOOD for us, this is a great time for management to buy back shares !!!! Advair is old news and now GSK has a good reason to really push our new drugs !!!"
INVA reached a new 52 Week High at 16.28
COME ON INVA MANAGEMENT EARN YOUR KEEP!!!
Bring back divi and this rockets to 20
When do they give back the divi?
"Getty up, take some good vitamins and start running!"
"I don't understand why this stock is so expensive. I ran values and admittedly i am conservative, but I thought it would be worth around 4. I don't have a short position in this as I don't do shorts. Just looking for a value stock. This company has a couple of products but nothing fantastic or exciting."
About to hot 15 once again. Looking/waiting for signal from management about cuts to SG&A or even an expansion of the product beyond the US. New markets=higher sales
Interesting pop at the end of the day yesterday with a decent size volume trade coming in
INVA reached a new 52 Week High at 17.63

Many wishes for GSK to acquire it.
"""Some additional expenses were incurred in the second quarter in the evaluation of strategic options""Looks like they came up empty. .Don't mind us shareholders. I'm sure you'll find something that fills your pockets."
How many red days in a row is it now?
GOOD RESULTS NOW START A SHARE BUYBACK !!!
"The promise of change in the takeover of the company appears to be no more than air. I cannot see any change from what we had before the take over. No dividend, no sale of the company, no added value at all. So what did we gain?"
Buy it It’s going up
Something up?
When are the results coming out? I thought it was July 22.
STOCK BUY BACKS IN ORDER !!!!!!!!!!!!

Innoviva is down 5.00% to 12.53
I guess the earnings will be blowout with extra 32% we got from GSK. I wonder how long we will have to wait for some exciting news this is like watching paint dry
"Way to go management. Another new low. By the way. Can I get the details on how a company with 10 employees, that does nothing but collect royalties, spends $4.3 mil on General/Administrative Expenses??Company cars for everyone? Conferences in Switzerland? Sporting event tickets? All the above?"
"With all those youngsters continuously smoking weed, copd is going to become a major health problem in the future. Very bright future for INVA. Possible acquisition target also. GL to all longs."
INVA reached a 52 Week low at 12.86
$inva owns most of this company.. fact
"Up over 8% today after surprising earnings report. Beating on both REV and EPS. Is this stock not properly valued by the analysts? Seems like it. Thinking we should bust through the current 52 week high of 16.11. Seeing near 20/share possible if the trend of earnings and revenues continues at these higher levels. Also, a buyout by larger entity, GSK is also a possibility now."

One of the quietest stock you can find. They must just show up and take a long lunch.
After reading comments I've learned that INVA likes owning a good piece of other companies. One I didn't see mentioned is ARMP which they bought a lot of last month at $3.25. It is now over $6. I just bought INVA today and will get more if the price drops.
"look back 12 mths support, time to buy, 30 rsi. way oversold."
one more SELB stage 3 drug with huge insiders buying
"Why does INVA have a ""head of talent Acquisition and strategy"" ? No need to Acquire any new Talent!!! Just collect the check!!"
