"I don't care what hedge funds think of this stock, I just wonder how management thinks when price can't even hold a breakout from a base!"
I am confused. Its EPS is +1.17 and stock price is lower than some of negative EPS stocks.
Stock is monopolized

Many wishes for GSK to acquire it.

Why would we constantly grant insiders stock at $0 cost. We could put a blow-up doll in the CEO's chair and watch the stock hit new lows.

"$tbph 35% drop yest was def overdone & is clear buying opportunity. So one drug failed, but its royalties from two COPD drugs alone value its stock at $11. Plus add ampreloxetine potential. Price target was cut by 21% which is accurate so the 35% drop puts it at 14% undervalued. After the 21% cut, price target now $29 which is still a 213% upside. https://www.investors.com/news/technology/biotech-stock-theravance-crashes-after-ulcerative-colitis-drug-flops/?src=A00220 $rvnc $inva $enta $xlrn"

"Where is this one headed, any ideas?"
INVA is up 7.45% to 9.38
Wondering if this SPAC is going to be a holding company for Innoviva inc. INVA which has been hitting new highs recently. Saw in the fine print of one of INVA reports that they have funded Sarissa Capital approximately $320 million in cash to diversify their holdings. Not sure if this spac is tied to it or not. It would function as a vehicle for $INVA growth which has hit a new multi year high a few days in a row and is a cash cow bringing in about $80 million a quarter in cash after expenses. I could see INVA creating a holding company for their large position indirect holdings like ETTX and ARMP and maybe some others and combing them into one separate company and keep INVA as a pharmaceutical royalty company with their three or four licensed drugs that they have tie ins with the big pharma players. Then once potential products that get developed from the investments then INVA obtains licenses to add to their portfolio or gains a royalty. Interesting possible way to play it. bought into this thing at $11 a share early this year so sitting on a loss but if they do find a nice target it has the potential to get my money back and then some. Good luck to you all.

ETTX will be a big catalyst for INVA at some point this year.
She is due for a bounce today.
"I am really surprised with a stock like this, there?s literally no ongoing chat about this. I have had some real #$%$ stocks and there?s all kinds of conversations. I?m not complaining, just very surprised."
Someone should tell leadership that the quiet period is just a short period of time. They seem to think it is ongoing. #removemanagement

INVA just got FDA approved! Anyone know why the SP hasn't surged After Hours?
you guys are all wrong
low float makes this stock sensitive to short but intense trading. It will recover as fast as it dropped.
"Not mad keen on the capital allocation, especially the risky bets on antibiotic biotechs, but if they're not going to return cash to shareholders then putting it in a long term investment is probably next best.Sarissa Cap look to have a decent investing record based on the info I could find.

Someone should buy this company and get rid of all the staff. TBPH might be a good buyer.
Nice spike in volume eod
Jim2B4gain...thanks for responding and hope this stock moves up on those exceptional quarterly numbers
"This company seems very solid on a fundamental basis. It's hard to understand why the analysts don't have more confidence in it. And their highlighted product, for COPD and asthma, seems apropos and could be huge."
And now the new management ineptness becomes even more apparent! It appears the 'new' management is the same as the 'old' management. Sit around collecting an overly rewarding paycheck while doing nothing for the shareholders.
Money machine here
well earnings seemed positive but with no volume the shorts will continue to push this down
"I thought they brought new guy in to bring shareholders value up. I haven’t seen anything from this guy. Meet the new boss, same as the old boss!"
So cheap
"Your doing a great job Innoviva, new CEO that wants to advance shareholders value!"

Could be paying down debt so they can buy something that'll pay royalties down the road. The patents/royalties won't last forever. Little to no R&D. What's left when they run out?

Dear Management:Longest Bull market in history !!! AND YOU HAVEN'T DONE JACK $#!*!!!!!!
Great acquisition target. PFE could probably effect a tenderoffer at $15 per share all stock transaction.
"how come 32 million shares are not being reflected on number of shares in earnings, diluted number per share is 100,639,000 from 113,545,000, what happened to 32 million share repurchase of GSK?"
"Up over 8% today after surprising earnings report. Beating on both REV and EPS. Is this stock not properly valued by the analysts? Seems like it. Thinking we should bust through the current 52 week high of 16.11. Seeing near 20/share possible if the trend of earnings and revenues continues at these higher levels. Also, a buyout by larger entity, GSK is also a possibility now."

ALL this company does is collect a royalty check!!

Let Sarissa run INVA with (3) employee's!!! How many people do you need to collects a royalty check????
After reading comments I've learned that INVA likes owning a good piece of other companies. One I didn't see mentioned is ARMP which they bought a lot of last month at $3.25. It is now over $6. I just bought INVA today and will get more if the price drops.
Why does anyone work at this company other than an accountant to record an incoming royalty check??? Give me a break!!!
NO NEED FOR ANY SCIENTIST OR R AND D PEOPLE!!
