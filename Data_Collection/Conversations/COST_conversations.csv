Buying opportunity. This is a CORE stock in ANYONE'S portfolio. This stock will ALWAYS be expensive.It's the BEST OF BREED in the retail space.
"To those interested, remember, the stock remains in a strong up-trend meaning that the moves are 'higher highs' and 'lower lows'. The moves forward are stronger than the pull-backs. If Costco was not in this strong up-trend, she would be down $15 or $20 today."
"I have been purchasing this stock on a monthly basis for 20 years, during which time I have built a substantial nest to get my Roth Ira. For you young people, there are a few securities better than this one. Always buy the shares in your Roth, as the growth and dividends will grow tax-free. ￼￼￼￼￼ trust me, you will not regret it. Happy investing friends!￼￼"
That COST 447% gain included the all the dividend reinvestment program (DRIPs) along the way.
"Tradergirl, and all my long Costco friends. A new 52 week high by weeks end. I can taste it!!"
I wish I could get a job with them. Love and believe in this company.
"Market is acting crazy, probably month end re-balance."
Costco should be announcing the quarterly dividend by EOD today or Thursday. This will be the last .79 cent dividend. They will raise it next quarter.Go Costco
"""Fresh"" ALL TIME HIGH as I print."
Believe COST will announce special divi of around $8+ sometime in December and paid the same month.
500$ HERE WE COME
Giddy up! I'm a Costco employee in South Florida. Been there 2 years. Our deli has doubled sales in 3 years. Remodeling in spring to add production capacity for our department which includes rotisserie where I proudly serve. I'm part time. 25% of my paycheck (pre tax roth) about $750 a month goes to my 401k. Within that 50% goes to Costco stock. I'm also a small business owner. I'm definitely boots on the ground for Costco and will continue to dollar cost average into this stock no matter what the price. Been following this board for 2 years and just recently signed up for a yahoo account. @Tradergirl says everything that needs to be said here. Ride her coattails. She's a little tough on the outside but I think she really cares and her motives are pure. IMO BTW I read all of your posts last night. What an amazing person you are. One thing I know for sure is I'll never mess with you. Thanks GL to all.
"Monthly Sales report continue to be awesome, but no surprise."
Headed 500+
"Costco shareholders should not allow themselves to become overly excited w/ the stock's recent movement. This is the time of the year that, depending upon market conditions, some institutions establish their positions going into a new year. The stock will pull back from this week's gains.Costco rarely experiences gaps in their trading price and during this week there have been two (2) minor gaps. This is most likely due to one (1) institution's accumulation. Additionally, the stock ended the week w/ strong selling (as evidenced by the HOD at $485.03 and the closing price $3.00/shr. lower), pure profit-taking. As I have stated here previously, the current (very strong) up-trend in Costco's stock will continue to see higher highs and lower lows so, any pull-backs will be just enough to relieve selling pressure allowing the stock to continue its current trend up. (Buying and selling were about even today resulting in a strong topping tail.)(All that means is the stock will pull-back 'some' and then continue higher.)"
How about a 5 for 1 split ....
I predicting they will announce the 4 to 1 split on the 29th ex divedend day
"Stopped by our local Costco today at 11am to pick up a prescription. Parking lot was full, gas lines 5-6 deep at all pumps, inside was jammed with shoppers pushing their over filled carts to the registers. Anyone betting against this juggernaut will be sorry."
Cost stock gives more than 10% annual returns by historical standards. Just look at a long term chart. That being said.... they won't split and the goal is to reach $1000 less than 10 years time. I'm sticking with that call.
"I don't have enough of this to worry about up considerably over the past couple years but only 200 shares so no big deal however, what news did I miss here the past week or so making this thing drop like this?"
Just spent $625 bills at my favorite place !!!!
There is no right time to get into this stock. Juggernaut stocks like this can be bought anytime and held for sweet gains.
Next week will hear October numbers = Next leg up! IMO
I think the drop today was mgmt sold a bunch of shares
"COST a buy anywhere under $500? Been looking to start a position, but it's near an ATH.....but it always seems to be near an ATH."
Special Dividend this year?
I love you cost
They're taking this down purposely for the simple reason of buying cheaper shares just before the America thanksgiving and Christmas share run up. Watch. But now that I've said that.... it will run up sooner lol.
"Costco continues to be one of the dominant warehouse retailers based on the expanse and quality of merchandise offered. It is focused on ramping up investments in the wake of rising competition from the likes of Dollar Tree DLTR, Dollar General DG and Target TGT. We believe that the company’s business model as well as commitment toward opening membership warehouses, and providing convenient and affordable ways to shop will continue to drive traffic, and in turn revenues."
"In 2006 my wife told me to buy Costco stock because she really liked the company. Since then I have a 447.23% gain on one eTrade account on COST. I thought Costco was sort of boring at that time compared to AOL, but I’m glad I listened to her."
Going toBREAK OUT soon.
"There is no need for Costco to execute a forward split, period."
New all-time high @ 471+!!
Costco Wholesale reached an all time high at 482.50
"A poster over at ST had a great idea , Costco gift cards for all the holidays to family and friends , you DONT HAVE TO BE A MEMEBR To shop there with a gift card  and then maybe they will becomes members only enriching all the shareholders"
beautiful chart today
"lets just say a 4:1 split was initiated..the benefit would be everyone would get 4 times their shares...we could have more retail buyers..not just institutions..the downfall...day traders might appear, and hedge funds"
Looks like $500 sooner than later
Wish the big companies and hedge funds would be in for long run like us smaller investors. Just when we get ahead they take profits...to do what they do I would have to be a day trader instead of a small investor who holds his stock.
"Is this worth buying now or should I wait to get in with all the supply chain issues, labor costs etc.Also, any thoughts on long term prospects vs target, Amazon etc? Is this a long term buy, given Amazon coming in?"
"Considering shorting Costco with 1,000 shares for a quick $10,000 profit. Will let it go higher to be on the safe side."
I wonder if we see a split at $500?
I have been accumulating Costco stock every 2 week for a bit over 13 years never care about the red a Green Day so this strategy has been working great for me.
"Have watched this winner for several years. Only goes up. So, capitulated and bought the thing a few months ago. What a stock. Should be a core holding for anyone's portfolio. Only retailer in which I will participate. Fantastic blue print and strategy. Stock will eventually split and pay special divi's."
"I have $60K for long term,Can anyone from $t, $vz, $ko, $mcd, $tgt, $cost tell me why I should buy any among these and not on $tsla, $coin, $msft, $fb...etc and $aapl. pls no $pltr I do not need scam company that only benefits the CEO and his boys with unlimited insider's dilutions."
"• Costco is renting its own container ships to import products from Asia to the US and Canada. • It wants to sidestep the global shipping crisis and shield itself from shortages and rising costs. • It's also renting ""several thousand"" containers, Costco CFO Richard Galanti said. • See more stories on Insider's business page.Costco has joined Home Depot in renting its own container ships to prevent delays and keep costs down as the global shipping crisis rages on.This would help Costco avoid spending six times the normal price on shipping or containers through a third party, he said. "
"Big week here? In the context of Costco, Home Depot accepts payments by Bitcoin. Starbucks and Microsoft are two other big names that have also moved in the same direction. Given that so many companies have moved in this direction, it might not be surprising if Costco begins to consider such a move soon."
Would love to have a 10% day
