"Hello fellow millennials,Let us go to our local wholesale club and purchase memberships with our $700 paychecks. We can afford one membership fee and one $200 steak! Forget paying rent. We eating $200 individual frozen steak tonight. Apples at 4$/lb via supermarket 2$/lb - I told my Costco loving European maid and she said it’s because Costco has the highest quality . First I was supposed to believe it was the cheapest. Now I’m supposed to understand it’s twice as expensive because it’s the highest quality . Do they also give out free Dunce caps at cost? https://apple.news/AZJbRBydJQn2yZCoIoSxtuA"
"we said Costco would go up $4 plus on Friday but we meant today. lol,, "
We continue to see higher highs and lower lows as this early March trend moves forward.
A 2lb box of Reese’s puffs is $1.75 at my supermarket.It is $6.49 at Costco + membership fee.
why isn this up and down so fast? yesterday it held the downside all day
"this needs to split, so more retail ppl can buy in..instead of institutions..right now institutions are crashing this"
Sold 505 shares @ 451. Got in @ 391. Best to the longs!!
Showed some strength throughout some of the day. I think Friday will rebound.
Is there any reason why Costco stock price is falling since mon 8/23 rather all other stock prices going up?
dips are opportunity to buy. Costco will make new highs soon
"In order to become a blue chip stock, COST may chose to do the following:1. Split2. Stock buy back to lower the float after the split3. Steady increase dividends every year4. Rinse and repeat in 10-15 yearsSimple"
No brainer here picked up another 100 shares
"CRAMER on COSTOwn it ,,,,,dont trade it !"
"Well run company, happy employees, happy shareholders.. what more can you ask for?"
Wholesale clubs are a thing of the future
Sold half my shares at 465. Looking to buy back under 425. Come to papa!
Who's a buyer here?
Up Up Up ...............................
"This , too, shall pass."
why can't this hold gains?..this was up almost 10$
"And, the window to split is closing fast. 8:1 is already obsolete. Chance to split 10:1 is closing at $500. If the SP goes over $500 without splitting, the uptrend will disappear and a huge sale of the share will start . The stock has no dividends worth holding it if the uptrend momentum is lost."
$COST Target Raised by Credit Suisse Neutral USD 400 » USD 490
The number of people in one household is falling steadily to 1.This is great for wholesale clubs. Less families living together means less sales = higher price to earnings!
"I may be wrong, but this is the first time that I can remember that they announced the earnings on the first. I really believe now an announcement of a stock split will be comming end of day tomorrow Thursday. well let's waite and see."
UGE volume at the end
It has to fill up gap to $450 today or tomorrow .
Went to my local Costco the other day (Ontario Canada) and was surprised to see the introduction of 4 self check outs. I won't use as I want employees to have a job and I find the check out people friendly and helpful. From a shareholder standpoint it could be good from potential reduced cost and possible increase sales as check outs may move faster.
Invest 10k in this stock at this price???
$COST Target Raised by Cowen Outperform USD 440 » USD 520 Target Raised by Deutsche Bank Hold USD 424 » USD 468
Have good investment in this...good one for retirement
gawd..whats happening with this?..normally the best stock in and out of a bad market
This goes up after earnings. Hahahahahahaha!
"When I bought this at $360 last year, I thought I bought at the top. Look at it now, up $90 from my purchase price... It proves that you can't go wrong buying high quality stocks. High quality stocks are not cheap precisely because they are high quality stocks, so just buy and hold."
3.76 share a BEAT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Rev a BEAT also..........................
Cost compared to BJ or Sams is like Mcdonald's compared to Burger King.
Ummm… where’s the fireworks? Did I miss them? It’s cloudy here but…
Does anyone know what is the difference between COWC34.SA (trading around $60 per share) and COST (trading in $460's)? Is COWC34.SA available to investors?
might take some profits when this hits $500

Second China store set to open December 8th. I’m not selling anything.
The fear of Covid will be imprinted in people’s minds for years just like the depression did. I grew up with my parents hoarding food for years. Costco should do well for several years and should be at least 10% of everyone’s portfolio.
September profit-taking ends tomorrow...
800Lbs GORRILLA ...............................500.00++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ coming
on the way to $500... bring it on
We’ll see $400 again...the dupe in the WH will see to that.
52 week high in after hours. Amazing company!!
"Costco beat the heck outta earnings, more all time highs to come..."
"Tigress Initiates Costco Wholesale with $520 price target, reiterates Buy Rating.It just keeps on going up, in coming months, talk of $600 will be going on a lot!"
Tank in Am
great earnings...GONE
"When does this reach $1,000?"
Stock split coming !!!
Would like to see at least a 5% pull back to buy more
All the uncertainty in the world is good for Costco. When people are worried Costco benefits.

not enough ppl sold and bought AMC....but I like cost..but watch AMC
OVERDONE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!wreckless selling here.
The future of this company is bright for three reasons.1. 50% of Millennials order grocery delivery be. Just 18% of baby boomers. Grocery delivery from Costco does not require a membership if you order on Instacart. Membership sales will drop rapidly in coming years .2. Inflation will further weaken the nations largest demographic’s buying power (millennials)3. Millennials own fewer cars and have less free time to browse Costco’s aisles.
500.00+++ coming soon !
"Today's move has produced a very healthy 'gap-up'... something that Costco hasn't seen in a very, very long time. As I stated sometime earlier, this particular leg-up during the current positive trend is a very strong one, indeed. However, be watchful that the 'gap' does not cause a large pull-back to fill-in. The strength of the current trend up (beginning 05 March '21) will show its cards around this gap. If all goes well, it will fill immediately and get it out-of-the-way.Right now we do 'not' want the stock to suddenly fly through the roof. The gap needs to be dealt with and the sooner the better. From what I can see in the charts, I would not be at all be surprised to see $600 during January, 2022. You heard that right... $600."
Time to bail out before tomorrows legendary FALL????
"Sure was crowded in Tustin yesterday.Need more checkouts, long lines."
When does the monthly sales fifures come out?
$500 by Christmas. stock market never goes down. just stay with the stocks milennials love.
"Smoke and mirrors, myth, covid, crash."
I sold Costco years ago at 250. Who woulda thunk it?
I will reiterate what I stated just a short time ago...I will not be surprised to see COST at $600 during January.
"Everyone should be aware that next week is the last week of the month so there will definitely be a sell-off w/ fund Managers and MMs taking profits and then re-establishing their positions beginning on Friday (10/01) and into the following the week.That $15 jump will evaporate as quickly as it arrived. Then, slowly continue the move up."
Profits are actually lower than Target but with nearly twice the valuation. Target has nearly 3x more stores as well.
In spite of today's performance....Cost is still up over $100 a share from it's March lows. Still up a lot and will continue it's upswing.
Costco is a rocket ship. Get onboard for the ride.
"No doubt about it, the pandemic has been very good for Costco members, investors, employees and the corporate bottom line. What's more important is this will continue for quite a while. Many rank 'n file (hourly) employees racked-in 6-figure incomes during 2020 for their hard and dedicated work and they earned every penny of it, too.And throughout all of this incredible hardship the quality of products and service offered by Costco never failed in support of their local communities. This is precisely why intelligent people invest in her for the very long haul. (P.S. They just need LARGER parking lots!!!)"
"A little correction before earnings , was expected"
I'm curious to hear people's thoughts on how much the supply chain crisis will affect cosco's performance
You know what’s amazing for Costco’s business? The fact you can shop there on Instacart without a membership.
HOLIDAY runup just started to 500+
"Macy’s and BBBY just reported blow out earnings. Cheaper retail is doing well amidst the pandemic. Costco will do well. No one going out to eat. Costco is the way to feed your family. Small dips. Buy, buy, buy!!!"
Believe COST will announce special divi of around $8+ sometime in December and paid the same month.
Look for increase membership fees soon.A PLUS for COST !
another 100 shares at $450
"My portfolio $INDI, $Z, $MSFT, $COST, $JPM, $EQIX, $SWKS, $AMZN. INDI is by far the most explosive one I own, with largest upside."
There's a run on toilet paper again. $COST has shortages and sold out in many places. You wonder what this does for the tissue business of RFP. Also does anyone know what brands RFP produces? I believe they produce some for $DG
probably time to dump this manure....dont understand this..excellent earnings..yet the stock tanks..
My only good stock.
"Imagine what happens when cost doesn't announce growth, gonna be a quick trip down $100 or so.Will add then."
Costco seems to go down after earnings no matter how good. . No worries.
Fund Managers did an excellent job of clearing-out September profits yesterday and today.
In Southern Calif we have many cargo ships waiting off shore for weeks to unload because of the shortage of hired help.So what did Costco do? I read this morning they sent 3 ships out to their ships to unload and bring to the docks. Priceless.
"Recent report shows Tesla sales in China dropped about 70% month to month. This appears that the Chinese Government/public is retaliating to US on its hostile stance towards China. It is likely that this situation will continue and the relationship between US and China is going to get worse. Besides affecting Consumers, this is going to affect a lot of investments. People holding Chinese Companies shares are already taking a beating. Companies that has exposure to China are also going to get affected. As of writing, Costco has a total of 813 stores in the world with one store in China. That is only 0.12% of the total stores. This is a very small exposure even if China would throw Costco out of China. I am not sure if China would even bother. Compare to Walmart, Walmart has 10,500 stores in the world and 438 Walmart stores in China. There is a 4.17% of stores in China. In the coming months, if there is any bad news on Costco concerning China, remember that Costco’s exposure to China is very small. If the share price drops big reacting to this, it might be a good time to pick some shares up. Good Luck to all the Longs."
"Costco is definitely a powerhouse, but from an investing perspective BJ’s is a much better buy. They aren’t as large, but they’re capturing market share, have tremendous room for growth (being that they are expanding out west from the east coast), they’re very cheap in comparison to Costco, and they’re very profitable."
I have invested or gambled as some would argue in the pharmaceutical world over the last year and a half. I can't stomach it anymore since they are so unforgiving at times. I remember thinking about buying COST at $100 several years ago. Well. I need not say anymore. ug. But I just got a position in hopes of either a split or crossing over the $500 mark soon. Good luck to everyone.
Thus far I see nothing that disappoints in the report!
"Costco continues to be one of the dominant warehouse retailers based on the expanse and quality of merchandise offered. It is focused on ramping up investments in the wake of rising competition from the likes of Dollar Tree DLTR, Dollar General DG and Target TGT. We believe that the company’s business model as well as commitment toward opening membership warehouses, and providing convenient and affordable ways to shop will continue to drive traffic, and in turn revenues."
Its a BEAT3.76
More DELTA is GOOD NEWS for COST !
COST has a P/E ratio of 43. A 20%-25% hair cut is near. Do the math!
This is also a 3x leverage play on millennials having significantly more buying power than their parents. It’s also known that they cannot grow because their locations don’t make sense unless they’re very spread out.
where is Eric the short dang 2 times this month went Shor on cost 
"Still way overbought at this price..actually needs a good haircut before considering position...with.Covid cases coming down now, this stock will take a hit for sure..other stocks will be better in long run"
Holding strong on my short position. Will tank tomorrow!

How about a 5 for 1 stock split ?? Bring in New INVESTORS !!!

"MarketWatch reported Friday that the cost of shipping items in those containers on the ships rose during the pandemic from $2,000 to $3,000 per container shipped to $20,000 per container now. (( ridiculous ))"
"Monthly Sales report continue to be awesome, but no surprise."
"The best advise I can give you guys. When this drops, buy more. That's it. That's all. People were calling $250 in February when it corrected above $300. Look now. What more do you want. Best retail store period."
No need to buy at these high prices. Looking to accumulate under 425. Sold have my shares at 465. Remember buy low and sell high.Good luck!
Headed to $500
475.00 soon targets are over 550.00
Should we sell and take in profits or wait?
wait for 463.00 buy
"Far too many here judge this stock's future based upon what it gains or loses in any given day, even labeling a 1% move as a 'correction'... unbelievable.But still very, very funny to read!"
Purchase of Costco shares should be limited like paper towels. Appears to be a shortage.
"loved the close today. we eat well sleep well these days , thankful to all Costco participants for sharing your success., "
Costcos in Hawaii out of everything! It’s a travesty!! Steaks that you can buy are over $20 a pound! Fish even more! No produce!! It’s gonna happen everywhere!! Sell!!! SELLLL!!!!’
The next leg up should be another strong move.

No Toilet Paper at Teterboro NJ Costco - low inventory on all items
Was in Costco this evening. Store is already stocking full throttle for Christmas  Let the buying begin!
"I just googled for Costco hourly wages. The highest hourly salary reported is $35,392 per year. There are 52 weeks in a year, minus 2 weeks of holidays and 3 weeks of personal vacation (personal vacation is usually 2 – 4 weeks depending on time with company). The would be 47 weeks of work time. With these numbers we get an hourly rate for $18.83. Most company pays 1.5 times on Saturdays and 2 times on Sundays. Assuming this highest paid hourly worker works every week day with 2 hours overtime, he gets $1035.65 per week. If he works 8 hours every Saturday at time and a half, he gets an extra $225.96. If he works 8 hours every Sunday at double pay, he gets another $301.28. So, if this worker works 10 hours every weekday, works every Saturday and Sunday for 8 hours each he would get an annual salary of $82,249.44. Let’s assumed that he works on every holiday which probably pays triple. 10 holidays worked would yield him another $4519.2. Adding that together, would get him $86,768.64. Let’s say that this highest paid hourly employee works on his paid vacation. Working on vacations are usually triple pay. He works all his 15 days’ vacation. That would get him $6,778.8. So, if he works every day, he would get $93,547.44. If the number I obtained are real and my calculation is correct or close, an hourly employee getting over 6 figures would not be common. Do your own due diligence, just because it is written, it might not be factual. Check the numbers and calculations on this post also."

Erik is a lesson in what NOT to do in the markets. Learn from his huge mistakes.
"why would anybody choose this packed tight store over Sams? I've had both memberships, they are both good. I do think Costco is marginally better, but when you weigh in having to park a mile away, and the incredibly long slow lines, Sams is a no brainer."

"• Costco is renting its own container ships to import products from Asia to the US and Canada. • It wants to sidestep the global shipping crisis and shield itself from shortages and rising costs. • It's also renting ""several thousand"" containers, Costco CFO Richard Galanti said. • See more stories on Insider's business page.Costco has joined Home Depot in renting its own container ships to prevent delays and keep costs down as the global shipping crisis rages on.This would help Costco avoid spending six times the normal price on shipping or containers through a third party, he said. "
Yesss!
I don’t think 45x earnings is enough for this company. I would be more than happy to pay 90x earnings which would be 4x the next highest multiple in retail ($tgt)
time to drive this one down
"According to Charlie Munger, Costco is the best run company in America. And he said that includes BRKA!"

"What's the ceiling here? Have you noticed the Costco prices lately, $30 for 3 salmon stuffed fillets, used to be $20. not as many good values. Every consumer has a line in the sand.We haven't had a normal 5% correction in some time."
Wish the big companies and hedge funds would be in for long run like us smaller investors. Just when we get ahead they take profits...to do what they do I would have to be a day trader instead of a small investor who holds his stock.
Costco hit all time high this morning $470.30.... nice 
They're taking this down purposely for the simple reason of buying cheaper shares just before the America thanksgiving and Christmas share run up. Watch. But now that I've said that.... it will run up sooner lol.
Costco is a winner Staying Long
August sales look great. COST should trend up
Still overbought at this price
$500 before christmas?
Spare yourself a lifetime of working- inherit the belief system that Costco $COST stock is worth infinity and sell the pits or buy the calls or both every day and watch yourself turn $100 into a million by years end.
we analyst here state that Costco will continue to go north. a lot of growth with no logical reason to stop. however if the entire market should sink or an unseen major economic obstacle maybe then Costco would be affected. Great stock
I'll buy Costco when it goes back down. to 400
not a good stock right now
"I wonder how COST would be doing if their shoppers knew that they contribute in the range of 90-98% of their contributions to Democrats and not more than 3-4% to Republicans. Dangerous numbers considering about 1/2 of their shoppers are conservatives. They should come clean and explain publically why they detest half of their customer base. It's public knowledge on opensecrets so they should proudly proclaim these numbers at the entrance to their stores.Hang huge banners that say ""We donate 95% of our campaign contributions to democrats. What are they scared of? Oh yeah, losing half their customers. Amazing they can get away with things like this and still have ignorant sheep lined up down the street to get their $5 chickens."
Another great day owning Costco shares. ....
Look for membership fee increases soon !Buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuy here.
stock market green and booming...costco on the sideline taking the day off
"Can’t wait to close all 1200 calls. Until then, good night!!"
COST s/b $500 already.
On the move to break52wk High............................500+ soon
another 25 shares to my long portfolio @$449 love red days
It's bullet proof impossible to keep Costco stock down for very long. I've been saying that for a long time now. One just has to look at a long term stock chart. Nuff said. As far as I'm concerned.... Costco stock should be in the Dow. Buy Cost stock and you're set for life.
Another chance to buy the dip. down for no reason
