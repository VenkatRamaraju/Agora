"Do any of you actually own any TGS stock? If you do you would know it has been Bullish since I bought into it @ $1.90 and it has surpassed its yearly expectations and will only go higher! Pay no attention to the ""man behind the curtain"" who would persuade you to bail and run to another IPO. There is plenty of info out there but you will need to put some time into it! You get nothing for nothing in this world or this market for that matter!"

"So the ADR ration is 5:1 based on the shares outstanding for tgsu2 and tgs adr, which means the ADR share sould be 5x the value after currency conversion. 140 Argentina Peso would be about 1.50 USD. Then multiply be 5 which would give you 7.50 USD. I understand instability and politics are at play but that is a big difference in price. Any ideas or comments?"
