"FNMA-backed chattel mortgages are expected to reduce the cost of ownership of mobile homes and improve the availability of affordable housing. MH & RV park owners have struggled to fill vacant spaces in recent years, because potential residents had no reliable and affordable source of mobile home financing. Park owners -- many of whom lacked the capital to buy new mobile homes and offer carryback financing to their tenants -- have been left with vacant sites they cannot afford to fill. Prior to Greentree Financial's bankruptcy in the 1990s, mobile home buyers were able to access financing competitive with financing available to stick-built homes."
