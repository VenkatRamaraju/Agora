"Hi Dennie, my email is burbankpotato@yahoo drop me an email. FIBK is doing great!! Hope it keeps up, Just remembered we have a nice divy coming in a few days!"
"Seeing FIBK just closed on two bank mergers yesterday , Will the dividend stay the same or decrease due to more shares outstanding . I’ve emailed several Tim’s to ask question, but they won’t respond at all. Well to this new bank that has zero communication with their stockholders!!!"
"Hi Dennie, I have some things to report...I called AST&T, they are the banks transfer agents, I was disappointed in the fact the lady I talked to didn't really seem to understand mergers and acquisitions anyway she said she would research it and call me back. Well, she didn't. I then called Schwab ( my broker) and they said the delay in swapping our stock was the fault of the DTCC (Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation) they will diviy if you will the stock to brokerage houses and then to us. Schwab told me they have no more info as to when the swap will take place?? I guess I have to sit on my hands and wait because all my shares are held by Schwab. That's all I know Dennie, oh well our new bank seems to be doing well! Cheers talk to you later."

The FIBK investors relations is. Joke. Still will not send DRIP forms. I believe they do not want new shareholders! Will take dividends each quarter instead of reinvesting.

"Hi Dennie, Just waiting for our IIBK stock to get converted to FIBK stock. Our IIBK stock has been restricted all last week, meaning we cant sell if we had to. I don't understand why the delay. I don't want to miss the next dividend that FIBk is going to pay. Maybe this week everything will happen. Talk to you later. PS nice move in the stock price on Friday!!"

"Fred, seeing we will be the onlyShareholders on this site, just want to welcome you to our new bank that pays a quarterly divy. Get that lawn cut, you’ll be the envy of the street and owning this bank too."
I see interest rates shooting above 4% - when are you going to pay your depositors the same 4% for keeping money there?

Looking to see increase in dividend to be announced the end of this month!! Also hoping they develop (start ) a DRIP for the stock holders so we can begin buying monthly. This bank has gone a long way on the past few years! Go FIBK!!!
All time close!!!! Happy stockholder
"Yeah Dennie, its going awhile to get our shares of FIBK, lets see what happens,,..I just hope we get the shares before FIBK goes ex dividend. I got this funny feeling they will drag their feet and we will be without our first dividend... lets say they issue 4-5 million new shares to pay dividends on then if the bank delays they will save up to 1.5 million bucks!! lets see what happens. all the best!!"
