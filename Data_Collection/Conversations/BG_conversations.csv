"Zacks has a buy rating on BG. They noted the RSI reached oversold territory, increased earnings expected and a price turnaround may be in the offing. Strengthening dollar, China messing with commodities and the Fed suggesting rising rates in 2022 may all have contributed to BG's latest price downturn. I'm just throwing all this out there to see if anyone on this board has a reaction to my speculations. Thanks in advance for any replies.Darwin"
"WSJ 9-27-2021A revival in the U.S. Farm Belt is in full swing, boosting markets for land and equipment and raising concerns over farmers’ escalating costs.A months-long rally in prices for major agricultural commodities such as corn and soybeans is pushing up incomes for U.S. farmers and unleashing spending and investment that had been subdued for years, according to agricultural economists and executives. The run-up in land and equipment prices that has followed could leave farmers exposed if big harvests send crop prices lower again, some economists said.U.S. cropland values hit a record this year, federal data shows. Prices for new and used farm equipment have soared, as rising sales and disruptions in key components, such as semiconductor chips, cause shortages and delivery delays for new machinery.As grain prices climbed earlier this year, Illinois farmer Joe Hampton sprang for his first new tractor in years: a 570-horsepower Deere & Co. model with rubber tracks instead of wheels. The list price for such a top-of-the-line tractor is more than $500,000, but Mr. Hampton offset the cost by trading in an older machine. He also had a planter rebuilt and traded in a grain cart for a better used model.“My analysis was that this probably was a good time to buy,” said Mr. Hampton. “A lot of my equipment was getting older. We were cash-starved for the last two or three years.”Retail sales volumes of new high-horsepower tractors in the U.S. were up 27% from year-ago levels during the first eight months of 2021, according to the Association of Equipment Manufacturers. The red-hot machinery market has produced a windfall for manufacturers like Deere, whose profit from large farm equipment surged 50% in the company’s latest quarter.“It’s like the Wild West out there right now,” said Scott Irwin, an agricultural economist at the University of Illinois, referring to the scramble for land and equipment.Until recently, U.S. farmers were in the grips of an agricultural recession brought on by a world-wide crop glut. Starting last year, however, strong demand from China and poor weather in key growing regions fueled a sharp rise in prices for crops like corn and soybeans, which touched their highest levels in eight years during the spring. U.S. agricultural exports are expected to hit records in fiscal 2021 and 2022, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture forecasts.That helped spur a sharp reversal in farmers’ fortunes, with the USDA projecting this month that net farm income would surge 20% in 2021 to $113 billion, the highest since 2013.Place yer bets. - D"

"Way to go, BG!"
Do shareholders need to fear Bolsonaro?
"It's not just BG... all of the basic materials stocks are getting pulverized. Feels like they are getting knee-capped by a Fed that's intent on selling a story. BTW - Corn, wheat, and soybeans are still up big time yoy. Welcome to the US stock market, 2021."
i sell it goes higher. i buy it drops
"OK, this is the best earnings report I have ever read of any company in my long life! It can't get any better than BG!! Why isn't this stock soaring over 80 already today and heading for 100 by end of year? I know it has had a good run already but these numbers are almost shocking! I am holding until the cows come home or $100 whichever comes first!"
I wonder if BG still owns any BYND?
"This stock has been a disaster since the new CEO took over. All of the money this company used to make was from positioning and risk management. They were able to do that when when commodity prices were much higher and large trading houses had information advantage vs. smaller players. Information today is much more readily available and the field is flooded with so many players and every day new players are popping up. So they don’t really have any competitive advantage but they still have assets which are not giving them any returns. Farmers used to rely on these guys for storage, today they have storage themselves. Given all these things they can’t make same money on trading which is how they did it before. CEO is ex trader, he does not know how to operate the company. They just appointed new agri head who also is a trader, never ran operations. The only way out is a buyout and with that new management."

"@Ted @Sandy Greetings Ted. You don't know me but Sandy and I are well acquainted so that makes us like minded as well. I am in the same stocks as Sandy other than Gold and FMC. Clearly, BG is my favorite too. I am long term on all of my Ag stocks as well. I also own INGR and CTVA that Sandy does not own. My concern right now is the larger overall inflation narrative. It simply does not seem to be holding up like we all have expected. I am really concerned about what I see happening recently with other than Ag prices. You may not follow Iron Ore but it has imploded over just the last few weeks. We all know oil is collapsing and so are things like lumber that I only track. I am heavily invested in energy and Ag. I dabble in Iron and Aluminum. Honestly, it does feel like there is no place to hide. I have a 29 year old young friend who knows nothing about investing. He laughs at me with my commodity investments because he is all about Bitcoin and ETH. Every day I scratch my head and wonder who will get the last laugh. Trust me, I would not buy crypto at 1 cent on the dollar, just to point our my frustration."

"BG eps not a loss - most likely why its stock price went higher for covered short positions. Next few days if all the gains don't disappear and return to under 50, the worse is over.Management changes to prevent bear hug from another bigger company at 70-78 target.In a year from now BG better position could take it over 80 (big challenge);Or stay at current price in 50s with more setbacks.Hold for the dividend (lol)."
"I wish this stock would step up to trade at least on par with ADM. I only got into this last month because I was close to buying ADM and this seemed like the better value on a relative basis. This company is tremendously under capitalized compared to almost any other company in any industry. I am in slightly over $46 average, and now it is not keeping up with ADM. Not to worry, just disappointed."
Nice Bloomberg writeup! These groups that came on board will make it happen soon like they did with Smithfield foods. 3 day blackout on buying more because they are on the board now ends Monday. Watch for them to come into the market and start acquiring more shares with drop post earnings report.
yeah I'd like to buy some shares on Bung Unlimited he he he

"With Chevron in the headlines, it's time to repost:""Increased demand for vegetable oils from U.S. food-service companies and the renewable diesel sector are now lifting Bunge's expectations for earnings, Chief Executive Greg Heckman said. Renewable fuel demand, in particular, has triggered a ""structural improvement"" in oilseed markets, he told analysts on a conference call.Unlike other green fuels such as biodiesel, renewable diesel can power auto engines without being blended with diesel derived from crude oil, making it a low-pollution option. Refiners can produce renewable diesel from animal fats, plant oils and used cooking oil.""There's going to be more capacity needed to meet this demand growth,"" Heckman said.Heckman in May said Bunge was working to squeeze more production out of its existing oilseed crush and refining operations to capitalize on soaring vegetable oils demand."""

BTW the post below is me (Darwin) writing. Maria is my wife and this is her Yahoo account but she doesn't do any trading; she just supervises me and puts on the brakes as necessary. This arrangement usually works just fine.
There is a bidding war
"Wow, the shorters are really having a heyday today. I bought into the dip today when it had dropped 6% thinking that I had gotten in at a good price. Earnings were better than expected and new members of the board to start cleaning house. The company is profitable and has a long history. Why on earth has it now dropped almost 10%? People are shorting a well-established company such as this and simultaneously buying back into the FAANG stocks today, with their astronomical valuations and ZERO dividend. The stock market just makes me shake my head sometimes. You can't make any logical sense out of it."
Big hedge funds scooping up stock
"Hello Foster,If you’re retired you should have plenty of good dividend paying stocks. Holding some AG stocks is OK but not enough.If you live in a state with high property taxes, sell the house and move to a low tax state or rent where you are,There is no capital gains on the sale of property.You probably know that Sandy is a male.You moved away from FL and living in another state, where ?"

"i di believe we are at or near the bottom in terms of the recession and in six months time the economy will be looking towards a recovery. a lot is priced in, so gotta be careful as a lot of stock have been inflated. not BG so much, but others. It may be a good time to gradually dip toes in with really beaten up names. I bought some BP & TOT, as well as FCX. Dipped my toes in. glta"
So does this mean M&A off the table?
"Very nice to be blind-sided by unexpected good news instead of bad news. Kind of funny for me because all of my Ag investments came from dumping half of my energy portfolio over the last year. Now I actually see an intersection between energy and Ag. We are also getting it with ADM for those of us who own both. I suspect most BG investors possibly own ADM too. Even my Natural Gas companies as well as Aluminum mining S32.AX, are having great weeks. @Sandy @Ted I am glad my Leaps sold on BG have a strike of $120."
"You can see their bid on 10,000 sharesBuy it up and force them to put for sale sign up!"
"expecting a thorough analysis by new board members (sellout completely, more divestitures, etc.) will take time; my guess is about 6 months before press release.It's been early 2018 that rumored ADM or Glencore to scoop didn't materialize (they still interested in low ball offer or walked away?);In the meantime situation got worse with eps lower, tariff wars with China, BG management made wrong bets/move.Pray wait is worth the sale price of at least range 80-90 if not more."

Anyone have any information on Burcon Nutrascience ( BUROF)? I have bought a little. Canadian company that has a ton of patents that Bunge invested 30 million Canadian. They have deal with Nestle. It seems like a great speculation. Very lightly traded. Also has the backing of the Canadian Govt. Should be starting production in their new facility in Manitoba very soon. That is all of the info I have. Any additional insight would be greatly appreciated.
"Bought 200 more shares this AM and BG is down more from where I bought @$77. My wife said that's it, she likes BG but no more buying now. Relative strength for BG hit 20 this morning and that's why I bought. I don't regret buying BG, I just hate buying at high prices."
"According to earnings call, they had projected earnings to somewhere less than $3.70 for year after Q1 results. After Q2 results, they guided Q3 and Q4 combined earnings upwards by 100 million dollars ($0.55 per share) after the Q2 earnings beat. My estimate for their projected full year earnings guidance is around $4 for 2020 year. 1st half of year, BG generated 715 million free cash flow, using 100 million to buy back stock, 413 million to pay back debt, and 142 million to dividends. If margins are stable, BG is a free cash cow. This stock should be trading nowhere in the 40s with a PE ratio of 15 (15 x 4 = 60), 40% upside from here. I am definitely adding more if I get a chance."
How is everyone feeling about BG? Earnings look great
"If BG can trade and stay over 70...some sort of deal making going on in the background IMO. Push to sell the company more likely.Unless, some kind of huge eps when announcement come Oct 30-Nov 5 time frame.Fair offer take out is low-ball 80-90 price range."
"So BG blew out earnings estimate, guiding ~$6.50 for 2020. At a PE of 15, this means its a $97.5 stock, implying a further 55% upside? This should also mean very good news for ADM when it reports."
"Sugar, baby!"

"I bought more prior to earnings. BG is undervalued at under $50, fairly valued around $60 in my opinion. My bullish thesis is: 1) weak US dollar helps BG as they have a significant revenue abroad 2) free cash flow is good for market cap 3) new management with goal of earnings of $5 or more and to deleverage and simplify business 4) decent dividend yield 5) potential take-over target. I believe all of the agri-stocks have strong and improving fundamentals, BG is one amongst them."

"US farming associations have hit out at President Donald Trump's tariffs saying that ""Trade policy is not a game"" and that ""farmers and ranchers could be dealing with the fallout for decades to come."" Roger Johnson, president of the National Farmers Union, the nation's second-largest general farm organization, told Bloomberg that Trump's latest tariffs would hurt American farmers — a large part of his own voter base. ""Trade policy is not a game — it has real and serious consequences for rural America,"" Johnson told Bloomberg, adding ""Immediately after President Trump tweeted his tariff threats, already low commodity prices slipped yet again, but the long-term implications for our country's reputation as a reliable trading partner are likely to be even more damaging."""

BG's soybeans come from Brazil and Argentina. How does this play out in the China tariff battle? Just curious.
never buy BG
Blackout period around news items should be ending allowing big board members to start buying. China news of ramping up big soybean purchases is bullish for BG
"Wow, knew the $82's were coming. Was ready and picked up a few more shares this morning. Maybe we get even cheaper - who knows - but to those selling shares here, I thank you."
"OK, this is getting weird. I keep looking at Corn and Soybeans and they just keep dropping. Many metals are dropping too but Oil, Nat Gas and Iron Ore are all holding up. So we can't just chalk this up to an across the board commodities correction. But there is still no place to hide. CF is dropping as well as CTVA, ADM, INGR. All Ag is ugly! What turns this around going forward? This is all because the Fed says they will raise rates twice in the next 30 months. What a joke! First of all, if they wait that long, we will have real inflation. After raising rates twice, we end up with a Fed Funds rate of 1% two years from now. They call the tightening?? @Sandy Give us a pep talk please. I don't have any money to buy more BG or I would pick up a few hundred more at 75. I hope it doesn't get to 75."
BG has traded flat vs current market correction in October - positive sign.Tomorrow morning 10/31/18 eps surprise lower/higher to move BG stock price.Perhaps adding 3 new board members to push having BG sale or management change sooner than later.Target price low 80s before end of 2018 (wish list).
"Before 2018 ends, best outcome is for BG be sold to the highest bidder.Earlier this year talks must have broken down for near-term deal with ADM and whomever.Would like to see BG sell price 85-90, as a higher price into the 90s ain't going to happen with bad agriculture situation, with Trump's tariff situation threats.GLTA"
Strong Buy here!
There was an article today in FT.com quoting Glencore that they are still looking for assets in US but they don't have anything in sight that is available or suitable (paraphrased heavily).
"Added 600 shares more today, 2000 shares total now. Fully built my BG position. My fair value analysis has this stock at $50.

@Sandy What is going on with our babies? ADM and BG are losing ground after already losing all momentum this month. I am not throwing in the towel as I have sold Calls against both now. My BG Calls are at 115 so I don't think I will lose those by January. We should be so lucky. I see the price of Corn and Soybeans have weakened. I guess this is all about that. My Nat gas stocks are on fire!

"BG earnings to be announced 8/1/18; eps expected higher than last year; if not matched or exceeded, most likely shared price new 52-week lows;Assume higher, and revision looking forward better, price just a small bounce + 3 to 5;The better question is if BG still in play, despite ag tariff issues prevent higher stock price."

Bunge reached a 52 Week high at 78.86
"No news on Bunge bearhug after 3 months of behind-the-scenes negotiations;Either Bunge asking too much or offers too low by Glencore/ADM;Therefore, Bunge stock moves on eps, future outlook good/bad situation.Farming is a cyclical business, and currently down on the dumps;BG to go back low 80s might be a long wait, say by end of 2018;Fear first is BG trades in 60sNot bad with a eps surprise dead-cat bounce, up ~ 4% premarket, but does it have legs.GLTA."
This has been a great mover so far! And the fun is just beginning! $60 is coming!
Yahoo report says BG may value around $100 per share if the deal goes thru.
"I bought this stock because Schwab gave it it's highest rating and it's gone straight down since I've owned it....now, if course, Schwab's rolled back the top rating, analysts are about as useful as hemorrhoids"
Inflation numbers tomorrow will be good for BG!
"This company needs sold, shareholders need to put pressure on board to get a deal done or boot the board!"
Up over 3% on no news so far today. End of tax loss selling and now ppl getting into some relative value?
Wall Street continues to punish the company whether it makes a profit or not
"Glencore likely to be first to come knocking again, this time BG will answer!"
Bought in today. Stock is undervalued!!
"Does anyone have any new thoughts on the Ag commodity pricing? It is really odd to see certain commodities rip roaring and others dropping. I am talking totally unrelated markets. Nat Gas is on fire, Aluminum is on fire, yet Iron Ore is weak. Soybeans are weak and corn is dropping enough to be of concern. Yet, Canola and Oats have been screaming. Perhaps I am missing something but these are very different pricing in an assortment of products. I try to have most of these covered but that also flattens my portfolio . That of course can be good or bad at times like this. @Sandy @Ted."
Seeing it already in market price jumping backEither continental or glencore grabbing shares
this still behaves weird...market up - bg down...
"Good summary for anyone stopping by...July 28 (Reuters) - U.S. agricultural commodities trader Bunge Ltd raised its full-year adjusted profit outlook on Wednesday after stronger-than-expected food and renewable fuel demand for its vegetable oils drove a 41% jump in quarterly income.Shares jumped 3% in morning trading after the company projected full-year 2021 adjusted income of at least $8.50 per share, up from its previous estimate of about $7.50 per share.Bunge's results offer an insight into how global grain traders are emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic that triggered massive shifts in demand last year as consumers cooked more meals at home and avoided unnecessary travel.Increased demand for vegetable oils from U.S. food-service companies and the renewable diesel sector are now lifting Bunge's expectations for earnings, Chief Executive Greg Heckman said. Renewable fuel demand, in particular, has triggered a ""structural improvement"" in oilseed markets, he told analysts on a conference call.Unlike other green fuels such as biodiesel, renewable diesel can power auto engines without being blended with diesel derived from crude oil, making it a low-pollution option. Refiners can produce renewable diesel from animal fats, plant oils and used cooking oil.""There's going to be more capacity needed to meet this demand growth,"" Heckman said.Heckman in May said Bunge was working to squeeze more production out of its existing oilseed crush and refining operations to capitalize on soaring vegetable oils demand.Rival Archer-Daniels-Midland unveiled plans for a new U.S. oilseed facility the same month.Adjusted earnings in Bunge's vegetable oils segment surged 135% to $113 million in the quarter that ended on June 30 from a year earlier. Adjusted earnings in the bigger agribusiness unit fell from last year, though net sales increased.Total adjusted net income in the quarter rose to $2.61 per share from $1.88 a year earlier, beating analysts' estimates for $1.62, according to Refinitiv IBES. Revenues of $15.391 billion topped Wall Street estimates for $11.583 billion. (Reporting by Arunima Kumar in Bengaluru and Tom Polansek in Chicago; editing by Uttaresh.V, Kirsten Donovan)"

Fantastic historic results...Go BG!
I'm thinking this is the right stock for the agricultural disaster in China. anyone else looking at it that way?
"my bp, tot, and spg investments paying off nicely .... just bought shares in oke as well ....this is fun making coin..."
With trump signaling depts to come up with new tariff settlement with China you can bet it will include soy bean sales to China in it which will be very bullish for BG
Drops below $20 on July 29 earnings. Huge losses and dividend elimination assured.
I like this stock
Thinking about picking up $10k worth of shares tomorrow. I don't think this will drop much during the market crash that is inevitable
Here we go again - triple volume move.

"(Bloomberg) -- Oil giant Chevron Corp. and oilseed-and-grain company Bunge Ltd. agreed to pursue a joint venture to build a “farmer to fueling station” supply chain to meet demand for less-polluting renewable fuels.Chevron would tap Bunge’s oilseed processing expertise and farmer relationships to gain a source of meal and plant-based oil that could be used to make diesel and jet fuel through the proposed partnership, according to a Thursday statement. Bunge is expected to contribute soybean processing facilities in Louisiana and Illinois, and Chevron expects to put about $600 million into the venture.“This relationship with Chevron would enable Bunge to better serve our farmer customers by accessing demand in the growing renewable fuels sector,” Bunge Chief Executive Officer Greg Heckman said.The two companies anticipate doubling the combined capacity of Bunge’s facilities from 7,000 tons per day by the end of 2024 through the partnership, according to the statement. The collaboration would also pursue new growth opportunities in lower carbon intensity feedstocks.The joint venture positions Chevron “to expand into the renewable fuel feedstock value chain, which will advance our higher returns, lower carbon strategy,” Mark Nelson, Chevron’s executive vice president of downstream and chemicals, said.Bunge shares surged 3.1% at 9:39 a.m. trading in New York, its biggest jump since July 28, while Chevron’s stock rose 1.2%."

"It is amazing how much damage this CEO did to this company. He continues to lead the company like a trader and he continues to put his buddy traders into key executive positions including latest announcement of appointing Mr. coviello as chief growth officer. Another appointment in which the CEO is taking care of his trader buddy. How convenient? Where in his past experience has he done anything related to strategy? The answer: nowhere. Same goes for retirement of Agri head, replaced by another trader who has not spend one single minute working in the crush plant or port or for that matter any other operating asset. His whole career was on the trading floor...As soon as they realize that they need to change the direction and hire good operators and business people instead of traders they will be better off. These are not old days where companies such as Bunge ripped off farmers as they had advantage on information and with that made huge amounts of money trading and positioning. Those days are over. The only way this company can survive is to get much bigger and vertically integrate with a large food company, focus on the logistics and start expanding the food chain, even buying farm assets. Continue to run this company like a trading house will not end well."
"Glencore in the hunt as ADM offer fizzles;If the rumors are true, per the attached link below.At what price is always of interest;Most likely a low-ball offer in the 80s, given the present situation, although would be nice to see offer in 90s; could be cash and stock offer;https://seekingalpha.com/news/3346886-report-glencore-make-new-takeover-bid-bunge"
Bunge is down 7.70% to 36.42
End of the road for this manangement team - we gave them time to execute and they have failed on several fronts. That buyout offer sounds pretty good now. What is going on ? !!!
"Is this getting near anyone’s sell point? I have to admit that I bought this as an income stream, at what I thought was a good price and better than 5% yield, $38.08. I think I’m out at around $82-84.00. If we get an announcement about the dividend I may reconsider, but this has been a great ride!"
Big soybean yields are headed into storage and not toward bunge which is the largest soybean processor. Farmers are betting china and us will have an agreement soon-soybeans don't store well and rot much faster than corn so maybe that will be a loss to bunge as well. That would support this undervalued situation because of china trade risk remaining high.
Huge Beat!

"Obviously, sell the news!! Has gone from 62 to 78 in 2 weeks!!!"
Purchased some more yesterday. Think high probability Glencore makes an offer around $80 a share by March. Good risk/reward price right now at 65.
"Last week BG stock price has gone higher with no news; could be many reasons such as someone mentioned tax-loss selling over, or bottom fishing; If BG can stay over 70 then I would believe something stirring in the background; won't be good earnings, more like several companies kicking the tires to low-ball offer, if not Glencore, perhaps another competitor.BG is a value play, if management can't turn around, another will.BG near its 52-week lows."
Nice finish for the week.

"@Ted @Sandy Well, someone will have to explain to me how the air gets let out of the inflation trade all at once. All of my Ag stocks including BG, ADM, INGR, CTVA and CF dropped today, but that is in parallel to all of my energy names leading that drop. Of course energy trades independent of farm commodities, but they sure look the same today. On the bright side, this takes a lot pressure off of my nervous calls on OVV. I have a new energy holding that happened as a result of a huge merger that took place between my XEC and COG. The brand new company is big, low debt and mostly Natural Gas now. It is CTRA. You may want to keep an eye on it for grins or for investment. It has been a huge long term massive win for me! It is still worth much more, at least $30. Also pays a nice dividend that will soon be increased."

The 7 BG analysts have upgraded their estimates while maintaining their average $92.67 target price. It's about time they upgraded their estimates because BG has consistently beaten them by a wide margin. Why are analysts so slow to see what's right before their eyes?
I am new to BG. Looks like it f'd up bad in the recent past. However the risk/reward at the current price is compelling and in the meantime I will receive a fat dividend for my patience.
