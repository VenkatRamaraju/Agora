Foster what do you think of BG sale of their wheat mills in Mexico. Is it a signed of trouble that why they are divesting?
"With Chevron in the headlines, it's time to repost:""Increased demand for vegetable oils from U.S. food-service companies and the renewable diesel sector are now lifting Bunge's expectations for earnings, Chief Executive Greg Heckman said. Renewable fuel demand, in particular, has triggered a ""structural improvement"" in oilseed markets, he told analysts on a conference call.Unlike other green fuels such as biodiesel, renewable diesel can power auto engines without being blended with diesel derived from crude oil, making it a low-pollution option. Refiners can produce renewable diesel from animal fats, plant oils and used cooking oil.""There's going to be more capacity needed to meet this demand growth,"" Heckman said.Heckman in May said Bunge was working to squeeze more production out of its existing oilseed crush and refining operations to capitalize on soaring vegetable oils demand."""
"Is this getting near anyone’s sell point? I have to admit that I bought this as an income stream, at what I thought was a good price and better than 5% yield, $38.08. I think I’m out at around $82-84.00. If we get an announcement about the dividend I may reconsider, but this has been a great ride!"
"@Sandy @Ted It does not get any better than this!!!! I love BG. I wish I had much more but I still have plenty to feel good. I actually forgot that they were buying back shares. I will nee to read the CC transcripts to see what they are are going to do now. The stock should still be well over 100 with that report. Meanwhile, I will take it!"
"Very nice to be blind-sided by unexpected good news instead of bad news. Kind of funny for me because all of my Ag investments came from dumping half of my energy portfolio over the last year. Now I actually see an intersection between energy and Ag. We are also getting it with ADM for those of us who own both. I suspect most BG investors possibly own ADM too. Even my Natural Gas companies as well as Aluminum mining S32.AX, are having great weeks. @Sandy @Ted I am glad my Leaps sold on BG have a strike of $120."
So mad I didn’t pull the trigger earlier on this nice company
Happy New Year to all!When I look at Bunge chart I see inflation coming in force.Idem for silver and oil.
"What a result, omg. PT 110"
"Dude on CNBC said palm oil is expensive, maybe this is a good stock to own? Oils in short supply."
"@Ted @Sandy @doug Well, we are finally getting a little traction on an upward creep. I would like to see the stock in the high 80 range before a good ER. The problem has been that the stock has often been in a slow bleed down before earnings and then the report only gets us back up to where we were already at. This earrings report really needs to get us though $100. I don't know if any of you follow INGR? It is creeping up nearing $100. I just have this theory that when either of these break $100, it will be easy to jump to $110-120 levels. My theory may not be supported in fact or stats. I have no calls on anything right now except CF and OVV. I am going to stay that way until things get much higher. Those other two were mistakes I made that are too costly to undo."
"@Ted @Sandy Greetings Ted. You don't know me but Sandy and I are well acquainted so that makes us like minded as well. I am in the same stocks as Sandy other than Gold and FMC. Clearly, BG is my favorite too. I am long term on all of my Ag stocks as well. I also own INGR and CTVA that Sandy does not own. My concern right now is the larger overall inflation narrative. It simply does not seem to be holding up like we all have expected. I am really concerned about what I see happening recently with other than Ag prices. You may not follow Iron Ore but it has imploded over just the last few weeks. We all know oil is collapsing and so are things like lumber that I only track. I am heavily invested in energy and Ag. I dabble in Iron and Aluminum. Honestly, it does feel like there is no place to hide. I have a 29 year old young friend who knows nothing about investing. He laughs at me with my commodity investments because he is all about Bitcoin and ETH. Every day I scratch my head and wonder who will get the last laugh. Trust me, I would not buy crypto at 1 cent on the dollar, just to point our my frustration."
WILL BGEPF + ALPP + AABB = Largest GAINS in 2021 / 2022...??
"Hello Foster,If you’re retired you should have plenty of good dividend paying stocks. Holding some AG stocks is OK but not enough.If you live in a state with high property taxes, sell the house and move to a low tax state or rent where you are,There is no capital gains on the sale of property.You probably know that Sandy is a male.You moved away from FL and living in another state, where ?"
Foster AG is looking like silver with the renewable fuels ( Sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel) any thoughts on Green Plains inc GPRE? looks like an interesting play
"Fellow shareholders, be more active on this MB."
"Food glorious food, prices are going higher, inflation is on the rise. Everyone needs to eat.Bunge will rise like a bungee cord."
Does BG have exposure to Beyond Meat? Could they benefit from increased demand for Beyond Meat products and increasing distribution?
"Added 600 shares more today, 2000 shares total now. Fully built my BG position. My fair value analysis has this stock at $50. Insider purchases and management goal of $5+ earnings per share are encouraging. I believe in this company, especially with their deleveraging and simplified business model. Thats my story, and I'm sticking to it."
"@Sandy There are so live people on our message board below asking some good questions. I am so happy to see some board activity. Perhaps you want to review and chime in on my thoughts. You know so much more than me about these companies! I love the fact that all Ag took off today as a group. BG, CF, ADM and even CTVA is screaming. INGR has been on a tear for two weeks already. I caused CTVA to go up. I sold a few hundred yesterday to buy something else."
i sell it goes higher. i buy it drops
"I bought more prior to earnings. BG is undervalued at under $50, fairly valued around $60 in my opinion. My bullish thesis is: 1) weak US dollar helps BG as they have a significant revenue abroad 2) free cash flow is good for market cap 3) new management with goal of earnings of $5 or more and to deleverage and simplify business 4) decent dividend yield 5) potential take-over target. I believe all of the agri-stocks have strong and improving fundamentals, BG is one amongst them."
"According to earnings call, they had projected earnings to somewhere less than $3.70 for year after Q1 results. After Q2 results, they guided Q3 and Q4 combined earnings upwards by 100 million dollars ($0.55 per share) after the Q2 earnings beat. My estimate for their projected full year earnings guidance is around $4 for 2020 year. 1st half of year, BG generated 715 million free cash flow, using 100 million to buy back stock, 413 million to pay back debt, and 142 million to dividends. If margins are stable, BG is a free cash cow. This stock should be trading nowhere in the 40s with a PE ratio of 15 (15 x 4 = 60), 40% upside from here. I am definitely adding more if I get a chance."
last month i posted $60 target for BG is very realistic ...it is on upswing and nice dividend ..it will catch on as their earnings improve ...it is a work in progress
Very nice follow through after yesterday's move. I like this action much more than the last time. Slow and steady works for me! We are within 30 cents of a new 52 week high. We need to take that out today and then blow through 100 soon! How could you ever sell a stock with these kind of earnings? This stock would be undervalued at $130. Really!
which stock is stronger - BG or ADM?
"Does anyone have any new thoughts on the Ag commodity pricing? It is really odd to see certain commodities rip roaring and others dropping. I am talking totally unrelated markets. Nat Gas is on fire, Aluminum is on fire, yet Iron Ore is weak. Soybeans are weak and corn is dropping enough to be of concern. Yet, Canola and Oats have been screaming. Perhaps I am missing something but these are very different pricing in an assortment of products. I try to have most of these covered but that also flattens my portfolio . That of course can be good or bad at times like this. @Sandy @Ted."
Remember The primary business of CTVA is their seed corn hybrids (Pioneer Seed) based on the current prices of corn commodity farmers are getting motivated to plant more corn so they are booking seed right now for next spring so expect 1 and 2 qts of 2022 to be excellent. I believe the stock will be at $50 to $ 55 next year
"A very good morning to you all.At least $11.50/share this year.Probably more like $15, but whatevs :)"
inflation stock with low P/E and good dividend
"Nice setup today from ADM""Archer Daniels Midland Co. ADM, +0.62% blew past earnings estimates for the third quarter on Tuesday, as it benefited from an integrated supply chain and strong demand. The Chicago-based seeds and agricultural company said it had net income of $526 million, or 93 cents a share, in the quarter, up from $225 million, or 40 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Adjusted per-share earnings came to 97 cents, well ahead of the 89 cents FactSet consensus. Revenue jumped to $20.3 billion from $15.1 billion, also ahead of the $17.9 billion FactSet consensus. CEO Juan Luciano said earnings were boosted by a ""tightly integrated supply chain"" and strong demand and robust crush margins, as well as growth in its nutrition segment. The company is expecting a strong fourth quarter and a second straight year of record EPS, he said. Revenue at the nutrition segment rose 17%."""
Inflation numbers tomorrow will be good for BG!
Back to $80….gotta love an $80’s handle!

"Bunge Limited today announced that Greg Heckman, Chief Executive Officer, will participate in a fireside chat at the Barclays Global Consumer Staples Conference on Wednesday, September 8 at 2:00 p.m. ET."
"(Bloomberg) -- Oil giant Chevron Corp. and oilseed-and-grain company Bunge Ltd. agreed to pursue a joint venture to build a “farmer to fueling station” supply chain to meet demand for less-polluting renewable fuels.Chevron would tap Bunge’s oilseed processing expertise and farmer relationships to gain a source of meal and plant-based oil that could be used to make diesel and jet fuel through the proposed partnership, according to a Thursday statement. Bunge is expected to contribute soybean processing facilities in Louisiana and Illinois, and Chevron expects to put about $600 million into the venture.“This relationship with Chevron would enable Bunge to better serve our farmer customers by accessing demand in the growing renewable fuels sector,” Bunge Chief Executive Officer Greg Heckman said.The two companies anticipate doubling the combined capacity of Bunge’s facilities from 7,000 tons per day by the end of 2024 through the partnership, according to the statement. The collaboration would also pursue new growth opportunities in lower carbon intensity feedstocks.The joint venture positions Chevron “to expand into the renewable fuel feedstock value chain, which will advance our higher returns, lower carbon strategy,” Mark Nelson, Chevron’s executive vice president of downstream and chemicals, said.Bunge shares surged 3.1% at 9:39 a.m. trading in New York, its biggest jump since July 28, while Chevron’s stock rose 1.2%."

"WSJ 9-27-2021A revival in the U.S. Farm Belt is in full swing, boosting markets for land and equipment and raising concerns over farmers’ escalating costs.A months-long rally in prices for major agricultural commodities such as corn and soybeans is pushing up incomes for U.S. farmers and unleashing spending and investment that had been subdued for years, according to agricultural economists and executives. The run-up in land and equipment prices that has followed could leave farmers exposed if big harvests send crop prices lower again, some economists said.U.S. cropland values hit a record this year, federal data shows. Prices for new and used farm equipment have soared, as rising sales and disruptions in key components, such as semiconductor chips, cause shortages and delivery delays for new machinery.As grain prices climbed earlier this year, Illinois farmer Joe Hampton sprang for his first new tractor in years: a 570-horsepower Deere & Co. model with rubber tracks instead of wheels. The list price for such a top-of-the-line tractor is more than $500,000, but Mr. Hampton offset the cost by trading in an older machine. He also had a planter rebuilt and traded in a grain cart for a better used model.“My analysis was that this probably was a good time to buy,” said Mr. Hampton. “A lot of my equipment was getting older. We were cash-starved for the last two or three years.”Retail sales volumes of new high-horsepower tractors in the U.S. were up 27% from year-ago levels during the first eight months of 2021, according to the Association of Equipment Manufacturers. The red-hot machinery market has produced a windfall for manufacturers like Deere, whose profit from large farm equipment surged 50% in the company’s latest quarter.“It’s like the Wild West out there right now,” said Scott Irwin, an agricultural economist at the University of Illinois, referring to the scramble for land and equipment.Until recently, U.S. farmers were in the grips of an agricultural recession brought on by a world-wide crop glut. Starting last year, however, strong demand from China and poor weather in key growing regions fueled a sharp rise in prices for crops like corn and soybeans, which touched their highest levels in eight years during the spring. U.S. agricultural exports are expected to hit records in fiscal 2021 and 2022, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture forecasts.That helped spur a sharp reversal in farmers’ fortunes, with the USDA projecting this month that net farm income would surge 20% in 2021 to $113 billion, the highest since 2013.Place yer bets. - D"

"Good summary for anyone stopping by...July 28 (Reuters) - U.S. agricultural commodities trader Bunge Ltd raised its full-year adjusted profit outlook on Wednesday after stronger-than-expected food and renewable fuel demand for its vegetable oils drove a 41% jump in quarterly income.Shares jumped 3% in morning trading after the company projected full-year 2021 adjusted income of at least $8.50 per share, up from its previous estimate of about $7.50 per share.Bunge's results offer an insight into how global grain traders are emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic that triggered massive shifts in demand last year as consumers cooked more meals at home and avoided unnecessary travel.Increased demand for vegetable oils from U.S. food-service companies and the renewable diesel sector are now lifting Bunge's expectations for earnings, Chief Executive Greg Heckman said. Renewable fuel demand, in particular, has triggered a ""structural improvement"" in oilseed markets, he told analysts on a conference call.Unlike other green fuels such as biodiesel, renewable diesel can power auto engines without being blended with diesel derived from crude oil, making it a low-pollution option. Refiners can produce renewable diesel from animal fats, plant oils and used cooking oil.""There's going to be more capacity needed to meet this demand growth,"" Heckman said.Heckman in May said Bunge was working to squeeze more production out of its existing oilseed crush and refining operations to capitalize on soaring vegetable oils demand.Rival Archer-Daniels-Midland unveiled plans for a new U.S. oilseed facility the same month.Adjusted earnings in Bunge's vegetable oils segment surged 135% to $113 million in the quarter that ended on June 30 from a year earlier. Adjusted earnings in the bigger agribusiness unit fell from last year, though net sales increased.Total adjusted net income in the quarter rose to $2.61 per share from $1.88 a year earlier, beating analysts' estimates for $1.62, according to Refinitiv IBES. Revenues of $15.391 billion topped Wall Street estimates for $11.583 billion. (Reporting by Arunima Kumar in Bengaluru and Tom Polansek in Chicago; editing by Uttaresh.V, Kirsten Donovan)"
