"I bought the dip, anyone else? This company simply buys and conquers the market."
finally the up move they deserve for the strong ER
I think investors are forgetting that orthopedic implants only make up about 1/3rd of Stryker’s business. Stryker also sells beds and acute patient care items that are in very high demand right now.
"Apart from some shorts trying to drag the stock down, looks like it was a nice beat with better guidance. Nice try."

The robotics guides the waves and essentially burns the cancer cells killing them and the body takes care of the rest.
"Once the coronavirus crisis is over, people will go back to getting the orthopedic surgery that they've been putting on hold the past few weeks. Stock has come down to a very attractive buying area and should rebound quickly once the coast is clear(within a few weeks imo)"
"I first began buying SYK back in 2003 on the advice of an orthopedist friend of mine. I believe there's was one split in shares in 2004. Been purchasing ever since. Some of my shares I purchased in low - mid $30 range. Have been purchasing since. Today own close to 16,000 shares. Have sold shares infrequently over the last 15 years. Has been my best investment."
Stryker Is up to something they are way past their usual acquisition due date They are saving money for something

"To All New MESO shareholders and stem cell / MESO naysayers – a lot of us long-time shareholders (Minnesota, Left-e, Seanpierre1, Josephine, Frank/ Tarentella 123, Francesca, George, etc..) have been involved with Osiris for a very long time – some as early as the IPO, and others that have bought over the years. I first bought Osiris in 2011 after a lot of research and continued to buy over a period of years. When Osiris partnered with Mesoblast in October 2013, it was a huge disappointment in my mind – but in hindsight, is was a great decision by Peter Friedli. Peter knew that taking Prochymal – Remestemcel-L to market would have required a lot of capital/dilution. This enabled Osiris to focus on Grafix, GrafixPL, Stravix, etc. Peter was excellent at choosing the right partner for Osiris’ technology/science. NuVasive, Inc. $NUVA for Osteocel, Stryker Corporation $SYK for BIO4, Arthrex for BIO4, etc. until Smith & Nephew $SNN bought our Osiris in March of 2019. Peter was a co-founder of the Osiris along with Kevin Kimberlin. I would suggest EVERYONE search Kevin’s website – first and last name together dot com – to understand his background. I know some long term shareholders who had the opportunity to meet Kevin in the past at Osiris’ shareholders meetings. He is a very intelligent individual and his background is VERY IMPRESSIVE. The SCIENCE is ready for PRIME TIME. Anyone looking at the small sample size of the Covid-19 trial – need to look at the past trials and the success to draw any conclusions. Many of us have had the opportunity to tour Osiris’ headquarters in Maryland – their walls were lined with children that were saved by their SCIENCE. That was their motivation! Peter knew when to partner with the right company. We’ll see when/if MESO will partner with big pharma – hopefully it’s north of $75/share. Until then, do your own research and understand the science/history. We’re at a critical stage of stem cell therapies and MESO is the BEST horse in the race. Disclaimer: long a lot of $ATHX too! …. And the $MDXG Cheerleaders deserve a shout out to – you shouldn’t have drank Pete’s Kool-Aid and listened to Beef, Peter, Wendy, Frozen, BrianX, Homebuilder, etc. – they’re all clueless and people that follow them - continue to miss a great opportunity!"
I'm a long term shareholder. The drop is puzzling after a beat on the top and bottom line and guidance in line with projections. This will probably a major buying opportunity. Does anybody feel differently or have some explanation for the drop?
"I said a major announcement was coming last month (check my history), No announcements, however, their website has quietly changed. Notice anyone missing from the management team photos?"
I cant find anything negative on this. why the drop?
Stryker at a three year low buy buy buy
Stryker buying Wright medical group. This might be the reason for the drop in share price.
"Grafix (wound product) is currently pulling the $OSIR train, yet BIO4 holds huge potential in bone market. BIO4 revenue is growing consistently and at an accelerating pace (compared the same quarter year earlier): Q3 2017 21%Q4 2017 23%Q1 2018 27%Q2 2018 54%BIO4 is distributed by $SYK, keep up the good work!"
Stryker is a stealthy frothy growth stock...kudos to management!
"SYK made just an offer to buy BSX, it's not like it has already bought it! And even if it buys out BSX it would be a great buy for SYK, then why did SYK go down so much?"
Bought again below 200. This stock is almost a quarter of my portfolio so banking on 30 years of great returns.
This is rather shocking. I'm a buyer thinking tomorrow is good can't go much lower
"Bank of America's highest conviction picks for Q2Apr. 01, 2021 8:45 AM ETBooking Holdings Inc. (BKNG)By: Clark Schultz, SA News Editor8 CommentsBank of America publishes its highest conviction picks list for Q2.The firm says the high conviction ideas are based on its views of potential significant market and business-related catalysts that it thinks will affect the stocks in the quarter.Eight buy-rated stocks make the list and two underperform-rated stocks are included.High-conviction buys: Booking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG), Disney (NYSE:DIS), Newmont (NYSE:NEM),NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI), O'Reilly Auto (NASDAQ:ORLY), Parker Hannifin (NYSE:PH), Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) and Stryker Corp (NYSE:SYK).High conviction underperforms: Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) and Iron Mountain (NYSE:IRM)."
It sure would be nice for SYK at this time to do 2:1 split or maybe a 3:1
"I’ve owned this since 1990. Unfortunately, my initial investment was 1500 sharesThis is a great companyBuy and hold"
"What is happening with SYK. 3 investment houses downgraded SYK namely, Goldman Sachs, Citi and Morgan Stanley. Should I sell?"
"I bought in too. The acquisition immediately completes Stryker's sports medicine offering plus gives them an even stronger foothold in Europe, and everything they buy works out. Brilliant company, consistent double digit growth, and a very reasonable PE. And Wright is no slouch...their growth rate was very impressive and warranted the high buyout price. It may not be glamorous, but even if the market corrects at some point, SYK will be at $250 in 2 years. And if you sell a few calls along the way after good runs, you can lock in a few more % points."
Company needs to do a 2:1 or maybe a 3:1 split. their stock would take off afterwards just like TSLA and AAPL after their splits
"Love this company, bought in around 170 a few months back. They have a strong record of increasing shareholder value and price. Absolutely love the long term growth and prospects for this company, even as it captures more market share every year. In saying that I will be adding to this sometime in early 2021 as I do feel that it has some bumps in the road over the next two quarters as more and more elective surgeries (which they specialize in) are being rescheduled due to the second round of lockdowns in Canada and the U.S. The price has run up and not taken into account these elective surgeries being rescheduled, so it should be corrected. The price will reflect this short term problem, but fundamentals of this company and it’s balance sheet are awesome. It is because of this I feel there is going to be a great entry point in the short term, and once Covid is more controlled the sky's the limit for this company. Keep a close eye on this one as a great entry point will arise in the near term and once you buy and hold, you will not regret it!"
Definite buying opportunity
Any idea why up so much after hours?
$SYK Upgrades Evercore ISI Outperform USD 260 » USD 285
"Market is pure sheet, talk of a recession all day in the media , big sell off into the close; the real money is in microcaps that run +50%, +100% or MORE! I caught a +500% winner last month from http://traders.money/free-newsletter-signup-limited-spots"
This is one of the best medical companies out there and they’re not overly leveraged. Strong balance sheet. I’m going to continue to add small amounts here and there.
Taking a beating going into earnings. Stryker has a trail of better than expected earnings. Even a nice report may get washed over by a negative market. But the trend is your friend if you are long SYK. We'll see some numbers soon.
Who should SYK acquire next?
My new Stryker hip is doing well after a short period. I was happy tp controbute to your earnings.
"Buy, final trade by Shannon on the 12 noon show CNBC yesterday."
"""We are pleased with our results, as business picked up meaningfully in the latter part of the first quarter,"" said Kevin Lobo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. ""We expect this momentum to continue and are encouraged by the Wright Medical integration, which is pacing ahead of our expectations.""Guidance is going to be solid........"
"When a company loses as much in market cap as the company they are acquiring, then you know that the street has overreacted. It is not as if the new business they are buying has $0. Go look at Abbv, BMY - both received similar treatment and people who bought those stocks after the haircut are up very nicely. For those saying that SYK overpaid, WMGI has been trading at similar levels in the past - the company being acquired is not just going to agree to the current share price. Also, none of us management - they might see a lot of different things - synergy, fending off competition, new areas of growth etc. Medical field is so daunting - you just don't create a gizmo and start selling it - there is a huge barrier to entry due to all the certifications etc. I have enjoyed very nice growth in SYK over the years - will double down - every time, I have seen this 10% down moves, the stock has recovered - just go look at the 5 year chart."
"Top pick on BNN market call this week. Lots of elective surgeries have been on hold, but as vaccines ramp up and economies improve, elective surgeries will ramp up quickly. And this sp will rise in concert."
Earnings beat plus some hospitals beginning to fast track elective surgeries that have been on hold 1.5 years. Good news for Stryker.
