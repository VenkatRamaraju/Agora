Is there anything happening between now and the end of the year that could raise the price? Considering cutting my losses now on some options. TIA.
"If you’re a day trader, you should definitely check out (http://Pick-stocks.com). They send a watchlist covering the top pre-market movers every day before the open. It’s a great way to pick out potential trades for the day."
"Valens reports earnings after market close today. Remember, SNDL has a 10% stake in the company - and it wouldn't surprise me if one day SNDL buys them out. A positive ER tonight would be a plus for SNDL."
wow. CEO obviously impressed.
"Lol nothing today even tho everything looks great, it would be great if Sndl can at least go above 70 cents or something"
NOT LIKELY to go to .50. We just tested old support at .70. Failed and falling because of the “gap-up” traders. After the gap fills we should test .70 again. Hopefully this PR will keep us above .70 with slight dips from here. Good news though
"The real question is what will the company do about sp before the deadline. I think we are going to find out after earnings. But there are only 2 options,and you guys know one will make you money and the other will lose you money. So unless the ceo can pull a rabbit out of his hat and make a move to bring the stock up,its rs or buyback A buyback isn't a slam dunk,becauseit cuts into their cash hoard,making future plans harder to achieve and the stock less desirable becausethey have less cash.. So would it be something they consider and could it work? Other. would be rs and money will be lost."
"So what is the excuse today ? Usually when SNDL is down , someone always comments the whole market is down . Market has been up for past 2 days ."
"I figure I can make about 15% profit selling nearly sure-shot options on a monthly basis. That would pay my rent, but there are so many short squeeze indicators that I think the chance of a big upside move is pretty good. Decisions, decisions..."
No reason to not buy back 500 million shares at these prices.
0.67 to Over Eleven dollars a share Before This Friday. Double Digit Pricing.
"I am thinking a buyback is needed. Next month if earnings are decent the stock will jump,and if that does happen they can do a smaller buyback. That combination could boost sp to $1,hopefully higher. If the earnings report is not great I feel like they can buy more stock at a cheaper price,but to get sp to $1 it would be a fairly large buyback. If they had to do a rs,I feel like they need to set aside money for a buyback before the rs goes into effect,and then do a series of buybacks to stabilize the sp."
reddit wall street bets squeeze on the way. Hold strong . we going pass the dollars soon
when we getting back to over $3?
"My options data is back online. Who in the heck was buying $6 calls??? The $1 calls were ONE CENT, why would anyone buy the $6 ones???"
$SNDL Has $985.89Min cash
A lot of volume the last couple days. I think its ready to rally.
"I am long,and I already posted that I believe the stock can run up past $1 and we may not need a split. I am just saying why I am not too worried about it. At the end of the day, I believe I will do well,or I wouldn't have bought the stock."
And again SNDL is Way Oversold.
"Back in play . When everybody sees the volume, it will be over a $1 next week."
I don't understand why this is still under a dollar. It seems mostly positive news and positive company actions
Great news. Today will be awesome.
"Way too many bashers on board, we could see $1+ on Monday."

"The State of Nevada reported they made 1 billion in tax revenues from the Marijuana industry last year. The potential is for the number to multiply x 10. SNDL will eventually finance this industry in the US once a few more hurdles are cleared. Right now you can get 100,000 shares of SNDL for 65k. That 65k becomes 250k once this moves up to 2.50 a share. Not a matter of if. Matter of when."

SNDL has plenty of investment capital and they are way ahead of the game with regard to regulation. SNDL has acquired the largest retail cannabis network in Canada, the largest indoor cannabis cultivation facility in Canada, and the largest private retailer of alcohol in Canada. Over 170 retail locations. SNDL is #1!"

"Tomorrow is a big day for SNDL investor, Shorts will never forget,"
"Thanks for the convention post. Psa. Everyone knows that there is too much capacity in Canada. That is why I love sndl moving into finance and now retail. There will be consolidation,and would be nice to start now. I would love to see Sndl authorize a buyback. They can do it from time to time in the open market,no need to do it all at once. It will serve the purpose of showing confidence as well as slowly reducing share count while preserving the cash they raised. Many companies authorize a multi year buyback. Some companies may not finish the buyback. It could really boost the share price."
Booom!!! We will fly tomorrow!!!!!
Food for thought: Alcanna shareholders will own 16% of sundial outstanding shares once this is done. Alcanna would not agree to this deal if it just meant sundial adds another 400 million shares and further dilute the company. So how will this deal work exactly? Anyone with actual financial wisdom on here that can explain???
"A share buyback is not necessarily worth it from the company's perspective. Especially if they can just issue new shares instead. It would squeeze out the low end shorts, which would be a very aggressive move."
"A short squeeze is created by an imbalance of supply and demand. Shorts need to cover,and the float is small so that created demand for something with limited supply. Obvious to most people,but some think that applies here. There are over 2 billion shares outstanding. What exactly would be squeezed here. Momentum traders and short term enthusiasm could drive the price up like last week,but it would come down fairly quickly. Fundamentals are all that will keep this price up."
"It really boggles my mind that people are selling this short with virtually no comprehension of the fundamentals whatsoever, but hey, every person I met was telling me that bitcoin was a scam when I was mining it at $7 a coin. Now those same people are paying $50,000 a coin. Go figure."
"The stock market is designed to ripp off day traders. Day traders are MEANT to lose money, and it's working perfectly."
"Maybe they should do gambling. I mean loansharking,drugs,alcohol. Gambling would be the next logical step in my opinion."
TLRY said sales increased to $168 million from $117.5 million.Their loss isn't due to sales.
"Definitely a game changer for this company, 300 plus outlet locations producing profits as well."
Short volume was over 50% every single day for WEEKS and this is inching up. Zero short share availability. These shorts are dead in the water. It’s just a question of how much money they want to lose now.
$SNDL has nearly $1 billion in Cash. To Acquire Alcanna For ~$346M
Why is SNDL shorted? I don't even know. Stigma???
"just bought another 300 shares. holding for the long haul. almost at 4,000 shares. we will see sndl back above $3 dollars in the next year! be strong long holder and buy more if it drops. after the merger this company will be very diversified! not just in MJ"
Looking at the charts we have a perfect cup and handle. This should be and interesting week!!
"I guess the shorts can buy calls to cover their shorts from earlier this year, it all gets pretty sophisticated."
"The rally we had last week was short lived. If you blinked you missed it. My take away from it is that the positive move of adding profitable liquor stores was muted by the fact they issued more shares vs. paying cash. So now they will have .40 a share in cash. Not all of the sp is backed in cash. That is why I feel a mulyi-year buyback is a good move. They can preserve cash for opportunities that they find attractive,but let investors know that they won't just dilute them going forward. Honestly for this stock to ever return higher,this dilution has got to be dealt with. Not just dilution in the past,but not doing it going forward. One analyst raised the price for sndl to .75-.80,which in the short term is good upside,and yet the stock hardly moved. With such little coverage on the company, that could have has a better impact on the sp,but my feeling is that dilution is the issue that keeps investors away,and management needs to deal with it. I have no problem with the shares issued to raise capital in the past,but now they should be well capitalized,and assurance would be needed that it won't keep happening. Doing a buyback,even a small one over an extended period of time,gives us that,and let's us know management is serious about creating shareholder value. Until then every dip will be bought and every pop will be sold by the market because it seems to speculative for most investors. I think $1.5 is a reasonable price for sndl if they don't dilute and can execute on their strategy,but until they are willing to be shareholder friendly,we aren't going to steadily climb in that direction."

"Zack was interviewed by Jelani Gibson, content lead for NJ Cannabis Insider at NJ Advance Media.Operational Challenges George first talked about the challenging times the company had when he took the role of CEO in February 2020. While the company’s cultivation results were poor, Sundial was spending too much capital, burning roughly $15 million a month, with peak debt of around $250 million, he said. The company was facing two realities at the time, George said: One, “If we didn’t have a successful recreational business in Canada we likely didn’t have a business,"" two, the company needed restructuring. By a series of restricting moves like large asset sales, exiting six countries and letting go more than 500 employees, Sundial managed to retire all of its debt and refocus the business model, the CEO said. “We're looking to really be a partner to the industry and not just compete with the next LP beside us,” George said, adding that the second pillar of the company’s model is concentrated on finding out where economic returns are being earned in the cannabis space.The Canadian Vs. American Cannabis Market George believes that the Canadian cannabis industry will form some version of an oligopoly, with several large and a number of very important smaller players in the space, he told the Benzinga conference. “I would say that the regulatory framework in Canada is quite challenging and dysfunctional,” the CEO said, highlighting issues such as excise taxes that he said are burdensome, different regulations from province to province, rules around how many retail doors you can own or manage and permissible levels of vertical integration, and nonsensical product level restrictions. He called for ""some common-sense reform"" in Canada. When it comes to America, George said it has a clear, massive total addressable market with many opportunities, but also a lack of capital, an issue many people assume federal legalization would resolve.What are we going to see in case of federal legalization is the wrong companies getting capitalized and too much competition, the CEO said. “It’s highly likely that some of the same mistakes we've seen in Canada will actually be made in the U.S. as well.”CEO Excited About Sundial’s Future When it comes to the company, George revealed that Sundial is thrilled about the two pillars of its business and about the recent transaction with Alcanna, which should be closed before the end of the year.“We'd love to see our credit portfolio grow from over $300 million today to north [$500 million] in the coming months,” George concluded."

"One day its possible that sndl trades different than the weed sector. I say that because of the diversification at sndl. One day it is also possible that the sector rallies. I just think the latter will be few and far in between. Investors know that until we get legalization here,this sector is not going anywhere. So this is helping sndl trade below where I think it should be. Sndl is careful not to grow at all costs,the other companies are bleeding cash. Sndl wants to survive and thrive. They want to swallow up the remains of broken companies in the future."
Is this right??? Essentially a huge buyback is essence.Alcanna shareholders will own approximately 16% of the outstanding Sundial common shares.

"Last week nobody wanted to buy. This stock went down to .61. I bought the dips. When the news came out,everyone wanted in. I took some profits. Now I'm buying here because I have always done better chasing value vs. momentum. When people start chasing they lose money. If you believe in what you own,you'll hold it longer. The people who bought on the news have left,and created an opportunity to buy cheap. They should have bought now,but they are frustrated,so they mock it. Stocks run up and come down all the time,this one does it more frequently than most. The truth is Sndl has done things,that while unpopular with many investors and commentators,they were the right things. Raising money,paying off debt,diversifying revenue streams,all very necessary. Sometimes its unclear to people what's going on until its too late. This has been unfolding very slowly,and one day it will be double where it is now,and then people will all want in. The time to buy is now. The time to sell is then. Really that simple."

I have 15k in this,I sold calls on some of them to protect myself from downside risk. I liked sndl because of the cash on hand,and it was trading below book value. The compliance issue bothers me. Now book value is lower on a per share basis because they issued more stock. A rs or delisting feels imminent. The sector is weak. Too much capacity and regulation in Canada. I like sndl over the other companies because they wisely are branching out. This company could be worth way more down the road. It could be a painful journey though."
"If you believe in this rally,buy calls. If I knew it was going to .74 by 11:59a.m.,thats real specific. I would buy calls.,instead of selling them which I am doing now. I am glad I bought shares at the open."
"I think this is an interesting stock. If they can manage their businesses,we may see consistent profitability next year. Combine that with cash on hand,and all the negative sentiment,and we could get a huge rally. Delisting will never happen. This company values their listing and either it goes up on good earnings or they do a rs. Rs not a big deal to me. Bulls and bears overreact to up and downside. Not going to 10,not going under .50. More than likely will go much higher when people have given up on it."
