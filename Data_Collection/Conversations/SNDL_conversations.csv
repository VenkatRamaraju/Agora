Sundial allowing investors to submit questions in writing? Anyone going to submit one and see if it gets answered? I'd like to ask if the company has any plans to buy back shares to increase shareholder value.
"From today's Interview with Zack George - ""We are sitting on ample cash liquidity today, we have not raised any capital whatsoever in the last quarter. We are focused on deploying that capital in a creative manner which we are very excited to show the results of in both the next upcoming quarter which we report in the second week of November and then in Q4 and Q1 we think that the numbers are going to be very interesting to the investing public""We are very excited to show the results of in both the next upcoming quarter? I like the sound that!!I think this company has turned the corner and is looking at better and better days ahead.Go to the 17:40 mark to listen, https://soundcloud.com/newcannabisventures"
There’s like a million share buy order here. We’re good to go.
"Thinking out loud here. Welcome any replies by mature adults who dont hurl insults simply because someone posts an opinion:Last call they stated they had a plan in place that they would execute before the deadline regarding the stocks SP and Nasdaq compliance. They didnt say what that plan was, but it is very feasible that the amount of time have let this languish this low has created enough consolidated value to support a buyback at a premium. I do not think they do a reverse split because their last couple of acquisitions have been stock based deals. That lends itself to the theory the reason for the abundant share count is that shares of SNDL will always be integral to their M and A strategy."
Another day haroo came to the chat to let us know sundial is below $0.70 cents
The Q3 date you are seeing on your trading platforms is Not confirmed. Just wait for Sundial's press release.
Next week looks to be good.

Buying frenzy glad to see we have new members here its great that you see
I estimate that the current book value has to be at least 58 cents USD per share. The CEO has already stated that they have hedged the cash consumption of the core cannabis business by issuing loans. They were already at near profitability last quarter and they have given positive guidance. How can anyone possibly believe that this company's future prospects are not worth a mere 7 cents per share? Especially when you consider that there are 295m short sold shares that must eventually cover.
1.4 B Market cap 277.1% 12 Month trailing return 900M+ In the bank And a share price of only $0.66 ??
"Chopsticks, ""I'm going to sell my shares at .6580 and buy back in at .6565 to save myself $1.23. Then when it goes to .6591 I'm going to sell and take my profits of $2.29, add that to the coins I've saved over the year, and buy a Happy Meal from McDonald's."""
"If they have to actually TRY to hold the price down, that's a good thing."
Everyone put your sell orders at 10$ a share!!!
