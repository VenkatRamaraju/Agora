Initiated a position two weeks ago and waiting for a little more dip to buy more. I’m not expecting a reversal is going to begin before 2022. I might be wrong but let’s see…
"Shareholders getting fleeced, Christ. If you are still holding, ask yourself … why?"
Blood in the streets on this one.
Zack‘s investment has a sell Signal on STNE! That doesn’t surprise me none about Zack’s They always had a sell signal on this.￼￼￼ ￼I never new why
this is starting to look interesting
This stock has zero gas in the tank right now.
They had some interesting insights about STNE on (http://Multistockalerts.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"Okaaay and what are Q3 numers gonna be? no idea, inter stock is down, how credit revenue was 300 million + on a 2000 million credit portfolio is a mystery to me. Are the clients paying 15% interest on yearly basis?"
SoftBank-backed Banco Inter and StoneCo In Talks On Possible Merger…………….acePS. Reuters
down 7% and up 1% lol
is there anyone out there with anything intelligent to post to this board......please help....
"Next earnings, I mean loss announcement are going to be terrible. The Cayman island authorities need to investigate this guys."
NPL is a big red flag!new accounting matrix for reporting is another red flag!i feel investors going to sell
Too much debts even at 52 wk low
"Ark bought 181,000 shares yesterday."
Reminds me of SQ action. Long since $22 in 2020. Bought SQ in the high teens and low 20s in 2017 and haven’t sold a share yet
"I am calling a merger, given the options activity at usd 75 and expiry on oct 27. Just the same date, the Banco Inter has earnings call with clients"
"Even though Stone is in a negative flow right now, the core business is still growing with 40 to 50% per year, even without the credit service. Obviously the credit issue sets the company back in earning by a year, the p/e with a net earnings potential of 0,4 usd (without credit service) and a growth of 50% still gives it a forward pe of 70ish. Geven that many other companies with lower growth have much higher pe's, just is a sign that there enough monet around to push it back up. Just wait for the sentiment to turn around again and have some faith..."
Bought more today.
Unreal opportunity to sock some away at this price.
I keep buying lol 
It’s temporary
new meme stock? fun.
"Lol no wonder people don’t make any money in the stock market. They buy and sell at wrong times. Good company, could go well over 100B market cap in 5 years."
"I'll never invest in non-US stocks again, US stocks more safer than others."
going up up again :)) This will be a good week
Cayman Island ponzi scheme is collapsing
A big down day in the overall market and STNE drops 8-10%. Not an issue if you are holding L/T and on the way to a better buying opportunity in the 20's. The folks who have bought with Margin will continue to depress this until we get past the credit issue and then will see a steady upward path. I'm adding between 25-30.
"sadly. I bailed. 50k down since 51. but I'll be watching these options of course. probably back in in 30 days either at 20 or 40. either way its a good long bet. and at 20 my 10,000 new shares will bring in some due dough.let's watch."
I'm slowly starting to question if buying at $75 in January was a smart decision.
what was rev & eps-this is so confusing to read
"$STNE should have a major rebound quarter in Q3, resolving their credit lending issues, will cause stock to spike. Great time to add/buy."
Wasn't long ago it seemed like $100 was going to be a sure thing for this stock.
"Motley fool trying their best to pump this stock but this stock doesn't care, he loves red color."
It does drop like a stone.
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/innovative-payment-solutions-inc-launches-110000231.html
"16 -18 more days to Q3 before the tables are turned against the shortists. Linx earnings to be included in Q3, no more credit provisions and last but not least, promising year-end sales to boost TPV for Q3 2021!"
"Increased my position. Owner of 1110@47.00. Not leveraged, so even if I have to wait 2 years, to go to my sell target of usd 80.00, it’s worth it. Good Luck, All!!! Options intricate some big are expected in October."
What would Warren and Kathi know about Brazil ???
has something to do with pags
sad stone. been dead bagging at 38.5...
"ok. upped my position to 5000 today on a $42.75 buy. not the biggest fish, of course but cmon, this is a no brainer. cash rich, positive revenue with great projections. in a year just the covid improvement alone will shoot this puppy up 25%.But okay, I'm ready to see bottom. go long. 2 years for a three bagger is good dough and Warren knows it."
"This is both a management execution issue and regulatory matter on the credit side of their business. I expect any management engaged in banking to have appropriate risk management controls in place, reflective of their environment. Sadly, this did not happen, and will likely take time to resolve. Credit problems generally do not resolve in 4-6 months. Bearish for at least a year."
My opinion stne goes back to the 15 to 20 range . cheers
Orange Capital Invest did a deep dive on STNE
"Dissapointing quarter mostly due to credit mistakes, which service they already tuned down to almost none in july. Excluding that part, revenge grew 68% you which is amazing. Since the negative business part has been tuned down, it means that from now the revenue and earnings for next quarter will improve massively. With current valuation a great buy."
Could be the us interest rates.
pls.. no more new bottom...
"STNE Is $104 Stock In A Few Short Quarters, Trading @ $33. Totally unheard of. Start Building Your Positions………………….ace"
These guys still in business or what?
"TPV for Q3 and Q4 will be good due to surge in year-end sales and that translates into higher Net Income and hence, higher EPS."
Sure hope we've seen the bottom!
Added today . I will sell tomorrow if 2-3 bucks up
"They admitted a mistake with the credit solutions. Credit solutions drag the profit down… a lot. But they took action very fast, and reduce the exposer to credit solutions to clients. You can see that in the less 1 million RB in July. Next quarter we will have the LINX revenue integrated. This quarter no. Now it’s fix the credit solutions, because they need to have it in Brazil. And look forward. If the stock tomorrow falls to 45, I will buy more. I’m buying since 20."
wish i never bought
"man I wish i bought more than just 25 shares at $45 this morning lol I do hold 3 long call options, good luck everyone!"
"40$ seems to be the floor, that's good news, we might start moving forward soon once the market re-stabilizes."
StoneCo is up 5.10% to 35.27
bullish divergence in RSI and MACD. downtrend broken in one hour. expecting a bull run now. according to analyst they are going to be profitable in upcoming earning on Aug 30. Bull run in near future confirm.like if you agree
"First green day in like 2 straight weeks? A much appreciated breather, hopefully starting to rebound soon!"
"When this recovers back to mid 50s, selling it… then no more international stocks for me again…first Chinese stocks and now this…."
Fresh new LOWS today...
Sad about this one. Had high hopes
"stne noooooooo what are you doing, stahp it already"
What caused the recent major drop in price?. Anyone?
Back to the 20th!
They will no doubt use the $200M for Buybacks during this time…………….ace

worst performer in boti-60 portfolio (to be found in botinv site)
When’s the earning call?
"Jesus, all this stock does is go down! I wanna avg down but not sure I can trust this one."
"huge support at 44$ , next week we can expect a recovery"
Going bk? Really looks like a credit risk has been exposed or something. Looks terrible.
"Winding up quickly, looks like 25$ very soon. Hard to accept"
"once this get's down back to the IPO price, I am buying!"
"Getting tempting to jump back in. Bought in the $40’s, sold in the $60’s before it went to $90’s, was kicking myself. Turned out to be an OK choice"
"Anyone else see this and hope this helps this stock since it's been a complete dog the past several months. UPDATE 3-SoftBank-backed Banco Inter and StoneCo in talks on potential merger -source2:52 PM ET 9/24/21 | ReutersUPDATE 3-SoftBank-backed Banco Inter and StoneCo in talks on potential merger -source(Adds details on losses, updates shares)By Carolina MandlSAO PAULO, Sept 24 (Reuters) - SoftBank-backed digital lender Banco Inter SA and payments company StoneCo Ltd are in preliminary talks to expand a current partnership agreement, including a potential merger, one source familiar with the matter said.StoneCo acquired a 4.99% stake in Banco Inter in June, as part of a strategy of attracting the bank's clients to its payments services.The talks are the latest sign of stepped-up dealmaking involving a new breed of financial companies that have emerged as rivals to Brazil's once-dominant traditional lenders.The current talks come as StoneCo faced a 400-million-real ($75 million) loss in its newly-launched lending operation due to higher provisions.If StoneCo and Banco Inter agreed on a merger, it would create a financial institutional with a market capitalization of roughly $22 billion.Both U.S.-listed Stoneco, which has a market value of $12.5 billion, and Banco Inter, with a $9.8 billion market cap, said they do not comment on rumors.Under their existing partnership, Inter offers Stone's processing services to its clients and merchants who use Stone to process credit and debit cards are being offered connections to Inter's nascent online marketplace. It was unclear what a deeper partnership absent a merger might involve.Brazilian newspaper Valor Economico reported earlier on Friday on the talks.Shares in Banco Inter were up 0.8% in early afternoon trading, after rising more than 4%, while shares in StoneCo were up 0.1%.($1 = 5.3365 reais) (Reporting by Carolina Mandl, additional reporting by Tatiana Bautzer; Editing by Emelia Sithole-Matarise and Nick Zieminski)"
ARK is averaging down https://cathiesark.com/ark-combined-holdings-of-stne
Will consider buying at 17-18
"I think we reached the bottom, but market condition doesn't help this stock to break out"
This company is so undervalued if you look at the long term..
"Love the company, patience people. Buy more"
"Hard to time the bottom, but with this steady growing volume last few days smells like a reversal heading into ER."
"Steve Mandel just bought 7,000,000 more shares based up his September 9th filing bringing his total up to 15MM+ With a basis of roughly $67, I'll put my money where Lone Pine Capital puts their money. I'll see you all back in the $60's."

Holding up better than expected...
Can anyone explain why it went down in the first place?
Yikes! Last one to cover will loose more
$STNE has massive potential. Speculative for sure but who wants a stock that only gives you a 5% growth annually. I'm going to the moon!!! See ya'll at $50+ later this year!!!
what's going on in Brazil now? COVID? they have some cold frost? something else?
Will probably trade in the 40-50 rage for the rest of the year
"LATAM fintech stocks getting pounded lately. PAGS, MELI, STNE, DLO, Banco Inter. I don't really understand why."
finally we reached the bottom.
Wow...I made good money when I sold in Feb.But now lost some of that profit as i bought some shares a few weeks ago.Bought when already down 50%Talk about a slaughter!!!!
"I really do hope we have finally bottomed out, but this really needs more buyers, 2% rebound during a super green day like this is still not ideal. But I'm hopeful for its long term outlook for being the biggest market in South America!"
this is a disaster
Management will have a stellar performance when they report Q3 numbers in the last wk of October 2021.
Time to buy. At least that’s my gut feeling
Sold @ $63 … then it jumped to $70. Got sad. Now I can’t stop laughing.
"so weird that STNE moves with the Dow. But just gonna buy the dip.3rd qtr when Linx pops revenues up like a big dog, I'll ride my now 5500 shares to 62 and bank 110k...unless, of course, i buy more. which is probable. Just oozing to the 78 middle mark the 16 analysts still support will bank 116k. sure, oozing back to the high of 97 will take both investor confidence and 18 months of solid numbers but imho with linx, settling credit biz and covid impact reduction, all acclaimed no brainers in the next year or so, the 100 the analysts still project is simply going to happen. By then I'll pump up to 7500 shares and poof! Baby got bank!Good luck serious longs."
Buffet lost his touch
we are below IPO price lol
This is weird...a day where we don't make a new 52 week low. I forgot there were days like this.
Don’t jump ship now - this is going places!
Down 25% in last 30 days & still falling!
Shorts are in charge. Until there's some kind of positive news they will remain so. Hope I'm wrong. Guess work to call a bottom. Long
"wow up 11%. Be careful though, jump it at pull back safer."
"clearly, $31.48 was the bottom. We will be back to a new ATH in no time (right?)"
Orange Capital Invest has a comprehensive analysis on STNE
"Ggggreat time to enter , won’t go much lower could go to $80 in a year. Could get bought up to."
this is disgusting
Forward p/e of 6. Going back to 100. I’ll buy your shares at $49
Start of reversal. Need another week to round out.
"If today we close on 47.46 support or above, we rebound will be quicker than most think, and if not, we are in for some more pain. Thoughts?"
"new day, new 52 weeks low LOLmarket cap decreased by half in 1 month, what's going on here?"
earnings report will be good
Yeow. 20s are a reality. Just think how much we will make when 3rd and 4th qtrs show upswing and Linx pops revenues. Beuler? Beuler?

What‘s with Buffett ?
"Down, -8k on the position, average buy is around usd 47. Given the merger news expected the stock to be in green today. Disappointing"
new 52 week low lol
Year-end tax selling coming. May hit 20 if next earning is still bad.
weak stock
I have a feeling this stock will have one big crash to $22 before hitting the bottom
"mama mia, dropping like a stone.if warren sells, it then expect to go below $20."
Results aren’t good if you take out the one off gain… Do people agree?
There is a big option in Oct for $75. Something is cooking big.
Few Reasons to buy STNE (for anyone new) :If you want to Invest in emerging market / Developing countryBrazil #$%$ and e-commerce market will likely have hyper growth (5% to 50% in 5 years) Brazil banking sector is one of the highly profitable compared to USA or Canada or any. Stone Co have a good base and potentially can tap into Hyper growth STNE business agreement with Linx is a big deal Moreover STNE is in over sold territoryDD Summary: Can this go wrong? Definitely Yes! But if succeed the reward will be huge!
what was IPO price?
She's dropping her drawers! Buying opportunity between 20-25!!!
Looks like we're about to see $38 very shortly and if market corrects over the next 60 days (and good vhance it might) STNE hits $29
More inside selling!
"Sinking like a...... well, you know. Stone"
Short squeeeezzze coming next week
Buying in to Banco Inter is a good thing…when they IPO next year STNE will get shares at a Nice price Mr. Buffett and I are very Long term bullish on this one
"$75 options selling like hot cakes. hmmmmm...someone knows either linx is bumping up 3rd quarter results or merger talk is expected to kick the stock price. someone who has more inside info than me...and zacks is useless of course.you can bet ill jump back in and ride it back to the 100 now being tossed around. be cool if it sunk to 20 and I could pick up 10,000 shares before whatever upward slide is going on. but it looks like we've hit bottom and I'll be back in at 39 or so. what a roller coaster. $75 options? go figure."
StoneCo is up 4.90% to 52.53
short squeeze
the government might swing to the leftist if the economy stays bad
any news? why getting down everyday
"Increased my position last night. Own 532@51.30. I know the swings, but why such drop today, who is selling? I mean I am not levered so, can wait it out and won’t sell, just trying to understand the reason behind such drop, today. Is it hitting stops?"
48$ before earnings
"Most finance stocks are down today, including Visa and Mastercard. Chillout and buy more."
"Just question i really don't know, If Stoneco will acquire Banco Inter, is it helpful for rebounding?"
Stock is following Brazilian Real / USD movements… until a bigger catalyst for the company comes about.
"Okay, we’re down again today. Do I sell and cut my losses or do I start to buy a few more shares to bring down my average cost. I guess the real question is how much further down is this going to go?"
Someone just buy this out for 20 billion
"its hard but analysts all still soooo positive about potential. Not giving in the towel. Bought more today and will continue to if it slides a bit more.if you are long, you're long. and if so there's a huge payoff in 18 months. good luck longs! There are a few trolls with very, very little invested burping up #$%$ about sliding to 20 and Buffet is a loser. look closely. theres a big L on their foreheads and no real money in their portfolio.my barbell is dvn and how sweet it is. see you on the upside."
Q3 and Q4 has always has been a strong quarter for Stone co for the last few years. Waiting for Q3 2021. But i am super bullish on Q4 2021. My PT for Q3 is $53 - 63. Lets see.
From Cayman Island
no borrowed or emergency funds to be invested cannot stomach the drop when there is one
"This is going down into the $20th. even though buffet owns it, he is not always right. This will go below the IPO price at some point."
this stock need Jesus
Orange Capital Invest has a deep analysis on STNE
"Nearing capitulation! Remember, “The stock market is a devise to transfer money from impatient to patient.” You don’t get T.RowePrice as a top holder unless they’re top shelf."
any idea why this stock has dropped significantly the past 6 months besides the small cap crash in feb-march?
here comes the 30's
internal issues exist in this company. Smart money continues to exit this position.Wait till there is clarity before buying any shares... BE CAREFUL.
"Up on high volume, a great indicator that we might have hit the bottom on Oct 11. Happy Friday and have a a great weekend everyone."
Cathie is buying! This is a no brainer at these levels! Will be holding for 5years at least
this stock need to soar 50% to reach $48 lol
Just opened a position with 3 k stocks! It is long term bet though!
If feels like we are forming a bottom. I picked up so shares yesterday and cost averaged down.
why did the 1 yr target est go to $458 from round $85
Its been rough since my buy in price @ 44 usd
STNE business is still strong and a lots of customers and for next quarter will be better I hope STNE is will $60-$70 range could be reach soon. Investors are still holding otherwise will sue. I hope STNE still good business will see $60-$70 range
Just go to zero already!! Quit messing with people!
"Very heavy volume on red. Not a good sign. Will buy some in low 20s, whenever."
Yup. Bottom of dip. oozing to 50. Filler up! Buying again today. STNE at 45 is a no brainer for longs.
Look at PAGS
$454.99? Where does this price target come from?
"this stock is below it's book value. this is discounted AF, growing, acquisitions, so much cash and short term investments, customer growth and don't forget the massive buy back they are doing at the moment, just last quater they retired 7.76k worth of stocks. and rumors are wrong about Berkshire selling this, thank you sellers, I uped my stake by about 35% in the last 3 weeks, let's go sell shorts I want more for cheaper price, you guys are super funny and helpful!! much appreciated."
63% off from its high and still wnats to move lower. STNE will hit $29 before any meaningful move up. STNE's decline is not yet over even with a 63% loss from its high...
uh oh. 30?
"Lower lows almost daily only mean lower lows. if youre long, may as well get out or short ot as a hedge....the trend is obviousy clear."
"if hedge funds buying STNE, why this stock going down??!!!"
"Please dont curse this stock with "" TO THE MOON"".... :V"
"$2,000 in a bag by tomorrow. Bad but not Bad. Was it me or was reading the report was messed up."
Barron's sees trouble ahead for Brazil. Decline of its resource economy and political problems.
"no hope, I'm giving up"
Warren Buffett is holding a bag or what?
Big boys are coming
Just bought in @ 32.96$ Hope credit issue will be solved soon so it can be priced in again. GL All
Last year it went down to the $17.00 range! That’s a buy!!
"squeeze, bounce will be hard"
"Other than the recent, and brief and limited, stumble due to a very esoteric local regulatory issue about credit, which the company quickly addressed, I'm having a hard time seeing anything wrong with STNE. (Yeah, yeah, covid, brazil, etc.) It has completely reasonable P/S and P/E ratios. From the last conference call, it sounded like the company might even have over-reserved for potential impact of the credit issue, so those reserves could be released back to earnings. (Maybe?) I wonder if the recent price drop was due to some fund rotating out for unrelated reasons."
"1 year target on yahoo is 454.99. That must be in PENNIES, $4.54."
"This ""Stone"" rock is better..."
"As I thought. 43 by Friday and I'm buying 2500 more shares. This company has 2.9B net cash. NO DEBT. It will slide to 50 quick and ooze up till mid 22 and poof! 85 and bucks for us longs. Two years, covid gone, 120. Boat drinks."
The death spiral continues.
No recovery for this one for at least a quarter. They must demonstrate that their credit problem is not part of a crumbling business strategy.
I have made a little Money when the stock was on its way up but then I saw no I am buying back in does anyone have any positive advice￼
"wow, I just dont know what will it take for this to rebound just a little bit? I read online in Brazillian their services are everywhere..."
"turning red in 3,2,1....."
Yo VRUS stock and STNE best
just bought 1000 shares. now it hopefully will move upwards
how does the math work for those options at75 by 27th? I like to hear your wisdom.
"My sentiment hasn’t changed however it will be kicked down the road 1-2 quarters. I, like most was not expecting this, but it to shall pass and STNE will be back on the road to success. STNE is a solid company and a long term hold………………ace"
Are you guys Stoned?
