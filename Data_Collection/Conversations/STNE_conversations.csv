Any recent news on stne any article guys?
"Up on high volume, a great indicator that we might have hit the bottom on Oct 11. Happy Friday and have a a great weekend everyone."
Orange Capital Invest has a deep analysis on STNE.
Can anyone explain why it went down in the first place?
Iâ€™m down 60% FML!
"Every single group, analyst, market projection, etc calls for huge growth and eps numbers over 18 months. Even the last quarter, with the funky news about credit, blew Street revenue projections away. Though STNE is still basically under the radar with few published analyst projections and a black hole of articles written on any kind of regular basis, STNE still has impressive large investors and schmucks like me that are convinced this horse is going to get back up and ride hard again. So. Sell at 33 and buy at 30? Or just watch your portfolio take a hit until it turns around? Who knows? But I must say, the complete silence from STNE makes me feel like the next report isn't going to make anyone happy because of credit and poor linx movement. For those with available dough at that time, buying the impending dip will be awesome. For those just holding on or if the numbers are at least above the .12 expected eps, then the hump will be over and by next August big profits enjoyed. So, basically, there's no bad news. Just a choice as to how you play it. For me, my finger is on the trigger. Ill dump it all at 33 and buy back when the fog has lifted. And that's the latest from Lake Woebegone. Good luck."
In most cases a short report is a buying opportunity. Viceroy most likely closed it's position today.
"not to brag, but I'm now only down less than 20k on my stne position"
Berkshire Hathaway backed Nubank news is killing STNE and PAGS - (IPO valuation aimed at $55B)
Shorts are in charge. Until there's some kind of positive news they will remain so. Hope I'm wrong. Guess work to call a bottom. Long
