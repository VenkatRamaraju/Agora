what's going on in Brazil now? COVID? they have some cold frost? something else?
StoneCo is down 6.84% to 36.24
Too much debts even at 52 wk low
"$75 options selling like hot cakes. hmmmmm...someone knows either linx is bumping up 3rd quarter results or merger talk is expected to kick the stock price. someone who has more inside info than me...and zacks is useless of course.you can bet ill jump back in and ride it back to the 100 now being tossed around. be cool if it sunk to 20 and I could pick up 10,000 shares before whatever upward slide is going on. but it looks like we've hit bottom and I'll be back in at 39 or so. what a roller coaster. $75 options? go figure."
Someone just buy this out for 20 billion
"if the index can end in green, so shall this today."
Short squeeeezzze coming next week
This stock has zero gas in the tank right now.
"Just question i really don't know, If Stoneco will acquire Banco Inter, is it helpful for rebounding?"
"16 -18 more days to Q3 before the tables are turned against the shortists. Linx earnings to be included in Q3, no more credit provisions and last but not least, promising year-end sales to boost TPV for Q3 2021!"
internal issues exist in this company. Smart money continues to exit this position.Wait till there is clarity before buying any shares... BE CAREFUL.
wish i never bought
Year-end tax selling coming. May hit 20 if next earning is still bad.
you cant loose at this price
There is a big option in Oct for $75. Something is cooking big.
"Every single group, analyst, market projection, etc calls for huge growth and eps numbers over 18 months. Even the last quarter, with the funky news about credit, blew Street revenue projections away. Though STNE is still basically under the radar with few published analyst projections and a black hole of articles written on any kind of regular basis, STNE still has impressive large investors and schmucks like me that are convinced this horse is going to get back up and ride hard again. So. Sell at 33 and buy at 30? Or just watch your portfolio take a hit until it turns around? Who knows? But I must say, the complete silence from STNE makes me feel like the next report isn't going to make anyone happy because of credit and poor linx movement. For those with available dough at that time, buying the impending dip will be awesome. For those just holding on or if the numbers are at least above the .12 expected eps, then the hump will be over and by next August big profits enjoyed. So, basically, there's no bad news. Just a choice as to how you play it. For me, my finger is on the trigger. Ill dump it all at 33 and buy back when the fog has lifted. And that's the latest from Lake Woebegone. Good luck."
return $50 next week
"Just bought in a Large All In position over the last 3 trading days, very excited about the future with STNE."
we are below IPO price lol
uh oh. 30?
fomo for everyone now trying to get back
What gives? This is sinking fast
"Green by the end of today, have a little faith"
just dumped 2500 shares on expecting crumby report. I'll buy the dip. good luck
Just opened a position with 3 k stocks! It is long term bet though!
"not to brag, but I'm now only down less than 20k on my stne position"
"First green day in like 2 straight weeks? A much appreciated breather, hopefully starting to rebound soon!"
This is weird...a day where we don't make a new 52 week low. I forgot there were days like this.
"so weird that STNE moves with the Dow. But just gonna buy the dip.3rd qtr when Linx pops revenues up like a big dog, I'll ride my now 5500 shares to 62 and bank 110k...unless, of course, i buy more. which is probable. Just oozing to the 78 middle mark the 16 analysts still support will bank 116k. sure, oozing back to the high of 97 will take both investor confidence and 18 months of solid numbers but imho with linx, settling credit biz and covid impact reduction, all acclaimed no brainers in the next year or so, the 100 the analysts still project is simply going to happen. By then I'll pump up to 7500 shares and poof! Baby got bank!Good luck serious longs."

I'm slowly starting to question if buying at $75 in January was a smart decision.
kind of wonder if this is stop loss hunting to enable some institutions to get in.
"Other than the recent, and brief and limited, stumble due to a very esoteric local regulatory issue about credit, which the company quickly addressed, I'm having a hard time seeing anything wrong with STNE. (Yeah, yeah, covid, brazil, etc.) It has completely reasonable P/S and P/E ratios. From the last conference call, it sounded like the company might even have over-reserved for potential impact of the credit issue, so those reserves could be released back to earnings. (Maybe?) I wonder if the recent price drop was due to some fund rotating out for unrelated reasons."
Zack‘s investment has a sell Signal on STNE! That doesn’t surprise me none about Zack’s They always had a sell signal on this.￼￼￼ ￼I never new why
"Getting tempting to jump back in. Bought in the $40’s, sold in the $60’s before it went to $90’s, was kicking myself. Turned out to be an OK choice"
Oh Lawdy! STNE is 40!!!
That's the third bounce in this range. Let's see if support holds and which way the volume breaks to close the day

"$STNE should have a major rebound quarter in Q3, resolving their credit lending issues, will cause stock to spike. Great time to add/buy."
Trying to maintain same sentiment !
"Winding up quickly, looks like 25$ very soon. Hard to accept"
A big down day in the overall market and STNE drops 8-10%. Not an issue if you are holding L/T and on the way to a better buying opportunity in the 20's. The folks who have bought with Margin will continue to depress this until we get past the credit issue and then will see a steady upward path. I'm adding between 25-30.
pls.. no more new bottom...
$60 after earnings report

"once this get's down back to the IPO price, I am buying!"
Stock is following Brazilian Real / USD movements… until a bigger catalyst for the company comes about.
"wow up 11%. Be careful though, jump it at pull back safer."
Just go to zero already!! Quit messing with people!

"Anyone else see this and hope this helps this stock since it's been a complete dog the past several months. UPDATE 3-SoftBank-backed Banco Inter and StoneCo in talks on potential merger -source2:52 PM ET 9/24/21 | ReutersUPDATE 3-SoftBank-backed Banco Inter and StoneCo in talks on potential merger -source(Adds details on losses, updates shares)By Carolina MandlSAO PAULO, Sept 24 (Reuters) - SoftBank-backed digital lender Banco Inter SA and payments company StoneCo Ltd are in preliminary talks to expand a current partnership agreement, including a potential merger, one source familiar with the matter said.StoneCo acquired a 4.99% stake in Banco Inter in June, as part of a strategy of attracting the bank's clients to its payments services.The talks are the latest sign of stepped-up dealmaking involving a new breed of financial companies that have emerged as rivals to Brazil's once-dominant traditional lenders.The current talks come as StoneCo faced a 400-million-real ($75 million) loss in its newly-launched lending operation due to higher provisions.If StoneCo and Banco Inter agreed on a merger, it would create a financial institutional with a market capitalization of roughly $22 billion.Both U.S.-listed Stoneco, which has a market value of $12.5 billion, and Banco Inter, with a $9.8 billion market cap, said they do not comment on rumors.Under their existing partnership, Inter offers Stone's processing services to its clients and merchants who use Stone to process credit and debit cards are being offered connections to Inter's nascent online marketplace. It was unclear what a deeper partnership absent a merger might involve.Brazilian newspaper Valor Economico reported earlier on Friday on the talks.Shares in Banco Inter were up 0.8% in early afternoon trading, after rising more than 4%, while shares in StoneCo were up 0.1%.($1 = 5.3365 reais) (Reporting by Carolina Mandl, additional reporting by Tatiana Bautzer; Editing by Emelia Sithole-Matarise and Nick Zieminski)"
"if hedge funds buying STNE, why this stock going down??!!!"
"Picked up 2000 shares, at 34 and change last week. Feeling pretty good about where we go from here - barring a total implosion of global markets."
Near term this is quite risky - next report can be a dud or could outperform if the credit issues are resolved and the Linx revenue start picking up. SQ's PE value is 5x STNE so there is potential for a run if the numbers are good.
The chart looks good can see $50s within weeks
Management will have a stellar performance when they report Q3 numbers in the last wk of October 2021.
this is starting to look interesting

"Steve Mandel just bought 7,000,000 more shares based up his September 9th filing bringing his total up to 15MM+ With a basis of roughly $67, I'll put my money where Lone Pine Capital puts their money. I'll see you all back in the $60's."
"Feel that? Oh Lordy, STNE is gonna be 40!"

"I think we reached the bottom, but market condition doesn't help this stock to break out"
"Shareholders getting fleeced, Christ. If you are still holding, ask yourself … why?"
Why does yahoo fiance give a 3rd quarter date of October 27? I thought the earnings report was supposed to come out on November 4.
"squeeze, bounce will be hard"
63% off from its high and still wnats to move lower. STNE will hit $29 before any meaningful move up. STNE's decline is not yet over even with a 63% loss from its high...
"Hard to time the bottom, but with this steady growing volume last few days smells like a reversal heading into ER."
"Ggggreat time to enter , won’t go much lower could go to $80 in a year. Could get bought up to."
They had some interesting insights about STNE on (http://Multistockalerts.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
What date are 3rd qtr numbers released?
Can anyone explain why it went down in the first place?
Yeow. 20s are a reality. Just think how much we will make when 3rd and 4th qtrs show upswing and Linx pops revenues. Beuler? Beuler?
What caused the recent major drop in price?. Anyone?
"Okaaay and what are Q3 numers gonna be? no idea, inter stock is down, how credit revenue was 300 million + on a 2000 million credit portfolio is a mystery to me. Are the clients paying 15% interest on yearly basis?"
Look at PAGS
"Lol no wonder people don’t make any money in the stock market. They buy and sell at wrong times. Good company, could go well over 100B market cap in 5 years."
"Up on high volume, a great indicator that we might have hit the bottom on Oct 11. Happy Friday and have a a great weekend everyone."
"I really do hope we have finally bottomed out, but this really needs more buyers, 2% rebound during a super green day like this is still not ideal. But I'm hopeful for its long term outlook for being the biggest market in South America!"
These guys still in business or what?
Q3 date?

Berkshire Hathaway backed Nubank news is killing STNE and PAGS - (IPO valuation aimed at $55B)
Buying in to Banco Inter is a good thing…when they IPO next year STNE will get shares at a Nice price Mr. Buffett and I are very Long term bullish on this one

"Increased my position last night. Own 532@51.30. I know the swings, but why such drop today, who is selling? I mean I am not levered so, can wait it out and won’t sell, just trying to understand the reason behind such drop, today. Is it hitting stops?"
Few Reasons to buy STNE (for anyone new) :If you want to Invest in emerging market / Developing countryBrazil #$%$ and e-commerce market will likely have hyper growth (5% to 50% in 5 years) Brazil banking sector is one of the highly profitable compared to USA or Canada or any. Stone Co have a good base and potentially can tap into Hyper growth STNE business agreement with Linx is a big deal Moreover STNE is in over sold territoryDD Summary: Can this go wrong? Definitely Yes! But if succeed the reward will be huge!
She's dropping her drawers! Buying opportunity between 20-25!!!
why zacks expected Q3 Earnings to decline......????

Nu bank is mainly for consumers not like stne as shop of Brazil for small business. Anyone has more on unbanked?
The death spiral continues.
Start of reversal. Need another week to round out.
"Dissapointing quarter mostly due to credit mistakes, which service they already tuned down to almost none in july. Excluding that part, revenge grew 68% you which is amazing. Since the negative business part has been tuned down, it means that from now the revenue and earnings for next quarter will improve massively. With current valuation a great buy."
Just bought in @ 32.96$ Hope credit issue will be solved soon so it can be priced in again. GL All

does anyone have a sell price?
