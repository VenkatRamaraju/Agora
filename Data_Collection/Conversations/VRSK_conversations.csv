"Time for regime change? Several billion in shareholder value destroyed by current Chairmanâ€™s diversification error into health care and energy. He should have doubled down into broadening exposure to global insurance markets with deeper data and SAAS services. Time for Carlyle, Ackerman and Icahn to become active."

So why Mr. Buffet publish what he did??? This is really bad
overvalued ..
Acquisition of GWRE would be a great strategic fit for both companies and both sets of shareholders Probably to0 big and bold for current CEO of VRSK. However he retires soon and new CFO might be up to the challenge when he moves up to CEO. Board will need some refreshing also.
awesome company.
buffet sold 80% for 300% gain?

"Yahoo Finance shows each of the last 4 quarters of earnings over a buck, and 2019 and 2020 EPS estimates of 4.37 and 4.86, but somehow lists ttm earnings of 2.79? Earnings are good and growing nicely, with a reasonable P/E ratio not reflected in the erroneous summary shown here in the stock quote."

"As VRSK and GWRE increasingly work together, both developing increased analytics and deploying artificial intelligence to help their common insurance company customers process data it becomes strategically possible that VRSK should acquire GWRE. One might argue that VRSK deals in healthcare ad energy were diversions, distractions and or held back shareholder value accretion. VRSK current management prefers smaller deals and proably does no have risk profile to step up and acquier GWRE. New VRSK CFO is a huge improvement and step up in skills set and experience in my humble opinion. He know the right thing to do. Maybe as VRSK management evolves in the next few years this strategic deal will get done for benefit of all."
