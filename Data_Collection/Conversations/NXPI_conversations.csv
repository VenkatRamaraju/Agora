The SEC should investigate these insider sells. ZERO chance the CFO sells that many shares (nearly all of them) direct without knowing something considered insider information. The CEO....still a lot of shares but a small percentage of his holdings
"Qualcomm in last minute talks on NXP deal in China, Dealreporter says Qualcomm (QCOM) representatives have been in last minute talks with Chinese officials as it seeks to secure approval for its planned purchase of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), with China's State Administration for Market Regulation, or SAMR, said to have been taking part in the discussions, said Dealreporter, according to contacts.

Just a correction. Great company/overpriced. PE of over 50x vs TSM at 28x.
ZTE is expected to deposit $400 million is an escrow account in a US bank in the next couple of days. This is the last step the chinese company must take before a ban on US suppliers can be lifted. As per a US Dept of Commerce official told Reuters
"Chips and Media are up on the news of Samsung Electronics' acquisition of NXP.Chips and Media in the KOSDAQ market are trading at 8210 won, up 1680 points, 1180 won, 16.79 percent higher than the day before at 9:07 am.According to media reports, Samsung Electronics is considering the acquisition of NXP, a global automotive semiconductor company.Samsung Electronics has put the battlefield sector as a future food source, and has been working on a very large semiconductor company since last year. As a result, NXP, one of the world's top semiconductor companies, has been ranked as the most likely buyer. When M & A takes place, it is expected to reach a maximum of 50 trillion won.Samsung Electronics said, ""There is nothing to confirm for this M & A.""Chips and Media is a semiconductor Intellectual Property (IP) specialist that performs certain functions by being embedded in semiconductor chips. NXP is a client company. hoan@newspim.com"
"I have stated my prediction last week. This deal will be held hostage by the Chinese for a while. In the mean time, it will be played by the street with news and upgrading, downgrading. Just play with it. Get in when they push price down and get out when you are happy with the gain. Eventually, I predict that it will get approved. Good luck to all."
"Morgan Stanley says odds rising of NXP walking away if China won't approve deal Morgan Stanley analyst Craig Hettenbach said that he, and colleague James Faucette who covers Qualcomm (QCOM) at the firm, agree that closing their deal is the best path forward for both NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) and Qualcomm. However, given that the merger agreement expires in 9 days and U.S. China trade relations have taken an ""uncertain turn,"" he thinks that the odds of NXP walking away and collecting a $2B break fee have increased if China does not approve the deal. Hettenbach sees 18% upside to the $127.50 takeout price and 14% downside to the $92 level of support he has previously identified in the event of a deal break and maintains an Equal Weight rating on NXP shares.Read more at: https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=2758434"
So why no recent word on ZTE and the $400 million escrow account? Shouldn’t that deposit have been made by now?

"Anybody else see this?""After unsuccessfully appealing a verdict, Intel will fork over $2 billion to VLSI Technology LLC.  In March, jurors found Intel guilty of patent infringement. The two violations cost $1.5 billion and $675 million, and they’ll be awarded to NXP Semiconductors (owner of VLSI).Intel attempted to toss the jury verdict, claiming the jury “was tainted by erroneous jury instructions and evidentiary rulings.” Intel’s strategy was unsuccessful. According to Intel, the verdict is the second-largest jury ruling in a patent case. The other three-largest verdicts were ultimately vacated.The company has been engaged in a legal campaign with VLSI. In April, a jury ruled in Intel’s favor regarding a separate infringement suit.Unfortunately for Intel, the company will be writing a big check in its near-future. """
let's have a contest. what is the opening price tomorrow? I say $120.
Stock is up because Thursday in China (tonight our time) is the weekly scheduled MOFCOM press conference. People want to be in this ticker tonight in the event good news is announced. If no news comes out on the deal at the press conference it will retreat back.
"don't worry about $TXN slow down. It is exposed to several categories, like analog chips, which already weren't growing. $MCHP $ADI $NXPI."

"By Mathieu Rosemain, Michel Rose and Foo Yun CheePARIS/BRUSSELS (Reuters) -The European Union is considering creating a semiconductor alliance including STMicroelectronics, NXP, Infineon and ASML to cut dependence on foreign chipmakers amid a global supply chain crunch, four EU officials said. The plan, which is at a very preliminary stage, may include a pan-European scheme known as an Important Project of Common European Interest (IPCEI), which allows EU governments to pump in funding under easier state aid rules, and companies to work together on the entire project, the sources said. It would complement or come as an alternative to a possible foreign-funded factory, with the aim to double the EU's market share in semiconductors to 20% by 2030, a target set out by European internal market chief Thierry Breton.The EU Commissioner, who is seeking to persuade a leading chipmaker to site a major fabrication plant in the bloc, is due to meet Intel(INTC) CEO Pat Gelsinger on Friday. He will also hold a video conference with Maria Marced, President of TSMC Europe."
"Cramer ob CNBC: ""I think that's a pretty compelling argument,"" Cramer said. ""Let's not forget that while NXP is a $95 stock, Qualcomm was willing to pay $127.50 per share for the whole enchilada. In other words, the folks who run Qualcomm — real smart people — thought NXP was worth $32 more than where it's currently trading."""
The deal will be approved 10 minutes after I throw in the towel and sell my NXPI shares. Guaranteed.
"The Chinese culture encourages one to accept compromise and engineer positive outcome without creating a deteriorating situation. This is why in China, stability is valued above all else, including freedom and human right. With this in mind it is almost certain the deal gets approved. The Chinese would not risk creating a deteriorating situation after ZTE was saved so publicly. They have literally nothing to gain by rejecting the deal."
"This is going up on rumors that Samsung will acquire NXPI. Given the price of NVDA and the hurdles with regulatory approval and now with each country sees semi as strategic industry, hard to see Europe have Korea take one of their prized strategic possession. But that doesn't mean share price may stop going up as Prince once said you need to dance until fed's music is on."
"After Elliott sold shares of NXP in May, Elliott is now holding less than 5% ownership. He can sell or exit his position in nxp completely without public notice. I think he did that to give him the flexibility to sell nxp at any point. I wouldn't be greedy for another $5. I have sold my position this morning at $122. Will get back in if it pulls back to $111. Otherwise, I would miss $5. But, it's ok. I already have cashed in my profit for sure. Good luck guys."
"How would China look if 8 already approved and China is the only one doesn't. ""The U.S. chipmaker has already received approval from eight of nine required global regulators to finalize the acquisition, with Chinese clearance the only one pending."""
