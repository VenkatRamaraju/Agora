No News Big Drop. Someone Knows Something!
let's have a contest. what is the opening price tomorrow? I say $120.
"Announcement will be made on Monday...I will call my broker and tender may shares, including shareds loaded today...Meanwhile, enjoy your weekend everyone, longs and shorts alike..."
7 21ST Q be
"The two companies have extended their agreement until July 25 at 11:59 p.m. New York time, Qualcomm said in a statement early Thursday. If they haven’t obtained Chinese sign-off by then, Qualcomm will pay NXP the previously agreed termination fee of $2 billion, scrapping the more than $40 billion deal, which has been pending for almost 18 months."
According to South China Morning Post 7/2/18 ZTE is guaranteed a reprieve by the US after Congressional ok. NXPI should get approval soon.
"This rumor seems to have some legs.""According to South Korean investing site Invest Chosun, local tech giant Samsung (NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) was thinking about a buyout bid for NXP. ""Since NXP has reduced share count by 20% with average cost around 90, the buyout offer would be more than 110/share. I think offer of 120 will get the deal done. Because Samsung and NXP are not dominating in the same market segment, the regulatory approval will be much simpler. We will probably see NXP run up to 100 before any official announcement."
"I feel like I have read this one right all along. What remains is a last minute approval by China. That will be the olive branch that gets discussions moving on trade differences. Do you find the timing of the congressional announcement to back off of ZTE, just a little too perfect? The Donald needs a win on trade before the mid terms and Xi PingChina will accommodate him without looking too weak t"
"Congrats longs, at least the ones who persevered and waited this out after the Qualcomm debacle. I had long ago sold around $122 when the buyout price was raised. I then got back in after the deal was cancelled due to the Chinese delays and the stock sunk under $100, I didn't buy it at the lows, but my average cost was around $95 on my second go around. We all discussed at the time how this was a $130 stock, and today that finally occurred. I am now looking to exit my position, probably before the weekend. I'm sure there's more room to run, but my goal for this stock has been achieved and it's always nice to get a little dry powder for use in the future.Good luck to the longs!"
"About 53million shares will be bought with the $5B buyback. With 350 million shares outstanding, it will be quite accretive."
Just a correction. Great company/overpriced. PE of over 50x vs TSM at 28x.
"WASHINGTON, July 19 (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers have reached an agreement that puts a measure to strengthen oversight of foreign investment from countries such as China into a must-pass defense policy bill, Representative Robert Pittenger's office said on Thursday.The goal of the measure is to strengthen the inter-agency U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment (CFIUS), which reviews mergers and stock purchases to ensure they do not harm national security.It also addresses concerns that Chinese companies, many with government links, have tried to buy U.S. high end semiconductor makers and other tech firms. The U.S. Defense Department fears losing America's technological edge in warfare.Pittenger, a Republican congressman from North Carolina and chief sponsor of the measure in the House, said in a statement that the ""legislation will safeguard America’s proprietary dual-use technologies by drastically improving our foreign investment review process.""He gave no details on what changes might have been made to the measure.The Senate and U.S. House of Representatives had passed similar bills to strengthen the inter-agency panel, which is led by the U.S. Treasury. The Senate put its version in the must-pass National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, which authorizes military spending.Lawmakers hope to have the NDAA on President Donald Trump's desk by the end of the month.The CFIUS measures are among a series of proposals being considered by the White House and Congress to address what it sees as China's unfair trade and market access practices. Others include tariffs on goods ranging from aluminum to automobiles, and efforts to prevent the growth in the United States of Chinese telecommunications companies Huawei Technologies Co and ZTE Corp."
"There is a good chance it is now trading on true value. The premium for a deal that most likely won't happen has pretty much evaporated. Calls for this stock to drop into the $90's, such as Cramer, are more wishful thinking than reality as actual value for the stock is probably $10 to $15 above the current value. Hence it is already at the discount from the deal falling apart."
The deal will be approved 10 minutes after I throw in the towel and sell my NXPI shares. Guaranteed.
I find this interesting coming from a China newspaper https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy-defence/article/2154975/china-under-pressure-live-open-market-pledges-us-calls
"I think the risk reward at this level is very compelling.Many things have been said and do not forget the article from SCMP last month saying the deal was approved.Obviously the Chinese are holding it back as a bargaining currency BUT tariffs and antitrust are two different things. China is bound to grow and prone to buy Western assets in the future. Should they deny the merger, they will face same behaviour from antitrust bodies in EU and in the US. Not sure they want it. They will approve it for sure.QCOM is threatening to walk away to put pressure on them but it is a done deal a great return for a 10 day investment."
"Cramer ob CNBC: ""I think that's a pretty compelling argument,"" Cramer said. ""Let's not forget that while NXP is a $95 stock, Qualcomm was willing to pay $127.50 per share for the whole enchilada. In other words, the folks who run Qualcomm — real smart people — thought NXP was worth $32 more than where it's currently trading."""
Usually M&A announcements happen on Monday. Will we get that good news this Monday? I am so tired of riding this roller coaster.
Bottom line - this deal ultimately gets approval. Don't know when but there is too much to lose for both US/China to escalate a trade spat using an M&A transaction as hostage that the rest of the world has already approved. It's simple really. Don't overthink it.
"The longs are finally being rewarded. I held through the QCOM debacle and doubled down last year during the March pandemic crash. The great future for this stock is in a few numbers. Only 1.27% short interest. 96% of float owned by institutions. $2B Share buyback about to retire 5% of float. Entering S&P 500. Oh, yeah, raised dividend 50%."
"I have stated my prediction last week. This deal will be held hostage by the Chinese for a while. In the mean time, it will be played by the street with news and upgrading, downgrading. Just play with it. Get in when they push price down and get out when you are happy with the gain. Eventually, I predict that it will get approved. Good luck to all."
"Big drop, it looks like someone might know something big."
"This is going up on rumors that Samsung will acquire NXPI. Given the price of NVDA and the hurdles with regulatory approval and now with each country sees semi as strategic industry, hard to see Europe have Korea take one of their prized strategic possession. But that doesn't mean share price may stop going up as Prince once said you need to dance until fed's music is on."
It’s 8:30 am in China right now. Tick tock... tick tock....
The real question for NXPI longs...After selling next tues-wed for 125... what’s the next stock to be in that’s going to make us $25 a share like this did?
New CEO of ZTE met with Commerce Department officials ZTE meets with US officials to work out final details of compliance dealhttps://sc.mp/2m9lsE4
"Yesterday Cramer recommended NXPI a couple of weeks ago as being undervalued at around $95 only to say stay away til $85-$86, which is where it should be valued. What gives?"
"An interesting Chinese article. A Chinese angle, more interesting than all the articles you can find on US medias.Use Google translate unless you are fluent in Chinese.This is supportive in my opinion for the approval.Would probably buy some more tomorrowhttp://biz.jrj.com.cn/2018/07/22093524846473.shtml"
So why no recent word on ZTE and the $400 million escrow account? Shouldn’t that deposit have been made by now?
Maybe Xi decides to pass this in in the hopes it generates good will. It costs him nothing really and there are a lot more tariffs we can put on China than they can impose on us.
Mark this post news will be released after bell or most likely late Sunday that China has finalized review and agreed to let merger go through. It is all posturing.
"QCOM should extend the offer if necessary. Don’t let China off the hook by letting the clock run down. Let them either approve or disapprove, the US will react accordingly."
"I re-read the Conference call notes regarding share buy back. It said they don't exactly advertise exact time period of the buy back, but they watch the market every day and make buy decisions. They also said they will complete the purchase in the reasonable near term (I am paraphrasing). The stock has a market cap of 31 Billion according to Yahoo database. 5 billion is almost 1/6 of the outstanding value. so every 6 shares become 5 shares. this means by definition the current $90 share becomes (90*6/5) which is $108/shr... So do NOT be frightened out of this stock by Hedge & arbitration related sell-off. All of us LONGS are like to make money on this one. All you SHORTS, be Afraid, VERY afraid."
Is QCOM walking away from NXPI deal? And will NXPI miss tonight? This stock could be 15% lower tomorrow morning...
Chinese regulators approve QCOM purchase of NXPI for 44 Billion as per Reuters
"hmmm... might be a good day to add... Really, its all just noise. This deal gets done in the end:)"
MOFCOM approved this merger awhile ago with some behavioral remedies. It does not have political approval thus no announcement. Congress removing ZTE death language (100% political approval from the US) is timely BUT may not be enough if Xi Jin Ping's mindset is more combative and hard line. I don't think it is as they have given direct orders to not inflame nationalist sentiment and anti American rhetoric and are organizing a Camp David like policy meeting of critical Chinese thinkers. China political approval is what remains. It would be a very visible tit for tat olive branch for Trump if they approve the merger. We'll know by Wednesday.
Now what? Call my broker and tender my shares?
"reading between the lines - with ceo selling big chunk signals to the market that Samsung is not buying NXPI. when semis crash, this will go to QCOM offer price of $127"
Today's price action makes no sense at all.
$QCOM Here is an idea/open question: Do you think $AVGO can pull some strings and delay approval from China in $NXPI deal now? I think so.
This is a very good sign. I'm sure we will be up well on Monday. https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china/u-s-china-agree-to-increased-trade-cooperation-idUSKCN1IK0PM
The SEC should investigate these insider sells. ZERO chance the CFO sells that many shares (nearly all of them) direct without knowing something considered insider information. The CEO....still a lot of shares but a small percentage of his holdings
"I'm just wondering - if I want to tender my stocks, how would I need to do so? I don't have a lot of NXP stocks, but out of curiosity, I have no idea on the process. Do I just set a sell price on my stocks?"
"A couple of years ago, the Humana buyout was priced at around $200. Analysts said if the deal failed, it would fall back to $160s - today it's $320, and it never dropped a dime when the merger failed. I'm not saying NXP is the same, but I am saying that NXP is very undervalued compared to its peer group, with an AAA + rating in relevance and growth. If the deal fails, its rise from that point over the next couple of years will be parabolic - very soon back over $115 before whatever follows. The single caveat - a market wipeout over tariff wars."
the deal not happening because of China is a non event. Both QCOM and NXPI will do fine. QCOM has been under priced for 3 years and it will do well without NXPI over the next 30 months. NXPI wil also be a decent investment looking out 30 months. QCOM wil in fact see an immediate share price increase while NXPI will also see a share price increase but it will happen over 90 days. look at share prices at end of year and compare to today. both will be up instead of down. the non approval had little impact.
The game will be over on Monday morning when NXPI reaches $127.50 after the weekend approval.
"Here's the reality of the Qualcomm/NXP deal: Its already done. The administration is holding off on the announcement until Saturday/Sunday when Wilbur Ross will be in China for the trade talks. It's purely a staged photo opp at this point and Trump, ever the showman, is orchestrating credit for himself and his administration. Mark my post - Saturday or Sunday."
I hear from my D.C. source. nxpi buyout by qcom is a done deal. China will announce over the weekend.
"Wow, page four of Qualcomm’s release “if events occur that cause us not to terminate the transaction, we will continue to pursue the acquisition of all of the issues and outstanding shares of NXP”"

NXPI hits new high at $223.35!
"I keep thinking about something that @Johnnywvw54 first brought up on this board. Usually NXPI posts that they will be releasing earnings 2-3 weeks before they released it. Right now, no PR about earnings release. He might be on to something."
Wondering how Elliott is feeling since days with NXP maagement and his 3.5% stake. Time for him to shake out.

"How would China look if 8 already approved and China is the only one doesn't. ""The U.S. chipmaker has already received approval from eight of nine required global regulators to finalize the acquisition, with Chinese clearance the only one pending."""
NXPI merger is closely tied to ZTE's ban. I think today's news on ZTE is significant. ZTE should be able to deposit 400 million into the escrow account quickly and the ban will be lifted as soon as Friday. NXPI merger is likely to be approved over the weekend. It is probably a good time to go all in tomorrow to profit from this merger.
Q3 results are out 2.45 billion revenues inline Q4 flat with Q3 bought back 49 million shares for 4.58 billion or $94.46 per share!More buyback of 15 million more shares.Stock is cheap under $80.Where it goes I don't know.Not a huge blow out but what was the street really expecting?No original guidance that is for sure. And Q4 is as strong as Q3 guidance and Q3 actual. Stock should go up.
"Guys, I think this deal will get done. US-China don't want to escalate the trade tension to the next level. The two countries leaders understand that trade war doesn't benefit anyone. The trade tension has already wiped out billions of dollars from both countered economy. Good news on the trade talks will come out soon, maybe next week."
The Chinese government will not approve the merger until the pending United States Senate Bill which includes a provision to reinstate all sanctions against ZTE is amended to strike that provision.
Latest tender expires tomorrow. It will be interesting to see if it falls even farther.
"How credible is the article from seekingalpha ""A revenue valuation model computes that NXPI should be valued around $124-138. An earnings model suggests that NXPI should be valued around $110-146.Along with a free cash flow model of $110-127, the combined $110-146 target price range would indicate that NXPI at $95 is seriously undervalued."""
34 minutes ago. WSJ article. MofCom will approve early as Monday
"Looking good for Monday... we just need to get through the Sunday morning tweet and news cycle without anyone blowing the agreement out of the water... I imagine if MOFCOM gives the thumbs up, Qcom will immediately move to complete the tender... good luck all!"

"from SCMP via bloomberg......China has no plan to target U.S. companies operating in the nation amid escalating trade tensions, as that would run counter to Beijing’s goal of attracting foreign investments, South China Morning Post reported on Sunday, citing unidentified people.The policy makers sought to reassure foreign businesses in China amid fears that the Beijing government would retaliate for U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposed tariffs on Chinese goods by harassing American firms or depriving them of commercial opportunities, the Hong Kong-based newspaper reported, citing ""two Chinese government sources."" The option of targeting these business ""has never been on the cards,"" according to one of the people....If this is true, what has taken Beijing so long to approve QCOM/NXPI merger?"
Why are we still trading $20 below the $127.50? Shouldn’t the spread be much tighter if the deal closure was so imminent? Something just doesn’t seem right.
ZTE is expected to deposit $400 million is an escrow account in a US bank in the next couple of days. This is the last step the chinese company must take before a ban on US suppliers can be lifted. As per a US Dept of Commerce official told Reuters

We will take out ur 52 week high on Monday!
I have come to the same conclusion that NXPI is worth about 115 on its own. It will fall hard if deal falls out. But it will rally and move higher over the next few months. Of course a general market meltdown could occur and then all bets are off. But personally... I still think the deal gets done. Wishful thinking I know.
Are we having a merger Monday?

"After Elliott sold shares of NXP in May, Elliott is now holding less than 5% ownership. He can sell or exit his position in nxp completely without public notice. I think he did that to give him the flexibility to sell nxp at any point. I wouldn't be greedy for another $5. I have sold my position this morning at $122. Will get back in if it pulls back to $111. Otherwise, I would miss $5. But, it's ok. I already have cashed in my profit for sure. Good luck guys."
"Hello, I’m new on this board. I’ve been combing through SEC filings/financials and don’t see why it’s trading so much lower. It appears NXPI has retraced to 2016 levels due to the terminated offer while continuing to produce good numbers. It is also expected to receive a 2 billion dollar settlement from this rescinded offer. What am I missing? Thanks in advance."

US signs escrow agreement with ZTE!!
"Marvell deal to acquire Cavium only serves to reinforce claim that NXPI tender offer price is insufficient. Great to have another comparison for 2017 semi deals, alongside the Analog Devices/Linear Tech deal done in the spring. NXPI at $110 would be a new trading floor in the pps if the deal falls apart. These shares would be worth more on their own if QCOM is unwilling to budge a provide a reasonable premium. Maybe it was reasonable to the public in October 2016 but the clouds have parted and it is clear to us that this company is more valuable than $110 moving forward."
couldn't resist any longer. Took a small position this morning.
"2.4% tendered shares. Another extension, and decline."
"scmp changed wording in their website on the issue. I think the following is actually true: “While the antitrust issue has been resolved, the sources say timing is not clear on when Mofcom/SAMR will make the announcement, which may depend on other factors including progress in ongoing negotiations with Washington over outstanding trade issues.”"
"Is a question of time when $QCOM will get approval from China In regards of $NXPI after Trump’s tweet about ZTE today. Now imagine NXP , Apple and Huawei behind us. ;-)"
"The German Chemical plant in China would be 100% German owned - a first. China also just approved BMW being able to up its ownership of China BMW assets to 75% - controlling interest, another first is China. China is moving in the direction Trumps wants them to - no more tech transfer JV's, true open borders that allow unfairly treated foreign investment. And oh, stop stealing IP. They have also barred since last month referral Made in China 2025 (published in 2015) as it's the principal incendiary for Trump's lashing - read Navarro's writings about China, its eye opening. The net is China's state run industrial policy and mercantilism policies is unfair and won't be tolerated. So, back to NXPI, it's a coin toss for me by the 25th. Toshiba, Cavium and one other were approved over the last couple months. And while I'd like to think that saving ZTE would curry some near kind positive action, it quite possibly will not until the death clause is removed from the DOD funding bill. That language should be sorted out by the end of the month. Will QCOM actually walk on the 25th if MOFCOM is still silent? I don't expect a denial, just silence. the waiting continues...."
Stock is up because Thursday in China (tonight our time) is the weekly scheduled MOFCOM press conference. People want to be in this ticker tonight in the event good news is announced. If no news comes out on the deal at the press conference it will retreat back.

"Well 20+ months later, the roles sure have reversed. Qcom is more liked than nxp"
“Both chambers are expected to vote on the National Defense Authorization Act early next week.”
"The sham is how the Chinese are holding these two companies hostage for no legal reason. It is all political. That should not enter into this process. I believe in the short term NXPI will drop when QCOM is forced to walk away NXPI will probably drop, but will rebound quickly. It will be a buying opportunity. There will be a big buy back followed by offers from other companies. Don't get scared out. Buy more if it drops. Good luck."
"U. S. Market close on Monday. My guess is shorties probably dare not to keep this baby short over the weekend. We will see some nice green pop today after 2pm. Don't hold your breath on Monday announcement. But, it may happen on Tuesday."
We have just found the bottom according to my calcs. Let's see.
So what do you think the odds are that Qcom extends the offer another week.
NXPI is a stock that is much more likely to be $150/share in 6 months than at this current level. NXPI is deeply discounted and a bargain here to buy and hold for many years to come.
Tender offer extended another week.
"Qualcomm in last minute talks on NXP deal in China, Dealreporter says Qualcomm (QCOM) representatives have been in last minute talks with Chinese officials as it seeks to secure approval for its planned purchase of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), with China's State Administration for Market Regulation, or SAMR, said to have been taking part in the discussions, said Dealreporter, according to contacts. Details on the talks are not known, but Qualcomm is said to ""remain hopeful but uncertain,"" the report added, according to contacts.Read more at:https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=2762777"
This puppy is on its own now. NXP needs to release a statement in the morning with a plan moving forward and an immediate conference call.
"Chip shortage, Steller earning report, and multiple upgrades, yet price is down. Buying opportunity?"
"To ALL, yes I made amistake, deal is not extended."
Here’s one company’s opinion. Might be wishful thinking tho. https://www.fiercewireless.com/wireless/qualcomm-shouldn-t-walk-away-from-nxp-wall-street-firm-says
Looks like a deal with China is done....https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china/china-agrees-to-import-more-from-u-s-no-sign-of-200-billion-number-idUSKCN1IK0PM
The Chinese regulators just approved the CAVM - MRVL deal - NXPI should be next!
How this moves day by day means little other than an indication of how traders are viewing the likelihood of deal being done. It’s going to be 127 or 90 something... and we should know in the next 9 days. Fingers crossed for 127...
"By Mathieu Rosemain, Michel Rose and Foo Yun CheePARIS/BRUSSELS (Reuters) -The European Union is considering creating a semiconductor alliance including STMicroelectronics, NXP, Infineon and ASML to cut dependence on foreign chipmakers amid a global supply chain crunch, four EU officials said. The plan, which is at a very preliminary stage, may include a pan-European scheme known as an Important Project of Common European Interest (IPCEI), which allows EU governments to pump in funding under easier state aid rules, and companies to work together on the entire project, the sources said. It would complement or come as an alternative to a possible foreign-funded factory, with the aim to double the EU's market share in semiconductors to 20% by 2030, a target set out by European internal market chief Thierry Breton.The EU Commissioner, who is seeking to persuade a leading chipmaker to site a major fabrication plant in the bloc, is due to meet Intel(INTC) CEO Pat Gelsinger on Friday. He will also hold a video conference with Maria Marced, President of TSMC Europe."
What Is Levered Free Cash Flow (LFCF)? Levered free cash flow (LFCF) is the amount of money a company has left remaining after paying all of its financial obligations. LFCF is the amount of cash a company has after paying debts. Levered free cash flow is important because it is the amount of cash that a company can use to pay dividends and make investments in the business. Take a look at BROADCOM’s TTM Levered Free Cash Flow (LFCF) in comparison to peers:$AVGO = $11.88 Billion —> Note: BROADCOM $AVGO has more than twice the Levered Free Cash Flow than the closest competitor! (BULLISH)$QCOM = $5.04 Billion (ttm)$NXPI = $2.43 Billion (ttm)$MRVL = $1.41 Billion (ttm)$SWKS = $588.2 Million (ttm)STRONG BUY on $AVGO —> $11.88 Billion (ttm) in Levered Free Cash Flow —> FUNDAMENTAL STRENGTH —> SOLID AS A ROCK !!!
"the deal expired, blame game not instructive, there is no extending the deal, there is nothing left to approve as their is no deal to approve anymore, move on, NXPI is still a decent investment,"
"NXP has already committed $200 million, taken from the breakup fee, to offer incentives to entice the company's management team to stay for three years."
Any one any idea why the volume on this stock was 5X to 9X higher then normal53 million today (Friday the 19th)Someone bought a bunch of shares Or is part of the buy back Thanks
Accumulating below $95 . Expecting $125 in early 2019.
"Strange enough ZTE is stable, -2%, which can only mean they know (or believe) they are safe. If the share plunges than it is evident there is no deal. ZTE is dead if the QCOM-NXP merger is blocked."
"My take: The Chinese have approved QCOM purchase of NXPI, yes they are holding it up. But when they are sure ZTE settlement will not be blocked by Congress, they will release approval. Pres. Trump is trying to gut/change provision in Def Bill re ZTE, i would be amazed at this point if he doesn't have enough political clout to get it amended. Once he does QCOM approval is released."
"Anybody else see this?""After unsuccessfully appealing a verdict, Intel will fork over $2 billion to VLSI Technology LLC.  In March, jurors found Intel guilty of patent infringement. The two violations cost $1.5 billion and $675 million, and they’ll be awarded to NXP Semiconductors (owner of VLSI).Intel attempted to toss the jury verdict, claiming the jury “was tainted by erroneous jury instructions and evidentiary rulings.” Intel’s strategy was unsuccessful. According to Intel, the verdict is the second-largest jury ruling in a patent case. The other three-largest verdicts were ultimately vacated.The company has been engaged in a legal campaign with VLSI. In April, a jury ruled in Intel’s favor regarding a separate infringement suit.Unfortunately for Intel, the company will be writing a big check in its near-future. """
"So where is the guy that said it was done deal this weekend, it would be a photo-op, we would regret not buying, etc etc...This is why I halved my position at 115. Worried about Trump. Im still long, still believe in the deal, but we need to wait for more info/updates on ZTE. I may half it again, or I may buy more. Lets get some news first, not random pumpers making stuff up"
"NXPI got hit due to Malaysia COVID, and it’s manufactures there affected￼."
something is cooking
"The Chinese culture encourages one to accept compromise and engineer positive outcome without creating a deteriorating situation. This is why in China, stability is valued above all else, including freedom and human right. With this in mind it is almost certain the deal gets approved. The Chinese would not risk creating a deteriorating situation after ZTE was saved so publicly. They have literally nothing to gain by rejecting the deal."
"With or without approval, NXPI will be higher six months from now if not sooner. The company is leader in automative chips. I have no problem holding through Wednesday."
"I have opened a position here. While I think $MCHP is a better play for this particular cycle, this company seems to be better positioned long-term and cheaper than ADI + Maxim."
It's still $14.5 under the buyout price. The question is should we buy shares today?

"Morgan Stanley says odds rising of NXP walking away if China won't approve deal Morgan Stanley analyst Craig Hettenbach said that he, and colleague James Faucette who covers Qualcomm (QCOM) at the firm, agree that closing their deal is the best path forward for both NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) and Qualcomm. However, given that the merger agreement expires in 9 days and U.S. China trade relations have taken an ""uncertain turn,"" he thinks that the odds of NXP walking away and collecting a $2B break fee have increased if China does not approve the deal. Hettenbach sees 18% upside to the $127.50 takeout price and 14% downside to the $92 level of support he has previously identified in the event of a deal break and maintains an Equal Weight rating on NXP shares.Read more at: https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=2758434"
Excellent article on Bloomberg about this. Qcom needs to get serious about more $$ no way this goes @ $110.

"Lets see where we open and what Faber says in the morning. He always brings up NXP and he is the only one I ""trust"" at CNBC."
"If this deal is scuttled because of political failure, it will be a seminole event, representing a wholesale breakdown of China/USA trade. As Larry Kudlow said - if this deal, benign as it is, does not get done - it will be a pivotal moment in Chinese/US trade relations. And he's not tying it to ZTE - we probably know that's not true, but it will advisable to exit the markets if it doesn't get done. Trump has some kind of relationship with the execs at Qualcom and he's stubborn enough to get even tougher on China, especially after he has gone to some lengths to assist ZTE in staying viable."
"ON DJ newswire ""BEIJING OFFICIAL SAYS NXPI/QCOM LOOKING MORE OPTIMISTIC""still $17.50 per share in free money out there..."
"As of now, QCOM will get taken over by BCOM. Bid might be hostile in nature as today CNBC reported that for Dec 8th AGM Hock Tan has came up with a list of board directors replacing WHOLE OF QCOM board. QCOM+NXP deal happening has much lower probability right now.So all the NXPI investors who believes that it is worth more than $110/share without QCOM merger will soon get a chance to test their theories."
What happens if the deal is not consummated??Does NXP go up or down on its own merits??
"So we have no deal, but...A statement released Sunday by China’s official Xinhua News Agency said both sides achieved “concrete progress”Baby steps people... this will get done."
ZTE just sent filing that shares will resume trading June 13th
This company can't grow any further organically. Either it has to acquire something or be acquired.
This is a supply chain issue and nothing more.
Does anyone know what the timeline for the stock repurchase program looks like? I can't find it on the web.
"You really need to ask yourself, would you buy this stock at this price if the buyout were not in play. I would say yes as the stock has great potential going forward and could easily be over $150 in a year if it is not purchased. Therefore either way there is upside to this stock, either an immediate $127.5 or a potential for more in the future."
Remember the $5 bill stock buyback going on. Market cap is $32 bill. They will be buying on this drop. Buyback plus dividend is a good thing for share price longer term. Should attract more buyers.
"SAN DIEGO, June 8, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Qualcomm Incorporated (QCOM) today announced that Qualcomm River Holdings B.V., an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Qualcomm, has extended the offering period of its previously announced cash tender offer to purchase all of the outstanding common shares of NXP Semiconductors N.V. (NXPI). The tender offer is being made pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, dated as of October 27, 2016, by and between Qualcomm River Holdings B.V. and NXP, as amended (the ""Purchase Agreement""). The tender offer is now scheduled to expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on June 15, 2018, unless extended or earlier terminated, in either case pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement.This is a good news to NXPI holder, right?"
"Yeah, what's going on?"
"I wouldn't panic over the extension of the deal deadline to April. The deal was set to expire in mid-March and with QCOM yet to receive Chinese approval and up the offer, they need a reasonable window for the new offer to be digested and the tender to rise from ~1% of shares to 80%. Also, I see the MOUs QCOM announced in the past 24hrs. with Chinese companies as a move to ingratiate the firm with Chinese regulators. GL NXPI longs!"

Why would anybody tender a share for $110 when they can sell it immediately in the open market for $120 plus?
"From Clemmer interview in Dutch NRC newspaper: ""If we suffer form a dip in chip manufacturing, it's because of China, not because of declining smart phone sales; that's not really a surprise. That's why Qualcomm wanted to buy us: more opportunities ... not just in phones, but also in cars and the internet of things ....[in response to lower expectations from ASML and Intel:] Investors shouldn't confuse NXP's strategy with negative sentiments in other areas of chip manufacturing, thinks Clemmer. ""We sell to markets that are growing, no matter what happens."" [On China:] ""Half of our sales are in China. Luckily the trade war doesn't affect us because we are Dutch. We are not being penalized as U.S. companies are.""https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2019/01/25/nxp-zit-in-china-niet-meer-op-het-strafbankje-a3651775"
So what are the rumors regarding the deal today? If China blocks the deal then no breakup fees are paid to either company. QCOM has already stated that they would buy back their stock with the money that was meant for this merger...
Let me get this strait. The Chief Finacial Officer sold more than half his stake for 32 million.Yea...Ill pass...(for now)
"I think everyone should chill out. Elloit Management still owns 5.5% of the stock. QCOM keeps extending offer, say what you want about QCOM management, they are not dopes. Nor is Wilbur Ross or Pres. Trump. And I recall reading he or Ross specifically asked about QCOM when making the ZTE deal w/ the Chinese. So, I am not worried. Will it go down to wire, yes it will, but it gets approved, IMHO."
Apple just the latest tech company to call the bottom. We will cross 100 on NXPI in the next 4-5 trading days and continue higher...GLTA
"I believe the escrow deposit is now completed. They’ve been planning on doing it by EOD Monday all along. Look for some news by end of Day tomorrow about this.While it’s not an approval, I would expect this to provide us with the $4-$7 pop we’ve seen time and time again.My real hope is this makes people feel all this trade stuff is overdone"
"NXPI is still WAY undervalued. With a current PE of around 19...and you apply an industry verage of about a 30 PE and you get NXPI at around $285 per share, or somewhere around there. Even a more reasonable PE of 25 would get NXPI at about $240 per share. Incredible value even at its all time high"
How credible is this arbitrage firm who said today that the deal has 22% chance of approval?
"Well... no deal announced. So much for those ""sources"""
Just joined the NXPI party. Bought my first shares. I may be late to the party but given the future of the semiconductors over the next few years I'm firmly convinced the party is far from over.
Anyone tendering their shares before offer expires Friday? Most likely be extended unless we hear from China..who know's what up with that.... like a chess game. This may never be acquired by Qualcomm & not sure if this holds it price or increases as a stand alone..... I do not see Qualcomm ever raising the price with the overall situation unless a new buyer wants both.

"What a Friday! FED not to increase rate in 2019 by more than one time but lower employement being understood as a slowing economic growth (slowing does not mean recession), interest rate curves inverting but not relevant. Trade war fears when China Minister of Foreign Affairs stating China will immediately execute the agreement. Huawei is not linked to trade war but efforts to block Huawei and China technology hegemony (a case where US should ally with other countries). At this level of uncertainty and volatility (see VIX), algorythms are again creating a total chaos, disconnected from fundamentals"
"Answer to my question to NXPI IR (at least, it is still a company which answers promptly and politely: ""We do not comment on the trading trends in our stock price. Further, on July 26th, we issued both short and long term guidance; announced a $5B buyback, as well as the pace of the buyback. The Analyst Day on September 11th is aimed at providing insight to the underlying drivers of our long-term guidance."""
