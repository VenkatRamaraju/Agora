earnings beat or what?
XRAY is down -7.82% to 46.08
All the trend following analysts on the sell-side were pumping Align at its highs while panning XRAY at its lows. Is that the way to make money for clients?
XRAY is down -7.15% to 54.28
Looks like $40.00/sh. this week!
anyone buying down $9 today. New 52 week low.
This stock is coming down to $27 soon;By Christmas if it doesn’t get bought by a health insurance company or a merger with a competitor like Henry Schein.
Nice stock reaction to earnings report. Probably a fair amount of short covering.

"Beat both EPS and revs ... 82c vs 81c, 1.091B vs 1.06B"
Why this is not moving .... Everything up but this one.
"Imho, no holdings, I thought that my pricing XRAY at $42 about 8weeks ago was being overly generous. Prof marg -33% div <1% this won't be buy until it becomes a takeover target at about 33 by some health insurer. Target date appx Nov 2018, if not sooner."
The sell-side analysts missed the turn in positive fundamentals and now sit on their limp hold and neutral ratings
Anyone initiating a position here? I’m Thinking about it...

The last time I was in a Dental office it was like a used car high pressure sales setting selling all sorts of unneeded procedures. It looks like this is the future of Dentistry and the Dental industry.

XRAY has decent risk-reward given it is a market leader..risk is low $30s but stock can surge if there are positive signs..I'm long and will buy on weakness down to $37 and lower
Will this be priced in centavo's soon?
The best stocks are sometimes the ones with quiet message boards with the Street on the sidelines. I have been vocal here about the turn in fundamentals and now the stock is heading higher after a strong beat and raise. This is how you make money. Stock will be north of $60 in due time
So overvalued

$XRAY Target Raised by HC Wainwright Neutral USD 60 » USD 72 Target Raised by Robert W Baird Outperform USD 71 » USD 78
Blog contributor Landis advised buying XRAY about 22 days ago at about $46. I questioned his metrics (and motivation) then. (No response) I thought at the time that $42 was an overly generous bid. Still waiting for my metrics to make this a buy for me.
