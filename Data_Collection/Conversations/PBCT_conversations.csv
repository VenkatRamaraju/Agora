People's United Financial is up 4.95% to 18.65
"So my 300 shares become 35 shares, and my div yield gets reduced from 4.5% to 2.9%."
"The FED 2020 bank stress test results are being released tomorrow Thurs 06/25/2020 at approx 4:30 PM EST.This year's test applies to USA banks with over $100 billion in assets under management - 34 banks. PBCT is not one of these banks, they have $58 billion in assets.It will be interesting to see how the large banks fare with these stress tests, as it will be an indication of overall small/medium bank health,especially in the ability of the bank to pay future dividends during the next few quarters of loan defaults/extensions. I'm thinking that you need to look at a bank's estimated Q2 earnings per share & see if it exceeds the quarterly dividend payment. If it does not, the dividend is in jeopardy."
"PBCT Q3 earnings were very mediocre. The MTB-PBCT acquisition seems to be one that will primarily be driven by cost savings, not new business/growth. I'm out of PBCT today at 18.75. It's been a nice ride. Good luck to all who are long & proceeding with the MTB conversion."
"Yesterday’s American Banker had some deets on how the deal came together:For M&T, the decision to buy People’s United is more about the markets the seller entered and the businesses it nurtured, such as equipment finance, than its sheer size, President Richard Gold said in an interview.The companies had been in touch for years, but Robert Wilmers, M&T’s former chairman and CEO, who died in late 2017, and People’s United Chairman and CEO Jack Barnes were never able to reach an agreement.The relationship “remained cordial” before regaining momentum a year ago, Gold said.People’s United “has always been sort of an appealing partner because of the contiguous nature of the markets they serve and they tend to serve similar midtier markets like we serve,” Gold said. “They’ve always been on our radar screen.”"
PBCT trades ex-dividend tomorrow 10/30. Dividend of .18/share payable on 11/15 if you own it by tomorrow.
"I bought on Friday because of the tremendous dividend, with increasing dividends going forward. one of the best income makers going"
If PBCT has a market vskue of 6.6 B and M&T offers 7 B doesnt seem like too large a buyout. Any idea on all stock swap
"I stopped by my local PBCT branch yesterday & asked the teller if she know when the closing date of the MTB acquisition will be. She said sometime in the first week of October. If true, this means that the deal will close prior to the scheduled Q3 earnings release date."
"Does anyone have access to American Banker?If so, can you post the following article regarding MTB's planned acquisition of PBCT?Why M&T-People's United met resistance in Connecticut"
So I have 21 shares of PBCT…that is 2.47 shares of MTB after merger. Will I receive that or will they only give me 2 shares of MTB and cash out the the rest?
"This stock is a high value one, if you check closely they increased their revenue and maintained it pretty constant throughout the whole covid period which means that it was barely affected by it. it's a solid bank."
Pbct was given away by the top level employment club there. What a pity
big sell off today is it a decent buying opportunity or what is the reason?

Very good news today from management on the loan forbearance numbers. I think their next quarterly report is going to be really good.
"The MTB-PBCT acquisition has been approved by the shareholders of both companies. Only the regulatory approval remains.The vote on the PBCT side was overwhelmingly approved, here are the voting results from their form 8K filed with the SEC: FOR - 293,620,735 AGAINST - 6,261,256 ABSTAIN - 1,613,928"
"PBCT 2020 Q4 operating earnings were .35/share, beating avg estimates by .03. Solid but not spectacular quarter. You can download the Q4 presentation document from the PBCT website for more detailed information.I just got off the conference call. No stock buybacks planned, but not ruled out for 2021. No planned M&A, but not ruled out for 2021. The closing of the Stop and Shop branches is motivated by expense reduction - branches overlap and $60M-$70M expense reduction.PBCT Q4 report much like other regional banks that have already reported Q4. Solid quarter, but very little growth for 2021. Margins/Earnings will still be under pressure for 2021 due to pandemic-related causes - low interest rates and increased personal/business failures. This may make further stock price gains tough until COVID is under control & interest rates rise further."
Does anyone know the status of the dividend? It was issued on Oct 30 last year according to Yahoo historical data. I would assume it would be about the same time this year. If there will be one before the takeover. Historically there is a run up in share price before the dividend distribution and a price drop after. By looking at the activity last month with a substantial increase and the last few days a significant price drop. It would appear a distribution might have taken place. I dont see it in my account.TIA Bill
"Report from Value LInePeople's United's stock price has drifted lower in recent months as loan yields have eased. The company's balance sheet contains a large percentage of variable-rate commercial loans that have downwardly adjusted as long-term interest rates have settled into a lower range. In addition, the share price is tied to that of merger partner M&T Bank (more below), which has also dipped as a result of less favorable business conditions. Earnings look to have topped out, for now. Mirroring the industry as a whole, the lender enjoyed sizable reversals to its loan loss provision in the first six months of the year. That lifted earnings per share, but the trend may not be as strong over the balance of the year. Moreover, People's United appears to be in a transition mode ahead of its takeover by M&T, and is perhaps not going after new business asaggressively as it otherwise might. Total loans were down 6.0% through midyear. More broadly, it has been tougher than usual for banks to issue loans, as some clients are not yet ready to expand with the pandemic lingering. All told, we figure share net will establish a holding pattern in the coming months. The merger with M&T Bank is on track to close by yearend. Shareholders have approved the transaction, and are due to receive 0.118 of a share of M&T Bank stock at the closing. There is sound logic to the move. The combined entity will be financially stronger, and cover a large part of the eastern United States. In a sense, People's United has been preparing for this day for many years. The company has participated in the industry merger trend as an acquirer on numerous occasions, building an impressive regional presence and becoming an attractive target in its own right. Most investors should hang on for the shift into M&T Bank stock. The transaction is expected to be a tax-free exchange of stock. M&T shares also offer very good dividend income, even if the yield is not as high as that of People's United stock. Overall, MTB shares provide attractive 3- to 5-year total return possibilities. In the meantime, the Timeliness rank on PBCT stock remains suspended due to the pending merger."
