All the banks stocks are tanking.
"If PBCT were to announce any dividend changes up, down or special...does anyone know when that would likely occur? thank you"
"PBCT 2020 Q4 operating earnings were .35/share, beating avg estimates by .03. Solid but not spectacular quarter. You can download the Q4 presentation document from the PBCT website for more detailed information.I just got off the conference call. No stock buybacks planned, but not ruled out for 2021. No planned M&A, but not ruled out for 2021. The closing of the Stop and Shop branches is motivated by expense reduction - branches overlap and $60M-$70M expense reduction.PBCT Q4 report much like other regional banks that have already reported Q4. Solid quarter, but very little growth for 2021. Margins/Earnings will still be under pressure for 2021 due to pandemic-related causes - low interest rates and increased personal/business failures. This may make further stock price gains tough until COVID is under control & interest rates rise further."
Let me just reiterate for the thumbs down crowd:CLUELESS and OVER THEIR HEADS
Citizens up 3.5% on report // cnbka holding up well in the 90'sPBCT down 3.5% on reportridiculous
"Yesterday’s American Banker had some deets on how the deal came together:For M&T, the decision to buy People’s United is more about the markets the seller entered and the businesses it nurtured, such as equipment finance, than its sheer size, President Richard Gold said in an interview.The companies had been in touch for years, but Robert Wilmers, M&T’s former chairman and CEO, who died in late 2017, and People’s United Chairman and CEO Jack Barnes were never able to reach an agreement.The relationship “remained cordial” before regaining momentum a year ago, Gold said.People’s United “has always been sort of an appealing partner because of the contiguous nature of the markets they serve and they tend to serve similar midtier markets like we serve,” Gold said. “They’ve always been on our radar screen.”"
PBCT is up 7.94% to 10.27
One of the few banks that made it through the 08 crisis unscathed while paying & increasing dividends. WFC i exactly why I prefer this stock over the big guys.
PBCT reached a new 52 Week Low at $15.50
One analyst has downgraded pbct to 15.50 per share
PBCT reached a new 52 Week Low at $15.10
"God this stock is a pig. Not sure how CEO and team have been allowed to go on this long. Just horrendous. Anyone have thoughts on how safe the dividend is? They cut into that, this stock goes to 7. Yikes."
"All bank stocks sold off today, with more intense volume selling after 3 PM. That is when the Institutions sell.Banks selling off the past two days due to rumors that the FED is going to lower interest rates below zero soon.Negative interest rates would be very bad for Bank stocks as they would hurt bank profits further.FED chairman J Powell speaks tomorrow. Let's hope he addresses the negative interest rate subject & says that it will not happen. If he confirms that negative interest rates are to be implemented soon, Bank stocks may sell off further and their precious dividends will be in jeopardy. Crazy World....."
PBCT reached a 52 Week low at $14.05
The market is flying today yet this junk is RED as usual! You completely forget about GREEN when you own this garbage because you’re so used to seeing RED smh. Watch the clueless MORONS come and defend the management of this great bank that’s being run to the ground by a bunch of losers!!!
"This thing’s pretty low, I think I’ll gamble and buy a little before earnings later today"
Anyone else swing trading PBCT. I have been in and out 14.75 to 16 a number of times and thinking we are at a high again. Any thoughts ?
Soon this will be junk!
Mtb shares now at 139 dlrs. Pbct is being given away. This is likely to get worse For pbct shareholders
"Banking Sector Under performing...But, Vaccines and Technology ending Pandemic are near (2021) which should result in interest rates and personal incomes to rise boosting Banking values. Also at these low Market Caps, another round of Consolations may take place (PNC acquiring US BBVA announced). Don't know if People's will be in play or M&A, but possible at these values. I'm staying Long and would not want to be a short here. Anybody got Anything I am not seeing to stop upward movement...?"
Who's next?
PBCTP is down 15.50% to 16.35
"Remarkable increase in price over the last few months for PBCT. Shares were trading at tangible book in September. Now, the sale to MTB values PBCT at over 1.6 times tangible book."
"2021 Q1 earnings come out next week.PBCT reports on Thurs 04/22. Consensus is .34/share earnings & $493M in revenue.Since the MTB-PBCT acquisition is still in place, MTB earnings will be more important since PBCT currently trades at approx. 11.8% of MTB share price, per the acquisition conversion rate.MTB reports on Monday 04/19. Consensus is 3.00/share earnings & $1.49B in revenue. NII, NIM, and future loan growth will also be important on these earning calls."
PBCTP is down 9.63% to 21.20
"Nice 3 day rally in all regional bank stocks. Nice to be off those low prices not seen since the 2009 financial crisis. Lots of uncertainty remains with virus still rampant & USA essentially closed. Looks like government is adding more $$$ to their SMB loan program. Watch the new unemployment claims number being released tomorrow at 8:30 AM EST. I think that the avg estimate is for an additional 5.2 million claims. If it is significantly more, it may not bode well for bank stocks. That would bring the total claims to 15 million in 3 weeks. Really need to figure out how to get the USA open for business again, at least partially. Good luck to all & stay safe."
looking fabulous
"can someone explain the dividend? Will there be one July 30, or did that one get skipped? also, is the one in September for these shares? wasn't sure when it said ""preferred stock shares"" Thanks!"
"I don't know if this is a short squeeze but the bank may be in talks with another bank, possibly NYCB.Let's see what the next days bring!"
Did PBCT announce common dividend?
"Good bank, great fundamentals. While the stock price has not been exciting the dividend sure is a plus. Too many people on this message board complaining that it should be bought out, replace the BOD?management but it sure is nice to own a stock in a small bank that has been around so long and provides a nice dividend to reinvest."
PBCT is down 8.09% to 10.56
"Report from Value LInePeople's United's stock price has drifted lower in recent months as loan yields have eased. The company's balance sheet contains a large percentage of variable-rate commercial loans that have downwardly adjusted as long-term interest rates have settled into a lower range. In addition, the share price is tied to that of merger partner M&T Bank (more below), which has also dipped as a result of less favorable business conditions. Earnings look to have topped out, for now. Mirroring the industry as a whole, the lender enjoyed sizable reversals to its loan loss provision in the first six months of the year. That lifted earnings per share, but the trend may not be as strong over the balance of the year. Moreover, People's United appears to be in a transition mode ahead of its takeover by M&T, and is perhaps not going after new business asaggressively as it otherwise might. Total loans were down 6.0% through midyear. More broadly, it has been tougher than usual for banks to issue loans, as some clients are not yet ready to expand with the pandemic lingering. All told, we figure share net will establish a holding pattern in the coming months. The merger with M&T Bank is on track to close by yearend. Shareholders have approved the transaction, and are due to receive 0.118 of a share of M&T Bank stock at the closing. There is sound logic to the move. The combined entity will be financially stronger, and cover a large part of the eastern United States. In a sense, People's United has been preparing for this day for many years. The company has participated in the industry merger trend as an acquirer on numerous occasions, building an impressive regional presence and becoming an attractive target in its own right. Most investors should hang on for the shift into M&T Bank stock. The transaction is expected to be a tax-free exchange of stock. M&T shares also offer very good dividend income, even if the yield is not as high as that of People's United stock. Overall, MTB shares provide attractive 3- to 5-year total return possibilities. In the meantime, the Timeliness rank on PBCT stock remains suspended due to the pending merger."
People's United Finl is up 8.76% to 11.48
this thing is fighting over a nickle for 3 hours
big sell off today is it a decent buying opportunity or what is the reason?
"I’ll take it, these guys, like the big banks, did really well during the heart of the Covid epidemic. Things looking up from here and the dividend is nice..."
"sell PBCT buy nycb ,they go next"
What happened to PBCT basher Richard? He must have been short and jumped out of a window.

Oh well.
(WTNH) — People’s United bank is being acquired by M&T Bank and hundreds of Connecticut employees will now be laid off when the deal is finalized.The Connecticut Department of Labor says 747 people will be laid off statewide between October 1 and May 20 of next year.
People's United Financial is up 4.94% to 16.05
at what price point would farmington bank/first ct. stock buy out in this be? 1.725 share exchange. 17.80? thats crazy.
Very good news today from management on the loan forbearance numbers. I think their next quarterly report is going to be really good.
Mtb tdy is 128dlrs. Hope pbct directors are looking a way out of this deal
People's United Financial is down 4.91% to 17.55
PBCT is down 5.00% to 13.12
"If I buy PBCT today at 18.45 and the buyout goes thru at todays M&T banks price,,,,,,would I not lose share value ???"
I sold all of my PBCT two days ago and bought more AAPL. Glad I did.
I wonder how thin the approval rate was for this sellout !!!
When will the closing occur?
PBCTP is up 5.97% to 28.05
PBCT is up 5.00% to 13.87
"The loan loss reserve and P/L hit on this regional will be large. The credit quality of a lot of these banks are suspect, even with underwriting standards in place. The unprecedented COVID 19 impact on borrowers will severely hurt the P/L for PBCT's portfolio for years to come. I don't think this has been priced in yet. This has run up over 22% since the bottom and the credit quality was not discussed at that time. The high probability short to medium term trade/investment is back into single digits, then a move up to 12.00 by next June 2021. Good luck!"
FED chairman Powell speaking now if you are interested.
Let us note warren buffet just sold out his entire share of m&t stock. So Seems a negative outlook for pbct
PBCTP is up 7.62% to 20.18

Can you imagine a merger between PBCT and Zions Bank? East meets west? No?
Good entry
PBCT is down 4.92% to $16.15
Monday will boom 
stock is undervalued here imho. picked up 5500 at 10.35 average. In my neck of the woods they are buying up banks.
"Peoples bank stock is one of the most frustrating stock I held for longest time and then gave up on it in 2016. Although, it is also one of the best for dividend investors. It is a well run bank, however it has too many branches which in today's world is too expensive and adds to cost and eats the profit. During the financial crisis, it reached $10 against my $15.50 buy price and I had to be content with the dividend for several years while the other large banks gained 4 - 5 times in price. There were several rumours that it will get bought out couple of years after peoples bought chittenden, but never materialized. It seems that they paid extremely high price for chittenden. For some reason. the peoples bank is controlled by the banks large major share holders / BOD, and management does not have much."
Time to replace the bod and mgt of this POS // cant wait for the next meeting
PBCT reached a 52 Week low at 10.48
PBCT is up 5.41% to 12.47
"FED just lowered interest rates to Zero. This should not be good for all bank stocks. Coronavirus is causing major disruptions to everything. Interest rates sharply down, oil prices sharply down, businesses affected downward, and the potential for many deaths from the virus. This will reduce all bank profits and all banks will also need to be concerned about defaults on loans. Although the low P/E & high dividend look very attractive, I believe there is a good possibility that the div will be cut & there is more short-term downside to share prices. We'll be fine long term, but who knows how long the current situation will last & how bad it will get? Hope we don't need to go to a nationwide lockdown like Italy & Spain. Just too much unknown currently, hard to invest. Good Luck to all."
People's United Finl is up 7.38% to 13.83
has anyone actually banked with Peoples?
"Quite a 1 day run-up. Over 24% at the high of the day. Caused by the great news of a viable COVID vaccine which caused a buying spree & short covering. PBCT had approx 15 million shares short & when those shorts scramble to cover, it causes a sharp increase in share price on heavy volume like today. There may be some profit taking, anyone who bought in the $10 range is very happy today.We still need to get through the winter & the recent surge in new COVID cases. The Pfizer vaccine probably won't be available until Q2 2021 & we'll need to deal with all the idiots who won't take the vaccine.We're not out of the woods yet, but today was great news."
"Dividend is good,this is a good point to buy more it seems to me"
Looking at this stock for a few days now. What would you think it is a good entry price. It keeps going down so maybe below 12$ or close to 11$? What you think?
PBCT is down 6.41% to 11.69
Good luck all. I cashed out to fish in a different spot.
all the BOD does is receive their options then sell !!! No skin and they never purchase with their own $$$.That says tons! Look at CNBKA ---insiders always buying. Watch EBC as well /// both better run!
PBCTP is down 6.07% to 19.18
"I have remained quite on this board; however with earnings announced and preopen expected to be down .40, the market makers are very much aware of the misleading info from Barnes and the BOD. Certainly time for a change as indicated by many on this site. Too bad the ""good ole boys"" seem to be satisfied. Maybe the company should be liquidated or merged."
I wonder what they will do with PBCT's dividend...
Looks like people think it's worth more. Someone said to look at NYCB and that might be a good idea. 52 week high I think today? 5.89%div.
??? why the sell off to 18 ?? they should be bought out !!!
this stock hs gone nowhere in 10 years....selling and buying Allianz
"Up, up and away! Thank you President-elect Biden! America may finally be great again!"

Zack’s rates us a a hold.
"Nice to see PBCT back to $20.00 range. Hope it can maintain the price and continue the with the dividend. As a personal customer for 34 years and a recent business customer, this is a fantastic bank."
PBCTP is down 32.89% to 15.51
"Richard - No excuse, just reality.The price of crude oil has nothing to do with the stock price of regional banks.All regional bank stocks are down 40%-60% since the virus pandemic started, not just PBCT.The USA is essentially being shut down & the economic impact is causing all bank stocks to tank. The longer we are shut down, the higher the probability of both business & personal loan defaults. Also, the zero interest rate set by the FED will result in reduced bank profits.There may be more downside if this continues. We really need to have some glimmer of hope that the virus situation will get better & the USA can open for business again. Too much uncertainty currently. Some experts say virus stuff will be resolved 6-12 months & some experts say we are headed for a depression."
People's United Finl is up 9.76% to 17.21
"Ok here goes, looong time holder probably 1998 , obvious trading range last 10 years 13.to 19.with small peaks ether end . With the uncertainty and upcoming elections trading around the mid point of the range 4.1% dividend I can’t believe but this is what I did invest more into this week first new money into PBCT from me in over 20 years . Hope to see the top of the range again"
PBCT trades ex-dividend tomorrow 10/30. Dividend of .18/share payable on 11/15 if you own it by tomorrow.
"Just look at the performance of PBCT and other regional banks since January 2017. With exceptions, PBCT has performed about the same while maintaining the dividend and a strong financial position. If we had the best economy ever, why did interest rates sink to almost zero percent? I believe the current PBCT stock price reflects the state of the economy with almost 30 million unemployed Americans, while many stocks are well into bubble territory. A massive correction is overdue.c185,000 dead Americans and still at infection rates twice what they were on Memorial Day with another holiday weekend coming to cause more spikes. This developed nation with 4 percent of the world's population has had 25 percent of the deaths due to covid. Look at the violence and civil unrest under this so called leadership. Just ask yourself ""Is America Great Again? Can the United States survive four more years of this insanity?"
PBCTP is down -5.54% to 25.67
Politicians are now out kill this very poor deal
"After ER, this should see $20."
PBCTP reached a 52 Week low at 23.76
Is there a possibility that this bank will be acquired? Maybe Wells Fargo would be interested.
so farmington bank ceo made out like a bandit
If PBCT has a market vskue of 6.6 B and M&T offers 7 B doesnt seem like too large a buyout. Any idea on all stock swap
"PBCT Q3 earnings out & it is mixed.EPS was .34 vs .29 expected. Positive beat by .05Revenue was $499.8M vs $507.5M expected. Negative beat by $7.7M.Net Interest Margin was slightly negative compared to Q2, Loan growth was slightly negative.Not sure what the market reaction will be, especially with today's run up.There is a PBCT Q3 earnings conference call at 5PM EST today. The link is on the www.peoples.com website in the investors relations section. There will be a lot of detailed information on that call."

I had PBCT around 18 and the merger did not look good and now I come back and the price here is under 16 so is this merger a good deal at this price today ? Thanks
Given the poor performance of mtb stock and its outlook it would appear that pbct should be buying out mtb instead of the other war around
aren't bank usually valued based on BV. I recollect banks trading around 1.25 or 1.5
"About fourteen years ago PBCT went public at $20.00 per share. Now management thinks it's okay to give shareholders $17.70 for their shares. Shame on management. No thank you, John Barnes."
PBCT reached a 52 Week low at 11.57
"Need a little help here, I own PBCT and in looking around ran across PBCTP which seems to be the same bank, is the second one preferred stock ? If so which is the best to hold ? Seems this one pays a better dividend ,any help would be appreciated"
PBCT reached a 52 Week low at 10.29
"The FED 2020 bank stress test results are being released tomorrow Thurs 06/25/2020 at approx 4:30 PM EST.This year's test applies to USA banks with over $100 billion in assets under management - 34 banks. PBCT is not one of these banks, they have $58 billion in assets.It will be interesting to see how the large banks fare with these stress tests, as it will be an indication of overall small/medium bank health,especially in the ability of the bank to pay future dividends during the next few quarters of loan defaults/extensions. I'm thinking that you need to look at a bank's estimated Q2 earnings per share & see if it exceeds the quarterly dividend payment. If it does not, the dividend is in jeopardy."
I do not think there is a single stock other than PBCT which has basically not moved for 13 years but is still in business!
Bought a 100 lot. Not a big fish! Good luck longs!
PBCT is down 7.15% to 12.85
PBCT earnings out & they look pretty good. 2020 Q1 earnings .30/share & $520 million revenue.Dividend was increased by a penny to .72.The full release is available at www.peoples.com in the Investor Relations section.Conference call starts at 5PM EST & the link is available on the PBCT website.Hopefully they will provide some details and future guidance for Q2.
So I'm interested in investing $5000 either in Schwab or PBCT. Any suggests would be welcome.
"I have not received the dividend yet, am i missing something? Was owner as of 8/3 and was supposed to pay 8/15 correct? thx for any info"
"So my 300 shares become 35 shares, and my div yield gets reduced from 4.5% to 2.9%."

"If you think this is bad, the second wave of the trump virus is just starting. Joe Biden will have his work cut out for him come January. Fortunately he has the experience from turning around the Bush fiasco. But when you elect a failure at business/reality tv star, what should you expect?Are we great yet?????????????"
"PBCT upgraded by Jeffries from Buy to Hold, price target $16."
Market initially reacting favorably to the acquisition. MTB up about $2 this morning.
That's a GOOD beat $0.37 vs estimate of $0.33. Stock deserves to move up.
PBCT is up 8.35% to 12.14
"FED released the results of their 2nd Bank Stress Tests after market close Friday. Results were very good, banks are generally well capitalized to withstand any loan defaults. The restriction on Bank share buybacks was lifted but buyback amount cannot exceed trailing 12 month earnings. Great news for banks, especially those with solid earnings. Most banks up in after-hours trading.Not sure if PBCT will consider a buyback to increase EPS and share price."
If some banks close pbct could stay because its in a grocery store. nicely played.
"What are these shareholders doing and what is this Board thinking? Are they tired of managing this bank? I am voting against this merger. Now all CT shareholders and employees are giving up any control over the destiny of this 175 year old business. As a shareholder, I think we could have gotten more. As a former resident of Bridgeport, I feel this is a disaster for the community and feel the Board did not do its job."
One of the worst managed banks out there...back to 2003 levels very soon
I voted no. My 100 shares will surely sway the vote.
As we see today this deal with mtb is a poor one. We pbct shareholders really have no clue what we will be finally getting out of this come the closing date. Do we get a vote?
I listened to the MTB acquisition call today. You can access a replay of it on the PBCT website in the INVESTOR RELATIONS section. There is also a downloadable presentation slide deck that has a lot of useful information.
PBCT is down 7.39% to 12.15
"Does anyone have access to American Banker?If so, can you post the following article regarding MTB's planned acquisition of PBCT?Why M&T-People's United met resistance in Connecticut"
maybe we have to many chiefs if so get them togeather. and think of the stock holders and move forward.
People's United Finl is down 5.27% to 10.97
hi. I like PBCT and Key in the USA banks sector...Neither has cut dividend in quite a while...any others you guys like?
I wonder if PBCT is interested in doing a merger of equals with NYCB. At the current price PBCT would exchange 1.4 shares for every NYCB share. Both are similar in size. It just depends on how the banks could agree on how to share the senior management positions.Could be a possible combination!
Pbct was given away by the top level employment club there. What a pity
"Wow. PBCT up 18% today on double the average daily volume. Most other regional banks were up today, but none up anywhere near 18%. It could be short covering or some large financial institutions rebuilding their portfolios at bargain prices. Looks like the FED will totally support the US financial system, protecting banks from major damage from withdrawals/loans. No idea if PBCT is for sale. Doubt that NYCB can acquire them, they have too much debt already. All banks are going to be very busy in the next few months managing the financial mess created by COVID-19. Our country needs to concentrate on stopping the COVID-19 spread. Once that occurs, financial markets will recover."
PBCT is down 7.72% to 12.91
I just closed my People's United and People's Securities accounts after being with them for 40 years. I went with TD Bank and TD Ameritrade/Schwab. I wasn't going to chance a problem with the M&T transition. Also got out of PBCT a while ago. I don't trust this merger with M&T.
PBCTP reached a 52 Week high at 29.60
PBCT needs to stop buying banks and sell !!! The only ones making $$$ are the BOD and lousy officers
"How does management justify their compensation with such poor results. Where's the ""Pay for Performance"" mantra management judges others by ??? I long for the Dave Carson days. A management change is long overdue. Here's a suggestion: Barnes and his management team go back to Vermont and open up an antiques business. Maybe he'll be more successful at that."
PBCT is up 8.39% to 12.15
Another bad deal for Bridgeport and share holders.
Owned this dog for years thank god I've reinvested the dividens back in the stock when will there be talks to buy this company from one of the big banks so I can get out with a handsome profit. I Hope
I Voted tdy against the mtb merger

"Wow, up almost $4 since election day. And some people predicted JB would cause this stock to tank."
What is happening with this sudden upward movement?
"Brutal day for all Bank & Oil stocks. Current PBCT price looks enticing, but there is now talk of the FED lowering interest rates again very soon. Bank stocks go down when Fed Fund rates are lowered because they make less money on loans, lowering their profits. .But this selling has to stop sometime. In at $14.25. Stable 5% dividend yield is very good with 10-year treasuries yielding under 1%. Corona virus is creating havoc in the financial markets. Good luck to the longs !"
"MTB is ""stealing"" PBCT at this low price"
PBCT reached a 52 Week low at 9.91
sold out my position today st 19.04. been a good run from 10.37 however its time to move on and seek better dividend yields elsewhere...thank you PBCT
What’s up with the next dividend ? Anyone ?
PBCT may be down today but it is up almost $3.00 since election day.

"MTB must be close to sealing the deal on buying , share price is being pushed down so they can get a better deal ."
"Under 16 today ,,,,how low will it go ?"
Bank has head winds to contend with....the high tax rates at state levels makes this a very unattractive stock based on growth potential. Simply put a dividend payor at present; but who knows what the future bodes as many are fleeing the high tax states. Very unfortunate situation.

Obviously something is amiss. Management seems to be unable to convince or peddle this dividend producer. Much has been lost over the past 2 months in value. Maybe the BOD should re evaluate their performance and seek a buyer for the bank!

"@Anonymous - OK, you voted against the MTB acquisition. Let's assume you own many millions of shares of PBCT & can make a difference in the outcome of the vote. Acquisition does not get approved & PBCT stock goes back to pre-acquisition level - about $15/share. Thanks a lot."

why today's large move?
PBCT reached a 52 Week low at $14.65
shame on the mgt. 4 giving away the company so cheaply
Time for Barnes to go. New leadership may see a path to ssd's success for this debacle but this guy is clueless and in way over his head in todays economy
PBCTP is up 7.39% to 18.16
PBCT reached a 52 Week low at 10.30
So I have 21 shares of PBCT…that is 2.47 shares of MTB after merger. Will I receive that or will they only give me 2 shares of MTB and cash out the the rest?
Question. how will peoples preferred stk will be treated in the mtb deal ?
I own 4900 shares of peoples stock. the math tells me the merger will cost me about $1000.00 a year in Dividends. Not happy !
"25M shares today, no news?"
A meaningless dividend for a stock whose share price never moves. Div increases of one quarter of a penny per year means you would have to live to 200-300 years old before you would make any money off this pig...
PBCTP reached an all time low at 14.50
"I stopped by my local PBCT branch yesterday & asked the teller if she know when the closing date of the MTB acquisition will be. She said sometime in the first week of October. If true, this means that the deal will close prior to the scheduled Q3 earnings release date."
"""A rising tide floats all boats"". Many financials are doing well this week. KEY, AXP, SBSI, PFG, MTB and many others are on the rise. MTB is up 1.95% so far today. Glad this acquisition is being done as a stock swap and not a cash offer."
"Wow, up almost $2.00 since election day! Thanks Joe!"
Looking forward to earnings later today
"The MTB-PBCT acquisition has been approved by the shareholders of both companies. Only the regulatory approval remains.The vote on the PBCT side was overwhelmingly approved, here are the voting results from their form 8K filed with the SEC: FOR - 293,620,735 AGAINST - 6,261,256 ABSTAIN - 1,613,928"
I like banking at a little smaller bank like peoples. Great service!
This stock will be a great buy but not until after Biden wins the election. Trump's constant denial of the Corona virus while it is surging throughout the country is unbelievable. Vote like you life depends on it. Because it does!
PBCT is up 7.44% to 11.84
People's United Finl is up 8.45% to 11.38
offer of $17.75 against a book of $18.40. divided goes to 2.9%. this will not get my vote at this valuation.
PBCT reached a 52 Week low at 10.06
they should buy BWFG
"When is management going to be held accountable for their poor performance; quarter after quarter, year after year. So many acquisitions, so little to show for them."
"Bank Q4 earnings season starts tomorrow 1/15 with some large banks reporting - JPM, C, WFC, PNC. PBCT reports 2020 Q4 earnings on Thurs 1/21. Average consensus is approx .33/share earnings & $500 million revenue. While 4Q earnings numbers are important to hit, it is in the past. The forward guidance & loan loss status needs to be positive news also to support the huge run-up in share price recently."
PBCTP is down 6.00% to 22.10
"I have owned this stock for over 30 years.If they are going to be merging, I would hope that a cash buyout is part of the deal. If it's not, it won't be worth it. The same shortchanging happened with NEW HAVEN SAVINGS BANK years ago, when they were bought out by FIRST NIAGARA BANK. The only ones who made any money, were the directors who got their shares for nothing, and as far as I'm concerned, those people should have been jailed for taking the money and running, and leaving the real shareholders, with their hands on their candy #$%$ Many of us have not forgotten that."
great results ! next q4 will be more positive. Dividents! 16$ is coming
"@Anonymous - Bank stocks are all significantly down today due to the 10-year treasury yields being down. Nothing to do with the MTB-PBCT acquisition. The acquisition is estimated to close in Q4 2021. On the closing date, PBCT shareholders will get .118 shares of MTB common stock for each share of PBCT they own. All of us PBCT shareholders get one vote per share, but since PBCT is 75% owned by institutions, they have all the votes they need for approval. We can sell our PBCT shares at any time, no need to wait for the closing of the deal. As long as the acquisition remains in place, PBCT will be trading at approx 11.8% of the price of MTB give or take a few cents either way until the closing date."
PBCT is down 4.90% to 15.61
Time to bail!
my guess being bought out soon . certain banks have way too much cash.lots of reduction in their costs if bought out.
What was the price for share that M &T is paying for People’s share
Equity summary score 8.4 out of 10 = bullish
"I've never owned a $100 stock and never thought I would. Now I have 60 shares of a $150 stock! Damn, I'm finally a big shot."
"Pbct has a higher yield, a lower P.E., and it's not even at the high of a few years ago....what a dumb move with these good stats....shame again. !!!"
"Friday is ex-dividend date, July 31, to be paid on Aug 15. FYI..."
On the bright side you can now buy more pbct stk at a little over 15 dlrs. And for awhile collect a nearly five pct divvie. Then hope mtb stk goes back up to a reasonable conversion price sometime this fall
