"Look, mu said the same thing as wdc few weeks ago when it reportes the earning the price dropoed to 72. Even since then it gets punished by subsequent earnings from similar companies for same period. Price now 68"
EV sales are growing at very high rate; these are high tech vehicles that are using Micron memory!TSLA had blow out earnings and per the report they said:“[Tesla will] achieve 50% average annual growth in vehicle deliveries” over a multi-year horizon.PC may be flat/declining market but high margin auto memory is beginning to ramp exponentially----Price Target: $95 in 4-10 months
"Some quotes from SK Hynix today:""In other words, [global supply chain issues] could actually turn some of the demand into deferred demand into next year or turn them into pent-up demand, which, in turn, could actually serve to solidify the demand next year.""""Now for the overall server market, we see that the upstream demand in this year as well as next year will remain solid and the investment into that will also continue.""""But then with the explosive growth in cloud demand more recently, there has been increase in the overall demand. And also, there was -- it was followed by some memory capacity correction in the industry. As a result, what we are seeing now is that the suppliers' capacity is largely moving in step with the demand. So the demand flexibility is not like what we used to see in the past.""""So we believe that, overall, among all the applications, [DRAM] actually remains the most solid in terms of demand."
Glad I didn't get scared and sell really can't trust anyone or anything. Took me a long time to realize that.
Mu is at a crossroads now. Next week will decide the fate for the near future.
"This price action is so confusing. That’s probably the objective of the powers that be. If so, we’ll done."
"Samsung Q&A:Kim DongwonMy first question is about the Memory business. You mentioned that the memory downcycle is expected to be less in terms of magnitude and also shorter than before. Can you give us some of the reasons why you expect that? Han Jin ManThe reason why we think that the down cycle or will be less in magnitude in shorter is three-fold. One is the fact that the applications have become much more diverse than before. Previously, the main source of memory demand was the PC, but now memory is being used in a far wider range of applications. Similar to [Indiscernible] portfolio, volatility decreases if it's well diversified. I think a similar situation is happening in the memory market.Another reason for the change in the down cycle is because we are now working with cutting-edge, very difficult memory processes because of the difficulties of the technology. It's not as easy to maintain the same level as bit growth as before. And there are restrictions and limitations in rapidly increasing memory output.I think we're currently experiencing a part of that impact. For example, our inventory continues to remain at very lean levels of past quarter, as well as this quarter. So, I think the type of -- the difficulty of the memory process technology, while also be a reason why the possibility of an extreme downcycle as what we saw in 2008 is low.And the third reason is that basically, both the vendors and the customers have learned their lesson during the past extreme shortage and also oversupply. That it's best for the entire market to maintain a level of rationality and soundness. And that has also improved the SCM and crisis management capabilities of participants in the memory market. And I think that would also contribute to improving the downcycle."
"Micron to build $7 bln plant in Japans Hiroshima - report10:42 PM ET 10/19/21 | ReutersMicron to build $7 bln plant in Japan's Hiroshima - reportTOKYO, Oct 20 (Reuters) - U.S. chip supplier Micron Technology Inc is set to invest 800 billion yen ($6.99 billion) in building a new factory in Hiroshima, western Japan, the Nikkan Kogyo newspaper reported on Wednesday.Micron's plant is likely to specialise in DRAM memory chips which are widely used in data centers, and is due to start operating by 2024, it said.The report comes as strong demand from automakers and tech companies have contributed to a severe global chip shortage. Taiwan chip giant TSMC announced plans last week to build a plant in Japan, and media reports have said the Japanese government was ready to help pay for its investment."
"Now … pull for solid AMD results, because it’s in your best interest owning the laggard in the semis. A rising tide… lifts all boats that don’t have holes in them."
"Seeking Alpha minutes ago: ""MU gains 3% after acknowledging impact from Taiwan earthquake""Oct. 25, 2021 10:10 AM ETMicron Technology, Inc. (MU)By: Jason Aycock, SA News Editor ""MU is up 3%, extending a gain in premarket that came after the company acknowledged it saw production impact from yesterday's earthquake in Taiwan.A quake of magnitude 6.2 hit near Yilan, Taiwan, and Micron says that had an effect on its facilities in the city of Taoyuan.It's still evaluating the impact of the quake, and ""determining the appropriate steps to return to full production,"" the company says.What are the implications? Evercore ISI says that while the immediate effect may not be clear, ""any meaningful production hit would most certainly lead to a much more tight supply environment and could pull in a DRAM pricing inflection"" from the expected impact in the first half of 2022.And Wells Fargo says that if it takes some time for production to be restarted, that could mean a fairly quick increase in prices. Wells Fargo is bullish, with a $115 price target implying 66% upside."""
I'm in at $92. This is my 3rd or 4th bagholding experience with Micron. Micron -who could be a darling of the USA....
The negative analysts are truly fake news. Micron is getting stable and improving revenues
"Historically Micron's business has been dictated by CPU demand. Both Intel and AMD reported great demand, namely in the data center segment. Not too mention the exponential growth EV vehicles which need even more memory. And the cherry on top is MSFT reported blow out earnings especially in the cloud segment. Micron's tailwinds are going to become stronger when the global supply chain is refactored to run more efficiently."
"NDQ up this stays put. NDQ down this drops x3. MU announcing earnings= down. Other chips announcing good earnings= MU put, Other chips announcing bad earnings MU drops x3."
This will continue to drop unless it breaks this downward channel. It is being dictated by trades only now as they ride this thing. At one point this will break this trend. Strong support at 65 so I would not sell.
AMD earnings look pretty good. Almost all semis reporting blockbuster earnings. So that kinda begs the question….. why MU lowers?
I would rather the earth quake come from south Korean. Halt production of Samsung and SK hynix. That would be amaze for MU.
"The semiconductor manufacturers seem to have a strong consensus that chip demand will remain strong, They see it going up in the future, due to new applications. Bears looking forward to plunging demand are severely off base here.It's hilarious, the efforts put into manufacturing all these MU down cycles."
"SEOUL (Reuters) -SK Hynix forecast steady demand for memory chips on Tuesday as it posted its highest quarterly operating profit in nearly three years on the back of rising prices, striking a more bullish note than rivals including Micron."
"AAPL earnings shows that MU can charge huge prices for memory and get away with it, too. It is very good for our margin."
"Forget the analyst that lower to $58. There is always analyst trying to lowball so they can buy at the moment, Hence the jump in Stock price today!Buy/Hold!"
"MU stable, Hynix up from extreme levels. Hynix was much cheaper than MU mid-October on EV/operating profit basis. Now they are on par. The fact memory stocks are not going lower on lower DRAM spot means 1. they are really cheap hence 2. not that many sellers left who want to bet on this brief downcycle."
"Most likely scenario is a green candle next month. Technically we had a touch at support on a monthly chart so I would say can get some little rebou d in Nov. I don't this there is any major driver of recovery here until memory prices start to go up. As I said I will wait for the touch at 73/74 and Im out, will wait for another pullback to jump in again next year."
"Chief EG. you should worry about after hours. You have chosen to be in a data storage stock. They rank out of 197 industries 151, where as if were in a Fabless semi you would be in the top 10. You are joined at the hip with WDC in this respect. WDC is down 10 percent after hours!"
"WDC: First quarter revenue was $5.1 billion, up 29% year-over-year (YoY). Cloud revenue increased 72%, Client revenue increased 6%, and Consumer revenue increased 10% YoY. . . and this is a bad thing ?"
"If a production outage spikes a 2% gain, then MU should just voluntarily shutdown it's factories for a few weeks. Maybe the stock would rally into the $90's. LOL."
Just in case folks have not heard. Evercore Upgraded Mu to $100 today.If you look at Mu biz. Mu is Way Undervalue at the moment!
"What I don't understand is if we are suffering so severely from the chip shortage then why are the companies that are stepping up to bat in an effort to alleviate the problem such as Micron and Taiwan Semi, etc. being beaten down so severely when these companies will be the ""saviors?"""
MU up 2.27 percent for the week.NVDA up 13 percent.
"""Lam's CC yesterday with Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. It seems very straightforward:Harlan Sur: Good afternoon and great job on the quarterly execution, guys. You know, the market is concerned that we're heading into a multi-quarter downturn in Memory, kind of similar to the 2018/2019 Memory downturn, which is a pretty severe 6-quarter downturn, but the one thing I clearly remember was that ahead of that downturn, your memory customers proactively cut their CapEx very, very rapidly.Now, if I look at it this time around, there's some near-term pricing weakness in memory. But the overall memory demand environment remains pretty strong, and I think most memory companies seem optimistic right under the baton outlook for next year.So I guess the question is, has the Lam team seen any signs similar to the 2018 downturn of customers either getting concerned or canceling or slight pushing out of shipments due to a concern on our projected memory downturn next year?Tim ArcherYeah. Harlan, let me take that first. I think the simple answer is no. When the vast majority of our conversations with customers today is still about delivering equipment that they feel they badly need to meet their near-term requirements. And as Doug mentioned in his prepared remarks, I would say lead times have stretched out to the point where our visibility into demand in '22 is better than usual.So I don't think that the types of initial indicators that you're talking about are things we're seeing right now. We feel much more constrained by supply chain challenges and ability to meet shipments than an over shipping situation"""
I’m staying with mu as it’s heading back up to a hundred during next several months. .....very very dangerous to short. Fundamentals AND the pe dictate holding.
NVDA up 8 plus percent. Now it’s extended and I can no longer recommend for new purchases.
Gaps left on the charts. $58$52.50November of last year. These gaps will get filled by the third week of November. Even the call/put omens point to that occurring. Good entry in the overshoot at $48-$52GLTA
"Agree with Sarah, no more significant downside risks now. The memory market had been overly punished, especially MU. We should see the prices rise until EOY."
"I’m looking for MU to head up from now thru January. Frankly, I could care less what the ‘analysts’ say."
"Samsung ""predicting robust demand for servers and personal computers to continue"". ""Rival SK Hynix Inc. said Tuesday the supply flexibility has changed from the past as chip suppliers manage capacity in line with demand, echoing Micron Technology Inc.’s argument that the wide swings between shortages and gluts are moderating."" ""Still, chip suppliers remain optimistic demand won’t fall off. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. Chief Executive Officer Lisa Su gave a bullish outlook on Tuesday, predicting strong demand for server and console chips in 2022, while predicting a “flattish” PC market."""

"MOMUTE TonyD, the guy that claims he works for Altria. 14 days ago he was on the MU board saying he worked for Nvidia.tonyd14 days agoReplied to a reaction$MU conversationYes I write recipes for these chips. I switched company after company. Just like Infineon this is going to drop. Too expensive to make DRAM. Now I work for Nvidia and very happy. I am sure you know DRAM. It takes so many days to make, the tooling is expensive. Dram is a dying chip. When it was expensive through the nineties and to early 2008 it was great. The price is just dropping now. I wish Micron would change their business to other chips so I could move back home."
"Berstein analyst: ""A downcycle has just begun. PT $58.""D.

"I am about done with Micron!! I have been in the stock for years and they have made soooooo much money but the stock never reflects that and goes up!!! Now they state that they want to invest 150 billions over next 10 years!!?? 150 billions??? Well, 15 billion per year for sure means that they will not make any profit for the next 10 years unless their revenue and margins increase a lot! In other words there will not be anything left for the investors. How many other companies go out and invest DOUBLE of their market cap over 10 years???"
