Any particular reason for today's sell off after a yesterday's big gain?
"Intel and AMD are both switching over to DDR5 platforms around end of year to early 2022, forcing the entire competitive cloud enterprise sector to adopt the new standard, followed by home PCs and eventually mobile devices. All that DDR4 out there is suddenly obsolete. Sounds more like the beginning of a super cycle than a “winter is coming” end-of-cycle. Keep in mind that certain short-sighted(-sided) analysts are only projecting spot pricing models off DDR4 data."

If memory is such a commodity how come it doesn’t trade on a futures exchange such as oil precious metals coffee sugar cocoa orange juice natural gas etc.

MU is undervalued and will bounce back to $100 before end of this year !!
"Here is what AMAT said yesterday at earnings call"" ... We expect DRAM spending to be the second fastest-growing WFE market this year, and we see a positive setup for sustained investment in capacity and new technology. Supply side inventories remain below normal levels and long-term demand drivers are strong, fueled by memory-intensive AI computing.On an absolute basis, we expect NAND investments to be similar to DRAM for the year. We believe NAND inventories are at normal levels both on the supply side and demand-side. Looking further ahead, I strongly believe there has never been a more exciting time for semiconductor companies. We are only at the beginning of decade-long trends that will underpin secular industry growth. ... """
They had some interesting insights about MU on (http://Rightpicker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
I am wondering how much Morgan Stanley added in after people sold at around $69.0.

Technically Barclays is right. Most of big tech stocks are overpriced. They will not be able to return to their “normal” p/e by increasing the earnings within a year. But this has nothing with MU. Their forward p/e is perfect.
"""Investor Takeaway (See well respected Robert Costellano, Seeking Alfha) - ""Recent press release from TrendForce and a report a day later by Morgan Stanley is based in data that's irrational and illogical. Their analysis is based on:PC DRAM ASPs that represent just 15% of the total DRAM demand.A drop in PC sales, which have been in decline and only increased due to the pandemic, but low PC sales correlate with high ASPs (Charts 3 and 5).Failure to recognize that DRAM content per PC is increasing each year and that metric shows no abatement in growth.DRAM spot prices instead of contract prices, the latter of which correlate with reporting data supplied by DRAM manufacturer.Strong demand for memory chips will continue through 2023 as supply is held in check not by shortages but judicious capex spend. The strong demand for memory chips such as 5G, servers, and EVs present a continuing tailwind for Micron Technology."" - THIS AND MORE FROM HIS POST."
"Listened to the chat. I see all the folks that cannot listen to information and be subjective hear what they want to hear. Positive and negative. Although there was not much negative there were comments made that made me think. At one point there was talk of a two quarter wash (catch up….so to speak) ….. wouldn’t that delay full earnings or spread the earnings thin over those two quarters?If that’s the case and it might be, the full earnings projections may not be realized. Food for thought."

RSI is 34 . . . meaning very close to oversold territory. We are due for a big pop: much of this drop has been overblown. MS sees pricing as cyclical vs seasonal. Big difference. Other analysts see it the other way around. We don't know when this stock is going to bounce.

"all the signals point to a significant price jump, the question is when??? Successive sequential earning beats will do it. Next reporting beginning of October in my view."
Micron is undervalued. Buy the dip.
"As long as MU is doing what its competitors can do, the share price will not go up much. Yes, the company is making good profit but so are its competitors. The overall market is good for all semiconductor companies. But you need that game-changing product to break thru the barrier, which unfortunately they simply don’t have at this moment. The fact that they abolished 3D xpoint proved that they failed to break thru. Look at AMD now. Its share price is 2x of Intel. Why?? Coz it has way more superior product in its lineup and so it’s their future launches in the next 1-2 years."
"TrendForce put out a new NAND report today titled ""NAND Flash Revenue for 2Q21 Rises by 10.8% QoQ Due to Strong Notebook Demand and Procurements for Data Centers"".The most interesting passage for me is this though:""Furthermore, notebook demand is expected to remain at a fairly high level in 3Q21, thereby sustaining NAND Flash demand bit growth and the ongoing rise in contract prices of NAND Flash products. Hence, TrendForce currently forecasts that the quarterly total NAND Flash revenue will not only again register a QoQ increase but also hit a record high for 3Q21.""The passage about high notebook demand directly contradicts their claims about slowing demand in consumer PCs they put out in their DRAM report. Makes it pretty hard to trust them."

"【Market View】Server DRAM Prices Expected to Rise by 5-10% QoQ in 3Q21 Due to Peak Season, Says TrendForcePublished Aug.11 2021,14:42 PM (GMT+8)Server DRAM Prices Expected to Rise by 5-10% QoQ in 3Q21 Due to Peak Season, Says TrendForceSuppliers and clients in the server DRAM market are still having difficulty in reaching agreements on prices for 3Q21 contracts even though the quarter is well underway, according to TrendForce’s latest investigations. Hence, server DRAM contract prices are much more varied than before. Regarding the price trend in July, contract quotes for the mainstream 32GB RDIMMs rose by 5-7% MoM. However, the price hikes have led to a reduction in demand, and there are indications that server DRAM sales bits will register some decline for 3Q21. The release of server CPUs based on the new platforms is driving the procurement of higher-density 64GB RDIMMs, but this has not resulted in a significant corresponding increase in content per unit. The general trend for buyers is to replace two 32GB modules with one 64GB module, rather than a one-to-one replacement as DRAM suppliers previously expected. Contract prices of 64GB RDIMMs rose by 5-7% MoM for July, though prices were below this range for some transactions.TrendForce’s analysis shows that server DRAM suppliers and buyers are finding it difficult to reach a consensus on prices because DRAM suppliers expect that the demand for server DRAM modules is going to surge in 3Q21 as the third quarter is the traditional peak season for the server market. As well, suppliers also anticipate that the adoption of new server processor platforms will increase the memory content in servers. With a more optimistic demand outlook, suppliers have adjusted their product mixes to allocate more of their production capacity to server DRAM. Hence, the supply fulfilment rate has risen significantly in the server DRAM market in 3Q21. Server DRAM buyers, on the other hand, already have a high level of inventory. Clients in the data center segment were aggressively stockpiling during the first half of this year due to worries about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the supply chain. They now need some time to consume their inventories and are reluctant to procure more DRAM modules.Contract prices will be constrained to rise further in 4Q21 as demand side has turned conservativeCurrently, enterprise server OEMs in North America have finished arranging their quarterly contracts, whereas numerous cloud service providers and Chinese enterprise server OEMs are still in the midst of negotiations. TrendForce believes that, in order to reach their targets for sales and shipments, server DRAM suppliers may be willing to cut more “special deals” for server DRAM products in August. Specifically, suppliers will push for lock-in contracts that offer adjustable prices for fixed quantity.On the whole, the general behaviors of DRAM buyers with regards to procurement have changed noticeably form the first half of this year. As the demand related to servers, PCs, and other major applications slows down, the whole DRAM market will gradually shift to the state of oversupply. Since the DRAM market is an oligopoly, the major suppliers will still have a significant leverage in price negotiations. Quotes for server DRAM products could therefore rise further by 5-10% QoQ in 3Q21. However, given that prices have yet to be finalized for a substantial portion of 3Q21 contracts, the transaction volume is also very limited. This, in turn, will inevitably create a lot of uncertainties with respect to the price trend in 4Q21.https://www.dramexchange.com/WeeklyResearch/Post/2/11036.html"

All these positive articles and stock still can not gain momentum. Micron is in the middle of a technology boom and chip shortage. This will allow for several years of growth similar to the Facebook downgrade when the stock was having extreme growth does not add up whatsoever. Stay long!

"08/25/2021 - 14:07:00 - Western Digital Corp. is in advanced talks to merge with Japan's Kioxia Holdings Corp. , according to people familiar with the matter, in a deal that could be valued at more than $20 billion and further reorder the global chip industry.Long-running discussions between the companies have heated up in the past few weeks and they could reach agreement on a deal as early as mid-September, the people said. Western Digital would pay for the deal with stock and the combined company would likely be run by its Chief Executive, David Goeckeler , the people said.There's no guarantee Western Digital , which had a market value of around $19 billion Wednesday afternoon, will seal an agreement, and Kioxia could still opt for an initial public offering it had been planning or another combination.The Wall Street Journal reported in March that Western Digital and Micron Technology Inc. were examining potential deals with Kioxia, which makes NAND flash-memory chips used in smartphones, computer servers and other devices. Micron's interest has since cooled and Kioxia has been focused on discussions with Western Digital , which already has deep existing ties with the Japanese company.And MU just took a massive leap upwards. Bid now $75.46. About time something went the bulls way? Heh!"
"Hmm conundrum, do I believe trendforce or the company that's looking directly at the order book and inventory.

The imbalance is more on the supplier side than the healthier customer side of the equation.Analysts and investors have expressed concern that DRAM prices could suffer in the second half of the year as PC demand moderates from pandemic-era highs, particularly for the low-margin Chromebooks. Zinsner notes that Chromebooks and laptops represent a fairly small amount of DRAM content versus the higher-end cloud and automotive markets."

"But some could be due for a rebound.Quint Tatro, president at Joule Financial, said semiconductor stock Micron Technology looks best here.“There’s times when stocks are down and they clearly are value traps, and then there’s times when stocks are down and that’s when you’re supposed to add to the position, and I think Micron is one of those names,” Tatro said Friday.Micron has fallen nearly 30% from an April peak, a far sharper decline than the 3% drop for the SMH semiconductor ETF. Shares have also fallen 10% in the past month.“The stock has been hit because there’s been a lot of reports that we’re seeing a peak in the memory chip cycle ... That is someone who’s saying that we are topping out of people buying computers. I do not think that’s happening,” he said.Morgan Stanley on Thursday, for example, said “winter is coming” for the semiconductor space and that the industry looked to be late cycle, which presents a “challenging background” for future earnings growth.“So ultimately we have a stock that is down on that news, trading at six times — not 16 — six times forward earnings, and those earnings are set to rebound post-Covid about 100%,” Tatro said. “This is a name that has pulled back that you have an opportunity to buy on this weakness. I think it’s an incredible value here.”"
"So far the price action matches what we saw on Thursday with considerable selling pressure until about 11am, which just magically dries up at that point clearing the way for a reversal. Any bets on a repeat?"
"Seth, posting sweet talks from MU executives won’t help. What investors truly want is share price appreciation, not sweet talks. Did Jensen Huang and Lisa su sweet talked this much?"
"Holding up pretty well in pre-market. With MU being MU which one will we see today, pop on open followed by sharp decline or drop on open with slow recovery?"
"Morgan Stanley was about 2nd to the last who upgraded MU to buy on March 1. The day before his upgraded MU reached 92.94. Becasue of his upgrade it reached all tie high of 95.19 a week later. In other words, if anyone bought at his upgrade the best outcome was about 2%. He called ""BUY"" 92.94 telling it will go up to 115. Now at 74 He down graded that it will reach 75. Why does anybody listen to the worst analyst in Wall Street as far as memory industry sector is concerned?"

"If this is a cyclical stock I might be a bag holder for quite some time ( dead money) as I’m currently holding a loss. If it is not, then when will it change the current 6 month trend? I’ve heard arguments that this is no longer a “commodity stock. How many stellar ER’s have to roll in to get recognized as a great stock or has it already made that move last year? This product is in peak demand, right? My goodness, how far out does the forecast play into today’s price? I think I’d rather roll the dice day by day like Highlowsel and deal with what is right in front of me instead of the infinite factors of the future. Hold and hope feels pretty risky even though I think it’s a great company. I bought this as a position trade but didn’t have the discipline to get out. I guess I fell in love with the idea of what it could and should be. I sure would love to see this close that 74 gap and move that 20mda quickly."

"Make NO mistake; in that, MU is a different company than in the past. MU is leading in storage and memory technology and they are totally diversified in 5 different fields ( that are growing )than in the past. The world is changing and MU will be in the 100's in 2022 because the story is changing. Those living in the past will see their mistake as MU reports their results over the next 4 quarters. The dividend will increase in 2022, MU will buy their stock on the open market and MU will become a CASH generating machine. Remember MU has NET NO debt and Right now sells at 1.6 Book Value. Within 3-4 years MU will be selling at Book Value, paying over $1.00 dividend and growing. These facts are supported by the industry itself and MU is ahead of it's competition; which really is only 2 other companies. I hope the stock price goes lower because I will buy more MU stock. If you are a trader; short term could be rough, but long term investors will reap huge profits. When MU announces next quarterly results; the numbers and direction of MU, will paint a different picture. All you have to do is wait and see; but if you are impatient, just read what the company is saying: Over and Over they are repeating themselves and the numbers are there and will continue for at least the the next 5 years. The world has changed and MU is right in the wheelhouse of change and progress. Good luck to the longs in MU."

In Cloud, we're still seeing robust demand. On the enterprise front, which had been negatively impacted by COVID, we've seen things improve as more people migrate back to offices. On the Mobil front, I would characterize as stable right now but expect to see it get stronger in the second half of the year. On the automobile side and industrial business... that is very strong. We're struggling to keep up with that demand. On the consumer front, seeing a slowdown which is not surprising during the summer months. PC is mixed."" ""Inventory at suppliers is very low. On distribution side, inventories are low as well. On the consumer side, inventories are in good shape,"" he added."

Who in this chat recalled the Facebook downgrade after a record earnings report and that stock ran up 50% after the downgrade.

Sanjays mantra to build a lineal company not dependent on the ebbs and flows of the market and price of Dram. Once people realize this is happening at a faster pace that they think the stock will rise over $100. In my mind its a matter of time and ever growing sequential earnings will prove that. If your now down don't sell, Mu came back in 2018 after hitting $32 low, Mu may swing but its up to you to lose or gain with Mu. Impatient will lose the patient will win. People like Tom lose more than they win, they play day to day. Thanks. Look at the future all memory."
"I strongly believe that there will he huge correction on the market. As soon as FED decrease/cut buying bonds and other steps to conquer inflations - this will heavily hit the stocks market.

Maybe MU does not show good pricing now, it has better chance to go through possible correction. FED promised to reduce buying in the fall of the year. Just this news has made -1% of Nasdaq"

"Here's a little more details on the Deutsche Bank's PT reduction.Deutsche Bank Adjusts Micron Technology PT to $95 From $110, Maintains Buy Rating09:55 AM EDT, 08/30/2021 (MT Newswires) -- Deutsche Bank lowered its price target on Micron Technology (MU) to $95 from $110 on increased uncertainty around DRAM prices in the near term.According to the brokerage, the biggest debate lies with the investor's views of how server DRAM prices would move in the next few quarters. While the brokerage expects the server market to benefit from some demand tailwinds in the second half of 2022, it believes many investors are more bearish, given the historically cyclical nature of the memory market.Micron Technology (MU) has an average rating of Outperform and price targets ranging from $39 to $165, according to analysts polled by Capital IQ."
There is nothing wrong with MU except for some analysts with tunnel vision. This is a company with diversified products and services and had been reporting strong earnings for several years. Yet every time the price of the stock goes up these people starts bushing MU and keeps repeating the word cyclical and starts downgrading them. How can a stock with important products and services and strong fundamentals ever get rewarded. Years ago I had MU reporting strong earnings and great fundamentals but these people with tunnel vision were doing the same thing. I really don't understand why they are destroying a great company which should have been a triple digit stock five or six years ago. Nobody can predict the future but as long as they continue to innovate and deliver the sky is the limit for any company that can do that including MU and others out there. I hope that those who believe in this company have patience because I know that the best is yet to come. Good luck take care and stay safe everyone.

"Interesting tidbits from an August obituary column of the WSJ, on the recent passing of Allen Noble, an Idaho Potato farmer who provided seed money to the founders of MU.""When they were forming Micron Technology Inc. in the late 1970s, the founders of the Boise, Idaho, maker of semiconductors didn’t seek their initial funding from venture capitalists in Silicon Valley. Instead, they sat down with a potato farmer, a rancher and a building contractor in Idaho.The three men kicked in $300,000 of seed money for what is today a global producer of memory chips with a stock-market value of about $85 billion.One of those three early investors was Allen T. Noble, who died July 18 at his home in Boise. He was 92....At the time, Micron’s founders were working in the basement of a dentist’s office in Boise. The three initial funders saw the potential and then helped reel in another early financial backer, J.R. Simplot, the billionaire potato farmer who supplied McDonald’s Corp. with frozen french fries....Joseph Parkinson invited Mr. Noble, Thomas T. Nicholson and Ronald C. Yanke to lunch at a Boise restaurant. The three men showed “enormous courage” and “put everything they had at risk,” Mr. Parkinson said. As of mid-1984, their shareholdings in the company totaled 26%.""(Joseph Parkinson was a key founder of MU).I found the passage below very compelling:""Micron survived fierce price competition from Japanese rivals in the 1980s and today is one of the world’s three major makers of DRAM memory chips, along with Samsung Electronics Co. and SK Hynix Inc. of South Korea, said Dan Hutcheson, CEO of market research firm VLSI Research. Micron “proved America could compete in semiconductor manufacturing on cost,” said Mr. Hutcheson, who added that Mr. Noble understood the need to SQUEEZE COSTS in a COMMODITY MARKET. After all, he was a potato farmer."" (A few words were capitalized for emphasis purpose)."

"Memory needed for the processors---------The total microprocessor (MPU) market is on track to exceed US$100 billion for the first time ever this year, thanks to strong increases in cellphone application processor revenue, according to IC Insights.Microprocessor sales are maintaining strength in 2021 after climbing 16% last year in the midst of the global COVID-19 pandemic that drove up the world's reliance on the Internet during the pandemic, IC Insights indicated. Sales are forecast to grow 14% in 2021, which will lift the total microprocessor market to a record-high US$103.7 billion, compared to a 9% increase that was expected in January.IC Insights also raised its MPU unit growth forecast to 11% this year. MPU unit shipments are forecast to reach 2.5 billion units in 2021, with ASPs set to rise 4%.IC Insights also revised upward its five-year revenue forecast for MPUs to a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.1%, which will put sales volume at US$127.8 billion in 2025 compared to about US$90.7 billion in 2020.Increasing reliance on the Internet during the pandemic resulted in a strong wave of growth in large-screen, high-end smartphones - many of them being 5G handsets - which caused an upsurge of revenue for cellphone application processors in 2020, IC Insights said. Cellphone application processor sales are expected to strengthen and climb 34% in 2021 to US$35.7 billion, when unit shipments and ASPs will rise 11% and 20%, respectively.Sales of computer CPU microprocessors grew 14% in 2020 - the highest increase for this MPU market segment in 10 years, according to IC Insights. Portable personal computer demand shot up in 2020 because more workers, students and consumers needed Internet access while being isolated at home during the pandemic. Computer CPU processor sales are forecast to grow by a smaller 4% on year to a record high of nearly US$48.4 billion in 2021, when unit shipment growth will slow to 6% from 12% in 2020, IC Insights said.In the embedded processor segment, sales are forecast to surge 11% in 2021 partly because of some MPU shortages during the economic rebound this year, IC Insights noted. Sales of embedded MPUs, which cover a broad range of system applications such as the IoT, automotive, industrial, medical, consumer, telecom and networking equipment, are now expected to reach US$19.7 billion this year with unit shipments growing 12%, according to IC Insights."
Where does MU sit in the NAND space if the WDC/Kioxia merger does go through?How much market share will they possess? WDC at present has a small piece of the pie.
"Storage growth hasn't even moved yet .. what is happening is massive ------------How data is stored can make it a boon or a burden: Gone are the days when expanding data capacity just meant buying bigger hardware. There are now many means to that end. The Rethink Data report indicates that, in India, increased use of advanced data analytics and IoT devices to automatically gather data will skyrocket the amount of data stored over the next 2 years, with the highest proportion of respondents in India choosing the first factor (62%) while the global averaged at 48.3%; and the latter as the second biggest factor (53% in India). The complexity of choosing the right solution – be it cloud or on-premise storage – often leaves companies with an imperfect fit – making data a burden, rather than an asset.Both cloud and on-premises solutions have their strengths. Cloud offers the flexibility to create and host many applications. On-premises can offer better security, performance, and cost control. Savvy business leaders know combining the two via a hybrid model can offer the best of both worlds, but fewer appreciate the importance of moulding that hybrid according to their business needs. In fact, 22% of the organisations find it extremely challenging to decide what type of data to keep in what kind of environment – cloud, on-premise, edge, etc according to the Rethink Data survey.For instance, a company that needs to quickly build and update consumer applications may lean towards public cloud, but still wish to store sensitive consumer data on-premises. A videogame developer working with massive files may wish to prioritise the data transfer benefits of on-premises – but still wish to leverage cloud for customer support. To that end, the technology within an enterprise storage system needs to be designed to empower businesses in modern hybrid situations. These could include solutions like performance-optimising Automated Tiered Storage (ATS) software that enables a smooth automated data progression across different tiers of storage devices and media."
Looks like NVDA’s takeover of ARM is going to fail. MU needs to buy ARM on the rebound.
"I’m starting a rumor that mu has a PE of 12, and earnings are going up. Maybe will result in a dip in price. I wanta buy more, at a lower level."
"Hard to know what is up or down with the comment section here so much conflating all for the sake of making money, yes some of us are seeking the truth, we are not engineers or traders."
Just saw a notification that my $68.95 filled ….. out right here on that one. Unbelievable!!!!!A quick $2k plus. Market manipulation is beautiful. Ain’t it.
Just like I said months ago. Rhetoric about the cyclical nature works start. Downgrades and PT reductions. The progression of the narrative will soon be that the PE is too high followed by undisciplined capex followed by downgrades. Excellent time to buy but it could only be the start right now wait for the fervor of the sell action and the overshoot. This dump might take this much lower. Gap at $58 overshoot to mid $50s …..Especially if the market gets the traditional September correction.
"Honest question, shorter term, any reason I shouldn’t jump out here for a loss? I bought in before earnings and actually really liked the earnings and the company. Seems no love from the market. Financials look amazing but I’m at a loss here. AMD, NVDA look like market darlings for now."
"Will start a thread summarizing the BMO conference, expand to follow along."
The market must not have liked how MU's bid got away from them for a time yesterday afternoon. Because they are making a point of sitting on it right now. $72.83 and going nowhere fast...for now...
Tomorrow is the BMO Fireside chat. Wonder what the market reaction will be
"This market is setting up for a repeat of drop that occurred a few years back when we went into the down cycle for chips even though everyone knew full well that chips are no longer tied to Intel and AMD coming out with the new hot processors, and therefore everyone buying new computers. Computers are hardly driving the chip sector now, IOT and AI as well as large scale servers made the chip cycle obsolete. Yet trust me, the analysts will claim that we are about to enter one, so they can slash price targets to drive prices down across the sector to allow for their big money clients to pick up cheap shares before running them back up again, when they stop the false narratives."
More like $4.75 at current quarter consensus which would put the stock at a current ttm p/e of 15. We really need to get into the cheddar of the forward estimates. Average forward estimates are around $12 for 2022 with some as high as $16. That estimate would put it at a current 6 multiple. Will those earnings be realized?
"Chip maker Micron Technology has the highest implied upside on the list. The stock has underperformed the Nasdaq this year, down over 3% in 2021, but analysts see Micron rallying 63.6% in the next 12 months."
I am not sure why I continue to watch CNBC. Their four experts did a hot job in unison on Micron all based on the Morgan Stanley report. Not one had the guts to say something like the MS report is based on a potential downturn in a year or so. Not one repeated what the company just put out for guidance. Not one said anything about the reconfirming a buy and 105 price target two weeks ago. CNBC is beholding to MS and that is sad but explainable. They are part of the worst network on TV ....NBC.
UBS reiterates Micron as buyUBS raised its price target on shares of Micron to $110 from $100 and said the stock is well-positioned to take advantage of the “secular tail-winds” in memory
Deutsch cuts target from $110 to $95.
"Analysts and investors have expressed concern that DRAM prices could suffer in the second half of the year as PC demand moderates from pandemic-era highs, particularly for the low-margin Chromebooks. Zinsner notes that Chromebooks and laptops represent a fairly small amount of DRAM content versus the higher-end cloud and automotive markets.Today is a great buying opportunity!"
"I’m sorry to see yet once more this company’s stock alienate yet another set of would be investors. The management of MU should be concerned yet again. Investor relations should be disbanded in its current form. Impotent best describes that office. Management needs to take the lead on rebuffing this type of action with decisive counter action. Call these guys out! Even if it’s a reiteration of previously public statements at the time of a move such as the latest from MS. I have written these folks at IR. Yet again!Another set of bag holders….. investors waiting to break even to sell what they see as a manipulated paper. Way to go MS UBS COWEN etc …. oh wait I almost left out the most important MU management. Complicit by inaction!!That said if you’re hip to this traders/ pump and dump scheme you can stack up the coin. Just feeling bad for all the newbies.I warned, rung the gong when it was at the recent top."
The July contract prices are updated on DRAM Exchange and look pretty good.
"Was pointed out to me that UBS had lowered their price target from $120 to $110 in July, but I can find zero reference saying the raised it again today. Anyone have actual confirmation of that?"
We raise this week. Motelyfool/Zacks/SeekingAlpha pumping already started. $78 by end of the week.
"Tell me again why NVDA is a better company than MU? Micron makes significantly more money, and even with NVDAs perceived growth, that will get them to what, MUs earnings?Yet it trades at least 4-5x the multiple of NVDA. Isn’t MU memory a key component of NVDAs products? Nobody cares about the memory that drives every tech company?"
"For what it's worth. Just saw an article from Market Watch.Stocks left behind in 2021 that may have great potential for investorsThrough Aug. 25, 58 of the S&P 500 components were down for 2021. Among those stocks, 33 have majority “buy” ratings among analysts polled by FactSet. Here are the 20 that the analysts expect to perform the best over the next 12 months, along with their forward price-to-earnings ratios.If you're interested, so see for yourself. MU is at the least. Who would think Qualcomm was also left behind?"
"I have held this stock for a long time. I have never had any intention of selling it, but over the years I have paid close attention to any news regarding it. I swear to you, the analysts ""professional"" opinions regarding MU is on a 2 or 3-year-groundhog day cycle. Year one, the analysts will say that it is cheap, a fantastic company, and has great future prospects. MU, typically, delivers on exactly that premise. Then, around the end of year two or year two+, the same analysts pile on MU about how it is not innovative and only produces is simple commodity that anyone else can do for less. They all say it is a sell or are neutral about it. I have seen this play out four or five times. I have just learned to drown out the noise of the analysts regarding MU. I maintain my core position and add to it on any significant dips. Why? Because this is a great company that has learned to be nimble in rapidly changing times. And...most importantly...MU is in an industry that is ESSENTIAL to our modern way of life. The analysts are right about many things...but, they have, collectively, become the boy crying wolf with regard to MU. I don't listen to that boy anymore. I just sit back and keep faith in the long-term prospects of this fantastic company just as I have done for quite a few years. You guys will have to make up your own minds with regard to what you think. But, that is my two cents. Have a great weekend and stay safe!"

Niko...you hanging on to those 72’s? What’s your game plan? Just trying to get some idea of what your sentiment is on the big position.
"MU pps goes to $100 by year end. ""Now Micron has introduced the first automotive-qualified portfolio of Universal Flash Storage 3.1 memory devices, the same memory smartphones use."""
I’m thinking $75 might happen today
I had a dream where Nividia bought MU giving cash and shares adding MU earnings to their bottom line and heading to $600 again. You can dream right!
"not a commodity although the price fluctuation may imply that, DRAM highly sophisticated piece of equipment with patents and proprietary ownership and becoming more specialized that only a few can make. It has become a specialized market unlike a commodity market."
"Not a great night of news for semis. Marvell said to have ""weaker"" outlook (it is really?) and Ford cutting production due to more chip shortage problems."
"consolidation is always good, less competition, more stable prices .. considering WDC doesnt have the cash , this will be stock-debt transaction ... so WDC - Kioxia will carry decent debt while MU is cash net positive ... which mean WDC will limit capex ----> less NAND competition ... MU wins"
Tom just died of an aneurysm. Thoughts and prayers please
Next Q ER should bring trailing 12 month EPS up to $6 x current PE of 20 = 120 PPSLoad up here.
"How come there is no single headline about the major upgrade, UBS raising (if true) target price 10% contrary to the general sour mood towards memory"
"NO news, fundamentals strong and getting stronger, no debt, free cash flow increasing, leading edge technology and proprietary software, yet a little man named Moore created all this because of one mans opinion. Yes Wall Street is rigged."
"So HP and Dell see strong demand for PC’s, backlogs and persistence through 2022. Doesn’t jive with the MS hitpiece hmmmm."
What a great BMO presentation . MU is printing tendies. Letssss go
Hello Any one is listening to MU's presentation now at BMO summit. Can you post the link. Thank you.
WowThe volume went from 15M to 23M in a few minutes. Someone bought 7M-8M shares in one swoop. Could that be Micron?
"Let us see what MU says at BMO Summit this coming Tuesday (August 24th) around 8 am (PST). Let us see we get a great pop on Tuesday. Also, next month Apple will give a great insight regarding I -phone 13 sale. Let us stay focused and see the good results in our favor."
Can MU push up to a $75 close in the last hour on a Friday?
"Management should announce that they bought back shares today, that will be a positive statement"
Oh boy
"There's little doubt in my mind, that Morgan Stanley led the downgrade charge to accumulate cheaper shares. Let's not forget this, and carefully watch to see who accumulated heavily this quarter. In my view."
Back to $80 by next week!!!
All these articles for months in a row now discussing how Micron is undervalued and a great long term investment.
This is unfairly beaten down. Definitely one of the best stocks to buy in this inflated market.
Wow long buyers are really scared to hold at this level...
Looks like all peers down cept TSM. Not a bad day for all good longs.
UBS LOWERED PT from $110 to $100. The person that posted earlier had it backwards. Don't believe anything you read on here it's all BS
All the dumped shares had been bought by some institutions at 70. They wouldn't sit on them and they haven't bought it just for a max of 5% profit. So I would expect at some point the new share holders to change the narrative to be able to raise the price. Any opinions?
"As many long time holders know, MU historically preannounces sales beats a month before earnings. They also know this usually results in a swift but short-lived (in other words, tradeable) pop to the stock price. We are at that spot on the calendar right now. If MU is going to preannounce, it will be this week. Monday might be a good time to buy a little extra with the intent to sell by Friday if there is no preannouncement."
I listened to Zinsner talk and I could not see anything negative. At the end he said there will be pockets of cyclicity but overall he was very positive. He even said that weakness in low end laptop/tablet demand will be offset by Enterprise growth. Short term investors and those on Margin may be feeling the pinch but I think for the long term this stock is no brainer
"DDR5 create multiyear upgrade in enterprise, datacenters, home PC, laptops, mobile ... the amount of devices to be replaced and upgraded is mind-blowing. MU will get to $40Billion revenue by 2024 ( if not even by end of next year )"
And there's the attack. Right on time just before the half hour mark...from ~$71.40 to ~$70.80 in about 4 minutes time. Since I was expecting it I'm riding it with a tactical short...now down with the trailing. I'll look to flip when it gets hit. G/L!
Back to $80 in two weeks!!!
"Stay long, MU will double within 3 years. Don't believe me, consider this...Price Aug 2021: $70Price Dec 2018: $35Price Dec 2015: $15Price Dec 2012: $6.5Also, with an $80B market cap, it is not hard to see how a slight uptick in memory demand from something like 5G phones or self-driving cars could accelerate that time table to 2 years or even less."
Don’t worry this is only a test. The likes of MS UBS COWEN GS abs the MMs are just checking to see where the company thinks its intrinsic value is. Knock it into the dirt and see where management starts buying. Additionally many undisclosed short positions are being unwound before the due date for dividend. I wouldn’t be surprised to see this paper trade in a totally different manner post the first dividend action. We’ll all have to wait and see but keep it in mind. November on this might be a whole different animal. Maybe the New MU.
I'm clearly missing the huge market rally by holding 100K position in this stock that so far gives me a return of only 16% in 3 years :( when do you think the next upcycle is? Hope it happens first before a major market correction
"Just remember these 2 statements from the earnings CC:1. From Sanjay (CEO); Micron now has the discipline to walk away from competitive pricing situations to maintain our margins. This is due to supply growing slower than demand.2. From the CFO: We will be ""aggressively"" buying our shares anytime we see the intrinsic of our shares fall below our FCF generation.Listen to the CC yourself from their website. Then decide if you want to trust MS. There's going to be a lot of analyst and TV talking heads with mud on their face if they got this call wrong. We will see who's right."
"Micron shareholder will do good remember the word ""oligopoly"" (limited competition). That's what David Tepper said about MU back in 2019, that MU has been in good shape because the pool of producers of memory and NAND flash is reducing. NAND flash storage constitute about 30% of MU products. WDC buying Kioxia will bring down competition in flash storage, and will benefit WDC and MU, more for WDC."
"""Cyclical nature"" of semis / MU in particular is nothing new; just would have hoped that the death knell of the cycle would not be predestined as much as a year - possibly more - before the projected peak"
"Massive WDC deal strikes a bullish signal for the memory market. Negates the bear case that the memory market is boom-bust cycle, which is the only thing holding MU back. Maybe we'll see a short squeeze here that pushes MU above 85."
MU will earn 11 billion dollars for FY22 year. Its market cap is only 79 billions without net debt. Are you kidding me? MU is screaming buy for long term holding.
"Gonna be buybacks tomorrow. After earnings, mu is going in the 80s. Gotta get them cheap shares before earnings."
I sold at loss and moved t o TSM and SAVA - GL
"going red at some point today, although may not close there. have to ask yourself how you can ever get to $100 stock with massive selling pressure every day at $70 after it's already fallen 30%"
Tom hope you're ok?
"I can't help but get the feeling that there are people/ institurions/ hedge funds that REALLY want to get their positions in MU on the cheap side, Seeking Alpha keeps regurgitating the TrendForce B.S. propaganda, while any reiteration of analysts that are forecasting SIGNICANTLY HIGHER PT's is virtually non existent.5G is coming like a runaway train and the number of devices that are going to be linked to 5G that will require memory is going to be numbering in the BILLIONS leaving the semiconductor and memory sectors on track for exponential growth which is... IMHO why they are publishing agenda driven B. S. propaganda hit pieces, not only on MU, but QCOM, TSM and a few others. It's called misdirection folks, don't fall for the incessant drone of their noise!!!"
"Holy cow, Taiwan semiconductor are HIKING chip prices by @)% plus! Super plus!"
Wow SK Hynix and Samsung up 3%. With chip shortages memory prices are very likely to stabilize here.
"I listened to the interview, not the best BUT he managed to articulate some good clear points:1. Strong Free cash flow increase 2. Higher cost is due to higher spec so higher prices and higher margin 3. Future revenue stream products machine learning and 5 G Very very boring, but he touched the 3 most important ""made up concerns"" IMO"
"WDC deal and TSM price raise are bullish signals for the memory space. Further proof that memory is no longer a boom-bust cycle, which negates the supply glut bear case that has been pressuring MU to a 5x forward PE."
NVDA said will buy all memory chips can get from Micron next year. Demand is as high as Snoop on Sunday night
"Here's Morgan Stanley's clarification:""We share feedback on our recent downgrade of MU to EW with a $75 target, highlighting in the process why we continue to be more optimistic on WDC and semicap.On August 11 we downgraded MU from Overweight to Equal-eight and lowered our price target from $105 to $75 (see - Memory – Winter Is Coming). We recap the feedback we have heard from investors below: We spoke to more than 40 investors since the downgrade and overall, we received relatively little pushback from our Micron downgrade itself, but somewhat more over the dire ""winter is coming"" headline, and several questions about the impact on NAND and semicap equipment. In most of our conversations, investors agreed with our view that DRAM was seeing some turbulence, though we heard a variety of views on how severe the weakness would be. We highlighted in our note that despite our concerns around DRAM fundamentals, we believe that the company has made significant improvements and is well positioned to emerge from this downturn in a stronger position than they have in past cycles. Investors largely agreed with this assertion. Quick summary of our views: We went to EW the stock, at a $75 price target; it is not a sell call (in contrast to our colleague Shawn Kim's Underweight view on Hynix). Our concern is that inventory buildup across multiple end markets appears to have plateaued, and with minor price declines in PC and server DRAM on the horizon, customers will be highly reluctant to add more inventory. In a semiconductor cycle where the bull case is framed by restocking to an elevated level - moving from just-in-time to just-in-case - the large customer concentration, historic price unpredictability, and customer inventory focus make DRAM a suboptimal way to play those trends.Having said that, we also acknowledge that producers including Micron have very lean inventories, that price declines thus far are very moderate."""

5G phones require 6x more DRAM than 4G phones. The demand is there. This is also the only DRAM company in the West. I see this shedding its cyclical nature and being rock solid heading toward $200/share in a couple years.
"I think it’s hilarious....inside the same investment research firm, one analyst says to sell mu and contain the losses. Another says to buy, as selling was overdone. I’m sticking with mu. Admittedly, it could get rough in a market correction, but I will buy more if/when it happens."
I heard about MU the other day on (http://Rightpicker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
"Micron’s 176L 3D NAND is the world’s first 176L 3D NAND Flash memory. TechInsights just found the 512Gb 176L die (B47R die markings) and quickly viewed its process, structure, and die design. Micron 176L 3D NAND is one of the most groundbreaking technologies to date, and it is especially for the storage application such as data center, 5G, AI, cloud, intelligent edge, and mobile devices.

"Nice pop right into a face plant. Sell side came out in force at dropped that bid from +$73.50 to +$72.80 in about 3 minutes time. They used ~600K shares to do it, too. I guess it's their way of serving notice? So much for the first 10 minutes. Let's see how the remaining 7hrs and ~40 minutes go. G/L! Bid now $72.86."
"Nice to see this slow and steady rise, never trust the quick morning spikes."
