5G phones require 6x more DRAM than 4G phones. The demand is there. This is also the only DRAM company in the West. I see this shedding its cyclical nature and being rock solid heading toward $200/share in a couple years.
"TrendForce put out a new NAND report today titled ""NAND Flash Revenue for 2Q21 Rises by 10.8% QoQ Due to Strong Notebook Demand and Procurements for Data Centers"".The most interesting passage for me is this though:""Furthermore, notebook demand is expected to remain at a fairly high level in 3Q21, thereby sustaining NAND Flash demand bit growth and the ongoing rise in contract prices of NAND Flash products. Hence, TrendForce currently forecasts that the quarterly total NAND Flash revenue will not only again register a QoQ increase but also hit a record high for 3Q21.""The passage about high notebook demand directly contradicts their claims about slowing demand in consumer PCs they put out in their DRAM report. Makes it pretty hard to trust them."
"not a commodity although the price fluctuation may imply that, DRAM highly sophisticated piece of equipment with patents and proprietary ownership and becoming more specialized that only a few can make. It has become a specialized market unlike a commodity market."
"Here's a little more details on the Deutsche Bank's PT reduction.Deutsche Bank Adjusts Micron Technology PT to $95 From $110, Maintains Buy Rating09:55 AM EDT, 08/30/2021 (MT Newswires) -- Deutsche Bank lowered its price target on Micron Technology (MU) to $95 from $110 on increased uncertainty around DRAM prices in the near term.According to the brokerage, the biggest debate lies with the investor's views of how server DRAM prices would move in the next few quarters. While the brokerage expects the server market to benefit from some demand tailwinds in the second half of 2022, it believes many investors are more bearish, given the historically cyclical nature of the memory market.Micron Technology (MU) has an average rating of Outperform and price targets ranging from $39 to $165, according to analysts polled by Capital IQ."
Deutsch cuts target from $110 to $95.
"MU is ready to bust out the major upside! Another one of my major positions, TSM just popped BIG this morning. MU will be following especially given its highly undervalued stock price vis a vis its peers. This one has built a solid base and is finally ready to rock and roar back into the high $70’s possibly back over the $80 level in the coming days and week ahead. Watch and see. A major short squeeze is brewing and coming soon."
"Anyone noticed how the machines seem to take the bid, in the first 30 of every session, ~$1 in the direction opposite the one seen in PM?"
I'm clearly missing the huge market rally by holding 100K position in this stock that so far gives me a return of only 16% in 3 years :( when do you think the next upcycle is? Hope it happens first before a major market correction
"I’m starting a rumor that mu has a PE of 12, and earnings are going up. Maybe will result in a dip in price. I wanta buy more, at a lower level."
"So HP and Dell see strong demand for PC’s, backlogs and persistence through 2022. Doesn’t jive with the MS hitpiece hmmmm."
"Ina:I muted Tom, Halo Jones and Niko just like you suggested, Thanks."
"There's little doubt in my mind, that Morgan Stanley led the downgrade charge to accumulate cheaper shares. Let's not forget this, and carefully watch to see who accumulated heavily this quarter. In my view."
MU is undervalued and will bounce back to $100 before end of this year !!
"Listened to the chat. I see all the folks that cannot listen to information and be subjective hear what they want to hear. Positive and negative. Although there was not much negative there were comments made that made me think. At one point there was talk of a two quarter wash (catch up….so to speak) ….. wouldn’t that delay full earnings or spread the earnings thin over those two quarters?If that’s the case and it might be, the full earnings projections may not be realized. Food for thought."
"make a little juice folks#1 rated undervalued stock on the Exchange, and it ant going lower."
"besides my upcoming note on BMO conf,THIS COULD BE THE BOLT ON MICRON IN THE LAST 10 MINUTESNAND WILL CONSOLIDATE MASSIVELYYAY!!!*Western Digital in Advanced Talks to Merge With Kioxia in $20 Billion-Plus Deal, Sources Say2:06pm ET 8/25/2021 Dow JonesStock deal could be finalized as early as the middle of September, according to people familiar with the matterhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/western-digital-in-advanced-talks-to-merge-with-kioxia-in-20-billion-plus-deal-11629914820?mod=searchresults_pos1&page=1by end sept !!this is big news and fast!!this will put in plain focus the sweet spot THAT IS digital memory.DRAM already a secure oligopoly...AND NAND has NOW consolidatedremember NAND is only 25% of Micron (rest DRAM) but more imp this deal illustrates:DIGITAL MEMORY IS THE SWEET SPOT IN THE SEMI CONDUCTOR SPACEAND THIS DEAL IS THE EMERGENCE OF MR MARKETS REALISATION(of what I have said for 3 yrs)this is huge news for the digital memory suppliersas for 'winter is coming'rumours of the early winter are highly exaggerated.LOL !!!"
"Micron shareholder will do good remember the word ""oligopoly"" (limited competition). That's what David Tepper said about MU back in 2019, that MU has been in good shape because the pool of producers of memory and NAND flash is reducing. NAND flash storage constitute about 30% of MU products. WDC buying Kioxia will bring down competition in flash storage, and will benefit WDC and MU, more for WDC."
How do you have a $2m share purchase push price to .94 and within minutes it back to .49?
"I listened to the interview, not the best BUT he managed to articulate some good clear points:1. Strong Free cash flow increase 2. Higher cost is due to higher spec so higher prices and higher margin 3. Future revenue stream products machine learning and 5 G Very very boring, but he touched the 3 most important ""made up concerns"" IMO"
Good week for MU up about $6 or 9% since bottom this week. Hopefully we can build back towards $85 by earnings release.
"08/24/2021 - 04:59:00 - Here are the 10 Cheapest Stocks in the S&P 500 - (I'll just show the one)There are still plenty of cheap stocks, even with the major indexes near record highs.Barron's screened the S&P 500 index and identified the 10 stocks with the lowest price-to-earnings ratios using 2022 profit projections, based on FactSet data.The 10 least expensive companies include memory-chip makers Micron Technology (ticker: MU) and.....Why are the stocks so inexpensive?Some like Viatris and Organon have ample, but manageable debt. Investors fear that profits may be peaking at companies like Micron, Lyondell, and Western Digital . These concerns could be creating opportunities for investors. Micron, whose shares trade around $70 , recently initiated a small dividend resulting in an 0.6% yield. J.P.

"Memory needed for the processors---------The total microprocessor (MPU) market is on track to exceed US$100 billion for the first time ever this year, thanks to strong increases in cellphone application processor revenue, according to IC Insights.Microprocessor sales are maintaining strength in 2021 after climbing 16% last year in the midst of the global COVID-19 pandemic that drove up the world's reliance on the Internet during the pandemic, IC Insights indicated. Sales are forecast to grow 14% in 2021, which will lift the total microprocessor market to a record-high US$103.7 billion, compared to a 9% increase that was expected in January.IC Insights also raised its MPU unit growth forecast to 11% this year. MPU unit shipments are forecast to reach 2.5 billion units in 2021, with ASPs set to rise 4%.IC Insights also revised upward its five-year revenue forecast for MPUs to a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.1%, which will put sales volume at US$127.8 billion in 2025 compared to about US$90.7 billion in 2020.Increasing reliance on the Internet during the pandemic resulted in a strong wave of growth in large-screen, high-end smartphones - many of them being 5G handsets - which caused an upsurge of revenue for cellphone application processors in 2020, IC Insights said. Cellphone application processor sales are expected to strengthen and climb 34% in 2021 to US$35.7 billion, when unit shipments and ASPs will rise 11% and 20%, respectively.Sales of computer CPU microprocessors grew 14% in 2020 - the highest increase for this MPU market segment in 10 years, according to IC Insights. Portable personal computer demand shot up in 2020 because more workers, students and consumers needed Internet access while being isolated at home during the pandemic. Computer CPU processor sales are forecast to grow by a smaller 4% on year to a record high of nearly US$48.4 billion in 2021, when unit shipment growth will slow to 6% from 12% in 2020, IC Insights said.In the embedded processor segment, sales are forecast to surge 11% in 2021 partly because of some MPU shortages during the economic rebound this year, IC Insights noted. Sales of embedded MPUs, which cover a broad range of system applications such as the IoT, automotive, industrial, medical, consumer, telecom and networking equipment, are now expected to reach US$19.7 billion this year with unit shipments growing 12%, according to IC Insights."
Love reading delusional short comments. Shorts will pay the piper BIG TIME this week when MU explodes further to the Upside. Watch and learn.
"""Cyclical nature"" of semis / MU in particular is nothing new; just would have hoped that the death knell of the cycle would not be predestined as much as a year - possibly more - before the projected peak"
"If this is a cyclical stock I might be a bag holder for quite some time ( dead money) as I’m currently holding a loss. If it is not, then when will it change the current 6 month trend? I’ve heard arguments that this is no longer a “commodity stock. How many stellar ER’s have to roll in to get recognized as a great stock or has it already made that move last year? This product is in peak demand, right? My goodness, how far out does the forecast play into today’s price? I think I’d rather roll the dice day by day like Highlowsel and deal with what is right in front of me instead of the infinite factors of the future. Hold and hope feels pretty risky even though I think it’s a great company. I bought this as a position trade but didn’t have the discipline to get out. I guess I fell in love with the idea of what it could and should be. I sure would love to see this close that 74 gap and move that 20mda quickly."
"From today's Barron article:Micron, whose shares trade around $70, recently initiated a small dividend resulting in an 0.6% yield. J.P.

"Interesting tidbits from an August obituary column of the WSJ, on the recent passing of Allen Noble, an Idaho Potato farmer who provided seed money to the founders of MU.""When they were forming Micron Technology Inc. in the late 1970s, the founders of the Boise, Idaho, maker of semiconductors didn’t seek their initial funding from venture capitalists in Silicon Valley. Instead, they sat down with a potato farmer, a rancher and a building contractor in Idaho.The three men kicked in $300,000 of seed money for what is today a global producer of memory chips with a stock-market value of about $85 billion.One of those three early investors was Allen T. Noble, who died July 18 at his home in Boise. He was 92....At the time, Micron’s founders were working in the basement of a dentist’s office in Boise. The three initial funders saw the potential and then helped reel in another early financial backer, J.R. Simplot, the billionaire potato farmer who supplied McDonald’s Corp. with frozen french fries....Joseph Parkinson invited Mr. Noble, Thomas T. Nicholson and Ronald C. Yanke to lunch at a Boise restaurant. The three men showed “enormous courage” and “put everything they had at risk,” Mr. Parkinson said. As of mid-1984, their shareholdings in the company totaled 26%.""(Joseph Parkinson was a key founder of MU).I found the passage below very compelling:""Micron survived fierce price competition from Japanese rivals in the 1980s and today is one of the world’s three major makers of DRAM memory chips, along with Samsung Electronics Co. and SK Hynix Inc. of South Korea, said Dan Hutcheson, CEO of market research firm VLSI Research. Micron “proved America could compete in semiconductor manufacturing on cost,” said Mr. Hutcheson, who added that Mr. Noble understood the need to SQUEEZE COSTS in a COMMODITY MARKET. After all, he was a potato farmer."" (A few words were capitalized for emphasis purpose)."
"Chip maker Micron Technology has the highest implied upside on the list. The stock has underperformed the Nasdaq this year, down over 3% in 2021, but analysts see Micron rallying 63.6% in the next 12 months."
"As many long time holders know, MU historically preannounces sales beats a month before earnings. They also know this usually results in a swift but short-lived (in other words, tradeable) pop to the stock price. We are at that spot on the calendar right now. If MU is going to preannounce, it will be this week. Monday might be a good time to buy a little extra with the intent to sell by Friday if there is no preannouncement."
Deutsche Bank reiterated their buy rating but lowered their PT to $95 down from $110.
"08/25/2021 - 14:07:00 - Western Digital Corp. is in advanced talks to merge with Japan's Kioxia Holdings Corp. , according to people familiar with the matter, in a deal that could be valued at more than $20 billion and further reorder the global chip industry.Long-running discussions between the companies have heated up in the past few weeks and they could reach agreement on a deal as early as mid-September, the people said. Western Digital would pay for the deal with stock and the combined company would likely be run by its Chief Executive, David Goeckeler , the people said.There's no guarantee Western Digital , which had a market value of around $19 billion Wednesday afternoon, will seal an agreement, and Kioxia could still opt for an initial public offering it had been planning or another combination.The Wall Street Journal reported in March that Western Digital and Micron Technology Inc. were examining potential deals with Kioxia, which makes NAND flash-memory chips used in smartphones, computer servers and other devices. Micron's interest has since cooled and Kioxia has been focused on discussions with Western Digital , which already has deep existing ties with the Japanese company.And MU just took a massive leap upwards. Bid now $75.46. About time something went the bulls way? Heh!"
I am wondering how much Morgan Stanley added in after people sold at around $69.0.
The July contract prices are updated on DRAM Exchange and look pretty good.
"Here's Morgan Stanley's clarification:""We share feedback on our recent downgrade of MU to EW with a $75 target, highlighting in the process why we continue to be more optimistic on WDC and semicap.On August 11 we downgraded MU from Overweight to Equal-eight and lowered our price target from $105 to $75 (see - Memory – Winter Is Coming). We recap the feedback we have heard from investors below: We spoke to more than 40 investors since the downgrade and overall, we received relatively little pushback from our Micron downgrade itself, but somewhat more over the dire ""winter is coming"" headline, and several questions about the impact on NAND and semicap equipment. In most of our conversations, investors agreed with our view that DRAM was seeing some turbulence, though we heard a variety of views on how severe the weakness would be. We highlighted in our note that despite our concerns around DRAM fundamentals, we believe that the company has made significant improvements and is well positioned to emerge from this downturn in a stronger position than they have in past cycles. Investors largely agreed with this assertion. Quick summary of our views: We went to EW the stock, at a $75 price target; it is not a sell call (in contrast to our colleague Shawn Kim's Underweight view on Hynix). Our concern is that inventory buildup across multiple end markets appears to have plateaued, and with minor price declines in PC and server DRAM on the horizon, customers will be highly reluctant to add more inventory. In a semiconductor cycle where the bull case is framed by restocking to an elevated level - moving from just-in-time to just-in-case - the large customer concentration, historic price unpredictability, and customer inventory focus make DRAM a suboptimal way to play those trends.Having said that, we also acknowledge that producers including Micron have very lean inventories, that price declines thus far are very moderate."""
"Nice pop right into a face plant. Sell side came out in force at dropped that bid from +$73.50 to +$72.80 in about 3 minutes time. They used ~600K shares to do it, too. I guess it's their way of serving notice? So much for the first 10 minutes. Let's see how the remaining 7hrs and ~40 minutes go. G/L! Bid now $72.86."
"MU needs a lot of help, the company is fine the stock has no real buyers to hold the price up thats why it sinks daily"
Dank Collart ( WU Bank) cut price target MU $ 80 to $65
"For what it's worth. Just saw an article from Market Watch.Stocks left behind in 2021 that may have great potential for investorsThrough Aug. 25, 58 of the S&P 500 components were down for 2021. Among those stocks, 33 have majority “buy” ratings among analysts polled by FactSet. Here are the 20 that the analysts expect to perform the best over the next 12 months, along with their forward price-to-earnings ratios.If you're interested, so see for yourself. MU is at the least. Who would think Qualcomm was also left behind?"
"consolidation is always good, less competition, more stable prices .. considering WDC doesnt have the cash , this will be stock-debt transaction ... so WDC - Kioxia will carry decent debt while MU is cash net positive ... which mean WDC will limit capex ----> less NAND competition ... MU wins"
"When the CFO says their business outlook is strong, then Morgan Stanley comes out and says the opposite, you know it's a hit piece. Props to anyone who doubled down on the sell-off."
