"UDC has no debt. Therefore, borrowing costs are not applicable to the valuation when considering increasing rates. The economy is strong and the consumer is buying TVs, phones etc all with oled. I think this stock is just caught up in the ETFs and the frenzy when looking solely at increasing rates as a reason to decrease valuation. Am I missing something or is this a buying opportunity with such a good forward PE?"

"OLED holds many patents whether they make oled screens for a particular company or not. Tech is not popular at present, but OLED is a long-term buy at these prices."

We should learn a bit from Apple earnings today yet I think OLED can get over indexed to iPhone sales. LG OLED tv sales were great and we should be seeing more momentum from that news too. $250 pps by February...
"We are in the early innings of OLED display massive growth.....the current revenue shortfall is solely on the Pandemic supply chain disruptions .....this is a temporary event...this is a huge buying opportunity for OLED shares.......I will keep adding at these prices and wait long term.........I have been on OLED since it was PANL at 6 bucks a share.........and I have seen these short term stock dives on temporary revenue shortfalls, and I have always made lots of money buying these opportunites.......just don't buy with money you will need in the next year or two........"

"slowly we turned, step by step, inch by inch..."
"Benjo thanks for the bump up, we can always count on you to be absolutely wrong."
Is that 189 AH price real or memorex?
"I repeat, this is going down big time. Not worth the risk over $100 now. Peaked !"
"Benjo, Rich, where you guys at? Still waiting for that large drop you guys keep talking about...."
Look at this ....OLED deals skyrocketted in September.OLED jumps very high whenever this happens...been tracking for last couple years.Previous quarter there very very less deals and OLED tanked.https://slickdeals.net/newsearch.php?q=OLED&searcharea=deals&searchin=firstAdded today.Don't forget to say Thanks :)
"Well....I've been holding OLED (PANL) since the beginning. Although frustrating to see the rotation out of growth stocks happening right now, OLED is going to be fine. Once things settle down, the numbers will put OLED on the top of buy lists. No debt, huge growth, PROFITABLE, huge margins, reasonable PE, etc.I'll continue to hold - good luck to all!"
Oppenheimer and Cowen have both come out reiterating their PTs on OLED today. Let's see if this helps us get out of this oversold condition.
"LG Display expects to see OLED TV sales increase further despite a contraction in the mainstream TV market.""Demand for OLED panels showed 90 percent growth year-on-year despite lower demand in the TV sector,"" an LG Display official said during the company's conference after the release of third quarter earnings, Wednesday.The recent production capacity increase at LG Display's Guangzhou OLED plant helped sales increase.""With the a capacity addition of 30 thousand panels at the Gangzhou plant that started operation in Q3, we will increase OLED production to 10 million a year and further drive growth in the OLED business,"" the LG Display official said,"
