"TAIPEI/TOKYO/OSAKA -- Apple will use OLED screens for all its forthcoming 5G iPhones this year, going all-in with the world's premium display technology for its flagship range in a move that is sure to spark new competition among suppliers of smartphone panels.The U.S. tech giant plans to introduce four 5G iPhones with three different screen sizes -- 5.4-inch, 6.1-inch and 6.7-inch -- all of which will use the OLED technology, the Nikkei Asian Review has learned. OLED stands for organic light-emitting diode. The technology not only is more power-efficient, but also produces sharper contrast and deeper blacks than liquid-crystal displays.Apple first used OLED displays in its iPhone X in 2017 but this is the first time it will use the more expensive technology for all models in its top-of-the-range phone.Among the three iPhones launched last year, Apple's bestselling iPhone 11 uses more affordable LCDs, but the iPhone 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max have OLED displays. Apple's more affordable iPhone SE, which went on sale in April, also uses an LCD screen.Production of OLED displays, which can be made curved or foldable, is still dominated by Samsung Display, the panel unit of Samsung Electronics. Samsung and other rivals of Apple, including Huawei, Oppo and Vivo, already use OLED displays in their premium smartphones.Apple will still not be able to use a full-screen OLED display because it still needs to integrate its facial recognition function, known as Face ID, at the top of the iPhone.""The four new iPhones will all be equipped with the flexible OLED displays. However, there will still be a notch, or ""fringe,"" on the top of the iPhone, because Apple was unable to integrate the Face ID module into the display,"" an executive-level source told Nikkei. Face ID was first introduced with the iPhone X in 2017.Apple's decision is a blow to its longtime LCD screen supplier Japan Display, which earns around 60% of its revenue from selling LCD screens to Apple. Japan Display, has had net losses for six straight years, lags behind competitors in OLED development, only a relatively few OLED screens for wearable devices.Another Apple screen supplier, LG Display, started to produce small numbers of OLED displays for iPhones last year.""Apple has no choice but to turn to OLED displays because its competitors have already done that, and of course every Apple shift in technologies will have huge impacts on its suppliers,"" said Eric Chiou, a veteran display analyst with TrendForce. ""But we don't think [Japan Display] will die suddenly, as Apple is still very likely to continue to adopt LCD screens not only in its old models but also its more cost-effective models, looking forward.""Japan Display declined to comment.TrendForce forecasts that OLED screens will be on half of all new smartphones as early as 2022. Another research company, Omdia, previously known as IHS-Markit, predicts that by 2023 OLED screens will be a mainstream feature and that more than 50% of smartphones will use such displays.For 2020, Samsung is expected to have 74% of the market for OLED displays while China's BOE Technology is expected to have a 9% market share, according to TrendForce.Industry experts say BOE is catching up in terms of production capacity and quality. Its OLED displays are already used by many Chinese smartphone makers, including Huawei, Oppo, Vivo, and Xiaomi.Apple is still certifying BOE Technology Group as an OLED supplier for iPhones, in a move to reduce its reliance on Samsung, Nikkei earlier reported. The Chinese display maker has not yet met the U.S. company's standards for its latest iPhones this year, but it still has a chance to enter the supply chain later, sources said. BOE is already an Apple display supplier for MacBook laptops and iPads but, is still not a supply for the iPhone.However a number Japanese and Taiwanese companies that were once leading display makers, including Japan Display, Sharp, Innolux and Au Optronics, are not big players in OLED technology. Many have struggled to make a profit amid a glut in the LCD market and have not been able to make the big capital investments needed for OLED technology."
"Dear All:Two nights ago, on Yahoo Finance, I briefly saw an article that LG was expanding its manufacturing capacity of OLED materials with an expenditure of something like $2B to build a new factory. The next morning, that article was gone and I do not see it on LG's page either. Did I dream this up or is it real somewhere and that would explain today's price rise (although why it did not impact yesterday is a bit of a mystery)?HS"

"MagnaChip Semiconductor (MX) earnings""Our OLED and Power businesses both had record annual revenue in 2018 and are positioned for success in 2019 due to a strong product lineup, robust product roadmap and well-established customer traction. Higher-margin Premium Power products represented over 45% of total Power revenue in Q4, due mainly to growth in the industrial, television, and lighting markets. In the OLED business, MagnaChip secured new design wins for display driver ICs from China smartphone makers and three design wins from a major smartphone maker in Korea for a line of mid-range smartphones. Our latest and lowest-power 28 nanometer OLED display driver IC will sample at the end of this month, and we anticipate volume production in the second half of this year."" Mr. Kim added, ""Our foundry business under-performed in Q4 2018 on an ""as adjusted"" basis, due in part to an inventory correction by customers that caused a drop in utilization in Fab 4. We expect utilization in Fab 4 will decline significantly further in the first half of 2019, due in part to a continuing inventory correction and our decision to be more selective about business as we undergo our strategic evaluation process.""Full Year 2018 SummaryRevenue of $750.9 million, up 10.5% YoYRecord OLED revenue of $188.0 million, up 3-fold YoY"
"Looks like people are buying ahead of earnings. They've been so conservative with guidance, we are almost sure to blow out expectations. The question will be how willing they will be to modify guidance. They may be forced to up it some based on all the news coming out... - Now that Samsung is releasing their QD OLEDs in 2022, I'm hoping they can give more details about TV revenues. - Smartphone numbers should be huge- Apple is moving Ipads to OLED in 2022- LG is projecting 10 million TVS in 2022.This points to strong numbers between now and then."

share price now below typical daily moving averages and has given back 50% of runup from March 2020. long term investors have seen this many times before. 2021 low is 180.20. triple bottom now on daily chart? maybe a good time to add shares or sell some puts.
"Samsung Display is the first to supply OLED panels for laptops to Apple.It was heard on the 19th that Samsung Display is currently discussing with Apple about supplying display panels for laptops and tablets that are applied with TFT (Thin Film Encaps) to Rigid OLEDs. Thin-film encapsulation is a method that was applied to flexible OLEDs. If current method of glass encapsulation is replaced, thickness of rigid OLED will become thinner. It is a process that manufactures so-called hybrid OLEDs.According to industry sources, Apple is considering adopting OLED displays for its ""Pro"" model, a high-end specification among its line-up of laptop and tablet PC products. It is planning to add a new 16-inch ""MacBook Pro"" with OLED displays to its laptop lineup and change the existing 11-inch ""iPad Pro"" display from LCD to OLED.Apple also applied high-end specifications when it adopts flexible OLEDs for iPhones. 'iPhone X', which first used OLED displays, was released along with iPhone 8 series that have LCD displays. Samsung Display is the sole supplier of flexible OLEDs that will be used for iPhones.It is heard that Samsung Display presented rigid OLEDs that are applied with thin film encapsulation process to Apple for IT panels. Thin-film encapsulation is a process that is used by flexible OLED production lines Previously, rigid OLEDs covered another glass on top of substrate glass and blocked the side to protect the light emitting layer.Large OLEDs that are applied with thin-film encapsulation process do not need encapsulation glass. As a sheet of glass is missing, its thickness becomes thinner. It is a clear advantage over LCD in terms of thickness. LCD adds backlight module to 2 glass sheets. Thinning thickness can be used to secure battery space for tablet PCs along with design effects.Existing rigid OLEDs, which are composed of two front and rear glass panels, had to go through a slimming process that makes glass thinner. Because production cost of thin-film encapsulation process has disappeared from single glass and slimming process, it seems that Samsung Electronics can make up for this cost.Samsung Display is actively applying and expanding OLED displays to IT panels that are bigger than Smartphones' screens. It invited customers from Samsung's U.S. office in San Jose, California, for two days from July 14 and held a technical seminar. At the event, Samsung Display said that global leading IT manufacturers paid attention to the excellence of OLED."

Roller coaster ride started again Friday...don't be surprised to see pps bounce right back this week - I've seen it happen many times since the days of PANL. I am ok with management's conservative guidance that will continue to over-deliver.
"Anyone concerned that microled (not miniled) will eventually replace OLED? The theoretical advantages for microled are: 1. higher peak brightness; 2. no risk of burn in; and 3. eventually, less expensive. Strides are being made with OLED for brightness, though I'm not sure what is achieveable, and burn in, for practical purposes, isn't really an issue anymore. So it seems that, unless microled can eventually be cheaper than OLED, maybe there isn't really an advantage? As time goes on, OLED should become less expensive, and if this continues before microled hits the market, it makes me wonder if microled will have any advantages... if microled can't dethrone OLED, then OLED will be here for many decades to come."
"I am a new poster to this board but have held shares since it was PANL at $8.What no one worried about MLED mentions is that in the time it will take for MLED to become price competitive, OLED will continue to improve (better manufacturing yields and reduced or eliminated image retention) and come down in price. It could end up being the lowest cost display technology, and I don’t think anyone has ever said it doesn’t provide the best picture.OLED should own television and MLED will have the market for massive displays that need extreme brightness and have the room behind the panel for a heat sink, like outdoor billboards."

"Motley Fool has it rightWhy Universal Display Shares Dropped 18% Last MonthThe display technology expert's shares plunged because a rumored revenue-boosting event didn't happen.Anders BylundOct 9, 2019 at 5:19PMWhat happenedShares of Universal Display (NASDAQ:OLED) fell 18.3% in September, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. In keeping with the display technology researcher's recent history, the stock made a big move in connection with news from smartphone giant Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).So whatBefore Apple introduced the 2019 lineup of new iPhones, some investors had been speculating that every model would come with an organic light-emitting diode (OLED) screen. That would be good news for Universal Display, which collects royalties based on the screen size of such displays reaching consumers. But the OLED technology remained limited to the higher-end models, just like last year, leaving Universal Display's Apple business unchanged. The stock closed 9.8% lower that day.￼BECAUSE IT GETS PAID BY THE SQUARE INCH, THESE BIG-SCREEN TV SETS MATTER MORE TO UNIVERSAL DISPLAY THAN TINY SMARTPHONE SCREENS. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Now whatOther factors also weighed on Universal Display on Sept. 10, such as the CEO having sold a significant batch of shares and the tech sector having a bad day as a whole. But Apple has a tendency to move Universal Display's share price at the mere suggestion of OLED-related developments in the iPhone or iPad lines. In this case, the mere lack of OLED-centric iPhone news was enough to put pressure on the OLED expert's stock.Long-term investors are better off watching Universal Display's progress in the big-screen TV market and the upcoming push into OLED lighting fixtures. Those opportunities will eventually dwarf the smartphone segment's impact on this company's top and bottom lines. For that reason, big share-price cuts based on smartphone news -- like September's plunge -- should be treated as a wide-open buy-in window."
"Magnachip missed today because of a shortage of Display Device Integrated Chips. This could slow down new OLED display manufacturing growth, at least for short term."
"Announced today, this may very well be the frosting on the OLED cake: Universal Display Corporation Announces Formation of OVJP Corporation to Advance the Commercialization of Groundbreaking OLED TV Manufacturing Technology. Solid future IMHO."
"So if you take the 46% percent growth in OLED phones next year along with the more than 60 % growth In OLED TV sales next year that makes for one stellar year of growth. The stock may wobble over the next few weeks as hedge funds and others manipulate it to get in st lower prices, but don't kid yourself get in on any weakness and expand positions if you can. 2 more years will bring a double in my estimation."
"My estimates for 3Q, which BTW were spot on for last quarter. Revenue $122MM, Earnings $1.13Main drivers are the 9 new production facilities in process of coming online in 3Q. I expect my estimates are low balled as I am unsure if I am adequately accounting for material replacement at existing production facilities. Last quarters +$20mm revenue early beat the tariff event will simply have been absorbed. There could be some more of that. Hiring at PPG contract production facilities continues to ramp up."
"Unfortunately with no upped guidance there are no short term catalysts for this at the moment and it will drift down until there is news or Q3 results. Really wish they would get a savvy Wall Street guy to do the quarterly calls, they do wonderful work and sound like Eeyore every CC."
"LG Display to focus on high-end LCD, OLED panels to ensure leadership in display...The company is also planning to double production of transparent OLED displays in the fourth quarter of this year and continue ramping up shipments in years to come. Transparent OLED displays use both front and back sides to show different information and can be applied to shop windows, building façades and exhibition spaces. LG Display sees commercial displays and automotive panels as its star business in its growth-share matrix and it aims to ramp up the share of OLED (for TV panels) and the star business in its product mix from 20-30 percent now to over 50 percent by 2020. https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=ko&u=https://www.mk.co.kr/news/english/view/2019/08/614774/&prev=search"
I wouldn't be surprised to see pps bounce around quite a bit today. If they had just raised guidance we'd be golden but I think there are a lot of investors that will still see the long-term growth story. We've seen this play out many times in the past. glta longs
"Actually sold other stock today to buy more OLED. If you have funds available to buy more OLED, then do it. A year from now, you will be glad you did."
"Besides collecting a royalty (more sales, more royalty), are there any other avenues for OLED's revenue to increase along with wider adoption of oled display tech? I like the technology a lot, but I am unsure how to project future revenues for OLED, as they do not seem to be involved in manufacturing. The stock seems highly valued at the moment (I wish I knew about it years ago). I would like to feel confident there is more room to run."
"Himalayas ResearchLong IdeasTech Universal Display Corporation: 2020 Momentum To Continue With 5GDec. 16, 2019 2:23 PMUniversal Display Corporation (OLED)Summary3Q results saw a beat and raise.Management is confident in 2020 with 5G driving smartphone upgrades.Macro picture is improving as trade worries fade.Shares have pulled back recently, opening up a buying opportunity.Universal Display Corporation (OLED) reported a set of strong 3Q19 results on Oct 30 which also saw a FY19 guidance raise for the third time of the year. The shares were up about 15% on the day after earnings but has since backtracked. I believe the fundamental momentum remains strong going into 2020 with capacity growth rate running at 50%+ in the next two years in parallel with 2017-19. Samsung continues to be the biggest customer and given its strong leadership position in the high-end smartphone market, I believe it will serve UDC well in the coming year as 5G adoption takes flight. I consider the stock to be attractively valued given its high growth potential, particularly with the macro picture improving as trade uncertainties are unwound.3Q results wrapUDC reported revenue of $98m (up 26% yoy/down 17% qoq) which was above Street's $86m. The beat was mainly driven by Samsung which accounted for 56% of total revenue or $55m, up 22% ($10m) sequentially.Looking into the segments, material revenue of $52m (down 32% qoq) were inline with Street, while royalty revenue of $43m (up 10% qoq) came in significantly better than consensus.China revenue fell due to pull-in in 2Q but 4Q outlook is solidI believe China revenue had $15m-$20m pulled into 2Q possibly for customers to get ahead of tariffs at that time. Still, 3Q managed to record about $20m in revenues from China and the management's commentary regarding 4Q was that the customer pipeline will be continue to be strong and they aren't seeing any weakness related to trade or China.Some softness in LGD to be monitored. Revenue from LGD in 3Q was ~$20m which was below expectations and declined sequentially. I think LGD is likely losing some share in OLED TV to Samsung or other vendors which is why their outlook for 2020 has not been as bright. It is something that investors should closely monitor into 2020.Installed capacity to grow over 50% annually till 2021UDC forecasts its installed capacity for OLED to bolster 50% each year during 2019-2021 which is in parallel with the high growth rate we saw in 2017-19. This is particularly encouraging as there are still legs left in the OLED growth story. I suggest that high-end smartphones and premium laptops/PC/tablets will be next growth driver for OLED displays, especially as 5G adoption takes flight in the next 2 years.Valuation: Reasonably attractive for a high growth rate companySince the stock has pulled back recently after 3Q's earnings beat, I think the growth story is very much intact and with the macro picture improving, 2020 might prove to be a great year for OLED as 5G adoption drives further smartphone upgrades which bolsters the premium segment.The stock trades at about 48x forward earnings which is slightly above its 2-year mean of about 44x but is near its lowest this year. I think the current level is attractive to buy."

"Exciting LG Rolling TVs Revealed As OLED Gathers Even More PaceIan MorrisLG pretty much won CES this year with its rolling TVs. While these screens are likely to be expensive and out of reach for most people, they point to an exciting shift in the industry. OLED is here to stay, for one thing, and this is tech that's been promised for as many years as flat panels have been around.According to LetsGoDigital there are a set of new designs that have recently cleared the Korean patent office, which could point to new designs this year or, perhaps, could simply be unused designs that were replaced by the new rollable TV we saw at CES.But the one thing these screens do appear to offer is creating increased scope for high-quality sound. A large base allows for, erm, larger bass and could help these TVs sound far more impressive than their thin screens would suggest.Of course the look isn't quite as tidy as the ""rolls into a box"" design that the company demoed at CES. But again, the advantage here might be that these are cheaper to produce. They may require less intricate electronics to absorb the screen and they could potentially last longer too, if wear and tear on the panel is an issue.Whatever happens this year - and LG may announce more TVs at IFA, a consumer electronics trade show in Germany, later this year. But make no mistake, these screens are here to serve an important function - they will fund ever-cheaper OLED panels that will reduce the overall cost of these TVs for most people. I'm excited, and I'm excited for the first time since the Pioneer Kuro.Part of the reason for that is the improvements OLEDs bring to black levels and contrast over LCDs. Even modern quantum displays can't quite match the perfection of OLED. And that's partly because, like the plasma Kuro I adore, these screens emit their own light rather than relying on a backlight.Since I started in AV in 2007 I've watched TV manufacturers go from bulky CRTs to amazing flat panels. Leading that charge were Korean companies like LG and Samsung, but those companies are also responsible for tanking the market.That's because TVs went from being premium products to costing just a few hundred dollars. This meant that a lot of companies - like Pioneer - ended up exiting the industry because it simply wasn't possible to sell a premium product any more. That's because the general public is price sensitive but can live with a slightly less capable product.What we're seeing now though is an excellent display technology rise up, and while it's still not ""mass market affordable"" the prices are falling again. OLEDs are still a premium product, but they're also becoming one that any dedicated AV lover can reasonably afford with a bit of saving.It's hard to justify $10,000 for a TV, but it's much more easy to talk yourself into spending $1,500. Let's hope these designs are the first part of a move to much more affordable OLEDs."

"Very upbeat tone from LGD on OLED TVs, Q1 matched the peak season Q4 in terms of panel sales, though the future is tempered with the cycles of the pandemicFrom SA:""In terms of P&L, the company achieved 8% operating profit margin by responding agilely to market opportunities even as concerns grow over part supply in the industry, such as glass and semiconductors. EBITDA margin was 24%, staying at 20% level since the last quarter. In particular, the most meaningful achievement in Q1 was sales of OLED TV. Despite the seasonality, it recorded 1.6 million units of shipment, which is on par with the peak season level in Q4. With the changes in lifestyle triggered by COVID-19, customers and end consumers are clearly seeing the fundamental and distinct values of OLED.""""Now for the OLED TV, I would say that the market data tells the good story because since the second half of last year, as people have longer time staying at home, we believe that the consumers are also now discovering the true value of OLED TV. So when you look at the TV set market, then there has been growth in this market, and we also see the same trend continuing in the first quarter of this year from the market data.

"This may be the plasmon technology called groundbreaking in the last conference. UDC trademarked the name recently. It doesn't need to be used in new devices like a new commercial blue would either. Plasmon pholed are easy to implement with no major structural changes needed : ... Using an archetypal phosphorescent emitter, we achieve a two-fold increase in operational stability at the same brightness as a reference conventional device while simultaneously extracting 16 per cent of the energy from the plasmon mode as light. Our approach to increasing OLED stability avoids material-specific designs19–22 and is applicable to all commercial OLEDs that are currently used for lighting panels, televisions and mobile displaysSamsung Display Unveils New Low-power OLED Display for Smartphones Samsung Display, the world’s largest OLED producer, developed the new OLED smartphone display after commercializing a just-developed organic material whose luminous efficiency has improved dramatically compared to the company’s previous OLED smartphone panels. The new panel is being used for the first time in Samsung Electronics’ Galaxy S21 Ultra smartphones.OLED displays don’t require a separate light source, but instead produce their vibrant colors by running an electric current directly through a proprietary set of self-luminous organic materials. This is why the efficiency of organic materials plays a crucial role in determining an OLED display’s performance including its color gamut, high luminance, high-dynamic range imaging (HDR), outdoor visibility and power consumption.“The constant progression of display technologies has increased demand for lower power consumption to enable features such as larger screens, faster display driving, and greater resolution,” said Jeeho Baek, Executive Vice President and Head of the Mobile Display Sales, Marketing & Product Planning Office at Samsung Display. “Building upon our industry-leading expertise in material technology, which has been increasing for a long time, Samsung Display is directly engaging with many of its customers to improve performance of their newest products,” he added.Samsung Display’s novel organic material achieved its sharp increase in luminous efficiency by having electrons flow faster and more easily across the display’s organic layers. In other words, thanks to this process, OLED panels can create brighter light while consuming less power, which improves the battery lifetime for 5G smartphone users who spend more time watching video. The display panel is one of the most important components affecting a smartphone’s total power consumption. Therefore, when the display’s power consumption is cut, this can significantly impact smartphone usage time.Samsung Display has been channeling much of its technological resources into securing “super-gap” competitiveness in the composition of more efficient organic display materials. To that end, the company has been closely collaborating with a number of global material companies, and widening its own talent pool in this field over the past decade.Samsung Display now holds 5,000 patents worldwide that involve the use of organic materials for displays. Also, it has applied for more than 370 patents related to OLED organic materials in each of the past three years. https://www.financialbuzz.com/samsung-display-unveils-new-low-power-oled-display-for-smartphones/"
"2020 iPhones to get flexible OLED panels manufactured by LGLG is expected to start mass-producing flexible OLEDs later this year.Moneycontrol News@moneycontrolcom It looks like the next year’s iPhone has become a favourite amongst leaksters. Rumours of the 2020 iPhones have started picking pace a couple of months before this year’s iPhone launch. The 2019 iPhone is expected to launch during its usual launch cycle in September. However, there is another update about what the 2020 iPhones would offer.According to ET News, the 2020 iPhones would have flexible OLED screens. The Cupertino-based tech giant is rumoured to be in talks with LG for the displays. Samsung has been the primary supplier for iPhone displays. However, LG, too, in the past, has supplied screens for Apple.LG is expected to start mass-producing flexible OLEDs later this year. The South Korean tech giant is currently addressing some issues in the display after which the mass production could begin in Q3 2019. If things work out between Apple and LG, it could help Apple rely less on Samsung, which has been a major producer of iPhone screens. The deal could also possibly reduce the manufacturing costs that is rumoured to cost about a third of the iPhone’s materials."

"Samsung reportedly shifting production of LCD TVs to OLED TVs16 Aug 2019 | Rasmus Larsen | 2Samsung Display has shut down operations at one of its LCD TV production lines as part of 'Project C', which involves a gradual shift to OLED TV mass production, according to a report by The Elec. It is expected to shut down its entire LCD TV production in South Korea. Project C: OLED TV productionAfter months of rumors, Samsung may have given its so-called 'Project C' the green light. In October 2018, the CEO of Samsung Display acknowledged that it was developed 'QD-OLED' technology. Project C is an investment plan to achieve mass production of OLED TVs. Samsung Display has now halted production at one of its two 8G LCD TV production lines in South Korea. The line has been in operation since 2007 when Sony and Samsung created S-LCD to jointly produce LCD TV panels. There are two lines (8-1 and 8-2) each divided into phase 1 and 2. Line 8-1 phase 1 is the one that has been shut down. Samsung is expected to also shut down the rest of the 8G lines. - ""In its next step, Samsung Display is set to shut down the rest of the Gen-8 lines, along with the 7-2 lines left after switching most of them to produce small and mid-sized OLED panels,"" a source told Korean newspaper The Elec. Samsung is believed to be shutting down the lines in order to start installation of production equipment for large-size OLED TV panels. Sources told The Elec that purchase orders are expected for October 2019, slightly later than first anticipated. ￼Korean LCD TV production to endIf the display panel maker shuts down its remaining lines in South Korean, it will no longer be producing LCD TV panels in its home country. Instead it can source panels for its ""QLED"" LCD TVs and conventional LCD TVs from its own production lines in China as well as CSOT's (TCL) new 11G LCD plant that began mass production earlier this year. 10% of panels from the new plant are reserved for Samsung. On the day that Samsung halted its 8-1 line, regulatory filings revealed that equipment maker ICD had signed a contract with Canon Tokki. Industry watchers believe that it is related to Samsung's plans. Samsung has been rumored to switch from LCD to OLED TVs for years now. The company tried to enter the OLED TV segment in 2012 and 2013 but ultimately had to abandon the plan due to production challenges with RGB OLED, leaving LG Display as the sole player with its WOLED technology. Afterwards, Samsung was forced to breathe new life into its LCD TVs. It created ""QLED"" LCD TVs with a quantum dot film. Reports claim that Samsung has seen sales of ""QLED"" LCD TVs increase over the last year or so but it is mostly a smokescreen. The company has been expanding the moniker to cover smaller and more affordable 43 and 49-inch TVs in its Q6 mid-range series, essentially recategorizing sales. Samsung still has a good grip on the 70-inch and larger segment, according to sales data from IHS Markit. However, the popularity of OLED TVs are pushing premium LCD TVs upwards in size - not unlike what happened with plasma TV"

"Thoughtful feedback appreciated:It would appear to me that the combination of OLED and OVJP is a disruptive technology combination when it comes to the display industry. The size of displays would become essentially unlimited and the cost of manufacturing a fraction of the current price.The establishment of the wholly owned OVJP Corporation by Universal Display is, in my opinion, a interesting and significant move forward. I would deduce that the technology hurdles for OVJP have been ironed out. Why else would they establish the foundation of a manufacturing facility in Silicon Valley given the associated expenses?Why a wholly owned subsidiary? What financial advantage does this have. I would suggest that with a demonstration of commercially viable production of OLED displays with OVJP technology a second party would be interested in partnering with Universal Display Corporation. Imagine if you will that Samsung Corporation offered to buy 45% of the now established subsidiary OVJP Corporation. As part of the deal Samsung, with it's deep financial pockets and manufacturing knowledge, agrees to establish a larger manufacturing facility in the USA and incur the the majority of the associated start up costs. Samsung has now partnered with Universal Display (who retains all associated patents) and is now entrenched in the state of the art OLED display manufacturing business. As for Universal Display Corporation it retains majority ownership of it's subsidiary but does not incur the cost of establishing a manufacturing facility; a very expensive proposition . A significant win for all involved with Universal Display Corporation retaining majority control, retaining all associated patents and incurring no associated debt (and dilution for share holders). Samsung remains the leader in OLED display manufacturing technology. What is 45% of the OVJP Corporation worth? Choose your own percent.... How would this be reflected in the PPS of OLED stock?"

"Developed the world's first BE-OLED lightingRomical Co., Ltd. developed the world's first new technology and new material, BE-OLED module, by evolving light-emitting diodes (LEDs) into organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) that have been upgraded to the next level. The new BE-OLED module technology is evaluated as being superior to existing LEDs in terms of brightness, power consumption, lifespan, heat generation, and cost. The BE-OLED module reduces the power consumption of existing lighting by more than 80%, and the brightness is more than three times brighter than the LED light source. The lifetime is also twice as long as that of LEDs. There is little heat, so you can make ultra-thin and ultra-small lighting. Since it is possible to process a curved surface using a thin and light plastic substrate, various designs can also be applied. The cost is one-third of that of LED lighting.Romical Co., Ltd. acquired the Kolon OLED display plant of 4,9530m² (approximately 15,000 pyeong) in Hongseong, Chungcheongnam-do, completed BE-OLED lighting module production facilities, and plans to begin mass production of products in earnest from this year. The factory can produce 30 million BE-OLED modules per year when two lines are operated based on 30W-class BE-OLED standards (LED 100W-class street lights).The Hongseong OLED plant has two complete production lines and an additional line for post-processing parts, and has invested 200 billion won in production equipment costs to establish a BE-OLED plant.

"In Six Years Since Mass Production BeganLG Electronics' OLED TV Sales Breaks Through 4 Million UnitsLG Electronics' sales of organic light-emitting diode (OLED) TVs broke through the milestone of 4 million units in six years since the company started to mass-produce them.In 2018, LG Electronics sold 1,564,500 OLED TVs, an increase of about 33 percent over the previous year, market researcher IHS Markit said on March 24.LG Electronics began the world's first mass production of OLED TVs in 2013 and since then, had sold a total of 3,803,000 units by the end of last year. LG Electronics sold 3,600 units in 2013 when it launched its first OLED TV model but its sales increased more than 20-fold to 76,400 units in 2014, followed by 313,900 units in 2015 and 666,400 units in 2016. Its annual sales topped one million units for the first time in 2017. In the first quarter of this year, the Korean TV giant sold 365,000 OLED TV units.LG Electronics’s OLED TVs are enjoying good evaluations from experts and consumers. They have received high points from a number of reputable rating agencies, including the U.S. consumer magazine Consumer Reports which ranked an LG OLED TV first in a performance test in 2019.LG Electronics plans to launch an aggressive sales campaign in order to further solidify its position in the premium TV market this year. The company launched a number of new products with improved performance early March and decided to prune TV prices by up to 30 percent compared to last year. Through this, LG Electronics plans to ramp up the share of OLED TVs in its total TV sales from 20 percent in 2018 to 25 percent in 2019."
"Because I’ve been a shareholder since the beginning, I knew the recent dip would not keep OLED under $200 for long. This growth story is SO strong the share price can’t be held back (but short term volatility is going to exist). I finally added to my core holdings again last week because the future is so compelling. Millions are being spent to manufacture panels and cost gap vs led/lcd is narrowing. Enjoy the ride longs...more good times ahead!"
"The organic light emitting diode (OLED) TV group led by LG Electronics is increasing its share of the global TV market. Chinese TV makers are concentrating on increasing sales volume with inexpensive liquid crystal display (LCD) TVs, but the OLED TV group is boosting sales in the premium TV market.Sony of Japan ranked third in the TV market after Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics last year. Market researcher IHS Markit said that in 2018, Sony posted US$11.69 billion in TV sales, followed by China's HiSense with US$6.88 billion and TCL with US$6.58 billion.On the other hand, in terms of sales volume, TCL and HiSense dwarfed Sony. Last year Sony sold 11.6 million TVs. HiSense sold 15.94 million units and TCL 17.72 million units, far exceeding Sony's. Sony's TV sales have been on a steady decline since 13.87 million units in 2013. Nevertheless, Sony’s TV sales revenue grew 58 percent from 2013 thanks to its focus on OLED TVs.Sony focused on the premium TV market with OLED TV models as the LCD TV market reached maturity and suffered oversupply. TV market observers said that Sony made a comeback in the TV market as it employed a strategy to concentrate on OLED TV models. Last year, Sony’s average selling price (ASP) stood at US$1,000, more than double TCL's US$372 and HiSense's US$432.Currently, the OLED TV group consists of 15 TV makers including LG Electronics and Sony. Many of these companies are ramping up their market shares in terms of sales. LG Electronics succeeded in increasing its market share from 13.59 percent in 2016 to 16.43 percent last year. Sony also elevated its market share from 8.52 percent to 10.13 percent during the same period. AOC/TP Vision’s market share rose from 2.84 percent to 3.74 percent, while that of Panasonic from 2.05 percent to 3.28 percent.Meanwhile, LG Electronics accounted for 62.2 percent of the OLED camp's total market share in terms of quantity, followed by Sony (18.9 percent), Panasonic (7.7 percent), AOC/TP Vision (5.7 percent) and Skyworth (2.4 percent). OLED TV sales grew to 723,700 units in 2016, 1,592,100 units in 2017 and 2,514,200 units in 2018.""As competition in the LCD TV market has been heating up, Chinese TV makers are turning their eyes to OLED TVs,"" a TV industry observer said. ""HiSense has been selling OLED TVs since last year and TCL is developing OLED TV models."""

Asking a favor from the whole team of learned investors here. On tomorrows call..... Please listen in to the Q&A and how questions are carefully answered. In regard to Blue. I misplaced my scribble notes from the last Q. I have a solid memory of quite a few hints indicating UDC has a blue out there being Beta tested by two customers. It was not the words used but more the nuance of how they were spoken. I can't quantify any prediction. Will qualify as a big beat. If only from the LG and SSD volumes.Good luck all !!

"Can someone explain the future growth drivers. It seems like OLED has already conquered the phone market--both iPhone and Samsung galaxy. What's the next frontier? OLED is starting to become standard in laptops. There's an iPad and macbook rumor. If OLED gets into more Apple products, that will be huge, I imagine. Hopefully in a few years, manufacturing costs come down and an OLED tv is sub-$1,000, leading to common adoption in the tv market. What else is there? I see growth ahead but trying to assess how much and how long it might take. I believe in the tech, but the costs still seem to keep it out of reach for mass adoption in all things. Any other markets or thoughts?"
Every time apple is mentioned people over react on this stock. This company does not rely on apple for its growth there are many many companies and products that will bring this company to over $300 . Take this opportunity to get this company at this new discount price. Long!

"Samsung secures a new OLED-selling trademark for the European marketThe phrase ""OLED Provided by Samsung"" has been submitted as a trademark by the OEM in question with the European Union's Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO). It has led to speculation that this move is part of the company's run-up to CES 2021. It may also simply serve to underpin its position in the relevant market.Many people might be inclined to think Samsung when the term ""OLED"" (or organic LED) comes up in nearly any context. However, it seems this company is not taking any chances through a recent trademarking application to the EUIPO. It might effectively combine a logo, pitch and brand-reinforcement in one to its target audience.More specifically, it consists of the words ""OLED Provided by Samsung"" accompanied by the multi-colored stylized square that has come to be typically associated with this display material. The application, filed by the OEM on December 10, 2020, falls into EUIPO's Nice category 9, which covers pretty much everything from display panels and products for smartphones, TVs, digital signage, PCs and wearables.Given its timing, the new trademark might come into play when Samsung brings its (virtual) presence to CES 2021. Currently, it is thought to have new OLED monitors from 33 to 35 inches in size to debut at this all-digital expo. However, the ""provided by Samsung"" tag also gives the overall impression of the company pushing its role as a supplier of the panels in question to other businesses in related industries.https://www.notebookcheck.net/Samsung-secures-a-new-OLED-selling-trademark-for-the-European-market.509169.0.html"

"LG Display’s own foldable display technology is mature enough for commercialization, and it is now up to device makers to adopt the tech and grow the market in earnest,” said CTO Kang In-byeong at the SID Display Week 2019.Speaking at one of the world’s largest display conferences May 14-17 in San Jose, California, he noted that the foldable technology seems to be ready if a 13.3-inch inward-folding display demonstrated during the conference is any barometer.Partnering with LGD, Chinese PC maker Lenovo introduced a foldable laptop at the event. When folded, the laptop display works as a virtual keyboard while the other serves as a screen. The foldable laptop is scheduled to hit the market in 2020.“Foldable smartphones require more advanced technical capabilities than foldable laptops or tablet PCs,” he said. “Despite technical challenges, the foldable device market can go mainstream depending on device makers.”The Korean tech giant showcased its technical prowess, including a 0.66-inch augmented reality panel with a pixel density of 3,500 pixels per inch, at the conference.It aims to cement its lead in the market for large OLED displays, and is expected to roll out transparent panels this year which will be will be based on what is called a top-emission design -- that helps improve the longevity and efficiency of panels.The top-emission design is considered more efficient than a bottom-emission design as it has fewer films between the OLEDs and the top screen layer.The bottom-emission design, traditionally used in LGD’s OLED products, has long been a challenge for, hindering the rollout of 8K OLED displays.While trying to improve production yields at its 8.5-generation OLED plants in Guangzhou, China, the Korean firm will execute the planned investment for 10.5 OLED technology, the CTO said."

JOLED, which six months ago announced the launch of what it called the world’s first mass-production line of printed OLEDs, has reportedly been strapped for cash.JOLED is a pioneer in ""printed OLED,"" a manufacturing process for OLED panels which, since 2017, has been used for medical monitor applications. According to Flat Panels HD, JOLED has also provided small-to-medium-sized smartphones and PC monitors.""While mass-producing medium-sized displays, JOLED will prove the adaptability and effectiveness of printing technology to large-sized displays through the joint-development with TCL CSOT,"" the announcement said. ""By leveraging our proprietary RGB printed OLED technology, JOLED will continue to take on challenges with the aim of establishing a unique positioning within the OLED industry and fulfilling its mission of realizing a world full of excitement and emotions through its cutting-edge devices.""According to an OLED-Info post in early 2019, ""inkjet OLED printing has the desirable ability to allow precision deposits without the use of a mask. It also produces less stray particles, thus boosting yields. These significant advantages make this technology interesting to many companies and virtually all OLED makers have active ink-jet printing development projects.”The post also noted that “printing OLED displays is a relatively challenging task for many reasons,” including placing the correct number of drops of the active materials into the pixels.TCL, which is part of the QLED Alliance, makes TVs with multiple technologies, including QLED TVs that are much more affordable than those available from market leader Samsung.https://news.yahoo.com/tcl-getting-oled-hdtvs-181100028.html"
This is in bear territory now. I will watch for 135.
"I look at it this way too. Samsung spent years doing its best to put a negative spin on OLED TV technology. It's too dim, it's too expensive, it doesn't represent colors properly, it's prone to burn-in, etc. etc. All the while after they themselves took a stab at it years earlier only to realize that without economical production, and the accompanying affordable prices, nobody was buying. Now they've got MLED. It's not affordable, isn't suitable for high volume production, and it has it's own very real -- not spin -- technological limitations. But IMO they don't care. It's a way to deflect from the fact that THEY DO NOT MAKE OLED TVs that the buying public now wants and can afford from their competition. They probably spent considerable amounts of money researching MLED technology so why not showcase it no matter what its future and try and steal everyone else's thunder in the process? They already stated publicly that they plan to convert plants to begin producing their own OLED TVs starting next year. Why now focus on OLED if MLED is being showcased? It's all spin IMO. IMO they know it's not going anywhere but they'll do their best to spin it as ""next generation"" with a bunch of sly hand-waving along the way until they get up and running with OLED. There are many, many ideas that come to fruition in a lab as a prototype and some that even make it to low rate production via a mostly hand-built process. But to scale some ideas up to economical levels of production requires new technology in and of itself just to support the accelerated fabrication process. Think of the Model 3 with Tesla these days. They tried the automated assembly line approach and it just didn't pan out. Now they're in a tent assembling vehicles mostly by hand. Economy of scale in the marketpl is not easy to achieve."

Samsung, for example, scrapped a Note and the S21 FE this year due to supply problems. And the projected manufacturing numbers for the S22 variants in January look to be constrained compared to S21. That's not OLED's fault. Late 2022 and beyond things should be better. Just keep buying the dips in the meantime."
"LCD Panel Prices Rising Fast to Accelerate Transition to OLED...In 2017, the manufacturers including BOE and CSOT began to supply their products at prices lower than those of South Korean products with the government backing their mass production. In August 2018, the price of 55-inch 4K LCD panels was US$192. However, it dropped to US$100 in December 2019.These days, the Chinese companies are no longer providing such aggressive discounts in the market they already dominated. This led to a rise in LCD panel price and the rise has been accelerated by COVID-19 and the resultant increase in TV demand.Meanwhile, the prices of OLED panels are falling based on an increase in production. According to the market research firm, the difference between the prices of 55-inch 4K LCD and OLED TV panels is likely to fall from 4.6 times to 2.9 times from 2019 to this year and to 2.6 times in 2023. OLED panels are expected to replace LCD panels more and more rapidly based on this increase in price competitivenesshttp://www.businesskorea.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=61837"
Yet another institutional whipping today.
Options priced like it's going to explode ! All the funds take advantage. I see no reason to own this over 100-130.
"OLED has given back nearly 50% of its runup from March 2020 (tagged 50% yesterday). total decline from 2021 high to yesterday's low was 31% -- not unusual for OLED over last two decades. It's now dropped below uptrend line from last March, and closed below 200 day moving average on Thursday. Unless broader tech market holds up, share price is now vulnerable to continued decline to 160 or so, which would be the next Fibonacci retracement level and where there's some price support from last September. re. considerations about adding shares, i'm in wait and see mode . Nothing's changed in long term prospects, and apparently company really is on verge of commercializing blue, which would be a big deal."
Flipping 10 share trades 100 time a day for about $1 return each time grosses you $100. After taxes about $67. I guess that's not a bad days profits for some?
"This has to be positive news for OLED on the AAPL earnings report...""During the three months of its fiscal third quarter, the company said it tallied nearly $39.6 billion in iPhone sales during the three months ended June 26, up 50% from the same time a year ago."""
"Hmmm.From conference call. Steve Abramson:,,,,,To help enable our customers and accelerate the design pace, we have been establishing a network of OLED material partnerships.

"One month away for Q4 earnings and projections for 2020. OLED adoption seems to be on a very impressive path, China customers will fuel more growth, 5G will boost smartphone replacement cycle, Samsung qoled will add another layer too. Blue will be a huge development when that happens...it’s been close for years and I think it’s going to finally happen in 2020. Where does that leave UDC stock price? would be interested in thoughts from others where pps will be in one, three and twelve months"
Target 237 by September expiry
"Inflection point, there is another flight to value stocks from growth stocks do to the inflationary issues happening. This stock has no catalyst because of the dismal CC last quarter when they essentially said no growth for the rest of the year. So it will pivot one way or the other based on the quarterly report in early November. IF they hit numbers and increase guidelines we are back to the 220's, if they truly are being hit by the chip shortage and Covid issues then this could be a hold for a while."
"Samsung Display promoting 4K OLED notebook panelsRebecca Kuo, Tainan; Steve Shen, DIGITIMESTuesday 19 March 2019Samsung Display is soliciting orders for its 15.6-inch 4K OLED notebook panels from brand vendors including HP, Dell and Lenovo, and new notebook models featuring 4K OLED panels are likely to hit the market in 2019, according to sources from Taiwan's notebook supply chain.Samsung's 4K OLED notebook panels are available with features including low blue light, wide-viewing angle and thin form factor, said the sources.Samsung Display is likely to secure some orders from notebook vendors as the company has managed to narrow the price gap of the comparable 15.6-inch LCD and OLED panels to US$50-60, making the OLED model acceptable to notebook vendors, indicated the sources.sources indicated that China-based Everdisplay Technology has also come out with 4K OLED notebook panels, aiming to expand the applications of OLED panels and to take on Samsung Display directly in the segment.Samsung Display aims to ship one million units of 4K OLED notebook panels in 2019, indicated the sources."
I've also been here since the beginning. and in all that time I figured out that benjo is a real s#$%$ bag. but eventually a short will always be right. hard for anything to go up forever. but don't let the Benjo scare you off. do your own dd and decide.
"In my opinion a bit over-reactive again. Bought at $202. Based on what's on the horizon for OLED, I like my chances. Hanging tight!!"
"Any insight into COHR earnings and action yesterday? They were hesitant to give much guidance, but OLED got more than just mention in the earning transcript: ""...Let me now start with microelectronics. As you know, this market is made up of three sub-markets: flat panel display, semi and advanced packaging and interconnect. Our FPD business is primarily driven by mobile demand. And although worldwide sales of new handsets remains depressed relative to pre-COVID levels, we saw a clear upturn in factory utilization of our ELA installed base from the prior quarter, as consumer spending recovered and several smartphone manufacturers ramped production on new 5G-enabled models. We were especially excited to see the entire new iPhone12 lineup from Apple adopt flexible OLED displays, which together with the new foldable models from Samsung, LG and several Chinese manufacturers, should continue the trend toward flexible OLED becoming the technology of choice.We continue to be cautiously optimistic that we are at the front end of a multi-year 5G-driven smartphone upgrade cycle, which together with announcements of more than 20 laptops having OLED screen options, including the new Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Fold, and the recently introduced Samsung Galaxy Tab S7+ tablets, all bodes well for further utilization of our ELA installed base, which drives a healthy service business.Published reports have noted that one or more display makers other than the historical incumbent may now be supplying flexible OLED displays into Apple, even if only in limited volumes for replacement screens. Similarly, other published reports have noted that several Chinese OLED manufacturers have reached a yield inflection point where they are actively allocating production capacity for larger screens for IT devices such as tablets, laptops and monitors. We believe that these changes in the competitive landscape will help drive OLED price points lower in all mobile screen formats and reduce the premium over LCD, which is the stimulus required to drive the next round of new capacity and fab investments. In that regard, I'm also happy to report that since our last call we have several new orders from multiple customers in China.In Q4, we also saw a significant increase in the level of investment and bookings related to microLED displays, where we enjoy an industry-leading position. That is reflected by sales and active engagement with more than 25 customers, all working on process development as a precursor to a mass production solution. Our microLED customer base includes almost all current OLED & LCD manufacturers, as well as many well-known microLED specific start-ups and display industry integrators. We are uniquely positioned with multiple UV solutions for four separate microLED processes, ELA for high performance/low power consumption backplanes, laser lift off for customers using sapphire carriers, laser transfer and laser repair.The appeal of microLED is reduced electrical consumption for improved battery life and higher absolute brightness relative to OLED. We are continuing to accelerate our efforts and investments in UV microLED solutions to help our customers develop the laser processes of record, so we can, in turn, develop the laser-based capital equipment systems needed for mass production. We will further discuss our new process development product offerings with you later in fiscal '21. ..."""
Investors who are selling at these reduced prices are fools and will regret having sold. This company and its markets and uses are here to stay. With no competition this is a no brainer.
Strong sell to $140 now.
I thought we only had a 3 to 4 year window for OLED dominance. The tea leaves are showing that as OLED expands over the next few year and become ubiquitous across all displays it will eventually become like LCD and still have huge impact on the market even after it is no longer the cutting edge. This stock really has the chance to make all current owners millionaires over the next 10 years. The Aixron news along with the OPJV news from OLED makes this much more of a real possibility.
Will be at $170 tomorrow and red today
"At the local Best Buy yesterday evening. Ooogled over the LG TV section, the OLEDs popped. Strayed over to the Sony section, they had 4 TVs on the wall and one caught my eye. ...And yep! It was the AG8 OLED.The Sammy TV's looked pale in comparison. That's nothing new.And another thing... if you go to Amazon and search for TV wall mounts. Every single one I've seen now mentioned compatibility with LED, LCD and OLED screens. Not that it's functionally significant, but the pervasive mention of OLED is a welcome sign."
"It seems there could be a big significant holder slowly unwinding position? Just my opinion based on the slow monotonous down on average volume trying to not disrupt market. These are the best quarters on the way, so that would seem to be the wrong thing to do."
"DSCC says that the high costs of microLED production will limit the adoption of microLED TVs, which are highly expensive, and the technology will remain in the niche of ultra large displays. The market is set to grow from around $25 million in 2020 to $228 million by 2026.￼Just for comparison, six years after being commercialization, in 2019 OLED TV revenues were estimated at $2.5 billion.Source: MicroLED-Info"
up 3.33%. in premarket with unknown volume?
"Key things to note as we head into the holidays:1. The amount of OLED sales growth over the next 5 years will dwarf the amount of growth over the last 5 years.2. OLED is replacing the over 10 year run of LCD panels starting at the infrastructure level of manufacturing. Meaning that any other techhnology has a minimum of 3 to 5 year ramp before they could even start to compete with the already existing and fast growing infrastructure of OLED manufacturing . We are now the 800 pound gorilla and competing with us will be very expensive.3. Rapid cost savings on yield improvement and the production costs savings by OVJP will extend both the size of the OLED pie and the piece of the pie that UDC will have. Being the mainstream technology for panel production over next 3 to 5 years engendering exponential growth.4. Potential game changers still in the pipe, BLUE, transparent OLED, multiform lighting.5. Market game changers; 5G, IOT.both accelerating growth of market and sales.6. Dividend growth. Expect an increased one announced in February.7. Stick around for the ride this will be fun."

"Apple's first rumored head-mounted augmented reality device could be ready by the middle of next year, according to a new report out today from Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo (via Economic Daily News [Google Translate]). ￼According to Kuo, Apple's AR glasses will be marketed as an iPhone accessory and primarily take a display role while wirelessly offloading computing, networking, and positioning to the iPhone. Designing the AR glasses to work as an iPhone accessory is also expected to allow Apple to keep the glasses slim and lightweight, rather than trying to pack in all the processing hardware into the one device. Kuo believes Apple is aiming to begin mass-producing the glasses as early as the fourth quarter of this year, although he admits the timeframe could be pushed back to the second quarter of 2020. Back in November 2017, Bloombergreported that Apple was developing an AR headset and aimed to have it ready by 2019, although the company could ship a product in 2020. The report said the headset would run on a new custom operating system, based on iOS, and dubbed ""rOS"" for ""reality operating system.""Apple has been exploring virtual reality and augmented reality technologies for more than 10 years based on patent filings. The company is also rumored to have a secret research unit comprising hundreds of employees working on AR and VR, exploring ways the emerging technologies could be used in future Apple products. Apple CEO Tim Cook has talked up the prospect of augmented reality several times, saying he views AR as ""profound"" because the technology ""amplifies human performance instead of isolating humans.""Related Roundup: Apple GlassesTag: Ming-Chi Kuo"

"Tuesday 3 September 2019Efforts by Samsung Display and LG Display (LGD) to shift their production focus from LCD panels to AMOLED models appear to have paid off as the two Korean suppliers are currently the top-two panel makers globally in terms of shipment value, according to Digitimes Research.Samsung Display has been focusing on production of AMOLED panels for smartphone applications, with its shipments accounting for nearly 90% of global AMOLED handset panels in the first half of 2019. Additionally, both of its OLED panel revenues and operating margin were also higher than those generated from LCD panel business.Although Samsung Display currently lags fellow company LGD with respect to the development of large-size OLED TV panels, the company will transform one of its 8.5G LCD lines into a QD-OLED line in the third quarter of 2019, aiming to outrace LGD in the large-size OLED TV panel sector by rolling out related products with better image quality.Meanwhile, LGD's OLED TV panel business managed to swing to profitability in the first half of 2019, with prospects of generating more profits from its OLED lineup in 2020 and beyond.Since LGD plans to start volume production at its 8.5G OLED line in Guangzhou in the third quarter of 2019 and another 10.5G OLED line in Korea in the first half of 2021, coupled with plans to enhance deployments in the small- to medium-size OLED panel segment, OLED revenues are expected to account for 35-40% of its total revenues in 2021, Digitimes Research estimates."
"Ok, I’m ready for a reversal."
"microLED shipments in 2026 will still amount to just 0.4 percent of the global flat-panel display market,OLED will be 98.6 percent.ksea--have somebody explain what this means"
So I kept my word and bought some shares today. Hope you did as well. The future is still bright
Look at this ....OLED deals skyrocketted in September.OLED jumps very high whenever this happens...been tracking for last couple years.Previous quarter there very very less deals and OLED tanked.https://slickdeals.net/newsearch.php?q=OLED&searcharea=deals&searchin=firstAdded today.Don't forget to say Thanks :)
"Key takeaway from presentation at the recent investors conference(from audio):1. Large scale-out of OLED panel production just beginning for both small and large form factor devices and 2020 will be a big year for fabrication growth(we mostly know that)2. 5G will purportedly drive a large upgrade cycle for mobile and with 5G using more battery power, manufacturers *not* currently incorporating OLED screens with UDC energy-efficient emitters could see major power efficiency improvements to help offset increased 5G power requirements by leveraging OLED technology(interesting point)3. OVJP is proven to work as a proof-of-concept and will drive the later, second wave of OLED panel fabrication scale-out(will be a while)4. OLED material costs are minuscule to manufacturers relative to total panel fabrication costs so *any* increases on OLED materials due to tariffs would also be minuscule and have little to no impact on UDC material sales(interesting point)5. UDC has 100+ of the world's most well-suited scientists and chemists working on a long-lived, energy efficient phosphorescent blue emitter(slight emphasis seemed to be on it being phosphorescent)6. QD-OLED from Samsung is *again* mentioned as representative of the acceptance and growth of OLED in the marketplace(read from this what you will)7. UDC is very much interested in the large TV market vs smaller handheld and mobile market(clearly since they sell more material and they are a material company)8. UDC doesn't appear to be at all threatened by any talk of MLED(he conveyed that it's all small-scale proof-of-concepts at low pixel density ala the wall and too hard to get right in any usable size and resolution that the consumer really cares about)"
"Chinese BOE Increases Capacity of OLED DisplaysChinese BOE Increases Capacity of OLED DisplaysNov 26,2019 BOE TechnologyGroup Co Ltd, a Chinese supplier of display products and solutions, pans to significantly increase the production of flexible screens for smartphones, and expand its presence in internet of things, intelligent retail, vehicle-mounted systems and other emerging industries.During the company's annual Innovation Partner Conference on Tuesday in Beijing, Chen Yanshun, chairman of BOE, said the company is banking on the flexible organic light-emitting diode (OLED), and shipments of OLED panels will triple to at least 70 million pieces next year. He also noted that presently the supply of traditional liquid crystal displays has surpassed its demand, so BOE won't increase its investment in the sector in the future.BOE currently runs three sixth-generation active matrix/organic light-emitting diode (AMOLED) production lines. The company started mass production of the panels from its facility in Chengdu, Sichuan province in October 2017. The panels have already been used by more than 10 smartphone manufacturers including Huawei, Oppo and Vivo.The company's second line in Mianyang, Sichuan province started mass production in July, while work on the third facility commenced in Chongqing last year."

"I guess the analyst already forgot about Sid's statement during the last conference call.Sid - ""Well, the strength that we saw in this quarter and expect to see in the fourth quarter is really due to customer pipeline activity. We don't talk about specific customers, but we are seeing strength in many areas, so -- which is what caused us to raise it.(Guidance)""Needham analyst - ""Okay. So it's fairly broad-based then, is what you're saying?""Sid - ""Yes.""Maybe there is another motive for the downgrade; short between calls, just before their downgrade, and then buy shares back at a discount a few weeks prior to earnings. Make money on the price swings both ways. Have sold and bought back that way but never shorted; too risky, and I don't write articles that affect the stock price."

"China is expected to become the world's largest market for organic light-emitting diode (OLED) televisions in the next two or three years. [Photo/VCG]China is expected to become the world's largest market for organic light-emitting diode (OLED) televisions in the next two or three years as increasing numbers of affluent consumers want premium TVs that deliver outstanding picture quality and wider viewing angles, industry insiders said.Wen Jianping, president of All View Cloud, a Beijing-based consultancy specializing in home appliances said the price of OLED TVs will continue to fall in the next two years, with sales rising to 380,000 units this year, and reaching 800,000 units in 2020.""The OLED TVs will be the future development direction of the TV industry, and also an opportunity for TV manufacturers to expand their profit margins,"" Wen said, adding competition in the traditional liquid crystal display (LCD) sector is fierce, with the problem of seriously homogeneous products now showing up.OLED is a relatively new technology and part of recent innovations in display. It has a fast response rate, wide viewing angles, super high-contrast images and richer colors. It is much thinner and can be made flexible, compared with traditional LCD display panels.Shenzhen-based TV maker Skyworth Group is banking on such cutting-edge and innovative OLED technology to conquer the domestic TV market.Wang Zhiguo, chairman and president of Shenzhen Skyworth-RGB Electronic, a subsidiary of Skyworth Group, said the low price wars in the LCD TV market have an influence on China's high-end TV segment priced from 6,000 yuan ($871) to 7,999 yuan. He said Skyworth will invest no less than 10 million yuan to popularize OLED technology across the nation.Skyworth has been producing OLED TVs in partnership with South Korea's largest panel maker LG Display since 2013. Statistics from AVC showed sales of Skyworth OLED TV accounted for 46 percent of total OLED sales in the Chinese market in 2017, followed by LG (16 percent) and Sony (14.9 percent)."
