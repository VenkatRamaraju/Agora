"Lowe's Chief Financial Officer David Denton, however, said the home-improvement chain was in a better position today than it was six to 12 months ago, with respect to its inventory position and supply chain.""We're actually getting better, not worse,"" Denton said at a Goldman Sachs Annual Global Retailing Conference. ""Lowe's is positioned better than most, if not everybody else in the marketplace."""
