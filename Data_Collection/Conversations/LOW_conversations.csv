"The only reason I invested is because I believe the drug works and I believe that HGEN has taken the right steps to get past the Regulatory Gatekeepers and to the sick that need it. That hasn't changed, except to say that the REG G's have taken a lot longer than I expected. When the stock goes down so much with so little volume, I take it as a comfort. I might be sick, but I was just in the same boat with $BMBL, $EBAY, and $LOW as well. If the stock was shooting sky high without the EUA, that's the time to be on guard.. $SESN is the ultimate example of that for generations of investors for all time.But when the SP is trickling down on low volume with virtually every analyst saying buy- I'll wait it out. I can but then again, I don't tend to invest in these out of the money options, WHICH by the way, is what I believe is the catalyst of today's SP, and probably tomorrow. If you're sitting on a Call with a Strike Price of 15, I think you're on the menu. Sorry about that..."
CNBC/REPORT ON INSURANCE ADJUSTERS NOW HANDLING CLAIMS EVEN USING DRONES TO SPEED UP PROCESS TO GET CHECKS IN HAND OF HOMEOWNERS-CEO OF INSURANCE COMPANY SAYS HE WANTS TO GET CHECK IN HOMEOWNERS HAND AS FAST AS POSSIBLE SO HOMEOWNERS CAN REPAIR ROOFS AND OTHER DAMAGES AND GET BACK IN HOMES-LOWES IS BIG SUPPLIER OF MATERIALS NEEDED TO REPAIR ROOFS AND OTHER DAMAGES TO THESE HOMES-THESE HUGE SALES WILL BE ADDED TO ALREADY ROSEY FORWARD GUIDANCE GIVEN BY CEO OF LOWES THAT MADE LOWES JUMP 10 PERCENT ST LAST EARNINGS!!!!!
Should gain 5% per day. No pullbacks. Straight to $500
"The up revised avg. E est for EOFY22, the avg. of co. guidance/analyst est., is $11.30. Using a 5yr. blended P/E avg. (3yrs. prior and 2yr. fwd est.), LOW normal P/E is 21. The Dodd/Graham formula avg. for fast growth cos., essentially P/E=G, is nearly the same-P/E22. Even using longer 10yr. blended P/E avg. it remains in the 20-21 range. This is LOW intrinsic, or FV over time... So, at LOW FV, EOFY22= ~$226-or more. That is just to return to FV. All cos., whether moving higher or lower, always return to FV."
It is mispriced if pricing off HD . It was already undervalued. If they deliver a beat tomorrow short sellers will get a whip lash
"I don't post often, but have been tracking RECAF since August September' 2020 @.69. there are many members on this board who obviously have knowledge and experience in the O&G industry. My family traces it's beginningto Oil City Pennsylvania. My Great Great Uncle Henry. McSweney was the Solicitor General for the O&G Pipeline authority for the state of Pennsylvania. he wrote the handbook for the O&G industry in 1895. Snowden McSweeney Oil Co was formed and they left their mark on the American Oil industry THERE are still fields in Kansas, Arkansas and wells in Texas and New Mexico that carry The Name. while drilling in Carlsbad, NM. They did covered commercial quantities of Pot Ash. Snowden McSweeney merged with Texas Gulf Production and They formed the United States Pot Ash Corp. My Grandfather Henry Allan. continued as an Inxependant O&G E&P. Grab dad worked for Snowden Mcsweeney then went on his own and had a successful career. The Kavango basin has been compared to the Permian Basin. Henry drilled many wells in the Permian. My home is that RECAF continues their slow methodical strategy. This is not something a project that you RUSH!$LOW AND EASY! WE WILL KNOW SOON IF COMMERCIAL PRODUCTION IS THERE! KEEP THE GAITH!"
"What a sad state that corporate America is in right now, weak leaders falling like dominos to the woke. Won't be shopping at Lowes anymore."
SOLD - but will buy back at a lower price. See you'all soon.
Here is the best reason to buy Lowes today. Earnings power. Going to grow EPS. The GPS ratio is 1.44 and HD is only .91 . While HD is bigger the LOW is promising a better growth opportunity vs. HD . The GPE is a major factor in value and LOW is undervalued while HD is priced pretty close to value maybe a bit light but definitely closer to full value than LOW. I expect even more growth prior to earnings release with a pop afterthe conference call. I am not concerned about Marvin he is skilled and experienced in this model. I do imagine he irritates some as he came in with a goal to grow the company and improve the efficiency RSI is far more favorable for a sudden increase here than HD as well with 46.7 vs 68.6 on the 9 day scale. I also like HD to beat their numbers just not as much as LOW. Day traders are coming in and out now to wet their beaks. This will continue to Thursday.
Do not sell LOW on panic attacks. A little down or up in earnings takes nothing away from corporate foundations and policies . The company is solid
I just completed the Conference Call Transcript .Very solid indeed . The building effort of the pro business is beginning to show a nice return. There are many other aspects of the business which have dramatically improved thanks to Marvin's leadership and a strong team effort. The cross dock function from vendor to customer with out needing to be put away in company owned storage is huge for the business particularly with regard to speed of service and inventory turnover. They have continued to pay attention to retail customer needs and desires with stores appearing to be more retail friendly than HD. I appreciate the focus on gross margin while keeping price competitive in spite of the beginning of inflation a very key issue. The Field Merchandising support installed will no doubt improve customer demand and satisfaction on an ongoing basis with even more experience as trust builds from the ultimate consumer and the retail store. I like the grip of this retailer and both LOW and HD should continue to grow as it really is a basic duopoly .Own the both is my advice but a bit heavier on LOW as the Relative Value and stock growth weighs heavier towards LOW but both are solid growth companies with growing dividend pay outs. I bought the recent dips and am very happy.
"Congrats Longs. Now, take your profits and step aside. Don't let greed hurt you during the sell-off!!"
Blow out earnings coming as costs of Covid absorbed and traffic and pricing through roof. Clear that DIY trend is not stopping as lock down ends……people have to spend money on something and it isn’t going to be international travel for a while!
Winning!!!!
take profits and run.. Back to low $190s
Just keep buying. Not allowed to drop
LOWES SAYS IT IS WELL POSITIONED WITH INVENTORY TO MEET INCREASED DEMAND IN SALES
Lowe’s is down today because of Home Depot and tomorrow it will be down again because of its earnings.
"Thank you Lowe's for the +13,000% growth but your message board is kind of boring. More fun taking some of the profit and creating more millions with some green prospects and my PLUG POWER stock.Yee Haw!!!"
"Conduit Stock Selector, has a long term buyrating on LOW (subject to market conditions)."
Marvin is good at cost cutting. But after a couple years you run out of things to cut. He doesn’t know how to grow a business. If you look at his history he leaves companies after a few years because he runs out of things to cut and the company struggles. I would be surprised if he is fired or moves on to another company to turn around
"Approaching EO3Q, LOW is right in the FV zone.. the 5yr blended P/E is 21. For EOFY21 @ E est. of $11.33, FV is c.$238. Operating E growth rate avg. is 22.52%. EGR >P/E, with divs, avg. annualized ROR >23%= LT keeper.."
LOOK FOR LOW TO BREAKOUT WHEN GOES PAST 211!
How does LOW get hammered more than Home Depot in reaction to Home Depot’s earnings?
"yowzah.. LOW up $30 ps <2 months after the almost typical ""flash-drop"" following HD earnings call. Not too shabby %^).."
Let’s hope we can hold these gains. But amazing earnings. Glad I added yesterday.
I BOUGHT MORE LOW CALLS THIS MORNING -COULD NOT RESIST-FACTS ON BUYER SIDE IF SIT ON IT
Lowe's drinking HD's milkshake.
when will the stock ever split
BIG GUYS ACCUMULATING SHARES ALWAYS A GOOD SIGN OF MOVE UP-CEO ALREADY SAID AT EARNING A GOOD FORECAST-NOW YOU ADD APPROXIMATELY 20 BILLION FOR HURRICANE REBUILD WHICH LOWES WILL GET A GOOD PART OF IN SALES OF REBUILD MATERIAL SALES!!
What I have noticed is some of the longest lines ever at Lowes it's like Christmas time. People are spending more time at home. They are accommodating their homes for spending more time there. Having more time at home I have also been working on projects that I've been needing to do.
"Lows is now have a better service help than home depot.No customer service or lack of enthusiasm at the service desk.I first went to Homedepot to pick up 150 pcs of pave stone and wait for 45mn got no help.So I drove two block to Lowe, they have a guy to use forklift to load it to my truck in less than 15 minutes."
Powell bout to tank the markets lol
should lowes split there stock
"Did I read that right? Rev up 1% over q2 2020 , meanwhile lumber was up like 300%. Seems like revs should have been up much more. Price in the housing market bubble, and stock market bubble I don’t see much upside. Short $201.69 good luck to all"
Hurricane Ida coming to Louisiana.Time to buy Lowe's. Got Plywood?!
EXPECTING GOOD JOB NUMBERS TO CAUSE MARKETS TO MOVE HIGHER TOMORROW AS A LOT OF WORKERS HAD TO GO BACK TO WORK
"I've been buying one or two shares at a time with market orders. Got down to $182.6. I hope it goes lower tomorrow. If Q2 earnings are even flat with 2020Q2E, which was the highest dollar and % gain Q in LOW 60+ year history... I'm good with that. If they beat it but not to the analyst est., or same store sales, etc.. well what's new? It happens almost every HD and LOW E call. Getting further into the buy zone is a good thing."
"This company is doing so well it can afford to buy back billions in stock. Cramer and other analysts have called it undervalued due to new record high home ownership. I’m holding this and HD in my portfolio long, folks. 2021 is going to be a great year."
"Builders FirstSource, BLDR, should do very well post IDA. Decent P.E."
Growth and a nice dividend. I see good things a head if morgage rates keep rising.
I am staying far away from LOW - It looks like it is going to drop off a cliff. I actually get way better stocks at http://alert-sounds.com/
"Pay close attention to V earnings and comments..........pay services, PYPL, MA, V, GPN, Sq....all getting killed because V says spending will slow dramatically next year!"
Good earnings call? Stock back over 200$?
Glad I bought the dip. I wish I would have bought more.
I’ll be shoplifting at all my local lowes today. Easy money
"Lowe's Chief Financial Officer David Denton, however, said the home-improvement chain was in a better position today than it was six to 12 months ago, with respect to its inventory position and supply chain.""We're actually getting better, not worse,"" Denton said at a Goldman Sachs Annual Global Retailing Conference. ""Lowe's is positioned better than most, if not everybody else in the marketplace."""

I guess LOW was heavily shorted yesterday lol
"Brought another 2,000 at $190.00Company is doing great."
what is the whisper number that is driving LOW down ? 3.99 which is the street expectation. What would happen if it hit 4.50 ? LOL
"I like the company and I bought it right. That said, the pin action on the stock is frustrating."
300 end of day.
"HD 2.4 TIMES THE SIZE OF LOW, AND STILL GROWING PROFITS AT 10% a year, So imo Low has a long way to run long term."
This will close under $190 today. Unload and take profit ASAP!
"Everyone has had plenty of time to take profits today, when this comes back to reality in the low 190s tomorrow its 100% on you"
"My DFC calculation tells me this should be a +200 USD stock, especially after these earnings"
Whoa...what a difference a day makes.
Lowe's Companies reached an all time high at 232.18
"No it is not time to buy.Lumber, osb and plywood are down 50- 70% in the last 4 weeks.Freight of import from China raised 20,000 dollars per container.Customer will not absorb this kind of inflation.Margin and sales will go down.I have been many years in this business."

"Well, at least the drop has baked in the (likely) earnings beat for tomorrow. Maybe...."
BOUGHT 240 CALLS SINCE I KNOW SALES ARE GREAT THIS FALL WITH ALL NEWS
Lowe's Companies is up 4.95% to 191.28
OPTIONS FRIDAY-LOOK FOR LOW TO DROP AS END OF DAY COMES
LOW NEEDS TO HOLD 205 SUPPORT AS MARKETS DROP
Lowe's should increase dividend and promote their credit card with the 5% discount that they offer.
"Lumber futures are going back up. If you have a project you have been putting on hold hoping for better prices, you may want to go ahead and buy now before it goes back up at the store."
"Fantastic quarter. Everything fell into place for LOW, and it's dragging HD out of the abyss from its dismal earnings along with it. Sales growth vs. sales contraction even despite gross margin being impacted by higher supply costs. Guidance was good too. I own both LOW and HD but there is no question LOW is growing at a much faster pace than HD and represents growth at a reasonable price. If I could only own one it would easily be LOW."
High target price $280. To the moon!
Lowe’s and HD are going to crash when new homes run into a brick wall when all the foreclosures hit the market from rising interest rates and rental home foreclosures. If you bought low now is the time to exit!

All the good news is factored in.I would pick back when below 197 level. Even Home Builders are slowing down for next quarter.
"Bought my LOW shares in April and it’s still down so far, I regret that I didn’t put those capital into my favorite stocks GOOG or AAPL"
BOUGHT CALLS-CNBC NOW SAYS HURRICANE DAMAGES COULD BE 15 to 30 BILLION -THIS IS A GREAT SALES SEASON FOR LOWES ANYWAY-NOW ADD BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF NEEDED SALES OF HURRICANE SUPPLIES AND BUILDING SUPPLIES!!!
$220 puts ready
Maybe a buying opportunity?
Argus pps for Low is now 262. Read the report i did.
"Congrats those that bought the dip at 183…..my long thesis remains intact. Only stocks I am more bullish on are Pfizer and FDX both are generating amazing cash, have tail winds for years and are a crazy low forward valuations…..both are up since I went long but I think could be 50% higher by end of year…..fundamentals are amazing. Do your own due diligence - check my history for accuracy of my analysis.Good luck Fellow LOW long term longs!"
LOW smashes earnings!!! GO LOW GO!!!
When does this rally end?
"Renovating a home for the first time in 17 years, have built and always been around some renovations but what an eye opener Lowes customer service is firing on all cylinders, their trying. Home Depot solidly in the we couldnt care less dept. Hear this with everyone Im working with."
"Keep buying, this bubble still has room to inflate $spy"
"I must admit I read this one wrong. Egg on my face. Same store sales were down a bit, but the outlook was not nearly as bad as I thought it would be. I was going to buy put the day before ER, but the HD reaction put the brakes on that. Lucky in that respect, I guess, but missing the long bet makes me think that before the next ER I will be putting a little more thought into it."
They are taking this to $230 by the end of the week. May be dumped after that.
"Lowe's inflates their revenue by refusing to turn the AC on in their stores, just facts"
"If anything should do well after Hurricane Ida, Builders FirstSource should. Compare its earnings and P.E. to those of Lowe's."
"I had to buy some shares, today. I went to the LOW website and looked at the pictures of the management team and, they wear all wearing the Lowes' uniform the employees wear on the selling floor."
"Just looking at LOW yesterday and today goes to show that you cannot believe ANYTHING you read. Do your own research, and just as importantly, go with your gut instincts."
"Yes, Lowe's and Home Depot have pricing power for inflation, and they'll likely charge MORE than their added inflation costs, especially HD. Home Depot is EXTREMELY greedy."
70% of all homes are over 25yrs old. Lot of remodeling to come!

"Argus, says 252 pps in recent report and that is before the beat! AVERAGE PPS mean is 227 for lows. Can all 29 analyst be wrong? i don't think so."
The local store had been out of standard drywall panels. Was told they would get a huge shipment on Friday. Went in Friday and they had received 2 bunks of 1/2 X 4 X 8 and 5 bunks of 1/2 X 4 X 12.I guess it will be a while before the prices come down any more.
"The DIP buying model will still be good on growth companies with strong numbers lie LOW. So thank you.The Trend is your friend and don't fight the trend. What can change the timing ? The FED. Don't fight the FED. Tapering is far from the negative impact of an interest hike. I am a trend follower and a value hunter. These are my main trading strategies. There is a lot of money sloshing around so if you stay on trend you will win. Set reasonable stops but keep in mind the value of moving averages and momentum on the big indices daily. If overall the trend is positive by 10:30 and the stock you are targeting has an upward bias it is OK to buy. If you have a stock that is consolidating a gain and it pulls back and nothing has materially changed buy the dip. As the market has become more retail oriented it is always a good idea to follow charts before during and after selling. Value is out there and you can find it but not without understanding market direction and reading the charts. If you do not look at charts learn to do it. It will raise your ROI. Good luck to all .Market is neutral currently but it has come off a bottom and it may confirm upward bias today, This could be a good day to buy if by 10:30 the charts are showing momentum upwards."
"Quick Powell, print more Zionist Monopoly money, it’s not a new record high today "
HD hit is undeserved and LOW more so. Both are very good companies. That deliver value to customers and shareholders. This gets hit when it is a highly profitable growth co ? Are funds selling because they are getting killed in tech ?
Why I shop at Home Depot and not very often at Lowes. They require you to sign up and give personal information to get a Military Discount of 10 % while at Home Depot they just ask for your Miltary ID or VA veterans card. Lowes goes to far in what they call an improvement. Asking for more and more personal information is wrong. My Military ID or VA card with photo should be enough. I will buy my equipment and supplies at Home Depot. I also think HD is a better stock to invest in.
Should be up 80% today. Not allowed to fall
We'll reach $300 by late 2022.
will lowes every split
going back down to $175 houses cost too much
"This stock should move to 220 rather unimpeded . Chart is good moving averages are giving a strong indication that the rally is not finished. Earnings, earnings, earnings, and growth, growth , growth."
Look at the outflow today and the stock is still up. This will crash hard. Way overbought!
I sold out yesterday at near the close to protect profits. I will buy when there is evidence of a bottom. I believe both LOW and HD will profit from the Hurricane Ida
"Morgan Stanley Adjusts Lowe's Companies' Price Target to $240 from $230, Keeps Overweight Rating"
Great buy point now at low of 183…..crazy that this sold off 5% when competitor beat top and bottom line but “only” delivered 4% SST……..I’d buy more but have put all my extra money into Pfizer which is the buy of the century at 13 forward earnings and PEG below 1. Good luck LOW longs…..it will be a nice bounce back tomorrow when street realizes they gained share…..part of traffic decline for HD was high lumber which they have more exposure too…..
On on the day of Victory no one is tired.Cicero
Invest in DRV as the housing market moves into a correction with rising interest rates and foreclosures!
I’m going to steal a bunch of expensive drill bits from lowes today.
LOW will open soft and the gain through day as people realize HD lost share to LOW…..a buying opportunity before noon. I am long and not a trader….I will just watch the fun. Looking forward to tomorrow’s ER.
Sales up 1% y over y. Stock rips 10% higher. Short 201
What's going on today? Any ideas on this huge drop? Can't see anything.
"Went to the local store today to get drywall - nothing but broken pieces and specialty panels left, and not much of that."
"I’m ready, my target is $210 big drop. Overbought rn momentum dying"
Just added Lowe’s to my kids portfolio today. Bought 10 shares a piece.
"Over bought....time to buy PUTS!!Rising rates and soaring oil are NOT good for retailers or home builder type stocks....look for quick downside!I bought 5 of the Nov 12, $225 PUTS for $4.30."
Awesome earnings Lowes!! Way to go!!!!
There are two kinds of people in this world.....those who shop at Target & Lowe's......and those who shop at Walmart & Home Depot......my preference is Target and Lowe's hands down.....just a better shopping experience overall.....
Earnings are priced in at these levels. Down 10$ … what a buying opportunity

Market not allowed to dip or correct. Buy any minor dip on full margin. Liquidate the house $spy
I like Carter and he is a chartist and not an analyst. He will sway some and next week he will shrug his shoulders and go forward. For sure there is a somewhat negative bias . Last year there for the quarter they made 3.75. The street expectation is 3.99 this year. A small gain of 6%. The stock went to 220 ~ . It has retreated down to 190 ~. without a down grade on the 3.99 expected eps. If they come in $4.15 we will see a price explosion with good forward guidance. should return to the 220 + range.
Lotto puts $180 way overbought. Let’s see for this month.
hope we can close above $210.00 today....holiday season should be fantastic for LOWE's....went by the store yesterday and they already have the Christmas stuff up....better get your stuff early because supplies are limited this year...
DOW UP 560 AND LOWES IS TANKING INTO RED-GUESS SOMETHING GOING ON IN THE BOILER ROOM AS THEY SAY!!!
"big move today.....share buyback, or blowout earnings...???"
"Just look at this stock as a very LONG term investment. Get it and forget it. I have held this stock for about 12 or so years. My average initial investment is around $20 per share. I have dripped it ever since because the interest was way more than any savings account. So, really, my initial investment is pulling around 7% in dividends now. It has reached my goal for retirement amount and I still have approximately 15 years to go.... Get it, drip it, and forget it"
LOWES HAVING GREAT QUARTER-STOCK PRICE SHOULD BE AROUND 240-HUGE HURRICANE SALES WILL JUST BE GRAVY ON TO OF GREAT EARNINGS FOR THIS QUARTER
To the MOON...there is NO SLOWDOWN in sales !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"bought more on yesterday's dip, let's go Lowes!!"
I agree with Wisdom of Crowds. Good time to buy imho. You have to be nuts to sell a duopoly that just raises its dividend 33% and 65 years running.
"It makes no sense to me how Lowe's can be down given such great last quarter news and forward guidance, while Gamestop's price is still the highest it's been since the autumn of 2015 and AMC theater's value is currently higher than it was in the immediate days prior to the pandemic. The stock market makes no sense to me whatsoever right now -- P/E ratios, forward guidance and quarterly reports mean nothing compared to memes some guy from Reddit posts on message boards. I can't help but believe a massive bubble is about to burst for the entire market."
LOW will be bought out by Ford by end if the year...
