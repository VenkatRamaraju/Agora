CNP announces internal spin of ENBL asset. I had to Google why a company might want to do that.Very interesting response. Either to offer ENABLE shares in exchange for CNP outstanding shares or give them as a dividend to shareholders. Hope the latest is true.....Could this be why CNP is up 3%....
Good beat eps and revenue with upward guidance. Give us our dividend back. Management screws up and shareholders pay the price. Yes CEO booted but board who should of over seen CEO still collecting their bonuses.
What is the news? This low PE stock was beaten down so much recently. Great value stock.
"CNP popped up on my radar during my research on utility companies.Of the major utility players, CNP seems to have one of the lowest share prices, highest dividends,and lowest PE's. I bought 1000 shares yesterday and today."
"From 247wallst:CenterPoint Energy Inc. (NYSE: CNP) was downgraded to Neutral from Outperform and the target price was lowered to $28 from $31 at Credit Suisse. The firm noted that the Houston electric rate case outcome came in worse than expected and that it was lowering earnings estimates as a result. SunTrust Robinson Humphrey downgraded it to Hold from Buy, and Guggenheim downgraded it to Neutral from Buy. The stock was down almost 5% at $26.69 on Thursday and was indicated down another 5.4% at $25.25 on Friday.Just took a Bull-Put position with Dec expiration for a 1.12 credit. If exercised, the base will be 24.88 (4.62 yield). CNP's been around for a long time and hasn't cut the dividend in 13-14 years. Oversold on any chart this morning. Comments ?"
My understanding is that Blackrock Inc. is accumulating more shares at this price. Good for the long positions.
I heard about CNP the other day on (http://Rightpicker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
Is it a good stock for long term investment ? As I’m new to the American market can you kindly recommend me some scripts that move well and pay good dividends. Thank you.
"The earning were just atrocious. Target 10 dollars-----CenterPoint Energy, Inc. CNP reported fourth-quarter 2019 adjusted earnings of 45 cents per share, which exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 37 cents by 21.6%. The bottom line also jumped 25% from the year-ago quarter’s 36 cents.The company’s GAAP earnings came in at 25 cents per share compared with the 18 cents registered in the prior-year quarter.For 2019, CenterPoint Energy posted adjusted earnings of $1.79 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.69 by 5.9%. Full-year earnings also improved 11.9% from the year-earlier tally of $1.60.""PS: Why would anyone want to owe a stock like this yielding 5% when 30 year T bonds are yielding 1.67% and 10 year T notes are yielding 1.12%."
"I received a hundred some shares of this stock as part of a spin off many years ago. Because I sold the parent company stock at a significant gain, I got these CNP shares (effectively) for free. I am enrolled in a DRP so those few shares are now 523 shares and my effective cost basis is 89 cents a share. So I will hold on to this for a long, long time and continue to accumulate more shares through the DRP. It might not be the best stock in the world but is doing good for me."
"Interesting conference call yesterday. Very positive news on getting this company moving ahead. David Lesar appears to be what they needed to lead them. December 7th Analyst meeting to unfold plans for the next 5 years. According to Lesar they are working with OGE to get fair value for Enable and are planning on investing substantial amounts of money in Houston Electric, Vectren Electric and the gass companies. To finance this they will sell one of two of the gas companies and of course borrow money. They will not issue a significant amount of new stock. Also finally brought on a veteran CFO. I see this stock moving back to $30+ over the next year or so."
"I looked over the technicals to see if I could find similar price action over history and the closest time I could find is back in 2008. During Oct-08, there were 37 Mil shares traded, a $4 price drop and a steep MACD negative slope. During November (current) there has been a $4.5 price drop, 37 mil shares traded and the same (or similar) MACD slope. Somehow, I just don't see an impact like 2008 coming from any potential TPUC final ruling and yet, that was the closest comparison. In '08, the price regained $3 by Dec-08 and completely recovered by Feb-09 (4-5 months) - still paid their dividend the whole time. While all of this was going on, there was doom and gloom in the media 'cause everyone was going bankrupt, revenues were crashing, etc., etc., etc."
4.3% dividend; hitting numbers ; low cost of capital for the foreseeable future; what’s not to like ...
"Russell you seem very knowledgeable about Utilities. I own 3 TX Utilities CNP, NRG, and VST. All three have been very volatile and in a downtrend when other utes are going up. Any ideas why? Concerns about TX PUC or low prices on forward prices in ERCOT? Thanks"
"Seems like the perfect buying time, CNP has always been a great stock for me."
"Less then a month ago, on the CC they said they had raised the Dividend the past 10 years and raised again this year and planed on raising 1 - 3 % per year the next 2 or 3 years. They said they are netting around 1 Billion from the sale of the services sectors soon and they can use that money to pay down debt or do whatever they want really. This is a utility company with pretty much steady income, I mean not many people decide to just stop paying for electricity or gas for there homes. If so it's the last thing to cut. My point is at these prices getting that dividend which was pretty much solid as it gets, what an opportunity... IMO..... Strong Buy"
A big thank you to Goldman Sachs for recommending CNP (because of its safe dividend) just two days before CNP cuts its dividend. Unbelievable.
Not sure why everyone is dumping CNP. Company is great considering that it provides transmission to the city of Houston which is over 1+Million residentialls. That's like passive income that it receive year over year. That's why it's able to acquire so many other companies. Bullish!
Believe rate case was approved on PUC TX website.
"The company is ok. After analysts revision, next Q = 0.37, this year =1.69 and next year=1.7. Forward PE 14. Revenue continues to grow. Price target $27. Div=4%. Time to buy when it is low."
