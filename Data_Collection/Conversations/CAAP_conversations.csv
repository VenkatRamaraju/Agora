"THE MERVAL IS TWISTING AND TURNING AROUND 38,390. ON THE CLOSE OF APRIL 21,2021 WITH CAAP @4.80, BMA @ 12.72,GGAL@7.23,AND BBAR@2.63. THE CAAP HAS TRIED UNSUCCESSFULLY TO PUSH ITS WAY FORWARD THROUGH $5.BUT THIS BARRIERIS LIKELY TO BE OVERCOME SOON AS THE OVERHEAD RESISTANCE IS CHEWED-AWAY WITH EACH ATTEMPT. THE THREE BANKS MENTIONED ARE MOVING AROUND AS IF THEY ARE STANDING ON A BAR OF SOAP.,FALLING BACKWARDS AND UNABLE TO STABILIZE THEMSELVES. FOR THOSE OF US BRAVE-ENOUGH OR MAYBE,FOOLISH-ENOUGH,BMA AND CAAP LOOK TO ME ASGOOD PROXIES ON AN EVENTUAL TURN IN THE FORTUNES OF ARGENTINA;ON THE OTHER END OF THETELESCOPE,THEY ALSO REPRESENT THE PERILS OF INVESTING IN THE ARGENTINE STOCK MARKET."
