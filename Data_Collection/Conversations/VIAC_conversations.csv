"can someone explain to me. how a stock that has so so many valuations 50$+ cannot hold on to any gains? is it really manipulation? doesn't it make sense to let it climb. Then you can do the same ""manipulation"" but at the higher price point? just the cost of the calls and puts is adjusted."
maybe this daily fluctuations are institutions loading up. then traders selling.
Sandi the front desk is asking that you settle your bill with a valid credit card. I just passed the front desk and heard them talking about you.
"They make 13 billion a year, and have a p/e of 10. Am i missing something?"
This stock is sooooo cheap as many have noted. A research report could send the shares flying. Meanwhile accumulate big and often
"Manipulation.Goldman Sachs is pumping to 75,00They cannot sell the Viacom so they have to manipulate it themselves to $75,00, to keep the promise."
What's moving this +2% in the pre-market?
Paw Patrol is doing well at the box office despite Covid delta variant. This movie will put Paramount plus over the top as the critics and mother's reviews are very positive.
"It seems Soros simply saw the Archegos situation as a way to make a quick buck. When the bounce he was expecting did not occur, he sold. This can very well explain why VIAC stock has underperformed in spite of great earnings. Other funds that do track VIAC fundamentals (Fidelity, Goldman) did accumulate during Q2."
VIAC continues to show weakness and that means trouble here soon. VIAC struggles to stay above $41/$42 and will continue to do so but when market corrects and it will by end of year or early next year this will be take down similar to last year. We wont see $10 but could see $24
Active negotiations confirmed. :-)
"Question....would you want to be Short Viacom over the Weekend, Maybe, but every Friday as we move Towards next quarters BLOW OUT Earnings Coming AGAIN, Shorts have to be Wondering, Is This The Weekend , that the MM, Big Block BUYERS decide there coming in Monday, if your short, and get caught being Short over the weekends ahead, Shorts are going to get Thrashed, on a Coming Monday very soon...Conversely,ALL Buyers waiting to Come in VIAC at some point, have to pick a Price Target and Time to Start Buying Big Volumes, and that times coming, so BUYERS, Dont Bottom Fish Anymore, You Snooze you""ll Lose, and Possibly one Monday Soon , Markets open to a BUYOUT of VIACOM,so be LONG NOW!!BUY BUY BUY, TICKER VIAC, opinion only g luck"
I’m missing Mr. Hwang.
"where can I find a stock with a 7 pe that pays a 3 percent dividend,growing,and might get bought.hmmmmm"
When this goes above 42 with good vol ... Forgetaboutit !
"I'm a little complex as to why the share price can not stay above $40!!So much great news and earnings, getting a little frustrated.With or without a buy-out, this company should be trading at a minimum of $62.50/Share"
Well I was wrong .. I admit it … I really thought that this would pull back a little today … 3 days green has only happens a time or two since crash. Tomorrow will be the real test… it has never closed 4 days green since the crash.
"Not so crazy idea: netflix should buy them out. I don't see why not, its the perfect match. Netflix wants to get into live TV, viac got it. Netflix wants to sell games, viac got it. Netflix wants to sell merchandise in their new store, viac has all the IP needed and the supply chain relationships to build merchandise.Netflix purchasing viac would make them actual rivals to disney. VIAC owns a theme park too i think, or at the very least they own all the characters licensed to it. Another huge asset often not even mentioned is Bellator. Viacom owns the only real threat to the UFC. Imagine if Netflix started airing live MMA fights or even the superbowl. It would be huge for them"
"I see desperate manipulation. Out of 4 millions traded in first 1 hour about, 2 million was dumped to attempted to trigger the stop loss weak hands. Some bigger thing is happening, the short are making chance to cover before the buyout.Just my positive prediction."
AMC overtook ViaC again!
News tomorrow?

"Jeff Bezos will soon pick up the phone, call his #1 henchman who will then say to the other henchmonkeys… “Buy VIAC now it’s too cheap.”VIAC will be Over 42 dollars today.."
Looking at management trending reports they show Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization for every business line except for Streaming. Each line of business shows a decline for Q2 2021 vs. 2020 and all 3 show a decline vs. Q1. Since streaming is not broken out separately it must be in the Corporate line which only shows a minor change. I am not following how that sinks up with the narrative that content investment for streaming is the reason for the year over year decline in EPS. I was positive on the Q2 earnings call but trying to understand why the market is not responding. Too much noise on here about shorts and so on. Facts seen in the #'s are not as inspiring as the messaging which sounds really positive.
Big block buy at 12:45 ET.Some one should have very good source of information. Shorts can not sleep overnight.Big deal on the horizon. I see $$$ 75.00 not far awy.
Whoever shorts a company that is actively up for sale deserves to lose their money
Nice to see some 'firm upside' today!
"I don't normally use margin but I bought 500 shares on margin at 38.49. I do not understand this price action. The overbought S&P 500 turned positive, yet one of the most undervalued stocks in the entire market went the opposite way."
Buy Ticker >>VIAC $5 dollar discount NotViaca!!G luck
"Tony: The stock is up 1% on a terrible tape. Plus, the shorts won't come on here and take their beating. They only pop off when the stock is down"
"How can a company which makes 1.1 million dollars Gross revenue per employee be junk? No other company makes money like that. Right now people are just chasing the Las Vegas stock market.Viacom also pays a dividend, but nobody has any patience anymore."
Someone put a big put option order for 2023 thinking that this stock would fall between $20 and $35. Or this option could be hedging against a huge long share position.
I saw Sandi sticking for sale signs out in the hamptons front yards...

"Wells comments:""Wells Fargo analyst Steven Cahall upgraded ViacomCBS to Overweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $60, up from $45. The analyst says the company's streaming efforts are ""bearing fruit and have impressed us,"" so he's moving from ""historical bears to constructive bulls."" The upcoming slate for Paramount+ should maintain the ViacomCBS's momentum, and the company is ""one of the better bets for industry consolidation,"" Cahall tells investors in a research note.

"This is the prelude to the sale of the company. They know that the DOJ would not allow a straight buyout of VIAC by Comcast, so they are ""playing around the edges"". They will figure out how to get it done thru a third player. My prediction is that it will be Disney or Netflix. GLTA"
"A couple interesting articles, one from New York Post, one from Investor Place, both in the last week, discussing Shari Redstone's ownership of controlling shares of VIAC. Worth the read."
"Viacom and Comcast will be starting a joint streaming venture for the European market. This is great news for building streaming growth. This combo now becomes a very substantial offering, making it much easier to justify signing up for the streaming service. Great expansion potential."
"From a Doug Kass tweet:Wells Fargo moves from neutral to overweight on Viacom and raises its price from $45 to $60. Analyst Cahill cites that VIAC's streaming efforts are ""bearing fruit and have impressed us"" and he is moving from being ""an historical bear to a constructive bull.""

"$41.29 is the 8/20/21 closing price needed to minimize profits for all long holders of expiring 8/20/21 calls and puts. Per Yahoo finance, there are currently 371,541 call/put contracts controlling 37,154,100 shares (more than 2 times the average daily trading volume). Based on the current $38.69 stock price, I will be curious to see how this $41.29 target plays out (+6.7%)."
Bottom tested again and held.

Simce August 17th in an uptrend.
Foggy and Giggles are moving on from their latest debacle to...you guessed it. Let them re imagine the economy for us. Say a 1930s type of an economy.
I am fully convinced that this company is in negotiations to sell itself...but that is beyond the point. Can we move the discussion on to what people think the bid might need to be for Shari to agree to a sale? Reasonable responses greatly appreciated. I think $50 to $52 reasonable with $55 maybe attainable.
Is there any meaning to the spread between the VIACA shares and the VIAC (B shares)? In Q4 2020 and early 2021 the spread was under $1. Since the Archegos chaos it widened to $3 to $5. In the past week it has trended back up to the $4+ level.Probably meaningless. Just curious to understand why anyone would pay $4 to $5 more for the right to vote when Shari already has the controlling vote anyway.
"""This agreement follows the previously announced strategic review of non-core assets that we completed shortly after our merger,"" said Naveen Chopra, EVP and Chief Financial Officer, ViacomCBS. ""The use of proceeds from this transaction will remain consistent with our previously discussed capital allocation strategy, allowing us further financial flexibility to invest in our strategic growth priorities, including streaming."""

Takeover or acquired…. Regardless of what it is I still think the dollar tree is interested in buying them out. I’ve heard many conversations and rumors in the Hollywood elite and Silicon Valley that dollar tree is looking to buy them out.

After hours has almost no meaning. Volume during regular trading today was only 8 million shares - about half of average daily.
I am saddened everytime I look at my position here. This stock was supposed to be at deep discount and do great things. Instead it has done literally nothing and I am forever bag holding.
There you go spreading a little bait out there

It should be noted that the Wells Fargo analyst has been a skeptic in the past regarding VIAC’s streaming plans. The fact that he is now a believer is significant.

Chinese baba stocks that get cut in half overnight.Zoom stocks which go from 350 to 290 overnight, because there's 9 other tech alternatives.Pton bikes made from Chinese parts that after six months people don't even use anymore.HmmmBut media, which has controllable overhead, can incrementally raise its price, is constantly adding subscribers and more importantly content.... content will never stop or get outdated.. and they all pay dividends.....oh no.... don't want that.Country has gone crazy."
The only rational explanation of why VIAC share price does not move up is DEBT. Market Cap. is not much higher than their debt pile of 18 Billion .
"Well folks........why not just take out the $40 dollar calls and puts along with the 42's.....right?Just place your bet......buy the stock, collect your dividends on VIAC....and walk away.......just forget about it........then sometime during the next 12 months you will wake up one morning with a nice profit.....and you will not likely see it coming even the day before........until then.......over and out my friends......"

"Approaching 100,000 shares traded pre-market and few of the less than 10 share trades used to manipulate the pricing.Could the value of VIAC finally be getting realized?"
"I've taken the last 6 months as an opportunity to load up on this ticker as it trades sideways. ~20,000 shares strong and will continue up to 55.if you've looked at the Financials, the value is there. buy it before the masses realize and this runs up to the 70'sjust my thoughts"
Any significance to 1.5 million shares dumped at the close?
"book value is 31, pe is under 10 with growing revenue, we're fine. I hope for 35 to finish my position before the bounce but no guarantee of that"
"Here is what is somewhat annoying to me and hard to fully embrace VIAC. If you look at the minute by minute trading pattern between VIAC and DISCA it is virtually identical. Take the YMB summary chart for the day than switch over to DISCA and you will swear you are looking at the same page. So while these companies are similar they are not identical. However with most of the daily trades, they are treated as one. As many have mentioned here, does it really matter what news comes out for VIAC, upgrades by analysts, positive articles, earnings, sales of assets, ... IMO no. Nothing really matters. It is locked into some agenda that appears to be the same agenda as DISCA. These are not identical companies in anyway and it is annoying the market typically treats them as one."
Free Guy number 1 at the box office and Paw Patrol #2 at $13M. That is a GREAT showing considering it is not a movie for all ages. The bigger message is that VIAC can compete and win in animation. Look out Disney.
If Shari really wants to sell her and Backish need to be intimately aware of the advantages to any prospective buyer and pitch them the advantages accordingly which is the smart thing to do. Tell Apple why they’d be so much better off paying 70 billion for VIAC. Every phone Apple TV or pad sold would automatically have Pluto Tv. Subscriptions jump to 100 million and ad revenues triple. Every phone gets free Paramount+ for a year - subscriber numbers triple and again as revenues triple!AAPL makes money from their phone and the ads watched on their phone. Netflix and Amazon don’t seem to have much synergies as AAPL.If u sell the hardware and have paramount and Pluto pre installed?! Isn’t it obvious you get Disney and Netflix subscriber numbers almost overnight!
EVERYTHING is for sale at the right price. If Warren Buffett waved $75 per share under Sherri's nose: Done and done!
Battle of the bots
The short interest in VIAC has pretty much stayed the same for the last three months. In my opinion this means most traders do not expect this stock to drop much and it should be a good growth stock from here.
Pretty amazing how VIAC refuses to go up. Balance sheet is vastly improved from company earning nearly $2 billion in profits this year and from selling $1.6 billion in stock at the tippy top. Mgmg seems to be on a role. Stock should start to reflect improved results
"EPS of $5.33 - at a 15 multiple, the stock should be trading at nearly $80. DIS forward multiple is 37. Comcast's multiple is 21. That would be VIAC at nearly $112. I look forward to the day when fundamental valuation matters again!"

"The current market narrative is that VIAC needs more scale or that it needs to be acquired. However, in terms of growth in the streaming arena, VIAC is doing great on its own. Just look at the growth numbers (for P+ and Showtime). They’re growing faster than Disney+ and Netflix. This doesn’t even cover Pluto TV’s dominance in AVOD."

I will now type up what I said in more vague worded words.An organization from social media has once again made a stock surge upward. As a result, big money investors were stuck with big losses.Value stocks were doing fine premarket until minutes before opening bell. I therefore am speculating/guessing that what has happened was big money suffering big losses from.this stock that has surged a lot before today and today again.Situation reversed itself as big money had to cover their short selling losses by selling off value stocks like VIAC. So value was higher premarlet and then WAM lower.Other big money and retail money swooped in and bought the dip. We are now almost GREEN!"
If I were at Netflix I would be looking to buy VIAC
If they sell the CBS studio they can merge with COMCAST and use VIAC theaters and combine streaming.This would compete with Disney both with old content and a new ability to outproduce content. Netflix would have to compete on there own content. CBS studios is one thing that gets in the way of all the regulatory. If that is taken out of the equation. . .

I like the stock for long term but I just don't think this will rise smoothly to the $60 dollar mark.

"It’s worthwhile to reiterate that volume is still low enough to allow hedge fund manipulation. Clearly that’s what’s going on. You would do well to rewatch, or watch if you haven’t yet seen, Jim Cramer‘s Utube video “how hedge funds manipulate stock prices.” It’s from an interview he did many years ago when he was a hedge fund manager, before he became a big financial TV star. It will definitely open your eyes. More and more people are recognizing the value here, and at some point share purchases will overwhelm the ability of the hedge funds to short this equity, and the share price will rocket northward."
this should be trading around 60 even without any takeover

"Let's compare recent streaming results...

Get those for ""free"" if valuation is strictly based on streaming subscribers. Netflix only added 1.5M subs last quarter and VIAC added 6.5M. VAIC is so ridiculously undervalued.... ---------------Clips from Forbes, Aug 24th Netflix: Despite a sluggish second quarter, Netflix remains the category leader in the streaming wars. In the second quarter 2021, Netflix added 1.5 million net new subscribers globally (compared to ten million in second quarter 2020). In the U.S./Canada market, subscriber counts had fallen by 430,000 totaling 73 million subscribers.Netflix first expanded globally in 2010 when it entered the Canadian market, the following year Netflix was launched in Latin America and the Caribbean. Netflix is now available in 190+ markets worldwide with 209 million paying subscribers, a year-over-year increase of 8%.ViacomCBS: In second quarter 2021 ViacomCBS announced the addition of 6.5 net new streaming subscribers, giving them a total of 42 million globally. Although most of the increase came from Paramount+, subscriber counts also include Showtime, Noggin and BET+. ViacomCBS also said the ad supported streamer PlutoTV now has 52 million active global users, up from 50 million in the first quarter. On the strength of Paramount+, ViacomCBS has set a goal of 65 million to 75 million global streaming subscribers by 2024. Paramount+ is available in Scandinavia, Latin America and most recently Australia. The SkyShowtime agreement will make Paramount+ available in 22 western Europe markets and replace their presence in Scandinavia. PlutoTV is already available in a number of western European markets."

"Anyone selling or shorting VIAC at this level needs to have their head examined. They're in the process of shedding core assets to pay down debt and arrange a sale, and they pay a great dividend next month. Even if VIAC is not acquired, analysts agree the stock is worth over $52."
What is with this stock!! Still can’t get moving after all this time. Makes no sense what so ever!
Some folks may wonder why VIAC is selling a studio at a time when media content production has become so valuable. It should be noted that VIAC has another giant studio (Paramount) in the same area. They did not need to keep both studios.
"Method Shortists (Melvin Capital) use to keep the stock down!: source: https://www.griproom.com/fun/10-signs-your-stock-is-being-manipulated9. High short volume, low short interest.These numbers must be reported accurately to financial regulators. They can’t hide the overall short interest in the long run. But what they can do is cover their short before the short interest is reported.This becomes obvious when short volume is high, say 45%, but total short interest is low, say 3%. If 45% of a stock’s volume is people borrowing and selling, then you’d expect the total short interest to be huge.But it’s not. They hide it by covering their short position before the day is over.So, if you notice a large amount of volume before the end of the day, or right at the bell…some of that volume is the shorts covering their position so they don’t increase the overall short interest and draw the attention of investors/short squeezers."

"Here is how to defeat the market manipulators. This is just for discussion and I am absolutely not recommending anyone do this as this is insaneSet up 2 different broker accountsMap out the process of buying 1 share of VIAC into a Macro that activates in 1 second intervals.Map out the process of selling Viac 1 share in a macro that sells 1 share in 1 second intervals.These 2 accounts don't need any money to do their stuff. The buyer buys on margin (borrowing money) and the seller is shorting and thus borrowing shares to short.Macro A: Short Seller starts at market price and then increases the share price by 1 penny every second.Macro B: Buys 1 share at market price and increases buying price by 1 penny every second.Now you effectively have the equivalent of 2 high speed trading machines but they are doing the opposite thing of the market manipulators What should happen is the share price should trade sideways all day long with short terms blips up and down as other buyers and sellers do their thing.So, in a 3rd Broker Account you have your actual real account. That account sells puts and buys shares a few times during the day to put the stalemate in favor of a higher price.Of course, this would be super insane for an individual retailer to pull off and require ridiculous amount of risk. But, that in a nutshell is what Goldman Sachs can do to the Market Manipulators. Simply just reverse their scheme with Macros or actual high speed trading machines programmes to keep hitting the stock with orders every second until closong bell and then walking the stock up with a third machine / account that holds the real buying power."

"Theories as to today’s rise (feel free to add your own):1) Buyout brewing.2) Institutions and whales finally realize the ridiculously, insanely cheap share price here and moving in.3) Hedge funds temporarily boosting share price so as to sucker in more call buyers that they can later shaft (unlikely, with the volume we’re seeing here).4) Hedge funds who had been shorting ViacomCBS to collect options premiums now flipping the script and going long before it’s too late."
Looks like most media stocks are trending higher today...

Some are down playing the quality of the subs added by Disney as being lower value accounts. VIAC subscription streaming revenues were up 82% while subscribers were up 65%. Average rev per subscriber was $11.11 per quarter in Q2 2020 vs. $12.29 in Q2 2021. So the combined average benefit of 65% more users and 10% better revenue per user drove the 82% revenue increase.VIAC advertising streaming revenues were up 102% while users were up 58%. Avg rev per user was $8.41 in Q2 2020 vs. $9.45 in Q2 2021. The average revenue per user for the advertising model increased 12.4%.The increase in average revenue per user would be due to an increase in the # of users and existing users consuming more. Every way I look at the VIAC #'s they look strong on both a stand alone basis and vs. competition. Not understanding why the stock does not reflect it.

No where I look do I find an intrinsic value or fair value price of: $20 or $35 or $45.The Fair Value or Intrinsic Value is a low of $85 but more typically $125 to $130.VIAC reached $101 earlier this year and will re-visit and probably exceed that price again.People advocating a $50 to $60 stock price just might be aiming too low."

"From Tipranks:“The company posted revenues of $6.56 billion, up 8% year-over-year, while global streaming revenue jumped 92% year-over-year to $983 million.Furthermore, the company added 6.5 million streaming subscribers globally in Q2 to reach 42 million subscribers. VIAC’s streaming subscription revenues rose 82% year-over-year to $481 million in Q2. (See ViacomCBS stock chart on TipRanks)Following the Q2 results, Goldman Sachs analyst Brett Feldman was pleasantly surprised to see that “VIAC is showing much more durable momentum with its flagship streaming service (Paramount+) than we had expected.”The analyst pointed out that the company’s streaming service generated more net additions in Q2 “than its launch quarter in 1Q (6.0mn), it did this during a period when most other streaming services showed material deceleration.”Analyst Feldman ascribed upside potential to the streaming subscriber and revenue estimates, on the basis of VIAC’s “upcoming market launches, robust slate of content and new distribution agreement with Sky.”Reflecting his upbeat approach to the stock, the analyst reiterated a Buy and a price target of $75 (88.8% upside) on the stock.Turning to the rest of the Street, consensus is that ViacomCBS is a Strong Buy, based on 6 Buys and 2 Holds. The average ViacomCBS price target of $62.75 implies an approximately 58% upside potential from current levels.“"

"If you are (as I am) disappointed with VIAC, here is my explanation.It's sad, but great fundamentals don't matter. There is nothing wrong with VIAC : extremely low P/E, rising profits, rising cash flow etc. etc.Unfortunatelly there is every week big options activity with CALLs/PUTs ratio always in big favour of CALLs.And so, the only fundament which matters in current rigged options market is CALL and PUT open interest.How it works and when can we finally expect the breakout to fair price?As I said in my last post, there was again huge difference between CALLs/PUTs open interest this week at strike price $40. So market makers defend this level as a resistance and they are shorting underlying VIAC shares, every week after week. They simply don't want to pay premium to option holders.That's also the reason, why there is still high % of shorted float. Otherwise it has no sense to short a company like VIAC with such a low P/E and good and rising earnings, there are many many other possibilities if you want to short any company.The change will come, when option traders will finally give up to buy CALL options or when there will be any strong catalyst. In this case market makers will cover their accumulated short positions and the price will suddenly rise up as a rocket.It's frustrating, but IMO that's the story of many shares, not only VIAC."

During the MM manipulation where the stock slowly drifts below $40 I saw that the share volume behaved like this:1 share.....1 share......1 share......4 shares.....1 share.....1 share.....3.shares.......1 share.....1 share......1.share.....7 shares.....100 shares....1 share....1 share.....ways falling back to a single share volume....blip blip blip blip.....like 2 high speed trading machines trading VIAC back and forth 1 share.at a time to buy the stock a penny lower each time.
I get worried when insiders are selling. Sheri isn't selling. Why should I?
"I think that the market is ""underestimating"" the power of VIAC to compete with Disney on animated TV and theater releases. Here is how I will prove this statement......Watch for the numbers concerning PAW PATROL on Monday. That will say it all. I have a lot of nieces and nephews and they are excited beyond control. GL"
"Just sharing this information, (I'm rounding the numbers). The VIAC CFO was granted 68K RSU's (restricted stock units) in August as part of the stock option plan for senior executives. This is an annual reward of the shares that are vested 4 years from now. Here's the interesting part......many times when this is done the executive sells an appropriate number of shares to cover the taxes on receiving the shares at a cost of $0. In this case the CFO did NOT sell his RSU's to cover the taxes but instead had 24K shares ""withheld"" by VIAC to cover the future tax liability. If the stock is going to be much higher in the future you don't want to sell them today just to cover your taxes on the gain.......that is why they are withheld NOT sold . I think this speaks volumes as it is not the normal procedure of executives in other companies I follow that receive stock options (RSU's). Take the message."
"and now that everyone has sold,the selling pressure should now turn into an upward trend !"
"there are more ""in the know"" than anyone here. they know more about what is going on behind the scenes with the financial health of the company. those that did their DD, found $85 to be a worthy price of the stock.. and look at the number of hedge funds... (went from 44 to 89) you don't see that large of an increase because they don't feel the company is ""undervalued"" or not going to do well. ... even if counted each HF and investment bank as just one individual.. those numbers exceed the average number of us here that share opinions. the public comments and actions of the company so far have been nothing short of impressive. the synergies from the viac cbs merger have not even been fully recognized. add in several ""deals"" and the new sky agreement (which will expose viac to 20+ mil new possible subs... it only will be a matter of time before viac makes its run. just sit back and enjoy the roller coaster. it will be worth the price of admission."
It’s hard to conclude anything from Gasparino’s comments. He says VIAC is indeed for sale but that VIAC’s size may prevent certain buyers (eg tech?) from acquiring it. He says that private equity is the most likely route.
"it's like someone had to nudge VIAC off the couch like the DUDE to GET UP - ""Hey, the market is up HUGE, you can't just sit there - look, even the Chinese cos. that are getting delisted are up 5-10%"" - VIAC stumbles up and hits the fridge (that's the $0.20-$0.30 green you see here). Let's hope she stays up!"
Thought about buying more here or on any dip but........I am concerned about the Nasdaq and if we are in for a considerable correction. unless there isa buyout we will be subject to a downturn.any thoughts????
Nice turnaround form premarket. Looked like it was heading for another Red day . Let's finish Strong !
"Now over 80,000 shares pre-market."
"While a report that a private jet belonging to Berkshire was flying to Norwood seems like a scene from ""Wall St."", VIAC is exactly the kind of business BRK would take a huge position in"
Red markets=Green VIAC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Do you remember, that before the internetit was thought the cause of collectivestupidity was the lack of access to information?Well, we now know .................... it wasn't that"
Nice performance 4 days in a row…. Very low volume
Even though we were down a buck yesterday...I still see some resilience in this stock. The 4 days up and one day down...Almost recovered what was lost yesterday....previously we may have recovered 30 cents out of a buck loss on the previous day. Acting with a lot more stability and resilience. Looking more positive for this stock.
"Look at Zoom Communications. A pandemic Woopie Wonder Stock getting Wolloped. Value stocks like VIAC don't suffer 20+% nose dives. Just drops a dollar or so and then pops right back up to Party Town.Investors of Wall Street, stop buying overpriced Woopie Wonder Tech Stocks and start buying Value companies like Viac that are set to have one amazing growth year in 2022. Once all the assets are sold, big chunk of debt paid off, ViacomCBS can put its Billions to work while riding along with solid free operating cash flow.VIAC is set to go from reasonable amount of content to OMG!!! in 1 short year in my opinion."
Today will be the lowest volume day in VIAC since December 30. Very telling.
"ATTENTION ATTENTION ATTENTIONS. Redstone has said that she is going to ""wait until next year"" to explore her options.I beleive her.Until then VIAC management is going to clean up the balance sheet and move forward with streaming.VIAC management has every incentive to make VIAC as appealing as possible to any potential acquirer, but also realize VIA may have to go it alone.This can / should result in the stock price firming and probably rising.But the merger and ""really big gains"" are next year."
Apple vs Bezos
I heard about VIAC the other day on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
news coming
"I have not seen any estimates on how much VIAC could get for that Studio City property they recently put up for sale. However, I saw that CBS sold a TV studio, also in the Los Angeles area, on December 2018. The property was smaller than the Studio City property: 25 acres vs 40 acres. CBS sold it for $750M. Based on that deal, I think VIAC should easily get more than $1B for the new property they have on sale."
Forget the small potatoes talks of a 60 80 100 per share buyout. Then what? I want to see this company become a media/streaming powerhouse running alongside netflix and disney. 200+ per share in the next 5-10 years for a 125 billion market cap and up the div every year while I wait. That's my plan. I have faith Redstone sees things the same way.
"2.35% dividend. 7 PE. $1.1 million dollars gross revenue per employee. $487K gross profit per employee.OPEN .... YOUR......EYES ...... Wall STreet gamblers......who are out there buying 1500 PE, no dividend, no profit, all hyped up dreams. Makes......No......Sense."
