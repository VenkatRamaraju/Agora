"Anyone selling or shorting VIAC at this level needs to have their head examined. They're in the process of shedding core assets to pay down debt and arrange a sale, and they pay a great dividend next month. Even if VIAC is not acquired, analysts agree the stock is worth over $52."
"Just read the article on the 16 most profitable media companies.Revenue to market value, viac is the most undervalued by far."
"Netflix is up $50~to $60 in 1 week for no reason.They may bloating itself to issue stock offer of $50 billions, and get away with free Viacom with no blood on their hand. We will see it soon. May be apple is doing the same thing, they are up record high on grim future of one ""phoney"" trick."
This stock is worth at least 60
"Who, in their right mind, is selling today because of an event manufactured to artificially depress stock prices? Options expiration? how does that affect the fundamentals of VIAC - or any company?"
"Pegged it to the penny, this game is starting to get easy, FREE MONEY!!! Thanks VIAC"
VIAC short interest explodes to 54.4 million shares. Wow. Can't wait til they all start covering....
right at 20dma interesting how it happens 40.28
"VIAC is worth almost exactly the same amount as it was on Aug 5 when I paid $39.00/ea for 5,000 shares... Now, I am neither happy nor satisfied, while volume has collapsed 50% since then."
If we have b class stock we get dividend too?
"It’s clear that Paramount+ has the best content for kids than any other streaming service, and THAT INCLUDES DISNEY+. Just ask any parent with young kids. When, on top of that, Americans realize what Paramount+ will be offering in terms of NFL programming, Paramount+ will become a must-have streaming service among US TV viewers."
"Viacom just sold their CBS headquarters in New York= Just put up for sale the massive CBS Radford Studios in Studio City, & Now splitting their TV (CBS) away from the core Paramount entity, so one question: Is Viacom preparing to jettison CBS in order to be purchased by Comcast (NBC) so their are no conflicts?"
Paw Patrol just surpassed 65 million dollars at the box office. Not bad at all!!!!! This is what really matters!!!!
One of the best upside stocks in next 2 months....OR LESS
"What is VIAC worth? Today the market says $40. GS says $75 as a stand alone public company. But what about to a strategic buyer? And there are numerous potential strategic buyers - Comcast, Disney, Amazon, Apple, Hulu, etc. They would all love to have the VIAC assets and I believe at some point we will see an offer which may start a bidding war driving to stop price higher than GS’ price target. If I were the CEO of any potential strategic buyer, I would get out in front of any bidding war but insist on a billion + break up fee. That way my shareholders win either way - we get the trophy assets or a billion + dollars. I certainly wouldn’t sit on my hands and let my competitors buy VIAC and I certainly wouldn’t be short the stock. You might make few bucks in the short term but wake up to very sizable losses when an acquisition is announced."
"It’s worthwhile to reiterate that volume is still low enough to allow hedge fund manipulation. Clearly that’s what’s going on. You would do well to rewatch, or watch if you haven’t yet seen, Jim Cramer‘s Utube video “how hedge funds manipulate stock prices.” It’s from an interview he did many years ago when he was a hedge fund manager, before he became a big financial TV star. It will definitely open your eyes. More and more people are recognizing the value here, and at some point share purchases will overwhelm the ability of the hedge funds to short this equity, and the share price will rocket northward."
"At some point, enthusiastic buyers of the stock will overwhelm what the hedge funds are willing to risk too short it back down each week. Not sure when that day will come, hopefully soon, especially with the increased visability that ViacomCBS and it’s winning conglomeration are getting lately."
"I suspect this is ultimately to facilitate the sale of the company in two parts, to be able to clear regulatory hurdles in place against owning another broadcast network (CBS) by certain interested entities:(Reuters) - ViacomCBS Inc said on Monday it is restructuring the operations of its Paramount Pictures' movie and television production unit, in a broader shakeup aimed at ramping up content on its cable and streaming services.The company said Paramount's television arm will be run as a separate entity under the leadership of David Nevins, chief executive officer of Showtime Networks.With more people flocking to streaming services for entertainment, the move will allow the company to focus on its rebranded Paramount+ streaming platform as well as its cable networks Showtime and PlutoTV."
"Two of the biggest banks have Viacom at $50-60. When buying AMC at an average of $3's, I told all that AMC was a $30 stock. Of course, I was laughed at by all but the longs. As for Viacom my start is $52, but I'm willing to reach into the $60's when the news hits."
Sheri Redstone: you have the chance of a lifetime to demolish the short hedge funds which have been working so hard to demolish you. Time to get the sale of ViacomCBS done!
Viacom is a good example of how much the market is manipulated. NASDAQ PE pushing 45. give me a break
I wish my football team was in the red zone as much as VIAC. Sell off into the close.
Free Guy number 1 at the box office and Paw Patrol #2 at $13M. That is a GREAT showing considering it is not a movie for all ages. The bigger message is that VIAC can compete and win in animation. Look out Disney.
VIAC should go on offense and buy AMC Networks and Lionsgate. They have a lot of debt to be bought
All together now.......can you spell MANIPULATION..........?LOL
There will be a morning we wake up to the Buyout headline and longs will rejoice!
$75++ stock selling for $42Back up the 18 wheelers.
"It is best to wait until it is safe, health wise, to release Top Gun 2 and all other feature filmsto maximize the potential audienceEveryone knows it is beyond VIAC's control, regard less what they post"
"Note to just-arriving newbie shorts, so as to give you the lay of the land here:The only thing that is keeping this equity from exploding northward is the hedge funds that are spending between 10 and $20 million a week to short it down so as to collect an even larger net sum on the call premiums that they are selling. At any moment, if it suits them and they feel it will be more profitable, they can “flip the script“ and go long and this stock will rise so fast it’ll make your head spin. VIAC is a very profitable growing company that is hitting on all cylinders, paying down debt, blowing through earnings estimates each quarter, and very likely to be acquired by another entity at a significant premium in the next 36 months. It is currently being restructured so as to make clearing regulatory hurdles when acquired by another corporation less of an issue, more specifically enabling CBS to be split off and go in a separate direction should this be necessary. Knowing all of this, if you feel bold, short away."
Who said the following - earlier in August:ViacomCBS Inc. (VIAC): 2Q21 Review: Raising revenue estimates on improved streaming momentum; Maintain Buy and $75 PT
Low volume selling... no worries. Shorts will pay for their actions when any buyout offer hits.
Wait for it.........next week Bob Backish speaking at the Goldman Sachs Media/Communications conference. He will clear it up for everyone.
support justice for j6 political prisioners
"Does anybody think that ViacomCBS should get involved in the fastest growing part of the entertainment business called eSports. The younger generation is flocking to eSports not only to play but also to watch tournaments. Check out the eSports arenas being built.Sumner Redstone the founder of Viacom, once invested in Video Games back in the day, not much came of it but I think he had the right idea.Viacom has a nice Sports Portfolio and this would add to it. They have a lot of younger viewers that would be interested in that sport. They could have an esports channel on paramount + .Also eSports gambling is starting to grow. I just think this could be a great opportunity for them."
I can’t wait to see the Bob Bakish’s participation in the Goldman Sachs conference next week. GS has a $75 price target on VIAC. I think this conference will be an absolute love fest for VIAC.
bought 1500 more today 39.2. this will rally. I hope
Where’s Archegos? This stock could use another whale 
"ViacomCBS CFO speaking at the BofA Media, Communications and Entertainment conference next Tuesday ""could"" give a BIG lift to the shares if he talks about how everything is going as planned."
"Comment ....i see where folks posting Sheri Redstone will NEVER sell Viacom, i disagree, she controls her large Family trust , shes not getting any younger, her time is shorter and she very well might want More time To Herself to pursue many other things , she could Lock in Perpetuity a Ton of Money for all the trust Holders, AND, also its not like she has to Totally get rid of Viacom per say, if she were to sell , she can as part of the Deal, take STOCK in Whoever Might Buy OUT Viacom possibly, and Tons of Cash to Boot, so in a sense shed still be in the game, just under a different company and simply a Large shareholder of whoever might Buy Viacom in Future , if ever....i feel theres something Brewing with Viacom for sure, Spinning its wheels, mgmt. so quite, Low volume, but yet Netflix flying, Just to Big of Positives for Viacom not to be OVER the MARGIN TANKING, Viacom should be flying but yet, its suddenly controlled by shorts and options, when Everyone thats Truly knows Viacom knows its a $85 dollar stock ALL DAY LONG, folks are still LEARY from the Margin Tanker , Either this company is going to sell at this depressed price very soon, or Viacom is going to Bust out when Big Volumes return SUSTAINED, might not be until X-Mas 4th qtr , good things come with time, opinion only g luck folks"
Its not a mystery any longer. The MM's squeezing the option calls and puts to zero while pocketing the premiums. Until something changes more of the same over the last 5 months. Just for comparison AMC traded almost 60 million shares vs Viacom's 7.5 million shares. When the opposite happens I believe Viac will fly high. Until then how long does one wait?
DIS shares jump on a deal with ESPN for sports betting . Just wait until the street figures out how much sports content VIAC has and also gets into sports betting . Especially with our 7 PE compared to DIS 50 PE
I am saddened everytime I look at my position here. This stock was supposed to be at deep discount and do great things. Instead it has done literally nothing and I am forever bag holding.
This stock is ready to run. Dow down 200 and this up over half a buck? Maybe Shari is having conversations.
Brought a couple days ago at 38.79 sold 40 options on it hoping for a close slightly under 40 if that happens I will sell 40 options again next week. If you can't beat them join them!
"Recently bought back for $39 the last 5,000 shares I sold in the March runup (@ $97). My plan is to hold it, this time:-D"
Average daily volume is distorted because of the Archegos blowup. Today's action is fine with me
"If Viacom finish over $40.50 by tomorrow (Quadruple Witching day) , It will begin rally to 75.00 by year end.It has to overcome the option player's manipulation, and once the longs/buyer has upper hands, it will break out.A lot of Wall Street analyst are wrong about the claims that legacy E.T business is obsolete. It is not dead business, instead they eventually evolved to find the new way of make money, and Viacom did it well, and the smart ones begins to notice that Nickelodeon and Pluto is the most important key business, beside of usual plenty of licensing contents business, TV ad, theatrical movies, sports etc..... Also Viacom is cash cow, Viacom do 15 ~ 20% of EBTID /year, 5X more to pay off interest if someone borrow money to buyout Viacom."
This is my least stressful stock.
Any with insight into whether VIAC will regain the movie content it has licensed to other streaming channels so it could have it exclusively on Paramount+?
"I ll buy more tomorrow , the more study this stock the more I like it."
"I've taken the last 6 months as an opportunity to load up on this ticker as it trades sideways. ~20,000 shares strong and will continue up to 55.if you've looked at the Financials, the value is there. buy it before the masses realize and this runs up to the 70'sjust my thoughts"
"$40.52 is closing 9/10/21 stock price necessary to minimize profits for holders of expiring 9/10 calls/puts. Open interest is light at only 54,449 contracts, controlling shares that are only 0.38 times the average daily trading volume. REAL FOCUS needs to be on expiring 9/17 calls/puts where there are 400,648 contracts, controlling shares that are 2.83 times the average daily trading volume. SHOCKINGLY, the 9/17 share price necessary to minimize profits for holders of expiring 9/17 calls/puts is $46.12! And, I checked the data twice. Are we about to see a dramatic price rise? Seems like we are due for some high volatility at the very least. Good luck to all longs!"

"Per story on Barron's (Wed., Sep 15, 2021).Probably behind their paywall, here's an excerpt:Comcast’s CFO Had Bad News About Subscriber Growth. Cable Stocks Are Falling.https://www.barrons.com/articles/comcast-cfo-subscriber-growth-cable-stocks-51631645533?mod=hp_DAY_6“Cable stocks fell deep into the red on Tuesday after Comcast ‘s CFO warned that third-quarter subscriber growth at its Xfinity unit was slower than in the same quarter last year. That shouldn’t have come as a surprise to investors, nor to the market. . . . Still, Comcast is facing a challenge on another front. Cavanagh also said Tuesday that a lack of high-margin international visitors was pressuring profits at NBCUniversal’s theme parks.“Seems like Comcast is aware of the problem.Now what are they going to do to resolve the problem---especially lack of international . . .ViacomCBS would seem to have a solution."

Be patient it won't be long now . VIAC has been exposing it's value with the latest being the BET deal . VIAC CEO exposing value to get a fair buyout offer and help purchaser justify the offer coming soon . That's in a nutshell what the news letter I get says.
"Viac = real value, real profits, real cash flow ..... Something Americans have completely forgotten about.Wall Street is Las Vegas now."

9/6/2021--FYI....Refinitiv/Verus UPGRADES VIAC from Hold to Buy.
"Seeking Alpha 'VIAC is underestimated':""ViacomCBS Inc. (NASDAQ:VIAC) was on a tear early this year - rising from just $36.60 in January to $100 on March 22 - but the Archegos Capital saga crashed the party and sent ViacomCBS stock plummeting. More than 5 months after this collapse of Archegos and the forced liquidation of its portfolio, ViacomCBS stock is still trading range-bound, and has failed to breakthrough. At Leads From Gurus, we added VIAC to our model growth portfolio last April as well, and VIAC has traded sideways ever since while the rest of our holdings have taken off. The obvious question that comes to my mind is, what catalyst could possibly help ViacomCBS stock break free from this price level and move higher? I find the management guidance for subscriber additions very conservative, and I believe an upward revision is on the cards in the coming quarters. This will be the catalyst needed to lift VIAC stock higher from the current price level.Here's why I believe the guidance is too conservativeWall Street adores outperformers, which is not necessarily a bad thing. After all, investors are in this to achieve their long-term financial objectives, so it makes sense to get behind companies that are delivering better-than-expected results in the hopes of securing alpha returns in the long run. As an investor who strongly believes that a strong correlation exists between unexpected earnings and share price movements, I was quite excited to find out that ViacomCBS is well on pace to smash subscriber growth expectations in the coming years.Let's dig a little deeper.The company has guided for 65 million to 75 million global streaming subscribers by 2024, from a base of about 30 million subscribers in 2020. This guidance was issued last February, before the launch of Paramount+ on March 4 in the United States, Canada, and Latin America. When ViacomCBS came up with this guidance, the management had to rely on assumptions for Paramount+ subscriber growth as there was no hard data to work with. In the first half of this year, ViacomCBS added more than 12 million subscribers, with 6.5 million subscribers added in the second quarter to bring the global streaming subscriber base to 42.4 million. This stellar pace of subscriber additions, in my opinion, is an early signal that the management might have been very conservative with its guidance for around 75 million subscribers by 2024. If you think I am getting ahead of reality, let me present you with 2 reasons to support my thesis.First, Paramount+ entered into a partnership with Sky to launch the service on Sky platforms in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Italy, Germany, Switzerland, and Austria in 2022. This is a major breakthrough as Sky is one of the go-to entertainment platforms in Western Europe, which puts Paramount+ in a strong position to thrive in a booming market where OTT streaming is increasing in popularity. I strongly believe that the positive impact on subscriber additions resulting from this partnership is not reflected in the management guidance for 75 million subscribers by 2024.Second, Paramount+ is yet to tap into the massive Asian market, and I believe an expansion is on the cards sooner rather than later. Paramount+ offers an ad-supported subscription tier that costs $4.99, and I believe such a low-cost subscription option with ads will gain traction faster in cost-conscious Asian markets. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is still struggling to gain market share in India, one of its key target markets, primarily because of a cost-conscious consumer base, and I believe the correct strategy to tackle this market is to offer an ad-supported subscription tier. I hope our readers know that Disney+ quickly gained traction in India thanks to its ties to Hotstar, which is the most popular streaming service in India (Hotstar and Disney+ now come as a bundle), and I believe ViacomCBS is in a similar position to replicate what The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) did with Disney+ in India. Viacom18 is one of the fastest-growing entertainment brands in India, and ViacomCBS has a 49% stake in this venture. The network is home to some of the most popular entertainment channels in India, and it also owns Voot Select, an OTT subscription service""."
"Wow, Gasparino just posted on Twitter a 3-day old NY Post article that was clearly biased against VIAC. Gasparino almost seems desperate to keep VIAC down."
"This stock has no legs. AMC trading 26 million shares already and Viacom 1.9 million. Until this stock starts trading again there is no movement to the upside. Just controlled by the MM's taking out the option put and call trader, pocketing their premiums."
Up 3% today!
"Shorts, who need to get out by tomorrow or pay my dividends, are really working the board. Sorry, guys, but this company is as good as bought. That's why they're selling properties. Don't need'em."
"In todays (2021) Las Vegas Stock Exchange ...... people don't care about value, they only run in herds wherever the money is going at any given moment. Because if this was 1985, VIAC with a 7 PE, and this cash flow, would be 2x or 3x from where it is. Just makes no sense what is going on today.....other then the federal reserve has given away so much free money, the average Joe is just throwing it at whatever sounds good on a given day...."
"Yes, ex-dividend is tomorrow and the shorts have to pay the longs."
The longer the base the higher the space
VIAC up 14 cents today... what is that? What in the world is 14 cents when 6 months ago VIAC traded at more than $100???
Why so bad today??
"Also, doesn't look like Viacom took any PPP loans..... didn't need it. However, Disney took a lot .... But here we are, with Disney's multiple PE higher than Viacom ?How is that fair ?Everything is backwards."
Wow that was fun to watch every time it hit 40 they pushed it down would not let it close at 40. Will wait for the next rise early next week and sell 40 calls again next week.
"There's but one way to figure if one should be short. Pros look for a company that is going out of business, so they go short. Ask yourselves, is Viacom going out of business? In fact, who's streaming service - one that owns a huge library - has a better chance for growth? Viacom."
"Not that it needs a genius to ferret out but here are the “Signs of a consolidation”The first is that the stock has definable and steady support and resistance levels, much like a flag continuation pattern.The second characteristic is a narrow trading range. Be careful, though, because not all stocks and securities have similar volatility. Trading ranges are relative.The last feature to look for is a relatively low level of trading volume that does not exhibit major spikes.I think all apply to VIAC here…the question for me is: when will we break out of this pattern?"
You can trust the numbers with viac.No acct irregularities. Clean honest business.
Looks like my 41 covered calls that I sold are safe....low volume...40 going to be the play today...dip towards the close today...That is what I am thinking...
Looks like steady accumulation today.
"Conjecture only ....better volume today, ruffly 10.5 m, been only hitting 6.5-8m recently , so this Bump in Volume over 10m is a good indicator, the avg volume is around 13m , so if we can SUSTAIN a few days of Higher Volume 10-13m plus, then that will indicate Viacom is ready to TIER up to the 42-$45 Range by Friday.....Tomarrow in a sense will Continue to start this Tier up in Viac , if Viacom is up Again Tomarrow and Sustains Higher price and VOLUME, then 42-45 soon,,,,,opinion only g luck"
Invest in a Company with a future. Their streaming attempt will go downin flames. Stock has not done anything in 15 years. Won't do anything the next 15 years.It's a family controlled Company set up to serve the family. Nothing else.
Who will launch the bid for VIAC . Will it be AMZN maybe CHTR . Think bid is very close .
"Oh weird, $40 puts and calls expire worthless. Didnt see that coming."
Please provide a sum of the parts for viacom
No sellers today looks great
"While I suspect a lot of ups and downs... It is starting to feel different where ViacomCBS is in fact in an upward trend line. Looking at the chart you can see some strength.The 50 day moving average has curved upward and if share price maintains above it for a couple weeks, give or take, a new base might be forming in the stock. Just speculation. RSI in the 70s shows there has been aggressive increased buying."
This is a $114 stock if PE was matching its industry PE of 29 times earnings. Maybe we need a couple more quarters of earnings before the market catches on to the growth potential of Paramount Streaming.
"2.35% dividend. 7 PE. $1.1 million dollars gross revenue per employee. $487K gross profit per employee.OPEN .... YOUR......EYES ...... Wall STreet gamblers......who are out there buying 1500 PE, no dividend, no profit, all hyped up dreams. Makes......No......Sense."
"Paw Patrol just surpassed 83 million dollars. Not bad for a cartoon movie. Furthermore, Serie A of Italian soccer is underway, and it is awesome. This will be another major driver of subscribers to Paramount plus along with EPL soccer next year. Add the NFL and College football and basketball to the mix, and VIAC is set to become a gold mine."
"This company has so much great content. Can't believe it trades where it does. I'm holding at least until 100. Anyone watch that CBS show Evil? Its really good.CBS shows: NCIS, SWAT, Survivor, Evil, Seal Team, Big Brother, Late Show with Colbert, NCIS: Los Angeles, Young Sheldon and don't forget the NFL and sports in general. Want to make money? Hold this stock for the next couple of years, IMO. Look up all the content Paramount owns. Crazy."
40.28 20dma needs to stay above or will continue downward.
$39.99. Couldn't script it any better
"So undervalued at this level, literally by every metric. A split of the company, or spin off of Pluto would be fantastic!"
"In today's Las Vegas stock exchange, viac at least makes money without : supply chain problems, worker shortage problems, mask problems, needing a govt bailout problems, climate concern problems, infrastructure bill problems, zombie company problems...etc etc. So why is this cash generator stock not at 80?"
I get worried when insiders are selling. Sheri isn't selling. Why should I?
"The market narrative for VIAC (of Viacom needing more scale or being acquired) can change very quickly, because the market narrative is simply not true. As I mentioned in a previous post, all signs point to VIAC having continued growth in the streaming arena. All that it would take for the market narrative to change would be some period of positive momentum for the stock. At some point, the market view can quickly change to ""D@mn, how did VIAC stock get so inexpensive?"".One other thing that the market will inevitably do is to break the inexplicable bond between VIAC and DISCA. Honestly, DISCA is NOT having the same success as VIAC in the streaming arena -- not even close. I believe the only reason VIAC has not moved in the last month is that VIAC took a huge hit WHEN DISCA REPORTED. VIAC then mostly recovered when it itself reported its impressive Q2 results."
These dips are a gift. Keep averaging down. Patience and discipline will be rewarded. But it may be a real test for most. VIAC is a stock for investors with a multi year outlook.
Looks like updated # $41 to $41.50 after all the recent options play today
Need stock buyback!
"Melvin capital and shorts trying to keep us down. That's why you see some weird negative comments from weird users, as Melvin basically pays swe and coders to build these anonymous bots to create negative sentiment, so us retail investors sell. But WE WILL NEVER SELL. I SWEAR TO STAND HERE UNTIL $VIAC will cost $85 per share. So lets see Shorts if you can keep us down for just so long..."
The most predictable stock in the market.
"It is ""Quadruple Witching"" today (expiration day for stock options, index options, stock futures and index futures), do you know where your stock is? VIAC will likely be impacted with 416,481 open option contracts expiring, controlling stock equal to 2.9 times the daily average trading volume. ""Witch"" VIAC will show up?!? $45.88 is the closing 9/17 stock price to minimize profits for all holders of call and put options, 14% higher than the current price of $40.23!Leading the Bull case are 140,009 expiring put options (controlling 14 million shares) worth a combined $54.6 million at a $40.23 close price. Will sophisticated issuers/sellers of those puts try to push VIAC up to reduce that payday? Or, will exercisers of those puts be BUYING the stock on the open market to cover that sale?Leading the Bear case (i.e. no change to the current price) are 276,472 expiring call options (controlling 27.6 million shares) worth a combined $2.9 million at a $40.23 close price. Arguers of the Bear case, might say put options sellers likely already own the stock, and, therefore, will not be buying stock to enable the sale.I am a long term Bull, so a bit biased perhaps, but from my perspective there are $54.6 million reasons why some large investors may try to push VIAC up to a much higher level for today's close. Not sure what will happen, but at the least I do expect high VIAC volatility today, whether driven by VIAC's expiring options or expiring broad market futures/options (likely the Russell 2000 having the most impact to VIAC, I believe). Good luck to all longs today and in the future!"
VIAC is setting itself up for some big moves. Watch out in a few weeks.

"Bob Bakish’s participation in the Goldman Sachs conference next week.I hope Goldman will take it private with other consortium if they cannot find buyers.I guess many interested Goldman's clients will be there to hear Bakish's sales presentation of how great Viacom is, and I expect big surprise next week, as I see Viacom is pretty strong despite the weak market closeing to Quadruple witching tomorrow."

I wonder if Paramount might reconsider the release of Top Gun II since Disney seems to be very successful?

"Paw Patrol movie just surpassed 94 million dollars. Live sports are in full swing now. NFL, Champions league of soccer, Series A of Italian soccer. Ad revenue will explode this quarter and next one. Pack the truck!!!!"
Patrol just surpassed 92.5 million dollars at the box office WORLDWIDE. This is the bottom line!!!! Not bad for an animated movie as someone pointed out earlier. Not bad at all for a movie with a 26 million dollar budget production!!!! Keep shorting the stock!!!
I am surprised that investment company doesn’t buy the whole business and spin off of the streaming business. And recoup their investment.They would still make a boatload of money with the rest of the company
If this is not called manipulation of a stock . What￼￼ is?￼
This gain today only brings the stock back to $40 +/- 50 cents where it will be until someone comes in and starts buying 30-40 million shares per day. Until then nothing to move this stock forward except for a buyout. We already had two record breaking quarters and the stock did not move up.
As usual sold the calls and puts in addition sold the heck out of the 25 puts longer dated yesterday adding to my position I’m comfortable owning under 25
"Regarding the presumably low volumes, who is wanting to sell this undervalued stock with dividends about to be paid and sale about to be announced?"
I expect to see 15+% rally to $46Way overdue.Way under priced.Low Hanging Fruits.High Probability.
"On Tuesday 9/14 CFO speaks to B of A clients at 11:15.This guy came from Amazon.If his peers at Amazon thought VIAC was a bag of #$%$he would have not taken on this role.I think He may work for Amazon again if he is not too rich after Amazon buys VIAC,"
Buying the stock today (Sep 15) locks in the dividend at a discounted stock price---2 for 1 bargain.
ViacomCBS was trading in the 20s last year. If you told me a $25 stock will consistently trade in the 40s next year plus pay out dividends.... I am buying that stock as fast as I can.
"Champion's League of soccer started today. Guess who has exclusive rights to broadcast it in the US? You got it!!! Not Peacock, not NFLX, not Amazon Prime, not HBO Max. Paramount Plus!!!! VIAC is the future!!!"
"Why is it that you have to dig for news like the sale of the CBS office and proposed sale of Radford?I would have thought Yahoo Finance would have covered it. If it weren't for this message board, I would have never known about it"
LOTS of news on Nickelodeon's Video Game All Star Brawl.The best thing though is the New Video out with an interview with the CEO.You will have to internet search for it as I am not sure why the auto-ocker is blocking me.What makes this game kind of a big deal is:1) It reaches a wider audience than the company's previous video games.2) It opens the door to ESports competition and revenues.
"As some have mentioned below, a good example of how this market is completely irrational can be illustrated by following NFLX. Between 8/12 and today (roughly 1 month) NFLX is up 100 points or about 20%. This means its market cap has swelled $52B in the same time VIAC has done nothing. $52B is twice the market cap as VIAC so the market is saying to NFLX by reporting less than stellar numbers (much lower subscriber growth than VIAC) you are rewarded with the equivalent of 2 whole VIAC companies all in the past month. This of course make no sense whatsoever."
As a takeover stock people will buy this company for at least 70 dollars a share
"Today we break 45$ mark! I work in Citadel and we are heavily investing into VIAC today, expect like 1$ billion shares purchased today by us)"
What do people think of Netflix buying the rights to stream all the Seinfeld episodes? Based on the jump in their share price it seems to be positive. Why would NBC not stream it on their own streaming service?
NFLX hits new all time high.Which streaming service NFLX or VIAC will have the largest % growth in the next 5 years?The answer is VIACThen why is NFLX hitting new highs and VIAC isn’t. Go figure!
Nice comeback at the bell at least.
"I went back to 6/14 the last time we were ex div. The stock went upSince we were expecting this again, the shorts did there thing"
"Just continuing to sit back, tune out all the noise and be patient - off loaded most of my position between the high 50's and mid 80's after buying starting in mid Nov 2019 thru April 2020. Have been buying back in the 37 - 39 range and building back up a significant position - I look at it this way - if it isn't sold at a rich premium from here then I think the way subscriptions have been going and expansion overseas it will do very well on its own."
“How. Hedge Funds Manipulate Stocks” on Utube. Watch it.
"VIAC is selling non core assets, probably in an effort to be acquired at a substantial premium. I'm surprised it's not trading in the $43-$45 range yet."
VIAC should be at $65 a share
Oversold. You will regret not buying this dip.
"VIAC short interest has slowly but steadily declined over the past 7 months, now at 43 million shares. However, since trading volume has also decreased, time to cover (4 days) is the second-longest we've seen since March of this year. Will be interesting to see the latest (9/15/21) short interest data, due to be disseminated the evening of 9/24/21."
"I don't understand the arguments maintaining that Viacom needs scale or M&A. It's all about content and pricing. I have Paramount+, Prime, Sundance, Hulu and Pluto. My total cost is only $15 a month (I don't count prime since I pay for that for the free 2 day shipping). $15 a month is about 1/4 what I spend at Starbucks. It's ridiculously cheap for more content than I can possibly watch in two lifetimes."
Champions League starts today....on Paramount Streaming!
"I posted this yesterday when the price was about $40.20. ""Ex dividend date next Tuesday. Don't forget due to the $0.24 dividend the stock price should drop $2.40""I thought it was gallows humor but it looks like $37.80 will be the low. This stock cannot get a break."
VIAC should use the $5.5 Billion cash to announce major buy back ASAP while hedges are suffocating the stock price.
Its going to be the same game sticking around $40 give our take 50 cents until the volume picks up. We need 40-50 million shares traded per day to start moving this forward. When that happens who knows. Until then the MM's taking your call and put option premiums from you. Buy shares and stay away from options on this stock.
"$40.47 is today's closing 9/10/21 stock price necessary to minimize profits for holders of expiring 9/10 calls/puts (updated this morning). Open interest is 73,845 contracts, controlling shares 0.52 times average daily trading volume. As mentioned before, REAL FOCUS is next week's expiring 9/17 calls/puts with 405,560 contracts outstanding, controlling shares 2.86 times average daily trading volumes. The 9/17 share price necessary to minimize profits for holders of expiring 9/17 calls/puts is $46.08 (updated this morning)! That is 15% higher than where we are now! Pure speculation but I am thinking that and next week's dividend will pull the stock higher. I added to my shares this morning. We will see! Good luck to all longs!"
"Based on the trailer for the new Paranormal Activity film, I think the movie could have done very well in theatres. Let’s see, however, how much Paramount+ benefits from the exclusive release of this movie in the P+ platform."
"It's obviuous the clear intention to bring this down under 40... or who knows, under 39!!!"
"$40.65 is the closing 8/27/21 stock price necessary to minimize profits for holders of expiring 8/27 calls/puts. Open interest is only 73,297 contracts, controlling 7.3 million shares (about 0.52 times average daily volumes), so much lower than last week's 2x average volumes. Perhaps a little price stability this week. Good luck to all longs!"
"Been making $$ each week selling bull put spreads. Could make a lot more selling covered calls, but I dare not. Don’t want to miss the big haul on the horizon when VIAC breaks out to the positive. Good trading to the VIAC faithful here!"
"I've held this stock for years, since it was CBS, still holding it. The price still doesn't make sense."
"Apple will bid very soon.Apple cannot compete with Netflix in streaming, but got hurt their pride, so they need Viacom to compete.We will wake up rich any morning, except shorts."
Takeover candidate at least 90 dollars a share. A lot of big tech loves their content and their market cap is peanuts
"The president who was a school for the credit card companies and who is responsible for the worst military/strategic disaster in American history is now lecturing me about paying my ""fair share"" At 70% tax rate, I would say I'm already paying more than that"
This should be called the hopes and prayers forum..... that's all I can hear in here
"Seriously, just buy at $38, sell at $41.50, rinse and repeat. This company just can't seem to break out."
Again I bet this will stay around $40 plus or minus 50 cents by end of week. No volume to speak of to move this in any upward direction.
"VIAC goes ex-dividend today. In order to get the dividend, you would have needed to own shares before today, including through after hours last night."
"Just like AMC in a sense: I bought at 3 bucks, 4, 5's 6's. Was getting my ### handed to me in the 7's, was putting up with all the CNBC'ers , the JC'ers of the world who were LOL. Well, who got the last laugh? Me! And that was 6 months before anyone ever heard of a meme stock. So many day traders will look back on Viacom, probably soon, and think they had a piece but didn't hold on. Here we go again..."
"If NFLX can be worth 600 plus a share with no sports, no ad revenue, no theatrical movie’s revenue, no PLUTO TV, no dividend, and average content at best, VIAC is worth 150 a share at least. VIAC is set to take over soccer EPL rights next year from NBC. This is huge!!!!! Soccer is the most watched sport on the planet!!!! Add this to MLS, CONCACAF, Italian, Champions League and Europa League soccer, golf, NFL, College football and basketball, and other sports in Australia (Rugby), India (soccer, cricket), and other countries. This is a gold mine!!!! To top it off, VIAC is set to have a huge windfall of cash in the next 12 to 24 months. S & H Publisher, Hollywood studio, and Blackrock building in New York are all set for sale. As I correctly predicted, PLUTO TV is already at a rate of 1 billion a year in revenue, and it will even go higher from here. Sky is the limit, ladies and gentlemen!"
"Maybe if VIAC changed their name to ViacomNEWSOM, enough rich California Silicon Valley/Hollywood elites will buy and bid the stock up into the $60s."
SEC needs to bring back the uptick rule for shorting
"Let's compare recent streaming results... Netflix vs. ViacomCBSAnd as a reminder: -Netflix Market Cap: $252B | Total subs: 209M | Price / Sub = $1,206 -ViacomCBS: $27B | Total Subs: 42M | Price / Sub | Price / Sub = $642 (1/2 the valuation) (both companies have about $20B in debt) Note: VIAC does not include 52M PlutoTV subs plus the entire broadcast business and movie studio. Get those for ""free"" if valuation is strictly based on streaming subscribers. Netflix only added 1.5M subs last quarter and VIAC added 6.5M. VAIC is so ridiculously undervalued.... ---------------Clips from Forbes, Aug 24th Netflix: Despite a sluggish second quarter, Netflix remains the category leader in the streaming wars. In the second quarter 2021, Netflix added 1.5 million net new subscribers globally (compared to ten million in second quarter 2020). In the U.S./Canada market, subscriber counts had fallen by 430,000 totaling 73 million subscribers.Netflix first expanded globally in 2010 when it entered the Canadian market, the following year Netflix was launched in Latin America and the Caribbean. Netflix is now available in 190+ markets worldwide with 209 million paying subscribers, a year-over-year increase of 8%.ViacomCBS: In second quarter 2021 ViacomCBS announced the addition of 6.5 net new streaming subscribers, giving them a total of 42 million globally. Although most of the increase came from Paramount+, subscriber counts also include Showtime, Noggin and BET+. ViacomCBS also said the ad supported streamer PlutoTV now has 52 million active global users, up from 50 million in the first quarter. On the strength of Paramount+, ViacomCBS has set a goal of 65 million to 75 million global streaming subscribers by 2024. Paramount+ is available in Scandinavia, Latin America and most recently Australia. The SkyShowtime agreement will make Paramount+ available in 22 western Europe markets and replace their presence in Scandinavia. PlutoTV is already available in a number of western European markets."
"FYI… triple witching, this could be the catalyst, Shortys options, gonna get interesting, opinion only g luck"
ViacCBS Short Interest is dropping. Fell from about 7.7% mid August to about 7.38% of float by August 31st. Dropping short interest is a bullish sign.
Who bought at $60?
A green day for Viacom is a good day even if its 30 cents.
Breakout way overdue!
I thought VIAC would get some positive bounce from the business reorg announcement. Does not seem like VIAC can do anything to generate a positive price move. Strange. But management continues to add value which will eventually be realized.
Another week where the stock price settles at $40 +/- 50 cents to take out the put and call options and pocket the premiums. Until we have real volume I can see this going on and on.
I review VIAC as NFLX 5 years ago already with studios. We all know what NFLX has done!
"Can anyone share any news (positive/negative) on investors day presentation at B o A?I hope no more bad news to cause another sell off set up for tomorrow. I heard that Comcast fall 5% on CFO's bearish comment about slowing subscription addition.Viacom sell off is related to the it, as the every news is bad news for Viacom for no reason."
"Stock down like the rest of market, but some huge buy blocks hitting my screen, last one 400,000 green seconds ago."
I believe this will be the start of VIAC's move to the $50+ range by EOY.
Pickup in volumeNot sure if this is good or bad?
Shari Redstone went to a great deal of trouble to unify Viacom and CBC a few years ago. It is quite interesting that she is splitting their management now.
"I wonder if Bob Bakish will show up at the Communacopia Conference wearing a Comcast T-Shirt, while Sheri Redstone tries to sign attendees up to Xfinity."
"The discrepancy in valuation between VIAC and ROKU is impressive. In 2021, VIAC’s streaming revenues by themselves will be around $4B (about 15% of total VIAC revenues). ROKU will be lucky to have $3B in revenues total. VIAC streaming growth will likely match or exceed that of ROKU’s. Yet ROKU’s valuation is significantly higher than that of VIAC AS A WHOLE , not just the streaming portion."
Need new high!
"Hmmm, shorts seem to be struggling to keep VIAC down. Tide is turning, if it hasn't already.It hasn't gapped up, but is rising."
"“Some of the greatest stock market successes deliver large quarterly sales increases consistently for several years.""This quote, from Mark Minervini, would apply perfectly to Pluto TV and, as well, to VIAC streaming in general."
Gary in regards to prices settling around 40 every Friday I posted that I had made a purchase yesterday near the lows and sold covered calls @40 today to take advantage of what you stated. It went up on the board and was removed. I did not know they censored something like that.
"The current market narrative is that VIAC needs more scale or that it needs to be acquired. However, in terms of growth in the streaming arena, VIAC is doing great on its own. Just look at the growth numbers (for P+ and Showtime). They’re growing faster than Disney+ and Netflix. This doesn’t even cover Pluto TV’s dominance in AVOD."
50 dollars ashare
"A real company that makes real money.PE of 7. Cash flow. Great content. No supply chain problems. No labor shortage problems. But, corrupt Wall Street cronies and federal reserve corrupts have made value a losing proposition.Sad.I still like it though, and the product."
"If NFLX shares can be worth 606 dollars, VIAC could easily be worth 150. Unbelievable!!!!!"
I don't see how you can be an exec at comcast and not see the obvious. Cable subscribers are going down while streaming takes your cake. Why not buy the cheapest service on the market to remain competitive? The only valid reason this shouldn't happen is if they flat out can't afford it.
Champion's League of soccer began today. Guess who has exclusive rights to broadcast it in the US? You got it!!! VIAC is the future!!!
"Luckily, I sold at 41.50 during the pop. Now patiently waiting to load my boat at 38."
BET Studios sounds awesome! Nothing but positive business moves and exciting results will come from it all. This is why you can buy VIAC and hold for forever.
"Noticed 2 Block trades buying, positive accumulation.big hands bought loaded 2 millions of shares between 10:45 to 11:00 AM.2 million less to play for shorts"
"Look at the call option activity at 42.00. Does anyone see how, based on the last 5 months pattern, this has any chance of punching through and closing above 42.00 come Friday at 4 PM?"
Even at $60 VIAC would be way undervalued!
Wells Fargo raise to 60$ from 45$..here we go..
Above 42.5 and this thing flies much higher IMO
I think ViacomCBS will be bought for at least 100 dollars a share. The re are a lot of suitors that would love to get their hands on this content.
"MichalThere was a story this morning regarding a purchase of 8,000 calls the day before Goldman announced their acquisition of Greensky. Normal option volume on Greensky is about 125 contracts. $40,000 turned into $2 million. The SEC missed Bernie Madoff. They are in bed with Wall St. and worthless when it comes to the little guy, i.e. you're not a billionaire"
44$ next week at most
not convincing today even though up.half average volume and still below 20dma of 40 28
"As you can see, last week they tried desperately to shake you out of your dividend position. Not only did I wait it out, I bought a few and lowered my mark. Then back up and I get to collect a nice lump of dividend money. In times like these= dividends!"
A forward PE of 7 and price to sales ratio under 1
"The company nets $237k EBITDA per employee. Show me another company doing that, and please report back.Wall Street had gone from investing to pure gambling."
Selling CBS Radford Studios in Studio City. Selling New York City Headquarters. Why? Because Viacom doesn't need them anymore. Along w/delaying the Cruise movies (Bait)=I believe deal's already been made.
"FYI.......BUY Ticker ( VIAC )............................NOT Viaca!!Why pay Extra $5 Dollars a share for Viaca, when you get a $5 dollar DISCOUNT with VIAC...Only difference is voting rights , which you will never need!!EXAMPLE......BUY 20,000 shares of Viaca @ 45= $900,000vsBUY 20,000 shares of VIAC@ 40 = $800,000Save $100.000 owning TICKER>>>VIAC , unless you think you need voting powers , BUY VIAC!!Opinion only g luck folks"
"Just sharing this information, (I'm rounding the numbers). The VIAC CFO was granted 68K RSU's (restricted stock units) in August as part of the stock option plan for senior executives. This is an annual reward of the shares that are vested 4 years from now. Here's the interesting part......many times when this is done the executive sells an appropriate number of shares to cover the taxes on receiving the shares at a cost of $0. In this case the CFO did NOT sell his RSU's to cover the taxes but instead had 24K shares ""withheld"" by VIAC to cover the future tax liability. If the stock is going to be much higher in the future you don't want to sell them today just to cover your taxes on the gain.......that is why they are withheld NOT sold . I think this speaks volumes as it is not the normal procedure of executives in other companies I follow that receive stock options (RSU's). Take the message."
"Not saying that there is a buyout coming BUT the BOD for CMCSK are not going to just sit still and accept slower ad spending or slower subscription growth and just say ""oh well that's how it goes"". They are going to do ""something""."
ViacomCBS splitting its Paramount movie and television businesses watch for gap up this week
Here we go again!!!
Clearly the open secret: Viacom grooming CBS for sale. The most obvious speculation attached thereafter would have Comcast first in line to buy Viacom.
"As they say on other message boards, without any DD or documentation to back it up....VIAC to the moon!!!"
ex dividend of $.24 equates to $.75 - $1.00 loss in the share price today. Leveraged is 4x.
' Mayor of Kingstown ' coming. Previews look great.
"Should I buy September 17th, 2021, $150 Call Option for .01?"
5 months of bouncing between $38 and $42. How exciting.
