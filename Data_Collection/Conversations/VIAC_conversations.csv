Someone put a big put option order for 2023 thinking that this stock would fall between $20 and $35. Or this option could be hedging against a huge long share position.
merger monday.anyone hear anything ?
Who said the following - earlier in August:ViacomCBS Inc. (VIAC): 2Q21 Review: Raising revenue estimates on improved streaming momentum; Maintain Buy and $75 PT
Closing green today
DIS shares jump on a deal with ESPN for sports betting . Just wait until the street figures out how much sports content VIAC has and also gets into sports betting . Especially with our 7 PE compared to DIS 50 PE
I am saddened everytime I look at my position here. This stock was supposed to be at deep discount and do great things. Instead it has done literally nothing and I am forever bag holding.
"Netflix is up $50~to $60 in 1 week for no reason.They may bloating itself to issue stock offer of $50 billions, and get away with free Viacom with no blood on their hand. We will see it soon. May be apple is doing the same thing, they are up record high on grim future of one ""phoney"" trick."
"I see desperate manipulation. Out of 4 millions traded in first 1 hour about, 2 million was dumped to attempted to trigger the stop loss weak hands. Some bigger thing is happening, the short are making chance to cover before the buyout.Just my positive prediction."
"I've taken the last 6 months as an opportunity to load up on this ticker as it trades sideways. ~20,000 shares strong and will continue up to 55.if you've looked at the Financials, the value is there. buy it before the masses realize and this runs up to the 70'sjust my thoughts"
Takeover or acquired…. Regardless of what it is I still think the dollar tree is interested in buying them out. I’ve heard many conversations and rumors in the Hollywood elite and Silicon Valley that dollar tree is looking to buy them out.
"The current market narrative is that VIAC needs more scale or that it needs to be acquired. However, in terms of growth in the streaming arena, VIAC is doing great on its own. Just look at the growth numbers (for P+ and Showtime). They’re growing faster than Disney+ and Netflix. This doesn’t even cover Pluto TV’s dominance in AVOD."
The only rational explanation of why VIAC share price does not move up is DEBT. Market Cap. is not much higher than their debt pile of 18 Billion .
I review VIAC as NFLX 5 years ago already with studios. We all know what NFLX has done!
"Viacom : honest numbers and acct system. Good product. PE of 7. Pays a dividend. But in this day and age, it's ALL about chasing the next scam.Viacom is honest."

"ATTENTION ATTENTION ATTENTIONS. Redstone has said that she is going to ""wait until next year"" to explore her options.I beleive her.Until then VIAC management is going to clean up the balance sheet and move forward with streaming.VIAC management has every incentive to make VIAC as appealing as possible to any potential acquirer, but also realize VIA may have to go it alone.This can / should result in the stock price firming and probably rising.But the merger and ""really big gains"" are next year."
"Recently bought back for $39 the last 5,000 shares I sold in the March runup (@ $97). My plan is to hold it, this time:-D"
"Anyone selling or shorting VIAC at this level needs to have their head examined. They're in the process of shedding core assets to pay down debt and arrange a sale, and they pay a great dividend next month. Even if VIAC is not acquired, analysts agree the stock is worth over $52."
"FYI.......BUY Ticker ( VIAC )............................NOT Viaca!!Why pay Extra $5 Dollars a share for Viaca, when you get a $5 dollar DISCOUNT with VIAC...Only difference is voting rights , which you will never need!!EXAMPLE......BUY 20,000 shares of Viaca @ 45= $900,000vsBUY 20,000 shares of VIAC@ 40 = $800,000Save $100.000 owning TICKER>>>VIAC , unless you think you need voting powers , BUY VIAC!!Opinion only g luck folks"
"$40.65 is the closing 8/27/21 stock price necessary to minimize profits for holders of expiring 8/27 calls/puts. Open interest is only 73,297 contracts, controlling 7.3 million shares (about 0.52 times average daily volumes), so much lower than last week's 2x average volumes. Perhaps a little price stability this week. Good luck to all longs!"
"Jake Paul vs Tyrone Woodley ends in split decision. So, rematch possible which is best scenario for Showtime."
ViacomCBS was trading in the 20s last year. If you told me a $25 stock will consistently trade in the 40s next year plus pay out dividends.... I am buying that stock as fast as I can.
"Method Shortists (Melvin Capital) use to keep the stock down!: source: https://www.griproom.com/fun/10-signs-your-stock-is-being-manipulated9. High short volume, low short interest.These numbers must be reported accurately to financial regulators. They can’t hide the overall short interest in the long run. But what they can do is cover their short before the short interest is reported.This becomes obvious when short volume is high, say 45%, but total short interest is low, say 3%. If 45% of a stock’s volume is people borrowing and selling, then you’d expect the total short interest to be huge.But it’s not. They hide it by covering their short position before the day is over.So, if you notice a large amount of volume before the end of the day, or right at the bell…some of that volume is the shorts covering their position so they don’t increase the overall short interest and draw the attention of investors/short squeezers."
x-div in only 15 days!
"VIAC issued more stock earlier this year at $85. That was actually a very smart financial move. However, I have come to believe that the institutional investors who were convinced to buy at that price by the I Banks are going to punish the stock for selling at that price. We need a corporate event to get the stock back where it deserves to be."
Apple vs Bezos

"VIAC is selling non core assets, probably in an effort to be acquired at a substantial premium. I'm surprised it's not trading in the $43-$45 range yet."
The short interest in VIAC has pretty much stayed the same for the last three months. In my opinion this means most traders do not expect this stock to drop much and it should be a good growth stock from here.
The longer the base the higher the space
The most predictable stock in the market.
I get worried when insiders are selling. Sheri isn't selling. Why should I?
PE of 7. Gross revenue of 1.1 million per employee. Now that's a company that makes money. Meanwhile Wall Streeters chasing the next fad.
"It’s worthwhile to reiterate that volume is still low enough to allow hedge fund manipulation. Clearly that’s what’s going on. You would do well to rewatch, or watch if you haven’t yet seen, Jim Cramer‘s Utube video “how hedge funds manipulate stock prices.” It’s from an interview he did many years ago when he was a hedge fund manager, before he became a big financial TV star. It will definitely open your eyes. More and more people are recognizing the value here, and at some point share purchases will overwhelm the ability of the hedge funds to short this equity, and the share price will rocket northward."
VIAC should be at $65 a share
"Well folks........why not just take out the $40 dollar calls and puts along with the 42's.....right?Just place your bet......buy the stock, collect your dividends on VIAC....and walk away.......just forget about it........then sometime during the next 12 months you will wake up one morning with a nice profit.....and you will not likely see it coming even the day before........until then.......over and out my friends......"
No reason to watch this today we know the outcome
VIAC should use the $5.5 Billion cash to announce major buy back ASAP while hedges are suffocating the stock price.
"2.35% dividend. 7 PE. $1.1 million dollars gross revenue per employee. $487K gross profit per employee.OPEN .... YOUR......EYES ...... Wall STreet gamblers......who are out there buying 1500 PE, no dividend, no profit, all hyped up dreams. Makes......No......Sense."
"Just sharing this information, (I'm rounding the numbers). The VIAC CFO was granted 68K RSU's (restricted stock units) in August as part of the stock option plan for senior executives. This is an annual reward of the shares that are vested 4 years from now. Here's the interesting part......many times when this is done the executive sells an appropriate number of shares to cover the taxes on receiving the shares at a cost of $0. In this case the CFO did NOT sell his RSU's to cover the taxes but instead had 24K shares ""withheld"" by VIAC to cover the future tax liability. If the stock is going to be much higher in the future you don't want to sell them today just to cover your taxes on the gain.......that is why they are withheld NOT sold . I think this speaks volumes as it is not the normal procedure of executives in other companies I follow that receive stock options (RSU's). Take the message."
