This stock is obviously going through a rough time but don't forget just 6 months ago there was a common stock offering at $85 and a secondary offering at $100 and investors were willing to pay that. At the time the stock hit 100 some analysts were even increasing their price targets. I have no doubt this stock will get back to its glory days and higher.
"Shocker, down move on Friday. Tax selling. Higher low on ANEMIC volume. Entire sector is down. Hardly reason for concern. The fundamental story remains in tact. In fact, its strengthened by the poor quarters of AMZN and AAPL."
Lol at all these alarmists. The narrative hasn't changed at all this week. I will load up at close and look for pop on Monday.
"From Allen yesterday: ""I’m convinced that you will not be able to buy VIAC again for below $36/share in the foreseeable future, and I believe the window to buy it below $37/share is closing.""Allen, would you like to update your conviction?"
Very low volume today. Wanted to share Louis Navallier's Portfolio Grader for VIAC:Operating Margin AEarnings Growth B Cash Flow BQuantitative Grade BThese are good grades for the upcoming earnings report.It appears WE ARE NOT SELLING SHARES TO THE SHORTS that is why volume is so low!Hang tight until the earnings report and squeeze the shorts we are in control right now!!
"It is time for someone to buy VIAC? AAPL, Netflix, Comcast & Disney could all use the content and live sports. This would be a pocket change acquisition for Apple and boost their membership. Apple has the most to gain as their content is good, but severely lacking!"
I don't know why today feels like such a victory when just a few weeks ago we were trading close to 40. Maybe because we were shown today that this stock is actually capable of going up.
Feeding Time !!!$36.3
VIAC taking majority ownership of Fox Mexico and Fox Columbia what a great move! This stock should get back to 39 by earnings and if Wall Street likes the report it will blat past 40 and beyond. Finally something to be very happy about for us shareholders!!
"I’m convinced that you will not be able to buy VIAC again for below $36/share in the foreseeable future, and I believe the window to buy it below $37/share is closing."
Read article this morning that said Viac close to a deal for its 34 Acre studio lot in LA. And use the proceeds to expand its content.
VIAC needs to start a crypto currency and call it VIACOIN. The stock price will rocket up and then we can all sell it.
"So earnings. Analyst expectation is for higher revenue and a decline in earnings (because they are investing in the transition to streaming). With Comcast and Ad Agency blowout earnings in last few days, my expectation is now for significantly higher revenue and an upside surprise on earnings, probably still a decline but much smaller than expected. Ad revenue is forecast to go up next year too so this will be a catalyst to realize that VIAC is a still a huge player with deep resources and is going nowhere. Once analysts wake up to the huge growth potential from their existing massive content library that streaming unlocks in terms of access to global markets, this stock is going to fly."
"On Yahoo Finance today: Stocks sold for tax reasons often surge at year-end: Bank of America“On a monthly basis, this strategy [of buying a basket of these struggling stocks] tends to have the highest median returns in November and January, perhaps benefitting from the rebound after the Oct. 31 deadline for tax loss selling for mutual funds and then the rebound after the Dec. 31 deadline for regular tax filers,” analysts wrote.Obviously, VIAC has big losses for Institutions that bought during the Archeos debacle. And they no doubt have big gains elsewhere to offset since the market has been on a tear. Two more trading days and the Institutions will stop selling."
