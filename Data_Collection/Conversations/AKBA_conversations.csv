no news and up 9%? just announce a buyout
i have a old dream ... see one day $42 in PM
I just watched the Morgan Stanley presentation and I thought Butler did a decent job. Anyone else watch and what did you think?
Until we have some inside buying we are not going anywhere. They need to show trust for the company.
mrna up another $40..akba up 1 cent
"Almost a third of Americans remain unvaccinated for covid. Average cost for covid hospitalization is $20,000. Vadadustat’s effect on covid-related hospitalizations will be released within the next few months, before January."
3.55 M BUY AT 11.20 am
Took a chance and added. AKBA hit a 26 week low this morning.
Ardelyx’ Tenepor also tripped up by the FDA. One less hyperphosphatemia competitor for Auryxia.
so since we are or will be first in class at least we deserve to be one billion company
When will Akba hit 12 dolllllar?
Finally confused investors realized Roxy is different study and different drug. We have a positive path forward and Roxy is at least two years behind for approval. Dutch
"The probability of the drug being approved by FDA is so high that buying AKBA under $3 is like buying an option without expiration date. It is likely $20 or more when the drug is approved on March 29, 2022"
Okay 3pm Five million shares. Who is trading and why always down. Algorithms possibly? Dutch
Well to close the week with a + note :begin 2021 about 16% shorts 8 months later 8% shorts :-)
August is coming to an end~ It is heading towards US$2.00 per share!
" With all of its failures and drawbacks, FGEN market cap is still $1.3B … however, AKBA is just $460M "

Daily end of day drop coming??? No doubt
Nothing changes here. It is wait is a tird stock.
"Short position on AKBA dropped by 1,721,980 to 13,975,782 0n 7/30/2021. Getting close to my add-on point."
One year ago tomorrow is the day Akba fell 9 points or 80 percent on adverse NDD CKD MACE numbers and news.A day that lives in infamy for Akba shareholders.Can they go up 1/2 that amount tomorrow as part of seeking out fair value as of today? Call the Reddit crowd.
"Am in to this fraud at 11.33/sh. Taking in to account the time, came in by way of kerx, and missed opportunity value it'd have to break $50 to even be considered a small success. oh boy!"
Morgan Stanley cuts price target to $2.76 from $3. That’s 15 yards for unnecessary roughness.
Probably the most serious affront to common owners remains the revenue sharing partnerships that Akebia struck which significantly minimizes any market penetration which ultimately appears.
 FGEN Advisory Committee decision is day after tomorrow . AKBA will react accordingly. A make or break FGEN. My guess is it will be a 99% negative voting.
"Say, ""HELLO"" to my little friend: Abebia w/ Vadadustat both FDA approvals 3/22 = $18, imo"
"~ Excellent Call AKBA ,,,Game Changing Events ,,, TY For Your Tenacity & Vision & Luck ,,, LONG & STRONG ~O~"
"This time next year we will be 4 months into ramping up sales of vadadustat in the $2 billion dialysis market without competition from another HIF-PHI. It is highly unlikely that vadadustat will be rejected by FDA for the dialysis population. If there’s positive data from the phase 2 clinical trial of vadadustat in ARDS, this is a blockbuster drug that will sell like Viagra did in the 1990’s. Selling for ridiculously low prices now. Load up!"
Twelve and a half million shares really. Everyone traded their shares twice. Games!!!!
"CNN has a median PPS for AKEBIA of $6 within 12 months with 7 analysts with a high projection of $10. ""yeah baby!!"""
mrna $15 last year $450 today.. and akba?
Congratulations to all investors ~ AKBA starts at US$4.2 per share within 1 month.It fell to $2.38 per share. The key various technical line trends are going down.Low point? A record low!
"This will probably bounce off $2.00 once the shorters get it down to that level.Their aim will be to flush out most of retail before the slow rise beginning this fall. Then expect a potential tax-selling selloff in December, before the big appreciation begins early next year in anticipation of the March 29th PDUFA date.What can happen between now and then?"
Anyone know if there is a thing called‘broken record syndrome’???
"Make me believe.What positive things can happen between now and March 29th, 2022?"
"Great summer deal for Butler; No work, million bucks+ per year, vacationing on MV....... how do guys like this manage to scam hedge fund kings?????"

Don’t give your cheap shares away to those shorts. This stock never dips under 3 for long. Those shares would be grabbed so fast and the stock would rebound above 3 next week and it won’t dip again. Strong buy!!!
will it hit $3 today...haven't seen that in quite a awhile
"on FiercePharma today (interview with Butler)In the race for novel oral drugs to treat anemia of chronic kidney disease, AstraZeneca and FibroGen’s roxadustat held the front-runner position for quite some time. But as that program has now stumbled, rival Akebia Therapeutics sees a first-in-class opportunity for its underdog vadadustat. etc, etc."
"I love that the FDA will not give it's nod to a drug that hit all of the clinical endpoints initially agreed upon by the FDA. You gotta come with cash, and a lot of it!"

"Cleared 50D SMA on meh volume today ... would love to see some real volume come into AKBA in tomorrow's session .... looks like it will pop right into that $3.25-$3.50 range, completing a W bottom. Definitely trending in the right direction here... GL Longs!"

No reaction with AKBA even though the FGEN is halted. We have our own product which will be approved when time comes
Big deal haven't recovered from the 3 dollar range

"Don't bother me at all, because I'm just waiting. Admission is $0.8 per share.And buy a lot!"

"AKBA ""CAMBRIDGE, Mass. and TOKYO, June 1, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Akebia Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: AKBA), a biopharmaceutical company with the purpose of bettering the lives of people impacted by kidney disease, and its collaborator, Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Otsuka), today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accepted for filing the New Drug Application (NDA) for vadadustat for the treatment of anemia due to chronic kidney disease (CKD) in both adult patients on dialysis and adult patients not on dialysis.The FDA has assigned the application standard review and a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date of March 29, 2022. The FDA also indicated that they are not currently planning to hold an Advisory Committee meeting to discuss the application.""The acceptance of our vadadustat NDA filing marks another important milestone for Akebia and Otsuka, as we work to bring a new oral treatment option to patients living with anemia due to CKD,"" said John P. Butler, Chief Executive Officer of Akebia. ""We remain confident in the clarity and quality of our data, and we look forward to working with the FDA during their review of our application. In addition, we continue to collaborate with our partners to ensure we are well positioned to support a successful commercial launch of vadadustat, upon FDA approval.""Kabir Nath, board member of Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. and president and CEO of its North American pharmaceutical business noted, ""With Akebia, we are proud to have achieved this milestone in the development of vadadustat. This achievement highlights the teams' ongoing execution as well as our shared commitment to advancing vadadustat with the goal of bringing this novel therapeutic to patients as soon as possible, subject to regulatory approval.""Akebia and Otsuka are collaborating on the development and commercialization of vadadustat in the U.S., Europe, China, Russia, Canada, Australia, the Middle East, and certain other territories.In addition, Otsuka is working with Akebia to prepare a Marketing Authorization Application for vadadustat for submission to the European Medicines Agency expected this year.About VadadustatVadadustat is an oral hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase (HIF-PH) inhibitor designed to mimic the physiologic effect of altitude on oxygen availability. At higher altitudes, the body responds to lower oxygen availability with stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor, which can lead to increased red blood cell production and improved oxygen delivery to tissues. Vadadustat recently completed its global Phase 3 clinical development program for the treatment of anemia due to CKD. Vadadustat is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or any regulatory authority with the exception of Japan's Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW). In Japan, vadadustat is approved and marketed under the tradename Vafseo, as a treatment for anemia due to CKD in both dialysis-dependent and non-dialysis dependent adult patients. ....)https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/akebia-and-otsuka-announce-fda-acceptance-for-filing-of-new-drug-application-for-vadadustat-for-the-treatment-of-anemia-due-to-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adult-patients-on-dialysis-and-not-on-dialysis-301302511.html"

INSANE to mandate a drug that effects everyone differently. A drug for a disease that doesnt effect everyone the same. INSANE to mandate a V to someone who has natural anti bodies that are 13 TIMES more effective. FOLLOW THE SCIENCE? More like HEIL BIDIEN!
another day another disappointment. Will this ever get to $4?
They had some interesting insights about AKBA on (http://Rightpicker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"when there is up, there will be down. ppl! don let others manipulate your emotions and sell your stocks taking losses and drive the price down. Not worth it."
Finally saw the AKBA continue to smash!Trust me~ you will see $2.00 per share soon.Don't believe in bad companies! Selling your AKBA is the wisest choice!
Volume more than doubled today why? Hedges run up volume to computer trade PPS down. Seen this happen always early when stock is up high volume and prices drop. They're good give them that. Won't last forever. Dutch
" No doubt, some hedge fund is dumping AKBA since one week. Once they are done, stock will recover. Hope they finish liquidating their position today."
Akebia Therapeutics is up 8.24% to 2.83
Shorts have played here in 3.50 to 2.50 market. Likely made pretty decent gains in manipulating the process. Eventually when FDA approval gets close real money to be made in 30 to 40 range. Bet the thief shows up for that. A matter of time and summer trade most big players on beach. Dutch
bntx up $76 today
"Yeah, magic approval maybe next year...but this company is just terrible..."
"3mm shares or about $10MM traded at 11:16AM, things that make you go hmmmmm."
may have to go to optomologist to get eyes checked...see green..hope i don't have serious vision problem
"300 patients enrolled (in a 400 patient study) in the vadadustat to treat covid-related lung disease. Because of the recent spike in covid infections and hospitalizations in Texas, I would not be surprised if they reach full enrollment within the next 3 months. And would have the preliminary data immediately after that since the study looks at a 14 day course of the medication."
"The midpoint of the ""W"" bottom formation that AKBA is in right now is $2.87, and we are getting very close to that. If we can close above that level with a little bit of a volume push, looks like we could move quickly up to the $3.25 - $3.50 area. It being a summer Friday, maybe we need to wait until Monday for this to happen ... but good positive action over the last couple of weeks."
"Whew! I was just thinking akba had gone to long between inducement grants. Uuh, what exactly are the EE's being induced to do? This added to yesterday's huge news where Buthair released September's conference schedule - surely nothing can stop us now. Oh, don't call me Shirley."
you buy about 95% any other stocks and make money..except this
"This dip under 3 won’t last long, hope it’s at 2,51 still Monday premarket! PT 20 next year. Nice investment. Drug been selling in Japan for a while now."

"Can some people here write the IR Dept. and ask for a response on FGEN.I have asked multiple times for a Press Release on FGEN and also one on the VA contract.Last Friday I received a response from them that looks and reads like a press release.I told them this looked nice and said they should send it out along with a PR on the VA contract.That was last Friday, my response yesterday morning was they are working on the Q report and apparantly they have no plan on releasing on there web site.See is some others can get the same response and please respond back thanking them and encouraging them to send it out publicly, because I just dont understand why the are not do it.Rich S.the other Rich"
Oh if we could trend we could go so much higher.
"Not sure why AKBA dropped in sympathy with FGEN. If you watched FGEN's FDA Adcom meeting and read the paper on New England Journal of Medicine which presented the Phase 3 clinical trial data for AKBA's drug, you will know that AKBA's drug has the same efficacy but without FGEN drug's problem with serious side effects. FDA sponsor explicitly stated that efficacy was without any doubt and their concern was with the side effects. FDA was unsure if the drug should be approved and thus would like to get the opinions from Adcom members.Although AKBA's drug is likely to be first-in-class, but we cannot rule out the possibility that FGEN's drug will also be approved although the probability is low."
"Explain one thing that could move this share price. With in this year, a speculative trial is all we have to look forward to. Auxria has done nothing in years"
Few more days till earnings report. I dont expect it to mean much. We already know the company is good on cash till approval. We already know the date for the FDA. Till then I'm hoping for a few larger than life whales to rock this boat with their buying.
AKBA up 2.5100+0.1600 (+6.8085%) Inside buying soon
The other thing is that the non dialysis market is where the big opportunity resides. Unfortunately for AKBA they have safety issues there. It’s not clear they would gain much market share with dialysis patients as the benefits of an oral dosage are not too clear there. More patients are doing g home dialysis but it’s still a sliver of the market. All this adds up to $2 and falling
Everyone needs to remember when dialysis patients were monitored we have extremely good MACE numbers for Vad study. Roxy study something is a miss. Don't know when we get news but clearly influence our PPS. Dutch
Is this really 10M shares today? Or 1M going back and forth? Fish and Anonymous…I already know your answers.
Hit 2.75. This is a valuable item on huge discounts. Day comes and sale ends forever. Been here done it before. Dutch
"Some asked the difference between FGEN drug and AKBA.........Here’s the biggest difference an investor should care about :The FDA has assigned the application standard review and a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date of March 29, 2022. The FDA also indicated that they are not currently planning to hold an Advisory Committee meeting to discuss the application."
More inducements ! Aargh!
Still not one insider buying one single share. Explain that.
The last trade in after-hours on FGEN was 15.50 from 24.84. Options for AKBA calling for 3.60 tomorrow.
"AKBA: INTELLIGENCE - NOT SWIL - FROM THE SWAMP The evidence indicates this tiny company selling for 2.50 or so has bested or at least equalled a blockbuster that Amgen also produces - and Japanese regulators, who are quite cautious, have approved it, and its in use with excellent results. The Swamp is deep and dark but we critters will pop up into the aftermarket for more AKBA till 8 tonight.. Efficacy and safety of vadadustat {AKEBIA} compared with darbepoetin alfa {AMGEN} in Japanese anemic patients on hemodialysis: A Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind study https://academic.oup.com/ndt/advance-article/doi/10.1093/ndt/gfab055/6154307"
"This firm with close to 400 employee with worst management have not accomplished any thing .I was wonder do they read our comment , May be these word is more effective in four leggedanimal than them"

let me guess...red...oh what a surprise...
Wow! What's wrong! AKBA rose by +0.78% today.Remember a month and a half ago ~ AKBA is 4.2$ per share.Now ~ 2.4$-2.5$ per share?
Like shooting fish in a barrel. Lol. Couldn’t resist!!!
3.3 million shares at $2.62; someone wanted in and someone wanted out......
"I'm not sure how quick yahoo is on institutional holdings, but we gained 2 this week. Potentially 1 yesterday on a down day. I'm not real savvy on diligence finding this out, but seems like a positive"
Very low volume?
hopefully not a false start. then again the investment world is going to hear from Butler 3mat 3 conferences. That alone should put the kibosh on any rally.
"6 months ago this stock was $5. Since then:1. There’s been a publication in the NEJM introducing the vadadustat to the world as an effective, safe and more convenient alternative to ESAs. 2. The only competitor has been essentially eliminated from the race to be the first to the market.3. The phase 2 clinical trial of vadadustat to treat lung inflammation and damage is much closer to completion (75% enrolled) because of a grant for expansion from the government. If there is positive data, it will revolutionize treatment of COVID19 related lung disease and save the lives of countless patients around the world.Because of these compelling reasons, I bought more shares today."
Akebia will be out of business. If trial fails. They have nothing. Auxria a flop. Nobody will want it. Gamble on trial that's it
Can AKBA hit $40?
i see no mention of today sec filling regarding FGEN patent
"I think people on this board and many doctors I know make the mistake of oversimplifying anemia in a patient who happens to have CKD. I frequently get referrals from doctors who basically don’t want to deal with working up anemia. It is very complex. I find that there’s usually a cause that has nothing to do with CKD. And prescribing an ESA is inappropriate in those situations. And if roxadustat or vadadustat are widely prescribed inappropriately (which seems to be what many are banking on), there will be poor outcomes and the medications may ultimately not be available to use at all if that happens. The FDA is rightfully concerned about this I suspect."
JP Morgan says there is a direct read through from Fibrogen to Akebia based on FDA comments during adcom- analyst says agency has serious concerns about safety of this drug class. Guess that explains the 2 handle.
"Today's FDA Adcom voting results are bad news for FGEN but good news for AKBA. AKBA's dosing design is different and does not have the safety concerns exhibited in FGEN's trials. There was no disagreement among Adcom members that the CKD patient population needs this new class of drugs. FDA may still approve FGEN's drug, but I think it is not very likely. As such, AKBA's drug will likely be the first-in-class drug to be marketed in the US."
"If you are thinking about playing the bounce, just check out these other bio stocks which also got FDA rejection: $AKBA, $ITRM, $ARDX, $ADVM"
I have been is Kerx and Akba forever. I am beginning to believe that sometimes a $2.50 stock is just worth $2.50. I will hold and I suspect that my heirs will have to deal with this problem child!

Does VAST. have an application for EU approval yet??
"Did they get Auryxia back onto the fast track payment reimbursement system yet?And, what is the status on those Covid Trials assisting with ARDS?"
"I suggest that everyone should read the August 16th 2021, FiercePharma article on Akebia. This can be accessed by googling ""Fierce pharma Akebia"".Some important points made:""Some of the safety problems that cropped up in roxa’s trial, including thromboembolic events, seizures and serious infections, weren’t seen in vada’s program, Butler noted.""""In the Pro2tect trial, vada matched up to Aranesp on the MACE endpoint in nondialysis patients in the U.S., who made up about half of the trial participants, the CEO pointed out. The different outcome in ex-U.S. patients might be caused by inconsistent clinical practices for managing nondialysis patients in different parts of the world, he said"" This statement is consistent with the post I made yesterday, where I conjectured that the relative frequency of monitoring Vada vrs. the injectable ESAs, could explain for the MACE discrepancy."
Capitan of this ship leading this to storm .All I say to this BOZO gfymf
"Holger Eltzschig, MD, published a summary of the basic science of the role of hypoxia in inflammation in the NEJM 2011, 364(7): 656-665. Describes research in mice that suggests that alveolar-epithelial HIF stabilization reduces lung inflammation. He has been working on this for years. It is reasonable to be optimistic about vadadustat possibly helping to prevent or ameliorate ARDS. The world could use it right now."
open red today for sure
let me guess today's open RED? just a educated guess
nice to see at least 3 spot for a change..let's go for 4 next week!
what time does it go red?
"Hey guys, I read from one PhD on this board that AKBA could hit $40…is it true? What currency are we talking about?"
FGEN is green today
"An ARDS trial started over a year ago for a 14 day treatment. If the results were significant we’d have heard by now. It would be unethical not to show the FDA, given the loss of life Covid is causing.Plenty of other good reasons to invest in AKBA though."
"As I said before, a total Adcom rejection of Roxadustat would cast some negative market sentiment on the potential for Vadadustat FDA approval. That’s what is happening today as AKBA has not responded positively to the FGEN news. However, I believe the negative sentiment will be relatively short lived as the market realizes that Vadadustat actually has a high probability for FDA approval.The primary issues raised by the FGEN’s Adcom were concerns about Cardio vascular safety/risk and the further need to characterize those risks with new detailed study trials. New phase 3 trials would involve significant expense and a multi-year time delay. This basically removes FGEN from the US HIF market. Akebia worked with the FDA in designing their extensive Phase 3 trial, and there is every reason to believe that these trials fully characterized the safety/risk standards required by the FDA. Hence there is a high probability that Vadadustat will receive FDA approval, for at least the DD indication. Analysts have projected a $2B HIF market for DD applications. If Akebia were to capture this market, their revenue stream with Auryxia would be ~$1.2B. A company like Amgen would be a potential buyer of Akebia. Now as Amgen has a price to sales ratio of 5.71, one would expect that they would be willing to buy Akebia at a price say ~4Xsales, which gives Akebia a potential market value of $4.8B, or $30/share. So, folks don’t despair, be patient, the reward/risk ratio is very positive."
"Anybody know which big funds ""dumped"" during the share price plunge on high volume?"
"3/22 When and if Akebia gets both indications the PPS will open at $18, imo, can shorts really take this chance? Just Dialysis should be $9? PPS. Long and strong am not selling my AKBA shares until over $9, imo"
"no insider buying or buy back program at almost the lowest pps in 10 y to show some confident or some support to the common shareholders.Soon an other inducement is Butler big concern , how much discount he will give to personel with shareholders money , and 8 months to go = 8 inducements = dilution of the pps"
buyout please
what time does this turn red?
Bashers getting nervous about to lose their gigs bashing here......
"In addition to FGEN failure, ARDX has failed too (72% haircut after market close). It seems that AKBA is the best player in this field right now !"
red of course
"It occurs to me, that if we have a strong influx of bashers. That we are really in on something. So the more doom sayers, the better our future. Cheers."

Check out SESN. Can it happen to AKBA???
12.5 million shares today and up a mealy 3 cents. Now that's cray cray. Institutions are positioning.
"I hope today's earnings call is the start of some recognition in the market that AKBA's vadadustat is going to being approved and a huge driver of earnings for this company. Given that 1Q 22 is not that far away, we should start to see a long overdue rise in share price until approval."
"At the current price, KERX shares would be $0.95. I could have become CEO, not sold the company, got out of that office lease at the newest most expensive building on the Boston waterfront, slashed a lot of worthless employees, especially the VP of Manufuacturing, and had a nice profitable company with 1/4 billion in sales."
This pretty much flat lined today after 1 pm. Dont think that's a good sign considering earnings are in two days.
I feel like we are are due for a massive volume day. Something north of 40 million shares and within 30 trading days.
The target action date is almost 9 months away. There will most likely be tax selling at the end of the year and other pressures where you can pick this up lower over the next 4-5 months.
PFE bought Trill for $2.2BB at @18.50 ...about what I see for AKBA...
High volume and hedges driving prices down. It is so valuable they want to clear out retail investor. 4 million shares before noon nuts. Albert bought and will be rewarded. Not guessing I watched how odd high volume days and moving down price. They play games with our money and future. The game ends eventually. You either believe in FDA approval or not. When that occurs different game. Dutch
We own two billion market and Vad approval is for sure dialysis. Likely warning for pre- dialysis. Regardless this should be much higher stock price now. Dutch
" What has happened for the SP to jump from $0.7 to $2.1 was a typical quick short covering by hedge funds. But the real ""Blood bath"" will take place on next week after everyone reads the CRL carefully and know that FDA requires at lease 2 years of new trails, manufacturing efforts, and more money to be spent. New stock offering with 50% discount and dilution are for sure on the way. The SP will be under $1 for sure in a couple of weeks. This company was trading at $0.3 sometime ago. Back to basis. Same of what has happened to $AKBA, $ITRM, $ARDX, $ADVM."
"Repeat cycle like last year. Shake the bushes, shake the bushes.....Product is still developing and holds too much promise to stay down."
Someone posted that oxygen therapy could halt Alzheimer’s disease. Could VAD be part of this process in helping to oxygenate?
Akebia has Full Time Employees: 379. What do they all do?
"Sold some today just in case....folk it! Good luck everyone, kept 65% of my AKBA"
"Some thoughts: When Akebia announced the failed MACE results for the Phase3 NDD Vadadustat trial, I wondered why there would be a difference between the NDD and the DD results. I realized that an important factor could be how often a patient is monitored. If a patient is treated with an injectable ESA at a clinic, their vital signs are monitored at every treatment. Hence, if a potential problem arises that could lead to a cardiovascular event, there is a greater probability of detection and treatment for a patient receiving an injectable ESA than one who is treated by taking a pill without clinical visits. This logic can explain why the DD MACE results for Vadadustat and Darbepoetin alpha were comparable; in both cases, the patient’s vital signs were monitored at the same frequency. This issue casts a negative shadow for the potential FDA Vadadustat approval for the NDD indication. For the DD indication there should be no problem for the patients receiving dialysis at clinics. However, the monitoring problem arises for the home dialysis patients using a pill to treat their anemia."

"The FDA Rejects FibroGen Drug. The Damage to the Stock Is Already Done.By Josh Nathan-KazisAug. 11, 2021 9:53 am ETOrder ReprintsPrint ArticleThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s rejection of FibroGen’s application for approval of its drug roxadustat, long expected by investors, finally arrived early Wednesday morning.In a statement, FibroGen (ticker: FGEN) said it had received a so-called complete response letter from the FDA, saying that the agency will not approve roxadustat to treat anemia of chronic kidney disease.

"@John it is already too late once there are break through infections to vaccinated people. The new variant Mu is already here in US that the protection of V dropped to 1/7 for this new variant. Also, it is found that animals are able to be infected by COVID. it means there is no way to eradicate this virus. vaccine development is always lagging the mutation of virus. it is nonsense to mandate a ""V"" that does not prevent infection."

"Short shares on AKBA dropped 969,701 to 13,006,081 as of 8/13/2021. The shorts are in no hurry. They have until March of 2022. I will continue to add below $2.50."
Remember akba at $14 and mRNA at $12
So we missed on earnings again by more than projected… Again. What a surprise. But we’re up 14 1/2%. What the heck?
How do we get rid of Butler???????? I am guessing Baupost couldn't...... what is Butler's strength that he can charge 1+ million while doing NOTHING for shareholder value..... needs to take a leave of absence without pay till we hear something.
I'm glad it is up but does anybody know why? is it all in anticipation of tomorrow's news related to FGEN?
Did an add-on @ $2.75 this morning. Probably my last buy of AKBA unless it drops below $2.50 again..

incompetence of management = inability to get Auryxia covered by CMS after 500 million dollar development including FDA approval; failure to move up an expedited review of Vada to get the drug on the market ASAP and pay off FDA the way you need to to get through; failure to keep the confidence of Wall Street; failure to increase shareholder value for 7+. years....... how does as CEO get to stay on and have salary increases through all that??????
"If Vadast... is approved and being used in Japan, why isn't that information and/or success of all those users figure in the case for using it in the US? I get drug trails and separate studies, but doesn't the fact that people are using it now for what i figure is a long time help to justify or count in the analysis? is it not relevant?"

Okay over 6 million shares. Stock up and a mess of trades we're down again. May buy but not selling a penny. Surprised games continue but not in shock. Auryxia sales make us undervalued @ 2.50. Dutch
A close above $3!! $3.05 x .37433 conversion factor + $1.14 for us ex-KERX folks.
Tread lightly potential buyers. As a long and long term bag holder via kerx don't get #$%$ over 15 cents - she'll take it away like a champ.

"After roxa’s thumbs-down at the advisory committee in July, Cantor’s Alethia Young said vada’s peak sales in U.S. dialysis patients could reach $1.2 billion, assuming a market penetration of 40%. Piper Sandler’s Christopher Raymond has put the drug’s 2025 sales at $629 million worldwide. BTIG’s Bert Hazlett has calculated nearly $500 million U.S. dialysis sales for that year."
"Folks, I’m a painfully long holder of AKBA.But need to point out the hype over the covid trial. It’s a 14 day treatment phase 2 trial that’s set to run 2 years. 2 years?? The Remdesivir ACTT1 trial started in 2/2020 and was approved as the standard of care by 10/20. Let’s be realistic."

"Drop from 4.30 to 2.50 in a month, guess what? I’m a buyer!!"
don't you wish you bought MRNA up over $320 in 18 months!
The institutions ONLY OWN 62.67% of the outstanding shares in AKBA. They screwed up and want more and the only way to get retail shares is to take the price down. I have seen this same scenario in my 53 years of investing. DO NOT SELL and the price will come back up as retailers step in to buy.
"August 5, 2021: As we discussed previously, UTHealth is engaged in an ongoing investigator sponsored study of vadadustat as a potential therapy to prevent and lessen the severity of acute respiratory distress syndrome or ARDS, in adult patients who ve been hospitalized due to COVID-19. They currently have over 300 patients enrolled in this 400-patient study, and when possible, we ll share an update on the study."
