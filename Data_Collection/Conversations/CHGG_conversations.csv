Keeps chugging along
"If they reported better-than-expected 2Q earnings yesterday ,why is going down today?"
Down 17% this month. It has to bounce at some point
"Any thoughts, We are at the 52wk low... futures lowering this month. Curious as to where the bleeding stops."
whats going on?
"People who care about minor price fluctuations should stop investing and try to get quick money with more volatile stocks. Pins is one of the best stocks to buy at these prices. Maybe it goes down a bit, then buy the dip. I Bought $SQ at 36, $CHGG at 29, $ETSY at 40, $ZM at 63 $, $PYPL at 100. Many people one these boards were saying these are wothless stocks, or moving slow. I truly believe Pins will be a triple digit stock in the coming years. ARK investments (Cathie Wood, look it up) has also added PINS to their portfolio. Scientific research has proven that short term traders, will earn quick money, while long term holders gather the most wealth overtime!If you are not happy with PINS then sell the stock and chase other opportunities. However, PINS is a safe investment. I posted last week a post with some facts. Look it up."
"Yes yes, vaccine news is very welcome and very promising... But reality is no vaccines will be delivered in a widespread fashion to the public until 6 months from now... AND the vaccines have not even been tested in children yet, so they would not be the first to get it ."
"I agree with the sentiment here that CHGG was a bit over punished for this earnings report. BUT the downward price movement itself shouldn't be a surprise to investors. CHGG reported a 3rd qtr loss of $37.1 million ($.29 share) vs. only $.10 same qtr. last year. This on a day when pandemic cases increase while stimulus hopes are dashed. Not only did the Dow, S&P and Nasdaq do a nose dive but how do covid stocks tank due to higher pandemic conditions? Streaming stocks (ROKU), telemedicine (TDOC, DOCRF) Cannabis (GRWG, TCNNF, CURLF, GTBIF, CRLBF, CGC, TLRY) all tanked. Just a really bad day on the market which magnified the earnings decline. A revenue beat is simply not going to overcome that gravity. But the segment of on line education is clearly the future and the revenue trend proves that. I have a sizeable position on CHGG and have zero concern. Going to have a margarita now and celebrate the good sleep that solid investment research brings!! You should do the same, you longs have earned it with solid decision making and patience. Cheers:)!!"
People are going back to work and college.Will this stock hold above $80?
CHGG technical charts are trending for Bullish today. It may go to 120.
Kicking myself for not buying more when this was in the 60’s. For anybody doubting just wait for this earnings report. Every college kid in the country is using this.
"Last month I posted on here saying CHGG would be a long term investment. As an educator, I know that many colleges and universities will not be opening up in the Fall. Those that do, there will be less on-campus presence and more online. 9/11 changed the way we looked at security. COVID will forever change the nature of how we are educated and how we pay for things. I would recommend CHGG and SQ in your portfolio for the very long term."
"Analysts' price target is $112.81. If actual earnings exceed expectations on May 3 and CHGG becomes profitable, this stock will POP! I upped my stake at $87.81 with the hope that it'l return in excess of 25% in a little over a month."
Hearing monster earnings beat expected.
Great long term hold
5% down on blowout earnings and they gave a positive guidance.
"bought only 20 shares @84.5 , poor man still has right to earn money "
Great earnings report!
And that's why I'm also adding more DocuSign shares. Why would any company go back to paper after trying digital signature/storage etc.
"Volume has been tiny, I would be skeptical of these high prices."
Hold on to your shares you will be rewarded.
This will fly to the sky tomorrow
I am looking to buy @36 now.
"Pull back consolidation, will start moving right before earnings. Steady and sound company"
"Now that we're seeing support across the board for growth stocks, I'm still sticking by my $100 PT. Unfortunately, it'll be over the next 30-60 days instead of this past May. GLTA! Just know long term, CHGG is a leader in their space and they will deliver!"
The Chegg CEO was interviewed on Barron's 'Streetwise' podcast recently; same for CEO of Generac. Shares of both companies down significantly since then. I'm exploring this further to see if there is correlation to other CEOs interviewed by Jack Hough. Maybe kiss of death?
What is the hype about? Slowing service and subs growth relative to Q3. The beat on estimates equal to Q3 on revenues. After the 3Q release the stock traded at 26! Where is the new data to trade at 38?? The incremental est. increase with stock 50% higher in 3 months?? On top of that the convertible with strike price at 27. Not to mention about p/e...
"Morgan Stanley analyst Josh Baer sums up Chegg’s performance in clear, unmistakable terms: “Near-term, Chegg's value proposition becomes stronger as universities shift to virtual classes and students require more tools to supplement education. Long-term, a prolonged COVID-19 impact and potential recession in [our] bear case could result in higher student enrollment.”Baer reiterates his Buy rating on CHGG stock, and his price target, $49, predicts 63% upside growth, showing his confidence in the stock. Chegg shares are rated a Strong Buy from the analyst consensus, as 7 out of 8 recent reviewers came down on the Buy-side. The lone holdout rated the stock a Hold. The average price target of $44.75 suggests a premium of nearly 50% from the current share price of $31."
Great earnings beat. Should see a decent pop tomorrow 
Do you think CHGG will be up post earnings? Thumps UP for higher stock price and Thumps DOWN for lower stock price.
"not selling a single share, online education is here to stay."
What is going on here? Mean price targets at $108. Is it the lawsuit? That will get settled.
"There was a short trade alert issued on 9/1/2020.The alert states a head and shoulders top that formed. Downside target of about $60. Stop around $78.Short Percent of Float 10.93 %Short Interest (Shares Short) 13,030,000Still holding my shares!!!"
"With no real plan of action for tackling the pandemic, cases will continue to rise higher then ever; just look at the data if you don't believe me. States will go back into lockdown and people will continue to learn online for the indefinite future. CHGG is going to rise higher then before as people realise it's potential excluding the pandemic. I've bought even more shares and plan to hold till the end of year, don't be surprised to see it reach $100."
This is a great stock it is loosing 5% every day And it is still overvalued
Is the head and shoulders too obvious? Like no way they let it go to 40?
University of Tennessee opens back up in the fall. As a college student myself I have been using chegg sense 2016. I think current events just made it more know about by college students. I do not see this stock dropping much in the fall.
"These numbers and guidance which most companies skip are great. The street does not seem to excited , and I cannot figure it out . $CHGG should be pushing 100"
Congrats to all the longs here :) Slowly increase everyday is best for our longs.
Guess what stock price we will have on Tuesday? I guess $90+
"Looks like chegg is forming an ascending triangle (for those of you chart traders). With a resistance of like $88 if it can break that resistance, The pattern suggest anywhere from a 20-40% run up, but only if it can break 88-90 on solid volume"
"Chegg is a fascinating growth stock well positioned as a leader in an industry ripe for change. Similar origin story to amazon. Start out simple, execute well, and continue to innovate. It has the right management, and given the accelerated need for online learning across the world, it’s a long bet I’m willing to make. Especially with the right acquisitions."
"""For the majority of the business in the U.S., we don't have a significant competitor ... outside the U.S., there is nobody with our size or scale or balance sheet"" (CEO Dan Rosensweig on the earnings call)"
"I have two sons, one in high school and the other in college...trust me when I say they'd rather pay $15 for a website to do their online homework and tests for them rather than actually study."
"As a college student and investor, I believe this is going to blow up. All of my friends are buying Chegg accounts to help with their online homework, quizzes and tests. I have a Chegg account and I just bought 100 shares"
looking good
New high every day
I buy CHGG because I saved SO much money in grad school buying and renting books from them. It just works.
I can see this @ $40 eoy. Every other person I know in college uses this platform. Quiet and steady
Total Net Revenues of approximately $388 million for 2019!!!
I think people are just taking their profits out of fear .. I’d hold
microsoft or google should buy this company.
Tomorrow it may open low but will finish $90+. Hold on to your shares.
raised guidance for the 3rd straight time and still down. I don't get it.
if it beats earnings and starts to up trend how many days in a row will it constantly go up (new to stocks )
Sec filings Insiders are selling stock￼... Huuugeee
Holding until $100. Ignoring the nasdaq correction we're having and buying on every major dip on this great company.
"With schools starting back up, I wouldn’t be surprised to see CHGG make higher highs."
"Buying opportunity for me. This was an excellent growth stock BEFORE Covid-19 was even identified. EVERYTHING that can go digital/virtual eventually does. And learning was already heading down that path. Not 100% virtual at all, but as a supplement."
"Down 15 pts in (3) days, this is a options trader delight. Next time I will sell on the run-up. I want investments not just short term trades, not sure about this one as a long term investment. All hype. Maybe I will be wrong."
"so the person, Schultz Nathan J.PRESIDENT OF LEARNING SERVICES , just sold 1/5 of his chgg shares at just over 80/share. who is pushing for 90 and 100?"
Strong support in price. People are selling because they think schools are opening safely hahahaha.
120-130 soon?
"this company has fraudulently charged my old credit card on numerous occasions and I do not believe I am the only victim, when I confronted my CC company of the charges they said this situation occurs regularly with others as well. If you use this company please we wary of charges to your CC as well that you never intended."
"chegg has me down so much(bought @77 a share) nyc shuts down all schools and chegg still only goes up 2% on the best news it could ever recieve. so frustrating because value stocks will go up 5% on good news and chegg goes up a lousy 2% for their good news. if they didn't close schools, this stock would even drop more"
With earnings this has been on our watchlist for potential day trades. Good luck to everyone out there. See what else is on our watchlist. https://daytrading.group/DailyTradeIdeas
Bought 20 $45 calls based on today's trade this stock is going to soar ah
I have invested 150k and this is what we are getting .
I thought this will fly after hours.
so i am thinking they will continue to do good in business because alot school is online still people use this so am guessing next earning is very positive.
"I just noticed the 12 mo consensus price target is $114, w a high of $125"
Why down today?
Absolutely no movement on this stock at all. You would think that with the majority of classes all being held online that this would be flying through the roof at this point.
"I wave the white flag. I caved. They win. I know it's a great co., but the shorts beat me down.... Good luck longs."
whats causing sudden drop...
"the price for ""valuations do not matter"" will be exceedingly high."
Why is this down $5.24 in the pre-market???
"Just invested 200 shares in CHGG. I missed the COVID run but believe the headwinds of reopening are misunderstood for this name. Virtual learning is not going away once the economy reopens. This stock provides everything I want to see in a growth name. 30 percent earnings growth rate, 41% revenue growth for the current quarter, solid gross profit and free cash flow growth over the last few years, etc. This pullback is a buying opportunity and I am taking full advantage. This will revisit the $110s and then take them out. Long term I remain bullish even with economic reopening."
"The TV piece yesterday about Chegg buying Notehall, the online marketplace for school class notes, is what sparked the demand today. It wasn't the recent earnings, which beat estimates but still has them losing money."
This is not a virus play. Look at the revenue trend prior to March 2020.
https://financialnews.media/the-cure-for-the-coronavirus-flu
Who’s in this ?
just sold half my shares to break even. keeping the other half invested because of great company potential... does anyone know of any other stock similar to this one? $CHGG is a similar equity but tutorial based and its $70/share.
"All time high, just as I predicted one month ago."
"Chegg's (NYSE: CHGG) role in higher education has become more vital than ever as universities across the world move to online teaching in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. The company provides writing, tutoring, assignment solutions to university students, as well as selling and lending textbooks and e-books. It costs just $15 to $20 per month for a Chegg subscription -- a relative bargain when weighed against the time students can save by using the service to help them grasp difficult concepts.During the second quarter, Chegg's revenue grew by an astonishing 63% year over year to $153 million. Net income reached $10.6 million, compared with the net loss of $2 million it booked in Q2 2019. The company added nearly 1.5 million subscribers during the year, bringing its total membership count to 3.7 million.Given the massive adoption of online education that has taken place in 2020, Chegg's growth streak is likely far from over. For the full year, the company expects to generate $615 million in revenue, up from $411 million last year. Since October 2019, shares of Chegg are up by more than 90%."
Is it safe to buy at 30??
Shorted more at 63 looks like I will wait for next week to cash in on this one. CHGG benefitted from a strong market week. Down market will have this sliding right along with it albeit a bit faster on the decline cause it has risen so much. Till next week and the low 50s. Longs you did well take the $$
CHGG reached a new All Time High at 24.96
"Rev +64%, Subs +74%"
Vaccine news is not gonna be good for Chegg
I think this can hit 110+
CHGG customers (students) are an asset to the company and todays announcement on 2020 polling is an example how they can leverage that asset to promote use of the CHGG platform. I would expect many new innovative tools to continue to be developed by the company.
"This is the new environment we live in now. It's no longer about trading on fundamentals. Its about trying to out game everyone. Solid revenue, solid EPS in line with analysts, solid guidance moving forward. Stock gets bought up in after hours and pre-market, and then the fund managers bring it right back down. Maybe if the SEC wants a fair and legal market they should start looking at this instead of GME short sellers getting owned by retail investors. This is a solid company, but the game is clearly being played everywhere by everyone."
The proceeds will used by the company for corporate stuff. Smart business move. Will pay off in the long-term for investors
Be cheerful. Today we reached the highest close @102.35 :)
Banking on this going down is not a good idea. This is a great platform with a lot of growth people are subscribing left and right. 35% subscriber growth this quarter. By the way CHEGG has been crushing earnings. With all the people out of school this is the best place to go for help. Also buying books. The play is a long term the short sellers will be gone soon.
"Anyone trying to build up a bear case against Chegg by saying that they are making money off of students cheating, is being dishonest. Cheating occurred before Chegg and will continue with or without Chegg. Education is always dynamic and innovating, and will continue to be more and more online. The more 'remote' you make education, the larger the possibility for academic dishonesty, so it is up to the schools and universities to update their teaching and testing methods so cheating has less of an impact. It appears the nice little run Chegg has had since the beginning of June went mostly unnoticed until recently and I think it could continue till at least earnings. I am betting that with a good August 2nd earnings report and the increased attention the stock will get once schools are starting back up after summer break, we will definitely see the all time high ($115) again before year end."
"I was going to say ""Watch for the bounce tomorrow"" but it's already starting to rise in early after hours trading."
Sell today. Way overpriced now. Short covering
Manipulation to the max. Best earnings and nothing but sell off.
"On July 2, $SSSS management projected Q2 2020 NAV at $11.70 - $12.00 per share. They specified that range reflects maintaining Palantir at its March 31, 2020 valuation, which was $30.54 million. Based on its Q1 10-Q (page 5) that value is 89% higher than its 2012 cost basis of $16.2 million, invested when Palantir conducted an equity capital raise at a value of $4 billion. The result is that the Palantir investment contributing to the $12.00 NAV values the company at $7.5 billion. In October 2018, Morgan Stanley projected a Palantir 2020 IPO value of $36 billion - $41 billion. Since then, Palantir's growth rate - according to some reports - has exceeded expectations, and public market Saas revenue multiples have exploded, suggesting a higher potential market valuation for Palantir.Assuming Palantir's market value is at the high end of the Morgan Stanley 2018 projection, at $41 billion, the incremental value for the $SSSS $12.00 NAV is $8.00 NAV based on an additional $136 million of estimated market value ($41 billion / $7.5 billion = 5.47 - 1 = 447% x $30.54 million = $136 million). This results in an NAV of $20. One way to look at SSSS is that at a current price of $12.00, an investor is paying probable fair market value for Palantir, while receiving the rest of the portfolio - which contributes ~85% towards management's July 2 2020 $12.00 NAV estimate - for free. Additionally, the two largest holdings, online education companies Coursera and Course Hero, make up ~35% of the portfolio. They are arguably undervalued within the NAV given the strong appreciation of $CHGG and $TWOU. The Friday evening Barron's article drew attention to a relatively unknown play on Palantir. Given embedded valuation assumptions, it is easy to see what call option buying for September/December is extremely active today. This stock could easily top $15 over the next few trading sessions."
why down today
"Nearly 300,000 NYC families opt-out of hybrid school reopening plan, sign up for remote-only learning this fall"
College students are going online. Schools with 500+ cases. This stock is going up.
They are going to give a positive forecast . The future of learning on line due to a pandemic
waaaayyyy too many calls relative to puts. overvaluation here is a real and identifiable concern. chgg offers DISCRETIONARY services during a massive economic contraction. Discretionary stuff gets murdered during depressions.
"Well turns out I was wrong, hopefully they’ll realize tomorrow they should be buying not selling"
"We will hit 40 + today and hold above that, let the earnings sink in to the funds mgt and upgrade to strong buy target 60"
Good luck to long term holders today. We should see continued cultural adoption of online education and continued rev growth for Chegg!
CHGG CEO (former Yahoo COO) was on CNBC just a few minutes ago. He was surprised that CHGG is getting popular internationally. CHGG also provides online tutoring for a monthly fee of $14.99 or $19.99. Interesting thing is that he also mentioned that CHGG is very popular on TikTok with 5 million hashtags. He thinks the new behavior of online learning would be sustainable.
"Watch, this stock will open up in the green."
"paraphrasing what's just on the investor call: ""People have confused us with back to work, or back to school type. We are neither of those.... We have looked data all throughout. Doesn't matter your location, hybrid, in school, at home. The conversion rate is the same. The only thing that will impact us is if there is no school. How Covid impacted us is that it brings forward international awareness of Chegg product"""
"Massive beat. And—even more important—great guidance. It ran up a lot into earnings, which I think clearly explains AH. But no reason for concern."
Just don't understand this stock of late; no logic that I cam comprehend
who’s long here?
I’m out. A do nothing stock during record high market runs. You guys can have it.
New York just switched to fully remote learning. Meaning more usage for online assignments/tests. I’m guessing other democratic states will follow as well
"I’m a college student. D1, everyone uses Chegg where I’m from. This company is still growing. It’s honestly a need in college. In 100 shares @68$. Will avg down if it dips below 64> this will hit new highs in early 2021. Let’s ride "
PRDO earnings tomorrow 
this is a good hold - i’m a university student and i’m telling you every student uses this
"As a recent college grad, I can say Chegg is fantastic. As online schooling will continue to grow and Chegg expands its services, it will grow exceptionally well."
"Earning was good. This is bull , inside selling has to be first go to S.E.C. for authorization 9.5 % drop for no reason"
I'm a long term holder....they didn't beat by enough to drive the stock much higher. Great long term stock with story. I'll continue to add but this will be in the 90s until there are numbers post vaccine rollout.
Anyone there? This is an amazing company!!
The CHGG business is accelerating in terms of revenue and profitability. Clearly they are successful at leveraging their assets. I would expect an announcement in the near future that will add to their business growth. Shares will most likely continue to advance and my new target is $100 up from $50.
"As a student myself, Yahoo answers going down is a HUGE deal. There is effectively no other alternative for free hw help (or cheating depending on its use) out there anymore. I have no idea about the business aspect if things, but anecdotally, I think Chegg can expect a surge of subscriptions"
Wait for tmrw market open to see how good/bad earnings was on stock. Not enough volume atm.
"If CHGG pops on earnings, anyone going to either rotate or add to their LRN (K12 Inc) positions? They report next week."
"hurry , day traders- quick cover , as you can't afford to hold this stock overnight. loooosas"
WOW! Pretty AWESOME numbers!
a little confused. they missed estimates yet it is surging after hours. due to guidance?
"Thank you for the dip this morning, never thought I'd be able to add more at 65 after yesterday"
Love myself a healthy dip
"I have motion sickness with this rollercoaster activity watching CHGG and my other stocks. I may have to take some Dramamine. hahaGot out too early only to see CHGG make new highs. Now with the nice 3Q report and raising full year guidance, might be getting back in with this dip. Just not sure when.I realized there so many factors currently going on such as pending stimulus payments, uncertain presidential vote, high valuations, Covid related, Robinhood traders, wild fires, record unemployment, etc.I like the quote from a chief market strategist saying “We’re not seeing a lot of panic or fear. APATHY is a good description."
Looking at the financials if this upcoming earnings beat expectations falling in line with their growing balance sheet this stock will pop. And many college students are in need at the moment in attempt to finish their classes. This is a direct opportunity to purchase more shares and optimize potential amount of gains.
Yikes: Was about to buy this morning out of the gate and am lucky I did not. Any reason why this stock is dropping so much today?
"One thing for sure: business is booming. And right now wall street likes growth story, especially likes rapid growth story like chgg. Don't fight the trend or you will miss the boat.glta"
"Everyone is expecting a stock that is directly related to schools to fluctuate into high numbers....First off, college students have yet start their semester yet so be patient a little while until next month.Therefore, the price is considered a discount.Mid September is when the price of this stock will sky rocket due to the fact that many college students will be using CHGG for their ""studying"" material."
Great price action last couple of days
"Amazing stock, with right execution can become the next Netflix in educational services and products."
"AWESOME BEAT FOR CHGG - THEIR 5TH STRAIGHT. I bought in early and continue to buy more, especially with international markets in sight + 80% brand recognition. The growth is staggering and they own the content making it super profitable. I see tons more upside form year. $50 by early 2019."
The only silver lining is their projected Outlook which has them actually earning in the green for next quarter and full year 2020 and growing into 2021Still think they need to expand a lot to justify their market cap and P/E...
"Total Net Revenues of $198.4 million, an increase of 51% year-over-year• Chegg Services Revenues grew 62% year-over-year to $162.4 million, or 82% of total net revenues, compared to76% in Q1 2020• Net Loss was $65.2 million which included a $78.2 million loss on early extinguishment of debt related to 2025 notes• Non-GAAP Net Income was $46.4 million• Adjusted EBITDA was $57.1 million• 4.8 million: number of Chegg Services subscribers, an increase of 64% year-over-year• 356 million: total Chegg Study content views"
Still think we see earnings as a beat. College students buying chegg more than ever sitting at home
"Pearson files a lawsuit against Chegg (in the FT today) alleging that they violated its rights on a “massive scale” by reproducing hundreds of thousands of questions from Pearson textbooks & selling them w/ answer s as part for a $14.95 “homework help” subscription service for students. It goes on to say Chegg “systematically” continuing to publish sets fm thousands of textbooks, replicating copyrighted material so students could “easily search for and find answers to the textbook questions they have been assigned”. It alleged this violated Pearson’s exclusive copyright, undermined educational progression and could encourage university lecturers to reconsider using textbooks for their courses.(Pearson has been around for 177 years.) It states that Chegg has attracted criticism from educators who argue its services enable widespread cheating. Chegg did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
"Q2 2021 Highlights:Total Net Revenues of $198.5 million, an increase of 30% year-over-yearChegg Services Revenues grew 38% year-over-year to $173.5 million, or 87% of total net revenues, compared to 82% in Q2 2020Net Income was $32.8 millionNon-GAAP Net Income was $71.7 millionAdjusted EBITDA was $84.4 million4.9 million: number of Chegg Services subscribers, an increase of 31% year-over-year367 million: total Chegg Study content views"
Entire market under pressure. Schools going virtual left and right. Colleges closing. This stock will go back to the 80s soon.
Have you read that?https://citronresearch.com/the-poster-child-for-institutionalized-academic-cheating/
Maybe the momentum is catching on now like it did for Zoom Video Communications.
"I've seen many earnings, this is normal, the spread between ask and bid is huge (in AH due to low Volume) so people don't buy, usually it goes up when the market opens tommorow, the beat was nice, i just bought, good luck for all"
Time to take profits and let this drop back to reality before buying back in.
Subscribers and revenue rapidly increasing. As students go back to school we will see those numbers continue to grow. This is a winner
Time to load up!!!
are we good to buy the dip here ?!?!? im thinking of buying 2000 shares at 74.5
the economy is in collapse with unemployment at record highs (higher than great depression). given that chgg services are discretionary (and plenty of competitors offer books to rent and tutoring) where is the funding coming from to purchase chgg services going forward? The margins are slim to nonexistent already.
Revenue growth 80% and EPS beat. BEATS BEATS BY DR DRE !
100 shares at 67 avg
Buyer beware. Insiders are heavily selling the stock with the lifting of restrictions on the stock. The public float is substantially larger now
New to this board. Looks like a few paid Trolls are trying to get the weak hands to sell. Good company better buying opportunity especially with them going to subscription services world wide. Just mute the Trolls and clean up this board so you can get good information from people that do their due diligence
Right now is the time to add to existing positions or simply buy for the first time
"Anyone thinking ahead to Sept and anticipating a lot of schools (elementary, middle, high, colleges, universities) having their students learn remote at home or a hybrid of in-class and remote? I would think this is a further boon for Chegg in the coming months. Any thoughts?"
"Nice move. Should see $100 in May. ER was excellent, outlook was excellent, company is making the right moves. This isn't a pandemic play. Nobody likes going to the textbook store or the school's bookstore since they both rip you off."
"Any theories on the reversal here? Huge day Fri, terrible Tues. Weird price action."
"Fundamentally speaking, this stock will continue to thrive and skyrocket further as schools have just started and more demand will come in than ever before thanks to the stay-at-home precautions set by many nations. and student's just focusing on accomplishing their assignments instead of doing it themselves. Financially speaking, The company is doing really good especially amidst a pandemic and the numbers are very surprising. They beat analysts' expectations by a long shot. And it has gotten price target upgrades from big banks as well as small ones."
Lol. Stock is down with rest of general tech sector. Stock will be going up! Easy money.
CHGG continues domination. So glad I got this at $5.55 and now enjoying massive gains
Man this is a long term winner. Buying more under $32
"Chegg is in for a big day tomorrow boys... but if you look at CVS stock, its about to sky rocket up with the preparation of the first wave of deploying the covid 19 vaccine. Get it while you can..."
It’s currently falling...
The demand to Work From Home (WFH) is real. Next will be the demand to LFH : Learn From Home. People have discovered that they don’t don’t need steel and concrete towers for work…and don’t need ivory towers for learning.
The CEO did not do the company any favors by selling a bunch of stock and then diluting. Talk about needing some 'education'. That is company management 101 stuff.
"Chgg is scheduled to release its earnings results for the third quarter of 2020 which ended September 30, 2020, on Monday, October 26th, 2020, after the market close. It is 1 week earlier than last quarter (August 3).Must be great earning!!!"
Stock will bounce back
Don’t worry. Business is great. Guidance was great. Chegg is going to be just fine.
"Probably this news: ""Chegg (NYSE:CHGG) PT Lowered to $95.00 at KeyCorp. Their previous PT was $115"
anyone bagholding with at least 1000 shares bought abot $72 ????
There are a lot of short sale today. I wonder if they will cover tomorrow.
BIG NEWS:Corporate Vice President of Gaming Ecosystem at Microsoft brings more than ten years of experience building industry shaping technology partnerships and company growth to Chegg’s board. - Business Insider
Bulls $ZVo reports AH - will smashhhh earnings. Online schools get them all
Almost 12 percent of floats are shorts. Expect a huge short squeeze this week. End of week over 100.
Man shakedown or ER leaked?
"Seriously, Q1 was great but unexpected, and that’s when the big jump happened and then it ran up even more into Q2, which was also great but expected. So just invest because it’s a great company and stop trying to make a quick buck."
Thank you for today's sale! Will pick up more if we get below $58 this week. Stay strong all you longs.
large sellers quietly distributing chgg. sell at 3:55 today.
"60% - 64% revenue growth, 69% subscriber growth, increase in EBITDA total plus percentage, get in now."
"I can't think of a single reason why CHGG's sales and earnings would be negatively impacted by the price of crude oil and COVID-19. In fact, COVID-19 should provide a lot of upside with the mass migration to on-line learning. I think this stock could be a 3-bagger within 12 months!"

"Chegg will be back above 87 before market open, and above 90 before end of day."
Fear of stock dilution due to the note offering is what is causing the decline.
"I'm constantly amazed how this company stays alive and keeps growing. Everything they offer can be found for free on the internet if high-schoolers and college students would just look around. A bunch of overpriced ""services"" that can be found for free or much cheaper around the web."
I was looking at this stock when it was in the 60's and see the sudden jump. Is it still a good buying time?Congrats.

"beating expectations, raising guidance what more is needed."
What price should I get in?
"Chegg, Only 6% student penetration so far. Will continue to grow as online learning enhances student learning and competitiveness. The world is changing the way people learn and work."
"This company seems poised for a move to $50. Also, believe LinkedIn/Microsoft would be the perfect company to acquire it."
