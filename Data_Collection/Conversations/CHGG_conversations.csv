It’s gonna keep dropping. Pearson lawsuit could hit them hard. They might have to delete all Pearson content from the site.
"Pearson files a lawsuit against Chegg (in the FT today) alleging that they violated its rights on a “massive scale” by reproducing hundreds of thousands of questions from Pearson textbooks & selling them w/ answer s as part for a $14.95 “homework help” subscription service for students. It goes on to say Chegg “systematically” continuing to publish sets fm thousands of textbooks, replicating copyrighted material so students could “easily search for and find answers to the textbook questions they have been assigned”. It alleged this violated Pearson’s exclusive copyright, undermined educational progression and could encourage university lecturers to reconsider using textbooks for their courses.(Pearson has been around for 177 years.) It states that Chegg has attracted criticism from educators who argue its services enable widespread cheating. Chegg did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
"I wave the white flag. I caved. They win. I know it's a great co., but the shorts beat me down.... Good luck longs."
Is the head and shoulders too obvious? Like no way they let it go to 40?
Remember that Chegg is only doing what Encyclopedia Britannica started over 30 years ago with mail in question and answers. The internet has allowed the masses to share the information.
"Chegg, Only 6% student penetration so far. Will continue to grow as online learning enhances student learning and competitiveness. The world is changing the way people learn and work."
Don't fret. Own another growth stock that went from 102 to 47 to 86 (currently) in a matter of 7 months. And it's still significantly undervalued.
"Any thoughts, We are at the 52wk low... futures lowering this month. Curious as to where the bleeding stops."
"Wow, it's weird how shorts keep pounding this down. So bizarre how far this has fallen."
I am a buyer here. Reversal coming. Going into heavy learning and school season. Crazy margins. Earnings will blow this up back above 70+
"Probably this news: ""Chegg (NYSE:CHGG) PT Lowered to $95.00 at KeyCorp. Their previous PT was $115"
What is going on here? Mean price targets at $108. Is it the lawsuit? That will get settled.
The Chegg CEO was interviewed on Barron's 'Streetwise' podcast recently; same for CEO of Generac. Shares of both companies down significantly since then. I'm exploring this further to see if there is correlation to other CEOs interviewed by Jack Hough. Maybe kiss of death?
Down 17% this month. It has to bounce at some point
The reason f or the drop is move to online learning platforms and awY from textbooks. Time to buy is at 30s
"Any theories on the reversal here? Huge day Fri, terrible Tues. Weird price action."
$30 is coming. Debt is too much.
I am looking to buy @36 now.
anyone bagholding with at least 1000 shares bought abot $72 ????
"buy order set at 55, that's waaay too cheap to ignore!!!"
