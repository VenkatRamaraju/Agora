"This seems like a gift at this price. Very clean balance sheet with lots of cash, and products that should be selling quickly. I'm dipping my toe in the water tomorrow, and I think I will with KHC as well."
"Yowza.. I'm up >13% in 9 trading days with Smucker's, even after today's drop. Also locked down the dividend, payed every 91 days and increased yearly. Not too shabby. Buy low, and the divy's got your back while you wait. Reinvest or helppay the bills in early retirement.. Simple folks if you keep it simple.."
Dividend Increase Due?
"""The J.M. Smucker Co. Announces Pricing of Notes Offering""At least they didn't say it was for ""climate change"", like somebody at GIS...."
I’ll enter at 110ish
That 3.56% dividend yield looks as delicious as a peanut butter and jelly sandwich with some Folgers coffee.
I was wondering why the run up in the stock. The shorts on this were apparently scared off when they saw the action on Gamestop. Lot of open short interest on SJM and if the Reddit Crowd see that and pile in you could have some shorts getting toasted.
After seeing what happened to POST holdings Ill wait until after ER to buy
"Great divs.,products, history, and future as a long term investment. rob divot"
Raw material cost inflation is eating them alive. Should be under $100 with crashing margins and profits
Looking to sell out at cost of 105
Can’t believe I’m the only one following this right now
Long term holder from P&G spinout IPO. Sold some in August. Stock feeling weak again. Hoping for relative strength in downturn. Would like to hold forever...
"Up $8+ on what, renewable energy deal?"
sold this some time back in the $136 area. I didn't have many shares and have watched this thing tank since then. Under $100 seems like a nice discounted price though.
"Glad they went into the pet food business,now will compete amazon.Great timing."
"Paul Smucker said ""nothing like a good depression to boost sales"". Said that to me."
"I'm consolidating my portfolio and have been selling of various holdings for a month or so (locked in some decent returns before seeing this overall decline in share prices). I can tell you that SJM will be staying in my portfolio for the long term. I have at least one (smuckers) peanut butter and (smuckers) jelly sandwich a day (sometimes two) and my wife and I go through Folgers coffee like there is no tomorrow! Our pets have also been eating SJM foods as of late. I love this company, their products are terrific and I think they're going to be around for as long as civilization does. Valuation doesn't look too bad either and ex dividend is incoming on top of the recent decline in share price!"
"omg, see I told you to sell a month ago at the top (look at my comment below). So obvious it wouldn't hold. You buy the dip and sell into the hype, very simple. Smuckers was headed down BEFORE the virus."
90 good entry point
It's worth buying if it dips under 100 again.
Dog stock...you will never get rich on this stock unless you day trade it with a lot of allocated cash..
Starting a position. Looking to add a lot more if we get a market crash. There is value to be had within the all time high and this quality company fits.
i knew i shouldn’t go long with this before ER. Shix
"The only stock that will continue to climb, great company!"
"I don't know the reason, but maybe they think everyone is going to start eating peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. My favorite is the strawberry, I always keep an extra bottle in the cabinet. Now, should I buy or not."
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQwefQzlyTc .. ....JM Smucker + ALPP.. Up 7,700 % in 2021."
Earnings tomorrow:)
When will the bleeding stop?
"Smuckers is a great dividend stock for the long-term. I have been frustrated over the last two years with the stagnation of the stock price, but I have been looking at it from the wrong angle. They sell products people need and want and they have been around for 123 years. Just keep collecting the strong safe dividend and watch your shares accumulate!"
Come on $121
Sold short 3x $100 August puts again for $1.75. Seems like SJM is range-bound between $103 and $112.
Not here to get rich just make dividends. Enjoying the low beta with still some potential
What a dog stock...No movement and the stock market is humming..Can you bark woof woof..
buying putting in my portfolio long term
"Perfect stock to own in a crisis. Good well supported dividend, very little price movement, etc. I'm already up 10% today alone because all the scared investors are running to safety like this company."
What a beautiful stock dividend stock!
I bought a small position. My tech and fintech stocks need company with this dividend stock. Sold my Motley Fool recommendation since I lost money on that.
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2J6WFz0UCE JM Smucker + AABB Gold-backed Crypto Stock Up 2,700 %"
Strange price action on this stock. Up $9 in 4 days with no real news...
