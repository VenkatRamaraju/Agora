everytime powell talks the markets go down.
why the huge drop today? did some hedge fund just sell their huge lot?
"Earning a lot money during the Covid periode, people eating more unhealthy food, now, Covid ended = earning less. I'm not sure this stock is worth 127-140 USD in the comming 1-2 years."
A killer element in their dog food products... being recalled!
Yo
Run for the exit
Earnings Pre-market tomorrow i'm seeing a pattern.
JM Smucker is down 4.98% to 105.56
It's dropping back into the buy zone. $104 yields a 3% dividend. Getting the fresh powder ready.
"I sold short 3 puts on June $100 put for $1. If it falls below $100, I will be OK starting a new position in a solid company for $99. If not, I may still start a small position depending on market and economic condition or add to my other holdings."
Blowout earnings
Great
COME ON LONGS SELL SSELL GIVE U CHEAP SHARES
Yum. Ascending triangle or a pennant on ascending trend for the day. I figure 102 EOD. GLTA
3.2% dividend yield not bad at all.
Buying opportunity of the year. Quality company whose stock is way oversold. Just like Colgate-Palmolive and Kimberly-Clark a few months ago. And you see how the stock of those two bounced back nicely.
Hard No.
rough day for the jelly jar
When will the bleeding stop?
"Out of all the stocks I will buy first when I have the balls to come back in, I feel like this is one of the safest bets. Good financials and product demand through all of this."
"See below, I was right, glad I sold when I did. This is headed back down again"
"One of two stocks up today!! But, I am a dividend person, so who cares anyway. Merry Christmas & Happy New Year folks.Montanakid2000 here."
Did JM Smucker research Nutrish before buying the company? My mom & dad live in separate states & their pets tried eating it and didn't like it. Don't tell me they did a panic buy like General Mills did with Blue Buffalo. Smuckers needs to focus more on taste rather than nutrition. What good is food if people & pets won't eat it?
"The only stock that will continue to climb, great company!"
SJM is down -7.04% to 99.02
under $100 soon ️
nice bounce back today...let's hope it keeps going.
Here we go again... Stock has run up $10 on no news. This happens with regularity. Then it drops again.
This tanks 8% and can't get more than 1 comment. lol
Buying. Performing smoothly under covid and will come back when we get over covid. Divy is nice while I wait. Pet food business should grow a little since animal shelters have been sold out
I see $84 .00 SOON

"Perfect stock to own in a crisis. Good well supported dividend, very little price movement, etc. I'm already up 10% today alone because all the scared investors are running to safety like this company."
I’ll enter at 110ish
Upcoming Key Date for $SJM Shareholders http://crweworld.com/article/news-provided-by-pr-newswire/302235/the-j-m-smucker-company-announces-webcast-of-fourth-quarter-earnings-conference-call
Earnings tomorrow:)
"This seems like a gift at this price. Very clean balance sheet with lots of cash, and products that should be selling quickly. I'm dipping my toe in the water tomorrow, and I think I will with KHC as well."
"To me, Smuckers is a great candidate to be bought out by Berkshire Hathaway. The Smuckers family would get a great buyout and Buffett would probably let them hang around and manage the company."
"Sold short naked 3x $100 puts for $0.75. Strong support at around $103. If it falls below $100, I will be OK being assigned. Meantime, building some cash reserves."
Why is this stock so terrible? Its defensive
"WELL RUN COMPANY...35% OFF OF THEIR ALL TIME STOCK PRICE HIGH A YR AGO,,DEFENSIVE STOCK...HARD TO SCREW UP THE BUSINESS PLAN IN MY OPINION."
JM Smucker is up 4.98% to 111.54
"Gone, see ya @$100"
JM Smucker reached a 52 Week high at 126.99
Dog stock...you will never get rich on this stock unless you day trade it with a lot of allocated cash..
"So they buy a dog food company that wasn't up to standards in the industry as consumerperceptions were changing about stuff folks were feeding their dogs...Now, they must retool the plant with a different raw material much more healthier for pets..Two questions to mgmt..1) Did you not see the trends going forward? Pretty easy to identify by even an undergradtaking a marketing class..2) Did you ever ask the question why the previous owner of the dog food company was selling? I am gonna take a guess...probably because they did see the mktg. trends and wereinterested in selling a dog of a company they knew was gonna cost them a pile to retrofit.Pitiful...."
bit expensive
Looking to sell out at cost of 105
Accumulate.
I bought a small position. My tech and fintech stocks need company with this dividend stock. Sold my Motley Fool recommendation since I lost money on that.
talk about punishing a stock -----anyone think its not a great stock? Might want to jump back in when the dust settles.Any thoughts?
150.00 high over 2 yrs ago...What happened?Mgmt..has no clue.My opinion..
"Downtrend, look at the monthly chart"
SJM reached a 52 Week low at 99.11
I'll buy 103
overextended
Strange price action on this stock. Up $9 in 4 days with no real news...
my dog says a $135-45 buyout coming soom from overseas.
I would actually buy this if I thought it might not get dragged down in an entire economic meltdown. doesn't make any sense why unicorn BS scam artist so called growth company stocks have skyrocketed over the past 10 years while a solid earnings company like this has suffered.
Going under $100 today
Issa buy
SJM reached a 52 Week low at 96.19
Business is good/dividend is very good. Pretty safe investment even with a Dem administration.
JM Smucker reached a 52 Week low at 96.19
Starting a position. Looking to add a lot more if we get a market crash. There is value to be had within the all time high and this quality company fits.
This stock can't find a consistent path UP. One drop after another after these little marches ahead.
Wonder what the big drop was for?
Just jams and jellies...but divvy aint bad..
SJM up $1.59 at close and down $0.02 just one minute after close! Only one out of 30 companies I hold to go UP!Should be a good buying day tomorrow; maybe all week.
I prefer Raspberry
Got at $118.88 yesterday!
Retirees own this for the 3% dividend.
This economy is driven by low income people. If they cannot make money here when are they going to? Out!
With 10% of shares short this will move to 150 by EOY.
“With a name like Smucker it’s got to be good.”
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2J6WFz0UCE JM Smucker + AABB Gold-backed Crypto Stock Up 2,700 %"
90 good entry point
"Smuckers is a great dividend stock for the long-term. I have been frustrated over the last two years with the stagnation of the stock price, but I have been looking at it from the wrong angle. They sell products people need and want and they have been around for 123 years. Just keep collecting the strong safe dividend and watch your shares accumulate!"
Dividend Increase Due?
"Perhaps this is just me, but it looks like this stock has developed a nice divergence between the stock price and the RSI, which would be a bullish indicator. Anyone else seeing this?"
Raw material cost inflation is eating them alive. Should be under $100 with crashing margins and profits
Baggees in a jam on this one.
Can't stand all the activity here?
JM Smucker is up 4.94% to 104.17
Elon Musk...
"Sjm-not much upside, food hoarding is over"
What a beautiful stock dividend stock!
"Up $8+ on what, renewable energy deal?"
Alright! Looks like it’s almost time to buy some cheap PB&J sandwiches
sold this some time back in the $136 area. I didn't have many shares and have watched this thing tank since then. Under $100 seems like a nice discounted price though.
I'm betting the higher margins on coffee will more than offset any increased operating costs. We shall see.
NO COME BACK NO COME BACK
"Mo said three days ago the economy is driven by low income....Low income means what? Under $50K per year, maybe, but they still eat junk food etc. and go to restaurants and waste their little money. JSM is a mini PG which has no food products anymore. That's how I received my JSM years ago in a stock gift from PG. (that's another story) I keep mine as a mad money thingy.What's happening today? Down 3%."
After seeing what happened to POST holdings Ill wait until after ER to buy
"Yowzah, Smucker is jammin away. I'm up 25% in <5 months. Rock solid increasing dividends, and it's still undervalued here, well below it's 5 yr. avg. P/E. Buy low, reinvest divs while working, jam out with a div paycheck when early retired. Simple, if you keep it simple.."
Not here to get rich just make dividends. Enjoying the low beta with still some potential
Why has SJM lost so much value in the recent months? Any idea where it is going? Thank you and regards from Germany. Please use simple English in your response. Thank you.
It's worth buying if it dips under 100 again.
What a dog stock...No movement and the stock market is humming..Can you bark woof woof..
"Glad they went into the pet food business,now will compete amazon.Great timing."
"Earnings were very good, should be enough to propel into $120's. Safe bet with divvy."
That 3.56% dividend yield looks as delicious as a peanut butter and jelly sandwich with some Folgers coffee.
"Paul Smucker said ""nothing like a good depression to boost sales"". Said that to me."
Sold short 3x $100 August puts again for $1.75. Seems like SJM is range-bound between $103 and $112.
anyone adding today down $10?
Long term holder from P&G spinout IPO. Sold some in August. Stock feeling weak again. Hoping for relative strength in downturn. Would like to hold forever...

Stock has been rippin and tearin
"Absolute hording. Someone is hording all the Smuckers boysenberrry syrup on amazon, ebay etc."
$SJM Target Raised by Bank of America Neutral USD 124 » USD 140 Maintains Deutsche Bank Hold USD 138 » USD 140 Maintains Credit Suisse Neutral USD 123 » USD 130
Is this company undervalued and if so would it be a good setup as a value play? I would live to hear any input I could get
It is heading below $100 a share...I will be in low $90s!
I just started to build a position in SJM. I am a believer in owning companies that pay a safe and regularly increasing dividends.
"I don't know the reason, but maybe they think everyone is going to start eating peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. My favorite is the strawberry, I always keep an extra bottle in the cabinet. Now, should I buy or not."
back down
I MAY MAKE SOME MONEY BY END OF DAY I COVER
JM Smucker is down 7.49% to 95.33
Buy at 100
Real nice day today. Stock should inch toward $110 by Mid 2019
"its good to own this stock right now since a majority of their business is done in North America, very little Chinese and European exposure."
"#SJM TA looks great with potential to begin ripping higher. Buy rating: 6.5 at 9trading, target: 137.47."
ex-dividend date?
Come on $121
"SPLIT SPLIT,,,,,TIME FOR A SPLIT-"
"I ended up buying 25 shares at $97 (Placed limit order before the open) for a long haul. If it gaps down again in future, I may add more."
Looking like 118s to 119s prior to earnings release ... Demand for Smuckers products is very strong during pandemic
"Nice move today, maybe people are stockpiling up on coffee"
will close around 102 today
Add GIS and feel safe
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQwefQzlyTc .. ....JM Smucker + ALPP.. Up 7,700 % in 2021."
"Yowza.. I'm up >13% in 9 trading days with Smucker's, even after today's drop. Also locked down the dividend, payed every 91 days and increased yearly. Not too shabby. Buy low, and the divy's got your back while you wait. Reinvest or helppay the bills in early retirement.. Simple folks if you keep it simple.."
SO I GET TO COVER IT SOON HOPE

JM Smucker is up 6.15% to 119.94
Kraft should buy Smuckers. Would be a great fit and boost Kraft from its malaise.
"Yes, up >1% in a big down market day. It's why I bought the consumer defensives, and the divy has got my back as well as being an inreasing paycheck."
Glad I bought this but once it hits 126 I am out of here....not sticking around for the big flop once things go back to normal.
"Since the Smucker family controls the board and the stock, I suggest the company will sell itself when the 4th generation decides they rather have money!"
Typical. This stock went up huge during the recession so it’s only obviously going to go down when the economy is firing on all cylinders.
This is a very good solid company. I have purchased many of their products in grocery stores and online.
Yes
Up 4% today and no real news to speak of. I sold at $118.82 and will buy the next dip.
Target now has the taco and turkey/cheese Uncrustables. The taco was pretty good (could use more filling and less bread). I think Uncrustables in going to continue to expand at an outrageous rate.
Revenue up 11%Guidance raised
SJM reached a new 52 Week Low at 98.50
SHORT COVERING TRYING GET AHEAD OF ME I GOT 100K SHARES TO COVER
"omg, see I told you to sell a month ago at the top (look at my comment below). So obvious it wouldn't hold. You buy the dip and sell into the hype, very simple. Smuckers was headed down BEFORE the virus."
DONT GO ANY HIGHER I GOT TO SHORT COVER
"SJM says smuck a flash crash- back up nicely today. Nice to have good ol div paying consumables when the market is gloomy, especially bought low with a nice margin of error."
SJM is one of my favorite dividend growth stocks. I talk about dividend growth stocks on my youtube channel. The channel is really focused on new and beginner investors looking to invest in dividend growth stocks and ETFs. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrg6IDPf4a7pUKTN90n6syg
"Picked this stock up yesterday AFTER a double bottom on the chart clearly formed. Love their 3% dividend, their business and the FACT they are a BARGAIN at these discounted prices (can you say that for many of the rest of the big cap stocks??)."
thank you
"Solid Bargain at this price, it is Oversold and should get a Bounce back on up to the $105-$108 Region. Long Term investors should take advantage of this opportunity."
"""The J.M. Smucker Co. Announces Pricing of Notes Offering""At least they didn't say it was for ""climate change"", like somebody at GIS...."
SEVERAL YEARS GO..150.00+Today 100.00+This business in my opinion has been mismanaged...We need new management...
"I'm consolidating my portfolio and have been selling of various holdings for a month or so (locked in some decent returns before seeing this overall decline in share prices). I can tell you that SJM will be staying in my portfolio for the long term. I have at least one (smuckers) peanut butter and (smuckers) jelly sandwich a day (sometimes two) and my wife and I go through Folgers coffee like there is no tomorrow! Our pets have also been eating SJM foods as of late. I love this company, their products are terrific and I think they're going to be around for as long as civilization does. Valuation doesn't look too bad either and ex dividend is incoming on top of the recent decline in share price!"

"I'm looking to buy at the 3% yield mark, which would be $104. We're getting real close. SJM is below fair value..nothing like good ol defensive consumer staples with long term rock-solid divies."

Any ideas how tomorrow goes ?
Did anyone here have the stones to catch the jam jar @$96.x yesterday?
I LOVE SJM-
I was wondering why the run up in the stock. The shorts on this were apparently scared off when they saw the action on Gamestop. Lot of open short interest on SJM and if the Reddit Crowd see that and pile in you could have some shorts getting toasted.
