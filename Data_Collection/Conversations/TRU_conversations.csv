Careful in here newbies. WAY overbought.
Why on earth is this commodity stock doing so well? FICO scores are a joke. Talk about sucking off the mother’s teats. A Penny for your thoughts...

This stock didn't bounce back nearly as much as other stocks after the correction in December. This stock will go higher.
TRU reached a 52 Week low at 62.36
so where/what price???
Be $60 in 12 months imo. Growth will be phenomenal.
TransUnion is up 4.93% to 91.33

Shares of TRU are down because of the fallout from EFX. The consumer credit business is a relatively small % of TRU's business and that isn't what drives their revenues. TRU's share will bounce back once all of this is digested.

Solid company. One of the leading credit reporting agency. Everybody needs credit report in good and bad times.
This is a big merger to put together. I see $TRU is involved. There is a lot going on behind the scenes. Patient investors will be happy once its all put together. my advice is diversify you DD and follow multiple message boards. Lot of great info out there. I took a position on the 14th and played it wrong. So I grabbed more today and will let it ride. Now to sit and wait. When the news comes out by the big players in this merger this will def move up fast. Right now everyone involved in the merger are required to quiet till everything is put in place. One reason I hear was they don't want the pumping and dumping by stock players during these negotiations.

"This company is a scam. The sell off after EFX's hack makes absolutely no sense. EFX's erosion of it's disgruntled customer base seems it would be almost immediately accretive for TRU. Plus, what better way to promote your premium products( freeze & lock)? After all, these products are the only proposed solution at this point. IDK, something about this selloff seems a little sketchy to me. TRU would be the first organization I would investigate. Something deeper going on here."
TRU is up 6.18% to 65.50
Stock has to come way in for real buyers to take a position. Too much here. My opinion.
TRU is up 5.74% to 59.74
"Hello I'm new to cryptocurrency and I have been making huge lose but recently i see a lot of people earning from it, please can someone please tell me what is going wrong"

"Why down when they have good earning this quarter ""TransUnion tops Street 2Q forecasts""?"
Time to harvest the gains?
TRU breaking through the $75/share barrier is a big step. Hope results TBA will support continued upward movement.
Get ready for the slow and steady climb.

"adjusted net income up 70%!!!!so as dilution subsides from recent spinoff,EPS growth will look even better!"
"PE and debt too high, with or without EFX scandal."
A wholoe lot of quiet
TRU shot a load. Time to roll over under $80
This is a company that will take a 1 star rated company (on google reviews) for it's word and spoil the credit of somebody with near perfect score - WITHOUT bothering to check the facts or inform first. #$%$
YESSSSSSSSSS
Bought a small position. Future earnings look good. Stock rises even when the market declines.
TRU is down 6.99% to $63.81
"Every credit freeze is a hit to potential revenue. How many informed, educated, affluent people are freezing their credit? How many overall? These are the questions that need to be answered in order to get a proper valuation here. Uncertainty says that this should go lower or sideways until we know what is going on."
Haven't checked on my little stock of lately. I like what I see. Up about 30 since buy in
Just got off the phone with transunion. They will not issue a credit report to me because....I used the address (where my mail is delivered using and that is on my Drivers license (just issued to me in March). I get the impression that the credit system and Transunion are hopelessly broken. Probably run by a bunch of cost cutting MBA genuises.
"People seem to miss the point that consumer credit isn't the bulk of TU's business. it's only about 20%. So at about $42, this is probably a good entry point. Plus TU get's the benefit of business and consumers deserting EFX."
TRU reached a 52 Week low at $52.52
First level in at 42. PE seems a bit too high but the company seems to be doing very well. I hope they can keep up the growth to justify the PE. Will be buying more if second EFX hacking confession causes weak handed TRU holders to sell.
