TRU breaking through the $75/share barrier is a big step. Hope results TBA will support continued upward movement.
Solid company. One of the leading credit reporting agency. Everybody needs credit report in good and bad times.
Shares of TRU are down because of the fallout from EFX. The consumer credit business is a relatively small % of TRU's business and that isn't what drives their revenues. TRU's share will bounce back once all of this is digested.
"People seem to miss the point that consumer credit isn't the bulk of TU's business. it's only about 20%. So at about $42, this is probably a good entry point. Plus TU get's the benefit of business and consumers deserting EFX."
TRU reached a 52 Week low at $52.52

Odd TRU is down about 6% after yesterday's good results. Any insight?
Did anyone listen/see the Investor Day presentations today? I havenâ€™t had a chance yet.
This is a big merger to put together. I see $TRU is involved. There is a lot going on behind the scenes. Patient investors will be happy once its all put together. my advice is diversify you DD and follow multiple message boards. Lot of great info out there. I took a position on the 14th and played it wrong. So I grabbed more today and will let it ride. Now to sit and wait. When the news comes out by the big players in this merger this will def move up fast. Right now everyone involved in the merger are required to quiet till everything is put in place. One reason I hear was they don't want the pumping and dumping by stock players during these negotiations.
This stock didn't bounce back nearly as much as other stocks after the correction in December. This stock will go higher.
Big bet on $75 by OCT 19

Just got off the phone with transunion. They will not issue a credit report to me because....I used the address (where my mail is delivered using and that is on my Drivers license (just issued to me in March). I get the impression that the credit system and Transunion are hopelessly broken. Probably run by a bunch of cost cutting MBA genuises.
