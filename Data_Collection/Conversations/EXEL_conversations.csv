"A long long time ago, in this msg board someone (I don't remember the name) casually mentioned $EXAS would be a good investment. Both $EXEL & $EXAS were at low $20's sp. I sold half of $EXEL and bot $EXAS. The rest is history. Since then $EXAS traded as high as $100+ sp. Thanks for your hint investor."
"Thank you to JBwin from IVIQVIA data - RBC Capital's chart showing increase in market share from 35% Q1 '21, 38% Q2 '21, and 41% for the lastest 16 week trend of TRx and NRx prescribed TKI in RCC. We should see very good number for Q3 ER in a few weeks (Nov 3). Below are the market share in the TKI for the rest of the comparators (Q1, Q2 and latest 16 wk).Inlyta - 34%, 34%, 33%Votrient - 17%, 17%, 16%Sutent - 14%, 12%, 4%"
"Six insiders exercised their options today. Surprisingly, all including Peter Lambs sold portion of their shares to cover tax liability and kept the remaining shares. Peter sold over 160k shares at $17.47, $18.44, $20.46 in the past 3 months(July-Sept). This could be a good sign??? Could we see something special for Q3 ER in early November? Let's hope so."
"Hello,I bought my first shares of Exelixis this morning, after I saw the renal cell announcement on my stock feed; though I'd heard of Exelixis' reputation, I hadn't done due diligence before my purchase -- it was an instinctive/immediate purchase. I've been reading over Exelixis' website/pipeline but would appreciate if someone here, a long-term investor, would comment on which trials are in stage 3 or if there are any upcoming NDA submissions -- whatever they think is a potential milestone. Thank you, Sienna."

Will this be the day EXEL closes over $22 or will we have to wait until next week?

"Exelixis: Regaining Top Spot In Renal Cell Carcinomahttps://seekingalpha.com/amp/article/4457051-exelixis-regaining-top-spot-in-renal-cell-carcinomaSep. 25, 2021SummaryExelixis' climb to stardom began with a strong Cabometyx first-line presence in renal cell carcinoma, but soon dwindled due to the arrival of immunotherapy. Exelixis was pushed back to second line.However, since achieving approval in January, in combination with immunotherapeutic Opdivo, for first-line renal cell carcinoma, Exelixis' Cabometyx has regained the top spot.Last quarter, Exelixis announced 59% YoY net product revenue growth, highlighted by an increasing presence in first-line renal cell carcinoma.By the end of 2022, the company anticipates an annualized run rate of $1.5B for Cabometyx. Exelixis also projects $1.75B in cash by the end of year.Exelixis, with its current market cap near $6.5B without any significant debt, appears conservatively valued. Risks include major competition in RCC, limited optionality, and patent cliff.a woman making and showing number one hand signFarknot_Architect/iStock via Getty ImagesIntroductionAfter achieving first-line approval in renal cell carcinoma [RCC], Cabometyx, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor [TKI], in combination with Opdivo, an immune checkpoint inhibitor [ICI], has picked up steam again, procuring 50%+ net revenue YoY growth. Cabometyx is, once again, seeing broad adoption in first-line RCC, gaining new patients and market share from its main competitor, the other TKI/ICI combination, Inlyta and Keytruda.These new, first-line patients are also living longer, extending the treatment duration. Being the preferred TKI for RCC, Cabometyx is also maintaining a healthy presence in second-line patients as well. This is all pointing towards continued revenue acceleration for Exelixis in the quarters to come. The market, still suffering from biotechnology sector lag, hasn't caught on to this yet. Valued at $6.5B (market capitalization) with no significant debt, $1.5B+ in cash, and $1.25B+ in annual revenue (with 30%+ YoY revenue growth), Exelixis appears conservatively valued.The Path To Stardom, The Path To BoredomOnce a biotechnology darling, excitement in Exelixis has dwindled considerably.ChartData by YChartsBack in 2016, Exelixis' stock would go on to skyrocket in anticipation of its RCC drug, Cabometyx, becoming top dog in first-line RCC. It did, but revenue began to slow a bit towards the end of 2017:A year later, the treatment landscape for RCC turned on its head. ICIs would soon overtake TKIs in first-line RCC in early 2019. Cabometyx lost its footing in first-line patients and began seeing its primary use in second-line.For this reason, and a lack of significant developments outside of RCC, stock in Exelixis has been in limbo since the Spring of '18.Things Are Changing AgainWhile in limbo, Exelixis was working on a trial combination of Cabometyx and an ICI (Opdivo) for advanced, first-line RCC. The trial was successful, with some small caveats, and the TKI/ICI combination was approved in January '21. Back in October '20, when the combination data had been revealed, I proposed that the event was unlikely to ""move the needle"". The stock price, since then, has essentially remained flat, decreasing just 5%. What I didn't foresee is the apparent uptake of Cabometyx and Opdivo in first-line RCC.Cabometyx revenues are, again, accelerating:Source: ExelixisThis is due to increasing adoption in first-line RCC:Source: ExelixisReasons To Believe In Continued Revenue Acceleration within the next year, Exelixis should continue to benefit from continued acceleration of Cabometyx revenue. There are three reasons to believe this is likely:• Cabometyx new patient starts are increasing due to increased market share in first-line RCCAs you can see, the average new patient market share of CABOMETYX in combination with nivolumab in Q2 was 28%. According to the data, the CABOMETYX combination has taken share from other ICI combinations.Exelixis Q2 Transcript• Cabometyx/Opdivo patients live longer, increasing the duration of therapyThe median duration of therapy for patients in the CheckMate 9ER study was approximately 1.5 years. So we believe that these new patient starts will drive demand growth for many quarters to come.Exelixis Q2 Transcript• Cabometyx remains the favored TKI for RCC, buoying its market share in second-line patientsAnd looking at the market basket for RCC TKIs, CABOMETYX was the number one prescribed TKI in Q2 and TRx market share increased to 38%.Exelixis Q2 TranscriptTKI/ICI CompetitionNewer to the market, Opdivo/Cabo, are direct competitors with yet another TKI/ICI combination for advanced RCC, Keytruda and Inlyta. At a glance, the fight seems even. Keytruda is the favored ICI, in general, whilst Cabometyx is the favored TKI in RCC. Importantly, prescribers are already familiar and comfortable with Cabometyx, given years of p"
"Two key people in the company have not sold a single share since May 2021. Dr. Stelios Papadopoulos Ph.D. Co-Founder & Independent Chairman (Holds 1.3M shares)Dr. Michael M. Morrissey CEO, Pres & Director (Holds 2M+ shares)Others with some exceptions are exercising options (CFO Chris Senner exercised 90K shares this week but only sold 55K and added 35K his holdings as well) but not selling right away.CEO MMM was a monthly seller of his holdings without fail but he has stopped selling since May of this year. Why the change in his behavior....we will find out soon.Although there has been a lot of positive news lately but Stock is pretty much in a trading range for a very long time. Big institutions can not be happy with the stock performance while market is all time high and other biotech stocks are moving up nicely......board must do something soon before more institutions bailout of this name."
New phase 3 study with cabozantinib funded by National Cancer Institute listed on clinical trials. Urothelial cancer with completion predicted in 2024. Called the MAIN-CAV study and compares standard care with Avelumab to Cabozantinib plus Avelumab.
Just another boring day in the life of exel. Only one board post in two or three days. No one watching exel including the stock market judging by the low low volume this week. Ho him next week and the week after should have the same results. Let’s hope for not too much good news with exels earnings if that happens exel could tank again.
If the volume gets any lower on exel the sec might delist it.
"$28 is a fair price target, they can always move it up."
Time for 23...........
Why does the price drop ten minutes after opening so often....and the 45 minutes before closing....day after day after day?
"Does anyone have any idea when the following two trials will complete and have their NDA's submitted to the FDA? Ballpark dates? If not, is this something I can find out on the SEC website?COSMIC-312 – phase 3 study evaluating the combination of cabozantinib + atezolizumab in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)COSMIC-313 – phase 3 study evaluating the triplet combination of cabozantinib + nivolumab + ipilimumab in renal cell carcinoma (RCC).Thanks"
"@Tam has been very helpful, but I want to dig deeper into his concern over a May 2022 lawsuit pitting MSN against Exelixis: Tam wrote, ""IMHO ... [Medical] trials are important, but the major overhang for Exelixis is the patent challenge from MSN ... Make sure to set a stop loss before May'22 ... just in case. Anything is possible. I think MSN will not have a chance."" Does anyone know the specifics on this upcoming lawsuit? I've Googled but nothing substantive shows up. Would the share price really sink so low if MSN won? What will they be winning exactly? Wouldn't Exelixis still have plenty of room to grow with their other patents? Essentially, I'm asking how important is this patent both medically and financially, so what will be the damage is Exelixis loses the case."
