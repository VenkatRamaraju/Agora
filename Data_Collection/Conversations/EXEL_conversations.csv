"OK, We were wrong by 2 days when we posted that $EXEL would hit $21.35 the next day! Yesterday's after mkt close stk ran up to $21.40 on 754,000 shares traded. With the news on FDA approval, 2 months earlier than expected, we now see big pharma taking a look at a b.o.

"I have been here since 2007, and this was probably the best quarterly report in the company's history. It also appears that despite the recent trial read out that was somewhat disappointing, they have other irons in the fire. We never expected everything to play out perfectly, so the future still appears healthy. My only however, is my great disapointment that mgt did not announce a share repurchase program. I still think they need to use ongoing free cash flows after investment in R&D etc to take advantage of the low share price and reduce the large float. we shareholders should push for this. It is a sound strategy that is failing to provide a return for its shareholders over the last five years, which s appalling. GLTALsNeil"

"Insiders are exercising and holding on to their shares vs selling them on same day at market prices (except two transactions in June and July which must have been preplanned sales). Although company had announced great numbers last week, stock did not have any reaction; market is sending a strong signal to management team and the board that unless they take some concrete steps to support the stock price, the gravy train of making monthly gains from option exercises is disappearing. Let's hope management starts to work for the the shareholders finally....."
Bought some today. Couldn’t resist. I’ll buy another lot if it continues to drop.
"Six insiders exercised their options today. Surprisingly, all including Peter Lambs sold portion of their shares to cover tax liability and kept the remaining shares.

"Exelixis Statement on the Passing of Two Senior ExecutivesALAMEDA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sep. 6, 2021-- Exelixis, Inc. (Nasdaq: EXEL) today announced that Gisela M. Schwab, M.D., the company’s President, Product Development and Medical Affairs and Chief Medical Officer, passed away over the weekend. Dr. Schwab had been on a medical leave of absence since June 18, 2021.Exelixis President and Chief Executive Officer Michael M. Morrissey, Ph.D., issued the following statement on behalf of the Exelixis team and the company’s Board of Directors:“All of us at Exelixis are deeply, deeply saddened by Gisela’s passing. A brilliant oncologist turned clinical development professional, Gisela was a remarkable leader, mentor, and friend. She was beloved by her colleagues, who were inspired by her strategic thinking, tireless work ethic, and above all, her unwavering dedication to improving care and outcomes for patients with cancer.Sadly, Gisela’s passing comes on the heels of another treasured colleague, Jon Berndt, our Senior Vice President of Sales, who passed away last Wednesday following a lengthy battle with cancer. Losing Gisela and Jon in the same week, both of whom were life sciences industry veterans, is a reminder of our fragility and that cancer knows no bounds. Like Gisela, Jon was a wonderful friend and colleague, and his passing is an enormous loss to all who knew him and to the Exelixis family.”"

There is a jerk who every morning pre-market sells a few shares to himself below the market value. He is hoping to trigger a drop on opening. If you wish to pick up a few cheap shares put in a low bid order in the pre-market and you can make a few dollars off of him.

"@Tam has been very helpful, but I want to dig deeper into his concern over a May 2022 lawsuit pitting MSN against Exelixis: Tam wrote, ""IMHO ... [Medical] trials are important, but the major overhang for Exelixis is the patent challenge from MSN ... Make sure to set a stop loss before May'22 ... just in case. Anything is possible. I think MSN will not have a chance."" Does anyone know the specifics on this upcoming lawsuit? I've Googled but nothing substantive shows up. Would the share price really sink so low if MSN won? What will they be winning exactly? Wouldn't Exelixis still have plenty of room to grow with their other patents? Essentially, I'm asking how important is this patent both medically and financially, so what will be the damage is Exelixis loses the case."

"Hey ""Expert"", where are you hiding? We know you hate EXEL as an investment, but I asked you to tell us what you DO like. Why do you refuse to tell us in your ""expert"" opinion what stocks you do like? I will go first. I really like ENTA and TRIL as high risk high reward stocks. Well, ENTA is less of a risk as it has a nice revenue stream coming from its HepC partnership with ABBV. I think both could be 10 baggers. Don't punk out and say a giant like ABBV, which I have owned for some time and love because of its 5% dividend. I am talking somewhat longer term risks. Your move."

"FDA Approves Pembrolizumab Plus Lenvatinib for Frontline Advanced RCC.This OncLive article came out on Aug. 11th. At first glance, this headline could spell trouble for EXEL's investors. However as I was reading the data, it come to my attention that this combo is more toxic than 9ER and KN426. IMHO, this was what I have expected back in Feb. No doubt that the ORR,PFS and OS data are strong for this combo (CLEAR), but it is really? With much more higher % of favorable risk and lower % of poor risk study participants in the trial, the safety data look awful. 1) 37% (UP FROM 10% discontinuation presented for this combo back in Feb. at the ASCO GU) of patients in the study PERMANENTLY discontinued treatment of either agent or both because of toxicity. 2) 78%... >3 of 4 of patients in this combo required dose INTERRUPTIONS due to toxicity. Of this 78% dose interruptions, 55% due to pembrolizumab and 73% due to lenvatinib.3) 4.3% of patients experienced FATAL adverse reactions.4) Study participants profile: 27% (vs 21% 9ER) favorable risk; 64% intermediate; only 9% (19% 9ER) were poor.5) 51% of patients experienced serious adverse reactions on the investigative arm.The safety data for this combo doesn't look good. In Feb, the KOLs community (including myself) think this combo might be the new SOC in RCC. Now seeing the safety data, I'm don't think the medical community will be taking the risk with this combo when 9ER and KN426 are much safer alternative. 51% serious adverse reactions and 78% required dose interruptions are too much. I think we are back to a ""two horses"" race between 9ER and KN426. Quality of Life data will be key for 9ER. This might be the reason for a positive day for the SP. Crossing my fingers.... we might see $2B product revenue for RCC by 2022.Good luck to all long investors."
It would be nice if EXEL closed over $20 before the long weekend!

The way cohort 6 Cosmic-021 results are being massaged by Exelixis and the PI is ridiculous. First of all there is no “high risk “ metastatic CRPC defined in any previous CRPC pivotal trials . “High volume “” disease has been well described before and is based primarily on number and location of bone mets . So they are inventing a new definition to make it look like this is very bad group of patients but defining it as “ visceral and/ or extra pelvic lymph node involvement” is very misleading . I would agree that visceral mets have usually poor prognosis but if you have only lymph node involvement ( regardless of location) it is a good/ favorable group as compared to bones and visceral mets based on many retrospective reviews . So they are trying to lump poor risk and good risk patients together and call them “high risk” . Despite all of that response rate is a miserable 18% ( 30% is usually required by FDA for accelerated approval ) . I told you all before that Exelixis stupid statements that “ will talk to FDA “ about this data was a joke and if they really did they must have been laughed at . They are stuck doing this Contact phase 3 trial which will be a failure . As always with Exelixis the field has already advanced with multiple new agents particularly Lu 177 PSMA compound and it will dilute any small activity that atezo/ Cabo may have . Prostate indication is dead.
"the dow with a minus 548 in the premarket guess, and exel with a minus 30 are similar......lately, there has been some parallel movements with the dow and exel, with exel doing slightly better----if the dow is less than 200 down, exel might get into the 21 area. By the way....I am really lacking in knowledge about these things. I do not trust exel management, which has made me refuse to sell at 17.......looking for 26 before long. Wary of their purpose in deciding to crash when it suits their needs."
"Great progress both on the top line and profitability in the latest quarter. Until senior management starts to show commitment to improve the stock performance (reduce dilution from equity compensation, align management incentives to stock performance, stock buybacks), it is tough to see stock moving up in a hurry. Any other company with earnings like what was announced yesterday, stock would be up 10%-20% for the day. Wall street is not showing much love to this company's stock......very clear."
"I hate to say it but people like Arthur , Michael , Anonymous, Luke and even myself are spot on in our analysis and predictions ."

"Exelixis Announces Partner Takeda and Ono Receive Approval in Japan for CABOMETYX (cabozantinib) in Combination with OPDIVO (nivolumab) for the Treatment of Unresectable or Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma.ALAMEDA, Calif., August 25, 2021--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Exelixis, Inc. (Nasdaq: EXEL) today announced Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (Takeda), its partner responsible for the clinical development and commercialization of CABOMETYX (cabozantinib) in Japan, and Ono Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Ono) received approval from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare to manufacture and market CABOMETYX in combination with OPDIVO (nivolumab) as a treatment for unresectable or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC).""We’re excited our partner Takeda, along with Ono, will be able to bring CABOMETYX in combination with OPDIVO to patients with advanced kidney cancer in Japan following regulatory approvals as a first-line treatment in the U.S. and EU earlier this year,"" said Michael M. Morrissey, Ph.D., Exelixis’ President and Chief Executive Officer. ""With approximately 25,000 new cases of kidney cancer diagnosed in Japan annually, we’re pleased that this important new treatment option will now be available to Japanese patients in need of new therapies.""The approval is based on CheckMate -9ER, a phase 3 pivotal trial evaluating CABOMETYX in combination with OPDIVO in previously untreated patients with advanced or metastatic RCC compared with sunitinib. In CheckMate -9ER, CABOMETYX in combination with OPDIVO demonstrated superior overall survival (OS) and doubled median progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR) versus sunitinib, with a favorable safety profile.Per the terms of Exelixis and Takeda’s collaboration and license agreement, Exelixis is eligible to receive a milestone payment of $20 million from Takeda upon the first commercial sale of CABOMETYX in combination with OPDIVO for the treatment of RCC. Exelixis continues to be eligible to receive additional development, regulatory and first-sale milestones for potential future cabozantinib indications and is also eligible for sales revenue milestones and royalties on net sales of cabozantinib in Japan.Takeda previously received approvals to manufacture and market CABOMETYX in Japan as a treatment for patients with curatively unresectable or metastatic RCC and for patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) that has progressed after prior systemic therapy.About CheckMate -9ERCheckMate -9ER is an open-label, randomized (1:1), multi-national phase 3 trial evaluating patients with previously untreated advanced or metastatic RCC with a clear cell component. A total of 651 patients (22% favorable risk, 58% intermediate risk, 20% poor risk; 25% PD-L1 ≥1%) were randomized to CABOMETYX at a dose of 40 mg once-daily and OPDIVO (n = 323) versus sunitinib (n = 328). The primary endpoint is PFS; secondary endpoints include OS and ORR. The primary efficacy analysis compares the doublet combination regimen of CABOMETYX and OPDIVO versus sunitinib in all randomized patients. The trial is sponsored by Bristol Myers Squibb and Ono Pharmaceutical Co. and co-funded by Exelixis, Ipsen and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited.About RCCThe American Cancer Society’s 2021 statistics cite kidney cancer as among the top ten most commonly diagnosed forms of cancer among both men and women in the U.S.1 Clear cell RCC is the most common form of kidney cancer in adults.2 If detected in its early stages, the five-year survival rate for RCC is high; for patients with advanced or late-stage metastatic RCC, however, the five-year survival rate is only 13%.1 Approximately 32,000 patients in the U.S. and 71,000 worldwide will require systemic treatment for advanced kidney cancer in 2021.3About 70% of RCC cases are known as ""clear cell"" carcinomas, based on histology.4 The majority of clear cell RCC tumors have below-normal levels of a protein called von Hippel-Lindau, which leads to higher levels of MET, AXL and VEGF.5,6 These proteins promote tumor angiogenesis (blood vessel growth), growth, invasiveness and metastasis.7,8,9,10 MET and AXL may provide escape pathways that drive resistance to VEGF receptor inhibitors.6,7About CABOMETYX (cabozantinib)In the U.S., CABOMETYX tablets are approved for the treatment of patients with advanced RCC; for the treatment of patients with HCC who have been previously treated with sorafenib; and for patients with advanced RCC as a first-line treatment in combination with OPDIVO. CABOMETYX tablets have also received regulatory approvals in the European Union and additional countries and regions worldwide. In 2016, Exelixis granted Ipsen exclusive rights for the commercialization and further clinical development of cabozantinib outside of the U.S. and Japan. In 2017, Exelixis granted exclusive rights to Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited for the commercialization and further clinical develop"

"Biomedicines 2021HCC and Molecular Targeting Therapies: Back to the FuturePublished: 28 September 2021For many years, pharmacological therapies have been limited to sorafenib, which has allowed for some improvement in survival but not in quality of life. Recently, lenvatinib and, in particular, the atezolizumab–bevacizumab combination have been demonstrated to increase survival in HCC patients. Other molecules under study also appear to be possible therapeutic alternatives, albeit with a considerable number of side effects. The new possible therapeutic scenarios represented by vaccines and epigenetic drugs could be the future drug therapy of HCC.Therefore, targeted therapies for HCC are a topic of great interest and constantly being updated thanks to the numerous ongoing clinical trials.https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9059/9/10/1345/htm"

"Unlikely anyone sold a share of EXEL today because of stock based compensation or lack of management incentives. Stock based compensation is 100% aligned with shareholders. Much more aligned than offering up cash bonus checks. The Cabo sales number was unexpectedly good. Organic growth. Can't ask for much more. The path to a multi billion dollar revenue generating franchise is clear. This is a strong buy using anyone's criteria. Won't even bother speculating on todays PPS action, as it could be all kinds of mechanisms at play. In the end, a company providing this type of growth will see a dramatic increase in valuation. The HC Wainwright $64 price target issued today is only the beginning of the valuation adjustment conversations. It's inevitable."
The reality is that Exelixis performance last quarter was barely C or C+ and the problem is that the financial numbers will never get better ( because of growing competition) and the company has no prospects for growth and no exciting pipeline . That’s why real experts ( like me) just yawn at these quarterly numbers

Remember that most members of message boards like this form a support group of sorts trying to justify their ( sometimes ill-conceived) investment .It naturally tends to attract wildly optimistic and unrealistic views while realists and sober analysts are disparaged The problem is that these MBs often perpetuate false hopes for many who would have been better served by cutting their losses and moving on to professional activities they may actually be good at ( not biotech investing)

Thank you, Susan, and thanks to everyone for joining us on the call today. Exelixis’ had a strong second quarter across all segments of our business, as we grew the CABOMETYX franchise and advance our pipeline of promising early-stage programs.The company posted record cabozantinib franchise net product revenue and total revenue in Q2, based on strong demand for the CABOMETYX nivolumab combination across all segments of the first-line RCC market.Syndicated market research highlights that the cabo/nivo doublet plays a leading role in first-line RCC and reflects the strength of the efficacy, tolerability and quality of life data from the CheckMate 9ER trial.We maintained significant momentum with a 59% year-over-year growth in Cabo net product revenue in the second quarter of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020. Our goal remains to exit 2022 with a $1.5 billion annualized run rate for RCC in the US.Exelixis also advanced key 2021 discovery, development and regulatory activities in the second quarter. We reported top line results for the cabo/atezo doublet in first-line HCC from COSMIC-312 and in metastatic CRPC from COSMIC-021 cohort 6. And we'll update you on regulatory feedback and details for upcoming presentations for these two trials in due course.We plan to file new sNDAs for Cabo in these indications, pending positive regulatory feedback, along with the submission of COSMIC-311 in DTC, which was accepted for priority review with the PDUFA date of December 4, 2021.The full portfolio of late-stage COSMIC and CONTACT trials with cabozantinib ICI combinations continues to move forward according to plan. Our early clinical pipeline is advancing with significant progress in the XL092 program the XL102 Phase 1 trial and the initiation of"
"how old are a lot of you, I am assuming over 40 years old since most want a buyback. NO..you don't want a buyback. If they converted their cash to bitcoin when it dipped they would have nearly a 50% GAIN in cash... and could use that to buy out more. Biotech/tech will start merging IMO"
Waiting to sell at 25.Atfter that is a waiting game.

"Exelixis: Regaining Top Spot In Renal Cell Carcinomahttps://seekingalpha.com/amp/article/4457051-exelixis-regaining-top-spot-in-renal-cell-carcinomaSep. 25, 2021SummaryExelixis' climb to stardom began with a strong Cabometyx first-line presence in renal cell carcinoma, but soon dwindled due to the arrival of immunotherapy. Exelixis was pushed back to second line.However, since achieving approval in January, in combination with immunotherapeutic Opdivo, for first-line renal cell carcinoma, Exelixis' Cabometyx has regained the top spot.Last quarter, Exelixis announced 59% YoY net product revenue growth, highlighted by an increasing presence in first-line renal cell carcinoma.By the end of 2022, the company anticipates an annualized run rate of $1.5B for Cabometyx. Exelixis also projects $1.75B in cash by the end of year.Exelixis, with its current market cap near $6.5B without any significant debt, appears conservatively valued. Risks include major competition in RCC, limited optionality, and patent cliff.a woman making and showing number one hand signFarknot_Architect/iStock via Getty ImagesIntroductionAfter achieving first-line approval in renal cell carcinoma [RCC], Cabometyx, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor [TKI], in combination with Opdivo, an immune checkpoint inhibitor [ICI], has picked up steam again, procuring 50%+ net revenue YoY growth. Cabometyx is, once again, seeing broad adoption in first-line RCC, gaining new patients and market share from its main competitor, the other TKI/ICI combination, Inlyta and Keytruda.These new, first-line patients are also living longer, extending the treatment duration. Being the preferred TKI for RCC, Cabometyx is also maintaining a healthy presence in second-line patients as well. This is all pointing towards continued revenue acceleration for Exelixis in the quarters to come. The market, still suffering from biotechnology sector lag, hasn't caught on to this yet. Valued at $6.5B (market capitalization) with no significant debt, $1.5B+ in cash, and $1.25B+ in annual revenue (with 30%+ YoY revenue growth), Exelixis appears conservatively valued.The Path To Stardom, The Path To BoredomOnce a biotechnology darling, excitement in Exelixis has dwindled considerably.ChartData by YChartsBack in 2016, Exelixis' stock would go on to skyrocket in anticipation of its RCC drug, Cabometyx, becoming top dog in first-line RCC. It did, but revenue began to slow a bit towards the end of 2017:A year later, the treatment landscape for RCC turned on its head. ICIs would soon overtake TKIs in first-line RCC in early 2019. Cabometyx lost its footing in first-line patients and began seeing its primary use in second-line.For this reason, and a lack of significant developments outside of RCC, stock in Exelixis has been in limbo since the Spring of '18.Things Are Changing AgainWhile in limbo, Exelixis was working on a trial combination of Cabometyx and an ICI (Opdivo) for advanced, first-line RCC. The trial was successful, with some small caveats, and the TKI/ICI combination was approved in January '21. Back in October '20, when the combination data had been revealed, I proposed that the event was unlikely to ""move the needle"". The stock price, since then, has essentially remained flat, decreasing just 5%. What I didn't foresee is the apparent uptake of Cabometyx and Opdivo in first-line RCC.Cabometyx revenues are, again, accelerating:Source: ExelixisThis is due to increasing adoption in first-line RCC:Source: ExelixisReasons To Believe In Continued Revenue Acceleration within the next year, Exelixis should continue to benefit from continued acceleration of Cabometyx revenue. There are three reasons to believe this is likely:• Cabometyx new patient starts are increasing due to increased market share in first-line RCCAs you can see, the average new patient market share of CABOMETYX in combination with nivolumab in Q2 was 28%. According to the data, the CABOMETYX combination has taken share from other ICI combinations.Exelixis Q2 Transcript• Cabometyx/Opdivo patients live longer, increasing the duration of therapyThe median duration of therapy for patients in the CheckMate 9ER study was approximately 1.5 years. So we believe that these new patient starts will drive demand growth for many quarters to come.Exelixis Q2 Transcript• Cabometyx remains the favored TKI for RCC, buoying its market share in second-line patientsAnd looking at the market basket for RCC TKIs, CABOMETYX was the number one prescribed TKI in Q2 and TRx market share increased to 38%.Exelixis Q2 TranscriptTKI/ICI CompetitionNewer to the market, Opdivo/Cabo, are direct competitors with yet another TKI/ICI combination for advanced RCC, Keytruda and Inlyta. At a glance, the fight seems even. Keytruda is the favored ICI, in general, whilst Cabometyx is the favored TKI in RCC. Importantly, prescribers are already familiar and comfortable with Cabometyx, given years of p"

"IMHO, I recommend everyone who is holding Long EXEL, we write a request to BLACKROCK, a financial Investment, discussing with Exelixis in working for shareholders by approve the buyback company stock. This is the only way making the stock price rally much higher to a decent price. BLACKROCK is one of the major holders of EXEL. I strongly believe that if BLACKROCK listens and accepts our requests, we will see the buyback stock should be approved by Exelixis's BOD.GLTA"
covered call sellers dream lol. Just build a position and sell calls collecting the premium. The risk is a buyout around 30 but we've been saying that for years
Wow! Shorts in complete control.

"Ipsen results -Q2 Transcripthttps://seekingalpha.com/article/4443930-ipsen-s-ipsey-ceo-francesco-caio-on-q2-2021-results-earnings-call-transcript David Loew Ipsen CEOCabometyx in monotherapy delivered strong volume growth mainly in second-line renal cell carcinoma across most geographies. We are pleased with the recent launch of the combination with nivolumab in Germany and we look forward to further launches in due course. In oncology, we were pleased to opt-in with Exelixis in differentiated thyroid cancer, a small financial opportunity but a big potential step for patients. In the total, we continue to invest to support the growth of the business. Further investments were made in the launch of Cabometyx combination in first-line renal cell Ayaz Ebrahim Yeah, Ayaz Ebrahim, JP Morgan. Hello, Ayaz Ebrahim, JP Morgan. Just two questions for me to. The question is on Cabometyx. Just following the disappointing ATC data, just wondering how you see the past to peak sales of #$%$700 million. I mean if you can give us an update on expectations for non-small cell lung cancer, and prostate cancer, in terms of your confidence in those indications and the timing of any data laid-out? And my second question is on the BKX-001 just if you could talk us through the [indiscernible] process behind in licensing that asset in terms of what you've seen in the profile that differentiates it from lung cancer? David Loew Thanks a lot Ebrahim. Great questions. Hepatocellular is not going to influence the guidance that we have given with the above #$%$700 million peak sales. Reason is, you remember that we stated before that we don't have a patents on [indiscernible] in China that we were looking in -- okay, what is achievable there, of course, you don't have hepatocellular as a very high incidence in China. And so, therefore, in our forecast model, HCC was actually not having a very large weight in addition, that is quite an ironic effect. Of course, if you do not bring a new indication your price is going to stay where it is with the renal cell indication. So, short-term, it will be actually slightly accretive. Of course, longer term, we will lose a little bit of sales, but it was not so meaningful that, we have to change the guidance. So we're going to stick to our guidance there. In terms of non-small cell lung cancer and castrate resistant prostate cancer, you remember that we have had good Phase Ib results and so we are believing that this is a good combination and we expect to filing still 2023. Unidentified Analyst And then secondly, on Cabometyx the Q2 was flat versus Q1 and how do you [indiscernible] could help us understand how the launch in first-line is progressing? And as we're seeing new patient flow there and any feedback you're receiving from the physicians? David Loew Then for Cabometyx, in terms of patient flow and market shares and volumes. So you have seen that our sales kept on increasing. And we see good gains in volumes. Second-line and we see also the first-line launch in Germany starting to pick up. It's a bit early in terms of market research data, you know we have -- very recently launched. So we need a little bit more distance, but the feedback from the [indiscernible] is very positive. They see that Cabo vivo it?s bringing a very good balance of very high efficacy and good safety combined with an excellent quality of life. So I think it's a very competitive regimen. Thank you"
